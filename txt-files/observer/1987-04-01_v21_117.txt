A chronic speeder from New Buffalo, Mich., in a hurry to get from Canada to Chicago, was stopped three times for speeding in one day. It would have been cheaper for him to fly. Trooper Peter Rahm said the 37-year-old Montreal resident was stopped in Van Buren County on Saturday after being clocked at 93 mph. He also was stopped outside Benton Harbor, where he allegedly was driving 83 mph, and near New Buffalo, where he was timed at 80 mph.

Gullibility 'used and abused' in April Fools' Day pranks 
April Fools' Day is like Valentine's Day. Everyone recognizes the occasion, but its origins are not universally known. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, this custom origniated in France after Charles IX adopted a reformed calender in 1564. "A person who resisted changing the New Year's Day from April 1 to January 1 was victimized by pranksters." In France an April Fool came to be known as a poisson d'arvil (April Fish), while in Scotland a fool is regarded as an April Gowk (cuckoo). 
At any rate, this is the day when everyone's gullibility is used and abused. Having a twin brother or sister is a lot of fun on the first day of April. I felt like I had all the power in the world when, in the first grade, my twin sister and I confused our teachers (very important "significant others" in the lives of seven year olds). That year I had the best April Fools' Day of my life. I was convinced that my teacher, Sister Valeria, lost the part of the Wicked Witch of the West in the "Wizard of Oz" because she was too mean for the role. Meanwhile Jackie's teacher was reminscent of Glenda the Good Witch of the North. We continued this practice until we were in the fourth grade. (At that time my mom was my teacher, and we figured she probably wouldn't fall for the cute Bobsey twin routine.) 
Normally I don't consider myself to be a prankster, but through those few childhood ex­periences, I realized just how gullible people can be. The realization of having been duped is one of the strangest emotions a human being feels. First, a vulnerability has been exposed, so the person who has just been "had" naturally becomes defensive. This person will experience hot flashes of anger against the teaser. After this emotional outburst, the anger will become self-directed rather than other-orientated. Ba­sically, the gullible party, after being found out, feels extreme overall frustration at the entire world. 
Most of the fun of April Fools' Day comes when the teasers can see the fruit of their labors by embarrassing the gullible party to death. Often times, this embarrassment will surface in the form of extreme blushing. 
Everyone falls into the "gullibility trap," some more often than others, but no one thinks it will ever happen to him or herself. A classic example of someone falling prey to this trap occurred when one of my uncles had told my grandmother the statue on top of the Golden Dome was not actually the Blessed Virgin, Mot-

In a day when everyone tries as hard as pos­sible to affect an attitude, it's nice to see people observe a day when it's socially acceptable to kick back and let the little kid come out. 
Probably most people will be careful not to fall for corny April Fools' jokes, but, undoubt­edly, everyone will fall prey to those mongers, who have a knack to find everyone's gul­libilities, at one time or another. Please take this advice to heart for the next time you may happen to fall for a line: go through the typical anger and frustration moods and then plan your revenge on the jerk who set you up. Remember that everyone has a weak spot, so don't get mad, simply get even.

Harvard professor notes increase in technical quality of public policy 
By THERESA HAR­RINGTON 
News Staff 
In the finale of the Distin­guished Visiting Scholar Series Dr. Harvey Brooks, professor of technology and public policy at Harvard University pre­sented a lecture Tuesday night titled "What to Do When the Experts Disagree: Technologi­cal Decision Making in aDem­ocratic Society." 
Brooks focused on the in­creasing technical content of public policy and political is­sues. He also discussed the im­portance of scientific evidence, scientific judgement and the in­terpretation of scientific data in legislative, judicial and ex­ecutive decisions, as well as in political debate. 
According to Brooks, there are several models of interac­tion between policy makers and scientists. They ranged from independent research fol­lowed by recommendations to Congressional committees, to options influenced by preferred policy outcomes. Each of these models have weaknesses and strengths, but as Brooks said, "not one best approach clearly dominates ... (and) what is needed is variety and ex­perimentation" of them. 
One possible cause of weak­ness in the models, according to Brooks, is the relationship between scientists and legisla­tors that has emerged in the last 10 years. As Brooks said, "in the U.S. Congress the push to success seems to rely on be­coming an expert in certain areas. Therefore, they rely heavily on experts ... who exag­gerate what they know because they are flattered by politicians interested in their specialty." 

Within Congress, Brooks said, there is "strong pressure to develnp scientific rationale for their decisions'' though in­dividual scientists may come to very different policy recom­mendations which may be un­duly influenced by their own political views. 
Brooks said he advocated continued improvement of ''reports written in response to requests by Congressional committees ... (because) high degree of selectivity makes for higher quality of studies."

TwoSMC professors selected for endowment 
By COLLEEN HARTY 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's Associate Pro­
fessor of English Anne Loux 
and Associate Professor of 
Humanistic Studies Gail Man­
dell have been selected for the 
Lily Endowment Faculty Open 
Fellowships for the 1987-88 aca­
demic year. 
Loux and Mandell are among 
10 faculty members from inde­
pendent four year universities 
and colleges in Indiana chosen 
for the fellowships. 
The awards allow teachers 
whose needs and aspirations 
might not be met by more con­
ventional fellowships to pursue 
work-study and research proj­
ects of their own design. 
"This is like being able to 
dream," said Loux. "This 
grant is really exceptional. It's 
a personal development grant 
-a grant that asks you to dream. 
It's only sometimes that you 
actually get that chance," 
Loux said. 
Mandell said she feels that 
an endowment of this sort al­
lows one to become a better 
teacher. "One is able to pro­
pose a research project which 
other institutions don't offer," 
she said. 
"The Lily endowment crosses disciplines,'' Mandell said, adding, "It takes you beyond the traditional re­search areas in your field." 
Loux said she will devote the endowment to fiction writing or a personal history entitled ''Chicago Mississippi'' about growing up in Mississippi. She said she plans to illustrate that "growing up in Mississippi is not that different from growing up in Chicago." 
Mandell said she plans to study the question of biography as a form of writing. Mter reading biographical works and talking with biographers, Mandell said she will report her findings in a pamphlet. 
"My ultimate aim is to write a biography on someone and this endowment will help me to decide which one," Mandell said.

and exploitive and said she either selectively omitted in­formation or lied outright during testimony about aspects of her life. 
''This inability to tell the truth establishes a tarnished ... environment" for raising the child, the judge said. 
Mrs. Whitehead, who was ar­tificially inseminated with Stern's sperm, said she realized during thP baby's birth March 27, 1986, that she could not give up her daughter. 
She refused her $10,000 fee and fled to Florida with the in­fant when the Sterns obtained a court order giving them tem­porary custody. For 87 days she moved from relative to rela­tive, until authorities tracked her down and returned the chubby, blue-eyed girl to the Sterns. 
The Tenafly couple iie a 41­year-old biochemist and she a pediatrician sued for per­manent custody, setting the stage for Tuesday's landmark decision. 
The precedent set by the judge's ruling applies only in New Jersey, but will have im­plications for other courts, re­ligious leaders, politicians con­sidering laws on the issue, adoption advocates, potential surrogates and childless couples. 
The child's court-appointed guardian, attorney Lorraine Abraham, recommended that the Sterns get custody and that Mrs. Whitehead be denied visitation rights for at least five years. 
The three-month trial stirred up a worldwide debate over surrogate parenting. Oppo­nents maintain the practice amounts to baby selling and ex­ploits women, while supporters endorse surrogacy as one way for couples to achieve paren­thood. 
The Vatican condemned sur­rogate motherhood last month, saying it "offends the dignity of the right of the child,'' and some feminists picketed at the courthouse to support Mrs. Whitehead, saying that no mot­her should be forced to give up her baby. 
The same argument was made by attorneys for the 29­year-old Brick Township homemaker and mother of two other children. They told Sorkow that surrogate parent­ing should be outlawed because no woman can be expected to agree to give up her child before she even conceives. 
Attorneys for the Sterns con­tended the surrogate agree­ment reached Feb. 6, 1985, was valid because all involved knew what they were signing. But Mrs. Whitehead testified she did not read the contract until after the custody battle began.

ND freshmen opinion revealed 
Special to The Observer 
Most Notre Dame freshmen oppose legal abortion, want to raise families, and believe that couples should not live to­gether before marriage, ac­cording to a nationwide sur­vey of freshmen entering private universities. 
The survey, conducted last fall by the University of Cal­ifornia at Los Angeles and the American Council on Educa­tion, also found that incoming Notre Dame freshmen were more likely than freshmen at other private universities to describe their political views as "conservative." At Notre Dame 33.5 percent were will­ing to accept that label com­pared with 26.8 percent of their counterparts nation­wide. 
Highlighting objectives they thought "essential or very important," a slightly larger percentage (77.3) of Notre Dame freshmen chose "raising a family" than did their counterparts at other private universities (72.5). 
Fewer freshmen at Notre Dame (30.9%) believed that couples should live together before marriage than in the national average, where 46.7 percent tolerated premarital cohabitation. 
Notre Dame freshmen seem more enthusiastic about "developing a philosophy of life,'' with 56.7 percent of them listing that objective as essential or very important as compared with 50.8 percent of incoming freshmen at other private universities. 
Significant disparities be­tween freshmen at Notre Dame and freshmen at other private universities occurred in answers to a survey ques­tion about legal abortion. In the national average, 57.0 per­cent agreed "strongly or somewhat" that abortion should be legalized compared with 29.4 percent at Notre Dame. 
In a related matter, more Notre Dame freshmen (31.1% compared with 28.3% in the national sample) favor aboli­tion of the death penalty. 
In both the national sample and at Notre Dame, a majority of mcoming fresh­men seem to believe that "nuclear disarmament is at­tainable," although Notre Dame freshmen are 4.1 per­cent more optimistic than those in the national sample, where 52.9 percent responded affirmatively to the question. 
More Notre Dame fresh­men (94.7%) were graduated in the top 20 percent of their high school class than their peers at other private univer­sities, 71 percent of whom had achieved equal academic rank. Of Notre Dame fresh­men, 48.7 percent were graduated from high school with an A or A¢ average, com­pared with the 28.9 in the na­tional average. 
Notre Dame was the first university chosen by 84.2 per­cent of its incoming fresh­men; in the national sample, 
72.8 percent were enrolled at their first choice. 
Notre Dame freshmen seem more hopeful about their post graduation employ­ment prospects than fresh­men at other private uinver­sities. At Notre Dame, 81.6 percent expect to find a job in their preferred field com­pared with 72.8 percent in the national sample. 
In at least one respect, the hopes of 25.3 percent of Notre Dame's freshmen have been dashed by now. That portion of the incoming freshmen class estimated that "chances are very good" that they would join fraternities or sororities at a University which has never had either. 


House casts vote to override veto 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON The Democratic-controlled House voted 350-73 Tuesday to over­ride President Reagan's veto of an $88 billion highway and mass transit bill, sending the measure to the Senate for the final round of a bruising politi­cal struggle. 
The margin was 68 votes more than the two-thirds needed to override the presi­dent's action on the bill, which couples more than 100 road projects made to order for in­dividual lawmakers with a provision permitting the states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour on most

stretches of interstate high­way. 
The Senate debated the veto for more than an hour Tuesday but postponed a vote until Wed­nesday. 
The only suspense in the House was the margin of Reagan's defeat, where 248 Democrats and 102 Republicans -including GOP leader Bob Michel of Illinois and Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi -cast their votes to override the veto. Democratic Rep. Norman Sisisky of Virginia and 72 Republicans voted to sustain Reagan. 
Michel noted the presence of funds in the bill to complete a highway widening project in his district, and said he was making a "very difficult, agonizing decision for the first time in the Reagan presidency'' to oppose him on a major bill. 
Freshman GOP rep. Arthur 
Ravenel Jr. of South Carolina 
reflected the political appeal of 
the bill when he said, "You can 
bet your spring petunias this 
Congress will override the 
veto. President Reagan, he 
ain't going to be running in 
1988, but I am." 
House Speaker Jim Wright, 
D-Texas, said the outcome was 
a ''very gratifying victory in 
the House. Members stood up 
for their own conviction, stand­
ing up to blandishments and 
pressure" from the White 
House. 
Democrats argued that the measure was under budget, and said a successful veto would cost 800,000 jobs in the coming construction season. A provision permitting states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph on rural portions of the inter­states was also politically at­tractive to Western law­
_makers.

U.S. adviser killed in attack on army base 
Associated Press 
EL PARAISO, El Salvador­Guerrillas raided a major army base before dawn Tues­day, killing at least 43 soldiers and a U.S. military adviser, the first to die during battle in the 7 -year-old civil war. 
El Salvador's military com­mander said the American, identified as Staff Sgt. Gregory Fronius, 27, of Greensburg, Pa., was killed by mortar fire near a command post. 
The military said 35 soldiers were wounded by leftist rebels who assaulted the base behind a barrage of cannon, mortar and grenade fire. Base com­mander Col. Gilberta Rubio, who was slightly wounded, said the number of attackers had not been determined. 
Officials said seven guerril­las died in the attack on the 4th Infantry Brigade garrison at El Paraiso in Chalatenango prov­ince, a rebel stronghold, and some penetrated the camp. El Paraiso is nearly 40 miles north of San Salvador, capital of El Salvador 
"Because of the seriousness of the injuries, the number of dead (soldiers) may increase," said Gen. Adolfo Blandon, chief of the armed forces. He visited the base to assess the situation. 
Soldiers on the scene esti­mated government casualties at about 65 dead and more than 100 wounded. 
According to U.S. policy, American advisers do not par­ticipate in offensive military action or enter areas where combat is occurring or likely, but may visit ''carefully selec­ted and secure sites" such as garrisons. They are armed and may respond if fired upon. 

The United States has a self­imposed ceiling of 55 on the number of advisers serving in El Salvador at one time, but fewer sometimes are on duty. 
Tuesday's rebel attack was the largest since a June 1986 guerrilla assault on the army base at San Miguel, 86 miles east of San Salvador. The mil­itary said 50 soldiers were killed or wounded there, but the rebels claimed a total of 250. 
U.S. embassy spokesman Pen Agnew said Fronius was training Salvadoran troops at the El Paraiso garrison. 
At the Pentagon in Washing­ton, the Army said he had a wife and child an<;l was as­signed to the 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, based in Panama. 
Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said the sergeant was part of a two-man team as­signed to the area and his partner was not at the garrison when the rebels attacked. 
Blandon said the rebels began firing mortars, grenade launchers and a 90mm cannon at 2 a.m., aiming at the com­mand post, barracks and offi­cers' mess. He said 250 soldiers were at the base. 
The command post, a bar­racks and an officers' mess were destroyed and other buildings damaged. Reporters saw at least three destroyed military vehicles.

TOKYO -Anti-American sentiment among Japanese citizens will grow if the United States goes ahead with penalty duties on up to $300 million worth of Japanese electronic goods, a senior government of­ficial said Tuesday. 
"The atmosphere in Japan against the Americans would become -not so good. They would think the U.S. was emo­tional and illogical,'' said Noburo Hatakeyama, director general of the International Trade Administration Bureau. 
Hatakeyama repeated warn­ings from other Japanese offi­cials that Japan would consider retaliation if its negotiators cannot dissuade the United States from going ahead with the penalty duties. But he did not offer any details on what form the retaliation might take. 
"We might get tough. What is important is to ask them to withdraw the duties and ask them to understand the true sit­uation. And we can retaliate after that," if necessary, he told a group of foreign jour­nalists. 
Although Japan is striving to cut its huge trade surplus, it cannot make any concessions on semiconductor trade to fend off the planned U.S. penalty duties because it is doing noth­ing wrong, Hatakeyama said. 
"If we offer any concessions, then that suggests we acknowl­edge having violated the agree­ment," he said. "But in this case we've done nothing wrong, so there is nothing we can concede." 
The Reagan administration said last week it plans to im­pose prohibitive tariffs on a range of Japanese electronic goods in mid-April to force Japan into compliance with an accord on semiconductors. Japan agreed last year to open its home market to U.S.-made chips and to avoid selling its chips in foreign markets at un­fairly low prices.

145.65 yen, down from Mon­day's close of 146.20 yen, which had been its lowest point since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940s. 
The steep fall of the dollar, although it should help shrink trade imbalances, has raised fears of recession in J a _pan and 
inflation and higher interest rates in the United States. 
Hatakeyama said the duties on electronic products, sched­uled to take effect in two weeks, would have minimal financial impact, but "the psychological impact would be very big .... First of all, we are not accus­tomed to this type of retaliation or game."

Once the budgeting process has been completed in April of each year, it is then the re­sponsibility of the Student Body Trea­surer to keep an accurate record of all r finances and to disburse all funds of the

On April 11, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., groups of students will be going out into the South Bend community to do a va­riety of fix-uplclean-up projects. They will be doing things such as painting, planting trees and flowers, doing minor repairs, cleaning parks, etc. The work sites were located with the help of the mayor's office, the Notre Dame Com­munity Relations Office, and a number of community organizations including the North East Neighborhood Associa­of these responsibility, then Student Government needs your help. Every year, during April, interviews are held to select someone to serve as the As­sistant Student Body Treasurer. Appli­cants must be sophomores in the Col­lege of Business Administration. The person chosen will have the opportunity to serve for two years and with two different Student Government Ad­ministrations. During your Junior year, you will serve as the Assistant Trea­surer in a learning capacity to become familiar with the financial operations of Student Government in preparation to assume the responsibilities of the Student Body Treasurer on April 1, 1988. 
The Student Body Treasurer has the opportunity to serve as a voting mem­ber of the two main decision making bodies on campus, the Student Senate and the SAB Steering Committee. The Treasurer serves as the Chairperson of the Student Senate Budget and Finance Committee. This is perhaps the Trea­surer's most important responsibility, the coordinating of budget requests~ participating in the allocation process and preparing the final budget. Throughout the year, the Treasurer shall then oversee that the fiscal policies are followed and that all clubs and organizations adhere to their spending guidelines. As a member of the SAB Steering Committee, which sets SAB policy and approves SAB up­coming events, you would have a behind-the-scenes look at events as well as the chance to have input on proposed future events. 

One of the best features of both the positions of the Assistant Student Body Treasurer and the Student Body Trea­surer, is the freedom to be creative with the position. You have a set of respon­sibilities and are accountable to the Stu­dent Senate and the student body, but you can expand your duties. As the year progresses and as your understanding increases, you will be able to imple­ment more efficient ways to ac­complish the same results. This year a computer system has been added to aid in preparing more accurate and timely financial reports. 
Involved with this position is a gradually increasing time committ­ment as the year goes on. Traditionally, as you begin to better understand the financial operations and as you begin to assume more responsibility, the more time you want to spend working with people involved in Student Gov­ernment and SAB. An enthusiastic team comprised of the Bookkeeper, SAB Controller, Student Body Trea­surer and Student Body Assistant Trea­surer work together to produce the most useful and accurate financial in­formation. 
We encourage you to get involved. Experience is not necessary because everyone is learning together. You will meet a lot of people, many of which will become good friends. If your interest has been sparked, stop up to the Second Floor of LaFortune and pick up an ap­plication. If you have any questions: come to the Student Government open house on Wednesday, April1, from 7: 00­
9:00 p.m. We hope you'll check it out.

Students asked to join Great Hunger Clean-Up 
tion, Dismas House and La Casa de Amistad. 
Prior to the Clean-Up, students will collect pledges from friends, family, faculty members, etc. (It's the same concept as a walk-a thon). The individ­ual fundraising goal is $30 per person. Every student who reaches this goal will receive a classy Notre Dame ball­point pen, compliments of the Alumni Association. 
Additionally, there are prizes for stu­dents who collect the most money, in­curling free dinners, gift certificates, T-shirts, and an "Escape Weekend" at the Marriott Hotel. The Grand Prize is a round-trip ticket to anywhere in the continental United States (courtesy of Executive Travel, Inc.). Half of the money raised will be used toward meeting hunger needs here in South Bend. The other half goes to Third World countries, where it will be put into agricultural development projects where it will have a lasting impact. 

South Bend is not the only city in which a Hunger Clean-Up will be taking place. On April 11, 61 cities across the nation will be participating in this event. "USA for Africa"-has been in­strumental in organizing this event at the national level. At Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, the Overseas Develop­ment Network, the World Hunger Coal­ition, and the Saint Mary's Social Ac­tion club, as well as a number of other dedicated individuals have gotten the ball rolling. 
Sign-ups are Tuesday and Wednes­day in the dining halls, in the dorms, and in the Center for Social Concerns Monday through Thursday evening. The Community Service Commis­sioners are the Hunger Clean-Up rep­resentatives in the dorms. They will have sign up sheets and pledge sheets posted outside their doors. There will be a free pizza andk>r ice cream party for the dorm with the highest partici­pation rate and possibly another one for the dorm that raises the most money (per capita). 
Please note that the Hunger Clean-Up does not conflict with the Fisher Hall Regatta taking place later that after­noon. Also, University Food Services has graciously agreed to extend the hours of the cook-out lunch to 2 p.m. so that Hunger Clean-Up participants can be assured of getting some food. 
Join our effort and sign up soon! Hope to see you all out there !

P.O.BoxQ 
Administration shows poor timing again 
Dear Editor: 
A few days ago I received a phone call from an organizer of the Bookstore Basketball tournament. After a brief introduction the voice started in with an unsolicited apology. As he continued I soon realized that our team name, "Condoms From Hell," was being cen­sored for the remainder of the tourna­ment and that we would now be know as team 369. When I inquired as to why, he slowly admitted that it was the work of an "external force." 
In the March 30 edition of The Obser­ver, this "force" was identified as a joint student-administration panel es­tablished as a result of concerns originating in the administration over the appropriateness of the names. Yes, the old Notre Dame "External Force" (which says it all for anyone in Howard Hall this year, for any member of Scholastic or for that matter, for any student who has studied at Notre Dame for more than a semester) acted again. 
I do not want to belabor these points, though. Instead, it seems a deeper, more unsettling habit seems to be de­veloping. It seems the administration is developing a chronic case of "poor timing." For example, look how well the Howard conversion was handled: notifying the students during their finals week. The same situation has oc­curred with the tournament name cen­sorship. 

The March 30 issue of The Observer stressed several examples in which the team names were questioned by the ad­ministration in past years. I think it would have been possible, with a little foresight of course, to predict that this year's team names would be of similar themes. Instead of merely telling tourn­ament organizers to announce that in­appropriate names would be censored, the administration acted after the teams had submitted names and again placed themselves in direct conflict 
with the students.  
There  is  an  old,  overused  cliche  
which  might  be  applicable  here:  
''Think Before You Act.''

Entire university should get involved in justice 
As Father Hesburgh prepares to step down from his position as President of Nore Dame in May, much attention will focus on his active involvement in various justice issues. Certainly these accolades are deserved for his efforts with the Civil Rights commission, with Nuclear Disarmament, and most recently, for the establishment of the institute for International Peace Studies. However, will his leaving sig­nal the end of Notre Dame's role in peace and justice areas? Has the Uni­versity relied too much in the past on the efforts of one individual to carry out its mission to bring about peace with justice in the world? 
Margarita Rose 
guest column 

Fortunately, a small portion of the Notre Dame community -students, fac­ulty and staff -devote their efforts to this pursuit, although these efforts are often unrecognized. Now the time has come for a larger portion of the com­munity to become actively involved. A university known for its commitment to peace and justice because of its pres­ident must demonstrate that this com­mitment is pervasive throughout its membership. Participation in peace and justice efforts begins with an awareness and knowledge of injustice. Several upcoming events will offer us the opportunity to gain this knowledge. 
In light of the March 21 -April 6 na­tional Weeks of Anti-Apartheid Action, the African Studies Program is spon­soring a film series (also supported by the Notre Dame Anti-Apartheid Net­work) which focuses on the injustice of the system of apartheid in South Africa. The series is named in honor of the late Steve Biko, a leader of the Black Con­sciousness Movement in South Africa who died in detention, and Professors Joan and Jimmy Stewart, South Africans who taught at Notre Dame several years ago and later died in a car accident which was most likely an act of sabotage by the South African Security Forces. 
The remaining films will be shown Monday, March 30, through Wednes­day, April1, all at 8 p.m. in the Center for Social Concerns. On Thursday eve­ning, April 2, a very special event will take place in the form of a public lec­ture by Father Malusi Mpumlwana. Malusi is a South African priest who, as a member of the Black Conscious­ness Movement, was arrested and severly tortured. His lecture, entitled "South Africa: The Liberation Struggle," will also begin at 8 p.m. in the Center for Social Conerns. 
Sadly, Notre Dame's record for pursuing justice is tarnished by the South African issue. While Father Hes­burgh has been involved in behind-the­scenes dealings to bring a handful of South African students to Notre Dame and to sign proclamations condemning apartheid, the University itself has failed to make a committed public stance in support of those who suffer in that country. High-level communica­tions by big-name university presidents is an inadequate response to our call to be peacemakers. We all should be in­volved, as Catholis or Christians or simply people committed to a just and peaceful world. 
Another chance to become involved 
will be offered by Peace with Justice 
Week which will take place April 6-11. 
The week begins with a video, "God and Money," which explores some of the issues raised by the U.S. Bishops' Letter on the U.S. Economy; it will be followed by a discussion led by Profes­sor Drew Christiansen of the Theology Department. Starting at 7 p.m., the video will take place in the Grace Hall Pit. 
Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit, president of Pax Christi (USA), will discuss his role as peacemaker in the context of the Len­ten theme, "God does not see as we see -for we look at appearances, but the Lord looks into the heart." The Bishop's address will take place Wednesday, April 8, at 7 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church. 
A theater presentation, ''Peasant of El Salvador," will be performed Thursday evening at 9 p.m. in Wash­ington Hall. This award-winning play focuses on the struggles experienced by a Salvadora peasant family within the context of social and political change gripping their country. 
On Saturday, April 11, the "Great Hunger Clean-Up'" will engage stu­dents in community imporvement proj­ects. Sponsors of the clean-up will donate money to be used for various hunger relief efforts. 
All of the events of Peace with Justice week are intended to make the Notre Dame community aware of the call made by Pope John XXII in his encycli­cal "Pacem in Terris." In this letter, Pope John called on the members of the Church to seek a more peaceful world by creating a more just one. We begin to do so by understanding the issues of peace and justice in the world around us, an understanding brought about through dialogue. 
One event during Peace with Justice Week will attempt such a dialogue in considering the specific role of the U ni­versity in instilling a sense of justice in its students. President-elect Father Malloy will lecture on the topic "Educa­tion for Justice: Is it Possible?" on Tuesday, April 7, at 7:30 p.m. in Washington Hall. Following the lec­ture, a panel of graduate and under­graduate students will offer their views on the subject. 
It is because of Notre Dame's com­mitment to its Catholic identity that it has the obligation to heed to papal call to pursue peace with justice. Does the burden of carrying out this obligation fall only upon the shoulders of organi­zations like the Center for Social Con­cerns, the Peace Institute and Univer­sity Ministry? Should not all aspects of the University embrace its commit­ment? While students have many op­portunities to become involved in peace and JUStice related organizations and activities outside the classroom, how many encounter these matters as part of their curriculum? Where does edu­cation's i'Ole in bringing about justice in the world begin? Where does it end?

P.O.BoxQ 
Financial aid is not based upon one's sex 
Dear Editor: 
The Observer's assistant news editor Chris Julka has committed two serious errors as a professional editor in his March 25 editorial in which he portrays himself as some sort of victim of 
"reverse discrimination"  as  a  white  
male.  
For one,  he makes his  accusation  

based on information that cannot, by law, be verified by anyone reading his article. He claims by that using identi­cal information on family income, his sister qualified for the Federal Pell Grant while he did not, and that his parents were expected to make twice the financial contribution for him as for her. 
If this were truly the outcome only one explanation is possible. They did not have identical financial information on both applications. Either he had more personal savings at his disposal or he made an error on the application. This, however, is confidential informa­tion. Item number nine on the FAF, identifying male or female, is optional. There is no federal law requiring the Department of Education to factor sex into the needs formula. 
I believe that the seriousness of the 
misinformation being fostered by this 
editorial requires that the Notre Dame 
Office of Student Financial Aid publish 
a statement clarifying the federal 
policy. 
Secondly, he sets up a straw person to knock down in his statement that feminists such as Ellen Goodman are arguing, de facto, that white females "have it as bad as black males." No feminist will deny or underplay the dis­crimination against black males. A recent study by the Center for the Study of Social Policy estimates that 45 per­cent of all black males in the country do not have jobs, including not only those officially classified by the Census Bureau but also those who are counted as "discouraged" and no longer looking for work. To attribute this degree of unemployment to attitude or lack of ability on the part of black males is considered racist by most standards. 
If black males suffer as victims of widespread discrimination, black females suffer doubly -as blacks and as women. Over 50 percent of all black families with children under 18 are headed by women and 74.2 percent of all black children, under the age of six living in female-headed families, live below the poverty line. No one espous­ing feminist values reserves the right of equality and a decent standard of living for white women and children alone, as Julka implies they do. 
If he believes that women are not dis­criminated against in this society he must believe that they are getting paid what they are worth. Women earn less than men at every level. Whether they work in professional fields dominated by men (such as accounting, in which female workers comprise less than 40 percent of all workers and earn only 
71.2 percent of what men earn), in retail (women make up over 60 percent of the work force and yet earn only 67.4 of what men earn) or in occupations dominated by women (such as clerical jobs, in which women make up 78.4 per­cent of the work force an yet earn only 67 percent of what men earn), women consistently earn less than men. 
Even when we compare the 1981 fig­ures for occupations in which men and women earned the highest median weekly earnings, we see major dis­crepancies. Men working in the twenty occupations with the highest income earn significantly higher wages than women working in professions that pay them the higher income. Furthermore, the occupations that rank high for female earnings are not the so-called women's professions. The occupations in which women earn the most money 
are those that are male-dominated ­
operations and systems research and 
analysis, computer systems analysis, 
law, medicine, and dentistry. 
The causes of low incomes and 
poverty among women are fundamen­
tally different among men, black or 
white. The lives of the vast majority of 
women reflect a very different reality. 
There are societal expectations on all 
women that they fulfill the roles of 
caring for children, men, 
grandchildren and for elderly parents. 
It's these expectations which result in 
the lumping of women into care-giving 
jobs in the marketplace, for example. 
Even if they were initially valued more highly from a pay perspective, they would and are eventually lower paid as the sheer numbers of women now entering the work force drive wages lower and lower. It is the black women in their role as child rearers who are bearing the burden of the black male unemployment. 
All women, black or white, affluent or poor, are distinctly vulnerable to macroeconomic swings because of the roles assigned to them. To ask that so­ciety at least recognize this is a long way from laying blame for all the evils of the world on men.

done yet. "We needed _some­thing to campaign for." said Paul, "and Circus Lunch seemed like a good thing to do." 
As their Personals cam­paign picked up steam, and a February late night poster hanging caper took the campus by storm, support for the Circus Lunch grew and grew. Soon other signs appeared, signs not made by Paul or Joe. Personals started multiplying. "There was kind of a Circus Lunch subway alumni," said Paul. "People caught the fever." 

Soon people started as­king dining hall workers where the Circus Lunch had gone. According to Paul, no one he knows had actually demanded Circus Lunch. Little did Paul and Joe know that the Circus Lunch was coming to town again. "We had some real good staff reports on Circus Lunch," said Hickey. "Students tried one of everything." 
"Take Chinese New Year. Students liked the eggrolls, but they didn't like the chop suey or the chow mein. We learned from that." And so Circus Lunch, after a year's absence, was scheduled for March 30. 
Paul and Joe first got word from an Inside source on the Thursday night before the big event. They waited for official word, then celebrated with their room­mates and friends. A 'Circus Lunch countdown was started the night before, and phone calls were made to WVFI to publicize the big news. 
"It was a total surprise. We weren't really expecting It," said Joe. Since Paul and Joe had never met Hickey, there w.as no way to know.

Joe dressed up for the occa-·"\.. ',"'­sion. According to Joe, "The ·,, happy atmosphere, the clowns running around, the music playing is just great. 
And it's got a catchy title to it. Circus Lunch. I mean, it 
just sounds goodf" 
A dream was fulfllled. "I guess we had an ef­fect," said Joe. "Maybe in

the future we'll work towards establishing a permanent Circus Lunch. Maybe, we'd even have a Circus Lunch a week. 
"And 1 0 years down the road, who knows? Maybe we could have a really big Circus Lunch, kind of like JPW. All the alumni could come back and have Circus Lunch." 
How 'bout it, Mr. Hickey? "Well, not this year. We have too many picnics and things coming up, and the big Fis­her Regatta thing out by Holy Cross," he replied. 
Paul and Joe, at least for now, have no plans for other campaigns. "Circus Lunch was the one that was impor­tant," said Joe. "Everyone got a good meal out of it, and that's what counts." But both men have learned from their hard work. "Students can do things if enough people make enough of an effort, not just try one time and then give up." 
"On serious and important issues, if students persist, things could be done," he added.

Campus Band Publicity 
In lightofthe difficulties that campus bands have encountered in· their attempt to adver­tise themselves, and in response to Director of Student Activities Joe Cassidy's sugges­tion, The Accent department will introduce a new column next week as a service to the Notre Dame community. "The Downbeat" will present a listing of campus bands and where they will be playing each week. If you are a member of a campus band and wish to appear for free in The Observer, call Kendra Morrill at 283-3693 or bring the band's name and schedule to The Observer office. 
workshop will bring the volun­teers together to reflect on ser­vice and to share their experi­ences. Also, a 1-.3 credit theology course will fulflll their requirements. 
In 1980, the program began with only five projects and this year there will be approxi­mately 60. The goal Is to have each of the I 79 alumni clubs participate in the program. Cunningham said the future for the program is "continued growth." 
One of last year's partici­pants, Johanna Kelly, con­tinues to visit the shelter where she spent eight weeks teach­ing. learning, and "making friends." Kelly worked in Mic­higan City at a shelter workshop for the mentally and physically handicapped. Be­sides "teaching the adults basic living skills," she would also lead songs by playing her guitar. "It's a great experience," said Kelly, "and you end up receiving more from them than they do from you." In terms of rehibllitative medicine the ex­perience was also a "career direction" for Kelly who is studying pre-med. 
for Kelly, the fall workshop gave volunteers the chance to sum-up their projects. "(The seminar discussion) tied ser­vice to theology," sald Kelly, and "gave us the chance to discuss issues that arose in our projects--reflection is helpful." 
Mark Zeese, another volun­teer at the shelter workshop, described his work as "the best summer experience I've ever had." Zeese was a supervisor at the shelter and tutored the disabled in special learning groups. Working with the dis­abled was "a challenge" for Zeese who previously feared this type of tutoring. "I always wanted to help," said Zeese, "but I have never worked with the disabled." In addition to teaching the adults simple tasks such as sorting objects, Zeese was also "someone who could be their friend." The en­tire experience "Is a meaningful thing to do," said Zeese. 
Scott Lechner volunteered his summer in another part of the country, Wilmington, DE, not far from his Newark home. Lechner lived in the House of Joseph helping homeless men find employment. "I wanted to do something for others," said Lechner, "and (working at the home) gave me a chance to see the other side of society." Lechner helped the men by giving them his support talking with them, and sharing each other's viewpoints. 
Since the project Lechner is more understanding towards the unemployed and friendships. "Many of them don't have friends," said Lech­ner. "We don't know how lucky we are." The Summer Service Programs have many beneath­the-surface rewards. A price cannot be placed upon the friendships and memories of one such experience.

Successful managers lead employees with plenty of style 
Here are a few very successful managers, recently highlighted by "Success" magazine, for whom you might be lucky to work. 
The employees of Seagate, a computer parts man­ufacturer, seem like a very happy bunch. Their company's sales have doubled to $712 million in 1986, with profits of $90 million. 
The man behind this success is Tom Mitchell, 
Seagate's president. His personality is "manage­
ment by intimidation." An ex-Marine, he has a 
hand-grenade on his desk next to an office plaque 
which reads, "God I love war." He shouts out 
Marine slogans to his employees such as ''Take no 
prisoners." 

The slogans are only the beginning. To encourage 
an employee to sell more, Mitchell once jumped on 
the employee's desk and kicked the phone onto the 
floor. 

He also demands long hours. Every executive and 
engineer worked seven days a week for a month 
and were ordered to eat Thanksgiving dinner in the 
company cafeteria. It was all because Mitchell sold 
30,000 new disk drives before his company produced 
them. 

Obviously, the President's style pays off. Is it worth it to the employees? Well, each received two weeks bonus last quarter and their salaries led the industry. 
Brian Murray 
Business Manager 

Walmart is another successful company with an­other strong leader: Sam Walton. Walton, the ric­hest man in America, has built Walmart into the seventh largest retailer. 
Like Mitchell, Walton is a workaholic. He expects his managers to put in 50 hour weeks. But his ap­proach is a little bit different. Walton believes in his people, works with his people, and takes care of them with profit-sharing plans and bonuses. 
Walton's personal style is very unassuming. He drives a 1976 pickup and dresses in much the same way he did before he made more than $4 billion. 
When it comes to dealing with employees, whom he calls associates, he is very patient. Walton reg­ularly visits his stores and asks the lowest level employee for advice. His style is called "manage­ment by being nice." and it works. Walmart's sales 
are approactiing $7 billion, from only $44 million in 1971. 
Jim Benham runs Benham Capital Management Group, an investment firm. Last year, the 15-year­old firm managed more than $3 billion and had a mutual fund ranked in the top ten. 
During the day he works behind a dark oak desk surrounded by charts and graphs in a typical banker's office. But at night, the 51-year-old grabs his trumpet and moonlights as a jazz musician. He has played for club crowds of 150 or more. 
Resembling Steve Martin in the movie ''All of Me," the money manager-jazz musician loves music and applies it to business. He sights the team­work needed to play in a band and likens soloing to giving a speech. When you get to solo, he says, "it's your turn to wail." 
It is refreshing to hear a stale and conservative boss relate to bebop ... shades and all.

A limit on interest charged on credit cards has been estab­lished in the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wis­consin. Additionally, biparti­san support is growing in Congress for legislation to put a ceiling on credit card rates, and two bills have already been proposed. 
The credit card industry naturally is not going to take government regulation sitting down. A report in a Federal Reserve Bulletin has supplied the bankers their first round of ammunition. According to the report, consumers in states which regulate credit card in­terest rates tend to experience higher prices, stricter credit restrictions and shorter grace periods. 

None of these repercussions obviously are in the best inter­est of consumers. This is espe­cially true in the case of young and lower-income consumers who require easy credit. The issue which will be debated on Capitol Hill is whether these drawbacks are outweighed by the accompanying reduction in card interest rates. 
The great American institu­tion of plastic money is definitely undergoing a state of change. The result may be lower rates and special ser­vices, but they will be available to fewer people.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -Skies were dark but spirits were bright when the Syracuse bas­ketball team returned home Tuesday following a one-point loss to Indiana in the champi­onship game of the NCAA bas­ketball tournament. 
Manley Field House, Syracuse's basketball home until the Carrier Dome opened in 1980, was awash with orange --orange shirts, caps, posters, balloons and stickers proclaim­ing "Still No. 1." 
Signs proclaimed "You're No. 1 In Our Hearts -Thanks For A Great Season" and "We're Proud of You." 
Some 2,500 people showed up to welcome Syracuse, a 74-73 loser to Indiana in Monday night's title game. Keith Smart's jumper with five seconds left was the difference. 
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim received a two-minute ovation when he led the team into the building. 
"When you go through a night like last night, when the kids did everything we asked, you think about that basketball has to come down to winning and losing," Boeheim said. "But there were two great teams, and two great efforts, and you come down to it that you don't really have a loser in that type of game. 
"This reception means a lot to us. It takes an awful long time to recover from a game like this. This is a great, great first step and it helps get on track for Kansas City (site of the 1988 finals)." 
''This is the first time since we lost that I've been able to hold my head up and smile. Thank you," said co-captain Howard Triche, a senior and a Syracuse native. 

Knight 
continuedfrom page 20 
Basketball fans will have to wait until next year to find out if this is indeed a new Bob Knight. People don't want to be fooled by a "wolf in sheep's clothing." Many feel Knight's performance was good enough to go straight to the Oscars after the game. 
There are hordes of Bob Knight fans, while others pray for the day he leaves the coach­ing ranks. But all personality judgments aside, few people seem to argue with the fact that Knight is simply one of the finest coaches in the game.

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE, GIVE HOPE. 

NOTRE DAMEI ST. MARY'S Jrd. ANNUAL CHARITY BALL APRIL 4, 1987. * 9-2am.  S. DINING HALL 
Holtz, scored the game-winner 
from what would have been 
beyond the three point line at 
the ACC, and denied that he 
came in taking his opponents 
lightly. 
"Hey, they're a smart team 
-a very smart team," Stewart 
joked. "You can never over­
look any team that uses their 
heads as much as they do." 
Holtz, who was out of town 
for today's game, will compete 
with Verkler's for the 
remainder of the time they sur­
vive in the tournament. Con­
strictors team member Pat 
Lampton alleged that cowar­
dice was the Irish head coach's 
motive for missing the game. 
"Sure, Lou will take on Ala­
bama and Penn State," said a 
disgruntled Lampton. "But 
when a real challenge rolls 
'\round, he won't take on the 
Constrictors.'' 
Because of the immense 
number of teams in this year's 
tournament, the tradition of the 
Hall of Fame game as the sole 
contest on the first day of the 
tournament was broken in fa­
vor of playing some of the 
games in the preliminary 
round. In other action yester­
day, Gary Freeman of Death­
tounge scored all 21 of his 
team's points in a 21-1 drubbing 
of Grandpa and the Four Bad 
Touches. 
Also, Uncontrollable Flatulence from Hell nipped the Inside Traders, 21-18, be­hind Darren Mertz' 14 points and 20 rebounds. Dave Krus and Craig Pichatie, calling themselves Two on Five, played just that against the ever-popular Dripping Tas­manian Pig Snots, but the Snots blew out the duo, 21-7. 
Impressive showings were turned in by the Ball-Headed Freakdaddies, led by Irish ful­lbank Braxton Banks and Will Anderson's 9-of-14 shooting in a 21-9 thrashing of Gumby and Four Other Senior Bar Pa­trons. Five Guys From Carroll who Beat Dillon also beat Five Guys who Also Had No Idea What Reagan Said on Aug. 8 yesterday, behind Bobby Kloska's 6-of-10 shooting per­formance. And, in a battle that raged on for an astounding one hour and 23 minutes, Sheep Thrills sheared Largest Ag­bejemisin and the Smurfs From Hell by a score of 21-11. 
Team captain Steve Degroot blamed wind-chill tempera­tures in the teens for his squad's inability to score quickly, but he is anxious to see snow on the courts for his team's upcoming games. 
"We've practiced in the snow because we realize that we can only win if our opponents are at extreme disadvantages," said DeGroot. "We're dream­ing of a white Easter."

Associated Press 

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -The pep band had already been through its routine three or four times Tuesday when the celebrating Indiana fans began lobbing rolls of toilet paper over the scoreboards high above packed Assembly Hall floor. 
The NCAA champion Hoosiers' plane from New Or­leans was late, but no one really cared. The party started without them . 
"Hoo-siers, Hoo-siers," the crowd of about 15,000 chanted as they waited to greet the team that beat Syracuse 74-73 the previous night. 
Across the hall, draped im­pressively from the rafters, were the four giant red banners proclaiming Indiana's previ­ous NCAA basketball titles. A fifth -the third for Coach Bob Knight in 16 years at Indiana­will go next to the others. 
"I've had a chance to coach a lot of players and a lot of 
candidatPs are hard-hitting teams," Knight said to the sophomore George Streeter (44 crowd. "There's never been a tackles) and Yale transfer stu-team I've taken greater pride dent Pat Eilers. Forbes also in for what it has accom­pointed out that he is pleased plished~,

In five of the Hoosiers' six tourney victories, they had to battle from behind. Twice, they won by one point on baskets in the closing seconds, including Monday night's comeback from eight points down that was won on tourney MVP keith 
Smart's  jumper  with  five  
seconds to go.  
"Hopefully,  this  team  will  

show you when you've got prob­lems of your own, when things aren't going well for you, each of you can find a Keith Smart if you look around a little bit to help you," Knight said. 
But Knight's philosophy for success wasn't what the screaming fans, many of whom had been waiting more than three hours, had come to hear. 
They wanted their heroes. And they gave them a heroes' welcome as they climbed a platform with a sea of red at their feet. 
"Weren't there any classes today?'' joked reserve forward Todd Meier, one of the team's three seniors. Then he pointed 
across the vast arena to the four NCAA banners and said, "I'm really proud because we came back here and put an­other banner down there."

Weather stops Irish baseball again, to meet Valparaiso at home today 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 

. The South Bend weather gods must not be fans of Notre Dame baseball. 
After having one game rained out last week, and a game called for darkness last weekend, the Notre Dame baseball team had yesterday's game with Bethel postponed because of cold weather. The wind chill factor around Jake Kline Field yesterday hovered around 5 degrees, according to Irish head coach Larry Gallo. 
Weather permitting, Notre Dame will face Valparaiso at 
2:30 p.m. today at Jake Kline Field, and will continue its home stand tomorrow at 2 p.m. against Bethel. 
"The main thing we have to do is play consistently, and that's tough to do when you don't play that much," said Gallo. "Right now we're playing on weekends and vaca­tions it seems. I felt we had es­tablished some momentum in Texas, and we come back and get the rainout. It's still March, and the weather won't be like this forever." 
The Irish won six of ten games in Texas over spring break, then lost two of three games last week. Notre Dame's current record is 7-9. 
While Notre Dame is having a tough time completing its schedule of games, Valparaiso already has almost 30 games under its belt. The Crusaders, who stand at 16-11-2, have been led by third baseman Dale Polonus, with a .360 batting average, six home runs, and 28 runs batted in. 
Valparaiso has also received solid pitching from today's scheduled starter, Shawn Barker. In his freshman season, Barker has a 2-2 record with a 1.88 earned run average. 
"Their coach, Rich Ferchen, has done an excellent job during the years he's been there," said Gallo. "They have a scrappy bunch of players, and they play a pretty compet­itive schedule.'' 
The Irish plan to start fresh­man Mike Coffey today. Coffey had a successful fall season,

defeated the crowd-pleasing 
Esophagus Contrictors, 21-6. 
The Esophagus Constrictors kept the crowd of 300-plus laughing throughout the one­sided game with several humorous antics. They rushed onto the court wearing taped glasses and sporting their GPA's on the back of their jer­seys (3.9, 3.9, 3.97, 4.0 and 4.0) as the Notre Dame Victory March blared in the back­ground. Team warmups kept the crowd chuckling as the Con­strictors threw up several bricks and used the free time to study their books. 
The Constrictors used several mixing defenses to try to confuse the Verkler Con­struction team, including their Ghandi defense of passive re­sistance, during which they fell to the court and watched as Dolan easily dropped in a layup. They also used a box­and-one defense, as four players held a box in the middle of the lane and one defender chased the ball, and a double­Dolan defense with one player on another's shoulders, swat­ting shots as they reached the hoop. 
"We wanted to cut the game short because we had a lot of studying to do, otherwise we would have displayed a lot more talent than we did," said Tony Lanza, who donned a No. 7 jersev with "Beuerlein" on convert a half-court shot which they tried to calculate through wind velocity and the position­ing of the court on the Earth. In previous years they have been successful with that shot. 

"We have made that 95 per­cent of the time," said Lanza. 
"We missed it because of  a  
lunar  miscalculation.  It's  a  
very scientific procedure."  

Tournament Commisioner Steve Wenc was pleased with the strong crowd turnout and results of the Hall of Fame game. 
"I thought they put on a fan­tastic show," said Wenc. "That's what the Hall of Fame game is there for -to get every­one in the right mood for the tournament and to start it all off on the right foot." 
Dolan, admittedly kept off­balance by the Constrictors' antics, praised his teammates for keeping their concentration while preserving the win. 
"They (the Constrictors) came in with a game plan and they stuck with it," said Dolan. "If not for the tenacious play of Chuck Glen, Chris Stiles, and George (Stewart, tight end coach for the Notre Dame foot­ball team), today's outcome might have been quite differ­
ent." Stewart, filling in for Notre Dame head football coach Lou

Spring reshuffling gives secondary promising outlook for next fall 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Head Coach Lou Holtz strolled off the practice fields and into the ACC a full 15 minutes earlier. The rest of the team had run to the showers about five minutes after him. 
All but the secondary. 
Spring Football '87 
The defensive backs were still out on the field for a little extra work on some of their formations after Monday's spring football workout. And they didn't seem to mind. 
"We're just looking to get better in all areas," said second-year Irish secondary coach Terry Forbes. "If petition in every position,'' Forbes said. "Every spot is wide open as of now, and we're judging by performance as to who will be playing -not by last year's playing time, number of years played or anything else. 

"We will go out of the spring with a first unit, but you never know what can happen between now and then. There are sure some real battles going on, and that makes everyone work that much harder." 
Another motivating factor in the hard work to this point has been the learning of new posi­tions on the part of players who have been juggled at different slots in the backfield.

Indiana's Knight put on a new face for the Final Four 
The Indiana Hoosiers sit atop the college basket­ball world. As a result of Monday night's one-point victory over Syracuse, the Hoosiers hold bragging rights until next year's championship game, however painful that may be for everyone else. 
But the title game, and the semifinal game for that matter, featured a different look from the In­diana side from what most basketball fans are ac­customed to. The team won in its usual disciplined, though more up-tempo than normal, manner. The team was familiar to those in years past, even though the players constantly change. 
While it seemed to be the same old Hoosiers on the court, there was a big difference off the court. Bob Knight, the maniac with the uncontrollable temper, the flinger of furniture, the head of the referees' Most Feared list and the perfectionist-to­a-fault head coach of Indiana University's basket­ball team was not this man we had come to know and hate at all. He was downright polite. 
In the words of David Letterman, "Hard to believe, isn't it?" 
This must be some hoax. This calm coach, THE Bob Knight, is the same guy who threw a chair across the floor not so long ago against Purdue. Do quiet, polite coaches do that? He also is the same guy who set United States-Pan American relations back a few years with his antics in "friendly com­petition." This is the wildman featured in the book, "A Season On the Brink," by John Feinstein. This is the same coach whose press conference following a win over Northwestern this season sounded like Morse Code, with as many beeps as words. It just can't be HIM. 
But alas, the evidence is piling up. After all, Knight's team won the national championship. A look back will uncover two previous national titles

under his direction. His teams are tough all right. 
And after all, Knight has not been a total saint this year. He has consistently voiced his opposition to the three-point shot, and not too subtly. This, although he coached one of the nation's biggest benefactors of the rule, Steve Alford. 
He has been less-than-hospitable to Feinstein, be­cause he felt the novel focused too much on Knight instead of the team, and kept too much of his lan­guage in its original form. 
He has constantly jabbed at sports writers, knock­ing their qualifications on a regular basis. Of course, Knight himself stooped enough to write a column during the tournament. 
Knight was even a bit rude earlier in this year's tournament. He had few kind words for the officials and opposing players in Indiana game against Auburn. 
His biggest tirade, however, came in the Midwest Regional final against LSU. He received a technical when he stormed on the court, but he was not through yet. He complained to the NCAA Tourna­ment Committee members on press row and slammed the . telephone stationed directly in front of Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Corrigan . Despite his claims, it is doubtful he was com­plimenting Corrigan on the job Lou Holtz has done with the Irish football team. 
But then in New Orleans, Knight was quite dif­ferent. He was subdued on the bench, saving both players and officials from his wrath. This quiet ver­sion of college basketball's answer to John McEnroe drew nearly as much attention through his silence as he did through his feverish arguments. It was scary. 
But now questions remain. When he was a beast, everyone called him just that, and quite plainly. Is he trying to change ~hat image? Was the change from plaid jacket to red sweater just the beginning of his changes?

Let's·be practical and 'fix' all our moral dilemmas 
My, the Roaming Catholic Church seems to be having problems lately. All those Catholics using birth control devices that aren't approved by His Holeyness Pop Johnnie II. Some of them are even doing strange things with test tubes and babies, if they aren't killing them off with vacuums or coat hangers. And now AIDS is rumored to be hitting the priesthood. 
Solution: Castration. 
It really makes sense, from the Roaming Catholic viewpoint. The castration option will pretty much eliminate sex. No more people doing naughty things in bed. No more sodomy. No more breaking the seventh commandment. There may be a subsequent problem with les­bianism, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
Abortion, the fighting front of the Church bat­tle these days, will also cease to exist. Since abortion is the result of unplanned conception, and unplanned conception is generally the result of unplanned sex, it logically follows that if we do away with sex, we do away with abor­tion. And, since castration would eliminate the tools needed for sexual intercourse, then obvi­ously it would do away with abortions as well. Amazing how powerful logic is, isn't it? 
Mandatory castration would also put all those nasty contraceptive companies out of business. No more embarrassing advertisements offend­ing decent families throughout the world. 
The declining trend in the numbers of men entering the priesthood will be reversed, too. Once we put a stop to the illicit and morally corrupt entertainments of the outside world, the joys of serving God might seem a bit more attractive to young men. 
The horrid practice of prostitution would be ended as well. No sex, no prositution. It's that simple. 
Male homosexuality would be stopped dead in its tracks. Now the Church wouldn't have to worry about these misguided souls going to Hell. It could quit wasting time denouncing them to the skies as satanic and warped.

In a blatant attempt to turn a fast buck, Notre Dame bas­ketball coach Digger Phlops resigned his job and opened a jeans store. 
According to Phlops, the high cost of dry cleaning was a major factor in his decision. 
"If you look at the tapes of my old Fordham team," barked Phlops, "all I did was wear jeans. Trying to stay in the latest fashion was very, very difficult, especially when I kept tearing all my $500 jack­ets. Trying to keep them clean was also a negative.
