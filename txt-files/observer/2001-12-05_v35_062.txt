Victim lectures on date rape 
. Nationally-renowned speaker shares story 
By KATE RAND 
Nc-ws Writer 
Katie Koestner was just like every other student in the room during her freshman orientation at the College of William and Mary. She had spent the last few days meeting new people and finding her way around campus, and was partially enjoy­ing the movie "Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail" when she spotted a guy who she now describes as "straight out of GQ magazine." The two became friends and saw each other for the next few weeks to study chemistry. 
"We were not dating, not hooking up. We were hanging out. It's a very technical term," said Koestner, \\ho gave a lecture entitled "No-Yes" at Saint Mary's Tuesday about her experience as a sexual assault victim. 
The pair eventually decided to go on a real date to a French restaurant. but while the evening began like a dream, it ended like a nightmare. According to Koestner, her fancy evening out with "Prince Charming" ended when he raped her in her own bedroom. 
The first thing Koestner realized was that her 'friend' was 60 or 70 pounds heavier than she was, and that she could not move her legs out from under him even if she tried. He began kiss­ing her and with one hand pinned her arms above her head. She asked what he was doing, and he responded "nothing," and told her that"everything would be fine if she would just relax and stop thinking so much. 
According to Koestner, she eventually got him to stop, and he slept for five hours while she sat ner­vously in the corner pressed against the wall. When he awoke, he took advantage of her scared, sleep-deprived state and raped her. Koestner did not flail her arms around, but rather kept them, tight fisted, crossed against her body. She pressed

·oARTing becomes 
Web-based 
By KE\ilN SUHANIC 
News ~Iriter 
In an effort to make DARTing more convenient, the Office of the Registrar implemented web­based class registration for the first time this semester. 
Most students like the new sys­tem. Rather than dialing in to already congested phone lines or trudging over to the Main Building, senior Sean McCarthy was able to register as he ate lunch in his apartment. 
"I don't know why we didn't have this before," he said. 
University Registrar Harold Pace shared in students' enthusi­asm. 
"We have been really happy with Web registration, and we hope th~ students have too," he said. 
He added that the best compli­ment his office could get was that "[students] just started using it." 
Using the system without time­consuming training was a key element to implementing Web registration, and the Registrar's office feels they have accom­plished this goal. 
McCarthy agreed with the Registrar's Office. "DARTing was pretty much the same as past years; but I didn't

Welch: Values build a winning team 
. Former GE CEO says family, growth and winning form successful business philosophy 
By NORREN GILLESPIE 
News Wricer 
Jack Welch knows the game. 
During his tenure at General Electric as chairman and CEO, Welch set three priorities. for himself and the corporation in the game of business: create a family atmosphere, make growth a priority, and always, always win. 
His strategy was so successful that it catapult­ed General Electric -and Welch -to become one of the most respected business leaders in corporate America during his term from 1981 to 2001. 
His philosophy was so well received among a standing-room-only crowd in Jordan Auditorium Tuesday night that Welch even received a job offer to work here in South Bend. 
"Do you have any head football coaching experience?" one MBA student asked Welch jokingly. 
Welch suggested Jon Gruden as a better alternative, but turned the joke into an opportu­nity to tell the Mendoza College of Business that running a business isn't that much different from spqrts -it's a game. The teams with the best players and the most drive win, and win­ning is the objective, according to Welch. 
"I think this whole game of business is no dn­ferent of a game than the game you play across .the street," Welch said. 
Welch emphasized player development in business leadership. This is accomplished only by having a clear set of values and treating each person individually, he said. 
"Every person should be treated fairly in an organization, but every person should be treat­ed differently in an organization." Welch said. 
Welch earned both praise and criticism dur­ing his term at General Electric. GE spent more than $20 billion on new acquisitions, including the purchase of the National Broadcasting Company, RCA and the Kidder Peabody & Co brokerage firm. While he earned some enemies

INSIDE COLUMN 

It is in giving 

It's that time of the year again. Thanksgiving has come and gone. The Christmas lights are up. The shopping sprees have begun. Finals, papers and projects plague students as the winter holidays approach. In the midst of it all, we somehow have to make 
things work. 
One thing that has helped me get through times like this is tradition. Before you think I'm going to go on and on about Notre Dame tradi­tion, J'm not. Notre Dame's tradition is great. Although there are many wonderful 


activities at Notre Dame in  
the coming Christmas sea- Angela Campos  
son, they are not tradition  
for me.  
Christmas time is when  Lab Tech  
my brothers. my sister and  
I get togetlrnr and practice  
our music for the prelude to  

the children's Mass. We sing Christmas carols and watch tho Nativity pageant performance. 
For me, Christmas tradition is making cook­ies with my brothers, sister and my parents. We mix lhem from scratch and bake them until the house smells like a confectionary. Christmas means going out and picking a tree together, putting up lights around the house and putting up all the pieces of artwork that we've made dating back to preschool. We roll piecrusts for pumpkin, apple and cream pies. We sit together around the table spreading tamales. 
Part of that tradition includes giving. My fam­ily makes tamales at Christmas. My mother and father have practiced this since before they were married. We've always left a glass of milk, a plate of cookies and a plate of tamales for Santa. And while we make some tamales for us to eat ourselves, we make most of them to give to friends of the family as Christmas gifts. 
So this year. I wanted to bring some of my family tradition to Notre Dame, because it just didn't seem like the holidays until I got home and wanted to change that. So I made tamales for some of my friends. Not only has that helped me to get more into the spirit of the upcoming holidays, it also provided me with an outlet for all of the hustle and bustle of finals. 
We are all busy at this time of the year. Time is of the essence. Find something to make it easier, to help you through it. Make the most of your time. Enjoy the rare, warm December days in South Bend. 
Then give something to someone. Give a coat to St. Vincent de Paul, canned food to the Center for the Homeless or socks to the /\ED sock drive. Give gifts to your friends. Not all gifts come with a price tag. 
I don't know what your family traditions are. I don't know bow you celebrate the holidays. But however you do, in whatever way, share that spirit with your classmates, your room­mates, your teachers and your friends. 
I wish you the best of luck on your final exams, safe travel home and back again, and a fun, relaxing holiday. 
Merry Christmas.

Brown grad investigated for having Anthrax

Tomas Fiwal ·99 did nothing out of the ordinary when he placed two vials of anthrax he found in a UnivPrsity of Connecticut laboratory in his personal freezer, said Kirklyn Kerr. 
Kerr, tlrn University of Connecticut Dean of the School ofAgriculture and Natural Hesources, said. "Graduate students, and faculty for that matter, put samples away in case they need them for future grants and that sort of thing."

Those who knew Foral as an undergraduate at Brown were sur­prised to hear he was under govern­ment scrutiny. 
'Tm stunn~id," said Tad Heuer '99, who roomed with Fora! for three years at Brown and is now studying in England as a Marshall Scholar. "I bolievc that a lot of this is just the unfortunate coincidence of' Tomas having kept a. vial of something that happens to be the cause of a very large public scare at the moment." 
Heuer d(iscribod Foral as a "very studious person," methodical and conscientious in whatever he did. He said he saw Foral's storing the vials in line with his interest in animal dis­eases, including West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis, samples of which Fora! also kept in his freez­er.

MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY 
Mid East attacks polarize campus 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel over the weekend followed by retaliatory Israeli missile strikes on Gaza City Monday have once again polarized seg­ments of the University of Michigan community over the latest bedlam in the 53-year conflict between lsrael and the Palestinians. "Every time one of these things happens, it's supposed to remind us we're all on opposite sides. Instead, it distracts from how many Israelis and Palestinians love one another and are friends with one another," said Rackham student Greg Epstein, president of Humanistic Iluvarab, a student organization dedicated to the values ol' Jewish culture. Americans, who now have more of' an understanding about what it's like to experience such horrific devas­tation at home. are witnessing the biggest flare-up or violence in the Middle East since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Some students said this could prompt more of a bias against Palestinians.

GSU lobbies for new handbook 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 
The Graduate Student Union plans to work with representatives from the MBA program and law school to draft a graduate student handbook, replacing the current graduate and undergracluate du Lac rulebook. 
Members of GSU. law and MBA programs met with Bill Kirk. director of Residence !Jfe. Jeff Shoup, director of Residence Life and Housing and James Powell, dean of the Graduate School to discuss the need for a handbook of rules applicable only to gradu­ate students. 
"We don't want to be treated as kids," Kishori Deshpande, GSU vice-president, said. "We're all adults and we know how to behave in situations." 
The idea to create a separate graduate student handbook arose from GSU concerns over the tailgating policy. first brought up by Tracy Kijewski-Correa. Notre Dame Security/Police enforced du Lac's tailgating rule and some graduate, MBA and law stu­dents were cited although they were oflegal


-----------------------------------------------7 drinking age. 
The committee's purpose is to evaluate what rules should refer to graduate students and place them in a separate handbook to avoid future confusion. 
"There are many instances where du Lac doesn't apply to grad students," said Gabriela Burgos, GSU president. 
GSU hopes to assist in forming the committee as sooh as possi­ble. 
In other GSU news: 
. 
The GSU Information Technology Committee has reached an agreement with OIT over paper allowances at University computer clusters. OIT initially allotted each gradu­ate student 1000 sheets per year -identical to the undergraduate amount. OIT has now agreed to extend that allowance to a maxi­m um of 3000 sheets for the remainder of the school year. 

. 
Suzann Gallagher will not return to her position as GSU elections, credentials and proce­dures secretary. Gallagher has decided to take a leave of absence, citing personal and family reasons. 


"I want to thank everyone for the help this semester," she said during the Tuesday night meet­ing.

FACULTY SENATE 
Group recommends more power 
By JASON McFARLEY News Editor 
Should a measure by the Faculty Senate win support of University offi­cials. faculty who want to serve on Notre Dame's most powerful academic body may have to go through the senate first. 
The senate on Tuesday took an ambi­tious step to give it'lelf that authority, lay­ing out a plan to align the group more closely with the Academic Council, the chief governing body of the Urtiversity's educational affairs. 
At a meeting that ran past two hours, senators passed along to a joint commit­tee of the senate and Academic Council their recommendation to consider two actions that would shift power between the groups: 
. 
The senate would elect the 20 elect­ed facuttv members of the Academic Council from among sitting senat9rs. 

. 
The senate's five executive officers would be Academic Council members, increasing by four the current number of faculty members of the council. The move would increase faculty composition of the council to 54 percent, with admin­istrators holding the remainder of seats. 


"We saw it as a significant detail in increasing the power and importance of faculty in the governance of the Universitv," said Michael Zuckert, vice chair ofthe senate. 
The proposals were part of the sen ate's most aggressive strategy to date to restructurn itself. The effort to gain more formal power has concerned the group since senators considered disbanding in May, citing disinterest among faculty and lack of respect from administrators as rea'ions for dissolving the group. 
The senate lacked authority to vote itself out of existence eight months ago. Changes to the senate require approval of the Academic Council, University President Father Edward Malloy and the Hoard ofTrustees. 
01anges senators considered Tuesday would need approval of the very body that the senate would take power from -the Academic Council. 
"This will have to be approved," said senate chair Jacqueline Brogan, "but that's been our agenda this fall ... to take it to the Academic Council to recommend that changes be made." 
Before the full council votes on the proposals, however, tl1e joint committee of five senators and four council mem­bers will examine the changes' potential . for approval. The committee essentially acts as a mediary between the two groups and serves as a gauge for the senate to measure how much support its efforts will find in the full council. 
"I think it's a sensible way to proceed," said Valerie Sayers, an English profes­sor. "We're operating with two bodies, one of which has no power and one of which has all the power." 
In other senate news: 
. 
Stuart Greene, of the University Writing Program, agreed to be the facul­ty representative to the Student Senate. 

. 
Members approved the nomination of Lionel Jensen, chair of the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department, to be chair of the senate's Administration Committee. 

. 
Senate officers agreed last week to begin meeting with deans· of the University's colleges to discuss changes to the group, Brogan said. The officers expected to meet today with College of Arts & Letters Dean Mark Roche and College of Engineering Dean Frank Incropera. Meetings with other deans will take place in January, Brogan said.

Rape 
continued from page 1 
her legs together and bit a chunk of skin out of her cheek, wWch she later used as evidence in her trial. vVhen it was all over her assailant walked out of the room and said "Thank you." 
After the rape, Koestner told her R.A., who took her to health services 32 hours after it occurred. The nurse there did nothing but tell her to gel. some sleep, even though evidence can be collected up to 72 hours after­wards. She then went to the dean of students who told her to "think about it." 
Finally campus police helped Koestner, leading to an eventual trial. Her assailant was found guilty after admit­ting that she had said no a dozen times. 
"Some people don't understand tT1e meaning of no, even when you've said it a dozen times," Koestner said. "I learned that the hard way." 
Koestner has managed to turn the worst night of her life into a positive experience. Speaking at colleges, high schools, and military bases across the country in the years since the tragedy has helped strengthen Koestner as an individual and has also strengthened tile huge audi­ences who attend each lecture. 
After the attack, Koestner earned national recognition as the first victim to publicly speak about rape. She appeared on the June 3, 1991 cover of TIME Magazine and has appeared on Larry King Live, Oprah, NBC Nightly News, MlV and Good Morning America. In 1993, she worked with HBO to make the docu-drama "No Visible Bruises: The Katie Koestner Story." She has pre­sented her program over 1,000 times .to more than 700 institutions nation wide. 
Koestner acknowledged that most women in the audi­once had probably been informed aboul. date rape statistics at some point, hut that they most likely did not know all the facts, and probably had a two dimensional idea of the sit­uation. 
While Koestner said that she "hates statistics," she shared a few with the group. According to Koestner, 84 percent of the time rape occurs, the victim knows the assailant. 
"Nobody told me that when I was 18," Koestner said. "Date rape didn't exist then, not until my photo was on the cover of Time." 
Koestner reported more statistics which revealed that 98 percent of the time drugs or alcohol are involved in sexual assaults. One out of four women and one out of eight men are raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Approximately every 20 minutes someone in the United States is raped. 
"All I want is one day without rape," said Koestner. 
Three main points Koestner stressed during the lecture were that rape is defined as sexual intercourse without effective consent, silence does not constitute effective con­sent. and a person incapacitated by alcohol cannot pro­vide effective consent to have sex. 
"Five years ago, the definition of rape was physical force," Koestner said. "In 2001 rape is sex without effec­tive consent." 
Koestner said that it is very hard to publicly share her story. 
"I don't regret it, ever. I could have been a chemical engineer, but I don't think I would have such a positive effect on people every day if that's what I was doing," Koestner said. "It's hard though; it's emotionally drain­ing." 
When asked how she .draws strength from public speaking, Koestner told the audience that she is a very determined person, who is very single minded about achieving her goals. 
"When you hit rock bottom, there is nowhere to go but up," she said.

even have to leave my apartment," McCarthy said. 
That is part of the flexibility of the new system; students can register from computer clusters, their dorm rooms or 
even from their homes over winter break. 
However, the new system has had a few quirks when students use a brows­er other than Netscape 4.75. 
"One small issue was currently being resolved," said Pamela Johnson, Senior Assistant Registrar. "But it only affect­ed a few people." 
She also advised students to use 
Netscape version 4.75 to avoid any potential problems. 
"Internet Explorer with a security setting on high does not allow cookies," which leads to problems Johnson said. 
The Registrar's office has had few problems with students not under­standing the system. However, accord­ing to Pace, surprisingly there were no freshmen in the Registrar's office dur­ing their first day of DARTing. 
Overall, the new system has been get­ting almost exclusively positive reviews. 
"It seems like DARTing this year was the best it has been so far. It was sim­ple, easy and quick," McCarthy said.

for what were perceived as tough and ruthless business tac­ti cs, GE's market value increased from $16 billion to more than $280 billion under his leadership. He consolidated 150 business units into 12 basic businesses in what he called a "boundary-less" organization to create a corporation that had "a big company body and a small company soul." 
ft was the shared set of values and a family atmosphere that played the biggest role in the game of success, Welch said. 
While Welch was bringing GE to the forefront of corporate cul­ture, he was also careful to make sure the corporation was a player in the community. Welch was seeing the big pic­ture when he instituted l.nner­city education programs and other community efforts nation­wide. 
"Do you think those dot-corns that didn't win were teaching in the inner-cities? Losers can't contribute to society ... they're too focused on their ovrn jobs," Welch said. 
An effective business leader makes it clear that company values are in place from the top­down. and institul.es programs that adhere to those values, he said. If there are members of the team that don't believe in those values, they have to be let go, he said. 
"One thing, you have to pray as you go out every night that [the values are] there," Welch said. "You worry most about somebody doing something stu­pid. We police it ... and when we find it, we don't let them go qui etly. We don't say they left GE for personal reasons -we say they didn't agree with the val­ues of the company." 
While values allow an organi­zation to win the game, it's also important to celebrate the little victories along the way to suc­cess. Allowing a team to cele­brate its achievements moti­vates and builds a better team, according to Welch. 
"Great teams are about work­ing together, liking each other, wanting to win, and partying like hell when it's over," Welch said. "It's so critical to an insti­tution -it brings it alive, gives it character. People feel guilty about stopping to celebrate a lit­tle victory ... but it lets people know they've won." 
A Catholic himself, Welch also said that it is possible to com­bine Catholic ethics in business culture. It's business that is at the heart of everything -and there are good people running it. 
"I have found more bad peo­ple in federal and state govern­ment than I have ever seen in business," he said. "Business is played by some of the best peo­ple in the world."

G.E. ordered to clean Up Hudson 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The Environmental Protection Agency reiterated today its order that the General Electric Company remove hundreds of tons of poiso­nous chemicals from the Hudson River in New York. 
"We are going forward with this important cleanup," Christie Whitman, the agency's administra­tor, said this afternoon. 
The announcement that the 
E.P.A. would not alter its original order of Aug. 1 was certain to please environmentalists, who had expressed fears in recent weeks that the Bush administration might be too friendly to G.E. and might adjust the order to make it easier for G.E. to meet. 
General Electric discharged many tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, from plants on the upper Hudson for more than 35 years, before the government banned the chemical in 1977. PCB's have been linked to cancer in animal tests, and a stretch of river nearly 200 miles long was placed on the federal Superfund

Marine commanders here have declined to dis­cuss their future opera­tional plans, but Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said the force here was intended to put pressure on the remaining Taliban forces, blocking escape routes and interdicting them if they move.

For a quarter of a century. the river contamination has spawned lawsuits, disputes between G.E. and environmentalists and argu­ments over how best to proceed with a cleanup. 
G.E. has long resisted dredging of tainted river bottom, contend­ing that it would do more harm than good. The company says that it has spent some $200 million in research and restoration efforts over the last two decades, and that in any event the river shows signs of rejuvenating itself.

Asociated P rcss 
FOHT CAMPBELL, Ky. 

Three servicemen injured in an explosion inside an ancient Afghan fortress said Tuesday they hope to return as soon as possible to the war on terror­ism. 
At a news conference, the men praised northern alliance fighters and said they trusted them to help after the explo sion. 
"They're our friends, and they're going to take care of us," said Paul, a 30-year-old Army captain from suburban Chicago who is a member of the 5th Special Forces Group. 
Citing security concerns. military officials declined to give full names for the wound­ed servicemen. 
Five servicemen were injured during an uprising by Taliban prisoners at the fortress outside the city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Two did not 
attend the news con­fer c n c e because of t h e i r injuries.

All received the Purple Heart. The CJA agent, Johnny "Mike" Spann, was killed by rioting prisoners, becoming the first known U.S. combat casualty in Afghanistan. 
Before the uprising, the men said they lived at times in caves, rarely bathed and sometimes went hungry. They said they believe in their cause. especially after witnessing the transforma­tion of Mazar-e-Sharif once the Taliban fled.

Israeli fore es strike Arafat compound 
Associated Press 
RAMALLAH 
Bodyguards whisked Yasser Arafat into an underground bunker at the sight of Israeli attack helicopters approa­ching his 
C O ffi ­pound Tuesday. 
S e ­c o n d s l a t e r when the missiles struck ­

a few Arafat d oz e n yards from where he had been sitting -the Palestinian leader was safely hidden away with advisers and body­guards in a windowless underground office. "You should not forget that Arafat is a fighter," said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, secre tary general of the Palestinian Cabinet, who stayed in the shelter with him. "He was very quiet. ... Although he was very sur­prised, he did not stop giving directions.... We took all the natural measures that we used to take when we were in Lebanon." Rahman said Arafat ordered employees of the compound to evacuate, keep­ing only his personal body­guards. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government said it was not trying to harm Arafat personally, but wanted to send a stern warning to crack down on militants. "The purpose was to send a clear military message .... 'Friends. we've had enough, take the responsibility that you have and stop the terror­ism,"' said the Israeli army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey. Sharon did not comment Tuesday, but in a 1V address Monday he blamed Arafat for 
attacks on Israelis 
Arafat is no less than "the main impediment to peace and stability in the Mid die East. Arafat has chosen the path of terror (to) try to make diplomatic gains through murder," he said. 
With troops sealing off the 
West Bank and Gaza, the 
Palestinian leader has been 
left a virtual prisoner in 
Ramallah. 
The tactic further compli­
cates Arafat's daunting task 
-confronting and control­
ling increasingly popular 
Islamic militants when he has 
little to offer his people in 
return. 
When he emerged from his shelter, Arafat angrily accused Israel of trying to sabotage his crackdown on Islamic militants, which Israel dismisses as a sham. 
The Israelis "don't want me to succeed and for this (Prime Minister Ariel Sharon) is esca­lating his military activities against our people, against our towns, against our cities, against our establishments," Arafat said. "He doesn't want a peace process to start." 
The Palestinian Authority has rounded up some 130 members of the militant Islamic Jihad and Hamas groups in response to week­end suicide bombings and shootings in Israel that killed 26 people. Jibril Rajoub, Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, said arrests would continue, although none have been made since the Israeli airstrikes began Monday. 
"How can we take mea­sures in order to control the situation when all our institu­tions are being targeted?" asked Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo. "The security offices and even our jails have been threat­ened. How can we control the situation?" 
The attacks are the latest chapter of Israel's up-and­down relationship with Arafat, who was exiled from Palestinian territory in the late 1960s. 
When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, Sharon, then Israel's defense minister, repeatedly targeted Arafat, who was in Beirut with his PLO fighters. Arafat was once even in an Israeli sniper's crosshairs, according to reports, but the man hesitat­ed to shoot. 
"It's hard to put into words the conditions that these soldiers (in the northern alliance) are facing. The lack ofequipment. The lack ofcold weather clothing. And the fact is they continue to fight."

Holy Cross College deserves recognition 
I am writing to commend The Observer and its staff on a job well done. In the Dec. 4 edition, Holy Cross College was finally given the recognition it deserves among the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community of which it is already a mem­ber. However, too often, it is forced to be a silent member. Perhaps because of its small size. it is not given adequate recognition in The Observer and the rest of the ND/SMC community. Yet. finally, it has been. Putting the story of HCC pos­sibly offering a 4-year degree in the future on your front page is big news for both Holy Cross and the rest of the communi­ty. Holy Cross College has given many past and current Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students their start, including myself. The Brothers of Holy Cross created a unique environment 35 years ago, and its well-respected reputation continues to this day. The small. close "family" a student experiences at Holy Cross provides them with the experiences they need to contin­ue on successfully at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or any other four-year institution. 
Though Holy Cross will remain at its core a two-year. transfer-intent institution. the addition of a four-year degree is exciting. I know the admissions team at Holy Cross College has worked long and hard to increase enrollment at Holy Cross College and has thus far been extremely successful. I wish them continued success in this new challenge and am confident they will meet their goals. 
And again, to The Observer staff, thank you for shining a long overdue light on a school that is an important asset to our community. I only hope that such coverage of Holy Cross College will be included in your "beats" in the future.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

As Coach Davie and consequently the rest of the Notre Dame coaching staff is released from the University, let us please not forget to treat these men with the respect they deserve as not only people, but also as members of the Notre Dame family. 
For the past year and a half, I have been blessed with the opportunity to work with this outstanding group of men. They have through time become my surrogate fathers and big brothers, my mentors. and my inspiration. I have finally found a job that I love going to every day. This semester has been the hardest of my life as I have been confronted by many of the difficulties that life throws at us some­times. No matter how bad my day was, going to work always put me in a great mood. It was there that I felt the sense of the Notre Dame spirit the strongest. I don't know how I ever could have gotten through the past few months without them. The coaches always took time out to talk to me could always make me laugh. 
These are truly amazing men with incredible hearts. They love Notre Dame and everything for which it stands. They have put in long hours, often arriving well before 8 a.m. and sometimes not leaving until midnight, just tb try to develop the team to its full potential and give you the team that many of you claim you "deserve." They strive to balance their jobs and families, while never relinquishing their absolute passion and love for the game itself. 
Please keep in mind the incredible sacrifices the entire coaching staff has made and the enormous pressure that has been placed upon them before laying harsh criticisms upon them. These amazing men have been such an inspiration to me and all who have been blessed to have worked with them. 
To those men, thank you for everything you have taught me, good luck to you as you move on from Notre Dame, and may God bless you and your families.

Davie did not have Irish attitude 
While I believe that Bob Davie brought some positives to the Notre Dame football program, such as a high team GPA and graduation rate, we should applaud the message that Kevin White sent to the Notre Dame community by letting Davie go on Sunday. The problem was not Bob Davie's lack of knowledge for the game, or his effort. The problem was attitude, and I don't believe that Bob Davie has the type of attitude that has always propelled Notre Dame to success. 
First, Davie's pessimistic attitude brings down our players. I am sick of hearing how our team isn't explosive so we can't throw the ball, or that teams like Navy and Boston College are college football powerhouses. As Davie states before playing winless Navy. "This game, because of who we arc playing, is a game that every year is going to be a challenge." Is he talking about Navy, the team that we have beaten 38 years in a row? We arc never going to defeat college football powerhouses like Nebraska and Tennesse if we have the atti­tude that a team like Navy is superior to us. Bob Davie seems scared to play even the worst teams -similar to how our offense is scared to throw the ball or be aggressive. Maybe that's why playing a win­less Navy team becomes a showdown, instead of a joke. 
Second, Davie's attitude on the field doesn't instill confidence in his players. I can.recall the first game of the year when the hopes and dreams of a national championship were still high. Yes, Terrence Howard, the starter, fumbled on the first play from scrimmage, but is that a good reason to bench him for most of the game. How can play­ers play with freedom and enthusiasm when they are constantly wor­ried that one single mistake will get them benched? Players should feel like they are going on the field do something positive, not scared to play. 
Finally, and worst of all, Bob Davie has accepted defeat. After the loss to Stanford, Davie reverted back to the high GPAs and gradua­tion rate of Notre Dame football players, suggesting that this season wasn't a dism-al failure. Well, I have news for you. Anytime Notre Dame loses more than they win, it is a failure. At a press conference, Davie stated that we have to look at the big picture and at our foot­ball team's true character. He says that the team succeeded because they are good peopfe. He tells us that it is difficult to produce a national championship team with Notre Dame's high academic stan­dards. On Sunday, Kevin White said that Bob Davie is wrong. The ability to achieve athletic success while maintaining academic excel­lence is the essence of Notre Dame. It's what makes us special. It's why we came to this University and it's why we are Notre Dame. On Sunday, Kevin White refused to let Bob Davie take that mentality away from us.

Here's an interesting twist on an old favorite. Racing games are perhaps the largest and best­loved genre of video games. In the past. gamers have been able to gain speed using conventional modes of transport such as cars, boats and motor­cycles, and even more non-conventional machines such as gravity defying vehicles and hovercrafts. 
SCEA Santa Monica's Kinetica is something quite different: Characters in this racing game have been melded to their "kinetic skin" allowing them to reach speeds in excess of 200 mph on their hands and knees. Wheels spring forth from hands and feet and sleek, aerodynamic suits barely cover the rest of the body. 
Each character is rated on the abilities of his or her given suit. Acceleration, top speed, cornering, grip and mass all factor into each character's abili­ty to dominate a given track. 
The artistic talent used to create these charac­ters is great enough to merit a separate booklet accompanying the game just for the artwork.

Graphically, this game is astonishing. Each track is highly detailed and almost confusingly intricate. 
The tracks are comprised of so many different levels and shortcuts that it is hard to keep track of where a racer is located on the course. Racers can· easily become disoriented on these tracks as angles change; there is no solid point of reference to use to determine if one is racing on the bottom or sides of the track. 
Often times it is a guessing game when a racer careens off the edge of one track; sometimes what lies beneath is another section of track, other times you fall off into the great CGI beyond. 
The trick to winning this game lies all in a char­acter's Kinetic Suit boost meter and keeping it full. 

Racers can access the energy in their boost meter to get an extra edge over competitors, utilize con-

Latest Metal Gear as 'Solid' as they come 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS Secene Edi tor 

Metal Gear Solid 2: the· Sons of Liberty isn't a videogame, it's a movie. Of course, that statement is only half true; players of Konami's follow-up to the 1998 Playstation hit Metal Gear Solid will spend about as much time watching the game as they do playing it. 
Konami has pulled out all the stops with MGS2. In fact, the 3-D graphics are so good that· cut-scene movies are almost indistinguishable from normal gameplay; they even have an imperceptible load time. The game is one of the first new-wave videogames emerging on the market that are beginning to take advantage of the Playstation 2's advanced graphic rendering abilities. MGS2 doesn't

just up the ante, it takes gaming to a whole new level. 
MGS2 doesn't make many quantum leaps in format, however. Fans of MGS2's predecessor will recognize Konarni's gameplay style with only a few minor tweaks and improvements. While some games require major format overhauls between sequels, Konami wisely decid­ed to stick "'.ith one of MGS' strongest selling points:. escape and evasion style espionage rather than double­barreled gun-blasting action (although MGS2 leaves plenty of room for that, too). In fact, MGS2 seems to be just an extension of the original title. 
MGS2 does, however, change genre slightly in this new installment by adding a touch of the supernatural. The addition is modest and really adds an extra boost to the games. 
Besides having graphics the quality of the latest CGI movies like "Pinal rantasy; The Spirits Within," MGS2 has one of the most impressive soundtracks in gaming history. The professional tracks are laid down by some or Hollywood's best known sound editors like Harry Gregson-Williams. In surround sound, MGS2 can have the feeling of a blockbuster action flick. 
The real improvement<; in MGS2 come from its becfod­up plot. While the Metal Gear series has always been known for i1s complex web of' setups. double crosses and reversals. MGS2 takes the cake for having the most intri­cate and riveting storyline. Critics of MGS complained that the ending was unsatisfactory and rightfully so. MGS2's addictive plot will have gamers hooked for hour upon thumb-blistering hour. Scripted by video game vet­eran Hideo Kojima, this installment survives the trip from Japan linguistically intact MGS2 lacks verbal gaffs like "the truck have started to move" all too familiar in previ­ous games. 

In all fairness, it wouldn't be prudent to reveal even a smidge of the plot to this cliIT-hanger. But gamers will see both old and new faces as well as Metal Gear conventions such as hiding in a cardboard box. starting out with almost nothing but a pack of cigarettes ·and elaborate nicknames. 
MGS2 is undoubtedly on the fast-track to becoming a videogame classic and obviously redefines the standards in actiorv'adventure gameplay and cinematic effects. With more than 2,000,000 copies of the game shipped out already, MGS2 should be on every Playstation 2 gamer's wishlist this holiday season.

ormat in racing genre 

There are several ways to gain boost. A player can take advantage of the boost strips located along areas of track. When racing over one, a play­er receives the same acceleration as active boost­ing without depleting the meter. 
To be able to actively boost, a player must have a significant level in their boost meter. Meters can be filled either by siphon boosting -sucking up the power from boost strips as you pass them -or by performing tricks to earn boost. This is the best way to gain boost, and it is doubtful that a player could win a game without performing any stunts. Performing several stunts in a row creates a combo, providing additional boost. 
Power-ups can also be gathered throughout the game, comprised of either five yellow crystals or one r.ed crystal. Power-ups are randomly assigned and can provide the option to deactivate the boost of players in your proximity, perform stunts at double the speed, steal other character's boost and more. 
Single player options include the single race, a season and a practice race, while two player options include a practice race and a split screen option, as well as a competitive/best of series for up to four players. 
The single player season mode is the key to unlocking new tracks and characters then accessi­ble in the single race, practice races and competi­tive races. The season consists of a series of races where a player must finish with a certain ranking to advance· to the next race. There are three options to re-try games within a season. Each sea­son becomes increasingly more difficult with more stringent r~quirements for qualifying. 
Kinetica adds a new and interesting mode of rac­ing to a genre full of creative transportation. Once the tracks are mastered, this game offers endless entertainment and extraordinary graphics.

GTA 3: for mature audiences only 
By BOB MASTERS 
Scene Writer 
When Pope John Paul II called 20th Century Western society a "culture of death," he may have anticipated a time when the average American could experience car-jacking, gang warfare, prostitution, drug use and homicide from the comfort of their own couch. 
With Rock Star Games' holiday release of Grand Theft Auto 3 for Sony PlayStation 2, that time is now. 
Following the same plot of Rock Star Games' previ­ous Grand Theft offerings, Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, players take on the role of a small-time crook in the corrupt melropolis of Liberty City. Set-up by his girlfriend during a heist, the play­er manages to escape from the police after a gang of thugs overtakes the police car he is traveling in. 
Aided in his escape by a member of a local crimi­nal outfit, the player begins doing odd.jobs for Liberty City crimelords in his quest to become a "made-man." GTA3 carries a mature rating and it definitely earns it. with missions ranging from tailing suspected informants to gunning-down rival gang leaders. 
Graphically, GTA3 is in a league of its own. The previous Grand Theft Auto games, GTA and GTA2, were two-dimensional cartoons. Updated for a more powerful system. GTA3 is a stunn'ing visual extrava­ganza. The action takes place in three large playable environments. each with their own unique aspects including harbors, airports, major business centers, armories, red-light dist,ricts and residential areas. The visuals are incredibly crisp; buildings are three­dimensional and sleek. cars are detailed down to hood-ornaments and the player receives a make­over into a leather-jacket, cargo-pant clad hood. 
Grand Theft Auto 3 
Rock Star Games 
***** (out of five) 
The game is set in real time so the player will see the sun rise, watch thunder storms roll in, and expe­rience the setting sun give way to the darkness of midnight. 
If the player jumps into a car too fast, the door will remain open until he reaches out and close it. If a cop comes too close, the player will flip him the bird. 
Bullet-wounds and beatings produce oozing blood, so stunningly realistic a mature rating may seem 

tame. All these graphical extras add up to make GTA3 a visual experi­ence like no other game on the mar­ket. 
Game time is divided spending half the time on foot and half the time inside a car. GTA3 offers both first and third-person <;haracter control and plays about as well as most next-generation role-playing games. _ 
Once inside a car. however. GTA3 transforms itself from a HPG into a top of the line auto sim. Mini-vans and sedans handle just as awkward­ly and slowly as their real-life coun­terparts. Sports cars and perfor­mance vehicles are a true pleasure to handle, offering a high speed get­away vehicle that includes a hand-break for increased control. 
GTA3 by Rock Star Games for PlayStation 2 is an incredibly entertaining game light-years away from any other competitors on the market. The intriguing story-line and easy to handle interface make it enjoyable to play and the graphics will leave the players jaw dropped in astonishment. 
Its one detraction may be the mature rating, with GTA3 becoming at times little more than a blood­bath. If you're easily offended by mobster movies such as "Goodfellas" or "Casino," this may not be the game for you. But if you enjoy a little suspension of reality and a chance to express your violent side in a way that won't land you in jail, GTA3 is a must-own.

Grabbing an entry pass near the base­line, Ilgauskas spun on the baseline, made a pump fake on Zeljko Hebraca and dropped in a short jumper. 
The next time he touched the ball, Ilgauskas drew a shooting foul and split a pair of free throws. On the defensive end, he flattened Stackhouse on a drive to the basket. 
He clunked, made a left-handed layup and hit a nice fadeaway jumper from 12 feet before being replaced. As he went to the bench, Cavs coach John Lucas, who had yet to coach his center in a regular­season game, slapped hancls withllgauskas.

Sugar Bowl 
The Big Ten champion accepted an invitation Tuesday to the Sugar Bowl, which will be played New Year's Day ·in New Orleans. It will be the lllini's first trip to the Sugar Bowl. 
"We're excitrd," coach Rnn Turner said. "It is one of the premier bowls in college foot­ball and has been for many, many years. I know our kids are very excited and anxious to 
. get down there and get going and see what we can do." No. 8 Illinois (10-1) will have to wait a few more days to see who its oppornrnt is, though. The opponent will be announced Sunday after the Southeastern Confer·ence championship game between No. 2 Tennessee and No, 21 LSU. If LSU wins, the Tigers would go to the Sugar Bowl. If the Volunteers win, Nebraska (No. 4 ESPN/USA Today, No. 5 AP) could encl up in "Jew Orleans. "We will wait until we see what happens this weekend ­our focus is on ourselves," Turner said, adding that the 
Illini will begin practice this week. 
Illinois was the Big Ten's biggest surprise this year, rebounding from a 5-6 finish last season to win the confer­ence championship. After los­ing to Michigan on Sept. 27, the Illini clidn 't lose another game. 
Thry clincherl at least a share of the Big Ten title by beating Northwestern in the season finaln but had to wait for the Ohio State-Michigan game to see who would get the Big Tern's BCS bid. The Buckeves upset Michigan, giving lllin.ois the conference championship outright. 
''Coach Turner and the staff and the kids have done an exceptional job," athletic direc­tor Ron Guenther said. "l think it's one of the great stories in college football this year. We're extremPly excited to be part of the BCS and to go to New Orleans." 
This will be Illinois' 14th ;;tppearance in a bowl game. The lllini are 6-7, but they've won their last two bowls, including a 63-21 upset over Virginia in the 1999 Micronpc.com Bowl. 
"One reason lllinois is appeal­ing to us, besides the fact we've secured the Big Ten champion and an exciting team, is that they have a very enthusiastic group of supporters and they are eager to see them in a bowl," Sugar Bowl executive director Paul Hoolahan said.

OnlyQBs inHeisman running 
. Harrington, Crouch, Dorsey and Grossman in hunt for top honor 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Quarterbacks Ken Dorsey. Joey Harrington, Eric Crourh and Rex Grossman were picked Tuesday as finalists for thf' lleisman Trophy. 
Dorsey threw for 2,652 yards and 23 touchdowns this season to lead No. 1 Miami (11-0) to the Rose Bowl. 
Harrington threw for 2.415 yards and 23 touchdowns help No. 3 Oregon (10-1) win the Pac-10 championship. 
Crouch threw for 1,510 yards and seven touchdowns and ran for 1,115 yards and 19 scores for No. 5 Nebraska (11-1 ). 
Grossman led the-nation in 
passing efficiency, throwing for 
3,896 yards and 34 touchdowns 
for No. 6 Florida (9-2). 
"These players have had phe­nomenal seasons across the board and anyone of them would be deserving of college football's highest honor," said Rudy Riska, the executive director of the Heisman Memorial Trophy Trust. 
Riska said a fifth player could be invited later this week to the ceremony in New York. The Heisman will be awarded Saturday night at the Marriott Marquis because of damage to the Downtown Athletic Club during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It will mark the first time in 6 7 years that the trophy will be presented somewhere other than the club. 


Superstitious Dorsey leads Miami 
Asodared Pres\ 

CORAL GABLES, Fla. 
Ken Dorsey walks around the hotel ballroom in circles, passing his teammates again and again. The other players don't pay attention. knowing this is one of his 
m a n y 
pre game rituals. 

He con­tinues around the room until it's time to leave for the stadi­um. His routine has just begun. 
Dorsey is quite supersti­tious. Manv athletes are, but the Miami ·Hurricanes' junior quarterback has some of the quirkiest habits in college football. They define Dorsey, one of the most consistent sig­nal callers in tho country and a Heisman Trophy contender. 
"If something happens once and works. it's something that just latches on," Dorsey says. 
Dorsey's superstitions most­ly deal with his pregame rou­tine and are usuallv related to appearance, music and trav­el. 
He wears two rubber bands on his left wrist, a practice teammate Jarrett Payton talked him into as a fresh­man. Dorsey takes them off only when he sleeps. 
"I just liked them because they're fun to play with," he says. "They're more stress releasers than anything else."

He even tries to lime the second song so it ends just as the bus is coming to a stop. This gets tricky on the road because he is never exactly sure how long the ride will be. 
"Every time I've stop pnd it to restart th(' song, I've had a bad game," he says. explain­ing that it happened at Washington last season and al Boston College last month.

Each night after tlrn drive homo, Dorsey makes sure his car stereo is on the firsl pre­set. And he always list!'ns to the same stations in order during his 6:15 a.m. trip to campus to study game tape /'or an hour before class. 
The superstitions started in high school when Dorsey used to wear the same ragged T­shirt under his football jersey. But he thinks they may have 
been ingrained fwcn carlinr. possibly when he played base­

And Dorsey figures parts of them carried over to football, the sport he started playing as a receiver in middle school before switching to quarter­back as a fresh man at Miramont11 High in Orinda, Calif.

"I was planning on coming up [to Notre Dame for the banquet]." Carney told The Observer Monday. "But after talking to some of the coaches, they deferred my visit to Jan. 17-19." 
After choosing to cancel the pubJic event and issue refunds to those who purchased tickets, Davie, the assis tant coaches and administrators dis­cussed other possible options, specifi­cally a private gathering either in the Joyce Center Monogram Room or the Stadium press box.

"It was unfortunate," Hunter said. "It's our last chance to be together as a team, so it's unfortunate. I think there will be something before we all get out of here for break." 
Both seniors felt that the banquet's cancellation will not, however, affect Notre Dame's recruiting.

. Indiana beats Notre Dame 76-75 behide Coverdale's foul-shooting down the stretch 
By JOE LICANDRO Sporrs Writer 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 

Last vear. Tom Covrm.lalH hurt Notre Dame by scorh1g 30 points, leading Indiana to an 86­78 vktorv. This VPiH iL was Covl'rrlale's auto­matic l'n~e thro,~ shooting at the ericl of th£i gamo along ,vith sophomore tl'ammaw Jarod JeffriPs' ganw-high 28 points that enabled the lloosiNs to narrowly t>scapP with a 76-7S vic­tory over the Irish. 
"l would describe this as the Lest game of my career," said Jp,ffries. "I nially pulled il togeth­er offensively tonight. I think playing in front of a home crowd helped me a lot." 
Despite great individual efforts from fresh­man Chris Thomas and seniors Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan, the Irish were unable to awmge last year's defeat to the Hoosiers. Thomas led the Irish with 24 points while Humphrey and Swanagan scored 23 and 17 respectively. 
Thomas {vas poised through the entire game, not allowing the boisterous Assembly Hall crowd to affect his play, while Humphrey and Swanagan were critical to the second half Irish comeback. 
"Chris Thomas didn't look like a freshman out there," said Irish head coach Mike Brey. "Swanagan was amazingly efficient on the offonsive end. Ryan Humphrey continued to play well. He's taking a lot of pride leading this team. v\'e just came up a little short at the end of the game."

2001 banquet cancelled 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Sports Ediror 
The Notre Dame Football Banquet, original­ly scheduled to take place on Friday, has been can­celled, the athletic depart­ment announced Monday. 
When Athletic Director Kevin White announced the firiug of head coach Bob Davie on Sunday, White told reporters that thP banquet would still go on as scheduled. 
But after speaking to Davie on Sunday night, the athletic; administrators· chose not to ask Davie to speak at the public forum as Notre DameOs former 
head coach. 

"Under the circum­stances, he didn't really feel comfortable doing this," sports information director John Heisler said. "It's been something with the general public involved and with all the things with that. if he wasn't comfortable doing that, nobody was going to tell him that he had to." 
The annual banquet had been used in previous years as a recruiting tool, with many potential play­ers making their official visits over the weekend of the banquet. Aller Davie's firing was announced, the administration pushed to delay the players' visits. 
"I talked with a number of the assistants about their recruits, and near as possible we are going to defer to a week in January, where that's pos­sible," White said Sunday. 
Associate athletic direc­tor Bernard Muir contact­ed each of the recruits who planned on attending, Heisler confirmed. Muir declined to be interviewed for this story. 
Safety Jake Carney from Lexington, Ky., was origi­nally planning on coming up to South Bend this weekirnd, but changPd his plans al'ter the rcceni developments.
