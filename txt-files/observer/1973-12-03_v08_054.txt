Academic Council polled concerning new calendar 
by Howard Wood and Claude Devaney 
In a sruvey of 35 members of the Academic Council The Observer )ound that twelve ' h '74-'75
members object to a recall vote on t e new academic calendar presented by Provost James Burtchaell, CSC. A recall vote would entail reconsideration of the new calendar. 
The survey also revealed that seven members had "had no objection to a recall vote." Six new members stated thatthey would have to hear new arguments before making a decision on the matter. Seven members had 'no comment.' 
The 12 members that object are returning members on the Council. They were on the Council in Dtecember 1972 that voted to give the Administrati,an the right to draw up a new calendar. 
Dr. Robert Gordon,vicepresident for advanced studies, objects to a recall vote. "I don't believe in bringing back old issues in order to vote on them again." 
University Registrar Richard Sullivain objects for a different reason. "There is an immediate need for a calendar to operate. I can't wait any longer." 
Dr. Morris Pollard, director of Lobund Laboratory,· opposes the proposed pre-Labor Day start but does not think that a recall vote will help. "Anew vote would create more havoc. 
It's too late.. " 
The seven members of last year's Council that do not object to a recall . vot~ offere.d their comments. Fr. Jerome Wilson,v1ce pres1dentfor student affairs, stated, "I accept all things Fr. Burtchaell enunciated, but if there was a recall I would take careful consideration and think it over very seriously before I would change my vote." 
Professor Frederick Crosson, of the College of Arts and Letters, who is "neutral" toward the new calendar, stated, "I have an open mind toward a recall vote. I want to hear arguments on both sides before I make a decision." 
Six of the ten new members of the Academic Co111ncil interviewed said the could not make a decision until he heard the arguments presented.

Powell explains CPA criteria 
by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
Dr. Ray Powell, chairman of the department of accountancy, denied any impropriety in using university grade point averages to determine enrollment in the CPA coaching class next semester. 
"I know of nothing in University annals which in the way of academic regulations prevents a chairman­alternately a Department or the University-from setting a standard for entry into a course or program," Powell explained in an interview over the weekend. 
Powell admitted that of the 167 senior accounting majors only those with GPA above 2.775 were eligible for the 105 course cards. To Powell, the equitable way to distribute the course cards was the GPA criteria. 
"Given the existing faculty availability and facing the problems," siad Powell, "it was my professional judgment that this was as equitable as any method." 
Powell pointed out that a week of consultation with senior accounting majors could not produce a more efficient method. 
GPA confidentiality 
Powell denied that he had violated the con­fidentiality of the GPA by releasing a listing of all accounting majors in order from high to low. He in­sisted that he preserved the confidentiality. 
"I said to the students as we met the other evening: the student ranking I am making available to them in the enrollment process is confidential; they were not to remove it from the room," Powel, said. 
Powell noted that those enrolled in the CPA coaching course were required to give the listing of grade point averages to a professor as proof of their enrollment. Only one student failed to return the GPA listing,Powell claimed. 

Dr. Powell, interviewed recently, discussed GPA as a criteria for CPA coaching course.

Powell favors the use of the GPA as determinant of the CPA course. He cited a two-year study of CPA examinees in Kansas and Illinois which demonstrates that the better the grade point average the better chance of passing the test. Only one Notre Dame student of 2.8 cumulative grade point who took the CPA test last year passed according to Powell. 
When asked if a university could legally use the grade point average as the sole criteria for course admittance, Powell replied that he saw no reason why it could not. 
"Having served in the post of Chairman for fourteen years I know of no proscription which precludes the university from doing this," said Powell.

According to Dr. McGuiness, reality therapy is a reaction to traditional forms of therapy, a common sense approach to helping people, whether they be children or adults, to become more respon­sible for themselves their learning and behavior. 
"It's a set procedure for helping people help each other, built upon the primary foundation of caring, or becoming involved in a warm personal way," stated the reality therapist. 
To Dr. McGuiness, an ideal learning situation would be one in which "a child's emplacement should insure some degree of success in that activity. A learning activity should create a place where the student can't fail and a place where you never run out of

The identity concepts of this new reality therapy maintain that our priorities have changed. A major cultural shift has occurred from the. pre-world War II Survival Society to the Post-World War II Identity Society. 
Dr. McGuiness contends that students today are searching for an identity or a role before a goal. They feel the internal pressures of "what I want to do" rather than the external pressures of school and parents. Today, students are moreconcerened with the internal locus of control, they want to know the rationale, and the concept of personal growth and change

Dr.' McGuiness concluded that society has become established in which a person needs to know who he is before he decides what he is to become. Personal worth, caring about each other and in­interdependence in a changing society are key components of the new trend.

Some Class, Ice Fans 
Friday night after the lackadasical hockey teamts loss to a slow Denver team, a frustrated fan hurled an empty glass bottle in the direction of the Denver bench, nearly missing a player. No frustration, not even the terrible per­formance of ND's "star-studded" team, justifies that criminal act. Yet, no usher grabbed the assailant and no person in the section around him turned him over to the authorities. 
H the bottle had found its mark, a player could have been seriously injured and the bottle-throwing act could have been considered an assault-a criminal offense. Yet, the student who heaved the bottle got off scot-free. 
It's really time for this kind of nonsense to stop. Steve Klein, hockey writer for The South Bend Tribune, claims that ND is getting a reputation around the WCHA as a really classless nlace because

When the football team returns with its first undefeated season since 1949 tonight at 7:30, the circle again should be jammed.

losing Faith 
Editor: 
Regarding the piece by Father McNally in today's Observer in which he disputes the facts of Professor Vasoli (Decreasing Mass Attendance, Diminishing Importance of Theology, Fewer Religious on Campus--and the generally recognized fact of the 
waning  of  Catholicism  on  this  
campus):  Father  McNally  
evidences  a  sign  of  either  

stupidity, blindness, dishonesty, or naivete. As a fellow priest and one who has been on this campus for 35 years I hope the word "naivete" applies in this instance--which is defined in the Thorndike-Barnhard Dictionary, 1972 edition, as "simplicity, as in a small child". As a matter of fact it appears to the undersigned that Fr. McNally's final sentence "despite its flaws, 
<Notre Dame) is a good place to be..." is an echo of another statement allegedly made by another esc priest a few years ago: "What better place for a man to lose his faith, than at Notre Dame?"

Reactions I received. from those around me, went along the linesof, "what did you expect, this is Notre Dame..."

All good things must come to au end, so too with this paper, and hence this column since Friday will be The, Observer's last issue for the semester. Hopefully, we will all be back in January. Anyhow, the net­works have loaded up on movies and Christmas specials in the coming weeks and after this week's programs are reviewed, I shall note the highlights up to the end of December since that is when my advance schedules end. 
The pilot film for the "Waltons" encores Friday night when the family finds the true meaning of Christmas in the Emmy award winning The Homecoming. Richard Thomas still plays John-Boy but Patricia Neal and Andrew Duggan have the original roles now assumed by Michael Learned and Ralph Waite as the parents. The plot this time does not concern a dis,ease, but there is the drama that made the weekly show somewhat a television phenomenon. The father is expected home on Chirstmas but ' roads are dangerous. Itis a daily occurance that one is hampered by roads tod~y but it is these little things of day-to-day living that 
are usually portrayed on "The Waltons" 
intelligently and compassionately. That is 
why the program is succE!sssful. 
Maneater is slated for the "ABC Suspense 
Movie" slot on Saturday. Appearing to be a 
take-off on the short story "The Most 
Danger Game" we have Richard Basehart 
as a hunter slightly off his nut letting loose a 
tiger against Ben Gazzara .and Sharee North 
on Basehart's preserve. Basehart has 
played madmen roles before and he is quite 
adept at it. So, if the plot doesn't call for it 
being overdone, this film could be decent 
escapist fare. 
the fathers of a bride and groom. Usually they perform with an eye on timing and comedy but the script bogs down the plot (Gleason is not too hot on the marriage) with unnecessary and not funny slapstick. It airs Saturday. Bloodsport, a made-for-TV film has Ben Johnson as a sports-on-the­brain father trying to push his highschool son into the college offering the most. Naturally the game is football but it's no Brian's Song. Tuesday's made-for-TV ABC film is A Summer Without Bqys. a variation of The Summer of 42. Barbara Bain plays a woman on the verge of losing her husband to a decaying marriage who falls for 4-f Michael Moriarity (Bang the Drum Slowly) in 1944. Catch here is, the daughter (Kay Lenz --"Lisa-Bright and Dark") also loves the boy. And tonight Yul Brynner and Britt Ekland star in The Double Man, about a CIA agent who investigates the murder of his son in Switzerland. If you can avoid the card­board performances and phoney backcrops, there is a pretty good plot with some neat twists hidden in it. Watch the game instead. The Steelers play the Dolphins at Miami at nine. 
Now for the specials. For daytime wat­. chers, ABC has five one hour dramas slated at 1:30pm this week for their "Matinee Playbreak" semi-regular series. On NBC Tuesday, the story of "Hans Brinker" will . be repeated and at ten tomorrow, ABC presents Alan King hosting Milton Berle, 1 George Burns, Godfrey Cambridge, Angie Dickinson (for what reason I don't know), · Nancy Dussault, Totie Fields, Don Knotts, .

How to reruns Thursday at eight and Jason Commit Marriage has two veteran Robards, Jr., encores in "The House comedians, BobHope~nd Jackie Gleason, as Without a Christmas Tree" following at 8:30 on 22. This last special, although produced first, is a sequel to "The Thanksgiving Treasure" a few weeks ago. On the serious side, Thursday, "CBS Reports" probes corporations, which had been postponed earlier this season. And for the kiddies, ''Rudolph the Red'Nosed Reindeer" is re­telecast Friday on 22 at eight.

Theaterpresentation as yet unannounced will occupy the CBS Tuesday movie slot Dec. 18 and the Rockefellers are examined Dec. 28 on CBS. I do not have the listings for future ABC offerings since channel 28 has been having trouble with their mailing system. 
' There are a few good movies scheduled for the coming weeks (again, I wish Ihad the ABC schedules because their Sunday night films are usually worth the watching). IOn Monday Dec. 10, Key West premieres. Steve Boyd and Woody Strode star as a pair of Floridian private-eyes in a pilot that did not .sell for this season. NBC also unveils Hotel that following Saturday. Based on the ,Arthur Haily (Airport) novel, this movie has ithe usual mash of soapy plots and a !SUspenseful 1ending with · Rod Taylor, 'Catherine Spaak, Karl Malden, and Michael ·Rennie heading an all-star cast. December 17 premieres Once You Kiss a Stranger on iNBC, a sleeper you can kiss off. Advancing ; a week, also on NBC, one should not miss the tencore showing of My Sweet Charlie with Patty Duke and Al Freeman, Jr. on Crist­mas Eve. This excellent drama based on the Broadway play has pregnant unmarried bigoted Patty Duke living in a Louisiana house vacated by its owners during the 
winter. Enter black lawyer Freeman who is running from the law and the drama is set up. The film follows the development of their relationship until Christmas Eve when the outside world breaks in with devastating results due to the impending birth of Miss Duke's baby. For a made-for-TV film, it is far above the average fare and good viewing. 
And December 29 premieres Sweet Charity with Shirley MacClaine and Ricardo Montalban. This box office bomb concerns the trials and tribulations of the original happy hooker with some of the finest numbers being performed by a chorus of other women of the street. Its best song is "Hey, Big Spender", so I suggest you spend a little time with the film that Saturday on NBC. There will be a new version of The Miracle on 34th Street sometime over the holidays, probably on ABC, so I suggest watching for it. It will bring back the days when Macy's parades and Santa Claus had special and different meaning. 
Diverging a bit... I would like to congratulate the 1973 Notre Dame football team for their excellent season. I hope these remarks echo the sentiments of the rest of the senior class in thanking the team for adding a great deal to an already memorable year. Now dam the Tide and full speed ahead Dec. 31.

Research meeting slated 
by David Kaminski Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame branch of the Indiana Public Interest Research Group (InPIRG), will hold a reorganizational meeting for all interested students on Monday night, Dec. 3, at 6:30 p.m. in the Fiesta Lounge of LaFortune Student Center. 
The InPIRG meeting will feature Mr. Mark Riddle, director of In PIRG at Indiana University at Bloomington. Riddle will describe the InPIRG activities at I.U. and suggest ways that Notre Dame can reorganize their InPIRG branch, which started here in 1971. 
The Public Interest Research 
Group is a citizens' group organized through colleges and universities in many states. By means of students' funding and volunteer work, ·each state's PIRG hires a professional staff, in­cluding lawyers and engineers, who work on such problems as: air pollution, corporate responsibility, 
women's  rights,  consumer  price  
information,  and  land  use  plan­ 
ning.  

In the spring of 1972, 75 per cent of the Notre Dame student body signed a petition favoring a $2 fee for InPIRG activity to be attached 
ND gives over $44,000 to United Way campaign 
A total of $44,511.70 in gifts or about two percent more than the assigned goal of $43,780, was received from Notre Dame by the United Way campaign as of Nov. 7, the last day of the 1973 drive. 
The greatest share of campus gifts, totalling $27,951.00, came from 339 faculty members who gave an average gift of $82.45. Gifts varied widely in size with many donating twice to three times that "average gift." Par­ticipation in the drive also varied widely among the various categories of faculty. By colleges, the number of faculty and the per cent participation were: Engineering 77 per cent of 85, Business Administration 70 per cent of 46, Law 59 percent of 22, Science 51 per cent of 132, Arts and Letters 49 per cent of 254. In the non-college faculty, 18 percent of 
The next largest share of the total came from 144 administration members who contributed $8,167.24 for an average gift of $56.72. 92.3 per cent of the ad­ministration participated in the drive. A total of $6,460.91 came from 660 staff members who gave an average gift of $9.79 and their numbers represented 31.5 per cent of the total staff. $523.99 in special gifts was also received. All told 204 students contributed $1,159.61, for an average gift of $5.68. Student volunteers also raised an ad­ditional $248.95 for the United Way by selling shamrocks at the Michigan State and Southern California football games. 
As the late gifts come in, some rise of the per cent participation in the faculty and staff categories is expected, but the final figures probably will not be widely dif­

to each student's. bilL The Notre Dame administration agreed to go through with this billing arrangement, but the funds were never collected. 
The InPIRG movement failed largely because of tht' Indiana University InPIRG's inability to secure a similar billing arrangement. I.U. was only allowed to eollect a voluntary $3 fee at registration time. 
Also, the use of the money was restricted to projects in the Bloomington community. Without the financial support for a statewide organization by In­diana's largest university, the InPIRG movement died in In­diana. 
However, since 1971, I.U. has used its InPIRG fllnds in Bloomington for such projects as fairness in tenant-landlord relationships and consumer price information. At the same time, InPIRG at I.U. has obtained a grant from a private foundation to help fund a statewide InPIRG organization. With the foundation money as a basis, Indiana University hopes to renew the InPIRG movement in Indiana. 
The Notre Dame branch of InPIRG has approximately $150 left from activities in 1971-72. At that time, InPIRG received funds from Notre Dame and St. Mary's student governments to finance a publicity drive to develop student interest in InPIRG. 
According to John B;:IChmann, one of Notre Dame's InPIRG organizers, students at Monday's meeting will discuss ways in which the various colleges and univer­sities in Indiana can organize a statewide InPIRG. Also, students will decide how InPIRG might go about restablishing the $2 fee on students' bills. 
"Notre Dame's administration was very cooperative in our efforts of two years ago," Bachmann said. "We have to go back and see if we can get started again. We may have to either run anotht·r student petition drive or hold H student referrendum to see if we can regain student support for InPIRG."

Irish ~open impressively, defeat Valparaiso 112-62 
by Peggy Lawlm· Digger Phelps' Irish got off to a good start Saturday afternoon, defeating Valparaiso University from Valparaiso, Indiana 112-62, before a capacity crowd of 11,343. For the first time in Phelps' career as Notre Dame's head coach, his team won the season opener. And that wasn't the only first the cagers earned on Saturday. They were also the first Irish team to score 100 points for Digger, and they won by the widest margin of victory in almost twenty years. But perhaps the most meaningful statistic for the Irish in looking ahead to the season is the fact that every member of the squad who dressed, scored. 
Freshman Adrian Dantley led the team scoring with 16 points, and was also tops in the reboun­ding category, with nine. Junior co-captain John Shumate tallied 15, while guards Gary Brokaw and Dwight Clay each had 14 points. Gary Novak, Irish co-captain and the fifth starter, had six points and six rebounds. But the scoring didn't stop with the starting team. 
In fact, almost half olf the 112 Irish points came from the reserves, as Phelps substituted freely. Freshman Bill Drew (10 points), Bill Paterno (8), Ray Martin (6), Toby Knight (4 points and 7 rebounds), and Dave Kusmicz (2) turned in !fine per­formances in their first college game. For the Irish veterans, Peter Crotty tallied five points, Roger Anderson and Greg Sch­melzer each scored four, and Chris Stevens and Myron Schuckman had two points apiece. 
"Phelps has no problems in depth," commented Vaipo coach Bill Purden. "I was impressed with Digger's style of sub­stitution." 
And substitute he did: no less than 27 times throughout tl1e game, compared with 10 substitutions made by Purden. "It was good to have our freshmen and everyone playing, " said Phelps. "They had confidence to play as a team. I was proud of our guys today." 
Of the opposition, Phelps was complimentary. "Valpo has good potential. They went to the finals of the NCAA regionals last season, and I'm sure they'll ·bounce back later on in the season. They were tired after Friday night's game."

Guard Dwight Clay was just one of fifteen Irish players making his way into the scoring column in Saturday afternoon's contest against Valpo. 
For the Crusaders, guard John Semmelhack was the high point man, with 17, and Jeff Holmes and Mark Kassner each tallied 13. 
"We had hoped to make a better showing, but the full court man-to­man pressure was too hard to stop," explained Purden. "We tried to set up plays, but they just didn't work." 
Accuracy seemed to be a problem for Valpo, as only Sem­melhack and Kassner shot over the .500 mark, for the team percentage of just .319. The Irish, on the other hand, shot an excellent .563 from the floor, including .500 or better. performances from ten players. 
The Irish were never in trouble, as they went ahead 9-4 in the early ~1inutes of the game, and con­tmued to add to their lead throughout the first half, making the halftime score 55-33. The. second half was much the same; it was only a matter of how large the Irish margin would be.

While Coach Parseghian may be reluctant to take the praise, the 
members of his "team" are always ready to give him the credit. 
"I feel terrific for him," offered defensive line coach Joe Yonto. "This is his tenth season here, and he's 10-0. It¢ouldn't happen to a better guy. He's just tremendous to work for." 
Then coach Yonto touched on the point which Ara had stressed among his team captains since those first few weeks in August-that of leader­ship. "It all starts with the leader," added Yonto as he pointed to Ara busily answering questions. "There's a Notre Dame guy if I ever saw one." 
"There are no words to describe his feeling of complete joy," said receiver coach Mike Stock. "He's been so close so many times before. If anybody could have seen his picture of anguish on the sidelines after that final season loss in 1964, orrealized~e humility he suffered after last year's Orange Bowl, they'd feel nothing but happiness for him now." 
Sometimes it's those who play under him who can say it the best. 'I've never had more respect for a guy," offered kicker Bob Thomas. "After last year's Orange Bowl we were all crushed, and he, more than anyone else, had to live through that. But all along he said we'd be back, and we certainly are." 
'He has a tremendous mind," added co-<:aptain Frank Pomarico, he's a 
tremendous judge of character and the most impressive man I've seen in 
a while." 
"He's so great that if you're down and out, he keeps you going," said 
defensive co-<:aptain and All-American Mike Townsend. "I feel the best 
for him because helis the best." 
Linebacker coach George Kelly may have added just a little bit more to 
that when he said, "He's the world's greatest coach."
