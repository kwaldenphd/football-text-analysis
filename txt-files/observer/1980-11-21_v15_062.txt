Iscandal mars racel 
By David Sarphie Staff Reporter 
Yesterday's Student Senate runoffs were marred by scandal, as Hans Hoerdemann, candidate in District 2, was disqualified for campaign violations. The Ombudsman Election Committee declared Frank Tighe the winner in that district. 
In the other races, Jim O'Neill defeated Bob Helle in District 1, garnishing 53% of the vote. Patrick Borchers was given the nod in District 3, easily defeating Carl Carney. A mere three votes separated the two candidates in District4, asJeffNewby slipped past Tom Weithman, 249 to 246. Only 28 people showed up to vote in the off-campus race, District 5, as Mitch Feikes defeated Kathleen Kucaba. 
Hoerdemann was charged with placement of posters in Keenan Hall on election day, exceeding the size limit for campaign posters, failure to submit a copy ofeach poster to the election committee, and failure to disclose receipts for campaign materials. "Tom (Koegel, election director) called me at two o'clock and said that they had received reports from Frank Tighe that my posters ·were too big," Hoerdemann remarked. "I understand that it put the Ombudsman between a rock and a hard place. I unknowingly used worthless computer paper for my posters, and so their only recourse was to declare my candidacy null and void."

The tales of a literary man 
The DowJones industrial average closed above the emotionally chl!-rged 1,000 level for the first time in almost four years yesterday after a late wave of buying swept through the stock market. The average, the oldest and best known indicator of market trends, climbed 9.13 to 1,000.17, its highest close since it finished· at 1,004.65 on Dec. 31, 1976. Several other, broader indexes hit all-time highs as the rally following President-elect Reagan's victory in theNov. 4 election continued. Trading remained heavy, though a bit off the blistering pace of the past few sessions. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 60.18 million shares, down from 
69.23 million Wednesday. The biggest contributor to the Dow's gain yesterday was Texaco, which jumped three points to 48, hitting a record high, and led the active list on turnover of close to 2 ·million shares.-AP 
Millions of American smokers went "cold turkey" yesterday, a week before Thanksgiving, in a test of will power billed as the third annual "Great American Smokeout." Last year, a Gallup survey said 5 million of the nearly 15 million who tried to quit for the day lasted at least 24 hours, and the American Cancer Society, which sponsored the effort, was optimistic that at least that many would make it again. Many communities and American Cancer Society chapters staged festivities for the Smokeout. It began as a one­day anti-smoking campaign dreamed up by a Minnesota newspaper publisher in 1974. The Smokeout was started by Lynn Smith, a Monticello, Minn., weekly newspaper publisher and reformed smoker. The idea spread to California and was finally adopted ona national basis by the Cancer Society. -AP 
FBI directorWilliam H. webster said yesterday the agency is not discounting a man held on federal charges in Salt Lake City as a suspect in the sniper attack on a civil rights leader in Fort Wayne, Ind. Ata breakfast session with reporters, William H. Webster said avowed racist Joseph Paul Franklin "has not been eliminated as a possible suspect" in the shooting last May ofcivil rights leader Vernon E. Jordan. Franklin, 30, is being held in Salt Lake City on federal civil rights charges stemming from the shooting of two black joggers· there last Aug. 20. Franklin has pleaded innocent. Discussing a recent surge in attacks on blacks, Webstersaid, "We've had this belt of crimes across the country in several cities, starting in Salt Lake City, the Vernon Jordan shooting, shootings in Ohio and Indianapolis." Noting that Franklin has been charged in the Salt Lake City shootings, Webster added, "It wouldn't be appropriate for me to make accusations other than that with which he is charged, but I am confident that that belt ofactivity will stop...! think that was a significant arrest."-AP 
Walter Polovchak, the 13-year-old Ukrainian boy who is in the midst ofa court battle over whether he can remain in the U.S. against the wishes ofhis parents, will visit Notre Dame this weekend. Polovchak will be presented with a football by Moose Krause, take a tour ofthe campus and then be a guest of honor at a luncheon with Fr. Hesburgh. Afterwards, the boy will view the football game from a seat on the 50-yard line. Duane Beckmer, a South Bend resident and a self-professed "student of history," will be Polovchak's guide while he is here. Bcckmer conceived the notion of the visit because the boy is" sports-minded," he said, and"if the decision should go against him, at least he'll have the memories ofhis day htre." Polovchak especially wished to speak with Hesburgh, Beckmer added, because of his interest in matters of civil rights. -The Observer

The Big Man on Campus (BMOC), a phrase out ofthe chauvinistic days ofracoon coats which now 
. must read BPOC, exists on campus today, and the BPOC's type may be divided many ways. Larry Siems is ofthe sort known as "the literary man on campus," though he doesn't wear a tweed jacket and you'll see him smoking a pipe only under the most unlikely conditions. 
He is editor of The juggler, the literary publica­tion on the Notre Dame campus. And as Playboy used to ask of its potential advertising clients "What kind ofman readsPlayboy?", we went to Mr. Siems to ask "What kind of person reads The Juggler?" Why? Whatkindofmanedits Thejuggler? These were the questions. 
And the answers we received led us to believe that Mr. Siems has had to think 
of those questions recently.. and more: who should be reading The]uggler, what should be represented as literature in that once-a-semester publica­


tion, and who should write for it. 
An editor should think these things through occasionally, and Mr. Siems is being request­ed to do just that by the University, who finances the· feisty literary publication along the order of$6,000 a semester. We thought we would ask the same sort of questions. 
When the word elitist enters the conversation, Mr. Siems gets uncomfortable, not because he does not want to answer the question but because he has heard the word before and knows that people take his response to the word the wrong way. 
"The experience of sitting down and reading a book is an experience enjoyed by very few people these days," he began with a long, thoughtful drag ofhis cigarette. "Literature is not something that (today) you enjoy on a day-to-day 
basis-andmodernliteraturehasproducedakind of literature that is especially difficult." 
Literature, he said, is published today for a smaller group of people. "So you could say," he concluded, "that literature is elitist in its publication, yes." 
And The]uggler specifically? That's the question its editor and his editorial board have had to deal with lately, fall being their season to read the texts submitted to them by undergraduates, graduates, faculty, Saint Mary's women, and others interested in the life and breath of literature at this University. 
"The ideal is to fill the magazine with under­graduates ... period. That is what I'd ~lways,hoped to do," Mr. Siems pointed out. But the reality of

editing demands that decisions be based on literary standards. "I think that the artistic talents of the people here are undercultivated. And it's really hard to make blanket statements about the abilities of the students here-their abilities to write literature-because they haven't had a great deal of training in literature, nor do they have a great deal of interest in literature." 
It does not take an excess of imagination to reduce that tastes in literature often do not
.. 

coincide, and it should surprise no one that the holder of the magazine's purse strings has appinted four faculty members and a member of the Office of Student Activities to oversee the editors in the deliberations. 
Although the idea of censor­ship annoys Mr. Siems, he takes with resignation the fact that this situation reflects the plight of publishing today generally. 
"It's the same everywhere, really. Although here it is more bound up with moral traditions, it is sort of an attutude preva­lent in the publishing industry everywhere: the product must be a consumer good" 
Does that suggest that The 
juggler must serve the masses? Whether it does or not, Mr. Siems is not happy with the idea. He is annoyed by censor­ship, butintheendhemayhave 
to buckle under to the demand of his financial overseers in a manner roughly analogous to the commercial publishing industry. 
He says that is not the way it should be. "The university is the one place that should be allowed to do literature for the sake of doing literature," without the constraints of restrictive standards of acceptableness, withoutanyconstraintssavethose of the literary world, a world that deals with ideas and structures and never rejects a work on the basis of its view of life. 
Mr. Siems is not yet ready to say that any of the works submitted to him have been rejected on that basis, or even that he is under pressure to reject them. But in the meantime he's looking for lots of texts, and he will be judging them on their literary merjt. Someone, after all, has to be the literary ~ man on campus.

Gideons visit ND campus 

By Mary Fran Callahan Senior Copy Edrtor 

Standing in brisk November winds yesterday, the Gideons­an international non-profit Christian association-distri­buted free copies of their bibles to the student body. 
Th! organization is the same one responsible for supplying hotel rooms nationwide with their bibles. 
Fr. John Van Wolvear, vice president for Student Affairs, said that he had approved the Gideons' visit to the University long in advance. 
"It's not like the Moonies at the football games. Those are the people we go after. They're (Gideons) not violating any of our rights, and we're not vio­lating theirs. They have per­mission," Van Wolvear said. 
Both local and out-of-state Gideons asked students if they received their"free gift" as bibles were offered. 
Acting Director of Campus Ministry Fr. John Fitzgerald explained that the Gideon bible is accepted in the Catholic church. He said their version used to be controversial but now is considered a universally Christian bible. 
"There are a few books in the Old Testement that were not included," Fitzgerald said, "but 
Parisian collection opens 
A rare collection ofdrawings of Paris completed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, never exhib­ited before outside the Musee Carnavalet in Paris, will formally inaugurate the Print and Drawing Galleries of The Snite Museum of Art on November 23 at the University of Notre Dame. 
The exhibition of 104 drawings includes works by such important artists as David, Prudhon, Girodet, Chassiriau, Gericault, Guys, Signac and Fantin Latour. Also included in the display are works by Dauzats, Forain, Bailly and lsabey. 
An American tour of the drawings was organized by John Dobkin, director of the National Academy of Art in New York City.

this bible contains just the New Testement and the psalms and proverbs, and that is the same." 
Fitzgerald applauded the Gideons' gesture saying the group was "dedicated to sharing the word" 
Wendall McClinton, assistant director of the national Gideon headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, explained the organizational makeup of the group. 
"We are a non-profit group of businessmen and professionals who work in 126 countries in 51 languages," McClinton said. 
The spokesman added that the Gideons receive all financial support by donations from members and churches. The Gideons who travelled to South Bend yesterday paid their own fares as well as helped finance the bibles they distributed. 
McClinton said the Gideons date back to the late 1800's when a group of travelling salesmen founded the Christian organi­zation. The Gideons first began supplying hotels with their bibles in 1908. 
"Most any first-class hotel today will have one in the room," the assistant director comment­ed. He added that the organi­zation also provides hospitals and college campuses with the bibles. 
Alfred Englebert, a Gideon from Warsaw, Indiana explained his motivation for supplying the organization with his money and 
his time by simply saying, "A person has to make a choice in 
his life one way or another. That's why I'm doing this."

This Sunday the Farm Labor prgani?ing Committee at Notre Dame will sponsor a day in honor ofthe migrant farmworkers. The purpose of the day is to observe the plight of these laborers who follow the harvest throughout America. 
These men, women and children are an integral part of the multimillion dollar food­providing and processing in­dustry. Without the help ofthese fieldhands the farmers in many sections ofour nation would find it extremely difficult to bring their crops to the marketplace. 
They make it possible for Americans to enjoy the plentifulR harvest which graces our dinner table. 
This contribution to the American economy is consider­able, yet seldom mentioned. Yearly, the migrants are respon­sible for harvesting in excess of $50 million worth of vegetables. Our entire system of vegetable farming is based on the availability of migrant fieldhand labor. This value to local economies is also substantial as they annually spend 60 percent of their wages in these communities.

'Gang of Four' trial begins 
PEKING(AP)--Chairman Mao Tse-tung's widow, the once­r,owerful leader of the radical 'Gang OfFour," walked calm­ly into court yesterday and with nine other defendants heard charges they persecuted nearly 3~,000 people to death and brough"untold disasters" to China. Her composure desert­ed her during the reading of the charges and she broke into tears, Chinese reporters said. 
The long-awaited trial of China's much publicized "Gang," as well as six mem­bers of the "Lin Piao Clique," got under way before 3~ judges and 880 invited observers in a courtroom not far from Peking's central square. The 10 could face death sentences if convict­ed. 
Seven minutes of film of the trial were shown on Chinese television, with promises of more detailed coverage in the days ahead. Foreign reporters were barred on grounds state secrets would be discussed. 
It was the first public look at the defnendants since their imprisonment from four co nine years ago. 
The bespectacled widow Jiang Qing, 67, her jet/black hair cut short and brushed back from her face, entered the courtroom escorted by a female guard and, head held high, looked around slightly. 
The leader of what now is called the "Jiang Qing Clizue" lost her composure and wept at one point, Chinese reporters said. They said soe of the other defendants shed tears as well. Two of the elderly male defendants apparently had to be helped to their seats. 
The opening session was devoted to the reading of the 20,000/word, 48/count indict­ment against the 10, who sat in a row in front of microphones. They were separated by metal bars from each other and from and stage an armed coup, possibly with Soviet help, in 1971. They have been in custody since then. 
The Xinhua news agency said five of the defendants had asked for lawyers. It said Jiang Qing rejected all three lawyers suggested to her when they refused to subtitute for her in answering questions in court. The agency mdicated she would be conducting her own defense. 
Summing up the charges, prosecutor Huang said the 10 had tried to overthrow the 
Mine shaft collapses 
JEFFERSON ISLAND, La. (AP)-an abandoned salt mine shaft 1300 feet deep collapsed yesterday, draining a lake with an enormous whirlpool, sucking in an il rig and a tug boat and threatening to cave in a small salt island. 
"We've ordered the island evacuated. There is the paten­tail for the island to cave in. We're not taking any chances,' said Wayne Knack, district manager of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administra­tion office in Dallas. 
Officals said no injuries were reported. 
There was no immediate information about the number of people onJefferson Island, a salt dome that supports a Diamond Crystal Salt Co. mine and related operations, a tourist garden and some oil operations in the midst of the southern Louisiana marshes. "Picture a bowl with no bottom and you're pouring a thick mixture of flour and water and it's just going down and down, government and split the state; tried to engineer an armed rebellion; had people injured or murdered, framed and perse­cuted people and conducted demgogical propaganda, all for counter-revolutionary ends; ex­torted confessions by tonure, illegally detained people and led counter-revolutionary cliques. 
The total number listed as persecuted to death now comes to more than 34,824 higher than the number known from pre­viously released excerpts of the indictment. 
greenhouses, you name it.'' 
Sheriff Romo Romero said 
his biggest problem was 
keeping thrill seekers from 
riding boats to the lake. The 
area is lacd with natural gas 
pipelines, he said, and one had 
broken, although it had not 
caught fire. 
The area was blicked off, and the Federal Aviation Ad­ministration restricted flights for three miles around the one and a half mile diameter lake. 
All seven men of the rig and the ~0 men in the mine escaped safely, according to offictals at Diamond Crystal and Texaco Oil Co. 
Officials said the tourist gar­dens were being developed at great expense. 
Gullies dug by the water's force led into half/ mile wide crater, where half a dozen salt . barges floated along with a sinking house trailer and many trees, said Ed Bowie, who flew with Piazza.

working relationship personal­

and Reagan discussed the 
transition and ''some of the 
issues I have facedc as presi­
dent.'' 

Carter emphasized that he 
and Reagan are in agreement 
that the outgoin~ chief execu­
tive will be president "in the 
fullest sense of the word" until 
Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. 
The meetin~ ran far longer than the 30 m10utes originally shceduled, and Carter said the two leaders emphasized "some of the common commitments we share." 
A short time after the meet­
ing, Carter left the White 
House for a visit to Camp 
David, Md. 

Although the White House meeting had been planned for several days, the two men and their wives actually encoun­tered each other is a less than planned fashion. 
The Reagans arrived at the sun-bathed South Portico of the White House one minute early, at 1:59p.m. EST, and the president and his wife, Rosa­lynn, rushed out of the Diplo­matic Entrance there to greet them. 
The president and the presi­dent elect grinned broadly, each looked at his watch,and Reagan acknowledged that he was "a little bit early." 
"We're very glad to have you here," Carter told his successor and the incoming first lady, Nancy Reagan. ''I think you'll like the place. " 
Carter then escorted Reagan to the Oval Office-as much a symbol of presidential power as it is a workspace-and Mrs. Carter took Mrs. Reagan on a White House tour, two months to the day before the Carters 
move out and the Reagans 
move in. 
The Reagans arrival by mo­
torcade from their government 
owned residence onehalf block 
from the White House was 
heralded by the wail of sirens 
from police escQrt motorcycles 
driven by the same corps that 
had ushered Carter around 
Washington for four years. 
In addition to more than 100 
reporters, photographers and 
technicians who witnessed the 
arrival, there were numbers of 
White House staff members, 
some with cameras, awaiting 
the new ftrst familv. 
But no one feered from the 
windows. The TRulman bal­
cony, where Carter family 
members often watched arn­
vals of other dignitaries, was 
empty except for some fading 
yellow chrysanthemums. 
A butler dressed formally in 
a black suit and white bow tie 
opened the green doors of the 
Diplomatic Entrance just 
seconds before the Reagans' 
limousine drew up-and nearly a 
minute before the Carters 
appeared. 
Although the logistics of the visit took considerable advance planning by the Reagan and Carter staffs, Carter had no formal a~enda for the confer­ence, srud White House staff director Alonzo McDonald. 
"I don't think any one of them needs any kind of special preparation,'' he said. ''These are very special kinds of meet­ings. It's not appropriate to have a lot of staff work. These are very SJ.>ecial people who are very rare 10 the world.'' 
Before traveling to the White House, Reagan was given a second consecutive briefing on national security matters by CIA director Stansfield Turner. 
Then the president-elect met 
for about 45 minutes with early 
congressional supporters of his 
campaign. One member of the 
group, Rep. Bob Badham, (R., 
Cal.) produced for Reagan's 
autograph a copy of a Van 
Husen shirt advertisement 
which featured Reagan as a 
model in the Life magazine 
issue of Dec. 12, 1953. 
The advertisement was 
issued at the time Reagan was 
starrin~ in the movie ''Law and 
Order' and it bore the legend: 
"Won't Wrinkle Ever." 
Reagan looked at the ad and 
said, ''I was never that 
young." 

He was also presented, by 
Rep. Carroll Campbell, (R., 
S.C.), with a new political 
button. 

He read its message: "re­elect President Reagan '84."

A -theatrical production is obliga­ted not to the audience, not the cast, nor even the scrip~ but to the art of theatre. By tapptng the creative energy which binds all elements of a production into a unified whole, the production reasserts itself as an art form every moment. This energy allows the actors to burst through their characters and transport the premiere mainstage produc~ion of A Way OutofNo Way spices Waslling­ton Hall with this theatrical magic.

Michael, a small elderly man of 
seventy-eight sat hunched in his 
wheelchair. His feeble hands, crippled 
by arthritis, were clasped in his lap. His 
firte gray hair was matted, his eyes were 
covered with a film, and cookie crumbs 
covered his lips. He was dressed in a red 
flannel shirt and his legs were covered 
with a red lap blanket. His green eyes 
seemed to be staring at the paper cup 
ofwater before him but I knew better­
Michael was blind. 
This first meeting with Michael 
began a semester of weekly visits. I 
would come to his room and listen to 
him relive his "better days" of hard 
work and a night life. I felt like I was 
really giving this man a lot by coming 
to talk one hour a week, but I came to 
realize how much more I was receiving. 
This realization came to me only 
after thinking about and sharing my 
visiting with o·~hers who were doing 
similar projects. This sharing came 
through a one-credit course called 
ReHections on Service. 
It met once a week for an hour and a half to discuss reflections on a few assigned readings in relation to the experiences of service; the groups were very small; and members worked with various programs. This same opportunity is being offered again next semester. 
If you were to take the course you would find that the few required readings and journal entries complement the open discussions about the service, writings and readings. The group provides a support for your service work and it is a 
Seminars 
sharing of the diverse services. Whether you tutor eight-year-olds or 
juvenile delinquents, whether you visit 
the sick or the elderly, thetaare many 
shared feelings. 
This one-credit course is one of those checkmarked courses offered as experiential learning in which books are not the main source of information. The "human document" becomes a main source of knowledge. Another such course is the three-credit Theology and Community Service which is the same type of course on a more comprehensive scale. Each student visits two residents at a nursing home weekly. 
The seminars are groups of approximately eight students discussing more readings and journal entries directed toward old age and working with the elderly. Ti).ese students then tie up the semester's experiences in a case study of one resident which ends up to be more ofa study of relationships and your own growth over the semester in facing issues of human relations, aging, dying and compassion. 
More information and preregistration for these checkmarked courses can be found at the Center for Experiential Learning, Memorial Library, Room 1110 (Phone: #2788). Usually, the enrollment is limited, requiring interviews of those interested, so it is important to sign up quickly.

ties. B'elief is neither selfishness nor 
r ecentricity. It is the knowledge that one can create; one can reach deep within oneself and produce palpable life. Jensen focuses the actors' beliefs and energy upon a production and th~ stage comes alive. 
A Way Out of No Way is the recreation of the early yeats of Sojourner Truth, a black woman born a slave in New York, who proclaimed herself free at seventeen, and fought for civil rights the re'st of her eighty-odd years of life. Jensen uses this woman to set the script within a historical perspective, a perspective which acts as a spring­board for various themes. Theatre ttirns relationships into displays and the relationship most prevalently displayed withm this play is the relationship between the black heri­tage and the white hertitage. The plot ia a fluctuation of this relation· ship. 
The unifying force that binds t_he two, and is stated from the begin­ning, is God. ''The same stars shine on everyone," Mama Bert states. The {>lay moves forward by the inabihty of the characters to recog­nize this, to step beyond the limits of their narrowmmded worlds and ac­cept human commonalitY. 
Of the twelve members in the cast, one is black. The ability of white people to assume black roles leaves a bad taste in one's mouth lingering back to the Showboat days 
. of blackface, ragged clothing, and AI  ]olsen, but the cast leaps over their · racial obstacle. For one hour and forty.five minutes, they are black. Their performances stem from that creative energy and belief that Jensen has given them--each mem· ber of the cast was immersed in the slave tradition through research and determination to create. 
Rachael Patterson as Isabella 
gives her character the strength needed for the slave-girl to move through the play. Her two previous mainstage roles, Ma~gie, in Teeth n' Smtles, and Zinida, tn He Who Gets Sla.[>ped were adults who languored amtdst the frustration of their exis­tence. Isabella requires hope and childish vigor with a perceptive understanding of the situation. Patzrr· · terson manages to accomplish this, and J?Ortrays the charactet' s mental emottonal growth realistically. 
Adri Trigiani and Kathleen Macio manage to control their respective characters of Betsy and Tess using energies from their usual comic efforts to. sustain their serious roles. Mark Pizzato plays the disabled Ceasar well, although he sometimes had a tendency to overplay his characters when the focus is directed elsewhere. Tim Grothaus seems more relaxed as Dumont than he was as Bezzano in He, yet he has a tendency to be too rigid in his movements. 
Raul Aportela, in his first stint in a mainstage production plays the com­ic overseer, Catlin ana the Master, George well. He seems a little unused to his surroundings, how· ever, and exaggerated the theatrical~ i$m too much at times. Scott Thomas's proud Irishman, Nealy, and the slave; Thomas while energe· tic, do nots'eem to find pu.-pose ~ His relationship with the other charac· ters could be more defipite.

first push in the beginning, as does Mama Bett with her ftrey gospel speech. Her lines tend to get lost as she finishes a breath, however. 
Greg Delessandro plays a remark· ably fine performance as Bomefree. He tones down his usual ·comic m.annerisms to play the aged slave wtth tenderness. His speech relating Mama Bett' s death is one of the best in tht" show.. 
Every time Joe O'Brien speaks, he grabs the focus. In this, his third mainstage production, he relates well with other characters and is totally comfortable on stage. My only problem is with the interpreta· tion of Nl1.taniel as a New York City 
''jive nigger'' rather than a Southern "dirt nigger." There is a. difference between whip marks and heroin tracks, and ' this descrepancy takes away from the play's perspective. 
Regina Pratt's r;>ortrayal of the slave child, Rose Pnde, is one of the highlights of the show. Her bewil­dered face as she stands on the auction block capsulizes a history of injustice and depravity. Linking this character to her other character, the preacher who ap.~ears at the end, one sees the play s movement from slavery to freedom, from the silence of the auction block to. the voice ·proclaiming God's kingdom beyond the manacles of this life. · 
The main problem with all the actors is that the ardorous task of creating a character totally unlike oneself sometimes takes away the power of language. At times, the actors gloss over the focus that seems to be within the language because they are trying too hard to be the character. 
Brian Wolfe's set is the most. innovative design that has been seen on the mainstage since the All Over production, two years ago. The arrangement of the platforms shows a concern for the space Washington Hall provides. The rough-hewn tex· ture of the wood bespeaks the environment of the play. Wolfe's lighting also highlights the set, backdrop, and the characters. Mau. teen Ulicny's backdrop not only compliments both set and produc­tion, but masterfully evokes a sens1: of. the artistic "BEYOND". '" · Dee HaWfield's muslin costumes 
cleverly help the actors assume their various characters without constant costume changes. 
The music works in this regard also. The spirituals are sung weU' and are moving. Jordan's "No Mor~ Auction Block For Me," and Tri~i­ani's, "They L<;d My Lord Away ', stand out espectally. Jordan moving through a ''wax museum'' auction scen.e while singing is brilliant stagmg. 
Judging from the productions of Jensen's staged here, Lu Ann, Teeth n' Smiles, ancf A Way. (}ut Of No Way, she shows versanhty towards her craft. Her productions are be· coming more eclectic, theatrical, and 
~timulating. A Way Out OfNo Way 
ts her best work to date. Her directing is "educational" to educa· tional theatre. Every production is a learning experience for die actor the technican, and the audience. ' 
A' ~ay Out Of Np Way is engagtng for the audience. This production is an appeal for the spectator to work for himself to accept the play's intentions and the intentions of theatre on its own terms. J!le productio~ proves, that, not only ts to be black ts to be divine but the art of theatre is divine, also'.

TO A LONELY GOD 
I'm Dreaming of a Young Christmas 


REEL REVIEWS 
Loving Couples: a screwup 
The romantic comedy genre in American-film making is one of the most enduring forms of celluloid ex­pression. Since the days of Gable and Lombard, a plethora of classics has ridden the sprocket of'success. Loving Couples (a recent release showing at the Forum Cinema) does nothing to contribute to this noble heritage and is probably best forgotten. 
Billed as "an irreverent look at love, marriage, and infidelity" it is better described as irrelevent, and irrational. The film is nothing more then a classic example of why writers weaned on T.V., often do not make the transition to the silver screen succesfully. The screenplay was penned by Martin Donovan, who achieved notable success writing for shows like that staple of the rerun circuit; "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and the perenially bland "Room 222". Unfortunately, Donovan's dubious efforts as a screenwriter lack the chief allie he had during his days as a producer of video fodder, namely a tape of mindless cackling known as a "laugh track". Thus a line that got Karen Valentine oodles ofcanned laughs, when deliver­ed by Shirley MacLaine leaves the theatre filled with nothing but the sounds of munched popcorn. 
The basic story is more contrived then a National Enquirer article on Jackie O's sex life. Essentially, the plot has a continually horny real estate agent named Gregg (played by Stephan Collins, who's performance you probably slept through in last 
year's snoozer: Star Trek -The Movie) lusting for no apparent reason after a doctor named Evelyn (Shirley MacLaine, the well-preserved but hopelessly homely veteran, plays this part). Evelyn's pompous doctor-husband (stoically performed by gravel-voicedJamesCoburn) gets wind of his wife's affair from Gregg's live-in girlfriend Staphanie (a droll perfor­mance by Susan Sarandon). With the two couples effectively switch off, this should be the makings of a good screwball comedy, right? Wrong, the results are simply screwed up. 
First ofall Gregg is made out to be a travelling stud interested only in measurements. Thus having him lust after Shirley MacLaine is utterly sense­less unless he has a fetish for women who resemble balding sheepdogs. The audience is supposed to cheer Evelyn's desertion of her overbearing husband. Unfortunate they neglected to 
-~­

make him as a much of a cad as they could have resulting in her actions coming across as those of a bored spoiled wife. Rather then cheer Evelyn's actiotl.s, oursupposed heroine assumes a rather callous position in the minds of viewers. James Coburn's portrayal of Walther is a performance worthy ofMount Rushmore. At times, his usage of cue cards seems a distinct possibillity. 
Finally, Susan Sarandon's portrayal of a TV weathercaster clouds any abomination ever forced upon viewers in the Michiana area. Her complete ineptness as an on-air talent comes mostly from her lack of acting ability, rather then any efforts to poke fun at TV weathermen. 
The sole bright spot in this mixed bag is Sally Kellerman's portrayal of a nymphomatic seductress bent on tempting the virile Gregg. One gets the feeling Kellerman actually viewed 
RyanVer-4 
her role as somethong more then a quick influx ofcash. Unfortunatly, her role serves no real purpose other then to provide cheap titilation and provide the scriptwriter with a lazy way out of several situations. 
Even the most mentally deficient viewer cannot help but notice the numerous quirks, flaws, and gaffs in production. To say the storyline has so many holes it resembles Swiss cheese only allows me continue by saying the whole production reeks like Muenster cheese. In this day and age, ragged film splices are reserved for stories about wilderness families, and do not, have any place in a feature film from a major studio (Time/Life Films). Continuity problems abound. An example has Gregg wrecking his car in one scene, and him driving it in the next. This all adds up to a shoddy production that does not bide well as Time/Life Films first independent feature production effort. Producer David Susskind's venerable reputation picks up some tarnish that. even he ironically aludes to in this comment he made regarding the film: "It's remarkable, one day there was nothing, then a year later was 
Lov(ng CouPles. 
If it had not been for a scintillating companion, snores would have emanated from my mouth before the film's halfway point. What else can be expected from a film that continually offers the potential for entertainment, but frustrates it's viewers by not delivering. Such frustration inevitably leads to boredom, which is never a bargain at $3._50. 
·~ 
Nickie's Jeannie, the red-headed girl, has done more to change my life with a necktie than all the retreats I ever made. It was a Countess Mara necktie, costing, I believe, nearly thirty dollars. (In the days when I wore neckties regularly, my shoes--which were ox-blood brown from Tom MeAn's, at three­fifty a pair--and my suit tog~ther 
didn't cost anywhere near thirty dollars, but at that time, I still had my hair.) A face-lift couldn't have made me feel more youthful than that thirty dollar tie.Some men my age might spend ten titnes that amount on Geritol, and still fed like the Founding Fathers of Wrinkle City. All I needed was a Christmas tie, my first one in thirty years, and I felt like a kid again, as though I were sporting pores erupting wtth acne, transplanted from a teen-age group of Youth For Christ. 
Wearing a necktie is a religious experience, the first time you do it, when you're a middle-aged priest, used to the collar that commits you to Rome. Put off the old priest, put on the young man, you think as though you were undergoing a regular baptism of desire. Last Christmas Day, looking in the mir­ror, I felt like crytng, like a born-again Christian brought to TRUTH; my new Pierre Cardin shirt was tapered, for God's sake, to sheathe my figure in a gray pastel the color of cigarette ash. Fumbling with the buttons, I thought of the years of being bleakly bagged in Vatican black. "Who needs to be 
renewed by faith," I wondered, "if he could be a swell dresser. Who needs the Pope, if he can be styled by Harris rweed?" 
I don't need to be rwenty; but sometimes, walkin~ out in the even­ing, I like to be smtled at as a fellow with a bit of mischief left in his bones, tolerant of salty talkers on adjoining bar stools. I like to light cigarettes for pretty women in rooms where Bobby Short is playing Cole Porter tunes on the piano. Nothing could be more neutral than a cigarette, against a background of Gerswin, with Somebody Interesting on one end, laying her lacq_uered fingernails against your wnst to steady your hand, and you on the other end, administering a match. It is a ritual of the world by which one brushes a~ainst endless possibilities. Ideally, I m suppose to hate the world; and there should be no looking back. I never do look back, if looking back means wishing I had made other choices. But one can feel very happy, sitting in Sardi's, wear­ing an tmported shin, realizing that thts too. is part of faith: simply being yourself, one of the rank-and-ftle members of the Kingdom, without a uniform to give you an officer's identity. 
A flower vendor, coming in from the street, offers to sell you roses, as though there were someone you were going to talk to, to say the special things that roses signify. You shake your head: there is no one, but thanks for asking. Thanks for identi­fying me with husbands and lovers who bring home gifts. 

Sometimes, because of ordination, you feel that you've been seat,.cl int the lifeboats, out of harm's way, with the women and the children. You get treated as though you were not very real, a kind of Velveteen Rabbit issued from the Vatican. Even in mufti, I lack versimilitude, destitute of the dimensions of grace that would make me one of the Beautiful People; but at least, while I'm wearing my Countess Mara, they don't ask me about birth control. They don't ask me, in my Cardin shirt, if I believe in Fatirua. 
In a month, I will have owned my shirt and necktie for exactly a year, . and fashion has made me humble rather than worldly. Even as a swell dresser, I am umimpressive, with a permanent place on the stag-line of life. Last summer, in the restroom at the Rainbow Grill in New York, I got asked by a man if I'd like to dance with his wife. We were stran~ers, and he didn't know I was a pnest; but I could imagine a future scenario when a woman might realize she had once danced with her confessor. I told him I was sorry that I didn't dance. 
I could have told him I didn't carry credit cards, either, which is even more unforgivable at the Rainbow Grill than owning feet that don't do the rhumba. 
"My God," he said, "you're lucky.'' He stared unhappily into the mirror, and I was afraid that as one stranger to another, he was going to tomplain~ about his marriage 
"Old guys like us," he said finally, "should be home in bed." 
"Oh, you foo~," I wanted to 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
"Can't you see how young I look in the Christmas presents Jeannie gave me?iYour wife makes you old, but I don't have a/wifewho makes me old. I don't appreciate being called an old guy who should be home in bed." 
Shirts wear out, and ties get spotted. Illusions fade as quickly as they come. Christmas is a holtday when our clothes get replaced and our dreams get renewed. 
Oh, Jeannie, Jeannie, Nickie's Jeannie: doyou suppose this year, we could afford to send me to a Swiss clinic for a face-lift? Just a very little face job, an inexpensive one, so that my appearance can ,match my heart and my shirt? My shirt's not old, and my heart's quite young. It certainly doesn't help either one of us to have some stranger in the Rainbow Grill, calling your Griffin an old guy who should be home in bed. 
Jeannie thinks it's better for me to make a retreat. The Pope, if he knew, would think it better if I made a retreat. Pierre Cardin and Coun­tess Mara, if asked, would probably suggest that faith does more than tailoring can to keep young looks on the face of man. So I'll make a retreat. In black shirt and collar, I'll make a retreat, but I'll do it in Florida, where they won't notice if I'm old. I'll do it in Florida, where I cari search for the Fountain of Youth. 
Last year at this time, before Jeannie changed my life at Christ­lmas, I didn't even mind being over fifty.

ND women plays~ Dakota 
By Maureen H eraty Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's women's basketball team leaps from Division III to Division I tomorrow against South Dakota. Notre Dame combines two scholarship players, the first ever for Notre Dame women, and three tried-and-true veterans for a starting team. New coach Mary DiStanislao hopes to help the Irish bridge the gap between divisions. 
Perhaps South Dakota could give Notre Dame a few tips on playing in Division I for the first time. South Dakota made its Division I debut last year and compiled a 14-15 record, not bad for a first season. 
Four starters return to the South Dakota team, older and wiser, but hopefully not taller. Deb Peterson, a sophomore forward, stands 6' 4" in her stock-1

foul" after he slugged Irish center Gilberto Salinas who had appeared to have inadvertantly elbowed Mlynarski while going for a loose ball. 
The loss of Mlynarski, who head coach Marian Kozlowski called his team's "best player," was not the only significant loss for the Poles in the game.Justyn W eglorz and W ociech Rosinski both fouled out with the second period just past the half-way mark, leaving the Polish squad thin on the bench. 
"It was a fight on both sides," Kozlowski said through an interpreter. "I think our team lost because our best players fouled out. When Mlynarski was disqualified, it really hurt our play." 
It was just a matter of time until the Irish caught up with their weakened opponent and surged ahead for keeps with 7:36 remaining. Lead by Paxson, a 6­2, 180-pound sophomore guard, and his nine points in a little more !qan three minutes, th.e 
Irish  gradually added to  the1r  
lead.  
"Tripucka  plays  a  very  

sophisticated style of ball," said Kozloski of the Irish tri-captain who finished as the game's lead­ing scorer. "He is a very un­predictable player on offense. We knew before the game that he was the best player for Notre Dame." 
With Tripucka back in the line-up after being benched with four fouls early in the second half, Jackson up to form from the outside, Woolridge underneath and Sluby and Varner making their contributions, the Irish managed the 10 point win as Paxson sunk a 22-footer just before the buzzer.

ing feet. "] udging from last year's 
game," remarks coach DiStanislao, 
"this team will be tall and have 
good perimeter shooters." 
Notre Dame, however, picked up some tips by watching the Coyotes play against Northwest · College oflowa last week. "We'll . have to play defensively," DiStanislao states. "We're going1 to try to force turn-overs and get 
at them from the inside." 
DiStanislao thinks that Notre 

Dame depth will diminish the 
South Dakota height advantage. 
She also counts on the home­
team status to make this game a 
win for the Irish. The Coyotes defeated Notre Dame last year by 15 points in their home court. 
In making the jump from Division III to Division I tomor­row, Notre Dame could easily stumble in its first game. Last year, the Irish lost to the Coyotes by 15 points. Coach DiStanislao insists that "this year's team is different" because they can now match South Dakota's experience and talent. 
The Irish will rest for about 10 days after meeting South Dakota, but will prepare themselves to faceButleronDec. 1 attheACC.

Leading the bowl-bound Irish efforts will be the freshman Kiel, making his seventh straight start this season. Kiel turned in one of his best all-around performances of the year against the Crimson Tide, committing very few errors in that contest. 
"The best thing about our offensive effort against Alabama was the way we kept our poise," noted Devine. "We knew we were going against a great de­fense, but we used some mis­
direction  with  the  fu  
llbatks and  a few other th ings  
that  kept  them  awake.  We  

played a smart football game with a minimum ofmistakes, and that's what you need to beat a team like Alabama." 
Sophomore running back Phil Carter was back in the starting lineup after sitting out the last six weeks with a thigh bruise. The 5' 1 0" dynamo gained 84 yards on 31 carries, including a touch­down dive from the two. Carter and roommate Jim Stone have combined for 1 ,424 yards, 62 percent ofNotre Dame's rushing yardage total. 
,. 

The Irish aerial attack, show­ing little consistency this season, will get a stiff challenge from the Falcons experienced secondary. The military squad returns the entire unit from last year, headed by two-year starter Johnny Jackson, who rates among the WAC's best. 
Although Notre Dame owns an unblemished record (9-0) against the Air Force in a series dating back to 1964, Devine's personal mark isn't that perfect. His 1970 Missouri squaddropped a 37-14 decision to the Falcons, to give him an overall 7-1 slate. 
But no contest against the Air Force has ever loomed so largely for Devine. Saturday's game will not only mark his last at Notre Dame Stadium, bur will count as another important step in his team's quest to regain the top slot in the polls 
Once in the fall and oncli! in the spring, Notre Dame students are treated to an "all-sports" weekend ofsorts, one ofwhich we are presently in the midst of. This particular weekend started with last night's basketball victory over the Polish National team and continues with a hockey game tonight, a football game tomorrow, a women's basketball game tomorrow evening and a hockey game tomorrow night. 
Justlike having ESPN live in your own backyard. 
Of course, only the hardest line sports junkies will take in all five events, but as you plan ~ur weekend curriculum, let me offer this reminder: 
The students of this University have a moral obligati<;>n to whole-heartedly support the hockey and women's basketball team. 
Why? 

Because we asked for it. No, better yet, we begged for it, lobbied for it, demanded it and held up signs supporting it. 
Now, I have been warned by my editor that I 
·· would not"h::tve much room to make my point so (surprise!) let me get right to it. Last year there was some question as to whether or not Notre Dame would support either of these sports. The people who pull the purse strings were convinced .that both were a foolish waste ofmoney and they called on some pretty convincing numbers to make their case. For a while it appeared that they would have their way; until, that is, those now famous signs found their way to the basketball arena and,

consequently, the living 

Americans (thanks to the miracle of television) to make their fevered plea. 
SAVE HOCKEY and other minor sports 

Ah, the nobility of it all. Imagine all those 
martyred students dedicating themselves to the 
cause -even risking being seen on television, no 
less! They must have really cared, huh? 
Well? 
I guess the best way to put it is to say that right 
now the ball is in our court. We asked the 
administration to save hockey and other minor 
sports and, although reluctantly, they did just that. 
And you know they're just waiting to see the 
student body's reaction. 
Every man, woman and child that signed a 
petition, wrote letters to the editor or held up a 
sign supporting hockey and other minor sports 
has a moral obligation to be there tonight and 
tommorow to witness the fruits of their labor. 
After all, Notre Dame students are not

against the Irish. Air Force, a 38­13 loser to Notre Dame last year, has been forced to insert many new faces into key positions. Hatfield had to replace four-year starting quarterback Dave . Ziebart, whosetjustaboutall the Academy records in total offense and passing. Senior ScottSchafer runs the Falcon attack this fall. Schafer, like Notre Dame's Blair Kie!, also handles the punting duties, averaging 41.2 yards per kick. The 6-foot-2, 213-pounder 
possesses a strong arm, and has a favorite target in wide receiver Andy Bark. The pair · has connected on 41 passes for 675 yards and four touchdowns, 100 yards more than the total for Notre Dame's top duo of Tony 
Hunter  and  Pete  ·  Holohan  
combined.  
"Schafer's a gritty  quarter­ 

back," commented Devine. "Air Force might be a young football team, but they have great quick­ness and they're capable of putting together an emotional effort such as Georgia Tech did."
