Could stricter gun control laws help bring the soaring crime rate under control~ Or would more legislation only violate the liberties of law abiding citizens~ Two area residents with law enforcement experience debated the gun control issue Thursday night in the Library auditorium. 
The debate was sponsored by the platform committee of the 1976 Mock Democratic National Con­vention. which will be held at Notre Dame next March. Edward Chapleau, head trial lawyer of the St. Joseph County prosecutor's office, spoke in favor of stricter gun control laws before an audience of about 100. He was opposed by Howard Williams, a Notre Dame law student, former Indiana University policeman, and an avid pistol target shooter. 
"We are in an arms race within this country," Chapleau began. ·'We are in a society where han­dguns are very commonplace, ordinary things." The prosecutor cited the ease with which two potential assassins of President ~·ord obtained their weapons as an example of the danger of readily available firearms. Easy access to guns encourages criminal activity, Chapleau continued, and probably contributed to a near-record 17 per cent increase in crime last year. 
"Fifty-three per cent of the 19,500 murders in the U.S. in 1974 were committed with handguns," said Chapleau, citing FBI stat­istics. "One-fourth of the aggravated assaults and one-third of the robberies also involved guns. 
Gun control legislation wouldn't cure everything, but it would be restrictive." 
More rigid laws would also lessen the incidence of accidental shootings and murders committed in passion, Chapleau predicted. And they would probably afford greater, not less, protection for homeowners. Only two per cent of gun owners who are confronted by robbers in their homes actually shoot the invader, said Chapleau, and ''a lot of times its the robber who comes out alive and the homeowner who comes out dead." 
To combat the "arms race," Chapleau recommended requiring the registration of every gun with both the federal and state governments. In addition, all guns should be licensed by local authorities, said Chapleau, and firearms sales strictly regulated. The prosecutor maintained his provisions would restrict the easy circulation of handguns, make them easier to trace, and not seriously impair the rights of sportsmen and other honest cit­izens. 
Sportsman Williams disagreed, declaring "law abiding firearms owners are sick of being blamed for crime." Pistol shooting is an old sport in this country, he cont­inued, and "is engaged in by 20,000 people who do nothing more violent than poke holes in a piece of paper­-they are not the criminal element.'' 
Sen. Birch Bayh's <0-Ind.) anti­gun proposal, said Williams, would have outlawed Wyatt Earp's gun (gun> with its 12-inch barrel." And tighter firearms restrictions would be "an invitation to civil disobedience among the population.'. 
Williams, who has written five 
articles for American Rifleman,

magazine, said that organization

gun laws. Strong local laws have not succeeded in slowing the homicide rates of New York, Chicago, Detroit or Washington, D.C., he added. And besides, said Williams, "the danger of being shot is less than that of drowning in your bathtub." 
Williams further maintained that most gun control proposals would violate the second amend­ment to the Constitution, which says, "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' 
Chapleau had cited the case of 
ll.S. v. Miller, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment did not guarantee the right to own guns outside of "well regulated militias." Williams said he disagreed with both Chapleau's and the court's interpretation. 
The Chapleau-Williams debate was the second of a series held in preparation of the writing of the convention platform, which will be sent to Michiana legislators for their consideration. Next Thur­sday night, two speakers will discuss legalizing marijuana

The primary concern of most students is their education. ROTC comes second on their list of priorities. However, in Navy ROTC this does not seem to be the case. The fact that ROTC is more demanding than the other services is not a fault. Captain King W. Pfieffer is a graduate of Annapolis. He has taught at the Federal German Naval Academy and has served on the Joint Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C. Pfieffer's background is traditional military and one of distinguished service. Secondly, Navy ROTC is the only service which commissions its graduates as regular Navy of­ficers. The other two service give  specialty field. For example, the Army would send its ROTC of­ficers to infantry school or armor school. The Air Force trains its new officers as pilots, navigators, personnel managers, or missile specialists. The programs are not designed to be demanding. Also, the commanders of Army ROTC, Col. Alvin J. Gendron and Air Force ROTC, Col. Norman E. Muller, are ROTC graduates themselves. Consequently, they are not sticklers for rules. One point of contention with Navy students was the "chit" disciplinary system. Some students said that the officers were liberal in their distribution of chits for such infractions as hair cut and uniform regulations. Others said the cadet otficers were likewise liberal in giving chits. Navy ROTC is the only unit which drills for a full year. To many of the freshmen and sophomores drill is "walking around in circles in the parking lot." Gendron said the Army unit drill  semester. The unit will engage in classroom leadership training. When the unit is drilling, the sophomores are given more responsibility than Army and Navy sophomores. A number of complaints were received about the Navy in­structors. No major complaints were received about the Army and Air Force instructors. Some Air Force engineering students complained of being overworked. The Army is the only service which allows its new officers to go to graduate school. The Air Force allows its ROTC officers to go to medical school. Gendron sums up the Army's philosophy as "looking for a well­educated student with a degree." Each program has a different emphasisand different advantages and disadvantages. Each of the programs is run by highly com­petent men. Both Gendron and

With the exception of seniors, any other student is permitted one co-ex course per semester. 
Senior status allows a student t­wo co-ex courses per semester. Other students are permitted one co-ex course per semester, if the course is not in their major. 
Any exceptions mut be taken care of through Gail Mandell, assistant to ~the vice-president for academic affairs. 
One advantage to co-exchange courses is that certain of them fulfill core requirements for graduation. Kennedy mentioned Religious Studies and Speech and Drama courses as examples. 
The system between St. Mary's of bringing about a closeness 
and Notre Dame was adopted to safeguard the 3000 credits per semester limit set up by the two schools, Kennedy explained. 
"It can allow for as many as 1,000 co7exchange courses a semester, with one-credit.courses such as band allowing for even more," the registrar explained. 
Kennedy added, "We think it's going very well. Both registrars have worked very closetohelp any student."

One, two credit courses at SMC 
by Liz Merrell 
Starr Reporter 
Pre-registration for students at SMC is underway. Any student who is 1 or 2 credits short should consider one of the following courses, new to the SMC curriculum. 
The Humanities Department is offering a course entitled, "Love in the Western World." It is a historical view of the changing Western aspects of love, sex and marriage, as well as the changing attitudes towards women and their role in society. 
Dr. Bruno Schlesinger, in­structor of the course and head of the Department, plans to integrate the art, literature and music of the various periods along with in­cluding new insights into the history of family life. 
The class will meet Monday and Wednesday at 3:25 p.m. and 2 credits will be given. 
A one-credit course entitled "Film: Images of America" has been added to the curriculum in the English Department. 
According to the instructor, Max Westler, "We will be considering film as the expression of a mythology, peculiarly American." 
He plans to spend part of the bicentennial celebrations discussing and evaluating the fugures and themes that haunt the national cinema. 
Fifteen films will be shown throughout the semester, in­cluding: "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington", "My Darling Clementine", "Duck Soup" <Marx Brothers), "It's a Gift" (W.C . Fields), "Citizen Kane", "Rebel Without a Cause", and films by Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks and Buster Keaton. 
The films will be supplemented by four readings: Huckleberry Finn, Whitman's Song of Myself, The Great Gatsby, and a collection of short stories by Ernest Hemingway. 
Westler said there will be no 
examinations or papers, but that 
attendance will be required. The 
lecture course is open to all 
students and will meet on Monday 
and Wednesday at 3:00. There will 
be a registration fee of $7.50. 
A new course, initiated by two 
members of the SMC Art Depart­
ment entitled "Frontiers", is 
concerned with exposing students 
to various aspects of art in ways 
that they would not experience 
through a traditional program. 
The objectives of the course are 
to develop a non-classroom 
oriented environment in the hopes 
between the students and faculty in a manner more related to the art lifestyle and actual mode of creating. 
Seminars will be based on such things as the relationship of time to Art, and an experimental video piece done in South Bend. 
The class is open to Art majors for two credit hours who wish to develop an openess and awareness of oneself and the real world.

Student Government has completed no major action since the beginning of the semester since all the work has been "in process" up till now, according to Ed Byrne, student body president. 
Items such as a calendar change and a new food co-op are still in the planning stage, he noted. He cited the Armory Dance and Student Government's report to the Board of Trustees as his completed ac­tion. 
Byrne structured his election platform on promoting 1) reorganization, 2) communication and 3) representation. 
Reorganization 
Under reorganization, he proposed the SLC, HPC and Student Union form a cabinet of

Darby O'Gill, noted campus with and proprietor of Darby's Place, has announced a Thanksgiving party for students who will be staying on campus during break. The announcement was made through O'Gill's spokesman, Fr. Robert Griffin, University chaplain, who has been delegated the job of raising funds for the project. 
The party is scheduled for Thanksgiving night and will be patterned after last year's highly successful social event. It will feature buffet snacks and most likely a movie for lonely-and hungry-darners. 
Fr. Giffin will be asking for cont­ributions to this worthy project at his masses. He would be glad to have the help of any volunteers to set up the project. The Om­budsman also may be assisting.

Student Government which would eliminate duplicate commission's efforts on the same project. 
"I have met with HPC Chairman Elton Johnson and Student Union President Tom Bursic," Byrne stated. "However, we never got to the point of weekly meetings like I wanted last year. When we did, it turned into 'show and tell' since the work had been carried on by each of us alone as routine business. We were just keeping each other up to date since no major policy decision had come up," he said. 
Byrne cited the importance of keeping in close contact with the SLC, HPC and the Student Union. SBVP Tom Fitzgerald intended to attend every HPC meeting, but has not gone to recent meetings because he had mono, Byrne ob­served. As a result, no one from Student Government has attended the last few meetings. Byrne at­tended only the last one because he realized "no one had gone to the meetings since Fitzgerald has been sick." 
Communications 
In last year's platform, Byrne proposed to improve com­munications between Student Government and the students by issuing a newsletter and by meeting regularly with hall representatives to coordinate inter-hall and inter-quad action. 
"We probably will not publish a 
newsletter this year after all," 
Byrne said. "Last year wethought 
it would be a good idea because we 
could not get our message across 
without having misleading articles 
appear in the Observer," he cited. 
"So far this year it has not been a 
problem." 
Discussing hall inter-action, he

commented~ "I have not satisfied myself with what we have done in this area," adding later that "I probably should not be so negative about it, though." 
The Social Commission spon­sored the Armory Party and some of the halls have organized smokers, parties and tutoring programs, he noted. 
Representation 
The final section of Byrne's campaign platform, represen­tation, included putting a student on the Board of Trustees. 
"We tried to get a student on the Board, but it was not received well," Byrne said. "I talked to five of the eight Academic Committee members at last spring's meeting and this fall's meeting, but they were opposed to it." 
"They felt a student member would represent just his con­stituents and may not act in the University's best interests. I do not agree," he said. 
"If a student were to get a place on the Board, one vote out of 40 would have little power in decision­making, Byrne observed. But he feels that if the Trustees were to 
agree  to  it,  it  would  be  a  
recognition  of  the  students  as  
competent people.  

"It would be a gesture of good will on the part of the Trustees to add a student member," he said. 
Food co-op 
The original food co-op failed this year, drawing a response of only five to 10 members, he noted. He attributed this to an inability to make the points clear to the students. He has written a letter scheduled to appear in Monday's

calendar schedules to be distributed among students, faculty and administrators as a survey. Tentatively, they will be distributed next Tuesday and collected next Thursday, he said. The top three will then be sub­mitted to the Academic Council if ten of the Council members agree to add it to the agenda. 
Byrne considers a calendar change hopeful since he noted Provost Fr. James T. Burtchaell and University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh said the calendar has not yet been "carved in granite". 

Letters to a Lonely 
from his bare tree 
reverend robert griffin 
besides gatsby, weekend uiewing abominable 
There used to be a student at Notre Dame who always seemed to have visited my room just before I got there, or who showed up in my room just seconds after I had left it. I knew he had visited me because of the notes he left; they were always unsigned, and poignant with chiding: "Where were you this evening when I might have talked to you?", he would write; "Life has become unbearable." Or, "I need you tonight. If matters got on like this, I may never face tomorrow. Why don't you let me talk to you?" He never left a name of phone number or a place where he might be reached. But he left me with plenty of guilt, as though I had deliberatly failed him: as though I had purposely walked off to the Huddle or the Grotto, knowing he would come to see me, not giving a damn for his suffering. 
I knew it was not a game or a deceit tarried on by trickers. I knew those notes were written by a human being full of pain and despair and self-loathing. I even knew that his problem was sexual because several times, at the beginning, he had told meabout himself in letters that were both anonymous and self-revealing; I com­forted him as best I could with words written in this column. Eventually all his correspondence was reduced to terse, little notes, written on scratch paper, tucked under a door or propped up on a chair; and I wondered if he were being deliberately delusive, like a shadow you can't catch up with; never coming when he knew I would be there, because he didn't want to meet me face to face. 
Yet there were hints, subtle and fleeting, as though he were trying to make a detective out of me, or as though he were testing me to see if I really cared enough about him to put all the hints together and eome up with an identity. Once, for example, he gave me his first name and last initial, and I spent half <tn hour reading through the students' dierectory, trying to come up with a match. Either he wasn't listed in that directory, or he withheld information that would have made a difference, because I couldn't recognize his name form the clue he had given. Once he left me what seemed to be an address. I wrote an ambiguous paragraph to that address, asking him .to see me; and mailed it in an envelope m­scribed with the given name and last initial he had furnished. Within a couple of days, the post office returned the letter as non-{ieliverable. 
1-:ventually, over a couple of years, he had furnished me with enough clues for me

The movies on Friday and Saturday nights are abominable. They are: Hustling, a look at the world's oldest profession and starring Lee Remick at

Two other films, however, to be aired are redemptive, exceptional and worth your viewing time: That's Entertainment and Tht-Great Gatsby can be seen this week. The Great Gatsby will be shown Sunday night at 9 on ch. 28. This 1974, $6 million adaptation of the Fitzgerald classic is a movie spectacular, one probably less faithful to the original text in terms of character and theme than it should be <the point on which the critics argued, you remember), but a film of such sensitive and dynamic proportions that it shouldn't be missed. We can wonder at whether the director and the producer even read the book, but we cannot help but be impressed by a film whose all star cast, overwhelming sets and musical score are in the true Old-Hollywood, (Knock-Them Out of Their Seats) tradition. It stars Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Karen Black, Sam Waterson and Bruce Dern. 
That's Entertainment can be seen Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Ch. 22, that 1974 salute to the movie musical-magic of Hollywood's yesteryears. And it IS entert­ainment, and a professional conglomeration of tremendous bits 'n pieces <those splendid, shining, show­stopping moments) such as Gene Kelly spouti Sin ' In the Rain or Judy 
to be certain of his status as a student, the department he worked in, and the place he was from. Then one evening, after a Mass at the Grotto, a friend told me of a chap he had met on the fringe of the crowd. The chap had asked, me friend said, whether I was Father Griffin; and from the remarks that he made, I knew that my note-writer had been staking me out. It was weird thinking of him standing there in the Grotto, hearing me, watching me, weighing my words; knowing I could never recognize him as the stranger that was stalking me for healing. One word could have old me who he was, but he never spoke that word. Yet I am con­vinced that he wanted me to know that he 
had been attending that mass. 
In the end, of course, I learned his name. It simply became a matter of putting information together, and then making quiet inquiries. But by then, I felt I must respect his reticence in speaking. There is a sensitivity a priest should not offend. It prevents him from rushing up to a stranger and saying: "Aren't you the fellow who's been hanging notes on my door?" What would the priest answer if the fellow were to reply: "I don't know Father. What did those notes say?"? 
Here, then, was my dilemma: a student gives signs that he wants to talk with me; but he never tells me who he is; he never meets me face to face. He could have called me up; he could have written for an appointment; he could have introduced himself after Mass; he could have waited until he found me home. Instead, he just tea sf's my min<J with hints of his identity. I don't know what he looks like, or whether I sometimes pass him on the quad, or if there are social occasions or casual places where, all unknowing, I catch glimpses of him. And if I should be formally in­troduced to this person whose name, rank, and serial number I am only halfway certain of-how can I be positive that he is the stranger whose trail I have been pursuing? What if I have misread the evidence? 
On the other hand, how could I handle the guilt if I learned of a suicide some morning, and I became convinced that the suicide victim had been crying out to me for help? 
Ultimately, I never confronted the student, but I never heard of his suicide, either. But up to the end, there were still notes--angry, heart-breaking, and full of abuse: "Where were you last evening? I

e at three in the morning, and you were asleep. I thought you were the chaplain who kept the night watch. I could have talked to you, but you were sleeping. Maybe you weren't sleeping; maybe you JUst wouldn't answer the door. It doesn't matter. I'm not worth your time. Maybe it will beoversoon for me. Save yourself for the kids who are worth bothering with." 
It may have been careless, but I never did try to confront the guy. I had to be sure he wanted to talk to me. He was playing a game of pretending that he never found me in. I didn't know why, but I tried clumsily

to guess. Sometimes when we pray and our prayers go unanswered, I thought to myself, we are afraid thereis nobody in the heavens listening no Presence in the tabernacle that c~res about us; and our mood is full of fear. The student who left me notes knew that I was real enough. It wasn't my existence he questioned, but my availability to him, and it gave him someone definite to be angry with, someone specific to blame. Since Ahab couldn' harpoon God, a critic has said, he tried to kill the Great, White Whale. Since my student couldn't attack God directly as the source of his suffering, he could attack me for his suffering as one, divinely delegated, who could have helped him, but didn't try. If he had applied to me for therapy, and I, doing my best, had failed him, hewouldstill have his problem, but he would have lost his right to be angry. He would have no one left to rage against. I'm not sure how he would have handled the difficulty of losing such a God-symbol as the chaplain, whom he could hold locally unaccountable and immediately responsible for the seeming delinquincies fo God. 
I never contacted the student. Maybe it was shabby logic masking cowardice that prevented me; maybe it was the instinct of the faith worker who comes up lucky. But one.September, there were no more notes on the door, and I knew that my angry young man had taken his degree. 
I wish I could offer you an end to this

If I had talked to this student, I'm not sure I could have helped him. God has no explanation except his own truth, and the truth of God's being is a mystery beyond out thought and language. At the heart of the mystery, there is a love we must describe in metaphors. It is a love that searches for us, as a shepherd goes in search of a lamb that is lost. It is a love that prepares a place for us, as in a mansion awaiting the return of the prodigal son. It is a love that comforts us, as when a father gathers children who have strayed or as when a mother hen

I wish I could have been in my room at the times when my note-wroter called. But the mystery is not he chaplain's elusiveness, but in the Lord's elusiveness.

I got a Christmas card from my student friend last year. It was unsigned, of course, but I recognized the writng that scratched out the printed versesforangelic messages and scrawled in stanzas of Ferlinghetti 's poem : "Christ climbed down-from His baretree-this year-and ran away to where-no fat handshaking stranger-... went around passing himself off-as some sort of North Pole sain­t ... bearing sacks of Humble Gifts-from Saks Fifth Avenue-for everybody's imagined Christ child ... " 
The words fat, handshaking stranger were underlined in red ink. I think there is a message there intended for me. I've gotten this chap's messages before.

by Kathy Mills General Assembly for approving t­He state the Senate resolution to : GORMET FOODS  Senior Staff Reporter he Zionism resolution. reassess the United States' further Secretary of State Henry A. participation in the U.N. is the :3114S.11 St. NILES, MICHIGAN: 
Notre Dame's president and faculty members have reacted differently to the recent!)'! passed United Resolutions resolution equating Zionism with racism. 
"It's silly. It's the kind of thing that can destroy the U.N. by politicizing it," stated Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president. 
Hesburgh added the resolution puts up a "dichotomy between the Third and Fourt Worlds." 
·'They should stop picking on the Jews." he said. 
Hesburgh said he thinks the l'nited States will take action demonstrating opposition to the resolution. 
"We'll probably stop some of the programs in the United Nations," he noted. "It's too bad, because they're good programs." 
He added he does not think the United States will withdraw from the United Nations. 
Isolation and Exile 
Rabbi Elliot D. Rosenstock, assistant professor of theology, remarked he is "sad" about the resolution. 
"It's the same story all over again -international exile," he stated. Rosen stock also termed the resolution a "threat to world peace." 
"I hope the U.S. and Israel don't pull out of the U.N.," he continued. "That's what the Arab states want, so they can do what they want." 
Referring to the Jewish people 
he knows, Rosenstock commented, 
''Everyone is upset. There is a 
sense of isolation." 
He added the people are grateful 
for the support the western 
European countries and America 
have shown. 
He noted the resolution has had 
some positive effects "It has 
united the world Jewish com­
munity," he pointed out, "and I am 
happy there has been no dissent on 
theAmerican stand." 
U.S. Leaders React 
Kissinger said the vote "has cert­ainly added to tensions and to the rift and distrust" in the Middle East. 
Prof. Donald P. Kommers of the Department of Government and International Studies stated, "To equate Zionism with racism is mockery and reduces the concepts of racism to meaninglessness." 
Kommers called the resolution a symbol. 
He said it will not amount to much in the long run, if it is ignored by the United States. He added he thinks the U.S. will ignore the resolution. 
Peri E. Arnold, assistant professor of government, said the resolution is wrong. "It reflects the existing ideological majority of the United Nations," he pointed out. "You can't say the majority vote means they all agree," he went on. "There is a highly politicized, fairly ideological coalition of worlds." 
Arnold said he would be sur­
prised if the United States reacts 
with financial cutbacks. "There 
will be some," he added, "but they 
will be small, symbolic ones." 
He stated the Unitee States 
should use words instead of 
financial power to indicate op­
position to the resolution. "But we 
should make it clear that this 
country opposes it," he noted.

To gather calendar opinions 
Academic Commission formulates survey 
by Cathy Nolan 
Staff Reporter 
The Academic Commission is continuing efforts to formulate an alternate calendar for the 1976-77 school year. 
The commission aims to present a proposal to the Academic Council whic reflects the views of the students, faculty and ad­ministration. 
A St. Mary's student took an independent survey at dinner last night on possible academic calendars, according to a St. Mary's senior. Results of this survey are not in yet. 
Dissatisfaction with this year's calendaraswellas the tentative '76­'77 calendar has been expressed by students, faculty and ad­ministration. 
Under the tentative schedule, 
classes will begin Sept. 8. There 
will be one break during the 
Thanksgiving holiday. 
Also included in this calendar 
are a Saturday night class and 
final exams past Dec. 20. No 
provision has been made for a presented to the Academic Council.

The Academic Commission has worked in conjunction with the Sociology Department to draw up a simple, but scientific survey as a means of gathering the opinions of the students. 
The commission has also sent a letter to ofer 200 universities and colleges, inquiring about calendar schedules. The commission will use this information as a basis of comparison to help develop a feasible calendar for Notre Dame. 
The survey will be conducted throught the halls. "The survey will be distributed at the HPC meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18. We are asking the hall presidents to then distribute the surveys to dorm residents," stated Gassman. "We want to have a total student response, not just a representative view." 
On the basis of this survey, the commission will work out a proposal for the 76-77 academic calendar, which will then be

presented to the council with the strong, united backing of the students and faculty, there is a greater chance for its acceptance by the council,",said Gassman. 
The commission also wishes to establish a set of guidelines for making a calendar to suffice for an extended period of time, rather than just one year. 
"Nobody worried last year about the date of Labor Day in 1976. They did not seem to realize that Labor Day was going to be much later," stated Gassman. "We (the Academic Commission ) have looked to the future, not just next year." 
When asked if any plans had been made to reschedule the National Men's Shepherd's Con­ference, Aug 24-28, 1976, Gassman 
' said that this option was being considered. 
The conference should not be given priority over the calendar, stated Gassman. "There is no need for the council to concern itself with the scheduling of the conference." 
"I think we are doing the best we can. We have done our homework. We have investigated and our efforts are at a maximum," said happen. Once we have submitted Gassman. "We have been working our proposal, it is thedecision:ofthe on the calendar proposal all Academic Council as to whether or semester. We cannot be overly not any schedule changes will be optimistic or pessimistic. It is made," the commissioner con­difficult to speculate what will eluded.
