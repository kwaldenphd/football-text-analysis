rrotest diversified by black students 
by Milt Jones 
Susan Jackson, president of ABCW, yesterday burned a written response she received from the office of Sister Alma which suggested the instigation of a task force to look into problems of black students at SMC. 
Miss Jackson termed the letter an insult becuase "it was a rough mimeographed copy with typing and spelling corrections made on the sheet, it was not dated, it had no signature and the envelope was not even addressed." Mter reading the statement in the lobby of Leman hall Midd Jackson burned it. 
The incidnet, which took place in a central point of traffic during the noon hour was witnessed by a substantial number of students. It was also covered by television, radio, and other press services. 
A series of readings and singing followed the burning. Readings included original poems by Nate Angle, a black ND student, some selected letters of George Jackson, and some reading from Black Rage.

Dear Dave and Mark: 
I would like to comment on your letter concerning my "new variant of the no-knok rule." Although The Observer is not always accurate in their quotations given during an in­terview, there is no way you could interpret their reporting to mean "no-knock." However, I would like to personally convey to you the University's position regarding rights of students to privacy in their rooms. It has always bee held here (as well as in the civil courts) that the student has a right to reaionable privacy and protection from room entry. This is not an ab­solute right. Any official of the University (Rector, Resident Assistant, Security, etc.) always has the right to enter a student's room upon reasonable suspicion that Rules of Regulations are being violated. It has always been the policy (explained to Resident Assistants each Sep­tember) that they should first knock and obtain permission. If they cannot obtain permission, they should report the matter to the Rector. No official of the University should ever enter a locked room if no one is there, unless in the company of another person. Needless to say, I am not talking about the maids. Hence, I assert to you once again that th Resident Assistants are not to b "policemen" (See Monday' Observer). 
In regard to your announce intention of violating Universit Rule No. 5 concerning th visitation hours established b Howard Hall, it is clear <Rule No. 5-<:) that "the staff, Hall Counci and students in each hall shall each be responsible for enforcing these policies." Your publicize intention to violate this rule amounts to a "charge o violation" against yourselves as individuals within the hall and, therefore, should "be brought before the University Board for appropriate action according to the principles of the judicial code." I am enclosing a blank copy of a NOtice of Violation which you may fill in with the appropriate details of the vilation and forward to me, with a request for a hearing before the University Board, if you manage to consummate the violation. You may, of course, exercise ynur right to a private hearing before Dean of Students if you prefer. 
Sincerely yours, Rev. James L. Riehle, C.S.C. Dean of Students 

American University of Beirut, will assume his duties around Auguest 1, Rev. James T. Burt­chaell, C.S.C., Notre Dame's provost, said in making the an­nouncement. 
Informed sources stated that Dr. Grande's termination as Admissions Director came as a result of a wave of clerical tie-ups in processing applications and his inability to maintain a good rapport with minority group applicants. 
Grande, who has directed Notre Dame's Admissions Office since July, 1969, holds master's and doctor's degrees in educational psychology and guidance from Notre Dame. As a member of the department of education faculty, he taught in the area of counseling, testing, and educational research bet­ween 1955 and 1965. 
He participated in a three­month Stanford University seminar on learning and the educational process in 1965 and then spent a year at the University of Chicago on a postdoctoral research fellowship. His appointment to head the newly created office of in­stitutional studies came in 1967. His institutional research has been primarily concerned with the analysis of student test data and the prediction of academic success, follow-up studies of Notre Dame graduates, and the development of an academic interest inventory. 
Goldrick, the recipient of both a bachelor's degree and a master's in counseling psychology from Notre Dame, served as an ad­missions counselor at Notre Dame between 1967 and 1970, specializing in minority recruitment programs. 
A native of Hamilton, Ohio, Goldrick taught in elementary and secondary schoolsfollowing his undergraduate training at Notre Dame. He also taught two years in a girls' secondary school in Thailand while in the Peace Corps.

College finds no chief 

by Greg Rowinski 
The Experimental College in the works for Notre Dame's Holy Cross Hall for several years now, will not be a reality, at least not next year, because of an inability to find a director. 
The Academic Council of the University of Notre Dame and the Academic Affairs Council of St. Mary's College "reaffirmed their support for an experimental educational program" after they learned of the problem, .eaving the opportunity for future ex­periments open. 
Dean Frederick Crosson of the College of Arts and Letters reported to the Counvil that the "Committee plan for a co­educational experimental sophomore year program cannot be implemented for want of a director," acc·ording to a Public Infromation release. All of the 13 committee members bowed out of the ddirectorship for various reasons. Crosson expressed the opinion that because "the nature of the proposal is so tied to the philosophy of those who planned, the search for a non-<:ommittee member would not be "feasible". 
The Council went on record requesting further suggestions on educational innovations, in­dicating that the experiment is far from dead. 
According to Student Govern­ment Academic Commissioner Bill Wilka, one of the writers of the experimental college proposals, the discussion of thz program at the meeting passed no further than the question of the directorship, delving into none of the other particulars. 
"Questions didn't come up," summarized Wilka, because of the inability to find a suitable head, which prevented any im­plemenation in September. A proposal to add members to the steering committee, in order to enlarge the field of possible directors, was doomed to failure, added Wilka because March "was too late in the year" to begin such efforts. 
However, Wilka also stated that many of thofe who had worked on the program would return next year and could renew their efforts in the future.

Watts Co. hailed by Mullane 
by Kevin McGill 

Mr. Wayne Mullane, Executive 
Vice-President of Aero··Jet 
Corporation, spoke to a seminar 
in Minority Business Planning 
yesterday about the establish­
ment of Watts Manufacturing 
Company. 
According to Mr. Mullane, the company was organized by Aero­Jet General to provide jobs for the people of Watts and hopefully to enable them to procede on to better and higher paying jobs in the business world. 
"Watts is a state of mind, not a physical condition," Mullane said. He pointed out that living conditions there are comparable to other working class districts in Los Angeles, but said that the problem with Watts, as with most ghettos, is that people, especially males, are unable to find work. The family balance is upset, and those people with ambition and intellegence use it only to get into trouble. 
Mullane said that he was op­posed to the building of hospitals and parks that has been done in Watts. He thought the large amounts of money wasted, as far as minorities are concerned, because the funds went to "contractors in Beverly Hills" who hired white construction workers. He mentioned that money that is put directly into the community, on the other hand, has a multiplying effect: it will exchange hands four or five times before it finally leaves the community. 
He also criticized training programs that try to make proficient craftsmen out of inexperienced people in short periods of time. "They get people's hopes and expectations up and they drop them." He said thwt the people would be unable to get jobs because they weren't really what their trainers had promised they would be. 
Aero-Jet is in the munitions business, and, Mullane said, as 
Vietnam war grew it ex­panded. The head of the Executive Committee, Mr. Kimball, pushed to have a plant established in Watts, since it was a source of cheap labor, after the

riots. 
"Our intention," said Mullane, "was to take the basic people who migrated from the Midwest and the South to Los Angeles, a cross section, to train them, employ them, and to let them move out to other industries." 
Trying to make their first contacts, Areo-Jet came across Jim Woods, the black owner of a construction company who lived in Watts and retained an identity with the area and its people. He and his son Leon were en­thusiastic about the idea and took over a lot of the management end. 
The worked they planned to ao according to Mullane had to employ primarily males. It had to have a high labor input with a minimum capital investment. Hopefully, the training period would be short so the employees would become productive soon and not become discouraged. He also desired the work to be dif­ferent from the other Aero-Jet concerns to avoid union trouble. 
The government had promised support, help with training, and contracts, but they ultimately lacked the authority to do what they had promised in good faith. The basic laws of procurements allowed them to finally give Watts Manufacturing a contract for making tents, but the red tape 
for  training  was  such  an  "ad­ 
ministrative  headache"  that  
Aero-Jet  finally  financed  and  

established a training program on their own. 
The training extended to filling out a time card and the proper dress for the job. A number of people from the black community were found for various semi­professional areas. 
Mullane said that the company, unlike government programs, gave its employees "the op­portunity to work, not the right to work," and that those who didn't work were layed off. This, he thought, gave the employees a high sense of morale. 
The company, according to Mullane, has made a profit to date, and two years after its organization it was sold to thz Chase Manhatten Capital Cor­poration where it now has the status of a small business and receives government assistance.

Mr. Mullane answered questions after he spoke. Prof. Frederick Dow, of the Business College, voiced his opinion that the government should allow private enterprise to operate less efficiently for a period of time specifically to help various social areas by sreading the burden of this inefficiency over the whole society.

Hopeful Signs 
The ambivilent committment by the administration exhibited in Rev. James Burtchaell's letter to Dr. Scott~ and, more importantly1 the partial recognitionthe University Provost has maae of the extent of the Umvers1ty's failure' to deal 
for its Black students are the first hopeful signs we have seen in regards to this 
problem. . Hiring eleven Black faculty members will go some way--though not nearly all the way, as Father Burtchaell himself admits--towards rectifying that failure. 
Black students, incubated in a Black environment and educated by .I:HacK mgn-­and secondary--school teachers, are often bewildered and even more often frustrated by the nearly all-white surroundings that made up Notre Dame. Since the faculty glut in all departments has guaranteed this University qualifiedfaculty in the race of its choice, there is no reason at all not to hire enough Black faculty to make the adjustment those students have to make a bit less difficult. 
Moire

More important than the hiring of BlacK faculty members, however) is the hiring of Black counselors. If thz transition from a primarily Black setting to a primarily White one is disturbing to Blacks, it is doubly so when the most im­portant emotional and experiential adjusters are unanimously White. Father Burtchaell, in his letter, revealed that the Dean Burke has made arrangementsfor a black Freshman Counselor to assume office next September. But if there is to be any increase in the number of Blacks admitted to this UniversityJ one Black Counselor will not be long adequate. We suggest three more be hired ror thz next 
school year.

Perhaps the most distressing part of the letter is Burtchaell's revelation that the University spent only $40,000.00 for scholarships. This low amount is thoroughly inconsistent with any attempt to make this campus a heterogenousinstitution. Itis true that the University 1s in the throes of monetary difficulty but there will be additional revenue garnered from this year's Cotton Bowl that can be used to suoolement this meae:er total. 
Fr. Burtchaell was also technically correct when he said that the issue of changing Black Studies from a :program into a major must be done by the College of Arts and Letters. There is httle question thou~h that if the Provost were to indicate clearly that such a move would enjoy his full support it would have a greater chance ofbein~ enacted. We strongly urge Fr. Burtchaell to make such a statement and make 1t quickly. 
Excellence 
Father Riehle's letter to SBP Dave Krashna and SBVP Mark Winings was an 
excellent one. Rather than engaging in cheap moralizing or drumming up a 
posse to apprehend the duo in the act of violating University rules, Fr. Riehle 
played by the rules and pitched the responsibility of enforcing the rules back to 
the students. 

Itwould have been easy for Riehle to instruct the Resident Assistant concerned 
to go to Wining's room and demand entry and if refused to ask the Hall Rector to 
unlock the door. 

His action clearly shows that he did not intend his remarks to be interpreted as 
general University policy, though theydld come oufthat way.
We congratulate Father Riehle for his finesse in hanaung the situation and for 
demonstrating clearly that he and the University do not expect resident 
assistants to invade the privacy of a man's room on suspicion of a violation of 
rules.

My mind travels back many times to the political activity of last year, and the decision by the Court has sent me back again to past days that, it seems, may never return. Charlie McCarthy the ex­director of the non-violence program nad a graduate of Bosto~ College Law School, had poured his considerable energies into generating interest about conscientious objection. I can still hear him say in that Boston twang, "Does the state have the right to force a man to kill if he perceives that killing to be neither right, nor good, nor just?" He was adamant that selective conscientious objection was an inalienable right, and for Catholics who believed that a war must be just before they could rightly participate, selective conscientious objection was a duty. 
I can remember mimeographing 50,000 petitions that were taken to Washington, D.C. during the November Moratorium by Notre Dame students. I remember Dave Johnson and a bunch of non-political people taking petitions into the North Dining Hall, asking that students support a bill that Professors Bill Lours and Thomas Schaffer of the Law School had drawn up that would amend the Draft Law. And I recall some of the North Dining Hall students asking us if we were chickens, if we were afraid to fight for our country. Memories of let­ters typed to all the Senators and Congressman, and of the few weak­kneed replies, are especially painful. And the memory of Phil McKenna and an entourage of seniors traveling to Washington to visit their Congressmen in late spring is still vivid. 
Without trying to be sentimental, I am trying to show that a hell of a lot of personal effort from faculty and students at Notre Dame was expended last year. The just war tradition of the Catholic Church was never more discussed than last year, even by people that beleived that no war could ever be just. And I remember our departed brother, Gaetano DeSapio, talking about how if a person truly believed that kill_in_g Vietnamese was unjust, then that person must be willing to go to Jail as a consequence of those beliefs. 
To be honest about it, I don't think any of us ever believed that selective eonscientious objection would become a reality. We petitioned and organized and wrote letters mostly because of a sort of personal loyalty to Mr. McCarthy, and because we believed that there were enough people that objected to Vietnam in particular to make the effort worthwhile. 
So the effort was made at Notre Dame and around the country, and the effort failed. Eight men decided that the political necessity to draft men for war overruled the moral arguments. 
Mr. McCarthy, in what was perhaps a rash moment, said that if seleetive conscientious objection was not made a part of the draft law, he would leave the country. And the decision by the Supreme Court has further embedded my belief that men of conscience are exiles in any nation, but especially in a nation that cannot admit its own sins its own guilt. ' 
Once we realize that nations are largely based upon their ability to inflict pain upon the citizens of other nations, and upon its own citizens, should we give up resisting that evil as a hopeless fight? I don't know. Our battle to become moral men can be won, but our ef­forts to create a moral nation seem to be ultimately destined to failure. But just maybe that is not important. For this much I know: last year, in the acts of resistance to evil and injustice, we were men. No Supreme Court can destroy the common solitarity, the individual dignity, that was ours last year. Only our own indifference can destroy us, and I am afraid that it is precisely our present lethargy that makes us half-men.

Elevating the war 1n S.E. Asia 
After two years of the mandate by the 
American electorate, we can look back 
with satisfaction on the greatest 
distance we have traveled ... Winding 
down the war is my greatest 
satisfaction in foreign policy, failure to 
end it is my deepest disappointment. 
President Nixon 
February 24, 1971 

Many people who had become politically active last spring did not turn out to work for peace candidates in the fall elections. In a January telecast President Nixon explained that this showed that American youth were "satisfied that this Ad­ministration is sincerely trying to end the war." In the same way that Mr. Nixon has used the "Silent .Majority", students are today being told they agree to what most of us have lately been too busy to consider. As a member of the group to which the President refers, I am asking myself today if I am satisfied. 
I am not a Southeast Asian scholar, nor am I an expert in Political Science, yet as a human being and a reluctant citizen of America I feel compelled to try and find out if the President has in fact ''travelled a great dista~ce.".Being a ?it suspicious of allowed American bombing to be steadily increased to "protect the security of our troops." 
. The Administration has stepped up bombings of North Vietnam as well as Laos and Cambodia: 
"The United States continued widespread bombing raids today, sending more than 1000 planes into action against enemy forces in Laos and Cambodia. 
Some of the raids were.in support of two South Vietnamese operations in Cam­bodia. American planes also carried out heavy air strikes around Tchepone ... In addition, U.S. helicopters are flying thousands of support missions -armed cover, medical evacuation. and troop transportation. ~NY Times, Mr 8, '71) 
Devistating effects 
The effects of the bombings are 
devestating. In Laos, for example, where 
the U.S. has been steadily bombing the 
Ho Chi .Minh Trail complex since January 
1965, the last six months of 1970 saw the 
creation of one million new refugees (Tom 
.. Wicker N.y. Times). 
Followi'ng.Mr.Nixon's0ctober8thpeace 

recent Presidential rhetonc, I f~el I should initiative (which has been totally rejected 
check t? se~ as best I can ~hat IS actually happenmg m Southeast Asia. Has the war been "winding down?" 
Complex issues 

The issues admittedly are complex and allow for diverse interpretations, yet there is little doubt that the Indochina War is wider today than it was in the Spring of 1970. As ex-senator Eugene .McCarthy said two weeks ago at Harvard: · "The President has not escalated the war, he has elevated it!" Though Nixon has with­drawn 100,000 men since the Cambodian "incursion" at the same time he has by the North Vietnamese), the United States bombed Laos for sixteen con­secutive days. 
The results of the expanded activities into Laos which began on February 8th are totally supported by American ground troops as well as air power. Typical results of the increased bombing : 
"A South Vietnamese communique said that 5699 North Vietnamese soldiers had been killed since the Laos Invasion began. About a third of this number was at­tributed to United States air strikes." 
<N.Y. Times, Mr 8, 1970) Two points are relevant: bombs cannot tell the difference between soldiers and 

civilians, and second, the Ho Chi Minh network we are attacking is not simply a trail. The trail complex resembles America's Civil War Underground Railroad. Just as this was not really a railroad, neither is the Ho Chi Minh Trail 
simply a trail. It is rather a complex 
network made up of numerous varied 
.artieries, often leading from one peasant 
cave to another. What we must do to 
destroy the trail is to destroy everything 
living and livable in sight. Yet even if we 
manage to disrupt the supply line at a 
point 25-miles from the Vietnamese bor­
der, (this is the point which American­
supported South Vietnamese are currently 
occupying) it seems likely the trail will be 
moved farther westward, deeper into 
Laos. A fact, I might add, which is readily 
admitted by the U.S. Command in Saigon. 
Hard to believe 
Again as a layman, naive to the ways of 
politics and war, I would be anxious to 
know how the State Department can ex­
pect one to believe its statement on Laos, 
which opens: "This limited operation is 
not an enlargement of the war . . . (Feb. 
9th)", when we are given daily reports 
such as this one: 
"Tchepone (in Laos), long a target of 
'American air power has about a dozen 
buildings standing in rubble ... 'Don't 
know how we missed them,' said an Air 
Force officer." (NY Times, Feb. 14th) 
Or Contrast the Department's: 
position on the use of air power in Cam­
bodia: 
"Laird rejected a request from the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to permit American tran­
sport planes and helicopters to help ferry 
ammunitions and South Vietnamese 
reinforcements to forces operating in deep 
Cambodia. The Chiefs argued that such use of aircraft was not specifically barred by either Nixon's pledge not to use either American ground troops or military ad­visers in Cambodia or by like prohibitions written into the supplemental aid bill. Secretary Laird reportedly feels such use would violate the spirit if not the letter of the ban on use of American troops in Cambodia."(NY Times, Jan. 14, 1971) 
Hard to believe 

The facts seem to crack one over the 
head. In the first place the use of American 
air power is seen to violate the Cooper­
Church Amendment, a Congressional 
attempt to limit the expansionary nature 
of the Indochina War. Yet two months 
later and at this very instant as we have 
already seen, U.S. bombers and 
helicopters are breaking the "spirit of the 
law," not only in Cambodia but in Laos. 
Clearly, the "mandate" to which J\.lr. 
Nixon referred in the opening quotation is 
not being served by an Indochina War that 
is larger today, not only in total activity 
but in American involvement, than it was 
in the spring of 1970. That a recent Gallup 
Poll shows 78 percent of the American 
people dissatisfied with Nixon's.conduct of 
the war leads me to think that the 
government's claim that the war is 
"winding down" is not believed by many 
Americans. Do you think that the war is 
WINDING DOWN?

We want, firstly, to let you know that the winter edition of JUGGLER is finally out, on sale at thz bookstore and in the Huddle. I think that the quality of the poetry in high enough to make the magazine appealing to anyone, whether or not he has a special interest in literature. Then too, all of the work printed here has been done by people we know and have lived with. This cir­cumstance makes the poetry doubly im­portant. Here is one poem, by Vince Sherry, that is a special favorite of mine: 
AFTER SUICIDE for L.C. (1949-1970) 
No one saw you

swollen angel; 
the searchlights lurched 
and bounced across the night them.

But you were too young for Him,

How could you leave yourself that way'? 
I wanted to gather you up and take you home like a harvest. 
It is hard to say enough about the value of a poen like this, one that begins from the utter defeat of a suicide and manages, in the space of seven stanzas, to find hearty and strength in spite of what has occured. JUGGLER is able to present this poem and many other good ones, by Brian O'Neill, John Hessler, Steve Brion, John Stupp and many others, as well as a fine critical essay by Margaret Fogarty. In short, I think you ought to have this magazine: you will be glad for it. Secondly, everyone should be told about plans for the Spring edition. Although we've tried to publish as many different artists as possible in our first two num­bers, we have been restricted somewhat by a limited amount of space. {Then too, some poems are simply better than others, and the good new ones are often done by the same writers who did the good old ones.) But there are, surely, many person here who deserve to be published and have not been thus far. Therefore, the Spring edition will focus mainly on work by writers who have not appeared previously. The University Arts Council has generously offered to make extra money available, so there will be plenty of space. All we need now, of course, are poems, many poems, or anything else literary that you have in hand. Spring break will be a good time to get something ready, and if 
you can send it to us soon after you ~et back--PObox 583, Notre Dame-we'll have it in time. We are looking forward to

mortal and witch-boy lover brought a special excitement to the Washington Hall stage. It wasn't the most polished of productions, maybe purposely. It brought a primative basic story to life in a primative way. Director Charles Ballinger's special quality that a Grandma Moses painting portrays -an ideal im­pression for a mountain ballad steeped in the traditions and superstitions of the American experience. 
Maribeth Fencil's Barbara Allen was particularly remarkable. Her partdemand the gamuet of moods, from the ecstasy of love to the anguish of giving 
birth to a still-born creature, to the pain of death of a broken heart. She carried it off without strain, without unnecessary theatrics, yet with grace. Miss Fencil's delicate, clear singing voice will be an asset to the ND-8MC Theatre for another three years. 
Bob Urbanic created John, the witch­boy-turned-mortal with appropriate awk­wardness, unsure of himself as a newly made mortal. This constrasted sharply with his sure and supple dance sequence as a witch at the start of the production. 
Much of the music was provided by the team of Rick Homan and Paul Guernsey who strummed and picked the music of the mountain people. Their warmth both during the show, and in an informal per­formance before led the audience in and out of that area of our minds in which the American folk tales and superstitions lie dormant. 
Mark Skrabacz left his usual back-stage duties long enough to delight the audience as the foot stomping, Spirit and mountain dew-filled Preacher Haggker, 
The entire cast is a well-disciplined company. Their performance as an en­semble was reminiscent of The Hostage , earlier this season. The parts were brief, but consistently solid. 
John Colton's set of dark boxes and ramps, which became whatever was necessary, succeeded in drawing the minds of the audience into teh shadows of their own minds. 
Yet much of the credit for this out­standing production must go to director­acting coach Charles Ballinger. J\.lr. Ballinger's blocking set kept much of the mood. He succeeded in molding a relatively inexperienced group of actors into a competent ensemble. His use of the dance and group movement was striking. 
The production's life was brief. It won't do any good to urge you to see this show. Still, you might be encouraged to take a look at Studio Theatre Productions in the future. Even the audience seemed a little warmer and much more interested in the production rather than just the idea of seeing a play. The Studio Theatre can be an entertaining and interesting way to see what's happening in theatre. 

New Voice arrives 
The new Voice is finally out, and without 
doubt is was worth waiting for. The ar­ticles draw material from every facet of life here at Notre Dame, running from an insightful article dealing with coeducation which shows that besides those who are demanding coeducation, there are a few that are actually against it to an interview with a man who was cussed out by general Patton, struck out by Satchel Paige and is now the stalwart guardian of the Golden ­Dome. The layout and general con­struction of the magazine is unlike that of any publication printed here on campus. 
There are no bylines of any sort in-thz NNEW Voice; their philosophy is not to be voices, but a unified voice. Most articles were team produced with three to fokr staff members doing research and writing. It is a new publication trying to establish itself and it needs help. As the new Voice states in its Voice print attempting to define itself "It surpasses the pooled talents of all twenty-~me staff members. For you are the Voice if anyone is-the Notre Dame community." Buy the new Voice, give it a boost. It will be well worth your efforts. It will be on sale in the dining halls tonight. Get a copy.

J. Collis Jones has two goals 

by Vic Dorr 
Observer Sportswriter 
When Collis Jones enrolled at Notre Dame, he had two goals in mind. He wanted to play basketball, of course; but he also wanted to get an education. And now, some four years later, the 6­7 senior has reached both of his goals. It is hard to tell, in fact, whether he attaches more im­portance to the weekend of May 23rd (when he will graduate along with the other members of the Class of '71) or to the weekend of March 13th (when the Notre Dame basketball team will play its opening game in the NCAA tournament.) 
Collis, if pressed, will probably admit that the upcoming tour­nament holds first priority with him right now. At the same time, though, he'll point out that he is at Notre Dame because of her academic reputation first, and because of her athletic program second. 
"The academic standards were 

the big reason for my coming 
here," he said, "but there were 
some other reasons, too. My 
parents liked Notre Dame, and of 
course the three of us (Collis, 
Austin Carr, and Sid Catlett) 
wanted to come to school together. 
"The three of them" were not exactly strangers when they arrived in South Bend in Sep­tember of 1967. They had played against each other for four years in the Washington, D.C. Catholic League, and they had played together on the D.C. playgrounds for nearly as long. It came as a surprise to no one, then, when the three talented players caught on immediately with the Irish basketball program. Carr developed into--well, he developed into Austin Carr. Catlett became primarily a rebounding threat, and Collis fit in somewhere between the two. 
He has fit in so well, though, that his high-caliber per­formances are often overlooked by those who would rather point to Carr's not shooting or to Catlett's flashy rebounding. And, despite the fact that his scoring 
(23.0) and rebounding 02.3) averages for this season alone cry for attention, Collis Jones wouldn't have it any other way. 
"All I want to do "he said "is be able to help th~'team. I don't really worry about scoring, and I think my rebounding is better this year because I'm more relaxed. Things are a lot easier 



The Irish Eye 

We were walking out of the Morris Civic Auditorium on Monday night and headed down LaSalle Street to the car. All of us were disgusted with the final results of The Fight.. Just as we neared the car Dave forlornly asked, "Are there no more heroes?" 
It was a fitting comment on the evening's action. Muhammed Ali, the self-proclaimed but unargued "greatest" up until Monday, had lost the biggest bout in the history of boxing. This was one for the hard hats, a moral and physical victory for the great silent majority. 
Before the fight I felt that this was just another heavyweight title fight, that everything was being blown out of proportion concerning Ali and what he symbolized. I was much mistaken, however. By ob­serving the audience I could tell that there very definitely was a symbol in the ring. ' 
The guy behind me may well have been a construction or factory worker and he was living and dying with each punch that Frazier threw or was hit with. Mter the decision, I saw a black student crying. It wasn. 'T JUST A CASE OF Joe Frazier beating Muhammed Ali. It was a case of another victory for the establishment and possibly in the long run, the beginning of the end for the sport of professional boxing. 
If this is so, it was a grand ending though. It was one of the most bizarre title fights ever. Both men taunted each other throughout the match. At various times in the match it didn't even seem that both were serious. Each man threw his best punches into the other with weemingly zero results. Ali shook his head when Frazier connected. Smokin' Joe laughed when Ali would land a combination. 
But even though it was a great fight, one that lived up to the weeks and months of hoopla preceding it, it could well be the end of the sport. Ali was the unbeatable fighter. He was a living legend. There was no other man in the history of boxing who could gain so much notoriety. He had become more than just an athlete. With his controversial refusal to enter the military he stood for something much greater than one man, which he was before that time. Although the greatest in­terest in him was shown only by boxing fans, there were uncountable people who felt haunted by the figure of Muhammad Ali. He had brought the dying sport of boxing back to life. 
Then came Joe Frazier. Frazier was not trying to be a symbol or standard bearer for anyone or anything except Joe Frazier. He was adopted by the public, however, as the man capable of destroying the Ali ghost. But Joe Frazier will never be known for anything more than simply a great boser. He is an athlete, nothing more. 
Some feel that a re-match is inevitable, that it will arouse even more interest. I doubt this very much. Even if both fighters consent to a re­match it can't possibly mean all that the first fight meant. 
The "Ali thing" is not the same as, say, Notre Dame football. The 
Irish can lose a game but come back with revenge to satisfy their fans 
such as the satisfying Cotton Bowl win. Ali can't do this. 
He made himself into the unbeatable fighter, the self-proclaimed 
greatest, and because of his defeat his constant talking leading up to a 
fight will be taken as only "mouthing off." It was apparent that Ali 
could have won this fight had he boxed in his own fashion but he 
wanted to prove to the world that he could beat Joe Frazier at 
Frazier's own game, slugging. Ali just wasn.t that good. He could have 
won and won easily by making Frazier chase him but he refused to do 
this. Instead he chose the road to defeat. But it was a glorious road. 
Maybe I,m wrong, maybe there will be even more interest in a re­
match. All I know is what i saw and heard after The Fight. 
On the drive back to campu Dave and I agreed that we would never 
pay six or ten dollars again to watch a closed-circuit telecast. Not that 
we felt robbed, far from it. That was a tremendous show. But like 
Dave asked, "Aretherenomoreheroes?" 

with John (Pleick) and Sid in there to help out. To me, it's all a team thing. I mean, personal glory is not what it's all about." 
Nevertheless, Jones has come in for a good deal of acclaim on several occasions this season. One such occasion, of course, was the UCLA game, in which he scored 19 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, and turned in a sparkling defensive job on the Bruin's Sidney Wicks. 
"I didn't think that was one of my better games. I didn't shoof real well ...and as for the defense on Wicks, we were just trying to keep him from going wild. We wanted to give him his points (he got 23) and shut down Patterson and Rowe." 
Collis feels that he played a much better game against Michigan State, but he does rate the UCLA encounter as one of the better team efforts of the year. "Of course the UCLA game was a good team effort, and maybe it was our best. But I think the team played a good game at Kentucky, too. It's hard to say just which one was the better game." 
But while there have been good 
games, there have also been 
disappointments. There have 
been losses where losses weren't 
expected, and the resulting 
criticism--both of coaches and 
players--has proved more than a 
little upsetting. 

"It gives us a feeling of in­
security to hear one of the 
players being booed when we're 
in front of a home crowd. And the 
individual himself doesn't ap­
preciate it either. Mter all, he is a 
member of the team." 
It's easy to see that Collis Jones 
is a man who appreciates the 
value of team play. And this is 
precisely why he refuses to take 
sides--one way or another--over 
the discontent that has centered 
around head coach Johnny Dee. 
"I guess people are entitled to their opinions," said Collis, "but I'm in no position to criticize. We've got this tournament coming up, and talk like this doesn't help the team one bit. So I wouldn't get involved in this business even if I wanted to. He is the coach, and as players we have to go out and do what he says. If we don't do what he says, and we lose, then it's our fault and not his." · 
What Collis left unsaid is that hopefully there will be no more losses, especially during the Midwest Regionals of the NCAA tournament. 
"We don't know anything about Texas Christian (ND's first­round opposition), or about the kind of ball that they play in the Southwest Conference, because we haven't received any scouting reports yet. But I can tell you this: we're looking forward to it." 
He didn't say "I'm looking forward to it," he said "We're looking forward to it." He was speaking, again, about the entire team, and from the tone of his voice, it was obvious that J. Collis Jones knew he was right. 
So maybe the upcoming tournament does rank first on his list of priorities. And if it does, wouldn't it seem only natural that the possibility of a pro career would be the next most important thing? To most people it would. But not to Collis Jones. 
"I'll play if I'm drafted," Collis said, "but I can't even begin to be concerned about that. I've got to graduate first."

feelings on paper--not only for the benefit of sorting out my own thoughts, but more importantly, to inform that HD-SMC com­munity of the nature of the report. 
1) Although prepared by members from both Notre Dame and St. Mary's, the cover page to the report states that the report was "submitted by Notre Dame Student Government" only. This attribution is incorrect for two reasons: First, it ignores the many St. Mary's students who put in an equal amount of time on the report's preparation up to the day of presentation. Secondly, it disregards the Notre Dame students who worked on the report not for student govern­ment, but simply as students moved to action by the issue of coeducution. I do not think either group imagined that the report was to be submitted by "Notre Dame Student Government" only. · 
2) The origimal steering committee of this report was divided after the February 13 meeting of the joint coordinating committee. Some favored a modification of the "Burtchaell Proposal", which completely merges the college and the university on all levels--social,

of merger in an educationally creative and contemporary way, nor did it seem to truly guarantee any face-lifting of the ND c111rriculum at all. (Something like the "guarantee" to un­tenured SMC faculty ... ) They fdt, in fact, that a face-lifting was not the question, but that a definite structure providing genuine undergraduate educatignal diversity was. 
At any rate, the former spent long hours last Wednesday night compiling the final collection of reports--and prefaced all with the first point of view on how the actual merger should be effected. The only mention of the latter points of view was a paragraph explaining that it had "no valid educational purpose." 
3) I commend the "Notre Dame Student Government" for presenting an alternative plan for merger, yet I strongly protest (as I had that Wednesday night) the fact that the nine independent student committee reports treating all aspectsof coeducation were presented along with the first-mentioned philosophy and merger plan as if aII members were in support of it. Quite the contrary. I think I speak for many members when I say that we had little idea that the reports were going to be presented as a unit in support of this specific merger proposal. 
Also in the verbal presentation to the Student Affairs Committee of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees last Thursday, it was said that this plan for merger had 
tributed. Unfortunately, that's · just the way it all turned out.

Dear Mr. Corso, 

I am writing concerning you 
editorial of Tuesday March 9. 
Again, the Rev. James Burt­
chaell was the target of your 
"splendid verbage." 

Repeatedly, Fr. Burtchaell has 
been the subject matter of much 
of your criticism. In the begin­
ning your editorial comments 
we're in part well founded. 
However, there is a growing 
undertone . in the editorials 
concerning the Provost. 

It appears Mr. Corso that your personal feelings are beginning to creep into your editorial opinions. It is obvious, at least to me, that you are not extremely fond of the Reverend. However, please leave your personal feelings to yourself in personal letters and stop the pot-shotting in the editorials. 
Sincerely, 
Scott Braley
