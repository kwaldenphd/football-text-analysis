NDsenior class starts to register 
By LAURA BAUMGARTNER 
News Writer 
The first day of class regis­tration for the spring semester was problem-free for seniors yesterday as they registered for classes with the new InsideND system, oftieials said. 
"Everything is going incredi­bly smoothly," Assistant Hegistrar Doug McKenna said. "We're so far in a good posi­tion." 
Under the new registration system, students become eligi­ble to register for elasses every 15 minutes, McKenna said. Each student is randomly assigned a "registration time ticket," and once his or her designated time begins, he or she may begin registering for classes. 
InsideND debuted in the spring of 2005 and replaced the former lrishLink system. It provides students with the opportunity to log in and add or drop classes continuously from the start of their registra­tion periods until the seventh day of classes in the spring. Under the old IrishLink system, students were only able to log in during their designated 15­minute registration period and were only able to log in to make changes at spedfie times outside that time period.

allowed me to watch the movie masterpiece 
Advertising

"Love Don't Cost 
Manager

a Thing" more than a dozen times. This 2003 remake of the popular "Can't Buy Me Love," is a movie that defies all bounds and laughs in the face of naysayers. "You can't have success by taking a formulaic script and adding Nick Cannon and some Sean Jean." Hahahaha, yes yes you can. "Christina Milian is a failed pop star, not a compelling actress." My good man, you couldn't be more wrong. 
It may have only gotten one star in the Comcast viewers guide, but as an ex-film major I can confi­dently say that this movie was a R­Kelly theme song away from being a box office smash. For those of you who haven't yet seen this film, allow me to enlighten you. Nick Cannon, a pool boy who struggles socially, pays Christina Milian, the funky fresh biddy of the city, to date him and in turn make him popular. Their escapades turn the pool boy into "Aqua Man" and in no time he is "scooping shorties" with ease. 
Eventually, the deal is discovered and Cannon is once again reverted to a social leper. Just when you reach the height of your rage from this social injustice Milian realizes she has been "frontin' her whole life" and decides to indeed become Cannon's "breezy." Not since Barry Gordy's The Last Dragon has such drama and yet such truth been brought to the silver screen, because deep down inside we know that we all front from time to time. 
It's refreshing to see a movie with the courage to say, hey, it's . OK to fake a front as long as you leave that mess on the flip side. I for one have learned that whether I'm actin' tha fool or staying wild decent you always have to keep it for real for real. I challenge everyone reading this column to take the 90 minutes out of their lives to watch this film and reflect the way I have. 
I'm a senior this year and in a couple of months I will be ventur­ing out into the cruel world outside the safe confides of Notre Dame. It's clear now that this world will allow a well-mannered pool boy to have his heart broken. I can only hope that when I find myself in the proverbial role of pool boy I will have a fly breezy to hold my hand and tell me everything is going to be OK. .

Prosthetic center to make leg for puppy 
FLINT TOWNSHIP, Mich. -Rex Miller has made artificial limbs for lots of humans, but never for a dog. Until now. Miller, owner of the Greater Flint Prosthetic Center, made a cast last week that will guide him on how to make a new leg for 4-month-old Peg, a puppy born without an ankle joint or right paw. 
"She'll be able to walk and run better, but she'll proba­bly always still have a little hitch in her giddyup," said Miller, who lost his own right leg trying to jump a train when he was 15. 
TODAY 


Making an artificial leg for a puppy can be tricky. It could be attached to the dog's leg with a harness or a Velcro-type material. To pre­vent her from chewing on the leg, it will be made of materi­al similar to bulletproof vests. 
Veterinarians with Baker College's training program put Peg under anesthesia and took X-rays to help Miller make the leg. Baker joined Miller in doing the work for free because Peg's owner, Carol Beavnier, works for a nonprofit organization.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Metnbers exatnine fiscal policy 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Writer 
The Council of Hepresentatives (COlO met Monday night to dis­cuss rncommnndations for dmn!-{11s to tlw Student Union fis­r.al policy. 
"As wo are moving forward with a proposal to increase the student activity fee, this is a per­fnet opportunity to inspect the Studnnt Union fiscal policy," stu­dent body president Davn Baron said. 
In the past week, Baron mnt with a small group of con

four recommenda­tions. It was suggested Dave Baron that Studnnt Union student body president 
treasurer Mike Marshall present a Student Union treas­ury report to COH each month. The report would cover monthly spending, Finaneial Management Board activity, appeals and business hoard updates. 
"As far as business board updates go, I would reeommend having th11 business board man­ager make that report following llwir monthly meetings," Marshall said. 
Heeommendations also called for a darification of the scope and purpose of fund appeals, induding carry-forward. con collaboration, technology, contin­gency and charity funds. 
"This infi1rmation is not exactly well known to all clubs and organizations," Baron said. "Thny need to know about the funds that are available for them to access." 
Not all of these funds are part of the budget at this time, Marshall noted, pointing out the technology and contingency funds. 
"Hight now those don't even 
exist," Marshall said. "If' you think they're important to develop and put in the budget, that's fine, but right now they don't exist at all." 
H e a I -t i m e access of 
account infor­mation to group controllers and treasurers was 

a priority among recommenda­tions presented to the group, as treasurers of groups currently have to get printouts of their spending from Marshall. 
"This would give treasurers the ability to go to InsideND and figure out what they've spent," Baron said. "It makes it easier because there's not a delay." 
Student Activities advisor Amy Geist said the administration is reluetant to give students access to financial information. 
"There is a higher expnetation for student government than for ollieers of individual dubs," she said. "I don't know that the University is interested in giving every dub treasurer access to their accounts." 
The group's final recommenda­tion involved a potential cap on the carry-forward fund, which now contains $180,000. The account must have at least $15,000, but has no maximum eap. 
"At one point a few years ago, a large sum was put in to make a safety net," Baron said. "But $180,000 is much more than we need to have in that." 
If a cap is put in place, student government must decide what to do with the excess funds in the account at that time. 
"My personal idea is that it has to be something permanent that students 20 years down the lines ean benefit from," Baron said. 
Baron noted the carry-forward f'und is supposed to be used for capital expenditure, not to accommodate a deficit in the budget, though that is how it is currently used. Student govern­ment can currently withdraw $10,000 from the fund each year. 
A number of COR members volunteered to serve on smaller hrroups for closer examination of the carry-forward fund recom­mendations and to clarify the scope and purpose of the fund appeals.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 

Group voices concern over e-111ail -wording 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
News Writer 
Board of Governance mem­bers met Monday night to dis­cuss recent e-mail<> sent by cam­pus seeurity mgarding reported sexual assault by a Saint Mary's student while on Notre Dame's campus. 
Women's Issues commissioner Katie Kelly said she was con­cerned that the wording of the e-mail that included warnings about assault prevention such as "never leave your beverage and then pick it back up, never accept a beverage from some­one" could imply that rape is partly the victim's fault. 
"I think it is great and impor­tant to know about !sexual assault incidents on campus!. but it is how they put it out there that is the problem," Kelly said. "They should mention the coun­seling center, S.O.S. and the Women's Center as places where victims can get help." 
Kelly's pursuit for a change in the e-mails intensified after she read an anonymous posting on the faculty-staff discussion forum on the College's "Virtual Village" blog that argued against the warnings potentially insinu­ating the fault of the victim. 
Kelly said the anonymous posting was written in a way that warned studenl<> to be cau­tious of their clothing, body Ian­guage and drinking habiL<> while out. 
"I was just partieularly dis­turbed that the posting was found in the faculty-stall" section, however, that does not neces­sarily moan the posting was donn by a staff nwmbnr," slw said. 
Missions commissioner .hmny Hobbins was also disturbnd by the posting and the wording of the warnings in thn e-mails snnt out by College security. 
"It seems they are saying th11 problem is if you wear a short skirt. you might gnt raped," she said. "It is just the implieation that you have eontrol ovnr thn situation." 
Kelly weleomed suggnstions from the Board on how to resolve this issue. 
Hnsidenee Hall Commissioner Jackie Wright suggested that she could speak with security about adding information about victim's counseling to the n­mails. 
Kelly said that measurn would be a benefieial ehange in the overall tone of the e-mails. To promote awareness for change, she encouraged the board to attend the Campus Alliance fi1r Hape Elimination in the snxual assault vietim vigil at 7:15 p.m. on Thursday in front of the stu­dent center.

Bush responds to Iraq warcritics 
Facing contentious political climate and dropping polls, president speaks out 
Associated Press 
ELMENDOHF i\IH FOHCE 
BASE. /\Iaska -President 
Bush hurled new arguments 
against Iraq war critics on 
Monday as he headed for 
Asia, accusing some 
Democrats of "sonding 
mixed signals to our troops 
and the enemy." . 
"That is irrcsponsiblo," 
Bush said. Bush addressed 
U.S. forces and their fami­lies during a rel'ueling stop in Alaska. It was the initial leg of an night-day journey to .I a pan. South KonHl, China and Mongolia. Bush has hopes of improving his image on the world stage. 
"Heasonable people can disagren about the conduct of the war. but it is irrespon­sible for Demoerats to now daim that we misled thnm and the Ameri<~an people," Bush said. "Only one person manipulated evidence and mislml the world -and that person was Saddam Ilussnin." 
Bush, who wore a rtight jackflt. was chnered and applauded by the receptive audience. 
The president sought to defnnd himself against criti­cism by Democrats that he manipulated intellignnce and misled the American people about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruc­tion as hn sought grounds to go to war against Saddam's regime in 2003. 
Mnanwhile, National Security Adviser Stephen !Iadley told rnporters aboard the prnsidential air­craft that two agenda items on Bush's Asia trip were the huge Chinesn trado surplus with thn United States and a U.S.-Japanese dispute over 
U.S. beef imports. 
Nnithor dispute was expected to bn resolved on the prnsidnnt's trip, !Iadley said. 
"I don't think you're going to see headline-breakers" from the presidnnt's trip, Hadley said. 
On Sunday, Iladley acknowledged "we were wrong" about Iraq's 


weapons of mass destruc­tion, but he insisted in a CNN interview that the pres­ident did not manipulate intelligence or mislead the American peopln. 
Iraq and other problems 
from the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina to the indictment of a senior White I louse ollidal in the CIA leak investigation -have taken a heavy toll on the president's standing. Nearing the end of his fifth year in ollien, Bush has the lowest approval rating of his presidency and a majority of i\rnericans say Bush is not honost and they disapprove of his handling of foreign policy and the war on ter­rorism. 
In his Alaska remarks, 
Bush noted that some C11ect­ed Dnmoerats in Congress "have opposed this war all along." 
"I disagrne with them. but I respect their willingness to take a consistent stand," lw said. "Ynt some Democrats who voted to authorize the use of forcn are now rnwrit­ing the past. They arn play­ing politics with this issun and sending mixed signals to our troops and the enemy." 
In the Senatn, 29 Democrats voted with 48 Hnpublicans for the war authorization measure in late 2002, including 2004 Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry ol' Massachusetts, and his run­ning mate, John Edwards of North Carolina. Both have meontly bonn harshly criti­cal ol' Bush's eondud ol' tlw war and its al'tnrmath. 
On Capitol llill. top Domoc~rats stood their ground in claiming Bush misled Congrnss and tlw 
·country. "Tho war in Iraq was and rnmains mw of' thn grnat ads ol' mislnading and docoption in i\moriean his­tory," Kerry told a nows con­l'nreneo. 
DmnocTats oll'ernd a pro­posal urging tlw presidnnt to outline an ostimatn for a phasod withdrawal of U.S. troops. Tho Senatn was expeeted to voto on it on Tuesday. as well as on a rival GOP Iraq policy pro­posal t.hat dons not include a withdrawal provision. 
JORDAN 

U.S. arrests, releases Iraqi suspect 
Associated Press 
AMMAN. Jordan -The U.S. mili­tary announced Monday it arrested and later released an Iraqi whose name matches that of one of the Amman hotel suicide bombers, say­ing there was no "compelling evi­dence" that he posed a security threat. 
The American military command could not confirm if the man it arrested last year, identified as Safaa Mohammed Ali, was among the three al-Qaida in Iraq militants who carried out the attacks 

Wednesday on the Hadisson SAS. Grand Ilyatt and Days Inn hotels. The blasts killed 57 other people. 
The statement came as Jordanians -from the groom whose bombed wedding turned into a nightmare to local shopkeepers ­voiced anger and joy at the capture and riveting televised confession of a would-be fourth Iraqi bomber, wife of one of the suicide attackers. 
Many even doubted Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Hishawi, 35, had anything to do with bombing the Radisson wedding party, saying her version of events contradicted accounts given by Jordanian 
au th oritios. 
Secretary of State Condolenzza Hice met Jordan's King Abdullah to offer condolenees over the attacks, whieh killed throc~ Americans. 
"Thnrn is no justil'ieation l'or the wanton killing of innocents, and we stand in solidarity with the people ol' Jordan, the people around tho world who havo sulTerod similar tragedies, and we will stand linn." Hice said during a tour of tho Hadisson. 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also visited the Hadisson, where he said tho suicide bombers "deserve all of God's wrath."

Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Rex Rakow reported a comparable number of citations and arrests. 
Rakow said 26 citations and 17 no-trespass notices were issued before and during the game. Four custodial arrests were made for public intoxication, minor con­suming and possession of false identification. Arrested individuals received the "usual" treatment, according to Rakow, and were taken to St. Joseph County Jail. 
Police issued 26 citations and made 5 arrests at the Tennessee game. 
Officers patrolling tailgates were both uniformed and in plain clothes and used breathalyzers to "assess the level of intoxication," Rakow said. 
He said NDSP, St. Joseph County Police, South Bend Police and Indiana State Excise Police offi­cers made rounds at pre-game gatherings in parking lots. 
Director of Stadium Personnel Cappy Gagnon said 15 students were removed from the game for alcohol-related reasons -the majority of the ejections were for being "highly intoxicated." 
"This is very unfortunate for a game beginning at 1 p.m.," he said. 
Gagnon said students ejected from the stadium lose their ticket booklets and are subsequently sent to the Office of Residence Life and Housing. 
Following the trend of recent games, Gagnon said there were "zero" marshmallow throwing incidents Saturday. 
Gagnon said he has been unable to figure out exactly why marsh­mallow throwing has dwindled this season in comparison with past years, but cited warmer weather -meaning fewer coats and thus fewer hiding places ­and engaging band halftime shows. 
"The team is playing exciting football and winning, and certain­ly the prospect of losing your tick­et booklets can't be appealing," he said. "Whatever the reason, I am pleased that ushers and students do not have to be in an adversari­al position over this."

IN BRIEF 
Stocks end mixed on inflation concerns 
NEW YOHK -Wall Strnet wandered through a listless snssion Monday. finishing little changed as invnstors east aside upbeat earnings at Wal­Mart Stores Inc. and Lowe's Cos. ahead of criti­eal inllation and spending data later this week. 
Strong results from Wal-Mart and Lowe's eame as a sign that consumers are still spending despite the rocent spike in energy costs, bright­ening the holiday sales outlook. A pair of multi­billion-dollar acquisitions also helped the mar­ket's mood: Georgia-Pacific Corp. is being taken private and Host Marriott Corp. is buying 38 upscale hotels. 
But with key government data on inflation and rntail sales due this week, investors are waiting for indications of whether higher costs are driv­ing up prices on consumer goods, said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investments LLC. 
"Now that gas prices have come down, there's more confidence that inflation will be kept at bay," Fornlli said. "But I'm not sure the market is really going to believe that until the [Federal Heservel says so."

Wal-Mart expects holiday gains 
Despite modest sales recently, retailer looks toward a healthy shopping season 
Associated Press 
LITTLE BOCK, Ark. -Tlw world's largest retailer, W!LI-Mart Storns Inc., post­ed a modest :~.8 percent in profit growth on Monday, but said it expects oleetron­ics and other general mor­ehandise to propel it to a hoalthy holiday soason, though spending may slacken whon the bills como due early next year. 
Income rose to $2.4 bil­lion, or 57 cents per share, for tho quarter ended Oct. 31 from $2.:~ billion, or 54 emits JWr share, a year ago. Earnings in the latest quar­ter ineludnd three items, including hurricane related eosts, which n~dueed rnsults by $80 million. or 2 cents per sharo. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had l'orncast 57 cents per share. 
Hevenues were $7f>.35 billion with salos or $75.4 billion, an increase of 10.1 pnreent. over $68.5 billion in sales for the third quar­ter of fiscal 2005. Sales at storos opened at loast a year, known as same-store sal1~s. rose a modest 3.8 percent. Same-store sales are considered an impor­tant measure of a retailer's health because they don't inflate overall growth from new store openings. 
Wal-Mart shares rose 30 cents to close at $49.30 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, where they have traded in a 52­week range of $42.31 to $57.89. 
In a conference call with investors, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott didn't address criticism the com­pany has come under for labor and other practices except to note Wal-Mart's critics had some praise for the retailer's response to Hurricane Katrina. 
Scott said Wal-Mart sus­tained sales despite the hurricanes, gasoline prices that skyrocketed in the quarter and higher home heating bills. The hurri­canes -Katrina, Rita and Wilma -closed hundreds

Scott called the quarter a "pretty good performance in a difficult environment." 
"I believe we will have a good holiday season," Scott said. lie noted that the hur­ricanes would in the longer term improve employment and the economy but said January and February could be difficult months when holiday bills come due and higher heating oil and natural gas prices have a greater impact. 
Analyst Dan Hess, presi­dent and chief executive of Merchant Forecast, a New York-based independent research company, agreed that Wai-Mart should do well for the holiday. 
"With Wal-Mart, it's not just about the numbers and the forecast. All types of social issues play a role in the public perception of Wal-Mart," Hess said. 
So far, the public is voting with its feet and is continu­ing to shop at Wal-Mart stores, he said. 
"The issues of con­science, right now at least, appear to be affecting the stock price more than affecting sales," Hess said. "At the end of the day, Wal­Mart is taking market share away from other retailers." 
"I think Wal-Mart is gain­ing back some momentum in general merchandise," lless said. "Their push toward electronics is going to be successful."

Knight Ridder Inc. considers selling 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Newspaper publisher Knight Ridder Inc., under pressure from its largest shareholders, said Monday it would consider selling the company and other steps to boost shareholder value. 
The San Jose, Calif.-based publisher of The Miami Herald, the San Jose Mercury News and 30 other newspa­pers said it would work with longtime financial adviser Goldman Sachs & Co. to explore a possible sale and other options. 
Knight !Udder also said it had changed its bylaws to allow sharehold­ers to submit proposals at its annual meeting, currently scheduled for next April, and also to nominate directors. 

II) a prepared statement, Knight Ridder said there was no assurance that there would be a transaction. The company also said it didn't intend to provide any updates on the process "unless and until" its board has approved a specific transaction. A company spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the written state­ment. 
Last week Knight Ridder's largest shareholder, Private Capital Management LP of Naples, Fla., threatened to nominate its own slate of directors at the newspaper publish­er's next annual meeting after receiv­ing only a "limited response" to the "serious concerns" that it and other 
shareholders had raised about the company. 
Private Capital Management owns 19 percent of Knight Hidder and has significant stakes in other publicly held newspaper publishers. PCM first agitated for a sale of Knight Hidder in early November, and its call was soon seconded by Knight fOdder's No. 3 shareholder Harris Associat(~s Ll', a Chicago-based money manager. llarris has an 8.2 percent stake in Knight Hidder. 
A third shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management Inc., which holds 
8.9 percent of Knight Hidder, also has said it would take a more aetive role in considering future options for the company.

Post-partutn women at risk for blood clots 
Experts encourage exercise to prevent clotting 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -New moms should get up and start walking as soon as possible to prevent the risk of a potentially fatal blood dot, doctors advise. 
Although the chances of such dots are rare, they are four times greater for pregnant women and new mothers, a large 30-year study found, confirming what doctors have long observed. 
Mayo Clinic researchers looked at medical records from 1966 to 1995 of 50,000 pregnant women who lived in Olmsted County, Minn., where data has long been gathered for a long-term health surveillance project. 
The researchers focused on blood clots in leg veins (known as deep vein thrombosis) and clots that broke loose and lodged in the lungs (known as pulmonary embolism). 
The incidences of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were small -only 105 cases occurred over the 30-year period -but the problem is of concern because it is frequently fatal when it does happen. 
In roughly one-fourth of pul­monary embolism cases in gener­al, the first and only symptom is sudden death, said Dr. John A. Heit, lead author of the study appearing in Tuesday's Annals of Internal Medicine. 
When the researchers com­pared similar age groups, they found the pregnant women and those who had given birth within the past three months were four times more likely to have these serious blood clot problems than non-pregnant women. 
Nearly all of the women in the study wen~ white, so researchers said their findings might not apply to women of other races. 
In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Richard V. Lee of the State University of New York at Buffalo said that within the past 20 to 30 years pulmonary embolism has overtaken all other causes of maternal mortality. 
An American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists committee is drawing up guide­lines on the subject, said Dr. Gary Hankins, an obstetrician and the committee's chair. 
The top tip for all new moms: Get out of bed and start walking as soon as possible. For women with risk factors -such as obesi­ty, a history of clots, and pro­longed bed rest during pregnan­cy -doctors may consider using leg compression devices in the hospital to get the blood moving. 
But blood thinners don't lead the list of possible solutions because of potential complica­tions, like excessive bleeding. 
"Anticoagulants should be reserved for a very small group, those only with a significant risk," Hankins said. "We don't want to recommend a strategy that could do more harm than good." 
Heit said aspirin has been shown to be effective for prevent­ing stroke and heart attack but it appears not to help prevent blood clots in leg veins. 


Georgia vvo:rnan, 37, 
marries teenage boy 
Lisa Clark faces child molestation charges 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Ga.-A 37­year-old woman has been charged with child molestation for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy whom she married last week.. 
The woman also is allegedly pregnant with the boy's child, though paternity hasn't yet been determined, his grand­mother and guardian told The Associated Press on Monday. 
"You hear about stuff like this from the TV, but it's not reality," Judy Ann Hayles said. "But [this] happened. And this won't be over because a baby is on the way." 
Lisa Lynnette Clark was arrested Wednesday and remained in custody Monday. A preliminary hearing is set for Nov. 30. 
District Attorney Lee Darragh said Georgia law on child molestation says that a person under 16 legally cannot consent to a sexual act. Darragh would not comment further on the case. 
Hayles said she knew her grandson was spending a lot of time with his best friend's mother, but she had no real objections until she found love letters and lurid photos from Clark. 
"I love you so much. I'm yours forever," were among the lines in one of six letters from Clark that Hayles said she found among her grand­son's possessions. 
Hayles' grandson had been spending every weekend with Clark's son. In July, the two boys were charged with bur­glarizing a neighbor's home and sent to a youth detention center for 45 days. 
Hayles said her grandson during that stay received the letters from Clark, along with seductive photos of her posing on top of a mantle and in a bikini. 
Hayles filed a police report on Oct. 6 when she learned from a friend that Clark was pregnant. About a month later, before authorities made their move, the two were married. 
In Georgia, a person must be 18 to marry without parental consent or 16 to marry with parental consent. But if the couple has a child or the woman can show she is preg­nant, the age requirement doesn't apply. 
Hayles said she hopes to get an annulment or a divorce for her grandson.

weak hearts can't pump force­
fully enough and fluid backs up 
into the lungs. 
"They're all terribly sick. 
They come into the hospital 
severely short of breath, sweat­
ing, with varying blood pres­
sures," said the chief 
researcher, Dr. Milton Packer of 
the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center 
in Dallas. 
The usual treatment is intra­
venous drugs to help them shed 
water, but that only works 
about half the time. 
Levosimendan works in a novel 
way to improve how strongly 
the heart contracts. 
Doctors gave 300 emergency 
room patients in the United 
States, Israel and Australia the 
usual treatment and gave 
another 300 a one-day infusion 
of the experimental drug. 
They measured improvement 
according to a composite scale 
of things like worsening short­
ness of breath, kidney function, and lung or circulatory prob­lems. 

Four days later, 26 percent of patients given usual care need­ed additional treatment because symptoms had wors­ened, but only 15 percent who received levosimendan did. 
The chances of improving were 33 percent higher and the chances of worsening were 30 percent lower in those on the experimental drug. 
However, six months later, those who got levosimendan were no better off than those given traditional drugs. In fact, more had died (49 versus 40) or developed heart rhythm problems, though the differ­ence between the groups was considered small enough that it might have occurred by chance. 
'There were some worrisome trends," said Dr. Timothy Gardner, a cardiologist at the Center for Heart and Vascular Health at Christiana Care Health Services in Wilmington, Del., who has no ties to the study or the drug's maker. 
Still, he said the drug appeared to have unique bene­fits to bail out very sick patients over existing drugs. 
Another study to be present­ed Wednesday will reveal whether the drug lowered death rates in very sick heart failure patients on continuous intravenous medications at home. 
Monday's study was paid for by Abbott and Orion Pharma, a Finland-based firm that mar­kets the drug in Europe as Simdax. Abbott is seeking approval in the United States.

Research on other heart dis­ease treatments reported at the conference produced mixed results, including the largest test of whether improving cho­lesterol might help prevent car­diovascular problems in diabet­ics. 
One study examined fenofi­brate, a drug that lowers fats in the blood called triglycerides while raising levels of HDL or "good cholesterol" in people with Type 2 diabetes, the most common form. These people have three to four times the risk of heart disease as non­diabetics. 
The 10,000 participants were not taking any cholesterol med­icine when the study began; four out of five had no previous cardiovascular problems. 
Roughly five years later, the combined rates of fatal heart problems and non-fatal heart attacks were roughly the same for those on the drug and those given dummy pills. 
"There were many positive findings," including less nerve damage that leads to loss of vision, amputations and kidney damage, said lead researcher Dr. Anthony Keech of the University of Sydney in Australia. 
"I don't think these results would support choosing fenofi­brate over a statio," a widely used type of cholesterol-lower­ing medication, but lots of rea­son to add it, he said. 
However, government regula­tors have warned of problems, including a higher risk of a rare muscle problem, when statins are combined with fibrate drugs.

Chirae calls for help to heal 
In his first address since rioting began, president calls for diversity 
Associated Press 
PAlUS -President Jacques Chinu: said Monday that unrest in tho poor neighborhoods of Franco is tho sign of. a "proli1und malaise" thn entire nation must work to lwal through job-training and mnploynwnt opportunities for troublml youths. 
In his first address to tho nation since thn rioting erupted, tho prnsident said companies, unions and the nwdia must help bring divorsity to French soeiety and eornbat what he called the poison of discrimination. 
French law must be obeyed, but values and hope also must be kindled in youths living in the poor, largely immigrant suburbs ringing Frnnch eitins, he said. 
"Tiwsn nvnnl'i testify to a pro­found malaise ... This is a crisis of dirnction, a 1:risis of reference points, it is a crisis of identity," he said. "We will mspond by being linn, bning just and being faithful to thn values of France." 
Chinu: spoke after the Cabinet approvml a measure to extend a state of mnnrgency from 12 days 
t.o thrm1 months. The parliament was to dobato the bill Tuesday. Thoro will be a possibility of end­ing the measure before the thrm~-month term expires. 
Chirae, who turns 73 later this month, was hospitalized in September for a blood vessel problem that many thought was a stroke. llowever, he showed no signs of an ailment Monday. Unusually, he wore spectacles, as he had done in his youth. 
lie announced the creation of a corps of volunteers to offer train­ing for 50,000 youths by 2007, and told companies and unions they must encourage diversity and support employment for youths from tough neighbor­hoods. 
French media, whieh are not very ethnically diverse, must "bett~~r reflect the reality of France today," Chirac said. 
"We will not build anything enduring without fighting this poison for society which is dis­ITimination." 
Speaking with a French tricolor and Ell flag behind him, Chirac said that discrimination -seen as a factor behind the violence ­should be combatted. But he appeared to rule out li.S.-style allirmative action. 
"There is no question of enter­ing into the logic of quotas," the French leader said. And he defended the French model of integration whieh seeks to meld people of all origins into a single mold -and which many officials and experts now say has failed. 
"At stake is respect for the law but also the success of our policy of integration," Chirae said. 
The unrest has abated over the past week. But the decision to extend the state of emergency until mid-February made dear authorities feared the anger seething below the relative calm eould resurface. 
First put in place last Wednesday, the state of emer­gency opens the way for recourse to extraordinary action by regional authorities, such as call­ing curfews or conducting day­and-night searches of homes. About 40 French towns, includ­ing France's third-largest city, Lyon, have used the measure so far, imposing curfews on minors.

includes deporting foreigners implicated in violence. 
The magnitude of the unrest, marked by nightly the burning of vehicles, schools and wamhouses around the country, has stunned France. The country's leadership and many citizens learned the depth of discontent in France's suburban housing projects, largely home to immigrants and their French-born children disil­lusioned by discrimination and joblessness. 
The civil unrest is the worst since the student-worker revolts of May 1968 and the worst ever in the suburbs. 
Chirac for a second time point­ed a linger at parents, whom om­dais have blamed for failing to stop teenage youths from the destructive rampages. 
"Parental authority is vital. Families must assume all of their responsibilities. Those that refuse should be punished as the law allows." 
While condemning the vio­lence, Chirac also reached out to disgruntled suburban youths. 
"I want to say to the children of difficult neighborhoods, whatever their origins, that they are all the daughters and sons of the Hepublic," he said. 
The unrest has provided a per­fect forum for the far-right, which blames French ills on immigration. At a rally Monday that drew about 300 supporters, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who faced off Chirac in 2002, castigated the immigration policy. 
"We let in 10 million foreigners over 30 years -it's wild insanity. No country can handle that inva­sion," Le Pen said.

U.N. seeks out aid for humanitarian crises

UNITED NATIONS Countries rich and poor on Monday called for a $500 mil­lion U.N. fund to meet human­itarian emergencies artnr a year of devastating disasters from the Indian Ocean tsuna­mi and earthquakes in Asia and hurricanes in tho Americas to drought in Afriea. 
General Assembly Prosidnnt 
Jan Eliasson said the current $50 million revolving fund was insuf'f1­eient, and the increase would help the United Nations respond quickly to sudden and underfunded crises.

As the U.N.'s 191 member nations were meeting, he said, the death toll in Pakistan from the Oct. 8 earthquake was still rising "and thousands of peo­ple are in danger of freezing to death as winter sets in." 
An especially destructive hurricane season has also left thousands homeless in the Caribbean, Central America and the United States, and nearly 35 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are hun­gry and need food as a result of "a lethal combination of conflict and drought," he said.

South African diplomat Andries Oosthuizen said it was troubling that U.N. appeals to address crises in Africa received scant money, citing an appeal to help drought victims in Djibouti which received just 5 percent of the required LIS $7.5 mil­lion. The appeal to help drought victims in Malawi also receiving little funding and now the situation has gotten worse -which means more money will be needed, he said. 

Sollle Dakota citizens resent judges' rights 
Associated Press 
PIEHRE, S.D. -A move­ment is underway in South Dakota to turn the tables on members of the bench. 

Activists are trying to put a radical measure on next year's ballot that could make South Dakota the first state to let people who believe their rights have boon violated by judges put those judges on trial. Citizens eould seek dam­ages or criminal chargHs. 
The measure would over­turn more than a century or settled law in the United States by stripping judges of their absolute immunity from lawsuits over their judicial acts. 

"The currnnt system donsn't work because thnre is no ade­quate way to hold a given judge accountable for improp­er behavior or to prevent them from judicial miseon­duct if they choose to do so," said businessman William Stegmeier, a leader of the movem(mt. 
Legal experts warned that such a provision 1:ould dan­gerously undermino tho indl~­pendence of South Dakota's judiciary, plungo the court system into anarchy, and run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. 
And they noted thorn arn already remedies available to the public: Bad ·ulings 1:an bo overturned on appnal, and judges who break the ruins can bn punished by statn dis­dplinary boards and, in South Dakota and other statns, voted out or of'lkn. 
Marie Failingnr, a law pro­fessor at llamlinn Univnrsity in St. Paul, Minn., said judi­cial immunity is s1~en as a way to protect judges' inde­pnndencn so they dm:idn eases on the merits, not in rnsponso to pressurn from tho eommu­nity or individuals.

Expressing ad111iration 

My name is Joe Horton, and I am a junior a't USC, columnist for The Daily Trojan, ardent Trojan football fan and son of Kurt Horton, member of the 1973 Sugar Bowl Irish National Championship team. 
I am writing to you today to express my admiration of your football-fandom. This year, ours was a game for the ages, and luckily for us, we eeked out the closest of monumental wins. We'll take it. 
But luckily for you, you have a terrific football team, and the meteoric ascent you have waited for is imminent (no Willingham phantom "return to glory" here). 
But most importantly, you have continued to uphold the qualities of character that have so defined your sehool. Charlie Weis is the ultimate sportsman, and I know I don't need to tell you that. 
The Southern California-Notre Dame rivalry has never been better. In a couple of years, when you are more than likely trouncing the Trojans, come to L.A. and catch the game. They'll be plenty of seats. 
Fight On. 
P.S. Can you sneak Texas onto your schedule by any chance?

Cherishing the tnemories 
For ten years running, I have been fortunate enough to attend one Notre Dame home game each year; sometimes you lost, sometimes you won. Most importantly you always show courage and class. We (our group, "The CT Crazies") enjoyed breakfast in the Oak Room with the students. I am always amazed by the respect and conduct towards one another and the guests of Notre Dame. 
The grounds meticulously maintained and, again, respected by the students. The atmosphere was not that of a mere college football game but uplifting to the soul! The Notre Dame Band playing on the steps of Bond Hall, the Honor Guard inspection, pep rally -all of it such a wonderful and pleasant experi­
ence. Notre Dame lore is fabulous. Notre Dame students, faculty and athletes all are extraordinary! The playing of the Alma Mater at the recent Navy game being respected by Charlie Weis and all of Notre Dame shows the world just how much class Notre Dame has! I moved south and am no longer part of the CT group but have memories that will last a lifetime as I watch every Notre Dame game on TV! Thank you for the memories.

What should it be, a 1W' or a 1C'? 
Drum beat. The all too familiar tune, like the flare gun in a race, sends 8,000 sets of pointer-finger­thumb combinations flying sky bound from the blur of yellow and green of the student section. The "Ws" fan up and down pointing toward the field as the chant of "Weis" echoes throughout the stadium. Yet the same recognizable beat reverberating through­out the stands, empowered by the bowing "Ws" rings with nostalgia for some of the student body-mem­ories of performing the same action half-heartedly last season following one disappointing loss after the next, brings a heavy case of deja vu many want to forget. 
Yet did Coach Charlie Weis not recognize this the potential negative connotation of the "W" in the minds of the fans at the USC pep rally when he requested that a "C" replace the "W"? Yet as Pavlov would predict, the music begins, and the "Ws" con­tinue to be raised. We can chant Weis, but how many have fully erased the memory of discouragingly going through the forced motions and mumbling "Ty" or (screaming in desperation for a "tie") for half or some of our college careers? Theoretically, "W" may also stand for "win" but the motion has been hammered into Notre Dame psyches to relate to "Ty," and the "W" has come to subconsciously repre­sent "Willingham." A "W" for win isn't what the fans truly want anyway-as a student, I want to see a hard fought, well-played, passionate, spirited foot­ball game (which consequently often results in a winning score) which our Notre Dame football team, fans. band, Irish guard and cheerleaders have quin­tessentially embodied this season. A word to repre­sent Weis, team is not "win," but "character," which can be symbolized in the "C." Alright, getting a little abstract. but back to the point: 
Why have the cheerleaders not adapted to the "C"? The leprechaun? The band? A confused student sec­tion now consists of mostly "Ws" offset by some non­conforming "Cs." Most hail "Weis" while few chant "Chuck." I've also seen a creative combination of a right handed "C" and three fingers on the left hand forming a "W." 
During this football season, constant debate has ensued over the shirt color, and now differences exist in cheers. We all agree on one thing: the awe­someness of our 2005 Fighting Irish football team. They're a pretty big deal, no one is denying that ­and although cheers are not, for the sake of honor­ing a request made to the student body by Weis. and for unity in our last home game this weekend, may I ask that we. as a student body, confident of and ready to support a "win" with "character" this week­end, answer the question: Are we going to raise a "W" or "C"?

CENE 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
The market is becoming increasingly saturated with sequels, a double-edged sword for the industry. 
Sequels allow developers to flesh out gaming worlds, giving increasing infor­mation to a ravenous gaming culture. The ever-increasing popularity of games such as "Resident Evil" and "Grand Theft Auto" are great examples of devel­opers building on an established fran­chise. 
To keep a franchise alive and growing, there must be signs of constant innova­tion, as well as remaining true to what made the originals appealing to garners. "Resident Evil 4" showcased this by making a huge departure from the established norm, doing away with the standard villain archetype and introduc­ing several plot twists to the overall con­tinuum. 
Developer Capcom also kept the fran­chise fresh by updating the gameplay mechanics. Unlike the previous versions, "Resident Evil 4" utilized a new camera and aiming system. The new camera made the action more personal, as the gamer was kept close to the hero at all times. 
"Grand Theft Auto" is another exam­ple on how to constantly keep a fran­chise appealing to garners. Developer Rockstar has established a library of recurring characters upon which to draw and focuses heavily upon charac­ter development. Since the entire "Grand Theft Auto" universe spans almost half a century, the gamer is given the chance to watch their favorite char­acters mature and develop. 
For example, the GTA universe was introduced to media-mogul Donald Love in "Grand Theft Auto 3." In the spin-off "Vice City," which was set roughly 20 years in the past, it was shown how Love learned how to become an entrepreneur. The player meets Love again in "Liberty City Stories." Taking place chronologi­cally between the other two, this is where the player helps Love implement what he learned in "Vice City." 
Because the stories are presented in a non-chronological manner, Rockstar can take a character and create a truly memorable video-game persona through the use of character history. But the pop­ularity of "Grand Theft Auto" is due to more than just sound development. 
The soundtrack is different for each game and can be a draw on its own. The series has featured artists ranging from Michael Jackson to Quiet Riot, each con­text sensitive in the time period the game is based. 
The basic gameplay is also updated from game to game, with the games controls and content being the biggest area for innovation. The latest console version of GTA "San Andreas" featured an aiming system from another Rockstar game, "Manhunt." Rockstar has also increased the variety of vehicles found within the game, including planes, motorcycles and helicopters as the series progressed. 
While having established sequels can be a great way to elaborate on an idea, it should be noted that they could also be detrimental. 
"Tomb Raider" is a great example of a franchise that was driven into the ground by lack of real innovation. The majority of the games released felt like clones of the previous ones, with heroine Lara Croft having to adventure though some lost tomb in hopes of raiding it. While it remained true to the title, this didn't translate to an ultimately fun experience for the gamer. 
"The Angel of Darkness" was sup­posed to be the re-imagining of the fran­chise. Featuring a darker, edgier Croft, the game was takeri out of the crypts and into many modern day settings. It even featured another playable charac­ter, one that was rumored to even start his own franchise. 
The game was marred by technical issues, however, and was inevitably too little and too late. Another "Tomb Raider" is in the works, but it is safe to say that interest has reached an all-time low for the series. 
Putting money into sequels also means that original, creative games tend to get overlooked. Their mega-budget cousins often overshadow games such as "Katamari Damaci and Call of the Cthulhu." This can discourage develop­ers from trying to break from the estab­lished norms and try something com­pletely innovative. 
With the X-Box 360, Plasystation 3 and Nintendo Revolution all looming on the horizon, developers-will bank more heavily on established brand names. It looks like sequels are going to play a major role in the industry for at least a few more years.

By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
Winter is coming, but for garners, things are just starting to heat up. Developers have released a deluge of games just in time for the shopping season, with another horde following them. 
The development for the current generation of consoles is winding down, meaning that this will probably be the last surge these consoles receive. But with so many options on the market, knowing which ones are truly worth the gaming dollar can become difficult 
Resident Evil 4 

A "Resident Evil" with no zombies? 
While that thought initially sent much of the gaming community into a fervor, they need not have worried. Released early in the year for the Nintendo Gamecube, it became an immediate early candidate for Game of the Year, a possibility that still remains. 
The game is a continuation of the franchise, despite the different prem­ise. Set four years after the last game in the series, it stars "Resident Evil 2" character Leon Kennedy. He is no longer a member of the Raccoon Police Department and now works for the government. Umbrella as a corpo­ration has fallen, but that doesn't mean an end to biological mischief. 
The controls for the game are tight and moving, with many environmen­tal interactions being controlled by a single button. This is showcased early in the game, when the player finds himself running from a group of deranged villagers. He has to block doors, kick over ladders and escape through windows, all of which is han­dled smoothly. 
The controls are not perfect, how­ever, though they stem more from gameplay decisions. The player is forced to stand still when firing, which while logical can get annoying when swarmed with enemies. There are also some segments that boil down to mashing a button, a trait that should have been killed in the '90s. 
The recently-released PlayStation 2 version has some bonus features that make it far superior to the Gamecube

From Russia with Love Shaken, not stirred? More like stag­nant 
"From Russia with Love" brings rel­atively nothing new to the franchise. While a solid effort, it has little to bring new fans to the genre. 
The game does mark a noticeable change in the Bond video game fran­chise. In a way, it is a return to Bond's roots. It's based off of the classic Bond movie of the same name, featuring a similar Cold War storyline. 
Accordingly, "Russia" is the first Bond game to star the Sir Sean Connery version of Bond as opposed to the Pierce Brosnan version. Connery even lent his voice talents and expertise to the game, creating a more authentic Bond. 
Appearances aside however, Connery's Bond controls much like Brosnan's from previous games. The in-game action is handled in a similar way to "Everything or Nothing," the last game to star Bond. One button is used to ready the current tool or weapon of choice, and another fires. The aiming controls can be a little dif­ficult to use when firing at objects in the environment, but it is a minor

Stubbs the Zombie in Hebel Without a Pulse Very ran'lly do garners see a game as innovative as "Stubbs." 
The premise is an old one. A man returns to life with a penchant for human brains. lie slowly creates a horde of walking dead, which eventu­ally leads to the downfall of the human resistance. Many games have already tackled this theme, the most noticeable being the "Resident Evil" franchise. 
Hut never before has the garner played from the zombie's perspective. 
Assuming the identity of Stubbs the Zombie, the garner adventures through a 50s version or the future. While it is uncertain if Stubbs has some ultimate goal in mind on his journey, one thing is immediately evi­dent from the start of the game­Stubbs is hungry. 
As Stubbs progresses through the game meeting and eating various citi­zens, he will find himself leading an ever-increasing horde of followers. Anyone the player attacks will rise as a zombie, and any person his zombies attack will also rise. This leads to sev­eral moments that could be lifted straight from a Romero movie. 
The game uses the original "Halo" engine, so fans will find themselves right at horne. Newcomers will find the controls intuitive and easy to pick up. 
If there is one complaint with the game, it is that it is too short. Easily beaten within 4-5 hours, many garners will lind the game too short for them. There is some replay through unlockable directors com­mentary and the harder difficulties, but that rests on personal preference. 
At $50, the game is a little pricey for all but the devout zombie fan. Check it out after a price drop, or rent it.-B 
Spartan: Total Warrior 
Action games are a dime a dozen as of late. With the choices currently out, "Spartan" may be better suited for fans of the old Greek and Roman tales. 
The gamer assumes the role of the Spartan, a faceless warrior among Sparta's warrior elite. The game begins with Home invading Greece, conquering the countryside easily and quickly. The last remaining city is the infamous Sparta. Hight before the Homan assault, Ares contacts the Spartan, promising him his godly sup­port. 
The arguments over historical accu­racy aside, this game takes its setting and runs with it well. As the Spartan, the gamer will face legions of Romans, and as the game progresses more mythical beasts as well. The boss battles, and often the skirmishes themselves are intense. 
They are also quite bloody. Limbs and heads are severed at an incredi­ble rate, earning this game its "Mature" rating. 
Bland graphics and a high difficulty hold this game back though. Several parts of the game feel almost too hard, making the "continue" screen a too-common occurrence. 
The slightly older "God of War" may be a better place for garners to get their ancient Greek fix, but there is still fun found in "Spartan."-C+

X-Box 360 Launch Date: November 22, 2005 

Photo courtesy of kotaku.com 

Microsoft's X-Box 360 marks the first console to enter the next generation of gaming. The deluxe package debuts at $400. 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
Nov. 22 will herald a new age for garners. It marks the arrival of the first of the next-generation of consoles, the X-Box 360. 
While it is too soon to make solid predictions, Microsoft looks like it is setting itself apart by releasing their console well ahead of the others with some solid launch-titles . 
The sequel to "Perfect Dark" looks like it will be the system's essential purchase, with develop­ment by Hare and a massive rnultiplayer component. Much like the original X-Box's "Halo," the sequel that once again fea­tures heroine Joanna Dark will probably be the system's strongest launch title. 
Fans of "Perfect Dark Zero" will probably also want to look into purchasing "Quake 4" and "Peter Jackson's King Kong." Both promise to be excellent first-person shooters, and early reviews for "Quake 4" have been positive. 
Similar to these but more of a wild-card is "Condemned: Criminal Origins." Developed by SEGA, the game places the play­er into the identity of a police investigator. The mix of action and forensic science should draw people in, but the actual execu­tion is yet to be determined. 
Racing fans will find "Project Gotham Racing 3" to be more suited to their desires, as well as "Ridge Racer 6." Screenshots show both utilizing impressive graphics and should boast a decent library of cars. A nnw "Need for Speed," a series that has always been fairly solid in its delivery, will also be making its appearance. 
Sports fans will have the largest library of games from whieh to choose at launch, their numbers induding "Arnped 3," "FIFA Soecer 06," and "Madden NFL 06," among a few other bas­ketball and hockey titles. i\ grand total of 18 titles will be available at launch, with others announced and in development. 
The X-Box. 360 also features limited backwards eompatibility, with the major sellers being the ones supported. That means it would be unwise to trade in the old X-Box, as there is no guaran­tee a game will be supported. 
The system retails for an impressive $400 with the hard­drive and some decent acces­sories, or a $300 bare-bones package. The hard-drive is required for the backwards com­patibility, however, and the accessories the $400 package gets make it the more economi­cal choiee. 
Pre-orders for the system have been full for months now, with retailers like Game Crazy report­ing having fully pre-sold their shipments as early as July. Interest is high, and with games like the first-person shooter "Gears of War" on the horizon, the X-Box 360's future looks bright.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
USC, Texas two wins away from Rose Bowl 
The country's two best teams are on pace to meet in the BCS championship game 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Only once before has a team been where Southern California and Texas are in the Bowl Championship Series standings and not played for a national title. 
The Trojans and Longhorns held the top two spots Monday, and are both unbeaten with three weeks left in the regular season. With two more victories each, they'll lock up spots in the Rose Bowl for a matchup that has appeared inevitable for months. 
USC is in first with a BCS average of .9829 and Texas is second at .9771. 
Miami is in third place with one loss, needing a misstep by the top two to play for a national title. 
BCS history says USC vs. Texas in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 4 is all but a sure thing. 
In the seven previous years the BCS has determined college football's champ, 12 undefeated teams have held one of the top two spots in the standings with three weeks to go. Only one of those teams -UCLA in 1998 ­didn't play in the BCS title game. 
Oklahoma was unbeaten and first in the standings heading into its final regular-season game two seasons ago, lost the Big 12 title game to Kansas 
State, and still played for the BCS championship. 
That year USC was left out of the title game and eventually shared a national championship with LSU. 
The Trojans and Longhorns are such a solid 1-2 in the BCS standings, the question that can now be asked is: Could USC or Texas lose a game and still reach the Rose Bowl? 
BCS analyst Jerry Palm said it's unlikely the Trojans or Longhorns could do what Oklahoma did in 2003 or what Nebraska pulled off in 2001, when the Cornhuskers lost their final regular-season game to Colorado and still played Miami for the BCS title. 
"The formula now is so poll driven that if you lose·late in the season you're pretty much dead," he said. 
After Oklahoma was No. 3 in the polls but still played LSU in the Sugar Bowl two seasons ago, the BCS revamped its for­mula to make the polls worth two-thirds of a BCS average and the computer rankings worth only one-third. Also, the strength of schedule component was eliminated because comput­ers and poll voters take strength of schedule into account. 
"Oklahoma was the last of those teams in the polls, but the computers and strength of schedule moved them up," Palm said. 


The key is the polls, and whether Texas or USC could hold one of the top two spots in the coaches' and Harris polls after a loss. 
That'd be a tough task for the Longhorns, who will be big favorites at Texas A&M (5-5) on Nov. 25 and in the Big 12 cham­pionship on Dec. 3 against either Colorado, Missouri or Iowa State. 
"Worrying about anything but A&M right now is just foolish," said Texas tight end David Thomas, reciting the party line. 
USC, which has been No. 1 in the AP, coaches' and Harris polls all season, looks to have the tougher remaining oppo­nents but both games are at home. 

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Chaney goes for SOOth win as coach at Temple 
The Owls look to advance in Preseason NIT with win over Army tonight 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA-One of John Chaney's first decisions at Temple was letting his players decide when to practice. 
Some preferred the afternoon, others the evening and a few did­n't care. When no unanimous decision could be reached, Chaney stepped in. 
"He looked around and said, 'OK, I'll make one for you. Everyone be here at 5 o'clock­in the morning!"' former Owls standout Ed Coe said. "So that's how that all started." 
Now, when Mardy Collins and Dustin Salisbery are sweating at the gym before most people sip their morning coffee, they can blame the players from Chaney's early years. 
"Yeah, but he probably would have done that anyway," Coe said. 
Coe's probably right about that. Through 23 seasons, 17 NCAA tournament appearances, a few controversies and lasting role as father figure, Chaney has gone 
his own way. Through it all, he's managed to 
I. 
' 
win. 
With a win against Army in the first round of the Preseason NIT on Tuesday night, Chaney will have his SOOth victory at Temple. The 2001 Hall of Fame inductee is 724-297 in 33-years as a coach at Division II Cheyney State and Temple, and 499-238 in 23 years with the Owls. 
The 73-year-old Chaney insists 
milestones don't mean as much as the people, the experiences and the stories. 
"It makes you take inventory of the people who have served you well, that have been great to the university," Chaney said. "It's the people that I love, people that mean a lot to me. When I look back, it gives me a chance to look forward." 
Some thought Chaney should­n't even be around for a shot at No. 500. He was suspended for three games last year for sending in a player to intentionally foul an opponent. Chaney never con­sidered stepping down and remains as stubborn and fiery as ever. 
"I still have enthusiasm, I still have the passion," Chaney said. "I still love these kids." 
The Owls have made five NCAA regional finals under Chaney, but they've never reached the Final Four and have played in four straight NITs. 
Still, when Chaney joined Temple in 1982, he took over a program that had only two NCAA tournament bids in the previous decade and wasn't widely known outside Philadelphia. 
He recorded his first Temple win in the first game of the 1982 season, 68-67 over George Washington, though the Owls fin­ished 14-15 for his only losing season. 
Coe sat out Chaney's first sea­son while recovering from a bro­ken foot. When Chaney replaced 
Don Casey, Coe considered transferring because he knew lit­tle about his new coach. Coe did­n't even know Chaney led Cheyney State in suburban Philadelphia to the 1978 Division II national championship. 
"He took it upon himself to put his hand out for me and that meant a lot," Coe said. 
Having to watch for a season gave Coe insight into Chaney. The coach has always been tough on his players, quick with a rebuke after a turnover, but there with a slap on the back for a job well done. 
Mark Macon, Temple's career leading scorer and now an assis­tant, was so awed by Chaney the first time they met that he com­mitted to the school without a visit. 
"Some of the words have changed in terms of what he says, but the education you get and the meanings are the same," Macon said. "The teaching style hasn't changed, the philosophy hasn't changed. It all goes back to the same point." 
No turnovers. Play hard. Study. 
"When I look back at some of the ones that started off with me years ago, the ones that I'm with now are just as important," Chaney said. "When I look at it, you see the many, many faces that have meant so much to me and continue to mean a lot to me." 
After the Preseason NIT, 
comes another Temple staple -a nonconference schedule scattered with Top 25 teams like No. 1 Duke, No. 5 Villanova and No. 15 Alabama. There's a method to Chaney's scheduling besides trying to toughen his team for the NCAA tournament in March. 
"By bringing in the Dukes, the Marylands, the Indianas, I brought the big teams here," Chaney said. "Nobody else brought them here."

The Bengals (7-2) are no longer looking f'or attnntion with an unbeaten tnam coming to town. Tlwy'rn more interested in a win that keeps them in first place in tlw AFC North, where they're currently tied with Pittsburgh. 
"Thoro's a lot more at stake," left tackle Levi Jones said Monday. "There's a lot more rid­ing on it than when we played Kansas City." 
That game will be remem­hernd in part f'or Johnson's

"I won't have no good stuff until Wednesday," he said. ''I'm not guaranteeing anything until Wednesday."

Carson Palmer said. "We're still shooting to win the rest of our games and hopefully get home­field advantag1~ and a bye week in the playoll's. We hope to beat them, and we hope they drop another game to give us that advantage." 
The Bengals are tied with Pittsburgh and Denver for the AFC's second-best record at 7-2. The team with the best record in each conference gets home-field advantage throughout the play­oft's, and the top two teams get first-round byes. 
Every time the Colts win, they stay two steps ahead of the pack. 
"That's going to be a huge game for us to go out and keep pace with several teams that are 7-2 right now," right tackle Willie Anderson said. "The more we can keep winning and stay­ing on pace, it's going to be bet­ter for us."

A-Rod edges Big Papi for AL MVP award 
Rodriguez becomes first Yankee to win elite honor since Mattingly in 1985 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Alex Hodriguez showed slick field­ing counts, winning his second American Lnague Most Valuable Player award in three seasons by defeating David Ortiz in a vote that rewarded an all-around player over a designatnd hittnr. 
Hodriguez, in his second sea­son as the Nnw York Yankees' third baseman, received 16 first-place votes, 11 seconds and one third for 331 points from the Baseball Writers' Association of America in bal­loting announced Monday. 
Ortiz, the Dll for the Boston Hed Sox, got 11 firsts and 17 snconds for 307 points. Los Angeles Angels outfielder Vladimir Guerrero received the other first-place vote and was third with 196 points. 
"I think defensn, for the most part, being a balanced player and also saving a lot of runs on the defensive side, I think was a major factor ·here," Hodriguez said. "To me, defense is foremost. It's always been. The White Sox showed us this year pitching and defense wins to this day." 
Voting was done before the start of the postseason, when both the Yankees and Red Sox were eliminated in the first round. Rodriguez hit .133 with no RBis in a five-game loss to the Angels while Ortiz batted .333 with a home run as the defending champion Red Sox were swept by the Chicago White Sox. 
"I would certainly trade his World Series championship for this MVP trophy," Rodriguez said, thinking back to Boston's 2004 title. "That's the only reason I play baseball. It's what I'm consumed to do right now." 
Rodriguez hit .321 with an AL-high 48 homers, 130 RBis and 21 steals, breaking Joe DiMaggio's 68-year-old Yankees record for home runs by a right-handed hitter (46). A-Rod also won the award in 2003, his final season as the Texas Rangers' shortstop before he was dealt to the Yankees. 
He didn't think the award would end criticism that he doesn't perform in the clutch or isn't a winner. 
"We can win three World Series, with me, it's never going to be over. I think my benchmark is so high that no matter what I do, it's never going to be enough, and I understand that," he said. "Maybe when I retire is when all critics and all that kind of stuff will end." 
Ortiz batted .300 with 47 homers, a major league-lead­ing 148 RBis and one steal. Big Papi had 34 RBis that put his team ahead, the most in the AL, and had eight RBis from the seventh inning on that gave Boston the lead for good. 
"He is the one special player right now, like Barry Bonds, who can change the game around simply with his bat­ting," Rodriguez said. 
Ortiz could not be reached for comment. 
"Without David, we don't make the postseason. David made an enormous impact on this team, and you can't understate his impact in the clubhouse," Red Sox teammate Curt Schilling said. "Congratulations to Alex. Either one of them could have won it. Both had MVP years." 
Hodriguez became the first Yankees player to win the award since Don Mattingly in 1985 and only the fourth play­er to win an MVP with two 
teams,  joining  Bonds  
(Pittsburgh  and  San  
Francisco),  Jimmie  Foxx  

(Philadelphia Athletics and Red Sox) and Frank Robinson (Cincinnati and Baltimore). 
''I'm very pleased with the year he had," Yankees manag­er Joe Torre said. "lie's getting more comfortable here in New York. Alex helped us win so many games, both offensively and defensively, and he contin­ues to improve." 
Still, A-Rod would have had a different approach in October if he had a chance against the Angels, who tried to pitch around him. 
"My one regret is 1 thought 1 could have walked 10 or 12 times and really just passed the baton and been a little bit mor·e patient," he said. "Probably at the end, I got a little overanxious." 
A-Rod also is the fourth to win at two positions, following Detroit's Hank Greenberg (first base and left field), the St. Louis Cardinals' Stan Musial (outfield and first base) and the Milwaukee Brewers' Robin Yount (shortstop and center field). 
The Yankees have won the award 19 times, the most of any team. 
"A-Rod demonstrates the tal­ent, hard work, and dedication of a true winner," Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said in a statement. "I look forward to great things for many years from A-Rod as a Yankee." 
Rodriguez also spoke pub­licly for the first time about a report in the New York Daily News this month that he was at a New York poker club. Playing at such clubs is not illegal, though it can be against the law to operate them, the Daily News report­ed. 
"Obviously, it wasn't the right thing to do," he said. "In retrospect, it's probably a place I shouldn't have gone." 
Rodriguez gets a $1 million bonus for winning the MVP for the second time during his record $252 million, 10-year contract. With Ortiz's second­place finish, the price of Boston's 2007 club option increases by $400,000 to $8.4 million. The buyout goes up by the same amount to $1.4 mil­lion. 
Guerrero got $200,000 for finishing third and Boston out­fielder Manny Ramirez gets $75,000 for placing fourth. 
Cleveland DH Travis Hafner was fifth and earned an auto­matic $200,000 annual raise to $2.7 million next year and $3.95 million in 2007, with the price of Cleveland's 2008 option rising to $4.95 million. 


AP Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez doubles in the fourth inning against the White Sox on Aug. 20. Rodriguez won the AL MVP Monday after hitting 48 home runs this season.

minute game, its not 89 min­utes long." 
For a team that is known for its strong o!Tensive attack, the defense has been just as con­sistent. 
Notre Dame's defense has not given up a goal in the last six games, dating back to a 5-1 win over Georgetown in the team's regular season finale. 
The Irish have outscored their opponents 55-1 since los­ing to Marquette on Sept. 30. 
"I know for a while we were trying to not let the other team have any shots on goal," Shaner said. "And if they did get shots on goal, just keeping the shutout was another issue. 
"Now we go into every game saying, 'This is our zone, and we are not going to let anyone by.' Dnfnnse wins games for you, so if you are always one goal ahnad, you're going to win nvnry game." 

But as well as Notre Dame continues to play on defense, it has not received the same recognition as the offense. 
"As in any sport, the offense usually gets more of the atten­tion," defender Kim Lorenzen said. "I mean, nobody really cares how many balls the backs win. The four of us in the back and even in the midfield­ers just really focus on limiting how many shots they get on goal." 
Notre Dame finds itself in an unlikely quarterfinals match against Yale Friday. Yale defeated the No. 3-seed Duke 2-1 Sunday on a last-second shot. 
"We all assumed that we'd be playing Duke, because we know Duke's a very good team," Shaner said. "By any means, we can't underestimate Yale because they obviously proved themselves, and any­thing can happen in the NCAA tournament."

Irish ink five solid recruits 
Notre Dame will go into next year minus five current seniors 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
In the middle of a very sue­cessful season, Irish eoach Debbie Brown announced last Wednesday the signing of a highly-touted recruiting class -perhaps the best in Notre Da­me's history. 
Five high school stand­outs signed letters of intent to join the Irish next season, replacing the five seniors the team loses to graduation at the end of this year. 
Outside hitter/middle block­er Megan Fesl of Arlington Heights, Ill., outside hitter Christina Kaelin of Lousiville, Ky., middle blocker Kim Kristoff of Carmel, Ind., setter Jamel Nicholas of Pittsburgh, Pa. and outside hitter/middle blocker Serinity Phillips of Valley Center, Calif., make up the heralded class. 
They are labeled as one of the top recruiting classes in the nation according to prepvolleyball.corn. Three of the athletes rank in the top 25 of high school seniors, while all five are ranked in the top 150. 
"It's a very strong class," .Brown said. "A lot of people

Squash club falls in Northwestern 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's shorthanded squash dub dropped a pair of matehes at Northwestern this weekend, falling to Northwestern, 8-1. Purdue, 7­1, and Penn State, 8-1. At No. 1, James Zhang, a formPr member of the Singapore National Junior team, estab­lished himself' as one of the top players in the Midwest as he remained undefeated on the season. Zhang avenged last year's 3-1 loss to Northwestern's Ed Gadient, with a 9-5, 7-9, 9-7, 9-7 thriller in the weekend's fea­tured match. Jose Palomo, Ben O'Brien, Randy Rainosek, and loves to punish people." 
Reuland would be a mar­quee recruit for the Irish if he chooses them over other schools recruiting him such as UCLA, USC, Miami (Fla.) and Stanford. He is 6-foot-6, 240 pounds and has a 4. 70 time in the 40-yard dash. 
"I don't know if he's the biggest recruit [Notre Dame is after]," Frank said. "I think IIrish running back verbal commitment] James Aldridge is a pretty big name. But Heuland is probably one of the top tight ends in the country." 
Contact Mike Gilloon at mgilloon@nd.edu 
Alex Forshaw, Leigh Chapman, and Chris Schalx all dropped 3-0 matches to the No. 27 ranked Wildcats. 
Zhang defeated Purdue's Justin Woo, 9-3, 10-9, 9-4, and Penn State's Aditya Shastri, 9­6, 9-4, 9-6, to highlight the weekend. The Irish competed without their No. 2 and No. 4 players, Javier Palomo and Phil Moss for the weekend, and starters Mike McConnell and Eric Sabelhaus are abroad this semester. This tournament was an opportunity for newer players to move up in the line­up and improve their games against experienced oppo­nents. A full squad will look to reverse these decisions after semester break.

assuming we win and move on to the next round," Dalby said. 
Western Illinois finished the season with a 6-9-4 record. The Leathernecks captured the Mid-Con Conference title for the sec­ond straight season with a 4­3 overtime victory over Oakland Nov. 13. 
Western Illinois is one of only two teams in the NCAA tournament with a losing record. Nonetheless, the Irish expect the Leathernecks to pose a stiff challenge. 
"I know they don't have a winning record, but they won their conference tournament so they are a team that's coming in on a hot streak," Dalby said. 
Seven teams from Big East conference made the tourna­ment. The only conference with higher representation in the tournament is the ACC with nine teams in the field of 48. Playing in such a com­petitive conference coupled with Notre Dame's tough non-conference schedule should benefit the Irish in the tournament. 
"I think this team has faced a lot of things that other Notre Dame teams of the past two years haven't faced," Dalby said. "I think our schedule helped us get into the tournament and hopefully it's going to help us stay in the tournament." 
If Notre Dame defeats Western Illinois Friday, it will then take on Indiana in Bloomington on Tuesday, Nov. 22. The Hoosiers, who have won the past two NCAA championships, enter the tournament as the No. 3 seed. The Irish lost 3-0 to Indiana at Alumni Field Oct. 26. 
Notre Dame is anxious to the start the tournament after an up and down regular season. 
"I think we are all excited and looking forward to it," Dalby said. "It doesn't matter what happened in the past. We are in the tournament and hopefully we can make a run." 
Notes: 

+ Three Irish players were recognized by the Big East coaches when the conference awards were handed out Friday. Dalby and junior mid­fielder Ian Etherington were first team all-Big East selec­tions, while sophomore for­ward Joe Lapira was named to third team all-Big East. 
Dalby, who was unani­mously chosen to the first team, felt honored by the selection, but said he was happier for his teammates. 
"ILapiral has the potential to be offensive player of the year next year," Dalby said. "And I think IEtherington] has done a great job this year so far. 
"Ilopef'ully both those guys ean really eome through in the postseason because we are going to need both of those guys to bP big."

about the interception he threw against the Midshipmen and the mistakes the offense made. 
"Our goal this past weekend was to not have any three­and-outs, and I think we found ourselves punting one time and not converting on a fourth down," Quinn said. "I think that's how we look at every game. We want to be nitpicky about things. Obviously it's a good thing, I think, if you're talking about what you are trying to look at as your goals and objectives." 
One of the goals Quinn set for Saturday's game against Syracuse (1-8) was sending the Irish seniors out on a suc­cessful note in their last game at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"You develop such close bonds," Quinn said. "This year, you almost feel like we're a family. You realize how impor­tant it really is when you want to send those guys out on the right note. The guys who will be playing their last home game in this stadium, I think, will be our biggest motiva­tion." 
And despite Syracuse's los­ing record and No. 6 Notre Dame being an overwhelming favorite, Quinn believes the Irish will still need to make strides in practice this week to be fully prepared for the Orange. 
"There's a ton of improve­ment [we need to make]," Quinn said. "When it comes down to it, fundamentals you can always improve on. Finding ways to make things happen when maybe you're at a standstill." 
Notes: 
+ Notre Dame occupies the No. 9 spot in the latest Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings released Monday. The Irish are sandwiched between No. 8 Alabama and No. 10 Oregon. Southern California maintained the top spot in the poll with Texas, Miami (Fla.), Penn State, LSU, Virginia Tech and Ohio State rounding out the top seven, respectively. Two of the three polls used as part of the BCS rankings formula -the Harris Interactive poll and the USA Today coaches poll have Notre Dame at Nos. 6 and 7. respec­tively.

No ex-'Cuse-es 
Irish quarterback not looking past Syracuse to future bowl game 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
Brady Quinn just had to laugh. "Is there a bowl you'd rather play in?" asked a reporter. 
"No, the only thing I'm wor­ried about right now is just Syracuse," Quinn responded. 
"Any thoughts on possibly playing Ohio State [in a bowl)?" asked the same reporter. 
"Right now I'm just focusing on Syracuse," Quinn said with a chuckle. 
Quinn is not letting the media know if he has any intentions of looking forward to the possibility of Notre Dame's first Bowl Championship Series [BCS] appearance since 2000.

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Defense strong all year 
Notre Dame gave up one shot in Sunday's win against MS U 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish do not give up many shots on goal, and they like it that way. 
In Notre Dame's 3-0 win against Michigan State Sunday, the team only gave up one shot on goal, and that didn't come until late in the second half. 
Michigan State was in Notre Dame's zone with less than two minutes left when Spartans forward Emily Weigand found herself in front of the net. Weigand fired a shot at Irish goaltender Lauren Karas, who dove and deflected the ball. 
The Irish defense quickly took control. 
"We don't want to give up that goal," defender Christie Shaner. "It was a pride issue. Especially with one minute left in the game, that's when you gotta stay focused. It's a 90­

Irish earn berth in NCAAs 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's soc­cer team breathed a little eas­ier Monday after learning it had been included in the 48­team NCAA Tournament field. With a 10-7-3 record overall and a 6-4-1 conference mark, the Irish were on the bubble heading into the 5 p.m. unveiling of the bracket on ESPNEWS. 
"It certainly was a relief," junior Irish captain Greg Dalby said. "But I think, at the end of the day, I would have been really surprised if we didn't get in." 
Notre Dame will host Western Illinois Friday at 5 
p.m. at Alumni Field. The Irish are excited to be playing at home in the first round.

fOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Weis, coaching staff closing in on Reuland 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
Unlike Notre Dame's game against USC on Oct. 15, there were not many recruits mak­ing official visits to campus to see the Irish beat Navy 42-21 Saturday. Almost 30 players made official or unofficial vis­its the weekend of Notre Dame's 34-31 loss to the No. 1 Trojans. 
Only two players trekked to South Bend on official visits this past weekend, tight end Konrad Reuland and line­backer Morrice Richardson. But according to Mike Frank of Irisheyes.com, the two high school seniors could be sub­stantial additions to an already strong Notre Dame recruiting class. 
Reuland is one of the coun­try's top recruits, as Scout.com has given five out of a possible five stars and lists the Mission Viejo, Calif. product as the No. 2 tight end in the nation. 
"I think Notre Dame did a 
really good job on Reuland," Frank said. "He's going to go visit Stanford this weekend but I think Notre Dame has a great shot to land him as well." 
The Irish have 19 verbal commitments so far this sea­son, though no one can sign an official letter of intent until February. Assuming all the verbal commitments sign let­ters of intent, Notre Dame has between six and eight scholar­ships still remaining to give out. 
"When you get down to this point the spots start filling up," Frank said. "I think a lot of players start feeling the pressure that if they don't do something soon they won't have a spot on the list." 
Richardson, the other visitor to campus last weekend, is very close to committing to the Irish, Frank said. 
"I expect him to do that here probably this week," Frank said. "He'll probably choose
