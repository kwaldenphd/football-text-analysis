Highlights and Low ligHt§,::: 
Saturday's nighttime football game against Michigan is being heralded coast to coast as an event ofimmense significance. Thousands of inches of newspaper space have been devoted to the fact that the team is going to play the same game under artificial light that they've been playing since the turn of the century under sun­light. 
The game is one of the hottest topics of the year on campus. Yet conversation tends to focus on the lights, the stars -or the tailgaters -rather than the game itself The name ofNotre Dame and the word "football" are intertwined to the point where the two are nearly synonymous. But is this obsession with "a game" war­ranted? 
Financially speaking, the appeal offootball cannot be denied. Football is big business at Notre Dame and cer­tainly the profiteering prospects are endless. The bookstore alone probably does enough business in one football weekend to finance the landscaping repairs made necessary by a slew oftramping alumni all season long. And what better organized donation drive than a weekend directed toward the loyal alum making his an­nual pilgrimage to see the ol' team "win one for the Gipper?" 
Likewise, the new Senior 
This Saturday night at the
Bar is "expected to make twice the profit as the for­mer one did," according to Dean of Students James Roemer in a Sept. 1 Observer article. Senior Bar is also ex­pected to uphold the tradi­tion of being a pre-game must for all ofSaturday's fans past the age of 21. This is in addition to the keggers and tailgaters taking place all over.Green Field. 
It is a sad comment on our society that alcohol is such an integral part of our recreation. 

The danger involved in al­cohol abuse is particularly serious for Saturday's game against Michigan. Starting the game at 8 p.m. more than seven additional hours of drinking beforehand. All-day pre-game festivities combined with late night driving conditions after the game make the potential for disaster on Saturday very real. 
But the problems of college football are not limited to the fans in the stands. The term "collegiate sports" these days, particularly regarding football, is in many respects a joke. The amateur-in-name-only status of most college teams contradicts everything the teams were meant to stand for. 
Stories abound concerning rule violations ranging from the practice of players being given cars and con­dominiums to being paid for non-existant jobs on campus. The University of Southern California is presently on probation because an assistant coach was found selling the free tickets the players are given. Arizona State and Oregon are also on probation. And these are only the teams that were found to be at fault. 
What this boils down to is that players are being paid

in the manner of professional athletes for what is supposed to be a contest ofamateurs. 
At its essence, football is a war game. The teams are armies, using a ball as an excuse to annihilate each other. Certainly no one can say we send the team out on that field each week in the name of camaraderie. Foot­ball has gone beyond merely competition; those players are out there for blood. It is fast reaching the point where an injury or maiming on the field is the only sure sign ofan "exciting" game. 
Notre Dame, as one of the nation's most respected colleges, and an avowed Catholic institution, should ex­amine more closely this "game" which has become a cornerstone of her reputation. College is supposed to acquaint us with the higher aspects oflife, not the base. 
Michigan game, between attending tailgaters and buying countless Irish foot­ball memorabilia, we should take a closer look at what has become the Notre Dame football· tradition. Perhaps some light will be shed on something more than .the field. 
I'm not saying money, al­cohol, and athletic prestige are the only motivations be­hind football at Notre Dame. Certainly they weren't in the University's earlier days. But we should re-examine the emphasis that football has taken at Notre Dame. Per­haps it began with the best 

somewhere along the line our priorities became confused. And it seems no one is noticing. 
Notre Dame has a well-deserved reputation com­parable to any other university in the country. Allowing that reputation to rest on the success orfailure ofa foot­ball team is ridiculous. Notre Dame should stand on its 
. own merit. When you are part ofa great institution, you don't have to win a football game to prove it.

Arafat meeting seen ·very·im·po·rtan·tWii'h')SORFUtG

as Vatican switch 
JERllSALP<i (AP)-Asenior Israeli official said Tuesda~ that by meeting PLO leader Yasser Arafat, Pope John Paul II will be breaking the Vatican's tradition ofneutrality and shifting to the side of the Palestinians. 
Plans for Arafat's papal audience, scheduled for Wednesday, brought an emotionally charged reaction from Prime Minister Mcnachem Begin, who compared the PLO's ac­tions in Lebanon to Nazi treatment ofEurope'sJews in World War II. 
Israel believes the papal audience gives political legitimacy to the Palestine Liberation Organization at a time when the PLO's power is in decline after its crushing defeat by Israeli invasion troops in Lebanon. 
The senior official, who asked not to be identified, said he saw the meeting as a change. from the Vatican position ofneutrality to sup­port for the Palestinians. "Even ifthe pope only shakes hands with Arafat, it would be considered with utmost gravity by Israel," said the official. 
The Vatican says t)le pope's meeting with Arafat has no political significance and that its concern for the Palestinians is humanitarian, not political. 
But the Israeli official said the Vatican was guarding its relations with the Arab world to protect Cat· holies who live under Arab regimes. He said the church was thus "giving in to political blackmail."

Begin and many Israelis touched by the Holocaust charge that the world watched in silence as one­third ofthe world'sJews were killed. 
"The same church that did not say a word about the massacre of Jews for six years in Europe and did not say much about the killing of Chris­tians in Lebanon for seven years is ready to meet the man who per­petrated the crime in Lebanon and is bent on the destruction of Israel," Begin was quoted as telling his Cabinet on Sunday. 
He referred to allegations that Pope Pius XII failed to condemn publicly Nazi anti-Semitism. Vatican documents show the church smuggled thousands ofJews out of Europe with Vatican-issued travel papers. 
The statement triggered an un­usually harsh response from the Vatican, which accused Isreal of distorting the truth on the church's record ofsavingJews. 
The angry public exchange dismayed Israel's professional diplomats, even though they tried to block the aal meeting with Arafat. 
Vatican sources said Tuesday that the pope was going ahead with the audience, which will be low-key and probably short -held in the late af.

Pope targeted for Polish ties 
New York (AP) -NBC news reported yesterday that it had un­covered evidence suggesting that Pope John Paul II was targeted for assassination with the knowledge and perhaps the assistance ofSoviet and Bulgarian intelligence agencies. 
NBC said the pope was targeted because of his connection to the Solidarity labor movement in Poland. NBC also disclosed that the Pope sent a handwritten letter to Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in 1980 in which he threatened to "lay down the cross ofSt. Peter" and lead the resistance by his Polish countrymen if Soviet troops moved in. 
The letter, delivered by a Vatican envoy, sparked a secret shuttle mis­sion between Moscow, Rome and Warsaw that led eventually to a tem­porary easing ofthe Soviet-Polish at­titude toward Solidarity, NBC said. 
The NBC report came after a nine-month investigation by cor­respondent Marvin Kalb and repor­ter Bill McLaughlin. The network released details of the investigation today in advance of the airing of a documentary, "The Man Who Shot the Pope-a study in Terrorism."It will be broadcast Sept. 21 . 
NBC traces what it calls an un­broken line from Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman convicted for the May 1981 shooting of the Pope organized crime elements in Turkey, the Bulgarian secret service and the Soviet KGB. 
NBC said bank records show that Agca deposited S10,000 two months before the assassination of Turkish newspaper editor Abdi Ipecki. Agca was convicted of .the murder, but later escaped from a maximum security prison in Turkey. In addition, Agca had large sums of money deposited for him in Turkish banks while he was a student at Is­tanbul University. 
NBC says that Agca appears to have been backed financially at every step of the way by organized crime in Turkey and that the Bul­garian secret service has strong ties to the Turkish syndicate. 
NBC quotes Vladimir Sakharov, a former KGB agent who defected, as saying that information held by the Bulgarians would also be known by the KGB.

Senior senators from Vermont and Nevada -Robert T. Stafford and Howard Cannon -had opponents who argued th t at years in office had made them forget the problems back home. Clent Zablocki, chair­man of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, faced a similar chal­lenge. 
In a conservative-liberal con­frontation, Democratic Gov. Edward 
J. King of Massachusetts locked horns with Michael Dukakis, t t he man he ousted from the statehouse four years ago. 
Dukakis taunted King as "a cheer­leader for Reaganomics," and said the King campaign was pocked by corruption. King emphasized a law­and-order stance, and called Dukakis a big spending liberal who raised

state taxes and would again. 
President Reagan'economic policies were a debating point in as­sorted primary contests, including several that involved candidates for Congress and governor who looked past token opposition to the cam­paign for the Nov. 2 general elec­tions. 
Wisconsin became the first of nine states to ballot on a nuclear freeze proposition, deciding by referendum whether to urge that the United States seek to negotiate a verifiable "nuclear weapons moratorium and reduction" with the Soviet Union. The Reagan ad­ministration opposes an immediate freeze, but the State Department said the Wisconsin wordin~ was am­biguous and might not be contrary to Reagan's insistence that weapons reductions should come first. 
Ten states settled contests or ratified unopposed candidates for governor, 10 more for senator. Among them, the primary states had 61 House seats, and new members of Congress will be chosen this year in six of those districts, two because of retirements, four because of reap­portionment. 
Mayor Marion Barry Jr. was up for Democratic renomination in the District of Columbia against former Cabinet secretary Patricia Roberts Harris and two city council mem­bers. The victor is virtually guaranteed election. 

Wisconsin approves anti-nuclearvote 
MILWAUKEE (AP) -Wisconsin voters gave overwhelmingly ap­proval yesterday to the nation's first statewide referendum on a nuclear weapons freeze, approving the;: measure by a 3-to-1 margin. 
With 382 of 3,625 precincts reporting, the vote was 58,861 or 76 percent to 18,640 or 24 percent. 
The Reagan administration refused to take a stand on the referendum on the ground that its wording is ambiguous. 
Supporters had predicted ap­proval ofthe measure, which is non­binding, despite a drafting error on the referendum ballot. And they had said that approval would send a message to Washington to begin im­mediate negotiations on the halting of nuclear weapons proliferation. 
A mistake in the wording of the question, the omission of"weapons" from the referendum as sent to county clerks by the state Elections Board, created some confusion. But the publicity focusing on the error was expected to increase rather than diminish voter interest on the issue. 
Residents of Brattleboro, Vt., voted overwhelmingly yesterday for a nuclear weapons freeze proposal. With 2 of 4 precincts reporting the vote was 526 yes, 65 no. 
A similar proposal was approved overwhelmingly Saturday by voters in Austin, Texas. In a straw vote in conjunction with a school bond referendum, the freeze was en­dorsed by more than 4 to 1.

The Chairs by Eugene Ionesco 
Tcui Btown 
featutes 
Eugene Ionesco, one ofthe greatest playwrights of the twentieth century, captures the difficulty that people have in their interactions with others. 
As the Old Man and Old Woman show, we settle for the customary, noninformative, "Hello, this is ...". We then continue onto the next unfamiliar face and repeat the same dialectic sequence. 
Each name the Old Man proffers to the other guests corresponds to a specific, distinctive person. The per­son that stands before him is unique with behaviors and mannerisms exclusive to that individual. 
Ionesco purports to identify each guest by a name that has been given to that face. A closer reading ofthe script reveals Ionesco's description ofthe difficulty of such interactions in a point ofdistinct irony. 
In the stage directions, he described the reality ofthis situation. He has given us faceless names by telling us that the guests are invisible. 
After finishing The Chairs, I recalled some ofthe many occasions here at school when I have participated in massive first semester, "let's get to know people" in­troductions. The obvious four questions were always asked -"what is your name, what is your major, where do you live, where are you 'from ..." 
A few ofthe people that I met in those crowds have since become close friends. However. the greater p~rt of them have become nameless faces, invisible except for the fact that I once met them and then dismissed them for one reason or another. 
The irony_ofIonesco's play hit home when I realized

that I had doomed many people to an eternal state ofin­visibility by refusing to pursue their acquaintance. I have always considered myself to be open-minded. I have tried to maintain a standard ofawareness to the uniqueness of the individual; so much so that I would never dismiss the experience ofany individual for a trivial reason such as what their major is. 
I discovered that I had been deceiving myself. I was reacting as prejudicially as those I had criticized for being close-minded. 
Prejudices exist according to our personal likes and dislikes. When we encounter other people, those prejudices surface. At Notre Dame, the "four big ques­tions" facilitate the process ofdiscrimination. 
My sophomore year abroad proved to be the heaviest piece ofevidence against my claim to open-mindedness and for my prejudicial nature. 
I managed to embed myselfin the "invisibility scam" while on the Saint Mary's Rome Program. All of my Notre Dame woman prejudices told me that Saint Mary's women were to be avoided, so proverbially put, like the plague. Given that conditions warranted my living in close quarters with 45 ofthem for the entire academic year, avoidance was absurd; but ignorance · and invisibility were not. To my chagrin and joy, I dis­covered that they were no different than Notre Dame women and in many instances, I found that I liked them better. 
That kind ofprejudicial attitude imposed unneces­sary difficulties on my life. I can only hope that by trying to maintain a sense ofopenmindedness that I was able to see them for what they were and not for what I thought they were. 
The beginning ofthis semester refocuses my atten­
tion on the memories of that semester in Rome and on 
my own first semester at Notre Dame. 

The questions with their regimented responses bring 
me laughter and .:ars. I laugh amazed at the shallow­
ness ofthe inquiries. I cry, grieving at the shallowness of 
the inquiries. The incidence ofArts and Letters majors 
mumbling to themselves, "Oh, well. An engineering 
major," is altogether too high. 

What is lost by not seeing what is there isnot nothing. 
I would hope that after reading Ionesco I would not 
t"".iU victim to the "invisibility scam" again. He has chal­
lenged me to see people as faces with names that I won't 
forget. 

Challenges are hard to meet but people aren't.

ince Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, an obscure Los An­geles duo with one ignored LP under their belts, joined Fleet­wood Mac in 1975, the Mac has become one ofthe most popular bands in America. Also, in a medium where popular success and critical acclaim are almost mutually exclusive, their albums have done well on both counts. In the seven years since their emergence out ofobscurity, they have displayed a mastery of the studio that no band since the Beatles has shown. This continues onMirage, Fleet­wood Mac's fifth album since Buckingham/Nicks joined up. 
Beginning with 1975'sFleetwoodMac, the band has shown a flair for writing memorable pop songs and at the same time never regressing into blatant commercialism. 1977'sRumours became the first album in modern times to yield four top-ten singles, and also sold around 12-15 million copies (the largest-selling LP in Warner Brothers Records history;FleetwoodMac is second, by the way). 
Tim Neely 
tecotd teview 
The 1979 Tusk was a big risk. Very few established acts take chances once on top; Fleetwood Mac did so and succeeded admirab­ly, puttingout one ofthe three best two-disc sets in rock history. Yet it was too chancyfor many buyers, and puttingout the most radically different songon the LP (the title song)as the first single did not help 
much -the LP sold "only" four million. A year later,FleetwoodMac Live showed that they sound good live and do not necessarily need 
million-dollar production costs backing them up. 
Mirage seems to strike a happy balance between the adventurism ofTusk and the pure pop ofRumours. There are songs like Nicks' "Gypsy," the LP's second single, which has parallels to other Nicks classics like "Rhiannon," "Dreams," and "Sara" without sounding like a clone ofthem. Nicks' three tracks show that her songwriting priorities remain with Fleetwood Mac, since only "Edge ofSeven­teen" on her recent solo album is as good as any ofthem. Then there is Buckingham's "Eyes of the World," which is the closestMirage gets to the more off-the-wall Tusk tracks like "The Ledge" and "That's Enough for Me": distorted guitars, twisted voices, Mick Fleet­wood's primitive drumming. 
Ifall one coul<j do with an album is draw parallels to the past, then it might be OK, but not really excellent. As usual, the band does move in other directions. "Hold Me," a song Christine McVie wrote with Robbie Patton (a fairly obscure singer who has had a couple of medium-sized hits), is one ofthe few duets you'll ever hear Fleet­wood Mac do. McVie and Buckingham team up on this, which was (deservedly) one ofthe big hits ofthe summer. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what makes this so good. Maybe it's the piano; maybe it's the blend ofthe voices; maybe it's the production ofBuck­ingham and the usual Mac production team of Richard Dashut and Ken Caillat. Actually, it's not any one thing; it's the entire effect of everything put together that makes it a great song. 
Other than the previously-mentioned "Eyes ofthe World," Buck­ingham's songs are not as far out as his Tusk offerings, but they offer 
many of the same qualities. A couple almost seem unfinished; they fade out just when they seem to be getting to the point. One thing you can never say about Lindsey Buckingham is that he is predict­able. The best ofBuckingham onMirage is "Empir~ State." The lyrics are mildly interesting, but again it is the band's incredible sophistica­tion in the studio that makes this more thm an ordinary song. Again, only the Beatles have ever used the studio in quite the manner that Fleetwood Mac has and yet not become totally dominated by it. 
As usual, this album was preceded by rumors ofFleetwood Mac's inevitable breakup. The rumors were even stronger this time be­cause oflast year's solo albums from Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, and another in the can from Christine McVie. However, every time this has happened, Fleetwood Mac has i come back sounding more together than ever. OnMirage, they have ~ combined the best elements ofRumours and the best elements of Tusk and come up with an album truly deserving of the word "classic."

Devine rejects USFL job 
PHOENIX (AP)-Former Notre Dame Head Coach Dan Devine, citing "a strong sense of loyalty and obligation" to his present employer, said yesterday that he has turned down a possible position with the Arizona Wranglers of the new United States Football League. 
In an exclusive interview with the Associated Press, Devine said he has chosen to remain as executive direc­tor of the Sun Angel Foundation ­the main booster organization of Arizona State University. 
"It's like a marriage," he said. "When you get married, you don't sayTil stay with this until something better comes along.' I was brought here to do a job. My future is tied to ASU." 
But Devine reiterated that he may return to coaching if Indianapolis, ever receives an NFL franchise. 
"That's the only thing that could get me back ... if I'm not too old by that time," said the 57-year-old Devine, who posted a 198-83-15 record in a combined 33 years of coaching at Arizona State, Missouri, Notre Dame and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.

LATE START-This year's season opener is the latest start for the' Irish since the 1973 opening-day victory over Northwestern on Sep­tember 22. 
DUERSON FOR THE DEFENSE -Tri-captain Dave Duerson has been a starter in the defensive secondary since .the third game of his rookie season. A versatile performer, Dave has played every position in the defensive backfield. He also leads all Irish players on the Irish roster in minutes-played over the last three seasons. 
Duerson is one of the premier punt-returners in Notre Dame his­tory. If he returns 23 or more punts this season, he will become the Irish career record-holder in that department. 
FULL HOUSE -Notre Dame Stadium is in its 53rd season oflrish Football. Saturday night will be the 45th consecutive capacity crowd of59,075, and the 93rd packed house in the last .94 games. 
CALLING THE PLAYS -Afterseveral seasons ofshuttling players in from the sidelines to call the plays, the Irish will use arm signals to call the plays from the sidelines this year. 
Another new wrinkle is the use ofthe 25-second clock, which limits te time a team can take betwen plays. The rule is enforced at the option of the home team. N.D. plans to use it, with clocks to be situated adjacent to the scoreboard in each endzone. 
STRENGTH OF SCH,EDULE -Five Notre Dame opponents this season are included in this week's AP Top Twenty They are: No. 2 Pitt, No. 8 Penn State, No. I 0 Michigan, No. I 5 Miami( Fla.), and No. 19 Southern Cal. Nobody said it would be easy. 
GO GET SOME KICKS -The Notre Dame soccer team, now 1·1-1, is looking to iron out its difficulties as it seeks its first-ever NCAA playoff bid. Today the Irish host Valparaiso and on Friday Ohio State comes to South Bend. The Irish must do well against teams in their region to obtain a bid, so do your part and go to a game. 
WEDDING BELLS-Two members ofthe athletic department staff were married over the summer. Congratulations to John Heisler, As­sociate Sports Information Director,and his new wife Karen Croake,a former Assistant Sports Information Director. Also tying the knot over the summer were Football Trainer Skip Meyer and Pam Colangelo. Many happy returns.

reality and I feel I am the least bit interested and I was contacted, 1 would talk to them. I'm leaving the door open," Devine said. "I think people wanted me to leave a hair in the door with the Wranglers, too. But I wouldn't feel comfortable that way. I felt that a conflict of interest was bound to arise." 
Devine was hired by the Sun An­gels last Feb. 15, but had been con­sidered the top candidate to become head coach and/or general manager of the Wranglers even before the franchise moved here from Los An­geles in August. 
"In fairness to everyone, I thought this is time to clear the air," Devine said, reading from a terse two­paragraph statement his secretary was to deliver to other media mem­bers last night. 
"I didn't want to have a press con­ference because I thought it would be presumptuous for me to turn down a job I never really had. But ifI didn't withdraw my name, nobody would." 
Speaking from a corner booth ofa Phoenix hotel coffee shop, Devine said he reached his decision "over the weekend" after discussions with Wrangler co-owners)im joseph and Brad Liebman. 
Sources say the two parties mutually soured on one another af­ter Devine desired part-ownership of the team, a yearly salary in the $300,000 range and wanted to hand· pick his squad members, front office personnel and assistant coaches. 
Former Irish Coach Dan Devine has turned down a job that wasn't even offerred -as coach ofthe USFL 's Arizona Wranglers.

would go for naught. However, once again, the Irish fought back and won the first game. 
Notre Dame used the momentum that they had picked up to sprint out to a fast lead in the second game. Utilizing some Michigan State mistakes and playing exceptional defense, the Irish jumped out to a quick six-point lead. 
The Spartans fought back again, closing the gap to 11-7. just as it ap­peared that the party might be over for the Irish, though, they buckled down and won the last four points of the game for the victory. 
The Irish once again were rolling in the third game as they jumped out to another early lead. The score went to 11·7 in Notre Dame's favor and it looked like a sweep was im­minent, but Michigan State fought back, winning eight straight points for a 15-11 victory. 
In the fourth game, the Spartans finally used their size to an ad­vantage, spiking hard shots at the feet of the Irish players. They jumped out to an early lead and stopped another Notre Dame come­back attempt to win easily. 
Going into the last game things did not look too promising for the Irish. Michigan State was playing well and had the momentum.

Again, Notre Dame showed that 
they were going to play rough. They 
took the early lead and forced the 
Spartans into some critical mistakes. 
Sensing a victory, the Irish played al· 
most flawlessly on their way to a 15­

best-of-five match, three games to 
two. 

"I'm really pleased about the fact that the girls came back after they lost momentum," said VanSlager. "It's typical to lose momentum, but the girls put their heads together and decided to get the job done." 
Freshman Karen Bauters looked very impressive in leading the team's offensive attack. She served well and !!Cored consistently through all five games. 
All the other players did well also. Mclaughlin, .Josie Maternowski, Mary Jo H~nsler. Terese Henken, Tracy Bennington and Julia Pierson ran their offense well and played ex· cdlent defense.

Irish women top rivals, injuries 
By DAVE STANG 
,\ports Wn'ter 
The Notre Dame women's tennis 
team was victorious yesterday over 
Wheaton College, its Division III op­
ponent from Wheaton, Jll. The team 
overcame numerous injuries to post 
an easy 7-2 win. 
The major injury belonged to Sue Panther at No 1 . I singles, who was forced to default during her match against Jane Nelson because of pain in her back. At No. 2 singles, Laura Lee ignored her sore ankle to win 6­3, 6-l over Wheaton's Linda Beturian. Freshman Mary Colligan had an easy time with Laura Lindstrom, 6-0, 6-0. The No. 4 Notre Dame singles player, Lisa LaFratta, defeated Pam Moorman of Wheaton 6-2, 6-3. No. 5 Cathy Schnell beat Kate Werner 6-1, 6-2. At No. 6 
singles, Notre Dame's Camille Cooper overcame a pulled muscle in her leg to defeatJan Nelson 6-2, 6-0. 
Coach Sharon Petro was rightfully concerned about her team's injuries. 
''I'm nervous about all of our in­juries, hut once we're past them, we'll he tough," she said. The in­juries forced Petro to shake up the doubles alignment. Because the second and third doubles teams each moved up a notch, Lisa Gleason and Louissa DeMello were given the opportunity to play doubles togeth­er for the first time. They played well at No. 3, where they defeated Wheaton's Kate Werner andJan Nel· son 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. At No. 1 doubles, Colligan and LaFratta lost to Jane Nelson and Laura l.mdstrom 6·7, 2-6. Yesterday's No. 2 team of Schnell and Roemer heat Wheaton's Moor­man and Buturian 6-3, 6-0 in an exciting match. 

"Wheaton wasn't as tough as in the past because they've lost some players to other s<.·hools due to scholarships," reflected Coach Petro. But she related her happiness with the team when she said, "Everyone played well, especially at singles."

Cocktail Night 9pm-3am 0 IRISH BEAT WOLVERIN 
U.S. District Judge Juan Burciaga ofAlbuquerque, N.M., who presided in the suit brought by Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association, mailed his decision to the Oklahoma City federal court to be filed later today, said a clerk at his office who refused to be identified. 
A University of Oklahoma official who asked not to he identified said yesterday the plaintiff-; were told that Burciaga ruled in their favor but expected the NCAA to appeal the case. The ruling would not be an­nounced until today, he said. 
Andy Coats, the Oklahoma City at­torney who represented the plaintiffs, said. "We understand that there was a rather lengthy opinion and that it holds generally in our favor." 
The two schools claimed the NCAA violates the Sherman An­titrust Act in controlling the televis­ing of college football and asked Burciaga to allow them to make their own deals despite a J263.5 mil­lion NCAA contract with two televi­sion networks. 
Tom Hansen, assistant executive director ofthe NCAA, said yesterday in Kansas City that association offi­cials had not heard that Burciaga had reached a ruling. 
"There could be so many different rulings that could go against you," he said.

Sports Writer Items 
Author's note: For the past threeyears this column has been writ­ten by Bill Marquard. While no one can possibly hope to fill his shoes, I will attempt to continue IRISH ITEMS in the same tradition. 
THE SERIES -Michigan holds an overall edge with a record of 1I-4,the only Notre Dame opponent this year to boast a series edge. Since 1978 the Irish and the Wolverines have split two games, with Notre Dame winning two spinetinglers, 12-10 in 1979 on the foot of Chuck Male, and in 1980, 29-27 on Harry Oliver's last-second 51-yard field goal. 
IRISH NIGHT LIFE -Saturday night's game under the lights is a first at Notre Dame Stadium. In night games away from home the Irish have a 1 5-4-1 record -including one Gator, two Orange, and two Sugar Bowl wins. The 1980 season was the last time Notre Dame played under artificial lighting, when they beat Arizona 20-3. Also in 1980, the Irish played indoors under the lights, in the Superdome against Georgia at the Sugar Bowl. 
The lighting units will be mounted on the end ofa 140-foot retrac­table boom fastened to one of six tractor trailer trucks surrounding the stadium. Musco Mobile Lighting, Inc., of Oskaloosa, Iowa, will provide lighting not only for the stadium, but for all surrounding parking areas as well. 
COPING WITH CARTER -Gerry Faust and Bo Schembechler will each have trouble defending against the offensive output of an op­ponent named Carter -tri-captain Phil for the Irish and speedster Anthony for the Wolverines. 
Phil Carter was last year's leading rusher with 727 yards in 165 carries and has a career total of 1,694 yards in 378 carries. He is presently Notre Dame's 13th-best career ground-gainer. Phil is joined on the Irish roster by two other Carters -Mansel, a junior adefensive end, and Ray, a freshman tailback. 
Michigan's Anthony Carter has 118 career receptions for 2232 yards and 29 touchdowns. Six of those receptions have come against the Irish -resulting in two touchdowns. The Wolverine speedster also returns punts (62-637 yards) and kickoffs ( 49-1246 yards). 
"Anthony Carter is the type of ballplayer who can dominate a game by his sheer presence," says Faust. "He may only catch a couple of passes per game, but just the fact that he lines up out there on the outside every play drives a defense nuts.
