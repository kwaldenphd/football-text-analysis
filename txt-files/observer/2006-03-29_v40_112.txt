Administrators question Facebook postings 
Faculty, staff at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's view students' profiles 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
A<> a growing number of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students poke, post and tag their way into the Faccbook universe, administrators on both campuses are taking a closer look into the social­networking Web site -in some cases, creating their own accounts and viewing student profiles. 
Facebook, created two years ago by Mark Zuckerburg, has exploded in popularity across college eampuses nationwide. And since the only requirement for membership is a ".edu" e-mail address, virtually any staff member with a University e-mail address can join. 
Assoeiate Vice President of Student Affairs Bill Kirk said there is no formal policy "that would

Officials at institutions nationwide use site to identify, punish students 
By KATIE PERRY Assistant News Editor 
Facebook.com, the online social network and cultural phenomenon availed by millions of col­lege students across America, is spreading to reach an even broader audience -nearly any­body with a ".edu" e-mail address. 
And that shift is beginning to have repercus­sions for students. 
Since February 2004, the popular Web site has garnered more than six million members, a majority of which log on at least once a day, a spokesman told the Chicago Sun Times in November. Each day, between 10,000 and 20,000 new members register on Facebook.com.

Wedding bells toll as graduation approaches 
By KAREN LANGLEY Associate News Editor 
Notre Dame seniors Victoria Wittner and Dan DiMassa first discussed marriage while studying abroad in Innsbruck near the end of sophomore year. While Wittner and DiMassa -who began dating at the beginning of that year -knew they were right for one another, they decided not to take any definite steps towards marriage until gradu­ation drew near. 
And drew near it did. 
As the two drove to DiMassa's Cleveland home the first weekend of the fall semester, they approached a roadside spot wher:e they tra­ditionally stopped to kiss. DiMassa flicked on the car's hazard lights as he pulled over, and while such a stop was hardly unusual, Wittner knew something was going to happen. 
"I asked myself, 'Is he going to propose?"' Wittner said. "I said, 'No, Victoria, don't be stupid. That's not what's hap­pening."' 
Then DiMassa got down on one knee and asked Wittner to marry him. 
She said yes. 
There is no count of how many Notre Dame undergrad­uates are engaged, but enough couples make the commitment each year to keep stories of Grotto propos­als and "ring by spring" Basilica bookings alive. And while the vast majority of stu­dents wait until after college to decide on marriage, many engaged eouples can be char­acterized by the uncommon certainty that they are right for one another.

College completes self-study 
-By MEGAN O'NEIL Senior Staff Writer 
Two years of research and self-analysis will come to a head at Saint Mary's today as repre­sentatives of the Higher Learning Commission conclude a three-day campus visit as part of a reaccreditation process. 
Led by Vice President and Dean of Faculty Pat White and Director of the Center for Academic Innovation Pat Pierce, the College compiled a 134-page self-study report that examines the progress of the institution over the last ten years and its direction in the future. 
Pierce described the report, two years in the making, as a "really unique one ... very dif­ferent from accreditations in the past." 
In the past, the report has been more like an inventory of the College, Pierce said, and included data such as the num­ber of students enrolled and the number of volumes in the

Three phones and counting ...

lives ... 
This year. I learned that nothing in life comes nasy. All college students are faced with daily challenges and, as part of' the grow­ing up process, Katie Kohler need to deal with them without tlw help of their par-Wire Editor ents. Some things that senrn simple ean just drive you crazy. What spe­cil'ie simple thing I am rnferring to is the almighty cell phone. 
I have had the unfortunate experi­ence as to break/drop/lose/damage my cell phone multiple times this year. Was it my fault? Well, yes, sometimes it was. Dropping the cell phone down multiple flights of stairs was all nw. Some things, though, were out of my control. I mean who put that toilet there? 
Going against my parents' advice, I guess a belt clip would avoid all of the dropping and mishandling, but what fun is that? 
For me, it is hard enough to keep track of my cell phone, but trying to get a new one entirely in South Bend is a nightmare. It has taught me to appreciate the essence of the cell phone and protect it with my life so I don't have to go through that ordeal again. 
You would think getting a new phone would be easy, but both times I had to replace my poor phone· I ended up paying full price for a whole new one because it was too much of a hassle to go through the motions of liling a police report for losing it (yes, you actually have to do that if you have insurance). explaining it to my parents, or acti­vating a new one. And I even had insurance! What is insurance for if you have to buy a new phone every time'! 
I am not blaming any of my mis­fortune on Verizon -even though it would make my parents feel better -but just the overall process. Ugh. 
Spending the entire day at the mall trying to plead with Verizon to give me a new phone is really drain­ing. It n~ally is. 
II' you know what kind of phone I have, you would probably be shocked that al'ter all that work, I don't have the top-of-the-linn phonn. I am smarter than that. My new phone has been the cheapest. most durable and biggest piece of equip­ment in tlw store. 
Surn, it would be cool to have a nnw Hazor or a camera phone, but with my consistent history of bang­ing up my cell phorw, that makes no sensn. 
I am proud to say that I have had my newest e1dl phorw for two months-knock on wood -and I have not benn back to Verizon yet. Impressive, eh? 
Oh. it's the little things in life that bring us thn most satisf'aetion.

Man wards off alligator with broom 
NORTH FORT MYERS, Fla. -An 82-year-old Lee County man says he tried to get an alligator out of his garage with a broom. John Turney says he also used the blue straw broom to kept the 4­foot reptile from biting him. 
The gator later went under Turney's ear that was parked in the driveway and Turney sprayed it with a garden hose. The alligator finally didn't leave until three other people prodded it, lhrdng the reptile to go back lo a lake. It had apparently spent the night in Turney's garage in North Fort Myers.

CLAP anticipates response to report 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Editor 
After presenting a report on the living wage to University officials on March 8, members of the Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP) will get to hear the admin­istration's response in a meeting scheduled for Friday -appropri­ately, the end of Notre Dame's Week of Action. 
CLAP lead organizer Kamaria Porter said the meeting, which indudes representatives from stu­dent government as well as ClAP members. is the first oflicial feed­back thfl group will receive from administrators since distributing the report asking for the institu­tion of living wage at Notre Dame. 
Porter said Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves, Associate Vice President for !Iuman Hesources Bob McQuade, Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers and possibly University President Father John Jenkins were expect­ed to attend the meeting. 
A'i defined by the report, a living wage is "the hourly rate of income that a worker in a specific area must make in a 40-hour work­week to support a family of four." 
Porter said CI.AP hopes it comes out of the semester -if not Friday's meeting -with the cre­ation of a joint task force made up of students, campus workers, administrators and potentially alumni. 
"[The task force] could bring together the scholarly minds in theology and economics, the administrators who deal with budgeting, the students who gen­uinely care and have been researching this for quite awhile, the workers who are affected by this and who do not currently have a voice and the alumni who are invested in what happens at this University," Porter said. 
Harvard University instated a similar joint task force to support their campus living wage move­ment, on which Porter said ClAP modeled their idea. Notre Dame's task force would work to fmding a way to implement the living wage while still maintaining an "effec­tive and efficient university," Porter said. 
Porter said she doesn't know what will happen at Friday's meeting but said CLAP will remain optimistic and open-mind­ed. 
"CLAP has done a lot of talking up to this point, so now 'we're ready to listen," she said. 
As part of the Week of Action, today is also ClAP Day. The group will work to raise awareness of its cause and encourage students to sign a living wage petition, Porter said. She said the petition current­ly has approximately 600 signa­tures.

Students aid social service agency 
Notre Dame students win Indiana Careers Consortium competition 
Special to the Observer 
Four teams of students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's College, Goshen College and Indiana University South Bend weren't told much about issues facing the Marshall County Neighborhood Center in Plymouth, Ind. -only that it was having difficulties meeting the needs of the community's changing demo­graphics. 
With that limited informa­tion, and in the spirit of the first case competition hosted by the Indiana Careers Consortium earlier this semester at Saint Mary's, their task was to fill in the missing pieces through research and then offer solu­tions. 
One of the oldest social service agencies in Marshall County, the Neighborhood Center, a United Way agency, was founded 23 years ago and currently r-uns a food pantry; provides clothing, fur­niture, appliances, household goods and toys; and offers life skills, budget counseling and energy assistance. 
While most of these services have always been offered there, a recent restructuring of the center's board of direc­tors resulted in a new goal. Rather than simply handing out charity, the center now strives to foster independence among its beneficiaries. 
"Because of our changes, we needed help creating a new public image and revis­ing our internal structure and fundraising efforts," said Jerry Nikitas, the center's director. 
That's where the students came in. But, under the guidelines of the competition, . they weren't told exactly what was needed unless they asked the right questions. 
"The lack of 'The lack of "They were so information information well prepared provided to us and confident in

Their efforts paid off. Presenting a variety of ideas for fundraising, community outreach and volunteer efforts, the Notre Dame team won the competition and the admiration of their advisor, Thomas Harvey, director of the Master of Nonprofit Administration Program in Notre Dame's Mendoza 
College of 
Business. 

"We were told very little about the true nature of the center's problems. The competition required a lot of investigation before we could begin." 
After a 15-minute question­and-answer session with Nikitas, Williams and his teammates, Matthew Mitchell, Rebecca Spohrer and Danielle Stealy, all sen­iors at Notre Dame, went to work. They dedicated the bulk of their free time during the first week of the semester to learning all they could about non-profits and brain­storming about the center and its surrounding commu­
community center run more effi­ciently," Harvey said. 
Their ideas weren't earth­shattering, according to Williams, just well represent­ed. 
"We gave a few simple solu­tions that were applicable to problems the center likely will face in the future," he said. "I guess what impressed the judges was the way in which we presented our rec­ommended changes, which included strategic partner­ships with other organiza­tions in the community to help expand their budget and services."

Seniors Chelsea Horgan and Ryan O'Larey knew from the beginning that they would one day marry. They met at a Keenan Hall dorm party in the spring of their sophomore year and got engaged the following fall when O'Larey proposed on the Dumbo ride in Disney World. 
A week into their relation­ship, O'Larey said, "So this is what it feeJs·like to fall in love." 
Two years later, that conclu­sion has only been reinforced.

tually get married," he said. "When we knew, we knew. I would have felt completely comfortable asking Chelsea to marry me after the first week of our relationship." 
Though she acknowledged some people might think jun­iors young to give or receive proposals of marriage, Horgan echoed O'Larey's certainty in their decision to get engaged. 
"We never really gave a thought to postponing the inevitable, so we were willing to get engaged really early," she said. "It was something we have always been serious about, and we're more and more excited to get married." 
Horgan and O'Larey will marry in July. Seniors Gretchen Ryan and .lonny Struemph can't remem­
her exactly when they first talked about marriage, but like Horgan and O'Leary, they quickly grew sure they wanted to spend their lives together. 
"It was probably earlier than most people would expect," Struemph said. "When we got into a relationship, it felt right from the start." 
Junior Daralee Thomas said she first spoke of marriage after three or four months of dating her fiancee, Indiana University junior Zach Hughes. Since they began dating in col­lege, their relationship devel­oped over long phone conver­sations -a condition that she said prompted them to get to know each other much deeper than if they had been physical­ly together. 
"You hear older people say, 'Sometimes you just know,' and for us, that's what it was," she said. "It didn't take a lot of thinking. It didn't take lot of talking. I just knew. Neither of us could believe it happened that way for us." 

Young people often see engagement as a time of tran­sition into a truly adult world, and engaged students now have to balance a mature com­mitment with their time left in

"We've pretty much been inseparable since freshman year," Ryan said. "I live in a quad, and my roommates joke that Jonny is our fifth room­mate." 
Since they continue to spend time with close friends, neither Ryan nor Struemph considers their serious relationship and subsequent engagement social­ly isolating. 
"All our friends have been really accepting of each other as friends," Struemph said. "It hasn't been a social hardship." 
Since being engaged, howev­er, the two have sometimes encountered new expectations of their social lives from friends. 
"I remember one of our friends making a comment when we were going out to a club that 'You guys are engaged, you don't do that any­more,'" Ryan said. "But we still like to have fun." 
DiMassa described himself and Wittner as "somewhat reserved" and said their inter­ests more frequently lead to nights at the movies or a book­store than to the bars or clubs -but Wittner added that these preferences have little to do with their engagement. 
"Some of our friends view our social lives as geriatric," 
friends. 

Thomas' family and many of her friends are thrilled by her engagement, but she said many acquain­tances did not expect her to marry while still in college. ller wedding is scheduled for the .July before her senior year. 
"A lot of people reacted with surprise,'' she said "One friend brought up the dif'ficulties, out of concern." 
Thomas said her parents have been extremely support­ive of her decision, and she plans to rely on her parents as well as her husband for sup­port as they spend their first year of married life apart while completing their degrees. 
While Hyan is more than excited about marrying Struemph, she said she would not have predicted that she would marry immediately after college. 
"This was not how I pictured my life in high school," she said. 
Struemph agreed. 

"Now you're used to hearing of people being in their upper twenties when they get mar­ried, not their younger twen­ties," he said. 
But love can defy societal norms, O'Larey said. 
"When I called my dad to let him know that I planned to ask Chelsea to marry me, he agreed that love can just sneak up on you," he said. "And once you know what it is, you don't ever want to let it go."

DiMassa said. "Some of our interests don't fit the college stereotype." 
But since his relationship with Horgan began, O'Larey said maintaining close relation­ships with other friends has been difficult. 
"Being with someone [who] you don't get sick of and want to spend all your time with can definitely cause issues with your social life," O'Larey said.

Ex-Liberian warlord disappears 
Aj3UJA, Nigeria -Former Uberian warlord Charles Taylor slipped away just after Nigeria reluctantly agreed to transfer him to a war crimes tribunal, and the White House suggest­ed Tuesday that President Bush may cancel a meeting with Nigeria's leader. 
The Nigerian government said Taylor van­ished Monday night from his villa in the south­ern eity of Calabar, where he had lived in exile since being forced from power under a 2003 peacn deal that ended Liberia's civil war. 
The announcement came three days after President Olusegun Obasanjo -under pres­sure from Washington and others -agreed to surn~nder Taylor to a U.N.-backed tribunal. He would be the first African leader to face trial for crimes against humanity.

Scattered violence erupted in Paris, and riot police used water cannons and tear gas to dis­perse several thousand youths who pelted them with stones and bottles after an otherwise peaceful march. 
Police made 787 arrests around the country -488 of them in Paris, National Police Chief Michel Gaudin told The Associated Press. Injuries in the capital were tallied at 46 demon­strators and nine police oflicers. 
lntf~rior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy later invited some 200 police oflicers, some still wearing their protective gear, to the Interior Ministry for wine and snacks.

Moussaoui offers self-testimony 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -Al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui offered last month to testify for prosecutors against himself at his death-penalty trial and told agents that he did not want to die in prison, according to last-minute testimony Tuesday. 
The bizarre testimony capped a trial that has seen more than its share of the unusual over three tumultuous weeks. Introduced as part of a brief government rebuttal case, this testimony may be the firmest evidence the 37 -year-old Frenchman of Moroccan descent hopes for martyrdom through execution and could provide fodder for the closing argu­ments of both prosecutors and Moussaoui's court-appointed defense attorneys. 

War-crimes trials trouble Court 
WASHINGTON -Supreme Court justices appeared troubled Tuesday by President Bush's plans to hold war-crimes trials for foreigners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
And several seemed outraged by the gov­ernment's claim that a new law had stripped the high court of authority to hear a case brought by Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who once worked as a driver for Osama bin Laden. 
Hamdan has spent nearly four years in the 
U.S. prison at Guantanamo, and the Supreme Court has been asked to decide if he can be put on trial with fewer legal protections before a type of military tribunal last used in the World War II-era.

Olmert declares party's victory 
Acting Prime Minister vows to resolve border issues, lead negotiations 
Associated Press JERUSALEM -Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared victory for his centrist Kadima party in Israel's elections Tuesday, vowing to act on his own if necessary to draw Israel's final borders and "painfully" uproot Jewish settlers if negotia­tions with the Palestinians are notpossible. Standing below a massive portrait of his mentor Ariel Sharon, Qlmert addressed chanting Kadima members after exit polls and media reports of early results pre­dicted the party would have enough seats in par­liament to form a ruling coalition. Building on the vision of Sharon. who formed the party shortly before suc­cumbing to a devastating stroke that left him in a coma, Olmert claimed a mandate to withdraw from much of the West Bank and set Israel's borders, which he has said he will do by 2010. The turnout was the low­est in Israel's history, and the results showed voters turning away from conven­tional political parties to an assortment of third parties with agendas ranging from pensioner rights to the 

legalization of marijuana. The aftermath will likely be a period of difficult negoti­we will move to set the group. Incoming not wait indefinitely for a

Bush names Bolten new chief of staff 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Struggling to revive his troubled presidency, President Bush replaced longtime chief of staff Andy Card with budget director Joshua Bolten on Tuesday and gave Bolten authority to make further changes in a White House staff that even Republicans have complained is tired, insular and lack­ing fresh ideas. 
Appearing with Bush in the Oval Office, Bolten gave no hint about what, if any, shake-up he might order. But White House officials said no one should doubt his ability to replace Bush aides. "He'll have all the authority he needs ... to make the decisions that he feels best, working with the president," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. 
Like Card, Bolten, 51, is a Washington insider whose ties reach back to Bush's 2000 campaign for the White House. Democrats -as well as some Republicans -grum­bled that the new White House boss looked a lot like the old one. 
Bush said of Bolten, "l-Ie's a man of candor and humor and directness, who's comfortable with responsibility and knows how to lead. No person is better prepared for this important position." 
Before being named budget direc­tor in 2003, Bolten was Card's deputy chief of staff for policy, a colleague of such senior aides as top political adviser Karl Rove and White House counselor Dan Bartlett. 
Alarmed by Bush's falling approval ratings and White House mistakes ­from the bungled Hurricane Katrina reaction to the ill-fated deal to allow an Arab company to manage U.S. ports -Republicans have been urg­ing the president to bring in new advisers with fresh energy. The GOP's concerns have been height­ened by anxiety over midterm con­gressional elections in November. Card, as chief of staff, became a tar­get for blame.

sharp lines can be drawn here, 
but we need to be conscious of 
that and use discretion in mak­

Graduate students also dis­
cussed a number of situations 
that they believed could poten­
tially pose problems if academic 
freedom is restricted at Notre 
Dame. 
Jenkins said artistic freedom 
should not be limited, saying 
while art is sometimes provoca­
tive, that is acceptable for a uni­
versity. 
While he said it would be 
appropriate to cover an obscene 
artwork if children were passing 
through the gallery, he also con­
firmed the artist's right to create 
the work and display it within 
the bounds of the University. 
Another student questioned whether a chemical engineering dissertation would be allowed if bone cell tissue from an aborted fetus was used. 
Jenkins said these types of sit­uations could be problematic. 
"I don't think we would do that if there were some fundamental values that institutionally if we don't affirm, we should cease calling ourselves Catholic," Jenkins said. "I don't know that particular case, but I do feel that there is a conflict, because Catholic view says that that's a human being, and you shouldn't destroy humans for research purposes." 
Jenkins could not stay to answer every question but thanked students for their inter­est and input. 
He also urged members of the Notre Dame community to con­tinue to share their views with him. 
"As [Irish author] James Joyce said about Catholics, 'Here comes everyone.' We want a diversity of views,'' Jenkins said. "I think we're a better university with wider views, with a more vibrant face. 
"If the Catholic institutional identity is going to be main­tained, someone once told me, it's going to be maintained at Notre Dame."

IN BRIEF 
Fed resumes rate-raising campaign 
WASiliNGTON-The Federal Reserve's new boss, Ben Bernanke, has the same concern as the old boss -that inllation could flare up. So interest rates are likely to move higher. 
Bernanke, at his first meeting as Fed chair­man. boosted borrowing costs to a live-year high and hinted that an additional interest rate increase could be in store. In doing so, Bernanke stuck to the script written by his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who had run the central bank for 18 1/2 years. 
"The more things change, the more they n~main the same," observed economist Joel NaroiT. president of Narofl' Economic Advisors. 
Wrapping up a two-day meeting Tuesday, Bernanke and his Fed colleagues struck a mostly positive tone, saying the economy "n~bounded strongly" in the January-to-March quarter from an end-of-year lull. But Fed poli­cymakers raised concerns about the potential for inflation to take off. 

Consumer confidence rises in March 
NEW YOHK -Americans' optimism in the economy rebounded in March, sending a widely followed barometer of consumer sentiment to a near four-year high, a private research group said Tuesday. 
The Conference Board said that its consumer index climbed 4.5 points to 107.2, the highest level since May 2002, when the reading was 
11 0.3. Analysts had expected a reading of 102. 
The latest measure was up from a revised I 02.7 in February, which was down 4.1 points from January and broke a three-month rebound from last year's Gulf hurricanes. 
'The improvement in consumers' assessment of present-day conditions is yet another sign that thn economy gained steam in early 2006," Lynn Franco. director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement. "Consumer expectations, while improved, remain subdued and still suggest a cooling in activity in the latter half of this year." 
The upbP.at report on consumer confidence is an encouraging sign for retailers, whose sales of spring fashions have been uneven amid cool tem­peratures. Economists closely track consumer confidence because consumer spending accounts for two thirds of all U.S. economic activity. 



Prosecution rests in Enron trial 
Defense teams to begin questioning; company's former chiefs Lay, Skilling to testify 
Associated Press 

IIOUSTON -Federal prosecutors rested their fraud and conspiracy case Tuesday against former Enron Corp. chiefs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling and dropped four counts against them to streamline an already complicated case. 
The defendants appeared undaunted after almost two dozen witnesses bolstP.red the government's claim that they committed crimes at the energy trading compa­ny before it sought bank­ruptcy protection in December 2001. 
"We're looking forward to getting on the stand and getting our case out there -the positive case," Lay told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Houston. 
Their defense teams will begin presenting their case in the premier trial to emerge from Enron's rub­ble on Monday, but other witnesses are likely to be overshadowed by the main event, when Lay and Skilling take the stand. 
"We are anxious to get our story told," said lead Skilling lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, his client at his side.

Kirk and Shoup both stressnd that administrators arc not using Facebook as a tool to uneovnr potontial DuLac violations. BnsLifn has not taken punitive measures basnd on the content of a studm1t's profile, Shoup said. 
''I'm not going to sit hero all ovnning to sno if pnoplo aro vio­lating poliey, but if a student has bonn aeeused already, I might tako a look and cheek out Face book," Shoup said. 

But administrators and rectors alikn are aware of Facebook and -in light of national news sto­ries about the dangers of the third party. site -becoming increasingly skeptical of it. 
Farley rector Sister Carrine Etheridge, who docs not have a Facebook account, said she is aware of Faeebook's pervasive­nnss on eollege campuses, thanks to a cautionary e-mail she recnivod from Viee President fi1r Student Af'fairs Fathor Mark Poorman earlinr this semester.

"The other thing I worry about

For Navy ROTC (NHOTC) mid­
shipmen, Facebook profiles are 
under further scrutiny by their 
superiors. 

"We have no set policy per se 
over here, but our midshipmen are by definition, representatives of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, and as officers and oflicers-in-training for the Navy and Marine Corps we wouldn't expeet them to put on Web sites anything their grandmother wouldn't be OK seeing," NROTC commander Jeffery Morris said. 
Morris said he has his own Faeebook account that he access­es about once every two months to "sec what everyone is doing." 
"It's purely random," he said. "lit's likel keeping your finger on a pulse. Some people might say it's a little more than that. I'm trying to see what's out there." 
Morris has meeived "numerous e-rnails" from Navy HOTC units at other universities around the nation, most of which advise Morris to "ehcck and sne what your midshipmen are posting" on Faeebook. 
lie said he's only had to speak with "one or two" midshipmen about th.cir profiles. 
If he finds a profile that has qunstionable photographs on it, he will call the midshipman into his office -but no punitive measures are taken. 
.''I'd have their advisor talk to them and say 'Hey, I happen to be surfing Faeebook today, I saw y'our site, are you sure your mother or grandmother would be OK with what you have on there?'" 
What Notre Dame students must remember, Shoup said, is that Facebook is not a private site. 
"Like ·I said, it's public domain," he said. "If someone puts something on Facebook or MySpace, I can look at it, their priests can look at it, parents Can look at it ... " 
Facebook at Saint Mary's 
At Saint Mary's, the use of Facebook by administrators is more pervasive. But as at Notre Dame, no punitive measures have been taken against students with questionable profiles -or not yet, at least. 
"Saint Mary's is just b1~ginning to explore ways to utilize Facebook to communicate with students and to determine if these sites should be considered when hiring for student leader­ship positions," director of Hesidenee Life Michelle Bussell said in an e-mail. 
Hussell said her main concern with Facebook is the threat it posns to student safnty. 
"My biggest concern is for the student's privacy and safety in post­being used." 
Zoeller said shn heard about Facebook earlier this year from one of her students who informed her about the site and the questionable photographs posted on it. As department chair, she said it's her responsi­bility to maintain her Faeebook membership.

QiJ College of Arts and Letters University of Notre Dame Invites Nominations for the Sheedy Award Each year, the Sheedy Award, nmned for a fonner dean of the college of Arts and Letters, honors one member of the Arts and Letters faculty for outstanding teaching.

information on their Facebook profiles because a user's page can usually only be accessed by a "Friend" or schoolmate. Additionally, all Facebook users must have valid ".edu" e­mail addresses. 
But students are not the only people with such addresses. University administrators, pro­fessors, police officers, coaches and alumni can also have col­lege e-mail accounts -and non-students have begun to use Facebook as an investiga­tive tool at campuses across the country. 
The issue has become so rampant that the interactive online encyclopedia Wikipedia now features the topic, "Facebook's use in investiga­tions." College administrators have begun to warn students to remove "inappropriate" material, as employers might search their profiles. Coaches worry the Web site might cause trouble for student-ath­letes bound by a stringent NCAA code of conduct. 
The Hanover Police Department in New Hampshire admittedly uses Facebook as a tool for tracking down suspect­ed student lawbreakers at Dartmouth College, according to a Feb. 3, 2006 article in the school.'s student newspaper, The Dartmouth. Police Chief Nicholas Giaccone said the department "maintain[s] a col­lection of Facebook [accounts]" -which were created after police bought a number of e­mail addresses from the College for that specific pur­pose. 
According to its Terms of Use, the Facebook is available for "personal, noncommercial use only." But unless users implement the necessary pri­vacy settings in their profiles, information published on Web site is public -a scary thought for students who wish to keep the Facebook world at a safe distance from the real world. 
Alcoholics not-so-anonymous 
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, an "overwhelming majority" of all college stu­dents -88 percent -have used alcohol. Not surprisingly, the pervasiveness of the habit is often chronicled in the Facebook profiles of underage and of-age drinkers alike. 
Students have recently faced disciplinary action for alcohol violations at some universities not for possession of a sub­stance or intoxication, but rather for incriminating Wall posts, group affiliations or published photos. 
Fifteen North Carolina State 

University students were 
charged with alcohol offenses 
last fall because of pictures 
posted on Facebook profiles, 
according to an Oct. 29, 2005 
article in the school's student 
newspaper, The Daily 
Technician. That November, 
four students at Northern 
Kentucky University -a dry 
campus -received $50 fines 
for posting photos that showed 
students drinking from a keg 
at a dorm party. 
Students' unseen acts of mis­

conduct have also been pun­
ished by campus administra­
tors. In October, the Berry 
College campus police broke 
up a freshman party on cam­
pus after a student jokingly 
sent the chief of police an invi­
tation through Facebook. . 
In November, Emory 

University officials slapped 
members of the Facebook 
with conduct code violations. A similar drinking group, "Woodruff=Wasted," was also investigated. In a Nov. 22, 2005 article in the Emory Wheel, the group's creator said members only discussed "hav­ing fun in Woodruff' and said no photos of students drinking were ever posted on Facebook. 
Other offenses 
In February, four Syracuse University students were forced to meet with a judicial committee and placed on disci­plinary probation for creating the Facebook group, "Clearly [instructor's first name] does­n't know what she's doing ever." Members personally denigrated the professor through a series of posts on the Web site. 
One student at Fisher College in Boston was expelled from the school in October after he used Facebook to criticize a campus security officer who "lov·es to antagonize students ... and needs to be eliminated." Dean Bonie Bacghi said in an Oct. 6, 2005 Boston Globe arti­cle that the _student "conspired to and damaged the reputa­tion" of the officer. 
Facebook criticisms of prominent individuals are not limited to the college sphere. The Secret Service questioned one University of Oklahoma student after he posted a Facebook comment about assassinating President George 
W. Bush in March 2005. 
In October, a Duquesne University student was ordered to write a 10-page essay about homosexuality in the Catholic Church after material on his Facebook user profile was deemed homophobic by uni­versity officials. On the other­hand, a gay student at John Brown University -a private, Christian college in Arkansas -was kicked out of school in January because he posted pictures on Facebook in which he was dressed in drag. 
Permeating nearly every facet of campus life, Facebook has also affected university athletics. In October 2005, Penn State University police officers used the Web site to trace the students who rushed the field after the Nittany Lions defeated Ohio State in an Oct. 8 game. Two members of the Facebook group "I Rushed the Field After the OSU Game (And Lived!)" were charged with criminal trespassing. 
Athletes themselves -not just their overzealous fans ­are also facing severe conse­quences because of Facebook. Athletics officials at Florida State University and the University of Kentucky recently admonished athletes against posting any questionable mate­rial on the Web site. L~yola University of Chicago forbids student-athletes to have Facebook accounts, according to a March 8, 2006 USA Today article. 
In May 2005, two Louisiana State University swimmers were kicked off the team after athletics administrators dis­covered they belonged to a Facebook group which specifi­cally targeted and bashed team coaches. 
"Facebook is dangerous right now," one swimmer told USA Today in the March article. "You're supposed to have fun with this Facebook thing, but you need to be careful."

Conservative statesman remembered for role in ending the Cold War, involvement in 'arms-for-hostages' controversy

In a Feb. 10, 1986, interview with The Washington Post, Hnagan defended his defense secretary. "That's the same priee that TWA and Delta and United pay. It is a molded cover for the entirn toilet system. And, yes, it does cost about that mueh."

But his work also led to a trouble -federal felony charges stemming from his alleged role in the sale of' weapons to Iran to finance secret, illegal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. 
The "arms-for-hostages" alTair poisoned the closing years of' Reagan's administration and permanently stained the reputa­tions of the insiders involved. 
In one of' the first President Bush's final ollieial acts after his 1992 loss to Bill Clinton, he granted Christmas Eve pardons to Weinberger and live others accused in the af1'air. Bush was Heagan's viee president. 
Weinberger, 75 at the time, had been scheduled to stand trial in less than two weeks on charges that he concealed thou­sands of pages of his handwrit­ten notes from congressional investigators and prosecutors.

In 1989, Weinberger, a self­described "frustrated newspa­perman" -he was president of the Harvard Crimson -joined Forbes to become the maga­zine's fourth publisher. In 1993 he was named chairman of Forbes Ine. 
Weinberger occasionally spoke out on current affairs in recent years. In 1996, he criticized then-Defense Secretary William

"Peace alone is not enough. Peace can even mean slavery sometimes. Peace and freedom is what we have to have," Weinberger said. 
In 1983, he argued that a l'orce of U.S. Marines stationed at Beirut's airport was too small and lightly armed, calling them a "disaster waiting to happen." On Oct. 22, 1983, 241 Marines and sailors were killed in attacks on the barracks. 

State trooper gets life 


Indiana officer killed his wife, two children 
Associated Press 

BOONVILLE, Ind. -A judge on Tuesday sentenced a for­mer Indiana state trooper to life in prison for the murders of his wife and two young chil­dren. 
Jurors earlier this month convicted David Camm of three eounts of murder for the September 2000 slayings of Kimberly Camm, 35, and seven-year-old Bradley and five-year-old Jill. 
At the same time Cam m's trial was under way, another jury across the state was hear­ing testimony that led them to convict an ex-convict in the same killings. 
Prosecutors said the two men conspired to carry out the shootings. 
"This jury should have heard the whole story of Charles Boney as the killer of my fami­ly," Camm said tearfully in court Tuesday. "I do not under­stand this, and I never will." 
Proseeutor Keith Henderson, who tried both men, said he did not believe Camm 's emo­tional address. 
"Justice has been done here," he said. "This case is­closed." 
Beeause of evidence restric­tions, jurors in Camm 's trial were not told that Boney, 36, was convieted in January. 
Camm was first convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 195 years in prison, but the state appeals eourt overturned the verdict, ruling that testimony about Camm 's extramarital affairs had unfairly biased jurors. 
The prosecution's ease cen­tered on tiny bloodstains found on a T-shirt he wore the night of killings. Crime scene experts testified those stains placed him within feet of his daughter when she was shot while strapped into a seat of Kimberly Camm 's SUV. 
Defense attorneys argued that the stains got on Camm's shirt when he found the bod­ies. They called witnesses who said Camm was playing bas­ketball that night, but prosecu­tors contended Camm left the game, killed his family, then returned. l-Ie reported the deaths when he returned home. 
Boney was charged with eon­spiring with Camm, convieted on three counts of murder and sentenced to 225 years in prison. lie was linked to the case last year by DNA evidence on a prison sweat shirt bearing his nickname, "Backbone," and a palm print at the crime scene. 
Boney's eonviction and pros­eeutors' allegations that Camm molested his daughter ­something he was not charged with -will be central to an appeal Camm's attorneys have said they intend to file.

CHINA 
Pope 111ay visit China for maiden Vatican trip 
Associated Press 
HONG KONG Pope Benedict XVI told a delegation from Hong Kong he will visit China in what would be an extraordinary papal visit to the communist nation, but he said the trip's timing depends on "God's wish," media reports said Tuesday. 
One of the Vatican's goals is to restart official relations with China, which forced its Roman Catholics to cut ties with the Holy See in 1951 after the offi­cially atheist Communists took power. People can worship only in government-controlled churches. 
But millions of Chinese belong to unofficial congregations loyal to Rome. They say they are fre­quently harassed, fined and sometimes sent to labor camps by authorities. 
Pope John Paul II, the most­traveled pontiff in history, was unable to visit China during his 26-year papacy. Pope Paul VI made a three-hour stopover in Hong Kong in 1970 when it was a British colony. 
No pope has ever visited mainland China. 
The Hong Kong delegation was in Rome for ceremonies installing 15 new cardinals, including Hong Kong Bishop Joseph Zen. 
Zen, an outspoken champion of religious freedom in China, said he believed the pope would visit Hong Kong first if he made a China trip. 
"Hong Kong is part of China and perhaps he should come here as a first step," Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted Zen as saying. 
The delegation included Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who told the pope Monday, "Please come to China to bring us love and democracy," Lai's Apple Daily newspaper report­ed in a front-page story. 
The pope responded, "I will come," the newspaper report­ed.

Misbehaved ones 
In the final stretch of my columnist career here at Notre Dame, I would like to take the opportunity for the second time to uplift some of the sen­ior members of our community who have impacted this campus and taught me more of what it means to be a stu­dent ol' Our Lady's University. Considering that we find ourselves in tlw last week of Women's history month and in the prnsence of Laurel Thatelwr Ulrich, historian (as the best discipline in my opinion) and the eoi1wr of the phrase, "Well-behaved women sel­dom make history," I will be f()(~using on great womon who have made his­tory lwrn and surely will in thnir earner of life. 
Jackie Clark is one of the first peo­ple I met at Notre Dame and I have had the real privilege to watch her develop and make trouble during her tenure. Second only to maybe Madonna in reinventing her look, Clark to me is a masterful risk taker. Before really knowing the result, she takes action. This in itself is rare, yet Clark couples her courage with social concern. 
In her legacy stands the most inter­esting coat collection dorm competi­tion, a campus wide sleep out for homelessness, food drop program for social services and a half marathon for charity. Clark has an imagination for making social action accessible for college students. ller work in social justice has also been stellar. As a leader in the Campus Labor Action Project, she speaks with a moral authority of the connection between our faith commitments and society's problems.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Kaity Hedfield is quite rightly one of our campus's most competent and energetic leaders. At Notre Dame, some issues Will drag you through the ringer. ller efforts in standing up against violence against women have been inspiring. I appreciate Hedfield's persistence in leading stu­dent groups on these issues even until her senior year. ller investment in challenging us on these issues is beyond popularity or filling a role. Hedfield is disgraced by situations in which people cannot tell their stories of victimization nor seek adequate lwlp and this angnr fuels her action. I foresne that the changes the dia­logue she has facilitated will makn this campus better for all its daugh­ters and sons. 
Hhea Boyd gets most of my admira­tion for taking up an issue close to my heart. As many African Ameriean students could testify to, when I arrived here I know that fitting in was not a possibility. Boyd has rea­soned through a way to not only uplift thn images and stories of minority students but also to invite majority students to enter conversa­tion about cultures different from their own. Her push to create cultur­al competency is a tool that fits our role as an academic institution. We should value the amount of love, curiosity and care that Notre Dame students have for people as much as we do for books and intangible knowledge. Boyd realizes the poten­tial of a university education to pre­pare people for life in diverse com­munities, not only a career. 
Despite her double major, I cannot skip shining a light on Jess Collado. During her time here, she has really engaged the South Bend community, built relationships and done what most here in power fail to do -lis­ten. Instead of presuming, she has taken the time to Iiston to community members on what concerns them and what they would like to take action on. 
I have been privilegnd to go with Collado to community mnasures on heating deposits and community organizing against poverty. Also, hnr work hero on through the Center for Social Concerns on youth and vio­lence issuns has bem1 good to sec. Collado shows us what our nxe1~llent training and concern for soda! issues could do in the community. 
I could not leave this column with­out mentioning Julia Fitzpatrick. llnr parking practices aside, I havn really benefited from seeing how she inte­grates praynr with social rdlection. Whether it was planning a social jus­tice rally, going to thn School of the Americas, talking about lwr experi­ence in Egypt or canvassing for votes on Nov. 2, 2004, I havn bnnn glad to work with Fitzpatrick beeausn of tlw confidence and earn slw brings to such work. In her actions, one can sense that something d11npnr than idnas drivns her. I suspnet it is lwr faith and comm)tment to human dig­nity. I am also refreshed by hnr study of Arabie and plans to work on some­thing rnlated to the Middle East­engaging the other for peace and understanding. 
Women make great leaders, teach­ers and comrades. We are blessed here to have these and many more Notre Dame women who misbehave, take the lead and change our world. I am honored ·to have worked with these students and even more so to receive my degree in tlwir company.

The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those r~f The Observer. 
Spirit of inclusion appreciated 
Sometime recently, I was walking through my dorm and came across a rather large rainbow flag inscribed with the words "Spirit of Inclusion" hanging in my dorm lobby. My first reaction was shock. Never ·in a million years did I expect to see a rainbow flag decorating a dorm on this campus (excluding students' private rooms). My second was deep gratitude. 
I am a senior and have been out on this campus for a little over three years now, and have been involved with the Standing Committee for Gay and Lesbian Student Nends since the beginning of my sophomore year. Needless to say, I have seen a lot over the past four years revolving around GLBT issues. 
Some of what I have seen has been good, and some of it has made me feel incredibly unwelcome here. What I felt most of all, however, was invisible. So many students see GLBT issues as something that is debated .over lunch or in a elass, but for me, it involves an important part of who I am. I struggle daily with the assumption of hetero­sexuality that the majority of people on this campus hold regarding the people around them. 
To see a rainbow flag up in my residence hall told me, in the most simple manner I can think of, that GLBT stu­dents are embraced and recognized as part of the Notre Dame community and that discrimination and intolerance 
_ arc not welcome in our halls. For that, I am incredibly grateful. I recently found out that these flags were offered to all the hall rectors but that only a handful agrned to display them. For those who did, I would like to say thank you. For those who have not, I would like to ask you to n~con­sider. It could make all the difference in the world to a GLBT student living in your hall to see this symbol of acceptance. I can only imagine, if the flag had such a strong impact on someone like myself who has come to terms with my sexuality, what kind of impact it may have on the students hnre who are still struggling.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Injustice in the fields of Florida 
The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) is a community-based worker organization composed mainly of immigrants with low-wage jobs in the tomato fields of Florida. The CIW focuses its efforts towards achieving respectable working conditions and living wages for these traditionally oppressed people in the region, as well as the right to be directly involved in decisions that affect their lives. 
In order to achieve these goals, the CIW set their sights high and aimed for the corporations that pur­chased tomatoes from the fields they worked in. In 2001 the CIW announced a nationwide boycott of Taco Bell, whose parent company Yum Brands was found to be one of the largest buyers of their toma­toes. Four years later, in March of 2005, Taco Bell agreed to meet all the demands of the CIW. This huge step, however, applies to less than one percent of the tomatoes picked in Florida. 
Having won the battle against Taco Bell, the CIW is currently pressuring another fast-food giant, McDonald's, to take responsibility for the workers' rights of those in their supply chain. In the fall of last year, the CIW and the Student Farmworker Alliance (SFA) sent letters and postcards to McDonald's asking for compliance to their demands. 
McDonald's response was to sidestep the issue by supporting a new bogus organization called Socially Accountable Farm Employers (SAFE). The credibili­ty of SAFE as an organization to "audit and certify fair, lawful farm labor practices in the agriculture industry" is called into question when looking at their corporate ties, in particular to McDonald's. 
In comparing McDonald's to SAFE, many similari­ties appear between the two. Handling media work for SAFE is CBR Public Relations, a company who lists McDonald's as one of its major clients and cites "activist response management" as one of its areas of expertise. Also, to verify their certification, SAFE hired the auditing company lntertek, again employed by McDonald's. In addition, out of all the businesses that buy tomatoes from Florida, McDonald's is the only one which publicly supports SAFE. 
Besides the possibility of McDonald's aiding in the creation of SAFE, we also must take under consider­ation who is accountable for creating this organiza­tion. Ironically, it is run by the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (comprised of the same farm employers who SAFE targets) and the Redlands Christian Migrant Association (their favorite chari­ty). Clearly SAFE may not be quite as secure for the workers as its name implies. 
William E. Gladstone once said, "Justice delayed is justice denied." The CIW has communicated with McDonald's through negotiation, but no change has been made. Seemingly inspired by Gladstone, the CIW is now turning to more direct action to fight for the rights that every human being deserves. 
Starting this past Sun., March 26, the CIW launched The Real Rights Tour, designed to travel the country educating students, among other allies, on the situation in Florida. Included in its destina­tions is our own University of Notre Dame. This Thurs., March 30, from 12-1:45 p.m. in the Carey Auditorium of the I-lesburgh Library, the CIW will be presenting their experiences in the tomato fields and educating on the McDonald's Campaign. They will then continue on, concluding their tour with a rally in Chicago, Illinois this coming Sat., April 1, in which some Notre Dame students will be participat­ing. 
Someone once said, "If you educate people, they will come down on the side of justice." As members of the Notre Dame family, we have a great opportu­nity here to educate ourselves on what we can do in the fight for justice.

Pirate mascots offensive too 
I would like to voice my opinion on the ongoing debate that has raged amongst differ­ent factions at Our Lady's University regard­ing the name of our sporting teams. I tend to agree with Paul Richards, Sinead Howley, et. al in the attack on our mascot. This issue is very important to me, for being a sports fan I, too, am under constant assault of an unfortu­nate depiction of my people's history. My father, you see, was a "pirate." 
Buccaneering has a long and rich history in the Bochnowski family. The ugly word "pirate," however, harkens back to days when men with scurvy leaped from boat to boat, pil­laging and generally raising a ruckus. While there certainly is swashbuckling involved in the life of a buccaneer, this archaic word is clearly associated with the negative aspects of the occupation. 
Let me tell you, every day on the playground was terrible on the psyche of a young boy. "Let's see your parrot!" some kids would say. "Where's your eyepatch?" others would sing. 
Indeed in this day and age, pirates are forced into the main profession of their ilk ­the service industry. Unfortunately, this indus­try is almost completely reliant on tourists, mostly Americans, who have no idea what real pirates are like. Therefore pirate movies and rides perpetuate an image of the drunk­en, makeup-wearing, pillaging sort. While there is drinking, there is very limited pillag­ing. And there is absolutely no makeup. 
Myles Brand recently stated that, "The NCAA objects to institutions using raciaVeth­nic/national origin references .in their inter­collegiate athletics programs." If this is true, we must take it one step further. We must get rid of every mascot that can possibly offend anyone. 
I personally find Seton Hall's mascot offen­sive. But we cannot possibly stop there. My friend Bobby's father works at a ranch ­change Oklahoma State's mascot! My friend Megan's second cousin was mauled by a mountain lion -I say for her sake change Penn State's mascot. 
Stop the madness. We wouldn't want to offend anyone.

'Fighting Irish' moniker testament to character, not slur 
Paul L. Richards letter on March 22 has gotten our Irish up, so to speak, by suggesting that the "Fighting Irish" nick­name is offensive. As proud Irish-American Catholics and proud sons of Our Lady, we believe that the term "Fighting Irish" has become an indication of Notre Dame's pride in and respect for her heritage, rather than a mere epithet. 
We agree with Richards that the nickname "Fighting Irish" originally arose as a slur directed against Irish­Americans in general and the largely Irish-American stu­dent body of the University of Notre Dame in particular. We do not deny that the term has its roots in anti-Catholic and anti-Irish prejudice of the worst kind. However, we contend that the term "Fighting Irish" has taken on a drastically dif­ferent meaning in the decades since it was coined. 
Since it became the official Notre Dame nickname in 1927 (at the behest of then-University President Rev. Matthew Walsh, C.S.C., an Irish-American), the term "Fighting Irish" has come to be associated with a legendary spirit of tenacity and persistence towards unprecedented athletic excellence. The victories of the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, especially in football, have long been a point of pride for working-class Irish-Americans. Like our athletic teams, Irish-Americans as an ethnicity have worked hard and forged success for them­selves, often in the face oflong odds and bigoted abuse. The legendary subway ah.imni-including our own grandfa­thers-were drawn to Notre Dame because, under the banner of the "Fighting Irish," it exemplified the ability of the underdog to succeed through determination and com­mitment to excellence. 
We believe that the "Fighting Irish" nickname is a vital part of Notre Dame's heritage. Rather than perpetuating a stereotype or slurring an ethnicity, the nickname repre­sents the Notre Dame character of triumph against all odds. We are proud to be known as the Fighting Irish, and hope it ever remains as an emblem of Notre Dame's fight-. ing spirit.

Noted critically as Lee's first film without a primarily blaek cast, "Summer of Sam" is more problematic because of its unfocused sprawl.

The atmosphere of paranoia and fear is suitably oppressive, but becomes wearing as tho film surpasses the two-hour mark.

The littlest Tar Heel, making every big play down the stretch, put top-seeded North Carolina in its first Final Four since winning the 1994 national championship with a 75-63 win over Tennessee in the Cleveland Regional on Tuesday night. 
After complaining that their road to Boston was way too tough, the Tar Heels are packing their bags for another road trip.

Danica Patrick and crew opt out of Toyota 300 
After tragic death of rookie team member Paul Dana, the Rahal Letterman Racing Team withdraws from big race 
Associated Press 
IIOMESTEAD, Fla. -Danica 
Patrick said Tuesday the Rahal 
Letterman Racing team made 
the right decision in keeping 
both her and teammate Buddy 
Hice out of Sunday's season­
opening race at Homestead­
Miami Speedway after the 
death of rookie Paul Dana. 
"I don't think you can ever 
question the decision that your 
boss makes," she said during a 
break in testing on Homestead's 
road course. 
Heferring to team co-ownf)r Bobby Hahal. she added, "II' he would have said 'race' or 'don't ra1:e,' that's what I would have done. I race for him. I think he did a very, very good thing. This is life. We drive race cars, and it's what we love, and it's our job, but we don't walk out there a eouple minutes afterward and say, 'I've forgotten already.' 
"I don't think that anybody can uitique the faet that he said 'don't race.' lhit outside people could have if he would have had us go out there and 
raen." 
Patrick and Hice both plan to race on Sunday at St. Petersburg in the second IHL lndyCar Series race of the sea­son. 
Dana, a 32-year-old rookie, joined the team this season and was schmluled to make his first start of Hahal Letterman last Sunday. Instead, he was pro­nounced dead two hours after crashing into the nearly stopped car of Ed Carpenter, who had hit the wall several seconds earlier. 
Carpenter spent a night in the hospital, but was released Monday, suffering from a bruised lung. 
Patrick, last year's rookie phenom who led and finished fourth in the Indianapolis 500, said she didn't know Dana very well. 
"I tend to keep a little bit to myself," she said. "I don't talk to very many people. I pretty much go from my motorcoach to my truck and to the track. I really didn't get to know him very well. 
"I told him to move over a couple of times when he was sitting in my seat right next to my engineer," she said, smiling. "But he was a very nice guy. And, gosh, did he want it." 
Patriek pointed out that Dana got his ride with Hahal by get­ting Team Ethanol to sponsor his No. 17 race car. 
"Either you get a free ride or you bring a sponsor along," she said. "You can write your own checks, and you write your own ticket. He did the hardest thing; he got a sponsor to stand behind and give him a ride. 
"They said, 'All right, Paul Dana, we believe in you.' I remember at the Christmas party, and I was sitting in a meeting with the team and I thought, 'What's going on here, is he going to drive for the team? I was surprised, but he made it happen. Good for him. And you know what, he was proving he was driving the thing. I was a little scared because he was keeping up with us. I think he did better than I expected." 
Hice, the 2004 Indy 500 win­ner, remembered Dana as a driver with a lot of heart. 

"That guy put everything he had into becoming a race car driver," Rice said Tuesday. "Obviously he got a little bit of later start than some of us; that's just the way of the course. I think he had a lot of drive, he had a lot of heart and he put everything he had into becoming a race car driver. 
"Obviously, it was short but he got to'do what he wanted to do and he made it to the top level.'' 
Patrick said race car drivers understand that it is their job to race, even under difficult cir­cumstances. She said there was no hesitation about getting back in the cockpit this week. 
"Things are a lot more somber, and rightfully so," she said. "Somebody died. It sounds a little bit cold, but it is the job. We do have to keep racing, but we will give him the best trib­ute and the best thoughts and prayers that we can."

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana will hire Kelvin Sampson as its next basketball coach, taking him from an Oklahoma team under the cloud of a recruiting investi­gation to lead one of the most prestigious programs in the country. 
Sampson broke the news to his Sooner team Tuesday, the same day Indiana play­ers were informed, one of the Hoosier players' relatives told The Associated Press. 
Details of the deal were being worked out Tuesday, said a person close to the talks who requested anonymity because negotia­tions were ongoing. No news conference was scheduled. 
"I was caught by surprise a little bit," said Taylor Griffin, a freshman forward for the Sooners. "He made the deci­sion. I guess it's better for the program. I guess it's better for him." 
The 50-year-old Sampson, AP's Coach of the Year in 1995, will replace Mike Davis, who announced last month he was resigning. Davis went 115-79 in six sea­sons as head coach, was the first Indiana coach to win 20 games in each of his first thr.ee seasons and led the Hoosiers to the national championship game in 2002, two seasons after Bob Knight was fired. 
The Hoosiers were 19-12 
IN BRIEF 
NASCAR's Gordon fined for track-side altercation 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Jeff Gordon has always been a model of good behavior off the track, the rare driv­er able to keep his emotions in check. 
That changed when he angrily shoved Matt Kenseth following the race at Bristol Motorspeedway, an action that drew a $10,000 fine from NASCAR on Tuesday. It's the first time in Gordon's 14-year career that he's been penalized for his conduct. 
Don't expect Gordon, who was placed on probation until Aug. 30, to turn into another Tony Stewart or Kurt Busch. But the image-conscious driver is committed to letting loose the emotion he's kept bottled up over the years. 
"For many, many years I've been so reserved from controversy," he said. "I was just so concerned with 'What was this person going to think?' and 'What was that person going to think?' and I was more caught up in this year and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Gonzaga. 
Stephanie Gilbert, who help raised nephew A.J. Ratliff in Indianapolis, said the Hoosiers' sophomore guard called her Tuesday to discuss the change, first reported by ESPN. Gilbert also said it was likely Ratliff would stay at Indiana. 
"He's looking forward to meeting him and getting to know him," Gilbert said. "He seems pretty happy." 
Ratliff declined to com­ment and denied that a team meeting was held. Two other key Indiana players had said after Davis resigned that they were apt to transfer: D.J. White, the 2005 Big Ten freshman of the year, and Robert Vaden. 

Gilbert said Sampson's hir­ing could change their minds. 
"Once they meet with him, they'll probably need to see," Gilbert said. "I think, from the looks of it, they have a pretty good coach on their hands." 
Oklahoma officials declined to comment Tuesday. Telephone mes­sages left for Indiana athletic director Rick Greenspan and spokesman Pete Rhoda were not immediately returned. 
Sampson leaves Oklahoma behind amid an inv~stigation for possible recruiting viola­tions. 
that than I was in being true to 
myself. 

"What you see today is a more 
truer Jeff Gordon and who I really 
am. I'm not a robot. I have a person­
ality and I have emotions and I have 
a humorous side to me and an angry 
side to me." 

Outfielder Grissom calls it a ·Career after 17 seasons 
MESA, Ariz. -Marquis Grissom 
announced his retirement Tuesday 
after a 17 -year major league career. 
The 38-year-old outfielder signed a 
minor league contract with the 
Chicago Cubs in January and had 
hoped to make the team as a backup. 
But he batted just .200 in 17 spring 
training games. 
Grissom leaves as one of seven 
players with 2,000 hits, 200 home 
runs and 400 stolen bases, joining 
Craig Biggio, Roberto Alomar, Barry 
Bonds, Rickey Henderson, Paul 
Molitor and Joe Morgan. 
Grissom finished with 429 stolen bases, including a career-high 78 in 1992. He was a two-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner during a career that saw him play in the majors with six teams. 
''I'm at peace with myself. I'm happy," Grissom said. "1 feel like the whole world has been lifted off my shoulders." Indiana hig_hway will not be 
named for'Reggte Miller 
CARMEL, Ind. -A stretch of U.S. 31 won't be named for retired Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller after all. 
That's because the highway section just north of Indianapolis that was to be designated for Miller by the Indiana Department of Transportation has spent the past 12 years as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway. 
"Once we were made aware of it and spoke with the veterans and that sort of thing, we decided to not pur­sue that plan," highway department spokesman Gary Abell said Tuesday.

Spurs beat Clippers to clai111 conference lead 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs vivid­ly remembered what Elton Brand did against them three weeks ago. 
They were not about to let him repeat it. 
Duncan had 20 points and 13 rebounds, and did a lot of the heavy work in containing Brand on the other end of the floor Tuesday night in leading the ~purs to a 98-87 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. 
"Elton is having such a great season, he's been an MVP candi­date all year long, and we felt we should start there because he hurt us so bad last time," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "It worked out for us this time." 
Brand led the Clippers with 20 points and 10 rebounds, but he shot only 3-of-11 and scored 11 points after the first period. He had 30 points and nine rebounds March 7 in a 98-85 victory over the Spurs at Staples Center. 
"It was a huge key," Duncan said of containing Brand. "He really hurt us last time. We decided to come after him and make them change their game a little bit." 
Michael Finley also scored 20 points, Bruce Bowen had 16, Brent Barry scored 11 and Manu Ginobili had eight points and nine assists for the Spurs (55­16), who moved into first place in the Western Conference, one those guys are knocking shots down and making plays. That team is deep enough that it's OK. 
"If you miss Tim Duncan, then there's a difference. But you can make up Tony's 20 (points). And Finley's a starter anywhere else." 
Chris Kaman added 18 points and eight rebounds and Corey Maggette had 16 points, 11 rebounds and six assists for the Clippers (41-29), who lost for just the fourth time in 12 games and need only one victory to clinch their first winning season in 15 yeas. 
Sam Cassell was held to eight points and seven assists. 
"It was a little disappointing," Brand said of the Clippers' per­formance. "We built some confi­dence playing against this team. We felt like we should have won up at their place and lost in over­time, then we beat them pretty handily here, and with their full complement _ Tony Parker, Ginobili, Duncan, everybody. 
"But they played pretty well tonight. They made shots and we didn't. We didn't take it onto the court, and they got easy layups and easy shots." 
The Spurs shot 36-of-73 (49 percent) including 10-of-25 from 3-point range, while the Clippers went 28-of-74 (38 percent) including 1-of-1 0 from beyond the arc.

Cubs place Prior and Wood on disabled list 
Associated Press 
Mark Prior and Knrry Wood wont on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday along with the hopes of many Chicago Cubs fans. 
Neither move came as a sur­prise, as both have been rehab­bing from injuries. 
"We knew neither one of them would be ready for open­ing day," Cubs general manag­er Jim llondry said. "Mark has been throwing again and has had no discomfort. Woody has been very, very good." 
Prior, who has not pitched in a spring training game, has a strained muscle in the right shoulder. Wood had arthro­scopic surgery on his right knen this month to repair a minor cartilage tear. lie began throwing shortly after that. He threw 60 pitches from a bullpen mound earlier this week. 
Also at Cubs' camp in Mesa, Ariz., Marquis Grissom announced his retirement after a 17 -year major league eareer. 

The 38-year-old outfielder signed a minor league contract in January and had hoped to make the team as a backup. But he batted just .200 in 17 spring training games. 
"It's been a pretty fun ride along the way," Grissom said. "I came into spring training to this organization to really see if I could go out and play baseball again for another year. And I got that opportunity from the Cubs. It didn't work out. Over a period of the last two, three weeks, I've been going in and out, strength-wise, body-wise emotionally, whether I wanted to do it, could I do it." 
Also, Kansas City claimed infielder Tony Graffanino off waivers from Boston, returning him to the team that traded him to the Red Sox eight months ago.

over Anastasia Kugakolova. Other players contributing to the team's depth are Taka Bertrand and Amanda Taylor. Bertrand defeated Martina Banikova 6-1, 6-3 at No. 2. Taylor followed the win with a 3-6, 7-6 (5), 1-0 (13) victory over Renee Joseph. 
However, the Irish are trying not to focus on winning streaks or rankings. 
"We have taken every match one at a time this season and not been caught up in anyone's rankings,'' freshman Kelcy Tefft said. "Vanderbilt definite­ly has a great team, so we are hoping we play our best ten­nis." 
The Irish have not lost a doubles point this entire sea­son, and they enter the match with two ranked doubles teams. 
The No. 3 pairing of Catrina and Christian Thompson leads Notre Dame in doubles, fol­lowed by the No. 29 twosome of Tell't and sophomore Brook Buck. 

"We have had an awesome year in doubles and are hoping we dnn't drop the point this whole season,'" Catrina Thompson said. "If one team has an off day, we have two others that give our opponents dilTicult doubles matches." 
In singles, No. 30 Catrina Thompson leads the team at No. 1 and holds an 11-3 record in duals matches this season. She is followed by No. 74 Christian Thompson, who had dilTiculties dosing out her last match against Iowa's Hillary Mintz. 
Following its match against Vanderbilt, Notre Dame will return home to play Eastern Michigan on Friday. 
"It will bn nice being able to play at home again after being on the road during spring break and facing tough home crowds at schools likn Texas A&M," Tefft said. "So we will definitely take advantage lol' that] when we face Eastern Michigan."

house." 
Notre Dame hopes its return to the Dome will help it pre­pare mentally for a team with a record that may conceal its talent. 
"They're a very good team," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "They haven't gotten a lot of wins thus far, but they haven't not been in any games this year. We've seen video of their games this year, and they've played very good games better." 
Corrigan is confident his team can win at the highest level if it plays a mistake.-free game and execute the bare fundamentals of lacrosse from start to finish. 
"I don't think we need to do anything differently," Corrigan said. "We need to do things consistently. That's been our biggest challenge this year. We haven't continued to exe­cute for 60 minutes the way we need to. We haven't put together the 60 minutes on both sides of the ball." 
Driscoll believes the Irish

Maryland­Baltimore County and last Saturday to Ohio State. They also lost to No. 7 Massachusetts 13-9 in a game in which they trailed by two midway through the fourth quarter. 
"This is a statement game for us, coming off a bad loss, to come back and get back on our feet," Driscoll said. "We've seen the type of offense they run all year in practice. We have to play a full game and play with the potential I know our team has, and we can run with any­one." 
If Notre Dame's effort at practice Monday is indicative of how the team will respond in today's game, Corrigan expects the Irish to be fully recovered from Saturday's loss. 
"[The) guys came out and had a great practice [Monday]." Corrigan said. "They came out and compet­ed. That's all you can ask ­that's how you get better. We have to take what we can learn from the last game and expect to come out and play 
cution." 
Though Corrigan said soph­omore midfielder Mike Podgajny will not be ready to play a full game, he will see action as he continues to recover from mononucleosis. 
The Irish will also be with­out sophomore face-off spe­cialist Taylor Clagett, who is recovering from a shoulder injury. 
Clagett's absence Saturday critically hurt the Irish, as they lost 16 of the game's 22 face-offs and struggled to gain possession of the ball all day, managing just five goals. 
Senior backup Steve Panos will make his third straight start at face-off for the Irish. After winning 9-12 against Bellarmine, Panos managed 2-15 against Hofstra, as he split time with sophomore Sean Dougherty. 
"We'll continue to look for answers there," Corrigan said. "Steve has had one real good game and one where he struggled. We'll start with Steve and go from there."

Irish prepared for hotne opener 
Notre Dame to play in first game at Ivy Field 24 games into season 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
After starting the season with 23 consecutive road games, the Irish (13-1 0) finally take the field at Notre Dame, playing their home opener against Bowling Green (17 -8) today at 5 p.m. 
The Irish are coming off arguably their best day of the season so far, having swept a doubleheader against Western Michigan last weekend. Not only did Notre Dame win both games, but won both in very dif­ferent, yet equally dramatic fashions. The combined no-hit­ter thrown by Heather Booth and Kenya Fuemmeler in the first game and ·the eight-inning, 2-1 victory in game two showed Notre Dame's ability to win tough games. 
Notre Dame head coach Deanna Gumpf hopes to take this weekend's game and use it as motivation for her team against Bowling Green. 
"I hope we can use the momentum from the weekend, but three days is a long time for softball," Gumpf said. 
Bowling Green has had an impressive start so far this year, having already beaten No. 13 Washington earlier in the sea­son. Going into Tuesday night's matchup with defending cham­pion Michigan, Bowling Green has a seven-game win streak, including five shutouts. 
Gumpf recognized the need for her team to be at their absolute best in this game, play­ing against one of the strongest Bowling Green teams in recent memory. 
Although they have been strong defensively all season, the Irish will look to wake up their bats, as Notre Dame bat­ters reached base safely only seven times in eight innings against Western Michigan. 
The Falcons have a lineup that could challenge the Irish pitch­ing staff. Bowling Green has three starting players hitting over .300 for the year, the most fearsome of whom is third base­man Gina Rango, the Bowling Green cleanup hitter currently batting .392 with a .662 slug­ging percentage. 
Senior Heather Booth and freshman Brittney Bargar will most likely split the game against this potent lineup. While Booth has a 6-7 record, she owns a 1.70 ERA and a 1.23 WHIP (walks and hits per innings pitched). Bargar has been a very consistent pitcher this year, winning seven of her first ten starts in her Irish career. 

The Irish are 14-3 all-time in season home openers, and have beaten Bowling Green in six of their last seven meetings. More importantly, the Irish know they thrive on intensity -something that has propelled them to every one of their victories so far this year. 
"They [the team]. knows they need to keep their intensity high because when we don't play with intensity, we don't win," Gumpfsaid.

Sophomore David Gruener started the game on the mound for the Irish, before being relieved after three innings of one hit, one walk, three-strikeout work.

terfielder Alex Nettey collect­
ed his 1 OOth career hit and 
senior left fielder Matt 
Bransfield sent home his 
1OOth career RBI in the seven­
run deluge. 

Shortstop Greg Lopez laid down a bunt with two men on base to score Nettey from third for the 2-0 advantage to open the floodgates. After a Cody Rizzo 11y out, third base­man Brett Lilley singled in Dury -who had reached base on a double down the right field line -on a line shot to right for the 3-0 lead. 
A Danny Dressman RBI sin­gle was followed immediately with a Jeremy Barnes HBI double to left centerfield to put the Irish up 5-0. Bransfield plated a run with a sacrifice 11y and was followed by consecutive HBI singles by Hoss Brezovsky and Nettey to round out the inning at 8-0. Nettey was 2-for-4 with two HBis and one run on the game. 
"It was good to see some guys come through with some real clutch hitting, and I think we showed that we are capa­ble of being a good offensive team," Mainieri said of the lively bats. "When everybody is clicking and everybody is swinging the bats the way that they can, we can· back this up now with tomorrow's game and do it through the week." 
The Irish opened the first inning with a run off a Bransfield single to right cen­terfield and Barnes on second. It was the sixth consecutive game in which the Irish have scored a first-inning run. 
frame this season. 
"In all honesty, with us not being a home run-hitting team by scoring early in the game and taking the lead, it allows us to use a squeeze bunt early there in the game -we hit and ran a couple of times," Mainieri said. "We have to try to manufacture some runs because we don't have an enormous amount of power in our lineup." 
Notre Dame scored again in the sixth inning on a single to centerfield by Eddie Smith, who filled in at second base for Brezovsky. 
A three-run eighth on Crusader sophomore hurler Aaron Hank rounded out the Irish tally. Smith and Nettey took consecutive walks a Dury was hit by a pitch -all with the bases loaded -sending three runners home for the 12-0 final. Freshman Eddie Mendiola and sophomore Chris Soriano were sent home by the walks after reaching base on back-to-back line drive singles, and Bransfield was walked home after he reached his base on balls.

five innings -two innings each for Graffy and Phelps, one for Elam -before junior Mike Dury closed out a 10­pitch, hitless ninth. 
"It played out exactly as we had hoped," Mainieri said of the pitching workload. "We have two mid-week games. This is when these young pitchers have to get the expe­rience so that when we really throwing them out there for the first time." 
Valparaiso (2-13) managed only two innings from starter Dallas Cawiezell ~eight hits, six earned runs, one strike­out) before turning the ball over to a platoon of four relievers, who allowed four hits and four runs in seven innings of work.
