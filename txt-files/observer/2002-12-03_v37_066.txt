"Building t h c International Space Station orbit is an in.credible engineering [feat!." said NASA spokes­woman Kylie Moritz. 
While leading the Endeavour mission, Wetherbee has worked pri­marily with Hussian cosmo­nauts and U.S. astronauts in an international effort to learn more about the effects microgravity on the human body. 
"The fact they're working together gains a lot of experi­ence for both of the nations," said Moritz. 
Along with Russia, the U.S. is working with about 16 countries, including repre­sentatives from the European Space Agency. 
The Space Station has been inhabited for about two years and the most recent crew was the sixth that has gone. 
Wetherbee, who has logged more than 1,200 hours in space, completed his sixth mission Monday.

Annan is determined to give South Africa and other coun­tries the chance to excel in a global market. With the efforts of Father Oliver Williams, Notre Dame associ­ate professor of management, spearheading the campaign in South Africa, the project is slated to begin in January 2003. The initiative sprouted from Annan's address at the Davos World Economic Forum three year ago resulting in the for­m a ti on of the UN Global Compact composed of nine principles aimed to infuse humanity into economics.

INSIDE COLUMN 


It's Chrisbnas 
Well all the signs are here: ice, snow, frozen cars and falling stu­dents. It is winter in South Bend. 
Sitting at home not far away in Indianapolis, I watched the television weather guys go on about bow bad the weather in South Bend was and talk about how lucky we were not to be there. Yeah, well not that lucky for me, I had to come back. 
While over the break I saw some snow flakes in Indy, none of it stuck around, .and on the drive back there wasn't any snow until I got about a half hour away from the Bend. It just always surprises that even though I'm still in Indiana it feels like a different state up here. 
It's not that I don't like winter but it's a lot nicer to be able to just sit in your room and enjoy a cup of tea, watching the snow fall through the window. 
It's a lot different outside, trying to struggle through the cold wind and over icy sidewalks and already my car door froze shut. Luckily, I could get the passenger side open and I just crawled over to the driver's seat. 
Of course, like most people, I enjoy the holidays (Christmas, Hanukkah or whatever you choose to celebrate), the end of the semester (if I don't go insane first) and I get the added bonus of celebrating my birthday (Dec. 31, in case you want to get me something), but I never fully realize how close the end of the year is until I see the snow. 
Ultimately, the snow and ice always tells me that Christmas is almost here, making me want to listen to Christmas music and wrap presents. Instead of doing homework when I got back to campus Sunday night I decided to decorate my room with Christmas decor and watch A Christmas Story. This includes setting up my all important dorm Christmas tree, which isn't that hard since it is the size of my hand and just needs to be taken out of the box. 
There is something about the sea­son that definitely brings out the little kid in me. I still wake up before the sun is up on Christmas day, the only day of the year I'm up before 6 a.m., to ohh and ahh the tree. And even though I've grown up with snow my whole life, I still look forward to the first snowman of the season, snowball fights and snow angels. 
With the start of the winter weather at least there are many things to look forward to because despite the draw­backs the positives outweigh the neg­atives. 
So along with the snow, ice, winter coats and earmuffs at least you can be safe in the knowledge that the semester is almost over (can you tell I can't wait?) and the fun is just start­ing.

SMC takes action against FGM 


By SHANNON NELLIGAN 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's is taking a stand against female genital mutila­tion (FGM), a practice common in parts of Africa. 
Assistant professor of English Alexis Brooks-DeVita is provok­ing interest in the global issues oy sharing her experience with FGM. She is currently urging the Saint Mary's community to sponsor women who have run away from their homes to escape FGM. 
"l first read about it [FGM) occurring in my Diaspora class with Dr. Brooks-UeVita and then in my World Civilization class with [associate professor of history) Dr. llamilton," said Katie Vincer. president of Holy Cross llall and senior literature major. 
Last summer Brooks-DeVita returned to her childhood home of Uganda to chair a panel on African/Diaspora women's liter­ature at the Women's World 
2002 Congress. Upon her return to cam­pus she grap­pled with the memories and realized that some things needed to change in Uganda. 
It is ideas like this one that prompted

Sen. Kerry increases criticism of president 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 
Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry attacked the Bush administration Monday, saying it gave a boost to insurance companies last week while allowing 1 million people to lose their unemployment benefits just after Christmas. 
"This administration is will­ing to do terrorism insurance for big industry, but they weren't willing to do unem­ployment compensation for people who are out of work," the senator from Massachusetts said a day after announcing he would form a presidential exploratory committee. "That's the big difference in how we approach the econo­my." 
The White House said Kerry was making a political jab at 
the president.  
"It's the political  season  
beginning  for  the  
Democrats,"  said  White  

House spokeswoman Claire Buchan. "The American peo­ple know that the president has demonstrated leadership in fighting the war on terror­ism and fighting for economic security for the American people. That's the president's focus." 
Congress adjourned for the year without extending job­less benefits for laid-off workers facing the expiration of federal unemployment compensation starting Dec. 28. 
Last week, President Bush signed a bill that would reim­burse the insurance industry up to $100 billion in a future terror attack. 
At a news conference Monday, Kerry gave a brief preview of his economic plan, which he planned to lay out Tuesday in Cleveland. 
He charged that Bush is focusing on his tax cut while overlooking the plight of working Americans. 
"President Bush, beginning with the snows of New Hampshire in the year 2000, has consistently talked about only a tax cut for the wealthi­est Americans as his one pro­gram," Kerry said. 
Kerry reiterated his call for a "tax break to the working families of America now in the form of a payroll tax deduction." He also said he would call for some spending cuts. business tax incentives and "a major infrastructure investment in America." 
"We need to invest in our cities, in our rural communi­ties," Kerry said. "This administration has ignored that and that's how you put people back to work." 
Kerry, a leading Senate lib­eral and a decorated Vietnam War veteran. announced his presidential intentions Sunday. He said an official announcement of his candi­dacy is months away. 
Exploratory committees are established by budding can­didates mainly to raise money, finance travels and help gauge voter support. 
Asked Sunday night about the prospect of running against Kerry, Bush smiled at reporters but said nothing. 
Kerry, a 58-year-old former prosecutor first elected to the Senate in 1984, was unop­posed for re-election in November to a fourth term. 
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean already is running for presi­dent. Former Vice President Al Gore, the 2000 nominee, and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards expect to disclose their plans after Christmas. Outgoing House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri is expected to begin telling colleagues whether he plans to run.

"Kofi Annan had the strong conviction that if the UN is to be relevant today that it must enlist the help of multination­al companies," said Williams. "[He] argued that shared val­ues provide a stable environ­ment for a world market and that without these explicit values businesses could expect backlashes from pro­tectionism, populism, fanati­cism and terrorism," he said. 
Expecting to serve a one­ye a r appointment to the National Global Compact Network, Williams along with members of the UN will attempt to forge together broad corporate support in placing South Africa in the position to compete in the global market. 
"In the world we live in, we've got to find some way to have ground rules for the global economy so that there is a level playing field," said Williams. "We must find some way to develop moral standards that will be fol­lowed by all multinational companies; that is the role of the UN Global Compact." 
But persuading companies to voluntarily adopt the Compact is sometimes a diffl­cult matter -especially U.S. of adopting the Compact multinationals.

The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks produced the single deadliest day in the history of 
U.S. law enforcement -72 officers killed -yet almost as many died in nonterrorist inci­dents during 2001 as violence against police rose to a four­year high. 
The collapse of the World Trade Center in New York after the twin towers were struck by hijacked airliners accounted for 71 of last year's 142 law enforcement killings. the FBI reported Monday. The 72nd victim was a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officer who died when a plane com­mandeered by terrorists crashed in a Pennsylvania field. 
Overshadowed by the enor­mity of those numbers is another statistic: 70 other law enforcement officers were killed by criminals around the country in 2001, the highest number since 1997 and a 37 percent increase over the 51 slain in 2000. 
"Law enforcement is a high­risk occupation," the FBI report says. "The men and women who serve the public in this way place themselves in danger as a matter of rou­tine." 
Still, the nonterrorism deaths are far below those recorded in the 1970s, when it was common for more than 200 officers to die violently or in accidents every year, said Craig Floyd, chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund in Washington. That number for 2001 would be about 148. 
"Fewer police are being killed in the line of duty than there were 30 years ago," Floyd said. "We've got more police on the street than we've ever had. Thev have better training and they're no longer outgunned by the criminals."

U.N. weapons inspectors search Iraqi missile plant 
Associated I'ress 
BAGIIDAD It was combed over by inspec­tors. then blasted for days by 
U.S. air attack. But four years later the Karama ballistic <lcsign planL is still a focus of world concern. a place where new U.N. inspectors Monday conducted tlrnir longest search yet. looking for signs of out­lawed Iraqi missiles. 
l\fter six hours in the well­guarded Baghdad compound, they dopartcd, and the plant's deputy director said all went well. "They didn't !'ind any­thing." Brig. Mohammed Salah told reporters. 
The inspectors, as usual, had no immediate comment for wailing journalists. But a U.N. report later Monday said some equipment of' interest at Karama was missing. The Iraqis said some of the missing equipment had been destroyed in U.S. air attacks and some had been transferred. 
It was the fifth day of renewed arms inspections after a four-year break. Until Monday. the longest inspections had been running about four hours, some much shorter. 
The inspections come under a new U.N. Security Council man­date requiring Iraq to shut down any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs as well as any facilities to build missiles with more than the 90­mile range allowed under U.N. resolutions after the 1991 Gulf War. 
A second U.N. team, of nuclear inspectors, visited industrial sites north of Baghdad on Monday. 
Inspectors in the 1990s elimi­nated tons of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons and the equipment to make them, dis­mantled Iraq's effort to build nuclear bombs, and destroyed scores or longer-range Iraqi missiles. Those inspectors didn't believe they found all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, however. 
President Bush threatens to wage war on Iraq -with or without U.N. sanclion -if it doesn't disarm. Bush indicated Monday he wasn't impressed with Iraq's cooperation thus far, saying inspectors don't have the duty or ability to uncover weapons of mass destruction hidden in the vast country, but that Iraq has a responsibility to provide evi­dence of total disarmament. 
"So far, the signs are not encouraging," Bush said in a toughly worded speech at the Pentagon. 
Other governments say that only the Security Council can authorize such an attack on

Al-Qaida statement claims responsibility for attack 
Associated Press 
CAIRO 

A statement attributed to al-Qaida claimed responsibility Monday for last wcnk's car-bombing of an Israeli­owned hotel in Kenya and the attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner the same day. 
The statement. posted on an Islamic Web site, called the Thursday attacks a Hamadan greeting to the Palestinian people and referred to the al-Qaida attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. 
"At the same place where the 'Jewish Crusader coalition' was hit four years ago ... here the fighters ... came back once again to strike heavily against that evil coalition," the statement said. "But this time, it was against Jews... " 
In Washington, U.S. counterterrorism oflicials said they considered the claim credible and part of growing evidence that al-Qaida was involved in the Kenya attacks. 
Three suicide bombers attacked the Paradise Hotel, where 16 people were killed including the three bombers. Just minutes before the hotel bombing, two Strela missiles narrowly missed an Israeli charter plane departing from Mombasa's airport, in what was the first phase of the dual attack on Israelis in Kenya. 
The 5-page claim was made in the name of "The Political Office of al­Qaida Jihad Organization." 
Unlike four years ago, when the United States was the target in Kenya, the statement said this time the mes­sage was for Jews. 
"We send them a message: Your practices in corrupting earth, occupy­

ing sacred places, criminal acts against our families in Palestine ... all your practices will not pass peacefully with­out firing back," it said. "Your children for ours, your women for ours, your elders for ours, and we will follow you wherever you are because you made us live in terror and fear." 
It pledged that further attacks would be carried out. 
The only other claim of responsibility for Thursday's attacks came from the previously unknown Army of Palestine. Palestinian officials have denied any involvement by Palestinian groups.

CHINA 
Russia, China draw closer 
AssociaLed P r~s 
BEIJING 
The leaders of Russia and China vowed Monday to strengthen their "strategic partnership" and declared common positions on key foreign policy fronts. urging peaceful solutions in lraq and North Korea and promising to support each other's battles with Muslim separatists. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's Jiang Zemin signed a 13­page joint declaration call­ing for a ''multipolar world" -a phrase used by both to express dissatisfaction with 
U.S. global dominance. 
Putin emphasized that Russia -which spans Europe and Asia -wants partners and power in both the East and West. 
·"We're absolutely certain that the special strategic relationship between Russia and China will not only enable us to solve the prob­lems facing our countries, but also will create a basis for stability in the world," Putin said. 
His two-day visit comes after a year in which he improved relations with the United States and Europe by supporting the interna­tional anti-terror campaign and accepting NATO enlargement. 
Putin spoke Tuesday morning at Peking University, where he was 
month that the 1994 agree­ment had collapsed after the United States, South Korea, Japan and the 15­nation European Union sus­pended fuel oil supplies. The cutoff was meant to punish the North for start­ing a new nuclear weapons program. 
The statement urged the "normalization of relations" between Washington and Pyongyang. 
"At this stage we are talk­ing about a political dia­logue within the framework of which any questions could be discussed including those that raise concerns for either America or North Korea," said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher welcomed the appeal ·to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. 
"I think our view is that the more often the interna­tional community makes clear to the North Koreans that only by complying will they be able to obtain the benefits they seek from the international community," Boucher said.

The United States has threatened war to disarm Iraq if it violates the latest Security Council resolution, but Russia and China insist that only the council can make that decision. Both are permanent council members with power to veto U.N. actions. 
Moscow and Beijing have tried to restrain U.S. domi­nance by insisting that the United Nations should have the last word in interna­tional affairs. 
Putin and Jiang also offered each other mutual backing for China in its struggle against separatists in its Muslim northwest and Russia's war in predomi­nantly Muslim Chechnya. 
The leaders accused other governments of "double standards" on terrorism and human rights. saying they reject "the use of human rights questions as a lever for pressure in inter­national relations." 
They said "terrorists and separatists" in Chechnya and northwestern China are international terrorists who "should be condemned and become the object of a com­mon fight on the part of all the states of the world."

IN BRIEF 
Argentina eases partial bank freeze 
President Eduardo Duhalde eased a year­old partial banking freeze on Monday, allow­ing Argentines unfettered access to their checking and savings accounts. 
"Today, life begins without the 'corralito, "' declared Alfred Atanasof, a government spokesman, using the Spanish nickname for the widely unpopular restrictions imposed last Dec. 1 as the economy unraveled. 
Atanasof said the government had decided to relax the restrictions on the anniversary of the freeze in an effort to stimulate the coun­try's slagnant economy. Restrictions still remain on longer-term certificates of deposit. 
Since October, the governn:ient has been slowly reopening the banking system, which was virtually locked down last year after Argentines pulled $20 billion from the banks during a panicky run that threatened to col­lapse the financial system. At major banks in Buenos Aires. Argentines lined up to with­draw cash from newly unfrozen accounts Monday. Others crowded exchange houses, hoping to change their pesos for dollars. 
Bank, insurers face off in Enron trial

The Chase alTiliate, Mahonia Ud., made six deals known as prl'paid commodity forwards with Enron beginning in 1998, in which Enron was paid in advance for oil and natural gas to be d1ilivercd months or years later.

EU asks Swiss banks to drop secrecy 
Associated Press 
BERN 
Swiss banking secrecy, epitomized by the legendary numbered bank account, is under attack. Again. 
Leading the offensive are Britain and its European Union allies, who want the Swiss to blow the whistle on wealthy EU nationals who put their money in Swiss accounts to dodge taxes at home. 
But Switzerland, which sees itself as the victim of unfair pressure from the 15-nation bloc, is refusing to budge. Swiss oflicials argue that tough new laws passed in the 1990s mean secre­cy is readily lifted and accounts are frozen in investigations into money laundering and terrorism. 
But while tax evasion is a crime in many EU countries, it is only an administrative offense in Switzerland. 

"We're prepared under certain cir­cumstances to help our EU neigh­bors," said Swiss President Kaspar Villiger, who also acts as finance min­ister. "But we always start from the position that the citizen is basically honest and should be treated as such." 
Frustrated by failure to agree on common rules, EU finance ministers will meet Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss possible measures against the Swiss government. 
The bloc wants Switzerland auto­matically to release information about deposits of EU nationals in Swiss bank accounts to prevent the collapse of an agreement among member nations to exchange information on cross-border savers. 
The EU plan, adopted in 2000 and due to come into force on Jan. 1, was to enable tax authorities in a deposi­tor's homeland to levy taxes on any interest earned on the savings. 
However, Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium insisted that if they were to loosen their own bank secrecy laws, then non-EU countries like Switzerland and the United States would have to agree on similar mea­sures. 
The EU has said it is close to a deal with the United States, but negotia­tions with Switzerland have dead­locked, jeopardizing talks with small­er tax havens like Liechtenstein. Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and the island of Jersey. 
Switzerland has made some conces­sions, offering to levy a 35 percent tax on the interest EU citizens earn on their savings in Swiss accounts and to pay part of the money directly to EU nations without revealing the account holder's identity.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 

Space shuttle Endeavour undockcd from the internation­al space station Monday and headed for home with the one American and two Russians who spent the past six months aboard the orbiting outpost. 
"We promise to take good care of space station." astro­naut Donald Pettit told its departing commander, cosmo­naut Valery Korzun. 
Before leaving, shuttle skip­per James Wetherbee urged Pettit to try to keep his sense of humor during the long stretch ahead. "Oh. I will," Pettit assured him. 
Endeavour is due back on Earth on Wednesday, though storms are forecast for Cape Canaveral and could delay the long-overdue homecoming for Korzun, cosmonaut Sergei Treschev and astronaut Peggy Whi1son. 
They spent an extra 1 1/2 months aloft because of vari­ous shuttle problems; Monday was their 180th day in orbit. 
The space station's three new occupants are Pettit, astronaut Kenneth Bowersox and cosmonaut Nikolai Budarin. Unlike the first five se1s of space station residents, they will spend the next four months in solitude, with no one showing up until it is their turn lo go home in March. 
"It's so much quieter here now, Houston. I don't know what the deal is," Bowersox radioed. 
"We're still here with you," Mission Control replied.

"That's good to know," Bowersox said. "We'd be really lonely without you guys." 
Endeavour departed after its crew delivered and installed a new $390 million girder on the space station. The two space­craft separated 250 miles above Australia, ending one week of joint flight. 
As Endeavour sailed off into the darkness, Wetherbee wished Bowersox .and his crew "fair winds and following seas." Both men arc Navy cap­tains. 
Bowersox thanked Wetherbee for the ride to the space station. "We wish you a safe landing and warm greet­ings and hugs from all your friends and families down below," Bowersox called out. 
Two of Endeavour's crew performed three spacewalks to hook up the 45-foot girder and correct a design flaw in the air­conditioning lines. 
The final spacewalk was especially dramatic. A railcar crucial for station construction got snagged on its tracks by a protruding radio antenna. John Herrington, the first American Indian in space, removed the obstruction and got the railcar moving again. 
Once Endeavour was at a safe distance from the space station, the shuttle crew released a pair of 4-inch satel­lites from a canister in the cargo bay, as part of a Defense Department experiment. The two so-called picosateHites were connected by a 50-foot tether.

LONDON 
The British government accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Monday of master­minding the widespread and systematic torture of his politi­cal opponents and other citizens to hold on to power. 
But some commentators dis­missed the evidence in the dossier presented by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw as old news and part of a propaganda war to back up the case for pos­sible U.S.-led military action in lraq. 
"I think that this highly unusual, indeed unprecedented, publication is cranking up for war," said Tam Dalyell, a law­maker from the governing Labor Party. 
The dossier includes the story of Um llaydar, a 25-year-old woman who was dragged from her house and publicly behead­ed in 2001 after her husband, suspected by the authorities of involvement in armed opposi­tion activities, fled Iraq. Guards took away her children and mother-in-law, and they have not been heard from since, the dossier said. 
Straw said the 23-page gov­ernment report showed that the Iraqi people lived in fear and that Saddam's regime was in breach of its international oblig­ations. 
"By disarming Iraq, we not only help those countries in the region which are subject to Iraqi threats and intimidation. we also deprive Saddam of his most powerful tools for keeping the Iraqi people living in fear and subjugation," said Straw.

gence material, firsthand 
accounts of Iraqi victims of tor­
ture and oppression, and 
reports by non-governmental 
organizations. 

"The dossier makes for bar­rowing reading, with accounts of torture, rape and other hor­rific human rights abuses," Straw said in a speech to the Atlantic Partnership, a group that works on improving rela­tions between Europe and North America. 
"It makes it clear these are 
carried out as part of the delib­
erate policy of the regime. The 
aim is to remind the world that 
the abuses of the Iraqi regime 
extend far beyond its pursuit of 
weapons of mass destruction in 
violation of its international 
obligations." 

Legislator George Galloway, whose visits to Iraq and dogged opposition to U.N. sanctions have earned him the nickname "the MP for Baghdad West," said there was no doubt the Iraqi regime was guilty of gross human rights abuses, but that the report had vested interests. 
"There is torture and murder in Iraq, but that isn't a reason per se for going to war and killing tens of thousands," Galloway said. 
Britain and United States have warned they may take action if Baghdad holds back any infor­mation or fails to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspec­tors, who recently returned to the country. 
Amnesty International, one of the non-governmental organiza­tions whose research was quot­ed in the dossier, warned that the human rights situation in Iraq should not be used for political ends.

rights violations in Iraq during 
the 1980·88 Iran-Iraq war. 
"As the debate on whether to 
use military force against Iraq 
escalates, the human rights of 
the Iraqi people, as a direct con­
sequence of any potential mili­
tary action, is sorely missing 
from the equation," the state­
ment said. 
Even an lraqi scientist asked 
by the Foreign Office to provide 
details about abuses was critical 
of possible military action 
against Iraq. 
'Tm extremely concerned of the consequences of this inter­vention to the Iraqi people." said Hussein Al-Shahristani, a former expert with the Iraqi atomic energy organization. Al­Sh ahristani has said he was held in solitary confinement for 11 years for refusing to work on Saddam's nuclear weapons pro­gram. 
"I'm concerned that weapons of mass destruction, the chemi­cal weapons in particular, could be used again by the regime against the people if they show any opposition or uprising," he added. 
According to the dossier, Iraq is a "terrifying place to live" where "arbitrary arrests and killings are commonplace." 
Political dissidents are tor­tured, women lack basic human rights and are routinely raped by security personnel while in custody, and political prisoners are kept in inhumane and degrading conditions, the report said. 
It details Saddam's persecu­tion of Iraq's ethnic Kurds and the Shiite religious community and provides a checklist of methods of torture, including eye gouging, electric shock and piercing hands with electric drills. 
"Saddam Hussein has been ruthless in his treatment of any opposition to him since his rise to power in 1979," the report concluded. "A cruel and callous disregard for human life and suffering remains the hallmark of his regime."

When drinking a Starbucks Frappaccino, you eventually get to a point at which there's no real coffee left, but your cup is still half full of foam. I've always thought this to be a great metaphor for the consumer Amy Schlll culture that Starbucks repre­sents: in the end, 
Dazed and 
it's all foam and 
Amused 
no substance. 
But before I preach to you about the problems with con­sumerism, let's first establish that I'm the biggest hypocrite in the world. I drink my fancy coffee drinks, wear sweat-shop produced Nikes and con­sume all sorts of useless products on a frequent basis, all the while trying to present myself as an opponent to the world in which I partake. Yeah, I've bought all this stuff, but my shirt cost a dollar at the thrift store, so I'm sticking it to the man, right? I have more buttons and ribbons on my bookbag than a dress on Oscar night, but my actual activism is full of foam. Still, I take solace in the fact that if I stop drinking Chai tea lattes, the ter­rorists will have won. 
In attacking consumerism, I've also set up a convenient threshold for excessive consumption, a threshold I myself could never reach. I deplore Escalades and cruises as wasteful, but then again, I could never afford them anyway. Meanwhile, books and CDs, my primary consumption goods, are obviously perfectly acceptable. The view from my ivory tower is rather nice actually, and the music is great. 
So yeah, hello there kettle, I'm pot, great to meet you. I'm a consumer 

consume you 
just like you, and I have no real right 
to judge, but it looks like I'm in con­
trol of print culture right now, and 
you're not, so put down the Palm Pilot and listen for a bit. 
Consumerism as an end in itself is very problematic. Before you prepare my passport to China. let me explain myself. I'm not suggesting you aban­don all your possessions and live off of roots, herbs and Barbara Striesand albums. After all. if we stop buying Escalades, the hard-working Americans who make them will be out of their jobs and might have to work at Starbucks. 
We've embraced an economic sys­tem that pretty much forces us to buy crap we don't need just to keep the system going, and it appears as though this system is the best one out there. So, because it gives a job to someone else, and because having that DVD player doesn't really hurt anyone, consumerism is arguably morally neutral. So buy, buy away! 
Not so fast, Susie. It's not the things that are bad, but basing your life around attaining more and more materials possessions is. A little while back, my parents lost one of their two -count 'em, two -cell phones. Before it was found, there was curs­ing, spitting and general mayhem. all over something they didn't really need in the first place. Last May I thought the world was going to end when my computer wasn't working properly. My parents and I let our lives be controlled by our possessions, and it is at that point where we have to question consumerism. 
There is a lot of outcry right now about corporate greed, but corporate greed exists because personal greed exists. If we base our lives on attain­ing more money so we can get more stuff, people will indeed get hurt; ask a former Enron employee. No, you're certainly not a bad person for liking your XBox, but when you don't get that paper done because you've spent the last two hours trying to figure out which remote control is for the satel­lite and which is for your automated tie rack/Pez dispenser, you might want to take some time to reexamine your priorities. 
Don't let what you consume con sume you, whether it be electronics, cars or books on esoteric literary the­ory. And perhaps you might occasion­ally want to spend your money or your time helping those with nothing instead of trying to obtain everything. However, there are plenty of people at this school who do many more good things than I do, so let's just stop my hypocrisy while we can. 
So the point is, you don't really need that Abercrombie shirt, and I don't really need the 100th expansion pack for The Sims. I'm slowly learning, though, that as long as I realize what's really important and work for the day when more people can partic­ipate in economic life, I'm not evil for having a few nice things. I hope you've all learned something. I have to make my Christmas list now.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Defining racism 

Minorities cannot be racist. Misusing the word "racism" is extremely damaging. and every week in Notre Dame classrooms, The Observer, and conversations around campus. I hear people misstate actions as "racist." Though some use the word correctly based on its intended and true definition. most undermine the message of the word by not fully understanding its meaning. I want to offer some clarification. 
Hacism. as defined by author Beverley Tatum, exists in a "system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices -a system [that] clearly operates to the advantage of whites." This element of social power is crucial to understanding racism. Racism goes beyond just "prejudice plus power" but implies an access to social resources by those wiLh social power. In Lhe United States, this includes whites, Christians, heterosexuals, economically privileged and the able-bodied, among others. As such, minorities do not have the traditional and insti­tulional power to be racist. 
Though all people can be prejudiced, discriminatory and cruel, being racist goes beyond individual actions and beliefs. Dr. Moss, assistant vico president of student affairs, uses a definition in his diversity educa­tion class which states that "systematic subordination is supported by cultural norms and values and the institutional structures and prac­tices of society." This system has strong roots and ubiquitous effects. 
There arc certain, specific situations in which a African-American CEO, for example, exercises power over a certain white employee, but as soon as the CEO leaves her office, she is subject to the same institu­tionalized racism and social disadvantages that have been in place for centuries. By and large, she simply does not benefit from the systemat­ic structures of power in society. 
Clearly, most people are simply unaware of full meaning of racism. But consistently overlooking the most fundamental component ofsocial power and what this means in today's society works against the mis­sion of cultural awareness and diversity education. I call on all students and faculty to further explore the dimensions of the issue. More infor­mation is available at the oflice of Multicultural Student Programs and Services.

Democrats act like sore losers 
I didn't think they could do it. but Tom Daschle, Al Gore and the rest of the Democrats have outdone themselves once again. Last week Daschle blamed conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh for incit­ing supposed "threats" made against his fami­ly and compared Limbaugh and conservatives to the Muslim fanatics with whom we are cur­rently at war. Daschle declared, "We see it in foreign countries and we think, 'Well, my God, how can this religious fundamentalism become so violent?' Well, it's that same shrill rhetoric, it's that same shrill power that moti­vates ... And that's happening in this country." 
He went on to say, "What happens when Hush Limbaugh attacks those of us in public life is that people aren't satisfied just to listen, they want to act because they get emotionally invested." Who would think that citizens in a democratic republic would want to become "emotionally invested" in the issues facing their country? r think Election Day 2002 clear­ly demonstrates Mr. Daschle's apprehension -the American people became interested in the actions (and inactions) of their elected offi­cials, especially in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Perhaps this is just another indication of why the Democrats are still scratching their heads after their unprecedented defeats on Nov. 5. 
Regarding the "shrill rhetoric" Daschle con­demned, how soon we forget Alec Baldwin's urging, at the height ofthe Lewinsky scandal, that impeachment manager Henry Hyde be stoned to death, or the television commercials warning that black churches would burn if Republicans were elected or most recently George W. Bush pushing an old lady in a wheelchair off the roofof a high-rise building on the Democratic National Committee's own website. 

Then in an interview with the New York Observer, the former Vice-President denounced some news outlets because or their supposed conservative tendencies. The "Pox News network, The Washington Times, Rush Limbaugh -there's a bunch of them," he complained. 
Mr. Gore, there's a reason why the Fox News Channel is "America's Number One News Channel" -the American people are sick of the liberal-adoring, conservative-bash­ing major news networks, CNN and Hollywood. Polls reveal that 89 percent of the media voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, and upwards of93 percent voted for him in 1996. Need I say more? 
Regarding the Washington Times: When the ultra-liberal Washington Post is your number one competitor, anything even remotely close to the center appears bent "to the right." And why is Rush Limbaugh so popular with 20 mil­lion listeners daily? In addition to his incredi­ble talent "on loan from God" (his words), it is because radio is the one news outlet that lib­erals have not conquered. 
These recent outbursts by two of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party demonstrate the state of leadership (or lack thereoO currently within the party. They had better learn to handle defeat gracefully and grow from their failures and shortcomings like the rest of us; otherwise, 2002 could prove to be just the first of many resounding defeats for the once-proud party of "the common man."

Homosexuals should not be blamed for Church scandals 
I would like to clarify some of the miscon­ceptions in Stephen R. Sanchez's Nov. 25 letter, "Homosexuality presents problem to priesthood." Sanchez scapegoats and blames gay priests for the recent instances of sexual misconduct. Sanchez charges the "homosexual minority" with cover-up when the bishops, conse­crated to act as the rep­resentatives of Christ and shepherds of the people, single-hand­edly covered up cases of abuse and allowed the abuse to contin­ue by transferring pedophiles. 
The idea of a pow­crful gay subculture in seminaries is a myth. Granted, gays make up a significantly large number of those in religious formation, but in the context of a celi­bate lifestyle everyone is viewed as an equal, regardless of sexual orientation. 
Sanchez is adamant that "Homosexuals cannot escape the temptations of the world by becoming priests." The priesthood has never been about removing temptation; rather, formation has sought to help priests deal with and control temptation. To say that straight men can control their tempta­tions while gay men cannot is prejudiced. 
Sanchez writes that the priesthood is, "not something you do because you can't do something else." What Sanchez fails to real­ize is that when gay men enter the semi­nary, they are leaving many other options. Whether the Church will recognize it or not, 
homosexuals can have fulfilling, exclusive 
same-sex relationships. Sanchez cites disagreement with Church practice as a cause of the 
scandal. Had the Church remained faithful to its own 
teachings coming out of Vatican II and decentralized some power, cover-ups by our 
bishops would not have been able to occur on so grandiose a scale. 
The Church is attempting to 
avoid accepting responsibility for the scandal by shifting blame and scapegoating gays. 
If gays are restricted from the priesthood, the seminary will certainly become a more sexual­ly repressive place. A repressive seminary produced the sexually immature priests who abused in the 
first place. If the Church is to restrict gays, aside from a major downturn in the number of men ordained. the decades to come will foster scandal by sexually imma­ture priests on a much greater scale than has been seen in the past year.

Requiring alternative vehicles won't ease pollution 
I am writing in regards to Joanna Mikulski's Nov. 26 column "What Would Jesus Drive?" 
Jesus was a carpenter, and he would drive the very type of vehi­cles this group seeks to discredit: light trucks. Most likely he would have a Ford F150 with a big V8, a lumber rack and tool box in the bed for work and a large SUV -perhaps a Ford Excursion -for hauling around all the apostles and their fishing boats. 
As for mandating alternative fuel vehicles, it is a serious mis­take. California's Air Resources Board (CARB) has tried many times to do this. However, by ultimately forcing manufacturers down the dead-end road of the electric car, it is actually creating more pollution by refusing to allow car companies to cut emis­sions other ways like buying up gross polluters, selling more ULEVs and Hybrids and replacing defective gas containers and pumps. GM's effort to meet the new CARB requirements alone cost them an estimated $1.5 billion and resulted in 1,000 EV1 electric cars (that's $1.5 million per car). These losses were inevitably passed on to the consumer. As for EVls. they can't even give them away. 
Good old gasoline, though demonized by environmentalists and now apparently Christian fundamentalists, is still the most effi­cient way to propel a car down the road. Even the environmental­ly exalted Fuel-Cell, "whose only emission is pure water," actually pollutes more per mile than gasoline because producing the hydrogen it requires is an extremely energy intensive process. The industry, driven more by consumers than Congress, is already moving in the direction of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), but in small, logical steps, such as hybrid technology first. Trying to force ZEVs on the industry and consumers will only result in more disasters like CARB.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Fo' shizzle Snoop needs some work 
By MIKE SCHMUHL 
Scene M11sic Critic 
Snoop Dogg, formerly Snoop Doggy Dogg, is one of the most popular and influ­ential gangsta rappers of all time. His work and activities with Dr. Dre, Warren G and the late Tupac Shakur landed him his first solo record with 1994's Doggystyle. 
Since then, Snoop Dogg's fame has ele­vated not necessarily because of his rap­ping and multiple albums released to date, but the fact that he's always getting in trouble with the law. In 1993 Snoop was arrested and tried for the murder of a rival gang member, but was not convicted. From 1996-1997 Snoop 's popularity rose with the conviction of Death Row head hauncho Suge Knight and the deaths of Tupac and Biggie Smalls (Notorius 8.1.G.). Snoop was the last man standing. Fo' shizzle. 
After releasing a few smaller, relatively unsuccessful albums with Master P and No Limit Records, Snoop survived with hit sin­gles like "Lay Low" and guest appearances with other popular rappers. 
With the release of his sixth major album, Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$, Snoop attempts to show the rap world that he's still the Top Dogg. The first song, "Tha Bo$$ Would Like To See You," sets the tone for the album. Snoop isn't simply entertain­ing, he's preaching that he's better than everyone and has the money, the style and the hoes to prove it. 
The songs "Stoplight," Wasn't Your Fault," "Hourglass" and "I Miss That B-" are all co-produced and performed with the help of none other than George Clinton and some P-Funk members. The songs all include many different sound effects that 
Paid Tha Cost to Be Da Bo$$ 
SnoopDogg 
Priority Records 

create an absurd commotion of noise. Snoop's presence on these songs is hardly apparent and he mumbles lines like "You can't control this game" during pauses in the beat. 
The songs "I Believe in You" and "Ballin"' sound as though they should be on Whitney Houston's Christmas album and Burt Bacharach's Greatest Hits, respectively. "I Believe in You" features a gospel singer in the backgroillld as Snoop testi­fies, "I couldn't give you away/ No matta what my friends s-iz­ay/ When I'm gone/ Away from home/ I'm alone everyd-iz-ay." "Ballin' contains a piano melody throughout the song with a delirious samba beat. Snoop and fellow rappers place 

their ego in the forefront and the "talent" they talk about is certainly absent from this song. 
The rest of the songs are overproduced and stray from the quality of Snoop's earli­er work, with the exception of "Lollipop" and "From Long Beach 2 Brick City." "Lollipop" includes the production of the Neptunes and a brisk flute and conga beat. Snoop's rapping is humorous and the guest appearances of Jay-Z, Soopafly and Nate Dogg construct a strong song. "From Long Beach 2 Brick City" sounds like a Doggystyle song with a gurgling bass beat and smart rapping from the professionals 

Snoop Dogg's new album shows that fo' shlzzle he needs to spend his time working on his rap rather than behind bars. 
Redman and Warren G. 
Paid Tha Cost to Be Da Bo$$ is summed up by Snoop in his own words on the self­centered track "Suited N Booted." "G-ed up from the feet up,' Fo' shizzle my nizzle/ D-0 double gizzle back up in the hizzle/ Fo' shizzle." Snoop needs to focus more on his music than his lifestyle and create rap albums with entertaining lyrics and a solid beat. If he sticks wit his shizzle, he's bound not to fizzle, won't be no lo$$. but will be Da Bo$$.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Quality defines McCartney's music 
By JULIE BENDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
It is only in rare instances that a music reviewer can know the quality of an album before listening to it. Even the most credi­ble artists in the music business have their dud albums. The Beatles, however, are an exception. To look back on their albums now, one is awed at the quality of music 
that lies on each track. The Beatles are one of the few bands whose albums can be listened to in their entirety with­out skipping any tracks. Every album, from the nascent strumming of Please Please Me to the smooth medleys of Abbey Road, is remark­able. It is this consistent musical quality which earned the Beatles their reputation as the greatest band of all time, an opinion which 
hardly  anyone  can  
refute.  
Even  though  any  

hope of a Beatles reunion has faded since the deaths of John Lennon and George Harrison, the band's songs continue to rep­resent the highest qual­ity of music just from the mere mention of their titles. That is why a quick look at the list of songs on Paul McCartney's latest release, Back in the U.S. Live 2002, is enough to give the album an excellent review. Any album that includes songs like "Hello Goodbye," "All My Loving," "Blackbird," 'The Fool on the Hill," "Can't Buy Me Love," and "Yesterday," can only be of the best quality. Listening to the album is an unnecessary confirmation of what is already known from a brief scan of 
the track listing. 
The album is 
the exact set list McCartney treated fans to on his recent Driving Rain tour throughout the United States. Disc 1 gets off to a buoyant start with the delight­ful surprise " H e l I o Goodbye." Next comes "Jet," a crowd-pleaser f r o m McCartney's years with Wings, the band that he formed with his late wife Linda in the 
Back In the U.S. live 2002 


'70s. 
Some other highlights from the disc include a gorgeous rendition of the delicate "Blackbird." For this song, McCartney accompanies his vocals with only an acoustic guitar, emphasizing the tenderness of this classic song and the strength he still possesses in his voice. Showcasing some of his newer songs, McCartney also includes the Oscar­nominated "Vanilla Sky." the theme from the movie of the same name, and "Your Loving Flame," a lovely piano ballad dedicated to his new wife, Heather. 


Disc 2 continues the magic with McCartney banging out classic after classic right from the start. He 

opens with a haunting version of Photo courtesy of rollingstone.com "Eleanor Rigby" from the Beatles' Paul McCartney gives his fans only the 1966 masterpiece, Revolver. From best music from rock and roll to balladry. 
that same album, McCartney plays the melodious "Here, There And Everywhere" before he shakes things up with the energetic numbers "Band on the Run" and "Back in the USSR." 
On disc 2, McCartney shines on the many piano ballads he chooses to include. "Maybe I'm Amazed," "Let It Be," "Hey Jude" and "The Long and Winding Road" are only a few examples of the memorable melodies McCartney is famous for. 
Rounding out the album, McCartney fit­tingly selected perhaps his most well­known song, "Yesterday." His gentle guitar picking accompanied by mournful lyrics is as poignant now as it was in the 1960s, showing that McCartney is still a possessor of immense talent in both performance and songwriting. 
In order to bring the album to a proper ending, McCartney rocks out with a medley combination of "Sgt. Pepper Reprise" and "The End," a song from 1969's Abbey Road that toots McCartney's final words of advice, "And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make." 
With such an excellent selection of songs, Live -2002 is a wonderful compilation rep­resentative of McCartney's vast musical career. McCartney. however, doesn't need the glory and praise his songs deserve. As this album shows, from the oldest song to the newest, his music speaks for itself. And oh, what an echo it leaves.

Carson-ogenic 
Palmerproves deadly to Irish in 44-13 Trojan victory 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sp"m Edi ror 
LOS ANGELES 

In a match-up that promised a renewed rivalry and return to glory for two of the nation's premier foot ball programs, the Trojans proved they were a little closer to their return to national prominence. as No. 6 Southern California trounced No. 7 Notre Dame 44-13 in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
After claiming a 13-10 lead with just over a minute to play in the first half, the Irish yielded 34 unanswered points as the Trojans moved the ball at will on the ground and through the air in the second half. 
"The best thing I can say is that we played a good football team today, and that they took it to us and we were not able to stay with them," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. 
Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer pir.ked apart the Irish secondary all night. The fifth-year star shone bright in the national spotlight Saturday, going 32-for-46 passing for 425 yards, with rour touchdowns and two inter­ceptions. 
"I thought Carson did everything he needed to do tonight. I know he wish­es he could have a couple plays back," Trojan coach Pete Carroll said. "Everything else about him, he was stclla:, tonight as only he knows how to be. 
Palmer was near perfect against the Irish, making a late season statement for his place in the ileisman trophy race. The 425 yards passing and 610 total yards given up by the Irish were the highest in the team's history. 
"We were clicking. rolling -it got to the point where every time we didn't score, we were mad," Palmer said. "A lot of people say Notre Dame doesn't have a weakness, and we found them all over the place." 
While the Trojan offense kept the chains moving and the Irish defenders on their heels, the USC defense, led by "I thought it was an extraordinary start of a big night for the Trojan's On the other hand, USC scored on Jim Thorpe Award finalist safety Troy night for our defense -might be the leading receiver Williams, who fin­five of seven drives, outscoring the l'olamalu. was a nightmare for quar­best night we've put together," Carroll ished with 10 catches for 169 yards Irish 27 -0 in the half. terback Carlyle lloliday and the Irish said.

Irish not BCS material 
LOS ANGELES 
An 8-0 start under new coach Tyrone Willingham had Notre Dame fans talking about a 12th national championship several weeks ago. 
After an upset 
home loss to Boston College, a lackluster per­formance versus the Naval Academy and 44-13 trouncing at the hands of USC Saturday 

night, the only championship Joe Hettler Irish fans may look for is one from the Cotton Associate or Gator Bowl. Sports Editor 
And after Saturday's loss, that's how it should be. 
If the defeat to USC told Notre Dame anything it was that although they had a very good season, one better than almost anyone could have imagined. the Irish are still a step or two behind the elites of col­lege football. 
It also told the Irish something else -they shouldn't be selected for a BCS bowl game. 
No way. No how. 
If the Irish had kept it close against USC, one might argue Notre Dame still deserves a chance to play in a BCS bowl game. However, that didn't happen. 
The Trojans offense simply toyed with a good Notre Dame defense. They threw at will. They ran at will. They scored at will. 
And all the Irish could do was watch Carson Palmer elevate his Heisman status more and more each play. He threw for 425 yards and three touchdowns while lead­ing USC to an outrageous 610 yards of total offense. Both the passing and total yards were the most ever given up by a Notre Dame defense in 1,081 games, dating back to 1887. 
Sadly, Notre Dame's offense might have been worse than the defense. 
The Irish tallied 109 yards of offense and four first downs -for the entire game. 
In the final 45 minutes of the possibility of

close to a yard per don't deserve to minute and that's play in the also something a Jordan Black Orange Bowl." BCS-caliber team Irish offensive 
offensive tackle
just doesn't let happen. 
ln Notre Dame's defense, USC isn't just a good team -they're teetering on greatness. The Trojans arguably have the best quarterback in the country, the best wide receiver tandem and two very good running backs. The Trojans also scored 30 points or more in eight games this season, which marks the first time a USC team accomplished that since 1974. 
They came into the Notre Dame game ranked 14th in total defense and showed why they are one of the most underrated units in the coun­try. 
That combination of an incredible offense and a suffocating defense make USC as good as any team in the nation. 
Still, had Notre Dame been worthy of a BCS bowl berth, they would have hung with the Trojans a lot more than they did. 
After the game Willingham argued that one game shouldn't ruin Notre Dame's chances at a BCS berth. 
"I can make a case for us going to a BCS bowl," Willingham said. "The case is that we've played 12 ball­games and we've won ten of those ballgames and we've been a very improved and very sound football team. This one game can not be a true indicator of that." 

However, the Irish players had mixed feelings concerning the 
tackle Jordan 
Black said. "This 
wasn't this year's team, it was last year's team that showed up tonight." 
Irish quarterback Carlyle Holiday didn't really make a great case for the Irish either. 
"I don't know what [the loss] does," Holiday said. "I'm not really concerned about that. The only thing we're concerned is about com­ing out and performing well in our bowl game, whatever bowl that may be." 
Likely that bowl would be the Cotton or Gator bowl, although there are several other possibilities too. 
One of which could still be the Orange Bowl. 
If Washington State beats UCLA next week, the Cougars go to the Rose Bowl and USC should, by all means, pack their bags for Miami. But if UCLA pulls off the upset, USC clinches the Rose Bowl berth to like­ly face Iowa. 
This leaves teams like Oklahoma, Notre Dame and Kansas State the chance to sneak into the Orange Bowl. However, Saturday's perfor­mance should have made the BCS selection committee remember back to 2000 when Notre Dame was picked to play against Oregon State in the Fiesta Bowl, only to see the Beavers hand the Irish their worst bowl loss ever, 41-9. 
That type of blowout could happen again if the Irish are undeservingly matched against a much better team. And that'd be a real shame for this team, especially the seniors who've done such a great job of returning the Irish to back to glory. 
Notre Dame is close to having a great team. Willingham and his coaches have done an almost mirac­ulous job turning around a sputter­ing program in such a short amount of time. 
But the loss to USC shows that Notre Dame isn't quite at the level of the nation's best football teams. 
So the most deserving option for Notre Dame would be an invitation to a Jan. 1st bowl game and a chance to reach the 11 win plateau. 
That scenario would be a great ending to an excellent season for the Irish. 
But if the best teams are supposed to play in the BCS bowl games. then Notre Dame shouldn't be there. A 31-point loss proves that. Being out gained by 501 yards proves that. Gaining two first downs in the sec­ond half against the Trojans proves that. 
Black may have said it best when described what the loss to USC felt like. 

"I just want to go home and throw up," Black said. Point taken. -

In the palm of his hands 

. Palmer throws for 425 yards as he looks to BCS, Heisman 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sporrs Writer 
LOS ANGELES 

Fans chanted his name. Teammates chanled "Heisman." But all Carson Palmer wanted to do was savor the final moments of his final game in Los Angeles Coliseum. ''I don't even know how I'm feeling right now, lhis is amazing," Palmer said. "To finish our careers here, this way. I don't know how to explain the way I'm feeling right now. This is amazing." 
i\s Palmer walked off the field after orchestrating the most successful offensive performance by a Notre Dame opponent, he allowed himself a briuf smile -one of many the senior quarterback cracked Saturday evening. 
All Palmer did was complete 32-of­46 passes for 425 yards and four touchdowns, handily picked apart a normally stingy Irish secondary, and single-handedly improved the Trojans case for making a BCS bowl and his chances for winning the llcisman Trophy. 
In his wake, the Trojan quarterback left a befuddled Irish defense search­ing for answers and sent BCS officials scrambling back to meeting rooms.

ESTRUCTION 


USC found every single one of Notre Dame's weaknesses and capitalized on them. The Irish 
couldn't pass, they couldn't run, and they couldn't defend against the Trojans. USC picked up 610 offensive yards -the most of any opponent in Irish history -and managed to hold the Irish to a total of 26 yards in the final three quarters of the game. For Notre Dame, it was worse than not getting it done, they couldn't get it started.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Clapton, a legend on guitar 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Scene Music Critic 
Universally regarded as one of the great­est guitar virtuosos of all time, Eric Oapton has had many opportunities to collaborate with some of the most highly respected musicians in the industry. From his not-so­humble beginnings with the British blues band The Yardbirds, whose lineup would eventually include fellow guitar legends Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, to his more recent solo successes, Clapton has created some of the most emotive rock and blues music throughout his lengthy career. 
After suggesting that the 2001 Reptjle World Tour would be his final large-scale tour, it seemed almost inevitable that Eric Clapton would release an album commem­orating the event. Slowhand did not disap­point loyal fans with the recent release of a two disc live album, One More Car One More Hider. 
Recorded during the Los Angeles and 
Tokyo stops on his tour, One More Car One More Rider includes many favorites from Clapton' s vast catalogue such as "Layla," "Cocaine," "Wonderful Tonight" and "Tears in Heaven," to name just a few. 
Clapton demonstrates the diversity of his guitar and vocal talents throughout the first disc beginning with six straight acoustic songs and finally taking up his trusty electric on "My Father's Eyes." 
Disc 1 contains two songs from his one time collaboration with Derek and the Dominoes, "Key to the Highway" and "Bell Bottom Blues," but mostly consists of songs from his more recent albums, the multi­Grammy winning 1998 solo release Pilgrim and Reptile, Clapton's most recent studio album. 

The second disc, on the other hand. con­tains many of Clapton's earlier rock hits, allowing him to truly wail. It is on this disc that Clapton reclaims "Layla" as a rock classic, despite the huge popularity of the acoustic version from his previous live release. Unplugged. Disc 2 also includes a rockin version of the Cream classic, "Sunshine of Your Love" and proves Oapton's intense devotion to early blues legends, with obvious blues inspiration on "Hoochie Coochie Man" and "Have You Ever Loved a Woman?" Rounding out the set is a lovely rendition of "Over the Rainbow," the theme song from the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz. Clapton pulls off this ballad quite nicely, remembering the forgotten song to his audience. 
Musically. disc 2 is much stronger than the first. It adequately showcases Clapton's blues inspired guitar riffs in ways that the songs of the first disc could not. Parts of the first disc even come across as somewhat easy listening, while disc two is purely rock and blues. 
As the only triple inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of both The Yardbirds and Cream and also as a solo artist, Eric Clapton reveals the vast range of his talent on One More Car One More Rider. Highlighting his immense tal­ent as a guitarist and proving his close ties to the blues, One More Car One More Rider

Sigur Ros, foreign sound from frozen soil 
By RYAN RAFFERTY 
Scene Music Critic 
Not many people have heard the name Sigur Ros mentioned in everyday music conversations, but they are the biggest band to come out of Iceland. While Sigur Ros (Icelandic for "a victory rose") has been popular in Europe for several years. they've only recently gained attention in America. Their debut album in the United States. Agaetis Hyrjun,

Most of the songs start off incredibly soft and slow. and then inevitably crescen­do into a beautiful third track. 


The standout track on ( ) is the fourth track. Known as Njosnaelin, or the Nothing Song, to fans, this track was featured in the movie Vanilla Sky. The song begins with soft timpani pounding out a slow beat, and a guitar played with a cello bow lightly res­onating in the background. The

quickly leaving only an impression of mood rather than melody. The second track, for example, opens with a slow guitar riff over a groan­ing organ. This eventually gives way to Jonsi's aching vocals that can only best be described as the high pitched singing of whales. The song then explodes into a perfect blend ofJonsi's bowed guitar, ritu­alistic drums and haunting strings. Then fourth and fifth tracks. There is an obvi­ous shift in mood and melody on the last four tracks. The first four songs are lighter and have an optimistic feel to them, while the final four songs have a darker feel. The final song, for instance, starts off with a subdued guitar riff that could come from any modern pop song. Sigur Ros puts their signature touch on it, however, with Jonsi's vocals dancing over the thunderous drums and distorted gui­tar. This final track is ( }'s loudest track, but also it's darkest.

Packers beat Bears 30-20 to secure NFC North 
As,ociatcd Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. 
Spectacular touchdown-sav­ing plays by two backups named Walker allowed the Green Bay Packers to win their first division title in five years. 
The Packers won the NFC North by beating the Chicago Bears 30-20 Sunday, despite losing running back Ahman Green to a knee injury after he had produced 123 yards of offense. 
Hookie Tony Fisher, an undraftcd free agent from Nolrc Dame, ran for 91 yards and a Louchdown on 17 carries as the Packers (9-3). who were coming off two straight losses, became the lirst team to clinch a playoff spot and remained the only team without a loss at home. 
They couldn't have done it without rookie receiver Javon Walker. who chased down a cornerback headed for the end zone to prevent the Packers' halftime deficit from reaching 15 points. 
Then nose tackle Rod Walker forced a fumble from the Bears' center on first-and­goal at the Packers' 1 in the third quarter. 
"The Walkers rep-re-sent-ed today!" defensive end Vonnie Holliday said. 
On a cold. windy day at Lambeau Field, Brett Favre threw two second -half touch­down passes and improved to 33-0 at home when the tem­perature is 34 or below. He beat the Bears for the 18th time in 22 tries. 
The Packers trailed 14-6 at halftime after Javon Walker third-string quarterback A.J. ran about 100 yards and Feeley did just enough to help chased down Roosevelt Philadelphia beat the Rams Williams as ho was about to 10-3 Sunday in a rematch of dance into the end zone at the last season's NFC champi­end of the first half. onship game.

Rod Walker timed the snap perfectly, grabbed the ball and pulled it back to his chest, cov­ering up all in one fluid motion. 
"I had a friend who did it all the time in high school, so I thought I might as well try it," Walker said. "I just went directly for the ball." 
Eagles 10, Rams 3 
Backed by a dominant defense, the Philadelphia Eagles proved they can win with their No. 3 quarterback. The St. Louis Rams still haven't won without theirs.

"When we go out and play and there's no letdown in any quarter, there's no team we can't beat," All-Pro safety Brian Dawkins said. 
Feeley, starting his first game since his junior season at Oregon in 1999. completed 14 of 30 passes for 181 yards, and lost one fumble. He played because Donovan McNabb is out with a broken right ankle and Koy Detmer has a dislo­cated left elbow. 
"It felt great. It's been a long time since I played a whole game," said Feeley, who start­ed eight games his junior sea­s on, before getting hurt and losing his job to Joey Harrington. 
Warner, the NFL MVP last season, was 20-for-42 for 218 yards and two interceptions. He also lost a fumble in the first quarter, and lost 9 yards when he dropped the ball on a pump fake.

"I've played in cold weather for a long time now, since high school," said Bledsoe, who grew up and played college football in eastern Washington, and spent his previous nine seasons in New England. "It never has been a real factor as far as throwing the ball. I've got big hands. I can throw the ball." 
Bledsoe finished 15-for-27 for 306 yards, breaking the game open by leading Buffalo on three consecutive touch­down drives in the second half. 
It was a prolific turnaround for a once-sputtering offense that produced 36 points in its previous three outings. It was also a historic performance. 
Buffalo's Eric Moulds, with 130 yards receiving, and Peerless Price, with 93 yards, each surpassed the 1,000 yard receiving mark. Travis Henry with 151 yards rushing, broke the 1,000-yard plateau. It marked the first time three players on the same team have done so in the same game. 
The Bills (6-6) ended a three-game losing streak while jumping back into the AFC East playoff race, inching within a game of the Dolphins (7-5). Miami fell into a tic with the New England Patriots.

end Wesley Walls, who scored 
the game's lone touchdown. 
"That made this one sweet,

satisfying win because of what 
we've been through." 
During the losing streak, Carolina lost four games by three points or fewer and had ·blown fourth-quarter leads in 
all four. 
"A bounce finally went our 
way," said cornerback Reggie 
Howard. 
Like so many of Cleveland's games in the past two seasons, this one had some controversy as officials waved off an apparent go-ahead TD by Browns wide receiver Kevin Johnson with 1 :57 remaining. 
The Browns (6-6) committed five turnovers and quarter­back Tim Couch threw three interceptions, including one on a bobbled ball that Carolina's Emmanuel McDaniel picked off with 1 :45 left. 
"This is a really tough loss because of how much it meant to us," Couch said. "It's tough to take."

"We didn't stay disciplined even when we made that come­back," Marquette coach Tom Crean said. "We used so much energy to come back, I don't think we had anybody th.at could play that many minutes." 
The score could have very easi­ly been much worse. Carroll only connected on 1-of-11 3-point attempts and generally struggled to find the basket all night. 
"We would have definitely had over a hundred," Carroll laughed about how high the score might have been. "It's a great sign when I don't shoot the ball too well and we still score 90 points. That says a lot about our team." 
The Irish held vaunted guard Dwyane Wade, who entered the game averaging 25.3 points, to 19 points on 7-of-19 shooting. Most of Wade's points came 

r 
against Notre Dame's defense. which used a zone for the first half, then switched to man-to­man in the second half. 
Nearly lost in Notre Dame's offensive flurry was the play of freshman Torin Francis. Francis, who struggled against Creighton and only played six minutes, was left to fend for himself down low, as the Irish used a lineup that featured four shooters. But Francis walked away with 13 rebounds. 
"We can make shots," Brey said. "We can put numbers up. We scored 91, but I think some guys thought we should have had more." 
Notes:

Former Irish forward David Graves, now playing with a Nike exhibition team, after a stint with the Chicago Bulls, attended Monday's game. 

Graves' team beat North Carolina, coached by former Irish coach Matt Doherty, in an exhibi­tion a month ago. But Graves broke his thumb about a month ago and hasn't played since, although he said he would be ready to play in a couple of weeks.

When the Irish lost their first game of the season to Creighton a week ago, Brey chastised his team for getting out of its half-court offense. Mistakes Brey saw the Irish make in blowout games early in the season manifested themselves to chew away Notre Dame's unbeaten record. 
So he told the Irish in gener­al, and Thomas in particular, to do what they do best -stay patient, pass the ball around, play unselfishly and wait for the shot to happen. 
"Just go ahead and give it up," Brey remembers telling Thomas earlier in the week. "You're gonna get it back."

Creighton 
because the 
Irish tried to do too little on offense. In try­ing to rally their team, each individual player put the bur­den of responsibility on his shoulders. Thomas failed to create something out of noth­ing. Matt Carroll tried to force 3-pointers. Dan Miller rushed his shots. 
The result was a '1' in the 'L' column. 
Later that week, Brey called the three players into his office for a little conference. With Torin Francis struggling on the inside, Brey essentially told his squad that if they wanted to win. they had to help the other guys and not try to take the game over individually. 
"It wasn't selfishness on the part of Miller, Carroll and Thomas," Brey said. "It was we're young on that front line and [them thinking], 'We have to do it."' 

Notre Dame's strength lies in the play of its perimeter play­ers. Brey looking down his bench resembles an execution­er staring at a table of lethal tools, trying to decide which ones to use. 
When the Irish put Chris Quinn on the floor with Thomas, Carroll and Miller, Notre Dame has a potent group of shooters. The guard­heavy lineup the Irish used successfully against Marquette creates matchup problems on offense. They trade size for speed and run away with the advantage. 
And they take the focus off the post. This early in the season, much is already clear. 
Francis will emerge into a dominant player down low, but he needs time before he's ready to fill Hyan Humphrey's Orlando Magic-sized sneakers. 
If Notre Dame wants to make a run for a Big East title, their perimeter will have to form the foundation while the post is under construction. 
Although the Irish sharp­shooters will carry much of the offensive burden for the Irish, Notre Dame's sophomore point guard has to make solid on­court decisions. Any shooter shoots best when defenders are caught scrambling for position, something created by a fluid halfcourt offense involv­ing the entire team. 
Thomas' points will come no matter what he does. But by involving his teammates, he takes pressure off himself and his teammates at the same time. 
And that, as Monday night showed, will lead to great things for the Irish.

35-20 in the second half. 
"[Success in the second half] was a combination of a lot of things," McGraw said. ''I'm excited because that was a great win on the road against a good team. That's a definite NCAA tournament team. I'm really pleased we were able to pull that out." 
Notre Dame also got a look at how a physical team 
-plays. The Irish 's first win over Cleveland State didn't prepare the team for the kind of game they had against USC. The Trojans bumped the Irish forwards around and their guards hand checked Notre Dame all night. But the experience of playing a team like use should help Notre Dame later in the season. 
"They were really physi­cal," Ratay said. "They real­ly crashed the boards and I think that caused some problems for us and kept them in the game. We haven't seen such an athlete team. I think we'll be ready for it now when we see it again." 
Borton agreed. 
"They play a really intense defense. they over play so it's different than some teams that we play," Borton said. "We had to step it up and counter their pressure defense and look for the backdoor and look what they would give us." 
The Irish have three games left on their current four-game road trip and will travel to Valparaiso to take on the Crusaders Wednesday.

One year after ruining the Soonors' postseason plans with a late touchdown in Norman, Fields and Woods connected for three TDs as Oklahoma State pullud off a 38-28 upset of Oklahoma on Saturday. 
Woods had 12 catches for a school-record 226 yards. while Fields completed 18 of 27 passes for 357 yards and four touch­downs against the nation's ninth-ranked defense. 
"We played our best opponent; we played our best football," CowLoys coach Les Miles said. "Considering all of our big wins this year, this was undoubtedly our best 0110."

All of a sudden, the season doesn't seem so bad for Florida State. 
Taking advantage of his sec­ond chance, Chris Rix ran for 83 yards and threw two touch­downs to Anquan Boldin to help the Seminoles earn their biggest win of the year, 31-14 over Florida on Saturday night. 
"We finally looked like Florida State." a relieved coach Bobby Bowden said. 
Freshman tailback Leon Washington ran for 134 yards. Linebacker Kendyll Pope returned an interception for a touchdown. A week of turmoil melted away with a big post­game celebration, and a season of disappointments took a long­awaited positive turn for the Seminoles (9-4). 
On the other side, Ron Zook had no more luck in his first year than Steve Spurrier did in 12 seasons when it comes to winning at Doak Campbell Stadium. The Gators (8-4) still haven't won in Tallahassee since 1986. 
"I guess the streak continues," Florida offensive lineman Shannon Snell said. 
Florida's hopes grew dim with 10 minutes left in the third quarter when Grossman flipped a pass to tight end Aaron Walker. Walker tipped it into the

hands of Pope, whose 13-yard interception return gave the Seminoles a 24-6 lead. 
A little later, Grossman, who finished with 303 yards, led the Gators on an 84-yard touch­down drive to cut the deficit to 
10. 
But Rix and Boldin answered with what might have been Florida State's best drive of the season. They connected for a 26-yard gain and for a 19-yard touchdown as part of an 80-yard drive that made the score 31-14 and turned the rest of the night into a Seminole celebration. 
It was an odd combination, considering Boldin was in McPherson's corner when Rix struggled earlier this season and several Seminoles were calling for a change. 
Arkansas 21, LSU 20 
Now LSU knows how it feels to lose on the last pass of the game, too. 
Matt Jones threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to DeCori Birmingham with 9 seconds left, and David Carlton made a long extra point to give Arkansas a 21-20 victory over the Tigers on Friday. 

The ending was nearly as stunning as LSU's win over Kentucky on Nov. 9, when Devery Henderson caught a 75­yard touchdown pass on the game's final play for a 33-30 victory. 
Arkansas scored twice in the last half of the fourth quarter to win the SEC's West Division title and advance to the conference title game against Georgia next Saturday in Atlanta. 
Trailing· 20-14 with 34 sec­onds left, the Razorbacks (9-3, 5-3 SEC) got the ball at their 19. Jones completed a 50-yard pass to Richard Smith on the first play. 
After an incompletion from the LSU 31, Jones found Birmingham in the back right corner of the end zone. The sophomore slipped behind Randall Gay and outleaped him for the ball. LSU's Travis Daniels was too late to break up the pass. 
"It was a triple post route and Matt threw it deep in the end zone and I just jumped up and made the catch," said Birmingham, who had only 14 receptions coming into the game. "I kind of gave (Gay) a lit­tle stick to make him think I was running a much shallower route. He bit for it so we went a little deeper." 

Arkansas was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration, however, setting up a 35-yard extra point. Carlton's kick was plenty long enough, but it curved left and was barely good. 
Randall. who came off the bench in a 14-13 win over Ole Miss last week, completed four of six passes on the opening drive. Green caught his second pass of the season on a wide­receiver screen, and he turned it into a 67-yard touchdown with 
6:44 left in the first quarter. 
Jones tried to throw the ball where Smith could catch it in the back of the end zone, but Webster stepped in for his SEC­leading seven th interception. Arkansas made six first downs on the drive, which lasted 17 plays and took 8:10 off the clock. 
Arkansas responded by hold­ing LSU to three plays, and a 10­yard punt return by Birmingham gave the Razorbacks their best field posi­tion of the game at the Tigers 47. 
LSU didn't allow Arkansas to take advantage of that either, holding on three plays and forc­ing the Hazorbacks' third punt of the half. 
The Tigers took over at the 10 with 3:18 remaining and drove 58 yards in 10 plays to set up Corbcllo's 49-yard field goal on the last play of the half for a 10­0 lead.

Aggies, Huskers, Cardinals fire coaches 
. Solcum fired after 6-6 season at Texas A&M 
Associated Press 
COLLEGE STATION. Texas 

Texas A&M head coach R.C. Slocum, the winningest coach in Texas A&M history, was fired Monday after the Aggies went a disappointing 6-6 in the regular season, capped by a 50-20 loss to Texas. 
During his 14-year tenure as head coach, Slocum's 123 career wins were the most in school history. 
But A&M fans were disap­pointed that the Aggies have become less competitive in the Big 12 South -their 3-5 finish was their first losing record in league play since 1984. 
"It was with great sadness and disappointment that I learned today that I was being fired as the head football coach at Texas A&M," Slocum said in a prepared statement. 
"We had a season where we lost several close games that could have gone either way and no one was more disappointed than me with our record. However, we have some really outstanding young players and 1felt our future was bright," he said. 
In a statement, the school said A&M President Robert M. Gates asked Slocum to step down as head football coach Monday and assume the role of special adviser to the president. 
"Coach Slocum is one of the most respected and admired members of the Aggie family, and he has much still to offer the university he has served so long with rare integrity and skill," Gates said. 
Slocum, 58, was in the fourth year of a seven-year deal he signed in 1999 worth $1 million annually, including a base salary of $300,000. 
The rest of the package was to come from radio and televi­sion programs, a housing allowance, cars, a country club membership and shoe contract. 
Slocum leaves after a 6-6 sea­son that matched his worst 
. Lynch let go after unsuccessful tenure at Ball State 
Associated Press 
MUNCIE, Ind. 

Bill Lynch was fired as Ball State's football coach Monday after producing only two win­ning seasons in his eight years at the school. 
He will be reassigned to an unspecified job within the uni­versity for the final year of his contract, athletic director Bubba Cunningham said. 
Lynch had a 37-53 record at Ball State, with his only win­ning seasons coming in his first two years. The Cardinals lost 21 straight games in 1998-00, which at the time was the nation's longest losing streak. 
Ball State finished 6-6 this season after Saturday's 38-14 loss to Marshall. 
"Bill has brought in good students and good people," said Cunningham, who 
with the Aggies. A&M last post­ed a 6-6 record in 1996. 
He won four conference championships, including the Big 12 title in 1998. His overall record was 123-47-2. 
Slocum told players of the fir­ing at a team meeting earlier Monday. 
'Tm disappointed. He's a great guy and a great football coach and I hate to see that happen to him," senior line­backer Brian Gamble said. "The guy has been a father fig­ure for me for four, almost five years. To see him go is really disheartening." 
Slocum had to deal with his share of tragedy. Last week, freshman defensive lineman Brandon Fails died after col­lapsing in his dorm. He was the third Aggies player to die dur­ing his tenure. 
And in 1999, the campus was stunned when the log stack for the university's traditional bon­fire collapsed and killed 12 people and injured 27. That year, Texas A&M rallied in the second half for a 20-16 victory. 
Since a 30-26 win over then No. 1 Oklahoma, the Aggies lost in double overtime to Missouri, and closed the regular season with a loss to Texas. 
"Although disappointed with Dr. Gates' decision, I do recog­nize that the university has the right to decide who coaches the team," Slocum said. "I have spent 30 years of my life here and have deep feelings for Aggieland. I will cherish the memories of my many relation ­ships over the years with the students and former students of this university." 
Slocum had been a part of A&M's football operations all but one year since 1972, when he joined Emory Bellard's A&M staff as offensive end coach. 
Slocum was named A&M's defensive coordinator under Tom Wilson in 1979. In 1981, he left to be defensive coordi­nator at Southern California but returned to A&M the fol­lowing year when Jackie Sherrill became the Aggies' new coach. 
Slocum succeeded Sherrill in 1988. 
became athletic director in August. "However, we also expect to excel on the field. We have not achieved the suc­cess we had hoped we would." 
Telephone messages were left at Lynch's home and office. 
In 2001, the Cardinals fin­ished 5-6 overall and 4-1 in the Mid-American Conference West for a share of the divi­sion championship. Former athletic director Andrea Seger announced at the time that Lynch's contract would be extended to January 2004.

. Solich cuts 3 assistants, looks for new defensive coordinator 
Associated Press 
LINCOLN, Neb. 
Nebraska coach Frank Solich fired three of his defensive assistants and said Monday that he no longer will call the team's offensive plays. 
Defensive coordinator Craig Bohl, secondary coach George Darlington and rush ends coach Nelson Barnes were let go. 
The announcement came three days after the Cornhuskers finished their worst regular season in 41 years. With a 7-6 record, Nebraska barely became eli­gible for a postseason bowl game. 
Solich said he has not decided who will take his spot as offensive coordinator. Solich, like his predecessor Tom Osborne, had served in that role while also head coach. 
"We are taking the neces­sary steps to get this program turned back around," Solich said. 
He said hiring a new defen­sive coordinator is his top pri­ority. 
Solich said defensive line coach Jeff Jamrog and gradu­ate assistant Jimmy Burrow will handle the defensive game plan for the Cornhuskers' upcoming bowl game. Nebraska will accept a bowl invitation for an NCAA-record 34th straight year, probably to the Dec. 27 Mainstay Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La., against an opponent from the SEC. 

The university will honor all terms of the fired coaches' contracts, which run until June 30, 2004, and pay a combined $525,356. Bohl will receive $207,600, Darlington $179,120, and Barnes $138,6%. 
"We made some changes today that we think are in the best interest of the University of Nebraska, and I want you to know I support Frank Solich completely on those," repeatedly this season that he does not plan to retire. 
"To have been a part of one of the most dominant and respected programs in the history of the sport fulfills a boyhood dream," Darlington said. 
Bohl, who played for Nebraska from 1977-79, was promoted to defensive coordi­nator in 2000 after five years as the team's linebackers coach. He did not return a message left on bis phone by The Associated Press. 
Barnes, a former defensive line coach at Texas, had been Nebraska's rush ends coach 

athletic director Bill Byrne said. "We are taking the "We need to

easy. 

"I appreciate that these coaches have dedicated them­selves to this profession and this program, but we feel we need to move forward at this time," Solich said. 
Darlington was a Nebraska assistant for 30 years. Hired in 1973 in Osborne's first year as head coach, Darlington worked most of his career alongside Solich, who was an NU assistant for 19 years before being pro­moted to head coach in 1998. 
Darlington said Monday that he has enjoyed his career at Nebraska. He has said to Colorado near the end of last season. They gave up an average of 35 points in losses to four opponents ranked in the AP Top 25 this year. 
"The coaches can only do so much," rush end Trevor Johnson said. "Some changes needed to occur.... I think change is going to help us." 
Solich was one of only a dozen Division I-A head coaches who also served as offensive coordinator. The Huskers' offense has been criticized this season for being one-dimensional and lacking the physical power of past squads.

MENS SOCCER 
Hoosiers end Irish season with 1-0 victory 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Sports W ricer 
One trend this season for the Notre Dame mens soccer team was rather odd: In its two pre­vious games this season in which a player was ejected for receiving a red card. the eject­ed player's team -in both cases. not the Irish -won the game. 
That streak was broken Wednesday night, as the ejec­tion of Irish midfielder Justin Ratcliffe with 27 minutes remaining forced the Irish, already trailing to Indiana 1-0, to play 10-on-11. 
The Irish were unable to overcome both deficits, and fell to the Hoosiers in the seco.nd round of the NCAA Tournament in Bloomington. 
"I thought it was a very com­petitive game," said Notre Dame head coach Bobby Clark. "We are very disappointed, because I thought we con­trolled large parts of the game." 
The Irish seemed to control much of the early part of the first half of the match. culmi­nating in a scoring opportunity by midfielder Kevin Goldthwaite that went just wide, as well as an 18-yard shot by midfielder Greg Martin that was just barely saved on a dive by Indiana goalie Jay Nolly. 
However, after this early stretch that saw the Irish defense hold the Hoosiers without a shot, the Irish offense fell silent for a long stretch that lasted well into the second half. 
Indiana finally got onto the scoreboard at the 51:03 mark, as midfielder Ned Grabavoy knocked a lead pass to ·Brian Plotkin standing at the edge of its offensive penalty area. Plotkin -the Big Ten's Rookie of the Year -chipped a shot over charging Irish goalie Chris Sawyer to put the Hoosiers ahead. 
The goal was Plotkin's first of the season. 
"It was almost like a slap in the face to dominate a team like that and not come out with a victory," Sawyer said. "If we can take anything out of it, we can feel good about the way we played. But I know this team expected to go further." 
The Irish then became more aggressive on the offensive side of the ball, which led to the red card on Ratcliffe. With 
27:37 left, Ratcliffe was ejected for a hard tackle on the Irish offensive side of the field, and the Irish were forced to play a man down for the rest of the game. 
"He's an incredibly passion­ate player and we all realized he was just doing everything he could to help the team and it just didn't go in his favor," Sawyer said. "We really admired his passion all season so you really got to hand it to the kid and feel for him after a game like that." 
Without its senior captain at midfield, the Irish struggled, yet still managed some late scoring attempts. In the 89th minute, defender Jack Stewart led a late charge deep into Indiana's end of the field and booted a solid shot that sailed just wide of the net. 
With the victory, the Hoosiers advanced to the

. Irish face College of Charleston in first round Saturday 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Writer 

After winning its third con­secutive Big East Conference Tournament championship Nov. 24, the Irish were rewarded over the weekend by being named a host of the lirsl and second rounds of Lhe NCAA Tournament. 16th­seeded Notre Dame (23-7) will play College of Charleston (29-5) Saturday at 6 p.m. 
The College of Charleston won lhe Southern Conference and is making its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament. The Irish have never faced the Cougars. 
The Cougars have won 22 straight matches -the sec­ond longest active streak in the country. 
The Irish are currently on a 
35-game winning streak at 
home. including a win over 
ninth-seeded Pepperdine on 
Sept. 14. 
Notre Dame last hosted a 
NCAA Tournament game in 
1996 losing to Ohio State in 
the second round after 
dcfeating llofstra in the first 
round. 
Overall. the Irish are 8-1 at 
home in the NCAA 
Tournament. 
The Irish enter the NCAA Tournament after sweeping Miami and Connecticut in the semifinals and finals of the Big East Tournament. respec­tively, en rouie to earning an automatic bid. 
The Irish won their seventh conference title overall. 
Michigan State (19-11) and George Mason (22-7) will play in the first semifinal Saturday at 4 p.m. 
The Spartans are partici­pating in their ninth straight NCAA Tournament and fin­ished fifth in the Big Ten. George Mason won the Colonial Athletic Association and has not qualified for the NCAA Tournament since 1996. The Patriots and Spartans have never played each other. 
Saturday's winners will play at 4 p.m. on Sunday. The winner of that game should face number one seed USC in the regional semifinals next weekend. 
In last season's NCAA Tournament, Notre Dame was eliminated in the first round by Michigan State 3-1. 
The Irish have not

. Irish knock off No. 10 Marquette with 92-71 win 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sport, W ricer 
When the Irish basketball team walked in to the locker room before Notre Dame played No. 10 Marquette Monday night, they noticed a small surprise waiting for them in their lockers. 
Printed on a sign hanging from their lockers, Irish players saw a list of all the ranked teams that ha.d fallen this season with the score after each game. At the bot­tom of the list, Notre Dame and Marquette was printed with question marks taking the places of scores. 
It didn't take the Irish long to turn those question marks into exclamation points. 
Behind 32 points from Chris Thomas and a 50 percent shoot­ing performance from the field, the renewal of the Notre Dame­Marquette rivalry quickly turned into a blowout as the Irish humili­ated the Golden Eagles 92-71 on national television. 
... "Quite frankly, what do rank­ings mean right now?" Irish coach Mike Brey asked after the game. "I don't really know. I put all of the so-called upsets up. Why not us?" Why not Notre Dame, indeed. Less than a week after the Irish lost their first game of the season to Creighton, a game Brey said the Irish walked away from con­vinced they had to adjust their style of play, Notre Dame put on 
their most impressive offensive output of the young season in a renewal of one of the school's fiercest rivalries. 
The Irish used a strong half­court game to spread the ball around the perimeter, and they played a lineup that included Thomas, Matt Carroll, Dan Miller, Torin Francis and Chris Quinn to spread the Golden Eagles' defense out. 
The result an Irish shooting clinic put on for the benefit of Golden Eagles. Miller finished with 20 points, Carroll had 14, Quinn had 12 and Francis had 11. 
"We got tons of open looks," said Thomas, who also finished with 10 assists. "You give our team tons of open looks, we'll make most ofthem." 
With the score tied at 11, the Irish reeled off seven unanswered points to take a 18-11 lead. After the Golden Eagles scored a lay­up, the Irish proceeded to score on 11 of their next 14 offensive possessions, turning a tight game into a 42-26 blowout. 
Marquette didn't back down. Slowly but surely, they chipped away at Notre Dame's lead. Finally, when Chris Thomas picked up his fourth foul with 
9:28 left and Travis Diener made both free throws, the Golden Eagles had closed the margin to 67-63. 
But that was as close as the vis­itors would get. Keyed by a trio of Thomas 3-pointers, the Irish went on a 25-8 run to close out the Golden Eagles. 
see MEN/page 16 


. Thomas' 32 points key balanced attack 
Marquette had just cut a 16­point deficit to four points. The Golden Eagles couldn't miss a shot. Chris Thomas had just picked up his fourth foul. And more than nine min­utes remained. 
Yet Mike Brey didn't think about pulling his sensational sophomore for a sec­ond. 
Sure, Notre Dame's Sports Writer point guard had picked up four points and three fouls in a seven-minute span in the sec­ond half. 
But Brey figured that Thomas had played enough basketball to know how to play with four fouls. 
"I thought in the back of my mind that I had to stay in the game for us to win," Thomas said. 
Flash forward seven more minutes. 
Thomas, who had only left the game for a minute's rest, dribbled the ball around the perimeter, trying to kill time. As the shot clock wound down,
