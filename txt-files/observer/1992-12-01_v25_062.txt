The holidays are approaching and, con­


sidering how much Jennifer Guerin anticipation Thanksgiv-Asst. Accent Editor ing sent through your burnt-out brain cells, ________ they couldn't get here sooner. Considering all the work you have to do, however, those burnt-out brain cells are wishing an eternity would gracefully interject itself between now and December 19, allowing you time to salvage both your sanity and your precious academic career. 
"Let's face it," you might be inclined to say. "I don't have time to think, never mind care, about anything but schoolwork." And so you proceed through your days under the dismal South Bend skies patting yourself on the back i you complete your reading and finish your assignments more than 15 minutes before class. 
Now, engage in this thought experiment . 
For just a moment, reconsider the priorities of your little college world. Wake up tomorrow and instead of cursing your workload, be thankful you're alive. Be thankful you have a place to sleep and food to eat. Be thankful, as depressing as it may seem, that your family is not engaged in a bloody battle to save its homeland from being torn apart by religious and ethnic conflict. 
We are a generation bombarded with so many images that we find it difficult to sift through them to find what is true. Unable (or unwilling?) to spend the time to resolve the world into its many, distinct units, we start "udging the state of the world by a few stark headlines we glance at in passing by the stack of newspapers that we don't have time to read. 
Considering the gravity of most of today's international news stories, it is tempting to ignore them for the sake of maintaining personal happiness. Considering the size and population of the United States, it is difficult to know what is happening in each state, never mind the rest of the world. 
But living in a big country is no excuse for living in a small world. 
To say our generation lives in a bubble would be both callous and inaccurate. But many o us have been lulled into the addictive rhythm o college life. 
Denying the existence of the world's problems is an insult to both our intelligence and our compassion. By better informing ourselves o national and international affairs, we will realize that our own personal and academic struggles are miniscule compared to the struggles of our brothers and sisters around the world. 
Academics shouldn't be placed on the back burner for the sake of reading a newspaper., but we must find time to educate ourselves, manage our busy schedules and make time for the rest of the world. We can personally audit the class of life, which consists of no papers or tests. The only pre-requisite is an open mind and you will lose some of that academic stress by realizing that millions of people out there have more to worry about than how to get through final exams.

NATIONAL Clinton to court freshmen lawmakers 
SUMMERLAND, Calif. -President­
elect Clinton is considering a trip to Washington next week to court freshmen lawmakers who could help him push through a quick-action agenda in Congress. Clinton's trip would probably come early next week amid House organizational meetings, said a senior Clinton aide, who spoke 

on condition of anonymity. During his campaign, Clinton pledged to take sweeping legislative proposals to Congress within 100 days of taking office. He is expected to turn to the House's huge freshman class-there will be 110 new representatives next year -for help in getting his jobs, education and health care plans through. House freshmen are potential allies to Clinton because many of them were voted in on a call for change, just like he was.

Special to The Observer 
A Notre Dame Law School trial team took fourth place at the Cathy Bennett National Criminal Trial Competition in Newport, R.I., Nov. 5-7. 
The team of third year law students Mary Yu, Brian Alexander. Charles Rose and second year law student An­drea Roberts beat eight other law schools to take fourth place. They were coached by Adjunct Assistant Professor Sanford Brook, Adjunct Professor Jeanne Jourdan and lawyers Wendall Walsh, Paul Perralta, Barb Brook, Jennine Gozdecki and Joan Koros. 

The competition, hosted each year by the Washington, D.C.­based National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), involved a three-and­a-half hour mock trial on fed­eral drug conspiracy charges. 
In each round of the competi­tion, team members presented opening and closing arguments, examined and cross-examined witnesses, introduced physical evidence and argued objections and pretrial motions. 
The ND team tried the case four times in two-and-a-half

AIDS test prompts talk between student pairs 
.LOS ANGELES (AP) -Edu­cation alone fails to make col­lege students ask prospective lovers about AIDS, but adding an AIDS test gets their attention and makes such discussions almost twice as likely, says a study released Monday. 
But despite increased will­ingness to ask partners if they were infected, almost two­thirds of the students in the study still didn't use condoms, the researchers found. 
The findings suggest that when doctors teach patients about AIDS, they also should offer voluntary tests for the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes the disease, said Dr. Neil Wenger, chief author of the study at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
Education and AIDS tests combined "should be central to public health interventions to stop the spread of HIV," Wenger and his colleagues write in Tuesday's issue of An­nals of Internal Medicine. 
But the results "in no way support the concept of manda­tory testing in any population," they added. 
The study is important be­
cause it shows that taking an AIDS test can make people more likely to ask if their lovers are infected, just like showing patients their chest X-rays reinforced anti-smoking messages, said Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
"Sadly, however, we see how difficult it is to get people to wear condoms when having sex," Silverman said by phone from San Francisco. 
Wenger and his co-authors said that might be interpreted as a failure of AIDS education. But they noted that sexual activity among the students was fairly low, few had multiple lovers and asking if a potential lover carries the AIDS virus "may be more important than the sexual activities engaged in with that partner." 
The researchers warned, however, that lovers may lie about their AIDS risk, and that "the unaware might be lulled into unprotected sexual behav­iors by unscrupulous partners." 
AIDS, which kills by crippling the body's ability to fight other diseases, is spread during sex, and by sharing contaminated needles. 
HIV-infected man sentenced for having unprotected sex 

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -A man convicted of attempted murder for knowingly exposing a 17-year-old girl to the AIDS virus was sentenced today to 
ROME June 13 ~July 12 Travel in France, Germany, and Switzerland 
consecutive 16-month terms for giving the girl marijuana. 
The case was seen as a test of the use of existing laws to prosecute those who knowingly or deliberately expose others to HIV at a time when many states have passed or are considering laws specifically to cover that situation.  
Before sentencing, Gonzalez complained about his convic­tion. "I feel it was an extreme ra­cial vendetta from ... " he said, pointing to the prosecutor and a police detective. "I was a guinea pig. The first time, why not?" Haggerty, who said he was unsure if Gonzalez would be medically capable of serving his entire term, said there was no racial or judicial prejudice involved. Jurors deliberated for about 7 1/2 hours over two days before 
reaching  their  verdict  
Wednesday evening.  
Deputy  District Attorney  

David Peters successfully ar­gued that Gonzalez, who did not warn the girl he was in­fected, was a danger to society. 
Defense attorney Karolyn March said she believed the conviction was racially moti­vated. The prosecution has a lynch-mob met:ttality, she said, and "the criminal justice sys­tem is not the area for a public health issue."

Tsongas confirms cancer Somalia 
BOSTON (AP) -Former Democratic presidential candi­date Paul Tsongas, who has twice battled cancer, confirmed Monday a new growth in his abdomen is cancerous. 
"That's the bad news," Tsongas, 51, said at a news conference. "The good news is that it's contained." 
The former U.S. senator said he will undergo chemotherapy and radiation treatment as early as Thursday, and that those measures should effec­tively remove the cancer, which he identified as large­cell lymphoma. 
"Now, is this the last one they'll ever find?" he asked. "Who knows?"

Tsongas ended his Senate career in 1984 after he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. His condition worsened despite conventional treatment, and he underwent an experimental operation in July 1986 in which some bone marrow was removed and treated to kill the cancer cells. 
Doctors also removed a lymph node that was found to have lymphoma from Tsongas' armpit in 1987. 
He said it was unclear if the latest growth is a recurrence of the earlier episodes. 
Tsongas said he was relieved to learn that the newest growth, discovered near his pancreas, was not pancreatic

AND RECEM A COMPLIMENTARY SMALL SOFf DRINK OR COFFEE 

Tuesday, December 1, 1992 The Observer page o Disciplinary action sought for eight involved in firing missile at Turkish 

WASHINGTON (AP) -Top Navy officials have recom­mended that the captain of the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga and seven other officers and sailors face disciplinary action for the missile firing last month that killed five Turkish sailors, military sources said Monday. 
The recommendation for the men, including Capt. James Drager, is short of a court­martial but serious enough to effectively end their careers, several sources said. All spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
Drager was considered one of the Navy's top stars, and was the first helicopter pilot to have been named commander of an aircraft carrier. 
The recommendation is ex­pected to be made public Tues­day when the Navy releases its report in Naples, Italy, on the Oct. 1 accident. 
Two Sea Sparrow missiles were launched from the carrier and one struck the Turkish ship Muavenet during a NATO exercise in the Aegean Sea. The Muavenet's commanding officer was among those killed, and 18 crewmen were injured. 
One senior military source said the report, endorsed by Adm. Henry Mauz, the com­
mander of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet, says five of the Saratoga's most senior officers and three enlisted men should face "mast" procedures, which are non-judicial hearings through which punishment is meted out under the Navy's disciplinary system. 
Such punishments usually do not call for reduction in rank or pay, but more often take the form of official letters of repri­mand. After such disciplinary procedures, promotion is un­likely and officers or senior en­listed men or women generally leave the service. 
Killer of Exxon president gets life sentence 
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -A former policeman who killed an Exxon executive in a botched $18.5 million kidnapping plot to finance a lavish lifestyle was sentenced Monday to life in prison. 
Arthur Seale received a maximum 95-year sentence for federal charges. Seale, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping and killing Exxon International President Sidney Reso, was denied any chance of parole. 
U.S. District Judge Garrett Brown Jr. also fined him $1.75 million, although the defense said there was little chance Seale could pay anything. 
Hours later, a judge in Mor­ristown ordered a life sentence with a minimum of 30 years before parole on a state charge of felony murder, or causing

death in the commission of another felony. Judge Reginald Stanton also imposed a 15-to 30-year sentence for kidnap­ping. 
Seale will serve his federal sentence first. He would enter state prison only if he were re­leased from federal custody. 
Reso, 57, was shot in the arm during the April 29 kidnapping outside his Morris Township 
home, then kept handcuffed, bound and gagged in a box in a storage vault. He died May 3, and Seale and his wife, Irene, buried him in a shallow grave in Bass River State Park.

One arrested in fire-bombing 
BONN, Germany (AP) ­Pressing a crackdown on right­wing extremists, federal au­thorities said Monday they have arrested a 19-year-old youth on suspicion of murder in the fire­bombing deaths of a Turkish woman and two girls. 
The chief federal prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl, said at least one other person was be­ing sought in the attack that shocked the nation a week ago. 
The firebombing of the women's home in Moelln, near Hamburg, was the most brutal of nearly 1,800 rightist attacks that have killed 16 people this year. 
It triggered an international outcry over neo-Nazism in Germany and apparently spurred the government to step up actions against extremists in an effort to deflect criticism that violence is escalating out of control. 
Despite a parade of promises from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other officials to crush right-wing violence, young thugs staged a series of attacks on foreigners over the weekend. Rightists blame an influx of foreigners for Germany's 
Militant black group claims responsibility for club raid 
KING WILLIAM'S TOWN, South Africa (AP) -A radical black group claimed responsi­bility Monday for a hit-and-run raid on a country club Christ­mas party, the worst attack on white civilians in South Africa 

since the 1980s. 
The attack Saturday night, which left four dead and some 20 wounded, has shocked the country's 5 million whites, who have lived in fear of blacks for generations. 
Black and white politicians quickly reaffirmed their inten­tions to press ahead with efforts to stop the violence. 
But the raid was a startling remainder that even tranquil backwaters such as King William's Town, a tidy place of wide, tree-lined avenues and Colonial-style houses, are not immune from the country's po­litical tumult. 
Some survivors said the as­sailants smiled as they rolled grenades into the dining hall and then mowed down middle­aged and elderly diners with automatic gunfire. Blood, wine, and food covered the dining hall at the King William's Town Golf Club, which was being used for a Christmas dinner and wine­tasting party. 
struggling economy, particu­larly the depression that has gripped eastern regions since reunification. 
A statement from Stahl said the 19-year-old, identified as Lars C., was detained Saturday and formally arrested Sunday on suspicion of murder, at­tempted murder and breach of the peace in connection with the arson attack in his home­town of Moelln. Formal charges had not been filed. 
Stahl's office in Karlsruhe said that a witness reported seeing the suspect at the scene, but that the teenager denied involvement. 
ARD national television iden­tified the suspect in a late newscast as Lars Christiansen. Residents of Moelln confirmed the name, and described Christiansen as a quiet teenager who kept to himself. 
"He did at times wear combat boots and had very short blond hair, but as a teacher I cannot immediately judge him to be a skinhead or neo-Nazi because of that," said Gerd Klemske, who said he had taught Christiansen. 
The prosecutor said another

person, whose identity had not been determined, was being sought in the killings. 
Last week, Stahl's office de­tained Michael Peters, leader of a radical rightist group, and eight followers for possible in­volvement in three arson at­tacks in northern Germany in September. No one was injured in those attacks. 
1\vo more suspected members of the group were detained over the weekend in connection with the September attacks, the office said Monday. 
Prosecutors had said they would investigate whether Peters' group was involved in the Moelln deaths, but the office said Monday that no evidence had been turned up to link any of the 11 to that attack. 
President Richard von Weizsaecker and Foreign Min­ister Klaus Kinkel met in Bonn on Monday with a delegation from Turkey to discuss the Moelln firebombing. 
Turkey has expressed great concern about the attack, and tensions are high among the 1.6 million Turks living in Germany.

Job outlook expected to improve 

NEW YORK (AP) -The domestic job outlook is expected to improve in the first quarter of 1993, suggesting an end to two years of workforce decline, Manpower Inc. said in a sur­vey. 
The Milwaukee-based temporary employment service said Sunday that 17 percent of surveyed companies plan to increase their workforce in the January-March period, while 13 percent plan staff reductions. That translates to a net gain of 4 percentage points, unadjusted for seasonal differences. 
Adjusted for seasonal factors, job creation is expected to grow by 12 percentage points in the first quarter, compared with 9 percentage points in the fourth and first quarters of 1992. 
Seasonally adjusted figures are considered more useful for tracking overall employment trends. 
"This indicates a halt to workforce attrition that has plagued the economy for the past two years," Manpower said in a statement. 
The projections were part of Manpower's quarterly survey on employment trends. The survey, in its sixteenth year, is based on telephone interviews with more than 15,000 public and private employers in 468 
U.S. cities. 

Quarterly job growth peaked with a seasonally adjusted net gain of 20 percentage points in the first quarter of 1988 and began trending downward in the third quarter of 1989, according to Manpower surveys. Growth is expected to return in next year's first quarter to levels not seen since the last half of the high-growth 1980's. 
About 67 percent of companies surveyed said they did not plan any changes in their workforce size, while 3 percent said they did not know whether they would make changes. 
Some industries, such as construction and wholesale and retail firms, normally experience a seasonal decline in new jobs in the first quarter. But the projections for the coming quarter were less negative than usual, Manpower said. 
Wholesale and retail companies, which typically announce layoffs after the holidays, predicted a gain of 15 percentage points, up from 12 percentage po_ints in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, the construction trade predicted a seasonally adjusted gain of 15 percentage points, up from 9 percentage points. 
Service firms projected a seasonally adjusted gain of 14 percentage points, up from 13 percentage points in the year-ago quarter. 
Manufacturing firms continued to strengthen from levels early this year. Non-durable-goods manufacturers 
Interest rates on student loan payments to be reduced 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The nation's largest provider of college student loans unveiled a program Monday that will re­duce interest payments for certain borrowers who pay their monthly installments on time. 
The program, called Great Rewards, "is a whole new concept in education lending.... It rewards good repayment habits," said Lydia Marshall, senior vice president of the Student Loan Marketing Association. 
"Good borrowers save us time, and they save us money" because the association, known as Sallie Mae, can avoid collection procedures, such as overdue notices and telephone calls. "The savings will be passed back to the good borrowers." 
Sallie Mae is a publicly held, federally chartered financial services corporation that buys education loans from banks and other lending institutions. It owns more than $20 billion in federally insured student loans, which amounts to one in three of all such outstanding loans today. 
Under the program, 2 percentage points would be shaved from the interest rate on a borrower's loan if payments are made on time for the first 48 months, Marshall said. The program is limited to Stafford loans, the most common type of student loan under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. 
A typical borrower with $5,000 in Stafford loans would save $246 over the life of the loan, which is usually 10 years. A borrower with $23,000 in loans -which becomes the undergraduate borrowing limit for Stafford loans in July-would save more than $1,100 in interest payments. 
The first group of students who would benefit by the new program typically have loans with an interest·rate of 8 percent in the first four years and 10 percent thereafter, Marshall said. Under the program, on-time payments for the first four years would cut the interest rate for the following years by 2 percentage points, to 8 percent, she said. 
Tougher worker safety enforcement needed 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Two months ago, two steel workers died when they were overcome by fumes at a plant in Texas. Labor unions say a pending federal safety standard, pro­posed years ago, could have saved their lives. 
Now, with Bill Clinton's help, the unions may get the work­place rules and enforcement they have long sought. 
With a new administration, "there is going to be a more positive atmosphere" on the is­sue of workplace safety, pre­dicts Bill Borwegen, safety di­rector of the Service Employees International Union. 
Accused of foot dragging through two Republican admin­istrations, the Occupational Safety and Health Administra­tion is likely to speed up the adoption of regulations to pre­vent job-related accidents and worker exposure to toxic chemicals, union officials and safety experts say. 
OSHA says it plans to issue one long-awaited standard by Jan. 1 that would protecfwork­ers entering confined spaces. But it should have been adopted years ago when it was first proposed, said Michael Wright, safety director of the United Steel Workers of America. 
It's not costly and don't re­

quire a lot of expensive tech­nology, Wright said. 
He insisted that if the standard had been on the books, Everett Burkette and Homer White Jr. might still be alive. They were killed Sept. 29 at the Lone Star Steel plant in Lone Star. 
The new administration also is expected to reduce the power of the Office of Management and Budget to delay or derail new regulations. 
Under the Reagan and Bush administrations, "the OMB process is a way to ensure that regulation don't get issued," said David Vladeck, an attorney

for Public Citizen, a non-parti­san group that has challenged Republican regulatory policies. 
"I don't think Clinton is so hostile to regulation that he is going to set up a system that is going to defeat them." 
Clinton campaigned on a platform plank of tougher en­forcement of the federal job safety law to protect workers from hazards that cause more than 10,000 accidental deaths every year. 
The president-elect has en­dorsed the concepts behind legislation to give OSHA more power that was approved this year by the labor committees in the House and Senate. 
predicted a gain of 14 percentage points in the first quarter, up from a gain of 12 percentage points in the year-ago quarter, while durable­goods manufacturers projected a seasonally adjusted gain of 13 percentage points, up from a gain of 8 percentage points. 
Durable goods are manufactured items expected to last at least three 
years,  including  consumer  
appliances,  aircraft  and  other  
expensive products.  

The finance, insurance and real estate industries are pulling out of a deep slump, projecting a seasonally adjusted gain of 11 percentage points, compared with 4 percentage points a year ago. 
The survey showed widely disparate results on a geographic basis. Firms in the South anticipated the best growth, with a seasonally adjusted gain of 14 percentage points. 
The Northeast, although still hurting for new hiring activity, projected a seasonally adjusted gain of 9 percentage points. 
The Midwest showed trends about even with the national average, at a 14-percentage-point seasonally adjusted gain. 
However, recovery appears distant among businesses in the West, where respondents projected a seasonally adjusted gain of 7 percentage points. 
GM begins 'lend-a-plant' program 
DETROIT (AP) -General Motors Corp. is lending some of its laid-off workers and unused factory space to suppliers as a way to recover a portion of its investment in people and excess capacity. 
A deal with Android Indus­tries Inc. is the first result of what GM calls its strategic in­sourcing program, GM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said Monday. 
GM is providing 20 laid-off workers and part of its Coldwater Road plant in Flint, Mich. to Android, which makes internal mechanisms that raise and lower windows in car doors. 
The plant, part of GM's In­land Fisher Guide division, has about 1,200 workers. It makes window regulators and door hinges for many GM models. 
"We are trying to come up with a variety of creative ways to use our people and our under-utilized plants," Simonetti said. "This is not meant to spare idled plants or those that will be idled." 
GM is in the process of cut­ting 74,000 jobs and closing 21 plants by 1995, part of a downsizing to turn the automaker into a smaller and more nimble player in the industry it once dominated. 
GM is expected to announce the remaining seven of 21 plants it has targeted for clos­ing, after next Monday's board meeting in New York. 
The lend-a-plant idea was developed by J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The Pope is 'truly a man of peace' 
Can Hoosier hospitality be brought to Big Apple? 
Dear Editor: 
As I was reading the guest column by Kurt Mills on Nov. 23, it occurred to me that many Notre Dame students may be unfamiliar with Pope John Paul II, his writings, and his life. It is easy to allow the popular media to form our image of this man who has indeed changed the world. 
Those who would like to see what our Pope is really like should take a minute to read some of his writings. The en­cyclical entitled On the Dignity and Vocation of Women, for in­stance, is demonstration of the high regard in which John Paul holds women. On the Hun­dredth Anniversary of Rerum Novarum is an update on the social teachings of the Church. 
For those who would like a more informal, less theologi-
Dear Editor: 
During your fall break this year a very special group of people came to Florida. It wasn't your typical Florida fall­break crowd. I am speaking about the students who came to help the people devastated by Hurricane Andrew. This letter is for them. 
You came down to rebuild homes. You did a fine job re­cally intense introduction to the Holy Father, there are many biographies available in our li­brary. I would recommend particularly Andre Frossard's Portrait of John II, which is an intimate introduction to the thought, spirituality, and per­sonality of this Pope. 
Better yet, those who would like to really see for themselves if Pope John Paul II is a man of peace should know that he is coming to the United States in August, 1993, for the biannual World Youth Day. This event will take place in the mountains of Denver, Colorado, Aug. 15­16. 
The last World Youth Day took place in Poland, when over two million young people from all five continents gathered to hear what message the Pope had for them. John Paul II, from the beginning of his pontificate, has traveled all over the world to spread the mes­sage of Christ with courage, and he has never failed to meet with young people like us, whom he is counting on to build a "civilization of love" in the third millennium. 
For more information about the Denver World Youth Day, you can contact your diocese, or ask the pastor of your parish, as there are many trips being organized through the dioceses. If you take the time to get to know this Pope, you won't regret it; he is truly a man of peace, and he wants to challenge us to live the message of Christ to the full. 
Moira Walsh Off-campus Dear Editor: 
This past weekend I had the pleasure of visiting your uni­versity while seeing a friend from home. 
I just wanted to take the op­portunity to personally thank Ed Walters of 218 Cavanaugh and his friends, especially the hospitality of his girlfriend Tara Lynch of 734 P.E., for a won­derful weekend. 
Despite my constant mocking of Notre Dame's location, or I should say lack of civilization as I know it to be because New York City does not have any corn fields, I was overwhelmed with Notre Dame's friendly stu­dent body. 
Coming from the Big Apple I was rather apprehensive the first day when complete strangers actually took the time to establish eye contact, greet me with a warm friendly smile, and say hello. Eye contact and a friendly hello is a no-no in N.Y.C. 
My greatest memory will be the Irish's victory over Penn State. I still cannot believe someone picked me up from the field, all 5'11 3/4 " of me, and literally tossed me over the heads of other fans for about 40 yards. 
It was even more embarrass­ing on the flight back to New York when an alumni sat next to me and told me the story of seeing some female student tossed around the field faintly screaming, "Get me back to Cavanaugh!" 
I truly appreciated the hospi­tality and outward friendliness I received from the student body at Notre Dame. From this ex­perience I have taken a little bit of the Hoosier hospitality back to fill in the many bites so many have taken from the Big Apple.

Old Fashioned Fun 
'Mr. Pickwick' promises traditional holiday cheer 
By MARA DIVIS 
Saint Mary's Accent Editor 

Students are invited to Charles Dickens' character Mr. Pickwick's home tonight as he hosts a Christmas storytelling and caroling party in Washington Hall. 
"Mr. Pickwick's Stories for a Christmas Evening," performed by Troupe America, will bring stories, poems and Christmas carols to the Notre Dame stage tonight, according to Bill Donati, the group's managing agent. 
Based on Dickens' novel The Pickwick Papers, "Mr. Pickwick Stories for a Christmas Evening" incorporates several holiday stories, using both music and comedy, Donati said. He added that the touring group makes the audience a part of its performances. 
"(The director) Curt Wollan is known for participatory theatre," he said. "You walk into Mr. Pickwick's house for a Christmas party and Mr. Pickwick actually comes out and starts telling stories." 
In addition to the adaptation of The Pickwick Papers, the complete story involves parts of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. and Clement Moore's "The Night Before Christmas." 
The story, based on The Pickwick Papers, involves much of the structure of the novel, according to Donati. 
He said that Pickwick, (Dickens' character) required his guests to role-play as they told his stories and adventures. In this way, according to Donati, 

Members of Troupe America will perform "Mr. Pickwick's Stories for a Christmas Evening" tonight. Tickets are 
available for $7. 

Troupe America's performance will echo Dickens' novel. 
Dickens was a writer known for his strong characterization, according to a review of the group's production. Mr. Pickwick is no exception. The review, from a Virginia newspaper, said that the performance's characters are similar to those of a Dickens novel. 
In addition, the second half of the show will be a takeoff of A Christmas Carol.. according to Donati. It will blend comedy and traditional Victorian music, he said. 
"It's songs, poems, and carols as it would have been back in the 1860's," he said. "The Christmas Carol should be very recognizable." 
Donati said that the theater will be decorated as a Victorian

estate, complete with the servants serving "Aunt Margaret Pickwick's Christmas cookies." 
He said that entering the theater will be like entering Mr. Pickwick's home, as the character will welcome fictitious names as members of the audience come in. The audience is also invited to sing along with the company, Donati said. 
"As the audience is going out of the theater, the company will exit with them and be there to greet them," Donati said. "It's just good stories, familiar carols, and good holiday fare." 
upe America, formed in order to put live theater productions into the national touring market, according to a biography of the group. 
Producer/Director Curt Wollan started the 13-member group's productions in 1987, and since its inception, Troupe America has toured such well­known productions as "A Child's Christmas in Wales," "Nunsense," and "The 1940's Radio Hour." 
Based in Minneapolis, Troupe America is listed in Who's Who in American Entertainment and is a past recipient of the Twin Cities Drama Critics Kudos award, Donati said. 
In addition, Donati said that Mr. Pickwick is a tradition for the group. 
"This is our seventh production of "Mr. Pickwick's Stories for a Christmas Evening,"' he said. "We put it together every Christmas." 
Tonight's performance at 8:10 in Washington Hall is sponsored by Student Activities. Student tickets are available for $7 at the LaFortune Information desk. 
By PETER BEVACQUA 
Film Critic 

In "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is once again alone, and this time he has all of New York City for his playground. But he isn't going to be alone for along. The notorious Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), are bound for the Big Apple, too, still smarting from their last encounter with Kevin, and plotting larceny on a grand scale. 
Chris Columbus' sequel to the original, which is the third highest­grossing film in motion picture history, is both repetitive and humorous (an unlikely combination, yet possible in the world of Hollywood follow-ups). It is quite difficult to make a successful sequel to a film which was so appealing because of its unique formula-"Home Alone" is unique, "Home Alone 2" is a slightly altered version of the same thing. 
The first half of the film is tiresome. Once again Kevin is left on his own due to his inattentive parents. The only ray of light, in an otherwise bleak hour of cinematic boredom, is the photography of New York City. Columbus borrows shots identical to Francis Ford Coppola's depiction of young Vito Corleone in the one of the all-time great sequels, "Godfather II.'' Eventually the splendor of the cinematography wears thin, and the audience is left with a greedy kid 
'Home Alone 2' shines with humor, disappointment 
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New 
York"

Directed by Chris Columbus

Pesc1 and Daniel Stern 
** 

(out of a possible five) 
gorging himself within the confines of "New York's most exciting hotel," the majestic Plaza. 
Columbus tries to deliver some sense of true Christmas sentiment by forming a relationship between Kevin and the mysterious Pigeon Lady. Audiences are moved by the warmth of Clarence in Frank Capra's "It's A Wonderful Life"-the Pigeon Lady is, (or lack 

of a better term, disgusting. There are two bright 
spots in this "Caddyshack II" Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, andMacaulay Culkin star in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York caliber sequel (perhaps that is being a bit too rough). Once Kevin 
finds himself in the Plaza he embarks on a battle of wits with the hotel's persnickety concierge, played with extra dollops of snobbery and disdain by Tim Curry, who bears a striking resemblance to a figure who has become synonymous with the Christmas season, the Grinch. However, it is Kevin's battle with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern inside a to be renovated Brownstone which is the 
. . . highlight of the film. Although the se_q~enc_e _bor.ro~s ~tunts fro~ the Original, It IS still h1lar_wus. There IS not one _among you who will not laugh_ aloud ~un?g the cartoonesque torturmg of esc! an~ Stern. . " . Home Alone 2: Lost m New Yor~ Is won~erf~l for a young audience, .~ut It will n~t appeal ~o everyone. Home Alone was and IS 
enjoyed by an audience of all ages-it is, however, difficult to amuse anyone over the age of ten, again, with the same material. Parts of the film are undeniably funny, and that spells money-nonetheless. For the sake of Macaulay Culkin, I hope they do not make a "Home Alone 3: Lost in God knows where" because there is a fine line between cute and obnoxious.

In final quarter of season, NFC playoffs clear, AFC still muddled 
(AP)-So what's new? The San Francisco 49ers are in the playoffs again, their ninth post­season berth in 10 years and their lOth straight 10-win sea­son. 
So what's new? What's new is that Buffalo stumbled in Indi­anapolis and could conceivably play on the road in January­like in Pittsburgh. 
As the NFL enters the final quarter of the regular season, the playoff picture is clear in the NFC, where the Super Bowl winner usually comes from, and muddled in the AFC, where Buffalo remains the favorite to get to Pasadena. The opponent? How about the 49ers or Cowboys. 
Without geting into the myriad "what ifs", here's a quick look: 
In the NFC: Unless Philadel­phia or Washington break down, only Green Bay (6-6) has a real shot at breaking into the projected group of playoff teams -San Francisco and Dallas (each 10-2); Minnesota and New Orleans (each 9-3) and the Redskins and Eagles (each 7-5). 
There's a good chance that by this time next week, only the last two spots will be open ­among the Eagles, Redskins and Packers. Plus a battle for the home field -San Francisco currently holds the tiebreaker over Dallas and Minnesota would like to move up and get a bye. 
The Packers, who haven't made the playoffs in a non­strike year since 1972 have a shot. If they finished tied with the Eagles, the get in because they beat Philadelphia 27-24 three weeks ago. 
"The playoffs are still a dream away. We've still got to win four or at least three out of four," kicker Chris Jacke said after his four field goals helped the Packers to a 19-14 win over Tampa Bay on Sunday. 
"All the factors will have to come together." 
Three of four? The Pack will be favored in two -at home to Detroit and the Rams. The other two are at Houston and Minnesota and they can hope the Vikings have nothing left to play for when they go to the Metrodome the final week. 
The Eagles get three of four at home -Minnesota next week, then the Redskins and Giants the last two weeks. Their only road game is at Seattle, 1-10 before Monday's game with Dallas. 
In the AFC: Houston could miss the playoffs after an NFL-high five straight appearances. This in a year a lot of people picked them to go all the way. 
Buffalo and Pittsburgh (9-3) will make it -the Steelers can clinch the Central with one more win and one more loss by both Houston and Cleveland. 
The Bills, despite their shocking overtime loss to the Colts, should still win the East but could lose the home field to the Steelers -their last two games are at New Orleans and Houston. That would jeopardize their third straight trip to the Super Bowl -they've gotten there the last two years by play­ing at Rich Stadium in January. 
There are six teams fighting for the other four spots ­Kansas City and Miami (8-4); Denver (7 -4 before Monday night's game); San Diego and Houston (7-5) and Cleveland (6­6). 
The Chargers remain the NFL's hottest team -they've won seven of eight and their fi­nal four opponents are Phoenix, Seattle, the Raiders and Cincinnati (combined record 13­34). That's courtesy of their last-place schedule that could help them to become the only team ever to overcome an 0-4 start to make the postseason. 
"Don't knock the schedule," 
says general manager Bobby Beathard. "We earned it." 
Kansas City probably has in the edge in the West -Marty Schottenheimer-coached teams normally close well. The Chiefs have two wins over San Diego (for tiebreaker purposes). and get Denver at home the final week. 
They also visit the Raiders and Giants (Sunday's win over the Jets was their first in the Meadowlands in nine games) and get the Patriots at home. That's three teams who are a combined 12-24. 
Right now? 

Make it Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami (with a tiebreaking win over Houston); San Diego and Denver. 
REMARKABLE RICE: It took Jerry Rice just 119 games to get 100 TD catches. Steve Largent took 200 -but didn't have Joe Montana and Steve Young throwing to him. 
More remarkable -Don Hut­son, who played from 1935 to 1945 had 99 TD catches in 117 games, in an era where the single-wing was in vogue and a lot of games ended like soccer matches -0-0, 2-0, 3-0, and the like. 
NEW QUARTERBACK SOCI­ETY: Mixed reviews for the six new quarterbacks who started Sunday. 
THE GOOD: Sean Salisbury, Minnesota, 23 of 34 for 238 yards in the Vikings' 31-17 win over the Rams. It was his first NFL start after seven years with four teams. 
THE FAIR: Peter Tom Willis, Chicago, in for Jim Harbaugh: 19 of 26 for 285 yards and two touchdowns. But the Bears lost 27-14 to Cleveland and Willis threw two interceptions, one of them returned 92 yards for a touchdown by David Brandon. 
Bernie Kosar, Cleveland, back after 10 games out with a bro­ken ankle: 8 of 17 for 59 yards, but the Browns won. 
THE UGLY: Timm Rosenbach, Phoenix: 19 of 34 for 262 yards but FOUR interceptions in a 41­3 loss to Washington. 
David Klingler, Cincinnati: 16 of 34 for 140 yards and 10 sacks in a 21-9 loss to Pitts­burgh. 
THE INCOMPLETE: 
Ken O'Brien, New York Jets: 1 of 3 for 13 yards in a 23-7 loss to Kansas City before leaving with a reinjured right thumb.

Williams' speed, Taylor's talent lead Irish past Aussies B-ball 
By JONATHAN JENSEN Sports Writer 
It was a classic clash between a flash of quickness and speed, and a decidedly more laid-back and less-talented group of ath­letes. 
As the game started it looked as if the JACC would be treated to a second showing of the Monty Williams show, and they were. The 6-8 Williams was all over the court, scoring the Irish's first seven points on one foul shot and three flashy drives to the basket. 
As the Aussies scored eight straight points to close to within eight at 20-12, the only returning starter from last year's NIT finalists, sophomore forward Billy Taylor, took con­trol. 
Taylor finished the half with a team-high 16 points, but his play was actually not the real surprise of the game. It came from the lone healthy freshman on the Irish roster, a 6-2 guard from Roscoe, Illinois, Ryan Hoover. 
The calm and collected 
Hoover simply took over the 
point guard position for Lamarr Justice in Just his second college game and hit a bank-shot, slipped a back-door pass to Carl Cozen for a score. 

Hoover was so impressive that he started the second-half for Justice. In fact, Hoover's 13­point performance, highlighted by three treys, earned a loud roar from the sparse JACC crowd when he left the game for good. 
"I thought I'd get a chance to play more," explained Hoover, who averaged over 27 points a game last season at Rockton Hononegah High, "So I just did what coach asked me to. I was a little more relaxed tonight and I went out there with noth­ing to prove." 
Meanwhile, Williams was capping off the Irish rout with an outstanding 20-point, 15­rebound performance, featuring a couple more effortless no-look passes and driving lay-ups. 
"The big difference tonight was conditioning, I'm getting up and down the court better," noted Williams, ''I'm not where I want to be, but it's starting to come along." 
Williams, who has made a dramatic return since being di-

agnosed with a heart ailment, said he has been nervous play­ing his first games since an outstanding freshman cam­paign, even if it doesn't show on the court. 
"Because of pressure I have put on myself," remarked Williams, "Sometimes I try to make big plays instead of just doing the little things. But you can never push yourself too much." 
And all this time, the trusty Taylor was swishing jumpers and tearing down rebounds in the best game of his young ca­reer, surpassing his previous 22-point game against Loyola last year with a 24-point effort. 
"Being the only player with a lot of experience, I've been trying to do as much as possi­ble," said Taylor, who hails from Chicagoland's West Aurora High, "I've just been con­centrating more on my shots and also getting open easier. 
"My personality is such that I let my actions speak louder than my words, and I think that if my teammates see me working hard, they will work hard as well." 
Hopefully, this apparent clash of styles between tonight's starring cast of the restrained pair of Taylor and Hoover and the magical flash of Williams and Russell will be the perfect formula for many more Irish blowouts.

coach John MacLeod said. "But we were standing around too much offensively in the first half. I thought we moved the ball with better rhythm in the second half." 
In the second half, the Irish were as sharp as the Aus­tralians were sluggish. 
Freshman Ryan Hoover started the half at point guard and made a quick impact, con­tributing in all aspects of the game, including initiating a mini-run with a spectacular driving layup midway through the half. 
In the 11-2 spurt that fol­lowed, Hoover, Williams and sophomore Malik Russell showed their versatile skills with some tough inside moves and some slick assists that put away the Australians for good. 
"(Hoover) responded very well with the first unit," MacLeod said. "He plays under control and he is a good shooter. He has a lot of offen­sive skills." 
Rebounding was a main area of concern for MacLeod in Monday's game and he saw some encouraging signs. Williams pulled down a game­high 15 boards and Russell was next with 13. 
"We have to be active on the boards," MacLeod explained. "We are not a particularly big club so we have to concentrate on blocking out and getting the big rebounds." 
Poor field goal shooting hurt the Australians and helped Notre Dame's defensive cause. Pat Reidy collected 19 points for the All-Stars, but he hit only 8 of 24 shots from the field. Former Connecticut star John Gwynn was next with 17. 
Taylor's 24 points led the Irish, and Williams finished with 20. 
Although they are pleased with the outcome, the Irish realize that it was merely an exhibition, and the regular sea­son will bring much tougher competition. 
"It was a building game, a learning game," MacLeod commented. "We are making strides, and we have to con­tinue to improve as the season goes along."

The three-point USC lead could have been, and should have been seven, but Conway dropped a sure touchdown at the goaline two plays earlier. "Curtis is going to catch that ball nine times out of 10, but it just happened that he dropped that one." said Johnson. 
"It was a lack of concentra­tion," Conway said. "Rob threw a perfect pass, but I took my eye off the ball. He had some pressure, but he put the ball right where we wanted it." 
Starting at their own 20, the Irish went 80-yards on only five plays in their final possession of the half. Brooks capped the drive with his second touchdown, outrunning the USC secondary for a 55-yard score and a 17-13lead. 
USC couldn't answer on its next possession, but Notre Dame's Charles Stafford and Mike Miller collided on the punt return, causing a fumble which Jeff Kopp recovered for the Trojans at the 28-yard line. Three plays later Ford kicked a 32-yarder to pull USC within one at the half, 17-16. 
The second half proved more of the same. Brooks running, Johnson throwing, and two overmatched defenses. 
Notre Dame and Brooks struck first on a 65-yard, eight play march capped by the se­nior running back's third score of the day. Brooks took the ball from Mirer, and following a key block from fullback Jerome Bettis, scampered 44-yards down the sideline untouched. 
The Trojans answered with a 67 -yard, five play drive of their own, which included three pass completions for 10 or more yards, the longest coming on the 18-yards scoring pass to tailback Estrus Crayton. 
The score remained 24-23 until midway through the fourth period when Bettis barreled through the Trojan defense from eight yards out, set up by a 42-yard run from Brooks. 
It appeared time had run out on the Trojans when on their next possession the Notre Dame defense stiffened, stopping USC on downs. But after holding Brooks and Bettis from the first down and forcing a Hentrich punt, USC got one last chance with the ball at their own 20 and 2:29 remaining. 
Johnson picked away at the soft Notre Dame zone. Four completions and a run by Strother put USC in Irish terri­tory at the 46. On the next play, Johnson hit Hannah 41 yards down the left sideline despite blanket coverage by Carter and what appeared to be an inter­ception. 
"I had the ball first and then he made a better play on the ball then I did," said the junior cornerback. "Never, at Notre Dame or in high school has that ever happened to me." 
After a USC time-out, Irish defensive end Devon McDonald sacked Johnson for a seven yard loss. After using its final time-out, Johnson brought the Trojans to the line with only 19 seconds remaining. 
Standing in the shotgun, h1: dropped two steps back and looked to the left corner of the endzone to Morton who was be­ing covered by Irish cornerback Greg Lane. In front of Morton and Lane was Carter, covering his man in the right flat. As

said Johnson. "But I wanted to give Johnnie (Morton} a chance one-on-one." 
It was the only mistake made by the USC quarterback in a ca­reer day. He finished with 302 yards passing, completing 27 of 41 attempts, all career marks. 
Notre Dame hammered the USC defense on the ground. Ranked sixth nationally in rush defense, allowing under a hun­dred yards rushing per game the Trojan defense allowed 330 yards on only 45 carries. 
"They line up and ran right at us," said Smith. "It was difficult for us to match up with them and that took its toll. 
"Notre Dame has an excellent football team, and I think we just got beat by a little better team today. It has nothing to do with preparation or anything like that. It was a hard-fought game and they found a way to win, and we didn't." 


Tom Carter 

Johnson threw the ball Carter broke from his man and faded back into the flight of the ball for the game-saving inter­ception. 
"My man did a hitch and I tried to stay with him so that the quarterback would think that the receiver behind me was open," said Carter. "But you could read where he was going and I drifted back when he threw. I knew I was going to make the interception." 
"It was a bad decision. I should have thrown it away,"

Brooks finishes off Irish 'Decade of Dominance' 

By RICH KURZ Associate Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES-Irish coach Lou Holtz called USC versus Notre Dame "THE game," and before the game told his assis­tants he had the feeling this year's contest would be a clas­sic game. 
On page 14 of the USC foot­ball yearbook, Coach Larry Smith has beating Notre Dame as one of his top five goals for the team. Of course, he still doesn't know what that feels like while coaching the Trojans. 
T-shirts on sale around the Coliseum pronounced the Notre Dame string of victories over the Trojans as "The Decade of Dominance." But in the previ­ous three years each of the Notre Dame wins has been by four points. Not exactly total dominance. 
This was supposed to be the year that the Trojans came to­gether to beat the Irish. The game was in L.A. and the Southern Cal rush defense was ranked sixth in the nation in rush defense, surrendering less than 100 yards per game. 
Reggie Brooks alone broke that barrier in the first half. The Irish were getting back to basics this season, which to Holtz means running the foot­ball.

Meanwhile, USC, formerly known as Tailback U., passed the ball 41 times. 
On their first possession, the Irish ran the ball seven straight times, covering 7 4 yards in 2:58, and scoring a touchdown. 
The Notre Dame rushing at­tack left the Trojans in the dust. Reggie Brooks thrust himself back into the Heisman picture with a performance that Mar­shall Faulk or Garrison Hearst, the leading two running back candidates for the award, would have been proud of. 
Brooks scored on runs of 12, 44, and 55 yards on his way to 227 yards on all of 19 carries, for an average of 11.9 yards a carry. 
"Brooks has had a great year, he had great stats coming in,"

said Smith. "We knew he was a good player. He ran well and played a great football game." 
But it wasn't an individual ef­fort by any means. Bettis helped out with 89 yards on 18 carries, getting tough yards up the middle. 
The offensive hero of the day was the offensive line, however. Time after time, they blasted holes so big that the backs weren't touched until they got five yards past the line of scrimmage. 
"I thought our offensive line performed exceptionally well," said Holtz. "Reggie Brooks got some great blocking." 
Bettis echoed his coach's sentiments. 
"I have to give credit to the offensive line," said the junior fullback. "The holes were there and we ran through them." 
It may have been a bit brash for the Irish to think they could run on a defense that good. But the Irish offense is that good. 
"Our game plan was to run the football and try to control it," said Holtz. 
It was pure power football. 
"We knew that they came up the field hard," said Bettis. "So we took the ball right up the middle at them." 
Tide would play in the Citrus and No. 8 Georgia (8-3) in the Gator. If Florida loses on Satur­day, it goes to the Gator against No. 13 North Carolina State (9­2-1), while Alabama gets the Sugar and Georgia the Citrus against No. 15 Ohio State (8-2­

The Irish are on a roll, having beaten three straight ranked teams, and for the seniors, there was no better way to finish up the regular season than with a win over the Tro­jans. 
"I was talking to (former Notre Dame center) Gene McGuire the other day," said tackle Lindsay Knapp, a fifth­year senior, "and he told me that (beating USC) doesn't really sink in until you realize that you've beaten them five times." 
When Tom Carter picked off a Rob Johnson pass in the corner of the end zone to seal the victory, Notre Dame linebacker Demetrius DuBose took his helmet off and kneeled on the field, as if to breath a sigh of relief. 
"One, I was thanking God," he said, "and two, I was just exhausted. 
"We're playing the best since I've been involved with the team," the senior said. "This team is a tribute to itself and to Notre Dame."

"I thought it was a great foot­ball game," Holtz said. "It was a game where nobody gave up. It was what Notre Dame-USC should be."

Irish hockey loses two over break, adds two for next season 
By BRYAN CONNOLLY 
Sports Writer 

During a busy Thanksgiving break, the Notre Dame hockey team dropped two games and their record to 1-11-1 on the season, but picked up two re­cruits during the early signing period. 
The Irish fell to Michigan State at home on Friday night by a score 8-4 before moving on to the Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan, where they fell to the University of Michigan, 5-l. The two losses left the Irish with a 1-10-1 record in the CCHA. 
Coming off a weekend which featured the first Irish win of the year, Notre Dame started out slowly in front of 2,807 fans in JACC on Friday night by al­lowing Michigan State to rattle off the first five goals of the game. 
Senior center Curtis Janicke was the first to respond for the Irish by scoring on a power play with 6:23 remaining in the second period. He was assisted by freshman Brett Bruininks and junior captain Matt Osiecki. 
After another MSU tally, freshman Jamie Matushak gave the Irish their second goal of the night with assists going to fellow freshmen Jamie Ling and Jay Matushak. The Spartans scored one more time before the close of the period to leave the score at 7-2 entering the final stanza. 
Senior Dave Bankoske made it a 7-3 game only one minute and thirty one seconds into the third period on an unassisted short handed goal. Eighteen seconds after MSU's last netting of the contest, Ling scored the game's final goal on a power play with Janicke assisting. 
Junior goaltender Greg Louder, rebounding from a groin injury, allowed the first seven goals on seventeen shots through the first two periods. Senior Carl Picconatto replaced him in the third period and stopped nine of the ten shots he faced. 
"At times we were playing fairly well," said Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer, "but not as well as we are capable of. I have higher expectations." 
Although the crowd was the second largest home attendance of the year for the Irish, as well as the second largest over the past three seasons, it paled in comparison to the audience that arrived the following evening in Auburn Hills. 
18,147 spectators showed up to watch the first ice hockey game ever played in the Palace, setting a new record as the largest crowd in a NCAA non­tournament contest. 
Notre Dame's Ling scored the first goal ever in the Palace on a power play with Osiecki and Janicke assisting. However, the Wolverines responded by net­ting twice before the period ended to take a 2-1 lead which they would not relinquish. 
Michigan held the Irish with­out a goal for the rest of the night and managed to score three more of their own in the third period to claim their 5-1 victory. 
Picconatto played well in net for Notre Dame, making sixteen saves before being removed for the final half of the third period due to a ten minute misconduct penalty. Junior Brent Lothrop filled in and saved all three shots he faced. 
The Irish out shot Michigan, 31-24. "They (the Wolverines) are a 
Women's hoops set to open season at Marquette 
Observer Staff Report 

The Notre Dame women's basketball opens its season at Marquette tonight, after drop­ping its only preseason game to Slovan Bratislava. 
The Warriors put on the court an experienced squad which finished 16-13 a season ago. 
Four starters return for coach Jim Jabir, a group which includes guard Kris Maskala who averaged 21.9 points a game last season. Also return­ing is forward Christine Kennedy who led the team in rebounding (9.6 per game) a year ago. 
The Warriors tied for first in the Great Midwest Conference, but fell to DePaul in the confer­ence tournament final. 
Last season, Notre Dame lost its first two games before re­bounding to beat Marquette 83­68 at the JACC. The Irish were led by two graduate seniors. Margaret Nowlin and Comalita

Notre Dame fell in its only exhibition game, a 83-68 loss to Slovan Bratislova. 
Letitia Bowen looked impres­sive for Notre Dame, scoring 27 points off 11 of 18 shooting from the floor. The sophomore forward also nabbed 17 re­bounds and bagged 7 steals leading the Irish in all three categories.

Senior guard Coquese Wash­ington added eleven points, while juniors Sherri Orlosky and Tootie Jones each pitched in ten. 
Along with these four, junior Kara Leary is expected to start in tonights game against Mar­quette. 
Notre Dame was picked to finish second in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference by the coaches at media day. Xavier, the 1991-92 regular season champion was picked to finish first. 
At the same event, Washing­ton was selected as a member of the preseason second team ali-MCC team. 
Following the game with the Warriors, Notre Dame will have its first of four games against ranked opponents. Ninth­ranked Purdue visits the JACC on Friday night. 
very good hockey team," said Schafer, who predicted that Michigan will be one of the Fi­nal Four in this year's NCAA tournament. 
"We've come a long way from our first loss against Michigan," Osiecki said. "It's just a matter of getting a few breaks and putting up a few wins instead of losses." 
The squad's freshmen con­tinue to play outstanding hockey, as they scored three of Notre Dame's five goals this weekend and earned three as­sists. Ling, who had two goals and an assist on the weekend, is currently on top of the CCHA scoring chart with eighteen points. 
Although the Irish did drop both contests this weekend, they can find solace in the fact that they have already signed two prospects during the early signing period. 
Tim Harberts, a center from Wayzata, Minnesota, was one of the most highly recruited centers in the nation. On top of leaving Wayzata as the career scoring leader, he has also played for the United States Se­lect-16 Team as its top forward. Minnesota, Harvard, and Wis­consin were the three other schools which he was most se­riously considering. 
Ben Nelsen, a defenseman from Plymouth, Minnesota, was considered one of the premier defensemen in Minnesota high school hockey as well as one of the top players in the USHL. 
Also seriously recruited by Boston College, Brown, Minnesota and Vermont, he will add a potent offensive threat to the Notre Dame blue line.

Random Thoughts 
Bowl picture waits for Seminole decision 
Who are we playing in the game? 
That is the question on a lot of people's minds, as the semester and the college football season draw to a close. 
The only thing that appears to be set in stone is that Miami and Alabama will play for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl if the Tide beat Florida on Saturday. 
If this happens it appears that the Cotton Bowl, which has the next choice, will invite third-ranked Florida State to play Southwest Conference champion Texas A&M, which auto­matically plays in the Cotton. 
"We have to do what is best for the Cotton Bowl, but keep in mind what is best for Texas A&M," Cotton Bowl selection chairman Jim Brock said. 
Some people, however, are speculating that the Seminoles will pass on the trip to Dallas and play Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, instead. They are allowed to do this because the Coalition allows teams to pass for three reasons: a regular-season rematch, a third straight bowl appearance or economic reasons. 
Florida State could pass due to the third condition. The Seminoles would make $1.2 million more in the Orange. If they opt to do so, Notre Dame would go to Dallas to face the undefeated Aggies, while Syracuse and Colorado travel to Tempe for the Fiesta Bowl. 
Now that you have that straight, let's discuss the possibilities if Florida upsets Alabama in the Southeastern Conference title game. 
This would put the Gators in the Sugar Bowl and knock the Tide into the Citrus Bowl, where the SEC runner-up is locked into. In this scenario, the Seminoles would face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. The Hurricanes cannot pass on such a game because it is a number-one versus number-two matchup. The fact that the teams have already played is meaningless.~ 
This would leave the Aggies and Irish to play for second place in the Cotton Bowl, and Nebraska would most likely face Syracuse in the Orange. 
The bottom line of this mess is that Miami will be playing either Alabama or Florida State for the national championship, unless Texas A&M somehow jumps to second in the polls. 
Notre Dame will most likely be playing the Aggies in the Cotton Bowl, unless Florida State accepts the Cotton's invitation. If that happens, the Irish will probably face Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
The Cotton Bowl is the best place for the Irish to go. It gives them an opportunity to face an undefeated team which is ranked ahead of them, and a win there could give the Irish the second spot in the polls.

Irish run streak to ten in a row

LOS ANGELES -The foreshadowed 
"Decade of Dominance" became a reality 
Saturday as a late vindication by Tom 
Carter and a Heisman-like performance 
by Reggie Brooks led Notre Dame to a 
31-23 win over USC at the Los Angeles

Girls and beer help Irish defeat Aussies 
By JASON KELLY 
Sports Writer 

Girls and beer helped lift the Notre Dame men's basketball team to a decisive 101-68 exhibition win over the Victorian All-Stars from Australia Mon­day at the Joyce Center. 
On their exhausting tour of the United States, some of the Australian players have been more concerned with scouting the local bars than the opposing teams, and it showed against the Irish. 
"Some of our guys are interested in working hard and improving," Victorian coach Ian Stacker said. "But some of them are more interested in looking for girls and drinking a few Budweisers. I am very embarrassed with the way we played." 
From the opening tip the Irish dominated the game, jumping out to a 12-0 lead behind seven quick points from senior Monty Williams. 
Despite the great start, Notre Dame's half-court offense was stagnant for much of the first half, but their improved conditioning was too much for the All­Stars. Sophomore Billy Taylor provided much of the Notre Dame offense in the opening half, scoring 16 of his game high 24 points, while Williams added nine points and 10 rebounds. 
"We've had some good, hard (practice) sessions and we've made some improvements in our conditioning," Irish 
see B-BALUpage 15 
"There were a lot of critical plays. It was a game where nobody gave up. It was what Notre Dame-USC should be." 
Brooks rushed for 227 yards on 19 carries and scored on touchdown runs of 12, 55, and 49 yards despite suffering from the flu, which forced him to remove himself from a number of plays. 
But Brooks effort may not have been enough if Carter hadn't intercepted Trojan QB Rob Johnson's pass in the endzone, two plays after he allowed a 41-yard reception to Travis Hannah to put USC within scoring distance. 
Both teams revealed their strategies early. Johnson attempted four passes in the game's opening five plays, while Notre Dame's first drive consisted of seven straight run plays. 
The two teams quickly found success. USC went 60-yards in 12 plays, highlighted by Johnson's three completions to split end Johnnie Morton. The offense stalled in Irish territory and settled for a 35-yard Cole Ford field goal. 
Notre Dame countered with a seven play, 7 4-yard drive in which Brooks ran three times for 36-yards including the 12-yard scoring pitch giving the Irish a 7-3lead. 
"Our game plan was to run the football and control it," said Holtz. "I thought our offensive line performed exceptionally well, and it was a tremendous job of running by our backs." 
Johnson picked up where he left off in the Trojan's second possession. Completions of 17 and 19-yards to flanker Curtis Conway and a 23-yard strike to Morton set up a one-yard touchdown leap by tailback Deon Strother, returning the lead to USC, 10-7. 
The two teams exchanged turnovers on their next possessions. An interception of a Rick Mirer pass by Trojan safety Stephon Pace at the Notre Dame 31 set up a golden scoring opportunity. But after gaining only nine yards on its first three plays, USC coach Larry Smith decided to go for it on fourth down, using a play which victimized his own defense in an early season win over Washington State. 
Johnson faked a fumbled snap, then took three steps back before lofting a pass over the middle intended for tight end Yonnie Jackson. Irish safety Jeff Burris was not fooled on the play, staying with Jackson and batting away the pass. 
Craig Hentrich kicked a 37-yard field goal to tie the score, and Ford converted his second attempt of the day, this one from 38-yards out, bringing the score to 13-10.

The Thanksgiving holiday weekend turned out to be a good news-bad news affair for the Notre Dame women's vol­leyball team. 
The good news included the completion of a regular season among the best in program history, a berth in the NCAA Volleyball Championship, and Regional Coach of the Year honors for head coach Debbie Brown.

Katie Haller powered the USC attack with 16 kills and 16 digs, while Christy Peters chipped in 15 kills and Jessica Fiebelkorn garnered 13 digs in a losing cause. 
Despite ending on a negative note, the Notre Dame squad has every reason to be proud of its regular season accomplishments. The Irish went 30*7 for only the third 30-win season in program history, and are ranked 22nd in the nation by the coaches' poll. The year also included Midwest Collegiate Conference regular season and tournament championships, a plethora of conference awards including Player of the Year for Jet;sica Fiebelkorn and Coach of the Year for Debbie Brown, and victories over three nationally ranked squads. 
All that success has earned Notre Dame its spot in the upcoming tournament, but that spot is not an easy one to he in. Penn State (27-3} is ranked ninth in the nation and is 183-8 in R@Q tlall since 1980, including 69 wins in its last 70 matches there. Once
