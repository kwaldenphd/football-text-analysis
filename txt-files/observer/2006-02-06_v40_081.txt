ND group aims for free speech 
Coalition formed for student expression 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER News Writer 

Notre Dame students eon­corned about aeademie fren­dom and artistie expression plan to take aetion and makn their voices heard through a new coalition called United for Free Speech. 
United for Froe Speech is a group of students whose stat­ed aim is to promote dialogue about the r11cent campus con­troversies surrounding "The Vagina Monologues" and Queer Film Festival. The group formed· as a response to University President Father John Jnnkins' speeches to fac­ulty and students Jan. 23 and 24, which questioned ­among other things -the events' appropriateness in light of the University's Catholie character. 
The organizers of United for Free Speech said they worry potential University policies stemming from tho addrosses will limit students' ability to express themselves. 
"The group, United for Free Speech, will advocate and work for a University environ­ment that proteets acadernie freedom and respects diversi­ty," said a press release issued

Chuck D raps on racism, tnusic

The eternal city 
For most American college-age journal­ists, an assignment in Rome to cover University representatives' interaction with Vatican officials within 48 hours would be a mission impossible. Jetlag, culture shock, the language barrier, confusing trans­
portation and wind­ing streets would  . Claire Kelley  
present serious  
logistical problems. But for me, it was  Photo Editor  
like going home.  
Last week, when  

The Observer decided to send a writer and a photographer to Rome, my heart stopped. Two years ago, I studied abroad in the Saint Mary's Program in the center of historic Rome, and I walked the ancient streets until I knew them by heart. 
Since those eight months in Rome, I have returned to my old neighborhood many times. In my dreams, I wait at the light in Largo di Torre Argentina. When the cars and motorinos finally stop, I run across the street and onto the cobblestones, passing the bar Pascucci's and our classroom building door until I catch a glimpse of my favorite building-the Pantheon. 
Last week, in the midst of our frantic schedule, I was able to physically take Maddie, the Observer writer, to my favorite places in Rome. Pausing in the steps of the fountain in the Piazza della Rotunda, we stood before the magnificent fac;ade of the Pantheon. Then we walked through the massive bronze doors to stare up in awe at the oculus and perfect dimensions. 
I took her to Campo dei Fiori, and we sat on the steps of the Giordano Bruno statue, eating panini from Aristocampo and soak­ing in the energy of the bustling market­place where flowers, fish, fruit and vegeta­bles are sold. 
In one of my favorite movies, "I.:Auberge Espagnole," the narrator explains, "When you first arrive in a new city, nothing makes sense. Everything's unknown ... After you've lived here, walked these streets, you'll know them inside out. You'll know these people. Once you've lived here, crossed this street 10, 20, 1000 times, it'll belong to you ..." 
In some ways, this sentiment goes beyond the physical nature of Rome. While the art, grandeur and spectacle at the Vatican is impressive, the sense of spiritu­ality that I found in Rome goes beyond the pomp and circumstance. It is a deep sense of awe at the architectural achievement, a new understanding of Ia dolce vita through the fantastic food and a lesson in human passion, where people will always remem­ber you with an intense loyalty. 
When I learned that Father John Jenkins could be attending the Pope's public audi­ence, I contacted the director of the Saint Mary's Program, Dr. Portia Prebys. I explained my situation, and asked ifshe knew how to obtain special permission for photography at the Vatican. 
Sure enough, she knew the perfect per­son-Thaddeus Jones, a Vatican official and a 1989 Notre Dame graduate who studied in the Saint Mary's Program. As I sat in the media gallery high above the papal audience with professional photog­raphers, I captured the moment when the pope spoke to Father Jenkins about Notre Dame. There and then, I realized that the sequence of events that made my dreams become reality and that moment possible could have only happened in such a magi­cal place -Rome, the eternal city.

LONDON-It used to be a practice confined to pacts with the devil, but now an anonymous ven­dor in America is offering to sell the soul of the London whale.

"I was accompanying the poor whale in his last journey, and he handed his soul to me. He asked me to sell it, so I could invest the money raised in other bottle nosed whales," said the seller from Minneapolis, giving the

Sailor's bottle message gets angry reply 
NAPEAGUE, N.Y. -A sailor who sent a message out to sea in a bottle says he received a reply from England -accusing him of littering. "I kind of felt like no good deed goes unpunished," Harvey Bennett, 55, told the East Hampton Star. 
The plastic bottle was one of five that Bennett placed in the ocean off 
Long Island in August. 
Last week, he excitedly opened a letter from Engl­and, and was stunned by the reply: 

"I recently found your bottle while taking a sce­nic walk on the beach by Poole Harbour. While you may consider this some profound experiment on the path and speed" of "oceanic currents, I have another name for it, lit­ter." 
"You Americans don't seem to be happy unless you are mucking about somewhere," says the let­ter.

Erotic tradition of scripture vital, speaker says 

By MEGAN O'NEIL Sainr Mary's F.di1or 
Tlw erolie tradition which grew out of' the Song of' Songs in the ll!llm~w Scriptures is an enriching facet of' Christian spirituality despite centuries worth of' argunwnts to the con­trary, said Saint Mary's Aquinas Chair emeritus Keith I·:gan Saturday. 
l:gan's ledurn, nntill(1(1 "Eros and Friondship" was the first of two given at the College over thn wnnkend as part of the ninth annual Thomas Aquinas Symposium. This year the Symposium also servnd to kick ofT the 60th anniversary cele­bration of' the Saint Mary's reli­gious studies department. 
While orw of the most com­mented on books during the middle agos, the sensual Song of Songs has at times been ignornd as part of' tho Canon in Christian tradition, 1\gari said, or intorprntnd in such a way that dilutes its meaning. 
"Tho erotic din1ct sense of tho text has been allegorized, 
Celebrating the Song of Songs can also hnlp in thn development of a positive the­ology of sexuality, Egan said. 
"What is need is a positivn vision of human sexuality as .sacred and sacramental," he said. "The Song celebrates and delights in the goodness, power, energy, intensity and beauty of the sexual love of tho Song's twosome." 
Ultimately, Egan said, tho principles of eros, friendship and love that have long been presented by scholars at odds with one another are interde­pendent, and should bo brought back together in rec­onciliation. 
"Eros on its own can becoml1 self-indulgent, friendship with­out love is no friendship at all, and a supposed earitas diseon­nectnd from earthly lovo stands in danger of becoming what !scholar Fergus Kerr 1 calls a supernaturalism, that is, a pretended piety that shuns human society," Egan said.

in other words, given a spiritu­al or mystical meaning," Egan said. "The Jewish tradition has depicted the Song of Songs as a celebration of thn Lord's love for Israel while Christians have seen tho Song as a celebration of' Christ's love 
Songs has influenced the work of many Christians throughout history and, in conjunction with the friendship language of Aquinas, remains relevant today, Egan said.

Many scholars such as Denys Turner and Fergus Kerr believe the erotic mysticism born out of the Song lacks a theological foundation and no longnr has the power to com­municate a message, Egan said.

In a society saturated with sex, Egan said, tho power of erotic language such as that found in the Song is at risk. It is necessary, therefore, to retrieve and preserve the tra­dition in order not to loose the wisdom of women mystics such as Teresa of Avila, Therese of Lisieux and Edith Stein. 
"The people I work with are just great. Although they demand a lot from me, they are encouraging and helpful and-most important of all-:good friends and fun to work with."

D, who has traveled to more than 56 countries, said one of the biggest problems with the United States today is "world geography" and said 18 per­cent of Americans do not have a passport. He also said he was surprised by people who told him they "didn't know New Orleans was a black city" after Hurricane Katrina hit. 
"How the hell you gonna lead the world if you don't know where the world is?" he asked. 
D said the "three things that divide the world" are country divi­code of survival, far away from death." 
D compared the strides of racial progress to a wound that still exists today. 
"If the jab of slavery was 3­to-400 years, how long do you think the bleeding's gonna be, or the wound, or the mark?" he said. 
Many blacks who could not stand to live in the South even after the Emancipation Proclamation moved north, D said, following the Mississippi from New Orleans to Memphis to St. Louis to Chicago -and taking their music north with them, including blues and jazz. Those cities became centers for both blacks and music.

D said especially in America, "celebrity has become a drug ... and people that's do in' real thi~g~,' they ain't gettin' props for 11. 
"When's the last time you saw a black student on TV? 'Different World'," he said. "You're seeing less and less intelligence on TV. [Black stu­dents] get no love from society, [even being] as intellectual as you are striving to be. 
"Hollywood, from the left side, is dictating how you gonna talk, how you gonna dress, how you gonna look. And intelligence ain't even rewarded on the damn cam­pus." 
D cited people judging foot­ball and basketball players as athletes but not students as part of the "disrespect to the black community in this coun­try." 
He also discussed the influ­ence of television on reality, giving the example of rappers showing bravado in videos and movies leading to black stu­dents attempting to look and sound the same when sur­rounded by white students on campus. 
"We have the oxymoron take place -the latter day 
oxymoron of the colle­giate thug," D said. "What the hell's a colle­giate thug? You can't have sewage and a bot­tled water company from the same river." 
D questioned how rap and hip hop music are "being used for all this insanity" in race issues and the image-con­sciousness of the coun­try. He gave a history of race and music that started with slave spiri­tuals and ended with rap music today. 
"These things don't just start up from nowhere," he said. "That's what Black History Month is all about, not just to inform the black people, but [everyone]." 
In the days of slavery -as now -D said black "music and culture was a lifeline." 
"Your music is life, keeping you strong to keep far away from death," he said. "The music is the code of life, 



Pulitzer Prize winner to speak at festival 
Special to The Observer 
Buzz Bissinger, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and author of the best-selling novel "Friday Night Lights," will be among the distinguished presenters at the 39th annual Notre Dame Literary Festival, tak­ing place at the University from Feb. 13 to 16. 
Bissinger will wrap up the festival on Feb. 16 with a writing workshop at 4 p.m. in the Foster Room of the LaFortune Student Center and a lecture that evening at 7 in Washington Hall. 
The recipient of a Pulitzer Prize for a series of reports for the Philadelphia Inquirer on that city's court system, Bissinger also has written for such publications as Vanity Fair, the New York Times Magazine and Sports Illustrated. Published in 1990, "Friday Night Lights" was released in 2004 as a major motion picture. 

Joining Bissinger on the festival line-up are novelist and short story writer James Salter, humor and mystery writer Kevin Guilfoile, novel­ist Tasha Alexander, slam poet Saul Williams, and poet/playwright Rane Arroyo. 
popular. In 1952 
Jerry Wexler coined the term rhythm and blues, D said, ushering in a whole new era of music. 
Soon, rhythm and blues radio stations were being broadcast nationwide -and it wasn't just blacks who were listening. 
"You think this music is just going to black people?" D said. "Back then, white kids had to sneak it on." 
D cited Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Muddy Waters and Fats Domino as "guys [who] built rock and roll." Although the rock movement of The Beatles, Who and Rolling Stones "[started] all the way across the ocean and had to come over here" and the soul of Ray Charles and James Brown led to the "faster, smoother, more polished rhythms" of disco, D said, it all started in the same place ­American black music. 
"[The music] still comes up from that seed of jazz and blues in Congo Square in New Orleans," he said. 
By the time rappers starting using microphones over disco beats, New York City -where D was a student at Adelphi University on Long Island ­had become a breeding ground for rap music, which D said also takes its roots in the music of the South. 


"It's traced all the way back to being a feeling of love," he said. 
With that understanding, D's group Public Enemy used the power of rap music to spread clean messages to kids in the 80s, especially around the time crack was becoming a major epidemic in mainstream America. 
"We did 'Night of the Living Baseheads' and we knew [kids were listening to it]," he said. "[I thought], 'I'm gonna find out if I can use rap music to make drugs look nasty.' For some reason, [rap] was con­necting [kids'] souls together." 
Today, however, D said that while the music is still reach­ing young people of all colors, it is sending a much different message than back in the time when he began rapping. 
"Obviously, something is propped that doesn't need to be propped," he said. "The industry of thugism [banks on] jail and death ... and jail and death is making a lot of money in this country. It costs you a lot of money to get buried, it costs you a lot of money to get locked down. 
. "Rap music is not a culture. It's a subculture coming from the black culture. Culture is to be shared. Culture comes out of the interaction between human beings," he said. "rBlack people need to] not jump down and dance in the trenches that have been made for us. [Rap has] always been a pull-up music." 
D called for a return of "class and dignity" to be brought back to rap music and the shallow American reality-tele­vision culture, and said change needs to begin with students educating themselves and ask­ing questions about the world around them. 
"The real estate of the mil­lennium is people's minds and people's souls," he said. "Do you control what you feel and see or does it control you? Make your decision and be strong behind it. Control your­self, and leave here with your own mind."

the ship went down with  
more than 1 ,400 people on

some 1,000 fearnd dead.  
Lawmakers ealled for  
investigations and said the  
ship's owner had been  
rnsponsible for previous dis­ 
asters. Egyptian officials  
said the eaptain was miss­

to PowerPoint slides, which can run up to 60 slides per lecture. According to Hausmann, stu­dents commonly print one slide per page by default. 
"Because students don't want to put PowerPoint notes with one slide per page into their class binders, they'll print out the slides again as more manageable handouts with three slides per page," Hausmann said. "The unwanted printout of the slides goes into the recycling bin." · 
Many students defend their on­campus paper usage. 
Junior Katie Marr said she uses campus printers "usually once a week" when she needs to print out documents for class ­including PowerPoint slides ­but is careful in her printing habits. 
"I use what I print, but when I'm done I'll recycle it," Marr said. "I hate it when [students]. print things that they don't need, or print multiple copies." 
Junior Hosemary Walsh said she only uses the printers on campus occasionally, and only in Trumper, the 24-hour student computer lounge located in the basement of the library. 
"[When] I do print, it's not like I waste paper and just print every­thing," Walsh said. "I always use multiple slides per page." 
According to Hausmann, "lack of patience is another complica­tion adding to paper waste." 
Students will print out an item, rush to the printer, not see their printout and go back to the com­puter to print out another copy, Hausmann said. 
According to Hausmann, docu­ments printed in Trumper can be 
sent to one of sev­

er possible," Hausmann said. · One alternative to limiting the 
use and waste of paper on cam­
pus is to hold students responsi­
ble for what they print. IT is con­
sidering charging for printing on 
campus. 
"We are testing a print accounting solution now, and hope to have a trial of the system in place after spring break," Hausmann said. "The trial will not charge students for printing, but let them see how many pages they are printing." 
Hausmann said IT is also look­ing into implementing a quota system that would provide stu­dents with a number of free printed pages before they are charged for printing. The quota and price per page have not been deeided. 
Some students said they would not be pleased if the College decided to implement a charge for printing. 
"Personally I would be [angry] if !the College] charged us because things are expensive enough here as it is," Pinter said. 
Christiano said it would be unfair for students to be charged to print documents when tuition 
costs so much 
already.

Officials ask corporations to lobby against trade ernbargo and invest in energy sector 
Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY -Cuban officials invited U.S. cor­porations Friday to lobby against the U.S. trade embargo and invest in the communist nation's energy sector, as they announced plans to double thli~ir drilling eapaeity and explore for oil in the island's Caribbean waters. 
In the first private-see­tor oil summit between the two countries, execu­tives from U.S. giants like ExxonMobil Corp., Caterpillar Inc. and Valero Energy Corp. were meet­ing with Cuban govern­ment ol'l'icials in Mexico City this week to learn about Cuba's potentially lucrative oil reserves. 
"We would be happy if North Ameriean compa­nies also participated in future projeets," said Haul Perez de Prado, Cuba's vice minister of basic industry. 
U.S. executives should work to "eliminate the absurd barriers" that limit investment. Perez de Prado said, referring to the 45-year-old U.S. trade embargo designed to und1~rmine Fidel Castro's communist government.

a grin that sent waves of laughter rolling throughout the audi-Forty Ounces torium. ''I'd be glad to talk about ranching, but I haven't seen the movie." 
The fact is, the president was probably lucky that he hadn't seen Ang Lee's Oscar-nominated western that brought a whole new meaning to the phrase "ride 'em, cowboy." After all, the over-politi­cization of American life has reached such a sickening level that even ·one of our most cherished national pastimes ­the motion picture industry -has become a political hotbed rife with oppor­tunities for Democrats and Hepublicans to tear at each other's throats. 
For instance, conversations about "Brokeback Mountain" (which, as every­one knows, depicts the tragic love affair between two cowboys) have become so taboo and politicized that a true debate over the merits of the film itself is down­right impossible. Most socially conserva­tive Republicans would not even step into a theater to see it because of the thought that America's manliest profession could be "homosexualized" by the likes of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Most liberal Democrats, on the other hand, have been raving nonstop about its open­minded brilliance and envelope-pushing edginess-even if they have never even seen the movie. 
If you love the movie, you're a "gay­lover." If you hate it, you're a homophobe. 
Ironically, this movie that was supposed to be mind-opening has only proven how close-minded and judgmental Americans can be (on both sides of the political spec­trum). 
To be honest, I thought that "Brokeback Mountain" was one of the most boring, tedious, cheesy films I have seen all year. The love story, while unconventional and at times awkwardly hilarious, seemed forced and unrealistic, and the dialogue made George Lucas sound like Charlie Kaufman. 
Nevertheless, posting this opinion on a liberal blog or newspaper message board like the Daily Kos or the Village Voice would have probably resulted in my being labeled a backstabbing, Bush-lov­ing bigot with as much party loyalty as Joe Lieberman. · But that's the reality of political life in modern America. It's as if everywhere you go and everything you do -grocery shopping, church-going, football playing, movie watching -someone is reading you your political Miranda rights and "anything that you say can and will be used against you" in the public forum. Even worse, the possibilities for modera­tion and personal decision in life -such as being a practicing Catholic who sup­ports a woman's right to choose or per­haps hating "Brokeback Mountain" while supporting policies like the legalization of gay marriage-are all but nonexistent. After all, that would involve conciliation, free thought, personal decision, and, worst of all, flip-flopping. 
As a result of this depressing and stressful situation, even a simple trip to the movies has become a metaphoric vote for Democrat or Republican. Case in point: The five films nominated for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards are all in some way politically motivated and in most cases expressions of liberal political thought. "Brokeback Mountain," as already discussed, is a clear outcry for social tolerance ofhomosexuality. "Capote," a biographical tale of the flam­boyant author Truman Capote, also dab­bles into the subject of homosexuality in middle America. "Crash," which in my opinion blows its four other competitors out of the water, is a brilliantly weaved story of racial tension and intolerance in one of America's most diverse cities ­Los Angeles. Stephen Spielberg's annual contribution to the awards, "Munich," is a dramati~depiction of the violent after­math of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. Finally, "Good Night, and Good Luck," the story of jour­nalist Edward R. Murrow's bold challenge to McCarthyism during the Hed Scare, was deliberately written by George Clooney to encourage the media to "ask tough questions of anyone in power." 
And there you have it: the gay vote, the minority vote, the Jewish vote, and the "liberal media" vote. No matter who wins the Oscar at this year's ceremony, the · Democratic Party will certainly come out on top. (If only our presidential candi­dates could have this kind of success rate.) 
Beyond a n~iteration of the cliche that Hollywood preaches to the liberal choir, though, this politicization of the film industry and one of our most cherished forms of mindless entertainment is only something that will further divide an America that is already starting to resem­ble a blue Orno stuiTed with way too much red cream. As George Washington warned in his legendary farewell address, "The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dis­sension ... is in itself a frightful despot­ism." 
And the first step toward ending this factionalized despotism? Nominating a film for Best Picture that all of America can appreciate and enjoy -like "Walk the Line." 
Or, at the very least, "Miss Congeniality 
2: Armed and Fabulous."

'Monologues' provide rape education 
Restricting academic freedom puts Notre Dame's students at a disadvan­tage. Students do not choose to attend a Catholic institution in hopes of being sheltered from the secular world. Rather, these institutions are chosen in hopes of making sense of the outside world with the help of a Catholic view­point. By restricting and removing con­troversial elements from Notre Dame, the University misses an opportunity to address many of the issues important to Catholics today. 
By omitting the fundraising element from "The Vagina Monologues," the University is not simply making a state­ment about the forbidden acts of mas­turbation and homosexuality, but also about its disregard for sexual violence against women. The entire premise of the "Vagina Monologues" is to end the oppression of women's sexuality and

violence against women. Not including these materials in an academic setting sends the message to students that the excluded information is of no impor­tance. It is highly disappointing to me that Notre Dame is sending a message of violence and intolerance to its stu" dents. As a woman in the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community, that not only upsets me, but also makes me afraid. 
In a society where rape is often times still considered the woman's fault, it is discouraging to have Father John Jenkins question the play's morality. Male students at Notre Dame have sex­ually assaulted many female students at both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, and instead of giving these women back their dignity, the University is on a track that continues to take it away.

given to local women's shelters, Notre Dame is adding to ignorance while simultaneously hurting the organiza­tions that aid abused women, including some of its own students. Hape is not a women's issue; it is society's issue. It is the responsibility of everyone to edu­cate and demonstrate that rape and sexual assault are wrong. One required lecture during Freshman Orientation is not enough. There is more to "The Vagina Monologues" than masturbation. Giving a voice to the abused and oppressed is a part of Catholic teaching, and it's a shame that Notre Dame is not following this example.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Zahm apologizes for disrespectful behavior 
To Our Notre Dame Family, 
We arc NI>. Wn chant it over and over again at everything from football pop rallies to late night eolf~brations. We w<~ar it proudly on dass shirts and we sign our dass o-mails with it. Simply put. this phrasn nneompasses everything about who we are and what we stand for-our faith, our solidarity, our spirit -our commitment to tho values and imago of Our Lady's University. 
You son us all around campus making noise and wearing rod. We aro Zahm II all-or "!louse" as some of us like to call it. And despite our love and eommit­mont to and as a part of the Notre Dame Family, we have taken it upon ourselves to call attention to a group that dissents from that family. It's time to set the record straight. 
We are an extrmnely proud dorm. We are proud of our history, our beautiful homo. our sports teams, our spirit, our cornrnitmnnt to works of charity and our involvement in community programs. The look on someone's face when they learn we're from Zahm, or the stares we get at pep rallies and sporting events are proof that, love us or hate us, we're completely different from any other dorm on campus in a very special way. 
Recently, some of the men of Zahm have come to realize that all of these things that we're proud or don't matter at all in light of what our reputation has become. It doesn't matter how many activities we participate in or how well we do in competitions. What matters is our biggest cause for pride, our reputa­tion, has slowly dign~ssed into a cause for other dorms to hate us and ridicule us and for this wonderful University to look down on us and discipline us. While the damage has come at the hands of the minority of our residents, we recog­nize that the majority of the dorm has done little to stop it. As a dorm we have talked about ways to re-establish the position we earned as one of the best dorms at Notre Dame, and it begins with an apology. 
Here and now, we the men of Zahm Hall, as students at the University of Notre Dame and members of the Notre Dame Family, want to express our deep­est apologies for our continued disre­spectful bnhavior. We're sorry for giving you all the reasons you need to hate Zahm. We truly value your respect and friendship, but also realize they must be earned. From this point on, we will do just that. 
We've decided as a dorm to move for­ward in a positive way. We'll still be the craziest dorm on campus. We'll still put 110 percent into every event that we're involved in. Essentially, we'll still do everything that makes us Zahm llall. The only thing that will change is our disrespect for the amazing opportunities that Notrn Dame has given us and oth­ers who are lucky enough to call them­selves Domers. As we move forward in becoming who we should be as a dorm community, we ask that you support us in our mission to rejoin the Notre Damn Family in nvery aspect. 
Here at Notre Dame, we are among the b<~st students from around the world. We have so much pride in who we are, what we stand for, and what W<~ accomplish. Zahm II all is just one small part of what makes Notrn Damn groat, and we are committed to strnngthnning our relationship with tho Notre Dame Family from this day forward. So when you hear us yelling "We.are Zahm Hall," know that deep inside all or our hearts that phrase echoes with "We are ND," and we hope that it edwes in yours as well. 
Yours in Notrn Dame, 
The Men of Zahm Hall

While I could comment on the proper applkation of truth and academic frnn­dorn involv<~d in Father John Jenkins' limiting of "Tiw Vagina Monologues" on mmpus, I wish to focus upon why I bdieve that the "Monologues" is compati­hln rwither with the Catholic faith nor with iL-; organizers' own goals. A-; Jenkins stated in his speech to students, there are plnnty of noble objectives underlying the V-J>ay movement. These indude the elim­ination of violen1:e against women and upholding the value of womanhood and fmnale sexuality. A-; h<L'l been stated, I think all sides ean a1,rree that the preemi­rwnt goals of stopping violence against women and helping vktimized women to hnal nend to be taken seriously and strongly promotnd. The Catholic stance is overwhelmingly in litvor of this agenda. 
llownver, thn means by which the "Monologues" attmnpt.s to achieve these goals sufli1rs from an incredibly danger­<HJS flaw-it holps to fwd and perpetuate a masculine view of women as sexual ohjncL-; rather than <L'l dignified persons to bn nqually mspected and protected. It dons so by portraying the female per­limners predsely as sexual things whose personhood ean bn equated with their vagina-;. I understand that many women li~nl that the play is a form of art that mmblns a cathartic emotional release on tim part of women who have been victim­ized and need to find a sense of security and community. Nonetheless, the manner in whkh this is achieved only serves to nntnmch partidpanl-; even further within It culture of sexual commodity. 
Why do you suppose so many men attend the "Monologues'?" None of them, I would imaJ.,rinn, are seeking the healing from the play that many female viewers desire to reeeivn. And I would wager that a relatively small number of the men attm1d solnly out of deep feelings of mnpathy lhr the plight of victimized women. Hathnr. I am willing to assnrt­and phmty of my male friends agree­that many, many guys arn attracted to tho "Monologues" li1r iL-; patently risque nature. The play may not be intended a-; pornographi<: or hot<~roorotie, but a voynuristic male nwntality can bn arous1~d by even tho most innoeent or artisti<: immmli~sty, not to mention J.,rraph­k sexual descriptions and dnpictions. 
Tlw women assodatnd with the "Monologues" havn to understand that Llw wntlmt of thn play eaters to the ba-;n sexual pm;sions of malo viewers, and so 
'Monologues' not compatible with goals 
Libertarian confusion 
Although I have very much enjoyed read­ing the recent string of Notre Dame Libertarian viewpoinl<; and letters, I feel that each of these writings ha-; consistently misrepresented libertarianism in some way. 
For example, the most recent letter to the editor, sponsored by the group itself, con­fuses political libertarianism with personal preference. The article begins with an accurate explanation that Notre Dame can "censor" all that it wants as a private prop­erty owner. This is where libertarian politi­cal doctrine stops. Its purpose is to empha­size self-government, so that any individual can censor or not censor to their heart's desire. 
However, the letter devolves into a advo­cating a fairly subjective social opinion that Notre Dame should allow all kinds of expression, no matter the type. This state­ment is woeful because of two glaring prob­lems. First, it has nothing to do with politi­callibertarianism and thus the "Libertarian" group on campus is wrongly identifying a social opinion with the political party. This will only confuse those unfamil­iar with libertarianism and will drive away good moral pnople who believe in certain kinds of"censorship." 
Second, and perhaps even more impor­tantly, the letter is attacking a straw man. Notre Dame is not censoring anything. The 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
only en~ouragns us to think of women as sexual toys. I'm sure nearly all male viewers on campus are opposed to vio­lence against women, but the play does not offer us an outlet whereby we can begin to treat women as they are ­equally intelligent human persons with graceful souls and beautiful bodies that must be honored and cherished. Even if only women were involved in the produc­tion and viewing of the "Monologues," they would be damaging their own strug­gle to gain a dignified image in society. This is because the play teaches women to think and act in such a manner that will cause men to believe that women really want to be perceived merely as attractive flesh defined by sexual experi­lmces. 
For these reasons, the Monologues do not offer true freedom to women; instead, women are unwittingly enslaving them­selves to the oversexed and self-gratifying culture that urges men to shun the responsibility and commitment that women so earnestly desire from them. 
Therefore, many of us at the University of Notre Dame will not endorse the "Monologues." But we are are still more than willing to lend our efforts in stopping violence against women from a Catholic approach. Uke Christ, the Church is countereultural-"a sign that will be contradicted" (Lk 2:34) by the world in all ages. It is relatively unpopular and ineonvenient to live out Catholicism today, but the Church's teaching on human per­sons has the good and truth of the body and interpersonal relationships in mind. 
Female persons should never be deni­~-,rrated as trivial possessions to be used, but this will become a reality only if we promote a model imploring men to respect and be thankful for "women as they have come forth from the heart of God, in all the b1~auty and richness of their femininity" {John Paul II). And the hmtling of wronged women will be most fulfilling if they arn treated with the rev­enmtial deference that femininity deserves. 
The Church tries to say to each woman, "You are not merely a body that needs to bn liberated, but a c:omplete person who must be loved." llopnfully, both sides can and will work tognthcr to advaneo this li~minine model on campus.

studenL-; can limn any number of groups (unollieial or not), wear any shirt they want (barring extreme ollimsivonoss or lewd­ness), study any kind of play no matter how libertine, and even perli1rm that play for the purposes of study and rellm:tion. They are only denied the aiTirmativo use of University sponsorship through the grant of il<; facilities when the University disap­proves of the subject matter. Even this is qualifiod, since Notre Damn really just wants to limit such activities from being open to the public through il-; own faeilitins. It would bn morally and intnllndually dis­honest if the administration sponsored groups or activities that it truly felt worn harmful to Catholieism or Christianity. This is no dillernnt from me refusing to allow studelll'> to perform the Vagina Monologues in my home. Criticism that thn University should ehange il-; decision making appara­tus is of course valid, but should be well­reasoned and avoid misdirnd1~d platitudes about censorship and frne-spnneh. 
This second point seems to be lost on far too many studenl'l. I have to wonder if they even read Father John Jenkins' spnneh, which covers the issuo quit1~ thoroughly.

Call of Duty 2 
The "Call of Duty" franchise has established itself as one of the premier World War II first person shooters on the market, which is no easy task in that crowded market. "Call of Duty 2" had many expectations placed upon it before it was released, and while not as fresh as the original, it is one really one of the first WW II games to give that feeling like the bullets are flying by and the enemy is close at hand. 
Graphically the game is up there with best of the launch titles. Buildings crumble and tanks lurch thru t.he snow or desert in the game's many diverse campaign locations in a pleasing way. There is the feeling that no game at this point has really tapped into what the Xbox 360 has to offer. The level design is fairly wide and open and there never is the sense that the character is following some sort of narrow path. 
Where this game really shines however, is when the A.l. Enemies duck and cover, fall back when the odds are against them or surge forward when they see a decisive advantage. 
The members of the accompanying squad are also fairly intelligent. Most of the time they are more than just vacant polygons, as they communicate enemy position, curses, taunts and orders. 
Out of all the games that are available for the Xbox 360, "Call of Duty 2" is probably the best of the launch lot, at least in terms of consistency. 
Overall rating: A-
Perfect Dark Zero 
With almost six years having past since the original Nintendo 64 hit and spiritual successor to "Goldeneye," one would think that developer Rare would have a polished killer­app on their hands. Unfortunately, "Perfect Dark Zero" is not that killer-app that the Xbox 360 needs. 
ln.terms of story, the game takes place prior to the original game. It fails to engage or have relevance, and the cheesy dia­logue and poor voice acting in cut-scenes leaves much to be desired. 
The single player campaign is marred by the awful level design. However, the developers seem to have been aware of this fact. After wandering around aimlessly on the same level, even on harder difficulty levels, the game plots a big trail of flashing blue lines and arrows on the ground to lead to the final destination. 
The graphics are a mixed-bag at times. The images shine, literally, and the game has a plastic sheen to it that takes some getting used to. There are also frame rate issues, mak­ing the game run at only 30 FPS most of the time. The charac­ter design is at times cartoonish as well. 
Multiplayer for the large part is where feel the game redeems itself. Its laundry-list of features is longer and better than "Halo 2." Online, the game includes currently up 32 players to each game and the much touted online Co-op did make the cut. Strangely enough, enemy A.I. is much more competent and stealthy than in single-player. 
Playing the Dark Ops and various multiplayer options online and offiine really has that old "Goldeneye"/ "Perfect Dark" feeling well. 
Overall, it is a solid if not above average first person shoot­er, but it could have been so much more of a complete and eonsistent experience. 
Overall rating: B+ 
STORIES B y MARK B E M E N 

The future is here. At least, that is what Microsoft would lead garners to believe. On Nov. 22, they released the latest generation of video game consoles, the Xbox 360. 
Released to some fanfare, the sys­tem sold out almost immediately at most retailers. For a while, the only way to purchase the system was over online auctions, with prices reaching upwards of a thousand dollars. Certainly a great degree of hype led to this system frenzy. But now that the initial rush has passed, many questions as to the system's merits are rising. 
From a technology standpoint, the 360 doesn't represent the leap that was evident in the previous console generations. Like the previous Xbox, it comes with a dual-layer DVD player. While an effective vehicle for data storage at this time, games are quickly becoming larger, multi-mil­lion dollar enterprises. More recent technologies, such as Blu-Ray disks, would have been a better choice. 
As it is, many games will either have to span multiple disks, or make extensive use of the hard-drive. However, the hard-drive only comes with the more expensive bundle at this point in time. 
Releasing two different bundles in this fashion may prove to be a mis­take on Microsoft's part. Despite the fact that the lesser of the bundles is more economically feasible, it's a poor choice in the long run for most garners. Some games require the hard-drive to function, and the demos obtainable over Xbox Live won't work without it. 
Like the PlayStation 2, the 360 is backwards compatible, meaning that it will play games from the orig­inal Xbox. However, the compatibili­ty is limited, and only works with a limited library of games. It also requires the hard-drive, and access to Live to download the necessary patches to run properly. 
Graphically, the system does rep­resent a leap over the current gen­eration of games. Multi-platform games, such as "Peter Jaekon's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie" and "Gun," are noticeably improved on the Xbox 360. The graphics are sharper, with less obvi­ous slowdown during the hardware intensive moments. 

The graphics don't seem to be a major leap however. Some games, such as "Doom III" and "Hesident Evil 4," don't seem that far ofT from the games showcased on the 360. Computer gaming has been operat­ing at the same level of the 360 for some time now as well, with exam­ples being "Half-Life 2" and "F.E.A.R." 
When the Nintendo 64 was released, and the Dreamcast in the following generation, there was an obvious leap in content and abilities. The leap isn't quite as sharp this time around. 
That doesn't seem to be Microsoft's focus however. With the 360, their focus has been heavily placed upon online gaming. There are two different methods of getting online for garners. There is the Silver Membership, which allows garners to get online for free, but they are unable to aceess most of the features available. 
Most garners will find the Gold Membership to be a better choice. Despite costing more, online garners can download demos of future games for free, play online only games and join in on more of the Live community features. Players can customize their profile as they want, and Live is much more versa­tile in its 360 incarnation. 
Microsoft is also placing a lot more emphasis on a personalized gaming experience that extends beyond the Live community. The 360 has an interchangeable face­plate that can be customized in a variety of ways. 

The controller was left relatively untouched from its previous itera­tion. Microsoft kept the format of the Controller S, the smaller of the two first-party controllers. This helps keep garners from being alien­ated by a new control scheme, and lowers the learning curve. 
It should be noted that, like the first release of every console system so far, the 360 release was ham­pered by a number of defective units. A number of units suffered from freezing issues, or they would simply stop working outright. A number of complaints arose from disk scratching issues. The limited supply of 360's meant that most people who purchased one would have to wait a significant amount of time for a replacement. Some peo-

Being the 360's soJe game in the lighting genre, it helps to flesh out the library and should find a wel­eome spot in most gamer's library. Featuring a solid fighting system, some new eharaeters, and a sur­prise combatant from th11 "Halo" series of games, it's a great addition to tho pre-existing library. 
llowovor, there have been rela­tively few, if any, worthwhile games that have come out in the two months since its release. The sehed­uled release dates don't show too many games on the horizon, with only a handful planned for the few months. 
This is typical of any new console rnlease however. The PlayStation 2 had few must-have titles for the first year of its life-cycle, as did the Xbox. This should not come as a surprise to most garners, as they are used to the famine that follows the initial feast of games.

monts, powerful weaponry, detailed graphies and an exeellent Live expe­rience, "Full Auto" bears watehing. 
The next worthwhile game is the latest in Eleetronie Art's established franchise, "Fight Night Round 3." The preliminary screenshots for the game have revealed solid graphies that are near photo-realistie, and the developers have promised the most robust boxing experienee to date. Previous games in the "Fight Night" series were solid efl'orts, and video game tradition holds that this latest iteration will follow suit. 
The two main draws of the fledg­ling system, "Gears of War" and "Halo 3" do not have specific release dates at this moment. The main draws of the original Xbox were the action titles that could be played online, and the same looks to be true for the 360. 
"Gears of War" features a post­apocalyptie setting in which the human race is a shadow of what it used to be. Monsters have appeared out of the Earth, and only a few places on the planet are safe. The player assumes the role of an elite commando in a squad of humans. It's a heavily cooperative game, as the early reports tell that the gamer will have to heavily rely upon team­work and tactics to survive. Due to this, it will feature a cooperative mode between two or more gamers but exaet details are unknown. 
The aee in Microsoft's hole, the "Halo" franchise, also has no set release date. Early reports are still vague, with rumors and myths far outweighing any faetual information at this time. Videos have been leaked, but most have been proven to frauds. The rumored release date is said to eoineide with the release of the PlayStation 3, but no oflicial solid promises have been made. In any case, this showdown promises plenty of drama.

King Kong 
Quite simply, this game is a rush to play. 
There are two modes of play, the first of whieh is onn whern the player assumes the role of the seriptwriter from tlw movie, Jack Driseoll. Being merely human, the dangers hn faces on Skull Island prove to be massive and lifi1 thrnatnning. The first time a player faces ofl' against a dinosaur can be a gripping, trieky experience. 
Some small arms can be aequired.-but unlike most first-per­son games, ammunition is extremely limitnd. This forees garners to become aequaintnd with the most popular weapon on Skull Island, the spear. Throwing a spear fenls surprisingly realistic, as it falls over distancn due to gravity, and creaturns react aecordingly when hit. Some of the most exciting eneoun­ters oeeur with only a spear in the player's grip. 
The enemies in the game vary from giant insects to thn dinosaurs themselves. Minor ernaturos in thn movie, such as the giant bats, play a much larger role in the game. 
Playing as King Kong makes up the other mode of game­play, and this mode presents one of the most unique, exciting experienees seen in recent video game history. lin truly feels and behaves as the player would expect, and fighting oil' giant dinosaurs is an experience most garners will not want to miss. 
The other eharacters in the movie are present, and ren­dered well. Jack Blaek's character looks, acts and sounds realistically, adding to the game's immersive qualities. 
Overall, "King Kong" is a blast to play, and a real trnat for any fan of the movie. Other gamers would bn rnmiss to avoid the game as well, sinee it's tmly a unique experience.

Comdemned: Criminal Origins 
"Condemned" is probably one of the best-looking launeh titles on the Xbox 360. A"> first-person survival horror game, blood splatters in a fantastic fashion and bashing the !wads of' foes in results in concussions that are both thoroughly detailed and wonderfully realistic. 
The atmosphere of "Condemned: Criminal Origins" is vnry chilling and there are a numbnr of moments of sheer tnrror. Playing the game in the dark, or alone for that matter, is not reeommended. 
The game's main character, Ethan Thomas, is an FBI agnnt who is quiekly thrown into the undnrbolly of a rotting city while pursuing a sadistic serial killer. A"> thn game progrnssns Ethan begins to question his own sanity and hallucinate, which plays nicely into the enf.,1'J'ossing story. 
Ethan's gun is lost early on in the gamn and tho weapons obtained later on have little ammo to work with. Instead, Ethan must rely on pipes and objects limnd or rippnd from walls. In melee eombat all of these itnms have pluses and minuses. 
Level design is fairly good, and features sennes like rodent infested department stores and long forgotten subways. Despite this, however, the game gets a little repntitive towards the end as Ethan doses in on the killer. It senms that nvnn hacking a murderous hobo's arm ofl' loses its charm aftnr while. Also a downside the game is fairly short -it only took a handful of hours to eomplete the first timn through. 
The designers put a lot of collectiblns to find in "Condemned," but just don't expect to be playing long into the late hours of the night-not that the heart could take it.

DETHOIT -Paint this Super Bowl black and gold. With a whole lot of satis­faction for Bill Cowher and his Pittsburgh Steelers. 
Throw in a little trickery featuring MVP I lines Ward, a bunch of help from the Seattle Seahawks and a huge boost from the Terrible Towels, and the Steelers won the Super Bowl 21-10 Sunday. 
Moments al'ter the Holling Stones rocked a Ford Field that could easily have been Heinz Field ­or llines' field -Willie Parker broke a record 75­yard touchdown run. 
The Steelers earned that elusive fifth championship ring and their first since 1980, completing a magic Bus ride that made Jerome Bettis' homecoming-and farewell -a success. 
''I'm a champion. I think the Bus' last stop is here in Detroit," Bettis said. "It's official, like the referee whistle." 
On this night, satisfaction was more than Mick Jagger's signature song that closed the halftime show. 
It was sweet validation for Cowher with a title in his 14th season as their coach, the longest tenure in the NFL. The tough guy, who lost his only previous Super Bowl 1 0 years ago to Dallas, teared up as he walked to midfield to embrace Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren. 
"A lot of people tell you you can't do it, but you know what, it doesn't mean you don't go out and try," Cowher said. "History was not going to determine our fate. Our effort today decided this game and that's what's great. 
"It's surreal. I'm going to tell you, this is a special group of coaches, a special group of players. I was mw small part of this." 
Pittsburgh tied San Francisco and Dallas with its five Super Bowl titles. 
Perhaps the most spm:ial moment for Cowher canH~ when he presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to 73-ynar-old owner Dan Hooney. 
"''ve bnen waiting a long time to do this," Cowher said. "This is yours, man." 
The Stnnlers cnrtainly got plonty of help from the Seahawks. Soattle was plagued by penalties, drops, poor dock manage­ment nnd <t critical fourth­quarter intorenption of Matt Jlassnlbnek. 

IN BRIEF 
Saints announce return to 
Superdome in September 
NEW OHLEANS -The New Orleans Saints will play the Atlanta Falcons on Sept. 24 in the first event scheduled for the Louisiana Superdome since it was heavily dam­aged by Hurricane Katrina. 
A mural with the news was com­pleted on the outside of the Superdome just bofore the start of Sunday's Super Bowl in Detroit between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks. The mural con­tains the date of the game, helmet logos of both teams and a "Go Saints" slogan. 
"We are pleased that this historic reopening will feature the annual renewal of the traditional Falcons­Saints rivalry," NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. 
Superdome spokesman Bill Curl confirmed Sunday night that the game would be the first event of any kind to be held in the venue since Katrina struck on Aug. 29. 
Dementieva downs Hingis 
to end comeback effort 
TOKYO -Martina llingis got a taste of the power game in women's tennis, losing her first singles linctl since making her comeback. 
The Swiss star, who has five Grand Slam singles titles, had no answer for ninth-ranked Elena Demcntieva's big serves and returns, falling 6-2, 6-0 Sunday in the final of the Pan Pacific Open. 
llingis upset No. 4 Maria Sharapova in the semifinals, but she was broken three times in the first set and had a series of unforced errors in her fourth tour­nament of 2006 after a three-year retirement. 
With the tone set early, Dementieva took the last three games of the set. 
''I'm not looking for any excuses," llingis said. "She was just too good today. I've had a very good start to my comeback and I will go home with my head up."

"I told the players it's hard for me to get excited about that vic­tory," Thompson said, "thinking about those last couple of min­utes." 
Gray scored all of his 15 points in the first half and went 0-for-4 with three turnovers against the matchup zone in the second. He also finished with 11 rebounds. Carl Krauser and Ramon each added 11 points for the Panthers (17-3, 6-3), who led 33-18 in the first half and 35-28 at halftime. 
It's been a strength of ours, executing against the zone," Panthers coach Jamie Dixon said. "We didn't do as good a job today .... The key was that we didn't finish off the first half. We should have been up by more." 
Pittsburgh lost at No. 1 Connecticut last week and has dropped three of five -all on the road -after a 15-0 start. No. 11 West Virginia is next on Thursday. 
"Teams lose," Dixon said. "It's how you respond, and we've always responded well." 
Kansas 59, Oaklahoma 58 
Here's a rare sight: Kansas, of all schools, playing the no respect card. 
Unranked all season with a team made up almost entirely of freshmen and sophomores, the Jayhawks won their fifth straight Sunday, using a stirring comeback from a 16-point sec­ond-half deficit to beat No. 19 Oklahoma. 

George Washington 80, Richmond 55 
George Washington played the way it wanted to and patient Richmond never had a chance. 
The 1Oth-ranked Colonials, who average over 80 points per game, got the tempo going their way early and beat Richmond. 
The Spiders entered the game second in the nation in scoring defense at 53.5 points per game but George Washington used its defense to set the tone. 
"Our defense allowed the game to be played at a much faster pace and I think that was the difference," Colonials coach Karl Hobbs said. 
Pops Mensah-Bonsu and Danilo Pinnock each scored 16 points and Mike Hall added 15 for George Washington (18-1, 8­0 Atlantic 10), which won its lOth straight and moved within one win of matching the best start in the program's history. 
Kevin Steenberge lead the Spiders (11-10, 4-4) with 15 points and 10 rebounds. 
The Colonials took control with a 19-4 first-half run and they dictated the pace to the Spiders by pressuring them at both ends of the court. The Colonials forced 14 first-half turnovers that lead to 12 points, most of them in transition. 
"Our intensity was terrific," Hobbs said. "I thought we forced them to have to play the way we wanted them to play. They had been able to dictate their style of play against every­one and we wanted to make sure that they had to play the way we wanted them to play."

Quick start propels Calvin past Saint Mary's 

By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Calvin College opened up the game against Saint Mary's with nine points in three minutes and never looked back, not allowing the Belles to tie the game in a 76­64 win over Saint Mary's Saturday. 
The Belles did make things interesting in the first half, clos­ing the gap to five points with seven minutes left until intermis­sion, but the No. 14 Knights bat­tled back with a 9-2 run and entered halftime with a 35-23 lead. The Belles did try to respond in the second half, but could only cut the lead to eight points before Calvin would again deny any comebacks by going 3­for-3 from the floor and 12-for­14 on foul shots to cement the

Irish drop a pair to ranked foes 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
So close, and yet so far away. 

The Irish struggled on the road this weekend, dropping two 4-3 matches to No. 30 North Carolina and No. 9 Duke. 
But there is little rest in sight for Notre Dame, as the Irish travel to No. 4 Illinois Tuesday. 
"There's a toughening process that comes with play­ing great teams," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "At some point, you have to realize it's your turn and that you're not satisfied with coming close. And I can tell you no one here is satisfied with coming close." 
North Carolina 4 Notre Dame 3 
Despite an upset of the nation's No. 1 doubles team by Ryan Keckley and Barry King, the Irish were unable to pull out a win over North Carolina in Chapel Hill Saturday. 
"They were really hard fought," Bayliss said of the individual matches. "Carolina fights extremely well. Their crowd, they had a big crowd, they were very vocal. The level of intensity was extremely high, just every match, tooth and nail, was really hard fought." 
In doubles, Stephen Bass and Eric Langenkamp were first off the courts, losing 8-4 at No. 3. Brett Helgeson and Sheeva Parbhu followed with an 8-5 loss, giving the point to the Tar Heels. After North Carolina had clinched the point, Keckley and King won at No. 1 with an 8-4 defeat over Ryan Luchici and Brad Pomeroy, the nation's No. 1 doubles team. 
In singles, Patrick Buchanan won 6-2, 6-4 at No. 6 to tie the score at 1-1. However, Helgeson was forced to retire at No. 4, trailing 7-6 (7-4), 3-0. 
"I ie was up 5-4 in the first set and he began to cramp and '"v ~_;ramps got worse, he final­!) had to retire," Bayliss said. 
·11e needed two IVs and was in t'1e emergency room." Down 2-1, the Irish rallied ,1ith a win at No. 5 from 
vho improved to 5-0 in the uu.. match season. His 4-6, 6-0, 7-5 victory came before King fell 1-6, 6-3, -3 at No.3. 
The Tar Heels clinched the match at No. 1, when No. 5 Luchici defeated Bass -cur­rently ranked No. 8 nationally -by a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 margin. 
Bass's close loss was also sig· nificant in the context of last year's match between the two players. · 
"Stephen lost pretty badly to [Luchici] a year ago and now all of a sudden he's really in a war with him, and it really shows the progress he's made," Bayliss said. 
Parbhu won the final match on the courts, defeating Derek Porter to win 2-6, 7 -6(7 -5), 6­
2. 

Duke 4, Notre Dame 3 
With a revamped doubles lineup, the Irish won the dou­bles point from powerhouse Duke but couldn't put away the Blue Devils in another close defeat. 
"We changed our doubles comb[ination] because Brett wasn't able to go," Bayliss said. "The team we beat at third doubles had won against Illinois and for the second day in a row, our No. 1 team IKeckley and King] had a real big win." 
Keckley and King were first off the courts with a dominat­ing 8-2 victory at No. 1. Langenkamp, paired with Andrew Roth, won 8-5 at No. 3 to clinch the point for the Irish, despite an 8-6 loss by Bass and Parbhu at No. 2 doubles. 
Keckley was again a stand­out player for the Irish, with wins in both doubles and sin­gles despite an Irish loss to the Blue Devils. 
In singles, Helgeson fell 6-0, 6-1 at No. 3, his first time in that position. King lost at No. 4 in straight sets of 6-4, 6-4, and Duke pulled away 3-1 with a win at No. 6 as lrackli Akhvlediani lost 6-3, 6-2. 
However, the Irish rebound­ed as No. 14 Parbhu topped No. 20 Jonathan Stoke 4-6, 6­4, 6-1 at No.2. 
"That was a great win for Sheeva today," Bayliss said. "[Stoke is] a top-20 player in college tennis. At Duke, indoors at home, he doesn't lose very often. Sheeva really returned serve well ... he real­ly had to step up to the plate and hit the ball with authority." 
Keckley tied the score at 3-3 with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-0 win at No. 5. 
"Keckley deserves a ton of credit," Bayliss said, explaining that Keckley's singles oppo­nent, Kiril Dimitrov, recently came to Duke from Bulgaria and had performed well in pro­fessional tournaments there. "[Keckley] really played an unbelievably great third set, he played with a lot of courage today ... he found different ways to get to the net, he used his slice backhand, he served and volleyed -he really just kept him on his heels the whole match." 
However, Bass fell to No. 9 Ludovic Walter in a hotly con­tested 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 match to give the victory to the Blue Devils. 
"One guy who deserves a lot of credit is [Bass] for putting in the effort at that position against some of the best play­ers in the country day after day," Bayliss said. "I know he's crushed with the outcome with some of the recent matches, but a year ago he wasn't com­petitive against some of these people and now he's right here toe-to-toe." 
The Irish have one day of rest before traveling to Illinois Tuesday. 
"As disappointing and crushed as we are with the results, we're ready to go," Bayliss said.

win. 
Four of the Belles' five starters had double digit points, but still could not overcome the large deficit established early in the game. Moreover, the Belles were not as strong as Calvin on the glass, as they were out-rebound­ed 36-23. Saint Mary's also shot only 38.6 percent from the floor, compared to Calvin's 52.3 per­cent. 
Starting point guard Bridget Lipke, in her third game back since she injured her ankle in a Jan. 18 game against Ablien, shot 1-for-7 from the floor and grabbed two rebounds with five assists in 35 minutes. In the three games Lipke has played since returning from her injury, she has shot 6. 7 percent from the floor. 
Overall, the Belles felt they played well, particularly in light of their many recent successes. 
"We gave a good efl'ort against Calvin," forward Shelly Bender said. "But we have to rebound for the rest of the season." 
In spite of the loss, the Belles are still in a good position going into the MIAA postseason at 1 0­12 and 8-5 in conference. With only three games to go, the Belles are guaranteed to be at least .500 in conference, their best fin­ish in five years. More important­ly, it gives the Belles the chance to host a first round playofl' game at Angela Athletic Center if they can win one more conference game, which Bender thinks they can do against Kalamazoo (6-13, 3-9) next Saturday.

TRACK AND FIELD 
Erigha, Benninger excel in dash, run 
By JORDAN BELTZ Sports Writer 
At the country's largest meets, the biggest stars often shine. Notre Dame has several bright stars, and that was evident with their performances over the weekend at the prestigious Meyo Invitational at the Loftus Sports Center. 
Several members of the Irish squad turned in remarkable performances against some of the top competitors in the nation. 
Maryann Erigha turned in a sparkling performance in the women's sprints. Erigha took home the title in the women's 60-meter dash, and in doing so she set a new Notre Dame 
,record with a time of 7.42 sec­onds. Erigha also ran the women's 200-meter dash, fin­ishing second with a time of 
23.74 seconds. Both marks were good enough to provision­ally qualify her for the NCAA championships. 
Junior Kurt Benninger turned in yet another solid showing, this time in the men's 3000­meter run. Benninger opted not to run the mile, the signature event of the meet, in favor of challenging the defending NCAA champion -Michigan sopho­more Mike Woods. 
He turned the 3000-meter run into the most exciting event of the meet, waging a thrilling duel with Woods. Woods ended up passing Benninger on the final lap and the Irish junior finished second with a time of 7:52.27. Benninger's mark obliterated the Notre Dame record in the 3000 by a full two seconds and earned him an automatic berth in the NCAA Championships. 
In the meet's signature event, the Meyo Mile, Pittsburgh stand­out Sam Bair, Jr. held off a pack of four other challengers to win with a time of 4:01.22. His father Sam Sr. ran a sub-four minute mile for Kent State in the 1970s and Bair Jr. came just short of making the duo the first father-son tandem to achieve the mark.

managed only six points. 

"We did a great job on her; I was really pleased," McGraw said. "We were worried about being able to play man-to-man on her because she's quick and she can drive the ball. And I thought our post did an excellent job on her all around -man, zone, whatever we were in." 
Providence coach Phil Seymore said the Irish defense on Nwafili made it impossible for the Friars to compete. 
"II" she's not scoring, say your prayers," Seymore said of Nwafili. 'They outmatched us physically, and just basketball-wise, they're better ... They are just more tal­ented than we are." 
Notre Dame's main presence in the post was Courtney LaVere. The senior had two blocks and shut down Nwafili-and she kept that suecess going on the other side of the court, hitting 9-of-1 0 !rom the floor for 18 points. 
At 6-foot-3, LaVere said she planned to take advantage of her size against Providence. 
"I knew there was going to be a lot of mismatches, so I thought I'd be able to score in the block a lot easier," she said. "It was nice that I hit my shots. It got me in a rhythm for the whole game." 
The Irish established control of the game midway through the first half and steadily increased their lead the rest of the way. 
With the game tied at 12 with 
14:27 remaining in the opening half, LaVere hit a jumper at the top of the key, and Notre Dame had the lead for good. 
Largely behind the hustle play of Charel Allen and Tulyah Gaines, the Irish extended their advantage to 39-28 by intermission. Allen finished with 10 points, eight

things right on both sides of the ball and earning its 66-48 win over Providence. And the change in month may have brought the team a renewed sense of confidence. 
"We talked about that a few days ago, how we were really glad it was February, and hopefully as a team we're a lit­tle more focused," senior guard Megan Duffy said. 
In truth, Saturday's disman­tling of Big East cellar-dweller Providence is what should have happened, and the fact that the Irish were able to consistently dominate may indicate that they are beginning to show signs of becoming the elite team they are capable of being. 
For the second consecutive game, Notre Dame played a full game without any significant scoring drought, a streak it needs to keep alive in order to get out of the middle of the Big East pack. The Irish, who at times have depended on Duffy to put the team on her shoul­ders, steadily got points from everyone on the floor. While Dufl'y finished with 12 points, she was outshined by the team's other senior, forward Courtney Lavere, who scored a team-high 18 on 9-for-10 shooting, and the two captains joined guards Brenna Gray and Charel Allen, each of whom had 10 points, to give the team four players in double figures. 
"That's what we need, we haven't had that since [The Duel in the Desert in Las Vegas], so that's what we've rebounds, and four assists ..Gaines matched Allen's eight rebounds and added six points of her own. Each had three steals. 

"Defensively, I thought Charel and Tulyah did a great job on the boards," McGraw said. 
Duffy said Breona Gray's play was also crucial in the win. Gray finished with 10 points in 22 min­utes. 
"As long as they run, that's my job to get them the ball," Duffy said. "It's hard to catch Tulyah and 'Bre' when they get out and run. And they did a fantastic job of filling the lanes and then finish­ing." 
Notre Dame kept up its fast­paced offense in the second half, extending the lead to 60-36 mid­way through the second period. Duffy said the quick tempo Irish attack help their defense, which held Providence to 6-of-32 (18.8 percent) shooting in the second half. 
"[The fast pace is nice] because we get some easy buckets and don't have to run as much offense out of it," she said. "That gets our legs underneath us, and we get some easy baskets, and it's a little easier on the defensive end to get some stops." 
Notre Dame next faces Villanova on Tuesday at the Joyce Center. That game has been switched from 7 p.m. to 6 p.m. for television purposes. 
Notes:

The four players in double digits scoring for the Irish were the most since five players scored 10 or more in Notre Dame's 68-55 win over Utah Dec. 18.

Defensively, the team's aggressive play forced 18 turnovers and four shot-clock violations -limiting the Friars to just 28.3 percent shooting from the floor. 
The Irish even dominated on the boards, where they have struggled for the better part of the season. Notre Dame grabbed eight more rebounds than Providence and was led by guards Duffy, Allen, and Tulyah Gaines, all of whom had eight. 
"That's like 100 for us, that's a huge margin," McGraw said of the rebounding differential. 
Ultimately, Saturday's contest was a game Notre Dame need­ed, a game where they per­formed well in all facets, even if it came against a weaker opponent. Clearly, an 18-point victory will always have its bright spots, and the Irish had a lot on Saturday. Perhaps more important than the score was who scored. With everyone contributing and points finally coming from the post -most notably, Lavere's 18 -the Irish proved they can be a complete and dangerous team. 
"We need to be balanced, we need to have an outside game we need to have an inside game, and you know, what bet­ter way than to have a senior do it, to step up her game," Duffy said.

Falling into place 
Irish thump visiting Providence 66-48 for their second straight win 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 

Megan DullY took her seat next to the coaches on the Irish bench Saturday with 7:12 remaining in Notre Dame's 66-48 victory over Providence, an indication the Irish finally had an easy win under their belts. 
"It was nice to get a break," said Duffy, who played just 29 minutes in the contest after aver­aging 38.5 minutes in the team's first 20 games. It was her lowest total minutes since Dec. 17, when she played just 26 minutes in Notre Dame's rout of' Arkansas State in the Duel in the Desert. 
The senior guard had 12 points and eight rebounds Saturday, but her outlet passing in transition and six assists were keys to the Irish victory. 
"I was really pleased with our transition game," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said after the game. "The guards were doing a really good job running the floor, so it was easy." 
A lot of things seemed easy for the Irish against Providence, including Notre Dame's ability to shut down Friars star Gayle Nwafili. The 6-foot-1 center shot just 2-of-14 from the floor and

It was almost out of a movie. 
With 2:34 left in the already decided game Saturday, the home fans began making their demands. Starting in the sec­tions imme­diately behind the bench, a "We Want Tsipis" chant­referring to little-used sophomore guard Amanda Tsipis­began to come from the 6,800 in attendance, and the chant soon turned to a loud ovation as Tsipis jogged over to the scor­er's table, checking in to just her fifth game of the season. 
It was that kind of game for the Irish, a game where they could worry about making sure all 10 members of the team saw playing time rather than trying to erase a major deficit or just hold on for a win, as was the theme of their January. 
For the first time in a long time, Notre Dame played a complete 40 minutes, doing

Spartans take t-wo contests 
Team drops a pair of one-goal battles 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
In a weekend that may turn out to be crucial in its quest for home ice in the CCHA playoffs, Notre Dame was swept 3-2 and 2-1 by No. 14 Michigan State in a home-and-home series Friday and Saturday. 
The Irish, who fell to 9-16­3 over all and 7-12-3 in the CCHA, currently reside in a three-way tie for ninth in the 12-team league. They are five points out of eighth place, which would earn Notre Dame a first round CCHA playoff game at the Joyce Center March 3. 
That goal took a major hit over the weekend, however, with two losses to the Spartans, who stifled the Irish with aggressive defense in both games.

Team records sweep at Ohio State co111petition 
Irish boast 23-1 mark overall on the season 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sporrs Writer 

The Irish found little difficulty in improving their record to 23-1 on the season as both the men's and women's teams fmished with 5-0 records at the Ohio State Duals on Saturday. 
"Going into it we thought we were going to do really well," jun­ior sabre Erin Housing said. "We have been practicing really hard, and :-;ve prepared for it really well. 
The No. 2-ranked men topped regional rivals Purdue (26-1), Michigan State (24-3) and Michigan 20-7. The other two wins came against Case (24-3) and Indiana (22-5). 
"I found trouble against Michigan State, because I under­estimated them," Housing said. "I defmitely made mistakes I should­n't have, because they have a strong team and are competitive." 
Highlights came from junior epeeist Patrick Gettings (13-1) and sophomore captain Greg Howard (5-0). Howard improved his season record to 35-6. 
In the sabre competition, senior Nicholas Diacous finished 6-1 and freshman Bill Thanhouser came out 6-0. Diacous now stands at 20-8 for the season and Thanhouser is 27-9 for the Irish. Thanhouser did not compete in last weekend's Notre Dame Duals

Irish lose in heartbreaker 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Louisville guard Taquan Dean sank a 3-point buzzer beater at the end of regula­tion Saturday afternoon at Freedom Hall, sending the game to overtime tied at 80 and evoking a collective response on the Notre Dame bench that said, "Oh, no. Not again." 
Irish senior Chris Murphy pulled his warm-up jersey over his face in disbelief as Dean's shot fell, and the Cardinals (15-7, 3-6 Big East) went on to win 89-86 in the extra period, handing the Irish (1 0-10, 1-8) their ninth loss by six points or fewer this season.
