Boat Club survives another day 
ByJASON McFARLEY 
News Writer 
Despite campus rumors that The Boat Club will lower its sail for good this weekend, the popular student tavern has yet to navigate the legal hot water it may have cruised into following the Jan. 24 raid that nabbed some 200 under­age Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
State excise police last week sent the report on the raid to the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission, and ATC prosecutor Fred Bauer has not yet recommended sanctions, said Mary DePrez, chairwoman of the Indianapolis-based commis­sion. Bauer will review the case and propose any penal­ties to the commission before formally contacting the bar's owner, she said. 
DePrez wouldn't speculate when the prosecutor would make his recommendation on the case. But in an interview last week with The Observer, she said typically no more than a month passes between when bars are raided and when they hear from the ATC prosecutor. 
Excise, Indiana State and South Bend police raided the bar at 106 N. Hill St. early Jan. 24 and issued 213 minor in a tavern citations, mostly to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. The sweep · ­believed the biggest in South Bend history -followed a two-month investigation into complaints of underage drink­ing at the bar, police said. 
The Boat Club was well known on both campuses as a haven for freshmen and other students under 21 years old. lt was a popular destination on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. 
The bar has remained open since the bust two weeks ago, but regular patrons say atten­dance has dwindled and that bouncers ask for two or three forms or identification at the entrance. 
Rumors this week on cam­pus suggested that the bar would permanently close after the weekend. 
Boat Club owner Mike Mc Neff hasn't returned repeated phone calls request­ing comment. 
In a handwritten statement to The Observer last week, however, McNeff thanked stu­dents for their loyal patronage of the bar. 

"I want to thank everyone who has come out and sup­ported the 'The Boat,"' he said. "A special thanx to the girls who made the 'Long Live the Boat' shirts and all the die hards that won't abandon ship at the first site of an ice­berg." 
Past large-scale raids of stu­dent bars in South Bend have resulted in huge fines and loss of liquor licenses for tavern owners.

Female candidates in election races 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Writer 
Voters first did it in 2001. when they elected Brooke Norton. 
A year later, they did it 

again, ushering Libby Bishop i n t o office. 


But this year, Notre Dame undergraduates won't even have the chance put a woman in the top student government job. Women appear on only two of the seven tickets running for student body president and vice president. And neither female candidate heads her ticket. 
The dearth of female office seekers -and the fact that no female students are cam­paigning for the top post ­is surprising, said Bishop, the current student body president. 
"l was surprised. I expect­ed to see more female candi­dates," Bishop said. "It doesn't necessarily hurt the election, but I had hoped to see more women run." 
Bishop herself was moved to run for office following Norton's election two years ago as the first woman presi­dent. 
"Brooke as herself inspired me to run," Bishop said, "and part of that was her being a female." 
In 2001, Norton defeated a field of opponents that included several women can­didates, including one all­female ticket. Last year, Bishop and male running mate Trip Foley competed against three tickets, includ­ing another female-headed one. 
This year, Mimi Matkowski and Lauren Meagher are vice presidential candidates on male-led tickets. Matkowski is running with Joe Muto, and Meagher teamed with Charlie Ebersol. 
Like Bishop, Meagher too was surprised by the drought of female con­tenders this election season, "but in the end, it comes down to the ticket with the desire to run." 
"I firmly believe that the most qualified people should be elected, male or female," Meagher said. 
Matkowski did not return calls requesting comment for this story. 
For her part, Meagher said she never considered run­ning for president. She was interested in the vice presi­dent job from the start. 
"My business background and strong sense of organi­zation and leadership makes me a better vice presidential candidate," said Meagher. "No, I did not consider run­ning for president because my strengths suit the vice president's role." 
In the 30 years since the University first admitted women as undergraduates, female students have won the vice presidency several times. 
Outside of student govern­ment, women have held other prominent positions. In 2000, Molly Kinder became the first female member of the Irish Guard, the tradi­

INSIDE COLUMN 

Who do you represent? 
Two weeks ago, 20 Saint Mary's stu­dents traveled to Washington, D.C. to participate in the annual March for Ufe -they each paid a small fee to ride a United limo bus for 12 hours and paid for their own meals while in the capital

dents also made the 
Assistant
trip to Washington 
News Editor 
that week to attend the Never Go Back pro-choice confer­ence -they traveled by plane, the cost of which was paid for by the College in addition to the students' meals. 
Saint Mary's homepage states that the school is "the nation's premier Catholic women's college." Does anyone see a problem here? 
It is clear from the organization's Web page and the relevant advertising for the conference that the main purpose ofthe event was not the development ofleader­ship skills. as some have claimed, but rather the furthering of the pro-choice cause. For a school that apparently claims some affiliation with the Catholic Church. funding such an activity as the Never Go Back conference seems deeply disturbing. 
Saint Mary's Center for Women's InterCultural Leadership, which provided a grant for the conference travel costs, is a separate entity within the College with separate funding approval procedures. 
But the overall picture still does not add up: Students who wished to attend a pro-life activity did not receive any finan­cial support -although they never asked for it-while those who desired to attend a pro-choice event were funded in full. 
I certainly don't mean to imply that stu­dents at Catholic schools should not be allowed to express their beliefs and dis­agree with what the Church teaches on a given issue. On the contrary, Catholic col­leges must encourage open debate and free discussion on all sides ofcontrover­sial issues. Yes, academic freedom is absolutely vital to the life of a college. 
But when Saint Mary's chooses to fund a pro-choice event, it crosses a line. It no longer promotes academic discourse. It takes a position, and it stops the discus­sion. Some will be satisfied, others will be hurt. 
Paying for students to attend a pro­choice conference while choosing not to offer the same level ofsupport for a pro­life event sets a terrible precedent for Saint Mary's as a Catholic academic insti­tution. Saint Mary's must foster open debate and encourage its students and faculty to openly express a wide variety of opinions. But the College is a Catholic institution and that should mean some­thing. 
Saint Mary's is both a Catholic and an academic organization -it should not prefer one identity over the other. The Catholic tradition is one oftolerance and love and it must be considered in a part­nership with Saint Mary's academic mis­sion. 
Has Saint Mary's set itselfdown the slippery path of Boston College and Georgetown, where students joke that BC stands for "barely Catholic" and crosses are prohibited in the classrooms? Will Saint Mary's financially support the posi­tion ofother students who may hold pro­capital punishment, anti-gay, anti-Semitic or racist views? The answer remains to be seen.

Committee to discuss SMC Ineals 
By AMY GREENE 
News Writer 
Students at Saint Mary's are implementing a new din­ing hall committee this semester. Formed by Student Activities Board rresident Adrienne Dorbish and Sophomore Class President Sarah Brown, the committee will serve as a touchstone between the student body and the Noble Family Dining llall staff. Dorbish and Brown hope to effectively voice student concerns about the current meal plan options and the quality of food in the dining hall. 
"There arc numerous stu­dents that intern or student teach and arc forced to be off campus all day," said Dorbish. "These students do not eat 14 meals a week, but are forced to pay for the Option 14 plan," she said. 
The dining hall, operated under Sodexho Campus Food Services, currently offers two meal plans to students. 
Hallahan 
continued from page I 
said Hallahan was justified in his decision. "'I don't think it is a good working relationship if you cant voice an opinion with­out causing problems," said LaRulTa. 
Bishop, Foley, Hallahan and LaRuffa met when they returned from winter break to discuss the Board of Trustees report and decided a proposal would be made to bring back 
Option 14 yields students 14 
meals per week and $125 of 
Munch Money per semester. 
The Carte Blanche plan allows students to have unlimited meals, but only 
$10  in  Munch  Money  per  
semester.  
Dorbish  and  Brown  are  

proposing an Option Seven and Option 10 meal plan as alternatives for students. 
"We want to allow students to purchase fewer meals and have more munch money on their student account. We are also hoping to have some hot breakfast food served earlier in the morning so nurses and student teachers who are up very early in the morning can cat something more than cold cereal or fruit," Dorbish said. 
Dorbish also said she believes the majority of the student body is unsatisfied with the quality of food in the dining hall this year. 
"The dining hall staff works very hard to please the vari­ety of students on campus," she said, "but I still feel 
in hall dances, said Hallahan. 
Hallahan said Bishop did not ask him to help draft the report and it was frustrating to read the "watered down" report at Wednesday's Senate meeting. 
Hallahan said he disagreed with Bishop's decision to take out the proposal and this was the opportunity to take a stronger stance with the Board of Trustees. 
" We have a different leader­ship style," Hallahan said. "I am much more aggressive, whereas Libby is more com-
many of the students are dis­pleased with the food at times." 
Dorbish hopes to conduct a student survey as one of the committee's first projects that will ask students their opinions on the quality and varifity of food in the dining hall, as well as_ their views on the current meal plan options. 
"I think a committee like this could help alleviate a lot of the problems in the dining hall," said senior Lauren Dasso. "Efficiency is a huge issue. A lot of students don't have time to wait in the long likes and set an hour for lunch aside everyday." 
Dorbish, Brown. and other members of the Board of Governance will meet with Kevin Kirwan, district man­ager of Sodexho Campus Services, next week to dis­cuss concerns about the din­ing hall's current operations.

promising." 
"Overall it was a weak report and its unfortunate because we were in a good position to put dances back in the hall," LaRuffa said. 
LaRuffa said Bishop's fall report on residentiality impressed the Board of Trustees and now was the opportunity to make a propos­al regarding in hall dances due to connections between the topics.

KThrough the advertisements and poster campaign, I wanted to show an ND student lending a helping hand to a Special Olympian to emphasize that Late Night Olympics is a noble cause to raise money for the Special Olympics."

Fortner United Way executive admits theft 
As1odatcd Prc.s 
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 
A former United Way exec­utive pleaded guilty Thursday to stealing nearly $1.9 million to buy expensive show horses in what is believed to be the biggest embezzlement case in the agency's history. 
Jacquelyn Allen-MacGregor worked in the Capital Area United Way in East Lansing for 20 years before resigning as vice president for finance in November. Prosecutors said she stole the money over seven years, beginning in 1996, and used it to fund her quarter horse business. 
In pleading guilty to federal counts of check forging and engaging in an illegal finan­cial transaction, Allen­MacGregor said she once paid $45,000 for a horse. 
Allen-MacGregor, 46, faces up to 10 years in prison on each count at sentencing in May. She agreed to let the United Way seize and sell her assets in an effort to recoup the money. 
The plea comes eight years after William Aramony, a former chief of the national charity, was convicted of defrauding United Way out of $600,000 to support a lavish lifestyle for himself and hfs girlfriends. 
Following public scrutiny of charitable organizations fol­lowing the Sept. 11 attacks, United Way of America last month instituted some addi­tional checks and balances in its accounting procedures, said Brian A. Gallagher, president and chief executive officer of the Alexandria, Va.-based organization. 
Allen-MacGregor said she stole the money by writing checks to herself on the Capital Area United Way account and forging tlie names of required co-sign­ers. When the bank returned the canceled checks to the agency, she destroyed them. 
The chapter now uses an accounting firm to reconcile bank statements. 
Allen-MacGregor also said she deposited the money into two accounts she shared with her husband. one personal and one for the horse busi­ness. Celebration Quarter Horses. She said her hus­band knew nothing about the transactions because she 
handled  the  family's  
finances.  
Assistant U.S.  Attorney  

Daniel Mekaru said more than 300 forged checks have turned up dating to 1996; 45 turned up from last year alone. 
Allen-MacGregor pleaded guilty to help make amends, defense lawyer Brian Monily said. She declined comment as she left the courtroom. 
"Her mood is as you'd expect -troubled, devastat­ed," Morely said. 
Besides the possibility of prison time, she faces a max­imum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release on each count. 
The theft hurt the reputa­tion of the East Lansing chapter, and its president. Bob Berning, resigned Feb. 
3. Gallagher said the chapter must be open about its prob­lems and work hard to cor­rect them to win back public trust.

Priest gets 10 years for abuse 
Asociated Press 
ROCKVILLE, Md. 
A Georgia priest convicted of sexually abusing two brothers while a student at a Washington seminary in the 1970s was sentenced to 10 years in prison Thursday. 
The Rev. Wayland Brown was sentenced in Montgomery Circuit Court, three months after his guilty plea to battery and abuse. The boys were 12 and 13 years old when the abuse began in 1974 at their Gaithersburg home. 
One of the brothers told Judge Ann S. Harrington on Thursday of the shame and bit­ter memories he has lived with since the abuse, which he said kept him from forming close relationships and drove him to consider suicide. 
"Father Brown robbed me of my future and shackled me with chains of guilt," the man, now 42, said in a wavering voice. "Father Brown made me hate being me." 
A pre-sentencing memoran­dum by prosecutors painted Brown as a serial molester who abused several boys throughout the 1970s and 1980s. One, who grew up in Georgia and now lives in Oklahoma, testified that Brown abused him on a trip to Disney World in 1978. 

Brown was removed from a post at a Savannah. Ga .. parish in 1988 and has lived in Savannah since, running a bookkeeping business. He apologized Thursday to the brothers and the Oklahoma man, all of whom were in court. 
"There is no excuse for what I did, there cannot be," he said. "l hated myself for what I did." 
Elsewhere Thursday, five men who say they were sexual­ly abused by priests years ago, including one man who said he was fondled in a confessional, sued a Roman Catholic diocese in Pennsylvania. 
In two lawsuits, the men said they were abused by two priests in the Altoona-Johnstown diocese Monsignor Francis McCaa and the Rev. Francis Luddy ­while they were preteens or teenagers in the 1970s and 1980s. One man said he was abused for six years. 
The lawsuits claim the church was negligent and failed to provide a safe envi­ronment for children, said a lawyer for the men, Richard Serbin. He said Mccaa and Luddy were not named as defendants because the statute of limitations has expired. 
In a statement, diocesan spokeswoman Sister Mary Parks said the diocese was "deeply sorry for the pain of any victims of sexual abuse" but declined to comment on the lawsuits. 
McCaa resigned in 1985 and has since been barred from public ministry, Parks said. Luddy was formally dismissed from the priesthood in 1988 after a previous lawsuit alleg­ing sexual abuse. Neither man's whereabouts could immediately be determined. 
'Tm not concerned if there's not another female president now or a few years from now. The ground has been broken." 
Students can vote in Monday's general election for one of seven tickets: Mike Bott and Mike Kirsh, Ebersol and Meagher, Ryan Gagnet and John McCarthy, Pat Hallahan and Jeremy Lao, Muto and Matkowski, Matt Padberg and David Rail or Drew,Updike and Eric Tarnowski. 
Voting is conducted online from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

tionally all-male squad that protects the marching band and cheers on the sidelines during football games. 
Meagher believes it's impor­tant to recognize the leader­ship roles, both political and non, that women hold across campus. 
"Women all over the Notre Dame campus have leadership positions, and I applaud those inside and outside student government," she said. "In 

terms of bringing something 
special to student government 
in particular, the success of 
the candidate depends on her 
leadership ability and person­
ality." 

While surprising, the lack of 
female candidates this year 
isn't necessarily troubling to 
Bishop. She said she hopes to 
see more women run in the 
future and eventually hold her 
office again. 

The current president isn't 
worried if that doesn't happen 
next year -or even the year 
after. 

"We've had two years with . women in office," Bishop said.

U.N. weapons inspectors Thursday. a top Iraqi official said hours after the top U.N. nuclear inspector demanded a "drastic change" in Baghdad's level of cooperation. 
If confirmed, it would be the first time a scientist linked to Iraq's weapons programs has spoken to inspectors without Iraqi officials present. Such interviews have been a top demand of U.N. inspectors, hoping the scientists will reveal clandestine weapons programs. 
"One of our scientists is being interviewed alone, as we speak," Iraqi presidential adviser Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi told a Baghdad press confer­ence. lie did not give any details or identify the scientist. There was no immediate con­firmation from U.N. officials. 
Earlier Thursday, top U.N. nuclear inspector Mohamed EIBaradei demanded Baghdad show greater cooperation, as he and fellow chief inspector Hans Blix briefed British Prime Minister Tony Blair on their way to Baghdad for talks this weekend. 
"They need to show drastic change in terms of coopera­tion," E!Baradei said. "Our 
mission in Baghdad this week­end is crucial. We hope, we will secure full, 100 percent coop­eration on the part of Iraq." 
Blix and ElBaradei are to present their latest report to the U.N. Security Council on Feb. 14, and Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday that their visit to Baghdad would be key to seeing if Iraq intends to cooperate. 
In Washington, Powell told senators Thursday that "within weeks" the Iraqi situation will be brought to a conclusion "one way or another." 
A day earlier, Powell laid down the U.S. case againsi Iraq in a speech to the Security Council, presenting tape recordings, satellite photos and testimony he said constituted "irrefutable" proof that Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction. 
Blix and E!Baradei will chal­lenge Iraqi officials to respond to issues raised by Powell at the Security Council Wednesday, said Hiro Ueki, their spokesman. Al-Saadi and other Iraqi officials dismissed Powell's testimony as full of fabrications.

Russia halts tourist space flights despite fiscal problems 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 

Russia's decision to suspend tourist flights into space after the Columbia dis­aster is causing a money crunch and the country needs other sources of foreign cash to fulfill its role as the sole nation capable of supplying the International Space Station, Russia's space chief said Thursday. 
Russian Aerospace Agency Director Yuri Koptev said the country's $130 mil­lion space station budget this year is "barely enough" to pay for the two Soyuz and three Progress ships it has already pledged to send to the station. 
Earlier this week, Russia decided to suspend flights for paying tourists and crews on short-term visits into space -a move that will cut another $45 million from the budget, Koptev said. 
Koptev said during a trip to India on Thursday that other partners in the 16­nation project should cover the additional costs, the ITAR-Tass news agency report­ed. 
The Soyuz crew capsules and Progress cargo ships are now the only link to the space station and the three-man crew currently in space. 
Another two to three cargo ships will be needed each year to run the station without shuttles, and each costs about $22 million, Koptev said. 

"The approach to the 2004 ISS budget should be changed" to pay Russia for the extra spacecraft, the ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. 
In the past, U.S. shuttles have ferried long-term crews to the station, while Russian rockets have carried cosmonauts and space tourists on short visits. The cosmonauts fly up on a fresh Soyuz craft -leaving it behind as an escape module for the crew -and return on the old one. 
An American and a South African have paid a reported $20 million each to fly to the space station aboard Russian rockets, and Russia had planned to send more space tourists to the station this year. 
Koptev said that his agency would start detailed talks with NASA in 2-3 weeks on how to run the station during the break in shuttle flights. 
The prospects of future flights were suspended pending the outcome of the investigation into Saturday's U.S. shuttle disaster that killed seven astronauts. According to estimates, it might take from six months to 2 1/2 years to resume the shuttle flights, Koptev said, according to the !TAR-Tass.

States losing track of sex off enders 
Associated Pn:ss 
SAN FRANCISCO 
In a startling new survey, a child advocacy group found that states across the country have lost track of tens of thousands of rapists, child molesters and other sex offenders who are supposed to be registered in Megan's Law databases. 
Prompted by an Associated Press investigation that revealed California had lost track of at least 33,000 sex offenders, Parents for Megan's Law con­tacted all 50 states by telephone to ask about the accuracy of their registries. 
It found that states on average were unable to account for 24 percent of sex offenders sup­posed to be in the databases. And 19 states, including Texas and New York, said they were unable to track how many sex offenders were failing to regis­ter, or simply did not know. 
Federal law requires the addresses of convicted sex offenders to be verified at least once a year. 
But the survey found that up­to-date addresses for more than 77,000 sex offenders are miss­ing from the databases of 32 states. And in the other 18 states and the District of Columbia, which are responsible for 133,705 offenders, thou­sands of the ex-convicts may have disappeared. 
"They're implementing Megan's Law, then turning their backs on it," said Laura Ahearn, executive director of the non­profit agency in New York. "They need the technology and the staff to track down their sex offenders." 
All states responded to the group's survey, but only 32 were able to provide failure rates. Many of these said they have never audited their sex offender registries and provided only rough estimates of their accuracy. 
The survey, which the group plans to release Friday, relied on the word of officials in each state, unlike the AP's analysis in California, which was based on a CD-ROM of data taken directly from the registry. 
The survey said Oklahoma and Tennessee had the highest rates of noncompliance, both at 50 percent. A Tennessee official disputed this, and Oklahoma's Corrections Department spokesman. Brian Johnson, said the figure was just his best guess. 
"I don't have any specific actual information in terms of the level of noncompliance," he said. "We've not done a study of that that I'm aware of." 
The databases are supposed to help the public and police moni­tor sex offenders by keeping track of their home and work addresses and other personal details. Adults can search the database at sheriffs' offices or police departments, assuming the information is kept up to date as required. 
All states have versions of the law named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, a New Jersey girl who was raped and killed by a child molester who had moved in across the street. 
But many states admit they don't know whether the data­bases are accurate -and they havelittlestafftodothework. 
In Oklahoma, Johnson's department mails address veri­fication forms each year to 5,415 sex offenders, who are required to update and return them. But no one monitors how many of forms come back and how many don't. 
Johnson said he spends about a third of his time on sex offend­er registration. One full-time worker has the rest of the responsibility. 
The advocacy group said Tennessee's Bureau of Investigation told it half of the state's 6,300 sex offenders were out of compliance with the law. But a spokeswoman for the agency, Jeanne Broadwell, said 37 percent of 5,812 offenders were missing. She couldn't explain the discrepancy. 
The agency receives most of its updates from local law those that come back. Offenders who don't respond often get a visit from police, spokeswoman Mary Coffee said. 

"We send a notification to law enforcement that says, 'Here's the guys who didn't report.' Certain agencies have entire units who follow-up on these folks," Coffee said. 
Several state agencies. includ­ing the department that issues driver's licenses and state iden­tification cards, which sex offenders in Florida are required to keep, have direct electronic access to the data­base. 
"We have legislative and tech­nology help that helps us do our best keeping track of these folks," Coffee said. 
Ahearn said she was surprised that some populous states reported very different results. For example, Massachusetts told the group it had lost track of 44 percent of its 18,000 offenders, while Illinois said it lost just 14 percent of its 17,087. 
After the AP's story about the California database. state and federal lawmakers, advocates for crime victims and police demanded efforts to improve Megan's Law databases. But with California and other states facing big budget deficits, more money will be hard to find. 
Johnson. the Oklahoma offi­cial, also said he doubts the databases will ever provide more than a false sense of secu­rity. 
"There's three reasons to have a sex offender registry," he said. "One is public protection. the second is it supports law enforcement investigations and it might prevent future acts of criminal behavior. I'm not aware of any research that says any of those things are accom­plished."

Associated Press 

Secretary of State Colin Powell built public support for a possible war with Iraq with his address to the United Nations laying out the case against Saddam Hussein, accord­ing to several polls taken after his comments Wednesday. 
The number who say Powell has made a very strong case against Iraq was about six in 10 or more, according to polls by NBC News, ABC-The Washington Post and CNN­USA Today-Gallup. But that support is strongest if this country has the sup­port of the United Nations. 
About half, 51 percent, said the United States should take military action against Iraq only if the United Nations supports it. Almost four in 10, 37 per­cent, said the United States should take military is hiding evidence from weapons inspectors. About half that many felt he has made a very strong case that Iraq has links to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group al-Qaida. 
The ABC-Post poll said six in 10 believe the Bush administration has pre­sented· enough evidence supporting its position on Iraq -an increase from 48 percent who felt that way three weeks ago. The number in that poll who said this country should give U.N. inspectors a few weeks or less before act­ing was 59 percent, up from 51 percent before Powell's. speech. 
The ABC-Post poll of 504 adults and the NBC News poll of 514 adults had error margins of 4.5 per­centage points. The CNN­USA Today-Gallup poll of 601 adults had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

IN BRIEF 
Discrimination cases at 7-year high: 
Federal job discrimination complaints filed by workers against private employers jumped more than 4 percent in 2002 to the highest level in seven years. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday that complaints increased to 
84.442 during the 2002 budget year, up from 80,840 the previous year. Complaints in 2002 reached the highest level since 1995, when 87,529 were filed. The poor economy, an aging and multinational work force and backlash from the 2001 terrorist attacks likely contributed to the increase, said EEOC Chairwoman Cari M. Dominguez. She noted the large increases in allegations of reli­gious, age and national origin discrimina­tion. 
Tyson executive caught on tape: 
Prosecutors played secret tapes Thursday of a man described as a manager at Tyson Foods arranging for the delivery of hundreds of illegal immigrants from an undercover agent posing as a smuggler.

I'm going to need a lot." Tyson and three officials are charged with conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants to work on the production lines of the company.

Productivity news hurts Dow 
. War fears con­tribute to overall market decline 
Associated Pcess 
NEW YORK 
A tepid productivity report gave investors more reasons to sell Thursday, sending stocks moderately lower and carrying the Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 index to levels not seen in nearly four months. 
Analysts said trading was uneven as investors made short-term bets on whether or when the United States would wage war on Iraq. Tensions with North Korea also pres­sured the market. 
"It's been sloppy and choppy in the last few ses­sions as speculative trad­ing entered the fray," said Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator at Prudential Securities. "The lackluster productivity figures are definitely not a step in the right direction." 
"There's a massive wait­and-see mentality here, not only on Wall Street but Main Street as well," he added. "With that being the case, speculative action is making the most of it."

NASA not ruling out foam damage as cause of accident 
Associated Pres.. 
SPACE CENTER, Houston 
A day after all but ruling it out as a leading cause, NASA said Thursday that investiga­tors are still considering whether a piece of insulating foam that struck Columbia's wing during liftoff was enough to bring down the shuttle. 
Shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said that even though the possibility appeared remote. investiga­tors must remain open to every option as they put together a so-called fa ult tree into what caused Columbia's fiery breakup just minutes from its landing Saturday. 
"The foam that shed off the tank is just one branch, and we are pursuing that even though we scratch our heads," Dittemore said. "We are going to pursue it until we pound it flat."

Two days later, Dittemore all but discounted the theory that it was the main cause. saying NASA computer simu­lations had shown the debris hit wasn't severe and couldn't have been the sole cause of the disaster.

Before ruling the foam out as a culprit, NASA will be testing its impact on the thousands of fragile thermal tiles that cover each space shuttle.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect." 
Mark Twain American writer 


I always get the urge to write about the cam­paign for student government when I'm rushing to the bathroom. It's strange. Last year this time, I wrote an article criticizing all the candidates for their vapid, useless campaign promises and claimed that such promises would never come to light. 
John Lltle

Unfortunately for us, I'm always right. I'm back to report for you, and lo and 
Frankly

behold, as I predicted, the 
Obnoxious

Libby Bishop presidency has 
been a total failure. Worse 
than simply not passing her flex-options program, Bishop will now travel to 
Florida to explain to the Board ofTrustees that she is "recognizing a division in this report over opinion on in-hall dances." 
Bishop knows what the result of expressing this "division" will be -the Trustees will do nothing to bring back the SYR. Guess that must be what she wants. Perhaps as a student government official you just become too buddy-buddy with adminis­trators to be able to stand the ground you promise in campaign season, perhaps the administration has sweetened the pot. 
Oddly, in a comment about Bishop's being elect­ed last year, Gary Caruso reminisced that some 30 years ago, the student body president traded fight­ing for students for a recommendation to Yale. Am I saying that this happened with Bishop? No. She could have turned for less, or for nothing. She could just be naive or weak. But when Bishop didn't include the Senate's proposal for a proba­tionary return of the SYR next year in her meeting with the Board ofTrustees, she sold out every stu­dent on this campus. In the end, it is always we students who lose while these candidates are padding their resumes -or rather, you students. I won't be here next year. 
So. Notre Dame students, how does it feel to be sold out? Worse yet, you're being sold out by someone you elected who promised that she "want[ed] to be so much more responsive to stu­dents. and not become self-absorbed." Guess that got lost somewhere. 
Well, Notre Dame, this is your past student administration. and I say all this not in an effort to condemn an individual person, but in an effort to condemn the system which has created the situa­tion in which we find ourselves. Now it's time to choose your next administration. 
For those of you who haven't been here for the last four years, I'll summarize what student gov­ernment has accomplished while I was here at Notre Dame: a extra slice of PB&J in Grab 'N Go, cereal in Grab 'N Go, "Founder's Day," three terri­ble different plans for football ticket distribution and I can't think of anything else. It's all fluff, nothing of substance. Well, except the PB&J. Thanks, LaFratta. 
Now let's list just four of the bad things that happened due to student government failing to take a stand, or alternatively, actually going behind students' backs to support and advocate. The following were banned: the graffiti dance (seniors will remember), dorm dances, tailgating and hard liquor in the dorms. Is there a fair trade­off here? I don't think so. 
You might be wondering why I'm bringing this all up and what I hope to accomplish. Well, the truth is I want to encourage students not to write off candidates that have supposedly "unattain­able" campaign goals, because the truth is folks, they're not going to achieve any of their goals. Your goal in electing a student body president should be choosing a person who most represents what you want to see happen at your school and who will be the most willing to fight for you over the administration every single time. In terms of what will get accomplished next year, the candi­date you elect is irrelevant. In terms of what your choice says to the administration. your choice of candidate is very relevant. 
My hopes for a new student body president? Personally I'd love, just like last year, to see acad­emic free speech, student representation on ResLlfe panels and a candidate fully willing to dis­solve student government in protest of its ineffec­tiveness rather than cave to pressure from the administration. In short, I want a candidate with the fortitude to stand up for students -for real ­instead of just padding their resume. 
The time for the silly argument about what is and what isn't possible is over. You should be electing a candidate that reflects the changes you want to see on campus, and the changes that, without a belligerent administration could be achieved. If a forum for discussion of theology is what you want to see in Legends, I urge you to vote for a candidate that provides that. If you want printers in every dorm, there is a ticket to satisfy your agenda. Similarly, if you are looking for ResLlfe reforms or parietals changes, there are platforms that support your ideas. You have everything from several tickets ofover-ambitious, administration-coddling, self-important nerds to Hawaiians with bodyguards. 
Just make no mistake about it. Student govern­ment is not, under any circumstances, going to have an effect on your life. Better to have a leader who gives the administration as many headaches as they give us, or no government at all, than to have what we have right now -appeasement, ineffectiveness and a demeaning of our value as students and human beings. 
John Litle is a senior MIS major. He would like to remark that he has no personal relationship with anyone in, or desiring to be in, student gov­ernment, which gives him the ability to be a total jerk to the lot ofthem. He's looking forward to a personal helper monkey in his future. His column appears every other Friday. He can be contacted at jlitle@nd.edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Appreciating students' devotion to social action 
When I agreed to participate in the debriefing of partici­pants in the Center for Social Concerns' Urban Plunge, I did so largely to support the mission of the Center. I expected to occupy my usual professorial role of mediator and guide. 
Most professors in mid-life and mid-career, as I am, have their role and their intellectual world fairly well defined. I also knew to expect students that were polite, prepared, respectful and well-schooled in the spiritual compassion arising from the Catholic character of this university. This had been my experience with undergraduates at Notre Dame. 
What I did not expect was the thoughtful, beautifully articulated, careful consideration of their experiences. These students did not allow me my usual conceits and directions. They questioned me, each other, and the world at large. Some of them also had profound answers that were not only spiritual but also fundamentally intellectual. At universities, we can all agree that our core mission is the intellectual and social maturation of our students and the growth of our collective body of knowledge. We often forget that universities also allow teachers and scholars to grow emotionally and intellectually from our contact with students. 
The connection between social knowledge and social action has bedeviled sociologists of all generations. My pro­found understanding of that connection came not from the literature or from discussions with colleagues but from a group of students in a lounge in Molloy Hall. They under­stood that that it is both the large gestures and the small and both thoughts and deeds that set the ground for social action. As one student said. it is not about changing the world but about acting on our shared humanity. 
My generation understood the need for social action. This generation appears to know how and why to act. Thank you for this lesson. I think I needed it.

Student politics create student apathy 
As I stare down the barrel of impending graduation and look to the future with much trepidation (thanks to the Jumble for improving my vocabulary), I find myself wanti­ng to share thoughts about the Golden Dome. particularly student politics. 
I opened my copy of The Observer today with shock and chagrin. [ cannot believe that one of the finest papers in all of the land would choose to endorse the Charlie Ebersol-Lauren Meaghen ticket. Frankly, it sickens me. Since when has Notre Dame politics been about being "slick and charismatic" or about having "personal connec­tions?" Those are signs of a U.S. election, not of one under the loving gaze of Our Lady. 
Notre Dame elections should be about being an insider in the political machine -about getting in early. getting entrenched and then becoming president as the capstone of a wasted political career. Or, they should be about hav­ing a woman somewhere between marginally attractive and totally hot on your ticket. Notre Dame elections are about these things and nothing more. 
I regretfully say that I will not be voting in next week's elections. Furthermore, I feel that The Observer severely wasted its endorsement this year.

Once upon a time, fairy tale characters were relegated to their own stories. In "Into the Woods," the Pasquerilla East Musical Company changes this to bring to life princes, witches and beautiful maidens all drawn from a vast collection of classic fairy talcs. 
The plot of "Into the Woods" mingles char­acters from an assort­ment of fairy tales, all ginterconnecting in a fun-filled, action­packed ride. Act I opens by introduc­ing three different storylines onstage at once, with the focus bouncing between them. 
Cinderella (Devon Candura) wishes to· go to the King's festi­val; absentminded Jack (Matt Patricoski) is told by his mother (Erin Porvaznik) that he must sell his beloved cow Milky-White; the Baker (Ryan McLaughlin) and his wife (Patricia Gilbert) long for a child; and the famished Little Red Riding Hood (Molly McShane) bursts into the house of the Baker and his wife to gather sweets and breads for her granny. 
The Baker and his wife soon learn from their ugly witch neigh­bor (Lindsey Horvath) that the Baker's father stole from her gar­den years ago. In order to undo the witch's curse and have a child, she orders them to find four ingre­dients for a potion before three days' time: "the cow as white as milk; the cape as red as blood; the hair as yellow as corn; the slipper as pure as gold." 
During the frenzied search that ensues, more characters play additional roles in the pandemoni­um, including the Narrator and Mysterious Man (Michael Federico), a ravenous Wolf (Tom Anthony), two princes (Zachary Linnert and Brian Grundy), a gigantic beanstalk, a dead Giant. a flour-covered cow and more. All problems are rnsolved as Act I ends, and it seems that all are des­tined to live happily ever after. 
Then Act II starts. 
The action continues as the characters are rAintrodnced, all considerably happier with thoir new lives. A sudden disaster involving another giant, howevor, reunites the characters in the wood once again. The play con­cludes with several surprising twists and tragedies, with a finale more realistic and less bright and shiny than Act I's. 
The orchestra is magnificent with Stephen Sondheim's difficull music, and provides an emotional musical background as well as sound effects. The wonderful lyrics and songwriting allow for standout performances by the many talent­ed singers in the cast. Candura shines in gorgeous solos, like "No One is Alone," and plays 
Cinderella as a character who changes a great deal during the course of events. 
"Cinderella matures from the first act to the second act. As you can see in the first act, she is young and nai"ve when making dPci­sions about the prince because she doesn't real­ly know what she wants out oflife. In the second act she's able to under-

Pittsburgh game much more important after loss 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Spons Wrirer 
They had the inside track to the Big East West Division title, and now they have to work and get some help. 
After knocking off Georgetown in double overtime last Saturday, and after Big East leader and then second­ranked Pittsburgh lost to Syracuse later that night, Notre Dame stood in the driver's seat to take its second divisional title in three years. 
With a one-game cushion over mighty No. 4 Pittsburgh, virtually all that would stand in their way would be a home matchup against the Panthers Sunday, assuming the Irish could handle the rest of their Big East opponents in the second half of the season. 
But that was before No. 10 Notre Dame was upset Wednesday night at Seton Hall 78-72. 
And now the Irish have their work cut out for them. 
Currently, Notre Dame stands tied for second place in the West at 6-2 with Syracuse. After the Irish .loss to the Pirates Wednesday night, the Panthers reclaimed their spot atop the standings. 
Now if the Irish are to win the divi­sion, they will need to defeat Pittsburgh in the Joyce Sunday and take care of business for the rest of their Big East schedule by winning out. Then the Irish need some help from teams under them in the West Division standings. 
If Notre Dame and Pittsburgh were to finish with the same conference record, the tie-breaking procedure would begin with head-to-head matchups, then record in the division, followed by record against the third place team in the division and continu­ing down through the standings until a distinction can be made. 
Got that? 

What it really boils down to is that if the Irish beat the Panthers Sunday and then both teams win the rest of their conference games, Notre Dame would need Syracuse to finish ahead of Seton Hall in the Rig East standings, because Pittsburgh's conference loss came to the Orangemen and the Irish lost to the Pirates. 
But now the Irish have to focus on a very formidable opponent in the Panthers, a team that manhandled Notre Dame earlier this season in a 72-55 victory at Pittsburgh's Petersen Center. 
"The last time we played them, I think we went in there with the mind­set that they were going to lay down for us based on the things we had done and the teams we had beaten at that point in the season," said Irish guard Torrian Jones, who played an instrumental role in Notre Dame's 93­92 victory last Saturday over Georgetown by sinking the game-win­ning free throw. "Obviously, that didn't happen, and it was really just the opposite." 
Indeed, the Panthers had little diffi­culty disposing of the Irish in their first matchup as four Pittsburgh play­ers scored in double digits. 
Pittsburgh center Ontario Lett scored 20 points and grabbed eight rebounds as their was little opposition from the undersized Irish post players. 
In addition, the hyped-up matchup between two of the conference's top guards in Notre Dame's Chris Thomas and Pittsburgh's Big East Preseason Player of the Year Brandin Knight wasn't much of a contest. Thomas was just 2-for-15 shooting for five points in one of his worst performances of the season. Knight appeared to be much more at ease in leading the potent Pittsburgh offense, sinking an efficient 60 percent. of his shots for 12 points. 
As a team, the usually accurate Irish shooters only made 32 percent of their shots, while Pittsburgh shot 53 percent during the game. 
"We just need to play better as a team this time around," Jones said. "They have talent on the outside with Knight, but they can also take you inside like they did the last game against us. We just have to try to play better defense as a team to shut them down.'' 
Tipoff Sunday is 3:30 p.m. in the Joyce Center.

COACHING 
Brey is well on his way to establishing a quality basketball pro­gram. He prepares his team well in practice, but sometimes doesn't pull the reins hard enough when his charges lose control on the court. 
STYLE OF PLAY 
One of the few teams in the Big East who doesn't play a physical style of basketball, the Irish rely on their perimeter game to spur them to victory. And when the perime­ter isn't clicking -like it was at Seton Hall ­the Irish are in trouble. 

POST PERIMETER PLAYERS PLAYERS 
Francis has seen the most minutes of the Irish big men, but he is still developing. Cornette, meanwhile, has shown exceptional defense in the post and Timmermans is playing arguably the best basketball of his career. 

Carroll and Thomas drive the Irish offense -without them, Notre Dame wouldn't have 18 wins. The duo averages 
38.8 points a game. Miller provides another scoring threat, but his value to the Irish comes in his defensive play. 
BENCH 
The Irish are an eight-man rotation, and one of the biggest guessing games revolves who the Irish will bring off the bench. Jones provides athleticism, Quinn provides offense and Timmermans bulk. 
INTANGIBLES 
Coming off a tough road loss to Seton Hall, the Irish are going to be angry. More importantly, they're looking for revenge in front of a raucous home crowd that will be fired up for a nationally tele­vised game. 

;:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
In just four seasons, Howland took a team that finished 13-15 his first year and brought them to the Sweet 16 last year. He coaches his teams well in games and is adept at putting the right player in the game in the right situation. 
The Panthers love to run their shooters around -dragging opponents into -big physical post men. And if the shots don't fall, something that hasn't happened too much this season, Pittsburgh always can dump the ball inside. 
Going inside isn't the Panthers game. But that doesn't mean they don't have the talent. Lett averages 11 points and six rebounds a game, but more impor­tantly, he and Troutman crushed the Irish when the two teams last played. 

Knight is the guard everybody loves to talk about, but he has a strong supporting cast along the perimeter. Page and Brown are ever-present 3-point threats capable of quickly dismantling opposing defenses. 
Pittsburgh loves to play as many as 10 players a game, mixing and matching parts to tailor their squad to take advantage of opposing weaknesses. 
Higher-ranked. On the road. Tops in the Big East West Division. In other words, the Panthers have every­thing to lose. However, a weak non-conference schedule means they need a quality win come tourney time -a win the Irish could provide. 


Carroll and Thomas compose arguably one of the best backcoµrts in the nation. Yet'in big games, against tal­ented guards, Thomas tends to falter. Carroll~s'·consistiihcv wi11··stilf carry½Notre Dame on Sunday.

Transferring his happiness 
Two years after he left Maryland for Notre Dame, Dan Miller couldn't be happier 

By ANDREW SOUKUP Sp[)rts Wrirer 
llis old Maryland clothes are stuck in his closet back in New Jersey, one of a handful of reminders of a past Notre Dame forward Dan Miller is eager lo leave behind. 
There are the questions, too, about the national cham­pionship Maryland won while Miller sat out an NCAA­mandatory <me year f'or trans­forring tu Notre Dame. 
There's ihc calls he makes to his Terrapin friends. many of' whom he is still close to. 
Yet Maryland is unquestion­ably part of Miller's past. Notre Dame is his present. 
''I'm happy," he said. 'Tm happy with how I'm playing right now. Things are just a lot happier for me." 
The Maryland years 
When Terrapins coach Gary Williams first came calling at the Maryland household, he enticed the McDonald's All­American to come to College Park to play basketball. And Miller's Maryland career started strong. 
During his freshman year, Miller averaged a little more than 14 minutes a game, and he was ()Ile of two freshmen to play all 34 games. His sophomore season was much better, as Miller moved into a starting position and aver­aged 30 minutes a game. His teammates awarded the

junior season vanished almost instantly. He unhappily 
moved back into a reserve role, and although the Terrapins made it to the Final Four, the season wasn't much fun for Miller. How could it be for a player who started one year and then averaged fewer than 20 minutes a game the next? 
"Ile didn't get along with his coach real well. He didn't like the style of basketball he played, and he wasn't real happy," Irish tri-captain Matt Carroll said. 
So Miller decided to leave.

Bu l when Notre Dame played Maryland in l)pcembcr, Williams agreed to interviews only on the condi­tion that Miller's namo never came up. 
"I didn't like my situation, and I didn't like where things wor11 going," Miller said sim­ply. "I wanted a change of scenery." 
A year without basketball 
When Miller made his deci­sion io transfer, he went to a coach he knew well. 
Mike Brey had coached Miller's brother Greg during his tenure at Maryland, and Miller respected Brcy's hands-off approach that gives players freedom when they're on the court. 
For Mil]er, the coach was more important than the loca­tion. 
"When I had one year left, I don't think I had much time to work with a coach," he said. "I wanted to come here and build a good relationship with [Brey l because I knew him." 
NCAA rules stipulated that Miller had to sit out an entire year after his transfer. mean­ing Miller would put in all the work in practice without see­ing the results in a game. 
Every game, he walked out of the tunnel with the rest of the Irish squad. The only dif­ference was that they were wearing uniforms, and he had on khakis. 
"It was difficult at times because you're not playing basketball in the winter," he said. "My teammates and everybody did a great job keeping me motivated, and I did a lot of work with the strength coach."

Jones provides the spark as Irish 6th man 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Writer 
Ask any member of the Leprechaun Legion who is the sixth man for the Notre Dame basketball team. and they'll likely say the green-clad stu­dent body. 
But ask anyone on the team who plays that role and you'll probably hear the name of reserve guard Torrian Jones. 
The Irish junior has only averaged five points and 19 minutes a game this year, but he has specialized in being the player who brings a spark to the court coming off the bench. 
"He definitely brings a spark when he comes in the game," Irish captain Matt Carroll told und.com. "Whether things are going good or bad and he is coming in, we know he is going to bring a lot of energy into the game." 
Even though Jones has yet to start a game this season for the Irish, much of the team's suc­cess has been due to Jones' play off the bench. And that role has been one Jones has embraced and thrived in through Notre Dame's first 22 games. 
"Jones is a winner, man," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "He's a guy that's going to go out there and do whatever he has to to get the win. He under­stands his role coming off the bench, and he's willing to do whatever you ask. He's a beau­tiful guy to coach." 
Last Saturday, Jones showed just how important that role could be in Notre Dame's 93-92 double-overtime win over Georgetown. With starting point guard Chris Thomas fouled out of the game, Jones made his presence felt in the extra periods, flying all over the court on defense, grabbing rebounds and eventually sink­ing the game-winning free throw with just 5.5 seconds remaining. 
But even with the clutch free throw and Jones' sporadic high-flying dunks -like the one he slammed home in the first overtime against the Hoyas after exploding past a Georgetown defender from the 3-point line -Jones has been known mostly throughout his career at Notre Dame for his tenacious defensive skills. 
"I like to be that spark off the bench. which has been my role, since I arrived here," Jones told und.com. "Also I like to come into the game and just change the pace of it. Defensively, I like to bring a presence on the floor, which has been my spe­cialty since I was a freshman in high school." 
Whether it be taking the defensive burden off of Thomas' shoulders for a bit or getting in the face of the oppo­nents' top shooters, Jones has drawn a lot of attention as one of the fiercest defenders in the Big East. 
"I take it as a compliment in this stage in my career," Jones said. 'Tm not sure I'd like to be known as strictly a defensive player for the rest of my career, like those are my only abilities, but right now I'm happy people see that part of my game." 
But anyone who watches 
Notre Dame in the dwindling minutes of a close game and sees Brey attempt to send Jones to the court for each defensive possession knows that is where the junior guard excels. 
Sunday, those defensive skills will be tested once again as No. 4 Pittsburgh and Preseason Big East Player of the Year Brandin Knight travel to the Joyce Center. 
The Panther point guard averages 10.3 points and 6.5 assists a game this year and is often revered as one of the most explosive players in the game. 
Along with Thomas, Jones will often have the burden of staying close to the quick Panther guard Knight. 
"Knight is one of the best players in the game. and it's always a challenge to guard someone of his skill level,· Jones said. "Obviously he wouldn't be where he is today if he couldn't handle the man pressure. If it falls on me to guard him, hopefully I'll be able to slow him down." 
If the Irish are to upset Knight and the Panthers Sunday, Jones will be a big part of the action coming off the bench and giving that some­thing extra to the Irish effort as he has for most of the season. 
"I like coming off the bench a lot," Jones said. "I know I'm just as influential in the game as any other guy, and some­times you need to have a guy who can spark you again."

Bryant's 46 pushes Los Angeles above .500 
Associated Press 
NEWYORK 
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal have the Los Angeles Lakers playing like champions again. 
Bryant dazzled New York with an array of drives, jumpers and dunks, and O'Neal overpowered the Knicks inside as the Lakers won 114-109 to enter the All­Star break with a winning record for the first time this season. 
"Kobe and Shaq have shown they're the top two dogs in the league," teammate Robert Horry said. "They're carrying us. You have to give the credit to those two guys." 
Bryant matched his season high with 46 poinl.s and O'Neal added 33 as the Knicks had no answer for Los Angeles' dynamic duo. Bryant (40) and O'Neal (28) combined to outscore the Knicks in the first three quarters as the Lakers took a 97-67 lead. 
The Lakers (24-23) then sur­vived a spirited fourth-quarter rally by the Knicks to end the first half of the season with their fifth straight win, including four on the road. 
"That was quite a show the first three quarters," Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. "Shaq and Kobe put on a show tonight. It was a spectacular perfor­mance by Kobe tonight." 
After a sluggish start left the Lakers 11-19 following a Christmas Day loss to

Sacramento, the three-time defending champions have won 13 of 17 to close within 11/2 games of Houston for the final playoff spot in the West. 
"We just have to keep doing it," Jackson said. "The champi­onship rings don't mean any­thing unless we do it on the court. We found out the hard way that no one is really impressed by the championship banuers." 
Bryant and O'Neal are a differ­ent story. 
Bryant has scored at least 35 points in five straight games, scoring 201 points in that stretch. This scoring spree coin­cides with Jackson telling Bryant to take over more of the scoring load. 
"He's opened the offense up and allowed me to penetrate more," Bryant said. 'Tm getting the ball in position where I can score quickly. I'm being more assertive." 
The Knicks, who had won seven of 10, played the second half without leading scorer Allan Houston. who left the game with a bruised right wrist and is day to day. 
Latrell Sprewell led New York with 24 points, Howard Eisleyadded 16 and Charlie Ward had 15 points and 11 assists. 
Bryant had 16 of his 22 third­quarter points during a 25-9 run that put the Lakers up 95-61 with 1:41 to go.

Bryant started the run with a driving layup, knifing through the center of the Knicks' defense for the easy basket. He added three 3-pointers, a runner and a turnaround jumper from deep on the baseline. He flexed after his final 3 gave the Lakers a 34­point lead. 
The Knicks didn't go away, scoring the first 16 points of the fourth quarter to get within 14. 
Sprewell. who made all nine of his 3-pointers Tuesday against the Clippers, hit a 3 to make it 103-91 with 5:34 to go. 
A jumper by Michael Doleac made it 107-100 with 2;45 to go. After a turnover by Bryant, Lee Nailon scored underneath to make it a five-point game with 
1:52 to go. 
After another Lakers' turnover. O'Neal blocked Sprewell's layup attempt and made one free throw to make it 108-102. 
Sprewell shot an airball when Bryant appeared to hit his arm on the way up. Bryant then hit two free throws to make it 110­102 with 30.3 seconds to play. 
"Absolutely I was fouled on the play," Sprewell said. "To me it was an easy call." 
Bucks 97, SuperSonlcs 91

NEW YORK 

Joso Contreras has a nickname 
as sharp as his pitches: "El Titan 
de Bronze." 
And, he says, it was given to him by Fidel Castro. 
Contreras finally made it to Yankee Stadium to finalize his four-year contract, $32 million contract. 
At his introductory news con­ference, Contreras said the Cuban president called him "The Titan of Bronze" because the right-hander was the Cuban ace. The nickname originally belonged to Antonio Maceo, the general who led the Cuban liber­ation army against Spain in the 19th century. 
Contreras, however, wouldn't say what he thinks about Castro, whose communist regime has caused many Cuban baseball stars to defect. leaving their fam­ilies behind. 
"l can talk about Cuba. 1 can talk about Cuban baseball," Contreras said through a trans­lator. "But I'm not here as a politician to talk about politics." 
Dressed in a double-breasted blue-gray suit, the 6-foot-4 right­hander spoke softly about his departure from Cuba last fall and his hopes to make his mark in ihe major leagues. 
llis model is Roger Clemens, one of his new teammates in pinstripes. Will the Titan pitch inside, just like the Rocket? 
"Si, si, si," Contreras said, words agent Jaime Torres didn't need to translate. 
"That's the difference for a 
pitcher," Contreras said_ "That's 
how a pitcher lives, pitching 
inside." 
Asked what he admired in 
Clemens, Contreras cited "great, 
incredible physical condition and 
abilities," "pitching strategy" 
and "guts and bravado." 
Contreras, who has a burly chest and tree-trunk legs, will get to start showing his stuff next week, when the Yankees open spring training in Tampa, Fla. He'll be scrutinized along with the team's other new for­eign acquisition, outfielder Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui. 
"These people have been superstars in their respective leagues," said Yankees manager Joe Torre, looking tan following a six-week vacation in Maui. "I'm curious. I really am. They're both going to need inter­preters. But I bet they under­stand each other." 
Contreras did not get quite the welcome given Matsui, a three­time MVP in Japan. When Matsui was introduced Jan. 14, the Yankees held a news confer­ence at a Times Square hotel, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the official greeter. 
Thursday's fiesta was held in the Stadium Club of Yankee Stadium, and Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. wel­comed him "on behalf of all New Yorkers and 1.4 million resi­dents of the Bronx, many of Latino descent."

NHL 
Bankrupt Sabres seek additional credit line 
Aswdaied Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. 

Along with asking for an addi­tional $15 million line of credit to cover operating expenses. the bankrupt Buffalo Sabres are seeking court approval to pay four players their deferred sign­ing bonuses. 
Sabres' attorney William Thomas is scheduled to make both reques~ in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Buffalo. 
The request for an additional line of credit was not unexpect­ed. Judge Michael J. Kaplan granted the Sabres up to $25 million in debtors-in-possession financing when he approved an initial $10 million line of credit after the team filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
The Sabres, in jeopardy of folding or moving after the end of this season, owe their 40 largest creditors more than $206 million. 
The list of creditors includes four current players -forward Curtis Brown, goaltender Ryan Miller and defensemen Jay McKee and Brian Campbell. They are owed a combined $541,666 in deferred signing bonus money due last month. 
Miller, who is owed $250,000, was not among the initial list of creditors because his signing bonus came due on Jan. 15, two days after the Sabres filed for bankruptcy. 
If not paid, all four could be eligible to become unrestricted free agents at the end of this season. 
In a written motion submitted to the judge, Thomas argues that failure to pay the players would cause both "distraction and neg­ative publicity," and "lower the morale of the team and its fans (and) potentially result in lower 
-
attendance at games." 
Thomas also argues that fail­ing to pay the players would reduce the franchise's value "and impede the debtors' efforts to sell its assets." 
Herb Pinder, who represents Brown, welcomed the news while noting the Sabres had assured him Brown's $133,333 bonus would be paid in early February. 
"It's right on schedule," Pinder said. "We've obviously been expecting this, understanding that it was corning.... Under the circumstances, it's understand­able and at the end of the day no big deal." 
Miller's agent, Mike Liut, was also pleased the bonus issue was being addressed. 
"This was going to get resolved sooner or later. I'd rather it being sooner and rather have a hockey team in Buffalo," Liut said. 
McKee, who's owed $133,333. and Campbell ($25,000) could not be reached for comment. 
The Sabres' future has been in limbo since the NHL took control of the team last June. The team's sale hit a major setback this week when prospective owner Mark Hamister suspend­ed his bid after his majority part­ner Todd Berman withdrew his $27 million share. 
Rochester billionaire B. Thomas Golisano, whose bid was rejected by the NHL last November, has since re-entered the bidding process and could submit a new offer by next week. 
Golisano, however, would like­ly have to restructure his initial offer to satisfy both the NHL and Adelphia Communications, one of the nation's largest cable tele­vision companies and the Sabres' largest creditor.

Raiders get appeals ruling 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO 
The Oakland Raiders weren't able to beat Tampa Bay in the Super Bowl. but they're winning parts of a battle with the Internal Revenue Ser\'ice. 
A federal appeals court ordered renewed litigation on the Raiders' income tax chal­lenge stemming from the team's failed proposal to move to Irwindale. 
In a separate action, the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also sided with the Raiders over a tax dispute stemming from a scuttled agreement to build lux­ury boxes at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
On that issue, the dispute was whether the team should pay taxes on a $4 million loan it received from the Coliseum Commission. Under IRS rules, Joans generally are not taxable income. 
Tho $4 million was given in 1984 to help the then-Los Angeles Raiders pay for 150 luxury boxes. That construction project, the subject of other liti­gation, was never finished. 

The IRS and the federal tax court said the $4 million should have been included in the team's 1984 taxable income. They concluded it was not a loan. The court said the money was taxable because the agree­ment to build the luxury boxes never bore fruit and the Raiders kept the payoff. 
The 9th Circuit, however, con­cluded Thursday that it was a nontaxable loan as part of a failed agreement and therefore should not have been included in the team's income. 
In the other tax case, the appeals court ordered more liti­gation on whether the Raiders should have been taxed for $1 O million advanced to the team in 1987 as part of a $115 million proposed loan from the city of Irwindale. The money was sup­posed to be used to build a sta­dium in that suburb just east of Los Angeles. 
The $115 million would have come from lrwindale's sale of bonds. But in 1988, the California Legislature said the city could not follow through with the bond sale. The propos­al collapsed and the Raiders did not repay the $10 million. 
The tax court concluded that, since the deal terminated upon the demise of the bond sales in 1988, the Raiders should have included that $10 million as income in their taxes that year because the loan had converted into income. 
But the appeals court orden'ld the tax court to consider whether the $10 million loan ever became taxable because it was tied to a project that unrav­eled. And if the $10 million did become taxable, the appeals court said, the tax court should consider whether 1988 was the applicable year.

After slow start, Irish look to keep winning 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Spons Writer 
It took five matches -and the worst start in program history -for the Irish finallv to earn their first win of the season. 
Saturday, in West Lafayette, Ind., they hope to make Tuesday's win over Wisconsin the beginning of a win streak. 
After suffering four defeats, the Irish began to miss the thrill of winning matches. They hope the taste of Tuesday's triumph will increase their appetite for victory. 
The Boilermakers, ranked 46th nationally. may prove to be a more formidable foe than the Badgers. Notre Dame dominat­ed Wisconsin, 7 -0. 
"Purdue is a good team," junior Matt Scott said. "They're probably a better team than Wisconsin." 
Both the Irish and the Boilermakers face tough sched­ules this weekend. No. 10 Duke will visit Notre Dame on Sunday. Purdue begins a three-match homestand with a Friday match against Toledo. After Saturday's bout with the Irish, Purdue will contend with No. 57 Western Michigan Sunday. 
Under coach Bobby Bayliss, Notre Dame has never lost to Purdue. Last season, the Irish posted two shutouts against the Boilermakers, including a 4-0 victory in the second round of the NCAA tournament. And it was two current Irish players, sophomore Brent D'Amico and junior Luis Haddock, who clinched the doubles point that turned the tide in that match. Because of those stats, chances are high Purdue will be looking to make a killing against a 1-4 Notre Dame squad that has struggled this season. 
"We're going to expect a bat­tle," Scott said. "It's not an easy place to play. We're up for the challenge. and I like our chances. With [Tuesday's] win, we can use it to boost our confi­dence and take it hard to Purdue." 
A Purdue injury could poten­tially bode well for the Irish. The Boilermakers' number one play­er, Scott Mayor, ranked 120th in the nation, may not play during one of the team's three weekend matches. Mayer had elbow surgery in November and the team does not want to aggravate the injury. 
When Notre Dame welcomes Duke to the Eck Pavilion Sunday, the Blue Devils will either be rejoicing or recovering after their Friday road match with No. 2 Illinois. The Illini defeated the Irish Jan. 29. 
"[The Duke match] will be a tough battle," Haddock said. "Once again, we won't be expected tu win. We have a chance. It's just a matter of trusting ourselves." 
The Blue Devil squad boasts a good deal of talent, including junior Phillip King, who has been ranked as high as second nationally. Additionally, two Duke doubles pairs are top-25 caliber. Duke returns five of the top six players from the 2002 squad that finished ranked 17th after losing to Kentucky in the Round of 16 in last year's NCAA tournament's. 
The Irish believe they are improving and overcoming their inexperience as a whole, and the team wants the win over Wisconsin to carry them mental­ly into this weekend. Additionally, Notre Dame hopes that its four initial defeats will serve as valuable lessons for a young Irish squad. 
"We know it's a process," D'Amico said. "If you do the right things every day, good things will come out of it."

Belles hope to avoid sting 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Spores Writer 
To say that Saint Mary's has had a rough 2003 would be an understatement. After winning four games in 2002, the Belles have only won one game since the New Year began, as they have lost eight in a row, with their last win coming on Jan. 8. 
However, Saturday presents the Belles with yet another opportunity to turn things around, as they travel to Kalamazoo to face the Hornets, who are tied for sec­ond place in the MIAA. 
Kalamazoo (12-7, 6-3 in the MIAA), comes off a 56-52 win over Alma, while the Belles (5­15, 1-8}, look to rebound from
-
a 77 -47 loss to Hope. The last time these two teams met, it was a battle until the end, as the Hornets pulled away with a 60-53 victory. These two teams arc evenly 
matched, despite their differ­ent records. Kalamazoo is seventh in the MIAA in scor­ing, and Saint Mary's is eighth, averaging 59.2, and 
57.1 points per game, respec­tively. Another plus for the Belles is that the Hornets are last in the MIAA in team rebounding, averaging only 
31.5 rebounds per game. Saint Mary's has struggled in that department as well, creating an even matchup. 
Sophomore forward Emily Creachbaum leads the Belles averaging 13.3 points, on 50 percent shooting, and 6.3 rebounds. However, she missed Wednesday's game with an ankle injury, and is only averaging 11.1 points and 
3.6 rebounds in conference play. 
Freshman guard Bridget Boyce (7 .8 points per game, 80 percent from the free-throw line). and Anne Hogan (7 .3 points, 5 rebounds). also con­tribute on the offensive end for Saint Mary's. 
Kalamazoo will counter Saint Mary's with some bal­anced scoring of their own, led by Amanda Weishuhn, who is sixth in the MlAA, averaging 
13.6 points per game, to go along with 5.9 rebounds. Vanessa Larkin (11.4 points), and Alissa Johnston (10. 7 points), also average double figures for the Hornets. 
Larkin, who has played well of late, was nominated for the MIAA Player of the Week, as was Saint Mary's point guard Katie Miller. Miller looks to help her team take better shots, as the Belles struggled against Hope, shooting 21 per­cent from the field, and are only averaging 36 percent for the season, while their oppo­nents average 43 percent from the field.

field that could break four minutes," Irish coach Joe Piane said. "We need Luke to run well." 
In addition to Watson, both the mens and womens teams will be looking to continue their strong early season per­formances this weekend. 
The men have been led by their distance group and sprinter Selim Nurudeen. Nurudeen is among the Big East leaders in the 60-meter dash and the 60-meter hur­dles, and is expected to con­tent for the 60-meter hurdles title at the Big East Championships. In addition to Watson, the Irish have many other runners that either are looking to qualify for the Big East Championship or are looking to strengthen their already solid qualifying times for that event. 
"We still need to get a few more people in the Big East," said Piane. 
For the women, the Irish will be looking for continued production from seniors Tameisha King and Jaime Volkmer. Also important will 
be the depth of the Irish 

,l'Spririters, including Big East qualifiers Kymia Love and Kristen Dodd. Lauren King and Molly Huddle will be look­ing to improve on their already strong times in the distance events. The field this weekend will also include many talented athletes, making the Meyo one of the most important indoor meets in the Midwest. The mens and womens teams for Michigan feature NCAA qualifiers, as the mens distance medley relay team also qualified for the NCAA's at the adidas Boston Games. Darnell Talbert will challenge Nurudeen in the 60-meter hurdles. Arkansas' women team fea­tures NCAA mile qualifier Christin Wurth, while Angel Heath, the NCAA runner-up in the long jump last year, will challenge King in that event. Clemson's Joana Costa is also expected to challenge Volkmer in the pole vault. Costa has previously qualified for the 2002 NCAA Championship and is a former ACC Champion in the event.

Oakland provides last chance to break even 
By LISA REIJUlA 
Sports Wrircr 
Notre Dame's mens swimming and diving team will have one last chance to get back to .500 this weekend. The Irish will travel to Rochester. Mich., for a dual meet against Oakland University Saturday. 
Last weekend the Irish beat Cleveland State before losing by the slimmest of margins to St. Bonaventure on the last relay. Notre Dame currently has a dual meet record of 6-7. 
"We want to finish out the season strong," freshman Patrick Heffernan said. "We need to get some races in and we'd like Lo get a win." 
Notre Dame showed its fighting side against the talented Bonnies. Down for the majority of the meet, the Irish ral­lied to gain a slight lead before the heartbreaking finish. 
Oakland (8-5) and Notre Dame have faced several of the same opponents over the course of the season. Both teams foll to a tough Pittsburgh team, and both also beat Michigan State. However. the Grizzlies defeated St. Bonaventure on the road in January. 
A standout for Oakland this season has been freshman Scott Dickens. Dickens set new Mid-Continent Conference records in both the 100 and 200-meter breaststrokes this year. 
Named the conference's Newcomer of the Year and Co-Swimmer of the Year, Dickens is also a member of the Canadian National Junior Team. 
Dickens earned four medals for Canada at the Australian Youth Olympic Festival and is aiming for the 2004 Olympic Games. He will be a for­midable opponent for the Irish on Saturday. 
''It should be an exciting meet for us,'' Heffernan said. 'There will be a lot of good races and I think we're up for it." 
The Irish will compete in the biggest meet of the season in two weeks, when the Big East Championships arc held in Uniondale, N.Y. The conference cham­pionships have been the long-term goal and focus of the team all year. 
"We're going to rest and get geared up for the big show that's coming up," said Heffernan of the team's plans. 
The meet is scheduled to start Saturday at 2 p.m.

FENCING 
Different goals this weekend at Duke Duals 
ByMAITLOZAR Sports Editor 
After two weekends of facing top competition, the mens and womens squads have two dif­ferent goals at this weekend's Duke Duals. 
The womens team (12-2) looks to rebound from losses the past two weekends to No. 4 Ohio State and No. l Penn State. With no top 10 teams on the schedule this weekend, the Irish should be able to address their areas of concern.

" Earlier this season at Penn State, the Cardinal lost 16-11 to the defending national champion Nittany Lions.

"They are a top team which always is in the top six in the country. We will check them out because we hear they are pretty strong but not super strong like Penn State," he said. "They are a dangerous team and have big individuals who can take others to victory. We have to be very focused this weekend." 
The Irish will be tested by the Cardinal mens foil squad. Junior Mark Mulholland and sophomore Steve Gerbermann each earned All-American honors at last year's NCAA Championships. Gerbermann defeated mens foil captain Ozren Debic for third place 15-9. 
Coming into the Duke Duals. the mens team looks to extend its 73-match winning streak, which is currently third longest in school history. 
Other schools scheduled to compete in Durham, N.C., this weekend include Air Force, the host Blue Devils, Johns Hopkins and North Carolina.

Georgetown] game was a great confidence builder for us," Irish coach Muffet McGraw. "Now we know how good we can be. We had a lot of fun too. Basketball was fun again and that was probably the best thing that came out of that game." 
Unfortunately for Notre Dame not many teams have fun when visiting Virginia Tech, the team the Irish face Saturday at 2 p.m. 
The Hokies, 15-5, 6-3 in conference, are 10-0 at home this season, while just 5-5 on the road or at neutral sites. 
"They have a tremendous home court record over the last three or four years," McGraw said. "It's a really tough place to play. So we have our work cut out for us." 
Junior forward leva Kublina, who averages 15.1 points per game, leads Virginia Tech, while Erin Gibson adds 11.8 points per contest. The Hokies distribute the scoring wealth

f i V e , " McGraw said. "Kublina is very difficult to guard. She can shoot threes and score inside; she can do a lot of good things." 
However, this may be a dif­ferent Notre Dame team from a week ago. They've got a lot more confidence and it'd showed against the Hoyas. Notre Dame had four players score in double figures and used a 23-0 run to cruise to a conference win. 
McGraw said she knows that the Irish are facing another formidable foe on the road, but she thinks her team will be ready for the challenge. 
"They have a very talented team and they're on a roll," McGraw said. "Every game is important now for us. We really need to go down there and play well."

a little bit was the widely accepted solution." 
One final recommendation that the committee discussed involved interest surveys and what part they played in decid­ing how many men and women participate in each sport. McGraw and the committee agreed that it would not be wise to base the number of partici­pants just on an interest survey. 

"Women have not always known they were interested in sports," McGraw said. "Look at the crew team. We had 140 women go out for the crew team, when probably 139 of them didn't row in high school. So I think there's a great exam­ple of how women are interest­ed." 
McGraw also expressed con­cern at the meeting for walk­ons. Under Title IX, walk-ons are counted in the percentage of men and women in each sport. 
But the committee recommend­ed that walk-ons not be counted in these percentages. 
"We as a committed group didn't think that was fair, so we voted that walk-ons not even be counted in that proportion," McGraw said. 
The group made their final recommendations Jan. 31 and submitted them to Secretary of Education Rod Paige.

Watson chasing a record 
. Irish host quality field at Meyo Invitational 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 

Having already qualified for the NCAA Indoor Championships in the 3,000 meters, Irish senior Luke Watson will be looking to add another great performance to the Irish record books Saturday as Notre Dame hosts the annu­al Meyo Invitational. 
The Meyo Invitational. held tonight and Saturday at the Loftus Sports Center, will high­Iight many of the top teams in the nation. Michigan, Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Windsor and Michigan State will be sending both their mens and womens teams, while Georgetown is sending only their men's team. Also compet­ing on the womens side are Arkansas, Maryland, Clemson and Tulane. 
In what could become the signature event of this year's Invitational. Watson will be looking to become the second Notre Dame runner ever to break the sub-four minute mile barrier against an elite field.

with Title IX," McGraw said. "We were sup­posed to listen, gather infor­mation and from that information make recom­mendations." 
The commis­sion started with 24 rec­law. 

One proposal said that schools should have 50 percent male athletes and 50 percent female athletes, no matter what per­centage of men and women attended the institution. That proposal tied at seven votes apiece. 
McGraw said she voted against that issue because she didn't want to lose opportuni­ties. 
The committee also voted on whether to keep and clarify the Title IX law. That recommenda­tion passed with a unanimous 15-0 vote. 
"We wanted to clarify [the law] for everybody," McGraw said. "That passed 15-0, so it was interesting that kind of leaving it alone, but clarifying it

MENS LACROSSE 
Irish host talented 
pro squad 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame mens lacrosse team will take on a team composed of current professional players, includ­ing several former Irish play­ers, in a scrimmage Saturday at 7 p.m. in Loftus. 
The Irish, who are ranked 17th in this year's Inside Lacrosse Magazine preseason poll, will face 11 teams ranked in the preseason top 25 this year. 
This weekend's scrimmage will be a good benchmark for the Irish, who are coming off a somewhat disappointing 5-8 record from last year. 
"This is a great way to pre­pare ourselves for the sea­son," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "We won't play a more talented team all year. We may play teams with bet­ter chemistry, but no one with better talent." 
Corrigan said the Irish opponent this weekend is "a bunch of guys" who make up some of the finest lacrosse talent in the world. 
Included on that team are Todd Rassas, a three time All­American while at Notre Dame; two-time Irish All­American Jimmy Keenan and the first All-American in Notre Dame history, Tom Glatzel. 
Corrigan said the team might have the two best offensive players in the world today, as well as a defense that includes three members of the U.S. National Team. 
"This will be a great test for us, not just man-to-man, but also to see how we play as a team," Corrigan said. 
The Irish will need to start strong this season, as their first game is a road matchup against No. 15 Penn State. Starting was no problem for the Irish last year; it was fin­ishing that was the team's Achilles' heel. 
Out of the eight Irish losses last year, six were one-goal games, and three were decid­ed in overtime. 
"We just couldn't seem to get over that hump," Corrigan said. "I think we're a little more determined this year."

This law has been criticized for hurting male sports while praised for improving female participation in athletics. 
The commission was sup­posed to suggest ways to ommendations at the end of the four town hall meetings, and passed 22. McGraw said about half of the recommendation were general, while the other 11 were specific to changing the
