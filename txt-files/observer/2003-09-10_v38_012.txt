Elam was

on the charge of sexual battery. 

The woman claims the four football players sexually assault­ed her multiple times the morn­ing of March 28, 2002 at Smith's off-campus home. She testified today that she was too scared and in too much pain to leave Smith's home after the alleged gang rape and waited to report it because she did not think accus­ing Notre Dame football players would win her much sympathy. 
Jury selection for the trial started Monday and was a lengthy process as special prose­cutoc Maureen Devlin and defense attorneys William Stanley and Michael Tuszynski questioned the approximately 90 potential jurors. The juror pool was larger than usual for this case due to fears that ·the pool may be tainted by the extensive media coverage throughout Elam's trial. 
The trials for Crawford and Smith begin later this year.

SMC vaccinates against meningitis 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Health and Wellness Services provided their third annual vaccination clinic for meningococcal disease, or bacterial meningitis, on Tuesday. 
With recent research showing that first year college students have a higher rate of contract­ing meningitis, awareness of the illness and vaccine is increasing. 
This fall semester, colleges are begiiming to fully implement the state statute issued in October 2002 that required colleges in the state of Indiana to inform students and their parents of the risks associated with the disease, as well as the availabil­ity and effectiveness of vaccina­tion. Those students who decline vaccination must sign waivers.

County 
rezones 



parcel 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
The St. Joseph County Council unanimously approved the rezoning of a land parcel near Notre Dame which will become a new upscale residential development near Notre Dame. 
Dan Folny and Nicholas Tyszka, who formed the development company DNPEG. decided to build "Irish Crossings" as a resi­dential location for profes­sors and administrators that is close to Notre Dame, citing a need for an upscale community within walking distance of the campus and a retail area. 
The site is located on 
8.25 acres between Willis and Burdette Streets one block east of Notre Dame. Final plans for the develop­ment are awaiting approval and Foley expects the 11rst villas to be completed in spring 2004. 
"We knew people who wanted an upscale living area that was an alterna­tive to Granger," Foley said. "Hight now the area is a hodge-podge of different homes. Some arc rented, some are owned and some arc run-down. People arc very hesitant to invest there, but by making this into a community, people can be assured they have made a sound investment." 
The development. which will begin construction this fall; will have a maximum of 70 single-detached and duplex villas. The entry price for a 1,600 square­foot duplex villa with a basement and attached garage will be $189,000, Foley Sdid in a press release. 
Foley said "Irish Crossings," which comple­ments Notre Dame's mas­ter plan to rejuvenate the area adjacent. to the University, could have a ripple effect on the area by improving the surrounding residential community and increasing the property values over the next five to 10years. 
Foley and Tyszka decided to develop this land in May after learning the county council, in a 8-1 decision. voted against the develop­ment of a tailgate park on the same site.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Co111plainers 
be-ware 

I always thought writing the Inside Column for The Observer would be a great gig. You've got four hundred words to complain about ... well, any­thing you want, really. 
But when I got the fateful call to 
actually write this N" 1 z k column, I had to ICO e 00 rack my brain to find a topic. For Staf!Writer 
once, I had noth­ing to whine about. So I turned to my best resource -my room­mates. 
"What about the dining hall?" they said. True, the lack of a deli or sun­dae bar (and pretty much any good food) has been the major topic of con­versation in our room since school resumed. But the fine quality of the SMC dining hall is a topic that has been beaten to death in the pages of this paper. 
So the roommates left me back where I started. Other friends didn't leave me with too much either­book prices skyrocketing (no news there), no money to buy beer (I'm not 21, can't complain about that), and how hard it is to get football tickets if you're not a student (it's been done). 
I can't complain about the baseball season because this isn't the sports section. I can't complain about the people who write dumb crap on the sidewalks, because I would dread opening my e-mail for the next two weeks. 
I can't complain about the masses of poison ivy down by the lakes, because I haven't rolled in it. I can't complain about the South Bend weather, because it's great so far this year. And as much as it irritates me, I can't even complain about the con­struction on campus, because my hall is so far away that I can sleep through all of it-and regularly do. 
For the first time in my life I had an open forum to gripe to the masses, or the ten people that read this, anyway. I just couldn't think of a single thing that bothered me enough to write about! 
So I perused through some old issues of The Observer, looking for some ideas. I figured I could steal some poor sap's argument. 
And while I was looking, I really did run across something to complain about. · 
I cannot stand the people who write in to The Observer to complain about dumb stuff. Really -do we need to go over and over the same argument about whether or not Notre Dame should support homosexuals? The same letter-to-the-editor rant between SMC and ND girls? The never-ending concern with the schools' policies on alcohol, tailgating and party busts? 
Trust me. No moans to The Observer are going to change the way the University works, how people feel about war or even the Saint Mary's DH. So please-next time you feel a spiteful letter coming on, turn on some music, let in some fresh air and just be happy to be alive. 
You have nothing to complain about.

Man falls into judges chamber 
DECATUR. Ga. -Ail inmate found himself before a judge sooner than he expeded when he fell through the courthouse ceiling into the judge's chambers while trying to escape, police said. 
Ben Rogozensky, 31, was one of about a dozen inmates awaiting hearings Monday when he was taken to the empty jury room to speak with his attorney. 

The inmate asked to go into the adjacent restroom and from there climbed into the ceiling crawl space, DeKalb County sher­iff's spokeswoman Mikki Jones said. 
State Court Judge J. Antonio DelCampo was in the courtroom when the barefoot Rogozensky fell through the ceiling and landed near the judge's desk in his chambers. 
Rogozensky was arrested Sept. 2 and charged with obstruction of officers and giving false information.

Graduate Union kicks off nevv year

Tlw l'irst Craduate Student Union nwcting of' the 2003-04 school year openNI with the unanimous approval of a new budget and a proposal for an economized council system that would d!)Crease the number of standing committees while inlTP<L<;ing their allotted stipends. 
Tlw tl'ntatiVP budget is set at $11 ].h~:3 with a projected $2f>.000 surplus rolled over from last yPar. llowev1~r. because the budget calculations are based in part on tlw $55 file paid by grad­uate studenl-;, and the number of actual stU<knL-; is said to be con­sidl'rably higlwr than was esti­rnatl'(l, council nwrnbers antici­patl~ higher numb1)rs when sta­tistics become availablll in

Tlw budg~~t includes modifica­tions on the stipends for the chairs of each of the GSU's standing cornmitteiJS. These changes st1~m from the proposal to reduce tlw number of comrnit­tiJns from 12 to llight. !hJeing up more morwy to be given to the remaining groups. 
"It is very diflicult to find peo­ple every year willing to be dtqwd into working for the GSU," said Acadmnie A!l'airs Committee rhairman Tim Dale, adding that the condPnsed committees would mean more shared work, less recruiting issues and more morwy for the members to work with. 
"I think the plan sounds entire­ly sensible, and students arc being paid fairly for the time they put in," said llolly Vanderwall, a history and philosophy of science graduate student. 
Both the budget and the reduc­tion of committees were approved unanimously, though a second budgetary proposal may be necessary when fund statistics are solidified in late fall. Since the committee plan involves amending the GSU constitution, there must be two consecutive majority votes at two consecutive meetings for it to pass. 
In other GSU news:

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The record­ing industry has taken its pira­cy fight directly to music fans, suing more than 200 people this week alone. Now comes the hard part: Persuading the very people it has threatened with legal action to. revisit music stores or to sample legal down­loading services. 
It might prove difficult to do so, some observers say, because the industry's lawsuit campaign could spark a consumer back­lash spurred by the discontent many music fans already feel over soaring CD prices and the reduction of retailers offering varied music titles. 
"The real hope here is that people will return to the record store," said Eric Garland, CEO of BigCampagne LLC, which tracks peer-to-peer Internet trends. "The biggest question is whether singling out a handful of copyright infringers will invigorate business or drive file-sharing further under­ground, further out of reach." 
Jason Rich, of Watervliet, N.Y., said the record compa­nies' campaign prompted him to stop downloading music from file-sharing networks, but he called the issue "disconcert­ing." 
"I think it's kind of silly to go after individuals," said Rich, 26. "There are so many Web sites out there, people don't know necessarily they're doing any­thing wrong."

Nevertheless. the program included lectures from the Turkish and Indian ambassa­dors to Israel. 
The program primarily took place in Tel Aviv, and although the students were not injured, there were two suicide attacks in the city's suburbs, and two days after they group departed from Israel, another suicide attack on a Jerusalem bus left 18 dead and over 100 wounded.

The industry sued 261 people on Monday and has promised to sue hundreds more in coming weeks as it strives to stamp out music piracy it blames for a three-year slump in CD sales. 
The Recording Industry Association of America settled the first of the suits Tuesday for $2,000 -with the mother of a 12-year-old defendant, Brianna LaHara of New York. Brianna was accused of downloading more than 1,000 songs using Kazaa.

It was the second time this year the nation failnd to make a payment to a multilatPral lendnr. It also missed a deadline on a $fJH 1 million payment to the World Bank in January.

U.S. alleges Iranian nuclear violations 
VIENNA. Austria-The United States accused Iran on Tuesday of violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but said Tehran had "a last chance" to prove it wasn't running a covert weapons program. 
Backed by key allies. chief U.S. delegate Kenneth Brill took Iran to task on the basis of a report outlining discrepancies between its past statements on its nuclear program and findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The report. by IAEA chief Mohamed EI-Baradei, lists the discovery of weapons­grade enriched uranium and other evidence that critics say point to a weapons program. 
"The United States believes the facts already established would fully justify an immediate finding of noncompliance by Iran," Brill said at a meeting of the agency's board. Still, he said, the Americans were ready to give "Iran a last chance to drop its evasions" before pushing for punitive action.

Democratic candidates criticize Bush 
BALTIMORE -Sen. Joe Lieberman accused Howard Dean in a campaign debate Tuesday night of turning his back on Israel, and the Democratic presidential front-runner shot back that he and former President Bill Clinton held the same view on the issue. 
"It doesn't help ... to demagogue this issue," Dean quickly added in the sharpest clash of the young Democratic debate season. 
Two days before the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, Democrats criticized President Bush's handling of the war on terror at the same time they began to sketch out their differences on foreign policy. 
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio criticized Hep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri for voting to sup­port the war in Iraq. 
Without mentioning any names, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida attacked Democrats for voting for the same legislation, saying they "gave the president a blank check."

Domus Properties educates students about safety issues 
By KATE DOOLEY 
News Writer 
Domus Properties spon­sored a seminar Tuesday to educate its tenants about personal safety and hosting responsible parties. 
The company rents over 38 houses to students and said they have a vested interest in educating their tenants about personal safety. 
"We do this for the students because we are concerned about them and their safety," Mark Kramer. owner of Domus Properties, said. 
Speakers at the annual BBQ and seminar included repre­sentatives of the South Bend Police Department, the South Bend Code Enforcement Department, Notre Dame Security, and Residence Life. 
The speakers focused on potential issues students may face and ways these issues can be prevented. 
Patrick Hechlinski, a South Bend Police officer, said that the seminar is a good way to 

educate students who may be living on their own for the first time. 
"We want to make sure stu­dents are alert and using their street smarts while they are living off-campus," he said. 
He said that criminals are looking for easy targets, so the best prevention is being aware of your surroundings. Hechlinski added that the seminar is not specifically in response to crime or prob­lems in the area, but instead organized for preventative reasons. 
"By hosting the seminar, we are taking pro-active steps to prevent problems", he said. 
The police officers gave students phone numbers that they can call for help and informed them of programs the police department offers to assist students. 
One program is a Homewatch service, where officers will monitor a house while its tenants are on break, to help prevent break-
Boston Archdiocese settles for $85 m_illion 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -The Boston Archdiocese agreed Tuesday to pay $85 million to 552 people who claim sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests devas­tated their lives, giving victims long-awaited recognition of their pain and the U.S. church a chance to move forward from its worst scandal ever. 
The deal is the largest pub­licly disclosed payout by a U.S. diocese to settle molestation charges. 
Finalized after months of negotiations, the pact came with a new pledge from the church to prevent abuse in the future and a sense from vic­tims that the burden of their anguish has been lightened. 
"This piece of paper means one thing to me and many men I represent here today. From this day forward I am not an alleged victim of clergy abuse. I am recognized, I'm a sur­vivor," said Gary Bergeron, who sued for molestation by the late Father Joseph Birmingham. 
Under the agreement, vic­tims will receive awards rang­ing from $80,000 to $300,000. Award amounts will be decid­ed by a mediator, based on the type of molestation, the dura­tion of the abuse, and the injury suffered. 
Parents who filed lawsuits claiming their children were abused will receive $20,000. 
The church also will provide for psychological counseling for victims for as long as they want it, and will put some vic­tims on advisory boards moni­toring the abuse problem. 
Boston's new archbishop, Sean O'Malley, was in Washington at a meeting of the 
U.5. Conference of Catholic Bishops as the deal was struck but sat in on critical negotia­tions over the weekend. 
"It's a good day for the arch­diocese," said his spokesman, the Father Christopher Coyne. 

"We haven't had too many over the last couple of years, but this is one." 
The archdiocese also released a statement saying in part that it is "comn:itted to doing everything humanly pos­sible to make sure that this never occurs again. Our prayer is that this may, with the help of God, become a reality." 
Coyne said the church is still looking for ways to finance the settlement. Possible revenue sources include selling off surplus property and suing the archdiocese's insurance carrier&. 
ins. 
Along with safety tips, Hechlinski also warned stu­dents of the ramifications of violating South Bend laws. He wanted students to be aware of the fact that they could receive citations for serving underage drinkers or breaking noise ordinances. 

Residence life and Notre Dame security also addressed the idea that actions by stu­dents off-campus have real consequences. 
He said that the University expects students to respect duLac rules even when they are living off-campus. 
"Just because you are off-
campus, certain types of behavior will still come to the attention of Resident Life," Rick Kazm ierzak, a Notre Dame Security and Police officer, said.

NO joins prepaid tuition program 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Notre Dame has joined a popular prepaid-tuition program which offers sig­nificant tax benefits to families, University officials announced. 
.Joseph Husso, director of the Office of Student Financial Services, praised what he called "a more secure approach" to saving for college. 
The program, called the Independent 529 Plan, allows families to lock in the current level of tuition and fees -minus a small discount -by contributing to a specially managed investment account. Contributions of up to $110,000 arc not subject to the federal gift tax, and the investment grows tax-free, as long as the funds are used for educational expenses. 
The accounts are also portable, meaning the money can be used at any of the 200 participating private collegPs and uni­versities. In the event a beneficiary attends a pub­lic or non-participating pri­vate institution, the funds can be used for those expenses without penalty. 
While 529 plans -which get their name from the section of the tax code that authorized them -have been around since 1997, they were administered by "We're taking a national eting tuition bills in the are still in grade school, or states, with the intent that leadership role, and we're . future.

Study urges society to battle underage drinking 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Alcohol and youth make a dangerous combi­nation, a $53 billio11 problem that can lead to increased crime and traffic deaths and one the gov­ernment, parents and industry need to solve, the Institute of Medicine said Tuesday. 

The institute, a health policy advisory center affiliated with the National Academies, urged high­er federal and state taxes on alcoholic beverages, tougher state drinking laws, better state identification cards and improved policies for detecting and stop­ping underage

"There's still too much adver­tising in the magazines and on the television and radio pro­grams that attract our kids," he said. 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest welcomed the Institute of Medicine report as "a historic first step toward ending decades of complacency about one of the most damaging and widespread public health and safety threats facing society." 
Alcohol use is deeply rooted in American society. the report observed, but underage drinking is a significant factor in traffic fatalities, suicide, violent crimes and academic failure. 
Hichard Bonnie, a professor at the University of Virginia and chairman of the institute's com­mittee that prepared the analysis. said a major goal needs to be to persuade adults to avoid behav­ior that would encourage under­age drinking. 
The need is a "comprehensive program involving all sectors of society and a common accep­tance of responsibility," he said. 
The committee estimated the cost to American society of underage drinking at $53 billion annually in losses stemming from crime, traffic crashes and other activities. 
A 2002 study found that 72 percent of 12th graders and 39 percent of eighth graders report­ed having consumed alcohol in the previous year. 
Federal and state excise taxes are potentially important tools for preventing and reducing under­age drinking, the report suggest'i. The committee said that even small changes in these taxes can reduce drinking by youths, who tend to have limited incomes. 
Bonnie said he expects opposi­tion to higher taxes, but evidence shows that they have a significant impact on youth drinking. 
State taxes vary. but federal alcohol taxes amount to $2.14 per 750-ml bottle of 80 proof spirits, 33 cents per six-pack of beer and 21 cents per bottle of wine. 


Three wounded in Calif. drive-by 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Three teenage students were critically wounded in an apparent drive­by shooting across the street from a San Fernando Valley high school Tuesday afternoon. 
Police Chief William Bratton said investigators believed the shooter, one of three people in a car, missed an intended tar­get, instead hitting three of the hundreds of students in the area. 
Someone in the car yelled out "where are you from," police said, describing that as gang language. 
A 17 -year-old girl and a 16­year-old boy were rushed by ambulance to trauma centers and a 15-year-old boy was flown by helicopter to a hospi­tal. said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. 

Blood and book bags remained on the sidewalk where paramedics treated the teens. 
All were students at Taft High School in the Woodland Hills area, said Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman Francine Eisenrod. Their par­ents were notified, but the school declined to release their identities. 
"We do know those children were not gang-involved. They were innocent kids," said Taft interim Principal Pete Ferry. "This is a community crisis that we just aren't used to." 
The victims had been stand­ing at a bus stop across the street from the school, police said. 
Steven Montalvo. a student at Taft, said he was waiting for the bus when he heard the gun­shots. He thought they were fireworks at first. 
"All of a sudden two more shots, and everybody started running," he told KCAL-TV. Montalvo said the girl was shot in the stomach, and one of the boys was shot in the chest. 
Taft's 3,400 students had been given a scheduled early release about 1:30 p.m. and the shooting occurred about a half­hour later, school district spokeswoman Hilda Hamirez said. 
Officials planned to have cri­sis teams at the school when classes resumed Wednesday. 


Barnes & Noble ends e-book sales 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Barnes & Noble.com, once an aggressive competitor in the electronic market, stopped selling e-books Tuesday, citing both limited sales and limited technology. 
"We did not see sales take otT as we and many others had anticipated," Daniel Blackman, vice president and general manager of Barnes & Noble.com, said Tuesday. 
"The other factor is that con­sumers haven't embraced the technology. There isn't wide­spread adoption of an afford­able and an easy to use e-book device." 
In an e-mail sent to cus­tomers. Barnes & Noble.com said that those who purchased an e-book in the Adobe format have 90 days from the date of purchase to complete their download. People using Microsoft have until Dec. 9 to access their e-books. 

"In the short term, it's disap­pointing," said Arthur Klebanoff. founder of RosettaBooks, which sells digi­tal versions of works by Pat Conroy, William Styron and oth­ers. 
"But it's also true that if the market keeps growing, and I think it will, they'll be back in with both feet." 
Demand for e-books has been growing quickly, but remains relatively tiny. According to the Open eBook Forum. a trade organization, e-book sales totaled about $5 million in the first half of 2003, compared to $3.8 million in the first half of 2002. 
"One bookseller dropping out will have no impact on Handom House's commitment to e­books," said Random House Inc. spokesman Stuart Applebaum. 
Open eBook Forum executive director Nick Bogaty said he has no individual corporate sta­tistics, but believes Barnes & Noble.com had just a small per­centage of sales. Palm Digital Media, OverDrive, Inc., and Amazon.com are among the leading e-book competitors, Bogaty says. 
Barnes & Noble.com had been quite active in the market, even starting its own digital imprint in 2001 and releasing an origi­nal work by Dean Koontz. 
"We all believe there is a future for e-books," Blackman said. "It's just not here yet."

attention for awhile -if not the whole night. The music is loudly blaring some unknown rap artist that I have no intention of hearing again after tonight. Everyone seems to be mov­ing in hyper drive, the frustrations of the week and a close football game having finally subsided. Usually, I would head straight for the doorman who holds the rights to housa cups but tonight I don't feel like drinking and I'm not sure why. Maybe the excitement found at the beginning of each school year is wearing off. Who knows? 
I weave in and out through the crowd and stop to have a couple two minute conversations with people that I know neither of us is going to remember the next day. In one of these chats, though, I come across some troubling information. My aim­lessness now has a goal and I begin to search. One person. One goal. I need to help out, do something. 
It isn't long before I pass through an open doorway and around the crowd that has accumulated near the keg.

Two steps in the opposite direction and I see her. Vertical streaks cover both sides of her face and her eyes remain locked on the center of the floor, empty and distant. I ask a friend of mine how long she's been like this and he says about an hour. I sit down next to her and without a word she slides one shoulder down and lays her head on my left shoul­der. Her body is trembling so I lift my arm over her head and pull he'r close with my left arm.

In a world of reality television and Jerry Springer, we've lost the will to interact with others peacefully. Instead of learning about the person we are talking to, it seems more appropriate to talk about someone else. Do we find ourselves, as individ­uals, so dull and boring that we have to delve into the lives of others in order to keep a conversation going?

Why do we, as human beings, do this? Why do we feel it necessary to bring to the forefront that which we know nothing about?

Let's Inake an Honor Code deal 
In tlw lirst part of this column, I argued that only a tiny fraction of honor code violations at Notre Dame arc IH~ing rPferrcd to honesty committees. I also suggested that this fact should alarm all of us, facuHy and stu­dents alike. In this concluding column, I wish to discuss how we might deal with the prob­

own dedication to academic intPgrity. Academic commissioners in the residence halls might ask themselves whether the maintenance of dorm Iiles, con­taining exams, essays and the like, is anything more than a smni-clandcstinc means or encouraging sucLess­ful cheating. Administrators could do a better job or Pducating new teachers about the honor code. Department chairs could discuss the code with their faculty and could appoint to honesty committees only those who will take their responsibility seriously. And instructors could be honest with themselves about why they might be inclined to ignore their obligations under the code and could think more carefully about the ~~xample they set when they do so. 
These are all rather conservative remedies. Some might feel that other, more radical courses or actions arc called for, such as scrapping the code entirely, say, or strengthening it by mandating much harsher penal­ties both for students who cheat and for faculty who ignorn the code. But one other intriguing possibility falls somewhere betwe1~n the tame and the wild: adopting what we might call a Let's Make a Deal honor code. 
Many honor-code universities explicitly give individual instructors the authority to confront students they sus­pect of dishonesty and to negotiate a litting punishment. Most of those universities require that both the instruc­tor and student sign (and send to the appropriate administrator) a form describing the offense and the agreed upon penalty. Should the student either deny the 1)-lk~~t~on, of dishonesty or feel ~hat the propose~ pun­ishmcr:Jt is inappropriate, an appeal is usually available. 
Notre Dame could easily adopt a Let's Make a Deal code. Faculty and students who reach an agreement would send a signed report to the associate provost's office, which would, as it does now, keep track of these files and impose additional sanctions on those guilty of recidivism. When agretJments could not be reached, cases would be forwarded to the relevant honesty com­mittees, which would handle cases exactly as they do how. Appeals of honesty committee decisions would also proceed as they do now. And all records would end up in the associate provost's office. 
What is there to be said for a Let's Make a Deal code? Provided that the procedures for reporting private agreements were simple and clear, many faculty would probably report. Such, at least, seems to have been the case at a number of universities that have adopted such a policy. Since Penn State moved to this type of system recently, roughly 400 cases have been report­ed per year. Under their old, all-cases-go-to-hear­ings system, the yearly average was less than 6. 

Faculty might thus be saved from the dishonesty inherent in the under-the­table deals they now make with students. Honesty commit­tees would probably need to meet even less often than they do now, thereby saving members a good deal of time and energy. Furthermore, since all records would eventually reach the associate provost's office, repeat offenders would find it much harder to escape detection. 
The likely advantages to a Let's Make a Deal code are thus apparent and significant-but so are the probable disadvantages. Since experience suggests that most stu­dents will go to great lengths to avoid the embarrass­ment involved in a full hearing, teachers would clearly have the upper hand in negotiating agreements. Though I have no doubt that most instructors would try to fashion just agreements. they would often be doing so while dealing with strong feelings of personal aiTront, feelings which are not the most conducive to students' receiving fair and consistent penalties. Furthermore, our current code, by insisting that all cases of apparent academic dishonesty be handled communally via set procedures, makes a strong statement about how grave an oll'ense cheating is, an offense against the whole 
academic community. No such statement is made when private deals arc sanctioned. On the contrary, some might argue that the offense of academic dishonesty is in fact trivialized by a university that treats it as a matter for in­class housecleaning. Many would no doubt discern an ele­ment of lowering our stan­
dards to match our practice were we to make such a shift. And it's not obvious 
that this is the best means of closing a gap between one's ideals and one's behavior. 

There are undoubtedly more pluses and more minuses connected to our moving toward such an alter­native. It is a change we should make, if at all, only after 
extended discussion. I believe, though, that it is a change worthy of such a discussion. Our honor code 
is far from a complete failure. But the code simply has not become the integral part of campus culture that its initiators 
hoped it would be. Whether this means that further changes to the code are in order, and (if so) whether mild or more radical amendments are called for, are matters eminently worthy of further thought and con­versation.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 


LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Observer should follow Church teachings 
The inaugural issue of The Observer provided incoming freshman with the following information: "The University I Iealth Center docs not prescribe birth control, but prescriptions can be filled at Planned Parenthood on 1818 Miami St. as another health resource." We take issue with The Observer promoting contraception and the world's largest abortion provider in direct opposition to the teaching of the Catholic Church. 
The Observer's position is that the paper has a duty to provide objective information to the student body, regardless of religious belief. That stance is appropriate when it comes to reporting the news. It is a different matter when the paper attempts to subvert a principled decision of the University. 
The Catholic Church has always embraced sexual intercourse as the uni­tive and procreative act of a married couple. Thus, the Church opposes con­traception because it frustrates these innate aspects of the sexual union. Notre Dame, in accordance with its Catholic mission, has made a conscien­tious decision not to offer contraception at the Health Center. In response, The Observer made an equally determined decision to provide students with information that will enable them to act in direct opposition to the moral goals of the University. Unlike advice concerning restaurants or auto repair, the use of contraception is a moral question and providing such information implies an editorial stance, regardless of the section in which it appears. 
Furthermore, rather than reference the various medical facilities in South Bend, The Observer specifically provided Planned Parenthood with free pub­licity. Far from a mere "health resource," the organization has a very specific agenda. Statistics show that for every pregnant woman who visits Planned Parenthood and decides to keep her child, 60 arc persuaded to abort. 
Women deserve better than the thinly veiled agenda of Planned Parenthood. And the Note Dame student body deserves better than a news­paper that willingly takes students' money and the University's aid and uses it to subvert the foundational mission of this great institution. The University should take an active role in assuring that the paper does not publish such immoral advice to 18 year old freshmen.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Punks prove they are indestructible 
By STEPHEN HOEPLINGER A.o.sistanr Scene Editor 
A lot has happened to Hancid since its 
·last album. They've endured major trau­ma and hospitalizations, the death of fam­ily members, close friends and a mentor and the breakup of marriages. The good news for them. and for punks all over the world, is that they have picked themselves up, dusted thems1~lves off and come back with a personally touching, totally balls­out hardcorn rneord that proves why they are Indestructible. 
The album opens up with the title track, a rocking little song in which lead singer and guitarist Tim Armstrong blasts con­sumerism and his ex-wife. gives a mini­lesson in Greek history and pays tribute to his late mentor Joe Strummer, all in under two minutes. The tone shifts radically with "Hed Hot Moon," an addictive ska piece featuring rapper Rob Aston that is remi­niscent of 1995's album ... And Out Corne the Wolves, and proves that Rancid are still the masters of the ska-punk genre. One of the most interesting tracks on the album is a song called "David Courtney." written about a punk rocker crime boss who acts as a Robin Hood figure to the poor people of London. Aside from the hooky chorus, it features a chilling spoken word monologue at the end of the song that leaves tingles up the spine. 
Indestructible also shows Rancid's politi­cal side. "Start Now" is a song about talk­ing your problems through instead of going to war, "Born Frustrated" blasts dead-eyed mall junkies, "Stand Your Ground" is dedicated to the homeless of Los Angeles and "Arrested in Shanghai" features Armstrong singing from the point of view of a political prisoner in China.

Also, the album's per­sonal songs do not dis­appoint. The first of these is "Fall Back Down." The chorus is easy to identify with for anyone who has ever relied on their friends to help them through a bad time: "If I fall back down, I You're gonna help me back up again." "Spirit of '87" is about growing up in the punk community and how it saved them from being "either dead or in jail." The album also has a few breakup songs dedi­cated to Armstrong's wife Brody, who left him halfway through the recording process.

love, friendship and desire, and Rice seems to come out of the experience with more questions than answers, more contradictions than certainty. On the tear inducing "Cannonball," Rice sings "stones taught me to fly I love taught me to lie I life taught me to die I so its not hard to fall I when you float like a cannonball." Luckily for the lis­tener, Rice's music floats for him. 
One of the most intense elements of the album is its overall composition and production, with songs, melodies and lyrics weaving in and out of each other to the point where there are hardly any boundaries between songs. One gets the feeling that conceptually, and more importantly musically, the album can barely be analyzed or dis­cussed in separate pieces. To say the album is a musical opus or perhaps a concept album may be too pretentious. However. there is a certain grace and harmony that bleeds through every part of this album, unlike in most dis­jointed pop albums. The strength of one song seems entirely dependent on the ability of the one that carne before. 


On an album mostly concerned with self-reflection, it is somewhat ironic that outside musicians provide some of the album's best moments. Vocalist Lisa Hannigan's solos on "Older Chests" and "I Hemember" do for 0 what Natalie Merchant did for Billy Bragg and Wilco's Mermaid Avenue, adding color and depth to an already exceptional album. The string and vio­lin work also stands on its own, turning simple melodies into movie sound­tracks. 
Damien Hice's 0 is an outstanding example of what an album should be. Its haunting melodies and lyrics pro­vide a worthy companion for late night drives, reflection and heartbreaks. When the album finishes playing. the listener will be left understanding Rice's lines in the song "Arnie." "You know when you found it I there's some­thing I've learned I 'cause you feel it when they take it away."

Cornhuskers ready to upend Nittany Lions 
Associated l'n:ss 
OMAHA, Neb. -Based on P1~nn State's two lackluster per­formances this season, Nebraska appears poised to exact a meas­ure of revenge for last year's blowout loss in Jlappy Valley. 
But Cornhuskers coach Frank Solich donsn 't think his squad is staring at a cakewalk in Memorial Stadium on Saturday. 
"We expect it will· be the same type of Penn State team that we always see," Solich said. "I know coach (Joe) Paterno will have them ready to play in Lincoln." 
The 18th-ranked Cornhuskers (2-0) look to avenge their worst loss of last season when they host the struggling Nittany Lions (1-1). 
Nebraska traveled to Penn State last year armed with a 3-0 record and a No. 8 national ranking. But the Lions used three interceptions to score 33 unanswered points en route to a 40-7 triumph. 
The loss marked the beginning of Nebraska's tailspin as the Cornhuskers dropped seven of their final 11 games for their worst season since 1961.

Barrett Ruud said. "It was a pretty embarrassing moment last year. I haven't brought it up a lot, but I think about it quite a bit." 
This season, Nebraska's offense has been racking up the yardage but is having trouble getting in the end zone. 
After scoring just one offensive touchdown in a 17-7 win over then-No. 24 Oklahoma State on Aug. 30, the Huskers scored three in last Saturday's 31-7 rout of Utah State despite generating 405 total yards.

Dailey, a highly touted fresh­man, finished with 47 yards on nine carries, and completed 4-of­5 passes for 47 yards. 
However, he doesn't foresee a quarterback controversy brew­ing with Lord. 
"Jammal's the starter no mat­ter what," Dailey said, "and peo­ple have to accept that. I'm still learning the game."

Paterno has 
also been 

questioned about his tailback-by-committee approach. With Heisman Trophy finalist Larry Johnson now in the NFL, Penn State is using a com­bination of three and even four running backs, including fresh­man Austin Scott, Tony llunt and Donnie Johnson. 
Paterno hopes that as the sea­son goes on, the youngsters' grasp of the offense will allow him to be more creative at the position. 
"Obviously, you are hoping they are getting better each week," Paterno said. "I would hope that when the staff sits down to talk about what kind of substitutions we are going to make, and in what situations, that we will be more comfortable that we can do more things with those kids." 
Penn State holds a 7-5 edge in the all-time series.

IOWA CITY, Iowa -As far as the people of Iowa are con­cerned, there's just one game: Iowa against Iowa State. 
The 23rd-ranked Hawkeyes (2-0) and the Cyclones (2-0) will renew their longtime rivalry when they meet Saturday at Jack Trice Stadium. 
"Every year it's what the fans talk about, in season, out of season, it doesn't matter," Iowa State wide receiver Jack Whitver said about Saturday's game. "Even on my summer break, that's all people want to talk about. 
"It's important to a lot of peo­ple. There's not much in profes­sional sports going on around here. That's why I say it's like our Super Bowl." 
Iowa, which leads the all-time series 33-17, owned Iowa state during the mid-1980s and early 1990s, winning 15 straight meetings starting in 1983. The Cyclones have since turned things around, winning five straight over the Hawkeyes, including handing Iowa its only regular season loss last year ­36-31 in Iowa City. 
Iowa comes in well-rested fol­lowing a 56-7 win over Buffalo last week. The Hawkeyes scored touchdowns on their first four drives and added Sean Considine's 11-yard intercep­tion return for a 35-0 second­quarter lead. 
Hawkeyes coach Kirk Ferentz then sat starting quarterback Nathan Chandler and running back Fred Russell. Freshman quarterback Drew Tate led an eight-play, 69-yard scoring drive before the half. Freshman running back A.J. Johnson had a second-half touchdown and receiver Maurice Brown fin­ished with four catches for 82 yards and a TD. 
"I think we have a lot of excit­ing young players on our foot­ball team right now, intriguing players," said Ferentz, who is 0-4 against Iowa State. "It's always good to have them get a chance to get in and play ... It's kind of fun." 
The Cyclones arc feeling bet­ter about themselves following last week's 48-20 win over Ohio. Iowa State was coming in off a lackluster 17-10 win over Division 1-M Northern Iowa on Aug. 30.

LONDON -Track and field's expects U.S. authorities to governing body wants remove White's medals. 
American sprinter Kelli White stripped of her two gold medals from the World Championships. Now it's up to U.S. anti-doping officials. 
The International Association of Athletics Federations ruled Tuesday that White committed a doping offense when she test­ed positive for a stimulant and should lose her world titles in the 100 and 200 meters. 
The IAAF rejected White's explanation that she took the stimulant for a sleep disorder and sent the case to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for a hear­ing and disciplinary action. 
Rich Wanninger, a spokesman for the U.S. Anti­Doping Agency, said his organi­zation had not received any information from the IAAF as of Tuesday afternoon. Once that information is received, Wanninger said, the agency

"She is disqualified only at the end of the procedure because further legal issues need to be exhausted," Gyulai told The Associated Press by phone from IAAF headquarters in Monaco. "This can only hap­pen after she has been given a hearing by her national federa­tion."

Pf'ITSBUHGII -Steelers line­backl~r Joey Porter. who was shot outside a Denver night club less than two weeks ago, could be on the field this Sunday in Kansas City. 
Steelers Coach Bill Cowher announced Tunsday that he has list1~d Porter I).S doubtful to play in the game, which in the NFL means Porter has a 25 percent chanw of playing. 
Cowher initially said Porter would return within two to eight wePks, and his best esti­mati~S are coming true. 
"I really just tried to get you guys to understand this was not as bad as some people were saying," Cowher said at a news conference. "As the information comes, it just keeps getting bet­ter and better and, knock on wood. hop1~fully it'll continue to lw that way." 
Cowher said the risk of infec­tion was thl' biggest concern of doctors after they removed a IJmrn bullnt l'rom Porter's upper right thigh on Labor Day. The risk has been minimized with the help of the Steelers' training staff. who have been changing the dressing on the wound twiw a day. 
"That was the biggest concern and he's doing better," Cowher said. "We just don't want to pKt him out there w1Ul1t he's not ready to play and be able to defend hims()!f, but at the same time we're welcoming him back as soon as he can get back." 
Porter's presence was felt by both teams during the Steelers' 34-14 season-opening victory against the Baltimore Havens. 
Porter and Havens linebacker Hay Lewis engaged in a pre­game argument, and then Porter was pointed out to the TV audience for running ahead of teammate Kendrell Bell along the Steelers' bench area during Bell's 42-yard intercep­tion return in the first quarter. After the game. Porter took his pre-game problem with Lewis to the media and criticized Lewis' performance during the game. 
"lie had one tackle today, maybe two," Porter said, "and he was jumping around like he had 30." 
Two Steelers, linemen Aaron Smith and cornerback Dewayne Washington, made gestures during the game indicating their sympathy for Porter. Wide receiver Plaxico Burress wore a sticker on his helmet bearing Porter's No. 55. 
"Before the game, in the lock­er room, we got together as a team, getting ready to pray, and you could see a guy bending over on the counter with tears in his eyes because he couldn't be out there," Burress said. "It kind of sent a message to all of us to just go out there and play hard every down. because you never know what's going to happen.

Alou's single puts Cubs ahead for good in victory 
Associated Press 

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico­Moises Alou hit a tiebreaking two-run single in the seventh inning, and the Chicago Cubs overcame a scary moment when Sammy Sosa was hit in the hel­met with a pitch in a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Expos on Tuesday night. 
Sosa was plunked by Zach Day in the fourth inning, draw­ing boos from the crowd of 15,632 at Hiram Bithorn Stadium. The All-Star right fielder took a knee and was immediately approached by manager Dusty Baker and the team's trainer. After a few min­utes, Sosa walked to first, and appeared to be fine. He later scored on a sacrifice fly by Aramis Ramirez. 
In April, Sosa was hit in the helmet by a pitch thrown by Pittsburgh's Salomon Torres. The ball's impact was so severe it ripped a large hole in front of his left ear flap. 
With the win, Chicago moved a half-game ahead of Houston in the NL Central. The Astros played Milwaukee later Tuesday. 
The Expos were playing the fourth of a six-game "homes­tand" in Puerto Rico-the team's third this season away from Montreal. 
Pitcher Carlos Zambrano led off the seventh with a single. One out later, Day (7 -7) hit 
Mark Grudzielanek, the last batter he faced. 
Reliever Hector Almonte then walked Sosa to load the bases, and Alou hit a hard grounder between second and third that squeezed just beyond the reach of shortstop Orlando Cabrera, scoring Zambrano and Grudzielanek to make it 4-2. 
Colorado 8, St. Louis 1 
Gregg Zaun homered and drove in four runs for the Colorado Rockies, who snapped an eight-game losing streak with an win over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
The loss left the Cardinals 2 1/2 games behind Chicago and Houston in the NL Central with 17 to play. 
The Rockies had lost 13 of their previous 14 games overall and 10 straight road games, tying a team record set 1997 and tied in 2000. Colorado is an NL-worst 21-52 on the road this season. 
Colorado starter Jason Jennings (12-12) ended a per­sonal road losing streak of six games, allowing one earned run on six hits over six innings. He struck out three and walked two. 
Three Colorado relievers com­bined for three scoreless innings. 
Philadelphia 18, Atlanta 5 
Tomas Perez and Jason Michaels both hit grand slams and Philadelphia reached a sea­son high in runs with a rout of the Atlanta Braves, keeping the Phillies even with Florida in the NL wild-card race. 
Perez and Michaels became the third duo in Phillies history to hit two slams in a game. Ralph Miller and Lee Meadows were the first on April 28, 1921, followed by Billy McMillon and Mike Lieberthal on Aug. 18, 1997. 
Lieberthal also hit a three-run shot in the first off Shane Reynolds. Perez nearly hit another homer, settling for an RBI double off the left-field wall. 
Philadelphia won for the sev­enth time in eight games to keep pace with the Marlins, who defeated the New York Mets 3-1. 
The Braves gave up two grand slams in a game for only the second time in modern fran­chise history. Miller and Meadows hit their 1921 slams against Boston. 
Houston 7, Milwaukee 6 
Lance Berkman doubled home the go-ahead run with two outs in the ninth inning and the Houston Astros rallied past the Milwaukee Brewers. 
The Astros tied it on pinch­hitter Jose Vizcaino's three-run homer in the eighth, then went on to their fifth· win in six games. Houston remained in a f!rst-place tie with Chicago in the NL Central. 
Milwaukee lost its fifth in a row. 

With two outs in Astros ninth, Dan Kolb (1-2) walked Jeff Bagwell. Jeff Kent followed with a single and Berkman doubled. 
Brad Lidge (6-3) pitched the eighth for the victory and Billy Wagner closed in the ninth for his team-record 40th save. 
Vizcaino hit his third homer of the season, connecting on the first pitch from reliever Luis Vizcaino. 
Clnclnnatl10, Pittsburgh 6 
Russell Branyan hit a three­run homer and Wily Mo Pena added a go-ahead two-run shot in Cincinnati's six-run sixth inning as the Reds rallied past the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
Pittsburgh led 6-2 when D'Angelo Jimenez and Sean Casey opened the sixth with sin­gles off starter Salomon Torres. 
Craig Wilson followed Matt Stairs's one-out single with his third homer in two nights to give Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead in the second. 
Reggie Sanders hit a run-scor­ing double and Wilson added an RBI single as the Pirates made it 4-0 in the fourth. 
Florida 3, New York 1 
Jack McKeon chomped on another victory cigar after his surprising Florida Marlins pulled out another clutch win. 
And the Marlins manager had several more cigars on his desk, waiting to be lit during the final month of the pennant race. 
Alex Gonzalez tripled in two runs with two outs in the ninth to lift Florida to a 3-1 victory over the New York Mets and keep the Marlins tied atop the NL wild card standings Tuesday night. 
The Marlins won for the 1Oth time in 12 games and moved to a season-high 15 games over .500 (80-65). They remained deadlocked for the wild card lead with the Philadelphia Phillies, who won 18-5 at Atlanta. 
"It's a lot of fun," said Derrek Lee, who scored the final Marlins run. "September is when you're making offseason plans already. But right now, we're in it." 
New York lost in its oppo­nent's last at-bat for the fourth time in six games. 
"A lot of times this year. one pitch has beat us," losing pitch­er David Weathers said. "The bullpen on the whole has not been real good at that." 
Tempers flared in the ninth inning for the second straight night. Lee slammed his bat down after he was struck by Weathers' pitch and strode toward the mound. He was steered to first base and the benches didn't empty. 
Ugueth Urbina (3-0) worked one inning for the victory. Braden Looper pitched a perfect ninth for his 28th save. 
"We feel like if it's a close game, we have a great chance of pulling it out," Lee said.

Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio Maurice Clarett was charged Tuesday with lying about items stolen from his car, and Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said the school is ready to cut ties with the star running back. 
Clarett was charged with misdemeanor falsification, city attorney spokesman Scott Varner said. If con­victed, Clarett would face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. But proba­tion is likely the harshest sentence a judge would impose, city prosecutor Stephen Mcintosh said. 
Tressel said he does not expect Clarett to return this season to the defending national champion Buckeyes. He would recom­mend that Clarett be released from his scholar­ship if the request was made by Clarett, the coach said. 

Clarett has already been suspended indefinitely from the team, and probably will not play for the Buckeyes this season. He is also being investigated by the NCAA. 
Tressel was asked if it was time for Clarett to move on. 
"I think that he needs to make, along with his fami­ly, whatever decision he thinks is best for him," Tressel said. 
If Clarett's career at Ohio State is over, the running back's last carry would rank among the most mem­orable in school history. He scored on a 5-yard run in the second overtime in a 31-24 victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, giving the Buckeyes their first nation­al championship in 34 years. 
Alan C. Milstein, the Clarett family attorney, said he wasn't surprised by Tressel's comments or the misdemeanor charge. 
"Nothing Ohio State does surprises me," he said. "I don't think the family rec­ognizes what Ohio State's actions and motivations are, either." 
Milstein declined to com­ment on whether Clarett would consider transfer­ring. 
If Clarett transferred to another Division I-A school, he would have to sit out a year in addition to any sus­pension or ineligibility handed down by the NCAA. He could transfer to a Division I-AA, II or III and be immediately eligible to play, but any possible penalties would also per­tain. 
Hawes said th/NCAA had not received Ohio State's formal response. 
IN BRIEF 
Devil Rays sign top pick
Young 
· The Tampa Bay Devil Rays signed No. 1 overall pick Delmon Young to a $5.8 million, five-year contract Tuesday. 
The outfielder will report to the Devil Rays' instructional league pro­gram Sept. 19. 
Young, the younger brother of Detroit's Dmitri Young, hit .541 with seven homers and 28 RBis in 22 games this season at Camarillo (Cal.) High School. He was the first selection in June's amateur draft. 
Asked if signing a major league contract was a dream come true, Young said, 
"Winning the World Series would be," Young said. 
Young, 18, hopes to reach the majors during the 2005 season. He also believes the Devil Rays, who have one of the major's youngest teams, can become championship contenders in the near future. 

"We should be able bring a World Series title back before 2010," Young said. 
Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar foresees Young as a corner outfielder. 
"He's got a chance to be an awful­ly good offensive player," LaMar said. "I think we've signed a tremendous competitor." 
To make room on the 40-man ros­ter for Young, Tampa Bay trans­ferred shortstop Rey Ordonez from the 15-to the 60-day disabled list. Ordonez is out with a knee injury. 
Young gets a $3.7 million signing bonus, of which $25,000 is payable in November, $225,000 in January, $1.5 million each in January 2005 and January 2006 and $450,000 is July 2006. 
Ueberroth drops out of 
recall race Former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth dropped out of the 
California gubernatorial recall race Tuesday. 
The move came as the latest poll showed him trailing badly among candidates in the Oct. 7 election. 
Ueberroth, chief of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, said his focus on creating jobs had caught on with people but conceded his candi­dacy didn't have enough time left. 
"In the four weeks where we are and where we have to get, we just can't get there," he said during a news conference at his campaign headquarters. 
Ueberroth's departure is the latest among GOP candidates. Former gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon and U.S. Rep. Darrell Iss a, who financed the recall effort, earlier said they were dropping out of the race. 
Simon and Ueberroth's names will still appear on the ballot, while lssa's will not because he never filed candidacy papers.

Loomis was joined by Big East Player of the Week Lauren Kelbley. who had 11 kills in the first two games. She did not play the third game. 
"We had the opportunity to play everybody today," Brown said. 
Senior Jessica Kinder set a school record with 28 digs on the match. She was joined by Meg Henican, who had 14 digs to go along with three kills. 
Senior se.tter Kristen Kinder led the attack with 35 assists and only one ball handling error. She also had eight digs in the three games. 
Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Brewster contributed eight kills as well. 
The Irish had trouble finish­ing the match after dominating the first two games. Game one began with a 13-5 Irish lead. This was too much for the Crusaders to overcome, as Loomis had eight kills in the game. 
Game two looked to be more of a challenge for the Irish, as Valparaiso was within one point at 11-10. However, Kelbley put together a string of serves, including two aces that put·the Irish up 15-10. After that, the Irish never looked back. 
In game three, Notre Dame got off to a slow start once again. However, unlike the 
previous game. the Irish couldn't break it open. as the Crusaders were winning most of the way. 
With the score 24-20 in favor of Valparaiso, Loomis put the ball away, and proceeded to serve three straight points to bring the Irish within one. She tied the game at 30 a l'ew min­utes later, and senior Kim Fletcher put the Irish ahead 31-30; Loomis then finished Valparaiso off. 
"In game three. we made a lot of unforced errors," Brown said. "That was a little disap­pointing. but hopefully it's a learning experience for us and we don't repeat that." 
The Irish will take the win. but they are not yet satisfied with their play. 
"We can definitely play at a higher level," Brown said. "What we were looking for is really steady play from start to finish."

the match, holding close to Calvin in a first game that was only decided by three points. After that, it seemed as though the team might have lost a bit of intensity, a fact reflected in the scores of the final two games. 
"We're the kind of team that needs to win that first game." Schroeder-Biek said. "When we started this match it was just like this weekend [at the Kilt Classic, where the Belles went 4-1]. 
"The first game we made some sloppy mistakes that caught up to us, and after that we didn't ever seem to get that original intensity back." 
Freshman Kristen Playko continued her impressive rookie season, leading the Belles with 11 kills and also contributing nine digs and three service aces. Senior cap­tain Alison Shevik led the team with 15 digs. 
Setter Lauren Temple had 32 assists to lead the team. and middle hitter Elise Hupright pitched in with a solid per­formance -eight kills. seven digs, two solo blocks and three service aces. 
The loss drops the Belles to 0-2 in conference play. but their coach maintains that this team has the ability to be something special. 
"We have great potential this year," Schroeder-Biek said. "We cannot lower our expecta­­tions. We need to play at the level we know we can play at, for the entire game."

''I'm not too much of a hitter. I'm going to leave that to Earl. It's kind of weird making those big hits and Earl getting the fumble," Duff said. "Usually it's the other way around. If it hap­pens that way, it's great for our team. If it gives us that burst, then I'm glad to have that role." 
The one disappointment for this secondary was its inability to directly contribute on the scoreboard. The whole defense. namely the defensive backfield, takes ·a lot of pride in making the big play to turn the game around and help out what has been an inconsistent offense. 
Saturday at Michigan, Duff and company are ready to get back to their old habits. 
"It's not just making those big plays and making those turnovers, but we need to score off those turnovers. That's what we really talk about as a defense," Duff said. "We help the offense a little bit more if we're scoring on defense. It helps the team out in the end. We always look forward to [not only] creating turnovers but also scoring off those turnovers."

FOOTBALL 
By MATT LOZAR Associate Sports Editor 

The thinnest position on the Notre Dame defense was tested against Washington State, going past the traditional two­deep depth chart. 
Starting right cornerback Jason Beckstrom, who missed 2002 with an arm injury, was hurt on the Cougars' first quar­ter touchdown drive. Dwight Ellick, who was listed as a potential co-starter on the right side, replaced Beckstrom and later left with an injury in the first quarter. Preston Jackson, listed as the backup to Vontez Duff at left cornerback, shifted over to the right side. 
Insert true freshman Freddie Parrish into the picture. 
Parrish moved into the nickel back role, vacated by Jackson, and saw significant playing time throughout the rest of the game. 
"Coach Walters told me [Friday night] to be ready regardless. We went to our hotel, went through the note­book and he told me to be ready since you never know when your number is going to be called," Parish said. "When the opportunity presented itself, I just tried to do the best I could. 
"I thought I might play a little bit, if we were blowing them out or something. I had no idea it was going to be in for crunch time." 
Parrish only had the past summer to really learn the defensive schemes and adjust from the high school to the col-

Irish win big in home opener 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 
The Irish gave the home crowd something to cheer about Tuesday night, as they handed the Valparaiso Crusaders their first loss of the sea­son. 
No. 15 Notre Dame (5-1) swept Valparaiso (8-1) right off the court, winning 30-21, 30-17 and 32­30. 
"It is great to be home," coach Debbie Brown said after the game. "We were on the road for a very long time." 
The Irish shined in the home opener, once again dominating at the nets. Notre Dame fin­ished with 62 kills to Valparaiso's 37. Emily Loomis led the way for the Irish with 24 kills on

Belles play well, but fall just short 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Saint Mary's came out of the Calvin game on the short end of the score, but that doesn't mean there's nothing the team can learn from its loss. 
The Belles fell to the Knights by a score of 27-30, 21-30, 19-30 Tuesday night, but coach Julie Schroeder­Biek was proud of how her team performed its game plan. 
"One of the reasons Calvin is 6-0 now is that they have a strong middle attack," she. said. ''I'm very happy with how we played up the mid­dle." 
Calvin's leading player, mid­dle hitter Kara Kuipers. came into the game hitting an aver­age of .600, but the Belles were able to hold her to well below that average. It was not enough as Kuipers' team­mates were able to back up their star. 
The Belles started strong in

lege game. Therefore, Parrish relied on the knowledge of his willing teammates to make sure he had the correct assignments. 
"They were all willing to help me, whenever we went to the sideline, Preston was always going over this and that," Parish said. "When we were on the field, Glenn [Earll would talk to me and Garron [Bible]. Same thing as Vontez [Duff] when I was on his side he let me know." 
Parrish wasn't the only unex­pected player to get into the game. When Duff went to the sidelines with an injury later in the game, Mike Richardson stepped onto the field for his first collegiate action. 
Being able to call on players like Parrish and Richardson in important situations says a lot about the Irish secondary. 
"Our depth came in and played a great game," Duff said. "They came in and stepped up. Just coming in and getting that experience on defense really helps our defense in the long run of the season." 
Besides the Irish having to go nine players deep into their secondary, some of the roles from 2002 were reversed against the Cougars. 
Earl earned the reputation of always making the big hit. Duff picked up fumbles or made interceptions and used his play­making ability to make some­thing happen. Saturday, Duff got the big hit that turned around the game in the fourth quarter and Earl was there to
