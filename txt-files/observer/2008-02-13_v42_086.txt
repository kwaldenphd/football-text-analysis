Despite the ongoing use of per­formance-enhancing drugs, Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Allan "Bud" Selig told attendees at Tuesday's annu­al baseball Opening Night Dinner he believes this is the "golden age" ofbaseball. 
"We're in the midst of an amaz­ing renaissance of baseball. The sport's never been this popular, the sport's never done this well," he told his audience in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse.

his claim. 
Last season, the 30 MLB teams drew a combined 79.5 million fans, and an average attendance of nearly 33,000 per game. Selig projects the MLB will break that record with 80 million fans. 
Selig also stressed the impor­tance of competitive balance, or parity, in the League. During the 2007 season, no team had a win­ning percentage above .600 or below .400-and that balance came only four years after Detroit lost 119 games (the second most all-time) and six years since Seattle tied an MLB-record with 116 wins in 2001.

Like weather, snow days unpredictable 
ND hasn't canceled classes since 2000; no formal policy exists to determine closures 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
In the past 90 years, Notre Dame has closed the campus due to severe winter weather conditions only eight times ­and the decision about whether to cancel classes can be as unpredictable as South Bend weather patterns. 
Vice President of Business Operations James Lyphout, who plays a central role in the decision to cancel classes due to inclement weather, said there is no criteria or policy used to decide when to call snow days. 
"There's no set amount of 
snow or specific temperature. Each situation is evaluated on its own circumstances. There are no specific parameters for which we would cancel class­es," he said. 
Lyphout also said the deci­sion to close campus due to weather is not dependent on what other schools and busi­nesses in the area are doing. 
"We really make independ­ent evaluations of road and weather conditions," he said. "We have our own people do assessments of parking lots, roads and the surrounding community in the early morn­ing hours."

Electoral ethics examined 
Professor calls campaigns 'jistfights,' discusses voter responsibility 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY News Writer 
Presidential campaigns are "a fistfight in business suits," American Studies professor Robert Schmuhl said during a lecture about ethical voting Tuesday. 
"Anything goes, figuratively speaking. Brass knuckles, switch blades, and sucker punches are commonly used political techniques," Schmuhl said of the competitive -and oftentimes vicious nature -of 
the  race to  win  the  White

NDSMCOBSERVER.COM Annual DSLC kicks off 
Saint Mary's explores diversity in conference 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
Diversity will be in focus again as Saint Mary's kicks off the third annual Diverse Student Leadership Conference (OSLO today. 
The conference is organized by the Student Diversity Board (SOB) and targets area college and high school students. The free three-day workshops will continue through Friday, highlighting the diversity in education at Saint Mary's and its social and professional impact. The DSLC includes workshops, a diversi­ty showcase, career exposition and keynote addresses. 
The mission of the DSLC is "to inform participants of the adversities and benefits within diverse academ­ic, social and professional settings," SOB vice president and conference organizer Adriana Lopez said. 
"As a senior getting ready to grad­uate, I believe that the main purpose of an education is to learn to become responsible citizens and better professionals in the work­force," Lopez said. "I think it is very important for students to attend the conference because it provides an opportunity for them to learn about a reality that they are going to encounter in life." 
The conference opens tonight at 7 when Gwendolyn Dungy delivers the first keynote address in the Student Center Lounge. Dungy has been the executive director of the National Association of Student Professional Administrators

Ethernet usage could boost vvireless speed 
By KATE McCLELLAND News Writer 
Though wireless is the Internet connection of choice for many stu­dents on campus, the Office of Information Technology (OIT) says using an Ethernet cable will help speed up the network. 
Every dorm room on campus is equipped with an Ethernet outlet and if students made more use of them, there wouldn't be as much traffic in the wireless network, said Dewitt Latimer, chief technol­ogy officer. 
"It's like the old-fashioned party line that telephones used to be connected to -the more people on the line, the worse the connec­tion becomes," Latimer said. 

However, he said OIT ultimately recommends using the connection that is appropriate to what you are trying to accomplish online. 
"If you're trying to download and play a two gigabyte movie, then you should be using the wired connection for the best results," Latimer said. "But ifyou're watch­ing TV with your friends and IM­ing or checking your e-mail at the same time, the wireless connection is what is best for you." 
For students on the run, the higher navigation speeds may be the dealbreaker.

I don't know about you, but I loved Frosh-0. 
Who wouldn't love that wonderful weekend where freshmen are foreed to endure 72 hours of solid awkwardness and where all manner of

goes to die? Sports l11re Editor 
I had to sit 
in the seoreh­
ing hot basement of Pangborn eating stale 
pancakes and making painful small talk 
with God-only-knows how many girls I'd 
never remember. I had to erack an egg on 
my head as part of some perverted ver­
sion of Duek-Duek Goose. On the plus side, 
I got to run into Domer Fest drenched in 
sweat and wearing the coolest-looking 
orange beanie ever. (Can you say duck 
magnet?) 
I've heard a rumor that whoever's in 
ehargn of this ineredibly important (albeit 
uncomfortable) staple of a freshman's 
year want<; to make some ehanges. Now, if 
these changes induded requiring every­
one to wear a name tag induding their 
name, hometown, and intended major, I'd 
be all for them. These proposed adjust­
ment.:;, however, are much more drastic 
(not to mention much less convenient). 
The first proposal I've heard is that RAs should be in charge of Frosh-0. According to these rumors, there would still be a Frosh-0 staff of sophomores and they would still organize interhall event'i-but these event.:; would be attended and run byRA<>. 
A'i a result, the number of sophomores on eaeh dorm's Frosh-0 stall"would likely be cut in half. I have no real evidence to prove this. It's just that I'm a freshman this year and I want the opportunity to do to next year's rookies thn same things that were donn to me. People tell me I have anger management issues. 
The second rumor I heard wa'i the one that really annoyed me. Apparently, the people in ehargn of Frosh-0 think it's a good idna to eut the amount of time allot­ted for event<> in half so freshmen can spend morn time with thnir parent'> while they're on campus. 
As my li11low Observer stall"er Katie Peralta said in a moment of sophomore wisdom, "Baby bird's gotta fly." Does any more really need to be said? Considering I still haw~ about a hundred words of space to fill. yes, more does need to be said. 
Don't worry, reader, it'll all be over soon. 
My major problem with thi'> proposal is that freshmen have had 18 years to spend time with their parents, not to mention an entire summer to prepare for their move to college. Frosh-0 is a time when fresh­men need to learn a little self-sufficiency, and the key to this i'> to maximize their time away from their parent<>. 
It's not about meeting fellow Domers from around campus (because honestly, who remembers more than a handful of people they met during Frosh-0?). It's about being able to walk into dasses a few days later, and not just sitting there, awk­wardly staring at your perfectly arranged set of pendls, but turning to the person next to you and introducing yourself. 
So if the powers-that-be really want to weleome freshmen to Notre Dame, they should do it in the most painful and awk­ward way possible.

Man charged In staged sympathy shooting 
DOTHAN, Ala. -A Hartford man has been charged with two misde­meanors for allegedly stag­ing his own shooting, which put him in the hospital, to get sympathy from family members. 
Charles Gregory Hatcher was indicted by a Geneva County grand jury on charges of obstruction of justice and giving false information to law enforce­ment officers, both Class A misdemeanors. He turned himself into the Geneva County Jail last week and 

was released on $1,500 bond. 
Police found Hatcher in a cotton field with a bullet wound on his back and another on the back of his leg on Dee. 3. He spent sev­eral days in the hospital. 
Hartford Police chose not to prosecute the case, but the grand jury indieted him anyway, Geneva County District Attorney Kirke Adams said. 
Meth deposited In ATM, woman jailed 
BREMERTON. Wash. ­Credit unions accept deposits -just not of methamphetamine. A woman who allegedly dropped an envelope con­taining money and a bag of meth at a Kitsap Credit Union was arrested and charged with drug posses­sion, according to court documents. 
A bank employee report­ed the deposit to police, who eontaeted the 18-year­old customer. Officers said she might have mistakenly included the bag when she got money out of her pock­et for the deposit.

By LINDSAY SENA News Writer 
As seniors finish their final semester, they are forced to look toward the real. some­times intimidating world after college. 
To help ease the transition, the Senior Class Council is hosting "What's Next Wednesdays," a series of seminars co-sponsored by the Alumni Association, the Annual Fund, Career Center and Center for Social Concerns.

To determine which topics are most pressing to seniors, the Senior Class Council "sent out a survey in the fall semester to gauge interest in various events to see what we could offer to seniors to make our last year the best possible," Keating said. 
"When we suggested sen­ior transition seminars, these topics generated great interest and students really wanted to hear about real world issues they'll be facing

won three consecutive World Series from 1998-2000, there were six different champions over the next six seasons. Boston's win l<L<>t season marked the liThi time a team won a second title in the 21st century, but Selig noted the other teams playing in the 2007 posl'il~w;on to try to show compet­itive balance in the sport. 
Excluding the Red Sox, the three other teams playing in the two league championship series were in the bottom third or the league in terms of revenue. ClevP.!and ranked 23rd at $61 mil­lion, Colorado was 25th at $54 million and Arizona was 26th at $52 million. 
Selig said competitive balance like thi'i has given more fans than ever "how~ and faith" that their team has a legitimate shot at making a post'ilmson run. 
"I've bmm studying the divi'iion races, and I rt~a.lly like what I see," Selig said. "I think every race is going to have multiph~ teams that are going to look at themselves and say, 'I ley, I've got a chance to win.'" 
Sdig also addm;snd tim ways in which M;~jor League B<L'ieball ha'i addrt~ssed thP ).,trowing problem of performance-enhancing sub­stanens over tlw liL'>t fi.lw years. 
Al'tnr an initial Congressional hearing in Mareh 2005, Selig asked former Sen. George Mitchell to conduct a thorough, mmprehensiw investigation into the use of perf(JmHulce-enh<mdng substances in the sport. The result, the 409-page Mitchell Hnport, gave biL'iPball what Snlig <"<LllPd "a road map fi1r tho futurn" in how the steroids era began and how steroids WPm distributed throughout Major League

Thn mmmissiorwr <Llso said hn thinks the report and the impln­mentation of many of Mitchell's rncomnwndations am a way to show fans that ba<ieball is doing everything in il<; pownr to dmm up t.lw sport.

gram is in its eighth year." 
One of the most important facets of Major League Baseball's steroids policy, Selig said, is the increasing independence and transparency of the testing. 
Currently, Major League Baseball uses Bryan Smith, a doc­tor employed by the MLB, as its primary doctor for steroids test, instead of turning to an outside, third party as Mitchell recom­mended in hi<> report. Selig said he is committed to Smith, but wants to increa'le his independence. 
"The things we're doing, we're trying to increase the independ­ence and I want to increase trans­parency.... I think we can have a third party and I think he can be independent, but [Smith] under­stands our sport and he under­stands our nuances," Selig said. "People compare our sport to the Olympics in temlS of penalties and it's just not fair because we play every year." 
Selig said baseball is using the best available science to combat steroids use, including the Olympic labs in UCLA and Montreal. 
The commissioner also responded to former Atlanta Braves piteher John Rocker's alle­gations that he knew Roeker was on steroids in 2000. Selig called Hocker's daims "inaccurate" and said there was no way he could have known Boeker was on steroids since there W<L'> no drug poliey in :woo and Hocker's tesl'> would have been protected by doctor-patient confidentiality. 
After a winter of steroids inves­tigations ;md Congressional hear­ings (fi1rmer New York Yankees pitcher Hoger Clemens i<> slated to testify today), Selig said the focus this week should be on the return of baseball itself. Pitehers and eatehers report this week in Arizona ;md Florida for the begin­ning of Spring Training. 
"My best days are the ones where I can concentrate on ba'le­ball," Selig said. 
The former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig was eleetnd acting commissioner in 1994 bnlbre being named to the position pennanently in 2000. 
Notre Dame baseball coach Dave Schrage and former Notre Dame shorl<>top Greg Lopez also spoke at tim event. 
Notre Dame baseball's home opener will be March 17 against Central Michigan. Schrage said Tuesday that he wanl<; to make this date a m1w tradition for the tmtm, <md the Irish will continue to open on St. Patrick's Day for at least tlw next tl1rec smL'ions.

According to ore student com­puter usage peaks between the hours of' 5 P.M. and 3 A.M. each day. During that time, thorn is an average of' 1,400 simultaneous Ethernet connections and 3,400 simultaneous wireless eonnec­tions. 
"I usually use the Internet in the early evening -I'll eheek my mail before and after dinner," Walsh said. 
While orr·s system registers every connection -Ethernet or wirnless -it dons not distin1-,'Uish between users who use both thn wired and the wireless connec­tions, so it is possible fbr a user to be counted twice, Latimer said. 
The average network through­put on the HesNet wired network is 300 megabytes per second while the Nomad win~less net­work rate is only 150, so the wired connection will be signifi­cantly fa<;ter if you are download­ing a largP file, he said.

Johnnetta Cole, president emeri­tus of both Spelman and Bennett CJ:Jllege for Women -the only two all-black historical colleges for women in the country -will deliv­er the dosing keynote address. She will deliver her lecture -titled "Are Diversity and Inclusion on Your Agenda?"-at 12:30 p.m. Friday in the little Theater. 
The speakers were chosen largely by the input or the students, Lopez said. 
"The DSLC committee wanted to know about students' concerns and bring topics to the conference that they felt needed to be addressed," she said. "So the speakers were cho­sen based on their expertise on a specific area, but most importantly, we wanted speakers that can fit the mission of the conference and con­tinue to contribute to social justice." 
Lopez expects a large turnout, thanks to advertising and pre-regis­tration options. 
"Our committee in general has done an amazing job of getting the word out, not only to Saint Mary's, but other campuses arow1d the area as well," she said. "1 think that because this is the third annual DSLC, a lot more people are fiuniliar with it and know that it is a very professional event." 
Lopez hopes this year will be as successfUl as the first two, and she wwts it to show the Saint Mary's community the daily importance of diversity. 
"We live in a world that i<> so inter­connected and part of our job is to figure our how to navigate it and be appreciative of what it is," she said. "As a Saint Mary's student I would hope that my school would be able to give me tim necessary tooL<> to do tlmt, and the DSLC will do iliat."

spotlight on the ethical -or unethical-behaviors or key players, Schmuhl said. 
"Today, a countless array of outlets in print, online and broadcast creates this 24/7 environment," he said. 
The constant stream of information can both help and hinder voters' decision mak­ing. Quiek access to informa­tion is a plus, but separating truth from opinion ean be dif­ficult for many people, he said. 
"To a certain degree and somewhat paradoxically, it is easier to know more about a candidate and a campaign, but it is more challenging to acquire the necessary knowl­edge to judge the candidate," Sehumhl said. "Every candi­date has a Web site where one can find more than you would ever want to know, but much of this, what we now label 'spin,' is information with a bias or slant." 
Schumhl said voters have an obligation to sift through biased information and make an informed voting decision "before conferring the power of the presidency on some­one." 
The system, 
which gives slightly erroneous claims a single Pinocchio and signifi­cantly erroneous ones three, can help voters learn more about the ethical behaviors of certain candidates. 
"In pursuing the truth, you as a voter learn lwhich candi­dates I are conducting them­selves ethically," Schumhl said. 
And while the excessive media coverage of political figures can be confusing, Schmuhl said it is still an advantage for the public. 
"There is so much coverage of one kind or another," he said, "that now there is a sense that whatever a politi­cal figure says becomes [fair game for scrutinyI." 
So it's up to the general public to scrutinize. 
"Voters have the political and moral duty to investigate candidates and their aims,'' he said. 
The Center for Ethics and Culture sponsored Schmuhl's lecture as part of Ethics Week.

Astronaut recovers for spacewalk 
CAPE CANAVERAL -The German astronaut who was too siek to perform a spacewalk refused to say what ailed him, but insisted he's feeling great -albdt a little anxious -for Wednesday's outing. 
llans Schlflgel will float oul<>ide the linked space shuttle Atlantis and international space station two days after sitting out the flight's first space­walk, which involved installing Europe's new Columbus sdenr.e lab. 
Schlegel said he backed NASA's decision to pull him off the first spacewalk because of his illness and delay Columbus' hookup by a day, even though it was a bitter pill. 
"Nobody could have been happier than me when we finished [Monday's spacewalk] with the major objectives all done," he said in a series of broadcast interviews Tuesday. "So that's all I want to say because medical issues are private." 
Schlegel, 56, pointed out that he helped coordi­nate Monday's spacewalk from inside.

Bill calls on Hoosiers to save water 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indiana House over­whelmingly approved a Senate bill Tuesday that calls on Indiana to join a regional compact intend­ed to prevent water-hungry states from tapping into the Great Lakes' waters. 
The bill, which was approved on a vote of 91-8 with no amendments, now goes to Gov. Mitch Daniels, who has 10 days to sign the legislation. 
Erin Crofton, a resource specialist with the Miehigan City-based Save the Dunes Council, said the bill's passage is a "great accomplishment for Indiana." 
"We are neck to neck right now with New York to get the Compact adopted. Indiana could be the first state to pass both the legislation and imple­menting language together," she said.

Lyphout and Saint Mary's security director David Gariepy said conditions that have merited canceling elassns in the past include very heavy snowfall with high winds that may cause drifting. 
Any elass canceled due to weather conditions would be rescheduled at the discretion of individual professors, Lyphout said. 
Of the eight weather-relat­ed closures, five resulted in Glass cancellations. 
The last campus closure occurred in December 2000 during final exams week. According to Vice President Department, said that while snow-clearing technologies have improved over the years, most of the machinery has remained the same.

The liquid helps prevent ice from building up on the campus walkways. 
Other equipment used includes Bobcat machines with buckets, pick-up trucks with plows and small dump trucks with plows.

U.N. peacekeepers. 
China buys two-thirds of Sudan's oil exports. In turn, China sells weapons to the Sudanese government and has defended Khartoum in the 
U.N. Security Council. 
"How can Beijing host th e Olympic Games at home and underwrite genocide?" said Farrow, a U.N. goodwill ambassador, shivering in freezing weather outside the Chinese Mission. "Time is running out for the people of Darfur." 
Another letter signed by 120 lawmakers also called on Hu to use his "significant influ­ence" to help with peacekeep­ing and humanitarian efforts. 

Olympic speedskating gold medalist Joey Cheek, who co­founded the Team Darfur ath­letes coalition, joined activists in Washington. Rallies also were scheduled for Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston and Chicago and for 10 other countries, including France, Germany and Egypt. 
Farrow and several humani­tarian groups had been criti­cal of Spielberg for continuing to work on the games, even as the Sudanese military said it bombed three towns in West Darfur last week. 
Spielberg, who sent a letter to H u in April urging China to take a stronger stance against Sudan, still hopes to attend the Olympics. But he said his conscience is pointing him toward spending his time and energy on the relief effort instead of the ceremonies. 
"The situation has never been more precarious," he said. "While China's represen­tatives have conveyed to me that they are working to end the terrible tragedy in Darfur, the grim realities of the suf­fering continue unabated." 
Several nations have put their athletes in a precarious position if they feel compelled to use the games as a plat­form for discussing Darfur. 
On Monday, the British Olympic Association acknowl­edged that its team agree­ment appeared to go beyond rules laid out by the International Olympic Committee barring any "demonstration or political, religious or racial propagan­da" at an Olympic venue or area.

In contrast, Indiana University-South Bend has cancelled classes three times this semester due to weather conditions, according to the South Bend Tribune.

If the University were to eancel class, Lyphout said, the decision would be a col­laboration between him, Provost Tom Burish and Executive Vice President .John Affleck-Graves.

It takes about 23 people from the University's Landscape Services crew to clear snowy paths each night, including four people on the night shift and three people on the early morning shift. 
Thistlethwaite said the walks and campus roads are first priority for clearing snow, followed by faculty, staff and commuting-student parking lots. Other student lots are the Landscape Services' last priority.

Director quits Olympic project 
Stars urge Chinese gov't to take responsibility in Sudan conflict 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Film director 
Steven Spielberg and actress 
Mia Farrow joined activists 
worldwide Tuesday in using 
the Olympics as a backdrop to 
address human rights con­
cerns, urging Beijing to exert 
political leverage on Sudan's 
government to help end the 
crisis in Darfur. 
Spielberg announced he would no longer act as an artistic adviser for the open­ing and closing ceremonies, saying he could not reconcile working on the Olympics while China and other nations were n.ot doing enough to ease the suffering. 
"Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing crimes but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more," Spielberg said in a statement. "China's economic, military and diplo­matic ties to the government of Sudan continue to provide it with the opportunity and obligation to press for change." 
Farrow joined former Olympic swimmers Shannon Shakespeare and Nikki Dryden in delivering an open letter addressed to Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Chinese Mission to the United Nations, condemning Beijing's support of the Sudanese gov­ernment. 
The letter was part of a "Global Day of Action" that focused on Darfur, where more than 200,000 have died and an estimated 2.5 million have been displaced since 2003. 
"We are all aware of the tremendous potential for China to help bring an end to the conflict in Darfur," said the letter, signed by Nobel Peace Prize laureates, celebri­ties and 13 former Olympians. 
Farrow suggested China use its influence to disarm the janjaweed, the government­backed Arab militia, demand the Khartoum regime halt bombings and ground attacks on civilians, and use its eco-

IN BRIEF RIM investigates Blackeberry outage 
SAN JOSE -The company that makes the ubiquitous, addictive BlackBerry smart phones said Tuesday it was still looking into what caused the second widespread service disrup­tion in less than a year. 
Hesearch in Motion Ltd. said customers in the United States and Canada "experienced intermittent delays" for about three hours Monday beginning about 3:30 p.m. EST. RIM said no messages were lost, and voice and text messaging services were unaffected. 
"It is too early to determine root cause at this time, but RIM does have a team address­ing this issue in order to define the problem and prevent it in the future," the company said in a statement. 
The BlackBerry service, which lets users check e-mail and access other data, has become a _lifeline for many business executives and is increasingly popular among consumers with smart phones like the BlackBerry Pearl. 
Outages have been rare in the BlackBerry's nine-year history, but when they do hit, sub­scribers who have become addicted to the gadgets are quick to unleash their fury. 
Venezuela ends deal with Exxon 
CARACAS -Venezuela's state oil compa­ny said Tuesday that it has stopped selling crude to Exxon Mobil Corp. in response to the U.S .. oil company's drive to use the

Venezuelan assets.  
Exxon Mobil is locked in  a  dispute  over  

tho nationalization of its oil ventures in Venezuela that has led President Hugo Chavez to threaten to cut off all Venezuelan oil supplies to tho United States. Venezuela is currently tho United States' fourth largest oil supplier. 
Tuesday's announcement by state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, was limited to Exxon Mobil, which PDVSA ar.rused of "judicial-economic. harassment" for its efforts in U.S. and European courts. 
PDVSA said it "has paralyzed sales of crude to lixxon Mobil" and suspended com­nwrcial relations with the Irving, Texas­based company.

General Motors hits another bump 
Company ends year with record $38.7 billion loss, announces further buyouts

DETROIT -General Motors' new Chevrolet Malibu sedan is so popular dealers can barely keep it in stock. 
Even with boosted pro­duction, it will likely be April or May before demand is met. 
"I hope we're never there," Mark LaNeve, GM's sales and marketing chief, joked last week at the Chicago Auto Show. "Those are good prob­lems." 
But for every good prob­lem at the world's largest automakcr, there are a host of bad ones. GM is being pummeled by the economy, fierce competi­tion, government regula­tions and gas prices. Even as it enjoyed near-record sales in 2007, outpacing rival Toyota Motor Corp., it ended the year with a record $38.7 billion loss and announced further buyouts Tuesday to cut costs.

Last Thursday, Congress passed an "economic stimulus package" worth $167 billion. Under the plan, Americans earning between $3,000 and $75,000 would get $300 to $600 plus $300 per child.

Listening to the triumphant and self­congratulating tone of the major play­ers in both parties, one would think that Congress might have found a cure for cancer, or at least have done something useful for a change. "There were no winners or losers in this except the American people, who saw us rise above any differences we might have had and work to agree­ment on what is the No. 1 issue, and that is our slowing economy," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnelL Senate majority leader Harry Reid hailed the plan as an "example of how government is sup­posed to work."

federal budget was approximately $2.8 trillion. However, the U.S. gov­ernment only collected $2.4 trillion. Total expenditures exceeded revenues by an incredible $400 billion. The U.S. government simply doesn't have the money to afford such a rebate, but Congress really just doesn't care. What's another $167 billion, anyways? 
Government doesn't produce any wealth of' its own. Nearly everything it gets, it takes from the private sector. It can only get wealth in three ways. First, it can forcefully take it from individuals in the form of a tax whether they like it or not. Second, it can inflate the eu'rrcncy, essentially printing money out of thin air, which leads to poor investment decisions, inflation and eventually a bust as the American public is now witnessing. Finally, it can borrow by selling bonds to investors. 
Usually when there is a deficit, the Treasury sells government bonds to investors. The Treasury uses this money to meet the shortfall between what it wants to spend (always too mueh) and what it collected in the form of taxes {also too much, but not enough to covnr expenditures). The 
U.S. government promises to pay interest on these bonds to the bond­holders over the life of the bond, final­ly paying back the face value of the bond at the maturity date. Last year, the U.S. government paid $243 billion just on the interest on its debt. 
Supporters of the stimulus bill hail it as a plan to partially remove the heavy burden of taxation off the back of the American taxpayer. The fact is that the bill merely shifts the burden rather than remove it. When a govern­ment reduces taxes without reducing spending, it leads to even larger deficits, more gov11rnment borrowing, increased future expenditure in the form of interest. on the debt and there­forfl saddling future generations with higher future taxes. 
Supporters also elaim it will stimu­late the eeonomy beeausn morn money in the pockets of taxpayers will lead to higher spending and thus, more jobs. This eomplntnly ignores what the bondholders would have done with their dollars had they not bought tho government bonds. The investors would have eitlwr invested in the Ameriean nconomy, saved the money in a bank which the bank could then loan out to others, or spent it, all of whieh anl good things. 
The most amusing part of this whole episodll is that both partins agree on the need for lower taxes in order to improve the Anwriean 1~conomy. Tlw largely bipartisan stimulus package is indend an admission taxns do act as a drag on the American economy, how­ever fiscally irresponsible it is. For onee, it seems that Congmss is cor­rect. But what is puzzling is that if taxes are bad for tho economy, then why should Congress wait until a r·ec11ssion hits to cut taxes? If lotting Americans keep what is rightfully theirs is a good thing, then why does­n't Congress make this a permanent policy? It's too bad that Congress lacks the eourage to cut both taxes and spending.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Monologues' promote discussion 
Monday marked the 150th anniver­sary of the appearance of Our Lady to St. Bernadette at Lourdes. In honor of the occasion University President Emeritus Father Hesburgh delivered the homily for the Basilica's evening mass service. This beautiful sermon, which celebrated the miracles associ­ated with Notre Dame -particularly Father Sorin's naming a (then) mere log cabin the University of Our Lady, the university's rebuilding after a dev­astating fire, and the creation of the Golden Dome -served as the recon­ciling capstone to the controversies that have afflicted the University recently. 
I was deeply disturbed to hear that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops had retreated from its origi­nal intention to hold its seminar on the Notre Dame campus because the timing of the event might look like support for Eve Ensler's "Monologues." I understand the Conference of Catholic Bishops' semi­nar is a private event and that those who objected to holding it at Notre Dame were not doing so to reflect adversely on the university, but a con­ference in February does not indicate endorsement of a production in March. Our Lady is loved and protect­ed by the Father and nothing that human beings do can stain her, as some have claimed on-campus per­formances of the Monologues would do. What can be stained are human institutions like universities -but not by a sincere search for the truth, wherever that search leads us. Notre Dame is a Catholic university. Love and pursuit of truth, as a Catholic institution and as a university, is its absolute mission and staging the "Monologues," in an appropriate aca­demic forum, is consistent with that mission. 
The "Monologues" is not in line with Catholic doctrine. They were not meant to be. They were written from a secular perspective to explore women's identities and to acknowl­edge women's value as whole persons. Personally, I think the way the various skits articulate women's value is most­ly (though not entirely) wrong and would be greatly enhanced by includ­ing Catholic perspectives (as Notre Dame's Loyal Sons and Daughters does). But this does not destroy the fact that the production attempts, 
Firearms solve problems 

In response to Andrea Laidman's article ("The unwell, unregulated militia," Feb. 11) Ms. Laidman writes that officials in Washington, D.C. worry about lifting the city's handgun ban and "respond that lifting the ban will only make violence worse." However, she does not stop to ask an even more obvious question: Is it possible that Washington's harsh and restrictive gun laws caused the high level of violence in the first place? 
The facts seem to indicate yes. England has much more restrictive laws than America and a higher rate of violent crime than the United States (in 1996, a 25 percent higher rate of robbery in England, as seen in the study "Crime and Justice in the United States and in England and Wales, 1981-1996" by U.S. Department of Justice.) One very plausible explanation for this is that criminals in places with accessible firearm laws are deterred from some crimes by the prospect of being injured by law-abiding citizens who keep and bear arms, while in places with harsh and unconstitutional firearm laws, criminals lack this fear. 
Laidman points to acts of violence involving firearms: killing police officers, children, and parents. This is not the sign of a firearm-initiated problem, this is a sign of grave and serious family and community problems. 
Finally, Laidman claims that precedent is on the side of those who wish to ban handguns. But this is incorrect, for hunting, target shoot­ing, and self-defense have been an American tradition (and precedent) since 1776. And the part of the Second Amendment that says "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" could not be more clear. Furthermore, even George Washington said that a"free people ... ought to be armed."

however wrongly, to acknowledge women's experience. What remains is for Catholics to take this attempt in the right direction, not to discourage an open discussion of what the char­acters in each skit are trying to con­vey about women's experience of suf­fering, joy, pleasure -and the devas­tation that abused sexuality causes. Father Jenkins made the right deci­sion in balancing the demands of aca­demic freedom with those of Notre Dame's Catholic identity. His decision has been misrepresented by the national media and he has not received much support from those on either side of the controversy. 
Father Hesburgh's sermon crystal­lized for me why I had felt this to be a particularly pernicious injustice. Father Hesburgh spoke about the rev­erence that Father Sorin had for Our Lady -that it was his particular love for her that channeled his faith in God into the creation of this university. The miracles that Father Hesburgh mentioned are visible signs of Our Lady's intercession, but they are not the only miracles. The repentance of hardened sinners, the healing of bod­ies broken by illness or sin, and the redemption of humanity by Our Lord's suffering-these are miracles. And if faith is the belief in things not seen, then faith can find Christ in the expe­riences described in the "Monologues." The faculty discussion panels that Father Jenkins' policy requires to be part of any on-campus production of the "Monologues" are the academic response to Christ's directive, "Seek and ye shall find." Catholic faculty and students have a duty to participate in these panels and discussions actively and whole-heart­edly. We are at Notre Dame to find the 
Truth: let's seek it with courage and charity, trusting that God will not mis­lead us. Father Jenkins is continuing the faithful leadership of Father Sorin, Father Hesburgh (the first Notre Dame President to admit women to the uni­versity of Our Lady), and Catholic leaders who, trusting in God's good­ness, take on the burden of turning a mustard seed into a flourishing uni­versity. Good for Notre Dame.

'Monologues' help reclaim sexuality 
Christina Holmstrom ("Monologues encour­
age mistreatment of women," Feb. 11) raises 
an interesting point; she claims that dis­
cussing the Vagina Monologues as an issue 
of Academic Freedom is to "woefully miss 
the mark." In this, I believe Holmstrom to be 
correct. I would, however come to a vastly 
different conclusion regarding the fate of the 
"Monologues." "The Vagina Monologues" 
seeks to reclaim the sense of what it means 
to be a woman, to stop women from being 
ashamed of their sexuality and to raise 
awareness regarding violence perpetrated 
against women. 
These goals are perfectly in keeping with 
the Catholic Church's teaching on sex and 
sexuality. The Church does not speak of sex 
as evil or morally wrong provided it is exer­
cised in the right way. Rather, the Church 
teaches that "sexuality is a source of joy and 
pleasure" (Catechism, 2362). Do the mono­
logues present an inappropriate use of sexu­. ality? The answer may well be yes. 
The play may present acts that are not 
well ordered to good relationships with God 
and others. The general ethos of the 
Monologues is, however, edifying to those 
who attend the play, provided they under­
stand something about the feminist move­
ment and approach the play with a critical 
eye. 
Further, and this point is clear, "Monologues" 
raises important questions. How do we reclaim our sexuality? What is the correct way to express that sexuality? When sexual violence has been perpetrated against a woman (or a man) how do we heal? Our esteemed President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh once said: "The University is where the Church does its thinking." Our theology department is grounded in this philosophy; I would argue that it is not simply academic theologians who are to do the thinking of the Church. Rather we are all called to engage in this discussion. 
The presence of "The Vagina Monologues" on campus is not a question of academic freedom. It is, however, necessarily tied to our Catholic character. As the premier Catholic university in this country, it is our duty to perform these monologues. Where else, if not at Notre Dame can we have this discussion? Where else can the Church do this thinking? I urge Dean Roche, Fath-er Jenkins and you, the students, to join me in this dialogue: Approach the monologues with a critical eye and engage in the thinking of the Church.

Fans look forward to writers'strikeresol 



fAVORITE SHOWS TO RETURN SOON 
I was OK until they took away "30 Hock." Then I finally realized how my older brother must have felt during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. How was I going to survive a writers' strike 
Cassie Belek 
that had no end in sight? 
Scene & Heard
In the beginning, it wasn't that bad. With the exception of "The Oflice," most of my favorite shows still had a handful of episodes left to air. But with each passing week, I felt new episodes slipping away from me. Some of my favorite series even ran out of episodes before Christmas break. 
In desperation for new TV of any variety, I began counting down the days until "American Idol" and "Hock of Love 2." I became even more dependent on my favorite soap opera, "General Hospital." In the past, I would let a few episodes at a time accumulate on my DVR, but now I found myself more excit­ed than ever to check in on the residents of Port Charles every day. 
I turned to TV on DVD as well. Season 1 of "Felicity" and Season 2 of "The Wire" comforted me, as did my brother's "Family Guy" DVDs. I even started re-watching "Arrested Development" for the 20th time. 
I think most people can agree that it got easier when late night returned. How glorious was Conan O'Brien's flaming red strike beard? I think I could watch that man spin his wedding ring on his desk forever. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert were back on the air also, and I think that Colbert proved once and for all that he is the funnier of the two Comedy Central stars. 
I must say, though, that the can­cellation of the Golden Globes nearly killed my soul. I'm always so sad when Christmas is over, but then I realize that it is award sea­son and I will soon be treated to red carpet fashion and the occa­sional inspired acceptance speech. I was given Billy Bush and Nancy O'Dell instead. 
But how exciting was the presi­dential race during this whole strike? Why go out with friends over Christmas break when the Iowa caucuses are on? Oh, you want me to go to a movie? Well, there's a Democratic debate that I don't want to miss. Going to Corby's for Mardi Gras? No, it's Super Duper Tuesday, fools! I will always remember this election year for saving my sanity when "llow I Met Your Mother" and "Gossip Girl" ran dry. 
Despite my many complaints about TV abandoning me, I have stood behind the writers. Did the WGA make some mistakes during the strike? Yes. Why spend so much time lashing out at Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno when you've got bigger fish to fry? However, the writers still deserved to get compensated for all their work. 
Unfortunately, it took a $2 billion hit to the L.A. economy for produc­ers to officially recognize the potential of new media. The Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation estimates that $1.3 billion of that loss was from busi­nesses outside of the studios ­caterers, florists, costume shops, restaurants and hotels that were secondary losers. It's time for the industry and its city to get back on their feet. 
And when production does start back up and my television viewing habits are back to normal, I can return to obsessing over "30 Rock" and crossing my fingers that "Friday Night Lights" doesn't get canceled. And, I can figure out whether I'm only watching "Eli Stone" because of the strike or because I actually enjoy it.

The cause for celebration is not only that "The Olliee" is coming back, but also that the writers suc­cessfully brought about the change they were looking li1r. 
They will be compensated for their work being viewed on what is called "new media" (basieally the Internet). But even though llollywood is going back to work this week, it is the first time in months that TV shows will be in production, and this means that we may not get new shows for weeks. My biggest fear is that some shows will be discontinued for the season. 
These past few months throw into sharp reliefjust how much telflvi­sion is integrated into my life. Even though it may not be my sole reason for living-though that is still up for debate-not having a new "House" on Tuesday nights was painful. It was like having a friend go abroad. I knew the show would come back, but it was irksome to think that we wouldn't have any rapport for a while. 
My section would gather to watch "Gossip Girl" on Wednesday nights, but once it ran out of new episodes, our weekly gatherings stopped. Television in the dorm is a social Th thing for me, and thfl lack of new umn episodes meant that I saw less or the people I live with.

WASHINGTON -Roger Clemens and his accuser, Brian McNamee, will be the main witnesses at a House hearing on the Mitchell Report after New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte and two others were dropped Monday night. 
Former Clemens team­mate Chuck Knoblauch and convicted steroids distributor Kirk Radomski also were taken off the witness list for Wednesday's public session. One new witness was added Monday night: a lawyer who worked with former Senate 

majority leader George Mitchell to produce December's report on drugs in baseball. 
But all attention will be focused on Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner, and McNamee, his former personal trainer, who alleged he injected the pitcher with perform­ance-enhancing drugs. 
"I guess it's showtime, isn't it?" Clemens' lead lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said in a telephone inter­view. 
Earl Ward, McNamee's lead lawyer, declined to comment on the changes. 
McNamee said in the Mitchell Report that he 
IN BRIEF 

Source says Vikin~s· Udeze diagnosed with leuliemia 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -Minnesota Vikings defensive end Kenechi Udeze has a form ofleukemia, which is cancer of the blood and bone marrow, a per­son with the team confirmed Tuesday. 
The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information. The Vikings declined to comment, but they issued a statement from coach Brad Childress that didn't specifically address Udeze's condition. 
"We respect the privacy of Kenechi. The thoughts and prayers of the entire Minnesota Vikings organization are with Kenechi and his family," the state­ment read. 
Two Twin Cities television stations tlrst reported the news on Monday night. KSTP-TV, without citing a source, reported that the 24-year-old Udeze was undergoing tests to deter­mine the severity of the clisease. Ethan Lock, Udeze's agent, declined to com­ment. 
injected Clemens -who ranks eighth in major league history with 354 wins -with steroids and human growth hormone at least 16 times in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens' denials of those allega­tions drew the attention of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
McNamee also accused Pettitte of using HGH -Pettitte acknowledged he did so for two days in 2002 to deal with an elbow injury. Before Pettitte spoke to commit­tee lawyers under oath last week, Ward said he thought Pettitte would tell Congress he dis-
page 13 
cussed HGH with Clemens between the 2001 and 2002 seasons. 
With Monday's deci­sion, Pettitte was spared the potentially difficult situation of having to deliver public testimony that could hurt the posi­tion of Clemens, a friend, past teammate and for­mer workout partner. Portions of Pettitte 's sworn deposition, though, may be read aloud at the hearing. And the committee's ranking Republican, Tom Davis of Virginia, said in an inter­view with Newsday that Pettitte's account match­es McNamee's in most details. 

NASCAR puts Busch,
Stewart on probation for six 
races 

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -It began with crunched fenders, harsh words and maybe even a punch in the face. But the final result was just a slap on the wrist from NASCAR: a six-race probation for Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch. 
Heading into Sunday's Daytona 500, it's beginning to look like NASCAR officials were serious when they said they will cut driv­ers some slack on their bad behav­ior this year. 
"We're still working into letting the drivers develop and vent in proper ways, but we're giving them some more latitude," NASCAR vice president of competi­tion Robin Pemberton said Tuesday. "We said in the offseason we would do that and I think this is another step to letting you know what we mean.'' 
Twins s~n Hernandez to 
replace S'antana 
MINNEAPOLIS -The Minnesota Twins added some seasoning to their suddenly raw rotation. 
Right-bander Livan Hernandez agreed Tuesday to a $5 million, one-year contract with the team that could earn him an additional $2 million in performance bonuses, raising the average age for a group ransacked by the departures of Johan Santana and Carlos Silva. 
Santana was traded to the New York Mets, and Silva signee! with the Seattle Mariners. Another starter from last season, Matt Garza, was dealt to the Tampa Bay Rays. 
"If we could find the right guy, we were going to add that," gener­al manager Bill Smith said. "We certainly weren't afraid to go in without veteran starters, but it's going to be give those young play­ers someone to look to."

And in the third quarter, the 
Ileal got caught. 
Iverson missed 11 of his first 13 shots before driving for an acrobatic layup while getting fouled with 3:21 lcf't in the third, pulling Denver within 76-72. It was part of a 15-2 period-end­ing run by the Nuggets, who took their first lead since the opening minutes wlwn Iverson made a six-footer with I :51 left. and wound up extending·the eushion to X4-7X entering the fourth. 

Pistons 94, Hawks 90 
Chauncey Billups missed every shot he tried through the first three quarters. 
Not to worry. The fourth is his time. 
Living up to the nickname "Mr. Big Shot," Billups scored 12 of his 16 points in the final period to rally the Detroit Pistons to their ninth win in a row, 94-90 over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. 
"You know me, man, you know me," Billups said. "Late in games, if I have an opportunity I'm going to take advantage of that, whether I'm hot or not. I always feel like that fourth quar­ter is a difl'erent game." 
Hasheed Wallace carried the load in the early going, scoring 15 straight points for the Pistons in the first quarter on his way to a 21-point night. The Hawks lost their third in a row despite 30 points from Josh Smith. 
Billups went into the final quarter at 0-for-8 from the field, but that didn't keep him from putting up some more. He ripped oll' 10 straight points for Detroit, inducting a eouple of 3s, to turn a three-point deficit into an 89-86 lead with 2:25 remain­ing. 



"It was like a lid was on the basket most of the game," Billups said. "Some of those shots [in the fourth] were the same shots I shot early in the game. I just couldn't stick them." 
Appropriately, he finished off with the biggest shot of the game, a jumper over Anthony Johnson with 22 seconds remaining for a 92-89 lead. 
"That's what type of player he is," Smith moaned. "His nick­name is 'Mr. Big Shot.' In the dutch, everybody knows he's going to take the shot." 
After Billups' final basket, Smith was fouled but made only one free throw. Richard Hamilton did what Smith could­n't, hitting both foul shots with 14 seconds left to seal the win. 
The Hawks were held to 3-of­19 shooting in the fourth by the gritty Pistons, who let an early 15-point lead slip away but rebounded at the end. 
"We had good looks," Atlanta coach Mike Woodson said. "We just couldn't get the ball to go down." 
Wallace got off to a brilliant start, hitting his first six shots ­including three 3-pointers. Detroit twice led by 15 in the second quarter before the Hawks responded. 
Atlanta dosed to 55-48 by halftime, and kept up the momentum in the third as the visitors turned cold. 
"If we had played the whole game like we did in the second half, things would have been dif­ferent," said rookie AI Horford, who had 16 rebounds to lead the Hawks to a 47-34 lead on the boards. 
The Pistons went nearly 6 minutes without a field goal, allowing the Hawks to surge ahead on llorford's three-point play midway through the third. The rookie pumped his fist after being fouled, then stepped to the line and swished the free throw. 
The Hawks led 76-74 after a frenetic final minute to the peri­od. Arron Afllalo came up with a steal and was going in for a layup, but Smith soared out of nowhere for the block. 
Atlanta took off the other way and Marvin Williams went in for a dunk, but the ball rimmed out. The Pistons tried to start a fast break of their own, but the Hawks stole it away near mid­court and Williams got another shot at the dunk. This time he didn't miss, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

Islanders fire season-best 47 shots in victory 
Trent Hunter picks up agoal, two assists in 4-3 win over Flyers; Hurricanes move into first place in Southeast Division

UNIONDALE. N.Y. -It was

Thn lslandnrs did it with a sea­

"It was a nicn to got that win and it givos us sonwthing to build on." said lluntnr, who had­n't scon~d sirH~n .Jan. II. "We can't rnlax. Wn havn to fonts, and we've got a big job ahead of' 
us.,, 
Nnw York hadn't won at homo 

since beating NPw Jnrsny on 
I>nc. 29 (0-:i-2). Tho lslandnrs 
also didn't havn a victory any­

Huslan Fedotenko scon~d with S:SS to rnstorn tlw Islanders' two-goal lnad, lwf'oro Jofl'rey Lupul rut it to 4-3 with 59.6 sec­onds remaining. New York killed Fndotenko's roughing penalty in tho final minute to presnrvn the victory. 
"We have bonn struggling a lit­tle bit at homo and that was a big win for us, nspneially against a division team," Fedotenko said. "It's really important, espe­cially at this time of the year." 
Hick l>iPiotro made 26 saves to win for the first time since Jan. 16 and send the injury-riddled Flyers to their fourth straight regulation loss. 
Danny Briere and Seott llartnell also scored for Philadelphia, missing forwards Simon Gagne and Scottie Upshall, and defenseman Braydon Coburn. Antero Niittymaki stopped 43 shots. 
"Before Christmas, it seemed like we were carrying most of the games," said forward Mike Hichards. who failed on a sec­ond-period breakaway. "Now, we're falling behind and then showing urgency at the end. We need to play a full 60 minutes." 
The late-arriving crowd, delayed by a snowstorm, was entertained by the second-period offense and a fashion show fea­turing wives of Islanders players on "Hockey and Heels" night. 
Hunter broke the scoreless deadlock with 2:18 left in the first, netting his eighth overall and first in 14 games. 
"We've been saying for the past week or so to get bodies to the net. .Just get pucks there and eause trallic," Hunter said. "You never know where pucks are going to bounce." 
Nnw York racked up 17 shots in the period and raced only 11' despite giving Philadelphia two power plays without owning any. 
One was doubly costly to the Islanders, who lost top defense­man Brendan Witt after a knee­to-knee collision with Hartnell in the neutral zone just past the 9­minute mark. Witt was whistled 
for tripping and then sidelined 
by a bruised knee. 
Philadelphia needed only 50 seconds of its fourth power play to get even. Briere put a rebound past a sprawled DiPietro for his 21st goal 1:05 into thn sneond. 
The rnst of the period 
bPiongnd to New York. 
DiPietro kept it tied when Hiehards raced in on a short­handnd breakaway, forcing him to miss wide left about 3 minutes into thn period. 
"I thought I had him beat if' I could have kept control of the puck," Hiehards said. "It goes in, and wn'rn in the lead. Instead, tlwy took the lead right after that. You have to expect to score, not hopn to scorn." 
Tarnbnllini made it 2-1 at 5:27 when hn intereeptfJd a pass from Flyers captain .Jason Smith and wristml a shot under Niittymaki's right arm. It was the first NIIL goal this season in 12 games for Tambellini, who leads the AliL with 2S goals. 
"You don't want to gt1 too long without putting the puck in," he said. 
Nnw York nearly stretched its lnad just past the midway mark of tlw period, but Smith went from def'enseman to goalie after Niittymaki was out of' position and blocked Tambellini's shot while on his side in front of' the net. 
lie couldn't do anything about Bergenheim's breakaway goal after another turnover. Hunter sent a pass from New York's end to Bergenheim. who raced in front of defenseman Kimmo Timonen and bore down on Niittymaki. 
Timonen hooked down Bergenheim, but the Islanders forward slung in a shot to make it :~-1 with 6:19 left. 
"We were better the last two games, but we still need to win," Briere said. "We had a long meeting to talk about it. We're close, but close is not good enough." 

Hurricanes 3, Bruins 2 
Andrew Ladd's two-goal spurt set the tone for the game. 

Shawn Thornton's two-goal 
spurt came too late to make a 
difference. 
"Fortunately, we were able to prevail -even though it got a little interesting," Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward said Tuesday night after Carolina took a shutout into the iinal six minutes and held on to beat the Boston Bruins. 
"That (first) goal gave them life," Ward added. "They were able to come on and put some pressure on." 
Ladd scored twice in the first 6:33, and former Bruins first­round draft choice Sergei Samsonov gave the Hurricanes a 3-0 lead with 1:31 left in the sec­ond period. Ward protected the shutout until Thornton had two goals in a 27 -second span with around five minutes left. 
"We got our first goal a little late, but you saw the momentum that it built and the energy that it gave our team," Bruins coach Claude Julien said. "If only we could have gotten that earlier in the game." 
Rod Brind'Amour assisted on both of Ladd's goals to help the Hurricanes improve to 2-3 on their five-game road trip. With the win, Carolina moved into first place in the Southeast Division, ahead of Washington and Atlanta, who play Wednesday night. 
"We're battling for a playoff spot," Samsonov said. "For us, it's almost a playoff game." 
Boston trailed 3-0 when Thornton's shot from the right side went off the top of Ward's glove and into the net with 5:10 left in the game. The Bruins made it 3-2 with 4:43 left when Ward made a save that trickled between his pads and stopped in the crease behind him; Thornton came by to swat the idle puck into the net. 
Boston made a furious charge in the last four minutes, pulling goalie Alex Auld but failing to get the game-tying goal. 
Ward stopped 32 shots, and Auld made 20 saves for Boston. 
Thornton's goals were his first of the season, giving him his first two-goal game of his career.

They also deprived Ward of his second consecutive shutout against the Bruins; he also shut out Boston on Jan. 8 and hasn't allowed a goal to the Bruins since the third period of Carolina's 4-3 victory on Dec. 28. 
The Bruins lost their second consecutive game, their fourth in five tries and their third in a row to Carolina. They now embark on a five-game trip of their own to clear the new Boston Garden for Disney's High Sehool Musieal: The Ice Tour. 
Ladd gave the Hurricanes a 1­0 lead when Brind'Amour split two defenders and pushed the puck up to Ladd just 3:01 in. Ladd made it 2-0 when he kicked the puck past Auld at the 
6:33 mark of the first. 
"I just turned my foot. It was more of a reaction more than anything else," Ladd said. "I just turned my foot, and it went in."

long-term brain or nerve damage, and one surgeon described him as "very lucky." 
"It's a sign of how good medicine can be and how good medical people can be," Panthers coach Jacques Martin said. 
The accident remains the dominant topic in the NHL, and to Clint Malarchuk -a goaltender whose neck was slashed in a similar incident in a game at Buffalo in 1989 -it resonated deeply. He won't watch the Zednik inci­dent, but has offered to meet with Zednik to talk about any­thing that's on his mind. 
"For any players who are traumatized like this, it's pretty gruesome," Malarchuk said. 
When Jokinen's skate hit Zednik's neck, a significant amount of blood immediately began pouring from a 1 ?-inch wound, leaving a wide red trail on the ice. Zednik skated to the Panthers' bench. His carotid artery -which car­ries blood to the brain -was nearly severed and emer­gency surgery that night at Buffalo General probably saved his life. 
"Shows how tough the guy is," Jokinen said. "He was able to skate to the bench, with the cut in his throat, los­ing blood like that. It was pretty amazing, you know?" 
Zednik never lost conscious­ness. He actually complained that Sabres' orthopedic sur­geon Dr. Les Bisson was applying too much pressure to his neck in an effort to stop the bleeding. 
By the time he reached the hospital, Zednik needed·five units (roughly five pints) of blood, a figure that suggests he had lost one-third of the blood in his body. 
"I think he will come back someday and play if that's what he chooses to do," Noor said. 
Practice seemed normal Tuesday for the Panthers, who had a team meeting before the 60-minute work­out, filled with all the usual skating and puck handling and shooting drills. Rob Globke, who was called up from Florida's AIIL affiliate in Rochester to fill Zednik's ros­ter spot, was with the team for the session. 
A 12-year veteran, Zednik had 15 goals and 11 assists in 54 games this season, his first with the Panthers. 
lie didn't manage a single point over 16 games between Dec. 28 and Feb. 1. But he had six goals and three assists in the four games that preceded Sunday's game in Buffalo, giving the Panthers a clear boost as the team tries to make the playoffs for the first time since 2000. 
"It's not like he wasn't hav­ing some scoring chances," Martin said. "They just weren't going in. Suddenly they started going in, and there's no doubt that the last two weeks that line had been very productive for our hock­ey team."

Unliwtunalnly, this is whern the logistics of an outdoor game get in the way of the iey dream. But tho biggest obstade to tlw Irish lacing up their skates inside the stadium isn't what you would think. 
It's not building the rink while preserving the stadium turf. It's not thn amount of money it would take to build an outdoor rink. And it's not the suppost~d tradition of having nothing but f(Jotball in Notre Dame Stadium. 
It's parking.

McGraw also believes the injury might be a blessing in dis­guise -an opportunity for the freslunan to learn from observ­ing. 
"I think it can be a real positive for a player and I think she will learn a lot from watching and listening," McGraw said. 
The Irish defense looked like a renewed squad against Pittsburgh as it managed to defend the three better and keep the Panthers to 31 percent shooting from the field. 
Despite dramatic improve­ments on defense, the Irish allowed the Panthers to grab 30 offensive rebounds. However, McGraw said her team should perform well against Marquette. 
"After playing so well against Pitt, I think our defense is much better," McGraw said. "We still freshman guard

will combine to

"[Ellis is] one of the best play­ers in the league, so you always have to know where she is," McGraw said. "But I think that their team, they're all capable of, on any given night, any of them having a big game. They've got some really good young players. I think they're really starting to gel as a team."

"Diving is going to play a big role in this meet," Bullin said. "The diving team has the potential to give the swimmers a very large lead to work with and aid them in bringing the Big East championship home. We've been practicing well, and all the guys are pretty con­fident and ready to head to New York." 

The divers' confidence is well founded. Irish divers dominat­ed their Big East foes through­out the regular season. 
Confidence alone, however, will not be enough to bring home the title. 
"It is not a meet we are going to be able to walk away with unless everyone is swimming and diving well," Bulfin said. "So we've been making the necessary steps in practice to get us prepared to win another Big East championship."

From Oct. 4 to Oct. 31 next season, Notre Dame football doesn't play at home.

If that stretch doesn't work, from Nov. 2 to Nov. 22 next sea-why can't we? 
There are peo­
plo who specialize 

in constructing rinks inside, outside or wherever, and there are always long breaks in the home football schedule. Put these two things together, add in a strong dash of the increasing amount ofinterest in hoekey at Notre Dame and, voila, we have an outdoor game.

HOCKEY COMMENTARY 
Time for the icers to march through the tunnel 
This may be an exercise in futili­

ty, but it sounds too damn enol not 
to put it out there. lnHLf.,rine instead of lounging around in your dorm room on a Saturday aftnrnoon in 1:ebruary, kicking the cmmplnd Natty cans oil" your cof­li~e table to make room tilr a Sbarro's pizza, you could be tailgating oulo.;ide Notre Dame Stadium for a game. 
Obviously the football team isn't 

going to be playing a mid-winter bowl in South Bend ever (or a post-December one for that mat­ter, it seems). 
But thn hockey tnam could play thern. 
College hockny teams have played two separate games in football stadiums (CCHA tnams, all) bnlilfl\ and the NHL has played two outdoor games as well. All of thnm drow huge crowds, worn gmat to wateh and put hoek­ey under a spotlight it rarely receives. 
A hoekey game against Miehigan in Notre Dame Stadium makes mf' drool. It makes me want to bundle up, grab a ease from Belmont, throw down a lawn ehair in C lot and wait for the gates to opnn. 

The wondrous South Bend win­ters and city life keep us students bundled up in our dorms, apart­ments and houses all winter. The only interaction we get is when we jam ourselves up in the sweatbox of a house party or bar. 
That kind of thing is fun and all, but our student body lacks any opportunities to get together as a whole like we can on football Saturdays. An outdoor hockey game, in addition to being a hell of a sight, would do that. ·

Long layoff before Big East title meet 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
With 32 days in between the regular season-ending Shamrock Invitational and the Big East championships, it takes some dedication to stay focused -and, more impor­tantly, to stay fast. 
With most of that downtime now behind the team, Notre Dame is looking to capitalize on the work it has done by staying sharp and making sure no one is worn out for the 
event in East Meadow, N.Y., on Feb. 20. 
Sophomorn John Lytle, who has consistently scored points for the Irish in freestyle events this season, said preparation involves more than just thn physical side of practice.
