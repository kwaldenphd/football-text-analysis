SMC career office helps seniors prep for fair 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 
With the onset of the Notre Dame Job fair today, the Saint Mary's Center for Career Opportunities (CCO) is preparing for an inf1ux of seniors in their offic·~. 
"Our office has definitely seen an increase in :he num­ber of students seeking assistance with preparing for the upcoming Notre Dame career fair," director of the CCO Stacie Jeffirs said. "Students are asking for as sis tan ce with fi3S umes, interviewing skills, career fair strategies, networking and much more." 
The CCO's new loc:ation in Spes Unica Hall seems to be playing a role in the large number of seniors who are visiting the center. 
"[We're] much more visible to students who are walking by," Jeffirs said. "Also, I think that we have put a considerable amount of effort to get the word out that our office is here to help."

My main goal in room picks last year was not to be on that side of the building, and I was success­ful. My window faces Zahm, and peace and harmony now reign in my Iife. 
That is, until last Thursday night. I climbed into bed around 2 a.m., blissful as could be. It usu­ally takes me about half an hour to fall asleep, and right as I was drifting ol'l', I heard voices. 
Two wandering lovers, having escaped parietals, had settled right under my window and began having an animated conversation, interrupted by breaks of silence that I'd prefer not to think about. 
After at least half an hour of lis­tening to their discussion, of which I heard every word, I climbed out of bed, navigated the dangerous maze ol' ladders in my tiny room, and cranked the win­dows shut. My roommate at this point sits up and says, "Thank (;od. I was about to call NDSP." 
So, in order to protect all of you from my roommate's intention (and I will let lwr do it next time), I have come up with a list.

Man blames spilled beer for erratic driving 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.­A man with four previous drunken driving convictions who was stopped for weav­ing in and out of traffic on Interstate 40 was ready with an excuse for his poor driv­ing: his passenger spilled his beer. 
Not surprisingly, the man was arrested just before midnight Saturday, said state police officer Kurtis Ward, who said he initially thought the driver was jok­ing. 
"He was so matter of fact about it, like it wasn't a big deal," Ward said. 
The 31-year-old man was allegedly too drunk to per­form field sobriety tests and was arrested on aggravated drunken driving charges, court records said. 
Human waste to be con­verted to fuel 
SAN ANTONIO -The U.S. city of San Antonio unveiled a deal on Tuesday that will make it the first U.S. city to harvest methane gas from human waste on a commer­cial scale and turn it into clean-burning fuel. 
San Antonio residents pro­duce about 140,000 tons a year of a substance gently referred to as "biosolids," which can be reprocessed into natural gas, said Steve Clouse, chief operating offi­cer of the city's water system. 
"You may call it something else," Clouse said, but for area utilities, the main byproduct of human waste -methane gas -will soon be converted into natural gas to burn in their power plants. 
The city approved a deal where Massachusetts-based Ameresco Inc will convert the city's biosolids into natu­ral gas, which could generate about 1.5 million cubic feet per day, he said.

Hurrit:ane threatens Gulf 
Illegal immigrants hesitate to evacuate for fear of border patrol 
Associated Press 
McALLEN, Texas --With Hurricane Ike steaming into the Gulf of Mexico, Texas emer­gency officials Tuesday stood ready to order 1 million people evacuated from the impover­ished Rio Grande Valley and tried to convince tens of thou­sands of illegal immigrants that they have less to fear from the Border Patrol than from the storm. 
Emergency planning nfficials were meeting all day tc decide if and when to announce a mandatory evacuation for coastal counties close to the Mexican border. 
With forecasts showing Ike blowing ashore this weekend, authorities lined up nearly 1,000 buses in case they are needed to move out th·::l many poor and elderly people who have no cars. 
Federal authoritie:; gave assurances they would not check people's immigration sta­tus at evacuation loading zones or.inland checkpoints. But resi­dents were skeptical, and there were worries that many illegal immigrants would refuse to board buses and go to :;helters for fear of getting arrested and deported. 
"People are nervous," said the Rev. Michael Seifert, a Roman Catholic priest and immigrant advocate. "The mes­sage that was given to me was that it's going to be a real prob­!em." 
One reason for the skepti­cism: Back in May, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the Border Patrol would do nothing to impede an evacuation in the event of a hurricane. But when Hurricane Dolly struck the Rio Grande Valley in late July, no mandato­ry evacuation was ordered, and as a result the Border Patrol kept its checkpoints open. Agents soon caught a van load of illegal immigrants. 
It would be the first mandato­ry large-scale evacuation in South Texas history. State and county officials let people decide for themselves whether to leave a hurricane area until just before Hurricane Rita struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. Now county officials can order people out of harm's way. 
Hidalgo County Judge J.D. Salinas said if an evacuation is ordered this time, county offi­cials will visit immigrant neigh­borhoods and forcefully urge people to clear out. 
After Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav, "there were a lot of immigrants who said, 'I'm not going to go,"' said Salinas, the county's top elected official. "It's going to be hard." 
In Washington, Rear Adm. W. Craig Vanderwagen, assistant 
U.S. health secretary for pre­paredness and response, told reporters: "In storm events, if people are trapped it doesn't particularly matter to those of us in the humanitarian assis­tance world which side of that border they come from. We will do what we need to do to evac­uate the people who need to be evacuated." 
At 8 p.m. EDT, Ike was about 95 miles west of Havana, Cuba, moving west-northwest at 10 mph with sustained winds near 75 mph. It was expected to cross the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening to a Category 3 with winds of up to 130 mph. 
Forecasters said that it could hit on Saturday morning just about anywhere along the Texas coast, with the most like­ly spot close to the Corpus Christi area. 
Areas from Matagorda Bay to Corpus Christi and south to Brownsville -about 250 miles of coastline ...:.._ were told to pre­pare for possible mandatory evacuation. 
On Tuesday, Ike roared across Cuba, ravaging homes, killing at least four people and forcing 1.2 million to evacuate. 
The Rio Grande Valley is still soggy from Dolly, which flooded the region, damaging hundreds of homes but killing no one. Many homes still have blue tarps on their roofs. 
The Rio Grande Valley's resi­dents are among those least equipped to handle hurricane flooding. It is one of the poorest parts of the country, with one­third of all families living below the poverty line, compared with 10 percent nationally. 

Professor discusses climate warming 
By LIZ O'DONNELL. 
News Writer 
Businesses should take a leadership stance in the effort to reduce global warming, professor Patrick Murphy said Tuesday night. 
"If the effects of climate change are to be improved, business will play a large role," Murphy told students, faculty, and members of the South Bend Community during the Berges Lecture Series in Business Ethics Tuesday. 
Murphy was the final speak­er of the evening during the discussion on Climate Change: Technical, Business and Ethical Implications. 
"The Berges Lecture Series has a policy of bringing in speakers who have experience dealing with ethical issues in business," Murphy said, "We take a 'role model' approach in that we invite individuals and companies with very good ethical reputations to partici­pate." 
Mark McCready, professor and Chair of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering was the first to address the audi­ence, giving a brief overview of climate change. 
He said levels of carbon dioxide have been increasing substantially due to fossil fuel use. The increased levels in carbon dioxide are to blame for why global warming is occurring, McCready said. 
Gerard Pannekoek. the for­mer President and Chief Operating Officer of the Chicago Climate Exchange said businesses can solve any problem with the environment so long as they commoditize it. He recently worked with 50 companies to design a rule­book for businesses on how to battle global warming in the United States. 
"[The rulebook] was a begin­ning, lets get something up and running, lets see if it moves. You can compare it to the Wright brothers. Let's hope this thing flies," Pannekoek said. 
After about 35 minutesof testimony by the members of the panel, the floor was then opened up to questions of members of the audience, which was mainly comprised of undergraduates in the Mendoza College of Business. 
The next discussion in the Berges Lecture Series will be on Sept. 15 in Jordan Auditorium in the Mendoza College of Business. Robert Nyhus, the Senior Program Manager of Herman Miller, Inc. will give a lecture entitled "Values and Decision Making."

Saint Mary's offered students the chance to save a life during their blood drive in the Student Center Lounge Tuesday. 
Olivia Barzydlo, Assistant Director in the Office for Civic and Social Engagement, helped coordinate the blood drive with Indiana Blood Center. 
"We feel that it's part of one's civic duty to donate if possible," Barzydlo said. 
Saint Mary's has been hosting the blood drive since 2005, Barzydlo said. The College began hosting the blood drives after the need for blood grew after Hurricane Katrina. The South Bend Medical Foundation helps to host the blood drives as well. The College works to host one to two drives a year. However, they are working to three or four drives on campus this year, she said. 
The whole process takes about an hour. When students arrive at the drive they must fill out a confidential screening test and have their blood tested. Once the donor is cleared, then they are able to donate. The actual process of giving blood takes ten minutes. Then, the donor is asked to stay for another 10-15 minutes to rest and have a snack. 
Barzydlo does not want stu­dents who are afraid of needles to be discouraged from dona­tion.

make the most of their senior year at Saint Mary's College. However, much of what we do in our office is unique to each student since interests and career goals vary," Jeffirs said. 
The center emphasizes the need to start career planning early by looking for intern­ships during a student's sophomore or junior year or building skills in career exploration, goal-setting, resume and cover letter writ­ing, job searching, network­ing, interviewing and gradu­ate school research. 
"As always, our staff is here to serve the needs of each of our students," Jeffirs said. 
The CCO is committed to promoting the continuation of learning and growth in both the personal and professional lives of students and alum­nae, she said. 
Jeff'irs emphasized that the networking is one of the most 

"Although many people are afraid of the needle, me being one of them, it does not hurt as bad as you may think. There is a bit of a sting at first, but it is not too painful," Barzydlo said. 
The drives are generally well attended by faculty and staff, Barzydlo said. Last year's drive had 72 people from the Saint Mary's community in atten­dance. All of the blood donated to these drives is given to the Indiana Blood Center and the South Bend Medical Foundation will be given to Hoosiers in need and remain in Indiana. 
Students donate for many dif­ferent reasons. Some have fami­ly members who have been ben­efitted from blood transfusions and many others just like to be able to help. 
''I'm a nursing major so I just feel like every little bit counts," sophomore Alison Chudzinski said. She has donated twice at Saint Mary's and five times in total. 
Saint Mary's will continue hosting drives through South Bend Medical Foundation and Indiana Blood Center through­out the year, so those of you who did not have a chance to donate will have more opportunities. 
"Believe it or not, there is always a need for blood," Barzydlo said. She said Saint Mary's is hoping to maintain the high number of donors with their upcoming blood drives.

popular way to find jobs at Saint Mary's because of the strong alumnae network. 
"One of the great resources that Saint Mary's students and soon-to-be graduates have at their fingertips are SMC alumnae," she said. "They are an excellent resource for networking and getting connected to opportu­nities throughout the United States in various professional areas." 
Saint Mary's students have many resources right at their fingertips including the recently completed Junior Jumpstart and Senior Startup programs. The CCO has had nearly 100 students partici­pate in both programs in which they learned more about internships, job searching and networking. 
"We are very pleased that so many students are taking a proactive approach with their career goals and begin­ning the process early," Jeffirs said.

John McCain and Sarah Palin." 
Yap and 24 others drove to the rally despite the Student Activities Office's (SAO) refusal to fund the trip. Originally about 125 students had signed up to go and Yap said the College Republicans

However, SAO denied the group's request, say­ing student funding can­not be used in support of any political candidate and also refused to give group members e x c u s e d

absences from their classes. 
"What angers me the most is that if the College Republicans cannot use money in support of a candi­date, what can we use the money for?" Yap said. "So in essence the University was telling us that we were essen­tially forbidden from going to the rally as a group. We had to drive our own cars and spend hundreds of dollars on gas to get to the event." 
However, members of the College Hepublicans said the trip was well worth the cost as all 25 students were given special front row seating and were able to shake hands with McCain and Palin. Yap said Palin even signed his Fighting Irish flag. 
''I'll be cherishing that for the rest of my life," he said. "I felt as if they were speak­ing to me and every other person in the room, young and old, and telling us that the future -our future would be well protected in their hands." 
Junior Cynthia Curley said he was able to connect with 
McCain and Palin during their speech­es. 
"You realize that they are real people and in the brief 15 sec­onds that you get to speak with them, they really look you in the eye and really connect with you," she said. 
Curley even 
invited McCain to stay in her dorm room for football games, adding hosting a presidential candidate would be well worth breaking pari­etals. 
"As he was leaving John McCain said he wanted to come to a Notre Dame foot­ball game, and I told him he could sleep in my dorm. It would be worth breaking parietals," she said. 
Education chair Andrew Clark and junior Christine Homero, who also co-chairs NO Votes '08, both said they were most excited to see Palin speak. 
''I'm really excited about 
Governor Palin as the vice presidential candidate," Romero said. "She's an idol of mine and she shows that the liberals don't have a monop­oly on feminism anymore. I love her." 
Clark said while he sup­ported McCain, he wasn't really excited for the upcom­ing election until Palin was picked as the vice presiden­tial candidate. 
"Everyone would just kind of tolerate McCain and sup­port him because he was the Hepublican candidate, but they weren't really excited. I think everyone's excited now," he said. "She brings the same charisma to the Republican ticket that [Barack] Obama brings to the Democratic ticket." 
The members of the College Republicans all said they hoped the ticket would con­sider visiting campus in the months leading up to the election. 
"Indiana right now is becoming a battleground state," Yap said. "According to polling, John McCain is only up by 2 points, so I think lhel would consider coming to campus." 
However, the members questioned the University's hospitality for candidates, cit­ing the fact that in the past 20 years only Joe Lieberman and Bill Clinton have visited campus in the midst of their bids for the White House. 
"It's kind of making Notre Dame fall ofT the map a little bit because we can't attract candidates to campus, Homero said.

Ike moves to the Gulf of Mexico 
HAVANA -Hurricane Ike moved into the warm waters of the Gulf and took aim at the 
U.S. and Mexican coas1s Tuesday after bringing down aging buildings in Havana and tearing through western Cuba's tobacco country. 
Forecasters said Ike, which has already killed at least 80 people in the Caribbean, could strengthen into a massive Category 3 storm before slamming into Texas or Mexico this weekend. 
Some 1.2 million people-more than a tenth of Cuba's population -sought refuge from Ike, which killed four people and shredded hundreds ofhomes as it barreled across the island. 
Russia to keep troops in Georgia 
TBILISI -Russia announced Tuesday it would keep 7,600 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia for the foreseeable future, asserting power in the breakaway regions even as it began a pullout from positions deeper in Georgia. 
The Kremlin's plans for a heavy military footprint in the enclaves mock Georgia's hopes that a revised peace agreement will lead to a complete Russian withdrawal from the fractured ccuntry at the heart of a bitter fray between l\l:oscow and the West. 
The deal that emerged from a day of frantic French dip. omacy Monday may defuse tension by removing Russian forces from positions they hold in Georgia weeks after last month's war. But it left serious questions unanswered. 
After hours of talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev promised to withdraw all Russian forces from positions outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia within about a month.

INDIANAPOLIS -Lawmakers seeking a clearer direction on what, if anything, to do about illegal immigration in Indiana got conflicting opinions and loose numbers Tuesday during their first study committee meeting on the issue. 
Professors specializing in immigration law gave different answers and advice. And although a member of the Washington, D.C.-based Pew Hispanic Center said there were about 100,000 undocumented resi­dents in Indiana, he said it could range from about 75,000 to 125,000.

Possible stroke befalls dictator 
Kim Jong Il's health could jeopardize international talks on nuclear weapons 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -North Korean dictator Kim Jong II may be gravely ill, perhaps the victim of a stroke, U.S. and other Western officials said Tuesday after he failed to appear for a major national parade. If so, it could jeopardize the already troubled international effort to get his nation to abandon nuclear weapons. 
Kim's absence from a mili­tary parade for the coun­try's 60th anniv!Jrsary lent credence to reports that the man North Koreans call the "Dear Leader" had been incapacitated during the past few weeks. 
The 66-year-old Kim, who has been rumored to be in varying degrees of ill health for years, has not been seen since mid-August. Though he appears rarely in public and his voice is seldom broadcast, Kim has shown up for previous landmark celebrations. 
"There is reason to believe Kim Jong II has suf­fered a "serious health set­back, possibly a stroke," one Western intelligence official said. A senior U.S. official said fresh rumors had been circulating about Kim's health and his control over North Korea's highly cen­tralized government. 
A former CIA official with recent access to intelligence on North Korea said that even before Tuesday the agency was confident that reports of a health crisis were accurate. 
The officials spoke anony­mously to summarize sensi­tive intelligence. 
The reclusive Kim took power in 1994 after the death of his father, Kim II Sung. It was communism's first hereditary transfer of power, and both Kims are revered in a personality cult perpetrated by the country's authoritarian government. 
To the outside world Kim is best recognized as a silent, waving figure with a bouffant hairdo and a quasi­military suit reminiscent of communist leaders of an earlier time. Word of his

Palin an increasing threat to Obama 
Associated Press 

MICHIGAN -Listening to Barack Obama, it can seem like Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is the main person standing between him and the White House instead of John McCain. 
Obama is putting as much heat on Palin as he is on the man at the top of the GOP ticket, objecting to the Republican Party's portrayal of her as a reformer who can bring change to Washington.

possible health problems recalled the Soviet era, too, when U.S. analysts pored over photos of military parades for clues to who was up and who was down in the Kremlin. 
Neither the White House nor the State Department would comment publicly on Kim's health, noting that the North Korean government is one of the most opaque and secretive on Earth. 
But U.S. officials said pri­vately they were concerned that Kim's apparently failing health jeopardized six­q.ation talks aimed at rid­di.(lg North Korea of its nuclear weapons. The United States has been a wary partner in those talks, but their success is one of the Bush administration's 
That is supposed to be Obama's distinction, and he's not taking kind­ly to Palin trying to claim it. Especially when it appears the new star on the GOP ticket is helping to boost its standing: McCain has jumped to a dead heat or narrow lead over Obama in the latest nation­al polls since choosing Palin as his running mate.

signature foreign policy goals. 
The talks are now stalled in a dispute over the North's obligation to allow intrusive foreign accounting of its known nuclear stockpile. 
North Korea's powerful military is known to be opposed to the negotiations with China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. Many ana­lysts believed the process was continuing mainly due to Kim's support and his backing of moderates in the foreign ministry. 
U.S. officials noted that shortly after the health rumors began to circulate in August, North Korea started to adopt a tougher line in nuclear negotiations. The North first suspended dis­

ablement of its main nuclear reactor and then threatened to rebuild it, saying the U.S. had not kept a pledge to remove the country from a terrorism blacklist. 
The reactor at Yongbyon was dismantled and its cool­ing tower blown up in June. In exchange, Washington was to strike North Korea from its list of state spon­sors of terrorism but only after Pyongyang agreed to a mechanism to verify that it was abandoning atomic weapons development. The North has yet to agree to the verification scheme. 
Kim's demise could lead to a succession crisis in North Korea. He has three sons by two women but has not des­ignated a successor.

"All we are asking for is basic cooperation," Trent said. "Most of the time, when we dP.al with stu­denlo.;, we have complete eoopera­tion." 
Student body president Bob Hnish and vice president Grant Schmidt sent an e-mail to the stu­dent body last week asking stu­denl'i to "be considerate to those around us, particularly residenl'i of the South Bend area." 
The news that the SBPD will be stepping up patrols of disorderly houses looks like a "preventative mewmre," Reish said. 
"Ultimately, we share the same goals, and we are glad the police are going to be out there, hopefully also protecting our students," Ht~ish said Tuesday. "I think our studenlo.; will be very cooperative, and I think, at the end of the day, they will realize our students are cooperative when police talk to them." 
The Observer reported Monday that two Notre Dame students were a.o;.~aulwd over the weekend on Notre Dame Ave. near Oub 23, receiving minor injuries. 
The SBPD will "absolutely" also be continuing neighborhood patrols to protect those walking through South Bend at night, Trent said. With ofiicers dedicated to conduct patrols of di'iorderly hous­es, regular beat officers will be free to conduct neighborhood patrols. 
The increase in patrols of disor­derly houses is not an unusual occurrence, Trent said. 
"It usually occurs at some point between the start of the school year and the point at which the football season end<> or it gets too eold to have outside parties," Trent said. "This year, we are going to do it more sooner than later."

The Council Hepresentatives (COR) dis­cussed revising rules for clubs to appeal to the Collaboration Fund Tuesday, following a closed-door discus­sion of an appeal at last week's meeting. 
Class of 2010 president Kim Kyrouac, who also serves on the Financial Management Board (FMB), which oversees club finances but isn't able to distribute funds, encouraged COR to consider an appeal process similar to that used by FMB. 
"Someone comes in to pres­ent to us at FMB," she said. "If we have any questions, they can answer us." 
Sorin Senator Mike Sayles agreed with Kyrouac. 
"No matter how much !the appeal] is for, it's always better to have someone from the event here because tl:Iey know it better than anybody else," he said. "They'd be able to clearly explain every single dollar they were spending." 
While Sayles is in favor of requiring every club appealing to the Fund to make a presen­tation before COR, some mem­hers said that·a presentation should only be a requirement if the appeal is above a certain amount. 
"If they feel they need the money, they shouldn't have a problem coming into COR," Off-Campus President Billy Lyman said. "It makes it diffi­cult when there's no represen­tative here."

event said they were 

impressed with Spiller's 
extensive knowledge on the 

subject. "I thought that the idea of studying the African Diaspora through the use of art was really interesting," sophomore Abbey Moon said. "Professor Spillers was really knowledge­able about all her subject 
matter and seemed really pas­sionate about her studies." 
There are other events on campus that the University has scheduled to coincide with Spiller's lecture which are taking place now, including the "Afro-Latino/as and the Americas" art exhibition which is on display in McKenna Hall through Oct. 15 and the "Blacks, Arts and the Americas" lecture and gallery walk at the Snite Museum which ends today. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the First Year of Studies depart­ment and the College of Arts and Letters.

Apple unveils new iPods, shares slip 
SAN FRANCISCO -Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs took the wraps off a revamped line of iPods on Tuesday and trumpeted a truce with NBC Universal that means the TV network will begin selling programs again on iTunes. 
The iPod announcements were largely expected, and investors were less than ener­gized, sending Apple's shares down $6.24, 4 percent, to close at $151.68. 
The iPod upgrades Jobs revealed Tuesday in a theater in San Francisco include two slick new Nano models, oval-shaped devices that Jobs said are the thinnest iPods Apple has ever made. They are leE.s than a quarter-inch thick.

If not Slytherin ... 
Apparently Frosh-0 changed. During the first week of school this year, I read an article about the orientation weekend that described a shift in focus from multi-dorm events to free time and residence hall bonding. I'm not opposed to the change, but I don't think the changes have gone far enough. There's a crucial process we as a Notre Dame com­munity lack that should occur dur­ing Frosh-0 but The Road which would Scholar have lasting echoes into life on cam­pus. The only way I can explain this process is to employ a passage from one of my favorite novels, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. 
Harry enters the Great Hall during his first year, anxiously awaiting his name to be called from the scroll so he can step up and sit under the mystic and infamous Sorting !lat. With trepi­dation he approaches the bewitched cap, which immediately begins to talk to him. Harry, who has just seen his future nemesis Draco Malfoy sent to Slytherin !louse, thinks to himself, "Not Slytherin, not Slytherin, not Slytherin." The Sorting Hat can hear him and debates these utterances while mentioning Harry's natural wiz­arding skill. Ultimately the hat pro­vides Harry (and the reader) with one of the most exciting moments in the entire Potter franchise: "Well if not Slytherin ... better be ... GRYFFIND­OR!" 
Much cheering ensues. 
What did I learn from re-reading this passage recently? We at Notre Dame have great Frosh-0 traditions, but we do nothing to imbue the ran­dom dorm assignments with the import they take on after Frosh-0. There needs to be a sense of dorm camaraderie from the first instant we walk on campus. We need a Sorting Hat Ceremony. And we need one as desperately as Dillon Hall needs a new signature event. We have residence halls with unique and strong identities as well as committed residents of those halls, eagerly awaiting the arrival of freshmen to mold in the ways of the Hall ancestors. We have rectors (Heads of Houses), RAs (pre­fects), and interhall sports (I've been meaning to get quidditch added to the RecSports list). Why can't we just take it one step further and focus on what we really need? 

The way I figure it, it wouldn't even be hard to create a Sorting Ilat Ceremony during the first moments of Frosh-0. All it would take is five steps. 
First Requirement: A Renowned and Historically Important School. 
I don't think that anybody can debate Notre Dame's ability to meet this requirement. Founded in the mid­19th century, a bastion of formative Catholic education, located in the heart of America. Our reputation pre­cedes us: Not only has the school been in the top 20 of US News and World Report undergraduate rankings for several years, but each incoming year it boasts stricter and more academi­cally rigorous admissions standards. 
Second Requirement: A Great Hall. 
There are many proponents of North Dining Hall. When it comes down to it, though, South just offers the classic dining hall feel. Oxford, Yale and many other great academic institutions around the world all employ the Great Hall style, with a head table full of fac­ulty and long corridors full of eager minds. We have the location; let's engineer it correctly. Either of South's eating areas is big enough to fit the assembled Frosh-0 population. 
Third Requirement: A Comically Outlandish Faculty and Staff. 
You can't honestly tell me that you haven't noticed that certain members of our faculty are just like those at Hogwarts. The gentle and reserved President who leads with a firm but loving hand. The burly football coach who watches over the great beast-like men of our beloved team, i.e. the "Game-Keeper." The mysteriously curt Potions master (For those who don't know, there is a Senior-only seminar in Advanced Potions that meets in the Radiation Research building). 
Fourth Hequirement: A Unique Hat. 
I see two possibilities here. We can consider ti1·st what many people view as an iconic image of our university ­the golden football helmets. A large sized helmet would be big enough to fit over anybody's head and everyone looks good in gold. If we want a more academic approach, we could use Notre Dame's doctoral tams. A splen­did piece of academic regalia, I almost want to earn a JD or Ph.D. from Notre Dame just to get the tam. 
Fifth Requirement: Magie. 

This is my fourth year at Notre Dame and I have learned a great many things hem. Yet for all I've learned, there is only one thing I know with certainty. We have magic at Notre Dame and in high supply. If you don't believe me, just listen to that catchy tune that plays during the entirety of the fall semester: "There's a magic in the sound of their name ... " So if we have magic in the name, then every time somebody wears Notre Dame memorabilia. writes the monogram on their notebook, or even utters the syl­lables that compose the words "Notre Dame" we harness the magic and use it to our advantage. 
So what's stopping us from bringing these elements together? I implore you, students and faculty of Notre Dame, to heed my advice and imple­ment a Sorting Hat Ceremony for next year. Though I will no longer be here, I would leave happy knowing that Frosh-0 and the entire Notre Dame experience had been made that much better.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A thanks to NDSP 
Dear Mr. Chapman, 
In response to the Observer article "Authorities arrest 34 during first home game" (Sept. 9), we, the Notre Dame student body, appreciate bolh your fine police work this weekend (34 arrsts!) and your friendly promises for more fme police work in the near future: "Be responsible for your con­duct ... underage drir.kers will be arrested on campus and at tailgate parties." 
You should, however, be well aware that threats such as the one you issued in yester­day's Observer aren't even necessary. Any Notre Dame student who has ventured off campus in the last two years has already had ample practice looking over their shoul­ders. 
We completely agree that a Library Parking lot, tailgate Natty (which, thank god, you are successfully combating) is far more dangerous to our well-being than the increasing off campm violence. 
It's comforting to kr.ow that we should both fear local police on game day mornings (when we need them the least), and fear the absence of local police on game day nights (when we need them the most). Obviously we understand NDSP's jurisdiction ends at Main Gate, but since you so proudly catalogue· your successes (34 arrests!) this weekend "working with Indiana State Excise Police, St. Joseph County Police, and South Bend Police" what's to stop you from collaborating again to better protect us off campus? 
It's heartwarming to realize that NDSP has their priorities straight, and the best inter­ests of this student body in their hearts. 
Bottom Line: Don't kid yourself that trum­peting 34 arrests by local law enforcement on the Observer's front page remotely makes up for local law enforcement's inability to protect us off campus or to apprehend those who are carrying out these violent assaults. It's an absolute joke that the NDSP spends our money buying ridiculous-looking, com­bat-ready ATV's to facilitate the crime fight­ing efforts of its overweight officers, instead of investigating more successful avenues to shore up off campus security for our student body. 
Underage drinking is illegal, but increasing off campus violence against this student body should be of far greater concern. Keep us safe from off campus violence, and until then, stop talking in the Observer. You don't deserve the face time. 
Sincerely, Ted Heilbron

In response to Gregory Barr's letter about Senator Obama's apparent lack of moral credibility ("Dude, where's your proportionality," Sept 9) on the abortion issue: as a Catholic who supports Obama, I've found that his respect for life in relation to the War in Iraq greatly outweighs his stance on abortion. His opposition to the war from the start, and his urgency in returning troops safely home is seldom recognized, yet equally worthy of praise from pro-life groups. 
The next president, whoever it may be, will have much more influence and power to end the violence and bloodshed in Iraq than they will have in ending abortion. If you need evidence, just look at the years since Roe vs. Wade passed through the Supreme Court in 1973: seven presidents (five Republicans, and two Democrats) have been in office and nothing has been overturned. 
Abortion is not the only issue in this election, and for that matter, it is more a judicial issue than a presidential issue. Our country is currently in dire straights because politicians insist on campaigning about issues they know will rile up voters (i.e. abortion} instead of focusing on the issues they have the most legitimate power to positively impact (i.e. the economy, a growing energy crisis and the war). My support of one candidate, for my own personal reasons, does not make me any less Catholic than anyone else, and I'm tired of having to defend my faith, along with my vote, to peo­ple who are too narrow-minded to understand that elections cannot (and should not) be boiled down to one singular issue.

Career Fair participants unwelcome 
As concerned students, we write with regard to the upcoming Fall Career Expo, an event organized and endorsed by the University. We are distressed to find that both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Raytheon Company will be seeking to recruit on our campus at this year's event. Despite the efforts of students in the past three consecutive years, the University has yet to respond to the critique that these two groups -both the CIA. and Raytheon ­represent a clear and very serious disre­gard for the stated mission to our University. 
The mission statement of the University of Notre Dame specifically calls our community w develop a "disci­plined sensibility to the poverty, injus­tice, and oppression that burden the lives of so many." Such a mission hopes to make our Universi-ty a place where "learning becomes service to justice." These admirable goa.s are put into practice in many ways. For example, many faculty membm·s engage the issues of race, poverty, conflict and injustice in their research. Additionally, more than 80 percem of the student body will be involved in some sort of service or communit} work in their time at Notre Dame. 
But when students begin to think about how they can t.:tke their interest for social justice and service that they learned here at Notre Dame, they are presented with a comradictory picture at the Career Expo. Organizations like the CIA and Raytheon serve a narrow conviction that place national self-inter­est and violent military power above the calling -found in our own mission statement-of "human solidarity and concern for the common good." They inherently contradict what we, as a uni­versity community, have placed as our true mission. 
Currently Raytheon is the world's fifth largest weapons manufacturer. In 2007 the company's revenue hovered around $20 billion after seeing an annual increase of a nine percent. Of Raytheon's contracts, 90 percent come from defense contracts while the company also does extensive business under guarded sub­sidiaries. The most celebrated of Raytheon's products is the 5,000-pound "bunker buster" bomb, a weapon most recently used against the people of Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon. As prof­its for Raytheon soar, the people who live where Raytheon's products finally land see only death, destruction and a broken future. 
The arms trade is an undeniably prof­itable business for Raytheon. But in August of 2006, to protest Raytheon's involvement in providing the cluster bombs and missiles used in the cam­paign against the people of Lebanon, nine men from Derry, Northern Ireland occupied a Raytheon office and were detained for trespassing. On June 11, a jury released the entire group in a unan­imous verdict. Eamonn McCann, one of the men detained, stated: "We believe that one day the world will look back on the arms trade as we look back today on the slave trade, and wonder how it came about that such evil could abound in respectable society." 
The Central Intelligence Agency, an organization historically known for exporting violent repression and terror everywhere from Chile to Iran to Laos, continues to subvert human rights in the current War on Terror. Using enhanced interrogation tactics (such as the now controversial water-boarding tactic) the CIA has unleashed a campaign of vio­lence against any and all those it sus­pects of terrorism and seeks to re-define the Geneva Convention. Black sites ­secret prisons away from media and human rights scrutiny -have popped up in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, most recently allegations point to a site in Poland. Now more than 200 CIA flights have passed through Great Britain in the CIA's program of secret rendition, a new name for the agency's age-old tactic of "forced disappear­ances." A report released by leading human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, charges the CIA with the disappearance of thirty-nine individuals. 
This year represents the 60th anniver­sary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948 and stated directly, in Article 5, "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhu­man or degrading treatment or punish­ment." Secret prisons, forced disappear­ances and torture are the methods of the CIA. However, they are not the way of our University. 
We hope to work with the Career Center and the University Administration to examine more closely who we allow onto our campus to recruit our students. We ask that each company and organization, regardless of their national reputation or alumni con­nection, be judged for their respect and adherence to our University's mission statement. We hope that our University can provide an opportunity where there is no contradiction between our convic­tions and our future employment. We, as concerned students in troubling times, call on the Administration and the Career Center to make a statement and clearly defme the moral position of our University on this issue. 
In hope for a more peaceful future,

Last Friday I had the unique opportunity to from the University of Michigan. (Don't worry­say it for real, not from a screen, and to be able .meet a man you probably feel very passionate our T-shirts were way cooler). We ended up to look at their eyes surveying the crowd and .. about -John McCain. Love him or hate him, he spread all over the venue ushering people to watch tbeir feet shuffling behind the podium as 
they spoke so passionately about a country you 
could tell they both love deeply. 

After McCain's speech, both he and Palin walked along the front of the crowd and shook hands. I managed to stick my shoulder through the crowd as McCain came along, and when he took my hand I looked him in the eye and said, "My father was in your squadron in 1975."  McCain stopped for a moment and looked down at me, asking, "Oh yeah? What was his name?" Completely caught off guard at his response and even aeknowledgement of my comment, I replied, "Greg DePrez." "Oh sure," he said. "Great guy. How's he doing?" 
Now, I am fully aware of how polities work, and that he probably doesn't even remember my dad, who met him a few times in meetings and pass­ing when McCain was his Executive Officer. But the mere fact that MeCain stopped, looked me in the eye and asked me for my dad's name, well, ladies and gentlemen, that was speeial. That rocked my world a bit. Plus, when he saw our . Notre Dame spirit, as he passed us he put two thumbs up and said, "Go Irish!"

country, even here on cam­
pus. Being of the McCain DePrez camp, I jumped at the chanee to see him in person Scene & Heard at a rally held near Detroit, 
oining my fellow College Republicans as we went to hear what he had to say the day af'ter his nomination aeceptance speech. Plus, all my Dem friends back in Denver 
to work the Obama convention, and I wanted some political stories of my own. 
We piled into cars early Friday morning, dressed in our ND GOP shirts and pretty mueh ready for anything. We'd been asked to volun­teer, whieh was perfeet because it meant we got into the rally for free. As we began to drive away, I realized my menial knowledge of Midwestern geography left me completely disori­!lllted. I had no idea what direetion we were driving, and the only thing I knew about Detroit was that it's where the Tigers come from. I bad a vague idea it might be in Miehigan, which I had a vague idea might be near Indiana. This was quickly remedied, and I got the geography lesson (eomplete with the hand map, someone pointing to the fingers and explaining where Detroit is). 
Upon arrival, we were given our volunteer passes and told to wait with fellow Hepublicans their seats and making sure no one bothered the press. 
When it came to the main event, we ended up right at the front -literally feet from the podi­um. Thus began the waiting. A series of speak­ers each explained why they think John MeCain is the ideal President for the next four years. As McCain's entrance eame closer, the musie got louder. Then, as the luck of the Irish would have it, the resounding theme from "Rudy" was pumped into the arena and our group of more than 20 eollege kids went erazy. We lifted up our leprechaun flag and began to wave it -kind of hard to miss -in front of the over 8,000 McCain supporters behind us. Thunderous, vietory-ori­ented music is no stranger to politieal eonven­tions these days, but MeCain happened to be using our theme song, our music. It was. need­less to say, a niee toueh. 
He and Sarah Palin entered -along with Cindy MeCain and one of their daughters soon after ­and we were content to stand directly in front of them and cheer along with the rest of the crowd, perhaps a little louder, though, knowing that we could indeed be heard. Palin said all the right things, firing up the crowd and expressing her respeet and admiration of McCain, and McCain managed to hit every mark. A lot of what was said echoed each of their speeches from the pre­vious nights, but it was indeseribable to see them

Spin City 

After working with fan favorites such as "Back to the Future" and "Family Ties," in 1996, Michael J. Fox joined up with Heather Locklear, Richard Kind and later Charlie Sheen to create a comedy show about the staffers in the office of a governor who was slightly moronic, arrogant and a complete public relations nightmare. "Spin City'' ran for six seasons, making us look at the lighter side of public office all the while. 
West Wing 

Smart, funny, relevant and inspiring, the "West Wing" is considered one of the best political dramas ever created and, among many, ranks high on the list of best 1V shows in general. The show follows the lives of White House staffers as they try to not only run the country, but push it forward. It may have been a bit ide­alized, there are few that wouldn't wish Jeb Bartlett (a Notre Dame grad, by the way) wasn't our president, but the show addressed political and moral issues that mirrored those in historical reality, and gave us an answer that felt achievable: Though we may not always succeed, with capable and passionate people in government we can brush greatness. 
Saturday Night Live 
Saturday Night live has always been a forum for comedic political discussion in the entertainment world. With political figures from Ralph Nader to AI Gore hosting the sidesplitting sketch comedy show, SNL is consistently hilarious while instilling a sense of political awareness in its young adult viewers. This year, SNL producer Lorne Michaels will release a spin-off, titled "SNL Thursday Night live," which will premiere Oct. 9 at 9:30 p.m. and focus on the 2008 presidential election.

The American President 
Aaron Sorkin's p_recursor to "The West Wing, "The American President" showcases Michael Douglass' acting chops as Andrew Shepherd, the idealistic Democrat whose romance with a lobbyist (Annette Bening) ruffles feathers on Capitol Hill. Sorkin occasionally overdoes his political fantasy (Does every Re­publican sit in dark rooms, smoke cigars and plot to rule the world in his or her free time? Really?), but the film deserves viewers from either end of the political spectrum. 
Commander in Chief 
What would our country look like with a woman in the Oval Office? As first female president Mackenzie Allen, Geena Davis posed the question weekly to 1V viewers for one season. "Commander in Chief," which was sometimes criticized for its "imperialist" view of the presidency, was eventually cancelled due to low ratings. Davis, however, won a Golden Globe for her role. 
Fahrenheit 9/7 7 
Arguably Michael Moore's most famous (and infamous) film to date, "Fahrenheit 9/11" was an onscreen forum in which Moore voiced his anger with the Bush administration for its role in engineering and carry­ing out the war in Iraq. While the tone and perspective tend to feel biased, the film raises serious questions 
: about our global political landscape -some of which have still gone unanswered.

While not focused specifically on political issues, Fox's "24" is inevitably political in its subject matter, deal­ing explicitly with issues of counter-terrorism and international affairs.

Independence Day 
Yes, we realize that the focus of this film is neither Capitol Hill nor the Oval Office, but rather an invading race of aliens and Will Smith in a fighter jet.

Blake off Davis Cup team 
put aside OJ's past

Associated Press 
MAI>HID, Spain -James Blake was IPI't off the dofnnding ehampion U.S. Davis Cup team because of exhaustion and replaced by Sam Querrny on Tunsday. 
Querrey was chosen ahead of Blake for the best-of-five series against Spain on outdoor elay Sopt. 19-21 in Madrid. 
Andy Hoddick and dou­blns specialists Bob and Mike Bryan round out the 
U.S. team selected by cap­tain Patrick McEnroe. 
"James is just exhausted physically and mentally after a grueling summer," McEnroe said. "He said he needed a break and we rnspect that. This is also a great opportunity for Sam, who has had a solid year, strong results on clay and has been a loyal practice partner for this team." 
Last year, Blake teamed with Hoddick and the Bryans to lead the Americans their record 32nd Davis Cup title. 
Spain captain Emilio Sanchez Vicario selected top-ranked Hafael Nadal, David Ferrer, Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez. 
Querrey was listed on the official nomination released by the International Tennis Fnderation, but it noted it was still awaiting confir­mation on his eligibility. Querrey, ranked No. 40, has never played in the Davis Cup. 
Last week, McEnroe said Blake would be on the team with Roddick and the Bryan brothers for a record 11th straight time. 
Nicolas Almagro was listed as a reserve for Spain, while 16th-ranked Tommy Hobredo was left off the team. 
Nadal, who lost to Andy Murray in the semifinals of the U.S. Open on Sunday, may get a few days rest before joining the team. 
"lie lost a match, but the tiredness and stress are within the usual limits," Sanchez Vicario said of Nadal, who may not attend practice Saturday. "lie is very enthusiastic about this tie."

Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -With other prospective jurors listening, a woman lectured O.J. Simpson on his behavior as a celebrity Tuesday and declared, "I felt he got away with murder." 
Like others questioned for service in Simpson's robbery­kidnap trial, the woman said she would try to be fair. But she became increasingly adamant, disclosing the dis­enchantment of someone familiar with Simpson's tri­umphs and disappointed in his fall from glory. 
''I'm very opinionated," said the woman. "I don't have any problem giving my opinion and sticking to it." 
The exchanges on the sec­ond day of jury selection showed the enduring influ­ence of Simpson's 1995 acquittal on charges of mur­dering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and friend Ronald Goldman. Since Monday, 20 of 248 prospec­tive jurors have been dis­missed for various reasons. 
The 61-year-old former University of Southern California and pro football star is now accused with co­defendant Clarence "C.J." Stewart, 54, of kidnapping, armed robbery and other crimes for allegedly stealing items from two sports memo­rabilia dealers in a con­frontation in a hotel room last year. They have pleaded not guilty. 
Under questioning by District Attorney David Roger, the prospective juror recalled Simpson's impact on her life. "I have seven brothers,"

Looking at Simpson, she said she thinks celebrities need to watch their behavior in public. 
"I think he chose to be a celebrity," she said. "lie chose to put himself in the public eye. Everyone is aware of it. lie should be a little more self-conscious of his actions. It's different than it would be for me." 
Asked whether she was going to treat the case differ­ently because of Simpson's past, the woman said, "I think as far as the first trial, I fe~~ he got away with mur­der. 
Roger asked if she could put aside those feelings and judge the current case on its own terms. At first, she said she could. But, questioned by defense attorney Gabriel Grasso, she said, "I can't be 100 percent sure." 
He asked to remove the juror and Clark County District Judge Jackie Glass allowed Roger a few more questions to try to retain the woman. But the judge finally addressed her. 
"You said you hope your personal feelings don't inter­fere," the judge said. "Is there some smidgen in the back of your mind that you think that it might?" 
"There's a smidgen," the woman answered, prompting her dismissal. 
Reactions to Simpson's first trial and celebrity status dominated the day. Some prospects said they thought celebrities generally got pref­erential treatment in court. 
One woman rejected the idea that Simpson had a "special aura" of privilege but recalled once sitting behind him at a football game. Another woman said she had expected a guilty verdict in Simpson's murder trial, but insisted, "His past has nothing to do with this case." She remained in the prospective jury pool.

CYCLING 

Associated Press 
AUSTIN Lance Armstrong is getting back on his bike, determined to win an eighth Tour de France. 
Armstrong's return from cancer to Win the Tour a record seven consecutive times made him a hero to cancer patients worldwide and elevated cycling to an unprecedented level in America. 
The 36-year-old Armstrong told Vanity Fair in an exclusive interview posted on its Web site Tuesday that he was inspired to return after fin­ishing second last month in the Leadville 100, a lung­searing 100-mile mountain bike race through the Colorado Rockies. 
"This kind of obscure bike race, totally kick-started my engine," he told the maga­zine. ''I'm going to try and win an eighth Tour de France." 
The sport and particularly the Tour have missed his star power, even though skeptics refused to believe he could win 7 Tours with­out the help of illegal per­formance-enhancing drugs. 
The 2009 Tour "is the intention," Armstrong's spokesman Mark Higgins told The Associated Press, "but we've got some home-
IN BRIEF Chargers' Merriman's 
season ends after surgery 
SAN DIEGO -Star outside linebacker Shawne Merriman pulled the plug on his 2008 season on Tuffiday when he told the San Diego Omrgers he'll have surgery on the two tom ligaments in his left knee. 
The loss of Merriman, whose hard hits earned him the nirkname 'lights Out," is a big one for a team that has Super Bowl expectations. 
Merriman's decision came two days after he barely resembled the player who had an NR-high 39 sacks in the past three seasons and played in three straight Pro Bowls. 
Merriman didn't immediately return e­mails and telephone r,alls seeking comment 
"Shawne informed me he did not feel right and thought it 00st to shut it down," Omrgers general manager AJ. Smith said in a statement. 'The road to winning the AFC West just got more difficult, but not im~le. Nothing is impa>.<;ible. Shawne is a great player and an inspirational leader. He will be missed. We wish him a successful surgery and a speedy recovery." 
work to do over there." 
Tour director Christian Prudhomme did not return messages seeking comment on Armstrong's decision. His staff said he would not comment before Wednesday morning, if at all. 
Armstrong's close friend and longtime team ctirector, Johan Bruyneel, now with team Astana, sent a text message to an AP reporter in Paris saying he did not want to comment now. 
In a video statement on his foundation's Web site, Armstrong said details ­such as a team and sched­ule -will be announced Sept. 24 at the Clinton

Global Initiative in New York City. 
"I am happy to announce that after talking with my children, my family and my closest friends, I have decid­ed to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden," Armstrong said in a statement released to The Associated Press. "This year alone, nearly eight million people will die of cancer worldwide.... It's now time to address cancer on a global level." 
In the Vanity Fair inter­view, Armstrong told the magazine he's 100 percent sure he's going to compete in the Tour next summer. 
Red Wings re-si~n agingdefenseman Cheiios 
DETROIT -The Detroit Red Wings re-signed 46-year-old defenseman Chris Chelios for one year on Tuesday. 
Chelios enters his 25th NHL season and his 10th with the Red Wings. He began his career with the Montreal Canadiens and also played for the Chicago Blackhawks. Last season, he became the second­oldest player in NHL history to appear in a game behind Gordie Howe. 
Chelios has 948 points in 1,616 regular-season games. 
Detroit also signed defense­man Kyle Quincey to a two­year deal. The 23-year-old appeared in six regular-season games for Detroit last season, alternating with the American Hockey League's Grand Rapids Griffins. 
Struggling Wie enters 
LPGK qualifying school 

LOS ANGELES-Unable to earn her card through sponsor exemp­tions, Michelle Wie has entered the LPGA Tour qualifying school and will play the first stage next week on the California course where she first rose to fame at age 13. 
Her father, B.J. Wie, had said at the U.S. Women's Open that Wie had "no other options" but Q­school if she didn't make enough money to finish the equivalent of 80th of the LPGA Tour money list. 
"Nothing has changed since then," he said Tuesday morning from Palm Desert, Calif. "She will go to Q-school." 

The first stage will be at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., site of the Kraft Nabisco Championship, where Wie played in the final group of the LPGA's lirst major when she was in the eighth grade.

Red-hot Blue Jays
-
sweep twin billing 

Associated Press 
CIIICACO -The Toronto Blue Jays are on such a good run tlwy think they can make
-the playoff's. Marco Scutaro hit a leadoff homer, Scott Holen and Vernon Wells went deep and the Blue Jays beat the Chicago White Sox X-2 to complete a day­night doublehflader sweep Tuesday and extend their win­ning streak to 10. Besides the swPep, the White Sox also got a big scare. Paul Konerko was helped off the field in the top of the fifth inning of the nightcap with what the team called a mildly sprained medial collateral liga­ment in his right knee. Toronto is on its longest win­ning streak since taking a fran­chise-record 11 in a row in from Aug. 27-Sept. 7, 1998, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Blue Jays moved within seven games of Boston in the AL wild-card race. Toronto took the opener 3-1 as A.J. Burnett allowed one hit in seven innings -a hard drive ofT his third baseman. Chicago didn't fare any better against .Jesse Litsch (11-8) in the nightcap. The right-hander allowed two runs· and six hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked two after pitching a four-hit shutout against Minnesota last week. Scutaro hit his second career leadoff homer, and Holen's two­run shot highlighted a four-run fifth in which the Blue .Jays took a 5-2 lead and knocked out Clayton Richard (2-4). Holen's drive made it 3-2, and Hichard left after a bunt single by Scutaro that put run­ners on first and second with none out. ILl. Carrasco came in and with one out, Alex llios drove a run-scoring single to right. Konerko cut ofT Jermaine Dye's throw toward the plate and his knnfl buckled as he released a throw toward sec­ond.

Hichard allowed five runs 

and live hits. 
Wells added a solo homer off 

Lance Broadway in the ninth. 
In the first game, the Blue .Jays' Lyle Overbay hit a two­run, two-out double in the sixth off Javier Vazquez (11­13). and Rod Barajas singled in a run against Mike MacDougal in the ninth. 
Burnett (17-10) allowed one unearned run, struck out seven and walked one, working around three errors and sever­al other defensive lapses. 
His bid for his second career no-hitter ended when Orlando Cabrera drove a hard one-hop­per off Scott Rolen's glove and into left field for a single lead­ing off the sixth. 
"It happens," said Burnett, who has a career-high 208 strikeouts this season and leads the American League. "I wasn't thinking about it. You see no hits up there, but you've got a long way to go even if it's the sixth inning." 
On Aug. 31, Milwaukee was infuriated when the official scorer in Pittsburgh ruled Andy LaRoche's slow fifth-inning grounder off CC Sabathia was a hit rather than an error on the pitcher, who dropped the ball during a barehand attempt. Sabathia wound up with a one­hitter, and Major League Baseball denied the Brewers' appeal asking that the scoring decision be changed to an error. 
As for Cabrera's hit? 

"That ball was hit pretty hard," Gaston said. "Maybe on turf, Rolen probably catches that ball, but it was hit pretty hard. I would say it's.a'hit." 
B.J. Ryan walk;.e'd Konerko and Ken Griffey Jr. leading off the ninth but escaped with his 28th save in 32 chanees. He struck out Alexei Ramirez and Nick Swisher before Juan Uribe grounded out. 
Chicago scored in the sixth aftl~r Cabrera's single when shortstop John McDonald boot­oct Jprrnainn Dye's grounder, Burrwtt threw a wild pitch and Jim Thom(\ hit a saerif'ice fly that drove in A.J. Pierzynski.

Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Ohio State will have its Beanie back for Southern Californi~.. 
Buckeyes tailback Chris "Beanie" Wells has been given the OK to play in the showdown at No. 1 USC on Saturcay night. 
Wells, who rushed for 1,609 yards and 15 touchdowns a year ago, went down with a foot injury in the second half of the fifth-ranked Buckeyes' opener against Youngstown State and did not suit up when Ohio State struggled to beat Ohio University 26-14 last week. 
But coach Jim Tressel said Tuesday that Wells would defi­nitely play against USC. 
"You know, Beanie ran well yesterday," Tressel said. "In fact, he ran betteJ~ than I thought he might." 
The next test for th 6-foot-1, 237-pound Wells is how he feels after going through his first workouts in 10 days. 
"The big thing is Tuesday and Wednesday work and will that create soreness," Tressel said. "Not only was he runrring well, then they (trainers) put him on the bike and wore him out, so they're trying to do all the things. He's been in tile under­water treadmill and anything we can do, we're doing (with rehab). I feel good about him." 
Wells would seem to be a 
weapon the Buckeyes (2-0) 
cannot do without against the 
fearsome Trojans (1·0) in the 
first meeting between the two 
old rivals in 18 years. 
Defensive lineman Lawrence Wilson, one of Wells' best friends, said he belives Wells will give the Buckeyes a big lift. 
"Beanie told me he was going to play and when B anie says he's going to do something, he does it," Wilson said. "He's a tremendous competitor. I know when he says he's goirrg to play, to play." 
The only catch in Wells' rapid return to action is that he won't really be participating in full­contract workouts until at least Wednesday. Ohio State's train­ers will work with him away from the team on Tu,3sday and then will watch closely when he practices with his teammates a day later. 
"If he steps on the field, he's going to give it his best. And his best is pretty good, you know," offensive tackle Bryant Browning said. "Yesterday I saw him running and he said he felt pretty good. He said he wasn't in much pain at all. He said he would be ready." 
Tressel said Wells told him, ''I'm ready to carry 45 times on Saturday." 
That doesn't mean he'll get the chance, however. 
"He's not going to carry 45 if he's not effective," Tressel said. "He's like every other kid, he wants to play and he's going to do all he can do and his effec­tiveness will be, in large part, based upon what the other guys do. If they block people, he can be effective. If they don't, it will be harder." 
Last year Wells averaged 124 rushing yards on 21 carries per game. Dan Herron (12 carries, 50 yards), Maurice Wells (9 for 
48) and Brandon Saine (5 for 
15) combined for 113 yards on 26 carries against Ohio, which led 14-6 midway through the third quarter and 14-12 head­ing into the fourth. 
"They ran hard. They com­bined for a pretty decent total," wide receiver Brian Hartline said. Hartline said their num­bers might have been even more impressive except for some listless and out-of-sync play by the rest of the offense. 
Wells isn't the only addition to the lineup, either. Starting cornerback Donald Washington and backup Jamario O'Neal both return as well after serv­ing two-game suspensions for an undisclosed violation of team rules. 
They figure to give the Buckeyes a shot of depth and talent in a secondary that has been stretched thin during their absence. 
Asked if Washington would take his accustomed place at field corner, making Chimdi Chekwa, who started the past 
. two games, a backup and nick­el back, Tressel grinned. "Tune in," he said.

Fisher concerned about QB 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Jeff Fisher said Tuesday night the Tennessee Titans didn't have the luxury of waiting to be sure about the safety of their quar­terback Vince Young before calling police for help in finding him. 
That led to four hours' of uncertainty Monday night before Young contacted the Titans and met with Fisher, a psychologist and police crisis negotiators at the team's head­quarters before driving himself home. Combined with Young's rnadion to being heavily booed in Sunday's opener, his mental state has been questioned heav­

...... 
ily the past two days. 
Fisher addressed all those questions on his radio show Tuesday night. 
"We can never be too careful sometimes, and sometimes you can't jump to conclusions. You have to wait on information and be patient," Fisher said. "The information I had didn't afford us any patience." 
The only thing known for sun~? Young has a sprained mndial collateral ligament in his

left knee, and Fisher said on his TV show that the quarterback will not play Sunday at Cincinnati. The coach would not give a timetable past that, call­ing thn test results good news and that Young needs to heal up his leg. 
What prompted the call to police? Fisher wasn't saying. 
"I was given some informa­tion from people that were close to him late afternoon, early evening that was quite honestly very concerning to me. 
I'm not going to go into specifics, but it was concerning to me," Fisher said. 
The quarterback was booed by hometown fans in the Titans' opening 17-10 win over Jacksonville for throwing two interceptions. He didn't look like he wanted to go back into the game and then sprained his left knee four plays later. 
His knee was sore enough Monday that Young didn't have an MRI exam as scheduled, a test postponed to Tuesday. Then people close to Young so wor­ried about him after he sped ofT from his home, they called Fisher for help. 
The coach called the Nashville police for help check­ing on Young's "emotional well­being," according to police spokesman Don Aaron. Young was located at a friend's home and agreed to come by the Titans' oflices. Police had used SWAT oflicers in unmarked cars in the search. and those oflicers checked him for weapons when arrived around 11:30 p.m. 
Aaron said Young had an unloaded handgun in the glove­box of his ear. Tennessee law permits unloaded firearms in vehicles as long as no ammuni­tion is present. 
Young talked to oflicers and a psychologist, according to a statement released Tuesday night by Nashville police. Young left about 30 minutes later and drove himself home. 
After talking to Young, Fisher called it a "complete misunder­standing." 
''I'm happy to report he's home. lie's resting. He's com­pleted the MRI. Don't have the results yet, and we're hoping he can get that knee healed up and can get back on the field as soon as he can," Fisher said on his radio show. 

With only veteran Kerry Collins healthy and Kansas City preparing to sign Ingle Martin off the Titans' practice squad, Fisher said they had agreed to terms with Chris Simms after working out Quinn Gray, Joey Harrington and Doug Johnson earlier Tuesday. 
Young's agent said there was no need for concern because the quarterback was at a friend's house watching football and eating chicken wings dur­ing the four hours when no one could fmdYoung. 
"When people were worried about him, I was on the phone talking to him," agent Major Adams said. "I didn't know there was any confusion about where he was as if he was miss­ing or whatever. He just said, 'Hey, I'm over here watching the game.' ... Then I start get­ting all these frantic calls." 
Fisher was asked if he was concerned by Young's sideline demeanor. Fans have been upset thinking Young didn't want to go back onto the field following his second intercep­tion, and the Titans have defended him as an intense competitor. 
"It is an issue, and it is some­thing we're working with him to kind of correct," Fisher said of Young's emotional reactions. "Our game is a very, very emo­tional game. There's going to be ebbs and flows at times, good plays and poor plays and nega­tive things that happen. Different players deal with it differently."

Cardinals not certain 
Pujols needs surgery 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS-Major league batting leader Albert Pujols may be headed to reconstructive elbow surgery that eould sideline him into next season. Or he might not. 
A day after the St. Louis slugger told KSDK television that he was considering having the operation, the Cardinals said it's not clear whether surgery is needed. 
"We are sensitive to Albert's stat­ed concerns," general manager John Mozeliak said in a statement. "At no time would we ever ask Albert to consider anything other then what is best for his career and future health." 
Pujols has been playing with a torn ligament since 2003, but the Cardinals said in a statement on Tuesday that management, Pujols and hi<> representatives agree that the injury "does not appear to be season-threatening nor do they have a clear indication that it will or will not require future surgery." 
Pujols didn't want to di<>CUSS his elbow before Tuesday's game against the Chicago Cubs. 
"I don't need to talk about any­thing," he said. "It's thn same ... as it's been all year." 
Mozeliak said the Cardinals will conduct a follow-up medical exam at the end of the season to deter­mine future decisions. 
Pujol<> discussed the possibility of surgery on Monday with KSDK. 
''I'm thinking about it," he said. ''I'm thinking really hard. I think in the long run the sooner that I get it done, the better it's going to be for me because I'm going to heal quick­er than if I wait two or three years. But it needs to be done." 

Cubs manager Lou Piniella, after learning of Pujols' remarks, said surgery might be the best option. 
"It's unfortunate, but ifit's going to bother him for a long, long time, get it over with and heal it and only miss the first month of the season and go from there," Piniella said "He's a very competitive guy, a very talented guy." 
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said he and Pujols talk about the injury all the time and recently he asked whether Pujols wanted to have season-ending surgery. The Cardinals started Tuesday 4'? games ofl" the NL wild-card lead with 19 games to play. 
"I said 'Do you want to shut it down?"' La Russa said. "lie said, 'No, I'm good to go."' 
Pujols and the Cardinals have said since last winter that at some point, the former NL MVP might require surgery. Pujols has a .359 average entering play with 32 homers a lPd the NL with a .359 National Leagun batting race and was at or near the top in several other categories. 
He was batting .359, one point ahead of Chipper Jones of the Braves. He led the major leagues with a .649 slugging percentage and 
a .466 on-base percentage. 

"It's not the ftrst time he's done this, done something that's just amazing," La Russa said. "He usual­ly plays in pain." 
The biggest risk to the elbow apparently is cutting loose with a throw. Pujol<> has been instructed to play under control. 
"He does it carefully. He does it to win the game," LaRussa said. "I think from the first day of spring training, he's had to be careful, but he's making all the plays."

"I would argue that Wake Forest and Connecticut were the two best teams in the country last season, and [Connecticut! returns almost everyone so they would be good you would think," Clark said. "Just because you're a year older doesn't mean you're a year better. but Connecticut is very well-coached. They'll be a force to be reckoned with." 
While it would be tempting 

to assume that, like last year, Notre Dame and Connecticut will be the two primary con­tenders for the Blue Division title, history advises to temper those predictions. 
Last season, the preseason coaches' poll picked DePaul to finish last in the league's Red Division, yet it was the Blue Demons standing at the top of the standings when the season ended. 
"It just shows that our league is so good and that you can't take anyone for grant­ed," Clark said of DePaul's surprising performance last season. 
Early results in 2008 suggest the emergence of a dark-horse in the Blue Division isn't out of the question. 
Seton Hall, picked to finish fifth in the division, is off to a 4-0-0 start and is outscoring opponents 13-3 and outshoot­ing the opposition 87-50. Sophomore forward Sam Petrone accumulated 17 points on eight goals and one assist in his last three games. 
Georgetown has also started 4-0-0 and has yet to allow a goal. The Hoyas, however, have yet to play a ranked opponent. 
All preseason predictions will be replaced by reality starting this week as Big East play gets underway. The Irish start their campaign with a home game tomorrow at 7 
p.m. against Marquette.

Offensive coordinator Mike Haywood said his players all understand the opportunity in front of them. 
Haywood -who played defensive back for the Irish in the early 1980s -said he still stays in touch with many old teammates and Michigan guys through coaching, which only builds the rivalry.

Weis: 'To hell vvith Michigan', but no disrespect to rival 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Euitor 
For the second time in the storied rivalry's history, an unranked Notre Dame team will face off against unranked Michigan this Saturday. 
The 11rst time it happened? Try last year. 
The rivalry between the blue and gold and the blue and maize may not have the 

national implications it nor­mally does, but that doesn't mean it's any less important for those involved. 
"It's not just the tradition of the schools," Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "It's locale. It's recruiting. There's a whole number of factors that are involved in it besides just the winning and the losing." 
The Wolverines have hung 38 points on the Irish in each the past two years -both in dominating vic.tories. Both Weis and his players held to their season mantra, saying that the past is in the past and last year's debacle was no extra motivation this week in practice. 
"It's Michigan and Notre Dame," sophomore guard Chris Stewart said. "I mean you don't really need too much more than that." 
Stewart said the game would definitely be physical, but beyond that, the Irish weren't taking a much differ­ent approach than they did in last week's win over San Diego State. 
"Last season is last season," sophomore running back Robert Hughes said. "We just try to come out and do our jobs each week." 
Several players played down the rivalry by saying it was the most important game on the schedule only because

Senior Brittany Bock returns from injury to defend Player ofthe Year honors, lead Irish title run 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Wrirer 
Watch any practice or any game and you're sure to hear Brittany Bock yelling on the field, but she's not arguing with anyone. 
She's encouraging her team­mates to fight their tiredness and keep up their aggression -and that's why she's one of the leading offensive players for the Irish. and why she was named co-captain along with fellow senior Carrie Dew. 
And after scoring the only goal against then-No. 2 North Carolina, Hock was named the Big East Offensive player of the week. It was the first time Irish coach Randy Waldrum gave her the minutes she was accustomed to playing last season. 
Bock suffered a high ankle

Belles still vvinless in conference 
Observer Staff Repon 

Despite nine kills and nine digs from junior Lorna Slupczynski, the Belles (4-3, 0­2 MIAA) were swept in three games by No. 17 Hope, 25-18, 25-21, 25-12. 
Sophomore Meg Rose led Saint Mary's with 10 digs while freshman Danie Brink spread around 21 assists in the Belles loss. 
The win was the sixth in a row for the Flying Dutch (6-1, 3-0 MIAA), who jumped up six spots from No. 23 in Tuesday's Division III poll. 
Junior setter Andrea Helminiak, the reigning con­ference player of the week, tallied 38 assists, nine digs and six kills for the Flying Dutch. 
Senior outside hitter Nora Slenk and junior outside hitter Teresa Borst each finished with double-digit kills, totaling 11 and 10, respectively. 
Saint Mary's will attempt to earn its first conference victo­ry when it faces MIAA foe Olivet at 6 p.m. Thursday.

Big East schedule will provide plenty of tests

South Florida was picked by the league's coaches to win the Big East's Hed Division. No. 5 Notre J>anw beat USF 5-0 this 
past  weekend  in  the  Mike

Tournament.  

What dons that say about the Irish's chances this year in the Big East Blue Division? Not much. says Irish coach Bobby Clark. 
"!The game! says we played well Sunday and South Florida didn't," Clark said. "These things happen. If we played South Florida tomorrow it would be a tough game. These are one-off games, and for whatever reason they weren't ready." 
That's not to say that both Clark and the preseason pun­dits don't have high expecta­tions for this year's Notre Dame squad in Big East play. In a preseason poll, the Irish were picked to finish second behind No. 3 Comwetieut in the eight-team Blue division.

COMMENTARY 

Legendary Holtz 'ND man' always 
For those of you who haven't heard yet, we an~ in the midst of what should be ~ailed "Lou Holtz Weekend" at Notre Dame. The former head ~oaeh and eun'ent 
ESPN collnge football ana­lyst will speak at Friday's pnp rally, have a statue dedicatnd for him Saturday morning and 

tlum be hon-Jay Fitzpatrick ornd again at halftimo 
Sports Writer 
of' the game Saturday. And why not? 
The most obvious reason is that he is in the Mount Hushmore of Notre Dame foot­ball alongside Knute Hoekne, Ara Parseghian and Frank l.eahy. lloltz !ell Notre Dame with 100 wins, se~ond to only Hoekne's 105, and a national championship. 
But alongside his coaching rncord at the University, Holtz is the ultimate "Notre Dame Man." 

I'm sorry for inventing a term just now, allow me to explain. 
Many of you have likely heard the term "Michigan Man," gen­erally applied someone who went to Michigan or coached Dame community (or as many call it, Family), his belief in the traditions and history of Notre Dame were strengthened more 
than anything. 
Unlike the old saying "Records are made to be broken," Holtz understands that some just aren't. When he left Notre Dame, he said it was for a wide variety of reasons, and although it was­n't the deciding factor, Rockne's all-time wins record played into his retirement. 
"To be called the winningest coach in Notre Dame history would not have been fair. I had enough time, if we hadn't missed some extra points or field goals, maybe it might have been differ­ent," Holtz said. ''There are cer­tain records that should stand; I felt I didn't deserve to break it." 
Nowadays, Holtz continues to be the ultimate Notre Dame Man, this time on television instead of the sideline. Sitting next to the equally biased Mark May, Holtz is the "voice of rea­son" at ESPN. defending Notre Dame against all-comers. But Lou doesn't try to hide his bias; rather, he accepts it as part of his love for this school. 
"Even though on television you're supposed to be unbiased, you're supposed to be fair and honest, and I'm none of those

needs to be 
someone who supports and respects Notre 
Dame and what it repn1sents. 

Everyone knows someone like lloltz, who grew up rooting lor Notre Dame for no other reason than they were Catholic and liked football. Holtz is no excep­tion. 
"I think you're a Notre Dame man growing up. I was Notre Dame from the time I could make the sign of the cross, so to speak. Whereas you're a Michigan man when you get there," Holtz said. 
Holtz added that the late Bo Schembechler, who could be called the quintessential "Michigan Man" because of his success with the Wolverines. could not have been so before­hand because he was an assis­tant under former Buckeyes leg­end Woody Hayes. 
"I guarantee you Bo Schembechler wasn't a Michigan Man before he went there. You don't coach at Ohio State and be a Michigan Man," Holtz said. 
For Holtz, college was almost an allerthought he would not have pursued if not lor his high school football coach. lie didn't even make it to the University in an otncial capacity until 1986. But his entire life, he was, to varying degrees, a "Notre Dame Man." 
When Holtz finally did become an ollicial part of the Notre enough to be a 
part of it. 
"Notre Dame is not just foot­ball. It's such a special place to be able to go to the Grotto, to Sacred Heart. You're excited to walk that campus and see the students. It's magical. There's no other place in America like it," he said. 
But just as Holtz's fandom stretehed from his youth, he said that every person in the Notre Dame community "will fall in love with it even more so" after they leave. 
"When they found out the tremendous respect that every­body has for Notre Dame, then you really come to appreciate what makes Notre Dame great," Holtz said. 
But what really makes Notre Dame great isn't the places or events or traditions. It's the peo­ple, people like Holtz, who did their best in whatever capacity for the University. 
So throw out all the wins, the big games, the records, every­thing football related. 
So now why does Lou Holtz deserve a statue? Beeause he is Notre Dame.

WOLVERINE RUSHING WOLVERINE PASSING 
With McCarthy and Bruton surging up the middle of the field the Irish pass defense looked impressive despite the lack of pressure on Ryan Lindley last week. Veteran Terrail Lambert adds experience at the corner position.  
A trio of new, young quarterbacks and a new offense have given Michigan a slow start through the air. Threet looked much improved against Miami of Ohio last week but the entire team needs a few more games before they look like West Virginia.  

The defensive line did­n't prove to be too intim­idating against San Diego State, but it didn't get too many chances to prove what it could do. The line should show it's new beef this weekend against a run-oriented attack.  
Michigan is one of the few teams who is as deep as Notre Dame in the hack­field. Threet also looked good carrying the ball. The big uglies are much stronger than the Aztecs and the Rich Rodriguez offense is only going to get better as the weeks go on.  

SPECIAL TEAMS 
Former walk-on Mike Anello adds a spark of pride to the Irish special teams. The kicking game still needs plenty of work with one missed and one botched field goal last week. Maust looked good on punts, and he will have plenty more practice Saturday. 
Michigan kick return­ers are averaging 22.3 yards per return and have plenty of big play potential. Lopata shanked a PAT against Utah, but is 2-for-3 on field goals in the Wolverines' first two 
games.

INTANGIBLES 
Lou Holtz's famous pep talks should give the team a little bit of fire. Add that to the fact that they still have a lot to prove in front of their home fans after last week's win and the Irish should be ready to roll Saturday afternoon. 
The Wolverines are still looking for a big win and although it's a down year, a win in South Bend is always important. Rodriguez will have his troops armed and ready for his first trip to the house that Rock built.

Tate makes transition from athlete to receiver 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
Against San Diego State, sophomore wideout Golden Tate caught six passes for 93 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown. 
Not bad for someone who a year ago was "a chicken with his head cut off," according to offensive coordinator Mike Haywood. 
"He was just out there run­ning," Haywood said. " ... But he's done a good job, he works really hard. He's one of the guys that I like to joke with at practice because he's a funny guy, but he's really conscientious about getting better every day." 
Last season, Tate primarily knew how to do one thing as a receiver -run the go­route. Slants? Outs? Comebacks? Forget it. They'd have to wait. But now with a season and many post-prac­tice sessions with wide receivers coach Rob Ianello under his belt, Tate does more than just run as fast as he can down the field. 
"I feel like a more complete receiver," Tate said. "I feel like I know what I'm doing and I feel like the team and coaches have confidence in me." 
Tate made a splash on Sept. 29 last season when the Irish played Purdue, catching three passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. Each catch came on a go-route. 
"I wasn't in the game plan a sport I never played that much. I was just on the before," he said. sideline and coach is like Tate realizes now that he '23,"' Tate said.

But Tate said even that go­route wouldn't have hap­pened a year ago. He and Clausen surveyed the cover­age and decided to adjust Tate's route before the snap. 
"Last year, I would've run the original route," Tate said.

"And he would've thrown it and it might've been picked off and I would've been like, 'Wait, what's going on?"' 
Luckily for Notre Dame, this isn't last year.

Ga. Tech transfer Threet gets starting nod 

By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
Rich Rodriguez had it all planned out. 
He would lure coveted quarter­back recruit Terrelle Pryor away from West Virginia, where he ran a high-scoring version of the spread offense with quarterback Pat White, and bring him to his new job at Michigan. Pryor, with his speed, athleticism and strong arm, was the poster child for spread offense quarterbacks. He would help usher in the new offense. 
But Pryor bailed, instead head­ing to play for Jim Tressel and enemy Ohio State, and Rodriguez was forced to make do. Steven Threet, a redshirt freshman transfer from Georgia Tech, and junior Nick Sheridan now have the responsibility of learning and running Rodriguez' offense. 
"You've got to be patient because they're young guys and we have to make progress each week," Rodriguez said after the Wolverines' 16-6 win over Miami (OH) Saturday. "They will defi­nitely get more confidence as the season goes on." 
The idea behind the spread is to get as many skill position ath­letes (running backs and wide receivers) in the game as possi­ble and spread them across the field. This keeps the defense from congregating in the box and forces them to play one-on­one more often. The defense is stretched thin from sideline to sideline and has less help mak­ing tackles, so a missed tackle can easily result in a big play. 
It's common to see reverses, direct snaps to running backs or quarterback runs because the idea is to get the ball in the hands of speedy players. The play of the spread centers on the quarterback's ability to work through his progressions well. 
"I made some of the right reads this week," Threet said after Saturday's game. "I had some difficulty seeing things next week, but I saw them this week." 
Neither quarterback has been great. In Michigan's 25-23 loss to Utah, Threet completed eight-of­19 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown. and Sheridan com­pleted 11-of-19 with a touch­down and an interception. Against Miami (OH), Threet was 6-of-13 for 63 yards and Sheridan was 4-of-5 for just 40 yards. 
Irish coach Charlie Weis said he expects to see both Sheridan and Threet, and possibly Carlos Brown, at quarterback. Brown is a multi-position player who is more of a threat on the ground than Sheridan and Threet but missed time because of a shoul­der injury. 
"I think they'll have a Carlos Brown package that we'll have to practice," Weis said in his press conference Tuesday. "I think we'll see [Brown] a little bit at quarterback in this game now that he's healthy, because the other two guys are more of throwers and this kid is a run­ning back that has played some quarterback." 
A defense has enough trouble covering the spread, but what adds to the confusion is the no­huddle offense the Wolverines use. They approach the line of scrimmage to see what defensive personnel and alignment they are facing, then call a play based on what they see. In this way, they can create mismatches with their skill position players. 
Weis met with Rodriguez before the beginning of last sea­son to discuss aspects of the spread offense and said the no­huddle offense intrigued him. 
"I thought it was really inter­esting how [Rodriguez] calls almost every play at the line of scrimmage," Weis said. 
At West Virginia last season, Rodriguez' offense averaged 39.6 points per game and gained 
456.2 total yards per game. Because they had White and running backs Steve Slaton, who now plays for the Houston Texans, and freshman speedster Noel Devine, most of those yards came on the ground. 
The Wolverine offense may be similar; so far, no receiver has caught more than eight passes or 64 yards in the first two games combined. Freshman running back Sam McGuffie found his stride against Miami (OH), rush­ing for 7 4 yards on 17 carries, but the Wolverines have only averaged 107 yards rushing in their first two games -some­what low for a spread offense. 
Rodriguez has shown no signs of deviating from the Threet­Sheridan rotation.

"We may start off the same way we did last week with Steve and Nick, Steve going first," he said. "If one guy would emerge and play to the point where it's just him and he's playing at that level, that would be good. Our concern is that whoever is doing the ~naps can execute the sys­tem.
