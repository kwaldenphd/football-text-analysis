It's Badin and Walsh! 
by Maria Gallagher 
Badin and Walsh halls have been officially designated as residences for female un­dergraduates enrolled at Notre Dame for the 1972­1973 academic year. 
A three-page release issued yesterday afternoon from the office of the vice president of student af­fnirs confirmed rumors and speculation that had been rampant since various halls first came under consideration, and provoked a storm of protest, 
The reasons for the selection of Badin and Walsh given in the announcement were because "both allow for appropriate security for young women, both have adequate physical facilities and both have room available for social and r~reational purposes. Necessary renovations in each hall could be accomplished at a reasonable cost." The statement also includes size of the halls and their central location as advantages. 
Rev. Thomas Blantz, who issued the an­nouncement, said yesterday that still another factor in the choice was the wide variety of rooms offered by both halls--th_e possibility of singles, doubles, and quads. Blantz ctted this as the reason for choosing two smaller halls rather than one large one. 
Emotions ran high at meetings in both halls as did confusion. Of primary concern were the relocation provisions for "evicted" students. The major protest centered around the breaking up of an established community, and each hall argued that its spirit was "unique." "Why our hall?" students pleaded at both sessions. 
Rev. Daniel O'Neill, Walsh hall rector for 10 ' years, called upon men in Walsh at the meeting there "to accept the decision graciously ... what do you say at a time like this?" He added to the restless

Residents are shocked, curious and resigned 

Students from Badin and Walsh Halls exhibited shock, despair curiosity, and resentment as they reacted to last night's an­nouncment that their halls would become residences for women next year. 
Greg O'Toole, a sophmore at Walsh, said, "It's generally felt by everybody that it's a rotten deal. When they had the vote for co-education, they didn't say they were going to take our halls away." 
A few of the residents of Badin thought it surprising that their 
Girls for Badin and Walsh Halls 
(continued from page 1) south would cause them to be concentrated there. Imhoff said he has confidence that the HPC will handle student displacement better than in the case of Carroll hall. 
Hall Life Commissioner Bob Higgins pointed out that Badin is the third oldest hall on campus, and that its physical plan is "awkward, to say the least." Himself a Badin resident, Higgins described the living conditions there as "bad, but the spirit is excellent. It's the only thing that keeps guys want­ing to live there. The forced dissolution of this unique spirit is the main objection in the minds of Badin residents." Higgins commented he couldn't 
understand why students affected were not con­
sulted in the decision, or why recommendations of ----------"'1""""-------­
the co-education committee <headed by Jerry Buschelman of Walsh) were completely thrown out. "Walsh and Badin were at the bottom of the list," Higgins said. 
"Girls should be offered at least livable con­
ditions. The university is not putting its best foot forward," Higgins concluded. "The whole thing is just another example of typical University disregard for the opinions of students in matters that concern them." 
Rev. Leonard Biallis, rector of Badin, said that his first concern was for his students, "especially the ones who have been living in Badin for a couple of years·. Since the decision is irrevocable, it is my hope that they can move in fairly goodsized block to other halls and thus preserve that unique spirit that Hall.

hall was chosen. Ed Ellis, a 
junior, said that he couldn't "see 
girls living in this hall." 
Similarly, Jerry Lutkus also a 
junior, remarked that he 
"couldn't figure out what girl 
would really want to live in 
Badin. It's kind of a dungeon." 
Lutkus echoed other sen­timents as he completed his comment. "But everyone who lives there loves it. To overuse the term, I guess we were developing a real community." The hall spirit was another matter for concern. Ellis said, "We have a terrific spirit here. 
characterized Badin." 
"My second concern," Biallis continued, "is for the girls who will be living in the new female dorms. I would hope that Fr. Blantz's notes are merely suggestive, because I feel that further and more thorough renovations than those specified are required." 
Biallis believes that the girls will be accepted as Notre Dame students without discrimination or bitterness. He views the change as part of "cutting the umbilical cord of the past to move on to more mature relationships." This, he feels, is a "necessary process;" only the first step in a series which will hopefully culminate in a resurrection to a truly adult, Christian university." 
There will be a meeting of the Notre Dame 
Student Senate Thursday evening, 7:00, in the 
La Fortune Student Center Auditorium.

p.m. Wednesday (February 9) in the faculty lounge of Northside It's a damn shame to break it up." This matter of breaking up was mentioned by nearly all of those who were questioned. 
· Jeff Warnimont, Paul Aspan, and Mike Desposito, sophmores who share a suite in Badin, were concerned as to whether or not they· would even wind up "in the same .hall" next year. 
Aspan said that he hoped "the University will utilize more common sense in re-locating us than they've shown in the past." 
The freshmen feelings in both halls were summarized by Ken Lee from Walsh who said that

"Next year we're going to have to 
start all over again just after 
we've gotten ourselves settled on 
this hall." 
Neil Loughery, another fresh­man, said, "We had a pretty good idea it was going to be us. Nobody wants to leave; however, we just have to accept things as they are. We're going to try to get into the hall we want to. If we can't, we're going off-campus." 
This idea of moving off-campus as an alternative to another hall was by far the most popular solution to the problem. 
It appears that to the people of Walsh and Badin, the situation is closed. A number of the residents merely said that there is nothing they can do but accept another hall or live off-campus. "The

Dave "Bullet" Barry, a resident of Badin's fourth floor and a candidate for Vice Presient in the upcoming electionstated "If I win, I'll rule in exile." ' 
Continuing, Barry said "At first I was a little upset 'but I realized that somebody had to get hurt. I'll just miss my pillow." 
John Gerspach, a freshman from Badin, was the last to be interviewed. He said, "I guess Badin won't die. I don't see much future for hockey in the corridors, anyway."

A sulphur oxide tax 
by E. W. Kenworthy 
(c) 1!172 New York Times 
Washington, Feb. 8 -In his third annual en­vironmental message to Congress, President Nixon said today that he would soon propose a tax on sulphur oxides emitted by the electric power, smelting, refining and other industries. 
A year ago Nixon announced in his environmental message that he would ask Congress to impose such a charge. There were immediate protests from industries emitting sulphur oxides into the at­mosphere that the technology for controlling such emissions was either not yet available or that, if available, was prohibitively expensive. The President's proposal was never sent to Congress. 
Today Nixon said that in the interim the White !louse Council on Environmental Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Treasury De$partment had completed studies and agreed on the details of such an emission charge. 
Nevertheless, the proposed tax is likely to prove the most controversial item in the program outlined in today's message--a program containing seven proposals for new legislation and several executive actions but, over-all, a program far less extensive or costly than that contained in last year's message. 
By way of explaining this, the President said that Congress had failed to act on almost all the legislation he proposed last year, although com­mittee hearings had "attracted heartening interest and support." He then added: 
"Last year was, quite properly, a year of con­sideration of these measures by the congress. I urge, however, that this be a year of action on all of them. so that we can move on from intention to accomplishment in the important needs they ad­dress." 
Aside from the sulphur oxides tax, the following were the principal new initiatives, either by law or executive order, announced by the President today: 
--an amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act under which E.P.A. would issue requirements and guidelines for state programs to regulate on-land or underland disposal of toxic wastes posing health hazards, with provisions for federal enforcement if a state did not establish a satisfactory program. 
This amendment would be particularly directed at such practices as the oil industry's pumping back underground the water injected in wells to force oil to the surface, and underground disposal of inud­strial wastes around Houston which have en­dangered water supplies. 
Such a law is certain to provoke opposition fronm the oil industry. 
--a bill requiring the states, through local and regional agencies, to regulate sediment flowing into waterways from building and road construction. Again E.P.A. would provide guidelines, and the federal government would impose a program if a state failed to establish one. Although the bill would 
call for state action, Russell E. Train, Chariman of the Council of Environmental Quality, told repor­ters that the forest service would be required to ('nforce rigid sedimentation controls on logging roads built by timber companies with contracts to cut in national forests. 
--amendments to the administration's bill, in­
troduced last year but still not enacted, to require 
the states to protect lands of "critical en­
vironmental concern." One amendment would 
require states to control the siting of major high­
ways and airports. Failure to do so would subject a 
state to a 7 per cent cut in federal funds it was en­
titled to from highway and airport construction

A long struggle to unite Ireland 
by Bernard Weinraub 
(c) 1!172 New York Times 
Bt>lfast, Northern Ireland, Feb. 8 --Prime Minister Brian Faulkner launched a bitter attack today on the Irish government and said that "a long and bloody struggle" would take place if the Roman Catholic minority pressed for a united Ireland. 
Faulknt>r's major speech in the Stormant Parliamtnt took place amid Protestantfears of new Jlolitical moves by the British government that would break the control of the Unionist Party, which has dominated Northern Ireland for 51 years. Protestant politicians insist that the end of Unionist rule would lead to the unification of Ireland, a move that the majority bitterly rejects. 
"Our history, our tradition, our economic in­terests link us firmly with Great Britain," said Faulkner in the half-empty chamber. "We see it as an absurdity in the modern world to cast off from a powerful and outward-looking community to join our destinies with a wak and inward-looking one. 
"What we see of the Irish Republic, we do not like. 
Tlw whole ('thos of the Republican State --the strul'ture of its constitution and of its laws --these things are repugnant to us." 
Most protestant here even moderate, non­tlnionists, reject unity with the Irish Republic because they see themselves as British citizens, not Irishmen, who would turn into a dissident minority in a single Ireland. Protestants view the Irish Hepublic aas a nation dominated by the Catholic Church and express misgivings about the country's laws against contraception and divorce, as well as book and film censorship. 
Within the past six months, the Catholic minority here has wholly rejected the Protestant Unionist government because of its policy of internment without trial the internment move, seekingto crush the outlawed Irish Republican army, has sparked the worst violence in Northern Ireland's history and led to a demand among Catholics for an end to the current government and possible unification with the Republic to the south. 
In his speech, Faulkner pointedly attacked Premier John Lynch of Ireland for his offer of money to the minority movement in Northern Ireland seeking to topple the Unionist government. The offer was made after the recent killing of 13 :~tl1olics during a civil rights march in Lodonderry. 
"We do not admire the petulant and bellicose utterances of its Oreland's) public figures on the world stage," said Faulkner. "We hold in small regard a government which makes available for use against us money for subversion or worse." 
"Above all," he said in a rising voice, "we are contemptuous of that state's behavior toward Northern Ireland. At one moment its leaders ap­pear to accept the principle of consent: at another to be prepared to ride on the back of terrorism." 
Faulkner appealed to Lynch to set aside the issue of a United Ireland "and lend his influence to the cause of a realistic settlement." 
"What is his real interest --Irish unity by any means, or at whatever cost, or peace in !Northern Ireland?" he demanded. 
Faulkner, a 51-year-old Presbyterian business man and former minister of development, added: "All political leaders of our community must decide very soon --for time is not unlimited --whether to dig still deeper trenches for a long and bloody struggle, or whether to show some real courage and generosity. 
"But I warn again: we are not to be coerced, and we will never surrender our destiny into the hands of the gunman or those who seek to profit from his activities." 
In recent months there have been rumors that the 
British government was drawing up plans that 
would seek to calm the alienated catholic minority 
in Northern Ireland internment and the Lon­
donderry killings have only deepened Catholic fury. 

The merger talks re-open today after two months of inactivity. There will be an official news blackout of the discussions. 
Notre Dame participants include Rev. James Burtchaell, University Provost, Rev. Edmund Joyce, Executive Vice-President, and Dr. Thomas Carney, chairman of the Trustee's Student Affairs Committee. 
St. Mary's College will be represented by Sister 
M. Gerald Hartney and P. Jordan Hamel of the Board of Trustees, Sr. Basil Anthony, Vice­President for Financial Affairs, and Dr. Mary Alice Cannon, Vice-President for Student Affairs. Ad­ditional members of the SMC delegation are Sr. Verda Clare Doran, Jason Lindower, director of financial management, and faculty members Sr. Maria C. McDermott and Dr. William Hickey.

Artificial brain? 
by Sandra Blakeslee 
<C> l!li2 New York Times 
Menlo Park, Calif., Feb. 8 --A team of California researchers has developed an experimental "artificial brain" that has been used to restore a variety of movements in the limbs of partly paralyzed monkeys. If extended to humans, the technique might help stroke victims overcome paralysis. 
A report of the scientists' work appears in the current issue of Stroke Magazine, a bimonthly medical journal published by the American Heart Association. Dr. Lawrence R. Pinneo of the Stanford Research Institutue here Jed the research effort. Coauthors of the report were Drs. Joel N. Kaplan and Edward A. Elpel of the Institute and Drs. Peter C. Reynolds and John H. Glick of Stanford Diversity School of Medicine. 
In an interview at his office on Monday, Pinneo said the "brain prosthesis," --or artificial or auxiliarybrain --serves the same purpose as does an artificial heart, lung or kidney. All are devices and techniques for replacing the functions of those organs lost, as a result of injury or disease. The researchers have not made an artificial "thinking" brain, but rather have learned how to replace a lost function of the brain by altering the function of the brain itself. 
Primates, including man, have a highly developed cortex or outer portion of the brain. Such voluntary motor activities as the ability to move an armor leg are directed from areas within the cortex. 
Efection merger still alive-Barlow 
by Jim McDermott 
Merger of the Notre Dame and St. Mary's student elections is far from dead, according to SMC Student Body President, Kathy Barlow. 
Barlow explained that the Notre Dame election com­mittee's rejection of proposals brought to them from the SMC Student Assembly was not definitely final -since both the Notre Dame and St. Mary's legislative bodies must approve the planned voluntary blocks of candidates. 
Under the block slate system, two sets of candidates would run together, one set to represent SMC, the other ND. According to Barlow, the SMC Assembly mandated their election com­mittee to treat Notre Dame and St. Mary's as one electorate for this year. Students would vote for one block of candidates under the SMC proposal. This would provide separate student body presidents and vice-presidents, but a common cabinet and legislature would be possible. 
Meeting Sunday night, the Notre Dame election committee opted for optional coalitions or blocks. 
Barlow commented that fur­ther co-operation between the student governments is a necessity. "Making the discussion hinge on merger of the institutions is irrelevant," she said. "The student bodies are already close geographically, and in activities. There are common interests in any case." 
She also noted the steps toward unification of governments that have been taken. Notre Dame students now sit on the SMC Sttudnet Assembly and cabinet. Since last spring, the Student Union has served both schools. 
When a stroke or injury occurs within the cortex, certain command areas are often knocked out and paralysis can result. 
What Pinneo wondered was whether there were other parts of the brain that could direct motor activities. That is, could another, deeper part of the brain take over the lost motor function? 
It was found that when sub­cortical structures of monkeys' brains were stimulated with electrodes, skeletal motor ac­tivity could indeed be prompted. Electrodes planted deep within the brain stem area --where commands from the cortex are normally integrated -­evoke movements foreleg, hind quarters muscles of the face.

Tw0 Halls 
What can you say about two South Quad residence halls that have been chosen to house women next year? Nothing much, except to express sympathy to the residents, wish them luck in finding new accomdations and chalk the whole thing off to "progress" at the Dome. 
No matter where the administrative fiat placed the incoming women there was bound to be outraged cries from the residents affected. Hall Life is a special thing at Notre Dame. Most people make their best friends from among the people that live around them. Most people have their best, and worst times with the friends they make in their residence hall. Most people don't like to move once they have established themselves.
·­
The residents of Badin Hall have made the right move. They realize 
that they are being asked to sacrifice something that means very much to them. They also realize that this sacrifice is for the good of the entire school and they are willing to cooperate. 
The unpleasant effects of the forced move could be partially mitigated if the office of Student Housing acts to allow blocs of residence to pick into sections in the various halls. 
Each hall determines it's own methods of room picks, and after setting 
aside a numb~! of r9oms for incoming freshmen, allows its residents to 1select remaining rooms according to a variety of schemes. Now, because 
of the impending eviction of the residents of Walsh and Badin, the rest of 
the halls on campus are going to be given a quota of people from these 
halls they have to admit. 
A good, fair method of effecting this transplant would be for Fr. Chambers, as Director of Student Housing, to have the halls set aside a bloc of rooms for incoming Walsh-Badin residents, if they request it. 
This won't solve all the problems. It won't be the same as allowing the 
students in Walsh and Badin to stay there. But it will help. If a group of 
people enjoy living together, have a good time together and don't want to 
be scattered then they should have the chance to reside in one section. 
The solution is a reasonable one and it could be enacted with minimal pain. The Director of Student Housing should do it and do it now. 

Gaal's bit 
John Gaal wants to do his bit for c~educa tion. He wants to do his bit by serving as St. Mary's Student Body Vice-Presidentfor a month. He wants to do his bit, but the St. Mary's Judicial Board, headed by Sue Welte, doesn't want to let him. 
The reasons they cite for disallowing Gaal's elections are good ones. For starters, Gaal is not a St. Mary's student, and the Governance Manual seems to clearly call for an SMC student to fill the post. That, coupled with the fact that Gaal was elected to his post by the Student Assembly and not the student body doesn't leave much factual support for his case. 
This affair is rather sad. It's sad because the St. Mary's Student Government has once again demonstrated it's willingness to begin a sort of merger with Notre Dame's Student Government, a beginning that ND's election committee rebuffed Sunday night. 
John Gaal should not be the SMC SBVP. St. Mary's and Notre Dame's Student Governments should not remain totally apart through the coming Student Body Elections. The two student legislative bodies--the Assembly and the Senate--can right both wrongs. We strongly suggest that they do so.

<The following was sent to the Observer late in November and was mislaid. Recently it came up and since we felt the message the writer was transmitting was pertinent, even at this late date, we decided to reprint it for the edification of our readers -ed.) 
It is truly regrettable to be speaking of cases and not of humans, at a time when the U. N. Declaration of Human Rights continues to be ignored in Pakistan, where human rights are still being violated daily. 
The authorities of the Piikistan Government have discarded all human values and have violated the elementary principle of right and justice through blowing up l)ouses, evictions, pressure and torture. So many pakistanis these days are living miserable lives and Mr. Geoffrey is living a life of luxury in the United States. Let us take a look at what the students of Notre Dame are doing for Pakistanis relief and what Mr. Geoffrey is doing for his own country. 
Before I go further, I want to ask Mr. Geoffrey who is saying that there is a discrimination at Notre Dame which is absolutely false-why he does not look back to his country to find the true discrimination. In fact, some people these days try to get things, but when they can't get them they try to invent excuses which are not true, like discrimination of color, religion and the country, as Mr. Geoffrey is doing now. 
You are saying, Mr. Geoffrey, that there is discrimination in hiring at Notre Dame; but what about the Pakistani Muslim professor in the Physics Department? You listed your qualifications as economist and management consultant; I think it is good for your knowledge to check with the Peace Corps to know how many U.S. citizens are in your country in these fields because you don-t serve your country or you are hoping to be wealthy in the U.S.A.; if your point or your aim in education is to get wealthy, I think your place is not here at Notre Dame, because education is not a business as you think, also as I have seen it here. The professors at Notre Dame are sharing their knowledge with their students and they are more receptive, assimilating and propagatiing the idealism, but you are not that type, therefore your place is not here. 

-..___ You listed your favorite job as dean or assistant dean. In fact, I can­t understand when they tell you there is no opening, why you still come back and say you want to be dean or assistant dean. Do you want them to dismiss somebody without any reason just to put you in his place to make you happy or to get wealthy, or do you want them to open a new department for you? 
Mr. Geoffrey, I want you to face the fact, there is a Muslim University (Al-Azhar University) in Cairo, Egypt for Muslims around the world. If we put a Christian in as the president of that University, what do you imagine will be the reaction of the Students? In the same way, you are seeking the application as the Muslim president of a Catholic College. It is not a question of discrimination, but of logic. I think that you have limited thinking and I am sorry to say that you use it to a selfish purpose, to get wealthy only. 
I want to assure you, Mr. Geoffrey, that there may be some who do smile in your face as you are trying to stand against Notre Dame, not because they love Muslims or foreigners, but becuase they hate Notre Dame and particularly the Catholics. Please be realistic and open your mind to see what you are doing before you fall down and don-t know what you did to yourself. 
Mr. Geoffrey, I think the better way is for you to go back to your country and serve there; and I want to remind you of the statement of 
J.F. Kennedy, ·"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country". 
Maybe some of my Muslim friends feel bad to hear me say this, but I want to remind you as a Muslim what our prophet Mohammed said, "If you see something wrong, try to change it by your hand; if you can't, by your tongue (through verbal persuasion) and this is the weakness of faith". What he is doing is the wrong thing, and since I cannot change it, I must at least speak the fact.

Indian troops to leave BanglclCJesh~ 
lc) 1!172 New York Times 
Calcutta, February 8-Prime Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Sheik Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh announced today agreement for the withdrawal of Indian troops from the new Bengali State at the end of this month. 
The two leaders, who met here for two days, made this disclosure in a statement signed yesterday and released today. 
The 900-word communique indicated that Sheik Mujib had expressed definite views on all the key subjects he discussed with Mrs. Gandhi in three sessions lasting five hours. In fact, according to official Indian sources, he did most of the talking. 
On the troop withdrawal, the statement said: 
"The Prime Minister of Bangladesh paid warm tribute to the armed forces of India and the part they played in the liberation of Bangladesh. The task having been completed,the two prime ministers felt that these armed forces should be withdrawn. The withdrawal of the Indian armed forces would be completed by March 25, 1972. 
According to Bangladesh sources, the suggestion for the withdrawal and the date set for it came from Sheik Mujib. The date would mark the first anniversary of the start of the Pakistani military repression in East Pakistan. The repression, which lasted nine months and involved the mass killing of Bengali nationalists, was ended when Indian troops marched into Dacca last December. 
Although the insurgent leadership declared Bangladesh independent soon after the surrender of Pakistani troops on

remained in the country, largely to maintain law and order and to help in the reconstruction of the shattered communications system. 
The Sheik, who returned to Dacca after his release from detention in West Pakistan less than a month ago, said that at a recent news conference that the Indian army would remain in Bangladesh as long as his country needed it. 
Both India and Bangladesh, embarrassed by Pakistani assertions that Indian troops are in Bangladesh as an occupation force, had agreed that the soldiers should be withdrawn as soon as possible. However, of­ficials in New Delhi had imagined that a total withdrawal would take several months. 
Bangladesh still lacks an effective police forcd and thousands of guerrillas roam the 
country seeking reprisals against former collaborators of the Pakistani army. 
There are about 40,000 Indian 
troops in Bangladesh. Their 
duties include the protection of 
the large communities of Bihari 
Moslems who continue to live in 
terror of reprisals. The Prime 
Minister has said that all of the 
Biharis are safe, but it is ap­
parent that at present their 
safety depends on Indian army 
protection. 
New Delhi had sought a formal 
agreement with Bangladesh that 
would have made the Indian 
military presence legitimate for 
any length of time. 
Cardinal knights Moose 
signed with Moscow last August, guaranteeing mutual support in the event of an external threat. 
Such a treaty was considered during the talks, but Sheik Mujib apparently felt that it would create an impression that Bangladesh was a vassal of In­dia.

Mardf Gras robbed again 


by John Abowd 
For the second year in a row an unidentified number of persons have stolen Mardi Gras carnival money from Stepan Center. The thieves took over $4,000 in bogus five dollar bills from the center on Sunday night, according to festival director Greg Stepic. 
The cash value of the hiested money is $2,000. The theives entered the building by breaking one of the fiberglass panes on the north end. Once inside, they pried an opening in the wire mesh of the coat check room and opened the door from the inside. 
All the bogus bills were stored in the room adjacent to the coat closet. The door between the rooms was unlocked. 
Bills used at the carnival last night and and in the upcoming sessions have been stamped. The bankers and dealers are not accepting any unstamped bills 
unless  the  bearer  has  been  
cleared  by  the  Mardi  Gras  
Committee.  

More on Hughes-Irving Story 
('ontinut>d from yesterday's l'dition. 
<c> 1!172 Nt>w York Times 
In the 1960 presidential cam­paign, Pearson said in his newspaper column that the Hughes Tool Co. had loaned $205,000 to F. Donald Nixon, the brother of Richard Nixon, who was then running for president. 
The "autobiography" 
manuscript is made up of 
questions purportedly posed by 
Irving and answers purportedly 
given by Hughes. 
After Hughes is quoted as 
saying he had allowed Pearson to 
learn of the purported loan, the 
manuscript reads: 
"Irving: How did that 
happen?" 
"Howard: Can't you rut two 
and two together?" 
"Irving: 1 want to hear it in 
your words." 
"Howard: Well, I got someone to whisper it to Mr Pearson's ear, where to look, And Mr. Peason looked and Mr. Pearson finds ­found. The Bible says, "Seek and ye shall find." And then it hit the front pages of all the newspapers in the country. Television people had their say, too. Now whether it actually turned the tide of the election or not, I don't know." 
At another point in that ex­change, Hughes is quoted as saying, "I've never played the role of kingmaker. I never saw myself as the power behind the scenes in Washington, but I did my bit. Every businessman needs frineds in high places." 
Sources who have read it said the manuscript continually returned to discussions of mat­ters that are in bad taste for public discussion, "such as stories of sexual exploits, or that are libelous accounts of events in which Hughes is widely known to have had some role years ago. 
At another point, Irving pur­portedly asked Hughes about the time l''rank Sinatra, the singer, was knocked down by an em­ployee of the Sands Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. That exchange follows: 
"Howard: Well, Carl Cohen did more than I expected of him, he pasted him in the mouth ... that's the last we've heard of him in connection with Hughes Hotels. 
"Irving: But why? Was there any conflict between you and Sinatra?" 
"Howard: No conflict at all, I always felt Sinatra was beneath any particular consideration of mine. What is he after all? He owns nothing to speak of out there. We had no business dealings. He was just taking advantage of my prestige to bolster his waning prestige." 
At another point, the purported dialogue brings in the name of Hobert A. Maheu, who managed Hughes' enterprises in Nevada for four years until he was dismissed in 1970. The excerpt follows: 
"Irving: : 0 .K. Tell me so that we can get it on tape about Maheu. 
"Howard: You want the background on it?" 
"Irving: Yes." 
"Howard: As I said, he was an F.B.I.agent. He had been with 'he F.B.I. untill946 or 7, I think ust after the war. Then he got me of those public relations 'irms in Washington. Well, it was Jublic relations on the surface, 
but what it really was doing was weeding out industrial espionage and ferreting out secrets in Washington and lobbying a bit. Maheu's a snooper. A very competent guy. Hale fellow well met on the surface. Underneath a very icy, calculating man <Here followed a series of uncomplimentary remarks) 
"Irving: He's not a mormon?" 
"Howard: No, for awhile I thought I might have made a mistake there in not hiring a mormon for this job. Dull as they are. Later on I find out that they're not just dull, they're as tricky as anybody else. And I had bad luck with Bob Maheu." 
Maheu's career is well-known and details would easily be available to anyone who wanted to write that paragraph and attribute it to Hughes, sources pointed out. The unpleasant characterizations attributed to Hughes about Maheu would logically fit the mood of a man sued for $50 million by a former employee, as Hughes has been sued by Maheu. 
At another Point, Hughes' well­known penchant for calling people at odd hours is brought into the manuscript as follows: 
"Irving: Let's go on. That business about you calling people at 4 o'clock in the morning and getting the truth out of them because they're sleeping and dazed. Do you remember any specific instances that you can tell me? 
"Howard: I remember several. "Yeah, I'll tell you one. This was a very important one, it just so happened, and in a way it led to my realizing that Noah Deitrick had to go." 
This was lollowed, all at­tributed to Hughes, who has frequently been described as resentful of talk about his women friends, by a long section full of talk of sexual exploits in Hollywood in the nineteen­thirties and nineteen-forties. 
Deitrich, who worked for Hughes for about 32 years also was dismissed, as was Maheu. Dietrich's experiences with Hughes for about 32 years also was dismissed, as was Maheu. Dietrich's experiences with Hughes are recounted in a book called "Howard," to be published at the end of the month. 
One of the stories told to

tempted to cash in all the stolen bills at once. 
Stepic said that he did not report the incident to South Bend police because "last year's reports and fingerprinting didn't help us." 
The carnival profitted $5,000 on its opening night with $2,000 of this money coming from ad­mission charges. Over $14,000 in raffle revenue has also been collected. 
Gamblers and fun seekers can still enjoy the festival on Thur­sday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The carnival will open at 7:00 in the evening every day except Sunday. One o'clock is the opening time for the fair's last day.

CanaCa-easing tension 
by Tom Drape 
"'· ~nadian Senate Leader and prominent statesman Paul Martin, said Monday night that Canada is "actively seeking an easing of tensions in an effort of world peace." 
He justified recent. , un­precedented Canadian contacts with Communist countries and present Canadian economic and domestic feelings.
.. 

Paul Martin 
Martin's lecture entitled, "Canada and Her Mighty Neigh­bors," was hosted by the Notre Dame Institute for International Studies at the Center for Con­tinuing Education. 
A former president of NATO, Canadian foreign minister, longstanding political figure in Canada and presently, Leader of the Government in the Senate, Mr. Martin elaborated on changing Canadian foreign policies. · Immediately recognizing the recent change in Canadian feelings toward Communist countries and the subsequent concern of it's powerful, con­tinental neighbor, the U.S., Martin likened present tensions to those of the Cold War and expressed that Canada hoped such actions would help to ease them. 
In pursuit of this goal, Canada voted for the recognition of the People's Republic of China last year and received Russian Foreign Minister Alex Kosygin for a tour of Canadian Cities last October, he claimed. 
Mr. Martin was Kosygin's
personal guide and related a
basic difference, which he discussed with Kosygin, as being 
a  religious  idea  between  the  
Communist  countries  and  the  
West.  

In justifying Canada's chang~d attitude toward the Commurust Bloc, Martin also brought to mind the changing attitude of our own country. He cited President Nixon's upcoming visit to China at the end of this month and our decision to allow China ad­mittance to the U.N: Security Council. 
He complimented Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk on his efforts while in office and mostly on the greatness of Mr. Rusk's character. "Those who misread these decisions and individual efforts, do violence to all whom are seeking peace." 
The main relation between Canada, he claimed, and the United States is trade. Mr. Martin expressed great concern about the way that Canada's diversified trading reputation has been concentrated. Economically Canada depends upon the U.S. far more than their second and third traders, the Commonwealth and Japan. He cited the fact that Canadians are almost solely concerned with trading relation with the U.S. 
~~------~------------~~--------------­
while Americans, on the other hand, remain relatively non­chalant. 
"The United States' percentage of export of their Gross National Product is 4 percent. Of that 4 percent, Canada purchases one fourth of it." Martin went on to cite that two--thirds of Canada's exports go to the U.S. 
Martin commented that Canada is suspicious that the United States is after her raw materials rather than manufactured goods, the export
of which are critical to Canadian 
· d

capita an consumer con­
sumption.
The Commonwealth and Japan are also suspected of such in­tents. If this becomes the case, 
Mr. Martin added, Canada would thus be forced to turn to those who do need manufactured ex­ports, most probably Communist and Non-Commonwealth coun­tries. 
"This is not to say that we are anti-American. Nothing can ever replace our alliance with the U.S.," Mr. Martin added firmly. He explained that each would have to pursue their independent foreign and domestic courses in order to have a positive and constructive value for peace in the world. 
Domestically, Canada is protective of its raw materials which, according to Martin, become more important with the evolvement of time. 
When questioned concerning the Continental Energy policy, Mr. Martin replied that as of now, no official stand has been for­mulated but that any resource tapped would have to have been scientifically qualified as in abundance. Proposed pipelines from Alaska through Canada were also mentioned with Mr. Martin replying that likewise no decisions had been met.
