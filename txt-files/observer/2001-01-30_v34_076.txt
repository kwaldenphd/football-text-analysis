INSIDE COLUMN 

Superbowl's most valuable liar 
I can only say I was completely disgusted by CBS studio host Jim Nance in the Superbowl post-game interviews Sunday night especially in regards to the stance he took in the pregame show. 
After a piece about Ravens middle linebacker Ray Lewis who was accused of a double murder the night of the Superbowl last year, Nance and the rest of the CBS studio team discussed why Lewis was still facing 


questions about his role in the murders in Atlanta. Mike Connolly Although Lewis was 
acquitted, many reporters and much of the general Editor in Chief public doesn't believe that 
Lewis is completely innocent of the crime. 

The biggest reason for the lack of trust in Lewis is his conviction for obstruction of justice. Although most of the evidence shows that Lewis did not stab the two men that night, it also shows that he probably does know who did kill those men. Although Lewis was acquitted on murder charges, he was convicted of obstruction of jus-. tice. 
This leads me to wonder ... why would an innocent man who knows nothing about the murder of two men, obstruct justice? The obvi­ous answer is that Lewis knows exactly who killed those men and he has been lying for months to protect his friends. 
Nance pointed this out very sharply in the pregamc show. He took a strong stance and expressed exactly why very few people trust Ray Lewis. Nobody trusts Ray Lewis because Lewis was convicted of trying to prevent justice from being served. I can think of few lower crimes than stopping two grieving families from receiv­ing the justice they deserve. 
Despite Nance's powerful pregame words. he turned into a ball of jelly at the postgame inter­view. Rather than continuing his pointed criti­cism of the now-Superbowl MVP Hay Lewis, Nance let Lewis get away with giving the same­old "what a storybook ending" garbage he has been spouting for months. 
I would love to know what kind of warped story books Lewis is reading his 3-year-old son. Nance had the chance on the national stage to put Lewis on the spot. to ask the questions that he has been avoiding for months and finally make him account for his lying and doubletalk. Instead he let Lewis shirk responsibility for his actions yet again. 
While Lewis celebrates his Superbowl victory with his teammates. the families of the two vic­tims have little to celebrate and live a nightmare as the killers remain at large. Lewis knows what happens. He needs to stop dodging the truth and bring the killers to justice -even if they are his friends. 
For all Lewis' "storybook ending" posturing, however, he didn't get invited to the land of fairy­tales. Disneyworld usually asks the Superbowl MVP to make a 'Tm going to Disneyworld" ad after the game. Lewis, however, was not chosen for this honor and instead Ravens quarterback Trent Diller is "going to Disneyworld."

Murders of tWo professors shocks community 

HANOVER, N.H. 

News of the murders of two Dartmouth College professors sent shock waves through the College and the local community as law enforcement officials continued their investigation, releasing few details about the tragedy. 
Autopsies performed Sunday by the state's chief medical examiner on the bodies of Susanne and Half Zantop confirmed homicide as the cause of death, New Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin said. 
In a 4 p.m. news conference held Sunday at the Hanover police sta­tion, McLaughlin said the state cur­rently has no one in custody, and he would not comment on any possible motives for the murders. 
McLaughlin also declined to com­ment on any details of the homi­cides or how the bodies were found for fear of compromising the ongo­ing investigation, which is being led by the state police's major crimes

JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY 
Protesters burn flags to spark debate 
HARRISONBURG, Va. 
Wednesday's flag-burning protest has evoked strong reactions and lots of discussion across campus. Some felt the demonstrators were doing it solely to get attention, others were left confused, and some took up the issue surrounding symbolic freedom of speech. Burning the American flag is a constitutional right, held up by the 1989 United States Supreme Court case Texas vs. Johnson. The Supreme Court ruled that burning the flag is protected under the First Amendment as a form of free speech. Even though students recognized the legali­ty of the act, many said they didn't agree with it. "They wanted people to hear them and see them, they got that. All they really wanted was publicity," senior Hina Ansari said. But others felt burning the flag should not be used as an attention getter. "We were interested in trying to get people to talk ... The point was not to spark a First Amendment debate but to spark a debate about the state of affairs or our government," said sophomore Tim Westberg, one of the demonstrators.

McLaughlin said the person who found the bodies had a "perfectly good reason" to be at the Zantop residence, but would not identify that person. The police were alerted of the deaths by 6:48 p.m., accord­ing to the attorney general. 
Three independent sources con­firmed that the bodies were discov­ered Saturday around 6 p.m. by Roxana Verona, an associate pro­fessor of French and Italian lan­guages and close friend of the deceased. Verona said that she had been invited to the house for dinner. 
Verona confirmed that she was the first to find the Zantops. She declined to comment on what she saw because she said the police told her it could compromise the investi­gation. 

RUTGERS UNIVERSITY 
Faculty fight for rights of gay couples 
NEW BHUNSWlCK, N.J. 

The university senate passed a resolution to support full health benefits for same-sex partners of Hutgers University employees and retirees last Friday. The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Rutgers attended the open meeting, handing senators letters addressing the issue. "The back of every Rutgers University applica­tion clearly states: 'It is university policy to make the ben­efits and services of its education program available to students without discrimination on the basis of race, reli­gion, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual ori­entation, disability, marital or veteran status,"' according to the letter from the Alliance. The Alliance pointed out the absence of such a policy for faculty, retirees and their partners in the letter. Domestic same-sex partners receive about three-fifths of the number of benefits that the spouses of heterosexual university employees receive. Since New Jersey does not directly supply same-sex part­ner health benefits, the university has established its own plan.

be held on the Saint Mary's 
campus. 

The feedback from the ballot 
initiative would then be used 
to guide BOG in its next steps. 

"I think that we would get 
the information back from the 
initiative. talk about it, collab­
orate with the administration 
and go from there," said 
Kahn. 

Veronica Kessenich, Saint 
Mary's representative to the 
Notre Dame Senate, suggested 
having a forum for Saint 
Mary's students to be held the 
week after the Keenan Revue 
as another opportunity to 
gather information regarding 
student opinion of the Revue. 

"l think a lot more discus­
sion will occur after the Revue 

and maybe after students have 
had a chance to see it," said 
Kessenich. "The forum would 

provide another opportunity 
for people to voice their opin­
ions on the Revue." 

Michelle Nagle, student body 
vice president encouraged all 
members of BOG to attend the 
Revue. 

"It's important that all of us attend so that we can say that we've seen the Revue and that ·we can make an educated decision regarding the Revue if called upon to do so," said 
Nagle. 

Vagina Monologues debated 

The. administration's deci­sion not to allow the play, "The Vagina Monologues" to be performed this year at 
Saint Mary's was also dis­cussed. 
Women's Issues Commissioner Julie Frishkorn provided background to the Board regarding the contro­versy. 
Kessenich questioned whether BOG should take a stand on the College's decision to cancel the play. 
"I don't know what should be done. but I think that if we are going to make a decision and take a stand regarding the Keenan Revue which is a satirical, farcical and some­times not very funny play being put on our campus, then we need to ask why we haven't been asked to play a role in making the decision about this nationally acclaimed play that addresses numerous important issues, particularly women's issues that is being denied being per­formed on this campus," said Kessenich. 
Emily Koelsch, member of the Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination board that wants to sponsor the "Monologues" said that although the admin­istration has said that I.he play couldn't be performed at Saint Mary's, it would be helpful to have the BOG take a stand regarding the administration's decision. 
"I think that it is worth hav­ing a student-led organization like BOG telling the adminis­tration their opinion about sit­uations like the 'Monologues,"' said Koelsch. "I don't think students can ever express their opinions to the adminis­tration too much on issues like this even if the administration has already said 'no."' 

Koelsch said CARE is trying to set up a meeting with College President Marilou Eldred. 
"We want to sit down with Dr.Eldred this week to discuss where things can go from here," said Koelsch. "We need to know for sure yes or no if this can happen, what her position is on the play. and if there is any flexibility in the decision the administration has made." 
Nagle asked whether there would be other events addressing issues of sexuality taking place on campus in lieu of the ''Monologues." 

Frishkorn said that CARE. plans to bring in speakers as scheduled and other activities but right now the group is still focusing their efforts on the "Monologues."

Earthquake claims up to 20,000 
Associated Press 
BHUJ 
Kusumben Myacha lay for three days pinned under a massive chunk of cement. without food or water, drifting in and out of sleep. She prayed to her Hindu gods to be saved. 
No one heard her screams until the 
stillness of the second night. At day­
break Sunday, rescuers began a 
frantic race to dig her out from under 
the rubble of the once seven-story 
apartment building. 
Myacha, a mother of two in her mid-30s, was pulled free as night fell. People wept as they saw her emerge. She had survived longer buried than anyone so far from Friday's devastat­ing earthquake in western India. 
But the tales of dramatic rescues have become fewer as hopes faded Monday of finding any more people alive al'ter three cold nights. By offi­cial count, the 7.9 magnitude quake had killed 6,181 people in the indus­trial state of Gujarat. and the state's chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, said the toll could go as high as 20,000. 
Tremors lasting up to 30 seconds continued to shake India on Monday panicking residents, but no new damage was reported. A magnitude 
4.3 quake was centered 21 miles from Bangalore, a city 850 miles southeast of the epicenter of Friday's quake near Bhuj. 
Survivors on Monday complained that confusion and a lack of equip­ment was hampering rescue efforts. Rescuers lacked cranes and bulldoz­ers, and many units did not even have generators. making night work impossible without lights. Soldiers hunting for survivors began work at first light and stopped when the sun went down. 
Clearly overwhelmed by the disas­ter, the government said Sunday it would ask for a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for reconstruc­tion.

TANZANIA 

18 dead in clashes with police forces 
A.!sociated Press 
ZANZIBAH 
Police on Monday defended the killing of at least 18 demonstrators in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar, saying the civilians attacked them with machetes. bows and gasoline bombs. 
"Police stations were about to be overrun and taken over. and the lives of police officials, their families and civilians in general were in danger," said Laurean Tibasana, a national police commissioner. 
One police officer was beheaded 
with machetes. scores of people were injured and 187 were arrested during the violence on Friday and Saturday. Eleven protesters died in Pemba. Zanzibar's northern island. and seven died on the main island of Unguja. 
The violence began when police used tear gas and live ammunition to try to disperse hundreds of demon­strators from the Civic United Front opposition party. The protesters were demanding reform of Zanzibar's elec­toral commission, fresh elections and a new constitution for the United Republic of Tanzania and Zanzibar. 

Before the demonstrations, police had said they would consider the protests illegal. On Sunday, senior Civic United Front oflicial Nassor Seil' said 24 people had died, including the policeman. 
Tibasana said police were only aware of 18 dead but said it was pos­siblo some of the injured had died at home and were buried immediately. Under Muslim tradition, the dead arc usually buried within 24 hours. 
Police believe the armed crowds wanted to seize guns and ammuni­tion in the police stations, Tibasana said.

ROTC 
continued from page I 
country has laid mostly dor­mant since Vietnam. But at Notre Dame, it resurfaces regularly, brought up by activists inspired by Catholic pacifism. At times, the dia­logue on campus has been heated, but, unlike some schools in the 1960s, Notre 
Dame  has  never  seen  its  
ROTC  building  go  up  in  
flames.  

These days, most students accept the military training program as a fact of life at Notre Dame. ROTC students are like everyone else, and everyone knows a few of them. There's not much to think about, as Notre Dame has the ROTC established as a solid program. 
Pax Christi hopes to change that. 
That is where the dialogues come in. The point of these discussions, at least at pre­sent, is not to rally opposition to ROTC, but to provide a forum for the two sides to come together and talk. There have been two this year, with another scheduled for Wednesday night. 
But opening dialogue has been a challenge. 
For understandable rea­sons, many in the military program have been suspi­cious of Pax Christi. a group which was founded two years ago essentially to challenge ROTC's existence at Notre Dame. They have brought several anti-military speakers to campus, and sponsored a lecture in April detailing "10 reasons why ROTC should be banned from Notre Dame's campus." The lecture was seen by many in the program as an attack, and it fueled doubts about the peace group. 
"Things Pax Christi has done in the past has put bar­riers there." sophomore Andrew DeBerry, an Air Force cadet who is also involved with Pax Christi. 
"When you do that and then try to communicate with someone. you immedi­ately have a hostile environ­ment." 
The first dialogue this year was done differently. Shawn Storer of Pax Christi, shared the podium with Marine cadet Joe Zilligan, and the two compared two different Church teachings on war ­Christian Pacifism and Catholic Just War Theory. Afterwards, the large audi­ence split up into small groups -each a mix of future officers, peace activists and those in the middle -to discuss the issue. Leaders of the peace group call the talks a big success. 
"They really have blown my mind away," Peters said. "Seeing all these people talk­ing and really struggling with these issues." 
Students are not the only people struggling together with these issues. Once each month, the officers who run Notre Dame's four ROTC pro­grams have lunch with pro­fessors from the Peace Studies program. Their dis-
Two Perspectives 
In the Catholic Church, there are 
two philosophies about the use 
of force. 
. Christian Pacifism 
Violence is never acceptable as 
a wy to achieve one's goals. 
Jesus Christ was peaceful, and 
we should follow his example. 
. Just War Theory 
Violence is acceptable under 
certain conditions, such as non­
combatant immunity and vio­
lence in proportion to the goals 
of the war, if it will lead o a 
greater good. 
cussion ranges from current 
events to philosophical 
debates about the use of 
force. The different sides 
don't always agree, but they 
all say the sessions are 
worthwhile. 
"I think they're of great 
value to all of us," Edwards 
said. "The people from the 
Peace Institute give us a pret­
ty different perspective to 
look from but we make a 
pretty big contribution. too." 
In recent years, prayer a:nd 
discussion have been the pri­
mary weapons of the anti­
military movement on cam­
pus. Pax Christi members 
have talked, and, now, some­
times to their surprise, ROTC 
cadets are talking back. As 
their dialogue continues, both 
sides hope, more people will 
listen.

Pill bottles 'talk' to, help elderly 
A.<1ociatcd Preu 
WAS! l!NGTON 

Thr. man squints at his med­ication, but his dimming vision can't make out r.ven whether hi\ picked up lh11 Coumadin or Celcbrox. So he aims a gadget tho size of a dock of cards at thn bottle, and a computerized voice begins reading his prc­scri ption instructions. 
Call them talking drugs: If pilot testing goes well at two Chicago hospitals, blind and elderly /\mcricans could soon btgin buying prnscriptions with "smart labels" that read aloud the potentially lifesaving fine print. 
Millions of Americans have !lycsight so bad they can't read newspaper type, and th us struggle with medication bot­tks that put tho drug's name, dosage and important safety warnings in even smaller print. 
It's a problem that's only going to worsen as the aging population booms. 
Inabilily to read pill bottles can lead to very dangerous mistakes: taking the wrong pill at the wrong time; or tho wrong dose; or missing the warning not to drink alcohol or take various over-the-counter drugs with the prescription. Or even when to call a doctor about side effects. 
Enter ScripTalk. Heam a 
small voice synthesizer at a 
prescription botLlo with a spe­
cial computer chip embedded 
into the label. The wireless 
wchnology translates the print­
c d label into speech, literally 
niading aloud the pill instruc­

"Our major goal. and what these systems would allow, is greater inde­pe n dr. n ce," adds Jerry Schutter. chief' of blind rehabil­itation services at Hines. 
Hines so far has taught a dozen veterans to use ScripTalk at home. Some "are very happy with it," Schutter said. Olhers, usually the very elderly, still prefer family mem­bers to read their pill bottles to them. 
The pilot test isn't over yet, but will help determine if ScripTalk provides enough ben­efit for the VA to offer it once sales begin. 
ScripTalk isn't the only such attempt: Hines also has a hand­ful of veterans testing New York-based Asko Corp.'s Aloud, where pharmacists record drug labels into listening devices for patients. ScripTalk. in contrast, harnesses wireless technology to let computers synthesize the talking label automatically. 
Rush's planned 300-patient 
study. which also will investi­
gate low-tech solutions such as 
larger-print drug labels, will 
"smart 
labels." Each drugstore would have to buy a special $1,000 printer that encodes the microchip to road each label once it's print­ed. 
Patients would buy a battery­oporaled ScripTaJk reader, for about $250, that works on any smart-labeled pill bottle. A talking label initially should add $1 to each prescription, a price that would drop as more were sold, En-Vision says. 
At Hines, pharmacists had to write special software so the ScripTalk printer could road the VA's patient prescription records. a link retail pharma­cies may have to figure out, too. 
But En-Vision, which has begun pitching ScripTalk to drugstore chains and insurers, says don't forget one big bene­fit: Not every drugstore will sell talking prescriptions, so those that do could gain instant loyal clientele among the millions of vision-impaired patients. 
The technology could be 
modified to help people who 
can't read labels.

"Young girls are not going to be given proper advice by a busy phar­macist with a queue of cus turners,'' said Baroness Young, sponsor of the move to restrict distribution lo doctors only. 
On Friday, an Internet site backed out of plans to provide the pills by mail after requests from the Department of Health and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Superdrug, the phar­macy chain that operates the site, said it would await the outcome of Monday's parlia­mentary debate. 
Taken within 72 hours of intercourse, the "morning­after" pill prevents pregnancy by blocking the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus or causing an implanted embryo to be expelled. Anti­abortion groups claim it amounts to abortion. 
The drug is available over the counter in a number of European ·countries. including France and Norway, and has been sold by prescription in the United States since 1998. 
Since the introduction of early versions of the drug in Britain in the 1980s, more than 4 million women have taken emergency contracep­tion, and British studies have shown no serious side eITects, although some women experi­

The "morning-after" pill is available in two versions in Britain: Levonelle-2, a high­dose progesterone pill, and Schering PC4, a combined estrogen-progesterone pill, and costs $30. It is only avail­able to women over 16, tho legal age of consent. 
By law, pharmacists must discuss side effects with a patient and ensure she is not already pregnant or suffering from blood prnssure problems or diabetes. 
Young expressed concern about an investigation by the Newcastle Journal newspapnr in which a 14-year-old girl obtained the drug at two phar­macies. 
A pharmacist "is not allowed 
to c0nsult the girl's (doctor), so 
he will have no access to her

Young told reporters before

Iam glad to get this question. To doubr one's faith is common and a natural product of the human faculty of questioning and resting ideas in order to arrive at the truth.

in love, however, is not just a good example of something that we believe in without being able to quantify it. Falling in love is a glimpse of the divine in human life. It opens us up to a whole world beyond our merely physical material world. It opens us up to mystery, and wonder, and the irreducible universe of the spiritual. St. John says that God is Love. To fall in love then is to experience a bit of how God must feel coward us, and it inspires us toward loving God and all that God loves, as well. Ir has been said that faith is the knowledge born of love.

One of the hot toys this Christmas was Death Row Marv, a 6-inch doll complete with "chair, wired helmet ... and ... switch." Marv can move his neck, torso and arms. For $23.95. the ad urges the targeted 13-year olds to "[flee! the burn as the electric buzz fills the room and he starts to shake and convulse. Experience the pain as the shak­ing continues and his eyes start to glow bright red. Enjoy the torment." As columnist Michelle Malkin noted, more than 65,000 were sold and there were "waiting lists across the coun­try." 
What brought this to mind was the media frenzy building toward Timothy McVeigh's May 16 execution at the Terre Haute federal prison. McVeigh abandoned his appeals on his convic­tion of blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168, including 19 children and injuring more than 500. The government has written to 1,100 survivors and relatives of victims asking if they want to attend the execution. A closed-circuit telecast is under consideration. Hotel rooms in Terre Haute were solidly booked within hours of the order setting the date. 
Is not the death penalty justified here? Are not all possible objections removed by McVeigh's choice to sub­mit? The answer is "no" on both counts. McVeigh's acceptance of the government's decision to kill him does not avoid the question: Does the gov­ernment have the right to make that decision? 
The state. which derives its authority from God, has authority to impose the death penalty, but it can do so only "if this is the only possible way of ... defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. If ... non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and pro­tect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with ... the common good and ... the dignity of the human person. Today, ... as a con­sequence of the possibilities which the state has for ... rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm without definitively taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself the cases in which 

... execution ... is an absolute necessity are very rare if not practically non­existent," from Catechism, number 2,267. 
That penalty cannot be justified as a means to retribution or to the general protection of society by deterring other offenders. Rather it must be absolutely necessary to protect other lives from this convicted criminal. The govern­ment is not so lacking in security facili­ties that McVeigh's execution is a mat­ter of "absolute necessity" because "it would be the only possible way" of defending other lives from him. The alternative to executing McVeigh is life without parole, which can be as oner­ous as execution. As the Denver Post editorialized: "Death by lethal injection would be too quick and easy." 
The death penalty, especially in a case like this, is a deceptive quick-fix that distracts attention from basic problems. As Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver, said in opposing the McVeigh sentence, "Capital punishment is just another drug we take to ease other, much deeper anxieties about the direction of our culture. Executions may take away some of the symptoms for a time (symptoms who have names and their own stories before God), but 
the underlying illness ­ today's con­ 
tempt for human life ­ remains and  
grows worse."  

The death penalty kills the guilty rather than the innocent. However, as with abortion and euthanasia, mass bombing of civilians in Kosovo, etc., it reflects an acceptance of the intention al infliction of death as an optional problem-solving technique. 

There is cause for concern, more over, when the killing of a human being becomes a media event which will cater to the voyeurism characteristic of our culture of death. Video games, rap music and other amusements have accustomed many, especially the young, to seek pleasure in portrayals of the infliction of pain and even of death, on others. Death Row Marv is the poster boy of such a culture. 
Cain was a more notorious murderer even than McVeigh. Yet God put a mark on Cain, "to protect ... him from those wishing to kill him ... Not even a murderer loses his personal dignity ... God, who preferred the correction rather than the death of a sinner, did not desire that a homicide be punished by ... another ... homicide," qutoed from Evangelium Vitae, number 9. 
"All together," said John Paul, "we must build a new culture of life ... The first ... step (is] forming consciences with regard to the ... inviolable worth of every human life," from Evangelium Vitae, numbers 95 and 96. 
Because man is immortal and made in the image and likeness of God, all human persons have a dignity that transcends the power of the state. 
In his challenge to our pagan culture of death, John Paul insists that God ­not the individual and not the state ­is in charge of the ending as well as the beginning of life. Moreover, our "free­dom ... P.ossesses an inherently rela­tional dimension" because "God entrusts us to one another." from Evangelium Vitae number 19.· Therefore, "every man is his 'brother's keeper."' Even if his brother, like Cain -or Timothy McVeigh -is a murder­er.

Leaders of America's left fall to flaws 
SALT I.AKE CITY, Utah 

If you enter the .I. Willard Marriott Library through the east doors on the third level and immediately proceed up the stairs to your left, you will see a statue of Icarus. lie is a creature from Greek mythology who new too high

ly close to the sun, 
the wax melted 
and Icarus tumbled to the Earth. 
The other day I paid Icarus a visit. i\ftcr hearing the news of Rev. Jesse Jackson's affair with former staffer Karin Stanford. I felt the image of this figure, frozen in his fall from grace, was particularly poignant. 
There are myriad angles to this story, all of them heartbreaking. Jackson betrayed his wife of 38 years. For Jackie Jackson, one wonders how many other affairs her husband has had. The two are still married, but the level of anguish or rage that festers deep inside is something only she knows. 
Inevitably, some will choose to por­tray the continuing marriage as merely a public and poliHcal face saving arrangement, as many have said of the Clintons. Again. only the Jacksons can know lhe true meaning of their mar­riage. 
Love is tixtrcmely hard to come by. so much so that some never lind it. But for those who sincerely love each other. only they can know the vitality or vacancy of their bond. 
lior the live Jackson children. there must also exist a tremendous contra­diction of feelings and conllict of emo­tions, all aggravated by an unsatisfying search for elusive answers. 
Of course..Jesse Jackson now has six children. This issue of how his 20­month-old daughter, born out of wed­lock, will come to know her father is as pressing as the question of how her mother will deal with this firestorm. 
Just as disconcerting as the dynam­ics of family arc those of faith ­.Jackson is a reverend and has a flock of followers. Each must reconcile in his or her own way the discrepancy between Jackson's words and his actions. 
hope that even Jackson's strongest opponents would feel compassion for the human side of these events. I am certain some conservatives are over­joyed. People like Rush Limbaugh and 
G. Gordon Liddy probably feel vindicat­ed, and I shudder to imagine the vitri­olic rants spewing from their mouths in regard to Jackson's current situa­tion. 
Coming on the heels of Bill

tragic for what it 
means in a more gen­
eral scope. These events are painful in the eyes of the 
people Jackson 
speaks for. Young

cursed with some tragic flaw that causes them to betray the trust of 
their believers. Contrast Clinton with conservative leaders like Ronald Reagan and George 
W. Bush. No sane person would place the latter two on the intel­lectual level of the former. 
Yet Reagan always kept things simple, surrounding him­

Clinton rendered himself a lame duck, Jackson has also likely forfeited his political clout. And thus, a generation of liberal leaders is lost in a time when we most need them. 
The recent conservative trend in this country has been in play since 1968 and is shifting the entire paradigm to the right. Too often the questions have changed from "!low much aid should the government provide?" to "Should the government provide aid at all?" 
The rise of this conservative era was ignited in part by the fall of another tragic liberal leader, Lyndon Johnson. Unlike many Republican presidents. Johnson tried to do too much, heaping the Great Society, the Vietnam War and the weight of the world upon his own shoulders. 
The impact of Johnson's crash to the ground is still being felt in the ranks of the left. 
Beyond Johnson, there were no able torchbearers. With the murder of John Kennedy, Hobert Kennedy and Martin Luther King within live years of each other. there was simply no one remaining to lead the left. In contrast. the current generation of liberal lead­ers seems to be killing itself off with its own stupidity. 
So far, the story of Icarus hasn't meant enough to those who lead the way for the political left. Perhaps the next generation of liberal leaders will learn from Jackson's mistakes. 
If not, we are doomed to repeat this pattern of fallen angels and risen dev­ils.

The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not neces­sarily those of The Observer. 
The struggles Jackson represents. the stories he speaks on behalf of. are things the current stock of powerhold­ers will probably never understand. And when leaders like Jackson fall, sometimes there just isn't anyone left to pick up the pieces. 
lieyond the civil rights struggle, Jackson's fall is significant in terms of what it may do to the left in general. 
It is no secret that Jesse Jackson has plenty of enemies. And while I would self with shrewd and able operatives. 
Bush is doing the same by selecting a Cabinet of demigods and keeping his messages to the American people in the form of the lowest common denom­inator. Conservatives succeed by pro­jecting a paternalistic moral leadership that, although fabricated, feels real to the American people. 
While the left may have better ideas. its leaders squander opportunities amidst personal intrigue. Just as

ALBUM REVIEW 
Lifehouse surprises critics with No Name Face 
By LISA BRUNO 
Scene Music Critic 
This review did not turn oul the way it was supposed to. It was supposed to be a simple article in which Llfehouse's debut release, No Name Face. rece.ives a lack­luster review for seeming to fol­low in the footsteps of the likes of the overplayed Creed. But it did not work out that way. 
In actuality, this disc is very good, and doesn't cause the same cringing one associates with hav­ing to hear yet another Creed track. 
Ufehouse begins to achieve the seemingly impossible feat of standing out amidst the music that is produced in bulk these days. 
Let's begin with a word about what this disc is not. No Name Face is not the kind of album that once it has been purchased, the buyer soon realizes that just about the only good thing about it is its radio-friendly single. in Lhis case, "Hanging by a Moment." Instead, these 12 tracks offer con­sistently good music and lyrics. Buyer's remorse does not come along with this purchase. 
So who and what is Ufehouse anyway? Lifchouse is a young, 20-something, Los Angeles-based group that lived its music -and character -building past in a California garage. The band's style could be described as diet-rock; all the taste, but without all the calorics. 

Fans will be hard-pressed to find reviews of the band lacking a comment about frontman, Jason Wade. First of all, he could quite easily land a day job as a model, and more importantly. because he has a wonderfully deep and raspy voice that is reminiscent of many other lead vocalists, yet dis­tinctly his own. His voice fits emo­tions of the lyrics all the better because he writes them himself. 
No Name Face opens with the familiar track, "Hanging by a Moment," which found itself in the No. 1 position on Billboard's Modern Rock only 10 weeks after the album's release. The follow­ing 11 tracks continue down the same path. 
There are, however, some rest stops along the way as the band slows down for some more melodic tracks such as "Trying" and the soon to be a hit, "Breathing." 
The depth and greatness of Wade's voice are well featured in these slower tracks, as are his lyrics, which welcome interpre­tation and offer up a connection between listener and author: "I am waiting for tonight/ Then waiting for tomorrow/ And I am somewhere in between what is real and just a dream/ Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell 


in." 

So when all is said and done, Lifehouse's freshman offering is not what it appears to be. It is a pleasant surprise and a smart investment. We can only hope to hear more that continues to sepa­rate this group from todays' ever­growing mass of one-hit wonders. 
ALBUM REVIEW 
Don't Let Go captures Garcia at his musical peak 
there was no doubt who was behind the wheel. 
Garcia's dominant musical presence is on display throughout Don't Let Go, a two disc live recording of the Jerry Garcia Band's performance at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco on May 21, 1976. Though Garcia frequently 


leads the band to moments of brilliance, 
the lack of other dominant personalities 
keeps the JGB one notch below the Dead. 
Nevertheless. the music presented on 
Don't Let Go is still viable and com­
pelling in its own right. Don't Let Go is strikingly similar to a Grateful Dead perfor­mance, and yet so dif­ferent. At the time of the concert, Garcia was approaching the peak of his career, with his voice and guitar textures in top form -before nar cotics took their toll. Also on stage that night were key­boardist Keith Godchaux and his sweet-singing wife Donna, both stalwarts of the Dead for most of the l 970s. The enchanting vocal interplay between Jerry and Donna elevates most songs here. most notably the title track. But in the thick of a jam, the creative and intricate rhythm guitar of Bob Weir and the bass explorations of Phil Lesh are sorely missed. The more reserved rhythm secti-0n of bassist John Kahn and drummer Ron Tutt rarely ventures into the foreground, giving the band an overall thinner sound than the Dead. Far from being a curse. this minimalism allows the subtleties of Garcia's gui­tar work to shine through in all its steely brilliance. Dominated by covers. the album offers only three songs native to the Jerry Garcia Band. "Sugaree" and "They Love Each Other," two origi-

By TIM BODONY 
Scene Music Critic 
The Grateful Dead traveled down so many roads, yet even during his vacations, lead singer Jerry Garcia had to keep on truckin'. As much a musicolo­gist as a performer, Garcia used his various side pro­jects to explore the American roots music traditions that initially influenced rock 'n' roll. 
During a Dead hiatus in 1972, Jerry hid out as a banjo player in the all-star bluegrass band Old and In the Way, taking a backseat to champion fiddler Vassar Clements and mandolin great David Grisman. But when he plugged in with the Jerry Garcia Band, nals that became staples of the Dead repertoire, immediately prompt the inevitable comparisons to the Dead. 
Garcia masterfully wins back the listeners' atten­tion with his bluesy. swaggering solo at the start of "That's What Love Will Make You Do." The version of "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" is slower than a turtle on codeine. while "After Midnight" shares plenty of similarities with the disco that dominated the air­waves at the time. This song typifies the second disc, which consists mainly of Motown and H & B hits done in a playful, yet sometimes cheesy, manner. 
Back on the more earthy first disc, the cover of Jimmy Clifrs "Sitting in Limbo" propels the show to its high point, combining a tender lyrical religiosity with a musical narrative that always leads back home. The San Francisco-themed "Mission in the Rain" initially diminishes the intensity, only to dra­matically reconstruct it piece by beautiful piece, with Garcia nimbly leading the song to a soaring finale. 
Such moments of brilliance underscore the value of' a recording like this to the legions of Deadheads who will not let Jerry slip silently into the bowels of rock history. The band manages to pay homage to American music traditions with a live-in-the-moment exuberance, but overall this album is more about the person of Jerry Garcia than the songs he sang that night in 1976. These two discs represent a frozen moment in time, showcasing an American icon at the pinnacle of his career.

lf there was one topic that made Fassel emotional on the day after, it was the team party. The coach wasn't in the partying mood, and he had to be persuad­ed by his wife, Kitty, to stop in 

the tent where it was being held. When he walked in, everyone gave him a standing ovation. 
"It felt very good," Fassel said, his eyes watering as he recount­ed the story. "That was very nice, probably as good as I felt.

It hurts right now, but I am not going to let that take away from everything that was accom­plished this year. We got to the Super Bowl. but I am not going to dwell on the negative of it." 
The positive is the Giants are going back, if Fasscl new guar­antee is as good as his last.

CLUB SPORTS 
Irish bowlers can't match nation's best 
Special to The Observer 
The Blue and Gold Classic lived up to its advance billing, as the top teams from all over the country tripped to Beacon Bowl for the Tier 1 national event. 
The Notre Dame bowling club finished 28th in the tournament. This year's field included eight of the top 10 men's teams, including reigning national champion Sagamore Valley, and cur­rent No. 1 Nebraska, and seven of the top 10 women's teams in the country.  
Competing on lanes oiled to PBA tournament specifications, averages were down for all clubs. The Irish lost a heartbreaker on the final ball rolled in the opening round to Wisconsin, 809 ­
808. While the Irish continued to bowl even with their wmpetition, the additonal 100 bonus points lost in several very close contests doomed the club to a lower half finish. 
Darren Kraft's 180 average paced the squad, followed by Kevin Gertken and Dan Buttke at 
170. Jason Pawlak, the usual team leader, rolled a 161 average, and team scoring was rounded out with Brian Gertken's 157 tally. The club will now prepare for the ACUI Regionals, scheduled for Feb. 9. 
Skiing 
The ski club's women faltered for the first time in two years in Divisional competition this weekend, finishing second to Michigan by one point in the Slalom at Crystal Mountain. 
Four women placed in the top 15. led by Molly Munsterer's first place run. Leigh Hellrung, third, Alanah Lundgren, 10th, and Jennifer Caswell, 13th. turned in very respectable times. 
Stung by the loss, the Irish rebounded to cap­
ture the Giant Slalom, as they dominated and 
overwhelmed the competition. Leigh Hcllrung 
brought home gold, while Molly Munsterer 
grabbed silver as they were joined by Alanah 
Lundgren and Jennifer Caswell in the top 10. 
The men continued to struggle as Wes Jacobs. 
Miki:: Ryan, Kevin Kennedy, Ryan Boger and Jon 
Pribaz could do no better than a fifth place tie. 
The club will complete the regular season por~ 
tion of their schedule with a trip to Schuss 
Mountain this coming weekend. 
Men's Volleyball 
Stepping up in competition, the men's volley­
ball club upped its overall record to 11-7 at the 
Michigan Classic. Using a two game ~or_mat. the 
club split games with all four teams m its open­
ing pool -Western Michigan, _St. Lou_is, 
Michigan, and Tennessee, to receive a third 
seed for Sunday's competition. 
After defeating Vanderbilt, the Irish fell in the 
next round to top seed Illinois, 25-20, 25-22. 
Brian Price and Jim Lowder had standout per­
formances at outside hitter,. while Jon Linzer, 
Aidas Kuolas and Jon Roller picked up the slack 
in the absence of injured middle hitter, Rob 
Smith. The club remains tied for second in con­
ference play at 4-2, and will next hit the courts 
in an 8 p.m. contest in the Pit, Feb. 8, against 
Georgetown .

Previously a "halfhearted Redskins fan," Taylor said he converted to the Ravens after the underdog team prevailed against the Tennessee Titans on Jan. 7. 
"They won me over," Taylor said. "I had not seen that kind of hitting since the Steel Curtain," he said, referring to the Pittsburgh Steelers' 1970s glory days.

"I'm so proud of this team," O'Malley said. "I'm so proud of how hard they fought all year and to go all the way." 
Citing the city's declining crime rate, higher public school test scores and rising real estate val­ues, O'Malley proclaimed the Super Bowl win a harbinger of more good things to come. 
"It's a great way to show off to the whole country that we'rn a city that's coming back and it's on the rebound and destined for great things," he said. 
Predictably, the crowd went wild as the team buses pulled up to the complex, but the undisput­ed highlight of the day was when team president David Modell and coach Brian Billick walked along the road with the Vince Lombardi Trophy, letting anybody within reaching distance touch it. 
"This is the people's trophy," Modell said. "You've got to let the fans have a chance to touch it," Billick 
added. "The

Ravens brought everybody back together. This is the neatest thing that's happened in so long. You could not do more for the city."

FENCING 
Irish squads post 5-0 weekend, defeat Northwestern 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sports Writer 
The men's fencing team got back to basics Sunday at Evansville while the women's side knocked off its top Midwest rival, Northwestern, as both teams posted 5-0 week­ends at the first Midwestern meet of the season. 
The No. 2 men cruised to five easy wins as they dominated club teams from Purdue (24-3). Lawrence (23-4), University of Chicago (23-4). Northwestern (21-6) and Case Western Reserve {23-4). While the com­petition was far from the best they will face all year, the men had to make a difficult adjust­ment to fence the club teams, according to epeeist Brian Casas. 
"You have to rely on more basic actions and simpler tech­
-niques," said the junior, who improved his season record to 17-8 with a 10-3 weekend. "It's tough. I am used to fencing good people in the gym and when you go to tournaments when you have to beat begin­ners and people who haven't fenced for very long, some­times the adjustment can be hard." 
Scott Gabler showed no trou­ble adjusting to the club fencers, however. The senior epeeist had one of his best weekends of his career as he finished l 4-1. Gabler's strong fencing was especially impor­tant since sophomore epee cap­tain Jan Viviani did not attend the meet. The first team All­American was in Cuba fencing in a World Cup event this weekend. 
The men's foil team was also strong as its top three fencers each went undefeated. Captain and All-American Ozren Debic upped his career record to 60­4 and moved into the top 5 in all-time Irish winning percent­age. Forrest Walton and Steve Mautone both bounced back from difficult opening week­ends to posted 8-0 and 6-0 records, respectively. 
The top four men's sabre fencers also finished the week­end undefeated as Matt Fabricant (15-0) remained the only undefeated fencer with more than 10 bouts. 
While the men's teams fenced only easy dub competi­tion. the women's team scored an upset of Northwestern. Avenging last year's loss to the No. 4 Wildcats, the No. 7 Irish jumped out to a 13-6 lead before holding on to win 14-13 win. The 5-0 weekend was especially critical as the Irish were coming off a 1-3 opening weekend. 

"It was a much easier meet than last week," freshman foilist Maggie .Jordan said. "The one tough team we fenced were just really fired up and we just knew it was an important week. After last week we were a little down but we knew this meet could bring us back up." 
Jordan was a big reason the Irish bounced back. While the freshman went 6-6 the first weekend, she went 12-0 in Evansville. Sophomore foilist Liza Boutsikaris' went B-0 as well to pick up her 50th career win. 
Jordan said she is just adjust­ing to the more difficult compe­tition in college compared to high school. 
"In high school I never really lost because the competition was much lower," Jordan said. "That was just the jitters or a first meet but I pulled through." 
Two freshmen and a sopho­
more also pulled through with 
big weekends for the Irish 
against the Wildcats. Freshmen 
Destanie Milo and Jesse Filkins 
respectively while sophomore 
Natalia Mazur went 6-2. All 
three fencers went 2-1 against 
Northwestern. 
While the foil squad went 7-2 
and the sabre squad went 6-3 
against Northwestern, the epee 
squad struggled to a 1-8 record 
against the Wildcats. 
Sophomore All-American 
Meagan Call picked up the only 
epee win while All-American 
Anna Carnick went 0-3. 
Call believes the epee squad 
can do better when the face the 
Wildcats again next weekend 
at home. 
"I am glad we get to fence 
them again because I want 
another chance against Jen 
Greenebaum and I think I can 
beat her," said Call who lost to 
Grecnebaum 5-3. "I beat her at 
NCAAs. I think I can beat her 
again and I know Anna can go 
3-0 against Northwestern. I've 
seen her do it before and I 
think she will next weekend." 
The women also defeated 
Lawrence(24-3), Case Western 
Reserve(24-3), Purdue {24-3) 
and the University of Chicago 
(21-6).

8-6. Guy continued to play well, winning the first round match 8-4 with teammate Katie Cunha. 
The second day proved to be much of the same for the Irish women. Some struggled, while Guy proved to be unstoppable. Guy advanced to the singles final by defeating Northwcstern's Jessica Rush 6­2, 6-1 in the semifmals of the second singles night. 
Junior Lindsay Green and Salas also grabbed wins on Saturday. Green rallied to beat Northwestern's Ruth Barnes 2­6, 6-4, 6-2 in the second flight singles consolation, and Salas held off Tennessee's Brooke Cordell 6-3, 4-6, 7-6. 
Dasso and Vaughan both dropped consolation singles matches on Saturday. Unfazed by her teammates' losses, Guy continued to mow through the competition. 
"I got a lot of confidence in my game after the dual match [against Duke] and every win gave me more and more confi­dence," said Guy. 
That confidence was illustrat­ed in the final, as Guy took down Annika Bengtsson of Florida 7-5. 6-2. Guy finished the weekend 4-0 and went through the second flight of sin­gles with out losing a single set. 
"The final was pretty close, especially in the beginning of the first and second sets, but all the .l{ames were tight," said Guy. "She's [Bengtsson] a good play­er but after winning a couple of close games I think she might have gotten a little rattled."

WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING 
Belles look past loss to cont erences 
By JANEL MILLER Spom Writer 
The Belles swimming and div­ing lcam ended its regular season with another close loss, this time to Kalamazoo, 122-12. 
"Everyone swam really well and we'ro not disappointed with our performance," said captain Olivia Smith. "As of right now, we're swimming to improve our times for conferences. I'd rather do well at conferences than win a few meets. We have been swim­ming well and our times arc great even while our win-loss columns may not rellecl it." 
Smith's sister. sophomore breaststroker Lauren Smith, agreed. 
"It [Saturday) was a good meet to end on. but we're not done, we are just beginning, and it all comes down to how you arc seed­ed al Conference and how well you are prepared. I think we swam well against the teams in the conference and are ready to get there and face them again." 
The Belles will count on the depth that has buoyed them thus far to carry them once again into a top finish at the MIAA Conference meet in two weeks. Key performers for the Belles will include freshman Megan Ramsey, who has broken various school records over the season. Ramsey led the Belles on Saturday, taking the 200-yard freestyle, 200 indi­vidual medley and the 200 but­terfly -an event in which she will hope for a bid at the NCAA championship meet. 
Ramsey was joined by senior co-captain Colleen Sullivan in the 200 freestyle to give the Belles the one and two spots with times of 2 minutes, .81 seconds and 2:4.41, respectively. 
Maureen Palchak grasped the 500 freestyle from Kalamazoo with a time of 5:28.07, out-touch­ing the next swimmer by only .13 seconds. Lauren Smith took a close first in the 200 breaststroke

with a time of 2:36.43. 
Diver Ryann Cox contributed very strong performances in both the one and three meter diving events. Cox proved she can han­dle pressure, edging in for second place in both heights. 
Overall, the women of the Saint Mary's swimming and diving team are "pumped" and ready for the next two. weeks of practices and the long-awaited conference meet. IJead coach Gretchen Hildebrandt said, "They have been swimming well, and I am pumped for conferences because I know they will do very well." 
As the Belles prepare for con­ferences, they have high hopes for their performance at Hope College Feb. 15-18. 
"It will be close but we can do well -we can definitely beat Alma and Albion and we were close to Kalamazoo, so we know we can take at least third," said Smith. "I would love for us to beat Calvin as well, and we could do it."

Jennifer Kearny again took first in the high jump for Notre Dame, clearing 5­5. 
"Jennifer is going to be really good," said Winsor. "My main concern with her right now is strength."

Grow, Love win sprints to spur squad past Spartans

By NOAH AMSTADTER Assisranr Sports Editor 
She may have had a bandage wrapped around her leg, but Irish sophomore sprinter Kymia Love hardly looked restrained during Friday's 88-71 Notre Dame victory over Michigan State. 
Love fought off teammate Kristin Dodd to win the 400 meters in a time of 56.33 sec­onds. 
"Kymia showed us last year she can run," said Irish sprints coach John Millar. "She's really struggled with injuries ever since her senior year of high school. She had a great fall. She's starting to come on again and I think she's going to sur­prise some people."
