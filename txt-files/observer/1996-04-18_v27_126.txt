Senate analyzes judicial councils 
By BILL CONNOLLY Assistant Nrws Editor 
An amendment to the Constitution of the Undergraduate Student Body was made dur­ing the first Student Senate meeting under the direction of the new Chairman, Seth Miller. 
The amendment was presented to the Senate at its last meeting by current Judicial Council President Tom Matzzie. Matzzie hoped to add a few sections onto Article X of the Constitution dealing with the judicial council president's power and the manner of sfllecting a judicial council president. 
Furthflr, Matzzie hopfld to create the posi­tion of judicial council vice-president to bet­ter structure thfl Judicial Council. 
With the new amendment, most of Matzzie's goals, including a new interview­ing process for judicial board presidential eandidutes and the creation of a judicial council viee president, were milt. However, tlw Snnute voted down a proposed amend­nwnt giving the judicial council president the powM to volP on the Student Senate.

Panel probes into assault policy 

The Observer/Michelle Sweet Last night, panelists discussed sexual harassment on campus. 
By ALEX ORR and ANGELA PETRUCCI 
New' Writers 
In an atmosphere of secrecy dominated by masculine pow­ers. the problem of sexual ha­rassment doesn't receive the riecnssary attention and sensi­tivity at Notre Dame that it de­serves. This was the consensus reached last night in DeBartolo . IJail as students and faculty dis­cussed sexual harassment in a lecture titled "Sexual Harass­ment I: Consent and Conflict of lntemst." 
Five speakers, chosen from both the student body and the faculty, spoke on various ha­rassment-related issues in what was the first of a two-part series. As part of Sexual Assault Awareness Week, the discussion was sponsored by the Gender Studies Department and the Women's Hesource Center. 
The panni discussion, that 
included professors Jeanne Kilde, Dan Sheerin and Teresa Ghilarducci, along with students Gina Hucavado and Jen Dovidio, focused on Notre Dame's gender relations environment. 
Kilde, assistant professor of American Studies, stated that an unseen hierarchy exists within various spaces around campus that reflect an artificial relation­ship between men and women. "By understanding the gender­ing of the landscape we can be­gin to address the feature of the unequal power relationships within that landscape that lie in the heart of sexual harassment," Kilde said. 
Furthermore, Kilde cited the

'Rhythmic drums and free-spirited dance' 
Students jam to cultural beat 
By DONNA MIRANDOLA 
News Writer 

llaggar Parlor was filled with rhythmic drums and free spirittld dance last night as participants led by tlw touring group of Lazare Houetin and musicians, lcarrwd the African self-expressive dance of D.JO­
(;BE 

Tlw 1>.10-GBE dance, literally meaning birth of day, is a rcaf1irmation of the value of community via colorful music and dunce celebration. Through this dancn, llouetin brings thn cultural heritage of the Wnst African country Benin to colleges and commu­nitins throughout the United States. 
This was the group's second pnrformance at Saint Mary's Collngn. In response to the popularity of last ynar's perforrnanee, the group was asked to return for yest11rday's repoat. 
"Dun to the great quality of the group, we took this Sflc:ond opportunity to exposfl the Saint Mary's co~­rnunity to an important expression of African art and dance," said Mardela Hamirez of the Muti­cultural Oflice, whieh co-sponsored of the event. 
The participants; students, faculty members and community, entered Haggar Parlor which was deco­rated in colorful African cloth. Furthermore, the members of the group dressed the participants in traditional African tribal garb including straw skirts and head dress. 
Starting with. the pounding drums and voices of Ilouetin and the musicians, the audience was encouraged to dance freely and express themselves listening to nothing but the rhythm of the earth. 
"DJO-GBE is a simple dance expression with no technique. It is a state of being, it is who you are," Houetin explained. 
The distinctiveness of DJO-GBE lies in its simplici­ty and its encouragement of free feeling and emo­tion. When performing the dance, the dancer should be in touch with the rhythm of oneself and the earth. 
"The whole experience was very sensual, being able to dance however you wanted. The experience was very interesting," said Brenda Hoban. 
The group also visited dance classes yesterday, sharing their self-expressive African dance with the dance students. 
"Besides participating in the dance tonight, we had the group in our dance class today. DJO-GBE is different because it is community oriented, it build as you go along," stated Kathleen Shivers. 
Houetin said, "The dance was also designed for cultural awareness and expression without competi­tion of any kind, it is for everyone." 
The performance of DJO-GBE by Houetin and his musicians was co-sponsored by the Student Academic Council, the Multicultural Office, the De­partment of Communication, Dance and Theater, and the Department of Modern Languages. 
report for submission to a NCAA peer review group. This five-member peer group will examine the Hatch's group's report this November for accuracy. The NCAA has the right to otTer recommenda­tions and suggestions based on what they read. 
According to Conboy. the present version of the report re­flects favorably on the University, although it was also help­ful in revealing areas that can be improved. "People have been encouraged by what goes on in the department. I think it's been a healthy tool. Part of the process is that if there are things that can be improved, they are pointed out." she said.

SMC to change course evaluation procedures 
ByBERNADETTEPAMPUCH 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's may soon change the way it evaluates its faculty, giving students more room for comment and less for fill-in-the dot numerical responses. 
"The proposal is to change the evaluation slightly [and] to elim­inate the numerical data," said Dorothy Feigl, college vice pres­ident and dean of faculty. She explained that eliminating rat­ings of "excellent," "good" and so forth which were previously translated numerically might possibly give way to more space for written commentary. 
The forms themselves go back to faculty and their respective department chairs, allowing them to review both their numerical total and individual student responses and sugges­tions. One concern in the past with this process has been that students have been relying more on the fill-in-the dot rat­ings and less on comments. 
"The faculty have concerns about how seriously the stu­dents take the evaluations," said Feigl. Some of the changes that have been proposed include evaluating certain classes and

Sins 
of 

time 

No excuses.  This isn't  
a column about social  Jamie Heisler  
injustice on campus (not  Assistant News Editor  
that there isn't any),  

and it's not a column about baseball (keeping in mind that there are non-sports minded people who make up the other two percent of the Notre Dame population.) It's not about the cold weather (or the South Bend yo-yo effect which allows me to wear shorts and a t­shirt one day, while laying out my Eddie Bauer super-parka for the next day), and in fact this column is surprisedly not even a series of complaints about the oppressive iron fist of the administration (I wouldn't call it iron, per se, steel maybe). 
This column is, in fact, a reflection on the true curse of my life... the alarm clock. It may seem slightly trivial but in all honesty, what most people think of as just an ordinary fea­ture of their daily lives, I find to be the one and only anti-Christ. It's true. No other item in my life could possibly provoke more sinful action or provide more temptation than the alarm clock. 
It may seem slightly extreme, but I think that the alarm clock has evoked at least one of the seven deadly sins at some point in every­one's college experience. For example: 
• Sloth-Who hasn't, at one time or other, hit the snooze bar once or twice, thinking "It's only five minutes, I swear I'll get up the next time it goes otT," only to wake up three hours and two classes later. 
I, of course, have achieved the ultimate in alarm clock laziness. At some point early this year, after a few all-nighters, I learned how to successfully sleep through the alarm while simultaneously reaching over and shutting off the source of the mid-sleep annoyance. 
Obviously, my body determined this was the best means of survival, because it is a talent that I have seemed to maintain and execute every morning. 
•Vengeance-Power 
outages are the best ways to relate vengeance and the ordinary alarm clock. And not only do most alarm clocks not have the convenient battery back­up, but they all have the nerve to blink the incorrect time in that taunting way, as a jeer­ing reminder that you really have no clue as to what time it is. 

Yeah, they really know what time it is, but they're just not going to tell you. And God save an alarm clock if it doesn't go off one moming when there was no power outage. Two words: baseball bat. 

•Envy-When 
I was little I was always jeal­ous of my brother's baseball shaped padded alarm clock that shut off when you bounced it against a wall. 


Definite alarm clock-envy. Of course, in col­lege not many people have the really cool alarms, and in fact most roommates seem to find the most annoying alarms possible (not mine of course), which takes us back to vengeance. But wouldn't it be cool to find that one rare alarm which didn't make you (or your roommates) break into tears in the morning. 
So be sure that you set your alarm in order to make confession for these deadly sins. And isn't it ironic {don't you think)?

duty, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike Mercer, a Navy spokesman. Skies were clear at the time, although winds were gusting up to 25 mph. The cause of the crash was under in­vestigation, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Kevin Wensing said. 
The crash came one day after Navy and Marine Corps officials said they are revamping pilot training and improving equipment on fighter planes because of the recent crashes of F-14s and AV-8B Harriers. 
The Pentagon earlier this year shuf­fled money in its defense budget for emergency repairs on F-14s after after three recent F -14 crashes killed two two-man crews and three civilians on the ground. The two crewmen ejected safely in the third F -14 crash in the Persian Gulf. 
All three of the earlier crashes involved West Coast-based F-14s. But Oceana will soon be the home of all Navy F-14s under a consolidation ordered last year by the government. 

Town yanks 'BITE-ME' billboard 
TALLMADGE, Ohio 

Gotta problem with the taste of Kick soda? Call 1-800­BITE-ME. That's the message on a billboard that went up in three northeast Ohio counties -then went down in one city that didn't care for th£-billboard's in-your-face message. The local distributor of the high-caffeine, high­sugar citrus drink yanked the billboard out of this sedate Akron suburb of 17,000 on Tuesday. The billboard invit­ed people to dial 1-800-BITE-ME "if you have complaints about Kick." The number doesn't exist -it lacks an 11th digit. "It's a little tasteless and tacky," said Richard Schunk, city law director in Tallmadge, which boasts that it has 28 churches and no taverns. That was pretty much the point, said Don Lenehan, senior vice president of marketing for Kick's producer, RC Cola in Fort Laud­erdale, Fla. "If we make it middle of the road so every parent says, 'Isn't that nice,' we lose our market," Lene­han told the Akron Beacon Journal. Kick's target audi­ence: high school and college men. Philip Zinsmeister, general manager of Seven-Up in Akron, local distributor of Kick, said the company received about four complaints about the billboard. 
Farm markets continue to tighten 
CHICAGO 

Grain and soybeans futures prices turned mostly higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as heavy com­mercial buying revived worries about some supplies hov­ering at 50-year lows. Prices trekked lower in early trad­ing in selling that followed steep losses Tuesday, a retreat tied to ideal planting and growing weather finally reach­ing many parts of the Midwest. But investors began to focus on the fundamentally tight supply situation as the falling prices prompted widespread buying, said analyst Don Roose. "I think everyone began to realize that if we break the market too far (on the downside), we might not see the rationing we need and in fact may begin to see the same problem that got this rally going in the first place." Grain prices in particular have rocketed higher in recent weeks after the Agriculture Department reported bins are being depleted. Wheat for July delivery rose 7 3/4 cents to $5.39 a bushel; May corn rose 4 1/4 cents to $4.48 1/2 a bushel, while the July contract fell slightly; July oats rose 5 cents to $2.29 1/2 a bushel; July soy­beans rose 10 1/2 cents to $7.92 3/4 a bushel. Live cattle and hog futures were mixed on the Chicago Mere.

Minow, who served as chair­man for CBS and is currently the chairman for PBS, claimed that those in charge of what airs on television are con­cerned not with the content of what they are broadcasting, but rather with what they think the public and the advertisers want. While Minow believes that adults can effectively filter their own TV intake, he stress­es that children should be shielded from immoral pro­gramming. 
"There are three things that we treasure as Americans, free speech, free markets, and edu­cating and protecting our kids," Minow said. "In our dedication to the first two," he claimed, "we have short­changed our kids."

Another proposed idea has been to to put between five and 10 percent of the money the FCC is making by auctioning off the television airways towards every school and library in the country. "This would give chil­dren access to the best things in our country and not just the worst," Minow said. 
Newton Minow is a graduate of Northwestern University. He is currently counsel to the Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin and is director of the Annenberg Washington Pro­gram in Communications Policy Studies at Northwestern. 
His lecture was part of the Department of Theology's Bert and Etta Liss Lecture series and was titled, "Television Values and the Values of our Children."

In relation to NCAA viola­tions, Conboy stated that the committees found only one pos­sible infraction. "To my knowl­edge only there was only one that raised itself to that level. The question was more about whether to change practices than anything," she said. "Our philosophy, however, is that no matter how small it is, we re­port it." 
She also added that Notre Dame makes an average 10-15 self-reports a year, outside of the self-study. 
While the University has per­formed self-studies in the past. most recently in 1991, this year's study is the first to in­clude non-athletic department faculty. 
"This is the first time we've had people from other walks of University life," Conboy said. "There are very few people directly from the athletic department. [The report] is more accurate when people are involved with no vested inter­est." 
For this reason, subcommit­tee heads were chosen by Mal­loy from both the faculty and from the administration, as were the majority of the sub­committee members. Malloy's choices for subcommittee heads were made on the basis of who had knowledge and a background in the area of the subcommittee. 
His subcommittee head selec­tions included Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia O'Hara, Associate Professor of Govern­ment James McAdams, Asso­ciate Dean for MBA Programs 
Saint Mary's Spirit Week 1996 
William Nichols. and Vice Pres­ident and General Counsel Carol Kaesebier in the areas of governance, academic in­tegrity, fiscal integrity, and eq­uity, respectively. 
According to Conboy, the in­clusion of non-athletic person­nel and the review by the NCAA peer group assure that the re­sults of the self-study are legit­imate and accurate. 
The integrity of the Notre Dame study has been upheld, according to Conboy who stat­ed, "We've been very candid because we feel it is the best route to take...We have a lot of controls in place, both long standing and traditional," she said. 
The results of the University study will be made available to the faculty and student body before it is submitted to the NCAA this fall, according to Conboy. At that point the peer­review panel will review the fi­nalized report and make a rec­ommendation to the NCAA's Committee on Athletics Certifi­cation as to whether or not the school should receive certifica­tion acknowledging its compli­ance in each of the four exam­ined areas.

The Student Academic Council (SAC), which provides a forum for faculty and students to work together on a variety of issues, will be helping give input on the changes to the eval­uations. 
Karen Murphy, next year's religious studies department representative for the SAC, was enthusiastic about students having more opportunity to ex­press their opinions. "I think it's a good idea, personally," she said. 
"It's exciting. They really want student input," agreed Beth Ann Miller, incoming pres­ident of SAC. Miller will over­see SAC next week when they begin discussing the issue. 
Students and faculty alike may see changes to evaluations as early as next fall, and sug­gestions are welcome from any­one in the college community.

African nations' eurrent problems of underde­velopment ean be traced to the days of European colonization when they were forced to have extrovertml economies which supplied raw mate­rials for the ruling countries, according to Professor Paulin llountondji of the National University of Benin in Cotonou. 
In last night's lecture titled "The Challenge of Self-Heliance: Implications for Education and Science Polieins in Africa," llountondji explained and compared Africa's nconomy and its scientific eomrnunity. 
"Sdentifie activity is just as extroverted as neonomie aetivity," he emphasized. 
l·:xporting raw materials during eolonial years in caused some African countries to become unahln to nffnctively produce the goods needed to hneomn a prosperous and independent. It is important to avoid this pitfall with today's scien­tific community of Africa, llountondji said.

Ill~ went on to explain. "The African anthro­pologist is a lnarrwd man, but he acts just as an informant in rhargn of coll1~eting data but not fl~ally busy with inll~rpreting theoretically these data." 
In order to rnnwdy this problem, llountondji anthropologists' interpretations. 
Hountondji made an analogy comparing the industrial plants of the colonial times to the gAfriathering of raw data for scientific work today: Both tend to hinder the holistic growth of a nation. Africa needs to avoid falling into the same cyclical trap at the present time, he warned. 
llountondji was critical of one current policy of paying out money in scholarships for people to get superOuous higher education while they are gaining no practical experience. Instead, these moneys should be used to fund a social insertion of youths into the workplace as they are further­ing their education, he said. 
Hountondji concluded his lecture by saying, "The northern part of the planet can and should help the south to become less and less depen­dent, but of course everything must begin with the south ... in order to be in a better position to contribute to global development of mankind." 
Hountondji, a philosophy professor, once served as Minister of National Education of Benin and was special advisor to the head of state of Benin. He is in the United States traveling for a month as a Distinguished Fellow of the Fulbright Program.

WASHINGTON 

Senate Republicans pushing to pass an anti-terrorism bill before Friday's anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing turned aside Democratic at· tempts Wednesday to expand federal law enforcement pow­ers. 
The House-Senate compro­mise bill would limit federal appeals by death-row inmates and provide for the death penalty in certain internation­al terrorism cases and for killing a federal employee because of their work. 
The bill restores some administration-backed law enforcement powers eliminat­ed by House members, such as barring fund raising by for­eign terrorist groups, but it omits others. 
Key among the dropped provisions was one making it easier to wiretap phones of suspected terrorists, some­thing already allowed in orga­nized crime probes. 
The Senate voted 58-40 against sending the measure back to a conference commit· tee to restore the provision after its author, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, warned that such a move would kill the bill. 
Batch, chairman of the Sen­ate Judiciary Committee, said he would try to "get this done one way or the other" in sepa­rate legislation. 
"Some have raised ... seri­ous questions as to whether this expanded authority to wiretap American citizens and others is necessary," he said. "It comes down to whether we want a bill or we don't." 
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., argued that those who opposed it didn't understand that the eavesdropping would be strktly limited to the target of the surveillance and that such wiretaps would require top judidal approval.

Bob Dole wants President Clinton's job and he knows Clinton wants to keep it, but the Senate majority hopes they can agree on some legisla­tion before their battle for the White House gets rough. 
"People want us to get things done," Dole, the p'resumed Hepublican presidential nominee, said Wednesday on PBS' "The Newshour with Jim Lehrer." 
"I want to be a good president, the president wants to be a good president, another term. but let's don't start the fight yet. Let's get some things done first," said Dole. 
Dole, who trails Clinton in most polls, said he wasn't the only vulnerable candidate.

"But, you know, we have a different philoso­phy generally, and that's what the two-party sys­tem is all about." 
The Kansas senator said he thought he and Clinton eventually could agree on legislation con­cerning terrorism, health care and possibly rais­ing the minimum wage. 
"But I would say come July, August, then it's going to get -it'll be frantic politically," said Dole in the interview, taped earlier Wednesday.

sits on the Senate, but does not have voting power. Junior Class President Matt Griffin expressed reservations in changing this procedure. 
"If the Judicial Council, and through it the judicial board president, is supposed to be separate from Student Gov­ernment, won't the president being allowed to vote on Stu­dent Government issues com­promise his 
,............,.........., or her autonomy?" 
Matzzie responded that the judicial council president al­
ready sits on Matzzie 
the Campus Life Council, and is entrenched in Student Government. However, he stressed the key goal of his resolution was not giving the judicial council president vot­ing power. 
Matzzie saw the most impor­tant point as the new inter­view process where a commit­tee lead by the student body president and the outgoing judicial council president would select the new judicial council president. 
In the past, the Judicial Council has chosen its presi­dent. This has worked poorly, said Matzzie, because differ­ent Judicial Board members in different halls are either "working well, working poor­ly, or non-existent." 
Student Body Vice President · Megan Murray, who chaired the meeting in Miller's ab­sence, then called for a vote on the amendment. This first vote included many absten­tions, with only three mem­bers voting yes and live voting no. 
Matzzie then stressed that he wanted to reform the posi­tion in order to better choose his future successor. He urged the Senate to tell him which part of the amendment they disagreed with so that he could get at least part of the amendment passed. 
Many members stated that they, like Griffin, only dis­agreed with the section which gave the judicial council presi­dent voting power on the Student Senate. 
Matzzie agreed to eliminate that specific part of the amendment, and the Senate voted again. The amendment was passed with 11 voting yes, no one voting no, and three abstaining. 
In other Student Senate news, Murray anno.unced that the responsibilities of the Recreation Facilities Committee would be included in the new Athletic Resources Department created as a Cabinet position by her and Miller. 
She reported that the De­partment had met with the athletic director to discuss the Recreation Facilities Report, which included revisions in the Football ticket exchange program and improvements in the accessibility of Recsports facilities. 
The Student Senate also passed a resolution praising John Hume and congratulat­ing him on being the recipient of this year's Notre Dame Award. Burne has been a key figure in the peace talks in Northern Ireland. 

Rushdie: Journalists must establish t·ruth 
By MIKE FEINSILBER Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Salman Rushdie, an author who lives under a death sentence because of what he wrote, told newspaper editors Wednesday that newspeople and novelists occupy common ground: Both seek the truth. 
"The great issue facing both writers of journalism and of novels is that of deter­mining and then publishing the truth," Rushdie said. He spoke to the Society of Newspaper Editors. 
And that may require courage, he sug­gested. 
"Truth is all too often unpalatable, awk­ward, unorthodox," he said. "The armies of received ideas are marshaled against it. The legions of all those who stand to profit by useful untruth will march against it. 
Yetit must, if at all possible, be told." 
He said books such as>"Uncle Tom's Cabin," "Huckleberry Finn" and "Moby Dick" are all ''information heavy" in the sense that they, like newspapers, convey news about the world as it is. 
Rushdie, 48, who is British, has lived in exile for seven years, although he has become more relaxed recently about appearing in public. 
His appearance before the editors was announced in their program. 
He went into hiding in February 1989, after the late Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a "fatwa," or death sentence, and placed a $1 million bounty on his head. 
The ayatollah said Rushdie must be killed because his novel "The Satanic Verses" blasphemed Islam. 
Rushdie made only scant and indirect reference to his situation in his speech about the nature of truth. 
"Truth is slippery and hard to estab­lish," he said. "If truth can set you free it can also land you in hot water." 
James K. Batten, a much beloved news­paperman, was honored at the opening of the ASNE meeting. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., one of the nation's largest newspaper enterprises, died of brain cancer .June 24, 1995. He was por­trayed as a man who understood that the reason newspapers exist is to print good pictures and good stories. 
The tribute came from his longtime associate, David Lawrence, publisher of The Miami Herald, a Knight-Ridder paper. 
While pictures of Batten, as a boy, as a soldier and as an editor, flashed on a screen, Lawrence talked about him in emotional tones.

• JAPAN 
Clinton praises economic ties 
By TERENCE HUNT 
Associated Press 
TOKYO 

President Clinton celebrated Anwrica's ties with Japan as 'better and stronger than ever" Wednesday despite unresolved trade l'ric­lions between the world's two richest 11 eo n o m i e s . lie planned to tell .Japan's par­liament that trade must be frne and fair. 
Winding down a state visit, Clinton was to address Japanese lawmakers Thursday and visit a Chrysler showroom to underscore U.S. efforts to pry open Asian markets. By all aeeounts. Clinton hit it ofT well with Prime Minister Hyutaro Hashimoto, the fifth Japanese leader during Clinton's three­year administration. 
The president, talking with his staff. described llashimoto as "feisty and unconventional." A onetime textile worker, llashimoto won a reputation as a tough trade negotiator with the United States before becoming prime minister. 
In privattl discussions, Clinton and Hashimoto "did not sec quite eye-to-eye" on trade issues, but the matters were not diseussed in detail, said Sandra Kristoff, the chief Asia specialist on the National Seeurity Couneil. 
The U.S. trade del'ieit with .Japan declined last year for the first time since 1990 but still totaled a staggering $59 bil­lion, giving Hepublicans elec­tion-year ammunition to attack Clinton's record. 


Both leaders expressed hope for progress in disputes over film, semiconductors and in­surance. 
There also were differences on civil aviation. Hashimoto said Japan wants to renegoti­ate an existing agreement; the 
U.S. does not. 
At a joint news conference with Hashimoto, Clinton de­clared the trade relationship to be "on the right track" and said the two sides would han­dle disputes in a "patient and pragmatic manner." 
The leaders strived to keep the focus on security issues where they readily agreed that a strong American military presence is needed in Asia. 
Hashimoto said Japan wants the 47,000 American service personnel stationed here to remain. Clinton pledged to re­duce the burden that U.S. bases put on Japan's citizens. But he said the United States would keep 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia to maintain sta­bility. 
"I believe that our presence is needed here as long as peo­ple have any fear at all that some countries might seek to dominate others," Clinton said, apparently referring to ten­sions between North and South Korea and between China and Taiwan. 
"We are seen as a source of stability by our mere presence here," the president said.

Menendez verdict: Life -without parole 
By LINDA DEUTSCH 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

Erik and Lyle Menendez were spared the death penalty Wednesday for methodically gunning down their wealthy parents 6 1/2 years ago in their Beverly Hills mansion. 
The jury recommended life in prison without parole for the killings of record company executive Jose Menendez and his socialite wife, Kitty. The brothers have already spent over six years in jail. 
The jurors deliberated for 13 hours over three days before filing into the court­room Wednesday with grim faces. The room was gripped with tension as the foreman handed in their written deci­sions. 
There were four separate verdicts in all, two for each brother for the killings of each parent. When the fourth "life in prison without parole" verdict had been read, a large gasp of relief came from where members of the Menendez family sat wait­ing. 
The brothers entered the courtroom in shirts and ties, their faces paler than ever. Neither reacted much. Erik sat foreward to listen more closely, then leaned back in his chair as the verdicts were completed. 
The jury's pronouncement did not end the legal saga for the brothers. 
The judge scheduled a hear­ing July 2 to hear defense mo­tions for a new trial and to pronounce sentence. 
While the jury's decision is only a recommendation, the judge does not have the option to impose a death sen­tence in contradiction of the jurors' wishes. 
Had they pronounced death, he could have reduced it to life. 
The penalty verdict came nearly a month after the brothers were found guilty of killing their parents with 12­gauge, pump-action shotguns as they watched TV in the liv­ing room of their Beverly Hills mansion. 
The brothers contended they were avenging years of abuse and cruel treatment. That defense was powerful enough in the first trial to deadlock the jury. In the sec­ond trial, the judge didn't allow the defense. 
The retrial took five months, but jurors needed only 13 hours to guilty verdicts. 
The jurors later said they did not want to talk with the media in the courthouse, although Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg warned they might be pur­sued elsewhere if they did not grant a press conference. 
The judge agreed to allow nearly three months before sentencing after Abramson said she planned a lengthy new trial motion that would be complicated and might consume over a day of court time.

masculinity "intimately inscribed all around us," and the power the Universities hierarchy holds over stu­dents. Kilde said this is evident in the architecture and landscaping, as "Each brick, each tree represents the goodness of order and control." 
Females, relatively new members of the "Notre Dame Family" are, despite a few inroads, still "outsiders" on campus, she said, citing parietal controls and housing based on gender as ways of keeping power out of the hands of women. Kilde concluded that "given the gender meanings of the Notre Dame landscape ... imbalances of power and privacy and intimacy lead to an environ­ment for sexual harassment." 
Sheerin, chair of Classical Oriental Languages & Literature, spoke of the issue of secrecy which seems to pervade this university. He said that, in terms of sexual harassment, there is a tendency for the University to say that it doesn't happen and if it does "we don't talk about it." The secrecy that does exist, according to Sheerin, is a great problem for any individual facing the issue of sex­ual harassment. 
Sheerin said that the air of secrecy goes beyond harassment, reaching as far as "anything potentially scandalous." Though due process prevents the disclo­sure of information and the "demands of charity" keep official mouths shut, these two silencers are often merely "pretexts for the suppression of truth," he said. 
According to Sheerin, this lack of dia­logue fosters ignorance. "As a community, we don't really know what sexual harass­ment means," he said. "As a community, we don't know how to talk about it." 
The with-holding of information by the faculty can also be much worse than breeding ignorance, as it can "thwart, alienate, maim and kill our students," and turn "insecure girls to anorexic women and cal-
She then went on to give the varied views of harassment on campus, from the University as a work place, as a "kind of medieval workshop," and as an extension of the home. Scenarios of harassment were presented and then interpreted within the context of each view. 
The ambiguity of what makes up harassment on Notre Dame campus is worsened by the fact that students "check in their bill of rights" when they come on campus, she said. Ghilarducci also pointed out that the University, like

opportunity for discussion by the audience. Many indi­viduals expressed their opinions of rigid structure of spaces that exist on campus and the lack of comfort that is generated as a result. 
Ghilarducci, a professor of economics, spoke on the legal ramifications of sexual harassment. She echoed the feelings of the earlier speakers, particularly Kilde, when she laughingly related her first impression of Notre Dame: "Within a week I thought I had to call OSHA because of the toxic level of testos­terone!" 
views on the school's sexual harassment policy. 
Dovidio detailed the path of a harass­ment complaint as it traveled through the Office of Resident Life. She cited that only one woman is represented among the Hearing Officers, and that this short­coming prompts the "need for a middle­man organization," however, she said on the whole, the du Lac harassment policy "is a good thing." 
Rucavado's view of the policy was much less favorable. She personally had gone through the process of filing a false complaint in order to see if everything possible would be done for an harass­ment victim. 
Eventually gaining an interview with Sister Cannon in the Provost's office, she found that the harassment policy, covered by sparse literature in the du Lac supple­ment, was not further documented at higher levels within the administration. 
While a seemingly large amount of guidance was provided by each of the counselors and administrators she came across during her dry-run, she com­plained "there is a difference between providing written statements and provid­ing guidance." For Rucavado, personal security could only be achieved through a clearly defined in-depth sexual harass­ment policy. 
Gloria Jean Masciarotte, an English professor who moderated the discussion, summed up the theme of the lecture near its conclusion when she stated, "Sexual harassment is not sex, it is power." 
The discussion generated various responses from the audience specifically in regards to the procedure that is fol­lowed by Notre Dame when a harass­ment issue arises. 
Masciarotte stated that the procedure followed by the University seems to vary on a case by case basis with no set proce­dures that a student can follow. "The faculty needs to learn about what (sexual harassment) is and what they can do," she said. 
The discussion of these gender-related issues continues at the second part of the discussion on Wed., April 24 at 4:30 pm in room 141 DeBartolo.

Militia figure wants FBI meeting 
By TOM LACEKY 
Associated Press 
JORDAN, Mont. 

A Michigan militia figure said he carry a child's teddy bear and a letter from a con­cerned son when he attempts to get into the co-mpound where Freemen are in a 24­day-old standoff with the FBI. 
Norman Olson was turned away by armed agents when he tried to enter the FBI's com­mand center late Tuesday af­ternoon. lie said he wanted to meet with the FBI field com­mander. 
Olson said the teddy bear is a gift from 6-year-old Rance! Chamberlain, son of Jordan area rancher Lyle Chamber­lain. 
Olson. interviewed while eat­ing breakfast in a Jordan cafe, said the child gave him the teddy bear because he thinks the children in the compound are lonely. Olson said he will also carry a letter from a son to his mother who is in the compound. He wouldn't identi­fy the son, but said he is con­
cerned about his mother's health. 
Olson said he would try later in the day to get access to the compound, first through the FBI commander in Jordan, and then at the main checkpoint to the compound. 
"We are trying to come with an extended hand, trying to find some resolution, so that his people and the militia do not have to converge on a field of battle where there is going to be bloodshed and there's going to be violence," Olson said in an interview aired on WCBS radio. Olson announced plans two weeks ago for a relief convoy to bring food, medicine and other supplies to the anti-government extrem­ists, although they reportedly have stockpiled such supplies for months.

IRA suspected in west London explosion 

By RON KAMPEAS 
Associated Press 
LONDON 

An explosion rocked an ex­pensive residential district of west London Wednesday night, following a warning call at­tributed to the Irish Hepublican Army, police and lire officials said. 
The blast tore through an un­inhabited house undergoing renovation on The Boltons, a street of elegant Victorian ter­raees. There were no injuries and "minimal damage" to property, said police spokeman Steve Park. 
An anonymous telephone call ree!lived by The Associated Press, and using a recognized eode word, warned a bomb was planted. The blast went off 12 minutes later. 
"The ol1icers had just startfld to seareh the area when at 2154 (9:54 p.m. local time, 4:54 
p.m. EDT), the explosion took place," Park said. "Luckily there were no injuries, as police officers were already searching the area. There were no evac­uations." 
He said the explosion "was probably the work of the IRA." 
The IRA ended its 17 -month cease-lire on Feb. 9, citing what it said was British intransigence in attempts to bring peace to the British-ruled province. 
There have been four bomb explosions -in which three people died and dozens were injured -and one discovery of bombs since then. 
All the attacks have been in London, apparently because the IRA does not want to provoke pro-British Protestant militias in Northern Ireland into retali­ating, which would could lead to wholesale bloodshed. 
It was not clear why the IRA would have chosen a privately owned house on a residential side street as a target; previous bombs have seem aimed to­ward causing maximum eco­nomic damage or maximum in-

"This is not a legitimate tar­get," said one indignant man climbing into his Jaguar. He said the windows in his house, adjacent to the one where the explosion took place, had been shattered. 
Formally dressed residents, walking home from dinner parties in the mild, jasmine­scented evening, were unable to get past police cordons to their houses in an area that is home to millionaires and diplo­mats. 
Winnie Gordon-Strauss, who lives in a house adjacent to the blast, was stepping out with her dog, when the blast blew apart a lamp in her vestibule. "I've still got glass in my hair," she said. 
The first IRA bomb after the cease-fire was broken was a truck bomb in east London's Docklands business district. It killed two newspaper vendors, wounding scores and wrecking several office buildings.

Loanr11oney' 
used for Whitewater 
ByJAMES JEFFERSON Associated Pre$$ 
LI'ITI.E ROCK, Ark. 
A witness in the Whitewater trial who sold land to James and Susan McDougal testified today that failing business and health had left McDougal "a broken man." 
The testimony was given in federal court in the seventh week of the trial of the Me· Dougals, the Clintons' part­ners in Whitewater Development Corp. in 1978· 92, and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
Peter Mertz, a former ln· ternational Paper Co. execu­tive, sold 810 acres just south of Little Rock to Whitewater for $550,950 in a deal that closed Oct. 10, 1986. McDougal later transferred the land out of Whitewater to the Great Southern Land Co., which he owned without the Clintons. 
Mertz testified today that International Paper reclaimed the land from Great Southern after the McDougals' attorney, Jack Files, informed the company that the McDougals were unwilling to put more time or money into the venture. 
"His attorney said that (McDougal) was a broken man, that the failure of his savings and loan empire had left him in an ill condition," Mertz said. "Susan McDougal was nowhere that we knew of." 
The McDougals and Tucker are accused of fraud and con­spiracy in getting $3 million in loans from Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which the McDougals owned, and Capital Management Services Inc., which David Hale ran. 
The government contends that part of a $300,000 loan from Hale's Capital Manage­ment to Mrs. McDougal's ad­vertising company, Master Marketing, paid at least $25,000 of a $99,000 down payment for the IP land. ·

• Goo 'N LIFE 

"No man is an island." 
In one particular case, it seems to me that one man made an island ­Beaver Island -a better place to live, with a true spirit of faith. 
Jewell Gillespie, who died this past October at the age of 78, lived on a tiny chunk of ground near the Michigan coast for most of his life. He is responsible for many of the island's roads, the telephone system, playgrounds, building a church and bringing generators to supply elec­trical power. His door was always open for his neighbors, whether they needed him to fix something or just wanted to visit. 
Mr. Gillespie's story could have remained buried in the annals of time, but happened to appear in the Chicago Tribune on November 15, 1995. A fluke, really. Columnist Bob Greene noted that this simple man's "greatness" would never be mentioned in the history books, but that the people he touched wouldn't have been the same without him. 
It's not that Bob Greene sees Jewell Gillespie as a rarity. He admits that similar selfless in­dividuals can be found in most com­munities across the country. Still, their number would double, triple, or even quadruple if people paid less attention to "success" and spent more time giving of themselves. 
Father Ken Grabner, chaplain to the Holy Cross Brothers, gave a recent homily in which he men­tioned that in heaven there is an all­you-can-eat banquet complete with five foot long forks. How does a per­son eat with a fork so large? By feeding his neighbor. 
This imagery does not just apply to eternal life. The Bible is full of sto­ries about "faithful servants" and those who helped others, both in the Old and New Testaments. Those who give of themselves, even unwill­ingly at times, are generously rewarded in Scripture. Examples like that of Jewell Gillespie cannot be thrust aside as so much "pious nonsense" while the quest for mate­rial things continues. 
People like Jewell Gillespie make void any debate over whether a per­son claims to be Christian, Jewish, Muslim or whatever, or how many people attend a specific church each week. Actions do, after all, speak louder than words. St. Paul himself wrote that faith without action is worthless. And it is not the "obvi­ous" things that display a person's true faith, but the hidden acts of kindness that take place well beyond the spotlight. 
Julie Ferraro 

The reason researchers do not write about these simple folk is because their existence is, for the most part, undocumented. Only in places like the Petosky (Michigan) News-Review, where Mr. Gillespie's obituary was printed, is there room to detail such a life. In the Detroit Free Press or the New York Times, the man might rate a paragraph in small type, along with the countless others who died the same day. 
That is how too many good people are remembered. Those like John Paul II, Mother Teresa of Calcutta or Martin Luther King, Jr. are certainly more visible because their actions are on a much grander scale. 
Not everyone can have this kind of fame. Still, to sit back and let "oth­ers" work with the poor, volunteer to help Habitat for Humanity build houses, or even help shelve books at the local library because there is "no recognition in it" is a cop-out. No matter what religion (if any) a person professes, interaction with others is a part of life-ideally, self­less action in the assistance of one's neighbor. 
Can modern Americans, raised and educated all the way through college to believe that success is the amount of money in the bank or the size of a stock portfolio, truly live the faith? Of course! 
It does not mean conspicuously wearing a gold cross on a chain or reading the Bible at one's desk dur­ing work hours. Like Jewell Gillespie, living the faith means being open to others, willing to help, using God-given talents to improve one's own "little corner" of the world. 
Just think how many wars would be avoided if, one by one, people took the example of generous souls in their communities and began looking at the world through kinder eyes. How much conflict and hatred would be eliminated! Drug and alcohol abuse would practically dis­appear, because there would be no need to "escape" the pressures of a life filled with kindness, caring, and love. 
A hopelessly optimistic view, per­haps? Jewell Gillespie obviously didn't think so. He spent his life making Beaver Island a wonderful place to live. Why can't the American people take his story to heart and grow in faith?. It'll take time, sure, for the epidemic to spread, but what better type of epi­demic could there be? 
A country filled with Jewell Gillespies. A world of people feeding each other with five-foot long forks. 
Why not?

ND London confronts boiDbings 
Dear Editor: 
I write in response to the two-part article in The Observer entitled "London, Notre Dame and the IHA'' since I feel that it may have painted a more dramatic picture of life in London than in fact exists. 
I would join Assistant Dean Gutting in her assurance that our experience of living with the terrorist problflm for many years has made us well-equipped to deal with the situation. At the London Centre there are some 120 students in the Spring and 140 in the Fall -80 undergradu­ates, 40 Law and 20 MBA graduates. We are in contact with the Metropolitan Police Crime Prevention Officer. who knows the ND London Ctmtre well and usually comes to talk to students about security soon after their arrival in London. lie has assured us that not only would ND London btl considered an extremely low priority for any form of IHA violence, but that it would be more likely to work the other way in that the IHA are very keen to maintain good relations with the United States. Albemarle Street itself is not deemed to be a high priority either. 
During the Gulf War we were obviously consid­ered by the police to be a much greater potential target, though still not much of a risk. At that time we installed security guards in both Albemarle Street and the undergraduate student flats.Thllre is no doubt that a bomb was deliber­ately set oiT in the Docklands one Friday evening. This is an area some ten miles from Central London -it is a redevelopment of the old ship­ping area and comprises new commercial office building and some modern housing interspersed with small Blements of the original environment. But, though some undergraduates have visited Docklands in recent years as part of a field trip, the anm is nowhere near their regular haunts. 
I laving said that, of course, the bomb which exploded on the bus in Aldwych recently was aecidental so we are all aware that such things are not always planned perfectly. This sort of political dimate can also have the unfortunate efftlet of exciting some poor, misguided people who get their kicks from creating a disturbance. 
In addition to the a'~tual bombs referred to above, thflre arfl oftfln warnings of bombs which have allegedly been planted. These have pre­cisely the same effect as a genuine bomb in that the security services must treat the warning with the same seriousness as they give to an actual explosion. Train and tube stations have to be closed while they are searched; buses and other traffic are diverted, roads are closed oiT to pedes­trians and it becomes exceedingly difficult to get around the capital. This is tedious -but reassur­ing rather than something to get worried about! 
However, perhaps the most encouraging state­ment for those in the United States who are con­cerned comes from Bridget Dutile, wife of Associate Dean Dutile of the Law School and cur­rently working at the London Centre. Mrs. Dutile was interviewed on the BBC recently as an American temporarily living in London and she told the world that she felt safer in London than she does in many US cities. Bombs are horrific ­but they are few and far between compared to the level of serious crime happening all the time elsewhere. 
At NO London we had the fourth in our General Lecture Series on British Culture. Professor Brendan O'Leary addressed some 80 students from both the Arts & Letters and the Law Programmes about the present situation in Ireland. Professor O'Leary holds a Chair in Political Science at the London School of Economics, is a well-known author who is regu­larly interviewed by British, American and European broadcasting media on topics related to Northern Ireland and is also former adviser to the Labour Party on their Irish policy. The tran­script of this lecture will be available in a few days and I will be happy to send it over for publi­cation in The Observer. I believe it will prove very useful in explaining to your readers the ba~kground to the present situation and will be informative in his description of the possible sce­narios for the future. He is optimistic about the peace process and we in London are happy to join in that sentiment. 
Meanwhile, I would ask your readers not to let the present conflict influence their lives. Be con­cerned -yes, but don't change your plans. Anyone applying to come to London next year ­please carry on applying. Anyone hoping to visit during Spring Break -please come on over. We at ,the Notre Dame. London Centre are looking forward to meeting you!

An open letter to Gays, Lesbians, and friends 
Dear Editor: 

As the senior faculty participant in the ad hoc committee on gay and les­bian student needs, which submitted its report to the Vice-President for Student Affairs on February 29, I feel that I owe my colleagues and the wider communi­ty an accounting of our work, now that the committee has disbanded. This is not meant in any way to breach the confidentiality of our proceedings, which were integral to their success. but rather to offer some suggestions for a way through the impasse created by Professor O'Hara's response to our rec­ommendations. 
The "University group of gay and les­bian students facilitated by one or two members of the faculty or administra­tion" was certainly the centerpiece of our recommendations, and there is lit­tle doubt that the restrictions placed by the Vice-President on ·this group in qualifying her acceptance of this rec­ommendation will be heard as an affront to the dignity of any erstwhile participants of such a group. After speaking with her. I can appreciate her need to clarify the parameters of the group from the outset, yet must also acknowledge the devastating rhetorical effect of such clarifications. The bulk of this letter will contain suggestions for moving through that impasse. In the meantime, however, I would encourage all members of the community to focus on her reply to our recommendation 6: "that a standing committee on the needs of gay and lesbian students be created to advise the Vice-President for Student Affairs ... [and that] at least half of the committee's members should be gay or lesbian person." While this will be an appointed group, it will be chaired by Ann Firth, who showed her­self a sympathetic listener, always dis­playing forthright leadership of our group, so this committee could provide a continuing way for. th Office of S,tuctent Affairs to .lea.rn how to do what they really want to do: welcome and serve all students, including those of gay or lesbian orientation. 
Some may immediately object of my insistence that Student Affairs really wants to welcome and serve gay and lesbian students. I am convinced that they do; the problem is rather that they do not know how to do so. And here is where the initiative of the community needs to be brought to bear. (Here I will be relying on a commonplace dis­tinction in political theory between state and society: where 'state' refers to the institutional organization and structure, while 'society' refers to the cross-hatching of free associations and friendships which constitute the world in which we live our lives.) In the inter­vening year since the ill-advised action of Student Affairs last year, there has been astounding progress on campus with regard to understanding those who understand themselves to be gay or lesbian. No doubt stereotypes still abound, yet more and more people have found themselves faced with friends or family members who are gay or lesbian, and so had to re-assess their previously uninstructed attitudes. And the larger discussion has certainly facilitated this recognition. (That is why so much of our committee's report focused on creating a healthy climate orr instruction, discussion, and retreats on sexuality issues-features which were all confirmed in the University's response, and which the "standing committee" mentioned above is charged with implementing.) Yet gay and lesbian students dearly need an environment in which they can explore issues so vital to their well-being, so the question of a group remains front and center. Here is where I feel that the larger community can respond cre­atively and without delay. 
GLND/SMC has continued to function in the interim, without official recogni­
taken an initiative as well. As we lis­tened to students and faculty in our deliberations, it seems that these two groups can and will complement each other, appealing to different students at different times. If there be any competi­tion between them, it will be a test of the respect each of their participants has for "the other" to see that it be healthy and not excluding. GLND/SMC has taken conciliatory steps in the meantime, amending their constitution in appropriate ways, and it is now time for them to set aside concerns about official recognition and assume their rightful role of service to gay and les­bian students from the larger academic community, including Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross College-cer­tainly a plus for their mode of organi­zation. They can readily publicize their activities over the Internet, use their tax-free status to raise funds from gay or lesbian alumni (without fear of com­peting with the Development Office, since these funds would not otherwise be coming to the institution). and be assured of broad-based community support plus faculty and staff willing to serve as advisors. In this way, the two groups which we already have may well teach the University now to meet the needs of gay and lesbian students, and so prepare for the day in which the University may be able to issue a more wholehearted welcome. What such a strategy will assure is that the student are served, and while that ought to be the goal of both the University commu­nity and the University itself, some­times the informal groupings which constitute a community have to show the institution the way. That is where I believe we are now, and I offer these suggestions as a way to accomplish that end.

Bulls the best? A lot needs to happen Playoff-hungry Pistons

36-5 and won its second of three straight cham­
MILWAUKEE 
The greatest team ever? Not yet. 
The Chicago Bulls didn't earn that distinction just by clinching the best regular-season record in NBA history with their 70th victory of the sea­son Tuesday night. 
The debate, however, has already begun. 
"What they've done is quite a feat," coach Mike Dunleavy of the Milwaukee Bucks said after his team nearly played spoiler before losing 86­80. 
"Are they the best team ever? They've got three of the best defenders (Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman) that compare to any team ever, the best non-center rebounder ever in Rodman, the best go-to guy ever in Michael. 
"But they'd have to win a championship before comparing them to all-time teams." 
Reaching 70 victories was a goal the Bulls set early in the season and met despite the suspen­sion of Hodman. the injuries to Pippen and Luc Longley, the complaints of Toni Kukoc and the distraction of upcoming free agency for Jordan and coach Phil Jackson. 
But the big "seven-oh" doesn't make the Bulls better than the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, a team that went 69-13 in the regular season and went on to win a championship behind Jerry West, Gail Goodrich and Wilt Chamberlain. 
Or the 1967-68 Philadelphia 76ers, who were pionships. 
Basketball is still a team game, and the last team standing is the best. Chicago can finish 73­9 by winning its last three games, but the play­offs haven't started and the Bulls haven't won anything yet. 
"This puts our names in the history books, but it doesn't have the same effect as winning a championship," Jordan said. 
Jordan, who retired in 1993 after the Bulls won their third straight title, came back late last season only to play a part in the team's playoff loss to the Orlando Magic. 
His first full season back has been an absolute triumph. 
Jordan will win his eighth scoring title and almost surely will be awarded his fourth league MVP. 
Right now, though, 70 wins barely makes Jordan's top 10 list. "It depends on what accomplishments you're talking about. I've had quite a few," Jordan said. 
"My first (NBA) championship was number one. Then my national championship (at North Carolina). Then my Olympic gold medal in '84. Then the second NBA championship. Third NBA. Then the second gold medal (in '92). Draft day. 
"And then, 70 wins. 

"So as you see right now, I really won't see the importance until I can look back and say, 'Hey, man, that was a major accomplishment.'" 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
The Detroit Pistons, fighting for playoff position, felt there was more on the line Wednesday night. 
The Pistons were facing the Indiana Pacers, a team they could very well face in the first round of the playoffs, and proved a point by winning 102­93. 
"We wanted to approach this like a playoff game," said Otis Thorpe, who finished with 19 points. "There's a very good chance that we will be playing them in the first round, and we needed to establish ourselves at home. That's the biggest key to the whole thing." 
The Pacers have already clinched the third seed in the Eastern Conference, but the Pistons can finish anywhere from fourth to seventh. This victory moved them into a tie for fifth with Cleveland, a game behind New York and a game ahead of Atlanta. 
"Playing the Pistons would be a good match up," Eddie Johnson said. "We have some adjustments to make if we play them, but I'm confident that we can do that." 
Although it was always close, the Pistons led throughout the second half. 
"We played about as com­plete a game as possible tonight," Pistons coach Doug Collins said. 
"We moved the ball, we shot well and we played good de­fense." 
Detroit led 50-45 at the half, and quickly increased the mar­gin to 12 behind two 3-pointers by Allan Houston. " 
Ricky Pierce had six points in a 16-6 run that pulled the Pacers to 67-65 with 3:14 left in the third. 
Detroit called timeout, scored the next five points, and led 79­73 with 12 minutes to go. 
Indiana got as close as two, but consecutive jumpers by Joe Dumars made it 97-89 with two minutes left. 

CAMPUS MINISTRY••• •••CONSIDERATIONS 
THE END IS NEAR, AGAIN. 
For some at Notre Dame, the end is almost here. 
For some, the end is kind of frightening and for others the end is a 
relief. 
The end may not be easy for you seniors, because it will be time to say goodbye to many ofyour friends. The end may not be easy because you are not quite sure what you are going to do after graduation or during the summer. Maybe you are anxious to move on with your life. 
Near the end, it is time to really focus on what we need to do before it is all over. Maybe what you really need to do is make up with a person you have had problems with. Maybe you need to spend some time with that person who always seemed to be lonely. Maybe you need to tell somebody about how much he or she has come to mean to you. Maybe you feel the need to return to Mass or to put your faith into action a bit more. Near the end, it is time to do what we need to do in order to keep from having too many regrets. 
Near the end it is time to realize that the end brings with it a new beginning. The end ofone part ofyour life can be a time for hope, even if you do not know exactly what you are going to do. Maybe you really feel like it is time to move on with your life, putting what you are learning, in and our of the classroom, into action "out there". The end, as a new beginning, can be exciting. 
This isn't the first end in your life. It will not be the last. In a sense, we are always ending and beginning again. 
Ahhough the end is filled with work, exams and papers, let us try to take advantage of this end time. Let us make the most of the time we have to be the kind of persons we really want to be. Let us make the most of the present by being honest with friends and reaching out to those who seem to need some friends. 
Most of all, let us move on with our lives in hope for what God has in store for us at Notre Dame and "out there".

Violations lead to MSU forfeits 
By JUDY DAUBENMIER 
Associated Press 
EAST LANSING, Mich. 
Michigan State will forfeit all five of its 1994 football victories because an ineligible player was used, President M. Peter McPherson announced Wednesday. 
McPherson said NCAA regula­tions were violated by an aca­demic adviser in order to keep a player eligible and that a technical violation occurred when a Florida man gave gifts to recruits. 
But McPherson said other allegations contained in a NCAA letter of inquiry were un­founded, including that the uni­versity had demonstrated a lack of institutional control and monitoring between the 1989­90 school year and the 1994-95 school year. 
McPherson said he hoped the university's decision to forfeit the 1994 victories will head off stiffer sanctions when the NCAA infractions committee meets June 1-3. 
"There is a presumption of a bowl game when there is a major violation," he said, adding athletic scholarships also could be cut. 
The investigation into Michigan State's football pro­gram was launched in 1994 based on allegations by former football player Roosevelt Wagner. 
The university had refused to

.. 
release an NCAA letter spelling out the allegations. But Ingham County Circuit Judge Lawrence Glazer on Tuesday ordered it to do so after the Lansing State Journal, WILX-TV and WLNS­TV sued to gain access to it. 
The university already had imposed some sanctions on itself for rules violations regarding the football program, including cutting two scholar­ships. 
All of the alleged violations occurred before Nick Saban succeeded George Perles as head coach after the 1994 sea­son. 
Saban said he had informed the players of the allegations. 
"The need for this investiga­tion is very disappointing to all of us at this university," he said. 
But Saban said the probe will not be used by the team as an excuse for failure. 
"We will meet our goals and we will comply with NCAA stan­dards and adhere to the high standards Michigan State University has," he said. 
He said he "absolutely" feels that he was not tainted by any hint of scandal due to the inves­tigation. 
McPherson said he thought the university's handling of the investigation will enhance its reputation for integrity. The school has already spent more than $400,000 for an outside law firm to conduct the investi­gation, but the final tab will be much higher, he said. 
McPherson said that the NCAA has sent Perles a letter saying he was not considered a "culpable" figure in any of the violations. 
But McPherson said he

• 
thought Perles placed too much trust in some people, including academic adviser Greg Croxton. 
The forfeitures were in reac­tion to an NCAA charge that 

..,. Croxton improperly helped players stay eligible by trying to get faculty to change grades of players and encouraged a play­er to feign mental illness in order to get an extension to complete class work. 
McPherson said Croxton has been fired. There was no tele­phone listing in the Lansing area for a Greg Croxton. 
Perles told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was happy that the NCAA found he was not re­sponsible for any of the viola­tions. But he took issue with McPherson's criticism that he was too trusting. 
"I trust my wife, I trust my coaches, I trust a lot of people, you know.... That's part of my religion, love and trust," he said. 
"I can't believe anybody would criticize anybody for being a trusting soul." 
Perles said the university should not have forfeited the victories from his !list season. 
"If the NCAA was going to do it it would be one thing. I don't know why we should want to do that to our own kids," he said. 
McPherson said the situation involving the Florida man was more complex. He said Dan Calloway of Riviera Beach, Fla., was technically a representa­tive of Michigan State under NCAA rules although the uni­versity did not consider him to be its representative. 
He said Calloway had provid­ed money, travel expenses and other gifts to Michigan State re­cruits and players, in violation of NCAA rules. But McPherson said Calloway appeared to be motivated by a desire to help disadvantaged students find the best school. 
In one case, he helped a play­er get his teeth fixed and in an­other he paid for the funeral of a player's mother. 


McPherson said the university was disassociating another man from its athletics program, but could not determine if an alle­gation involving him was true. Robert Miltenberger Jr. of St. Louis was accused of providing improper benefits, including a $2,000 cash payment, to a play­er. 
McPherson said the case was five years old and the facts were hard to determine. 
The university also rejected an NCAA charge of a lack of institutional control and moni­toring of its program between 1989-90 and 1994-95 academic years. 
That stemmed from an NCAA charge that students in inde­pendent study courses in the Department of Psychology taught by Thomas Gunnings received passing grades for no work and other special treat­ment. 
McPherson said there is con­siderable reason to doubt that students received grades for no work. 
But he said Gunnings' posi­tion as an ad hoc professor in the psychology department was not renewed, although he remains on the faculty in an­other area. 
Gunnings said in a written statement that he was heart­ened by the investigation exon­erating him of NCAA violations. 
"Despite my shock at learning of the allegations, I have fully cooperated with the university in its investigation and have consistently and emphatically denied any wrongdoing."

Irish roll, Mainieri gets 400th win 
-~­

Hope for Nationals alive after Little State 
ByT. RYAN KENNEDY 
Sports W rirer 

It was only the sixth inning but many of the 359 fans on hand yesterday at Eck Field were filing out. Notre Dame had just pummeled Purdue pitching for five runs, building a 7-2 lead for starter Gregg Henebry (3-0) that would not be toppled. 
After giving up two runs early on, an emotional Henebry befuddled the Boilermakers for six innings and the Irish rolled to a 7-4 victory. But the story of the day was The Head Coach, who reached the 400th­career-win plateau. 
"I hope the next 400 come a little quicker," quipped Paul Mainieri. The humble, laid­back Mainieri deflected the praise to Henebry and Randall Brooks, whose torrid hitting continued with a 3-for-5 per­formance. 
"The guy [Brooks] gets three hits a night," said Mainieri in astonishment. 
"And most of hits of late are two-strike or two-out hits. That's the great improvement in Randall. He's an unbeliev­ably tough out." 
Indeed, the junior second baseman is hitting close to .500 with two outs. 
More amazing is the fact that last year, Brooks totaled 57 hits; with some 15 games left, he already has 54. 
"I've been hitting better be­cause of my concentration," said Brooks. ''I'm much more relaxed at the plate, just trying to put the ball in play." 
Fittingly, Brooks ignited the five-run Irish fifth with a full­count single to left field. Down 0-2 in the count, Brooks battled back for the initial spark. After

By DESIREE LEAK Sports Writer 
Little State is the biggest little track meet in Indiana. NinettHlll Division III teams from all over Indiana met at Indiana College to battle for the title of Division III State (:ham pion. 
The Saint Mary's track team was among some of the smaller schools competing this year. In spilt~ of the tough competition and harsh weather conditions, several of the Belles stood out among their competitors. 
Thn I OK, always the first racn of the day, got the Belles ofT to a good start. Freshman Carrin Ferkenhoff ran the 25 laps in :i<J: 12.00. Plaeing sec­ond. slw finished long before most of her competitors. 
Although Ferktmholl" has run the IOK competitively in only two nwnts, she has her sights snt on Nationals. 
"I'm looking forward to com­peting Saturday," Ferkenhoff said. "I only need a time of 3H:25 to provisionally qualify, so hopdully I'll make it." 
Ftlll ow distance runner, senior Michelle Wenner com­petml in the 1500M. The race began with all the athletes packed together. Yet Wenner soon left most of the field behind her. ller impressive run not only earned her second place, she ran a season best time of 5:02.77. 
"It was a great race; I had great competition," Wenner said. "I think I ran a smart race and I'm pretty pleased with my time. Now I want to get it even farther down. My goal is to break 5:00." 
Another possible National qualifier is freshman Stacy Davis. After waiting for the first two heats of women to complete the lOOM dash, Davis lowered herself into the blocks. The gun sounded and 12.67 seconds later, Davis owned the title of Women's 1OOM dash State Champion. 
Later in the day, Davis again took her place in the blocks for the 200M dash. Again she col­lected first place honors. 
Becoming State Champion in both 1OOM and 200M dashes is one more step bringing Davis closer to Nationals. 
In every outdoor meet, her speed has resulted in first place in both the lOOM and 200M dashes.

Dame rolled past Purdue, 7-4. 
reaching second on a Scott Sollmann sacrifice bunt, Brooks then scored on a single by Mike Amrhein. 
But the rout had only just begun. 
Wagner was next, golfing a blooper to center and sending Amrhein to third. Lisanti walked after homering two in­nings earlier and the bases were loaded with two out for the hot-handed J.J. Brock. Brock's paramount two-run single set the table for fresh­man Paul Turco. 
Turco put a 5-2 game out of reach with a slow roller to Purdue shortstop Ryan Cole, who, in pressure's panic, whizzed an errant fastball to first. 
Suddenly, Turco was headed to second on the error and the Irish were up 7-2. 
Henebry kept the Boilers off balance until the eighth inning, when he began to struggle and allowed two runs. But the lefty was unphased and determined to stay in and get the job done, despite occasionally walking around the infield punching his glove in frustration. While Mainieri would have normally pulled a pitcher in this situa­tion, he knew this one belonged to Henebry. 
"I still felt strong and I didn't want to leave the game," said Henebry. 
"I also lost last year against Purdue and wanted a little revenge." 
"I stuck with Greg because he's been there so many times before," asserted Mainieri. "I've got a lot of confidence in the kid. He's pitched some big games for us. " 
As for his own mark, Mainieri noted: "That lthe 400th) only puts me 612 behind my dad." Mainieri's father, the legendary Demie Mainieri, racked up 1,012 wins as head coach at Miami-Dade North Community College.

about competing with the Hurricanes. 
"Playing in the Big East gives us a chance to play Miami. They are probably not as good as us this year, but they have a great coach and a great recruiting class. From here on in they will be NCAA championship contenders." 
After the Irish and the Hurricanes the top teams in the conference are the Friars of Providence, the St. John's Redmen, and the Georgetown Hoyas as they make up the rest of the top seeded teams. 
Senior captain Mike Sprouse spoke about com­peting in the Big East. 
"It gives us a chance to play in a new confer­ence with different competition. We get out of the Midwest and it will give us a more national look." 
Along with more exposure, the tournament can provide the Irish with much more than just a conference title. Playing in the warm southern 
Florida climate may better prepare them for postseason play. 
"Playing in the hot weather could give us and advantage in the regionals if we get a hot day in May," Sprouse added. 
"The teams in our region are probably not pre­pared for that weather." 
Moreover, another advantage of the tourna­ment is the simple fact that it gives the squad three more matches under their belt before NCAA tournament action. 
"It is a good opportunity because we will be playing a lot of matches," junior Ryan Simme stated. "It is a new experience with new teams." 
Sophomore Jakub Pietrowski concurred, "We will get a couple of good matches. Miami should give us a pretty good match and we haven't seen any of these teams before." 
"This experience is all new for us," Bayliss noted. "We don't know what level of play to ex-

pect." 

Some possible concerns about the expected championship match between the Irish and Hurricanes are that the match is in their back­yard and outdoors. 
The Hurricanes have had more experience out­doors this year, but the Irish do not seem to be phased by that fact 
"We have been practicing outdoors and we lost a close match to a very good Texas team," Pietrowski mentioned. 
"I don't think it (playing outdoors) will be that big of a factor. Overall we are a good outdoor team." 
"Most of the guys prefer playing outdoors." 
Teammate Ryan Simme agreed, "Miami may have a little advantage because it is outdoors and at their place. But, I think we may be a better outdoor team." 
Perhaps, the best aspect of this tournament is that it presents a chance for the Irish to get back on the winning track. 
The Irish have lost their last two matches to Texas and Michigan. In addition, they are com­ing off their worst loss of the year, a 7-0 spank­ing by the Wolverines. 
Simme said, "Hopefully, it will build our confi­dence." 
Pietrowski pointed out that, "We're happy we are in the tournament. It could give us momen­tum going into Regionals and it would be a good way to finish the regular season." 
Sprouse agrees of the importance of the tour­nament, but he notes that Regionals are several weeks after the Big East tournament. 
He explained, "Right now it is really important for us to win, especially with the Michigan loss." 
So, now the Irish have a clear goal for the weekend, winning the conference title. Bayliss explained what a title could do for the team. 
"It would be a big shot in the arm, for us to win. I think this team has underachieved this year, but now a new goal is present." 
That goal is simply their first Big East Tennis Championship.

finals. 

"Our ultimate goal is to beat Miami in the finals, in front of the hometown crowd," stated Marisa Velasco. 
"More than anything, we just want to win the tournament," stated head coach Jay Louder back. 
Besides winning every match, the team's goal is to focus on winning doubles, according to Louderback. The team lately has had trouble finishing off their opponents, and by secur­ing the doubles point early on, there will be less tension. 
"The key is to clinch the dou­bles point early so we can re­lieve some of the pressure," stated Velasco. "If we win the point it will allow us the chance to start the singles with more confidence." 
Senior Sherri Vitale will be making her debut for the team, after a two and a half month hiatus, due to a wrist injury suffered against Northwestern. Vitale will make her appear­ance most likely at No. 3 dou­bles. She has been practicing this past week, and is ready to play. 
"I am more excited than ner­vous," stated Vitale, "It had been a tough two and a half months watehing." 
The doubles line-up will re­main the same. Seniors Wendy Crabtree and Holyn Lord will play at the top spot. 
page 19 
Junior Erin Gowen and fresh­man Jennifer Hall are more than prepared to show their stufl' at the No. 2 doubles spot. Hounding out the top three will be Velasco and sophomore Kelley Olson. 
The singles line-up will re­main the same. Hall will get the start at the No. 1 position. In the second spot, Lord is tak­ing the challenge. Crabtree will be playing at the third position, and Velasco will get the nod at the fourth spot. 
The final two positions will be filled by Gowen and sophomore Molly Gavin. 
Louderback stated, "We might sit out either Gowen. Crabtree, and Velasco, because they are injured. We want to give them a rest. and save them for the later rounds." 
The Irish are the odds on fa­vorite to take the title, but the Miami Hurricanes are looking to upset them. 
Also, third-ranked Seton Hall and fourth-ranked Boston College should not be ruled out according to Louderback. "Both Seton Hall and Boston College should not be ruled out," stated Louderback. "Both of the teams have some of the top players. If the rest of their team is having a good day, then the~. will definitely be an obsta­cle. 
Barring any unforeseen ob­stacles, the Irish will claim yet another first. their first Big East championship. The team wants to not only claim the title, but gear up for the NCMs.

Physical, 'bare essential' play provides for colorful day on courts 
Seeded teams advance, losers go out in style 
By BETSY BAKER 
Spons Writer 
and KATHLEEN LOPEZ Spons Writer 
Some teams make their mark in Bookstore Basketball history by what they wear. 
Others will be remembered for what they don't wear. 
Such is the case for the team Dos Goldkamps Sans Pants, whose 21-13 loss to You Have Problems and Everyone Knows It will not be remembered for its sharp passes, fast breaks, or easy baskets. Instead, fans will recall the game in which Seth and Jacob Goldkamp stripped the game of Bookstore down to its barest form -literally. The two brothers showed up to play in nothing but athletic support­ers, hence the name Dos Goldkamps Sans Pants. Although their team's efforts were frustrated by You Have Problems, their performance drew quite a crowd and carved their name in the Bookstore tree forever. 
The Goldkamps stated their unorthodox motives behind the attire as more than just an in­timidation factor. 
"We've been going to the tan­
ning booth lately and for sani­
tary reasons, we've been reluc­
tant to take of our pants so we 
haven't received the full effect," 
Seth explained. 
"We saw a sunny day and de­
cided to seize the opportunity." 
Dos Goldkamps' was not the 
only performance that captured 
the crowd's attention yesterday. 
Peanuts' performance against 
an impressive All the 
President's Men, once again 
minus the President, Fr. 
Edward Malloy, entertained 
both the crowd and their oppo­
nents despite a 21-9 loss. The 
spandex-clad Peanuts' game 
plan included such plays as the 
Hokey-Pokey, the Chicken 
Dance, both with musical inter­
ludes, and the Duck-Duck­
Goose play. 
The no. 27 All the President's 
Men, who boast such members 
as D'Juan Francisco, a member 
of the 1988 National 

Championship Football team; Lou Nanni, 1984 Mr. Bookstore turned director of the Center for the Homeless and Nathan Hatch, Dean of the Graduate School and Vice-president of the University, might have been mentally stirred but showed no signs of distraction in their play. 
"We feel fortunate to have won," Nanni, who even stopped and joined in on the Hokey­Pokey play, said of the victory. "The spirit, enthusiasm, and creativity of our opponent was paralyzing at times." 
"Fortunately, we pulled it out in the end." 
When asked if the namesake of the team, Fr. "Monk" Malloy, will be making an appearance soon, Nanni commented opti­mistically, "I hope so, but his schedule is really busy." 
"Both teams that we have been played have been real cooperative about the schedul­ing," Nanni added. "They have been great." 
In ranked action, the four­teenth-seeded Unusual Suspects knocked off Four Guys Who Can't Play Ball and One Who Sucks, 21-5, while no. 20 Hood River Bandits romped the St. Joe River Bandits, 21-2. 
"This is the first time that we have played together because of a couple injuries," Hood River Bandit Kevin Sanger com­mented. 
"It was a good game and they have a good name." No. 32 L-Train was also 

victorious,  defeating  Dr.  
Quasimodo  to  Proctology,  
STAT, 21-7.  

However, the best was saved for last as Zeus, Apollo, and Three Others Who Appear to be Mere Mortals defeated G'bols and the Whalers in the closest and most physical matches of the day. 
Under the lights at Stepan courts with a boisterous crowd, G'bols made a strong come­back, after falling behind early, before falling to Zeus, Apollo, and Co. 22-20. 
Kevin Shields. a member of G'bols, commented on the ex­citing game. 
"I was just happy to be part of such a great game," Shields said. "Obviously, we are disap­pointed, but they are a good team." 
Shields' teammate Greg Borkowski credited the crowd support with their comeback effort. 


"It was all the crowd," Borkowski added. "That was the best part." 
UP AND COMING: 

Some Bookstore fans only focus on the top-ranked teams, while others seek out the lesser known. 
One of those lesser known teams made their presence known as they rallied from a considerable deficit to claim a victory. 
Yesterday, the Hoopin' Gandhis took on Black Lung in an intense match-up behind the Bookstore. 
Black Lung definitely had the height advantage inside, but the Gandhis had a big man of their own in C.J. Howard. 
Howard, who runs the 400 and 800 meter for the track team, carried the weight of the team on his shoulders, and lift­ed them to a 21-18 win. 
Howard amazed the small 

crowd with his skills. He could 
drive the lane, or fire from the 
outside. 
On fast-breaks, his speed and 

agility made his opponents look 
like revolving doors. as their 
heads could merely turn in time 
to catch Howard going in for 
the finish. 
Howard's fellow teammates 

all chipped in for the victory as 
well. 
Freshman Russ Chiapetta and 

Brian Fremeau stepped up 
their play in the second half, as 
they both came up with nu­
merous steals to secure the 
win. 
Also freshman Andres "Big 

Country" Arredondo managed 
to sink a few fade-aways. 
Howard was the key to the 

victory, and he definitely is a 
player to be on the lookout for. 
He had this to state about his 

second-half performance: "My 
comeback was all part of the 
plot." 
The Hoopin' Gandhis are 

going to be tough for any team 
to handle, especially with 
Howard leading the team.

PE has three main attractions:

PPE integrates different approaches to foundational issues in political justice in a way not usually possible merely with a second major (and also requires many fewer courses than a second major); 

• 
PPE students interact closely with faculty members, in courses as well as less formally in advising and conversation (the student/faculty ratio in seminars and colloquia is about 10:1 ); 

• 
PPE students develop an intellectual community among themselves, especially through the justice Seminar, PPE's intensive gateway seminar.
