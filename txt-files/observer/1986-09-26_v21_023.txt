House passes historic tax revision legislation 
The president of the Northeast 


WASHINGTON -The House of 
Representatives voted 292-136 
yesterday for landmark legisla­
tion that would change the way 
most Americans pay their in­
come taxes while shifting a big 
share of the burden to corpora­
tions. 
The bill was hailed as the most thorough income-tax revision ever. The political breakdown: I 76 Democrats and I 16 Republicans voted yes; 74 Democrats and 62 Republicans voted no, with many of them ex­pressing concern about the bill's impact on an economy plagued by sluggish growth. 
I t1e margin of victory for the measure was more overwhelm­ing than even its staunchest sup­porters had predicted. Some had forecast it would pass by 30 to 50 votes. 
rinal Senate action this week 
or next would send the bill to 
President Reagan for his signa­
ture. That would mark the end 
of a two-year fight for an issue 
Reagan put at the top of his 
second-term agenda. 
White House spokesman Larry 
Speakes said Reagan "welcomes 
today's vote by the t1ouse." 
'The country is now only one vote away in the Senate from enacting the president's number one domestic priority -a tax sys­tem that will promote economic growth, simplify tax returns for the vast majority of Americans, return the code to a promise of fairness and equity, and most important of all, reduce rates for most Americans," Speakes said. 
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-111., a chief author of the bill, said, "We are going to let the American people know that their legislative process is working. that when they request of their leaders in Washington a change, that we respond." 

The legislation, he added, responds to a public demand "that the family down the street or the corporation across town can't beat the system any longer." 
"We must not pass up this his­toric opportunity to make a con­tribution to those elements ofthe 
American  economy  that  have  
long  been  neglected:  the  
working poor,  the family,  labor  
and  capital,"  said  Rep.  Jack  
Kemp, R-N.Y.  

"This is the most sweeping tax­reform legislation in the llistory of this nation," Speaker Tllomas O'Neill, D-Mass., said in closing the debate. "If we pass this bill, the 99th Congress will assume a 

AA hosts special meetings on game days 
By REGIS COCCIA Copy t:clitor 
On every home football weekend, ther Notre Dame Alunmi Association hosts a meet­ing of Alcoholics Anonymous at the Center for Social Concerns. 
The special group meeting was inaugurated this year after the Alumni Association sponsored an Alcoholics Anonymous ses­sion at the annual reunion last June, according to Charles Len­non, executive director of the Alumni Association. 
Alcoholics Anonymous is an organization dedicated to hel­ping men and women with drink­ing problems. 
"People suggested having AA meetings during the football season," a local member of Al­coholics Anonymous said. The member said the meetings have been very successful. Alcoholics Anonymous maintains a strict policy of anonymity for all its members. 
The meeting at the center's multi-purpose room convenes every home game Saturday at 
9:30 a.m. 
The Alumni Association pro­vides the meeting place for members of the Alcoholics Anonymous fellowship and as a convenience for alumni, accor­ding to Lennon. "We're more than happy to provide the ser­
vice," lennon said. 
"Alcoholics Anonymous is not afftliated with any other organi­zation." a local member said. "AA is a fellowship of men and wo­men who share their experi­ence, strength and hope with each other," the member said. 

Joining Alcoholics Anonymous is simple, according to a local member. "The only requisite for membership is a desire to stop drinking." the member said. Anyone interested in becoming an AA member can attend a meeting where he can share his problems with others. 
Although the special meeting at the Center for Social Concerns is open only to members of Al­coholics Anonymous, a local member said, there are weekly meetings in South Bend open to the public. The member said

Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Bradford Warren said yesterday that the federal government should legalize drugs from laetrile to heroin rather than using taxpayer dollars in anti-drug campaigns. "Many drugs aren't good for us, but the war (on drugs) is worse," said Warren, an Indianapolis attorney. Because drugs are illegal. dealers can command high prices for them and pile up large profits, he said. The high prices also lead to crime by drug users and the high profits attract innocent people to the drug trade, Warren said. If illicit drugs were legalized, the government could gain tax revenue from their sale, he said. He said that new revenue should go "not to (drug) treatment programs, but should be dedicated to reduce taxes." -Associated Press

Overemphasis on winning can throw fun for a big loss 
I laced up my old cleats, threw on my dirty sweatshirt and loosened up my arm. Yes, I was ready for my first section football game of the year. 
The purpose of these autumn contests, I always thought, was to have some fun tossing the old pigskin around, meet some guys from the other sections, and maybe get a little exercise to boot. 
By halftime, however, I realized everyone else was playing for a different reason. 
TO WIN. 

As the second half progressed each team be­came even more intent upon winning. Self­appointed leaders began rudely ordering their section-mates around like a drill sergeant ordering a Marine recruit. 
A rough push here and a mild dispute over pass interference there soon had the players on each team angry with one another. 
Anger quickly turned into a bad argument over a touchdown, and the argument nearly led to a fight between two players. One of them had to be restrained. 
What happened to a little fun and exercise? What happened to meeting a few guys from the other section and throwing the football around a little? 
This wasn't the first time I had participated in a section game or even a pick-up game at the Rock that started out as an amicable contest be­tween friends and ended with a heated argument. 
I couldn't help asking myself why these people were taking a silly little football game so seriously. What could cause people to get into fights over a game that was supposed to be fun? Is this what some people call fun? 
Winning is very important to some people. This includes winning at any sort of competitive event, even one that may seem trivial, according to Notre Dame Professor of Psychology Delia Saenz. 
Saenz said that in our society, winning is equiv­alent to success, and success is an important con­tributor to our self-esteem. She said people relate their self-esteem to achievement. 
People are raised to value different things, said 

Saenz. Some people are raised to believe grades 
are important, some that social situations are im­
portant and others, like some of the players at 
the section footbal game, that sports ability is 
important. 
As a freshman I remember being told, at one 

of those exhilarating orientation speeches, that 
80 percent ofthe Notre Dame student body earned 
a varsity letter in high school. If this is true then 
I would be willing to bet there are a lot of Notre 
Dame students who value their sports ability. 
Saenz said if people value their sports ability 

highly, they will be very competitive in sports. 
"Someone highly competitive will always seek to 
succeed. Competitive people relate their ability to 
their self-esteem," she said. 
The value of success is very high at colleges,

or any other place that stresses achievement, said Saenz. She cited examples where notebooks and advance copies of tests were stolen to increase the chance for success. 
Although notebooks occasionally are stolen un­der the watchful eyes of Our Lady, Saenz said she thinks the moral factor of religion at Notre Dame curbs some of the competi~ion for grades seen at other schools. "The pre-occupation with cut­throat competition may be tempered by religion," she said. 
Saenz added the drive for success could even cause people to commit suicide if they value something too much and then fail to achieve suc­cess at it. 
Not everyone is raised to believe success is the ultimate achievement. Saenz said some people are raised to believe that enjoying an event such as a football game is more important than win­ning. 
She said it is best for a person to have a com­bination between being very competitive and simply enjoying an event. "If people are too com­petitive then, they will get too involved in winning and lose out on the fun of an event," she said. 
Maybe the students playing section football can remember this the next time they get ready to start a fight over six points.

Ethanol plant may ·get $8.5 million 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND A government­supported ethanol plant pinched by a sharp drop in prices and denied further subsidy by the Legislature, may receive $8.5 million from a settlement paid the state by Exxon Corp., officials said yesterday. 
The proposal announced by Lt. Gov. John Mutz must win the ap­proval of the federal Department of Energy. 
Use of the $50 million paid In­diana by Exxon to settle an over­charging case is restricted by federal legislation. 
South Bend's $186 million et­hanol plant, built and operated by New Energy Co. of Indiana, began production two years ago, aided by a $10.89 million ap­propriation from the General As­sembly. The ethanol is mixed with gasoline to form gasohol. a mixture that boosts octane rating of unleaded gasoline. 
But falling world oil prices caused the price of ethanol to drop 60 cents in 1986 to well below $1 a gallon, company Chief Executive Officer Donald Evans said. Earlier this year, the Legislature killed a measure that would have provided an addi­tional $7.8 million subsidy for the venture. 
"This is one of those situations that is marginal at the present time," Mutz said as a partial jus­tification for the additional money. 


In an annual report filed with the Federal Securities and Ex· change Commision, New Energy said the lower 1986 prices "have greatly limited the ability of the company to profitably produce and market ethanol." 
But Evans said the plant is producing 60 million gallons a year, exceeding its rate capacity of 52.5 million gallons, and is current with its debt payments. "We aren't prospering, but we are meeting all our obligations," he said. 
The $8.5 million payment, if approved, would be given as a grant to be repaid only if New Energy becomes profitable, Mutz said. The money would be used to help meet payments on a $14 I million federally guaranteed loan, Mutz said. The company is renegotiating to ex­
tend  the life of the loan  to  13  
years  from  the  present  eight  
years.  
"The  plant  will  be  self­ 

sufficient after this round of help," Evans said. 


Soviets still hold Daniloff as Shultz seeks agreement 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS -Soviet officials yesterday considered a two-stage U.S. proposal to let American newsman Nic­holas S. Daniloff leave Mos­cow, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz left the door open for another meeting with the Soviet foreign minister. 
"We're working on it," Shultz said In between meetings with foreign minis­ters attending a special U.N. General Assembly session. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze held his own series of talks, and told reporters while posing for photographs with French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac: "the less noise the bet­ter. We continue to work in a calm atmosphere." 
Shultz and Shevardnadze met twice Tuesday. One U.S. oftlcial said yesterday that the negotiations were "active," and that Shultz might see Shevardnadze again. 
The Reagan administration proposal would let Daniloff leave Moscow while Soviet physicist Oennadl Zakharov Is tried In Brooklyn on spy charges. If Zakharov Is con­victed, he would be ex· changed for an unspecified number of Soviet dissidents. 
Administration officials publicly refuse to equate the Danlloff and Zakharov cases, saying the U.S. News & World Report correspondent is inno­cent. They also rule out any trade. But privately, they ac­knowledge the proposal has been put to the Soviets for consideration. 
Shevardnadze said earlier yesterday that "we have given good proposals" to the Americans. "They must think about them."

Over the next five years, cor­

The legislation, said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., will hurt eco­nomic growth, savings, job crea­tion, exports, U.S. competitive­ness, housing, education and charity. Rep.

ated with the bad outweigh hoped-for benefits of the good." 
Archer tried to have the bill sent back to the Senate and House negotiators who produced the final compromise -a move that probably would have killed it. He was defeated, 268­160. 
"This bill poses no threat to the economy," Rostenkowski told the House. "About the only people I haven't heard from are those people this bill does the most for low-and middle-income families. They are the men and women to whom we must make our case, no matter which way we vote." 
"The loss of tax provisions favoring capital income may lead to a decline in investment as farmers and small businessmen choose to repair, rather than to replace equipment and build new plants," said Rep. Edward Madigan, .R-111., echoing economists who testified before a congressional panel. 
Sponsors said the lower cor­porate rates and generous depreciation system in the bill would be sufficient incentive for business to invest. Anti-tax shel­ter features would free for pro­ductive use money that now is invested to avoid tax rather than turn a profit, backers say.

INDIANAPOLIS A local com­pany is offering a IS-minute honesty test for businesses that want to screen job applicants for trustworthiness and drug use. 
Carl Cohen, president of CIC enterprises, said "The Integrity Interview" was developed by 16 lawyers, psychologists, business consultants and linguists. 
The client is instructed to have the job applicant call CIC on a toll-free Indianapolis number to take the test. 
A CIC operator takes down such information as the appli­cant's name, age, sex and Social Security number, and then turns on a small cassette recorder. Ap­plicants respond to the taped questions with "yes," "no" or a number. 

The simplified format makes the test understandable to nearly everyone, Cohen said. 
"People can't read anymore," he said. "But they can still listen. We gave this test to sixth-graders and they understood itvery well." 
The test is designed for those seeking entry level positions, Cohen said.

Soviets honor three Chemobyl firefighters for heroism 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW The Soviet lJnion yesterday bestowed its highest honors for heroism on three firefighters at the Chernobyl. nu­clear plant who battled flames at the No. 4 reactor and prevented a greater nuclear disaster. 
Two of the firefighters, Viktor Kibenok and Vladimir Pravik, died of radiation sickness. The government newspaper Izvestia printed a picture of the surviving firefighter, Major Leonid Telyat­nikov, on the front page beside official decrees naming them Heroes of the Soviet lJnion. 
Telyatnikov, who was pictured in Soviet media in May with a full head of hair, was bald in the lz­vestia photograph. 
Doctors treating victims of the April 26 Chernobyl disaster, which has claimed .31 lives to date by official count have said hair loss is a common conse­quence of exposure to massive radiation doses. 
Radiation from Chernobyl spread across several European countries and large areas of the Soviet lJnion. The losses to the Soviet economy from the dis­aster have been estimated by the Soviets at the equivalent of nearly $.3 billion. 
The announcement that three men had been honored as heroes was made a day after the newspaper Literary Gazette carried a major article that 
criticized bureaucratic bungling. 
selection of the site and other 
shortcomings as contributing to 
the disaster at Chernobyl. 
The decrees honoring Telyat­nikov, Pravik and Kibenok said they had been awarded the gold stars given to heroes in the So­viet lJnion for "courage, heroism and selnessness." 
Soviet television also an­nounced the awards, showing photographs of the three firefighters in their uniforms before the Chernobyl disaster. 
Telyatnikov was also shown in what the television said was a May interview in a Moscow hospi­tal. He was much thinner than in the earlier photograph and his hair was almost gone. 

The television commentator apologized that TV could not show pictures of the reactor fire on April 26 and said film shot then was spoiled by radiation. 
For the first time, television showed a diagram of the plant which made clear that its four reactors are at each corner of a rectangular machine hall con­taining the turbine generators powered by steam from the re­actors. 
The roof of the building housing the No. 4 reactor was ablaze when Kibenok and Pravik arrived at the scene, the televi­sion commentator reported. 
"The most terrible thing was that the fire was threatening the machine hall ... with all the tur­bines" and could have spread to the No. .3 reactor, the television said. 
Like other media accounts, it said Telyatnikov, Kibenok and Pravik prevented the blaze from engulfing the No . .3 reactor and nearby oil storage tanks. 
The youth newspaper Kom­somolskaya Pravda on May 16 gave a vivid account of how Pravik and Kibenok arrived to fight the blaze minutes after No. 4 reactor had been ripped open by an explosion. 
Kibenok, Pravik and Telyat­nikov were honored in a story in 
Izvestia  with  the  headline,  
"Thank  You,  Heroes  of Cher­ 
nobyl."

Media given mixed review by Americans 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Many Americans have serious reserva­tions about how the news media report terrorist incidents, but people also think news organi­zations do a goodjob ofcovering major events like airplane hUack­lngs, said a survey released yes­terday. 
These mixed feelings toward the news media were broughtout In a Gallup Organization poll commissioned by the Times Mir­ror, a Los Angeles-based media organization. 
"Americans are of two minds about press-related Issues," Gal­lup PresidentAndrew Kohut said. "They give the news media high marks on overall performance, but sharply lower grades on spe­cific press practices." 
On specific stories, 84 percent of the respondents who followed the news said the media did a good or excellent job covering the January explosion of the space shuttle Challenger; 80 per­cent felt that way about the TWA flight 847 hostage crisis In Beirut; 80 percent approved of coverage of the Achille Lauro hUacklng In the Medlterrean; 79 percent thought the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was handled well, and 71 percent approved the reporting of the Pan Ameri­can World Airways hUacklng In Pakistan earlier this month. 
Still, many Americans seem disturbed by the role the media plays In terrorist Incidents, the poll said. 
For Instance, 51 percent of Americans said the news media give terrorist Incidents too much attention, while 40 percent said the coverage is about right. But 56 percent said the news media give terrorists too much oppor­tunity to promote their cause. 

The findings were based on telephone Interviews with 1,504 people In July. Gallup said there Is an error rate of .3 percent. 
In a separate quiz, 776 people were interviewed In September about the case of Nicholas Danlloff, the U.S. News l!1 World Report Moscow correspondent who has been arrested and charged with spying In the Soviet lJnlon. That survey had an error rate of 4 percent. 
The poll showed 7.3 percent of Americans have followed the Danlloff case closely. Twenty­four percent thought there was "no chance whatsoever'' that Danlloff was a spy; .34 percent said "only a very small chance," 22 percent. "somewhat of a chance," and 10 percent. "a good chance." The remainder did not answer the question.

Pro-life movement becomes ecumenical concern 
Catholics should show a preferential option for the poor, the weak, the downtrodden, the oppressed, the victims of injustice. A Catholic campus is a place where this message should be consis­tently proclaimed and lived by both stu­dents and faculty. The Notre Dame 
Janet Smith 
guest column 
campus has distinguished itself by its commitment to many causes fully in keeping with the teachings of Christ. Ex­amples abound: there spring to mind several recent projects emanating from Notre Dame or having the clear support of Notre Dame: settlement of refugees, caring for the homeless, Dismas House (which eases the transition back into so­ciety for prisoners), and currently the ef­forts to establish a Catholic Worker's House. I suspect it would take several pages even to approach a comprehensive list of the range of volunteer activities pursued by individuals on this campus; surely there are few if any campuses where so many do so much. 
Those who undertake to live out their witness to Christian love by attending to the needs of others soon find they are tested in their willingness to make the generous sacrifices of time and money required; they are challenged to per­severe in the face of discouraging set­backs; often they have to endure the scorn of others who do not share their commitments. 

Involvement in the pro-life movement is a cause which certainly requires all of the above from its advocates. The enor­mity of the evil perpetuated by the legalization of abortion simply staggers the imagination; the killing of over a mil­lion and a half babies each year calls for the most energetic opposition possible, but makes it difficult to sustain the hope that one can succeed. And most pro-lifers must endure harsh judgements of their motives; they are regularly considered 'judgemental" and "insensitive to the needs of the poor" -the list goes on. I will not go into the treatment which pro­lifers receive from the media, but suffice it to note that they have been so success­ful in portraying pro-lifers as right-wing, fanatical, narrowminded Catholics, that it took nearly a decade for many Protestants to recognize that pro-life is their cause, too, and for many liberals to assert their characteristic compassionate commit­ment to the rights of the weak and to the needs of women with problem preg­nancies. 
Times are, thankfully, changing; the pro-life movement is quite thoroughly ecumenical at this point and liberals are joining the ranks. For instance, the group "Pro-lifers for Survival," an anti-nuclear, anti-abortion group, has been growing steadily in recent years; more and more feminists are declaring themselves against abortion (see Sidney Callahan's article in Commonweal, April 1986 and the article by Jenny Ernest Soley in the October 1986 issue of Sojourners). 
Surely opposition to abortion ought not to be limited by religious affiliation or political idealogies; protecting the lives of the unborn should be the job of all Christians -and any others who believe in the protection of the rights to the in­nocent. So, too, ought Christians -and others -give generous support to women needing their assistance to carry their babies to term. 
Many in this community have done so. Space here allows me to mention only a few, but the Notre Dame and the South Bend communities are home to several individuals who have made-and continue to make -significant contributions to the pro-life cause; Father James Burtchaell, 
Prof.  Charles Rice,  Charles McCollister,  
Professor  Donald  Kommers,  Virginia  
Black,  Mary Hunt,  John  Connaughton,  

Brother John Lavalle, Glen and Betty Ter­ry, and Mary Anne Hughes. These indi­viduals have served in many capacities: they have written books, done public speaking, founded and served in local and national organizations, and given enormously of themselves for others. 
And the commitment of the students on these two campuses has been remark­able. The Right to Life Group each year tries to keep the campus informed of life issues and has been the chief inspiration and support behind the Women's Care Center, an organization which has as­sisted thousands of women. Several stu­dents, too, have gone on to set up such Centers in their home communities: the good work spreads! 
Janet Smith is an assistant professor in the Program of Liberal Studies.

dents ofall time. My question to you, as educated, concerned people, is: WHY? Why Is Ronald Reagan so popular? His positions on major Issues are question­able at best. If you support Reagan and would like to see him run for a third term, please listen to what I have to say. Then, ifyou still support him, you may proceed and attempt to repeal the twenty-second amendment to allow him to run again. 
' Ronald Reagan, in effect, supports nu­clear proliferation. 
Nuclear proliferation Is the single fast­est way to ensure the extinction of mankind. As It stands now, we have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world many times over. The more weap­ons there are, the greater the chance of one being used. 5o why does Reagan con­tinue to build moreweapons? Good ques­tion. Instead of trying to end production

The Soviet Union has observed a test ban for a year now and has urged the United States to join them. Reagan refused. Ronald Reagan continues to push closer to nuclear war. 
 Ronald Reagan does not support harsh economic sanctions against South Africa. 
Reagan seems to think P.w. Botha will see the light through gentle nudging. Why does he think a man who has no qualms about arresting and detaining people for the fun of It would respond to a gentle nudge? Good question. The only way Botha is going to get the message is through harsh economic sanctions. He can't do much without money. Construc­tive engagement claims that by making the businesses In South Africa uphold the Sullivan Principles, It helps the blacks more than It harms them. Sure, our money doesn't harm blacks directly, but consider this: the companies must pay taxes to the South African government. I am sure the boys In Pretoria do not spend that tax money on low Income housing for blacks. I am also sure that some of 
this  money  winds  up  paying  for  the  
policemen  who  round  up  the  
demonstrators  against apartheid.  The  

claim that Japan or West Germany would simply step In with their money after we leave falls short. We do have considerable Influence with these countries. I am sure a few choice words from Washington would be enough to persuade them to take their business elsewhere. Reagan continues to silently condone apartheid. 
 Ronald Reagan supports, encourages and demands giving $100 million to Nicaragua. 
Giving money to Nicaragua is the first step toward repeating the greatest mis­take in our country's history. Vietnam began the same way: with military aid. What followed were advisors, troops and chaos. Why hasn't Reagan learned from our own mistake? Good question. Sen­ding that much money to Nicaragua is like lighting the fuse on a stick of dynamite. If $100 million isn't enough to overthrow the present government, Reagan will probably send In advisors. And Ifthat doesn't work, troops will arrive to protect the advisors. After that, fighting could begin. If the people of Nicaragua want a new government, they will decide for themselves. Ifthere is enough unrest, the government will fall. That is the way It has happened throughout time. An­other country inciting the unrest is flat out wrong. Reagan continues to pour gasoline on the spark that Is Nicaragua. 
 Ronald Reagan does not supportgiving flnanclal aid to troubled American farm­ers. 
The plight of the American farmer has gotten so bad that distraught farmers have taken to violence to call attention to the problem. In the headlines recently, a man from Georgia committed suicide In an attempt to save his farm through his life Insurance. There have been murder­suicides involving bank employees trying to foreclose on farms. Why doesn't Reagan do something substantial to help these people? Good question. The Amer­Ican farm community Is the backbone of the nation. To Ignore their desperate cry for help Is a crime. Maybe Reagan should take some ofthe moneyspenton building nuclear weapons and build our farms back up instead. Or perhaps he should take some of that money going to Nicaragua and use It to help our own farmers, or divest the money from South Africa and Invest it in our farmers instead. Reagan continues to Ignore the plight of the American farmer. 
Ronald Reagan has been a popular president because he has told the people what they wanted to hear. Things like the war on drugs, an enlivened economy and simpler tax laws are well and fine, but greater problems exist. Reagan really concentrates on telling us all about the good things he has done but sidesteps the issues I have mentioned. Reagan sup­porters tell me, "Look at all he has donef" Fine, he has done a good job on a few things. I would like to tell the Reagan supporters, "Look at all he hasn't donef" Reagan's stands on the Issues I have raised are questionable at best. 
Well, there you have it. I am sure I will nowbe labeled a "commie-loving, idealis­tic, no-good, Massachusetts democrat". I have simply attempted to point out where Reagan stands on the major Issues ofour time". Ifall you "patriotic, realistic, loyal Republicans" can look at yourself In the mirror and say, "I love Ronnie despite his stands on the major issues", then your name truly does belong on the guest list at his coronation -oh, excuse me -in­auguration, In 1988.

Bad SYR experience is not reason to cancel all 
Dear Editor: 
Though I may disagree with many of the stances taken by students on articles they have written, none have yet annoyed me to the point that I have felt I should write back in response. Lou 5arabando's article on Tuesday did just that. 
I find it quite disturbing, first of all, that 

he based a major portion of his article 
on an argument with just one friend. I 
believe his name was Chris. Using Chris' 
views on alcohol, Lou then proceeded to 
hold the majority of this campus to the 
same view. I'm sorry to intrude upon his 
obviously cynical opinion of the "Domer 
mentality'' but there are many of us who 
do go to SYR's for reasons other than 
getting "drunk. sloshed, blitzed, 
whatever you call it" -as Lou's friend Chris 
so brilliantly put it. 
I am not saying that Lou's observations 

since his freshman year on SYR's are com­
pletely unfounded. Yes, there will always 
be a certain number of students who will 
abuse their privileges at SYR's, but I also 
k11ow that there are a good many who 
will not. 
I presume from the tone of the article 

that Lou has been only to one, or perhaps 
no SYR's. And if he has been to at le.ast 
one, this was probably in his own dorm 
as well. This extensive experience with 
SYR's then, does make Lou an authority 
on what occurs at "all" SYR's on campus, 
doesn't It? 
We are going to have a good time at 

SYR's this year. And no, Lou, we won't 
even "vomit" on your bathroom tloorl We 
are going, not all with the sole purpose 
of getting drunk. but rather to spend the 
time with friends, meet others, dance, 
and forget about the pressures of studies 
for an evening. 
Some of us "Class A jerks, " yes the 

"boys and girls" of Notre Dame, as he 
put it, do more with our weekends and 
SYR's than just look to them as a means 
to get drunk!

Theology professor is not treated justly 
Dear Editor: 
I have been literally sick at heart since reading of the treatment that Dr. Bill Storey has recently received from the Uni­versity. While not pretending to know the details of how this situation developed, I know enough to judge that restricting Professor Storey's academic interaction with Notre Dame is inexcusable -and In­credulous. 
How can a professor who has given so much of himself to this University, and especially to the Theology Department, be so callously "waved off?" His gift of many years is being suddenly rejected, cruelly thrown back at him (and at his Creator). It is shameful to see how some can merely cease to remember. Gratitude and respect -virtues normally upheld In a moral community like Notre Dame ­have been conveniently bracketed In this matter. 
Recall that we are dealing with a won­derful human being, a brilliant mind. Dr. Storey Is a man truly Inspired by his pas­sion for knowledge, truth and spiritual fultlllment. And yes, Inspired also by his own love for the Church. Anyone who has 
taken his Church Evolution course has 
been granted the privilege of sharing In 
that wisdom and Inspiration. There are 
few professors who could trans(orm 
church history Into such a critically vital 
and relevant subject. Each lecture period 
there was an exciting and peculiar aura 
in the classroom: the past Church was 
hauntingly alive and impinging on the 
present. The course was an Intellectual 
and spiritual challenge, the "stufr' of an 
Ideal university education. 
Students who get to know Dr. Storey 
outside of the classroom discover that 
his devotion, compassion and Incredible 
insight are no classroom facade. His spirit 
of generosity and setness interest In 
others is rarely matched. If only more 
teachers shared his talent for engaging 
wit and provocative humor. I have never 
left disappointed after talking with him; 
the art of sincere and meaningful 
dialogue is not lost to Bill Storey. 
So, what has changed or marred the 
contributions and loyal relationship of 
this professor to Notre Dame -to 
humanity at large, for that matter? A 
public announcement that he considers 
himself gay and an atheist. 
I would be the first to admit that I have 
my own resolved problems with the issue 
of homosexuality; I cannot deny that I 
find it absolutely offensive to my sense 
of what is natural In the sphere of human 
sexuality. Nevertheless, even though I 
hold Dr. Storey in the highest regard, this 
claim of his being gay does not reverse, 
but rather expands, my understanding of 
him. He has also said that he is an atheist. 
Through a furrowed brow, I smile a little 
at this. While I do not doubt the sincerity 
of his statement as he made It, Professor 
Storey would be the first to encourage a 
classroom of students to question the 
ways in which the term "atheist" is in itself 
philosophically problematical. 
In other words, these two disturbing announcements do nothing to nullify the above panegyric to Dr. Storey. Moreover, they are no excuses for the ill treatment he has received. How can the Theology Department allow this to happen to a member, "retired" or not, of Its commu­nity? It is unthinkable, unforgivable. Basic human dignity and respect have been denied an Individual more worthy of it than most of us. This is a blight on the soul of the University. As a member of this community, it hurts. I would like to encourage Notre Dame to do the dif­ficult and courageous thing: be recon­ciled to your brother.

Some of these pot-holes are substantially wide and I find myself driving through parts of the lot as though I were In an obstacle course. No only can these holes cause flat tires (which the University is not liable for), but they are also not very

I would appreciate It if maintenance would look Into this matter soon. I realize that the office must be swamped with work. but I think that this is a serious situation affecting all student drivers who park in D-2. Students are paying $25.00 to park and deserve at least a decently paved lot.

Underage drinkers are blatantly breaking law 
Dear Editor: 

In recent issues ofThe Observer, I have read articles written by Mark Pankowski in regards to police raids on parties to stop underage drinking. The articles are written In such a way that, by the time you finish reading, you get the feeling that you should feel sorry for the students who are arrested and totally deplore the law agencies involved for their dastardly actions. 
Let's face it! I like to drink a few beers myself, and I tried to get away with drink­ing before I was 21, too. But, like it or not, the law (in almost every state In the U.S.) clearly states that you must be 21 to legally drink any alcoholic beverage. This does not exclude Notre Dame or St. Mary's students. 
It is amazing that Legal Services direc­tors would actually advise underage drinkers of their rights so they would be able to continue breaking the law. Will their next step be to tell them how to commit murder and get away with it? The analogy may be a bit absurd -but that Is a glaring weakness in our legal system today -I.e., people getting away with a crime they have committed because of improper arrest procedures. 
I think It's time we quit degrading law enforcement agencies for doing their jobs. I don't always agree with the way that the police handle every case and I'm not saying they are perfect. But as the old cliche goes "if you're gonna dance, you have to pay the fiddler." 
So, to you underage students, I say, just as I had to accept the risks that go along with breaking the law -no matter how ridiculous it may seem to be -so must you. Someday, 1 0 or 20 years from now, when you own your own home and the neighbor's kids are havingan all-night beer bash, keeping you awake at 2 a.m., and possibly damaging your property and leaving beer cans and cups all over the neighborhood, you'll understand. 
So, let's all party hearty! But remember If you're drinking underage and you get caught -it is you who are in the wrong!

SYR on birthday is not wasted getting 'wasted' 
Dear E:ditor: 
Lou 5arabando's Viewpoint ofTuesday, Sept. 2.3rd made something click when I read it. Usually when I read Viewpoln~ or Letters to the Editor, I blow off the possibility of responding because of lack of time or lack of the right response. This thne, however, I could not pass up the chance to write for two reasons. First. if Mr. Sarabando had his way, he would have the University put an end to SYR's and formals that the residence halls are graciously allowed to have. This would effectively end most of the University sponsored social life left on our campus. 
. \.. 

This would be a great tragedy to most students who don't believe in sitting In their rooms and vegetating away the whole weekend. Second, Mr. 5arabando need to be awakened to the fact that Notre Dame students are not "boys and girls" but responsible adults who are given the choice of drinking in moderation at SYR's or not drinking at all. Either choice is fine for me, as I do not anticipate "throwing up uncontrollably'' this Friday night after attending a St. Mary's SYR. You see, Lou, St. Mary's campus is alcohol-free and I plan on having a great time with my date, her friends, and some of my friends who are also going. Incidentally, Friday, Sep­tember 26 Is also my 19th birthday, Lou, and I don't plan on spending it "throwing up uncontrollably''. Don't most "boys and girls" in college get sick on alcohol on their birthdays? Last year I studied Emil on my birthday! Am I crazy, or what? Am I missing something, Lou? 
Amazing, huh? Yes, there are quite a few "boys and girls" who will attend SYR's this semester, drink responsibly, not get "whacked" or "plastered" (as your friend "Chris" believes you must to have a good time) and actually (God forbid) have a good time! 
Lou, you asked If you are missing something. I am telling you that you are. Don't miss your SYR because you are too embarrassed to walk through your messy "home" with your date. If she's worth anything she'll like you for who you are, not how clean your hall Is. Go, and make t_!le best of It, because if you let others decide· for you whether-or not you're going to have fun here at school you are In real trouble when you are pushed into the real world, diploma In hand, and are expected to make decisions that may last for the rest of your life. And you, If you are going to persecute yourself by drink­ing club soda (yecchh) at your SYR. go all out and drink Atka Seltzer. I guarantee that you will feel much better in the mor­ning.

Notre Dame golf team tees it up against W .Michigan in dual match 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO Sports writer 
The 1986-87 Notre Dame golf team will tee it up for real Friday afternoon when it takes on host Western Michigan in a dual 

match  on  the  greens  of  the  
Moors  Country  Club  in  
Kalamazoo, Mich.  

On Sunday, the team then will travel to Zionsville, Ind., where the Indiana State Golf Champi­onship will be held. The Golf Club of Indiana will be the host for the .36-hole event which will field participants from all the col­leges In Indiana. The Irish last won this tournament which is being held on Indiana's best­rated golf course, In 1978. 
Leading up to the start of the men's golf season was the 58th annual Notre Dame Open which concluded two weeks ago. The 72-hole match drew 65 hopefuls, with only 10 spots open on head coach Noel O'Sullivan's roster. 
"The Open is not intended to be as a total tryout, but as a gauge to spot new prospects," said O'Sullivan. "Golf Is not just one four-round tournament." 
Indeed it is not but whoever does finish first In the tourna­ment would be very difficult to overlook. And this was certainly the case for Pat Mohan, who se­cured a spot on the roster with a four-day total score of 285. 
"Pat Mohan won the Notre Dame Open," said O'Sullivan, "and I must play the Open win­ner." 
Senior captain Chris Bona, who did not have a particularly good Open in shooting a .302, will be the number-one guy nevertheless on O'Sullivan's squad. The reason for Bona's po­sition, according to O'Sullivan, is simple. 
"Bona has lettered for three years," he said, "and most Im­portantly he has experience." 
Also returning this year is junior Rich Connelly, who finished a strong fourth In the Open with a total of 29.3. Rich has lf!ttered for two years, and was O'Sullivan's top prospect in 1984. Sophomore DougGiorgio, who did not play last year except in the last tournament of the season, has also made the top squad for this season after shooting a total of 295 in the Open. 
In the collegiate sports world, freshmen usually view the action much like spectators, from the sidelines. That rule, however, does not apply for freshman John Connelly. Aside from finish­Ing second in the Open with a nice four-day sum of 292, his golf talent has his coach singing his praise. 

"John was my top recruit this year, but he was probably a lot of people's number-one recruit on their list," said O'Sullivan. " Here is a_ guy who was one of the best golfers In Ohio, and If that wasn't cause enough to recruit him, the fact that he qualified as an amateur in last year's Western Open made the point moot. John Is, without a doubt, a true blue­chipper in every sense of the word." 
The big suprise of the Open was freshman Bobby Kloska, who finished third with a 292, but was edged out by John Con­nelly for second after losing the first hole of a sudden death playoff. For O'Sullivan, who did not recruit KJoska, the fresh­men's play came as a pleasant sur prise. 
O'Sullivan also said that he felt good about the outcome of the Open. Other players that made an impression included seniors Mike Culver and Tom Ryan, and 
junior 'Stormin' Norm Campbell. 
Those three will head 
O'Sullivan's blue-team (which play~ a schedule mainly com­posed of junior college teams). The coach concedes that his squad .is an Inexperienced one for the most part, but he believes they have the skill to shoot low numbers. 
This weekend, of course, will give the coach a chance to find out for certain.

Fallon 
continued/rom page 16 
One of the big changes Fallon has seen in tennis over the course of his career is the in­creasing competitive nature of the game. 
"In the old days, you played a match with the team and then socialized," recalled Fallon. "You'd go out with the coach and the kids would have dinner to­gether. You'd spend a day touring the other campus. 
"Today coaches don't want to socialize or have the kids so­cialize. I think a lot of coaches have gone overboard on that. Sure there's a mental aspect of the game, an emotional aspect to get the kids psyched out. That part has changed. It was a lot more leisurely 30 years ago." 
Even though he depricates his own ability, what Fallon has done is part of the Notre Dame legend. While Fallon's career victory total mark may some day be eclipsed (Fencing coach Mike DeCicco is closing in fast), the way he went about it both personally and in a situation contrary to his his sport may never be touched. 
Every other year, former tennis players come in from around the country to visit their former coach. He is that kind of a per­sonality. 
"He's made tennis at Notre Dame," said Ralph. "He's done a fantastic job. I'm amazed at the number of people that keep com­ing back. It's kind of a second family." 
Congratulations on all of your achievements, Coach. You've earned them.

that Is being counted on heavily this year is former high school all-American Linda Filar. Filar, who Is "sick and tired of being number-two" according to Ryan, finished eighth at Hillsdale with a time of 18:10. 
Other Notre Dame runners who will take part In the meet Include junior Nancy Loughlin, sophomores Theresa Rice and Terry KJbelstis, and freshman Wendy Murray. 
All the Notre Dame runners fig­ure to face tough competition In the meet. Last year's National Catholic Cross Country Cham­pions, VIllanova, will return to defend Its title, while Boston Col­lege will look to d~throne the Wildcats and take the team title. Both teams are ranked first In their Dlvlslon-1 districts and are among the top 16 teams In the country. 
Villanova placed Its top five runners among the first seven finishers at last year's Champi­onship, Including Individual champion Lauren Searby, an all­American.

Scott tosses no-hitter as Astros wrap up divisio~ title 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Mike Scott pitched the first National League nine­inning no-hitter in three years as the Houston Astros clinched their first West Division title since 1980 with a 2-0 victory over the San Francisco Giants. 
It was the third straight shutout victory for the Astros, who will meet the New York Mets in the best-of-seven NL championship Series beginning Oct. 8 in the Astrodome. 
Scott. whose career was in jeopardy until he developed a split-fingered fastball last year. pitched the first no-hitter since St. Louis' Bob Forsch beat Montreal 3-0 on Sept. 26, 1983. On April 2 I, 1984, the Expos Dave Palmer had a five-inning perfect game against the Car­dinals. 
Scott's 13 strikeouts gave him 298 for the season, two short of becoming only the second NL right-hander behind Houston's 
J. R. Richard to strike out 300 in one year. Scott's previous total for three years with the Astros was 293. 
Scott, the major-league strikeout and earned run average leader, allowed only three base runners. 
He hit Dan Gladden in the back with the first pitch of the game and walked Chili Davis to start the second inning. The walk ended Scott's string of 27 1-3 in­nings without a walk. 
Scott got stronger in the late innings, retiring 19 straight bat­ters after Davis' walk until catcher 
Phil  Ouellette walked  with  one  
out  in the eighth.  Scott struck  
out  the  side  in  the  sixth  and  


added two more strikeouts in the seventh. 
In the eighth, he started the inning by striking out Bob Bren­ly, giving him six strikeouts in his last seven batters. He then walked Ouelette, but he got out of the inning by getting Jose Uribe on a fielder's choice grounder and pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete on a long fly ball to center field. 
Aldrete's fly ball was only the third hit out of the infield in the game and was the closest the Giants got to a hit. 
In the ninth, Scott closed out in spectacular fashion with strikeouts of Dan Gladden and Rob Thompson. Will Clark made the final out, grounding out to first baseman Glenn Davis, start­ing a team celebration on the first base line adjacent to the Astros' dugout. 
As the final out was recorded, mounted policemen came onto the field as the Astros' crowd cheered their division cham­pions from the stands. 
The Astros left seven runners on base in the first four innings until Walling broke the scoreless tie with his 13th home run of the season in the fifth, giving the Astros a 1-0 lead. 
Houston clinched a tie for the title Wednesday night when Nolan Ryan pitched 6 1-3 hitless innings and struck out I 2 batters in a 6-0 shutout of the Giants. On Tuesday night lefl-hander Jim Deshaies shut out Los An­geles. 

The Astros moved into first place to stay this season on July 2 I with an 8-7 victory over Montreal. 
Houston lost to the New York Mets 13-2 in their first game after the All-Star break but then won three in a row from the Mets to start their surge to first place. 
The Astros will face the Mets in the Astrodome in the first two games of the best of seven N L 
playoff Oct. 8 and 9. 
The next three games will be played in New York on Oct. I I, 12 and 13 and the final two games, if necessary, would return to Houston Oct. 15 and 16. 
The Astros won the 1980 divi­sion crown, their first ever, in a one-game playoff with Los An­geles after the two teams tied for the title with 92-70 records. 
The World Series begins Oct. 18 in the NL city.

Young men's cross-country team has home-field advantage in meet 
By KELLY TOWNSEND 
Sports Writer 
As the rest of the campus gets ready for tailgaters this weekend, seven men will be out on the golf course. No. they won't be playing golf. They'll be competing In the 7th annual National Catholic In­vitational. 

Once again the Invitational will ,_ be held at Notre Dame this Friday with colleges such as Villanova, 

program needs. 
Despite the help of these new members, however, the Irish are still led by a trio of experienced runners. Junior Kathleen Leh­man, healthy this week after bat­tling the flu at the Hillsdale ln­
vititatlonal,  Is  the  team's  
time-trial  winner,  while  class­ 
mate  and  team  captain  Julia  

Merkel was the top Irish finisher at tilllsdale, placing flfth overall with a time of 17:51. That finish, Incidentally, was an entire 58 seconds faster than her finish of last year.

Fallon's honors are well-deserved 
When I began writing for this paper, one of the first stories I did was on the men's tennis team. The Irish had started off their fall season with a berth in in a tournament at Illinois St. on the last weekend in September. Dutifully, I called the team's head coach. Torn fallon, to find out how the Irish fared. 
Now, two years later on the last weekend in September, I find my attention turned toward the men's tennis team. Sat­urday at halftime, Fallon will be honored in a ceremony com­merating .his 30 years at the Irish helm. When next spring's season comes to a close, fallon will end his career. And what a career it's been. 
l

Dennis .l j 
Corrigan l 
Sports Editor 
Last season, fallon was named the Midwest Collegiate Con­ference's coach of the year as his squad finished with a 25-9, fallon's eighth 20-win campaign. He's won five Eastern Col­legiate championships. In 1959, fallon's third season, Notre Dame tied Tulane for the national championship. 
But perhaps the most eye-popping of fallon's statistics is his career victory total. Combined with his 69 victories in 15 years as head coach of the wrestling team, Fallon has amassed a total of 558 victories. That's amost twice as many as Rockne, Leahy and Parseghian-combined. In fact, Fallon's 558 put him ahead of any lri~h coach in any sport. 
What's more ofa credit to fallon is that he has won despite adverse conditions. Anyone who's spent any length of time at Notre Dame is more than aware that it doesn't exactly have the ideal climate for tennis. Before the ACC was built, there were no real facilities for indoor tennis, but that didn't stop fallon. 
"We had no indoor facilities whatsoever," recalled fallon. "We had to put elastic garters on the basketball court in the old fieldhouse. The only time we could get in there would be seven in the morning or lunch if the basketball team wasn't shooting or when they were out of town . 
"We had a procedure where we'd have to put up our own nets and put up these plastic garters. We hoped we wouldn't trip over them and break our necks. And you know how fast basketball courts are. It was like glass or lightning on the court. And, it was raised so if you went out of bounds, you might break your legs. It was a real credit to the kids of that era." 
fallon also has continued to win despite a cutback in schol­arships. 
"At one time, we had four scholarships," noted Fallon. "And despite the poor coaching that the kids got, we managed to have some pretty good teams. 
"What has killed us in recent years is we only have two scholarships and most of our opponents have five. I said to Moose Krause (Notre Dame's athletic director at the time), 'how do you expect me to compete with these teams with five scholarships?' 5o Moose just moved his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other and said, 'great coaching.' 
"You can't argue with that kind of logic." 
But fallon is remembered by former players for more than just his coaching. 
"He cared about how we did as people," recalled Don Ralph, a second-team all-American on the '59 national champions. "He was interested in our total welfare. 
"I have a great deal of admiration for Coach Fallon. He symbolizes what class is. · 
"He didn't put a lot of excess pressure on us," said Ralph of fallon's coaching style. "He wanted it to be fun, too. We always had a good time on the trips, some of the best times I've had."

The Notre Dame women's cross country team will compete at the National Catholic Cross Country Championship Friday af­ternoon at Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
After competing well at the Hil­lsdale Invitational at Hillsdale, Mich. last week. the Irish are looking to Improve even more on their home course. This season Is the first as a varsity sport for the women runners, who spent several years compet­Ing as a club in anticipation of gaining varsity status. 

As a club team last season, the Irish finished fourteenth In the National Catholic Champion­ships. This year, however, Notre Dame head coach Dan Ryan Is expecting a top-seven finish from his runners. His squad, he claims, is "ready to run" follow­Ing a good practice Wednesday. 
The vast Improvement In this year's team Is contributed to mainly hard work and new faces. Team members have consis­tently bettered their times by as much as two minutes for a three­mile course. In addition, fresh­men Linda Filar and Wendy Mur­ray have provided the good running talent that a building 
I three freshmen and two sop-I homores. The freshmen, Mike 
O'Conner, Mike Rogan, and Tom O'Rourke, really add strength to the squad. With co-capitan Jeff 

van Wle out with a strained Ac-·, hllles' tendon, a strong perfor-I ; mance by the freshmen could ' put Notre Dame at the top this i week. -1 
"We have a young team and excellent potential," says Coach Plane. "If we can get two men in the top ten it will be a good per­formance. To win It we'll need flve men In the top twenty-five." i 
With 190 runners competing in the race, placing flve runners that high could prove a little dif­ficult. However, one must re­member that this Is the Irish Cross Country team. Pride runs high and determination is strong on all teams and these guys are no exception. 
"We run as a team and every­one runs his hardest" says Mul­vey. "As long as we get people In the-top ten with an ND on their chest It doesn't matter who it is. I'd like to be in the top five, but as long as one of us is there I'll be happy." 
The heat and humidity will be a definite factor and the Irish hope to use it to their advantage. They also have the home field advantage, knowledge of the course and crowd support, which is a definite factor In this de­manding sport. 
The Invitational will start at .3:00 for the women and 4:00 for the men at the 16th fairway. The five-mile race will wind Its way through the golf course and finish on the 2nd fairway. 
After one more home meet, the Irish will go on the road to Terre Haute for the Indiana State Meet.

When Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz an­nounced the members of his coaching staff, the name that drew the most Immediate attention was that of Serafino Dante Fazio, better known as 'Foge'. 
Fazio had been relieved of his duties as head coach at Pittsburgh at almost the same time Holtz was hired at Notre Dame. It wasn't long before Holtz tabbed Fazio for the defensive coordinator's 
job. 
"I think I got here on December 9," recounts Fazio. "I had some personal obligations I had to take care of first, but Coach Holtz was very kind and told me to take my time and spend some time with my family. 
!'(My Initial reaction) was that I was number-one. Not only because (the offer) was Notre Dame -It's a thrill and honor to coach and be considered to coach at a place like here -but I had heard so much about Coach Holtz. I just thought It was a great opportunity for me to coach with him here." 
Fazio compiled a 25-18-.3 record In his four years at the Panthers' helm, Including records of 9-.3 

and 8-.3-1 In his first two years after succeeding Jackie Sherrill. More Impressive than his won-loss record was Fazio's defensive record. 
Under Fazio's guidance, the Panthers led the na­tion In rushing and total defense In 1980 and 1981 while the team wracked up Its second and third consecutive 11-1 seasons and top-10 ranklngs. Even when the team wasn't faring as well In his last two years as head coach, Fazio's defenses were some of the toughest In the nation. 
But for one brief instant, Fazio almost didn't get a chance to stand on the sidelines for Notre Dame. When spring drills began, Kent State, Holtz' alma mater, contacted Fazio about occupying the va­cancy In its top slot. 
"Kent State contacted me In March after we had already been through a week of spring practice," Fazio recalled. "They went through Coach Holtz, and I told them I wasn't Interested. But I guess they kept bugging him. (Holtz) said that after watching us practice for six days, to go ahead and take a look at it." 
Holtz, ofcourse, wasjoking, leaving the defensive coordinator's duties to what some consider the best defensive mind In football.

The Boo's Brothers 
In search of: The No. 1 fans 
By MIKE SZVMANSKI Sports Writer 
Just exactly who were those guys dressed In referee uniforms and sunglasses, one carrying a jam box on his shoulder, at the pep rally and at the Michigan game In the student section two weeks ago? 
They, of course, were the Boo's Bros., celebrating the "Year of The Fan." 
The Boo's Bros.-Louie, Duke, and Mallboxhead-are a three­man team touring the world during the 1986 football season, searching for the best college and professional football fans on earth. 
And right now, the Notre Dame student body and supporters are No.1, even though the Irish football team Is unranked. 
"We feel that the fans get the short end of the stick." said Duke. "With all the high pro salaries and the USFL trouble, If anyone should get high salaries It Is the fans. It Is the 12th man that makes sports most exciting. Each fan Is just as much a part of the game as the players." 
During the Michigan game, the power of Notre Dame's tradi­tional "12th man" was definitely felt In Notre Dame Stadium, and the Boo's Bros., who remain anonymous to "preserve the aura," were Impressed. 
"Notre Dame Is No. I because the crowd stood and cheered for the entire game," said Duke, "and not one fan left after the final field goal was missed. No one budged In the face of defeat.

Boilers' Woodson talks on field 
By SCOTT STARR 
Purdue exponent 
In the often vicious game of football, defensive backs are often soft~spoken. But when he's on the field, Purdue cor­nerback Rod Woodson's actions are anything but quiet. 
Although he has been in the spotlight ever since he was named All-State at Snider H.S, Ind., Woodson is really under the gun In this his senior season. 
"We're expecting big things from Rod this year," says Purdue head coach Leon Burtnett. "There's no doubt he's a leader on this team." 
Woodson says he does not feel any pressure as one of the designated leaders on and off the football field. As one of seven seniors on the '86 squad, he says the team needs leadership not only from him, but from the other six as well. 
What has attracted more attention to Woodson this season Is his movement from free safety to cornerback. Even though he Is changing positions, Woodson still has been named to numerous preseason all-America polls. 
According to Woodson, the move was a good one for the team. "The coaches think so, and I respect the coaches' judgement." 
Burtnett says Woodson is Improving every day at his new position. 
"I don't think there is any doubt he has strengthened the secondary," the coach says. "It's put Rod in a better position to play on each play. 
'Tm sure (the move) has taken something away from us run-support wise, but it's added a lot pass-support wise." 
Mike Weaver, Woodson's partner at the corner and a close friend. says he has no problem playing next to a potential superstar. 
"You can't look at him like a god." Weaver says. "He puts his pants on one leg at a time like everybody else. 
"I don't want to take anything away from him, though. He Is a great athlete." 
Woodson's career statistics support Weaver's claim. Not only has he been second on the team in tackles for the past two seasons, but he needs only .32 solo tackles to become Purdue's career leader In that category. 
'Woodson does not limit his athletic career to football alone. He Is also a three-time Big 10 55-meter hurdles champion. He even was named all-conference in basketball while In high school. 
When placed against each other, however, Woodson chooses football as his favorite sport by far. "I've grown up playing football. the other sports are just secondary," said Woodson. "I like the challenge of having to react to the receiver." 
React he does, according to Burtnett. 
"You don't see a defensive back that hits with the intensity of a Rod Woodson," Burtnett said. "He just plays hard. 
"If everyone would give you the effort of a Rod Woodson 
you would have a great football team." ' 
Praised as he is, Woodson admits he sometimes finds It diftlcult to maintain a 100-percent concentration level during practice. 
"I think it's a little laziness on my part,." he said. "But when it's time for the game, I know I'll need to tune it up." 
Weaver realizes he will have to turn up his intensity level as well. It will not take a brilliant quarterback to realize he should throw away from one of the top-rated cornerbacks in the nation, and as a result Weaver will see plenty of balls coming his way. 
"The ball will probably come to me a little bit more -at least for a little while," Weaver says. 
Although his senior season has barely begun, Woodson has high hopes for his future after Purdue. The NFL would be a nice place to start. 
"I think that's every player's dream," Woodson says. "''d like to play there for a couple of years. That would be my dream."

"It was unbelievable. Girls were crying. We have partied with some real nuts, but the Irish stu­dent body is as tough and wants to win just as much as the team. We challenged them and they carne through." 
The Boo's Bros. lived the com­plete football weekend, making an announcement at the pep rally before the game, camping out at the Stadium after visiting Senior Bar and hittingall the tall­gaters for a full four hours before the game. They even made an appearence at Bridget McGuire's, dedicating their new hit song to the fans, which Is sure to rise on the charts. 
The Boo's Bros. have a rigorous schedule, attending a major col­lege game and a professional game every weekend, including Monday Night Football. They were In London for the Bears­Cowboys game and the Kickoff Classic with Alabama and Ohio State. They were In Columbus, Ohio, last weekend for the Ohio St. -Colorado game. 
"The travelling is tough," said Louie, "but we love It and it keeps us in shape." No doubtthat some of those roadtrip blues are com­forted by their officially endorsed beer -Stroh's. 
Along their trek across the country, the Boo's Bros. have at­tracted media attention, Includ­Ing newspaper reporters, local television shows, and the CBS News with Dan Rather. WNDU's own Mike Collins did a spot on them last week. 

The Boo's Bros. have Introduced the "Penalty Pal," a yellow penalty flag bearing the five­finger gesture. Fans can wave the flag for penalties or for any dis­approval or protest. to actively help their team to win. 
"Use ofthe Penalty Pal is not con­fined to football games at the "At a Wisconsin game a few years ago, AI Toon was interfered with in the end zone." said Duke, "and the call was not made. It cost Wisconsin the game and a bowl bid. I wish I would have had a Penalty Pal to throw at that game. 
"We were watching public televi­sion, being the knowledge­loving people that we are, and the Idea came to us (after recall­ing the Wisconsin game.) 
"The Penalty Pal causes con­cern," continued Duke, "since colleges do not have the Instant-replay option: It says I am watching the game, and leave my team alone." 
"The five-finger gesture represents thumbing your nose at anything against your team," said Louie. "It is also a good sign to give to the team you beat, the losers, which is radical, but so are we. All in all, it says boo. 

"We wear referee uniforms be­cause they make all the deci­sions. Boo's Bros. uniforms are symbolic of the fan's power." 
A Boo's Brother Is not immune to danger on a World Tour. "In fact, Mailboxhead received his name because he Is the only human ever Federal Express·ed Overnight," said Louie. "We were mailing out Year-of-the-Fan in­

The Year-of-the-Fan trophy, the coveted six-foot "Fannie," will be awarded to the best college fans at the Rose Bowl, and to the best pro fans at the Superbowl. 
Notre Dame's closest competi­tion for the award is the Univer­sity of Alabama, and the Boo's Bros. will be at Birmingham next weekend to see the Tide play the Irish. 
"Alabama was awesome at the Classic, and we want to see them and Notre Dame fans In action together," said Louie. So Notre Dame must not only compete on the gridiron but In the stands as well this season.

"Coach Fazio is an outstanding football coach," says Irish captain and Inside linebacker Mike Kovaleski. "It'sjust a great pleasure to be able to have the opportunity to play for him. I've learned a lot of defensive techniques from him. I couldn't say enough about the defensive mind that he does have." 
"I don't know about that," says Fazio of Kovaleski's compliment. "I've been very fortunate to coach with a lot ofsuccessful coaches who have stressed a lot of things that I've believed in. I've been blessed with a lot of outstanding football players, both physically and intelligence-wise. I've also had a lot of good guys to work with. 
"I don't think I know anything more or less about football than anyone else. It's still a team game, the offense is going to help the defense, and vice versa." 
But that's only a small part of Fazio's defensive philosophy. On defense, Fazio stresses fun­damentals and Intelligence. 
"Number one, we're trying to useas manydifferent fronts and coverages as we possibly can," says Fazio. "However, we want to be a good technique team. We want to be really, really aggressive. We want to be sound. We'll eliminate things if our players can't adjust to them. 
"We want to try and give them as many different looks as we can up front and also disguise the coverage. I believe you have to do that nowadays. 
"Everything being equal," continued Fazio, "I believe that the teams that are sound fundamen­
tally and pursue to the football in correct spob arc going to be successful. 
"The most important thing is that we want to play with a lot of intelligence. We want to play with a reckless abandon, but we still have to be intelli­gent." 
As a former head coach at a major program, many questioned if he would bring his own defensive ideas to Notre Dame, or whether he would work within the scheme of Holtz. 
"It's a combination," answers Fazio. "I talked to Holtz at length about his philosophy before I I took the job, and I knew what type of defense he had at Arkansas. A lot of things he did with our basic fronts and our basic stuff were the same things that he has been involved in before. He was an outstanding secondary coach at Ohio St., so 1 knew about his defensive philosophy -be very aggressive, put it in the right spots, be sound, try to contain those people that are most danger­ous. 

Foge Fazio 

"That's basically what we try to do. We haven't had a problem at all with it. There are a lot of suggestions, even specific suggestions, that he passes down, and we incorporate them because our philosophies are so much alike." 
Another question concerning the defense was whether or not Holtz would totally turn over the defensive reins to Fazio so that (Holtz) could con­cern himself only with the offense. 
"No, that's not true at aiL" Fazio says. "He's come into our meetings, and down to our end of the field. He's helped out in specific areas. I know he's helped coach the defensive backs, the linebackers, and made suggestions on pass rush­ing techniques. 
"Naturally he calls the offensive plays so he has to stay down there a lot. He's been with us and I think our players realize that it's great to have the head coach down there too." 
Although Fazio was his own boss at Pittsburgh, he says becoming an assistant coach hasn't been much of an adjustment. 
"Naturally it's great to be a head coach, especially at your alma mater, Pittsburgh," says Fazio. "But I was an assistant coach for 16 years, I was a coordinator and an assistant head coach so Ididn't see any major adjustments. Maybe because you're at Notre Dame, it's such a family-oriented place, It's a special place. 
"When you're a head coach, there are so many administrative things you have to do, things away from football," says Fazio. "It's very, very frustrat­ing and tough to get involved in one phase or the other. <At Pitt) I tried to get involved in the offense because a lot of major decisions are made over there. I did involve myself in the offense as much as I could, but the last year I involved myself mostly with the defense and left the offense to 
the offensive coordinator." 
While playing linebacker and center for the Pan­thers, Fazio was a teammate of someone else who has since gone on to earn coaching fame-Chicago Bears' head coach Mike Ditka. And, yes, all the stories about the ultra-intense Ditka are true. 
'Tm in Ditka's book," jokes Fazio about. the recently-released autobiography. "What a great competitor, the most intense, competitive guy in practice and in a game. Once, he hit (a teammate) in the side of the head. It could have knocked him out. 
"He almost got me one time on the kickoff. He was going around, slapping guys on the helmet to fire them up, (because) the other team hadjust scored a touchdown to get back in the game. I saw him coming, and I knew what he was going to do. He hit one guy in the helmet and I said holy .... So I ducked." 
Fortunately for the Irish, Fazio survived.

Boilermakers pull off upset 
Purdue halts win streak in '67 
By MARTY STRASEN 
Ao;si.o;tant Sports F.ditor 
Heading into Lafayette in late September of 1967, the top­ranked Irish were favored by 13 points over eighth-ranked Purdue in a much-awaited football showdown. 
After a classic battle, however, the Boilers became better known as the 'Spoilers' around the Notre Dame campus, as they rallied late in the game to pull out a 28-21 surprise victory. The win marked the first time a team had beaten the Irish since Michigan State had done it two years earlier, in 1965. 
The biggest crowd ever to see a game at Purdue's Ross-Ade Stadium (62,316) saw sophomore quarterback Mike Phipps connect for a 31-yard touchdown pass to Bob Baltzell late in the fourth quarter to break a 2 1-21 tie and seal the victory. The faithful then proceeded to practically tear up' the stadium in a post-game victory bash. 
The lead changed hands six times in the contest, first belong­ing to Purdue when fullback Perry Williams bullied his way into the endzone from I0 yards out. After the kick failed, Irish quarterback Terry Hanratty gave Notre Dame its first lead, 7-6, on a one-yard sneak. 
Hanratty attempted a school-record 63 passes in the game, completing 29 while giving up four costly interceptions. 
Williams once again plunged over the line in the third quarter for the Boilermakers, giving them a 14-7 lead with the help of a two-point conversion from Phipps to end Jim Bierne. 
Bob Blier tied it up heading into the final frame, pushing his way up the middle from the one-yard line after an impressive Irish drive. 
The quarterbacks then exchanged touchdown tosses to preserve the tie until the late-game Purdue fireworks, as Phipps hit Leroy Keyes for an I 1-yard score and Hanratty pitched to Paul Snow for a 27-yard touchdown.  
After the Boilermakers took the lead, Notre Dame managed to get to within 14 yards of a potential tying or winning score before losing the ball on downs. 
With that upset win, the Boilermakers scalded away any Notre Dame chances of a national championship, as Ara Parseg­hian's Irish went on to finish the season with an 8-2 record.

There has always been a close and af­fectionate tie between the Notre Dame athletic department and the Notre Dame Bands. Even Knute Rockne played flute for Notre Dame long before he thought of coaching. Former athletic director, Ed­ward "Moose" Krause, spent some years studying music before he put his clarinet on the shelf to devote himselfto athletics. 
A former captian of the football team says, "When I was a player, I knew the band got the adrenalin flowing in the team. I didn't realize how much they con­tributed to the whole game until I became a spectator." 

Historically, the band has a rich tradi­tion of its own, generations older that the football team and nearly as old as the University itself. It has been active con­tinually since 1846and claims, with some 
justification, to be the oldestcollege band in the nation. It was among the first to use marching formations and to spell out words on the football field. 
The Band of the Fighting Irish has al­ways provided music and pageantry for the Notre Dame football games. It was on hand for the first game with Michigan In 1887and has not missed a single home game since that time. 
Director Emeritus, Robert O'Brien, sug­gest that the band's history might even go back to the year the University was founded because one historical account begins, "In 1842 a small (band) of brot­hers came to northern Indiana." O'Brien does admit, though, that the first docu­mented appearance of the band was not until Notre Dame's commencement in 1846. The band was declared a "Landmark of American Music" in 1976 by the National Music Council, the Indiana Music Educators Association and Exxon. 
Millions ofpeople know the Notre Dame band through its appearances at half-time shows at home football games, bowl games and other away trips. The band appeared at the Mirage Bowl game in Tokyo in 1979. The band also performs at basketball games, and has marched and played at countless civic functions, dedications, and parades. Few realize that the football function of the band Is but a small part of the total schedule. 
The band performs 60 to 70 public per­formances durlg the nine-month school year In addition to Its half-time appear­ances during the football season. 
The Notre Dame Band first performed the famous "Notre Dame Victory March" In 1908. The march, written by John and Michael Shea, has been played everywhere from flea circuses on 42nd Street in New York to WHite House parties in Washington. One alumnus tells the story of hearing the march played as a demonstration tune on Chinese violins In Tientain during the Second World War. This famous melody has become one of the most copied and paraphrased college songs of all time.

Painting faces for charity 
MARY JACOBY 
features editor 


It's too good of a deal to pass up: promote school spirit while supporting a good cause. Or at least that's what Finance Club VIce President Ryan Robinson is hoping students will think Satur­day when the club sets up its face-painting booth as a . fundralser for both the club itself and the American Cancer Soci­ety. 
As a fundraiser, the Finance Club will be painting blue and gold stripes on the cheeks of Notre Dame football fans for $1 an application. Halfthe proceeds will be donated to the American Cancer Society. 
Notre Dame Head Football Coach Lou Holtz is the honorary fundraislng chairman for the In­diana Crusade of the American Cancer Society. Robinson admits this connection influenced the Finance Club's decision about which charity should receive the donation. "It might sound opor­tunistic," Robinson said, "but we knew the Cancer Society was a worthy charity." 
"We learned the potential was there to make thousands and thousands of dollars. We wanted to share the proceeds philanthropically," Robinson said. 
With the rest of the profits the Finance Club intends to sponsor a trip to Wall Street for members during October break. Members would visit the New York Stock Exchange, Chase Manhattan Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Drexel, Burnham and Lam­bert investment banking firm. 

"The trip will give us a chance 

to learn about our field and party and sightsee in New York," Rob­inson said. 
The Finance Club got the idea for face painting from Ohio State, which sponsored the same project approximately two years ago. The Ohio State effort succeeded in painting a majority of students in their stadium. 
The Finance Club booth will be stationed on Green Field Satur­day from 9 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. next to the backstop near the Alumni Senior Club. The back­stop will be decorated with a caricature of Holtz. Robinson en­courages students not affiliated with the Finance Club to help with the activity.

It has a different director and a different storylinE!, but "Aliens" is finally here. The sequel to director Ridley Scott's science­fiction horror film "Alien" from 1979. "Aliens" offers the return of Sigourney Weaver. special ef­fects galore and a script that has moviegoers cheering and some­times screaming. in the aisles. 

Movie review 
Aliens
***ltou1of four) 
"Aliens" is the continuing story of flight officer Ripley. played by Weaver, who is well remembered for her role in "Ghostbusters" and was directed by James Cameron. the man responsible for "The Terminator." 
As the film opens, Ripley, who has been suspended for 57 years in the escape pod of her previ­ously destroyed ship, the Nostrorno. is rescued. As she ex­plains the circumstances under which her crew and ship met their respective fates, her men­tion of an "alien" is received with expressions of disbelief. The planet Acheron, where she en· countered the alien in the first film is said to have been in­habited for the last twenty years. 
With this revelation to ponder. she is dismissed from the Com­pany and forced to reside in a seedy apartment and exist on the meager salary of a cargo loader.

Theater 

The UniversityofNotre Dame depart­ment of theater presents, direct from Broadway, "Krapp's Last Tape" per­formed by Rick Cluchey at 8:10p.m. on Friday In Washington Hall. Ticket prices for the show are $6 for main floor, $5 for the balcony and $4 for students. 
However. this is temporary be­
cause she is immediately called 
by the Company to act as special 
advisor on a rescue mission to 
the colony on Acheron when all 
contact with the colonists is lost. 
Thus begins Ripley's 
encounter with a platoon of 
space marines. whose sole re­
sponsibility is to make a drop on 
Acheron and rescue any surviv­
ing colonists. The colonists are 
not the only beings they find. 
"Aliens" is not a basic space 
adventure film because the story 
is not the only important part. 
Each character acts as an indi­
vidual. From Ripley to the least 
remembered marine. the actors 
play their roles with enthusiasm 
and realism that lets the audi­
ence come as close as possible 
to feeling just what the charac­
ters are experiencing. 
Weaver is not bad in her 
reprised Rip Van Winkle-like role 
of Officer Ripley. Weaver has 
never been known as a very emo­·-tio»alactressand in fact. shewas almost passed over for her role in "Ghostbusters" because direc­tor Ivan Reitman thought she was too stern for the role. But she is 
given the chance to act in 
"Aliens" and she lives up to the 
challenge. 

The script of the film allows 
her the opportunity to be both 
mother and butch; something 
the earlier film had no intention 
ofdoing. Here the audience gets 
to see the inside of Ripley and 
Weaver gives a good show.

is supported by Michael Biehn. who. like many of the other ac­tors playing marines, came to the "Aliens" team from "Ter­minator" with Cameron. He was good in that film and he is also strong here as the only really sane marine in the group, Cor­poral Hicks. Biehn's lines are small but his prescence is great and when he is on the screen with Weaver, she shines. 
The rest of the marines are 
good too. Especially Bill Paxton 
as the extremely competent but 
easily unravelled Private Hud­
son. Paul Reiser, who starred in 
the comedy "Diner" also gives a 
strong showing as the Company 
representative on the squad. 
The real applause belongs not to the actors. but to the special effects departments. And there are plenty of them. Once again people from the "Terminator" team have done an astounding 
job making the alien beings ex­tremely life-like. The ceatures move with a suppleness that is totally believable and can conjur up chills in even the staunchest of movie-goers. 
This film is directed and edited to perfection. Each scene is developed to bring out strong re­action from the audience. When you see a picture that has every­one gasping and cringing in uni­son, it becomes that much more realistic. "Aliens" evokes every feeling it wants to with stirring force and it's a trip to another world you will want to take. Ifyou have the guts of course.

Chris gave a sigh as though he were trying to take it all in. "So," he said, "the Lord came to fill in the gaps, and light candles in the minds of priests, who use bor­rowed jargon to pass on the good word to the rest of us?" 
I wasn't going to let him trap me with the bad theology that uses God to fill the gaps, and then takes back more and more of God's territory as soon as we have a better understanding of secondary causes. 
"The gaps," I said, "if they're merely physical, like the empty spaces between the stars; or if they leave us with questions about the cause of things, like 'Who wound up the lock of the universe?', are part of the on­going game that faith plays with science. 
"The metaphysical gaps, represented by the emptiness that is always part of us, helps us to know who we are and what we are: loners, designed to be that way by the Creator, util He writes us a different contract, if He ever does," I said. "Even if I'm socially occupied, even if I'm in the company of Christ, the lonelness is there, though it's not pressing down on me. Later, when the company is gone, I'll know how profound the loneli· ness is, and always has been. 
"God lets me mourn the dead," I said, "though the empty space that grief leaves in my soul is as big as a circus tent. He doesn't send substitutes, not even Him­self. Memories and hope are the only comforts He allows, be-

cause He wants me to know, by 
every lesson possible, that the · 
hearts tht were made for Him will 
always be restless until they rest 
in Him." 
"With all your talk of gaps, 
vacancies, obscurities and mys­
teries, you've confused me," he 
complained. 
''I'm confused myself," I ad­mitted, "though I'm working on it. I'm trying to let you see that faith doesn't have all the answers. I often don't know where God is, where He fits in, what things mean, or what His will is. On the spiritual plane, as in the scheme of evolution, He's a hidden God, and He keeps us guessing. His absence keeps us hungry for His presence." 
"I now know that the Catholic religion isn't all cut-and dried," he said. "I thought you priests had your act together better than that." 
"What have you got against priests?" I asked good naturedly. "They didn't invent the Catholic Church or the God that hides. Priests are only professional Christians who are trying to pass on hope, love, and redemption to a sin-sick world. Nothing stops you from shopping for the priest of your choice, until you finally find one who avoids jargon." 
By now, he was throwing a ball 
for Darby O'Gill to chase. If he joins the Catholic church, he will be Darby's convert. I'm just the mouthpiece for that dog when heaven sends him on errands of grace.
