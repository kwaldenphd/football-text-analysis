junior Maggie O'Connell has been reappointed editor in chiefofthe Blue Mantle, the Saint Mary's Col­lege yearbook for the 1984-85 school year. 
Two new positions were created with hopes ofbetter organizing the workload and also to get more students involved in the actual decision-making processes ol creating a yearbook. 
Sophomore Pam Demero will hold the position of 
copy editor, and the team of sophomore Kathleen 
Hardy and junior Elaine Suess will act as co­
photography coordinators. These assignments were 
made through a joint decision by Mary O'Donnell, 
director ofstudent activities and O'Connell. 
"We tried to look for people with new and innovative ideas who will be dedicated to the staff," O'Connell said. "We looked at the past. experiences of the ap­plicants as well as the creativity they had to offer to make next year's book a success." 
Changes planned for next year include the additiC!ln ofmore spot color and color picturesfor the book. "We also cut out the hall section pictures and instead in­serted a full color dorm picture," said O'Connell. 
The theme for this year's book is "The Winds of 
Change," from Bob Dylan's "Forever Young." Presently 
the editorial board is deciding on a theme for next 
year's book. In order to motivate more students to play 
a part in the making of the Blue Mantle a cover design 
contest is being planned for this spring. Any Saint Mary's 
student is encouraged to enter. 
O'Connell said it was often difficult to keep a steady 
staff. "I started the year with almost a hundred in­
terested students but the number dwindled to about 20 
to 25. I think the problem is that students fear it will 
take too much oftheir time. All it really takes is about an 
hour or two a week."

Time to do your job 
After weeks of being hidden by a three-inch layer of pictures, slogans and promises, the walls on this campus are slowly being uncovered. 
During these few weeks students voted in hall, class, 
and campus-wide elections. Virtually every student 
office will be filled before break. 
But few outside of the candidates themselves have 
followed the elections closely. Most are just happy to 
have a break from the posters before the mock conven­
tion gets underway. 
It is no news that student apathy runs high on this 
campus. Many perceive student and class officers as in­
effective at best, and consequently few contests 
generated much excitement. 
This view of student government is not completely unwarranted. Recent administrations have not always represented student concerns effectively. 
Naturally few put much stock in posters claiming, "With us all things are possible." Candidates post pages of suggestions, but one can­not help but wonder how 

Amy Stephan 
Assistant News Editor 

But the task of increasing student input on this campus does not rest entirely on the shoulders of the new officers. Student government could be ineffective partly because they do not have widespread studenc support. 
It is a vicious circle in which student government is ineffective because students perceive it as ineffective and therefore don't take it seriously. 
If we want to increase student input on campus we have to do more than toss our ballot in the election box.

student organizations can do little to change things. 
This may be true, but it doesn't necessarily have to remain so. Most would agree students should have more say in issues that concern them. Few would dis­agree there arc many areas in this university where im­provement is needed. Student and class governments can and should be instruments through which students can effect change and voice concerns. 
Our newly-elected hall, class and student govern­ment officers could help bring about a change. Not yet disillusioned by University red tape, these students arc supposedly full ofnew ideas and enthusiasm. 
There is, however, a large jump from ideas to reality. Most administrations began their terms with en­thusiasm. Few ended them on this note. 
Successful candidates now have an obligation to ful­fill the promises that covered our walls for weeks. Unless they are willing to work, and ifnecessary, to fight for change, student government will remain an ap­pendage to the workings ofthe University.

Hart sharply criticized in debates 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Walter Mondale, a deferential front-runner in early debates, launched sharp and repeated criticisms of Sen. Gary Hart's "new ideas" campaign yester­day in a Democratic presidential face-off two days before the "Super Tuesday" primaries and caucuses. 
"When I hear about your new ideas I'm reminded of the ad, 'Where's the beef?"' Mondale told Hart after the Colorado senator had said the nation's basic needs can be met by "restoring entrepreneur­ship." 
"What's new about comingout for entrepreneurship?" Mondale asked. 
Hart said no one can govern this country effectively if he is so com­mitted to a handful of constituency groups that "you cannot make this country grow again." 
That was a reference to Mondale's many endorsements, and Mondale said he had promised to "stand up" to the special interest groups. 
Hart took most of the heat during the five-man debate, a sure result of his four-state win streak that deposed Mondale as the favorite. 
Sen. John Glenn said Hart and Mondale would "cut our defense es­

tablishment beyond all reality," and Hart's ideas on bolstering U.S. defenses showa "lack ofunderstand­ing where you don't have the ex­perience." 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Hart, as well as Mondale, ought to commit themselves to running with a woman. 
Former Sen. George McGovern said that as an old history professor he questioned whether Hart's cam­paign against the past was turning his back to the achievements of America's great statesmen. 
Hart was constantly responding to someone else. In his concluding remarks, he said the great statesmen all had one thing in common: they stood for change "and that is what this campaign is all about. We must have new leadership, a new ap­proach and a fresh start." 
Mondale, looking for a comeback in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, dropped his serene demeanor from three earlier debates when he was the acknowledged front-runner. He opened his debate remarks saying, "I think substance is all that matters here." He said he was the most ex­
perienced  candidate  to  replace  
President Reagan.  
Mondale said  Hart  had  said  he  

would not commit U.S. forces to come to the aid of allies if Persian Gulf oil supplies were cut off, ad­ding, "In my opinion, that is naive." 
The question of oil supplies was raised last month in a debate in New Hampshire when each candidate was asked what he would do if the Straits of Hormuz were closed, cut­ting off oil shipments to Western Europe orJapan. Hart said he would reduce U.S. dependence on Middle East oil and thus the need to commit troops in the area.

Lebanese peace talks to start in Switzerland 
As..'iOciated Press 
BEIRliT, Lebanon -Machine-gun firt· and exchanges of rocket­propelled grenades persist along the frontier between cast and west Beirut on the eve of a new round of reconciliation talks today in Switzer­land aimed at ending tht· civil war. 
Police said 20 people were killed and H'; wounded in the 24 hours en­ding yesterday morning. Scattered fighting continued along rhc "green line" frontier, hut heavy artillery battles that killed a dozen people Saturday had tapered off. 
Sharp differences were reported yt·sterday among four main opposi­tion lt-atkrs in Lausanne for the rn.:onciliation talks, and Lebanese government officiab said the OJll"ning of the: session would he delayed by a few hours to permit ad­ditional preliminary dist·ussions.

Before leaving Nice, France, to Lausanne, President Amin Geaycl said, "Work will start tomorrow, I hope, for a real peace, the peace of hearts, peace for a people who deserve it, a people who have suf­fen:d in the service ofpeace." 
In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet yesterday put off an expected discussion of a troop redeployment in south Lebanon. Cabinet Secretary Dan Meridor said the issue was not raised. 
Bcrri said there were "indications Israel may he planning a surprise pullback from southern Lebanon" to undermine the talks by creating a fight ti>r the vacated land among the l.c:bancsc militias. 
Israeli Deputy Premier David Levy said Saturday Israel's forces would soon be redeployed for maxi­mum security with minimum presence in Lebanon. The Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982 in a drive against Palestinian guerrillas. The Is­raelis pulled back to south Lebanon last fall in an effort to reduce casualties.

Israel shaken by religious struggle 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -A new tlareup in a long power struggle between Is­rael's Orthodox and secular Jews yesterday threatened the stability of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government. 
The latest skirmishes involve the arrest of a prominent rabbi during a coffee shop brawl Saturday and a macabre case of body-snatching by Orthodox extremists of a Christian woman buried in a Jewish cemetery. 
Both sides want to change the tenuous balance between the secular majority of Israeli Jews and the increasingly active Orthodox community, which is about 20 per­cent oftheJewish population. 
The balance was largely es­tablished by David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister, who warned without concessions to the religious minority, Israel would face a 

·;~J·:::~:nc:e~::l~: ::::::: 
pu lie debate about the precedence of sraeli law over ancient Jewish Ia . or halacha, which was last codified in the 12th century. 
The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party threatened to leave Shamir's coalition unless charges were dopped against Baruch Salomon, the chief rabbi of Petah Tikva, a town of 130,000 near Tel Aviv. 
Salomon was arrested after leading hundreds of Orthodox Jews in a demonstration against the opening of the Garden of Eden cof­fee house on Saturday ~ the Sab­bath. Halacha forbids commerce on the Sabbath. 
Windows were broken and furniture smashed in the brawl, but no one was badly hurt. Each side said the other threw the frrst punch. 
"There is no precedent for arrest­
ing a rabbi because he wanted to 
prevent a desu.ration of the Sab­
bath," said Avrah;.m Shapiro. 
He threatened that the four-man Agudat Israel faction he heads in the Knesset -parliament -would withdraw from the coalition. 
A walkout would leave Shamir with only 60 of Parliament's 120 seats and vulnerable to moves to topple the government. 
The observance of the Sabbath in each town is set by the city council. Traditionally Tel Aviv and Haifa are generally open on Saturdays while Jerusalem and many smaller towns close down.

Religious Jews saythe decision by the new city council in Petah Tikva, dominated by the Labor Party, upset the status quo. But secular Jews say the council was within its rights. 
Many Israelis saw the violence as new evidence of a willingness by religious zealots to resort to force to impose their will. 
Last week, extremists exhumed the decomposing body ofTeresa An­gelovitch, a Christian who married a Jew, from its 2-year-old grave in a Jewish cemetety in Rishon Lezion. The media gave wide coverage to the incident while the Supreme Court and Parliament debated whether the body should be reburied in its original plot or moved to a non-Jewish cemetery as required by ancient Jewish law. 
The court ordered the body returned and a parliamentary com­mittee ruled that Jewish law takes second place to state law in cases of conflict. But the ruling was unaccep­table to OrthodoxJews. 
"Rabbis are responsible for the laws of the Sabbath. They are above all secular laws," said Agudat Israel's Menachem Porush after the coffee house melee.

Notre Dame is widely considered to be the premier Catholic educational institution in America. Consequently, the views and at­titudes ofthe faculty and students can have an impact on those of us who are not privileged to he a part ofyour university. 
That is why l am very concerned about the prevalent anti-military attitude I have found 
Drew Hamilton 
Guest Column 
when I visit the Notre Dame campus. Some of 
the most hospitable students on campus have 
expressed the sentiment that a Catholic uni­
versity has no business sponsoring ROTC 
programs -that military service is somehow incongruous with good Christian living. 
Further, the many campus advocates ofdis­armament apparently are unhappy to see your ROTC cadets training for military service. These attitudes greatly concern me and indi­cate that many students do not understand either the ROTC program or the American military profession. 
Perhaps the greatest American military leader, General of the Army Dougla~ MacAr­thur, best expressed a soldiers' attitude towards war in his address before Congress in 19S I. MacArthur said that no soldier wanted war, because they were the ones who had to most suffer through the privations and hor­rors ofwar. 
Anyone who seriously believes that the American military establishment promotes or fosters war clearly does not understand the American form of government which places the military establishment under civilian con­trol. 
I challenge anyone to cite an example where a serving American military officer directly involved us in a premeditated of­fensive war. Rather, I would cite the examples of American military restraint in the face of extreme provocations -where American fighting men have been asked to sacrifice their lives in limited warfare to maintain the greater peace. 
In the regiment I serve in, we remember that those who served before us in our regi­ment helped win our independence, helped to preserve the Union and helped to end domination in Europe and Asia 2' well as their 
accompanying genocidal policies. 

These feats of arms were as honorable as any ofour campaigns regardless ofhow those campaigns were politically handled. 
More recently, we in the Army have had to suffer for our role in Vietnam. We were or­dered to go there by our civilian government. Once there we were forced to fight in a hazy limited war. Nonetheless, we met and defeated the communists in most engage­ments, contrary to what was subsequently reported. 
When we left Vietnam we were chastised for the loyal service we gave and had to silent­ly watch the horrors the communists inflicted on Southeast Asia. 
Those who are still beating their breasts over our Vietnam experience might feel bet­ter if they recall the abominations of the Pol Pot regime which slaughtered millions of their own people or the ongoing detention, murder and re-education that is such apart of . the new Vietnamese government. 
Today, in the face of the current disarma­ment hysteria, I would challenge anyone to demonstrate where weakness has led to any­thing but war. In the tranquil environment of Notre Dame, it may be easy to ignore Russian expansionism. Since I graduated and was com­missioned at Texas Tech University, Angola, Nicaragua and most ofAfghanistan have fallen under communist rule. 
The threat is there. Anyone who under­stands communism understands that they cannot co-exist with us. Freedom is anathema to a totalitarian state and an intolerable threat. Communist military writings are clearly oriented toward attacking the West, not defending themselves from us. 
A detailed study ofthe military balance and what forces are deployed where illustrates this very clearly; much more clearly than the "we're all going to be destroyed so what's the difference" attitude. A visit to the Berlin Wall could be a real eye-opener for the Soviet apologists. 
The military science faculty represent a unique collection of military and educational 
experts. They have been assigned all over the 
world, have been asked to work impossible 
hours and have had to find time to continue 
their education in the midst of all that. The 
cadets will be commissioned and literally be 
assigned all over the world from the 38th 
parallel in Korea to the Elbe River in Germany. 
When you graduate from Notre Dame and 
come back for a football weekend, you might 
think of your buddies slogging through the 
mud in Germany or standing in a snowstorm 
in Korea. You might also remember that your 
right to hold and share your opinions is 
guarded and protected by your servicemen 
and women. 
We in the service want and need your sup­
port, not your disapproval. From personal ex­
perience I can tell you that it is very 
depressing to come back home from five 
weeks ofintensive desert maneuvers and have 
the first newspaper you've read in a month teJ 
you what a bunch of war-mongering skunks 
we are in the service. 
No one wants peace more than the profes­
sional soldier. Before you consider the role of 
ROTC in a Catholic university, consider th,.e 
role of a Catholic university in a communist 
country. Don't let your ivy-covered towei:s 
become ivory towers.

any otre arne seniors lose

qualities students possess that will make them valuable employees. "An interview," says Arnold, "is the one and only time when it's o.k. to speak about yourselfwithout somehow sounding rude or bragging." Any kind ofspecial honor or scholarship should always be mentioned, as well as participation in extracurricular activities and volunteer work. 
Low grade point averages do not necesssarily make it impossible for students to get jobs, as long as they indicate improvements in grades or explain what interfered with their academic work. 
Many students also make the mistake ofexpressing great uncer­tainty about what type ofjob they want. "Unfortunately," Arnold states, "employers interpret that as a failure to think about it." Eye contact issomething to remember when interviewing, emphasizes

Front 'Guntby' to 'Love Boat:' the world of the 'idiot box' 
by Chri~ Fraser 
feature. columnist 
A
s a second semester senior who is taking something less than a demanding academic schedule, I have had some time to watch a bit oftelevison lately. In general, I must say that it's not a prettysight. The following are a few observations on the world ofthe "idiot box" from the perspective ofa college student. 
It's probably fair to say that today's collegians comprise the first true TV generation. When we were born in the early 1960s, televi­sion had already emergedfrom its formative years and was entrench­ing itself as an American institution. Color televison was becominga status symbol and multi-telvision households were becoming the norm in middle-class society. 
Walter Cronkite told us the way things were. Aguy who called himself Captain Kangaroo was a favorite ofpre-schoolers. And Satur­day mornings became the haven for those mindless, violent bits of animation that Walt Disney had made famous: cartoons. There may be no better baby-sitter for tired parentson a Saturday morningthan three channels ofcartoons. 
Some folks grew up with Shirley Temple. Other generations grew up with "Superman" comic books, hanging around the soda shop, and going to quarter movies to see Roy Rogers and a newsreel. 
We grew up with "Batman," the "Flintstones," and "The Brady Bunch." Our childhood memories are filled with the episodes, the characters, and even the polished faces that smiled at us from com­mercials. I suspect that even as youngsters, most ofus sensed that women weren't really so happy when theywere scrubbingfloors or washing clothes as those ads suggested. 
Television tried to package our childhood into half-hour seg­
ments, each carefully designed, so that all conflicts would be 
resolved before the last commercial. The TV world was a place for 
happinessand heroism. Who could forget the wonderful dialogue of "Lassie," for instance. 
Lassie:Bark, bark, bark. 
Human: You mean the barn's on fire? 
Lassie: Bark, bark, bark. 
Human:And Timmy's inside? 
Lassie:Bark, bark, bark. 
Human: You're right, we'd better go! 
I suppose that was a nice way to see the world as an innocent 
child. 
Today, television has grown bigger than ever. The advent ofthe cable now makes it possible to receive scores ofstations. I once thought cable TV would be the greatest innovation since sliced bread. It gives you movies, video music, countless syndicated re­runs and even a 24-hour sports channel. 
And, yet, evenwith 73 channels, I find that I rarely stumble across anything worthwhile. I think the best thing about cable is that if you've gone through all the stations to see what's on, you've wasted enough time to feel justified in starting from the beginning to see if anything new has just begun. 
Television here at Notre Dame is another story altogether. On­campus students get just the three network affiliates and the local public channel. Reception from the dorms is less than sterling even on these. You also never know when a South Bend station will decide to preempt "Love Boat" to show you Indiana High School basketball. 
But college students don't really watch too much TV, I hope. Per­haps we just have too much studying, or perhaps our interest has worn thin after 20 years ofwatching. Maybe we are beginning to see that as we have grown up, the quality oftelevison has not. With few exceptions, so-called sitcoms (TV execs love to use lingo like sit­coms) are juvenile, sexist, boring insults to our intelligence. "Action/Adventure" shows are more ofthe same (ever watch the "A­team?") 
And to top it all off, some company called Nielsen installs some black boxes in a few homes, draws up a few statistics and tells us what the American public likes to watch. Networks, ofcourse, pat­tern their existence on these results and thus some ofthe few quality programs that spring up are unceremoniously cancelled. "Paper Chase" and "The NBC Overnight News" come to mind. Meanwhile, shows like "Three's Company" and "Laverne and Shirley" spent year after year on the top ofthe charts. 
H.L. Mencken once said that no one ever went broke under­estimating the intelligence (or taste) ofthe American people. Mr. Mencken would have had a field day with some ofNielsens higher­rated programming. 
I didn't really intend this to be an opinionated tirade against the entire television industry. There are, ofcourse, some programs that provide entertainment, education oreven intellectual stimulation. It could also be argued that televison onlygives us what we want. But it is, I believe, a bit sad that while television has grown bigger, it has not matured much since the days when we ran home from school to watch "Speed Racer" or "Gumby." 
II. 
Lassiter must steal ten million dol­

lars in unset diamonds from the Ger­
man embassy (to finance Nazi 
intelligence operations) or go to jail 
for a very long time. In the process, 
he must dump his girlfriend (Jane 
Seymour) for a Nazi vamp (Lauren 
Hutton). 
Lauren Hutton is perfectly cast as the evil Kari, who finds pleasure in other people's pain. In one scene, she gives a sweet grin after tasting the spot ofblood splattered on her cheek from a nearby boxing match. 
Jane Seymour is not only beautiful as Sara, Lassiter's girl, but she takes what would normally be a weak, standard role and gives it vitality and importance. 
Watching over Lassiter are two contrasting characters, Becker (Bob Hoskins) and Breeze (Joe Regal­buto). Veteran actor Hoskins is menacing as the police chiefBecker. His stone face and neanderthal body put meaning behind his threats toward Lassiter. Joe Regalbuto plays the FBI agent still wet behind the ears. He is frrst-rate as a passive agent who is not always too sure about the job he has to do. 
"High Road to China" was any­thing but furthering for Selleck's career in motion pictures. Luckily for him, "Lassiter" is a vast improve­ment. In this movie he makes the transition from television to movies with the theme he knows best: cops and robbers. He carries himselfwith a certain ease that very few actors have. In this sense, he is almost as good as Cary Grant for this type of role. A very successful movie career is building for Tom Selleck, only if the successof"Magnum, P.I." will al­lowit. 
Director Roger Young is to be 

commended, not only for keeping 
the film moving, but also for avoid­
ing the use ofthe authentic 1930s' 
sets and props as crutches to give 
the film added artistic respectibility. 
He keeps the film on course. 
"Lassiter" deserves an uncondi­

tional recommendation. When the 
credits began to roll at the endofthe 
film, I was still looking for more of 
the movie. Ifyou don't get a chance 
to see it now, "Lassiter" should sell 
exceptionally well as a videocas­
sette.

anxious," said the quick-punching Clarke, "and he was countering pret­ty good." 
Two friends dueled at 145, with 
the tall and lanky Tom Lezynski 
defeating fellow boxing club officer 
Mike Latz. 
Latz was given a standing eight count in the ftrst round. In the second round, Lezynski began to connect with his lethal left, which Latz said beforehand he had wanted to avoid. 
"It was a brawl going in with a good friend," said the southpaw Lezynski. "I couldn't trade punches with him. Being left handed is the only thing that saved me." 
The 160-pound title bout was scheduled to feature novice Peter Reilly against Joe Beatty, but Reilly could not compete because of a broken nose suffered in the semi­finals. Dan Watzke, who lost to Reil­ly, took his place. After a relatively uneventful ftrst two rounds, Beatty came on in the third to defeat Watzke unanimously. 
"It really got me nervous not knowing who I was going to fight," said Beatty. "I had to change my strategy because I had to fight someone else." 
Ken Munro was given the un­enviable task of fighting John Gur­ganus for the 175-pound crown. Gurganus is a monster and a three­time runner-up in the Eastern Col­legiate Championships, and he 
would cause most people run the 
other way. 
Munro got Gurganus against the ropes early in the first, but after that it was all Gurganus. The closing mo­ments of the first round saw Gur­ganus throw a powerful right to the head of Munro, which left the junior teetering against the ropes. The referee appropriately gave Munro a 
standing eight count. "I was crippled from the first round on," said Munro. 
Munro bravely came out for the second round, but it didn't last long. Gurganus sent a left to the head of Munro, which left him seeing stars, and the fight was over at the 38 second mark ofthe second. 
"At the moment I wanted to keep fighting," said Munro, "but he would have leveled me." 
Mike Cray successfully defended his 185-pound crown with a unani­mous decision over Dennis Hill. Af­ter a couple of shots to the head by Cray, Hill was given a standing eight in the second round. 
The heavyweight bout featured freshman Byron Abraham against previous Bengal champion Larry Andreini. The senior was on the at­tack from the first bell. Abraham was tieing up Andreini a lot, so his corner wanted him to utilize the uppercm. 
"They wanted me to throw the uppercut," said Andreini, "but I didn't really know how to throw it." 
In the third, Abraham pushed Andreini into the ropes which resulted in a series ofAndreini com­binations to Abraham's head. Andreini won unanimously. 
With the other titles complete, the ring belonged to the super heavyweights, which had football players Marty Roddy and Chris Boer­ner squaring off. 
Boerner had a height and reach disadvantage, but he definitely had an advantage in quickness over the 280-pound Roddy. 
In the first round, Boerner threw several blows to Roddy's head which did damage. 
"He threw a strong right in the first," said Roddy, "and I heard bells." 
The second round was a slugfest with both fighters exchanging relentless blows to the head. The third was all Roddy with Boerner getting hit in the head many times, but a right to the head by Roddy ended it. Boerner hit the canvas, and the referee gave him a standing eight before stopping the contest at I :23. 
"I dropped my hand, and he got me." said the 220-pounder. "That was the one punch I didn't want to let through. I've never been hit that hard before."

KANSAS CI1Y (AP) -North Carolina, DePaul, Georgetown and Kentucky were made the top seeds in each region in the NCAA basket­ball tournament pairings announced yesterday. 
The top-ranked Tar Heels, who have lost twice in 29 games, will meet the winner of the first-round game.between Temple and St.John's in the East Regional. 
Georgetown, moved out of the East by the selection committee to the West, takes on the winner of the first-round game between Miami of Ohio and Southern Methodist. 
DePaul is the top seed in the Mid­west region and Kentucky in the Mideast.

the Associated Press Top 20 earlier this season, meets the winner of the Alabama-Birmingham vs. Brigham Young game in the Midweast, and DePaul, hoping to give retiring Coach Ray Meyer his first national championship, will go against the winner between Alabama and Il­linois State in the Midwest. 
Dave Gavitt, chairman ofthe nine­man Division 1 basketball commit­tee, said the overall strength of this tournament can be the best ever. 
"The No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in each 
region look awfully, awfully tough," 
he said. "They've had some great 
years and a lot ofgreat victories. The 
third through the eighth seeds, I 
won't be surprised at any results of 
those games. I don't see the term 
'upset' applying anywhere between 
the third seeds and the ninth seeds," 
Gavitt said. 
The biggest controversy of the selections may center on moving Georgetown, a Washington D.C., school, to the West. The Hoyas, Big East champions and NCAA runners­up in 1982, were No. 2 in The AP top Twenty last week They could move ahead of North Carolina, which lost to Duke in the Atlantic Coast Con­ference postseason tournament Saturday. 
The tournament, biggest and ric-· hest in collegiate history, begins tomorrow with the champions of the 10 weakest Division I con­ferences meeting in a "preliminary round" in Philadelphia and Dayton. Those five winners will advance to frrst-round action -around the country, beginning Thursday arid running through the weekend.

nosis on the junior is that he can go light in tomorrow's practice and may or may not play Wednesday night. 
Notre Dame cannot count on the services of fellow point guard JoJo Buchanan as his reoccuring ten­donitis has flared up again and he is doubtful for the remainder of the season. Should Howard be unable to go, freshman Scott Hicks will get the call. 
Although he will not start against Old Dominion, Tim Kempton will return to the Irish line-up Wednes­day. Phelps has indicated that the 
sophomore will play as much as he is 
able to. Ofcourse. in addition to any 
after effects of his hairline fracture, 
Kempton also will be battling his 
recent inactivity and any endurance 
problems that might cause. 
The team itself has been battling 
illness of late. Hicks, John Bowen, 
Cecil Rucker, and Kempton have all

to be the 200-yd. medley relay 
which was seeded an impressive 
fifth and cost the team precious 
points.

freestylt: and the 200-yd. medey 
relay. She went on to place 14th in 
the I00-yd. IM and anchor the 
record-breaking 400-yd. freestlyle 
relay which placed 12th in the finals. 
At the meet, Casey was named All­
American and Academic All­
American for her achievements in 
the pool as well a.~ in the classroom. 
Scratched from her strongest event the 100-yd. backstroke Senior Rosie Whalen competed in the 200­yd. backstroke, 400-and 800-yd. free relay. She was also named an All­American at the conclusion of the competition. 
Freshman Kennedy competed in 
the 200-yd. butterfly after being 
scratched from the I00-yd. event. 
She also helped Whalen, Julie 
Gschwind and Joyce Murtagh to 
their 13th place finish in the 800-yd. 
free relay. 
Junior Ellen Byrne, the fourth All­American named, was a member of the 200-and 400-yd. free relays while her teammates PattyJuckneiss competed in the I00-and 200-yd. backstroke. Sophomore Joyce Mur­tagh, a member ofthe 200-, 400-and 800-yd. free relay was also named an All-American for her season's perfor­mances. 
Surprisingly enough Coach Trees was not totally disappointed with the results of the meet. "Given everything that happened the team did very well," he said. "When things arc going against you, your charac­ter shows and these girls showed me just that. It would have been easy to pick up and quit, but we didn't. 
The team, in their last event, pulled together with the support of an enthusiastic crowd to break the school record in the 400-yd. free relay and put points on the board. 
The Belles can now look back on
the 1984 season with a sense of ac­complishment for acheiving their first winningrecord, producing four All-Americans and sma.~hing virtual­ly every varsity record standing from the 1983 season.1 •

been sick in recent days. Jim Dolan, in addition, is being plagued by a sore upper back. 
But despite all the injury problems of his team, Phelps remains confident that his team can do well in the NIT even though he feels that this year's field is a strong one. 
"I think that anytime you're talking about post-season play," said the Irish coach, "it's up for grabs. So that certainly gives us a chance. The students have to help get us through the first round, though. 
"It's quite a field we're going ur 

against. In fact, I0 ofthe teams easil} 
could have gone to the NCAA 
Tournament." 
Notre Dame fans can look forward 

to seeing the red, white, and blue 
basketballs again in the NIT this taking place next week. The semi­fmals and finals will take place March 26 and 28 at New York's Madison Square Garden. 
There is no bracketing ofteams in the NIT. Second round match-ups are not chosen until the first round is completed. The tournament com­mittee then decides who each ofthe remaining teams will play and where they will play. No team, however, can play host to more than two games.

Wednesday at home 
Irish face -Old Dominion in NIT 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Assistant Sports Editor 
After nearly three hours ofwaiting last night, the word finally came. The Irish would be playing Old Dominion in the first round of the NIT Tournament this Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the ACC. 
Student tickets are on sale all day 
today through S p.m. at Gate 3 ofthe 
ACC. They are priced at four dollars 
and will be sold on a first-come-first­
serve basis with no regard to class. 
Old Dominion is certainly a team that most Notre Dame student!; know little about, as the Irish hav< never played the Monarchs, who art 20-10 this season playing out of the Sun Belt Conference. They, however, were only 3-6 playing away from their Norfolk, Virg., home. 
As far as Old Dominion is con­cerned, it would have gained an automatic bid to the NCAA's had it been able to beat UAB in the finals of 

the Sun  Belt  Conference Tourna­ 
ment.  
The  Notre  Dame  players  and  

coaches were somewhat hesitant in reacting to playing the Monarchs,

because, like the students, they did not know a whole lot about Old Dominion. The Irish were lucky in one sense in that the Monarchs were one ofabout halfofthe 32 team NIT field that the Irish coaches had in their videotape library. 


Irish win season finale over Evansville Aces 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
It has been a long year for the 
Notre Dame women's basketball 
team as it has struggled to reach .500 
all season long. With Saturday's 80­
68 victory over Evansville, though, 
the team ended 1983-84 at 14-14, 
just averting a losing record. 
The win over the Aces was hardly 
an upset -Evansville finished its 
season 4-22 -but it was definitely 
important for the Irish to end the 
season on a winning note and keep 
from falling below .500 for the first 
time in three years.· 
The Aces did not lay down and die 
for Notre Dame, though. Paced by 
~ard Shelly Brand's 26 points and 
forward Denise Spear's 18, 
Evansville was able to keep the Irish 
from running away. Although the 
margin never g(>t closer than six in 
the second half, the Irish could not 
keep their hosts more than 12 points away. 
From the outset of the game, Evansville showed that they were going to make things difficult. When 

Brand hit her third long jump shot in 
a row, the Aces moved out to an 8-2 
lead. 
However, Notre Dame quickly closed the gap, and the teams traded baskets until there were 12 minutes left in the half. Then Jenny Klauke, 
naking her last appearance in a .'lotre Dame uniform, came off the bench to spark the Irish. A 14-14 game soon turned into a 30-22 rout, and the lead stretched to 42-28 before the Aces scored the next five points to go into the lockerroom down 42-33. 
The second half continued much like the first. Brand and Spear kept the Aces in the game, as did the referees who sent Evansville to tht foul line 26 times in the game However, the Irish, led by Carrie Bates and Trena Keys who paced the team with 14 points apiece, were just too much for Evansville. 
The highlight of the day was the performance of Klauke. The senior scored 12 points in her final game and helped the Irish open a big lead. The only other senior on the team ~aptain Theresa Mullins, also score• in her farewell appearance. 
After watching a tape of Old Dominion last night, Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps had some words ofpraise for Old Dominion. 
"Don't take them lightly," said Phelps ofthe Monarchs. "Believe me they've got some talented athletes. And you've got to remember that anytime a team goes to a post-season tournament, it's just looking to do one thing and that's win it." 
Besides making it to the finals of 
ts conference tournament, Old 
)ominion lost to Dayton in 
)ayton Saturday by only one point. 
fhe Monarchs also gave Maryland a good game earlier this year before dropping to the Terps by 11 points. 
The Irish, you may remember, also lost to the Flyers in Dayton but did upset then fifth-ranked Maryland earlier this year in the ACC. 
Injuries continue to be a problem for Notre Dame and things got worse yesterday as the Irish were getting ready ·for the NIT. Joe Howard, Notre Dame's only true point guard still able to play this season, went down with an ankle in­jury during yesterday's workout. X­rays on his ankle were negative but it was determined that he had tore the capsule on the inside of the ankle. 
Howard was walking around on crutches last night with a temporary cast on. That cast was removed later in the evening, and the current prog­

Fierce action marks Bengal Bout final~ 
ByJOE BRUNETII 
Sportswriter 

A champion in any sport is never 
free from the criticism of the fans. 
But, after Friday night's Bengal Bout 
fmals, no one can question Angelo 
Perino's ability as a boxer. 

Perino won his third Bengal Bout 
championship in the 16S-pound 
weight class over Ed Bulleit. 
From the first bell everyone knew 
Perino meant business. During the 
first round, the senior threw all lefts 
because of a hand injury he suffered 
just over a week ago. 

"Because I broke my hand," said 
the Boxing Club president, "I had to 
be conservative with it." 

Bulleit had a hard time getting at 
Perino due to Perino's quickness, 
but at the end of the first round Bul­
leit trapped Perino in the corner for 
a few good shots. 

Unfortunately for Bulleit, the second round saw the emergence of Perino's right, although sparingly used. In the third round, he caught Bulleit in the corner and landed a flurry ofdamaging lefts and rights. 
"It was a tough fight," said Perino afterward. "He had more reach. I was trying to land the right." 
The 54th Finals opened with a bloodbath in the 130-pound divi­sion between law student and ex­Bengals championJ.P. Holbrook and MattCoash

'"Ia ik b mund he hit me on die jaw and It burt me," said Coash. So I lltartc:d to throw combinations to protect myself." 
Coash, a sophomore, took over in the second, keying off on Holbrook until the ex-champion's face was a pool of blood. By the end of the round Coash had the 3S78 fans on their feet. 
The third round was a flurries of blows by both fighters, but Coash won unanimously. "It was long, hard, and it hurt," said Coa~h. "But, this (the gold medal) is worth it." 
The 140-pound fight was all Tony Bonacci as he beat Frank Maneri un­animously. Maneri wa~ hindered throughout the fight by his reach disadvantage, which kept him from getting inside on Bonacci. 
"He has a little longer reach," said Maneri, "so, I couldn't get inside on him. Plus, overall he had better defense than me." 
Maneri's roommate. Beresford Clarke, fared better, winning his second Bengal Bout championship by defeating Mike Mazza for the 1SS­pound title. 
Clarke's deadly left hook troubled Mazza throughout the fight, and he wa~ given a standingeight in the first round after Clarke sent a flurry of blows to his head.

SMC swimmers show ~character at Nationals 
By KATHLEEN NICHOLSON .;ports Writer 
"It takes a really bad situation t< 
. tllow a team to show the true class it tas," said Coach Scott Trees of his .;aint Mary's swimmers after their 
return from the national competi­ion in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. 
Before their departure to the !~AlA swimming and diving cham­J•ionships, expectations and spirits 
•vere high. The team was expected lO place among the top fifteen teams but faced with more than their share ofbad luck, the swimmers ended up in twenty-first place among a field of approximately fifty teams. 
The icy weather not only ham­pered their trek but a sudden illness struck one team member shortly before competition began, which forced Trees to do some last-minute roster re-organizing. 
Sophomore Amy Studer, seeded in the top five in her four events, suf­fered from the flu and a kidney infec­tion which forced her to scratch from the entire three-day competi­tion. 
On the first day of competition the team was hit with more <lisap­ppointment. The II th-seeded 400­yd. medley relay composed of Gail Casey, Rosie Whalen, Kathleen Ken­nedy, and Ellen Byrne raced to a 
14th place. Three disqualifications in another heat of the race pushed the Belles into eleventh place and consequently into the finals, but being ill-informed on their qualifica­tion the four members missed the race and were heavily penalized.
