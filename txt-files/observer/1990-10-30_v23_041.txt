Healthier food would improve students' lives 
I spent October break complaining to my mother about how difficult it is to main­tain good eating habits at Notre Dame, when the four food groups are: the pizza family; the Alison Cocks burger and fries fam­ily; the chips, pretzels, Editor-in-Chief and other snack food family; and the dessert family. 

Periodically, I suffer from the irrational urge to purge my body of junk food (and a few pounds into the bargain), particularly immediately before social and professional situations which require me to behave like a civilized human being. 
These harebrained endeavors border on masochism because I've found that "eating right" at Notre Dame usually restricts me to about two or three possible meals. 
I was pleasantly surprised to discover 
that the dining halls have introduced the 
lighter fares during meals. Before this 
week, I found that healthy eating in the din­

~­
ing hall usually meant heading for the salad bar. 
No matter how wide the variety of vegeta­bles, my tolerance for rabbit food, and therefore my desire to eat healthy meals, usually lasts about three days. Low-calorie, low-cholesterol selections are much-needed additions, but efforts should not stop there. 
If I miss a meal, or skip the dining hall, what then? If either my car or the weather is feeling contrary, I'm stuck with food I can find on campus. 
Anyone with the metabolism rate to com­pensate for their food choices can subsist on Huddleburgers with cheese, fries, chips, pizza and candy without having to worry about effects on the waistline. 
Mere mortals aren't so fortunate, and find few alternatives to this fare outside the dining halls. Although Flavor of the Orient in the Huddle offers a salad bar and a good stir-fry, it closes at 6:30 p.m. After that, only the ice-cream shop, the Bull Pit Grill, 
Leprechaun Pizza and the deli are open. 
Needless to say, the first three can be eliminated right away in the quest for healthy food, and aside from ready-made salads and popcorn, there is little in the deli that is particularly nutritious. The same holds true for dorm foodsales and vending machines. 
No wonder eating disorders prevail on campus: dieting is difficult and hunger after 

1 
6:30 p.m. usually means ordering fast food and feeling guilty later. 
It surprises me that Notre Dame has not followed the health craze which is pervading America. Cliches such as "freshman fifteen" and the more direct "I'm so fat" can be heard less frequently, but first the Univer­sity must provide better means for students to lead the healthy lifestyles many others across the country have already chosen.

Panelists talk about women in business 
By CLAIRE ROBINSON 
News Writer 
There is a "glass ceiling" in the business world that pre­vents women from gaining ac­cess to upper level positions, according to panelists at a re­cent discussion about women in the business world. 
The panelists discussed a survey in the Wall Street Jour­nal indicating that many women, as well as men, have no desire to break through this glass ceiling. Individuals are ei­ther perfectly content with their positions, or their jobs are not a priority in their lives, according panelist Judith Hennessey. 
"The ceilings are starting to crack," said panelist Thomas Nessinger, "We cannot isolate a group and say we won't count on them." 
Seventy-one percent of the women surveyed believed that a glass ceiling did, in fact, exist, while 73 percent of the men surveyed said it did not. accord­ing to Phyllis Washington Stone, another panelist. 
"For many decades, women have been in the work force playing second fiddle, creating the harmony that makes work and the work force continue in the direction that we want it to go," noted Kathleen Hessert, the moderator of the discussion titled, "Women in Business-Is­sues in a Changing Corporate Culture." 
"But after years of sitting next to that first chair, it no longer is enough ... we're hearing more and more discord ... because harmony is no longer their goal," she said. 
The four panelists included Hennessey, a student in the Notre Daine Executive MBA program and an environmental compliance manager; Lauren Strach, an assistant professor of

"Women who will be success­ful are the ones who will jump up and go aftnr what they want like men do," said Nessinger. llowever, he said that while men are aware that they can achieve high positions in busi­nesses, women are often not even sure of this. 
Closing comments were deliv­ered by Mary Cunningham Agee, president of Semper En­terprises and executive director of the Nurturing Network. 
Agee (ocused upon the three stages of change necessary to incorporate women into the work force. First, legislative change is required. As a result, behavioral changes in the .f 
r 
workplace ensue. These two steps are external. 
The most difficult change, said Agee, is the internal change in the attitude of both men and women. 
She said that the most impor­tant thing for female newcom­ers in the business place to do is to try to empathize with co­workers, who may have never worked with a woman before. Women should be aware that male discomfort may manifest itself as prejudice. 
"Winning means making sure your (corporate) ladder is leaning up against the right wall," she said. 
The discussion was sponsored by the Advisory Council to the College of Business Ad­ministration, held in conjunc­tion with the "Year of Women."

Cyanide spills into Lynches River 

JEFFERSON, S.C. (AP) ­Millions of gallons of a dilute cyanide solution spilled from a gold refinery and biologists Monday searched along the Lynches River to see if it had harmed livestock or wildlife. 
Elsewhere, oil from a coke plant's discharge pipe spilled into the Monongahela River Monday at Pittsburgh, creating a shimmering, 4-mile-long slick, authorities said. 
Health and wildlife officials in South Carolina reported no fish kills or problems with animals that might drink from the river. 
The spill posed little threat to drinking water supplies but of­ficials warned residents to keep animals from tainted water. 
About 11 million gallons of the solution of sodium cyanide had spilled by midday Monday into the Little Fork Creek after an earthen dam broke Sunday at the Brewer Gold Mining Co. The reservoir held about 13 million to 14 million gallons. 
The liquid contained only 50 parts of sodium cyanide per million, said Richard Carnes. director of the Chesterfield County Emergency Prepared­ness Division. 
Undiluted sodium cyanide would be fatal, but the spill created only a minimal health risk to people and animals be­cause it would be significantly diluted after mixing with river water, said Thorn Berry, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Environmental. 
However, the cyanide wasn't the only threat from the spill. 
"Our concern right now is not so much the cyanide but levels of copper we're seeing in the discharge," Berry said. Some copper compounds also can kill aquatic life, he said. 
The sodium cyanide solution began spilling Sunday after­noon from a holding pond at Brewer, officials said. Brewer uses sodium cyanide to sepa­rate gold from ore. 
The holding pond is about 2,000 feet from the Little Fork Creek and two miles from Lynches. 

Carnes said recent heavy rain in the area might have weak­ened the dam. 
Crews worked to diverted re­maining chemical in the reser­voir into Brewer's discharge treatment system to be neutral­ized with chlorine and hydrogen peroxide, Berry said. 
Brewer officials did not re­turn telephone calls Monday. 
Wildlife and health officials took water samples from the river along a series of stations along the river, said Berry. 
Marine biologists in three boats covered the Lynches, creeks and tributaries in search of dead fish, said John Evans of the-state Department of Wildlife and Marine Resources. Game biologists searched the banks for deer, fox, raccoon and waterfowl, he said.

It's a scary thought. First Semester's half over. Where has it gone? To Stanford, some might argue. Or to many spilt beers and good intentions to study and pray and deal with those growth issues and help at the Homeless Center. 
No matter, it's now gone. That's not a time to feel badly, but rathr to make some manageable goals for the remainder of the semester. Here are a few categories: 
1. 
Studies. They come first. If you find yourself just staring out the window or thinking about love's labors lost, study with others, maybe once a week per subject. That's manageable. 

2. 
Alcohol. Policies aside, it still plays a dominant role in the social life of Notre Dame students. Maybe a new sort of drinking game r.1uld be devised for the remainder of the semester: count the drinks. Be acutely aware of how much you drink, and reflect on how you feel about that. Talk it over with someone you trust who won't lecture you, but will be honest. A minor step, but a beginning. 

3. 
Socializing. Think of one new way to have fun, that isn't in any way even potentially destructive. You have six weeks to come up with one! 

4. 
Sex. Find a safe person with whom to reflect on your 


continuously emerging sexuality. Get just a bit more honest about it. Take your time. 
5. 
Prayer. Add three minutes a week to whatever time you currently spend praying: the time spent listening to God's groanings within you. Just listen. Don't analyze. Just listen. Maybe that'll bring you to a total of three minutes a week of prayer. That's ok. 

6. 
Service. Volunteer one more time than you did the first quarter, to help someone who will increase your image of who God is. 

7. 
You. Be it! 



Happy New Quarter!

Harvard will sponsor conference on AIDS 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) ­llarvard University said Mon­day it will sponsor the annual international AIDS conference in 1992, four months after threatening to cancel the forum unless the United States re­moved travel restrictions on p1~ople infected with AIDS. 
The conference, the principle forum for presenting scientific information on the fight against the disease, will go ahead in the last week of May 1992, school officials said. 
In .June, the llarvard AIDS Institute threatened to with­draw as sponsor and cancel the conference to protest a U.S. policy making AIDS infection on1~ of several contagious dis­eases for which foreigners could be barred from the coun­try. 
But under a revised immigra-
Tight Security 
tion bill passed by Congress over the weekend, Health Secretary Louis Sullivan would have the authority to remove AIDS and other diseases from the medical list for which a person may be denied entry. 
Sullivan has repeatedly said there is no reason to exclude people with AIDS, because the disease is not passed casually, but only by exchanges of blood or body fluids or by sexual con­tact. 
The measure went to Presi­dent Bush, who has indicated he will sign it as early as this week. 
The conference is expected to attract about 15,000 re­searchers, policy makers, community organizers and AIDS patients, Harvard officials said.

Scientists find new danger in cocaine 
NEW YORK (AP) -People who drink alcohol while using cocaine create a third brain­targeting substance that may help boost their euphoria and may contribute to a puzzling form of overdose death, re­searchers say. 
The research may help ex­plain a preliminary finding that adding alcohol to cocaine use produced 21.5 times the risk of an overdose death for people with s.evere coronary heart dis­ease, scientists said. 
Drinking is frequently com­bined with cocaine, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
New studies show that a sub­stance called cocaethylene, formed in the liver from alcohol and cocaine, reaches the brain and mimics some actions of co­caine there. 

Further studies of cocaethy­lene may give leads for medica­tions to treat cocaine addiction by blocking cocaine's effects, said study co-author Deborah Mash, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Miami School of Medicine. 
She and other researchers spoke in telephone interviews about the work. which was pre­sented Monday at the annual meeting of the Society for Neu­roscience in St. Louis. 
Scientists found that co­caethylene affects a brain-cell communication system thought to produce the euphoria that leads to cocaine addiction, she said. 
Prior research suggests that cocaine produces its "high" by intervening in this system, in which brain cells signal each other with a chemical called dopamine. After a dose of dopamine reaches its target cell, it is supposed to be brought back to its original home by molecules called transporters. But cocaine blocks this mechanism by bind­ing to transporters, keeping the signal turned "on" and produc­ing a sense of pleasure, scien­tists say. 

The new work shows that co­caethylene also binds to the transporters, suggesting it may boost cocaine's effect, Mash said. In addition, she said, it appears less able than cocaine to moderate the euphoria through a second brain com­munication system. 
Another possible role of co­caethylene deals with cocaine overdose deaths in people with severe coronary artery disease.

Surgeon General warns not to mix Halloween with hops 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Surgeon General on Monday is­sued a pre-Halloween warning to the beer industry, saying it should avoid advertising prac­tices that encourage drinking among minors. 
"The beer industry should not capitalize on a season that youngsters look forward to with great anticipation to push their products," Dr. Antonia Novello said. 
"Halloween and hops do not mix." 
Novello said breweries and their advertising agencies were sending the wrong message to minors, that alcohol consump­tion was acceptable for children under the legal drinking age. She said they should put larger warning labels on containers and revise advertising practices. 
"We would like the industry to share in the responsibility," she said. "Children can either consciously or unconsciously be affected by both print and elec­tronic ads" that for the most part never show the harmful ef­fects of alcohol consumption. 
Alcohol abuse was "the num­ber one substance abuse prob­lem among American youth," and indications were that the situation was getting worse. Children were being enticed by advertisements for so-called "soft liquors," including beer, wine and wine coolers, she added. 
The alcohol industry annually conducts its most intensive ad­vertising campaign between Oc­tober and January. The Na­tional Coalition on Television Violence estimated that before the average American child turns 16, he would see 75,000 television scenes where alcohol is consumed or its use encour­aged.

S&L 'whistleblowers' might be getting rich 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Sav­ings and loan whistleblowers could get rich under legislation passed by Congress that pro­vides rewards for information leading to fraud prosecutions and the recovery of ill-gotten gains. 
The provisions, enacted as part of the crime bill passed over the weekend, offer re­wards of up to $50,000 for in­formation leading to prosecu­tion of S&L crooks. 
Whistleblowers who help Jus­tice Department investigators trace ill-gotten gains would share a percentage of the seized money if the attorney general declared the informa­tion was crucial to its recovery. 
The bounty provisions would only apply to people who are not participants in S&L crimes, said Laurence Urgenson, head of the Justice Department's fraud section. 
But "there's a category of in­dividuals on the periphery, who know about it, never have been knowing participants, but could

to provide incentive for some­

one to come forth," Urgenson 
said. "It could be millions of 
dollars in certain kinds of in­
stances, certainly tens of thou­
sands in many," he said. 
A person who helps the gov­

ernment recover S&L money 
would share 20 percent to 30 
percent of the first $1 million, 
10 percent to 20 percent of the 
next $4 million and 5 percent to 
10 percent of the next $5 mil­
lion, according to the bill. 
The bill also creates a so­called S&L kingpin crime that carries a sentence of 1 0 years to life and lines up to $10 mil­lion for individuals and $20 mil­lion for corporations. 
The "continuing financial crimes enterprise" is defined as a fraud continuing over a two­year period by three or more people in which at least one person gains $5 million. 
S&L legislation passed before Congress adjourned for the year may not include extra money to bail out failing thrifts. 
But the crime bill raises from $50 million to $162.5 million the Justice Department's an­nual appropriation for fraud investigations. 
Last week, Congress appro­priated slightly less -$160 million -for the current fiscal year. 
The legislation also creates an eight-member commission to study the cause of the S&L crisis. Six of the members would be appointed by Congress and two by the presi­dent. 
The panel would have the power to subpoena testimony and evidence. The attorney general or the heads of the Office of Thrift Resolution and the Resolution Trust Corp. could veto commission attempts to take evidence or testimony to protect an on-going investiga­tion. 
Five members of the commis­sion could vote to override such vetoes. 
The Bush administration had opposed creation of the com­mission, saying it would inter­fere with investigations. But it agreed to compromise lan­guage. 
The bill also: 

authorizes 
court-approved wiretapping of S&L officials suspected of wrongdoing 

expands 
the list of crimes under which ill-gotten gains would be subject to civil forfei­ture.

27 years. It was signed at the chateau of Rambouillet, 33 miles southwest of Paris. 
"We have done a great deal of work in a short time," Gor­bachev said at a joint news con­ference with Mitterrand. "This reflects the new level of coop­eration and understanding be­tween the leadership of our two countries which enables us to obtain results." 
The broad agreement calls for regular political consulta­tions. It also provides for coop­eration in energy, non-military nuclear science, transportation, high-definition television and telecommunications. 
France and the Soviet Union pledge to "reinforce European solidarity" and seek the cre­ation of a European confedera­tion. 
The treaty promised French assistance as the Soviet Union shifts to a market economy, and French help in arranging accords between Moscow and the 12-nation European Com­munity.

Poll: trust in USSR leaders plummets 
MOSCOW (API -Less than one in 10 Soviet respondents in a new poll expressed full sup­port for their leaders and half said they had no confidence at all. 
The poll by the independent All-Union Center for Public Opinion indicated that support for President Mikhail Gor­bachev and his government, headed by Prime Minister Niko­lai Ryzhkov, has hit the lowest point since Gorbachev took power in 1985. 
The poll, released by the in­dependent news service Inter­fax, found only 6 percent of re­spondents gave full support when asked, "!low much do you trust the national leadership now?" 
Thirty-two percent expressed qualified support and 50 per­cent had no confidenee at all. The rest had no opinion, Inter­fax reported. 
The results were based on answers by 1,356 people in It regions across the country, ln­terfax said. However, it gave no margin of error and didn't say when the survey was done. There was no answer to phone queries at the center late Mon­day. 
A poll conducted last summer by the liberal weekly Ogonyok put support for Gorbachev's Communist Party at 30 percent, below the Red Army, the Rus­sian Orthodox Church and the national Supreme Soviet legis­lature. 
The latest poll was released two weeks after Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peaee Prize for helping end the Cold War. In contrast to his worldwide popularity, Gorbachev's domes­tic standing has been sliding for years, even more severely the last year as shortages have worsened and nearly all the 15 republics have declared some form of sovereignty. 
The poll also asked whether the emergency powers given to Gorbachev by the Supreme So­viet last month will "help stabi­lize the country's economy."

Man praises 'Fountain of Youth' 
WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) ­Robert Bensing doesn't feel cheated by his brief flirtation with an age-reversing hormone that some fancy may be the doorway to a futuristic Fountain of Youth. 
In fact, the 72-year-old re­tired chemist has found his joints no longer ache constantly with arthritis and his skin is firmer, giving him the appearance and vitality of a man much his junior. 
"I feel a little more ener­getic," said Bensing, who rel­ishes being called "son" by a friend about his age and now can spend more time garden­ing. 
He stopped taking the hor­mone more than 1 1/2 years ago, and doctors predicted the age-reversing symptoms of his therapy would fade within a few months. 
"Theoretically, I lost all that, but I don't feel that I did," Bensing said recently his rural Waukegan home. "Since the benefits didn't go away, I don't feel cheated. It was worth it. If it contributes to the advance­ment of medical knowledge, we don't feel cheated." 
For a year, Bensing injected himself three times weekly with the human growth hormone. Within six months of the first treatment, he could unscrew bottle caps with ease, mow the law without tiring easily and sit through lengthy car trips -all of which would have been difficult months earlier. 
Tests revealed the hormone treatments helped shrink body fat, restore lean body mass lost through aging and increase the thickness of Bensing's skin. 
"I noticed right off he was doing things much faster," said Bensing's Wife, Alice, 57. "He was more willing to go places and do things than before." 
The growth hormone taken by Bensing and 19 other older male volunteers is a synthetic version of one produced natu­rally in humans. As one ages, the natural production of the hormone fades and eventually stops, researchers have learned. 
Daniel Rudman, an endocri­nologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin in suburban Mil­waukee and director of the experiment, said researchers have determined the hormone injections reversed aging in the body composition of elderly men by as much as 20 years. 
Rudman and his fellow re­searchers reported this sum­mer in the New England Jour­nal of Medicine that the hor­mone increased lean body mass in patients by 9 percent, decreased fat tissue by 14 percent and thickened skin by 7 percent. 
It does not, however, affect failing eyesight, hearing loss or degeneration of brain cells. The improvements strictly involved the patient's body mass. 
Rudman, 62, was among a group of physicians in the 1960s who used human growth hormone to treat abnormally short children. He decided to experiment with the hormone on the elderly after watching his parents grow old and frail in a nursing home. 

The hormone, onc.e only available by extraction from human corpses, now is pro­duced through genetic engineering. But regular treatment costs $14,000 a year for adults. 
Experts warn it is too soon to determine the severity of side-effects or whether the hormone could be produced cheaper and more readily. 
Most of the men in the experiment have declined to talk publicly since the study was published, some at "the advice of the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
Bensing, one of the first vol­unteers for the study, said the hormone lessened the crippling effects of arthritis. prompted a quicker recovery from a cataract operation and appeared to make a crushed spinal disk a bit sturdier. 
"There's a guy my age start­ing to call me 'son,' " Bensing said. "They said, 'You look great.'" 
When he began treatment, Bensing was told the possible side effects included an in­crease in blood pressure or blood sugar. But his only com­plaint was a numbness in his wrists, which he attributed to pressure from skin and muscle growth. It stopped once the therapy ceased, he said.

Cuba still bitter about 
28-year-old 
MEXICO CITY lAP) -The Cuban government Monday released a document on the 1962 missile crisis and reiterated its bitterness over the Soviet decision 28 years ago to remove the missiles without consulting with Cuba. 
The government news ag1H1cy Prensa Latina, in a dispat<:h monitored in Mexico City, ran a description of the events it said was culled from a 200-page secret document that Fidel Castro's government just released. 
"Twenty-eight years after the October Crisis that pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war, the Cubans maintain their daims from the era and reproach Nikita Khrushclwv for having excluded them from secret conversations," the article bngins. 
There appeared to be little new in tlw document. and its n~lease semned to be in the nature of nursing an old grudge at a time when relations between the Soviet Union and Cuba have hit a post-revolutionary low. 
Although tlw Soviet Union is still providing aid to Cuba, the Soviet prnss recently has pub­lishml a series of revealing, unflattering rnports, including a rarP portrait of Castro's per­sonal life that said he has 32 houses, a security contingent of 9,700 and live children by his "present wife." 
Cuba has dedicated a new monument on the launch site for the rocket that shot down an American spy plane during the crisis. Prensa Latina re­ported in a separate dispatch Monday. 
The monument contains a rock wall surrounded by palm trees, symbolizing the decision of Cubans to defend their territory, it said. 
withdrawal 
In the summer of 1962, the Soviet Union began installing 42 medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. U.S. spy planes detected the missiles, and the United States began a naval blockade of Cuba. Tensions peaked when Cuba shot down a U-2 spy plane on Oct. 27; Khrushchev submitted to President Kennedy's demand the missiles be withdrawn. 
In newly released excerpts of his memoirs, Khrushchev called Castro a "hothead" who wanted the Soviet Union to at­tack the United States during the crisis. Castro denied that story. 
The document released Monday said the Soviet Union had sent a delegation to Havana in May 1962 to discuss installing the weapons as a means of discouraging the United States from 
Cuba accepted the plan in June after a meeting of the political leadership, including Castro, his brother Raul Cas­tro. Ernesto "Che" Guevara. Osvaldo Dorticos, Bias Roca and Emilio Aaragones, it said.

About 43,000 Soviet soldiers, officers and specialists were sent to Cuba in connection with the deployment, it said. 
The Soviet general in charge and his second-in-command had orders to use the missiles "only in case of aggression by the United States and only un­der orders from Moscow," the report said.

Hindu holy men clash with police 
AYODIIYA, India lAP) ­Hindu holy men clashed with police Monday and set a bus on lire in this curfew-bound city, the eye of a violent religious dispute between the country's Hindus and Moslems. 
It was the first report of vio­lence in Ayodhya in connection with the plan of fundamentalist Ilindus to start building a tem­ple over a 16th-century mosque on Tuesday. 
The dispute has killed at least 104 people nationwide in the past week and brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's govern­ment to the brink of collapse. 
One person was killed Mon­day in Lucknow, 75 miles west of Ayodhya, when Hindu crowds surged through a Moslem neighborhood throwing bricks, according to police offi­cials who spoke on condition on anonymity. 
One person committed suicide by swallowing poison Sunday night in Hoshiarpur in Punjab state to protest government ef­forts to halt the temple project, United News of India said. 
In Ayodhya, a town of about 40,000 people, a group of about 80 Hindu holy men threw stones at police and set a bus on fi ,, when authorities at­tempted to arrest a local Hindu priest, a police inspector said. 
The inspector, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was an isolated incident and did not cause any lasting ten­sion. 
But within an hour of the skirmish, authorities banned entry into Ayodhya and canceled passes issued to re­porters. An indefinite curfew is in force in the town, which has remained peaceful despite the raging controversy over the re­ligious site. 
At least 80,000 Hindus who were planning to participate in the construction program have been arrested and roadblocks set up on all routes leading to Ayodhya. 
Hindu fundamentalists, how­ever, claimed they had infil­trated thousands of supporters into areas near Ayodhya and would start the temple con­struction program as sched­uled. 
In a hand-written commu­nique, the World Hindu Council vowed to start building the temple despite the presence of 20,000 police and paramilitary troops in the town. 
Residents of Ayodhya said 5,000 Hindu activists were hid­ing in fields and villages around

the town and planned to con­verge on the disputed holy site Tuesday morning to start con­structing the temple. 
In New Delhi, the World Hindu Council claimed 10,000 supporters had slipped through police cordons and roadblocks around Ayodhya. 
Police in Ayodhya and the neighboring town of Faizabad said the claims were inflated. They said a maximum of 1,000 to 2,000 temple activists might have reachnd the arna. "We are in a position to control them," said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
A two-paragraph statement claiming to come from a top leader of the World Hindu Council was covertly distributed to reporters in Faizabad on Tuesday afternoon. It urged residents to defy a round-the­clock curfew and comn out of their houses Tuesday morning. 
"This curfew is murder of democracy. I appeal to all citi­zens of Faizabad and Ayodhya to come out in large numbers tomorrow (Tuesday) and march with me to Ayodhya," said the statement which carried the name of Ashok Singhal, general secretary of the World Hindu Council.

INDIANA'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
By PAIGE SMORON Assistant Accent Editor 
At Ion~ last... In the dubious tradition of Guinness' World Records, Hipley's "Believe It or Not," and even David Letterman's "Museum of the Hard to Believe," I· red D. Cavinder has published "Indiana's Believe It or Not," the latest in a genre that celebrates, among other oddities, really nice ears of corn. Finally, the appropriate Christmas gift for that Hoosier who seems to have everything. With its snappy red and yellow cover, this is definitely a coffee­table book, to be treasured and passed on for generations. 
I low many times have you been reading The National Enquirer and asked yourself, "Why is it that there are so many wondrous and sexually morbid storins being reported, sueh as hippos swallowin* eireus dwarfs, yet they all take place in obscure middle Eastern countries? Don't we have rejects of society and freaks of nature right here in Indiana? Well, no, but we have had some pretty wacky weather. Read on. 

John Hanson Craig of Danville was six feet, five inches tall and reached a top weight of 907 pounds. 
"Indiana's Believe It or Not" abounds with whimsical animal stories. In 1955, Indiana was abuzz with the accomplish­ments of Lady Wonder, a psy­chic horse in south-central Indiana. By counting and spelling out words, she pre­diclPd that Franklin D. lloosevelt would hH thn next prnsi<llmt of the Unit1~d States ­even befon~ he was nomi­nated(eollective gasp of disbe­lil~n. Fourtnen times in seven­teen years she predieted the winner of the World Series, and she was particularly gifted at picking the winners of horse races, as might be expected. 
Everyone will be pleased to note that Indiana does indeed boast of its own tremendously fat person. Actually, there have been several of significance, not the least of which was Baby Ruth of Kempton, who peaked at 815 pounds, yet had "no am­bition to follow the career of her mother, a circus fat lady." Unfortunately, her secretarial career did not work out, and she ended up at Ringling Brothers. Baby Ruth's life had its ups and downs: in the circus she met her future husband, a balloon salesman who took one look at her and dubbed her "my woman." Later, she had surgi­cal complications when her hospital bed eollapsed. 
'Everyone will be pleased to note that Indiana does indeed boast of its own tremendously fat person.' 
Then there is the strange and near-unbelievable story of Leonard B. Clore, who was so gifted at raising corn that he was banned from any further 

Unusual attractions abound in Indiana 
While everyone else is roadtripping to Tennessee, you might want to take advantage of all the photo opportunities that exist right here in Indiana. Here are just a few of the attractions you'll want to capitalize on in your tour of the glorious Midwest. 
(Editor's note: this itinerary may not be geographically feasible, as at the time of publkation, a map of Indiana was not handy.) 
Sapling buffs will want to start off their tour in Greensburg, which is in­ternationally known for the trees that grow on the roof of its courthouse. We are not making this up. Apparently it's one of those "you had to. be tlwre" things. The trees have inspirnd a name for an athletic tnam, as well as a poem: "On tlw roof of our tow11r, two trees I SePm to thrive in the dust ladBn brBeze, I But when the storm blows, I The Lord only knows, I How they cling with such nonchalant ease." 
From there you might want to get around to Cannelton, to 11xperience firsthand Halph Daum's pet bass. lie has apparently trained a fish to eat food out of his hands. In his own words, "You have to work with fish a little more than you would another creature, but they can be trained and they can become your friends." You'll return home with the memory of a new friend and maybe even a nice postcard. 
Next stop is Shelbyville, site of the largest corn shock ever constructed. An estimated 10,000 corn stalks were used to create the majestic shock, which "soared seventy feet tall" and was the centerpiece for the Shelby County Corn Festival in 1956. No, of course it's not still there, but Shelbyvillians still reminisce about the day Ronald Reagan visited and was photographed in front of the shock. I bet the picture's still there. 
A must-see is the "largest tree in the nation east of the Yosemite Valley," or at least a remnant of it, in Kokomo. And you thought the trees in Greensburg were good. More than 100 feet tall and with a stump 51 feet in circumference, it was once used to house a telephone booth. 
By this time, you might have decided to go down to Tennessee after all. Have a good time at the game. 

competition in the Nation Corn Association in 1909. One of his ears of Indiana corn, described only as "unusual," sold for $250 at an auction -and was bought by Clore himself, who decided it was too valuable to let go. 
Indiana has had its share of rough weather, as anyone who has had to hike to a class in Loftus, in a blizzard, in February, without earmuffs, can attest to. Cavinder, in an article dramatically entitled "The Year Without a Summer," writes of the tremendous cold of 1816, when it snowed in August. Hard to believe! 
One of the strengths of Cavinder's book is his unique way of turning a phrase. He gives many of his subjects illus­trious titles such as "the mean­est man in the world," and "the most useful man in Indiana" (which might very well lead one to wonder who the most useful man in the world is, and what he is doing now), etc. This book is not, however, for the faint­hearted, It'S the author is not excessively tactful, nor discrim­inating in his material. In an article called, "Ring Around the Commode," Cavinder concludes by saying, "After twenty-seven years of flushing the ring was back on Kemp's finger." Kind of makes you want to buy the

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) ­When the topic is defense, Michigan coach Gary Moeller believes the Wolverines have room for improvement. 
"I said that going into the season and a lot of people just kind of snickered, but the best defensive team is going to win the league. We're not to that point yet," Moeller said Monday. 
Despite flashes of their ex­pected form in last week's 45-19 thrashing of Indiana, Moeller knows the defense will need another strong ef­fort Saturday against Purdue and quarterback Eric Hunter. 
"Eric Hunter is one of ... the best athletes in the con­ference," Moeller said. "You saw it last year (in Michigan's 42-27 win over the Boilermakers). He goes against all principles of football as what you should do as a quarterback and he's successful at it. With 
him dodging around in their 
run-and-shoot offense, it's a 
different deal." 

Michigan (4-3, 2-2 Big 
Ten) registered seven quar­
terback sacks for minus-31 
yards against the Hoosiers, 
but will have a tougher time 
duplicating the feat with the 
agile Hunter, who leads the 
Big Ten in total offense. 
"The key is to contain him as best as possible and still have an aggressive pass rush," Moeller s-aid. "(Linebacker) Erick Anderson played his best game of the year last week and he has to keep improv­
-ing. The secondary has to keep improving and Mike Evans and a couple of those outside linebackers have to got play well." 
The Wolverines are in an unfamiliar position with four weeks left in their Big Ten schedule -out of the league title and Rose Bowl pictures.

Pittsburgh Steelers special teams overcame their own bungling and became some­thing special Monday night. 
Embarrassed a week ago at San Francisco when they al­lowed the 49ers to recover a kickoff at their own 5, and vic­timized Monday night by Gaston Green's 100-yard return of the opening kickoff. the Pittsburgh special teams made a 180-degree turn in helping the Steelers over the Los Angeles Rams 41-10. 
The offense and defense cer­tainly helped. Hubby Brister had four touchdown passes, two following interceptions. and Merril Hoge had three touchdowns and Pittsburgh's league~leading pass defense limited Jim Everett to 15 com­pletions in 34 attempts for 176 yards. But it was the special teams that set the tone.

Dolphins' defense keys strong start 
MIAMI (AP) -The last time the Miami Dolphins had a de­cent defense was the last time they made the playoffs. 
Now, five years later, they've given up the fewest yards in the NFL and -voila! ­they're again a first-place team. 
Miami allowed 356 yards per game a year ago. fifth-worst in the league, but the average is 230 this season. Indianapolis managed just 132 yards. the lowest net against the Dolphins since 1979, in Miami's 27-7 victory Sunday. 
"We've pretty much stayed with the same defensive philosophy," coach Don Shula said Monday. "It was just a question of guys making the push upfield and getting rid of the blocker and staying in their lanes and pursuing." 
With five new starters on de­fense this season, Miami has allowed a league-low 90 points. That's an average of 13 a game. compared with 23 a year ago.

stuff Rams punter Keith English. setting up a one-yard TD run by Hoge that opened up a 27-10 lead in the third quar­ter. 
The victory improved Pittsburgh's record to 4-4. The Rams are 2-5 and in serious jeopardy of missing the playoff spot that had been virtually conceded to them before the season. 
The Steelers' special teams were anything but special early, looking as bad on Green's 100-yard romp up the sideline as they did a week ago, when Barry Foster let a San Francisco kickoff drop un­touched, contributing to a 49ers' touchdown. 
Foster contributed Monday night with a 38-yard run that set up Pittsburgh's final score, a two-yard pass to Hoge from Brister, who completed 15 of 24 for 161 yards. 
The Steelers bounced back from Green's kickoff return to tie the score on a 75-yard, eight-play drive, capped by a pass. Brister was 6-for-6 for 61 yards on the drive. 
Late in the first period, David Johnson intercepted a pass by Everett and returned it 34 yards to the Rams' 17. On the next play. Brister hit Eric Green all alone in the end zone for the 275-pound rookie's sixth touchdown this season, a team record for a tight end. 
Mike Lansford's 32-yard field goal 45 seconds into the second period cut it to 14-10. 
But Woodson returned the kickoff 49 yards to the Rams' 39, setting up a 42-yarder by Anderson that made it 17-10 at hal...Lime. 
Woodson did it again on the second-half kickoff. which he brought back 45 yards to the Los Angeles 45. That set up an­other field goal, this one from 30 yards. 
Then came the key play in Pittsburgh's biggest win since the opening game of 1985 sea­son, a 45-3 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.

number of Pitt holding penalties, Zorich had forced a fumble and contributnd to five tackles (two for losses) when his right kneecap slipped out of and back into place, sidelining him for the rest of the game. The injury, which is similar to the one that kept Zorich out of spring practice his freshman year, will probably prnvent the senior nose taekle from playing in this week's game against Navy. 
While the Irish defense shone for most of the game, the Notre Dame offense was largely un­productive, due in part to some Panther defense antics. "They kept us off-balance," said Holtz of the Pitt defense. "They never had a rhyme nor reason for what they did. We couldn't get anything estab­lished." 
Irish quarterback Rick Mirer had his first less-than­spectacular game for Notre Dame, completing only 5 of 16 passes for 85 yards and one interception, his third of the season. Butter-lingered receivers, who dropped a number of catchable balls, contributed to the poor showing, as did the Irish offen­sive line, which after an im­pressive game against Miami, did not give Mirer adequate time to set up for the pass. Mirer was sacked three times for a loss of 16 yards. 
Ismail and tailback Tony Brooks accounted for most of the Irish offensive highlights. Brooks, who ran for 91 yards on the day. took advantage of Lyght's interception and Mc­Donald's fumble recovnry to score both of Notre Dame's first-half touchdowns. Ismail took over in the final two stanzas, running for 110 yards on 10 attempts while compiling 214 all-purposn yards. 
Both teams hurt thnmselves with a total of 18 ptmalties that accounted for 182 lost yards, including four 15-yard penalties for the Panthers. The first of those. a roughing-the­kicker call on Hentrich's only punt, dislocated the kicker's left thumb. Ilentrich continued his place­kicking duties but could not catch the long snaps on punts and was replaced by back-up Jim Sexton. The thumb has been fitted with a cast and may prevent him from punting next week.

ND ties for No. 2 in poll 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 
Virginia maintained its top ranking this week in the National Collegiate Sportswriters' Poll released Sunday, while Notre Dame climbed from fourth into a tie for second with Nebraska. The Cavaliers, idle this week, received 20 first-place votes and 474 total. Nebraska gained three first-place votes after whipping Iowa State 45­13, while the Irish, 31-22 win­ners over Pittsburgh, both racked up 431 points. Washington received the other first-place vote and placed sev­enth in the poll after thrashing California 46-7. Not much movement occurred in the rankings this week. Colorado, preparing for next week's Big Eight showdown with the Cornhuskers, defeated slumping Oklahoma 31-22 and made the biggest jump in the poll, from twelfth to ninth. Georgia Tech, which struggled on defense against Duke,

up 14 points and 171 yards to secure the victory. 
"I thought offensively we did not play well at all," Holtz said. "We never got into a rhythm, we couldn't get anything estab­lished. Rocket went in at tail­back and gave us a big break." 
Ismail's 76-yard scoring run, his. longest run from scrim­mage, was undoubtedly the pivotal play of the game. With just under eight minutes remaining in the contest, Pitt failed to convert on fourth-and­12 from the Irish 33. 
No sooner did the Panther of­fense leave the field than Ismail took quarterback Rick Mirer's handoff from the 24­yard line, followed guard Tim Ryan's and fullback Rod Culver's blocks up the middle and sprinted down the right sideline to give Notre Dame ari insurmountable 24-7 lead that cleared the Pitt student section. 
"It was a tremendous hole," Ismail said. "I saw it, ran to it, and just kept going. When I was playing tailback earlier in the game, they were doing a lot of different things. Late in the game, our line just took over." 
"We needed to stop them in the key situations," Pitt strong safety Louis Riddick said, "but when you play a guy like Ismail, he will break one or two big plays like he did." 
Pitt held Ismail to one recep­tion for eight yards in the first half, but he caught Mirer's first pass of the second half and raced 49 yards to the Panther 22 to set up Craig Hentrich's 39-yard field goal. 
"Overall, I think we played well as a defensive unit," Pitt outside linebacker Ricardo McDonald said. "Ismail had some big plays, but I was pleased with our performance overall." 
Ismail caught th.ree passes for 64 yards in the game, re­turned a kickoff for 24 yards and a punt for ten. He has amassed 705 total yards in Notre Dame's past three games, numbers which have put him back into the thick of the Heisman Trophy race. 
"There is no question that Raghib Ismail is the finest football player in the country," said Pittsburgh head coach Paul Hackett.

Cross country wins MCC race 
Men, after falling to William &Mary, are perfect in MCC

By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team had a roller­coaster break, taking its first loss of the season to William and Mary Oct. 20 and following the loss with a landslide victory at the MCC conference meet last Saturday. 
The Irish started the week with a 26-29 loss to William and Mary, despite capturing five of the top ten spots, includ­ing the top two. Senior Captain Mike O'Connor tied with team­mate Ryan Cahill to take top honors for the Irish, with a time of 24:46 for the five-mile course. Also placing in the top ten for the Irish were John Coyle (seventh), Pat Kearns (ninth), and Mike McWilliams (tenth). 
"We ran horrendously," saidNotre Dame head coach Joe Piane after the race. "We did not compete as a group. O'Connor and Cahill did a great job, but I can't say that anyone else ran very well.

The Notre Dame women's soccer team wrapped up its 1990 season in style this past week, winning the MCC Tournament and two other games to finish at 16-3-1. 
The Irish dumped Calvin College 2-0 on Oct. 20 behind unassisted second-half goals by freshmen Stephanie Porter and Andrea Kurek. 
Notre Dame's next victory was a 3-2 clitlbanger in overtime at Florida International on Oct. 24. The Irish, who had brought 20 players down to Florida, suf­fered the loss of several players. 
Standout sophomore goal­keeper Michelle Lodyga sprained her knee trying to save a goal with 10:00 remaining in the first half. Midfielders Margaret Jarc and Marta Roemer, who were replacing the already-injured Brenda Gorski, were also knocked out of the game in the first half. 
Typically, sophomore Cara Lewis would step in for Lodyga. However, since Notre Dame was only playing one game, normal procedures did not dictate the necessity of carrying two goalkeepers on such a trip. 
Enter Molly Lennon. 
Lennon had never played goalkeeper before. In addition to her paucity of goaltending experience, Lennon, who has played most of her games in the midfield, had been saddled with injuries this season. 
In 79:00 of goaltending that could air on rebirths of "That's Incredible" or "Ripley's Believe It or Not," Lennon made seven saves and allowed only one goal, as the Irish held on for a

tremendous road win. 
"We tried to play with four fullbacks and four midfielders after Margaret and Marta went down," said Irish head coach Chris Petrucelli. "Molly went in to play goal, and the rest of the game we just refused to lose. We fought, we played hard and we scrapped the whole way. 
"Really, you have to figure that a player that has never played goalie will make more than one-mistake, but Molly re­ally only had one. She was very, very good back there. Everyone rallied around her playing." 
Alison Lester accounted for two goals and one assist, while Susie Zilvitis nabbed the game­winning goal in overtime. Mimi Suba assisted on the first of Lester's goals. 
"Without lots of our players and with the injuries, everyone picked up their level of play," noted Petrucelli. "I didn't expect the game to be close, but after the injuries I thought that we would be lucky to come out with a tie." 
The Irish returned home in time to host and win the Midwest Collegiate Conference (MCC) Tournament over October 27 and 28. 
In the first day of action, Xavier clubbed Marquette 3-0, while Notre Dame ran their winning streak to six games, trouncing Dayton 1-0. 
Early in the Dayton game, Marianne Giolitto, who did not start, was waiting at the scorer's table to substitute for Denise Chabot. Yet as Giolitto waited to enter the game, Chabot scored the only goal of the day for the Irish, as Notre Dame jumped out to a 1-0 lead that they would never relin­quish. 
On the second day of the tournament, Dayton thumped Marquette 4-0, while the Irish ended their season with a seven-game winning streak, soundly hammering Xavier 4-0. 

Xavier, who had been ranked 21st in the nation in Division I, in addition to being the fourth­ranked team in the central re­gion, proved unable to shut down the potent Irish squad. 
"We won a game against a quality opponent," said Petrucelli. ''They had a forward who was probably the best player we have faced all year, but Andrea Kurek shut her down. We have always put Andrea on the opponent's best player all year long and she did a great job as usual. 
"We took advantage of our opportunities. It was a great day for the team and for indi­vidual players. We won the con­ference tournament, finished the season with 16 wins and beat a Top 20 team-those are three great accomplishments for this team." 
Susie Zilvitis had a hat trick against Xavier, while Alison Lester added her 15th goal of the season. Marianne Giolitto, Stephanie Porter and Denise Chabot each added one assist. Lester's goal set a new record for most goals in a season by an individual player. Susie Zilvitis set the old record of 14 in 1988. 
Mimi Suba, playing in the last game of her Notre Dame career, also turned in a splendid performance. 
"In the last couple of games and the last couple of weeks, Mimi has been outstanding," observed Petrucelli. "She has picked up her level of play and played like a senior who is end­ing her season and her career." 
Closing out the season at 16­3-1 with a seven-game victory streak and winning of the MCC Tournament, observers have noted that Notre Dame has in­deed garnered a great deal of regional recognition and taken a giant step toward national prominence.

Defense vs. Miami-a setup or rising to occasion? 


... 
It was all a setup. 
The Stanford loss. The last-minute victories over Michigan and Michigan State. The defense that yielded 27 points to an otherwise impotent Air Force offense. 
At least that's what Notre Dame inside linebacker Michael Stonebreaker would have us believe following the improbable 29-20 Irish victory over second-ranked Miami on Oct. 20. 
"We were just setting up Miami the first couple of games," Stonebreaker joked, "so we knew when we played Miami we were gonna tighten up and play hard." 
In what Head Coach Lou Holtz called "a team effort, a players' win", the Irish defense did more than its part in keeping Notre Dame's national championship hopes alive. 
Just two weeks after surrendering 36 points in the loss to Stanford, the Irish defense held the Miami offense, ranked sixth nationally in scoring (37 .2 points per game), to 20 points, including just three in the second half. 
"You've got to give them credit," Miami head coach Dennis Erickson said. "They played defense a lot better than they had earlier in the year, but I knew that coming in. I knew they were going to play out­standing defense, and they did." 
"That is a great offensive football team we played," Holtz said, "and to hold them to three points in the second half is rather incredible. I don't think anybody thought that we would play so well on defense. I thought we would play very well on defense." 
Holtz knew what nobody else did because he spent the two weeks before the Miami game overseeing the Irish defense and preparing it for its biggest test of the season. He did not throw out the defensive

scheme crafted by defensive coordinator Gary Darnell. Instead, he worked with Darnell during the week and focused on turning up the intensity at practice. 
"We worked very hard the last two weeks," Holtz said, "and the players responded. I thought we made a lot more progress than people envisioned, and our pass defense wasn't far away from being very good than what people would be led to believe." 
"With Coach Holtz coming to practice (on the defensive side of the field), it definitely helped us get motivated more," said outside linebacker Scott Kowalkowski, who forced a third-quarter fumble by Hurricane fullback Steve McGuire at the Miami 25. "We had a pretty much business-as-usual week, and we got our tackling down better. We didn't have many missed mental assignments, and it really paid off." 
More importantly, Notre Dame's defense forced four Miami turnovers and made impressive goal-line stands in the first and fourth quarters to halt the HurriCanes' potent scoring attack. 
Field cornerback Todd Lyght made perhaps the biggest defensive play of the game when he intercepted Erickson's pass for Lamar Thomas at the Irish eight-yard line with ten minutes remaining in the game and Notre Dame clinging to a 22-20 lead. 
Nose tackle Chris Zorich and outside linebacker Andre Jones chased Erickson out of the pocket, and he forced a throw downfield where Thomas had slipped at the 15. 
"Our front three got good pressure on Erickson," Lyght said, "and he was looking for the open zone. We put in coverage that they hadn't seen before and that kept them off balance." 
"We score there and kick a field goal, we're right back on top again," Dennis Erickson said. "Instead, we throw an interception and they take the ball down and score. That's obviously the turning point in the game." 
It also was something Holtz planned for in preparing his pass defense for Miami's aerial attack. Erickson completed 20 of 36 attempts for 355 yards in the game, but his two interceptions proved costly. 
"We took Todd Lyght and moved him on the inside guy and played a lot of man-to-man on Todd," Holtz said. "We put a lot of pressure on Todd, and we put a lot of pressure on (short cornerback) Greg Lane. I thought they responded very well." 
Lyght led all Irish defenders with eight total tackles, including six unassisted. Backfield mates Greg Davis and Reggie Brooks added five apiece. 
Davis shut down Miami's final scoring chance when he knocked the ball loose from running back Leonard Conley at the Irish five and Stonebreaker pounced on the loose ball at the two. 
The Irish defense proved especially stingy once the Hurricanes moved inside the Notre Dame 10-yard line. 
An early-fourtb quarter, 72-yard Miami drive stalled when Erickson misfired three consecutive times from the Irish eight. Carlos Huerta converted a 25-yard field goal to pull the Hurricanes to within 22-20. 
The Notre Dame defense limited running backs McGuire and Conley to 91 yards in the game, or 253 less than they gained two weeks earlier against Florida State. 
We played the run very well up front," said Holtz. ··our secondary played well, but we felt we had to stop the run with the six-man front. We have played well up front. That's what I said all along. We just have to take this to another level."

ND, in 'classic,' defeats Miami 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 
It was the fmal battle in the long war between Notre Dame and Miami. The teams fought this battle on the field, and it turned out to be a classic. 
The Irish edged the Hurricanes 29-20 before the usual crowd of 59,075 in Notre Dame Stadium to mark the con­clusion of college football's most heated rivalry of the last decade. 
The Irish improved to 5-1 and moved a step closer to playing for the national championship on New Year's Day, while the Hurricanes fell to 4-2 and saw their hopes for a second straight title evapo­rate. 
"It's not who can win the title but who's left," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "It's like getting up in the morning and reading the obituary column. You're happy if you're not in it. This is a great game, a great series. It's why you come to Notre Dame, why you come to Miami, to play this type of game." 
Notre Dame still holds the edge over Miami since the two first met in 1955, but the teams developed a rivalry through the 1980s that will be hard to match. The winner of the Notre Dame­Miami game has won the national championship for the past three sea­sons. 
A scheduling decision made years ago-long before this became such a heated rivalry-resulted in the termina­tion of the series in 1990. 
"We'd like to keep playing them," Erickson said. "As I've said before, you've got two great programs involved and it's a shame it's over." 
Junior Heisman Trophy candidate Raghib Ismail led Notre Dame's offen­sive attack, and the Irish defense stopped Miami when it counted in the second half. 
Ismail, who left the game briefly in the 
second quarter with what was later 
diagnosed as a low blood sugar count, 
ran for 100 yards on 13 carries, caught 
one pass for 24 yards and returned a 
kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. He 
finished with 268 all-purpose yards. 
"He's the best football player in the 
country," Holtz said. 
Notre Dame rallied from a 17-16 
halftime deficit and controlled the sec­
ond half, holding Miami to just three 
points. The Hurricanes had the ball for 
just over eight minutes and had three 
turnovers in the second half. 
"You just can't make the mistakes we 
made in the second half and expect to 
win," Erickson said. "Notre Dame con­
trolled the ball in the third quarter and 
it really paid off for them." 
Said Miami quarterback Craig 
Erickson, "They came out in the second 
half and played good, consistent football. 
We didn't. We made mistakes."

Irish not pretty in win over Pitt 
By CHRIS COONEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
It wasn't pretty by any stretch of the 
imagination, but Notre Dame still 
earned its sixth victory of the season on 
Saturday, beating Pittsburgh 31-22 and 
moving to No. 2 in the Associated Press 
poll as Auburn dropped two places to 
No. 4 after barely edging Mississippi 
State 17-16. 
While the Irish win was never really 
in doubt on the scoreboard, with Notre Dame taking an early lead and never looking back, two Panther touchdowns in the last five and a half minutes, combined with a number of Irish mis­cues, made for some messy football. The game was marred with penalties, an out-of-rhythm Irish offense and a stellar day for Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt, who threw for 384 yards on a career high 37 completions. 
The Panthers, typically a tough team for the Irish to beat (they've won three of the last five), deserve much of the credit. As Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz pointed out after the game, Pittsburgh exposed the Irish defensive weaknesses while confusing the Notre Dame offense with unpredictable cover­age. 
"Pitt played awfully well against us," said Holtz. "The (Notre Dame} defense carried the team for 50 minutes. I would have been perfectly happy if the game had ended 17-7." 
Holtz can blame Rocket Ismail for changing that score, which lasted for most of the second half after a Craig Hentrich field goal midway through the third quarter. With less than eight min­utes left in the fourth quarter, Ismail followed a Rod Culver block and ex­ploded through the right side of the Panther offensive line, scampering 76 yards into the endzone for the most ex­citing play of the day. 
The touchdown, which was the longest run of Ismail's career, created a 24-7 cushion that Van Pelt and the Panthers spent the next seven minutes trying desperately to deflate. Sparked by Van Pelt's 14 straight completions, Pitt marched 80 and 73 yards and scored on both of its last two posses­sions, only to have Notre Dame inter­rupt the showing with an impressive 4 7 -yard drive and touchdown of its own that prevented the game from being any closer. 
Nine Panther receivers combined to 
catch Van Pelt's bullets, with five of 
them tallying 45 or more yards. But the 
opportunistic Irish defense held Pitt to 
just 84 yards rushing and made the big 
plays when it needed it. Those big plays 
included a Todd Lyght interception in 
the endzone, a fumble forced by Chris 
Zorich and recovered by Devon 
McDonald, and another interception by 
Donn Grimm deep in Notre Dame terri­

We are living in an age where publication, unfor­tunately, connotes authority.

All too often, we are willing to accept this view as the final word on the subject. 
The media may not have created the "Hate Miami" hype which has pervaded this campus every fall since Jimmy Johnson unmercifully ran up the score in the Hurricanes' 58-7 romp over Gerry Faust's obviously overmatched '85 Irish squad, but we have played a central role in fostering its growth. 
Five years after that game, Johnson is coaching the Dallas Cowboys, Faust is coaching at Akron, and the players from both teams have moved on. Yet the hype remains. Why? Ask the media. Ask Smizik.
