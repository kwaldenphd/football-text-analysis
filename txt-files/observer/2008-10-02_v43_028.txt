Seniors consider post-grad service at fair 
International, domestic sites pitch options including teaching, homelessness advocacy 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY-News Writer 
Almost 80 service organiza­tions came to Notre Dame Wednesday to educate students about postgraduate service opportunities for the University's annual service fair. 
The organizations represented at the fair serve domestic and international sites and programs that involve teaching, health care, prison ministry, homeless­ness advocacy and much more, the Center for Social Concerns' Student Leadership and Senior Transitions director Mike Hebbeler said. 
"It's great for the students who have all these diverse interests," Hebbeler said. "They are bound to fmd something that they are interested in as an issue." 
Hebbelcr said he started con­tacting the organizations in August to invite them to partici­pate in the fair. He e-mailed list­serves for different organizations and found other groups through networking Web sites. Many organizations were easy to con­tact because they have come in past years, he said. 
Hebbeler said he expected about 300 students to attend the fair. 
"I hope students will first and foremost come to the fair, but

The bus's trek across the country will end at Northwestern University on Friday. 
Schneider said that "tons" of students stopped by to check out the 1978 ceo­friendly bus, and learn about the additional features that Google Apps offers. In addi­tion to the Gmail service, stu­dents also have access to other applications such as Calendar, Docs, Talk and Sites. 
At the bus, which parked near Notre Dame Stadium's northwest corner, students could explore the applications on computers.

With the switch to Google Apps service for student e­mail accounts earlier this semester, students have been able to do more than just send and receive e-mails-and the Google bus made a special trip to campus Wednesday as part of its "App to School" road trip to help students learn about these new fea­tures. 
"The Google bus has been on its way around the country, visiting 10 schools since Sept. 8, starting out in Mountain View, Calif.," said Mirriam Schneider, associate market­ing manager for Google Apps.

The St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office offered the 37 people arrested Sept. 21 at a party on the 700-block of E. Colfax Ave. the chance to participate in a voluntary diversion program, according to apress release. 
If the individuals in question choose to participate in the diversion program, they will pay user fees and "may be required to perform community service, participate in an alcohol use evaluation and follow through with any educational program determined to be appropriate after the evaluation," the release said. 
This action is consistent with the han­dling of' most first-time offenders who have been arrested for similar offenses, 
the release said. 
If they choose not to participate in the program, or fail to respond to the letter sent by the Office, the reports will be referred for formal charging, according to the release. 
Three of the 37 arrested Sept. 21 have prior records, and these individuals will "be dealt with more harshly, on a case­by-case basis," the release said. 
One of the three, Irish tight end Will Yeatman was on a "Deferred Sentencing" program for a January arrest for driving while intoxicated. He entered a guilty plea to the charges of Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated, a Class C misdemeanor and Reckless Driving, a Class 8 misdemeanor, on Feb. 25. 
His sentence was deferred for one year, allowing Yeatman the opportunity 

to earn the dismissal of the charge of "Operating While Intoxicated," the release said. 
A term of this agreement stated that Yeatman "shall not commit any criminal · offenses during the term of this agree­ment," the release said. 
Because Yeatman failed to comply with this term of the agreement, according to the release, he will be sentenced on the charge of Operating While Intoxicated, and both the State and the Defendant will "be free to make arguments to the Court regarding the appropriate sen­tence." The Court will set a date for the sentencing hearing. 
Yeatman and the two others with prior records have been offered the opportuni­ty to enter the voluntary diversion pro-

INSIDE COLUMN 
Playing the stock :m_arket 
I know as much about th1~ stock mar­

kd as I do about physks or women's 
shoes. 
I watch "Trading Places" and laugh 

at the appropriate times but have no 
idea what's really happening. But I 
know enough that when the bailout 
plan f'loppnd in the !louse of 
Hnprnsm1tatives Monday, I knew the 
bottom would fall out of the market. It 
did. 
My roommate made a joke when we 

were talking about it. 
"We should buy stock," he said. A 

funny idea at first, but when we 
thought about it, it sounded logical. The 
stock market lost more points than it 
ever had. It had nowhere to go but up. 
I looked up which stock lost Bill Brink the most percent­age-wise, and 
Sports Editor 

found a perfect fit -Wachovia. They sold $1.2 billion worth of a..<;sets and dropped from eight dollars to under two. Tuesday morning, I snatched up 25 shares. A nice social experiment, I thought. I don't know what Wachovia does. I know they have free Coinstar machines in their banks back home. So why not? 
Maybe I'll learn something about finances. I feel like I need to. On a meent visit to my girlfriend's college, I sat through her 75-minute finance dass with her and felt hopelessly lost. I'm terrified of the day I become an adult for real and have to worry about mort­gages and ront and bills. I can bamly balanee my checkbook. 
Important side note to any fledgling investors like myself: buying stock is not free. My bank eharged me a $12 eornmission fee. Who knew? 
I checked the stock at the end of the trading day Thursday and I'd made $:t30 after the eommission. Seems like I'm pretty successful at this gig; I really have the eye of a broker. I could see myself hemming the Michael Douglas character in "Wall Strnet," a slick-talk­ing, well-dressed scumbag robbing hardworking Americans of their money just to pad the top of my collers a little more. 
With my newfound prowess at pre­dicting the market, maybe I can finally afl'ord a new set of speakers, because my surround sound system conked out on me recently. Maybe I can upgrade from Keystone and Natty to Four Horsemen at parties. Maybe I really can have the Lamborghini Diablo I've always drnamnd of, although it would bn a pain to work with in the snow. 
Then again, maybe my miniscule gain was a fluke. It could all be gone by tomorrow. If one company buys anoth­er, dons the sneond company's stoek stay thnrn? Or does it disappear? I don't know. I don't evnn know if I rnally have stock. My bank's Web site eould bn lying to mo. 
Hngardless, I feel like I helped my country. Thn American economy is fail­ing, and it's thn American thing to do to throw some dollars in the right direc­tion. 
Ilopefully when the economy rights itself. it will remember my gracious eontribution and throw a job my way in the futun~. That surround sound system may still be in the eards.

Panel to discuss gender violence 
By MANDl STIRONE 
Assisstant News Editor 
Domestic· violence is something that may affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity or social back­ground, Saint Mary's Spanish pro­fessor Luzmila Camacho-Platero said. 
Saint Mary's two-day Symposium on Gender Violence began Wednesday with a movie screening and continues tonight with a panel discussion on gender violence. 
"I think it's important to talk about women's issues and women's politics," Camacho­Platero said. 
The Vander Vennet Theater was mostly full for the showing of "Take My Eyes," which tells the story of a woman in an abusive marriage. 
"We thought that students need to be very aware of these issues," Camacho-Platero said. "This is not something that happens only to strangers." 
Saint Mary's senior Becca Mason, who attended the screen­ing, said she thought the film did a good job of making domestic vio­lence not such a "back and white" occurrence. It "portrayed both people [the abused wife and the abusing husband] as real people," she said. 
A GeQder Violence panel will take place tonight from 5 to 7 p.m. at Vander Vennet Theater. The panel will include Edith Miguda, Yana Hashamova, Bettina Spencer and linda S. Baechle. 
The program was organized to be "as interdisciplinary as possi­ble," Camacho-Platero said. 
Miguda and Spencer are profes­sors at Saint Mary's. Miguda, an assistant professor of history, will give a talk entitled "Women and Vilene in Electoral Politics in Africa." Spencer, an assistant pro­fessor of psychology, will discuss domestic abuse in her talk entitled "Rethinking Gendered Violence: Domestic Abuse and Family Systems." 
Hashamova is \ill associate pro­fessor of Slavic aAd East European Language and Literature at Ohio State University. She will discuss events in Eastern Europe in her talk, "Trafficking in Women: Reality and Repression." 
Baechle is the Executive Director of the YWCA of St. Joseph County, she will also cover domes­tic violence in her talk "Justice for Domestic Violence Victims in United States." 
The two-day symposium is sponsored by the Board of Governance (BOG), the Student Diversity Board, the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership, Multicultural Services and Student Programs, the Modern Languages Department, Women's Studies, Justice Education, Intercultural 
· Studies, the Office of Civic and Social Engagement, the Spanish Club and the Women's Resource Center.

STUDENT SENATE 

Group considers cab regulation 
By JOSEPH McMAHON 
Assisstam News Editor 
Student Senate discussed how the University should regulate cab service on campus at their meeting Wednesday, building on a meeting student body presi­dent Bob Reish, vice president Grant Schmidt and Senate Community Relations commit­tee chair Gus Gari had with Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP). 
"We communicated what we think the major issues with cabs are [at the meeting]," Gari said. "We saw that there have been many students complaining that on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday taxi drivers are overcharging and some of the taxi drivers are being rude." 
Gari said while there is little student government can do to change the practices of South Bend cab drivers, they can ban certain cab companies from coming to campus. 
"We can't regulate customer service aspects, but we can reg­ulate what cabs can come on campus," Gari said. 
Gari said they discussed the idea of a universal flat rate for all students as well as placing cab stands somewhere near North and South Quads as pos­sible ways to regulate the taxis. 
"Only companies that entered into negotiations with the University could come on cam­pus," he proposed. 
Many senators agreed that a flat rate would be a welcome remedy to haggling with diffi-cult cab drivers. 


"I like the idea of a flat rate," Alumni senator Zach Reuvers said. "I've had a lot of problems negotiating cab prices depend­ing on where you're going." 
Cavanaugh senator Robin Link said one of the best ways to advertise approved cab com­panies would be to post fliers listing those companies' num­bers in the dorm entrances. 
Senate Academic Affairs committee chair Ryan Brellenthin agreed the best companies should be adver­tised, and suggested an online rating system for different driv­ers and companies "so it's not so much regulated by the administration but more by [the students]." 
In other Senate news: 
+ Schmidt. announced that 
student government's mock election, scheduled for Oct. 7, will be conducted via voting booths stationed outside of DeBartolo Hall, LaFortune · Student Center and North and South Dining Halls, as opposed to with an online ballot. Students can go to one of these stations to cast their vote. 
+ The Student Senate unani­mously approved a new amendment which places all executive titles underneath the same heading. Previously, the job descriptions for student body president and vice presi­dent were under their own heading, but now descriptions of all 7 executive positions will be organized underneath Article II of the constitution.

Forum examines 
price for going green 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
People's physieal environment, health and standard of living are all hurt by dimate change and the laek or sustainable energy sources, GreeND vice president CollePn Kelly said Wednesday at "The Pri1:e of (;oing Green for the Poor," a rorum sponsored by Multicultural StudPnt Programs and Serviens (MSPSl. 
"The U.S. has only live pnrcent of thn world's population. but we mnit 25 Jwn·ent of all pollution," Knlly said. "A lot of peopln are advnrsnly afTncted who are not eontributing to tlw problem." 
Thn MSPS dinrwr and rorum f'oeused on how difTerent levels of initiativn -individual, busi­nnss. and national -can work to aehinve a more sustainable environnwnt. 
The forum diseussed the ways that individuals can decrease their ennrgy use and work toward a sustainable environ­ment. Driving less, being con­scious of food consumption and using enPr),ry-efficient light bulbs were methods mentioned. 
Notre Dame students, Kelly said. waste an average of five ounces of food every dining hall meal. 
Kelly started the discussion by asking the question: "What can we do for Notrn Damn and what can we do as citizens?" 
It is a "global commons prob­lmn," Kelly said, bncausn when we pollutn, we do not necessari­ly bmtr thn eosts of our actions. But if wn do not change our bnhavior, in the long-t11rm, she said. the worldwide erfects will bn dnvastating. 
Thn economic incentive to save enPrgy eosts is changing 
how businesses operate,. Kelly said. 
"Businesses are actually mak­ing money by going green," she said. 
But the incentive is not yet there for many businesses, so Kelly suggested that legislation might be a necessary part or the solution. 
A "cap and trade" program would issue pollution permits that allotted a set amount of car­bon emissions to each business, Kelly said. Businesses would then buy and sell these permits, according to the amount of pol­lution they intended to release. 
Kelly described the program as "harnessing the market to solve something complicated." 
The forum discussed other ways that environmental and energy problems can be solved on the national level. Changes to infrastructure and city planning, according to several partici­pants, will be central to adapt­ing the United States to an econ­omy based on sustainable ener­gy. 
Freshman Mark Easley point­ed out that by building more public transit systems, the United States could rely Jess on cars. 
"America needs to move to trains," he said. "There's the example of Europe and Japan switching to the more efficient trains." 
Other participants made the ease that towns and cities in the United States should be planned around the goal of making transportation easy and effi­eient, commenting that people should be able to walk to work or the supermarket.

Students present energy research 
SURGE projects examine energy efficiency, solar power sustainable design 
By EMMA DRISCOLL News Writer 
Undergraduate students pre­sented their green energy research projects at the Symposium of Undergraduate Research in Green Energy (SURGE) Wednesday night in the Hesburgh Center. 
Thirteen students presented on topics such as energy effi­ciency, solar power sustainable design and other green energy topics. 
"Back in late summer we sent out a call for projects," GreeNO member Alice Griesemer said. "It went a cou­ple times to all the student list­servs, and we also targeted specific people in majors that we knew were doing projects just from word of mouth .... We had kind of an application process but we didn't turn any­one away either." 
Students had already been working on t h e s e 
research projects, and SURGE gave them the oppor­tunity to share their research. 
"All of this [research] was already going on .... We were just going to see the response 
we were going to get," Griesemer said. "We weren't sure we were going to have the event. There was such a large rBsponse, so we could have it and that was great." 

Griesemer said that over half' of the student presenters worked with Notre Dame pro­fessors on their research proj­ects. 
Dr. Edward Maginn of the Department of Chemical and 
"That's where your researeh comes in." 
Maginn discussed President Hichard Nixon's promise to end the United States' dependenee on foreign sources of energy by 1980.

In his later speech, Carter said "the energy crisis is real. ... These are facts and we simply must face them" and announced import quotas for foreign oil. 
"It was shocking to watch this video .... The frustration is very apparent on President Carter's face," Maginn said. 
ThB idea for SUHGE started with a committee of students that met last May to find ways to further integrate the ideas discussed in the Notre Dame Forum into students' lives.

Tainted milk causes lawsuit 
BEIJING -The parents of a 1-year-old boy who developed kidney stones after drinking infant formula tainted with an industrial chemical are suing the dairy at the heart of the scandal, state media reported, as tests implicated 15 more companies Wednesday. 
The case is believed to be the first civil lawsuit filed in response to the contamina­tion of milk, yogurt and other dairy products with melamine, which causes kidney stones and can lead to kidney failure. Nearly 54,000 children have been sickened and four infants have died. 
According to the lawsuit, the boy was fed baby formula made by Sanlu Group Co. from the time of his birth, said the report by Caijing, a leading Chinese business maga­zine. 
The child's parents, who come from cen­tral China's Henan province, filed a lawsuit in a court in Zhenping county seeking $22,000 in compensation from Sanlu for medical, travel and other expenses incurred after the child developed kidney stones, the magazine said.

Associated Press  
WASHINGTON  - Barack  
Obama has surged to a seven­ 
point lead over John McCain  
one month before the presiden­ 
tial election, lifted by voters  
who think the Democrat is bet­ 
ter suited to lead the nation  
through its sudden financial  
cns1s,  according  to  an  
Associated Press--GfK poll that  
underscores the mounting con­ 
cerns of some McCain backers.  
Likely  voters  now  back  
Obama 48-41 "percent over  
McCain, a dramatic shift from  
an AP-GfK survey that gave  
the Republican a slight edge  
nearly three weeks ago, before  
Wall Street collapsed and sent  
ripples across worldwide mar­ 
kets. On top of that, unrelated  
surveys show Obama beating  
McCain  in  several  battle­ 
grounds,  including  Ohio,  
Florida and Pennsylvania - 
three states critical in the state­ 
by-state fight for the presiden­ 
cy.

are starting to slip away.  -

IN BRIEF 
Financial crisis hurts retirees 
DES MOINES, Iowa-So close and yet so far. It's a frustration being felt by Americans who thought the linish line to their working life was almost in sight. 
The financial crisis that toppled major Wall Street banks and snarled credit markets around the world has also taken a toll on nest eggs, forcing people to rethink when -and even if-their savings will allow them to retire. 
More than half of people surveyed in an Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday said they worry that they will have to work longer because the value of their retirement savings has declined. 
Denise Edwards, 62, now expects to work 
. for at least another decade selling condomini­ums because of the damage to her and her husband John's retirement savings. "We just have to work for as long as possi­ble. And we're going to have to count on our (two) daughters," said Edwards, who lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington. In the fast four years, Edward's IRA has hov­ered at about the same level, and the couple's other savings of less than $1 million have taken a double-digit hit this fall. They also still owe $425,000 on a house with a market value of $650,000. 
Lobbiests worked for bailout votes 
WASHINGTON -Lobbyists for restaurants, the solar power industry and other businesses hunted votes Wednesday for the $700 billion financial industry bailout package, touting new provisions that leaders added in hopes of finally pushing the bill through Congress. 
Working off a color-coded spread sheet listing House members whose "no" votes sank the bill in that chamber on Monday, business groups con­tacted dozens of lawmakers -at home and in Washington -to seek their support. By late-after­noon. that list showed five legislators who'd voted "no" now leaning toward supporting an over­hauled version of the bill the House rejected by 23 votes. 
The all-out lobbying came as the Senate pre­parnd for a Wednesday evening vote in which the revamped legislation was expected to be approved.

Burglars 
continued from page 1 
cent. since January, but the burglars are hitting a wide variety of targets and not f<H:using solely on students. lie said SBPD would be increasing its patrols. 
"We're up in burglaries, but it's nothing one could say that this all happened when the Notre Dame people came back," Trent said. "There's been no (special! increase in break-ins at student houses." 
St. Joseph's County Police Sgt. William Hedman agreed with Trent, adding that all of St. Joseph's County has seen an increase in break-ins and bur­glaries recently. 
"The last month or two, bur­glaries in St. Joseph County seem to be on the rise as well," Hedman said. "This is wide­spread throughout the entire county, and I know there have been some areas near the University that have been bro­ken into also." 
Students have been feeling the collateral effects of the increase in crime, with bur­glars targeting not only their homes, but their cars as well. Seniors Mark Langhans and Daniel Castellanos; who live on the 200-block of N. St. Louis Blvd., said they have been the victims of nine separate inci­dents, eight involving items stolen from their cars and one involving a burglar breaking in through the first floor window to steal a laptop. 
"Most of the times (the bur­glars were) just someone breaking into a car, usually just by opening the door -my 
roommates leave their cars 
unlocked and empty so that 
their windows don't get bro­
ken., which happened at the 
beginning of the year -and 
rummaging around for some­
thing," Castellanos said. 
Langhans said he and his roommates have had a variety of items stolen from them, ranging from a laptop comput­er to an empty backpack to $1.75 in change. 
"There's no peace of mind," he said "You're worried about stuff being stolen all the time, and I feel like you really shouldn't have to worry about that." 
Langhans had his laptop stolen sometime last Saturday between the hours of 4 a.m. and 8 p.m. -the first time someone had actually broken­into his house. 
"The scary part of it was, in order to see the laptop, they had to have been up against the window," he said. "It's obvious that they're coming up and pecking in our house while we're sleeping." 
Langhans lives in a house located across the street from the 700-block of E. Colfax Ave, where 20 hours after the bur­glary took place, police arrest­ed 37 for alcohol-related charges. 
"(The burglary) happened 20 or so hours before the party was broken up," Trent said. 
Langhans said he was disap­pointed that the rate of resi­dential burglaries has risen, but to him, it seems as though police are more focused on preventing underage drinking. 
"You know that they're tar­geting students, and you wish that they would step up patrols," he said. "The thing 
that makes you really·mad is 
when you see (the headline] of 
37 arrests for underage drink­
ing because they were able to 
mobilize all these elite police 
forces, while, at the same time, 
our house can be broken into." 
Mark Kramer of Kramer 
Properties, who owns the N. St 
Louis Blvd. property in addi­
tion to about 200 other housing 
units throughout South Bend, 
said he also thinks the police 
needed to readjust their priori­
ties. 
"I think the police need to concentrate their efforts more so on the real crimes in the comml.lnity and the crimes towards the students and a lit­tle less about parties inside homes," he said. 
Kramer said he has had one other break-in at a home this year, but has heard dozens of complaints from students about cars being broken-into. After the first home break-in earlier this semester, Kramer doubled his security force which checks ·on each of his properties nightly. 
"We've had two house break­ins, which is two too many. But if you look at the ratio between two houses being broken into and 200 total units, it's pretty low," Kramer said. "When we had [the first break-in], I dou­bled my patrols." 
Senior Catie Peters, who declined to give her address but said she lives "near Club 23," said her home was entered in broad daylight sev­eral weeks ago and her laptop and some of her roommate's jewelry were taken: But Peters said after she attended a safety talk at LaFortune for off-cam­pus students given by ·Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) 

and SBPD, she understood that 
the police officers care much 
more about student safety than 
underage drinking. 
"It was a: very good event to have because it [became] very obvious that the police officers did not care that much about busting parties," she said. "It just doesn't make sense that police officers would care about student getting busted for underage drinking above their safety.... It kind of frus­trates me that students are not seeing this from a holistic point of view." 
Peters said she blamed stu­dents' prejudice against the local police force on the University's failure to embrace the South Bend community. 
"I think a lot of the problem comes from Notre Dame's fail­ure to integrate into the com­munity," she said. "Notre Dame is not a bubble, as much as it tries to pretend that it is." 
Student Senate Community Relations committee chair Gus Gari said students must be aware that, when they enter the South Bend community, they need to be vigilant. 
"Like ISouth Bend Police Chief Darryl Boykins] told us, it's really easy money for (bur­glars] if students aren't smart enough to practice crime pre­vention," he said. 
Senior Michael Benz, who lives on the 900-block of South Bend Ave., said a laptop was recently stolen from his house due to his and his roommates' failure to practice crime pre­vention. 
"Our burglary happened right under our noses," Benz said. "We let two people oft' the street play beer pong with us for a minute. They left and broke through the air condi­tioner in my housemate's first floor roo.m and stole his com­puter and bolted." 
Unfortunately, Trent said many students do not realize the importance of crime pre­vention until after they have been burglarized. For example, Trent said few students attend­ed a recent safety seminar organized by SBPD and NDSP. 
"There are students who are affected and they are very upset, but whf:Jn we call these public me!!tings [with University officials! there has been a very dismal showing from the student population," he said. 
After such a negative experi­ence, Kramer said students often leave South Bend after graduation from Notre Dame, resulting in a "brain drain." 
"The talk about 'brain drain' in the South Bend community and they would like to see stu­dents stick around," Kramer said. "Well, what motivation do you have after you've been treated the way you've been treated?" 
Langhans said while he still enjoys living off-campus and being a member of the South Bend community, his recent experiences with crime have jaded his view of the town. 
"There's a lot of cool parts of South Bend that you get to know being off-campus, but it's hard to look to the bright side of South Bend with what we've had to deal with," he said. "You want to lind the good in it, but it becomes increasingly diffi­cult the more you are taken advantage of."

receive for being executives," Weaver said. 
The Executive Board can choose whether or not they wish to accept this money for their services to SGA and the student body. 
"Last year was the first year they did [take a stipend]," Weaver said. "They told us about it at the end of last year so it was something we needed to vote on .... 
"This year we're looking at things like making ground rules ... not just for this year but it'll continue in years to come," she said. 
While it is not specified in the SGA Constitution if the Executive Board can set aside a stipend for themselves, it is also not stated that they can­not, Falvey said. The addition of a clause stating whether or not they can will be taken to the Constitution Oversight Committee and Falvey said she hopes it is more explicit in the Constitution next year. 
Many BOG members said they took issue with the fact that this stipend is coming out of funds received from the stu­dent government fees included in each student's tuition. 
"I don't see how we can take money we get out of tuition and pay other students," health and wellness commis­sioner Pauline Kistka saitl. 
Class of 2009 president 
Jenny Antonelli agreed. 
"I have an issue with it com­ing out of student funds ... that can be used towards another activity on campus or some type of thing that could benefit the entire student body," she said. 
Members also took issue with the idea that students are deciding whether or not a stipend should be set aside for SGA executives. 
"Is there a way that Karen [Johnson], Patrick [Daniel], Slandie [Dieujuste, director of Residence Life!, and [College President Carol Ann] Mooney can sit down and decide this?" public relations commissioner Katie Danko asked. "I don't think it's ethical for students to decide this." 
Kistka also said she doesn't know how she feels about the fact that the students who will be receiving the money are the ones deciding the budget. 
"We were not informed of this [happening] last year," she said. "My concern is that I know that six people -and I'm not saying you guys, I'm saying on boards prior -were given the option to receive money. If the decision was in their hands and they're the ones going to receive the money, I don't see the open­mindedness of the decision or an unbiased decision regard­ing it. I guess I kind of see a conflict in getting money in general." 
Admissions commissioner Kristle Hodges, who held the same position on last year's 
BOG, said former student body president Kim Hodges and the rest of the Executive Board did not come up with a proposal for the executives to receive a stipend out of the blue. 
"[The student governments] at most schools and universi­ties across the nation not only get paid a stipend every month but they get free room and board," Hodges said. "They get a lot of other privileges that Saint Mary's [executive board] does not get at all," she said. 
Daniel said he knows that the amount the College's Executive Board allocated for a stipend is "a drop in the bucket" compared to larger schools and "very compara­ble" to schools of the same size. 
"This is not something that does not happen," he said. 
Elections commissioner Francesca Johnson, however, said she thinks putting a clause for a ·stipend in the SGA Constitution will change the reasons why people will run for student body president and vice president. 
"When did we get to the point that we need to be rewarded?" she asked. "I think it's taking away from the reasons why in the future peo­ple are going to be running for positions and running for board ... In the past it was because you love student gov­ernment or you love the organization you are in. I don't see why we have to say 'because I put in so many 


hours and because I put in whatever I have to get some­thing out of it."' 
Gruscinski sent an e-mail to the Executive Board members as part of their discussion before approving the budget, stating that she was okay with the executives receiving a stipend, though not the $5,000 last year's Executive Board took. 
However, she "would not keep the stipend and [she] would publicly give it back to the school in a way that [she] knew would benefit the stu­dents." 
"As the president of our stu­dent body, I cannot ethically and intentionally connect myself to something which upsets the student body," she said. 
She said she does not want to receive any sort of stipend from the money collected from student activity fees. 
"I believe it is unethical, no matter how much we would allocate to ourselves or how we try to justify it, to decide to pay ourselves out of student money," Gruscinski said. "The core value for this year is jus­tice and I think we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard and choose what is just."

I had the chance Nuggets to focus on this plane, and the whole scene played out in my head: plane keeps descending over the stadium and Notre Dame and Purdue fans gasp in unison, knowing what's about to come and helpless to stop it. 
This isn't Titanic, and the band stops playing. Screams, then fire. 
On board, passengers call loved ones, then fight. Noble characters straight out of United 93 and Let's Roll lorn. The fly-over military jet from America the Beautiful returns to the air and the President is briefed somewhere, hundreds of miles away. A rush of fire trucks and media, even if the NBC cameras survive. 
Uke something starring Nicholas Cage and we're the 80,000 extras, but after this take we'llnever get to collect our $100 appearance fee. The brat and beer turn in my stomach. 
And then, James Aldridge rushed left for seven yards and the student section polite­ly applauded. The plane kept going, off to South Bend Regional Airport. 
At the time, I didn't say anything to my friends. Maybe nobody else noticed. Maybe I am just a New Yorker oversensi­tive to these things. But the next day, I casually floated it to a friend from Washington D.C., who remembered the plane. Every time she sees a plane like that, she told me, she wonders. A friend 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The Victory March for all 
This week we celebrate the 1 OOth anniversary of the greatest of all university fight songs, the Notre Dame Victory March. During the Stanford game on Saturday more than 800 band alumni will join this year's marching band to com­memorate the occasion. 
. Perhaps this is the right time to suggest a slight change in the lyrics of our treas­ured song. In recent decades a growing number of us in the Notre Dame family, men and women alike, have been singing the last line as: "While her loyal sons and daughters march on to victory." 
It has been more than 35 years since Father llesburgh made Notre Dame coed. Our women athletes are marching on to victory in many sports. Our men and women are achieving greatness together in scholarship and service. It just doesn't feel right to sing only of "loyal sons." 
The proposed change works well musi­cally and rhythmically. Both versions have the same number ofbeal<>. The final verse of the original is "onward to victory." In the new version it is "march on to victory." Both arc forceful and convey determina­tion to suceeed. In the new version the accented beat falls on the active verb "march" rather than the adverb "onward." 
I am not suggesting that we alter the ofliciallyrics as originally written. H.ather, 
9/11 

from Kansas City remembered the plane, too, and said she talked to someone about it during the game. I was not the only one. 
A few weeks ago, of course, we recog­nized the seventh anniversary of Sept. 11. We memorialized the victims by reading their names. The Presidential candidates marched together to place a wreath at Ground Zero. We had a service on earn­pus. 
Two years ago, I lit a candle at the Grotto. This year, I bought Fruit Roll-Ups at Martin's grocery store. The anniversary, like Year Seven in general, passed rela­tively quietly. 
Remembering tlwse who died is a pro­found, and important, experience. But in addition to remembrance, we need to rec­ognize the meaning of Sept. 11 for those still alive. Sept. 11 turns anything we can imagine into a possibility. It loads films and literature with new meaning, because all are suddenly real. It makes a plane that flies over northwest Indiana a possible bomb. 
In the weeks and months after Sept. 11, I expected thi<> sort of reaction. But at the time, I never thought that seven years later, the power would still exist. 
It still influences us. It still terrorizes us. 
We have to be okay with this. We can't get rid of it. No matter what we do to pro­tect ourselves, this imagination now does and always will exist. 
Often today, to talk about Sept. 11 is talk about the politics of the last seven years. It is to speak about war in Afghanistan and, Iraq. It is to speak about the PATRIOT Act and Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Even bipartisan memoriaL<> on the anniversary come loaded with political undertones. 
It's remarkable that Sept. 11 now holds such political potency. This is an enduring national trauma, as the reaction to the 
we can simply adopt the more inclusive lyric as the preferred usage. 

So this Saturday, as the fight song enters its second century, let's sing it anew proudly, joyously acknowledging Notre Dame's diversity, while her loyal sons and daughters march on to victory.

The Wearing of the Green 

Dear Students, Numni, and Fans­After spending five years at Notre Dame during the Davie-era, and watching our beloved Irish sufl'er from the rollereoaster of coaching decisions, poor recruiting, and uninspired play the next six seasons, it's time to help our teams out as best we can. 
As we look around college football nation, the top tier teams' fans unite on those fateful Saturdays and embrace the home field intimidation factor by wearing a unifying color. There have been "black­outs," "whiteouts" and "red seas" for the visiting team to take-in during the game. 
In Irish folklore, there has always been one color that has been with the Irish ancestry representing the rolling hills and fields of shamrocks of t11e Emerald Isle. It has been used as a symbol of unification plane above Notre Dame Stadium proves. But il'> mere mention invokes. a series of polarized political questions about civil lib­erties, race, and religion. Even comment­ing on the politidzation of Sept. 11 becomes a partisan statmnent in il<>elf. 
This politicization of Sept. 11 distracl'i from meaningful policy lessons about which we can all agree: port and border security, emergency rnsponse funding, defense spending. 
But equally importantly, it eomes at the expense of reflection on what Sept. 11 the event actually means fi1r our collective and individual psyches as we move f(Jrward. The observation that the terror of Sept. 11 lingers isn't political. It doesn't explicitly mean we should or shouldn't do anything in particular to stop future terror. 
But it does mean that we have to recog­nize that Sept. 11 still dirnctly impacl'i our daily livns, seven y<~ars later. It means that no matt<~r which side prevails in our politi­cal debates about eivilliberties, we will always live differently. 
It means that we don't need to say, "Never Forget," because wn can't help but remember every time wn'm in an airport or subway or, yes, football stadium.

At Notre Dame's founding the original colors of the university were yellow and blue, symbolizing light and truth respec­tively. After the Dome was gilded, gold and blue became the oflieial colors. 
While I realize (as should everyone associated with Notre Dame-are you listening marketers and clothing compa­nies?) that gold is not yellow, tho symbol­ism of the light and the truth remains. What happens when you mix yellow and blue? 
In the following seasons to come, I expect Notre Dame, Charlie, the students, alumni, and fans to pick one home game ~ each year to show our solidarity through 'The Wearin' of the Green."

Why Jesus approves "Crank me up!" 
Of all the surprises that Jesus' Incarnation unleashed -the inversion of happiness in the Beatitudes, the awesome power of the miracles, the scandal of the Cross, and ultimate triumph of the Hesurrection-F L IF
0

there is one mys-r. ou e ra tory, easy to miss, that. in a sense, FaithPoint 
startles me more than all the others. One day, in the midst of his public ministry, Jesus beholds the crowds "like sheep without a shepherd" and so asks his disciples to "pray that the master of the harvest might send laborers out into the harvest." 
Is it not at least puzzling -if not, frankly, embarrassing-that the self-pro­claimed Good Shepherd, the one whose voice his sheep recognize and so follow, should suddenly see the crowd he predict­ed would follow as "shepherd-less?" And rather imploringly begin to look for some­one to help him? 
It would be like watching a 4th-and-goal play in the game's final minute, and sud­denly see Charlie Weis sitting next to you in the stands, tapping you on the shoulder and saying, 'Too bad there's nobody here who knows to call the play-action." We'd stop our jigging and cranking to scream, "Get down there!" 
Sometimes I feel like responding that way to Jesus. You see the utter misery that the hurricanes have unleashed this month in Haiti, as whole sections of the country starve while living in four feet of mud. And I feel like reminding Jesus: "You had a crowd of 5,000, and fed them all with a wave of your hand. Well, do it again!" 
But right here is the mystery-Jesus doesn't do it again. He doesn'tjust wave his hand and magically take care of the problems of all these people. In fact, he does something much different. He lays one of the biggest guilt trips in recorded history on his disciples. l-Ie says, "The har­vest is .?o rich, but the laborers are just so few.... 
It's as if Jesus realizes his disciples have now reached a certain maturity in their discipleship. So he reveals to them a deep­er mystery of his life -that he needs them as part of his plan of redemption. But not as cogs in a big old ministry machine. Hather, we hear next that most beautiful scene -as one by one, by name, Jesus calls his disciples to him -Peter, Andrew, James, John, Bartholomew, Thaddeus. The list, granted, is a little short on women's names. But the list has grown over the years, and, if we are willing, the list includes us. 
Can we really grasp what is happening here? Jesus is calling us, by name, because for some mysterious reason, Jesus has decided NOT to wave a magic wand over the world and make everything bet­ter. For some mysterious reason, Jesus has decided he wants and needs US to help him fulfill his mission. 
Are we really willing to fathom what we are saying here? For what we are saying is this: that Jesus Christ can't do it all by him-

self-or at least, chooses not to. Jesus Christ needs help. We often recite the famous prayer of St. Teresa of Avila: "Christ has no hands now but yours. Christ has no eyes now but yours." 
And I wonder if we realize how radical a prayer this Doctor of the Church wrote. Because it's tinged with an implication that Jesus can't do it on his own! 
And I want to ask: "Why? He's God­why can't He just do it himself? It'd be a lot easier, and he'd probably do a darn good job of it!" Why doesn't God just fix everything himselr? 
Why do people have to suffer and die in Iraq today? Why does God need peace­makers to do the slow work of global peace for him? 
Why did some people in Haiti die today from starvation? Why does God need us to do the slow work of social justice? 
Why do all children not get equal oppor­tunities in their education? Why does God need teachers committed to the slow work of improving education, so that quality education becomes a reality for every child, no matter their income, race or school district? 
Why doesn't God just lix it all Himself? Why does God look out over our world, and see how helpless we sometimes are, and seem to say, "I wish there was some­body there who could do something about all this." Why doesn't Jesus just lix it all himself? 
All I know is: the day you decided to allow your faith to be the p1·imary lens through which you view the world, is the day you promised to live in the tension of that mystery for the rest of your life. It's either that, or close your eyes and wait it out-but the suffering will still be there when you open your eyes again. 

Jesus just doesn't lix it all. But Jesus does one thing-this we must believe, of it is the mystery of his own suffering on the Cross: He sees it -every bit of our human anguish. He does not close his eyes to one moment of it. 
But after he sees it, he does the most mysterious thing: He turns to us, and he calls our name. 
He doesn't call us to come as perfect human beings, as people with no flaws and no limitations. We only have to look at Peter and James and the rest of the disci­ples to know that. For some mysterious reason, He just asks us to come, and give of our gifts, as generously and skillfully as we can, whatever our limitations may be. 
Christ has a message for the suffering of the world. And his message is this: "Rejoice, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand!" But Christ has no mouth now, but ours. So, don't just sit there-crank it up!

Time Magazine lists "OK Computer" as one of the Top 100 Albums of all time, but Hadiohcad's 1995 sophomore CD "Tho Bends" is truly an all-killer no­filler attnmpt on the band's part. 
As with most of the British alternative band's other CDs. the enigmatic lyrics and intense eneq.,ry in the first few dis­torted guitar chords of opener "Planet Telex" draw the listnner in for the long haul, ready and eager to listen to the rnmaining tracks. 
The title track follows with its dassic rock guitar riffs and symbolic lyrics about deeompression sickness. Though it nnvnr made it as a single, "The Bends" expertly c~aptures some of the band's sentiments about its catapult into fame. 
At~t~ording to Mac Handall's "Exit Musie: The Hadiohead Story:" 
"For their second album. Radiohead chose an extremely symbolic title... Hadiohead rose too soon (due to the suc­cess of 'Creep,' which they were hardly oriented work, "The Unforgiven III," also manages to feature the piano if only for a few moments. "Suicide and Bedemption" is an instrumental track and demonstrates

of the 1990s. The  such killer tracks as  

intense build-up to the chorus of "Here is Gone" from The Goo Goo Dolls' 2002 album "Gutterflower" has often been compared to "High and Dry," "The Bends"' third track, for the ingenious guitar ehord progressions. 
"Fake Plastic Trees" is a beautiful 90s mosh for the duration of tracks. Even fans of other genres would most likely find something to enjoy in "Death Magnetie" if only the albums cover art, a coffin surrounded by a magnetic field. 
The album's first released single, "The Day That Never Comes," is a rel­atively calm reflective piece that builds into a very generic heavy metal rock piece. This is where the major problem with "Death Magnetic" a-rises as lack of original content becomes obvious. The songs are new, but they could be associated with almost any heavy metal band that considers Metallica as one of their influences. 
But as far as sheer entertainment, 
"All Nightmare Long" 
and "Cyanide" arc so 

"Just," a song chock full of guitar chords and lyrics about an argument between Yorke and a narcis­sistic friend. "My Iron Lung" immedi­ately follows; a track about the band's reaction to the unexpected success of "Creep." IIere, the iron lung serves as a metaphor for both the sustaining and how heavy metal can function without lyrics, especially when the lead singer's voice is a growl. In "Death Magnetic" there is no shortage of catchy riffs, heavy metal rock or impressive sound, but originality is lacking. 
"Death Magnetic" is a return to greater quality music, but this album is a rehash of sorts and lacks originali­ty. With songs such as "All Nightmare Long" and "Cyanide" the listener can enjoy speed metal at its best, while "A Day That Never Comes" gives a greater sampling of the bands creative range. 
This album is no doubt to be found on Rock Band VII and Guitar llero X within a few years, as soon as the 
ballad and its ghost-like keyboard sounds and soft guitar chords in the beginning build up to an emotional cho­rus toward the end with intense percus­sion, loud distorted guitar chords, and passionate vocals. According to Green Plastic, a Hadiohead fan site, Thorn Yorke claimed that

rights are given and as soon as the band becomes a little more lenient with the leaking of their music. After all "Death Magnetic" was leaked 10 days early and the only response by Lars Ulrich was to USA Today, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that." 
Ultimately "Death Magnetic" is a step in the right direction, and Metallica is once again reminiscent of their heavy metal prime. fans will no doubt be grateful.

constraint of the band's musical career. 
The album concludes with "Street Spirit (Fade Out)," a soft peaceful melody eontrasted with dark and myste­rious lyrics. 
Despite the immense success of "Creep" in 1993, many people were ready to write Badiohead off as simply a flash in the pan and place the song in with Beck's "Loser" and a slew of other self-deprecating anthems of the post­grunge generation. In spite of poor expectations, "The Bends" marked a clear shift in musical style for the British alternative band from the traditional, introspective, upbeat rock heard in 1993's "Pablo !Ioney" to more experi­mental art rock with an inventive sound and global themes. The trend of shift­ing musical styles continued with each successive album, which allowed Hadiohead to mature and develop not qnly a more adult sound, but also inno­vative music that no one had previously conceived.

Duo leads squad over Trine

Sports Wri tcr 
Irish freshman Kristy Frilling captured the first sin­gles and doubles titles of her col11~giate career on Sept. 21, teaming with senior Kelcy Tefft for the doubles title. 
Frilling, a native of Sydney, Ohio, took down Florida's Anastasia Hevzina 6-4, 3-6, 1-0 to earn the singles title. 
"It was a great way to start her career," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "She showed very good poise, and had to play a lot of tennis in three days." 
To earn her spot in the finals, Frilling had to defeat Florida's Marritt Boonstra. She had less difficulty in that match as she earned a 6-2, 6­3 victory. 
In the doubles bracket, Frilling and Tefft came up with some big wins for the Irish. 
In the final match, Tefft and Frilling knocked off Ken lucky's Carolina Escamilla and Christine Johnson S-2. 
Tefft also competed in the singles draw and defeated Central Florida's Kate Orletsky 6-2, 6-2. 
Sophomore Kristen Rafael also earned a victory over South Florida's lciri Hai 2-6, 6-1, 1-0 on Sunday. 
Overall, the Irish finished with a 6-2 record at the tour­nament, and Frilling and Tefft came out with a 4-0 record in doubles. 
New assistant coach Julia Scaringe will seek to help the Irish on and off the court this season. 
Scaringe was the assistant coach at Harvard last season and was hired at Notre Dame after former assistant Elizabeth Schmidt took the head-coaching job at Rice University. 
"She has been great," Louderback said. "She brings playing as well as coaching experience. She played on a National Championship team at Florida, so she also brings that experience." 
While at Harvard, Scaringe helped coach two All-Ivy League players last season, including Beier Ko, who par­ticipated in the 2008 NCAA Singles Tournament. 
Scaringe is a 2003 graduate of Florida, where she helped lead the Gators at the No. 1 singles position. 
She has a national champi­onship with the Gators on her resume, along with two SEC conference championships, three SEC tournament cham­pionships. She also finished as the NCAA runner-up and national team-indoor runner­up. 
Before entering college, Scaringe also spent some time on the junior circuit as a member of the US National Team. She also participated in all four Grand Slam Events on the junior circuit reaching the round of 16 at the Australian Open. 
"We want to win the Big East Championship," Louderback said. "We also want to put the team in posi­tion to compete for a national championship." 
The Irish will turn to a core group of upperclassmen to lead the way this season. 
The Irish have only two seniors -Tefft and Katie Potts -and three juniors: Cosmina Ciobanu, Kali Krisik and Colleen Rielly. 
"We have a really great set of upper classmen," Louderback said. "When you add in our three juniors, they have been a big part of our success over the last two years." 
Four Irish players will par­ticipate in the All-American tournament beginning on Oct. 2 in Pacific Palisades, Calif.

Lorna Slupczynski and Kaela Hellmann could not be denied. 
The junior-senior combo once again dominated the Saint Mary's offensive attack, combining for 39 kills (19 and 20 respective­ly) in the Belles 3-1 win over Trine University Wednesday night. The win moves the squad to 12-5 on the year, 5-3 in conference play. 
As has been the team's trademark all year, the key to last night's victory was the strong start of the 

team's attacking players. Hellmann fired off seven kills in seven attempts in the first set as she scored over a quarter of the team's points in the first set. Hellmann contributed another four kills in the second set, while fellow senior Cathy Kurczak also chipped in offensively with six kills. 
In the third set the Belles faltered and their sloppy play allowed Trine to over­com.e two match points and take the set by a score of 28-26. But Slupczynski quickly reminded the Thunder that Hellmann was not the only offensive force on the floor, ripping off seven kills and six digs in the final set and helping the Belles earn the win as they took the set 25-16. 
Overlooked in the ofl'en­sive display of llellmann, Slupczynski, and Kurczak is tho ability of freshman Danielle Brink, who distrib­u t ed a n i m p r f) s s i v e 5 (J assists while contributing 11 digs defensively. 
Saint Mary's has now won five out of its last six matches, and carries a great deal of momentum as it tra~els to Michigan to take on Alma College this Friday at 7 p.m.

Belles drop third straight 
"We do not have many games at home this fall and we need to take advantage of the opportu­nities we have to play on our home field," the coach said. 
The loss dropped the Belles to 1-6-1 on the season while the Titans improved to 6-4. The Belles are 0-3-1 in their last four matches against the Titans. Crabbe said he hopes the team learns from the disappointing loss and that they can build upon what has been a relatively disappointing start on the whole. 
"Right now, we need to learn how to win and be the better team," he said. "I hope the players are disappointed and find the motivation to take on our next opponent." 
The Belles should be motivat­ed in their next match when they face Hope College on Saturday. In the teams' previ­ous match up, the Belles squan­dered a 1-0 lead as Hope scored twice in the final seven minutes of play.

"Overall I was very disap­pointed with the effort we showed in the first half," Crabbe said. "We allowed the visiting team to quickly estab­lish the tempo of the game and our girls never matched their match, as they have scored just nine goals in eight games and haven't had a multiple-goal game since a 2-0 win over Mount Mercy on September 13. 

Saint Mary's is winless in their two home games this sea­son, a fact that disappoints Crabbe.

Ex-Bronco Henry arrested by DEA 
Associated Press 

DENVER -Former Denver Broncos running back Travis Henry has been arrested following an alleged cocaine deal, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration  said  
Wednesday.  _  
Henry  and  James  Mack  

were arrested a day earlier after the two met to buy cocaine from a person who was cooperating with authorities, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. 
Mack and Henry were in federal custody on suspicion of knowingly and intention­ally conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. They were advised of charges Wednesday. A preliminary hearing and detention hear­ing were scheduled for Monday. 
It was not immediately known whether Mack had an attorney. Henry's attor­ney, Harvey Steinberg, con­firmed he was representing Henry in the case but declined to comment on the charges when reached by The Associated Press. 
The case has its roots in Montana, where a trooper and DEA agent stopped a car that was carrying six pounds of marijuana and about three kilograms of cocaine on Sept. 16, the affidavit said. 
A passenger in the car, whose name was not dis­closed in the affidavit, told authorities Mack and Henry had supplied him with the drugs, which he was sup­posed to deliver to cus­tomers in Billings. The man said he was supposed to be paid $5,000 for delivering the drugs and transporting about $63,600 in sales pro­ceeds to Henry, according to the affidavit. 
The affidavit indicated that separately, the passen­ger and another customer in Billings already owed Henry about $40,000 in drug pro­ceeds. The passenger told authorities Henry had threatened him and his fam­ily over the debt. 
The passenger agreed to cooperate with authorities and set up a drug deal Tuesday with Henry that led to the arrests of Mack and Henry, the affidavit said.

Boldin out with 


fractured sinus
-
Associated Press 

TEMPE, Ariz. -Anquan Boldin has a fractured sinus as a result of what he acknowledges was the worst hit he's received in his foot­ball career. 
The Arizona Cardinals standout wide receiver does­n't know how long he will be sidelined, but when he returns, he says, there will be no change in his trademark tough, aggressive style. 
"For me it was just a part of football," Boldin said after watching his teammates prac­
. tice on Wednesday. "It's an unfortunate incident that hap­pened but, you know, you take your bumps and bruises." NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended New York Jets safety Eric Smith for one game and fined him $50,000 for the vicious, helmet-to-hel­met hit on Boldin in the end zone during the waning sec­onds of the Jets' 56-35 victory over the Cardinals at the Meadowlands on Sunday. "You never know some­body's intentions," Boldin said, "but I didn't think it was intentional." Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt said it wasn't for him to say whether the pun­ishment was warranted. "I think the commissioner certainly has made it very clear that player safety is an important issue," Whisenhunt said, "and I think he 
addressed that." 
Boldin said he was consult­ing with doctors on whether to have the sinus repaired or let it heal on its own. He expected a decision "in the next couple of days." 
According to the Web site, eMedicine, a high-impact sports injury is the second­most often cause of a sinus fracture. The most common cause is an automobile acci­dent. 
Whisenhunt said that until he hears from doctors, he is not ruling out Boldin's partici­pation in Sunday's home game against Buffalo, although it seems highly improbable that he would play. 
The two-time Pro Bowl receiver scoffed at any sug­gestion that this would change his bruising, aggressive style. 
"As soon as I get back on the field, it's the same old me," he said. "I don't plan on altering the way that I play, because if I did, I wouldn't be Anquan." 
Boldin, his face swollen and his lip cut, said he remembers everything about the play and its aftermath, although he said he may have lost con­sciousness for an instant. 
He crossed the middle of the end zone and went high for Kurt Warner's throw. Boldin was hit in the back by the Jets' Kerry Hhodos, then from the front by Smith, snapping the receiver's head violently backward.

Moss, disgruntled for most of his two seasons with the Haiders, set an NI~L single­season record with 23 touch­down receptions in his first season with Nnw England.

liNING, Texas -Folks in San Frandseo and Philadelphia must be loving this: Even though the Dallas Cowboys tried getting the ball to Terrell Owens on one­third of tlw plays last Sunday, he still wasn't satisfied. 
Is this thn be~,'inning of the end of his blissful relationship with Tony Homo'? Are the Cowboys about to be divided, quarterback supporters on this side, reeeiver supporters on the other'? 
Or was T.O. just blowing ofT steam after a loss to the Washington Hedskins'? 
Back at team headquarters Wednesday, Owens and ltomo insisted a lot is being made of nothing. 
"I know in my heart, this team, we'rn still together," Owens said. "Dude, I promise you, W11'rn fine in this lo1:ker room." 
Owens is well aware that any slightly provocative comnHmt he makes will beeonw big news. So lw should've expeetml a back­lash for saying he didn't get the hall 1mough after catching seven passns, taking two handofl'i and having 11 morn balls thrown his way in a 26-24 loss to the Washington ltndskins. All told, 
T.O. was the focus on 20 of 5S plays. 
"Dude. it was frustration," he said. "Dude, we lost. It was a game we should have won." 
lie also blanwd tlw media for "making their stake at a claim to divide this tnarn -and it's not going to happen." 
"It's funny how the wnek bPfi1re you guys praised mn for giving extra efli1rt," Owens said, refi~rring to positive coverage he rm:nived fi1r making a taekle on an intercnption and a downfield bloek on a touchdown run dur­ing a victory at Grnen Bay, a game in which he caught only two pass11S. 
"Then I come out this week and say I nend to be morn involvnd and I'm vilified .... I fnel like everything is being nit­pieked." 
ltomo gavn his usual lines about Owens wanting the ball as mueh as anyone else but because T.O. is T.O. his requests get more attention, and that he likes teammates who want to be involved. 
"It's easy to work with a guy who goes hard and comes here and wants to win," Homo said. "The rest of the stuff? It's stuff. You're going to go through ups and downs. The season is not going to be without bumps in roads. bumps and bruises along the way. We're going to have good moments and bad moments. If you can't keep an even keel. that's when you get in trouble. But this team is fine. There's enough leadership and people on this team that we're going to be line." 
Owens said he didn't need to talk to Homo or offensive eoordi­nator Jason Garrett to straighten things out. And if he did talk to them. "you guys won't know about it." 
"We've just got to right the ship. That's all," Owens said. "I just think we nned to play better as an ollimsP." 
Ownns' problem with what happennd Sunday was quality more than quantity. 
"Put on the sereen all 18 pass­es that were thrown my way and you make the assessment of' all those passes," Owens said. "We just didn't execute. For whatever the case may be, we just didn't play well." 
Part of the problem appeared to bn how mueh Homo was try­ing to get Owens involved. For instance, running back Marion Barber got only eight carries. Just three were in the second half-and two of those came on the opening drive. 
Homo denied he was trying to appease his star receiver. 
"I don't think you consciously think about anything other than trying to win football games," Romo said. "lie does the same thing. lie believes that getting the ball helps us win.... The rea­son you try and throw him the ball a lot is because he's good. lie gets open. If he wasn't as

kids are as good as any players in the country," Waldrum said. "So we'll certainly push for them to the teams." 
The Irish seniors have played on U.S. junior teams but said that having a chance to join the professional league is a rare opportunity. 
"Our dream was always to play for the [senior] national team. For our generation, those were the pro players," Hanks said. "We looked up to players like Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilley and [Julie] Foudy and all those players and this is a great opportunity for us to make a name for ourselves." 
Waldrum said the opportunity the Irish players have would not have been feasible just sev­nral decades ago. 
"When I first got into coach­ing women ... was in 1989 and I would have never imagined it then," the coach said. "I never dreamt it would turn into the scale it has even on the college scene. I don't think anyone envisioned any kind of women's pro league." 
While the players said they 
are happy to simply have a 
chance to continue playing, 
several of them would have 
preferred destinations. Bock 
and Weber, who both hail from 
the Chicagoland area, said they 
would jump at the chance to 
play for the Chicago Red Stars. 
''I'd obviously love to stay 
close to Chicago just to be close 
to home," Bock said. "It would 
be great to be close to family 
and friends· and even this 
University because of my 
friends." 
And Dew, who grew up in 
Encinitas, Calif., said she would 
like to play for either the Los 
Angeles or Bay Area squad. 
Hanks did not get as lucky as 
her three teammates. The ·Dallas native was dismayed when she found out that the team from her home city will 
not join the league until 2010. 
Still, Hanks said she cannot 
wait for a possible chance at an 
extended soccer career. 
"It was definitely disappoint­
ing that Dallas said they didn't 
have enough money for a stadi­
um so they should come back 
next year," Hanks said. "But, I 
mean, all of us have dreamed 
of going pro so wherever I get 
picked -if I get picked -I'll 
go wherever." 
As Hanks uttered the phrase 
"if I get picked," Dew and Weber chuckled at her. Their laughter seemed to say, "There's no doubt you will get picked." 
And that's how Waldrum feels about all four of the seniors. 
"Not only the experience they gained here at Notre Dame with playing in national cham­pionships and Final Fours and the level of competition we play," the coach said. "But also I think that all of those kids ... with all their national team experience, that when the draft comes around they're gonna have to give our [players] a real hard look." 
Weber said that even though the undefeated Irish still plan on making a national champi­onship run this season, .the prospect of playing profession­ally is too enticing to ignore at this point. 
"We all kind of don't know what were gonna be up to next year so I think its always kind of in the back of your mind," she said. "Right now we're obviously focusing on our sea­son but it's kind of hard not to think about it every once in a while."

After a demoralizing 26-0 loss to Farley to open the sea­son, Walsh has responded with two convincing wins against Pangborn and Lewis. In their two triumphs, the Wild Women have won by more than two touchdowns. 
Walsh captain and line­backer Cindy Brenner has attributed the turnaround to the maturation of the young team. 
"We are a very young team with less than four returning starters," she said. "But our team has done very well adapting and improving from one game to the next. Some of tlw younger gir Is have stepped up and made big plays." 
Brenner added that the ddense has done a tremen­dous job. 
"Last game was our head coach's 22nd birthday and he asked the defense for an interception," she said. "We gave him three." 
The emergence of junior wide receiver Kim Bugos has also been a key factor in the growth of the passing offense. 
"In the 14-0 win against Lewis, Bugos made some great catches to lead the offense to those two touch­downs," Brenner said. 
The story of the season for the Whirlwinds has been the defense, led by senior line­bachr Erin Fitzpatrick. The Whirlwinds have yet to allow a single point on defense and are trying to extend their shutout streak. 
"In our last game, our defense played great as usual and ended up with four inter­ceptions," senior .captain .lenni Gargula said. 
Not to be outdone, the oiTensc for Welsh Family has bf)en equally impressive. 
"Our offense has had no trouble moving the ball on dofenses and scoring," Gargula said. 
Senior wide receiver Katherine llart has combined with quarterback Gargula to form a formidable tandem. Gargula has found Hart in the end zone four times this year, twice in each game. They will try to continue that streak against the Wild Women. 
Breen-Phlllips vs. Pangborn 
Not many teams can head into the third week of a sea­son winless and undefeated, but Breen-Phillips is doing just that. 
The Babes (0-0-2) hope to change from their tying ways tonight when they play Pangborn (1-2). On the sea­son, Breen-Phillips has only managed six points, on a sixty-yard touchdown pass against Badin two weeks ago in a game that ended 6-6. Last weekend, the Babes tied Farley 0-0. 
In order to preserve the tie, Breen-Phillips' defense stopped Farley on two plays at the one-yard line with less than thirty seconds left. This goal line stand and the defense as a whole have defined the season thus far for the Babes. 
"We're proud of how our defense held up," senior team captain Melissa Meagher said. "But lwe are] still disappoint­ed that we didn't win.... Our offense needs to execute in key situations." 
In order for the Babes offense to produce as Meagher wishes, they will have to outdo an opportunistic Pangborn defense. Last week against Badin, the Phoxes defense had three intercep­tions in the first half. Those takeaways led the way to Pangborn's first and only vic­tory this year. That victory could generate some new energy. 
"We have heard that Breen­Phillips is a tough team," sophomore captain Kathy Poploski said. "We just need to keep up the intensity from Sunday." 
Tonight at the Riehle Fields at 7 p.m., Breen-Phillips looks to remain undefeated and hope to notch its first win, 
against  a  Pangborn  team  
looking to  even  up its own  
record.

Arinstrong accused of doping 
Associated Press 
PARIS -It's just like old times for Lance Armstrong. 
Hours after the French anti­doping authority challenged the seven-time Tour de France champion to agree to retest his 1999 urine samples to see whether a French newspaper was right when it reported they contained a banned substance, Armstrong rejected the notion, lashing out at the agency's leader, Pierre Bordry. 
"Unfortunately, Mr. Bordry is new to these issues and his proposal is based on a funda­mental failure to understand the facts. In 2005, some research was conducted on urine samples left over from the 1998 and 1999 Tours de France," Armstrong said in a statement Wednesday night. "That research was the subject of an independent investiga­tion, and the conclusions of the investigation were that the 1998 and 1999 Tour de France samples have not been main­tained properly, have been compromised in many ways, and even three years ago could not be tested to provide any meaningful results. 
"There is simply nothing that I can agree to that would pro­vide any relevant evidence about 1999." 
Even so, the proposal renewed debate about one of the most contested questions surrounding Armstrong: whether he was dean when he won. He has always insisted that he was, and his new trmm, Astana, is hiring a drug-testing expert, who will post Armstrong's drug testing results on the internet, to try to silence doubters. 
In a statement, the agency proposed the rider "prove his good faith" by agreeing to retesting of his samples from the 1999 Tour, the first in Armstrong's record string of seven wins. 
The samples are frozen in a drug testing laboratory in the suburbs of Paris. They've been a source of controversy since L'Equipe reported in 2005 that a new round of tests on the "B" samples found EPO, a blood­boosting hormone that enhances endurance. 


The agency said it was acting in the interests "of objectivity and of justice and to allow the cyclist Lance Armstrong to cut short the rumors concerning him, if they are unfounded." 
In drug testing, urine is divided into "A" and "B" sam­ples, and both must show traces of a banned substance for the test to be declared posi­tive. 
But only remains from six "B" samples have been kept from Armstrong's 1999 Tour, the French agency said. So even if the "B" samples came back positive in new testing, there are no "A" samples left against which to compare results. 
Armstrong said then he was the victim of a "witch hunt." A Dutch lawyer appointed by cycling's governing body later cleared Armstrong. But Dick Pound, who then led the World Anti-Doping Agency, said the lawyer's findings were full of holes. And in his statement, Armstrong said that independ­ent investigation recommended the issues be taken before an independent tribunal. 
"Two years ago I agreed to have all of these issues aired and decided by that tribunal, but WADA and the French Ministry refused," Armstrong said. "If Mr. Bordry woulc;l now like to re-examine the past, he must start with presenting the issues of the misconduct of the French laboratory, the French Ministry, and WADA before a proper tribunal." 
Bordry told L'Equipe he wanted to act as "a referee" between the newspaper and Armstrong. But Bordry seemed to already have an opinion, speaking to the newspaper of samples "which contain ery­thropoietin (EPO)." 
"I want this comeback to take place in the best circum­stances," L'Equipe quoted him as saying in its Wednesday edi­tion. "This way, he will perhaps have the chance to affirm that he never cheated during his brilliant career."

"The CCIIA is so tight, you never know who's going to eome out and be the lead dog in the race," Condra said. "Some teams are picked first in the league in the begin­ning and they end up in the bottom six." 
Last year, Notre Dame was ranked third in both preseason· polls. The Irish finished fourth, but mainly beeause of a red-hot start, as the team struggled during the middle part of the season. 
"Being ranked that high, there's always a target on your chest," Condra said. "Teams aren't going to take you lightly and we saw that in the middle of last year." 
.Jackson named Condra team eaptain Monday, along with alternates Christian Hanson, Hyan Thang and Kyle Lawson. A senior right wing from Livonia, Mich., Condra attack. That strategy paid off in a game-clinching third goal in the 69th minute. Marosevic was the goal-scorer this time as he received a Fuzetti pass and fired past Tuttle. 
Although the Irish pressed for the rest of the game and generated five corner kicks, they were unable to mount a eomeback. 
"They were content to sit on their lead and eounter, so it was difficult to ereate ehanees," Clark said of the seeond half. "We ereated a lot of half-ehances. I felt in a funny way it was easier for them as they could sit back and counter."

Hanson, a senior center, came on at the end of last sea­son for the Irish, a trend Jackson hopes Hanson contin­ues in the new campaign. Condra said Hanson's affability is a good quality to have in an alternate captain.

Irish fall for second straight game, 3-1 on the road to Michigan 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame had another 
first Wednesday night against 
Michigan, but this was one 
that Irish coach Bobby Clark 
may opt not to remember. 
With its 3-1 loss to Michigan in Ypsilanti, Mich .. Notre Damn has lost haek-to-back regular season games for the first time undor the Scotsman's eight-year tenure as lwad coach. 
The loss drops No. H Notre Damn's record to 6-3-1 overall Oil tJw SIHlSOn. It Will likely be accompanied by a fall in the rankings. but that's of little importance to Clark, who sees benefit in tlw difl1cult competi­tion the Irish have played to datil. 
"We've played arguably the lol}ghost srheduln in the eoun­try, and we're going to lose games like it or lump it," Clark said. "My approach is always to get as hard a schedule as possible, and hopefully it pre­pares us for down the road. 
"If we're fortunate enough to make the INCAAI Tournament in November, we'll be battle­hardened and ready for any­thing the Tournament throws at us," he said. 
Wednesday night was a good preview of the type of game the Irish might see come November. Although the visi­tors possessed the ball for the majority of the game, Notre Dame ran into a stingy Michigan defense that sat back and looked to counter. 
The Wolverines made the initial breakthrough in the len th minute on their first shot of the game. Finding space twenty-five yards from the goal, Michigan junior forward Mauro Fuzetti ripped a low shot past Notre Dame goal­keeper Phillip Tuttle, who was given his lirst start of the sea­son by Clark. 
The Irish responded 13 min­utes later when sophomore forward Jeb Brovsky threaded a ball behind the Michigan defense into the path of fellow forward Bright Dike. The sen­ior made no mistake as he fired it home from five yards out. With the goal. Dike has a team-leading severi tallies, and he's found the back of the net

Badin and Lewis face off 
Walsh takes on Welsh Family; Breen-Phillips plays Pangborn 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI, 
MATT WILSEY and 
RYAN O'CONNELL 
Sports Writers 
With both teams coming ofT a loss. Badin will take on the Lewis tonight at 9 p.m. at Biehle Field. 
The Bullfrogs (0-2-1) lost to Pangborn 21-9 last week. while the Chicks (0-2) lost to Walsh 14-0. 
Despite being shut out, Lewis captain Katie Sushinksy was not entirely displeased with her team's performance. 
"Collectively, we showed great improvement on both 

sides of the ball," she said. 
Sushinksy said turnovers were a main factor in the loss. In practice. the team has focused on taking care of the ball in hopes of winning the turnover battle in future games. 
So far. the Chicks' strength has been their defensive line, which created an aggressive pass rush last game. 
On the other sideline, Badin struggled with moving the ball in their last game. 
"Pangborn was able to pick up on where our receivers were running," Bullfrogs cap­tain Katie Hose Hackney said. 
As a result. the Bullfrogs' focus in practice has been 
mainly to diversify their offense to eonfuse opponents. On defense, they are working on the fundamentals, such as pulling flags. Badin's strength thus far seems to be its ability to share the ball. 
"Our wide reeeivers have caught about an equal num­ber of passes." Hackney said. "That has reaLly bnen the core ol' our team."

into a relationship with a new community where you will 
continue to learn and share the gifts and talents you have 
nurtured at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and Holy Cross 
College. It would be a chance to challenge yourself to be 
transformed and, in return, transform the world. 
Annually, over two hundred graduating seniors 
from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and Holy Cross commit to 
a year or two of post-graduate service at over one hundred 
sites across the nation and world. They serve with a range 
of programs and agencies, from internationally recognized 
organizations like the Peace Corps and Jesuit Volunteer 
Corps, to national teaching programs like ACE and Teach 
for America, to local Americorps projects and Catholic 
Worker houses. They go on to become teachers, lawyers, 
doctors, community organizers, social workers, politicians, 
CEOs, mothers, fathers, and so much more. 
Consider joining this group of outstanding gradu­
ates. There are opportunities to serve among the young, 
the old, the sick, the hungry, the homeless, the impris­
oned, the lonely, the poor, and the oppressed; to learn 
about a new culture, language or perspective on life; to 
build relationships with new friends and communities; to 
change your world. 
As we seek to live in solidarity with our sisters and 
brothers, we remember Jesus called love the greatest of all 
commandments--to love the Lord God with all our hearts 
and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Mark 12:28-31). It is 
not easy, but it remains no less our challenge and call. It is 
the foundation on which we will build the justice we seek 
and the peace we long for. 
Be a part of the transformation we are called to, 
and be transformed. Give yourself away. One or more of 
the opportunities on these pages could quite possibly 
change you forever. 
You are in my prayers. God bless you well.
