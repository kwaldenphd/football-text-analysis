By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
Two student-professor teams faced off at LaFortune Student Center Tuesday night as they debated the role of religion in politics. 
Political science professor David Campbell and senior Kathleen Sullivan. a political science major, argued that religion doesn't have a place in the political speetrum. Their opponents, Law School professor Riehard Garnett and senior Corey Mehlos, co-presi­dent of College Democrats, said there are times when religion can be appropriate in political settings.

University ren1en1bers 
soldiers, sends packages 
By ANN-MARIE WOODS 
News Writer 

As Notre Dame students count the days to go home for Thanksgiving, one group wants to remember fellow Americans that don't have the privilege of spending the holi­day with their families. 
Bearing in mind men and women in the armed forces abroad, the Notre Dame Accounting Association (NDAA) organized its annual care-package drive, inviting students to send gifts to deployed soldiers, primarily those in the Middle East. 
The drive ends this weekend. Senior Elizabeth Byrum, NDAA co-director of communi­
ty service, said the care pack­ages are a way to show the troops support and let them know "there are students at Notre Dame and other places that have them in their thoughts and prayers." 
She said the packages will include items the soldiers might enjoy, but do not neces­sarily have access to while they're abroad, like candy and" beef jerky. But the care pack­ages will also have more prac­tical supplies, like sunscreen and chapstick. 
Byrum said the NOAA has also received donations from different stores in the commu­nity to help pay for the things in the packages.

On Saturday, Nov. 3, 2007, I traveled to 
Chkago sen one of Time Magazine's 100

This was an adventurn fi·aught with 
ntmr-disaster, crnnpy cabbies and what

wa.'i still one of

thn most arna.z­
ing times of my Editor 
liliJ. 
llowevcr, 
since I cannot fit the entim story in this 
column, I will focus on one thing -the 
story of my huge regret. 

In tlw immortal words of this influen­
tial man. I am going to tell you the end of 
the story first and then we'll Tarantino it. 
The story ends with the lights suddenly 
rn-illuminating the 20,000 some faces in 
tlw crowd, while a thunderous alarm 
sounded. 
Let the adventurn begin. 

Thn show did not lm1-,rin at 7. The show 
did not begin at 7:30. Nay, the show 
began at 8 -one hour late. 
Ilowever. the audience's grumblings 
wern lost among gasps when the lighl'i 
went out and wn heard the announee­
nwnt. 
"This summer Dane Cook brings you 
'Hough Around the Edges."' 
Then a liuniliar voice, that of Dann 
Cook, interrupted with, "!ley, that's not 
this summer, tlmt's tonight!" 
The crowd went wild and Dane Cook 
took thn stage. A'i can be expected, the 
act was hilarious. lin had a lot of new 
material. and the old material he used 
WIL'> spiced up with new bits. 
I eouldn't sit up straight at times and 

WIL'i clinging to my chair for support. My 
diaphragm hurt from laughing so hard. 
In summary, I am glad I went to the 

hath room bt~li1re the show (yes, I thought 
alwad). 
Now I will tell you about a moment 

that will haunt me fi1r the rest of my life. 
It may wdl become the biggest regret in my liliJ. Alter Cook returned li>r his eneorn, he mentioned how much he loves Kool-Aid. Anyone who h<L'> heard his bit about the Kooi-Aid Man (Oh Yeah!) knows what wa'i to come next. 
However, he did not continue. 
lnsttmd he said, "I know many of you enjoy this bit and some ofyou can even say it better than I ean by now, so I'm giving you the chance." 

Wa'i he serious? I know that bit inside 
and out, and I am not onn to be shy in 
front of a crowd, but I still had reserva­
tions. 

There were thousands of people in the audience. Still, I wa'i about one second away from standing up, when a guy two rows in front of me did. 
I wa'i in the filth row. The guy was two rows in front of me in the same seat. He wa.'> drunk. and had less to think about. lie W<L'> ehosen, and he butchered the bit. 
I was one second away from having one of those only-in-Hollywood dream­come-true moments. I wa'i so dose... so dose. 
Anyway, after the drunk guy, Dan, fin­ished ruining Dane Cook's material, Dane told one more story and said, "I am going to lnave you with a song I love. I am sure most of you know the words." 
At that, the lighl'i !lashed on and a thunderous alarm sounded, with about 20,000 people singing along.

Author exmnines nuclear abolition 
By LIZ MILLER 
News Writer 
Near the end of the Cold War, the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union came close to doing away with nuclear warfare, bestselling author and nuclear abolitionist Jonathan Schell told an audi­ence in the Ilesburgh Center for International Studies Tuesday. 
The author of "The Fate of the Earth" focused his lecture, titled "Nuclear Abolition in 1986-And Now," on a 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, where President Ronald Reagan met with Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 
During this summit, the lead­ers of the superpower nations came extremely close to abol­ishing nuclear weapons alto­gether, he said -a fact many people may find difficult to believe. 
Opting not to simply reem­phasize the potential danger of nuclear weapons, Schell aimed to explore this historical episode and use it to illuminate the presp,nt nuclear armament situation. 
Schell said he finds a surpris­ing ally in Reagan, whom he refermd to as "the most right­wing president of the Cold War pPriod." 
The content of the 1986 sum­mit reveals Reagan was vehe­mently opposed to nuclear weapons, Schell said. The negotiations centered on a potential significant reduction of nuclear arms, which both leaders desired. 
Reagan, to the surprise of his advisors, announced "it would be fine with me if we eliminat­ed all nuclear weapons," Schell said. 
Dissuaded by Richard Perle, his assistant secretary of defense, Reagan eventually declined any such agreement, Schell said. But despite this, he said the two leaders jointly stated "a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought." 
And their ability to see eye­to-eye on this matter, he said, proves the issue of nuclear warfare poses serious threats to mankind, and these should outweigh political and military motivations. 
"We have a common humani­ty that extends beneath the partisan quarrels," Schell said. 
While many argued a heavy nuclear arsenal acts as a "deterrent" from nuclear war, Schell considers the weapons to be a "proliferant." By keeping a nuclear arsenal, world leaders have created a "two-tier world," dividing those nations who have nuclear power from those who do not, Schell said. 
And this only creates more incentive for countries to imple­ment nuclear weapon pro­grams in order to join the first tier. 
Moreover, recent events, Schell said, are forcing the question of nuclear weapons back into the public sphere. 
Schell pointed to the Pentagon's new offensive initia­tive, called the "Global Strike." Its mission includes developing the ability to launch a missile strike on any place on the globe in a timeframe of 30 minutes to one hour. 
He also said that in the past year alone, a dozen countries ranging from North Korea to Brazil have expressed interest in possessing nuclear weapons. 
But public opinion is decided­ly against nuclear weapons, he said. Schell cited a recent poll taken by the University of Maryland, which found that 73 percent of Americans are in favor of abolition of nuclear weapons. That led Schell to believe the public would back nuclear disarmament if politi­cians moved in that direction. 
"But," he asked, "where is the political will?" 
Schell ended his lecture with a story he said Reagan origi­nally imagined about a future meeting with Gorbachev. 
"[Reagan] and Gorbachev would come to Iceland, and each of them would bring the last nuclear missile from each country with them," Schell said. "Then they would give a tremendous party for the whole world.... The president would be very old by then and Gorbachev would not recognize him. 
"The president would say 'Hello, Mikhail.' And Gorbachev would say, 'Ron, is it you?' And then they would destroy the last missile."

In response to Sullivan, Garnett said Kennedy's speech is often taken out of context and used to support a new trend of "radically privatizing our religions."

And though the panelists didn't reach a consensus, the Campbell-Sullivan team said that, at least at Notre Dame, the role and influence of reli­gion in life seems to be better outlined. 
"I think the advantage of an education from Notre Dame is that you can -through cours­es, readings and conversa­tions with friends -figure out how your faith will inform in your politics and public lives," Campbell said.

Bhutto demands Musharraf step down 
LAHORE. Pakistan -Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto demanded the resigna­tion of U.S.-backed President Gen. Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday, dashing Western hopes that the two moderate leaders would form an alliance to confront strengthening Islamic extremists. · 
Bhutto, just placed under house arrest for the second time since her return from exile, said she was working to forge a partnership with Nawaz Sharif. the man overthrown as prime minister in a 1999 coup by Musharraf.

Iran's decision to release the documents, whieh were sefm by U.N. inspectors two years ago, was seen as a concession designed to head off the threat of new U.N. sanctions. 
But the diplomats said Tehran has failed to meet other requests made by the International Atomic Energy Agency in its attempts to end nearly two decades of nuelear secrecy on the part of Iran.

There was no evidenee of intent by the boy who accidentally ignited brush outside his home by playing with matches, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a state­ment. 
Authorities are referring the case to the Department of Children and Family Services to determine if further steps are necessary. No other information about the investigation was released because the case involves a minor. 

Flaming backpack evacuates airport 
PHOENIX -A backpack caught fire Tuesday in the cargo area at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, leading to an evacuation, but authorities said the flames were likely caused by heat from a eonveyor belt. The bag contained no explosives or other banned items, just leaking toiletries. 
The impact probably caused toiletries contain­ing alcohol to leak, and a combination of heat from the conveyor belt and its track rubbing against the backpack caused it to catch fire, Gehlbach said. 
Th1~ lire was extinguished quickly, Gehlbaeh said. 
About 10 a.m.. a baggage handler loading bags on the US Airways plane noticed that the back­pack was hot and set it aside. The fire depart­ment was called when the bag began to smoke, and they in turn called in a hazardous materials team as a preeaution.

Strikes to cripple Paris mass transit 
Public transportation workers, students join to protest recent government decisions

PARIS -Strikers shut down much of France's national rail service after rush hour. Tuesday night, and millions of Paris com­muters prepared to go without subways when the city's train crews join the walkout. 
People planned to use the capital's new bicycle rental service, share cars or stay home during the Wednesday subway strike. Others said they would walk.

Unlike recent limited transportation strikes, rail unions set no time limit for the shutdown called to protest the conservative government's move to eliminate special rules that allow train drivers and cer­tain other public workers to retire early.

llistorieally, thn University has seen a high level of inter­est from students in Latin Amnriea, he said, but more recently his office has been targeting Asian countries heavily. This year, for exam­pin, South Korea boasts the highest number of internation­al students enrolled in the current freshman elass. 
"The oconomy is doing ext.rnmnly well in Asia, so we're putting our money where our mouth is," Saracino said.

Dan Saracino assistant provost Undergraduate Admissions 
Princeton and the University of Virginia to eliminate their early admissions programs last fall have already had a bearing on Notre Dame's admissions process this year -and will continue to do so. 
Because there are usually overlapping candidates that apply to those schools and to Notre Dame, many students admitted early will not aecept or decline their offer until the spring, when those other sehools have released their deeisions. 
"That eould cause some con­fusion within our application pool, and it will be different to predict a yield on early action and rngular action students," Saradno said. 

Tho University has also teamnd this ynar with eompa­nins such as ()unstBridge and the outside vendor Hoyall & Company to attraet more domnstic students. {)uestBridge, an online Web sitn, helps thn admissions committee identify talented students l'rom lower socioeco­

matches them with the good financial aid paekages the University can offer, Saracino said. 
Hoyall & Company, based in Biehmond, Va., targets high­achieving minority students and inc.ludes them in a data­base of potential applicants. It means applicants are identi­lied earlier than ever before. 
"For us, undergraduate admissions has evolved into an 18-month eyde instnad of 12­

month cyele," Saracino said. 
In order to be considered for early aetion admission, eandi­dates had to submit applica­tions to the ad missions office either electronically or through regular the postal system no later than Nov. 1. Deeision letters that admit, defer or deny the applicant admission to the University are usually mailed out on Dec. 15, and admitted students have until May 1 to accept or deeline the offer, Saracino said. 
Other universities also offer specific early admission pro­grams, inducting early deci­sion or single-ehoiee early action. Under a binding early dneision agreement, the candi­date -as well as their par­ents and high school guidance counselor -must sign a note pledging the applicant will 
attend that uni­versity il' admit­ted. Therefore, thny may only apply early to only one institu­tion, Saracino said. 
Sing Ie-choic e early aetion, on thn other hand, is non-binding but mandates the stu­
dent  does  not  
apply  early  to  
other  sehools.  

Admitted stu­dents have until May 1 to aeeept or deeline their admissions otTer. 
Notre Dame, however, has always offered a very basic early action program that allows stu­dents to apply early to as many schools as they wish. 
"We personally do not offer early deeision or sin­gle-choice early action because 

we don't believe it is in the best interest of the appli­cants," Saracino said. "Seniors are still going through the evaluation process and we want to give them plenty of time to review other colleges [and] receive financial aid packages so that they can make an informed decision by the May 1 deadline."

Sirius shareholders allow XM purchase 
· NEW YORK -Shareholders approved a deal Tuesday to allow Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. to acquire its rival XM Satellite Hadio Holdings Inc. for about $5 billion, but the largest hurdle has yet to come ­regulatory approval in Washington. 
Shareholders of Sirius and XM had been widely expflcted to approve the deal, which would allow the companies to save costs on programming, acquiring sub­scribers and broadcasting. Shareholder advisory firms had already endorsed the deal. 
More difficult will be getting the deal approved in Washington, where the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission must both give their blessing. Several consumer groups have opposed the combination, saying it would create a monopoly that could hurt consumers. 
U.S. begins fiscal year with high deficit 
WASHINGTON -The government start­ed the new budget year with an October deficit of $55.6 billion, up sharply from last year even though government rev­enues hit an all-time high for the month. 
The Treasury Department reported Tuesday that the defieit for the first month in the new budget year was up 12.6 per­cent from the imbalance in October 2006. 
The Congressional Budget Office is fore­casting that tiH1 imbalance for the entire year will show an improvement from last year, when the deficit fell to $162.8 bil­lion. a five-year low. 
The CBO is projecting that the deficit for the current 2008 budget year will decline to $155 billion. But CBO is forecasting that deficits will begin to rise again in 2009 and some private economists are calling for the imbalance to start rising this budget year. 
The 2007 deficit for the budget year that ended on S(1pt. 30 was 34.4 percent lower than the $248.2 billion deficit recorded in 2006, reflecting faster growth in govern­ment revenues than spending. 

Bay Area economy hurt by oil spill 
Seafood, tourism industries suffer from closed beaches, delayed fishing seasons 
Associated Press 

SAN FHANCISCO -The oil spill that has already fouled San Francisco Bay and delayed the Dungeness crab season is raising fears that visitors will be reluc­tant to dine in the city's famed seafood restaurants. 
"It's not going to be a pretty picture. It's definite­ly going to hurt," said Anthony Geraldi. co-owner of Fisherman's Grotto, adding that seafood sales are the one bright spot during the normally slow fall tourism season. 
Several beaches remained closed Tuesday, nearly a week after a cargo ship struck the Bay Bridge, releasing 58,000 gallons of bunker fuel in the bay's biggest oil spill in nearly two decades. 
The sea lions and other marine mammals at the city's world-famous Fisherman's Wharf have largely avoided exposure to the oil, and the stench of fuel that had hung over the bay dissipated by Tuesday. But dark, patchy slicks continue to float in some areas, and several beaches remained closed as teams in yellow hazardous-mate­rials suits shoved sticky globs of oil and sand into plastic bags.

Chlamydia cases set record for U.S. STDs 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -More than 1 mil­lion cases of Chlamydia were reported in the United States last year -the most ever reported for a sexually transmit­ted disease, federal health offi­cials said Tuesday. 
Offieials at thP. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they think better and more intensive screening aceounts for mueh of the increase, but added that ehlamydia was not the only sexually transmitted disease on the rise. 
Gonorrhea rates are jumping again after hitting a record low, and an increasing number of cases are eaused by a "super­bug" version resistant to com­mon antibiotics. 
Syphilis is rising, too. The rate of congenital syphilis -which can deform or kill babies -rose for the first time in 15 years. 
"Hopefully we will not see this turn into a trend," said Dr. Khalil Ghanem, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University's School of medicine. 
The CDC releases a report each year on chlamydia, gonor­rhea and syphilis, three diseases caused by sexually transmitted bacteria. 
Chlamydia is the most com­mon. Nearly 1,031,000 cases were reported last year, up from 976,000 the year before. 
The count broke the single­year record for reported cases of a sexually transmitted disease, which was 1,013,436 cases of gonorrhea, set in 1978. 
Putting those numbers into rates, there were about 348 cases of chlamydia per 100,000 people in 2006, up 5.6 percent from the 329 per 100,000 rate in 2005. 
Since 1993, the CDC has rec­ommended annual screening in sexually active women ages 15 to 25. Meanwhile, urine and swab tests for the bacteria are getting better and are used more often, for men as well as women, said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., director of the CDC's Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention. 
About three-quarters of women infected with chlamydia have no symptoms. Left untreat­ed, the infection can spread and ultimately can lead to infertility. It's easily treated if caught early. 
Health officials believe as many as 2.8 million new cases may actually be occurring each year, he added. 
Chlamydia infection rates are more than seven times higher in black women then whites, and more than twice as high in black women than Hispanics. But it's a risk women of all races should consider, CDC officials said. 
"If (health care) providers think young women in their practice don't have chlamydia, they should think again," said Dr. Stuart Berman, a CDC epi­demiologist. 
The gonorrhea story is some­what different. 
In 2004, the nation's gonor­rhea rate fell to 112.4 cases per 100,000 people in 2004, the low­est level since the government started tracking cases in 1941. 
But since then, health officials have seen two consecutive years of increases. The 2006 rate ­about 121 per 100,000-repre­sents a 5.5 percent increase from 2005. 

Health officials don't know exactly how many superbug cases there were among the more than 358,000 gonorrhea cases reported in 2006. But a surveillance projeet of 28 cities found that 14 percent were resistant to ciprofloxacin and other medicines in the fluoro­quinolones dass of antibioties. 
Similar samples found that 9 percent were resistant to those antibiotics in 2005, and 7 per­cent were resistant in 2004. The appearance of the super bug has been previously reported, and the CDC is April advised doctors to stop using those drugs against gonorrhea. 
Douglas said it doesn't look like the superbugs are the rea­son for gonorrhea's escalating numbers overall, but they're not sure what is driving the increase. 
NDprof: Polls not accurate 
Special to The Observer 
Current polls tell us that Sen. Hillary Clinton clearly is the fron­trunner for the Democratic nomi­nation, and Rudy Giuliani has taken the lead among Republican eandidates. But with a year to go before elections, can we be sure that these will be the two names on the ballot for presi­dent? 
Not necessarily, according to University of Notre Dame politi­cal scientist Darren Davis, a nationally recognized expert in public opinion, elections and vot­ing behavior and author of "Negative Uberty: Public Opinion and the Terrorist Attacks on America." 
"Public opinion polls are an indispensable resource in elec­tions and governance, and if done correctly, provide a reliable snapshot of how the public per­ceives candidates and issues," says Davis. 
"However, without a complete understanding of how voters reach their decisions, the factors that impinge upon those deci­sions, and equally important, the underlying methodology of opin­ion surveys, polling results ean be-and often are-mislead­ing. It is true that one can get public opinion polls to say what people want them to say." 
Consider the record of some previous Demoeratie year­ahead polls: 
+ 
In November 1971, surveys predicted that Democrats would nominate Edward Kennedy or Edwin Muskie. In 1972, the nominee was George McGovern. 

+ 
In November 1975, Kennedy again was predicted the Democratic nominee: but in 1976, Jimmy Carter was nomi­natnd. 

+

"Tho Catholic identity of the University," says the Mission Statement, "depnnds upon ... the ... presence of a predominant number of Catholic intellec­tuals." Ex Corde Ecdesiae (ECE), the 1990 apostolic eon­stitution on Catholic Charles Rice universities, requires morn 
Right or
explicitly that "the 
Wrong?
number of non­Catholic teachers should not be allowed to eonstitute a majority within the institution." Notre Dame's pursuit of recognition as an elite msearch university has coincided with a sovere drop in the pnn:nnt of faculty who identify themsPlves as Catholic. Hetirements and other factors portend an irreversible dedine, far bP.low 50 per­cont. That can be avertod, as the Project Sycamore analysis shows, only by an immodiato change to the hiring each year of a strong majority of Catholics. 
Thn administration creatnd an ad hoc committee to addrnss this problem. The September report of that eommittee is less than persuasive in its analysis and not hnlpful in its conclusions. But that report is not the subject of this nssay. Hather, it will be useful to reflect on the Oct. 11 address, "Catholic Colleges and Universities Today," by Cardinal Avery Dulles at Assumption College. 
A convert and the son of John Foster Dulles, President Eisenhower's Secretary of State, the Cardinal has rendered dis­tinguished service to Catholic higher edu­cation. Using as his "primary !,'llides" ECE and Cardinal John Henry Newman's "The Idea of a University," Cardinal Dulles addresses bluntly the hiring of Catholic faculty. He does so in the context of culture and the relation of the univer­sity to the Church and its magisterium or teaching authority. A "Catholic institu­tion," he said, "must be founded on three principles: that there is a God, that he has made a full and fmal revelation of himself in Jesus Christ and that the Catholic Church is the authorized custo­dian and teacher of this body of revealed truth." 
The Cardinal proposed "that all disci­plines involving human values should be taught at a Catholic institution with due attention to their religious implications." "Graduates," he said, "should not go forth with an advanced education in liter­ature and science, while remaining at grade school level in their knowledge of religion," induding "the interplay between faith and reason." He reminds 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

us that "lwle live in a consumerist society, 
in which colleges tend to shape their poli­
cies according to tlw demands of the 
market, as though the measure of sue­
cess were to construct mom buildings 
and increase student enrollmnnt. ... Our 
colleges and universities must ... guard 
against being eoopted into this culture, 
which is ... anti-Christian and dehuman­
izing." 

The cardinal's remarks are relevant to 
Notre Dame in his treatment of religious 
diversity and the marginalization of reli­
gion by the academic establishment. Ile 
questioned the pursuit of diversity as a 
goal in itself: "Postmodern students ... 
imagine that changn and diversity arn 
desirable for their own sakes.... 
IS]tudents should be educated for the 
world of today I and I a variety of cultures 
may be a source of enrichment. But for 
nations to live together in peacn and 
friendship, they must share common con­
victions regarding ... the basic norms of' 
morality." 

"Religious diversity," he said, "is not desirable in itself. It appeals chiefly to those who believe there is no truth in religion anyway. If we bolieve that God is one, and that Jesus is his incarnate Son, we will hope that all peoples, with their difl'erent voices and idioms, may someday unite in praising him. To make this goal persuasive in the contemporary atmos­phere of subjectivism and relativism is a serious challenge. Still another challenge eomes from the academic establishment in America today. In secular circles there is a virtual consensus that no courses ought to be taught from a distinctive reli­gious point of view. Faith is generally held to have no place in the classroom, at least on the level of higher education. If this only means that faith should not be imposed in the classroom. we can agree. But if it means that professors should not manifest their religious beliefs or seek to defend them, the objection is unsound." 
Cardinal Dulles went on to relate the hiring of all faculty to mission without limitation to percentages. "A Catholic institution," he said, "has to be clear about its mission. An essential step ... is that faculty be hired for mission. If the teachers are hostile to the mission of the college or indifferent about it, the college will suffer. It does not suffice to hire fac­ulty who are nominally Catholic. If teach­ers are angry with the Church or unsym­pathetic toward her doctrines, no changes in the curriculum will succeed in making the institution truly Catholic." 
The Cardinal stressed that the Catholic 
university "participates ... in the mission of thn universal Church." and that thn teaching authority of tlw Church should be weleomed: "Cardinal Newman ... points out the <tdvantages that tlw guid­ance of thn magistnrium gives for tlw ... university itself. Just as wn turn to pro­fessors to teach us disciplines in which thoy arn nxpnrt. so wn turn to tlw ... Chureh to give seeurn guidancn in mat­ters of religion. For it is to the Church that God has entrusted tho dnposit of faith ... for answering important quos­tions that ... arise in thn human h1mrt. ... Without the helping hand of thn Church. Newman contends, the human mind gravitates toward infidelity .... Tho Catholk ... university ... should gratefully acknowledge tlw men~y of God who has provided an institution that has for two thousand ynars kept thn Christian rnVPla­tion complnte and unsullied. Whatever the latest theories of professors or tlw inclination of students may b(\ the col­lege should not forsake its Catholic alle­giance. While olli'ring its studonts a vast panoply of skills and learning, it gathers up the fragment-; of knowledg(~ undPr the luminous angis of Christian faith, pro­dainwd today as always by the sueeossor of Pet(~r and thn bishops in union with him." 
Mneting the challnngf~s ladng a Catholic university, Cardinal Dulles said, "cannot be thn t<L'ik of the prnsidPnt alone. lie must have baeking from the trustees and cooperation from the faculty and administration." The administration and the ad hoe committee seek to build such cooperation. The proportion of Catholic faculty at Notrn Dame is declin­ing, however, not because suitable candi­dates cannot be found, but because of the obstacle course any seriously Catholic candidate faces in obtaining departmen­tal approval. 
The University mission is subordinated to the contrary will of component depart­ments. The Academic Articles, however, vest the power to appoint faculty in the president himself. The existing processes will produce only marginal and fruitless tinkering. The president has power, in effect, to govern by veto. In support of the mission, he ought to use that power.

Forging a ne-w path of Christian-Muslitn rapprochetnent 
Recently, 138 Muslim scholars and cler­ics from various backgrounds and coun­tries, including the U.S., drafted a letter addressed to all the major Christian reli­gious leaders of the world emphasizing beliefs common to both religions. These central beliefs are the love of God and of one's neighbor -beliefs that immediately resonate with Christians. The Christian leaders addressed included Pope Benedict XVI, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch and evangelical Christian leaders. 
Although the letter did not receive over­whelming attention in the world press, it touched a chord among many Christian interlocutors. Since the letter's circulation, a number of representatives of various Christian denominations, including a spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, have responded gra­ciously, reciprocating the Muslim desire to seek common ground between the two faiths on the basis of shared beliefs and values. This reciprocity signals a potential sea-change in Christian-Muslim relations. 
Never has the time been more propi­tious for seeking a Christian-Muslim rap­prochement and building a solid alliance in confronting religious extremism and the violence it often engenders that so plague our world today. The alternative is grim. Religious rivalries in the past have led to bitter wars and other forms of con­flict, contributing to the perception that the creation of a common ground between Islam and Christianity must remain a pipe dream. 
For those of us who study the historical trajectory of these religions this is any­thing but a pipe dream. Current efforts at seeking a Christian-Muslim rapproche­ment represent a rather belated recogni­tion of the historical fact that the destinies of these two world religions and civiliza­tions have been and continue to remain conjoined. In a seminal work entitled "The Case for Islamo-Christian Civilization," historian Richard Bulliet of Columbia University has remarked that, "[l]ooked at as a whole and in historical perspective, the Islamo-Christian world has much more binding it together than forcing it apart." 

Much of Muslim and Christian history in fact cannot be fully understood in all its dimensions in isolation from the other. While a part of this intertwined history has bequeathed painful memories, part of it continues to inspire hope in the present and into the future. Moving past the jihads and the crusades, we would do well to remember, for instance, that the sharing of learning between Muslim realms and Christendom kept the intellectual legacy of classical antiquity alive in the pre-modern period and contributed to the European Renaissance. Islamic civilization fmds its roots in the Judea-Christian religious tra­dition and Greco-Roman intellectual lega­cy as much as Western civilization does. 
We are at a historic crossroads. The prophets of doom and damnation are plentiful on both sides, overshadowing the less sensational efforts being made by a growing number of Christians and Muslims of good will to build bridges based on shared ethical and moral values. Among such shared values is protection of human life and of the environment as God's custodians on earth, as Archbishop Celestino Migliore, who will visit Notre Dame this week, has stressed. 
We can choose to capitulate to the prophets of doom because they are louder and often have better access to the bully pulpit, or we can choose to succumb to the love of God and of neighbor -as the best of our traditions insist -and chart a better, more hopeful future.

Global poverty, a call for awareness 
Fact: More than one billion people live on less than one dollar each day. Extreme poverty affects over a billion people on our planet. The effects of this hardship reach further than most realize. Poverty causes suffering such as insufficient hous­ing and education, hunger, disease and political unrest. As Notre Dame students, we are given a unique roll in the fight against global poverty and the hardships it creates. 
We have the responsibility to raise awareness, both on our campus and throughout this country. Awareness is the most effective way to promote a solution to extreme poverty and AIDS. The ONE Campaign is an American social movement designed to fight extreme poverty and global dis­ease worldwide. ONE pursues this goal through a campaign of awareness, education and activism on campuses and in communities across our nation. 
Notre Dame students can get involved in the ONE Campaign at Notre Dame by joining the Notre Dame ONE Campaign Facebook group, signing the ONE declaration and beginning to raise awareness on campus by wearing white ONE bands and T­shirts. Together, as ONE, we can demand vital changes in national attitudes toward fair trade, debt relief and international aid. Together, as ONE, we can do our part to make poverty history!

An old-fashioned pep rally 
I would really like to see an old-fashioned pep rally this Friday. As an alumnus, I have been attending pep rallies for several years at the Joyce Center. They seem so script­ed. How about, for Duke, a return to tradition: The band marches the entire campus, students follow along, pep rally at Stepan, only students allowed in. (If the alumni and parents need to see it, tele­vise it to the JACC or onto the side of Grace Hall.) 
There is something about the heat in Stepan, the crush of the crowd, the band storm­ing in from the side, the drums so loud you can't hear anything, including your own cheering, the team up close and personal on the stage. 

Make this Friday about the student body and the team by holding an old-fashioned, motivating pep rally.

CLASSIC BOARD GAMES 
' ', ~ 
By STEPHANIE DePREZ 
Scene Wri[er 
The winter season is fast approaching, and that means two things. 
First, Notre Dame students are gear­ing up for the weather and the long hours spent hanging in the dorm to avoid freezing to death. Second, now begins the frantic search for Christmas gifts. And what better way to deal with both issues than by buying an entertain­ing board game for those long winter nights? 
Many pPople scoff at the idea of board games. Why bother when we have such honorable amenities as Guitar Hero III? The day must come, though, that you do master the expert level of every song, and the glory is over. There's still TV, though, right? Well, as long as studio producers refuse to sit down with the Writers Guild of America, all you're going to see on your Comcast-provided cable for the next few months is "America's Next Top Model." There is a remedy, though, and way to consistently counteract boredom. That would be the great American pastime of gathering your roommates -and whomever is wandering around your section -and playing a board game. 
Here's a look at some of the best hoard games on the market this Christmas: 
Scene It?: Movie Edition (2nd Edition): This is an updated release of the classic from a few years ago. Pop the disc into your DVD player and set up the hoard on your coffee table. Teams com­pete to answer question about movies, but the best part is, for a lot of the ques­tions it doesn't matter if you've seen the movie or not. Whether you are a film bufl' or a casual moviegoer, this game is intensely fun and overly addicting. Other editions include Disney, Harry Potter, 007, Marvel Comics, Sports, Music and TV. 
Scattergories: Each team gets a pad with a list of everything from "musical group" to "vegetable." Roll the die and get a letter. Turn the timer, and each team has to come up with something for each category that begins with that let­ter. But be careful -you only get the point if no other team came up with the same answer. 
Cranium: If you haven't played it 
R 


Board games such as Scattergories can provide indoor winter fun. 
already (or read the back of the box while waiting for your Starhucks hack home), you are missing out. This game appeals to all sides of the brain. Teams move around the board, which is divided into quarters. On one section you act out or hum answers for your teammates. In the others, you draw or mold clay, recall trivia, or solve word puzzles. No matter what your talent is (or what you lack), there's bound to be something here for you. 
Electronic Catch Phrase: Everyone sits in a circle, and you are teammates with every other (alternating) person. Pass the disk around and try to get peo­ple to guess the world it gives you. Pass it fast, because whoever gets stuck hold­ing it when the buzzer goes off is elimi­nated. The team with the last man standing wins. 
Trivial Pursuit: This classic game has been reincarnated so many times that there's bound to be an edition for you. Teams move around the board answer­ing questions in a variety of categories. Tailor-made editions include Lord of the Rings, Star Wars. Chicago, New York, Totally 80s, Pop Culture, Nickelodeon and Book Lovers.

By CAITLIN FERRARO Scene Writer 
The highest rated new comedy of the season, "Samantha Who?" centers on a woman who suffers from retrograde amnesia. The show is definitely worth remembering. 
The premise is simple, yet unoriginal: A girl named Samantha (Christina Applegate) wakes up after an eight-day coma with amnesia, only to discover she was a horrible person. 
The comedy had its own identity issues from its beginning, when due to 
. copyright concerns (from Dr. Seuss' estate) it had to change its name from "Sam I Am" to "Samantha Be Good," before finally settling on "Samantha Who?" 
The Emmy-winning Applegate master­fully portrays the titular character, Samantha Newly. Applegate has not been this good since her 10-year embodiment of trashy Kelly Bundy on "Married ... with Children." This show is her comeback as she shines as a funny, charming and chic leading lady. 
The cast of actors surrounding Applegate is superb as well. After wak­ing up, Sam discovers she has unstable relationships with all those around her. Seasoned comedic actors Jean Smart and Kevin Dunn, who form a dynamic duo, play the parents to whom Sam has not spoken in two years. When Samantha first wakes up, her mother (Smart) is disappointed because it inter­rupts her video entry for "Extreme Home Makeover." The only other two people who go to the hospital are Sam's boyfriend, Todd (the adorable Barry Watson), and Sam's quirky junior high best friend, Dena (Melissa McCarthy of "Gilmore Girls" fame). It turns out Sam is cheating on Todd and ditched Dena in high school to be popular. All this while Sam's supposed best friend, raging alco­holic Andrea (Jennifer Esposito), could not be happier that Sam has forgotten she was a recovering alcoholic herself. Suffice it to say hijinks ensue. 
Everything about this show is so very wrong, yet the train wreck of insane events feel real and are laugh-out-loud hilarious thanks to the talented cast. Esposito could teach Paris Hilton the meaning of narcissism as she tempts Samantha to rejoin her on the dark side. 
Potential quibbles with the show are

Christina Applegate stars in "Samantha Who?," ABC's latest comedy. 
few and far between. From time to time, Samantha has flashes of her former horrible self and she endeavors to make changes in her life. Sometimes these glimpses of Sam's past are not particu­larly comical or necessary. While direc­tors depict evil Sam incurring wrath upon those around her (and often Applegate with a different hairstyle), they do not always directly contribute to the show. 
Following in the thematic pursuit of "My Name is Earl," Samantha aims to turn over a new leaf and be a better person. But "Samantha Who?" has yet to perfect the format. The episodes sometimes seem a bit frantic and can jump around at times. 
Some of Sam's deep philosophical con­versations with Todd's apartment door­man Frank (Tim Russ) border on ridicu­lousness, but most are great fun. In the episode entitled "The Job," Sam con­sults Frank on her outfit. He responds: "Coco Chane! said that to avoid over­accessorizing, women should look in the mirror and remove one thing. With you, it was often your dignity." Ouch. 
The other episodes thus far include Sam pretending she was away in rehab instead of in a coma, crashing a wed­ding in which she had encouraged the bride to have an affair and stressing over forgetting her past sexual experi­ences. Future. episodes promise similar 
insanity as Sam tries to regain her memory by visiting a hyp­notherapist, and she pretends to be an avid hockey fan to impress a date. 
While the show may be still working out a few kinks, Applegate is charmingly endear­ing and Smart constantly finds laughs. In the end, if you are not watching this fall's new No. 1 comedy, you must be having a memory lapse.

that these guys would be able to blend into a system, but emotionally, the energy comes from Kevin." 
Magic 103, SuperSonics 76 

Rashard Lewis wanted to 
show the Seattle SuperSonics 
what they were missing. He 
wished it hadn't come in his 
former team's NBA-leading 
eighth consecutive loss. 

Lewis scored 22 points, 19 in 
the first half, against the fran­
chise that drafted him out of 
high school nine years ago, and 
the Magic won Tuesday night. 

The SuperSonics have not won since April 7 of last sea­son, when Lewis was still on their side and went for 35 points against the Utah Jazz. It is the worst start in franchise history, surpassing an 0-6 streak in 1969-70. 
"I kind of root for some of those guys, especially the way they've started off," Lewis said. "I wanted them to get rolling, at least get a couple of wins under their belt. Like l said, l'm still dose friends with some of the guys on the team, so l wish them the best." 
Two other NBA teams are winless, but Minnesota and Golden State have only played five games. The loss opened a live-game East Coast road trip for Seattle, which will get another chance Wednesday against Miami. 
The Magic improved to 6-2, despite committing 26 turnovers compared with 17 for Seattle. The Magic were aver­aging 13 turnovers, second in the league, but committed 16 in the first half alone. 
Along with Dwight Howard, Lewis rested the fourth quarter. Howard had only one first-half point, but finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds, while Hedo Turkoglu scored 17 points and Trevor Ariza had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Keith Bogans scored 16 points on 5-of-9 3­point shooting to help bust Seattle's zone defense. 
"I had my shot going early in the game and was able to knock down a buneh of 3s, and then Keith got his shot going in the second half," Lewis said. 
Kevin Durant continued to struggle from the field as Seattle shot a season-worst 34 percent. The heralded rookie was 2-for-8 in the first half, getting just four points off a dunk and fast-break layup. He didn't make his first jumper until the third quarter, and fin­ished with 10 points on 4-for­13 shooting. 
''I'm just playing basketball," Durant said. "The spotlight is coming from the media -I try not to get into that. I just want to play basketball and try and get better and help my team get better." 

Bobcats 91, Heat 76 
Minutes after watching the Miami Heat miss shot after shot in another uninspiring per­formance that ended in a loss to the Charlotte Bobcats, coach Pat Riley was asked what he could do to generate some offense. 
"Me? Play. I guarantee you l should suit up. I'd play better than some of them right now," Riley said Tuesday night. "I guarantee it. I swear to God. With an old hip and 62-years­old and I can't see, I'll play bet­ter than some of my guys tonight. Come on, they were pretty bad." 
And it's becoming routine. With Dwyane Wade watching again from the bench, his knee still not ready to play, the Heat fell to 1-6 by managing 12 points in both the first and third quarters in an effort that left Shaquille O'Neal despon­dent. 
"It was very, very embarrass­ing," O'Neal said. 
Behind 19 points from Gerald Wallace and 18 from Jason Richardson, the Bobcats held the Heat to 38 percent shooting in their second win over Miami in 10 days. 
Emeka Okafor added 13 


points and 10 rebounds as the Bobcats ran at every opportuni­ty against the aging Heat, who appeared to have little to give two nights after winning their first game in New York. 
"You grandfather playing time to all your starters or guys that have been in the rotation and you're losing games," said Riley, who suggested a players­only meeting. "Eventually you've got to shave the beard and either look younger or get somebody else in there. You ean't continue like this." 
O'Neal had 17 points and six rebounds, but got little help. While O'Neal shot 7 -of-14, the other four starters combined to shoot 9-for-34. No other play scored more than 10 points as Wade watched from the bench in a tan jacket. 
"We've got to make shots," said Wade, who has yet to play after offseason knne surgery. "One person is not going to save us." 
And with Wade saying hn was unsure if he'd play Wednesday against Seattle, the Heat are searching for ways to turn around their league-worst offense after going 1-of-7 from 3-point range. 
"There have been a few bright moments but we're not coming together consistently," Riley said. 
The Bobcats did, two nights after blowing a fourth-quarter lead in a loss to Houston.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK-C.C. Sabathia beat Josh Beckett 
at last  - albeit  a  few  
weeks  later  than  he  
hoped.  

Sabathia won the AL Cy Young Award on Tuesday. topping Boston's ace and two other worthy con­tenders by a comfortable margin to become the first Cleveland Indians pitcher in 35 years to earn the honor. 
Sabathia received 19 of 28 first-place votes and finished with 119 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Beckett, who outpitched Sabathia twice in the playoffs, was second with eight first-place votes and 86 points. 

"I did look at a few num­bers," Sabathia said on a conference call from his California horne. "I defi­nitely thought that Beckett -it could have went either way. I'm just happy and thankful that it went my way." 
It might have gone the other way if October results counted. Voting took place before the post­season, when Sabathia struggled as Beckett put together a string of domi­nant outings to help Boston win the World Series. 
The Red Sox right-han­der trounced Sabathia two times in the AL charnpi-
IN BRIEF 
Swede hired as U.S. 
women's soccer coach 
Pia Sundhage's immersion into U.S. culture introduced her to Americans' "Go for it" mentality. 
But when it comes to soccer, her fellow Swedes' deliberateness might sometimes work best. the former international star said Tuesday after being hired as the U.S. women's national team coach. 
American officials turned to a for­eign coach for the first time after failing to win this year's World Cup. Sundhage, an assistant for China during the World Cup, is familiar with many of the U.S. players, hav­ing coached in the WUSA during the league's three-year existence. 
She wants her new team to control the ball and dictate tempo more. 
"It's very tight at the top level," Sundhage said. "I think it's about being comfortable with the ball. I don't think it's a big step, but a very important step." 

onship series and went 4-0 with a 1.20 ERA in four postseason starts, striking out 35 and walking two. Sabathia was 1-2 with an 
8.80 ERA and 13 walks in three playoff outings. 
"The first two l can defi­nitely say I was trying to do too much," Sabathia said. "Just trying to make perfect pitches." 
John Lackey of the Los Angeles Angels got the other first-place vote and came in third. Cleveland's Fausto Carmona was fourth. 
Sabathia went 19-7 with a 3.21 ERA and 209 strike­outs, pitching a major league-high 241 innings. Beckett (20-7) became the only big leaguer to win 20 games since 2005, cornpil· ing a 3.27 ERA in 200 2-3 innings. Lackey led the AL in ERA at 3.01, going 19-9 and tossing 224 innings. Carmona was 19-8 with a 
3.06 ERA. 
"I was excited. My family and everybody were around," Sabathia said. "I was surprised. Beckett had a great year and an even better postseason." 
The only other Cleveland pitcher to win the award was Hall of Farner Gaylord Perry in 1972. Now that he's got one of his own, Sabathia plans to display the trophy prominently. 
''I'm sitting in my office right now, I'm looking for a spot. I'll probably put it right here," he said. 

Texas Tech coach fined 
for criticizing officials 
LUBBOCK. Texas-Texas Tech coach Mike Leach was fmed a record $10,000 by the Big 12 Conference on Tuesday for his harsh criticism of game officials following last week's loss to Texas. 
The fine doubled the previous high by the league, levied twice before, against Kansas coach Mark Mangino three years ago and former Kansas State basketball coach Jim Wooldridge during the 2005-06 season. 
Leach was reprimanded and put on notice that "any future such behavior will result in a more serious penalty, including a possible suspension," the conference said in a news release. 
Leach and Texas Tech were not com­menting on the fine, school spokesman Chris Cook said. 
After No. 12 Texas beat Texas Tech 59-43 on Saturday, Leach condemned the officiating crew in Austin, calling their work "a complete travesty." 
PGA to put FedEx Cup after 
Ryder next year 
PONTE VEDRA BEACH. Fla.-The PGA Tour decided to put another cup ahead of its own Tuesday, moving the FedEx Cup finale to the week after the Ryder Cup next year to allow Americans to be fresh as they try to end a decade of losing. 
Without switching around the 2008 schedule, some players might have competed four consecutive weeks in the FedEx Cup, then headed straight to Valhalla Golf Club for the Ryder Cup, regarded as one of the most tiring and pres­sure-packed weeks in golf. 
The changes means there will be a two-week break in the middle of the playoffs, between the BMW Championship in St. Louis and the Tour Championship in Atlanta. And it gives the PGA Tour its first week without golf during the season since 1989.

for this year's worlds in Stuttgart, Germany. They left behind Pang Panpan, a member of the 2006 squad, and Olympic bronze medalist Zhang Nan, and brought some youngsters for international experience and exposure. 
The kids did all right, helping China win the team silver. 
But performing in front of a raucous home crowd will be a completely different experience, Karolyi said. 
"The crowd sometimes plays a tremendous role to give you wings and carry you to victory. At the same time, great teams under the pressure have broken down," he said. "It is something we have to [wait to] see. I can't predict that one." 
Of course, the Americans went to the Athens Olympics as favorites, too, after winning the 2003 world title in Anaheim, Calif. They came home with sil­ver, their finish behind the Romanians something of a dis­appointment.

Add veterans Alicia Sacramone, who has seven medals from the worlds, Memmel and Jana Bieger, and the competition just to get to Beijing is going to be fierce. 
"Martha doesn't like [medal predictions] because she doesn't want to put the bug in their heads and put additional pres­sure on them. I'm much more optimistic," Karolyi said. "I would like to get them used to early with the talk that they are powerful enough and strong enough to win.

es-but he's also had the mis­fortune of working within a system entirely devoid of imag­ination. Baltimore's offense has scored 10 touchdowns this season, only two in the last two games. The Ravens' aver­age of 15.3 points per game is better than only Kansas City, St. Louis, Atlanta and San Francisco, which are a collec­tive 10-26. 
Nearly half of Baltimore's 138 points have been provided by Stover, by far the team's most potent offensive threat.

Billick got the job in 1999 because of his ability to run an offense. Except for last sea­son's 10-game run, the Ravens have won solely on the ability of the defense during his tenure. 
Billick soon may have to adhere to a do-it-or-else sug­gestion from owner Steve Bisciotti to have someone else to call the plays. Billick, in turn, might want to ask for a new quarterback.

Clearly, Baltimore needs to address its offense before the defense gets too old. Lewis, Pryce, McAlister, Holle and defensive tackle Kelly Gregg are all in their 30s. Maybe the Havens can get some help with a high draft pick, although that's not exactly the prefer­ence of defensive end Terrell Suggs. 
"It doesn't feel like rock-bot­tom," Suggs said Sunday. "It depends on what we do from here on out. If we end up with a top 10 pick, then that's rock­bottom. Cut and dried."

NFL 

Jones set to accept plea deal 
Associated Pr~ss 
LAS VECAS -Suspended NFL player Adam "Pacman" .Jones is expeeted to take a plea deal that will get him probation in rnturn for testi­mony about a Las Vegas strip club triple shooting. his lawyer said Tuesday. 
The TennesSIH\ Titans r,or­nerbaek intends to plead no contest to one charge of con­spiracy to commit disorderly conduct, a gross misde­meanor, in roturn for a promise to suspend a sen­tence of one year in county jail, according to a written plea agrnement obtainml by The Associated Press. 
"We haVI\ a deal," Clark County prosecutor Victoria Villegas said. "I can't talk about the negotiations until it's actually filed with the court." 
.Jones' attorney, Hobert Langford. was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to inform l.as Vegas .Justice of tlw Peace Tony Abbatangelo of the plea, but tlw !waring abruptly was rescheduled for Thursday. 
Villngas said llw delayed !waring was tho rnsult of a scheduling mishap. 
"lie has agreed to ll\stify in whatever hearings come up regarding the shooter," Langford said . .Jones. who was not expected to attend Tuesday's hearing, would not be senteru:ed until after testifying. he said. 

Manny Arora, .Jones' AtIan ta-based attorney, said their focus was to clear the cornerback of involvement in the shooting and called the deal the best situation for .Iones. 
"While I think we would've been suecessful at trial, it could've been six months to a year away, and he may have lost another year of eli­gibility by going forward. In the real world, sometimes you have to make these diiTi­eult deeisions for what's best for your earner. and we did­n't want this dragging on any further," Arora said. 
In addition to one year of probation, .Jones must attend an anger manage­ment pro­gram, com­plnte 200

"I can't comment because that's an ongoing police investigation," Langford told the AP. 
Langford said, however, that Jones did not know the identity of a man whose photo was released in June by poliee. Investigators said they wanted to question that man in the shooting. The photo was obtained from surveillance cameras, and police said they thought the man lived on the East Coast. 
Police have not charged anyone with the shooting, which left three people wounded. including a bar employee, Tommy Urbanski, who was paralyzed from the waist down.

Fortner friend testifies against O.J. Sitnpson 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS-O.J. Simpson's one-time golfing pal glared at him across a courtroom Tuesday and said the former football star wanted him to bring "heat" to a confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers in a hotel room. 
Minutes later, Simpson's lawyer accused the friend, Walter Alexander, of being a liar, and the two wound up in a heated exchange in the third day of a preliminary hearing in the armed robbery case. 
Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure will decide after the hearing whether there is enough evidence for Simpson and guns or asked anyone to bring them to the hotel room. Wearing dark glasses and a dark suit with a white shirt and white handkerchief in the breast pocket, he sometimes smiled but frequently shook his head as Alexander testified. 
Simpson has said he intend­ed only to retrieve items that were stolen from him by a for­mer agent. including the suit he wore thn day he was aequit­ted of murder in 1995 in the slayings of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Honald Goldman.

Sullivan to miss Saturday's game 
Fifth-year senior center .John Sullivan will miss Saturday's game because of the undisclosed injury that forced him out of the Air Force game. 
Sullivan has been aiding freshman quarterback .Jimmy Clausen with pre­snap reads, including iden­tifying the middle line­backer. Weis said that duty will fall on back-up center Dan Wenger this week but that Clausen is almost able to do it on his own. 
"We'll start with Danny, see how it goes, and if it isn't going too well, we'll put the burden on the quar­terback," Weis said. "We'd like to, as it goes into this offseason, put all the bur­den on the quarterback." 
Weis said Sullivan will help Wenger and Clausen with the reads in practice. 
"We'll give him a con­structive role this week where he won't just feel like he's pushed off to the side," Weis said. "lle'll almost be like an extra assistant coach out there, which that will help us, too. this week." 
Wenger has played both guard and center this sea­son, hut Weis said the soph­omore is more suited to the role of center. 
"Danny is a much more natural center than guard." he said. "lie's more com­fortable in there. That's where he played his whole 

high school career, and although we'll greatly miss Sully and all he's done on and off the field for us, hav­ing a guy like that who is a natural center in there. I think this gets him into his natural position rather than being knocked over at the guard." 
Weis said he is hopeful Sullivan will be able to return fur the season finale against Stanford, but the coach doesn't want to rush him back and hurt his chances in the NFL. 
"You're always concerned about something happening which would cost you a little time," Weis said. 
Vaas returns to Notre Dame Stadium 
Peter Vaas, who was Notre Dame's quarterbacks coach during Weis' first two sea­sons in South Bend, will return this weekend as Duke's offensive coordina­tor. 
Weis said the fact that Vaas knows the Irish offense is "a pain in the butt," but that Vaas won't be able to steal any Notre Dame sig­nals. 
"The only signaling we really do offensively is sig­naling numbers," Weis said. "So unless you have the number sheet and know what we're doing, that would be the only way that it could really hurt you." 
Other injuries 
Weis said junior nose guard Pat Kuntz and sopho­more safety Sergio Brown will not play against the Blue Devils, while freshman tight end Mike Ragone and fifth -year senior punter Geoff Price are unlikely to play because of injuries.

As seniors. both playors are floor generals for the Irish. Tarutis, the team's setter, is a natural leader while Stasiuk has benn hon­ored as the team's captain. 
In four years, Tarutis and Stasiuk have helped produce a record of 90-39. But the fate of this season may hinge on their play this weekend in the Big East Tournament in Milwaukee. The Irish will open against Cincinnati on Friday at 11 
a.m. If the seniors can lead their team to a champi­onship, they will find them­selves in their fourth NCAA Tournament in four years. 
"I hope this season ends with our team doing our very best and surprising the favored teams we play both in the Big East tourney and in the NCAAs," Stasiuk said. "I love being the underdog." 
But with the end of the season nearing, life after graduation also beckons for Stasiuk and Tarutis. For Stasiuk. that may not mean an end to her volleyball career.

Stasiuk currently has career totals of 428 games played, 228 assists, 273 blocks and 1,537 points, which amounts to 3.59 scores per game. She is in the top 10 in the Notre Dame career record books in many categories.

game. McGraw said, one of Notre Dame's goals was to lake charges against Lady Toppers forwards Dominique Duek and Crystal Kelly in order to try to gel them in foul trouble. Gaines took two eharges in two minutes against Duck to put the jun­ior in narly foul trouble. 
McGraw said getting Kentucky's top players in foul trouble was important. 
"Wn had a lot of things we were looking at, and all of them looked pretty good at praeliec," she said. "But my favorite was when [Kelly! was on the bench." 
Kelly had one of the worst games of her career Tuesday, shooting 1-of-7 from beyond the arc with seven points and four boards before fouling out. Thn performanee snapped the senior's 49­game streak of scoring in doublf~ figurns. Kelly finished tlw game without a two-point field goal for the first time in her carenr at Western Kentucky. 
"I don't know if that's evnr happerwd. llopefully it will never happnn again," KHlly said.

"I just go out there and play my game," she said. "Whatever Coach wants me to do, that's what I'm going to go out there and do." 
Western Kentucky was unable to keep up with the Irish in the first half and fell behind 50-23 going into the break. Notre Dame was able to push the score up by using effective fast-break offense throughout the opening half. 
"I thought we could have turned the shot clocks off." MeGraw said. "I thought there was a lot of running going on; it was quite a track meet. I was glad we had a lot of depth." 
Even though Notre Dame was able to dominate the first half, Western Kentueky shrank the Irish lead in the second by outscoring the Irish 36-2R. 
"I thought we got a big lead and we got complacent. You get up thirty and you feel like 'We're going to win, let's just let the clock run,"' MeGraw said. "So I was a little disap­pointed with our execution and our defense in the see­ond half." 
Lady Toppers coaeh Mary Taylor Cowles said she thought her team stepped up its game in the seeond half to eut down the lead. 
"If we could have put two halves together defensively, then it might have been a dif­fen~nt story," Cowles said.

Blueline 
continued from page 24 
Notre Dame's defense, the staple of its success last season, was a huge question mark for the team coming into this fall. 
The young group of bluelin­ers is led by its only two sen­iors, Brock Sheahan and Dan VeNard. VeNard saw limited ice time last season due to injuries that plagued him early in the year. Last season, the team graduated three defensemen, two of whom signed profession­al contracts shortly after their college careers ended. 
The Irish have had to regroup with a corps of younger, albeit talented defensemen. Freshmen Ted Ruth and Ian Cole were thrown into the mix immediately, and so far, both have answered the call as well as could be imagined. They are joined by sophomores Brett Blatchford and Kyle Lawson, who have already stepped into leadership roles and are build­ing a bright future for a back line that has become a trade­mark for Jeff Jackson in South Bend. 
!\big part of Notre Dame's suceess on the defensive end has been the goaltending of junior Jordan Pearce, who had a combined 64 saves against Davis and the rest of the HedHawks over the weekend. The Anehorage, Alaska native has been the most pleasant surprise of the year so far for the Irish. Pearee was expeeted to battle highly touted fresh­man Brad Phillips for time early in the season, but quiekly took over the role as the No. 1 netminder. Pearce is currently second in the country in min­utes played and has suecessful­ly replaced Dave Brown between the pipes.

Change will inspire and exhilarate you. 4 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You've got the added discipline needed to get things done. Talk to people in the know and you will get the answers required. A serious look at something that someone else presents may lead you in a new di­rection. 3 stars GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You will tend to change your nilnd a Jot, confusing the people with whom you talk about work, money and finances. It may be that you don't want anyone judging you for the purchases or choices you make. Face your responsibilities. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-July 22): Say what's on your nrind. You may feel emotional about a lot of different things going on in your life today but, keeping your thoughts locked up will not solve your prob!tnns. Deal with each issue as it arises. 3 stars LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Help the people who count most--the ones you live with or hold close to your heart. This is a perfect time to sign or negotiate a con­tract that is of a personal nature. A decision you make will help you achieve greater stability in your life. 3 stars VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): You've got plenty to think about today but, ifyou let your emotions take over, you may find yourself in the center of a sticky situa­tion. Changing your mind or getting involved in something you know little about will lead to criticism. 2 stars LffiRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): By taking a creative approach to something you want to do, you will stir up a lot of interest. You should be able to get both the pros and cons thrown at you by those who can help you make it to the next leveL Openness will be your ticket to success. 5 stars SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't be too quick to invest in something that ounds good but that you know little about. Stick to what you know and do best. Impulsive purchases will lead to financial arguments with the people you are in­volved with. 3 stars SAGITTARIUS {Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Don't spend on love, trying to attract some­one who isn't likely to be impressed with your financial irresponsibility. Put your money into something that helps you get ahead. You may be charming but, with­out closing deals or saving, you will not get ahead. 3 stars CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Stage meetings or get involved in a convention or tradeshow that will honor something that you want to learn more about. You can increase your income ifyou aren't impulsive. Financial security will be yours if you are cautious. 3 stars AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Everything is turning in your favor today but don't take advantage of others. Now is not the time to push everyone to do things your way. Back off and let people come to you. 5 stars PISCES (Feb. 19-Marcb 20): You will tend to be unreasonable when it comes to emotional matters. Take a step back and fully understand your position and the position of those who oppose you. Don't make a final decision thoughtlessly. 2 stars

Irish take down Western Kentucky in NIT second round 
By JAY FITZPATRICK A'snciate Sports Editor 

With 15:06 IHft in the first half. Irish point guard Tulyah Gaines sank a long two-point jurnpshot to give NotrH Dame a 12-3 lead -one it did not relinquish Tuesday as it coast­ed to a 78-59 win over Westnrn Kentucky in the sec­ond round of the preseason women's NIT. 
"J think with a veteran group you really expect to !get a quick lead!," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I think when you come out you're just curious to see who's going to be the one today that's going to get us started." 
Gaines was a dominant pres­ence on both ends of the court in the first half. The senior point guard had six points, five assists, three rebounds and no turnovers in 30 min­utes. 
"I though Tulyah played really well. She had a great floor game.... I just thought she was outstanding as a leader tonight," McGraw said. 
Gaines was also a crucial part of the Irish defensive ganwplan. Going into the

Seniors look back on careers 
Stasiuk, Tarutis lead squad into Big East tourney against Cincy 
By PAT O'BRIEN and ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writers 
Senior captain Adrianna Stasiuk and senior setter Ashley Tarutis have played together for four years, started most of Notre Dame's matches, and posted superb statistics while pro­viding the spark and heart for the Irish. 
The two players may have come from different parts of the U.S. -Stasiuk is from Park Ridge, Ill., while Tarutis hails from Long Beach, Calif. -but both had the same reason for coming to Notre Dame. 
"I chose NO because it had the best combination of aca­demics and strong athlet­ics," Stasiuk said. "An NO degree will get you set for life." 
Notre Dame "is such a great combination of aca­demics and athletics,"

HOCKEY ANALYSIS 
Irish defense leads the way 
By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports Editor 
Notre I>anw 's 27 -6-:{ reeord 

last. season was no fluke. 
This year's tnam, which is now 7-4, provml that over the weekend when, for the second year in a row, it knocked out the nation's bnst team. 
In 2006, tlw Irish slaugh­tered Boston College 7-1 in Boston; this year they split a weekend series with No.1 Miami (011). Going into the weekend, the well-oiled Hedllawks looked as close to unbeatable as possible. The veteran squad reeled ofT blowout after blowout victory to bring a perfect 7-0 record into its contest with the Irish. 
So far this season, th1~ Hndllawks have been led by an offense that averages more than live goals every time they lace up their skates. In two gamns against the Irish they rnanagml to squeeze in a com­binml total of four-and that was with Miami returning its Jnading scorer from last year, Nathan Davis. Arguably the most dangerous player in the wuntry this year, Davis was held to one goal on the week­end.

Weis uses seniors to motivate squad 
Coach urges Irish to beat Duke for the upperclassmen 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 

When a team is 1-9, it's hard to find motivation. 
That is why Notre Drrme coach Charlie Weis is calling on his team to "win one for the seniors" Saturday against Duke in the season's final home game. 
"As far as the underdassmen go, I think that they have to put any selfishness aside," Weis said. "This isn't a game you worry about for those guys, worrying about next year. It's sending !the seniors) out the right way." 
Weis said when he first came to Notre Dame, he didn't realize how emotional senior days would be for departing players. It only sunk in during Notre Dame's final home game of Weis' first year as coach, against Syracuse in 2005. 
"1 know offensively it took us over a half just to really get anything going at all because there was a lot of guys that are going through what's happmwd in their careers over the last four or live years," Weis said of that game. "It's something that you have to try to keep them grounded." 
Most of tho time, Weis said, he tries to keep his team on an even keel, trying not to make any game more important than the others. But he also aims to have a new motivational mes­sage for each game, and senti­mentality is the easy choice for this week. 

"I think that each week you try to have a message for that game, so I think it actually plays right into that, our way of looking at it one week at a time," he said. "That happens to be the message for this game right here." 
Even though his team is basi­cally playing for next season at this point, Weis said, he would not bench any of his starting seniors. 
"Let me take, for instance, John Carlson. I'm not going to take John Carlson and say, 'OK, your career is over now,"' Weis
