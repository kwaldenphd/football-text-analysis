Students taken to jail before game 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Two Notre Dame students were arrested and taken into custody Saturday after 11eeing from police during a bust at Turtle Creek Apartments, and a third student was arrested and taknn into custody after an incident in Blue Lot South. 
The joint task force of Indiana State Excise Police, St. Joseph County Police. South Bnnd Police and Notre Dame Security/Police issued a total of 2(> citations on and off campus before the football game against Washington, NDSP director Hex Hakow said. 
Excise Police said sophomore Christopher McEntee, 19. and sophomore Eric Better, 19, an Observer writer and production editor. were arrested at 11:20 
a.m. at a tailgate party in Turtle Creek. 
Lt. Greg Deitchley, spokesman for the District 1 excise office, said officers approached the party after noticing its noise level escalat­ing out of control, including students yelling obscenities in slurred speech. 
"We didn't go there with the intention of arresting anybody," he said. 
But as police approached, McEntee and Retter took off running in opposite directions, and officers pursued McEntee through the apartment and down Vaness Street until he stopped near Ivy Road, Deitchley said.

Group approves off-campus safety as BOT report topic 

Chief of staff Dave Baron, student body vice president Karla Bell and president Adam Istvan review proposals at a meeting Monday. 
SafeBus, NDSP proposals to be heard by trustees next week 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 
Student body president Adam Istvan presented his report topic for next week's Board of Trustees meeting for Student Senate approval at Wednesday's meeting. 
Istvan said his general focus would be off-campus safety, in reference both to students who live in the South Bend commu­nity and students ':"ho leave campus for entertainment or other reasons. 
The NO SafeBus initiative dis­cussed at past Council of Representatives and Senate meetings will play a significant role in the report, Istvan said. 

"We've heard that 80 percent of students live on campus, but what we don't hear is that 57 percent of the senior class live off. so eventually over half of Notre Dame students will live off campus," Istvan said. "This is an indication that we need to make off-campus safety a pri­ority." 
Chief executive assistant Dave Baron explained the scope of the report in further detail, saying it will also inte­grate ideas for safety seminars for off-campus students, a pro­posal for members of off-cam­pus council to sit on neighbor­hood group boards and a request for Notre Dame Security/Police to make off­campus security an additional priority. 
"Fo'r NDSP, policing ends on campus, but security doesn't," Baron said. "Students living in South Bend still fall under the guidelines of DuLac, so they should be secured by NDSP as

Debating DaVinci 
This election year, political discourse in our country is more polarized than ever. 
Negative ads and attacks on charac­ter have replaced logical analysis and thoughtful discus­

sion about our Claire Kelley country's future. As political dis­cussions take Photo Editor place on campus. dialogue has also taken place concerning the other sub­ject you aren't supposed to talk about in polite company: religion. On Saturday I attended a faculty panel entitled '"The DaVinci Code': An Assessment" that explored the literary, art historical and theological implica­tions of Dan Brown's best-selling novel that dropped to No. 2 this week after 77 weeks as No. 1. Professor Hichard McBrien, a polar­izing figure himself, theologically examined the hotly debated book and asserted that there is no evidence to support the novel's premise that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. llowever. he said that if Jesus was married it was obviously to Magdalene. lie praised Mary Magdalene as a saint whose impor­tance has been historically understat­ed. Tlwse arn controversial words. con­sidering that "The DaVinci Code'"s overwhelming success has drawn out­rage from some Catholics who believe it is heretical. anti-Catholic and absurd. But the novel has also won praisc from other Catholics who have mnbracPd cathartic discussions of "Tiw l>aVind Code" as a way to con­front deep-rootnd concerns about the rigid stancos of tho Church hierarchy and its anti-feminist reputation, which has been intensified by the recent Vatican letter on feminism. Although "The DaVinci Code"'s claims to veracity have been widely disprovcd by both art historians and theological scholars, important themes are raised through its fiction thriller package. Those who stood to ask questions at the panel on Saturday semned to appreciate the opportunity to discuss those themes. To my sur­prisn, no one who attended the lecture refuted Father McBrien's analysis of the novel. 1\s a student in Father McBrien's Catholicism class my sophomore year, I thought his willingness to discuss and explain both sides of the most controversial issues was wonderfully therapeutic after years of authoritative and rigid Catholic religion classes. I am inspired in those moments at Notre Dame when there is discussion about Catholic issues that is not about who is right or wrong, who belongs and who doesn't, and I can ask ques­tions and challenge the way things are in the Church without being consid­emd unfaithful or disloyal to my faith. Let us not be discouraged by polariz­ing issues or societal restrictions toward certain political or religious dialogue. I believe that our dignity is honored in dialogue where we can talk in an open and honest way about the tremendous mysterious of life, faith and sexuality. These discussions can eclipse those times, even at Notre Dame, where I have become burdened by conversations that emphasize rules or rigid answers. During the question and answer portion of Saturday's lecture one woman stood and remarked, "I have had the best conversations of my life about this book." Another man merely stated, "Isn't this wonderful that we can have these discussions at Notre Dame."

Foran supports corporate culture 
Pfizer governance vice president speaks 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 
Double Domer Peggy Foran, now viee president for corporate governance and corporate secn~­tary of Pfizer. deliven~d the third lectum in the Cardinal 0'1 lara lec­ture series in business ethics Wednesday. Foran earned under­graduate and law degrees at Notre Dame. 
She began by highlighting some of the recognition Pfizer has received for iL<; strides in account­ability. 
"Corporate governance," she said. "is the structure and process that links the actions of the board of directors, management and shareholders.... 
Pfizer has been an innovator in the realm of corporate gover­nance for more than a decade, she said. 
After providing a profile of Pfizer. focusing on its role as a truly global corporation as well as the largest research-oriented pharmaceutical producer in the world, Foran said it was the com­pany's early interest in corporate governance that propelled it to the foreground in the area. 
"One of the reasons we're a leader is that we got involved with corporate governance before any­one knew what it was," she said. 
Foran also touched on the high­profile scandals at Enron and WorldCom, and the government's response in the form of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Act provides standards of gover­nance to which companies must hold themselves accountable, she said. 
When asked how the corporate community has responded to Sarbanes-Oxley, Foran said it has truly made business leaders think. 
"People are taking [corporate governance] much more serious­ly," she said, "but there is a cost associated with that." 
She pointed out that many high­level managers at corporations nationwide dislike the Act's impli­cations, but said that both she and Pfizer support its aims overall. 
Foran went on to explain how, in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley, Pfizer is keeping itself in compli­ance. She stressed the importance of independent, individually accountable directors. 
"When you have independent directors . . . who can truly repre­sent shareholders, that's when you'll see good decisions made," she said. 
Foran also emphasized the "tone at the top," saying that 
because employees tend to look to management to set an example, it is vital for corporations to hold their managers to high ethical standards. Finally, she noted that shareholders' opinions must always be taken into account. 
Near the end of the lecture, Foran said Pfizer's continued suc­cess in corporate governance rests in the maintenance of a positive corporate culture, including well­documented, ethically sound prac­tices in management and account­ing, as well as concern for the environment and the plight of the sick worldwide. After speaking of the company's ongoing focus in the area, she pointed out that Pfizer and its competitors will have to maintain accountability to prosper in the future. 
"I think it has to do with research and innovation," she said. "We're a pharmaceutical company ... we have an obligation to be very transparent."

The training program began several years ago and has changed somewhat over time. 
"We invited campus rep­resentatives from various departments [to speak this fall]." Willerton said.

"They may not recognize that they're the face of Notre Dame," he said. "[But] this is our front line

In contrast to some other departments, Ewing noted that the demand for diversi­ty training in human resources has increased and decreased over the years, probably due to staff turnover, she said. 
"It's cyclical," she said. "It becomes a real concern for organizations and then it fades away and then it becomes important."

Father identifies daughter's body 
BOGOTA. Colombia -Daniela Vanegas, a bright-eyed girl with thick, dark tresses, was kidnapped almost a year ago as she boarded her school bus in Bogota. 
On Wednesday, her father, Miguel Angel Vanegas, was summoned to the city morgue. Authorities suspected a body that had been discovered stuffed into a large plastic bag in a poor Bogota neighborhood was hers, but they needed a positive identification from the father. 
Vanegas, making a trip that is every father's nightmare, entered the morgue. The body, which had been stabbed, was indeed Daniela's. 
Vanegas. a middle-class businessman, learned the dreadful fate that had befallen his daughter after months of pleading over the phone with kidnappers who had set an impossibly high ransom demand: $1.9 mil­lion. 

Palestinian rocket hits Israeli city 
SDEROT, Israel -A Palestinian rocket slammed into a street in this southern Israeli town Wednesday, killing two pre­school children playing in a yard as Israelis ushered in the fall harvest festival of Sukkot. 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon phoned Sderot Mayor Eli Moyal and told him that "Israel will respond" to the attack, a govern­ment official said. 
The rocket attack came in defiance of a major Israeli raid into the nearby Gaza Strip aimed at rooting out militants behind an unending wave of rocket attacks in recent weeks. The raid, which began late Tuesday, killed four Palestinians and wounded 46 others, Palestinian hospital officials said.

Bush never disciplined in Guard 
WASHINGTON -President Bush never was 
disciplined while serving in the Texas Air National Guard, never failed a physical and never asked his father or family friends for help to get him into the guard during the Vietnam War, the White House said Wednesday. 
The White House answers came in response to a dozen questions submitted by The Associated Press in light of new records detail­ing Bush's Guard service and allegations that have surfaced this election season. 
The Texas Air National Guard stripped Bush of his pilot status in August 1972 for failing to take the annual medical exam required of all pilots. Former Air National Guard officials say it was rare for a pilot to skip his physical exam. 
Army meets recruiting goals 
WASHINGTON -Overcoming the recruiting turnoff of a mounting U.S. casualty toll in Iraq, the Army met most of its enlistment goals for the 2004 recruiting year. officials said Wednesday. 
It expects a harder time reaching its goals in 2005, however, in part because it begins the recruiting cycle with a smaller-then-usual pool of "delayed entry" recruits -people who enlist but wait until the following year to report for duty. 
Many who signed up in 2004 and might oth­erwise have delayed their entry until 2005 were instead shipped off to boot camp this year.

Death for two USS Colebombers 
Yemeni judge hands down sentences against six men involved in terrorist attack 
Associated Press 
SAN'A, Yemen -A Saudi suspected of being an associate of Osama bin Laden and a Yemeni mili­tant were sentenced to death by firing squad Wednesday for the bomb­ing of the USS Cole four years ago, the first convic­tions in the al-Qaida terror attack that killed 17 American sailors. 
The judge ordered four other Yemenis jailed for five to 10 years. 
With army snipers on nearby rooftops and armored vehicles and sol­diers surrounding the courthouse, Judge Najib al-Qaderi handed down guilty verdicts in an often­delayed trial that saw the five defendants in Yemen's custody refuse to enter pleas, claiming U.S. inter­ference in the case. 
The judge ordered Jamal al-Badawi, a 35-year-old Yemeni, and Saudi-born Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who is in U.S. custody at an undisclosed location, executed for plotting the attack by two suicide bombers who blew up an explosives-laden boat next to the Cole as it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden on Oct. 12, 2000. 
In reading the verdict, the judge pointed to the prosecution's statement that Badawi arid al-Nashiri bought the speedboat the bombers rammed into the Cole. 
"This verdict is an American one and unjust," al-Badawi yelled from behind the bars of a court­room cell after al-Qaderi sentenced him to death. "There are no human rights in the world, except for the Americans. All the Muslims in the world are being used to serve American interests." 
Al-Nashiri, who is believed to have master­minded the Cole attack and also thought to have directed the 1998 bomb­ings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was the only defendant not present during the trial. 

It was not clear how the verdict would affect al­Nashiri's detention. Four American officials attend­ed the sentencing, but refused to comment on the trial. U.S. Embassy offi. cials in Yemen, reached by The Associated Press, also declined immediate com­ment. 
The United States announced al-Nashiri's arrest in 2002. He was detained in the United Arab Emirates and trans­ferred to American cus­tody. U.S. officials believe he is a close associate of Saudi-born bin Laden. 
Al-Nashiri's lawyer, Mohammed al-Ezzani, accused the court of not 

using any of the evidence he presented to argue his client's innocence. "There are no documents by which the court can justify its death sentence," al­Ezzani told AP. 
Mohammed al-Badawi, brother of the Yemeni con­demned to death, denounced the verdict and told AP his brother and the four other Yemenis con­victed Wednesday would appeal their sentences. 
Al-Badawi's father, also named Mohammed, urged Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to overturn the decision, which he claimed was made "under heavy American pres­sure." 
"It is a ready-made ver­dict and we will appeal," the father said. 

The six men were all charged with belonging to al-Qaida and playing vari­ous roles in the suicide attack on the Cole, which was carried out by two 
Yemenis,  Ibrahim  al­ 
Thawr and  Hasaan  al­ 
Khamri.  

"The evidence obtained by the court affirms the collaboration of the defen­dants in the case ... which harmed the country, its reputation and threatened its social stability and security," the judge said before issuing his sen­tences. 
Al-Qaderi sentenced Fahd al-Qasa to 10 years in prison for filming the bombing, which ripped a huge hole in the destroyer.

In closing, Trbovich encour­aged all those in attendance to exercise their ability to vote.

IN BRIEF 
Jobs cut at Dallas Morning News 
DALLAS -Media owner Belo Corp. said Wednesday that it would cut 250 jobs, more than half of them at its flagship newspaper, The Dallas Morning News, and that an internal investigation into circulation overstatements showed the projected circulation decline at the newspaper would be slightly steeper than fore­cast last month. 
Belo said the layoffs, amounting to 3 percent of its total work force, were prompted by flat revenue since 2001 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where it also owns a television station. the layoffs are expected by Nov. 1. 
Dallas-based Belo said The Morning News' cir­culation would fall 11.9 percent on Sundays and 
5.1 percent on other days for the six months ended Sept. 30 compared to a year earlier. The company had said last month the declines would be 11.5 percent on Sundays and 5 percent other days. 
Belo said most of the decline is believed relat­ed to overstatements stemming from a sales­incentive program that began in early 1999 and has since been stopped. · 
It said Wednesday that an investigation by Belo executives and outside attorneys found no evidence of wrongdoing by current senior exec­utives of the newspaper or the parent company. The vice president of circulation left the news­paper last month. 
Health benefits reviewed in fall 
NEW YORK -With the arrival of fall, many companies flood employee mail boxes with brochures about next year's benefit program offerings, reminding workers that this is the time to select new health insurance and retire­ment savings options. 
It can be confusing, especially when it comes to choosing from a variety of health care plans that can range from health management organi­zations to indemnity insurance. And workers often are asked to review their 401(k) retire­ment account contribution levels. 
While people who work with small companies often have few choices, those at large firms may have dozens of alternatives, said Dallas L. Salisbury, chief executive of the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute. 

U.S. crude inventories grow 
Prices fall as supplies build despite Hurricane Ivan, natural gas futures surge 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Oil prices fell Wednesday after government data showed U.S. inventories of crude grew last week, sur­prising many traders and analysts who had expect­ed supplies to shrink due to lingering output prob­lems caused by Hurricane Ivan. 
Contributing to the drop in prices was word of a tentative agreement between the Nigerian gov­ernment and the leader of a militia group that had threatened to target for­eign oil firms and their workers. · 
Light sweet crude for November delivery fell 39 cents to settle at $49.51 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising above $50 a barrel Tuesday. 
Meantime, the price of natural gas futures surged, rising by nearly 7 percent in a runup that traders said was driven more by technical factors than supply-demand fun­damentals. Natural gas for November delivery rose 56 cents to settle at $6.911 per 1,000 cubic feet.

cuff him and he [cooperated!," Dcitchley said, adding that no force was required in the inci­dent. McEntee was arrested for resisting law enforcement by flight and minor in con­sumption. 
As Hetter tried to leave the 
scene, an officer reached for 
him. but he slipped out of the 
officer's grasp, Deitchley said. 
The officer then caught up 
with Hetter between two cars 
and a physical struggle 
ensued. 
"They were grappling back and forth," Oeitchley said, with the officer eventually using a head control technique to take Retter to the ground and put him in handcuffs. A . fake ID was found in Hetter's possession afterward, Deitchley said. 
Hetter was arrested for resisting law enforcement by 11ight, minor in consumption, public intoxication and posses­sion of false identification. 
Both McEntee and Better declined to comment.  Sophomore Nicholas Maurice, 18, was arrested at 
1:10 p.m. at a tailgate in Blue Lot South. Deitchley said he personally approached the student after seeing him set down a bottle of beer, but Maurice took a "posturing," or defiant, stance. 
"I told him not to do that, to come over for a ticket," Deitchley said. "lie began pos­turing again, so I put him in handcuffs." 
Maurice hesitated to put his hands behind his back. but did not resist. Deitchley said. The Observer was unable to reach Maurice for comment. 
All three arrested students were transported to the jail and were released at different times Saturday afternoon, depending on posted bail and blood alcohol content, said Keith Hininger, director of inmate services. 
"We can't legally let anyone go intoxicated," he said. 
While Rininger said specific 
bail information for the three 
students was unavailable, he 
said $100 to $250 constitutes 
the standard range for their 
charges. 
Excise officer Christopher Bard said resisting law enforcement by flight is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and/or up to a $5,000 fine. Public intoxi­cation is a class B misde­meanor, punishable by up to 180 days in jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine. Minor in con­sumption and minor in posses­sion are both class C misde­meanors, punishable by up to 60 days in jail and/or up to a $500 fine. Possession of false identification is a class C infraction, punishable by up to a $500 fine and no jail time. It is up to the judgment of the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office whether to compound penalties for people who incur multiple violations at once, Bard said. 
Though the prosecutor received the charges Monday, the students have yet to be formally charged, office repre­sentative Tracy Becker said. llowever, this time lag is typi­cal and charges likely will be liled next week. she said. 
In addition to raucous off­campus pregame parties, offi­cers are drawn to on-campus tailgates with certain charac­teristics, Hakow said. 
Tailgates that are very large, that involve shotgunning or drinking games, that have no food and huge amounts of alcohol or spill over into oth­ers' space raise warning flags, Rakow said. The task force distributed fliers detailing these concerns to tailgaters in the lots surrounding Legends, a recent problem area, on Saturday. 
"Legends had been kind of building over the last year or more -it got to the point where we had to address it," Hakow said. "This is one thing you don't get your arms around all at once."

Judge blocks secret search la-w 
ACLU declares ruling a 'landmark victory' 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE. Alaska -A Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered the state to rewrite, reprint and redistribute all of its ballots for the Nov. 2 elec­tion. saying the wording of a ballot initiative was inaccurate and biased. 
Elections officials said that they could comply with the order, but that it would take 15 days and cost nearly $300,000. · 
The ballot initiative concerns how the state fills its U.S. Senate vacancies. 
Currently, the governor can appoint a replacement to a vacant Senate seat. The initiative would abolish appointments and require a special election in all cases except when the vacancy occurs

The four-sentence summary on the ballot wrongly estimates how long a Senate seat would be vacant under the initiative, Judge Moorage Christen wrote in her order. The summary also says the measure would leave Alaska with­out full representation in the Senate, wording which is not impartial, she said. 
"Emphasizing one consequence to the exdusion of others is imper­missible advocacy," Christen wrote.

Prisoner charged with federal botnbing plot 
Inmate planned Milwaukee blast 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -A man in prison on drug offenses was charged Wednesday with threat­ening to blow up a federal build­ing in downtown Milwaukee with a delivery truck filled with explosives. 
Steven J. Parr, 39, was charged the same day he was to be sent to a halfway house in Janesville. 
U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic said Parr expressed hatred for the federal government and spoke about retaliating against law enforcement when he got out of prison. 
"We consider him extremely dangerous," he said. 
It was unclear when Parr planned to take action. or if he had the materials and resources to carry out such an attack. 
Parr allegedly planned to blow up the Reuss Federal Plaza. a 14-story blue building that hous­es more than 800 federal employees and multiple agen­cies. including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Defense. 
Parr's cellmate alerted federal authorities in two letters dated Aug. 23, a criminal complaint said. The cellmate. whose name was withheld. said that Parr has extensive knowledge in bomb­making and considers

Unabomber Ted Kaczynski one of his heroes, the complaint said. 
He also said Parr considered himself a "separatist" and often talked about Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, the complaint said. 
The cellmate said Parr picked the Reuss Federal Plaza because of its proximity to the street and the amount of glass in the build­ing to make a big impact. The letter also said Parr owned "The Anarchist Cookbook" and a notebook with chemical formu­las for bombs. 
A partial transcript of a secretly taped conversation between Parr and his cellmate quoted Parr as saying the inci­dent would "sure change the attitude of the country" and "make a wonderful statement." 
Two women who had lived with Parr told FBI agents his hobby was bomb-making and he had made explosive devices in the garage or in his home. 
Parr was serving a two-year drug sentence. Prior to his arrest Wednesday, he was scheduled to spend 90 days in the halfway house before being released under extended super­vision. the complaint said. 
The charge carries a maxi­mum penalty of life in prison. 




Indiana utility violates air laws 
Four coal-fired power plants cited for pollution 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -An Indiana public utility was told Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency that it has violated air pollution laws at four coal­fired power plants. 
Northern Indiana Public Service Co. received a notice from the EPA saying it had improved those plants between 1985 and 1995 without the proper permits and additional pollution controls. 
The EPA plans to refer the case to the Justice Department fo.r prosecution. EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt cast it as a sign the Bush administration is tough on pol­luters. 
"They are for increases in pollution that occurred in the '90s," Leavitt said in a tele­phone interview from Cincinnati. "This is the fourth such enforcem-ent action I've authorized in just under 300 days." 
Larry Graham, a spokesman for the utility, had no comment other than to confirm it had received the notice. "We are currently reviewing the order," he said. 
The EPA said the Indiana utility's plants where the viola­tions occurred are at NIPSCO's Bailly plant near Chesterton, two Lake County plants and one in Michigan City. 
The action falls under a pro­vision in the 1977 Clean Air Act that has long drawn con­troversy and complaints from businesses. The provision requires older plants to install expensive new pollution con­trols when they undergo major modifications or improve­ments. 
The Bush administration has issued new rules making it easier for plants to avoid hav­ing to meet those require­ments. Environmentalists. Democrats and a group of states that filed suit against the rules have bitterly complained that they let the dirtiest indus­trial plants off the hook at the cost of thousands of premature deaths and respiratory illness­es. 
The Clinton administration began vigorously enforcing the law in 1999 with a series of enforcement actions against nine utilities, claiming that they violated the law under the guise of routine maintenance by making changes at 43 power plants that added to pol­lution. 
One of those cases was set­tled by the Clinton administra­tion. six by the Bush adminis­tration. resulting in 200,000 to 600,000 fewer tons of pollution from nitrous oxides and sulfur dioxide, according to EPA and Justice Department figures. 
Leavitt said he has been told that successfully prosecuting all of the cases already begun by his agency could reduce that pollution by 1.7 million to 
2.2 million tons.

Louisville detective acquitted of Inurder 

Shooting stirs racial tensions 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -A for­mer Louisville police detective was acquitted of murder, manslaughter and reckless homicide Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a teenage drug suspect that stoked racial tensions in the city. 
The former detective, McKenzie Mattingly, showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. Jurors returned the partial verdict after more than eight hours of delibera­tions and were sent back to deliberate on a separate charge of wanton endanger­ment. 
Mattingly's trial has been closely watched in Louisville's black community because 19­year-old Michael Newby was the seventh black man killed by Louisville police since 1998. Mattingly is white. 
In an 11th-hour turnaround, the prosecution told jurors during closing arguments that they should not find Mattingly guilty of murder, but convict him of a lesser charge. 
"I do not think that is what he is guilty of," said Scott Davis, an assistant ·prosecutor. 
Mattingly's attorney, Steve Schroering, said Mattingly feared for his life· before he shot Newby. 
"There is not one piece of evidence in this case that proves that McKenzie Mattingly was doing anything other than protecting him­self," Schroering said during his closing. 
The wanton endangerment charge related to shots fired by the officer in the direction of a liquor store drive-thru window.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn. Eighteen people, including the alleged No. 2 man in the Gambino crime family, were indicted Wednesday following an investigation into organ­ized crime in Connecticut, Rhode Island and suburban New York. 
Anthony "The Genius" Megale, a Stamford man believed to . be the highest-ranking Mafia mem­ber in Connecticut, was arraigned on a 46-count fed­eral indictment charging him with racketeering, extortion and illegal gambling. 
Fifteen of the 18 people were arrested Wednesday. Investigators were searching for the others, including Igazio Alogna, an alleged Mafia cap­tain, and Vincent Fiore, an alleged Gambino soldier from Goshen, N.Y., both charged with attempted extortion. 
Four of those indicted -Megale, Fiore, Alogna and Victor Riccitelli, who is charged with racketeering ­are allegedly "made" mem­bers of the Gambino family. 
"This is the most significant investigation of La Cosa Nostra in the state of Connecticut in 15 years," said Special Agent Michael Wolf, the state's top FBI agent.

The indictment describes a traditional Mafia organization run out of Fairfield County, with members shaking down business owners.

"There's no one guy who's running the show," said Joseph Coffey, a former New York police officer and mob expert. 
Twelve men were named in the main indictment and charged with racketeering, extortion or illegal gambling. Seven men were charged with dealing cocaine in two related indictments, including one defendant who also is charged in the main indictment.

You will probably be relieved to know that. after consultation with my spiritual advisor. I have decided not to turn Englishman Abroad into a biweekly column about sex. Actually my spiritual advis­er said "Ask again Peter Wicks later." but by then I'd had time to

think about it and 
Abroad
realized it would 
be a bad idea. 
Nevertheless I can't seem to shake 
the feeling that I'm swimming against 
the tide of history. Since 1997 the 
Berkeley student newspaper has run a 
regular sex column. Presumably the 
editors of the Daily Californian got 
together one day and decided that if 
there was one thing the Bay Area was 
lacking it was some frank sexual dis­
cussion. Since then student sex 
columns have multiplied at the epi­
demic rate that one normally associ­
ates with coffee shop franchises. "Sex 
and the City" style columns have 
appeared in student papers at Yale, 
Boston College. New York University, 
Duke, the Universities of Kansas and 
Virginia and countless others. 
Now in some respects this is a devel­opment to be welcomed. For one thing, every column about sex is one less col­umn about politics. in which the writer solemnly proclaims, in a manner more befitting an Old Testament prophet, that justice is good and injustice bad. 
But this trend also has its disturbing aspects, not the least of which is that these columns are a leading cause of puns. I certainly don't think that a bunch of raunchy columns portend the imminent collapse of civilization. but it will be a dark day when "sexpert" makes its way into The American Heritage Dictionary. 
To write a sex column requires a certain tone of voice; cool, urbane, jaded. The columnist's authority depends upon giving the reader the impression that he or (more common­ly) she is beyond surprise in sexual matters. There is something depress­ing about seeing anyone taking pride in their disenchantment, but doubly so when it is a 21-year-old adopting the world-weary tone of Carrie Bradshaw. 

The best thing that anyone has said about modern sexual mores was said by I-LL. Mencken, although he died a long time ago and he thought he was talking about something else. It was Mencken who famously defined Puritanism as "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere. may be happy." Actually, when it comes to sex, it's the Puritans who are having a good time. According to the most authoritative study of American sexual life, The Chicago Health and Social Life Survey, the most orgasmic group of women are conservative Protestants -which is the sort of statistic that could keep Eve Ensler or Dan Savage awake at night. 
But leaving the Puritans out of it. the fear that Mencken described is the driving force behind not just the stu­dent sex columns but also the flourish­ing industry of guides and manuals promising to enhance our sexual ecstasy to hitherto unimagined levels, if only we are willing to undergo the sort of training regime that has hither­to only been adopted by gymnasts liv­ing under communist governments. The message is: other people are hav­ing sex so good it qualifies as a mysti­cal experience. The secrets can be yours provided, of course, that you buy the book. 
So powerful is the fear of missing out, we don't even notice the absurdity of what we are being offered. The pop star Sting boasts of eight-hour Tantric couplings. I'm not sure I'd want to go that long without laughing. 
Hugh Hefner once published a 250,000 word treatise on "The Playboy Philosophy." A quarter of a million word philosophy of living might seem a trifle overblown coming from a man who has spent the majority of his adult life in his pajamas, but Hefner always thought of himself as offering more than just airbrushed pictures of naked ladies. He was a cultural innovator, preaching a gospel of great sex enjoyed for its own sake. Hefnnr's "Philosophy" is by all accounts unreadable, but the implausibly named Malcolm Muggeridge once summed it up neatly in six words; the Playboy philosophy is the promise that "you can have sex without tears." 
Muggeridge seemed to think that the complete severance of sex from emo­tional life was impossible. but I'm not so sure about that. I think it's perfectly possible, though probably very difl1­cult, to divorce sex from all emotional consequence. I just don't see anything to envy in those who have accom­plished the feat. 
We sometim11s think and speak as if. were it not for the constraints of morality, we would head straight for the Playboy mansion. But leaving all questions of morality aside, I doubt many of us really want to b1~ thick­skinned enough to enjoy Hefner's par­adise. I doubt many of us really want. when we are old. to be able to look back on our lives and say "It was a lot of fun and nothing hurt." 
So, while they document our pecca­dilloes in encyclopedic detail, the stu­dent sex columnists will always avoid the questions that are worth asking about sex. Here's one: Suppose Hefner is right and Muggeridge is wrong; sup­pose you could have sex without the tears. Would you want it?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Life is not the problem 
"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life ... "This tenant of the creed provides a rich source of reflection on the origins of life. Contrary to yesterday's opinions about abortion and contraception, this basic belief emphasizes that life is a gift imparted from God. Life is not a problem. 
When considering abortion, contraception and euthana­sia, we must constantly recall our simple belief that no life is an accident. God has always known each and every per­son from all eternity, and if He had wanted you to be born in a different way, He would have made it so. To claim that life is a problem to be solved by contraception or killing is to embrace an ideology where death reigns. 
God has made it clear, in the very manner in which pro­creation occurs, that authentic love is generating and fruit­ful. It gives life. It reaffirms the dignity of each spouse as an individual to be loved and capable of love. It establishes sexual union as· a sacramental act in which God is present and gives his blessing. At times, it is even efficacious to the point of bringing children into the world. 
Life is not the problem; sin is the problem. Sin denies the connection between the physical and spiritual. Sin claims

that their in no soul in the unborn child, just as it claims that God is not really present and active in sexual inter­course. It explicitly rejects the fertility of your spouse. Sin claims thai functionality, utility, and pleasure are the nwt­rics by which life is judged. 
Sin is schizophrenic. It claims that there is no substantial difference between the one flesh union and contraceptive intercourse, making the latter a suitable replacement for the former. It simultaneously acknowledges the radical dif­ference between the two and encourages sterility as a solu­tion to the problem of life. It states unallashedly that unborn babies aren't alive and simultaneously that they can be killed. Sin claims that the elderly are valuable enough to care about and useless or hopeless enough to kill. 
As Christians, it is not only our right but our honor to fight for life. Be not afraid to stand up for your beliefs and to vote.

ALBUM REVIEWS 
"Garden State" soundtrack is a masterpiece 
By BECCA SAUNDERS A.sistant Scene Editor 
The "Gardt~n State" soundtrack is incrndible. 
Whil1~ that senLPnce pretty much says it all. tlwrn is still sonw elaboration to bn made. Although this album has the advantage of being composed or some or thP best songs from diff11rent tl~rrifically uniqun artists. it still shines as a sound­track thoughtfully chosen and well organ­ized. 
The song order runs parallel to the order of the songs in the film "Garden State" which was written. directed and starred in by Zach Bran· (bnttnr known for his role in NBC's "Scrubs"). BraiT appar­nntly has a terrific taste in music. as is appanmt in the selection of tracks for the film. From two songs from Indie band The Shins. to a stirring ballad from the

Epic/Sony Music Soundtrax 

universally-popular ·band Cold play, to a classic from Simon & Garfunkel, the selection of tracks is varied in artist selec­tion. 
Overall. the "Garden State" soundtrack has a gerwrally mellow tone throughout its entirety. This album is perfect for studying, hanging out and especially per­fect for listening to again and again and again. With a variety of artists. it is nearly impossible to become tired of hearing each unique song repeatedly. 
There are not many immensely popular songs on the album, which strengthens the case for the soundtrack further. as any music fan cannot help but become interested in some of the artists that are new to them. Great songs run throughout it, but some of the really outstanding tracks include the Cary Brothers "Blue Eyes," "In the Waiting Line" by Zero 7, "New Slang" from The Shins, "Let Go" from Frou Frou and "Such Great Heights" from Iron and Wine. However, this list hardly conveys the impressiveness of basically 13 terrific songs all complied on one album that is not burned, but legally bought and paid for. The experience of the "Garden State" soundtrack is one that no dedicated music fan should go with­out. There is just not anything bad to say about it. 


Soundtracks have a definite advantage over most albums. While albums from an artist can at most showcase diffnrent sides of that single artist's talents. sound­tracks showcase different songs of differ­ent artists, and generally they are the good songs from these artists. The "Garden State" soundtrack stands out on the count of not falling into showcasing a bunch of big name artists to sell the soundtrack and play behind the trailer. There is no Liz Phair or Michelle Branch ballad to excite the attention of potential viewers crowding the odginality of this soundtrack. The artists on the album are generally those with smaller followings, as is abundantly appropriately for an independent film soundtrack. The film has built a small cult following due to its terrific reputation. and as such the soundtrack gives these terrific artists the same chance dnvelop similar cult follow­ings. 
It is entirely possible that a listener may not enjoy a track or two -although that is probably a stretch of the imagination ­but 12 out of 13 is terrilic odds. That said. then~ is not much more to explain bnyond the fact that the "Garden State" sound­track is good, great, and spm:tacular. It is impossible not to bncome addicted to the soft sounds of all the di!Tenmt artists. The different sounds from the varied artists keep one's attention easily. and tlw songs are generally provocative and well writ­ten and composed. Long story short. this album is incredible and anyone vaguely interested in smallt)J' and less popular artists owes it til themselves to go buy tlw "Garden State" soundtrack -as quickly as possible.

Former members of the Norwegian band Skog, Oye and Boe started down separate paths when the band split, but their mutual love for music kept them in contact with each other. When the tim­ing was right. they reformed as a duo: "two people and two acoustic guitars," as their Web site says. 
In 2001 the two released their first album, "Quiet is the New Loud," and 2004 brings their sophomore effort with the equally paradoxical title, "Hiot on Empty Street." The duo may seem quiet. but its subtle sounds yield a beauty that is far from empty. Its lyrics are intro­spective and handedly mask the fact that English is not the pair's first language. 
The first single from "Hiot on Empty Street," "Misread," has a snap-your-lin­gers, bossa nova rhythm. Its light, play­ful quality is refreshing; but the jazzy piano overlaying the string arrangement diminishes any thought that this is sim-plistic music. The reflective lyrics rein­force this as the duo sings. "The loneliest people I Were the ones who always spoke the truth I The ones who made a difference I By withstanding the indiiTer­ence." 


The album's opening song "Homesick," is melodically and lyrically the best song on it. The guitar picking is gentle and the vocal harmonies of Oye and Boe are near perfection as they sing about find­ing comfort in listening to old albums. They say it best themselves when they sing, "I can't stop listening to the sound I Of two sort voices I Blended in perfection I From the reels of this record that I found." The resemblance to Simon and Garfunkel is uncanny. both in their har­monies and their themes. 
Another high point on the album includes "I'd Hather Dance With You," which has an '80s electronic llavor. The plucked guitar and repetitive lyrics add to this llavor. making the song a spoofy dance number suitable for a get-togeth­er of friends in jest of the dance club scene. 
"Hiot on Empty Strnet" is a St)dated, meditative, non-rock album. Its appeal is in its subtlety. Its only weakness is in the lack of variety among some of tlw songs.

ALBUM REVIEWS 
Franz Ferdinand has strong, innovative debut 
By JOHNNY MOSPAN 
Scene Music Criric 
1\s the indie music scene grows, Franz Fnrdinand takes one giant step forward out of oblivion and into thr~ limelight with its self-titled dnbut album. Thb Glasgow rock group, named allnr thn 1\rchdukn whose assassination set World War I in motion, places its career into . motion with a combination of edgy rock-pop and innovation that presents a fast-forward version of the 80s. 
The band was formed in 2001 when bassist Bob Ilardy, guitarist Nick McCarthy and sing!~rlguitarist Alex Kapranos met their future drummer Paul Thomson. After rehearsing and holding numerous parties for the Glasgow art­music scene, word of mouth spread about this quartet until they were signed to Domino Hecord Co. in the summer of 2003. A few months later it released the EP "Darts of Pleasure," and then followed by releasing "Franz Ferdinand" in March 2004. 
"Franz Ferdinand" starts off softly and slow­ly with "Jacqueline," almost trying to lull its lis­teners in. However, a minute later the drum­beat starts, a groove can be heard for practi­cally the rest of the album. By the end of "Jacqueline," you are already chanting ''I'm alive" with· Kapranos and know the musical liberation that is Franz Ferdinand. The album continues with "Tell Her Tonight," emitting a tone of cheesy synthesizer mixed with indie punk-pop that is quite the deviation from the norm. 
Following these two catchy songs is the radio smash, ''Take Me Out." At first, this song revisits "Last Nite" by the Strokes, but it quick­ly becomes apparent that this similarity is only slight, as Franz Ferdinand perfects the style that the Strokes attempted to implement. This song stands out as a singable and bouncy gem on an album full of such innovative tunes. 


The album tries to slow things down With "Matinee," although finds itselfunable to do as such with the persistence of an underlying drumbeat and bass line which screams out British pop. "Franz Ferdinand" continues with three decent melodies, until it reaches the spectacular "Darts of Pleasure." This tune is entirely captivating and climactic for the· album, capped off by Kapronos's bizarre yet ingenious German cry "Ich heisse Super Fantastisch." After finishing this song, you feel the urge to go back and place it on repeat. And yet, with three songs left, you would be doing yourselfan enormous disservice. 
Following "Darts of Pleasure" is "Michael," and it does not let down the adrenaline rush stemming from before. Its comical lyrics ("Michael I you're the boy with all the leather hips I sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips") release a homosexual vibe, and yet the music does not permit you to believe your deduction. 
Finally, "Come on Home" follows and segues nicely into the last song "40 Feet." This track is as dose to a wind-down song as one can find on the album, which makes its placement ideal. Despite its difference in style, the tempo still stays true to the Franz Ferdinand norm, once again yielding a successful song. 

Yes, every song on this album achieves some sort of fame, which may be the downfall to the album, ifany can be fommlated. After listening to any given tune, it gets stuck in your head, until you go onto the next one. There is no growth or progression in "Franz Ferdinand," as each song could plausibly be on the radio. Above all, however, thic; album is fantastic. As Kapronos utters in "Darts of Pleasure," per­haps attempting to make a statement of the band, "You are the latest contender I You are the one to remember." 
Yes, Franz Ferdinand, you are the one to remember.

The Libertines return with strong sophomore effort 
By SCOOP LATTAL Scene Music Criric 
The Libertines released its self-titled, sophomore album last month after mul­tiple visits to rehab and potential breakups. 
The first track, "Can't Stand Me Now." is comparable to one of Fleetwood Mac's last songs, "Go Your Own Way" in its subject matter. The song is about a relationship in doubt and fits well with the controversy surrounding lead singer. Petn Doherty's problems with cocairw addiction and his volatile rela­tionship with the rest of the band: "An nmling fitting for the starUYou twist and tore our love apart." Like many pop albums. this first song is among the bnst -partly because bands put their better material up front, but mostly because the sound is fresh. The 13 songs that follow the opener range from so-so to exceptional. The momentum 
"Can't Stand Me Now" creates, howev­er. gives the album reasonable hope. 
This album, influenced by the produc­tion of Clash member, Mick Jones, is similar to mainstream Clash and lots of other early 80s British pop punk. Quick, charming drum rhythms support well­produced, garage-style Brit-punk. Guitars play single notes in place of chords at every moment possible to imi­tate vocal lines. Distortion is a rarity, especially compared to American pro­duced punk. Bass is more imaginative than simply following the lead guitars, but does not steal too much attention from the rest of the band. 
Guitar solos are common but not exhausted or over dramatic. The solo closing "Hoad to Huin" is simple yet imaginative. The notes never move extremely fast, nor arc they unpre­dictable, but they fit well with the melody of the track. 
"Music When the Lights Go Out" uses both acoustic guitar and horns, provid-



ing a contrast to the rest of the songs halfway through the album. The romantic tone of the lead guitar pro­ceeding into a blues rock chorus makes this track unique. 
Like The Hives, The Libertines rarely stray from its distinct sound. But while The Hives write short, snappy songs with little time to catch your breath, The Libertines mix up tempos and songwriting styles to provide some diversity. Although many of the Libertines' songs sound similar at the beginning, most tracks pursue different paths later on. 
"Last Call on the Bugle," starts with the common high, repeated guitar notes. The "poppy" level of the main melody reaches the "Tragic Kingdom" era of No Doubt: "If I have to go, I will be thinking of your love. La-la-la-la-la." In contrast to this, "Arbeit Macht Frei (Work Brings Freedom)," the shortest song on the album, combines the 
Mooney Suzuki style of punk power 
chords and the oldies style of starting 
and stopping the drums as a cadence. 
The Libertines are not looking to cre­
ate an innovative or revolutionary 
album. As a pop album. the songwriting 
is nothing new or out of the ordinary, 
but the songs are catchy and will get 
your foot tapping. The Libertines will 
never outdo or replace The Clash. but 
the comparison is at least worthy. 
British pop punk bands have written this album before, combining pop, punk and blues. It was good then, and it is ·good now. Sometimes you do not need to add anything special into the mix if you are already using high quality 
ingredients. 
Other rock albums have and will 
come out this year that are better. but 
for fans of British punk or garage punk, 
The Libertines is a good, safe buy.

A Prayer Book for You... 
by John ft Sylvia Dillon Directors ofReligious Education, Marriage Prep, ft Catechist Formation 
Tradition is synonymous with Notre Dame: the fight song,''The Shirt," rubbing Rockne's nose, and the Notre Dame Book of Prayers. Notre Dame prayer books, given to every freshman upon entering Our Lady's University, date back to 1899. While each is somewhat different in style and composition, all are part of an ongoing tradition that seeks to provide students with a guide to prayer and an opportunity to deepen their spiritual lives. A Notre Dame alumnus once wrote about keeping a copy of the 1942 prayer book in the lining of his helmet as a source of comfort and strength during WW II. 
For the past two years Campus Ministry has been in the process of collecting and editing new prayers composed by students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Daily and seasonal prayers and prayers from our Church tradition are also featured, as well as favorite prayers that have become part of the fabric of our prayer tradition on campus. This new collection, entitled Lead, Kindly Light, will be given as a gift to every freshman, as has been our longstanding tradition. Since a Campus Ministry prayer book has not been available to students during these past few years of work on the revision, Father Wamer has decided that this new book will be available to all undergraduate students, at no charge, if they would like to have one. 
We hope that prayer will be a central part of your experience while here at Notre Dame and in all your future experiences. We hope that your book becomes well wom, dog-eared, and written in, a treasured keepsake of your time spent here at Notre Dame. 
Distributing prayer books to every undergraduate student is no easy task, so here is our plan: 
Freshman will soon receive your prayer book from your rector in your residence hall. 
Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors may pick up a 
copy in the Welcome Center (COMO Room 111, across from the first-floor lounge) any time between 4:00 P.M. and Midnight. Distribution will begin on Monday, October 11, and will continue until the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, November 24. You may only pick up a prayer book for yourself; your name will then .be crossed off our master list.

Woods' back may be problem at AMEX Championships 
Associated Press 
THOMASTOWN, Ireland ­Tiger Woods felt stiffness in his back after seven holes Wednesday and decided to call it a day, not wanting to aggravate the week-old injury and not entirely certain he would be able 
to  defend  his  title  in  the  
American  Express  
Championship.  

The way his year has gone, that's just his luck. 
Woods had every reason to look forward to this World Golf Championship event. 
It returns to Mount Juliet, where Woods won two years ago by not making a bogey until the 72nd hole and finishing with a 25-under 263, matching his low­est 72-hole score under par. 
"Today, I loosened up in the (fit­ness) trailer and I went out and hit a few balls. It was sore, but I could manage that. Then I just quit after seven. I didn't want to push it any further. Maybe I'll get some more treatment on it." 
Woods missed the first five weeks of the 2003 season recov­ering from surgery on his left knee. He also hurt his lower back on the eve of the 2001 Tour Championship but finished the tournament and tied for 13th. 
"I was able to play through that. This one is a little bit differ­ent," Woods said. "If I'm able to go, I'll go. If I can't, then I won't. I've never been one to pull out of tournaments and quit just because I'm physically sore. But if I can't actually swing a golf club, then it's pretty

he doesn't have to 
worry about Vijay 
Singh. 
Singh, the No. 1 player in the world, was the biggest name among six players in the top 50 who withdrew from the American Express. Fresh off his eighth PGA Tour victory of the year, Singh chose to stay home with his family in north Florida to cope with damage from Hurricane Jeanne. 
Woods hasn't looked like a world-beater all year, and he sure didn't look like one Wednesday as he walked ginger­ly to the clubhouse for lunch. 
He said he hurt his back a week ago Tuesday when he fell asleep awkwardly on his private plane from New York, where he had spent the day promoting his video game. 
"It's spasmed up and hasn't been the same since," Woods said. 
He is scheduled to tee off Thursday at 12:50 p.m. with Luke Donald and K.J. Choi, although Woods said there was some doubt he would make it. 
"Warm-up session will proba­bly determine it," he said. 
much straighter, 
but it's not going 
as far -so I guess that's a positive," Woods said, making light of some of his errant tee shots this year. 
If Woods pulls out it would fur­ther dampen a $7 million tourna­ment designed to bring together the world's best players. 
The last two Masters champi­ons have withdrawn -Phil Mickelson for personal reasons, Mike Weir with the flu. Nick Price stayed home in south Florida after the second hurri­cane in a month hit close to home. Kenny Perry wanted to spend time with his family, and John Daly cited a foot injury. 
This will be only the second time the No. 1 player is not in the field at a World Golf Championship event. Woods, No. 1 at the time, and a host of oth­ers defected from the Accenture Match Play Championship in 2001 when it was played in Australia after the holidays. 
"There's still plenty of other players to cover up that loss," Padraig Harrington said. "Vijay would be obviously a star attrac­tion, so that is a bit of a loss." 


There are plenty of others feel­ing like the star attraction ­specifically, 10 players from Europe's winning Ryder Cup team. Most of them are playing for the first time since handing the Americans their worst loss in Ryder Cup history two weeks ago. 
Colin Montgomerie and Ian Poulter were the only European Ryder Cup players who didn't qualify, neither in the top 50 in the world ranking nor among the top 20 on the European tour money list. 
For the rest of the Euros, it's a matter of putting the Ryder Cup behind them. 
"That's why I didn't play last week, so I could let it get out of my system," Lee Westwood said. "A couple of guys in America played well, but obviously they weren't coming off the high that the European players were. I always struggle to play the fol­lowing week after a Ryder Cup." 
Stewart Cink finished second last week at the 84 Lumber Classic, and Chris DiMarco tied for third. 
Woods was supposed to play the 84 Lumber but withdrew because of fatigue. The threat this week is physical, although Woods seems to have taken a mental beating all year. 
His only victory came at the Match Play Championship ­another WGC event -and he now has gone 18 stroke-play tournaments without a victory, the longest drought of his PGA Tour career. 
Along the way, Singh replaced him at No. 1 in the world by doing the things that made Woods the best in the game ­winning, and winning often. 

Woods said he wasn't disap­pointed to lose the top ranking he held for five years. 
"In order to earn the No. 1 ranking, you have to win," he said. "Who's won more the last two years? Obviously, it's Vijay. That's how you earn No. 1, and that's how you stay there."

one winning season, going 6-5 in 1997. 
Last year the Mustangs were 0-12. and this year hasn't start­ed much better. SMU lost its first three games by a combined score of 130-20. 
There are some bright spots. 
The Mustangs have three capable quarterbacks. The posi­tion has been a revolving door in recent years, after the team lost one quarterback to a rock band, another to an accounting job and a third who quit last year after being benched. 
Junior college transfer Tony Eckert got his first start against San Jose State in place of injured starter Chris Phillips. He was 8-of-15 for 91 yards and led the team to touchdowns on its first two possessions. 
And even though the team has struggled on offense, aver­aging 14 points and 298 yards, that's actually an improvement. Last year the Mustangs were ranked last in Division I total offense, with just 260 yards and 11 points a game. 
The 36 points in last week's win was the most by an SMU team since a 42-3 5 win over UTEP in November 2.002. 
A lot of credit goes to new offensive coordinator Rusty Burns, who helped Cincinnati to a Conference USA co-champi­onship in 2002 as well as school records for passing yards, total offense and points. 
He implemented a spread offense, but was disappointed that no SMU quarterback had thrown a touchdown pass in the first three games. 
That changed against San Jose State as Eckert and backup Jerad Romo threw one each. 
Foy Munlin, a transfer from Texas Tech, finally got a run­ning game going for SMU. His 116 yards against San Jose State were more than he man­aged in SMU's other three games combined.

Associated Press 
DALLAS -One win doesn't qualify as a turnaround. 
Regardless, Southern Methodist is feeling confident after breaking a 15-game losing streak. 
The Mustangs looked impres­sive in a 36-13 victory over San Jose State on Saturday that snapped the nation's second­longest losing streak. 
Of course San Jose State was the one team SMU was expect­ed to beat. The Spartans were picked to finish last in the Western Athletic Conference and the team's only win this season came against I-AA Morgan State. 
This week SMU (1-3, 1-0) will get a much bigger test at No. 23 Boise State. The Broncos (4-0, 1-0) have the nation's longest winning streak at 15 straight and their 21 consecutive wins at home is also tops in the country. 
"We are still not where we want to be,"SMU athletic direc­tor Jim Copeland said. "The next step is to win a game we are not supposed to or to win a close game." 
Still, coach Phil Bennett is encouraged. 
"There are a lot of things that we need to improve on,"said Bennett, who is 4-24 with the Mustangs. "But I saw some things (against San Jose State) that give me a lot of hope. I've told the players that we are just looking for improvement from week to week." 

It's been a while since there's been hope at SMU, a one-time powerhouse that went 11-0-1 in 1982 and won 10 games three times in early 1980s. 
But then the NCAA shut down the program for a year for ram­pant violations and the school voluntarily made it two to clean up the program. Since coming back in 1989, SMU has had just

White Sox rout Tigers, want to end season on good note 
Hideki Matsui, the Yankees swept a doubleheader from the Minnesota Twins. New York (99-59) opened a four­game lead over second-place Boston (95-63), and would clinch the division with one more win or one Red Sox loss. Both teams are both assured of no worse than the AL wild­card berth. 
Tampa Bay 9, Boston 4 

Pedro Martinez is ready to put his September struggles behind him and it will be as Boston's No. 2 starter in the postseason. 
The three-time Cy Young Award winner lost his fourth straight start when the Red Sox fell to Tampa Bay, but he said he's confident he'll rebo.und when the playoffs begin next week. 
"I'm not concerned at all," Martinez said after the loss damaged Boston's slim chances of winning the AL East. "I would like the results to be better, but I'm healthy and I feel great. I just have to continue to pitch and work hard. Hopefully in the play­offs, it will be different." 
Anaheim 8, Texas 7 

Troy Glaus hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning and the Anaheim Angels beat Texas, eliminating the surpris­ing Rangers from the playoff chase.

DETHOIT -When Magglio Ordonez joined Frank Thomas on the disabled list in July, the Chicago White Sox fell apart. They won just eight times dur­ing a 28-game stretch and plummeted out of first place. 
Chicago isn't going to chal­lenge the Minnesota Twins for the AL Central lead in the final weekend of the season, but it is closing an up-and­down season relatively well. 
Carlos Lee hit a grand slam and a two-run homer and Freddy Garcia pitched seven scoreless innings to lead the White Sox past Detroit 11-2 for their eighth win in 12 games. 
"We are out of the race, but it is important to finish strong 
and  play the  game  right,"  
Chicago  manager  Ozzie  
Guillen said.  

Hoss Gload hit a two-run homer and Joe Borchard and Juan Uribe added solo home runs for the White Sox, who need to win one of their final four games at Kansas City to avoid their first losing season since 1999. Baltimore .t, Toronto 6 
David Newhan singled home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Baltimore Orioles a victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in the first game of a double­header. 
Rafael Palmeiro hit two. home runs and Miguel Tejada broke Palmeiro's club record with his 143rd RBI of the sea­son to help Baltimore (75-81) keep its slim hope of avoiding a losing season for the first time since 1997. 
Palmeiro hit a two-run drive in the fourth inning and a solo shot in the sixth. His 34th career multihomer game, the second this season, gave him 551 home runs -nine short of Heggie Jackson for ninth place on the career list. 
Tim Haines Jr. led off the ninth with a single off Justin Speier (3-8) and took third when Toronto shortstop Russ Adams threw wildly to second on a slow grounder by Melvin Mora. Tejada then received an intentional walk before Palmeiro struck out. Baltimore 4, Toronto 0 
Hick Bauer finally won as a starter, and in the process gave the Baltimore Orioles something to think about dur­ing the offseason. 
Bauer allowed three hits over six innings, and the Orioles completed a double­header sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays with a victory. 
In the opener, Rafael 
Palmeiro hit two homers and 
watched Miguel Tejada break 
his season club record for 
RBis in a Baltimore win. 
The second game featured a 
pitching duel between Bauer, 
making his first start since 
August 2002, and rookie 
Gustavo Chacin, working in 
his second major league game 
after beating the New York 
Yankees on Sept 20. 
Bauer (2-1) prevailed, recording a career-high seven strikeouts and allowing only one runner past first base. The right-hander was 0-6 with a 5.08 ERA in his previous seven career starts. 
N.Y. Yankees 5, Minnesota 3 
Derek Jeter and Alex 
Rodriguez rallied the Yankees 
past the Minnesota Twins in a 
possible playoff preview, mov­
ing New York closer to its sev­
enth straight AL East title. 
Jeter drove in the tying run with a seventh-inning single off the glove of reliever Juan Rincon, and Rodriguez fol­lowed with a two-run triple high off the right-field wall that led the Yankees to a vic­tory in the opener of twi-night doubleheader. 
New York (98-59) reopened a three-game lead over sec­ond-place Boston (95-62) with four games remaining for each team. The Yankees and Hed Sox, who played at Tampa Bay later Wednesday, are both assured of no worse than the AL wild-card berth and could meet Minnesota, the AL Central champion, in a first­round series starting Tuesday. 
The Twins (90-67) are vying with the eventual AL West winner -Anaheim, Oakland or Texas -for homefield advantage in the first round. 
Johan Santana, seeking to gain his 21st win and match Boston's Curt Schilling for the major league lead, dominated New York for five innings and left with a 3-1 lead. But the Yankees extended their major league record for come-from­behind wins with their 60th, ending Santana's streak of wins in 12 straight starts. Still, Santana remained 13-0 in 15 starts since the All-Star break. 
N.Y. Yankees 5, Minnesota 4 
The New York Yankees can achieve two milestones with one more victory: clinching their seventh straight AL East title and reaching 100 wins in three straight seasons for the first time. 
Behind a pair of saves by Mariano Rivera, Jon Lieber's lOOth career win and the hit­ting of Alex Rodriguez and first time since June 8 by win­ning the first two games in Texas. The Angels began the day tied with Oakland, which played later at home against Seattle. 

Cleveland 5, Kansas City 2 
Royals manager Tony Pena would rather look forward to next season than dwell on this one. 
The Royals set a club record for losses with their 1 Olst of the sea­son, falling to the Cleveland Indians. 
"This is not fun at all. It has been very, very tough," Pen a said. "It's not going to be like this forev­er. We need to start thinking about next season and starting fresh. I know we can do this. I know we can turn this thing around." 
The Hoyals lost their fifth straight -the sixth skid of at least five in a row, and dropped to 57­101 after going 83-79 last year and entering this season as one of the favorites in the AL Central. The only other time the Hoyals lost 100 games in the franchise's 36 year history was in 2002. 
"We have been there before, and we know what we have to do to turn things around," Pena said. "We've already started working on next year because we know what we have to do."

!.HHVERSJTY Of NOT!H DAMf. 


Indianapolis Colts to name the most valuable member of their team, though, and they agree it's Tom Moore, who never played in the NFL but knows how to play the game. 
Moore is the architect of the high-scoring offense that has taken the Colts from back-to­hack 3-13 records to within a whisker of the Super Bowl. 
"He's tremendous," Harrison said. 
Moore. 65, has been winning accolades -and giving oppo­nents nightmares -for years. 
The Colts' offensive coordina­tor coached Hall-of-Famers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth in Pittsburgh, helped make Barry Sanders the league's most dangerous runner in Detroit and developed the Carter receivers -Anthony and Cris -in Minnesota. 
Indianapolis is his latest mas­terpiece. with its reliance on precision, quick wits and the ability to change things in the blink of an eye. 
Gang up against the running game and Moore will burn you with play-action passes. Double­team Harrison and James will pound the ball. Try to take away James and Harrison and Moore lets Manning make the call. 
The combination has worked almost perfectly in Moore's six seasons with the Colts. Manning & Co. have produced at least 5,000 yards each year and three of the four highest-scoring sea­sons in the franchise history. 
Manning won the co-MVP award last year following his best pro season. James became the filth player in league history to open his career with consecu­tive rushing titles in 1999 and 2000. 
And Harrison, who caught a total of 137 passes in two years before joining the Colts in 1998, has established himself as the league's most consistent receiv­er. Under Moore, Harrison has set NFL records with four straight 100-catch seasons and shattered the league's single­season mark with 143 catches in 2002. 
"I credit him for a lot of things I've accomplished in my career," Harrison said. 
Moore said the credit belongs to the players. 
"This is a player's game," he said in the deep, raspy voice that sometimes bellows from the playing field wlien things go wrong. "My base philosophy has been that players make plays and, as a coach, you give them a system that allows them to do that." 
In Indianapolis, much of that system hinges on Manning. The quarterback rallied the Colts for 21 fourth-quarter points at Tennessee, then burned Green Bay with 247 yards passing in the first quarter and five TO passes in the first half. 
"I don't think anybody can run this offense except Peyton," said former Chicago and New Orleans coach Mike Ditka, who worked with Moore in New Orleans. "A lot of it is 'check with me at the line of scrim­mage.' Believe me, nobody could run this offense but him." 
Colts coach Tony Dungy said Moore's approach hasn't changed much since the early 1970s, when Moore spent two  years as a backfield coach at the University of Minnesota. His star pupil in that option offense was Dungy. 
"Tom understands there are certain ways you move the ball to win and that's never going to change," Dungy said. "A lot of the things we are doing here, we did at Minnesota in 1973. You still had to make split-sec­ond decisions, it was just after the snap instead of before the snap." 
Though he's at an age where most people consider retiring, Moore isn't even close. 
There are still plays to design, defenses to confound, correc­tions to be made and champi­onships to win.

Ichiro's chase puts Sisler's naine back in the headlines 
Sisler's family has mixed feelings about Mariners star's charge at hits record, which has stood since 1920 

Associated Press 
Day and night, Dave Sisler is tracking every hit by Ichiro Suzuki. The former big league pitcher tunes in the radio each evening, his wife checks the boxscores in the morning. 
Mostly, he's watching out for his father. 
Because as Suzuki approach­es the season record for hits, fans all over are finding out about the man he's chasing: George Sisler, who got 257 for the long-gone St. Louis Browns back in 1920. 
"I think it's great what my dad did, and that people are !waring his name," Sisler said Wednesday by telephone from his home in St. Louis. "lie never talked about it. but a lot or people are talking about him now." 
Down in Dallas. the Hall of Famer's grandson -also named Dave -already has his plane reservations for Seattle. The Mariners have invited him leading .372 average into Wednesday night's game at Oakland. At 254 hits, he had five games left to break the record set so long ago by the player his family called "Poppy." 
It's one of the longest-stand­ing hitting marks left. Homer, RBI, 

on my grandfather is very p.os­itive. But it certainly is one of the last threads of recognition that he had. He was one of the most underappreciated players ever. So to be honest, I can't really say we're enjoying this." Sisler died in 1973 at age 80. In his day, Sisler was among the 
batting average most celebrated

Last weekend, the younger Sisler sat in his season tickets at Texas _ which happen to be only eight rows behind the visitor's on-deck circle -when the Mariners were in town and studied Suzuki. 
"He's a very good hitter, a really good hitter," Sisler said. And he's pretty certain the

"We're pretty much resigned to the fact that there will be no asterisk," the grandson said. "The light that this has shined Ruth. 


But mostly, he 
was a first base­man from 1915 to 1930, all but the last three years with the lowly Browns. He managed them from 1924-26, yet never reached the World Series. 
There's a statue of Sisler out­side Busch Stadium, and sev­eral of his artifacts are in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. 
''Sisler was the smartest hit­ter who ever lived," Branch Hickey, his former college and major league manager, once said. "He never stopped think­ing. He was the picture player, the acme of grace and fluen­cy." .

you hit at it," he once said. 

In 1920, Sisler broke Cobb's record of 248 hits set nine years earlier. He finished sec­ond to Ruth in homers and HBis, and also was second in the AL in doubles, triples arid stolen bases. 
Sisler really got going by get­ting 60 hits in June, and added 57 hits in 30 September games. 
Several changes in the game helped him, and other hitters. That year, baseball outlawed spitballs and other so-called "freak deliveries." Also, spurred by the death of Hay Chapman by a beanball that season, the sport began the practice of keeping fresher, whiter balls in play, said Tim Wiles, director of research at the Hall of Fame. 
The deadball era was over, and it was a great time to be at the plate. Sisler hit even higher in 1922, batting .420 and putting together a 41­game hitting streak that stood as the modern mark until Joe DiMaggio broke it 19 years later. 
Sisler finished with a .340 lifetime mark and 375 stolen bases. He was elected to the Hall in 1939 along with Lou Gehrig, and his plaque noted his big seasons in 1920 and 1922, along with his fielding prowess. 
About the only one to find fault with Sisler was one of his greatest admirers, W.C. Fields. 
As the story goes -and is widely circulated by his grand­son -Sisler was once invited to visit the popular entertainer backstage. Even though it was during Prohibition, Fields had plenty of whiskey on-hand and offered Sisler some. 
When Sisler said he didn't drink, Fields supposedly replied: "Oh, well. not even the perfect ballplayer can have everything."

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -It was more pep rally than news conference, with the mayor and city officials wearing red Washington Senators caps, the ones with the curly "W" on the front. 
"After 30 years of wait­ing and waiting and wait­ing," said Mayor Anthony Williams, adding dramatic pauses for emphasis, "and lots of hard work and more than a few prayers, there will be baseball in Washington in 2005!" 
Baseball returned to the nation's capital for the first time in 3 3 years Wednesday, with an announcement from Major League Baseball that the Montreal Expos will move to Washington next season. 

The announcement came one day before the anniversary of the Senators' final game. The team moved to Texas after the 1971 season, the last time a major league team moved. 
"It's a day when the sun is setting in Montreal, but it's rising in Washington," Expos president Tony Tavares told a news con­ference in Montreal. 
Relocation of the Expos is subject to certain contin­gencies, including a vote by team owners in November and passage of legislation by the Washington's City Council to build a ballpark on the Anacostia River 
waterfront, south of the Capitol. 
"There has been tremen­dous growth in the Washington, D.C., area over the last 33 years, and we in Major League Baseball believe that base­ball will be welcomed there and will be a great suc­cess," commissioner Bud Selig said. 
The team will play for three seasons at RFK Stadium while a new ball­park is built. The first home game will be April 15 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, according to the draft 2005 schedule that has been circulated to major league teams. The team opens the season April 4 at Philadelphia. 
Eager fans arrived early for the announcement at Washington's City Museum. A petition was circulated to name the team the "Washington Grays" in tribute to the Homestead Grays, a Negro League team that played in Washington in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite his cap, Williams said he doesn't want to recycle the Senators name for political reasons -Washington doesn't have voting repre­sentation in the U.S. Senate. 
Baseball has been look­ing for a new home for the Expos since the financially troubled team was bought by the other 29 major league owners in 2002. 
IN BRIEF Brad.Jey sqspended for 
remamder of season LOS ANGELES -Dodgers outfielder Milton Bradley was suspended for the rest of the regular season by Major League Baseball on Wednesday, a day after a bottle­throwing tantrum during a win over Colorado. 
A contrite Bradley said he will seek help to deal with his anger and wouldn't appeal the suspension. 
"From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for my outburst," the 26­year-old Bradley said shortly after learning of the suspension. "Getting upset has caused me to hurt family, hurt friends, hurt my team, hurt fans. 
"I need to talk to somebody about anger, get treated, find a way to cor­rect that situation. It's not even about baseball. This is about what I need to do for my life. I let anger get the best of me." 
The Dodgers entered Wednesday night's game against the Rockies leading the NL West by three games over San Francisco with five remain­ing. 

Bradley also was fined an undis­closed amount by Bob Watson, base­ball's vice president of on-field opera­tions. Earlier this season, Bradley was suspended for four games after throwing a bag of balls onto the field following an election. Juds;!e declassifies evidence 
in KObe Bryant case DENVER-A judge cleared the way Wednesday for the release of docu­ments and other evidence in the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case as early as next week. 
Workers in the Eagle County Sheriff's Department were poring over some of the records, removing the name of the accuser and infor­mation that would be illegal to make public, such as mental health records. 
Eagle County prosecutors also have some of the materiaL Prosecution spokeswoman Krista Flannigan said officials would "make every effort" to have the files available Monday. 
Prosecutors dropped the felony sexual assault charge against Bryant on Sept. 1 at the request of the alleged victim. Several news organi­zations then requested access to the sealed files. Expos face harsh crowds in final games in Montreal MONTREAL -The Expos and Marlins were pulled off the field dur­ing Montreal's final home game Wednesday night after a fan threw a golf ball that landed near second base. 
. With Florida's Jeff Conine at the plate in the third inning, Expos man­ager Frank Robinson came out of the dugout, summoned plate umpire Rick Reed and pointed out the golf ball. 
Reed, the crew chief, waved all the players into the dugout as the crowd of more than 30,000 cheered. 
An announcement over the loud­speaker said the game would be can­celed if any more objects were thrown onto the field.

Brophy 
continued from page 28 
The Irish were ready for the challenge, shooting 12 birdies Friday and 10 more on Sunday, no small achievement considering the rainy weather conditions, which forced tournament officials to cancel play Saturday. 
Overall. the team shot a 593, good enough to win the tourna­ment by four strokes. 
Perhaps more than anyone else on the team. Brophy followed her own advice. 
On Friday, Brophy went out and fired a 69, putting herself in sec­ond place. 
On Sunday, she followed that impressive round with an even par 72, helping her team win the prestigious event and securing the individual title for herself. 
"It was a big step for Katie," coach Debby King said. "The sec­ond round was a better round than the 69 mentally, because it's easier to come from behind than keep a lead." 
The goal certainly energized the team. perhaps providing them with a fun. new tradition. King has made a sign to take to tourna­ments, and. after each birdie, the team makes King do crunches. 
Without a doubt, Brophy was happy with her play, and the result it brought her. 
"Individually, it's exciting to win a tournament," she said. 
The victory was Brophy's third 
Hope

new strategy introduced by coach Caryn Mackenzie specifically for this game. 
"I lope plays with five midfield­ers instead of the standard four, so coach added another player in the midfield to accommodate their system of play." MacMillan said. "Coach did her homework. and it really benefited us a lot. It was unexpected, and Hope was shocked to see us pull a defender for another midfielder." 
The loss of a defender might have hurt the Belles' chances, but their defense was able to compen­sate for the loss of a player. 
"I think we definitely owe a lot of credit to our coach; it was the difference between winning and losing today," MacMillan said. "Pulling a defender to put her in the midfield is a huge risk, but it was a great move. This is the first time we've had a coach that takes risks; it shows us she has a lot of confidence in us as players." 
The switch from the flat-back four to five midfielders also proved effective in providing more offensive opportunities. 
"Having one more midfielder than usual definitely helped our offensive movement," goalie individual title at Notre Dame, tying a school record that likely will be broken, considering that she is only starting her junior sea­son. 
However, despite her accom­plishments, Brophy has kept her play in perspective. 
"It's important to not lose sight, aside from being captain. that you're a member of a team," she said. "It's up to me to perform on the course and be a leader on the course, in the weight room and in life-to lead by example." 
All in all. Brophy certainly satis­fies her own definition of a leader. She has served as the captain on a majority of the teams she has played on, from club and high school golf and volleyball to her current role on the Irish. 
Brophy attributes this fact to being the oldest of four children and dealing with the responsibili­ties that often came with that. 
Without the help and inspiration of a few people along the way, Brophy may never have had much of a golf career. A high school friend. Lani Elston, who now plays for Arizona. sparked her interest in pursuing the next level. 
"She inspired me," Brophy said of her friend. 
Brophy didn't realize she had the ability to play at the Division I level until her sophomore year in high school, when her golf pro pulled her aside one day and asked her if she had ever thought about it. 
Ironically, Brophy didn't even like golf until around that time. 
Laura Heline said. "The midfield­ers did a great job of checking back to the ball, and Carolyn Logan and Colleen Courtney had excellent games up top." 
"The strategy was something new, but our defense did a good job of keeping its shape and talk­ing to each other so we could limit their shots on goal." Heline said. "By putting the same number of players in the midfield as Hope, we were able to play our style of soccer and control the game." 
The win allowed the Belles to leapfrog in the standings and puts them in the driver's seat for the remainder of the season in their quest to win the conference. 
"This was a big win, and a statement to Hope," Heline said. "We're tied with Hope and Calvin for li.rst now, and we were able to gain respect and build ourselves back up after Saturday's loss." 
After the demoralizing loss to Olivet. the Belles couldn't have asked for a much better inspira­tion for the rest of the season than Wednesday's win. 
"This win is huge, because we really needed to win right now," MacMillan said. "It shows we're still in it, and we have a lot to prove. It's going to take a lot more than a team with a reputation to stop us."

team's defense, as well as the offensive line, which struggled in last week's loss. She expects the line to step up in tonight's game. 
For Off-Campus, last weekend's loss came with noticeable improvement, especially on offense. In its loss to Lyons on Sunday, the team managed to score for the first time this season. 
The team built on its strong defensive play while continuing to grow into its offense this week as it prepared to take on the defending champs. 
"Badin's loss gave us a sense of hope," team captain Lauren Blum said. "We'll do our best, and hope­fully things will fall into place for us [tonight]." 
Blum was realistic, however, about long term goals for her upstart team. 
"We're looking to improve every game, and hopefully we can man­age a win along the way," Blum said. 
"We want to make a run for the Stadium," Heath said. "It will be a tough road as there are a lot of good teams out there. We're going to take it one game at a time." 
Pangbom vs. Lewis 
What's the perfect remedy to early season woes? 
A convincing shutout victory. 
Lewis and Pangborn, both com­ing off impressive victories, face each other today and take one more step towards playing in Notre Dame Stadium at the end of the season. 
With both teams notching a win and a loss in their early season games, the Chicks (1-1) hold tough-nosed defense as key to a victory against the Phoxes (1-1-1). 
"We're going to have to play hard and stay at home and also try not to give up any first downs," Lewis captain Sheila Dawes said. 
After torching the defending interhall champion Badin team for 26 points en route to a solid victory Sunday, Pangborn hopes to carry their offensive success into today's game. 
Using four different players to score their four touchdowns, the Phoxes clicked on offense through­out their last game. 
"They're coming off a huge win," Dawes said. "Anytime you score 26 points, you've got a great offel)Se, and when you don't give up any points, you've got a great defense. Plus, they've got momen­tum, so they present a lot of chal­lenges." 
But Pangborn will have to find a way through a stingy Lewis defense that only gave up three first downs in its last game. 
After relying on their defense to quickly get the ball back and power their offensive drives, the Chicks will try to use the same principles for tonight's game. 
"[We will] keep trying to work on our defense and offense feeding off each other," Dawes said. "When the offense scores, have our defense come out and get a stop and vice versa." 
Trick plays could be another key factor that dictates the outcome of the contest. 
Both teams burned their oppo­nents for a touchdown using a well-timed flea-flicker. 

"Defensively, we're just going to have to guard against their trick plays," Dawes said. 
Game time is 7 p.m. tonight at Riehle West field. 

Welsh Family vs. Lyons 
Undefeated Welsh Family takes on Lyons tonight in a match of two highly-ranked teams. 
Each team has come out strong this season -neither has lost a game yet. 
Welsh was ranked second in the preseason polis, but after a two­game winning streak to start the season is currently ranked No. 1. 
Lyons, on the other hand, has one win and one tie under its belt. 
Although Welsh Family is unde­feated, it refuses to take Lyons lightly. 
"They have been putting up a lot of points on the board," Welsh captain Mary Prendergast said. "They play a good game, and we are looking for this to be a chal­lenge." 
Both teams have been preparing all week for tonight's game. 
"We've been preparing like we always do," Prendergast said. "I think the key to making it to the Stadium this year is to keep get­ting better with every game. Just because we've shut teams out before does not mean we're set. 
"There is always the opportunity to improve. Our defense is strong, but our offense struggles with their rhythm and they really need to get going on a good note." 
Welsh may just keep its strong hold on the No. 1 spot, and not only because of its play on the field, but also because of its approach to every game. 
"We're not taking this game lightly at ali," Prendergast said.

late in the game as the Irish

away. 
Thomas' bout of "fumbleitis" 
has frustrated nobody more 
than the running back him­
self. 
"I had my spot and was starting, but the fumbles have set me back a little bit," he said. "I've just got to keep working. I've never had this problem before; it's all new to me." 
The ball control issues over­shadow Thomas' potential. As a senior at Washington (Pa.) High School, he rushed for 
1.176 yards and 18 touch­downs and was named a SuperPrep All-American and member of Pennsylvania's all­state team. 
Thomas' coaches believe that he will eventually fix his fumbling problem and has the potential to be a very good back when he does so. 
"It's one of those things where coaches try to come up with a lot of different drills to fix the problem," Irish run­ning backs and special teams coach Buzz Preston said. "It's a concentration factor, and it's a sad state when a back goes through that, but sometimes it happens. 
"The best thing you do is just keep pushing the young man and hopefully at some point that concentration factor comes through and things can work themselves out." 
Another young back that has

about the role that Hoskins and Thomas have played in helping the team add depth this year. 
"They've given us some energy and some spark and will hopefully make some progress toward being all around backs and helping us get some wins," he said. 
Hoskins was named the Gatorade player of the year in the state of Michigan, and came in ranked 18th on col­legefootballnews.com's list of the top running backs in the nation (Walker was 19th). 
In addition to his role as a running back on the Creston (Mich.) Iligh School football team, Hoskins also served as a versatile jack-of-all-trades on offense, catching 20 passes for 134 yards and two touch­downs and completing three passes for 71 yards and a touchdown. At one point, Hoskins even punted the ball for his team, averaging 37 yards per kick. 
Hoskins has already proven his ability on special teams this year. returning a kickoff against Washington well past the 20-yard line before having it nullified on a clipping penalty. 
The  freshman  probably  
raised  a  few eyebrows, too,  
when  he  leapfrogged  a  

Washington player during that long kickoff return, something that Hoskins acknowledges he loves to do.

FOOTBALL 
Waiting in the wings 
Irish have a plentiful supply of talented young backup backs 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
When Darius Walker burst 

on to the Notre Dame scene 
against Michigan, rushing for. 
115 yards on 31 carries, he 
showed that the Irish had a 
talented young running back

light. 
But you might have to make some room on that stage for Justin Hoskins and Travis Thomas. as well. 
Hoskins, a freshman like Walker, and the sophomore Thomas could give the Irish tremendous depth at the run­ning back position, something that has proved important so far this season with senior starter Hyan Grant constantly hobbled by injuries. 
Thomas started Notre Dame's first game of the sea­son against BYU after Grant's injury prevented him from playing against the Cougars. 
The sophomore ran the ball six times in that game, fum­bling it twice, and was even­tually replaced by Marcus Wilson and Jeff Jenkins. Thomas got another opportu­nity to run the ball against

Brophy sets goal, achieves 
By ERIC RETTER Spons Writer 
An ambitious goal can spark good teams to cross the threshold into greatness. 
The Irish certainly got that spark heading into the Jeannine McHaney InvitationaVCentral Regional Preview last weekend. The night before the tournament began, junior co-captain Katie Brophy pulled the team aside. 
"I was thinking, 'Why don't we make a team goal where everyone [is] supposed to con­tribute? If someone [struggles], someone else lhasl to step up,"' she said. 
The goal Brophy had in mind seemed both difficult and optimistic: 15 birdies for the team in each round. 
"Birdies really pump you up," Brophy said. "Even if you're having a horrible round, one birdie is really invigorating. I just thought [making that the team goal] was a good idea." 
With that objective, Brophy ignited the team on the spur of the moment.

By RYAN DUFFY Spons Wri rer 
The Belles entered their game Wednesday with a different goal than usual -revenge. 
Four days after being upset by Olivet College on the road, Saint Mary's displayed a new level of fire and determination Wednesday defeating Hope College, 2-0, to retake first place in the MIAA. 
"We had a horrible upset on Saturday, and so we took out our anger on !lope," forward Cat MacMillan said. "We had our egos hurt against Olivet. and it was just unfortunate for Hope that they were the next team we played. We could have been playing the national team, and we would have still fought to the death." 
Hope entered the game in first place in the conference and hav­ing beaten the Belles in their last two encounters. But Saint Mary's controlled the tempo of the game for the entire match. 
"Our team was great; we took the ball and their dignity," MacMillan said. "We were expect­ing a game, but we knew we weren't going to be walked all over. We knew we'd give them a fight." 
The Belles got on the board first when senior Emily Wagoner scored 15 minutes before half­time. Saint Mary's then extended its lead when senior Shannon Artnak fired a goal from outside the box midway through the sec­ond half to put her team up 2-0. The Belles' attack was keyed by a

Redemption and the chance for improvement will serve as motivation when Badin and Off-Campus SqUare off tonight at the Riehle Field.

This game offers Badin the opportunity to wipe away the memory of a disappointing 26­0 defeat at the hands of Pangborn. The loss was espe­cially disheartening, consider­ing the high expectations Badin carried as defending
