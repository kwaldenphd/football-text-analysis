Adam and Eve Americans? 
WASHINGTON (UPI) On Oct. 2, the U.S. Senate barred the press and the public, swore its employees to secrecy, locked its doors and discussed the American that would remain following a "nuclear exchange" with Russia. 
"If we have to start over again with another Adam and Eve," Sen. Richard B. Russell. told his colleagues during that private session, "then I want them to be Americans and not Russians."

Editor: 
Despite the generally sympa­thctic press coverage of this week's peace demonstration, we representative of the protestors would like to clarify some mis­understandings which remain. 
The word "blockade", used by demonstrators as well as newsmen to describe the sit-in, was always used to describe a group act' of passive resistance designed to put moral pressure upon prospective interviewees. It would be incorrect to infer that any physical disruption or pre­vention of passage took place. Three of the four students scheduled for morning in­terviews did, in fact, walk into the placement office. The one other interviewee decided to cancel his appointment after a long talk with one of the de­monstrators, who was an old friend. 
The afternoon's i~tcrviews were cancelled when the CIA representative chose to leave after lunch. He was assured by demonstrators that his return would not be "blocked" There was no harassment, physical or verbal. 
All demonstrators, those sit­ting in as well as another group which held a non-disruptive vigil in sympathy, announced that they would leave when the following goals, listed in a state­mcnt read by Greg Gore, were recognized. 
1. 
We protest the blatantly immoral activities of Dow Chemical Company and the Central Intelligence Agency. 

2. 
We object to the University's complicity with recruiting by organizations whose goals and actions arc in basic conflict with the ideals and 


spirit of a Christian University. 
3. We demand the suspension of interviews until interviewers are available for open q u c s t i o n i n g and f r c e examination of all their organizations represent. 
To discuss the widely debated 
"political success" of the effort: Marty McNamara pointed out repeatedly Tuesday night and Wednesday, our first political goal was to establish ourselves as an effective pressure' group by transgressing the University rules designed to keep demonstrations nice, orderly, and ineffectual. And no matter what your preconceived Hotiou of a "serious," "political" act might be, it shoulu ue obvious tllat when the sltowJown l:autc the demonstrators ignored threats of suspension and/or civil arrest. By demonstrating ·willingness to for the first time since I 965 {When SBP John Gcaren and other student leaders forced an end to lights-out), the 

Admivistration found it impossible to assume that it was being pestered by cantankcrom children. So students now have a veto in regard to policy related to "outside" political reality. 
-The editorial asked: 

"Why bother with Dow when 
a lot of other companies make 
annaments?'' 

~Because Dow, though 
equally guilty of participation in 
our war economy with all 
American corporations and all 
Americans, is particularly 
vulnerable to symbolic protest 
because of the appalling nature 
of its product napalm. 
"Why protest CIA?" 

~Because the CIA, without 
any substantial check from the around the world. 
Finally, this demonstration was historic in that all the factions, from militant to pacifist, overcame their differences which made 
possible the major political victory and also brought about a new acceptance of demonstrators on a personal level. Many students who came to observe found an opportunity for discussion and went home with new ideas. Even the secretaries, who last year jeered at a less vir!Jlent Dow protest and squirted students with deoderant, this year could be invited to talk and accept literature. One lady even bought 
a student's copy of Containment and Change. So much for accusa­tions of lack of originality. 
Sincerely, Tom Henehan

campus. 

The quest for truth within the university community soon surrounded and cmcrscd me. The class discussed Altizer's poetic apocalypse, "the imaginative disclosure of a universal and kcnotic process that moves through an absolute and total negation to reach the epiphany of a divine and human Totality that thereby becomes all in all." Pondering this statement, which I knew was shaking the very foundations of my life style, based on my existentially-dreaded-ever-present-now, I started over to lunch. 
Somewhere along the line I had realized that it was either buy a meal ticket or die from an over-dose of peanut butter and jelly, so I had illegaly purchased a non-transferable admission ticket to the culinary Nirvana. I didn't mind the Polish catburgcrs, nor the shreds of lettuce salad, but the fighting-Irish-green potato chips were bringing me down, so lunch was over. 
The bookstore had run out of the book that I needed, having 
,over-stocked all the books that I needed last year, which they had run out of last year, having over-stocked on all the books needed the year before, etc. Not wanting to purchase their "although we do have it in Modern Library hardbound at a slightly higher price" special, and being the perennial optimist, I tried the library. Admittedly, the Dewey Decimal System has been one of the great stumbling blocks in my scholarly pursuit of wisdom and light, but I located and wrote down the call numbers, found the corresponding 
shelf space, empty, heard the lady behind the desk tell me the book 1---..,.,,.,...,.,,.,...~,...,..,...,.,.~~=--~ 
wasn't out but that they would start a trace, and being frustrated in my attempts at academia decided to go home and do my laundry. 
For those who haven't been there, the laundromat on Corby and South Bend Avenues is South Bend's answer to the ultimate in legal entertainment experience. They have on hand all the eight-month old copies of I.ook or Family Circle that anyone could desire, and if you get tired of that you can always watch the clothes tumble around in the dryers. I did a little better than usual, having only one washer break down in the process, and soon had my clean, yellower-than-yellow clothes neatly stuffed into my dirty laundry bag. Folding wasn't a problem since wrinkles arc in this year for the campus revolutionary. 
Snow, sleet, rain, and hail don't stop Alaskan huskies, but they do make walking a drag for people. The trudge home was worthwhile though, giving my clothes another free cold-water rinse, and when I got home the heat felt good. At least until I realized that I was holding my hair down with both hands, due to the abscence of any humidity in the air. 
Lunch had been awhile back, so I sat down to a hearty snack of sugar sandwiches and hot chocolate water. An old copy of National Geographic was lying around, so I leered through it for kicks while listening to bubble gum music on the radio. I was reaching the high point of the day watching Harry Kevourkian, on Channel 16, dramatically report on a ground-breaking in Mishawaka, when my roommate walked in. He dropped his books in the hallway, and on his way by into the kitchen, said casually, "!ley, what's happening man?"

Grid Picks 
When Brown's Jerry Hart wins the Heisman Trophy in two years, you can tell your friends you read about him when he was "only a soph-a-more." 
Jerry averaged more than nine yards per carry and scored his team's only touchdown in a 31-7 loss to Harvard last Saturday. 
He's not the only one who had a good weekend. That guy who writes the Irish Eye picked 38 of 46 winners for an average of .826. It brought his season record to 70 right, 21 wrong and one tie for 
769. 
Kind of went to his head, though. One good week and he thinks he can fly. He says he's gonna take Brown over Columbia this Saturday with Jerry Hart rushing 12 times for 196 yards and four TD's. 
The East Penn State over Pitt-But State won't find the Orangemen and the Orange Bowl quite as easy in coming weeks. Yale over Harvard-With an Ivy League title and an unbeaten season to the victor. 
Brown over Columbia-Sec above. 
Princeton over Cornell-Leaving the Tigers with a disappointing 4-5 this year. Rutgers over Colgate-A fine 8-2 _season mark for the Jersey lads. The Midwest Notre Dame frosh over Tennessee-Vols got about as much chance 
as a flamingo on an iceberg. Ohio State over Michigan-Buckeyes' offensive and defensive lines are both superior to the Wolverine walls they will face. Purdue over Indiana-Boilermakers' attitude an unknown quantity; perhaps they'll want to win one for (Jack) The Ripper. Oklahoma over Nebraska-Fine comeback by the Sooners won't quit now. Kansas over Missouri-Awful tight here; Jay hawks should be loose with the Orange Bowl bid safely tucked away. Michigan State over Northwestern-If they can keep the number . of fumbles under five. 
Iowa over Jllinois-Hawkeyes are the "comer" of the Big Ten. 
Minnesota over Wisconsin-A perfect season in reverse for the Badgers. The Southwest Arkansas over Texas Tech-Avenging upset victories by Tech the past two years. Southern Methodist over Baylor-SMU finishes 7-3; not bad. Texas Christian over Rice-Battle of the "Southwest Nobodies". Houston over. Tulsa-Cougars could roll up nearly 800 yards in total offense again this week. Wyoming over Arizona-This means the Western Athletic conference title. Texas-El Paso over Colorado State-Three TD margin. 
The South Louisiana State over Tulane-It may go even higher than last year's 41-27 count. Tennessee over Kentucky-This'll be a real brawl; Vols have too much talent, though. 
Duke over North Carolina-Despite Carolina's home field edge. 
Florida State over Wake Forest-Another fine year in Tallahasse. 
Virginia over Maryland-This one will be much more lopsided than past engagements. Syracuse over West Virginia-Although anything can happen down in Morgantown. 
The Far West 
Southern Cal over UCLA-The last regular-season victory of O.J. Simpson's college career. California over Stanford-If the Bears can avoid an emotional letdown. Oregon State over Oregon-It's in Corvallis this year and that should be more than enough for State. Washington over Washington State-Another backyard scrap. 
NFL 

Baltimore over Minnesota-No question about it. 
Cleveland over Philadelphia-Browns win sixth straight. 
Dallas over Chicago--Bears may not score. 
Detroit over New Orleans-Nick Eddy is due. Over due. 
Los Angeles over New York-Rams will be back to solid football after last week's tie with the 49ers. 
San Fransicso over Pittsburgh-And the 49crs are back to fun and games this week. 
St. Louis over Atlanta-Very narrow fit. 
Green Bay over Washington-Bart says he'll play. 
AFL 
Miami over Boston-Do I have to pick this one ?

leers Open at Ohio 
By GREG WINGENFELD 
Notre Dame's fledgling varsity hockey team makes its season debut tonight against a tough Ohio University team. The contest, followed by a rematch Saturday night, will take place on foreign ice in Athens, Ohio. 
Head coach Charles "lefty" Smith and his assistant Tim McNeill will send a young, freshman-studded team into the fray as they begin a four year building program toward national prominence. 
Coach Smith brings a winning tradition with him to Notre Dame. At Minnesota's South St. Paul H.S. he had a ten year, overall coaching record of 
197-68-11  with  seven  state  
tournament  bids and  no  losing  
seasons.  

The formidable hockey sage, who one Minnesota newspaper labeled "Minnesota's foremost teacher of body checking," stated that the main difference between high school and college hockey is to "get the players to think alike." He based this state­ment on the diverse playing and coaching techniques his players had been accustomed to before coming to du Lac. 
The other crucial part of college coaching is recruiting. There are eleven freshmen on the team to attest to Lefty's work in this area. Freshman goalie Dick Tomasoni is a par­ticularly fine catch. When asked about Tomasoni, the coach smiled contentedly and said, "He's first string." 
Assistant Coach Tim McNeill, who described his present role as "an extra set of eyes," gave up the head hockey post at St. Mary's College in Winona, Minn. to come to Notre Dame. The "challenge" of building a hockey dynasty made the assistant's post a "fine opportunity" for him. 
Smith and McNeil drew up a schedule which includes Midwest hockey powers like Wisconsin and Ohio State. "Our aim was to get as many games as possible on different levels," said the head mentor. He admitted that in some contests the team will be overmatched, but reasoned that the schedule will show what level of hockey they can play. 
The Irish have three non­-varsity teams on their ice slate. Jllinois, Purdue and Detroit will throw their hockey clubs at N.D. skaters. Coach Smith suggested that such games could be "hairy" since officiating, con­ditions and facilities are not always top calibre. The purpose 

Sinnott Starts 
Coach Johnie Dee yesterday issued a tentative starting line-up for the opening of the baskctlJall season next month. Dec named center, Bob Whitmore; forwards, Sid Catlett and Bob Arzen; guards, Austin Carr and Tom Sinnott. 
Sinnott replaced room-mate Jack Meehan who suffered a leg injury in practice yesterday. The extent of Meehan's ailment is not immediately known. 
of these games is "to encourage varsity hockey status for nearby schools" thus fostering benefi­cial rivalries. 
As the recruiting program jells, the coach hopes to add tougher opponents to the schedule until the Irish arc play­ing the best teams in the coun­try. 
Against Ohio this weekend, the starting line will be wings Paul O'Neil and Mike Gearcn and center John Roselli. This trio gets the nod over the fresh­man line of Joe Bonk, John Womack and Kevin Hoene on the basis of a year's experience. Phil Wittliff plans to crash the starting line at the end of the football season on the strength of his 57 points in 16 games with the hockey club team last year. 
The offense should be on the spectacular side if high school records and club team statistics stand for anything. For example,
