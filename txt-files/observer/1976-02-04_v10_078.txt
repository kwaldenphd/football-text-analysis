"Our change is to examine the Collegiate Seminar and to make recommendations," Assoc. Prof. John Roos, committee chairman, stated. "A wide range of alterna­tives is open."

Part of the purpose of the open meeting is to hear students' sug­gestions. according to John Eidt, student committee member. "We're anxious to hear what they have to say,'' Eidt said, "because the students have the best view of whether the course is productive or not.'' 
The results of the meeting today, written comments submitted to the committee, and past students course evaluations will be added to the information which has been gathered in meetings with teachers and past chairmen of the program since October. After compiling and discussing these results, the com­mittee will submit their report to Dean Charles sometime in March, according to Roos.

The Faculty Senate will hold its first meeting of the second 
semest~r tonight at ::30 in Room 202 in the Center for Continuing 
EducatiOn. Accordtng to Senate Chairman Paul Conway, the 
meeting will be devoted primarily to four major concerns. 
Expected to generate the longest debate and last on the 
meeting's agenda is a special status report from the Senate's 
Committee on Collective Bargaining. 
According to Conway, the report contains investigation by the 
Senate. The Senate will discuss the priority of each item, Conway 
said, to determine "the path we will follow the rest of the year." 
"We will discuss our objectives," Conway explained, "and 
decide which is the best way to pursue them." 
The Senate meeting will open with a discussion of guidelines for 
the terms of office for appointed academic officers. There are no 
such stipulated terms at present, although there is a provision for 
review of incumbent officers every five years. 
Among those officers who would be affected by the proposal are 
the provost, the college deans and the deans of the Freshman Year 
of Studies and the Law School. 
Conway ~aid the Faculty Senate will also "adjust" the language of a section of its Report on Appointments and Promotions passed in part by the Academic Council at its meeting Jan. 20. 
The proposal in question outlines the" procedures to be followed for faculty appointments and promotions. It incorporates a proposal passed by the Academic Council which requires department chairm~n to provide re.asons for any negative decision involving reappotntment, promotion or tenure upon request by t.1e faculty 
member. The larger proposal, however, requires alteration · .!cause the Academic Council rejected a section which would have established a third-party body to hear such grievances. The function of the appeals board would have been to consider the case in question and make recommendations to the University president. 
In rejecting this section of the Senate's proposal, the Academic Council also passed an explanatory statement to the effect that the faculty member's right to an explanation in no way entails the right to bring suit against the University on the basis of that explanation. 
The third item on the Senate's agenda for tonight would change the Academic Manual to provide for two professors emeriti on the Faculty Senate. 
Faculty Senate meetings are open to interested parties.

Gunmen hold up school bus 
DJmOUTI, Afars and Issas Territory--Four gunmen held 31 French schoolchildren and their driver hostage yesterday in a school bus stalled under a broiling sun, demanding that France grant immediate independence to this small East African territory, officials said.

NEW YORK--A young man climbed over the guard railing on the 86th floor observation roof of the Empire State Building and plunged to his death yesterday. 
The last person to jump from the roof of what once was the world's tallest building fell in 1963, a spokesman said. The total number of those who have jumped is now about 17. 

Morton takes office 
WASHINGTON--Rogers C.B. Morton was installed yesterday as President Ford's political right-hand man, saying the job is essential and that only hypocrites claim government and politics can be separated. 
Even as Morton was sworn in as a $44,600-a-year counselor to the President, Democratic party leaders and lawyers conferred about their stalled effort to require that his salary be billed to the Ford campaign, not to the government.

British government orders resolution in Northern Ireland 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -Northern Ireland's consti­tutional convention was reconven­ed by the British government Tuesday and given 30 days to work out a solution permitting Roman Catholics a share in governing the Protestant-dominated province. 
The session in Stormont Castle, the traditional seat of power in the strife-torn province, opened with prayers for the 78 members. 
"They'll need them," said one political commentator. 
Neither British officials nor Uls­ter's feuding politicians held out much hope that the convention would agree on a power-sharing formula to end the 6'h years of sectarian bloodshed in which near­ly 1,500 persons have been killed. 
The nonlegislative body failed to reach agreement on power-sharing in six months of tortuous delibera­tion last year. 
Hardline Protestants opposed to giving Ulster's half-mil­lion Catholics any meaningful voice in running the province recommen­ded that London restore majority-­or Protestant--rule, suspended by the British government four years ago. Prime Minister Harold Wil­
n's administration rejected that :~and and told the convention to 1.,, again. 
Most Protestants, who outnum­ber the Catholics 2 to 1, believe power-sharing would be the first step toward the militant Catholics' eventual aim of uniting Ulster with the neighboring Catholic Irish re­public. The Protestants want to remain under the British crown.

questioned, Bailey said. 
"There are some who can recite chapter and verse of every single detail of the past two years," the attorney told reporters. "They were not necessarily disqualified. Some were accepted, and many of them could make the best jurors." 
Bailey, who had requested the secret interrogation because of publicity, said "very, very few" prospects were dismissed because of exposure to reports on the case. 
The prime concern of defense attorneys, he said, is that the jurors eventually sworn "have no ftxed views on intent." 
The key to the defense case will be the contention that Miss Hearst was victim, not volunteer, when she carried a machine gun into the Hibernia Bank on April 15, 1974. 
Bailey said that some potential jurors interrogated in secret during ftve days were "more sympathetic than you would imagine" toward Miss Hearst. 
Members of the Hearst family were again admitted to the secret sessions Tuesday.

"Very simply, the price could not be any lower than it is." Plis is optimistic about the ticket sales. "After a slow start, tickets are now going very fast," he said.

Getting Out of the Western Rut 
....iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii robert jacques 
Ever since traders and explorers began coming in contact with peoples of cultures other than their own, there has been a flow of knowledge of techniques, styles, and ideas amongst the major civilizations of the world which has been highly influential in directing the routes of local and, more importantly, world history, the latter especially in the past 500 years. 
The effects of such historical exchanges are readily viewed, as an example, in the cultures of the modern West: Classical Greece was a source of science and philosophy; Roman law provided the foundation of European law; Arabia supplied many of the basics for mathematics (including Arabic numerals) and also for science; from 
the eastern Mediterranean came Christianity. Along with numerous other inputs and sources and creations of its own, the result was the rise of the West to world suoremacy. 
Communication, along with such forces as relentless multinational corporations, aggressive anthropologists (often trying to study that which faces extinction and often hastening the demise by their assidousness), and the insatiable desire of the less technologically oriented peoples for the 'easy' life of the West, has accelerated the process started by early European explorers and sailors --the westernization of the world and its resultant homogenization. Some obvious effects of this are visible around the world: huge concrete trade cities; the rise of suburbia; the decline in importance of the rural areas for most people; the rise of passionate nationalism and its often concomitant jingoism; am, · ' lust to be the biggest, the best, number one .. 
That the world is moving towards homogeneity (primarily with a Western flavor) can be easily deter,;~· \y noting the increasing similarities in the arts, life styles, attitua'-:;, and beliefs of nations located on the various continents as they are reported and appear on television and radio and in the papers and periodicals. Representatives from the world's 150 nations find it easier to communicate not only words but also ideas to each other with great understanding. This is due to the increasing elimination of variety, not a greater understanding on the part of the diplomats for exotic cultures. 
r:ven so, the formation of a world community is so far off that predictions of the date of its arrival are nearly meaningless speculation. Yet, the foundation is now being laid--in and upon the people. 
What does all of this mean to you? Consider what happens when a society (here, largely its leaders) is confronted with a hundred alternatives from which it must choose one. Chances are good that, even with superficial study, a good choice will be made of the assorted good picks available. As the number of alternatives decreases a choice is more easily made but there are fewer good options to compare and choose from. When there is only one way and no alternatives, there is no comparison and no choices. 
This loss of choice is a loss of freedom to man. With all of the various ways of living and thinking now known to the world (this knowledge comes from the same processes which will eliminate it eventually, namely, communications and homogenization) to limit consciously the possibilities is to limit the capacity of man himself. Just as no ethereal hand or star-child will stay atomic warfare, so too will no one prevent man trom stepping into a cultural and intellectual box canyon. 
For the answer to the question posed a ways back, here is the solution: A university, such as Notre Dame is, offers its students­you-a chance to view life through various lenses --history, philosophy, anthropology, science, business, art, and so forth. Anyone who looks through these (and not just glances cursorily for an "A-") will find the numerous, nearly unlimited ways that mdn has lived in the past (with emphasis on the West but not exclusively) and how he could live in the future. In other words, you have a chance to take you mind and soul out of the mainstream of the Western people processor (at least for four years) and prevent mental homogenization in the direction, the one direction, the world is taking .. Although it would be nice to argue for the benefits you, as a well versed human, could offer an increasingly closing society (since such a thing is unpopular in the present fashion of selfishness, it won't be mentioned), it is sufficient to point to you alone. 
You have the chance to consider yourself and the 'inalienable' truths which you 'know' are true, to expand your horizons, to become a more intensely spiritual and intellectual person, to further enrich your life so as to make it more colorful and more meaningful. At the same time you will be building a foundation of knowledge upon which society and the world will be able to better make decisions. You will know of the options in a world which is becoming blinded by its own deft hand. 
Of course, the effort reql'ired and the pain encountered will be considerable ... 
And, of course, the more yo'l learn the more ignorant you will become and the more desirous you Nill be for more looks through those lenses ... 
Of course, the choice is yours ...

willing to spend the time and money for that sport. 
The Student Union exists to serve the students at Notre Dame. It is impossible to please every student with any one event. For this reason the Student Union offers as broad a range of activities 
as possible. 
With the variety of 
interests that exist at Notre Dame it 
is often difficult to arrange those 
activities so that they will not 
conflict. In the case at hand we felt 
that such an excursion would not 
damage the popularity of an event 
like Mardi Gras. The presidents' 
anxiety seems unfounded in light of Editor's note: Tax Tips will be a weekly feature in the Observer as a service to its readers in filling out their income tax forms. Questions may be sent to the Observer, Tax Tips, Box Q, LaFortune Student Center. The questions and answers by Professors Kenneth Milani and James Wittenbach of Accounting Department will be printed in 





the Observer. 
Ql. I understand that I may be able to claim additional tax credits for some of lmy exemptions this year. For which of them may I claim credits? 
A. Provisions of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 allow you to reduce your income tax liability by $30 for each person for whom you are entitled to claim a personal dependency deduction. Personal exemptions may be claimed for yourself, your spouse and each dependent. However, you may not claim the additional credits for age and blindness exemptions. The credit is in addition to the $750 deduction allowed for each exemption to which you are entitled. However, your total exemption credit may not exceed your income tax liability. 
The IRS has indicated that based on early returns, many taxpayers are overlooking this credit. The personal exemption credit should be listed on line 13b of the Short Form 1040A, or line 16b of Form 1040. 
Q2. In 1975, I received a $2500 scholarship. My parents paid an additional $1800 for all my other living expenses. Since this $1800 appears to be less than half the money used to support me, will my parents lose the $750 exemption for me on their tax return? 
A. Any scholarship a child, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child receives for study at an educational institution is not considered in determining his or her total support. Therefore, since the $1800 paid is more than half the total support without the scholarship, your parents may claim you as a dependent. 
Q3. What Is the time and place for free tax assistance on campus? 
A. Notre Dame Tax Asistance Program volunteers will be in the Student Government office from 2-4p.m. every Monday and Wednesday starting Feb. 9 until Apr. 15. 

More than 100 food service directors at several midwestern colleges or universities will attend a regional conference at the Univ­ersity February 18-20.

Letter carriers call for cost rollback 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A group representing 50,000 letter carriers called Tuesday for a rollback in the cost of mailing a letter from 13 to 8 cents. 
Vincent R. Sombrotto, head of a New York City letter carriers, told a press conference that rolling back mail rates would result in the return of some postal patrons who have deserted the Postal Service for other means of communication. 
He spoke for the Ad Hoc Committee of the National Associa­tion of Letter Carriers. The commit­tee also includes union leaders in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Miami, Minn­eapolis, and Des Moines, Iowa. No national officers of the 200,000-per­son union were present at the press conference. 
Sombrotto urged that Congress vote additional subsidies to finance the rollback in postal rates. 
The extra subsidy "would not run more than $3.5 billion or $4 billion per year," he said. 
The Postal Service is now subsid­Ized by taxpayers at the rate of $1.5 billion per year.

Dining hall food nutritious 
by Chris Hopkins Staff Reporter 
Phyllis Roose, dietician of the South Dining Hall, plays a major role in the daily nutrition of a large number of University members:.... 
Roose employs the "4 Group Plan; Guide to Good Eating", when developing the daily menu at the South Dining Hall to insure a well-balanced diet. This "4 Group Plan" includes the four basic food groups; milk, meat, vegetable, and cereal and breads group. 
The daily milk group serving balanced diet. 

The final food group, breads and cereals, should include four or more servings of enriched or whole grain and adding milk to this group will improve its nutritious value. 
The "4 Group Plan" gives the needed protein, calcium, iron and vitamins A,B,C, and D. Taken by itself the "4 Group Plan" provides a minimum of 1,200 calories. 
Roose said, "We provide all elements of the 'four group plan' and more at the South Dining Hall." She added, "We always have the '4 Group Plan' and with it we are able to accommodate many levels of need." 
The "4 Group Plan" does not insure the Recommended Dietary Allowances. For example, the 
R.D.A. for a 19-22 year old male is 3,000 calories and the "4 Group Plan" falls 1,800 calories short of the R.D.A. level. The dining halls offer many other foods to allow students to raise their calorie consumption up to the recommen­ded level. 
Many students are falling short of achieving a well-balanced daily diet for reasons of their own. Roose said, "many students miss break­fast and people always do not choose the right foods that we offer for a balanced diet." 
Roose concluded, ''There is cur­rently more interest in nutrition than before and this seems to be a keener interest than in the past.'' 
This is MY kind of place! [Photo by Paul Clevenger] 
should include two or more glasses of milk. Cheese, ice cream and other milk foods can supply a portion of this daily requirement. 
The meat group should include two or more daily servings of meat, fish, poultry, eggs or cheese. 
Four or more servings of a dark green or yellow vegetables with citrus, tomatoes or potatoes as alternatives should be included in the daily vegetable group. The dark green vegetable provides needed Vitamin A. The citrus fruit wit provide the Vitamin C needed in a
