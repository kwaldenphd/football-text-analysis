Charles K. Wilber, professor of economics, has received his third three-year appointment as chairman ofthe depart· ment, announced Timothy O'Meara, provost. A specialist in economic history and development, Wilber received his Ph.D. from the Univer­sity of Maryland with a thesis on the "Soviet Model of Economic Development." He came to Notre Dame in 1975 as professor and chairman of economics, after serving on the economics faculty of American University in Washington, D.C. Wilber's most recent book, coedited with colleague Kenneth P. Jameson, is "Directions in Economic Development," a collection of essays treating the economic development of the Third World. The book was published by the Notre Dame Press in 1979. -AP 
The fire at the Las Vegas Hilton last week was ap­parently not the work ofonly one person. Fire officials said they are convinced the four separate fires which started the blaze cannot all be linked to the prime suspect in the case -busboy Phillip Cline. The county's chiefarson investigator, Mike Patterson,said it is possible the other fires were set by someone who "wanted to jump on the bandwagon." The fire killed eight people and injured nearly 200 ot· hers. -AP 

Rev. Thomas E. Blantz, C.S.C, chairman of the Department of History at the Universtiy of Notre Dame, has been named winner of the 1980 competition for the best manuscript in American Catholic Studies. The annual competition sponsored by the University's Center for the Study ofAmerican Catholicism provides an award of S500 and a publishing contract with the Notre Dame Press. Blantz's manuscript, "A Priest in Public Service: Francis]. Haas and the New Deal," is a comprehensive study of a man who was both priest and public servant. Haas was an advocate of social justice who won national renown as a mediator of labor strikes. He held severa,l prominent positions in the Roosevelt administration during the 1930's and also served on President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights. Blantz's study analyzes the work ofthis public servant, follow· ing Haas's career from his immigrant homestead in Wisconsin to his tenure'as bishop ofthe Diocese ofGrand Rapids, Mich. Blantz studied at the University of Notre Dame before pursuing graduate studies in theology at the Gregorian Universtiy in Rome. In 1968 he received a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University. He joined the Notre Dame faculty that year and subsequently served terms as vice president for student affairs and as archivist. He is a fellow and trustee of Notre Dame. -The Observer

A danger to freedom 


Last week, The Associated Press reponed that an unnamed conservative group is hoping to re-establish a House Internal Security Committee to investigate ter­rorism in the United States. The group is claiming that "trained commu111ist revolutionaries" were among the 125,000 refugee!; who recently immigrated from Cuba The story went on to explain how Rep. Daniel Crane (R-11.) has put together a fund-raising letter in order to start "an anti-terrorism campaign... because subversive terrorists are coming through America's open door right this minute." 
Most people would agree that it is not unlikely that Cuban President Fidel Castro sent over revolutionaries to stir up some trouble here. Such a maneuver would be consistent with his tactics for ovenhrowing govern­ments in L.atin America. 
After reading this story I agreed that we should be a little nervous about the situation. However, I don't think it is the possible subversive terrorists that we need to be afraid of I'm more afraid ofCrane's group. 
As reported by AP, this House internal Security Com­mittee that Crane proposes would be the sucessor to the House Un-American Activities Committee ( HUAC). That,name take.~ us back some 20 years to the McCanhy witch hunt trials and the "Red Scare"of the '50s. It is also notorious for its inves· 
tigations into anti-war 

during the 1950s and 1960s demonstrators during the refused to cooperate with 
'60's. Since its disbanding in HUAC based on the prin­1975, most people have for­ciple that the investigations gotten exactly what HUAC were an infringement upon 
did and what it stood for their constitutional during the 30 years when it freedoms. These people was a standing committee of refused to take the loyalty the House. It had the power oaths that were forced upon to investigate threats ofsub­
them by employers because version by any group in the 
ofthe these implications. 
U.S. and recommended' 

The purpose of Crane's legislation to the House. Its 
group for the reinstatment main interest was to search 
ofthe committee is not in it· 
for Communist influence Inside and outside of the government. However, it took on a broader search for conspirators against the government when it began in· vestigating the war-protesters during '60s. Because of the amount ofcritcism the committee received over its investigative tactics, its name was changed in 1969 to the House Internal Security Committee. Despite the 
name change, the committee remained the same, spying, infiltrating and making unsupponed charges against any groups or individuals who were critical of the government in any way. 
These are the true prod:ucts ofthe committee. Whet· her it managed to actually find any true subversives is unimponant in veiw ofthe number ofinnocent people that were persecuted and "blackballed" because of a comment made at a cocktail pany or they had a friend who had "communistic" tendencies. 
This persecution was at its worst during the McCarthy Era when the Red Scare was at its height. Most of that was the result of the extreme paranoia the people felt about communism. Today, most people are more tolerant of communists. It is not seen to be as powerful a threat to our government that it once was. 

Candidates run openly on the Communist Party ticket and they are no longer tarred and feathered in the press. If we learn from history, we would understand that separate, individual "conspirators" can do very little to undermine our government. They can never have the power or the resources to adequately infiltrate a politi· cal system as complex as ours. 
Our government suffers far greater damage when the system violates its own values and beliefs. When the system begins to suspect and then persecute in· dividuals because they differ from the status quo, it abuses the very freedoms it is trying to protect. When the artists, writers aJ)d actors who expressed a more radical view ofthe world were blacklisted and jailed for those views, HUAC was denying their freedom ofex­pression. Many brave people 
selfdangerous. Terrorism in 
any form should be 
repressed. But this should 

not be at the expense of in­dividual freedoms. Nor should it create such a panic of fear where citizens become suspect oftheir every word and move. The chance that the abuses that occurred under the original HUAC would be repeated is too great to allow another such group to surface again. The abuses of power that result from fanatics blinded by their righteousness was proven during the 30 years of HUAC existence. 
The potential of terrorists in this country is not in itself a grave threat to the stability of our government. Pro-Castro groups have operated in this country for many years in the Cuban communities of Miami and New York. By themselves these and other groups, for example the Puerto Rican group FALN, present a mini­mal threat to the integrity ofour government. The dan­ger lies in our own overreaction and abuse ofpower in dealing with such groups through wholesale suspen­sion ofindividual rights and freedoms such as occurred in the past under the HUAC. We are far more vulnerable from the fanatics within than we are from those with· 
out.

One month later, a training 
program for 'i I young men and 
women began at Notre Dame under 
the direction of Walter Langford, 
professor of Modern Languages, and 
one of the scheduled speakers for 
the March event. Included in the 
first group were nine Notre Dame 
and three Saint Mary's College 
graduates. 
The University continues as· a 
recruitng center for volunteers and 
is ranked in the top forty campuses 
for number of recruits today. 
The Notre Dame observance will 
include a March 24 keynote address 
by an as yet unannounced speaker. 
Other talks and a panel discussion to 
explore the history of the Peace 
Corps, the implications for the 
future, the role of women volun· 
teers, and the possible directions for 
the future are scheduled for the final 
day. 
Current and former national 
leaders, several congressmen and 
senators who served as Peace Corps 
volunteers for two or more years, 
approximately I00 student leaders, 
graduates of the Notre Dame train­
ing program, faculty, and other for­
mer volunteers have been invited to 
participate in ~he March 24·2'i ob­

for the event. 
The goals of the celebration have been listed by Rev. Theodore .M. Hesbergh, C.S.C., university presi­dent. Hesbergh said that the anniver· sary provides an opportunity to reflect on the birth of the Peace Corps and the University's participa· tion in assisting that mission through the years, as well as a time to con­sider what such reflection might mean for the 1980's. 
John Kennedy cited the need for an organization such as the Peace Corps while campaigning for the presidency in 1960. He said,"There is not enough money in all America to relieve the misery of the under· developed world in a giant and end· less soup kitchen. But there is enough know-how and knowledgeable people to help those nations help themselves." 
The Notre Dame connection with 
the Peace Corps began within hours 
after President Kennedy signed an 
executive order on March I, 196 I, 
to establish the organization. Father 
lleshergh was asked by Kennedy to 
submit a proposal for a training 
program.

Valvano, in his first year as State's head coach following five seasons as the head man at Iona, related Satur­day's game, and the performance of Woolridge, to last Wednesday's game with Virginia, and the perfor­mance of Ralph Sampson. 
"Wednesday night we didn't want Ralph Sampson to get a dunk (with State up by one with three minutes to play) because ofthe emotional ef­fect it would have on his team. He got none. Tonight we didn't want Woolridge to dunk for the same reason. I think he got about seven." He had three. 
Irish coach Digger Phelps was pleased with his team's play on Saturday, but also took time to credit Valvano and his club. 
"We played very well," said the Irish coach. "We had a good 40 minutes of basketball. We had great rebounding, and we made the foul shots we needed." The Irish con­

"I have a lot of respect for North Carolina State," Phelps continued. "The team was a little down after the game the other night -they had a chance to beat the number one team in the country. Sometimes you catch a team when they're flat. That's what 
did But Jimmv (Valvano) will do a great job -he'll get it done. All they need is one good win over somebody." 
Phelps went on to say that, "A key to the game was that they had only one offensive rebound in the first half Then, when they scored the first four points of the second half, we called a timeout and readjusted things a little bit. That stopped their momentum. The players did a good job. We executed very well tonight, and played well offensively." 
Another key to the game that Phelps failed to mention was that Notre Dame prevented things from getting close in the second half by shooting 80 percent from the field (12-15). 
In addition, the Irish commited only 12 fouls in the contest, and the Wolfpack went to the line only three times, making one. Two of the offi­cials were from the ACC. 
Woolridge, whose 24 point total bettered his previous high of 23 in last year's Fordham contest, said that his scoringdisplay was not the result ofa conscious effort to really do any­thing different. 
"I have been looking to score a little more lately, but the shots just happened to be there Saturday night. I've really been trying to work on my offensive rebounding, be­cause when you those, you're

Mitchell, Bourjaily and Pagnucci states their major concern is to "increase student awareness in all that student government has to offer the students." The candidate's plat­form features a monthly Board of Governance newsletter and calen­dar, a reference guide to Student Government offices, and a Fine Arts awareness week in conjunction with the 25th anniversity of O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
Student Body candidates Makens, Hulme and Kelly state they will "evaluate present Student Govern­ment programs and continue those met with approval from the student body and the administration." The ticket contains plans for a student union, an expanded Student Ac· tivities Programming Board ( SAPB) and a student speaker series. 
The Murphy, Lopez, Perreault ticket promises to "devote our time and abilities to the direction of the growing Saint Mary's community." The candidates divide their ob­jectives into the areas of student, academic and social life, planning a cooperative escort service with Notre Dame, promotion and in­creased opportunity for volunteer services with credit and plans for more weekend activities on the Saint Mary's campus "to reverse the weekend exodus to Notre Dame."

Named after thl' order's founder 
Fr. Mon:au's own personal prayer 
house, The Solitude, Mary's Soliude 
is completely renovated and houses 
several bedrooms, a large kitchen 
and dining hall, a spacious lounge, 
library, offices, and chapel. 
"Mary's Solitude is a house of prayer, not a retreat house,"Sr. Melanic said."Therc arc no t or­ganized •= activities or group programs, although counseling and spiritual direction arc available on a one·to·OJle basis." 
Mary's Solitude has a permanent staff, the Core Group, available to counsel spiritual and personal mat· tcrs. 
"The essence of Mary's Soliude is silence, solitude, prayer, and rcflec· tion," Sr. Melanie said. "There arc no radios or other loud activities allowed. ilvcn conversation be­tween visitors is not encouraged." 
The length of a stay at Mary's Solitude varies. 
Laundry service and meals arc provided with the help ofdonations left by visitors. 
Although Mary's Solitude is based on contemplative prayer, the house docs offer other forms of worship. There is the Liturgy of the Office every morning at H:OO, daily Mmass at 4:45, and Vespers every evening at 7:00.

mile in Irish history. He eclipsed Ed Dean's 4:03.6 ND mile record which was set in 1966. It also qualifies him for the NCAA Championships in the mile. He hadl already qualified for the half mile. 
Aragon's mile left both his teamates and his coaches with the impression that he can run fa~ter ­and break four minutes. One reason for this is that he ran each quarter mile faster than the previous one. His splits (quarter-mile times) were 64, 61, 60. and 58 seconds. Aragon obviously wasn't tiring and it may only take a faster-paced field to push Aragon below the four minute bar­rier. 
"It's going to take a race where they run the half a little quicker," said Piane. 
All-American teamate Tim 
Macauley commented, "He took it 
easy most ofthe race. His potential is 
limitless. He is definitely going to 
break four minutes. 1think all he has 
to do is to get into a fast race."

EAST LANSING -The Notre Dame hockey team may still be in ninth place in the Western Col­legiate Hockey Association. but don't let that fool you. 
The Irish took one giant step toward the WCHA playoffs this weekend with their first league sweep ofthe season, a pair of4-2 vic­tories over Michigan State Friday and Saturday here at Munn Ice Arena . 
With Colorado College splitting with Wisconsin and Minnesota­Duluth getting swept by Michigan, Notre Dame made up a lot ofground between itself and eighth place in the WCHA, the final qualifying spot for post-season play. The Irish now trail No. 8 Duluth by just one point while Colorado is three points in front. just two weeks remain of the regular season. 
Notre Dame faces Colorado Col­lege in a crucial showdown this Friday and Saturday at the ACC. Faceoffis 7:30 each night and plenty oftickets remain available. 
Minnesota-Quluth, meanwhile, 
must face first place Minnesota this 
week in Minneapolis. 
"We needed this sweep desperately," said Irish Coach Lefty Smith. "Everyone gave 100 percent. We had to come from behind both nights and it was encouraging to see us do that." 
Bob Martin gave the Spartans a 1-0 lead seven minutes into Friday's contest when he beat Irish goalie Bob McNamara on a 25-foot slapshot from the right wing. 
McNamara, who made three saves in the first period, then came alive in the second period. He made 12 saves and blanked the Wolverines while Notre Dame came back flying_ 
Play became rough at 11:43 when three separate skirmishes broke out and three players from each team entered the penalty box. The fast­skating Irish capitalized on the en­suing three-on-three skating situation for two quick goals and a 2-1 lead. 
Junior dcfenseman John Cox, playing his best series ofthe year, set up both goals. He blasted a slapshot from the right point on MSU goalie Ron Scott and Jeff Logan put by the rebound at 13:45 for a 1-1 score. 
Kirt Bjork made the score 2-1 just 45 seconds later when he deflected a centering pass from Cox over the right shoulder ofScott. 
McNamara held strong when Michigan State came up with two power plays late in the period and Dan Collard scored what proved to be the game-winning goal at 19:22 on a breakaway. 
Dave Lucia set up the score when he flipped the puck out of the Irish zone and Collard stole it from MSU's Gary Haight at the Spartan line. Col­lard drilled the puck through Scott's legs for a 3-1 lead. 
Frank Finn made the score 3-2 at 'i:50 when he stole the puck in front of McNamara and caught the upper right corner. 
But Logan gave the Irish a cushion again just 23 seconds later when he beat Scott on a 25-foot wrist shot. 
McNamara totaled 23 saves while Scott made 21. 
Saturday's comeback was much more dramatic. MSU jumped out to a 2-0 lead with second period goals by Craig Lakian (at 1:37) andJoe Omic­cioli (at 5:53). Cox made it 2-1 at 
15:19 with his first goal ofthe year, a shorthanded tally. 
McNamara played well in the third period, stopping repeated
