ND presidential candidates announced 
Four tickets vie for student body leadership 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 
As election year begins across the coun­try, so it begins on the Notre Dame campus as candidates begin campaigning for the top spots in the Student Union -student body president and vice president. 
This year, four tickets -Ryan Craft and Steve Lynch, Charlie Ebersol and James Leito, Mark Healy and Mike Healy and Adam Istvan and Carla Bell -will compete for election compared to last year's seven tickets. This drop in numbers is most likely due to the number of student signatures the candidates had to obtain on petitions before being accepted to run. Last year, candidates were required to obtain 300 signatures, but the number was raised to 700 during a December Council of Representatives meet­ing. 
The approval process for each ticket comes from having the required number of signatures, and each candidate must be in good academic standing and good standing with the Office of Residence Life and Housing, Judicial Board President Elliot

Members of the Notre Dame Right to Life Club march In front of the Supreme Court last week. 
By MATT BRAMANTI News Writer 
Notre Dame students often have a reputation for being apathetic to current events, but don't tell that to members of the Notre Dame Right to Life Club. 
The pro-life organization took about 200 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to Washington, D.C., last week to participate in the March for Life. The march, now in its 31st year, commemorates the Supreme Court's decision in l,loe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States. 
Janel Daufenbach, club president, said the march pro­vided a unique opportunity to meet with pro-life activists from colleges across the nation. 
"It was really inspiring to be there with so many college students," she said. 
Daufenbach said about 250,000 abortion opponents took part in the march, which led from the Washington Monument to the Supreme Court. 
Several students who attended the march said they were motivated by love for the unborn. Andrew McElhinney, a seminarian at Moreau Seminary, said he had a desire to defend the unborn. 

"It's a really powerful expe­rience," McElhinney said. "It's a great opportunity to show support for the most unpro­tected people in our society." 
Senior Meg Hunter-Kilmer echoed that sentiment, calling the march "powerful." 
Hunter-KHmer said the mas­sive gathering was a chance to build unity among pro-life students from different col­leges. She said the Notre

Incumbents Lao, Chin will not run for re-election 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 
Two names will be notably missing from the list of candidates in the upcom­ing Notre Dame elections. Student body president Jeremy Lao and student body vice president Emily Chin have each chosen not to run for office next term. 
Lao and Chin both cited different rea­sons for their decisions. 
Although Lao said his student govern­ment experience has been a good one, he said he would like to find other activ­ities in which to be involved during his senior year. 
"Being involved with student govern­ment for the past three years has been a really fulfilling experience," said Lao. ''I'd like to use my final year to pursue different interests and to find new expe­riences for myself." 
As an example, Lao said that he had been accepted into an applied invest­ment management course, but was unable to take the class due to his com­mitments as student body president.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Rock the vote 

During Winter Break, gathered at a friend's house over dinner, the con­versation quickly turned to politics. She, a Stanford sophomore, told us of the circus-like atmosphere to which California had fallen as a result of the recent gov­ernor's recall and spoke of her excitement at finally being able to vote as a Californian. She proudly men­tioned how she, like so many other Palo Alto resi­dents, bucked the state-wide trend to recall Gray Davis. 
Her vote meant something, even though she voted for a losing proposi­tion, and she was excited at getting to do it. 
During a short break in the conver­sation, another friend quietly asked, 
. "Guys, I'm sorry, but, what recall?" Polite laughter ensued -my friend, the loveable screw-up, smiled sheep­ishly. I laughed too, later finding this emotion replaced by one of slight sad­ness and even embarrassment. So much has been said about the political apathy in today's youth. Eighteen-to 24-year-olds simply don't care enough, or are too lazy, to get out and vote, the argument goes. College students would rather drink and watch sports than a political debate. It's much sexier to send off that sub­scription in the mail for Maxim or Sports Illustrated than the voter's reg­istration card or an absentee ballot, more enjoyable to surf the Web in search of music downloads (perhaps, even, the new remixes of Dean's ''I have a scream" speech) than a candi­date's personal Web page. It's fairly easy to understand why people refuse to vote. To some, poli­tics is a complicated and frustrating game, too partisan and bitter. Candidates on both sides often seem flawed. College students especially seem pessimistic about government -we complain about the ineffectiveness of student government, for example, at how the administration seems non­chalant about our concerns, how little change actually gets accomplished. Why should we expect politics at the national level to mean something? That notion is false -or at least it should be so. Politics should matter to us, and politicians do get things done. It's time to buck that stereotype about America's youth. We should watch the evening news or read newspapers to keep informed of the campaign trail happenings (or to watch Dean's latest concession/motivational speech). We should discuss issues and platforms with friends and faculty members alike. Above all, we should mark that ballot on election day (watch those hanging chads). We should realize that we've earned that right and are capable of fulfilling it.

Bloomberg offers Mrs. Atkins steak dinner 
NEW YORK -Mayor Michael Bloomberg, embroiled in a battle over remarks he made about Dr. Robert Atkins, offered the diet guru's widow a low­carb mea culpa Saturday -an invitation to a steak dinner. 
Richard Rothstein, a spokesman for Veronica Atkins, said Saturday evening that the dinner invi­tation had been accepted. 
The mayor, who a day earlier advised an angry Atkins to "lighten up," didn't deliver an apology himself. Instead, mayoral spokesman Ed Skyler issued a three-sentence statement about the food fight. 

"While talking to rtrefight­ers about the challenges of losing weight, the mayor made a joke which upset Veronica Atkins," Skyler ·said. "He never intended to insult her late husband or offend her, and is sorry that has been the result." 
Pot fumes cause cops to leave work 
JERUSALEM The fumes from several tons of marijuana stored in an Israeli police station were so strong that officers had to leave their work place. 
The police station in the town of Dimona in the southern Negev Desert is used to store all the mari­juana confiScated along the Israeli-Egyptian border, a busy smuggling route. Between three and four tons were seized in the past two months. 
"The smell was overpow­ering," police spokesman Gil Kleiman said Friday. 
Finally, it was too much for the officers working next door to the storage room, and they had to leave their offices.

"This meeting was groundbreaking and will influence the future [because] we have laid the groundwork for talk­ing to Keenan before the Revue," Bailey said. "The same issues come up every year and Saint Mary's and Keenan have never met before the show. We want to keep things civil and enjoy­able." 
Thesing declined to comment on the meeting

practical ways to address issues. 
"Some things guys just don't get," Mahoney said. "It may not be offensive to them, but if they think in a broader sense and talk

ways  people  can  be  
offended, it is  our hope  

they will weed those things out before they get into the show." 
Mahoney said Thesing screened the skits Friday night. Each evening, the show will start with a dis­claimer stating that the Revue is self-mocking and has no intention of offend­ing the audience. 
Mahoney said that, as a result of the discussion, she hopes that planning for the show will start earlier in future years and avoid many offensive jokes. 
"The success of our efforts will depend [on] how much the producers and rector push the men of Keenan to do this," Mahoney said. "This has to be something they value and want to do." 
The Saint Mary's Keenan Revue Committee will screen the variety show Wednesday. The committee consists of Saint Mary's student body president and vice presi­dent, two members of Holy Cross College's stu­dent government and may include two Notre Dame representatives. The com­mittee also plans to meet with Keenan residents after the show to review how jokes worked, whether people were offended and how the Revue can improve. 
"This was a good first step," Bailey said. "[Thesing] was very nice to come over to meet with us, but, in the future, we need to do more before the event."

Sarah Brown 
Who are they? 
Sarah Brown is a junior philosophy and political science major. She is currently serving as the Saint Mary's student body vice president. Michelle Fitzgerald is a sophomore political science and reli­gious studies major. She is currently the sophomore class president. 
+ 
Fun Facts: If elected, Fitzgerald would become vice-president after serving as sophomore class president, as did current Saint Mary's president Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl and Brown. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "We are not past administra­tions. We have different leadership styles," Brown said. 



In their words ... 
+ 
Top Priority: Expanding the backgrounds of students involved in student government leadership positions. 

+ 
First Priority: Drawing a large applicant pool for positions on the Board of Governance. 



In our words... 
+ 
Best Idea: Building upon efforts by the current administration to continue making student govern­ment leaders visible and available to students. 

+ 
Worst Idea: Increasing the use of the student government logo as a marketing tool for the student body president. 

+ 
Bottom Line: Brown and Fitzgerald are the most experienced ticket. They have both served in top leadership positions and Brown's experience in the Office of the Student Body President means she is very familiar with the workings of the office and what is feasible. Students should view their proposed expansions of current initiatives favorably as this year's student government was successful in both improving itself and working with the administration to achieve goals for students, such as the implemen­tation of the reading day. This ticket wants to build upon what already has been done and follows the edict that if isn't broke, it shouldn't be ftxed. 





Shay Jolly 

Who are they? 

Shay Jolly is a junior communications major. She currently serves as the president of the Resident Hall Association. Veronica Saavedra is a junior busi­ness major. She currently serves as the president of the Student Diversity Board. 
+ 
Fun Facts: Jolly is passionate about sports and is considering being a sports broadcaster. Saavedra likes to play racquetball. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "[Student government] needs more of a support system.... We are all Belles in our own right and we should support each other," Jolly said. 



In their words... 

+ 
Top Priority: Increase relationships between faculty and students and Saint Mary's and Notre Dame 

+ 
First Priority: Determine and analyze problems within student government to help eliminate these hierarchical issues within the structure 



In our words... 

+ 
Best Idea: Improving communication within stu­dent government and between Saint Mary's and the community 

+ 
Worst Idea: Focusing too much on equalizing power between the five boards and the Board of Governance 

+ 
Bottom Line: These women decided to run together after a night of discussion about how their respective boards did not have power and were lost in the student government structure. It is no surprise their main priority is to fix the problems \\-ithin student government -namely equalizing power between the five boards and decreasing the power of the Board of Governance. They praised the current administation's effort to bring organization to and publicize student government, but think that more can be done by build­ing support for all aspects of the organization. This ticket has too narrow of a focus and appears to be running solely to make a statement about increasing power for other branches as opposed to focusing on what student government can do for students. 




Sarah Catherine White 
Who are they? 
Sarah Catherine White is a business major and ltalian minor. Mary Pauline Moran. the junior class vice president, is majoring in business administra­tion. White and Moran currently serve as the junior class president and vice president, respectively. 
+ 
Fun Facts: White studied in Rome for a semester. Moran is an Irish dancer. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "We have a very realistic sense and a fresh outlook on student government and the student needs ...We're not afraid to stop something if it's not working," White said. 



In their words... 
+ 
Top Priority: Emphasize simple events and enliven attitude in daily campus life. 

+ 
First Priority: Welcome new College President Carol Mooney with an all school dinner or gather­ing. 



In our words... 
+Best Idea: Establish procedure manual that lists names. numbers an processes, which can be utilized by students who wish to institute events or other types of action on campus. 
+Worst Idea: Strengthen ties with South Bend com­munity primarily by encouraging Mass participation. 
+ Bottom Line: White and Moran exude an admirable enthusiasm and desire to enliven the gen­eral attitude on the Saint Mary's campus. However, their platform lacks specific goals and they are rela­tively inexperienced on the executive level. particu­larly when compared to other candidates. While White and Moran are eager and dedicated. their abil­ity to achieve concrete accomplishments is doubtful. While they kno"v the "ins and outs" of student gov­ernment, in their words, their ideas are narrow and somewhat hackneyed, failing to put this inside knowledge to good use. The candidates are rightly concerned with working closely \Vith new College president Carol Mooney, and they want to introduce her to the atmosphere of the school and their own attitudes. Again. though, their concern with attitude overshadows their concern with action.

Mexico admits Peace Corps volm1teers 
MEXICO CITY -Mexico has broken a decades-old tradition of rejecting U.S. aid workers. granting permission for the first group of U.S. Peace Corps volunteers ever to work here. 
Mindful of national sensitivity over U.S. influence, though, the government plans to keep the group out of public view. 
Still, for a country that has kicked out or criticized U.S. experts in the past -and for one touchy about being viewed as underde­veloped -it's a big change. 
The decision was made in November. The first 15 volunteers, scheduled to arrive this summer, won't be performing the Peace Corps' usual tasks in construction, rural schools, clinics or farmer training. They will be tucked away in research centers to work on information technology, science and busi­ness development. 
Asian bird flu outbreaks continue 
BANGKOK, Thailand -Indonesia became the seventh country in Asia to confirm an outbreak of deadly bird flu, as the World Health Organization warned Sunday the virus could be resistant to basic human influenza drugs. 
The disease has already affected millions of chickens in Indonesia, said Sofjan Sudardjat, a senior agriculture official. But the virus has not yet crossed over to humans, he said. 
Indonesian officials had earlier denied the diseases' presence, but the Indonesian Veterinarians Association said several inde­pendent investigations had revealed that bird flu had already killed millions of chickens over the past several months. Asia is on a region-wide health alert, with governments slaughtering millions of chickens to contain outbreaks in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

Opportunity sends 'astonishlng' photos 
Second rover lands safely, transmits dozens of images to NASA scientists

PASADENA, Calif. -
NASA's Opportunity rover 
sent its first pictures of 
Mars to Earth on Sunday, 
delighting and puzzling 
scientists just hours after 
the spacecraft bounced to 
a landing. 
The pictures show a sur­

Bounce marks left by the 
rover's air bags when it 
landed were clearly visible. 
"I am flabbergasted. I am astonished. I am blown away. Opportunity has touched down in an alien and bizarre landscape," said Steven Squyres, of Cornell University and the mission's main scientist. "I still don't know what we're looking at." 
NASA began receiving the first of dozens of black­and-white and color images from Opportunity about four hours after its flawless landing. Mars at the time was 124 million miles from Earth.

and concerns realistically, provide an approachable and welcoming student government and evaluate campus academics and relations between departments. We also believe we should recognize and integrate campus talent and ath­letics and enliven and recognize student's spiritual needs on cam­pus." 
White has been involved in the Board of Governance Academic Standards committee, as well as serving as the Abroad chair her sophomore year and the Social Co-chair of the first-year board. She is majoring in Business, with a concentration in International Business and a minor in Italian. 
Moran has also held many posi­tions in Saint Mary's politics. She is the current junior class vice president, and she was on the Student Government Association's constitution committee. Moran was the BOG Technology commis­sioner as a sophomore and worked on the first-year board to help design the Oass of 2005 Web page. Moran is an MIS major with a concentration in Accounting. 
White and Moran said that the reasons to run for president and vice president are countless. 
"We have a passion for this school," said White. "We feel we represent a wide variety of stu­dents here, and people have enjoyed what we've done so far. We are always up for a challenge, and this certainly is one, an excit­ing one." 
White also said she and Moran feel all students are a part of stu­dent government. 
"All students at Saint Mary's play a role as a leader, whether silent or for all to see," said White. It would be an honor to represent the talent and energy of all the students that lead us. This is something that is in our gut, that gets us energized, and it's some­thing we would love to do." 
Brown, a junior and the current student body vice president, and Fitzgerald, a sophomore, said they would be qualified candi­dates. 
"I think Michelle and I have a good combination of experience and fresh ideas," said Brown. "We're not opposed to new ideas, and we're not stuck in an old sys­tem. We have good relationships with the faculty, staff and students at Saint Mary's, and we also have a good feel for what is current." 
Brown and Fitzgerald's plat­form places much emphasis on improvements both in and out of student government. 
"We would really like to contin­ue to spread out the leadership roles in student government and have the committees take on more responsibility to keep the leadership balanced and fair," said Brown. "We would also like to continue to expand student government and look for new ways to involve more students. Reaching out to a broader base of students is also important to us because we want everyone to feel as though they are a part of gov­ernment at Saint Mary's."

"We've seen ourselves doing this for a long time, and we like that as the president and vice president, we get to be involved in all aspects of student govern­ment," said Brown. "Both of us really enjoy the policy-making aspect of student government, and we're excited to expand on that." 
Jolly and Saavedra, both jun­iors, believe they have fresh ideas for the future of Saint Mary's. 
"We want to work to incorpo­rate all aspects of Saint Mary's life like sports and clubs into one community where we can all share it," said Jolly. "We want to continue our connections with Notre Dame and Holy Cross and extend it further to the entire community of South Bend .... And with the new administration com­ing in, we'd love to be there to both students and to Mooney and her administration to make the transition as smooth as possible." 
Serving as the current Residence Hall Association presi­dent, Jolly also serves as a BOG executive. She served as class treasurer her sophomore year and has been the welcome com­mittee chairwoman. Recently, she served on the apartment commit­tee, helping to make decisions about the campus apartments. Jolly is a communications major. 

Saavedra is the Student Diversity Board president and also serves as a BOG executive. She is majoring in business. 
"We've both been very involved in BOG this year, and we're seen the behind-the-scenes work that goes into it," said Jolly. "We've really enjoyed our time and the large role we played in student government this year. Veronica and I have a lot of the same ideas, and we're ready to make Saint Mary's a place for today and the future." 
Jolly said that she and Saavedra are capable for the job. 
"Together with the students, we want to make Saint Mary's into a wonderful community that every­one, everywhere, knows about and loves," said Jolly. "We want to make this a place where the stu­dents know that this is our school. and this is the place we can call our home."

IN BRIEF 
Halliburton to pay back overcharge 
WASHINGTON -Halliburton will pay the Pentagon $6.3 million for possible over­charges by a subcontractor that is accused of giving kickbacks to supply U.S. soldiers in Iraq, a spokeswoman said Friday in new trou­ble for Vice President Dick Cheney's former company. A spokesman said the company was paying the $6.3 million to the Army Materiel Command to cover any possible overcharges while the Pentagon investigates. 
The Pentagon already has in progress a criminal inquiry into possible overcharging involving another Halliburton contract to sup­ply gasoline to Iraqi civilians. Democrats have criticized the contracts and demanded further investigations; the company has denied wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Halliburton has begun an advertising campaign to improve its image. 
Weyerhaeuser Q4 profits fall 
SEATTLE -Profits at timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. fell 27 percent in the fourth quarter, as the company took a series of one­time charges and recorded a large one-time gain on the sale of timberlands. 
Federal Way, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser said Friday it earned $92 million, or 41 cents per share, for the three-month period ended Dec. 
28. That was down from earnings of $126 mil­lion, or 57 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 9 percent to nearly $5.15 billion from revenues nearly $4.72 billion a year ago. 
Toyota passes Ford, takes second 
TOKYO -Toyota Motor Corp. outsold Ford Motor Co. last year to become the world's No. 2 automaker behind General Motors Corp., pre­liminary sales data released by the Jap.anese company showed Friday. 
A Toyota spokesman said estimated unit sales for 2003 reached 6.78 million vehicles, up 9.9 percent from 6.17 million the previous year. 
On Thursday, Ford reported its 2003 sales slipped to 6.72 million vehicles, down 3.6 per­cent from 6.97 million. 
Toyota spokesman Shinya Matsumoto charac­terized his company's sales as an "indicator" of rising customer satisfaction but played down the comparison with Ford.

Costa Rica fifth to join CAFTA 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The 
Bush administration 
reached an agreement with 
Costa Rica on Sunday that 
will allow that nation to join 
four of its neighbors in cre­
ating a Central American 
Free Trade Area with the 
United States, officials of the 
two countries announced. 
The deal must be 
approved by Congress. 
The agreement came 
after two weeks of intense 
negotiations aimed at over­

had prompted Costa Rica to

of his hometown, Orlando. 
Mark Healy said he chose Mike Healy for his running mate because he "can tell that Mike has the right intuition to be able to lead." 
Istavan said his ticket's main approach is to get SYRs back in the dorms. 
"The class of juniors now is the last class that has had an SYR in the dorms," said Istvan, "and when we graduate, there "'ill be no one who can say, 'I remember when it was better."' 
Istvan cited the lack of this issue in the past two reports to the Board of Trustees, given by former student body presidents Libby Bishop and Pat Hallahan. 
"This is the kind of personality we can't perpetuate in student government ... we need to get more effective people in the office," he said. "We need to have SYRs back in the dorms. It's bet­ter for community building, and it's just more fun." 
Istvan also commented on other issues in his campaign, which include transportation for students to and from downtown South Bend. 
"I would like to bring back ... the bus that takes students from campus to the downtown distlict where people can go out and not have to worry about drivers," he said. "It would make it easier for people to go out." 
Istvan cited another institution, Xavier University in Cincinnati, which has a program like this. 
Istvan was formerly the dance commissioner for Morrissey Hall, and Bell is the current president of Walsh Hall. She also worked for former student body president Brooke Norton. 
Craft and Lynch also want to focus on changes to better stu­dent life. 
"We're not looking to rearrange the setup and intricacies of stu­dent government, but to make changes that affect the every day lives of the students," Craft said. 
Craft cited several ideas that his ticket wishes to implement that they believe would improve the lives of students. 
"Our two prime objectives 
would be that we're trying to get a printer in every dorm that [stu­dents] can use their printing quota for," he said. "And we're trying to get a shuttle bus from the Joyce Center parking lot to DeBartolo [for off-campus stu­dents]. and Grab 'n Go in DeBartolo Hall." 
Craft and Lynch also want to institute an inexpensive movie rental program on campus and design better off-campus trans­portation. 
"We feel that we can bring a fresh outlook to [student govern­ment]," Craft said. "We feel if we can succeed in meeting these objectives that the students will notice a difference in what their student government is doing for them." 
The two do not have experi­ence with student government on campus, but they feel that it is this inexperience that will help them bring a fresh perspective to the office.

Doctor Dean quacks up 
It must be tough to be Howard Dean. From the looks of things, even Howard Dean is having a hard time being Howard Dean. 
Last Monday, in Mike Marchard the Iowa caucus, he was beaten soundly, by 20 and 14 points Undistinguishedby John Kerry and 
Alumnus
John Edwards, 
respectively, two 
guys whose cam­paigns were roadkill as little as four weeks ago. Up until the Hawkeye State, 
Dean had never lost an election in his 20­year political career. Initially, he seemed like he was handling his defeat well, smil­ing and waving an American flag before supporters in Des Moines. 
"If you had told us one year ago that we were going to come in third in Iowa," Dean said, "we would have given anything for that." This is quite true: Dean's revolu­tionary campaign has been nothing short of spectacular. 
He then went on: "Not only are we going to New Hampshire ...."At this point, the little Jiminey Cricket inside Howard's head should have thrown the kill switch and made him stop. But the fervor of the crowd increased, and he lost himself in the moment: "We're going to South Carolina. and Oklahoma, and Arizona, and North Dakota, and New Mexico ..." and he listed just about every other state in the Union, two Canadian provinces and American Samoa. 
Shortly thereafter, Dean came complete­ly uncorked: "And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House!" And then he let loose with ... well, nobody's quite sure what exactly it was, but it made dogs cover their ears and sheep in Dubuque bleat inconsolably. 
Clever wordsmiths noticed that the Iowa caucus was held on Martin Luther King Day and therefore called Dean's outburst the "I Have A Scream" speech. It's a fun little pun, and I hate splitting synonymic hairs, but that was most definitely not a scream. It was ... a yelp, really, a minia­ture little shriek that sounds like some­thing someone would blurt when momen­tarily frightened at a haunted house on Halloween. 

Other, far more generous observers thought that it was some sort of cathartic therapy, a venting of the energy that had amassed from shouting out states like a rock star who's trying to pry applause out of a crowd. But it was less Walt Whitman's "barbaric yawp" and more like, to be hon­est, Yosemite Sam experiencing an orgasm. And with that in mind, as I scan a thesaurus, I think I've found the precise word to describe Dean's "Yaahhhh!": an ejaculation. O'm not lying. Look it up.) 
If I may say so myself, it's perfect: it was at the end of the night and came following a rapid buildup to a climactic release. And the next day, he regretted that it ever hap­pened. Psychoanalysts of all stripes have made instant diagnoses of the speech ("He really lost it," "Over the top ... childlike"), but it's hard to believe none of them con­sidered this more Freudian angle. 
And, like a sexual expression, it's all over the Internet. Quirky amateur musi­cians have set it to music, meaning Dean, who's an idol to thousands of hip young people who normally don't vote, is quite possibly the first politician whose words (and other utterances) have been trans­formed into a dance remix. One Web site's version was downloaded so often that they pulled it due to bandwidth con­straints. 
Some analysts think that Dean's candi­dacy spontaneously combusted with the ... uh. eruption. Depending on which New Hampshire tracking poll you favor, he has lost between one-third and one-half of his support since Iowa Night. But that's more likely due to the damage "Mad How" wrought upon himself before Iowa ("The capture of Saddam has not made America safer") and the deeper context of his vis­ceral howL 
Voters may be a fickle bunch, but nobody's going to turn away from a candi­date because he made a gurgling noise, no matter how ridiculous it sounded or how much it's mocked on TV. Dean's los­ing support because of the impression ­which he himself has admitted -that he's impulsive, or as Dean put it, "I lead with my heart and not my head." This is a decidedly unpresidential characteristic. 
So Dean's fire and passion, which are what helped him lead the Democratic pack, may prove to be his undoing. According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll, only half of New Hampshire Democrats think he has "the kind of per­sonality that a president should have." Forty-six percent think he does not. 
Dean has already slipped behind Kerry in New Hampshire, where the primary takes place Tuesday. If he falls to third behind Wesley Clark, who's an even flaki­er candidate than Dean is, then you might as well stick a fork in him. 
But not too hard; he's prone to wail.

Acting out against affirmative action 
Affirmative action has been a touchy subject for many Americans for a long time. Last year, Notre Dame was affected directly when our University officially sided with the University of Michigan's admissions policy, which awards "bonus" points to applicants from minority groups. Greg Parnell 
I am from a public school in the Washington, D.C. area, which has a much

than this University. Therefore, I know how important diversity is to a holistic education and believe our school must always take all possible strides to recruit stu­dents rrom varied backgrounds. However, I have also witnessed less-qualified minority students get into prestigious colleges, while more quali­fied white students were refused admission. Seeing both sides first-hand, I have long strug­gled to find my own position. 
My views became solidified when I read "What's So Great About America?" by Dinesh D'Souza. An Indian immigrant who has served as a White House policy analyst, D'Souza argues vehemently against affirmative action. I found his arguments quite com­pelling and think that many other students with reserva­tions similar to my own may find D'Souza's perspective helpful. 
The main thrust of D'Souza's anti-affir­mative action argu­ment is a contrast between the pre­vailing sentiments of two groups: the African-American population and the non-white immigrant pop­ulation. 

According to D'Souza, immi­grants often compare America to conditions in their home countries, amazed that what would be considered "luxuries" in their homes are oftentimes seen 
as basic necessi­ties here. In fact, the minimum wage rate in America is higher than the average income in many coun­tries. 
Conversely, many African-Americans com­pare their troubles to the lives of the American elite. For example, "If rich white kids can go to college, then my children should have the same opportunity." Using this standard for comparison is completely irrational, as it assumes that every citizen has the right to what­ever anyone else has, regardless of other differ­ences, usually based on merit. 
African-Americans sometimes counter that

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Building a ·new Berlin Wall? 
This letter concerns John Infranca's column of 
Jan. 23 regarding immigration. I sympathize with 
his concerns and regret that the haphazard 
approach taken by the United States to immigration 
has cost many lives. 
Immigration has positive and negative effects. I know from personal observation in Chicago that many employers will hire Mexican immigrants before they will hire blacks. I don't think that is fair. Nor is it fair to assume that no one else will perform the jobs that Hispanic immigrants take. 
Ironically, the real answer to the problem is to mimic the Soviet reaction to the exodus of Germans through East Berlin to the west in the early '60s. Spend $40 billion or whatever it takes to build a wall -a big one -from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. This will make it clear to Mexicans that the only way they can enter the United States is through legal channels. It will also save lives. 
Finally, it is worth pointing out that real source of the problem is the corrupt and abusive Mexican government. It exploits its populace while operating what is in effect a socialist one-party system and demands the United States provide a safety valve. The more we appease that government, the more harm we do to Mexicans. 
Peter Zavodnyik Chicago class of 1992 Jan. 23 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
bering for "bonus points" because of their obsta­cles. Immigrants do not demand that the United States somehow change to eliminate their disad­vantages-they simply work even harder to overcome them. 
Another defense for affirmative action is that many minorities. especially inner-city blac~s. simply are not exposed -to the same opportunities as whites. This suggestion is false as well. Evidence from a 1999 study by the College Entrance Examination Board entitled "Group Differences in Standardized Testing and Social Satisfaction," shows that whites from families making less than $20,000 annually actually score higher than blacks from families earning over $60,000 a year. · 
Such disparity proves that "opportunity" alone cannot be responsible for differences in test scores. 
The most famous civil rights leader of all time, Martin Luther King .Jr., pleaded that all men be judged by merit, not by the color of their skin. Unfortunately, our current affirmative action policies do exactly what King argued against ­they are in place to award positions in jobs and universities to those of a different race, in such 
cases that those individuals would not be 
accepted on merit alone. Blacks compose only 12 percent of the population, but 7 5 percent 
of NBA players are black. Is it sensible then to place a quota on the number of blacks who can play in the NBA, so that the races 
are more evenly distrib­uted? Surely not; those players earned their 
places on merit. D'Souza concludes 
with the idea that the root of the problem for 
African-Americans 
(and other minori­ties) is that they are so focused on the crimes of the past that they are unable to see that there is in fact a clear path to a more successful future, if they 
would simply choose it. Instead of 
demanding that society lower the merit-bar so that they can compete, these groups should raise themselves and 
meet the current cri­teria. Instead of agitat­ing the system, demand­
ing reparations and rely­ing on pity in order to achieve, they should work within a system that is in fact unbiased to find the success that other minority groups have found. Racial minorities are not less quali­fied, t~l~nt~d or capable than the majority.

This may be true, D'Souza argues, but new immigran!s coming to America usually face even har~.her di~ad~~ntages. In addition to not fitting 
the American standard physically, immigrants must overcome a lack of credit, a lack of familial ~elations in the country and most importantly, an Immense language barrier. · 
However, one rarely hears of immigrants clam-solve the problems of the races, but sweeps an embarrassing reality under the rug and allows minor_itie~ t? retain the tragic notion that they are still VICtims of oppression.

Welsh Family Hall offers talented students a rare chance to dance 

By SHIELA FLYNN 
Scene Writer 
Before coming to Notre Dame last year, sophomore Mary Duhon spent her life on stage, dancing and performing. 
Then she enrolled in the University, and that stage was pulled out from under her. 
"As a freshman, I had come to the campus and, since I was a dancer, was looking for an outlet to dance," Duhon said. "There wasn't really anything that wasstrictly dance, as far as per­formance goes." 
So she took matters into her own hands and created some­thing that filled Washington Hall Saturday night with an enthusi­astic, cheering crowd and a litany of talented, excited dancers. 
The Welsh Family Hall Dance Show took the stage nearly nine months after Duhon initially sug­gested the idea to Welsh's hall council. Working through the dorm and Student Activities, Duhon. with show business man­ager Catherine Mulhern, obtained funding for advertising and booked Washington Hall. She took on the role of director and held auditions during the fall and selected 12 acts, reflect­ing a wide range of styles and abilities. 
"We wanted diversity," Duhon said. 
And the show achieved that, featuring everything from mem­bers of the Irish Step Dancers and Ballet Folklorico to routines of jazz, ballet, tap and swing. 
The dancers performed to a variety of tunes -ranging from Janet Jackson's "If' to Coldplay's "Politik" to the musical Chicago's "All That Jazz" -and the music, along with the energetic and skillful dancing, sparked the enthusiasm of the audience, whose clapping and cheering unquestionably pumped up the atmosphere of the already excit­ed dancers. 
"It was great -I could hear all my friends scream," said sophomore Meghan Winger, who has been dancing since she was two years old and whose family flew in from Florida to see her perform in the TroopND and bal­let routines. 
"The turnout was surprising ­there were so many more people there than I thought would be there," Winger said. 
Senior Luke Slonkosky, presi­dent of Notre Dame's Swing Club and one of the few male partici­pants in the show, agreed. Performing to Michael Buble's "Moondance," Slonkosky and dance partner Meg Dominick drew quite an energetic response from the audience. 
"They were a loud crowd, which was terrific," he said, adding that "there were so many more people" than he had ini­tially expected. 
The other acts were extremely well received, as well. The show opened with a routine to "Footloose," and the first act fol­lowed with Irish step dancing, a lyrical number, the swing dance, a solo performance, Ballet Folklorico and a spirited routine choreographed and presented by TroopND. After a brief intermis­sion, the second act opened with a jazz number to "If' and contin­ued with a ballet performance, another solo act, and a tap per­formance, finishing with another jazz number. 

"I was elated," Duhon said, adding that the show went "bet­
ter  than  I  could  have  ever  
expected.  
"Everyone  was very plea sed,"  
she said.  

That success, combined with the overwhelming turnout, has increased desire to present the show again next year. 
"It was a beautifully orches­trated dance show," Welsh rec­tor Candace Carson said. "We hope that next year the Welsh Family Dance Show will even attract more performers." 
And, in the opinions of this year's dancers, that won't be a problem. They said there is a great enthusiasm for perform­ance among dancers on campus, and those dancers not affiliated with groups such as the Porn Squad would love the chance to showcase their talents. 
"There's a pretty big empti­ness," Winger said, explaining the plight of those dancers not affiliated with the Porn Squad or not interested in hip-hop per­formance groups. "There's kind of nothing else for a dancer." 
Slonkosky voiced similar senti­ments. 
"You often see voice and act­ing," he said, "but dancing, I think, is the lost art."

Like many of the most insight­ful and best-directed movies from any year, some of them never even made it to Movies 14 on Edison. But thanks to NO Cinema. students live in places besides L.A. or New York have a chance to see these critically acclaimed films. 
Women in European Film 
When the Nanovic Institute for European Studies organized this year's European film exhi­bition, they decided to focus not just on films by women, but on films about women and issues they have faced. The Institute will sponsor one film every month for the rest of the semes­ter. 
Professor Daniel Mattern was one member of the committee responsible for deciding the theme and choosing the films. 
"We hoped to get a little more precise at some point," said. "But we were dealing with so many different countries, we just decided to choose seven films." 
The films sched­uled for this 
sion afterward. 
"One thing we're trying to do is to bring someone who can talk about a film, bring a context to it," Mattern said. "Sometimes it's hard to think about an issue while you're watching, but you can usually get more out of a film." 
"Chaos," scheduled for this Thursday. tells the story of a woman who becomes involved in the life of an Algerian prosti­tute after she sees her being sexually abused in an alley by men who turn out to be her pimps. 
"It describes the way that two people find each other through crimes by men," Mattern said. "It's kind of a drama and a comedy -I'd call it a drame­dy." 
Algerian playwright Alek Baylee Toumi \Vill introduce the film. Toumi teaches film, cul­ture studies. and francophone literatures at the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point. An Algerian refugee who lias not been able to return home for ten years. Toumi will offer unique insight into the issues involved in the film. 
In early February, the Institute will show the contro­versial Irish film "The Magdalene Sisters" by Scottish director Peter Mullan, who is also known for his 1996 film "Trainspotting." "The Magdalene Sisters" prompted apologies from the Catholic Church for the poor treatment 
of hundreds of women who were forced to work under inhumane conditions in the Magdalene laun­dries in Ireland. 
"Respiro," an Italian film released last year, tells the story of a young mother liv­ing on an island called Lampedusa off the coast of Sicily. Her free-

''I'm glad someone is coming to give this some context," Mattern said. "It will be good to have someone here to tell us what we can do about this." 
Race and Culture 
The Progressive Faculty and Staff Alliance, a new group started only last semester. cre­ated the Race and Culture film series. The Alliance is divided into subcommittees for different dents and faculty members will be asked to present a few questions about the film for anyone who wants to stay. eat and discuss. 

"It's meant to be short," Hachen said. "They've been asked to talk for only one or two minutes." 
The first film will be John Sales' 
"Lone Star," a film which deal with border issues in Southern Texas through the legend of Sheriff Buddy Deeds, who is supposed to have saved the town from corruption. When a 40-year-old rr.urder is discov­ered. it drags up a net of other issues as well. 
On Feb. 24, the group is bringing in director Paul Kell for the Midwest premier of his hip-hop documentary"5 Sides of a Coin." The documentary explores the five major ele­ments of hip-hop, including graffiti and brake dancing. Kell interviews some of the most respected hip-hop figures about the history of a genre that is having an increasingly large impact on many levels of American society.

NHL 
Sabres earn rare comeback win over Hurricanes 

Associated Press 

RALEIGH, N.C.-Jochen Hecht and Martin Biron showed the Buffalo Sabres how to rally from a deficit. 
Hecht had two goals and Biron made 37 saves, helping the Sabres erase a two-goal deficit and beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-2 Sunday for a rare comeback win. 
Derek Roy's third-period goal put the Sabres ahead to stay, and Milan Bartovic added a goal and an assist. 
Entering the game. the Sabres were 4-18-2 when they allowed the first goal, and 1­12-1 when trailing after the first period. But none of that mattered Sunday as the Sabres took advantage of mis­takes by Carolina goaltender Jamie Storr. 
"It doesn't happen very often," Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. "It would've been an easy game to go the other way, but we came back." 
Erik Cole and Kevyn Adams scored for the Hurricanes, who had a 39-21 advantage in shots. 
Roy's second goal of the sea­son gave the Sabres the lead and sent Carolina to its fourth straight home loss. 
After a turnover by defense­man Bruno St. Jacques in the Carolina zone, Bartovic shot on Storr, who made the save but failed to control the puck. Roy pushed the rebound into the left side of the net at 5:15 for a 3-2 lead. 
It was just one of three goals that came off miscues by Storr. 
The Sabres scored twice off rebounds. Bartovic scored Buffalo's first goal off a shot by Andy Delmore, poking the puck past Storr at 3:55 of the second period. 
Hecht scored an insurance goal when he stole Storr's pass along the boards and beat the goaltender back to the net at 
18:31 of the third. Storr, the backup to Kevin Weekes, took responsibility for the loss. 

Devils 3, Thrashers 2 
Jeff Friesen has been a 
streaky goal scorer since com­
ing to the New Jersey Devils, 
and it appears he's on another 
run. 
After going 10 games with­
out a goal, Friesen scored his 
third in four games early in 
the third period to lead the 
Devils to a victory over the 
Atlanta Thrashers. 
"Sometimes you get in 
slumps and, for whatever rea­
son, guys don't get on the 
same page," Friesen said. 
"Sometimes it's a frustrating 
rut to get out of, but I feel I'm 
out of the rut now and I'm 
starting to contribute offen­
sively." 
Friesen scored his third 
game-winning goal of the sea­
son by taking advantage of a 
bad play by Thrashers super­
star Ilya Kovalchuk, whose 
first career short-handed goal 
minutes earlier had tied the 
game at 2. 
Kovalchuk had just been 
stopped on a three-on-one 
break, when the Devils then 
counterattacked. 
Kovalchuk eventually got the 
puck along the side boards, 
but he made an ill advised 
pass across the middle of his 
own zone. 
Friesen read the play. 
"I just went to the lane where I saw he was trying to throw it," Friesen said. "Obviously, you're a little sur­prised. It just came right on my stick. It was a big goal because this is a big win for the team." 
It was a big disappointment for Kovalchuk. 
"I can't give chances like this," Kovalchuk said. "If I want to be a leader on this team I have to play smarter." 
Flyers 4, Capitals 1 
Mark Recchi and John LeClair took full advantage of the short-handed Washington Capitals. 
Recchi and LeClair each had a goal and three assists in leading the Philadelphia Flyers to a victory. 
"What, are you surprised that we played a good game?" LeClair asked. "I think we're all feeling pretty comfortable. It's a good mix and it definitely worked well for us tonight." 
Michal Handzus and Kim Johnsson also scored to help the Flyers win for the fifth time in their last six games. 
Washington played with just five defensemen. Sergei Gonchar injured a shoulder Friday night in a loss in Florida, and Josef Boumedienne was scratched because of food poisoning 
"It's huge, we really only have two defense that have a lot of NHL experience," Washington's Mike Grier said about Gonchar. "He's the lead­ing point-getter for defense­men in the league and to lose him is a nuge blow." 
Recchi opened the scoring at 
5:30 of the first period, beat­ing goalie Rastislav Stana with a wrist shot after LeClair's strong play to keep the puck in offensive zone. 
LeClair made it 2-0 less than three minutes later, tipping a shot behind Stana, who start­ed in place of Olaf Kolzig for the first time since being recalled from Portland on Jan. 6.

MLB 


Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Wearing their finest evening clothes, Alex Rodriguez and the Texas Rangers tried to put a formal end to their troubled offseason filled with trade talk and tension. 
At an unusual news con­ference in which everyone wore tuxedos, the Rangers appointed Rodriguez their captain on Sunday night. 
In town to accept the American League MVP award, Rodriguez met for five hours in the hotel suite of Rangers owner Tom Hicks, with gener.al 

manager John Hart and manager Buck Showalter joining in. Afterward, the quartet proclaimed the start of a new era that they hoped would culmi­nate in Texas' first World Series title. 
"I definitely think I'm going to be here for a long time," Rodriguez said. ''I'm probably pretty sure it will work out for the best." 
Texas wanted to get out from the burden of the record $252 million, 10­year contract it signed Rodriguez to after the 2000 season, and the seven-time All-Star short­stop was frustrated follow­ing three last-place finish­es with the Rangers. Texas then agreed last month to a tentative trade that would have sent the seven-time All-Star short­stop to Boston for outfield­er Manny Ramirez. 
"It looked like there might be a situation that would be win, win, win," Hicks said. 
But the deal was contin­gent on A-Rod agreeing to restructure his contract, and the players' associa­tion vetoed the proposal made by Boston, saying it would have reduced the deal's value by $28 million to $30 million. The union made a counteroffer that would have cut $12 million to $13 million, a proposal Boston found unaccept­able. The trade then col­lapsed. 
"This was an unpleasant experience but probably a necessary one," Hart said. 
Showalter said he had been thinking of making Rodriguez captain for the past year, but Hicks wasn't aware of the plan until halfway through Sunday's meeting. 
"I feel a grand responsi­bility not only to the Texas Rangers but to our fans," Rodriguez said, adding that he was touched by the gesture, especially given that he's only 28 years old. 
IN BRIEF 

Mickelson wins playoff to 
end victory drought 

LA QUINTA, Calif. -Phil Mickelson showed he's back on his game after a disappointing year, beating Skip Kendall on the first playoff hole Sunday in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
The victory ended an 18-month winless streak for Mickelson, who dropped from second to 16th in the world· rankings. 
He rolled a 3-foot birdie putt into the center of the cup to win the Hope, his second victory in the tournament in two years. 
Kendall was left still looking for his first tour win. He was runner-up for the fourth time in his career, losing three times in playoffs. 
Mickelson, making his 2004 debut, closed with a 4-under 68 to match Kendall (65) at 30-under 330 in the 90-hole tournament. 
After each birdied the final hole, they returned to the 18th tee to begin the playoff. Both hit their drives down the center, then Kendall pulled his second shot into the left rough beside the green on the 543-yard par 
5. Mickelson's second shot went into the rough on the other side, but con­siderably closer to the hole. 
Kendall chipped onto the putting surface, then missed his 20-foot birdie try. Mickelson's chip left him the short putt, and he confidently stroked it in to wrap up a day when he had some problems on the green. 
Jay Haas, 50, the 1988 tournament champion and runner-up to Mike Weir a year ago, finished third with a 6 7 that left him one shot behind Mickelson and Kendall. NASCAR's new tires and rules to be tested 
lAS VEGAS, Nev.-New tires and some new aerodynamics rules have turned the annual preseason test at Las Vegas Motor Speedway into a must for most of the top NASCAR teams. 
"It's going to be important for everybody," said Ryan Pemberton, crew chief for Joe Nemechek. 
"We're going to learn a lot about the new rules, the bodies, where we're at and what direction we need to go in -if we need to make more downforce or take some downforce off the front or what." 
The four days of testing on the 1 1/2-mile LVMS oval, beginning Monday, will be different than the work that has been going on the last two weeks at Daytona International Speedway, where the new rules, cut­ting three-quarters of an inch ofT the rear spoilers -do not come into play because of the use of carburetor restrictor plates to slow the cars on the big track. 
The majority of the races on the 36­race schedule are run on the so­called intermediate tracks -1 1/2­or 2-mile ovals -like Las Vegas, and everyone wants to know what the combination of softer tires, the short­er rear spoilers to cut downforce and several new templates to make the cars less aerodynamic will do.

Seminoles top Deacons 75-70 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -Tim 
Pickett's second strong finish 
made some history for Florida 
State. · The Seminoles, with Pickett again having a big second half, beat No. 10 Wake Forest 75-70, giving them consecu­tive wins over Top Ten teams for the first time in school his­tory. 
He scored all of his 18 points 
after halftime Sunday and 
Florida State made six straight 
free throws over the final 45 
seconds to hand the Demon 
Deacons' their fourth straight 
loss. 
Last Thursday, Pickett 
scored 22 points after halftime 
to spark the Seminoles to a 
90-81 overtime victory over 
No. 7 North Carolina. 
Up next is No. 1 Duke on Thursday. 
"In all my years of coaching I've never been part of a sce­nario where your team is on the rise and you play the 10th, the seventh, then have a chance to go play the No. 1­ranked team," Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said. "You have to be realistic where we are. We're still a team that's developing, that's trying to move our program to a program of significance in the ACC as well as on a national basis." 
Wake Forest (11-4, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), has reached those levels, but the Demon Deacons added a loss to the list that included Texas, Duke and Georgia Tech. 
No. 5 Louisville 65, Tennessee 62 
Louisville needed a spark, and got it from the full-court press. 
Francisco Garcia scored 24 
points and the fifth-ranked 
Cardinals rallied in the second 
half for their 15th straight vic­
tory in a win over Tennessee. 
Louisville (15-1) regained 
the lead for the first time since 
the opening minutes and took 
control with a 12-0 run mid­
way through the second half. 
No. 14 Arizona 90, Oregon 
66 
Arizona's big first half was 
no accident. The Wildcats 
went up against Oregon hop­
ing for a quick start. 
"We wanted a game where 
we could come out and jump 
on them," said Hassan Adams, 
who had 20 points in the 14th­
ranked Wildcats' victory over 
the Ducks. "We felt this would 
be a great opportunity to work 
on that." 
Channing Frye had 18 points and 11 rebounds and Ivan Radenovic had a season-high 19 points, 15 in the first half when the Wildcats (13-3, 5-2 Pac-10) had an 18-0 run on the way to a 25-point halftime lead. 
"The first half was just spec­tacular," Arizona coach Lute Olson said. "Defensively, we created a lot of problems for Oregon, and it was very hard for them to get many good looks." 
Radenovic, a freshman from Serbia playing in his ninth col­lege game, also had eight rebounds, and Arizona had a 42-30 edge on the boards against a team that had outre­bounded nine of 13 previous opponents. 
Andre Iguodala added 14 points for the Wildcats, who won their third straight since a two-game skid knocked them out of the Top Ten. 

Luke Jackson had 20 points, 
six rebounds and six assists 
for Oregon (9-5, 4-3), while 
Ian Crosswhite scored 11 
points and Mitch Platt had 10. 
No. 23 Purdue 76, Michigan 
St. 70, OT 

As Brandon McKnight rose 
to take the biggest shot of the 
game in overtime, Purdue 
coach Gene Keady already 
knew what was going to hap­
pen. 

"I saw the determination in 
his face when he took that 
jumper," Keady said. "It said, 
'Hey we're going to win this 
thing.'" 

Keady's intuition was right. 
McKnight's jumper gave No. 
23 Purdue the lead for good in 
its win over Michigan State. 

It also capped a brilliant final 25 minutes for McKnight, who finished with 10 points, seven assists and three steals. He got Purdue into the over­time, then made sure his effort wasn't wasted. 
McKnight drove the length of the floor for a layup with 8 seconds to go that forced over­time, then hit his jumper that propelled Purdue to its fourth straight win. 
"All I was thinking was just attack," McKnight said of his game-tying drive. "I didn't see anybody in front of me, so I just went with it." 
The victory moved Purdue (14-4, 4-1) into a three-way tie with Wisconsin and Indiana for first place in the Big Ten and set up a showdown with the rival Hoosiers on Tuesday in Bloomington. 
Kenneth Lowe led the Boilermakers with 18 points and Brett Buscher sr,ored 13 of his 17 after halftime.

Longhorns hold off instate rival Aggies 
Associated Press 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas ­
Texas had to overcome 22 
turnovers and guard Toccara 
Williams to beat Texas A&M. 
Tiffany Jackson had 15 points 
and 11 rebounds, and Heather 
Schreiber made the go-ahead 
free throw and a 3-pointer in the 
closing minutes, helping the 
Longhorns hold off Texas A&M. 
Texas (17-2, 5-1 Big 12) got off 
to a slow start and need a 
charge to take a 32-30 halftime 
lead over the Aggies (7-10, 0-6), 
who tied the game at 56 with 4 
minutes to ptay. 
Schreiber's free throw with 
3:59 left put the Longhorns ahead to stay at 57-56 and her 3-pointrer 30 seconds later made it 60-56. 
"Heather hit some really clutch shots for us," Texas coach Jody Conradt said. "She strug­gled early and we depend on her so much. Our opponents try to keep her out of the game. A lot of energy was extended doing that, but she hit some big shots down the stretch and that gave us some energy and momen­tum." 
No. 20 Michigan State 72, No. 
9 Minnesota 69 
Lindsay Whalen's record-set­ting game wasn't enough to lead No. 9 Minnesota past No. 20 Michigan State. 
Lindsay Bowen scored 18 points, and Kelli Roehrig made the go-ahead basket with 19 sec­onds left, leading Michigan State past Minnesota. 
The loss spoiled a big game for Whalen, who scored a game­high 27 points to become the school's career scoring leader with 2,123. 
The Gophers lost their third straight game, all against ranked opponents, and slipped to fourth place in the Big Ten after a 4-0 start. 
"You can't let one week in 

January affect your whole sea­
son," said Whalen, who hit a 
personal-best seven 3-pointers. 
"We have to move on, put it out 
of our heads and play the 
game." 
Minnesota (15-3, 4-3 Big Ten) 

took a 69-68 lead on Whalen's 
basket with just over a minute 
left. She was fouled on the play 
but missed the free throw. 
USC 59, No. 6 Stanford 56 
Southern California wasn't 

about to let Stanford run away 
with the Pac-10 title. 
Ebony Hoffman scored 16 

points, including two free throws 
with 21 seconds remaining, to 
help USC rally past No. 6 
Stanford, handing the Cardinal 
their first conference loss of the 
season. 
Trojans coach Chris Gobrecht 

called it an "ugly" victory. 
"But we feel we're in the con­

ference race now," Gobrecht 
said. "A loss would have put us 
three games out." 
USC (10-7, 7-2 Pac-10) over­came a 12-point deficit and outscored the Cardinal 23-8 in the final 8:41. Hoffman was the only Trojans player who scored in double figures, including a perfect 7-for-7 from the foul line. 
"It's not good for the confer­ence if one team sails through undefeated," Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. 
Nicole Powell led the Cardinal {15-3, 8-1) with 29 points, including 22 in the second half, and 12 rebounds. She sustained a slightly sprained right ankle but returned after sitting out for · about a minute. 
Both teams shot poorly from the field in the first half, which ended with the Cardinal leading 24-23 on a 3-pointer from the baseline by Susan King Borchardt at the buzzer. The Trojans went nine minutes with­out a field goal in the half.

NO SWIMMING AND DIVING 
Irish nearly knock 
off Northwestern 
By MATT PUGLISI 
Sports Writer 
The men's swimming and 
diving team just missed pulling 
off a big upset in Evanston, Ill., 
Saturday afternoon, narrowly 
falling to No. 15 Northwestern, 
155-133. 
"[Northwestern] is a pretty 
highly-ranked team, but we 
hung in there with them the 
whole way," sophomore Tyler 
Grenda said. "We wanted to 
finish out the road season real­
ly well, and this was a good 
conclusion to all our road .meets this year." 
While Notre Dame's impres­sive depth allowed the squad to claim two of the top three spots in 10 of the 12 races and at least three of the top five spots in 13 of the 14 swimming events, the Irish (5-7) managed only a trio of first place finish­es in the 16 overall competi­tions. 
Three freshmen -Ted Brown (200-yard freestyle), Louis Cavadini (100-yard freestyle) and Scott Coyle (1­meter board) -were the lone victors for the Irish. Also, each recorded runner-up finishes as Brown, Cavadini and Coyle took second in the 500-vard freestyle, 50-yard freestyle and 3-meter board, respectively. 
In addition to the trio of freshmen, a number of Notre Dame swimmers turned in strong meets, including fresh­men Tim Kegelman (second in both 100-and 200-yard but­terfly, third in 200-yard indi­vidual medley) and Alan Carter (second in 200-yard back­stroke, fourth in 200-yard 
backstroke), sopQ.omores Tim 
Randolph (second in 1 00-yard 
breaststroke, third in 100-yard 
freestyle). Grenda (second in 
200-yard breaststroke, third in 
100-yard breaststroke) and 
Steve Shamberger (second in 
200-yard backstroke, third in 
100-yard backstroke). 
Several upperclassmen got in on the scoring as well, as junior Frank Krakowski took third in 100-yard butterfly and 50-yard freestyle and senior co-captain Matt Obringer placed second in 200-yard freestyle. 
Although the Irish were suc­cessful in gobbling a majority of the second, third, fourth and fifth place spots, their inability to keep the Wildcats out of first in the individual races ulti­mately brought about their downfall. 
The loss to Northwestern marks the end of a long road trip that saw Notre Dame go 4­2, falling only to No. 17 Pittsburgh and the No. 15 Wildcats. 
"With the past couple weeks, we've pretty much spent it all on the road, from being in California for a little more than a week and a half, coming back for a couple days, then going to Pittsburgh and then to Northwestern [Saturday]," Grenda said. "But, we've done really well week after week on the road." 
After hosting St. Bonaventure Saturday, the Irish will challenge Cleveland State Feb. 6 and Oakland Feb. 7.

Irish suffer a pair of heartbreakers 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Writer 

Close, but no cigar. No 
points, either. 

The Irish (12-9-3, 8-8-2 in 
CCHA) dropped a pair of one 
goal games to Northern 
Michigan (12-11-1, 10-10-0) 
this weekend, falling 4-3 in 
overtime Friday night and 1-0 
Saturday. The Wildcats exact­
ed a bit of revenge on Notre 
Dame, who defeated Northern 
Michigan in a home sweep 
earlier this season at the Joyce 
Center. 

For the third consecutive 
week, the Irish opened a road 
series with a game that went 
into overtime, with the previ­
ous two a 5-4 overtime loss to 
Bowling Green Jan. 9 and a 2­
2 tie against Wisconsin Jan. 
17. 

Wildcat forward Daren Olver 
scored the winning goal Friday 
with just 45 seconds left in the 
extra frame. 

Notre Dame has struggled with consistency this year, defeating several ranked teams but having difficulty making any major strides in the conference standings. They are 1-5 in their last six CCHA contests. 
The Irish were unable to take advantage of quality play from senior forward Rob Globke, who had two goals on the weekend. Senior captain Aaron Gill also scored two points in Friday's game, pick­ing up a goal and an assist. 
The combination of Gill and Globke scored seven of the eight goals the Irish have scored in their past four games. 
Junior Morgan Cey started in net Friday for the Irish, mak­ing 28 saves. Freshman David

Brown allowed only one goal 
Saturday, collecting 22 saves, 
but was bested by senior Craig 
Kowalski's shutout. 
Kowalski made a combined 
48 saves in the two Northern 
Michigan victories. 
Friday, Northern Michigan got on the scoreboard first as Jamie Milan scored a power play goal just a little over halfway into the first period. The second period was full of end-to-end action, as both teams scored two goals in the frame. 
Notre Dame scored the first two goals of the second, giving the Irish a 2-1 lead. Gill col­lected his ninth goal of the year nine minutes into the period, and Globke followed a little more than three minutes later. 
That lead was short lived, as Northern Michigan tied the game just 19 seconds later, with Nathan Oystrick collect­ing a rebound of a Alan Swanson shot and flipping it past Cey. 
Bobby Selden regained the lead for Northern Michigan with less than two minutes left in the second. flipping a shot past a screened Cey for the goal. 
The Irish tied the game back up at 6:29 of the third period, 
with Globke scoring his second 
goal of the game. It was his 
team-best 15th goal of the sea­
son. 
Olver's overtime goal dropped Notre Dame to 0-2-3 in overtime this season. The Irish have not won in the extra frame since a win against Miami {Ohio) Jan. 25, 2002. 
Saturday, the Irish put a lot of pressure on Kowalski, out­shooting the Wildcats 27-23. They were unable to solve the Wildcat goalie, however, who collected his fourth shutout of the season. 
Oystrick scored the only goal in the game for Northern Michigan, scoring on a slap shot that deflected past Brown with a little less than four min­utes left in the first period. 
Oystrick, the CCHA's leading scoring defenseman, collected three points on the weekend {two goals, one assist) and played a part in both game­winning goals for the Wildcats. 
The Irish return home for the first time in 2004 this weekend, facing fourth-place Alaska-Fairbanks. Face-off Friday is 7:35 p.m., and Saturday's face-off is sched­uled for 7:05 p.m.

The 35 points Syracuse scored was the least allowed by the Irish in a Big East road game. Notre Dame only gave up 16 points in the first half, setting the tone for the rest of the game.

the challenge. They employed a switching defense that didn't allow the Wildcats to get good looks at the hoop. 
"Their defense was very good, they switched the screens real well," Villanova coach Harry Perretta said. 
Notre Dame found success in its team defense, as the Irish were able to guard anyone on the court interchangeably, making the switches on screens very effec­tive. 
"I thought it was a great team effort defensively because every­body had to guard a lot of differ­ent people," McGraw said. "I thought we handled their offense about as well as we can." 
Villanova was held to 25.6 per­cent shooting, and went 0-for-7 from beyond the arc in the sec­ond half. The Irish held the Wildcats to 18 points in both halves, making it four consecu­tive halves that the Notre Dame defense has held its opponent to 20 points or less. Villanova came into the game averaging 61.7 points per game on 41.6 percent shooting. 
Against the Wildcats, who like to control the tempo of a game, the defense of the Irish made all the difference in the end result. 
"They run the offense to perfec­tion," McGraw said. "We feel good about the defense because we know how good their offense is."

MEN'S TENNIS 
Irish experience both ends of the spectrum 
By KATE GALES 
Sports Writer 

Irish coach Bob Bayliss had an analogy to sum up his squad's weekend performance. 
"Sometimes you're the bug," Bayliss observed wryly, "and sometimes you're the wind­shield." 
The men's tennis team had a taste of both roles this weekend, as a disappointing loss to No. 9 Texas A&M was offset by decisive wins against St. John's and Illinois State. 
"We played almost well enough to win this match," Bayliss said of the 5-2 loss to the Aggies. "We had enough windows of opportu­nity -if we had capitalized on all of them, it would have been a different [outcome]." 
Irish No. 4 Stephen Bass and No.6 Eric Langencamp were the only players to post points against the Aggies. Bass won 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7 -5) over Khaled El Dorry, and Langencamp beat Bryan Wooten 6-4, 6-3. 
Notre Dame's No. 1 Luis Haddock lost 6-1, 6-3 to Lester Cook, ranked No. 17 nationally in singles play. At No. 2, Matthew Scott fell 6-1, 6-1 to Ante Matijevic, ranked No. 19. 
At three, Mohamed Dakki beat Notre Dame's Brent D'Amico by a score of 7-5, 6-4 to clinch the match for Texas A&M, and fresh­man Barry King was defeated by Brett Joelson 6-2, 7-5 at six. 
"We let them off the hook in doubles," Bayliss said. "We just didn't have enough first serves. In singles, they were so dominant at one and two, they jumped out 3-0, which took a lot of pressure ofT [the bottom three]." 
In doubles, Cook and Matijevic, ranked No. 1 in the nation, defeated Haddock and Ryan Keckley, ranked No. 18, by a score of 8-6. At two, Dakki and Joelsom beat D'Amico and Scott 8-4, while Bass·and King fell to Ell Dorry and Zack Malmgren 8­6. 
"Friday was a tough match," Scott said, "against a good Texas A&M team." 
Sunday was a different story, however, as Notre Dame swept St. John's 6-0, winning all singles matches in two sets. 
"These were matches we expected to win," Bayliss said. "St. John's will [probably] qualify for the Big East Tournament, and it's important to win decisively over Big East opponents." 
The Irish lost only 27 games to St. Johns, an average of 4.5 per match. At the No. 1 spot, Haddock clinched the match for Notre Dame, defeating David Nylen 6-3, 6-1. At two, Scott posted a 6-3, 6-4 win over Aurelio Di Zazzo and Brent D'Amico topped Louis Desmerteaux 6-4, 6-1 at three. 
At four, Bass defeated Nick Stocker 6-1, 6-3, and King beat Morgan Bauer 6-1, 6-2. Langenkamp remained consis­tent by topping Boris Chiporukha 6-1,6-3 at No.6. 

Doubles were not played. Bayliss had hoped to clinch the match in singles and "substitute liberally in the doubles matches," he said Friday. The team's solid singles play, however, meant the players had a longer break before facing Illinois State at 2 pm. 
"We expected to win," Haddock said of the match against the Red Storm. "The good thing was that we won every set. It's hard to come out fired up against a lower level team, especially after not playing [for a day]." 
It was Haddock's first match victory of the spring season. 
Despite the quick turnaround, the Irish came out strong against Illinois State, posting a 6-1 win over the Redbirds. 
Notre Dame took all six singles matches, allowing the team to showcase its depth in doubles. 
"It was the best I've played this season," Haddock said of his 6-3, 6-1 win over Ben Cappuccitti at No. 1. "He's not as good as other players I've played, but I felt good about [my performance)." 
At No. 2, Scott defeated Benjamin Pettinari, also by a score of 6-3, 6-1. An arm injury kept D'Amico on the sidelines for the Illinois State match, moving Bass, a freshman, to the third spot. Bass rose to the challenge, winning over Djordje Uskokovic 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. 
At four, King defeated Nogrobat 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, and Langenkamp beat Alban Renard 6-0, 6-1 in the first match to fin­ish. No.6 Pat Buchanan won 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 over Alfredo Lagarda. 
In doubles, Paul Hidaka and Ryan Keckley defeated Chris Cozad and Pettinari 8-3. However, Guillermo Gomez and Renard beat Notre Dame's Ben Hatten and Bobby McNally 8-6 to clinch the match, with Cappucciti and Tim Link winning over Jimmy Bass and Nick Chimerakis 8-3 to get the point for St. John's. 
"This win is significant because we have three players unavail­able," Bayliss said. D'Amico's

shoulder injury, Keckley's recent recovery from an ankle injury and Irackli Akhvendiani's case of the flu forced the Irish to rely on a deep roster. 
"It speaks well of the depth of our team," Bayliss said. ''I'm dis­appointed we didn't come out faster -three guys lost in first sets-but came back to win." 
Scott is also coming off a leg injury, and did not play a full doubles match from October 2003 until last Saturday's victory at Indiana. 
"We're really deep," Scott said of Sunday's contest. "When guys like Pat [Buchanan] come up, their role is to be ready if called upon, and Pat did a great job stepping up at the last minute."

HOROSCOPE 

Sharing this birthday: Wayne Gretzky, Anita Baker, Paul Newman, Eddie Van Halen, Scott Glenn, Angela Davis, Jules Feiffer, Andrew Ridgeley, Ellen DeGeneres 
Happy Birthday: Your vision will be broad this year. You can offer great suggestions, but don't waste your time if others don't want to follow your lead. Go it alone if necessary and you'll be the one who accomplishes the most. Overdoing it can be your greatest downfall. Know your limits, know when to say no, and do for yourself first. Your numbers: 4, 17, 19, 23, 28, 35 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Don't let anyone talk you into doing things that you'd prefer not to do. You need to please yourself for a change instead of everyone else. It's time to follow your own beliefs and not someone else's. *** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You are beginning to see things through different eyes. Your awareness is growing, and your motives are changing. Don't be afraid to follow a new direction. You must take control of your future.**** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Financial failures are likely if you expanded your interests too quickly. Look into ways of helping children or relatives solve their problems without donating your own funds. *** CANCER (June 21-July 22): You will have regrets if you allow a dispute to get out of hand. Be cautious how you handle both your business and emotional partnerships. *** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Look into career opportunities that will lead to a higher earning potential. You need to use your ingenuity if you want to get ahead. Believe in yourself and so will others.*** VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Words of love will be dancing through your head. Get out with that special person in your life. You need to spend time enjoying the finer things in life. **** LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Uncertainties on the home front should not be cause for alarm. A move is evident, and the problems that exist will be eliminated. Just bide your time and let things unfold as they may. **** SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Clear up that overdue correspondence. Don't get intimate with colleagues or involved in gossip at work. Pleasure trips will break your budget. Be prepared to make cutbacks.** SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You would be wise not to be tempted to take part in joint financial ventures. You may have difficulties with your stomach if you overindulge or eat spicy foods. *** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Your emotions are likely to take over today. It is best to work by yourself. Don't let anyone goad you into a debate. You really need your peace and quiet. *** 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Making changes to your home, particularly in your rec room or home-entertainment center, will help ensure that your family will spend more time together. *** PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Your need to interact with others can be satisfied if you sign up to help worthy organizations. You have a knack for putting things together well, and for paying close attention to small but important details. Your services will be valued. *** 
Birthday Baby: You have a fascinating way of looking at life. You are ingenious, outgoing and forever trying to help others. You have a great desire to do something worthwhile.

History doesn't repeat itself 
Irish comeback bid falls short against No. 9 Kentucky in 30-year reunion of 71-70 upset of No. 1 UCLA 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 

For the fleetest moment, histo­ry seemed on the verge of repeating itself. 
Notre Dame had fought back from a double-digit deficit at home with a furious rally at the end of the second half. The Joyce Center crowd stood on its feet. trying to will the Irish to a spectacular come-from-behind win against a highly ranked foe. Even the members of the Notre Dame team that knocked off No. 1 UCLA 30 years ago, who returned for a halftime reunion but had spent the rest of the game in their seats, arose with a yell. 
But 2004 isn't 1974. 
And the upset the majority of the Joyce Center wanted never happened. 
So this year's version of the Irish, despite cutting a 15-point deficit to three, couldn't com­plete the rally as its home strug­gles continued in a 71-63 loss to No.9 Kentucky.

"I worked for a three at the end to try and relieve the fans and watching public of having to watch the game any­more," Perretta said. "If we made it, the game was over. If we missed it, the game ·was over so nobody had to watch anymore of it." 
In a game where neither team scored more than 20 points in a half. Jacqueline Batteast sank two free throws with 17.5 seconds left to give the Irish a 38-36 victory. The 38 points were Notre Dame's lowest total ever at the Joyce Center and the second lowest by an Irish team in a game anywhere. 
Batteast, who played with a sprained right wrist, shot just 2-for-14 from the field but hit all 10 of her free throws to fin­ish the game with 14 points and nine rebounds. Guard Megan Duffy added 10 points including a clutch 3-pointer with 2:02 left to tie the game at 36-36 and give the Irish

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 
Three commit, none A-list players 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 

Tyrone Willingham and the 
Irish are waiting on word from 
a few A-list players -includ­
ing defensive end Darryl 
Richard and defensive back 
Cortney Grixby. 

In the meantime, coaches 
are working to lure the best 
remaining talent to South 
Bend in the late stages of a 
tough recruiting season. 

Notre Dame received three 
more verbal commitments this 
weekend from defensive end 
Justin Brown. cornerback 
Junior Jabbie and quarterback 
Darrin Bragg, ESPN recruiting 
analyst Tom Lemming said. 

The number of commitments 
has reached 14, and Lemming 
believes that number could 
increase soon. 

"It looks like [offensive line­
man] Allen Smith is coming [to 
Notre Darnel." Lemming said. 

Smith stands 6-foot-5, 325 
pounds and was heavily 
recruited by Pac-1 0 schools 
and Miami. He attended 
Corona del Sol High School in 
Tempe, Ariz. 

Lemming also said he 
believes New Jersey defensive 
back Leo Ferrine has made his 
decision to join the Irish. 

But there is a problem lying 
within this weekend's commit­
ments, however, even if the 
Ferrine rumors are true. 

"Smith is the only heavily 
recruited one," Lemming said. 
Darius Walker's verbal com­
mitment to Notre Dame 
Thursday afternoon was a 
huge step for the Irish recruit­
ing staff. as Walker is an A-list 
running back -a player that 
coaches had pegged as a pri­
ority from the beginning. 

The problem now -just 'over a week from signing day, 
Feb. 4 -is that not many A­
list players remain on the 
board. 

Brown, a 6-foot-4, 225­
pound defensive end who 
could play linebacker. and 
Jabbie -5-foot-11, 175 
pounds -were not the first or 
perhaps second options for 
Notre Dame coaches, but the 
success of other schools' 
recruiting staffs has left the 
Irish in a desperate situation 
to scramble last-minute. 

Lemming believes Notre

Inexperienced Irish have much to learn 
Just over a week later, the Irish haven't learned their les­son. 
One of the premier pro­grams in college basketball came to the Joyce Center on national television and gave the Irish a chance to get a much­needed win over a ranked team. 
But once again, this young and immature team let a golden opportunity to improve its postseason resume slip through its hands. 
Leading up to this game, Irish coach Mike Brey and his team talked about staying within itself in front of the energized home crowd. Right
