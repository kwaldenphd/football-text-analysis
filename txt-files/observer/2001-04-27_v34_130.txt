Structural repairs close parts of Stadium 
University plans for new, modern engineering building 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER News Writer 
In an effort to have facilities of a caliber equal to the facul­ty, the University plans to construct a new multidisciplinary engineering learning and research facility to open in four years. 
"We have a very distinguished faculty. but our current facilities are far less distinguished," said Frank Incropera, Dean of Engineering. "Our facilities lag seriously behind those at other schools and this kind of space is imperative to retain and attract students and faculty." 
The building will contain a commons area on the first floor, a large learning c.enter, a nanotechnology laboratory and a materials synthesis laboratory, each occupying about one­third of the building's space, projected to be approximately the same size as the current law school. 
According Incropera, the new building will emphasize interactive learning using hands-on projects and testing. working in teams and working on projects that incorporate the curriculum ofmultiple engineering schools. 
In addition to serving a lab and learning facility, the goal is that the building's commons area will be inviting and facili­tate discussion. 
"We want to make it a building people want to be in and will stimulate interactions. We hope the facility will encour­age communication, community and collaboration,'' said Incropera. 
The learning center will occupy the rest of the space on the first floor. and at 16,000 sq. ft. will be almost four times larg­er than the current learning center 1hat opened this year in Cushing Hall to support the new Introduction to Engineering program for first year studen1S. 
"The learning center will continue to service the needs of first year students and with the new building. we would not be surprised if the number of first year students increases from 300 to 400," said Incropera. 
The new Learning Center will also be used for multidiscipli­nary activities that require collaboration between curriculum of more 1han one department in the college ofengineering. 
A large grant from the General Electric foundation will support the development of these multidisciplinary modules to be used in the new facility. Work on the design of the modules \\-ill begin now so that when the new building opens there will be programs ready to use the facility.

Recycling program grows 
By MYRA McGRIFF 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
After a year of planning, the Saint Mary's Student Environmental Action Coalition [SEAC] has reached a pivotal stage in instituting a cam­pus wide recycling program. Currently working with the administration, SEAC hopes to see action taken soon. 
The idea for a recycling program spawned from inquiries during Activities Night in the fall of 1999. It was the first time SEAC set up a booth and the response they got was favorable. Students were interested in Saint Mary's recycling program, especially questioning why there was no one pro­gram for recycling plastic and glass on campus. Teresa Lorenz, president of SEAC and other members knew they had to respond. 
"So many of the people that signed up for the club would ask us if we could do something about glass and plastic recycling," said Lorenz.

The upper bowl and concourse of the Notre Dame Stadiwn will be off-limits to spectators at Saturday's Blue Gold Game as a result of repairs to the stadium the University begun in December. 
The repairs are addressing structural problems that appeared after the expansion and renova­tion of the stadium in 1997, including cracked concrete and failed hand rails and joints. The University is paying for the repairs at the same time they are pursu­ing litigation against Ellerbe Becket, Inc, the stadium project's architect and engineer, and Casteel Construction Corporation, the general contractor of the pro­ject. The outcome of this litigation will determine who ultimately pays for the repairs. 
According to Director of Public Relations Dennis Moore, construc­tion equipment will remain on site Saturday so repairs can resume on Monday, but construction debris has been cleaned up. 
"We're going to make sure the equipment doesn't impede fans going in and out of the stadium. The area will be cleaned up and any dust will be eliminated," Moore said. 
The University first became aware of design flaws during the addition's inaugural game Sept. 6, 1997 against Georgia Tech, when the stadium flooded with water and sewage before the start of the game. The suit alleges Ellerbe Beckett failed to design an ade­quate water supply system for the stadium and did not notify the University that the sewage line in place needed repairs or upgrades. The suit claims the company erred in estimating the expected volume of toilets flushing at peak times before. during and after the game . The suit also claims that Castell did not test the water and sewage systems before the first game to insure they worked properly. 
Fans should not become accus­tomed to seeing the stadium under construction because this stage of work will be completed during the swnmer and construc­tion equipment and supplies· will be removed before the first game of the year on Sept. 22.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Covering the CLC 
Seth Whetzel had a few things right about pari­
etals. 
Pushing for an extension to the opposite-sex vis­
iting hours, Whetzel, a Campus Life Cowicil mem­
ber and sophomore St. Edward's Hall resident, 
made sense in action and in 
speech at the CLC meeting 
Monday. 
'This is simply a request for 
members of the opposite sex 
to have more hours each day 
to interact with each other in 
the privacy of their own 
rooms," Whetzel told the 
council composed of Notre 
Dame faculty, staff and stu­
dents. Right on, I say. 
Of course, he didn't get 
everything he wanted on 
Monday. Whetzel watched, 
pleased, I'm sure, as the 
group voted 13-3 to push 
parietals back an hour to 9 
a.m. every day. But his pleas for a 60-minute extension to the hours through the week fell on 1O seemingly deaf ears, as Whetzel and each student CLC member saw that move shot down 10-6 -a vote short of the majority needed for passage. 
Depending on whom you looked at following the rejected resolution, the scene -members repre­senting all facets of University life seated, hands clasped or, in some cases propping up heads­was either oddly dL<,turbing or strikingly familiar. 
On the one hand were students visibly deflated by the failed measure. Moving morning parietals to 9 a.m. was a no-brainer, but garnering support for the late-night parietals change was the chal­lenge. It failed. They failed. 
And as far as they were concerned, they failed the student body. In March, a senate survey polled undergraduates' opinions on changing the long­standing hours. According to the results ofsurvey, 2,429 of 3,038 respondents said they were in favor ofextending parietals past midnight. That's about 80 percent ofsurveyed students who think an extension would be beneficial. 
"When 80 percent ofstudents make it perfectly clear that the extension of parietals is in their best interest, I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt," Whetzel said Monday. He was right. But he was also speaking to a group ofUniversity staff members who were sitting pretty happy with themselves after their defeat of a proposal that, according to one Notre Dame oflicial threatened "a healthy lifestyle" in residence halls. 
It's a low blow to \\Tite off as unhealthy some­thing of as much importance to students and on­campus gender relations as parietals, but Whetzel -and probably most students-saw that com­ing. Even before a vote moved to the floor, Whetzel got another point right: "There is a per­vading sense that administrators don't allow stu­dents to think for themselves. If this resolution gets shot down, don't pat me on the head, say I did a good job but tell me that daddy knows best," he told the body. 
It screamed boldness. I'm notjust talking about Whetzel's comments directed at Bill Kirk. the University's vice president for student affairs. 
What I'm getting at is the move to bring the parietals votes before the CLC in the first place. The issue certainly found a home in the Student Senate; the proposals came after months ofsur­veying students and talking with administrators. 
But for Whetzel and other student CLC members to introduce and advocate the measures into a body far less welcoming than the senate, was an act of courage and true student leadership. That makes the results of their efforts -even ifexpect­ed -no less a service to the student body. 
And at a time when many criticize student gov­ernment representatives' initiatives as insignifi­cant and unneeded, this should serve as an exam­ple of what's right with the Student Union and with fighting the good fight.

Health services: abortion prohibited 
LEXINGTON. Ky. 
University of Kentucky Health Services can't provide certain procedures -abortion happens to be one of them, as well as the distribution of RU-486, a drug that blocks the action of the hormone necessary to sustain a pregnancy, thus terminating the pregnancy. And in the event a patient needs medical advice con­cerning an issue like abortion, University Health Services will help the student find the type of medical attention needed. "If we don't offer the service, we will help patients find the service they need -that's our job," said Dr. Spencer Turner, director of University Health Services. Even though Turner said health ser­vices helps patients as much as possible, he said it couldn't refer the student to a specific place -health officials simply give the patient a list of referrals for various options. The statute implies that no publicly owned hospital or health care facility can perform or permit the performance of abortions. except to save the life of the pregnant woman.

Students to play role in bonfire 
AUSTIN. Texas 

Aggies will have a larger role in the construction of the 2002 Bonfire than many or them had feared follow­ing the 1999 disaster. Members of the Bonfire 2002 Steering Committee, a group formed to overseP the 2002 Bonfire, assured students in Tuesday and Wednesday meetings that they would play a significant role in the design selection and construction processes. The bonfire was postponed until at least 2002 after 12 students eventually died and 27 others were injured when the 59-foot high structure collapsed Nov. 18, 1999. Schuyler Houser, Texas A&M University student body president, said students were at lirst worried that they might not have a role in the bonlire's construc­tion. "There was initially a lot of concern because many of the students misunderstood and thought they weren't going to be able to help construct the bonlire at all," she said. "We just have to come up with a structure that's safe and that's designed by profession­als."

Reps. Tim lloemer. D-Ind., whose 3rd District includes Notre Dame, and Lindsey Graham, Il.-S.C.. are the princi­pal sponsors of the !louse ver­sion of the bill. 
Father Malloy's testimony was submitted in written form. The text follows: 
"Just more than three weeks ago, a very talented Notre Dame student-athlete. Ruth Riley, stood at the free throw line in an arena in St. Louis with the score tied, 5.8 seconds on the clock. a full house and a national televi­sion audience watching, and the NCAA women's basketball national championship in the balance. Ruth -the player of the year in women's collegiate basketball. the student-athlete of the year, and -the recipient of numerous other awards for her accomplishments as an athlete and as a student -had two free throws coming. Both shots rat­tled around the rim a bit ­time, howev­
er, there's a fact that's well known at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCM) and to most of the nation's college and uni­versity prcsidenl,;, athletic direc­tors, and coaches: There were more point-shaving and game­fixing schemes involving college and university athletic teams during the 1990s than in all pre­vious decades combined. One of those schemes involved a former Notre Dame student-athlete. He's now putting his life and reputation back together, and among the ways he's doing that is by telling those of us in colle­giate athletics -administrators, coaches and students -how it happened to him, what the pres­sures and the attractions were, how a good person came to commit criminal acts. 
"His story is what those of us who support the Student Athlete Protection Act are trying to pre­vent. 
"Is it any doubt that the NCAA, college and university presi­dents, athletics officials and coaches stand united in support of this legislation? Gambling is the great cloud that throws its shadow over the games our stu­dents play. How many more scandals will it take before a Ruth Riley can't go to the free throw line in such a situation without spectators wondering about the legitimacy of what's about to unfold? llow long will it be before a fan, seeing an excel­lent free throw shooter miss in the final seconds when his or her team has a comfortable lead, wonders if that miss was about lack of concentration or the point spread'? Is it any won­der that in Nevada. which is the subject of Lhis legislation, state law prohibits gambling on Nevada schools, even while the federal loophole that this legisla­tion would close permits legal gambling on Notre Dame's and other institutions' athletic events. "I, and all of' us who sup­port this legislation. know that its passage isn't the end of our battle with gambling. Far from it. But it is a crucial step, because it enshrines in federal law the principle that the athlet­ic victories and defeats of ama­

teur athletes -student-athletes -often, teen-aged athletes ­should not be a legal source of 
revenue for the professional gambling industry. 
"We must be able to take this step, this modest and moderate -but vital -step. All of those people and groups who are most intimately involved with the well being of student-athletes favor passage of this legislation; only those whose sole interest is money oppose it. 
"Please give us this victory for the well being of our student­athletes and help us to preserve and protect the integrity of the games they play.

Judge rules 'Irish' 
offensive ethnic slur 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
News Writer 
Although 20,000 fans will scream "IRISH" this Saturday at the Blue-Gold Game, they can­not print "IRISH" on their license plates in Vermont, a judge has mlcd. 
Superior Judge Matthew Katz upheld a decision by the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles to prevent Carol Ann Martin from purchasing a vanity plate with "IRISH" printed on it. Katz ruled "IRISH" could be wnsidered offensive or confus­ing to the public, according to court documents. 
"Even in the context of IRISH -evocative as it may be of lep­rechauns, shamrocks and Galway Bay -.the need to avoid viewpoint discrimination can be quickly apparent," Katz wrote in his decision. "If IRlSH is permit­ted, because most Vermonters would not find it offensive, is NOIRISH? Although cinema buffs might consider this latter example intriguing, more folks would probably fmd it evocative of 'No Irish Need Apply,' an employment notice actually and reasonably offensive to many." 
Martin found flaws with the judge's logic. 
"This decision, I don't see the common sense in it," she told the Barre Montpelier Time­Argus. "I didn't apply for NOIRISH. If someone applied for I-T, would they deny it because someone else might apply for S­H-1-T'!" 
Peter McQuillan, a prol'essor of Irish studies at Notre Dame. believes Irish is not offensive, 
"[The ruling] sounds like non­sense to me -that's my gut reaction," he said. 
Denny Moore, director of pub­lic relations. agreed. 
"That's outrageous," he said. "That's like saying you can't use Jewish or Polish because some­one might use No Jewish or No Polish." 
Although Notre Dame uses a fom1er British stereotype of the Irish as its mascot. Moore said it rarely receives complaints ­usually one or less a year, When Notre Dame does receive a com­plaint, Moore explains that the Irish-Americans who made up most of the students, adrninis­trators and faculty of the University adopted the symbol themselves. 
"It is a British stereotype turned into an Irish-American icon," Moore said. 
The Notre Dame Bookstore sells "quite a few" items with "Irish" written on it, according to Jim O'Connor, director of the Bookstore. He has yet to receive any complaints about items with "Irish" printed on them. 
"Irish" is also used several times on the Embassy of Ireland in Washington DC's Web site.

Recycle The Obse~Vet,A.

Recycling 
continued from page 1 
In the Beginning 
In response to the student body call for action, SEAC sent out a petition in April 2000. It wanted to determine student and faculty interest in adding plastic and glass to Saint Mary's aluminum and paper recycling. The petition returned ""ith more than 400 sig­natures in favor of adding plastic and glass to the recycling pro­gram. From the overwhelming response, the club knew it had the backing to propose changes to the existing program. 
To institute a full-fledged recy­cling program, SEAC drafted a proposal to present to the Board of Governance (BOG) on Oct. 21. The SEAC proposal outlined the reasons why the college needed a new recycling program. One rea­son rnstcd on the existence of the 1999/l000 BOG endorsed Student Environmental Policy and a change in vending machines. 
"We saw the need when the 

campus started replacing the alu­minum dispensing pop machines with plastic dispensing machines," said Lorenz. 
The Proposal 

Along with reasons to activate a recycling program. SEAC also outlined the initiatives needed to produce such a program. Initiatives included three main actions: contract an off-campus recycling pick-up service. provide clearly labeled and accessible bins for recycling in all buildings and educate students on how to properly dispose of recyclables. 
The last point requested coop­eration and commitment from dining hall services, to participate in the effort of a campus wide recycling program. SEAC spent its time coming up with a concise proposal that would get the back­ing of both student body and administration. 
"We heard a lot about propos­als for glass and plastic recycling being rejected in the past so we had to put a lot of time and effort into coming up with a proposal and rallying support from stu­dents and faculty," said Lorenz. 
The group's work paid off when it got the needed approval from the Academic Council to proceed with its proposal into committee form. Holding its first meeting March 23. SEAC not only named a program coordinator for the committee, Jerry De Damper, but also proposed future steps the committee should take. 
With the formation of a com­mittee, SEAC definitely sees the potential to reform the existing recycling program. As explained by Marilyn Rajski, director of building and services, the weekly aluminum recycling is handled by building service workers, making the task time consuming. Especially the time staff spend cleaning out each of the cans before recycling. 
''The 55 containers are emptied and one of our floaters picks up all the bags from every building and takes the cans to South Bend's recycling center," said Rajsld. 
And even though the campus does not officially recycle plastics and glass, SEAC has been doing it on its own. The members have been emptying. cleaning and recycling any plastic and glass containers that have deposited around the dorms. The hope is that in establishing the four-point plan SEAC, along with the recy­cling committee, can make the process of recycling a lot more efficient. 
The only kink in SEAC's pro­posal for a recycling program may lie in the numbers crunched by Saint Mary's financial depart­ment. As ii stands, building ser­vices pours in at least five hours a week per person to carry out the aluminum-recycling project. 
However, as Rajski pointed out in the recycling committee's min­utes. most of the revenue is lost in the labor. They receive $2,500 in revenue a year from recycling the cans but end up dumping at least that much back into paying a Saint Mary's worker to clean and transport the cans. 
Even though the aluminum recycling may actually result in a loss of money for the campus, SEAC is keeping hope alive. Awaiting a rough estimate on costs versus benefits, members of SEAC cross their fingers hoping Keith Dennis. vice president of finance, will flag them on to the next cycle of'actions. 
The Next Step 
Dennis said the budget for the next fiscal year has already been completed and SEAC's proposal for the recycling program was not figured in. He said that if the pro­ject costs arc insignificant, the program may start next fall. But if the costs arc large, the program will have to wait for the~ next bud­get cycle, meaning there may or may not be enough money to get the program started for fall 2001. 
"We have already completed the budget cycle for next year," said Dennis. Dennis did however assure that the College would start some reform next year that would involve little to no cost. This reform would ease the indi­vidual efforts SEAC has been doing to recycle plastics and glass by combining the SEAC recycling job with that of college resources. 
Regardless of the budget deci­sion, SEAC sees recycling more than about dollar figures and rev­enue amounlr.;. They started this project in response to student concerns and their goal has always been simple: effective recycling with campus aware-

UKRAINE 


Associated Press ~ 
KIEV 

Ukraine plunged into political disarray Thursday as the commu­nist-dominated parlia­ment ousted the govern­ment of Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko, the nation's most popular politician. 
The dismissal of the most economically reform-minded govern­ment in Ukraine's short post-Soviet history was seen by analysts as a threat to further reforms and ·a bad signal for potential foreign investors. 
"Democracy in Ukraine has suffered a serious defeat." Yushchenko said after lawmakers voted 263-69 to approve a Communist-sponsored resolution accusing the government of failing to improve the economy and leading Ukraine to ruin. 
About 10,000 protesters took to the streets of Kiev to denounce the no-confi­dence vote and demand the dismissal of President Leonid Kuchma, whom they accused of tacitly sponsoring the drive against Yushchenko and his Cabinet. 
Pro-government legisla­tors chanted "Yush­chenko! Yushchenko!" while others called for Kuchma to be thrown out of office. 
Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding Kuchma resign over a scandal involving the death of critical journalist Heorhiy Gongadze. 
Thousands of Yushchenko supporters marched from parliament to Kuchma's headquar­ters later in the day, shouting "Down with Kuchma!" 
The Constitution requires the prime minis­ter to hand his resigna­
tion to the president, and Kuchma is unlikely to reject it. 
The Cabinet will then become a caretaker gov­ernment for a maximum of 60 days. 
"As the head of state, I cannot like this decision. But what has happened is done," Kuchma said, visit­ing the Chernobyl region on the 15th anniversary of the nuclear disaster. 
But Yushchenko back­ers and opposition parties seeking Kuchma's ouster suspect the president was only too glad to be rid of the popular premier. whom he allegedly saw as a potential rival.

Ethiopian plane hijacked to Sudan 
Associated Press 
KHARTOUM 

Nine university students armed with hand grenades and pistols seized an Ethiopian plane carrying at least 50 passengers and diverted it to Khartoum on Thursday, state-run Sudan television reported. Hours later, the attackers released 11 women and children. 
Government negotiators managed to persuade the hijackers to free six women and five children, said Ghazi Salah el-Din Atabani, Sudan's minis­ter of information. 
Atabani told reporters that the hijackers were seeking political asy­lum, but did did not elaborate. 
The television report said the hijackers, students at Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University, demanded meetings with U.S. and British diplo­mats. But it wasn't immediately known if that was possible. 
The United States is represented in Sudan by charge d'affaires Glenn Warren. but it was not clear if he was in the country. And a British diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he wasn't aware of any call for involvement by his country. 
Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail told Qatar's Al-Jazeera satellite television that the hijackers landed in Khartoum because they were running out of fuel, adding he did not know what their intended destination was. 
Ismail said the situation on board was "extremely bad." 
The Antonov 12 aircraft originated in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, and was heading to northern Ethiopia when the hijackers seized the plane, the TV report said. It land­ed at Khartoum airport at 6:20 p.m., it said. 
A crew member who managed to escape out the back of the plane said the hijackers were armed with hand grenades and pistols, the TV report said.

Students fight eating disorders 
By ALYSON TOMME News Writer 
Anna had a dream. It was a dream of a haven for women. a place of support and under­standing for eating disorders. Though Anna was forced to leave the University and return home because of her illness, her vision for a faith-based meeting of women finally became a real­ity this semester because of other dedicated students. 
With the help of Chandra Johnson, assistant to the presi­dent, A Life Uncommon, which draws its name from a Jewel song of the same title, was formed by sophomores Sarah Shacklett and Allie Swiacki, and juniors Darcy McLaughlin and Amy Wodoslawsky to combat a common campus problem: eat­ing disorders. 
This organization of women. co-sponsored by Campus Ministry and the Counseling Center. recognizes eating disor­ders as an illness of the soul, not simply a problem with food. It confidentially gathers women struggling with a disorder or an obsession with food, friends of those with a problem and any woman who express a desire to learn and understand this wide-. spread dilemma. 
"We didn't want it to be from a clinical standpoint at all ­every women can benefit from attending," said Shacklett. 
After much discussion and planning with the adminbtra­ti()n last semester, A Life Uncommon conducted its first meeiing on March 28 and has since held four additional meet­ings. The initial meeting was successful with approximately 80 students participating. Since then, the number attending has ranged from 40 to 75 students, 
A typical meeting opens with a prayer by Johnson and a speaker to talk about the week's theme. Past themes have included pre-anorexic ten­dencies, isolation versus con­nection and relating to God. The goal is to have each woman discover a comfort zone to share experiences and increase understanding in all aspects of eating disorders. 
"It creates an environment where girls can help each other. By talking about it. women real­ize everyone is doing unhealthy things," said Swiacki. 
Subsequently, the women break into small groups for a more intimate discussion. A group leader uses three focus questions to facilitate the dis­cussion, but it will often head in whatever direction the women decide to take it. 
"It's girls talking and finding healing in each other," said Shacklett. 
Everyone is also given a piece of paper to write down anything they wish at the end of the meeting and these prayers, hopes, and struggles arc all taken to the Grotto. To con­clude, the meetings always end with a prayer and a song. 
Though this past Wednesday marked the year's last meeting, plans for next school year are already in motion. As of' now, A Life Uncommon does not have oflicial club status. but they are 

_currently going through the progress to become a club. The women also hope to gain recog­nition and increase member­ship by speaking at Freshmen Orientation and offering a retreat. 
The meetings will continue every week next year. and organizers plan to incorporate males into some meetings as well. 
"It's important for guys to be more informed," said McLaughlin. 
As students aimed at fighting eating disorders, improving personal growth and accep­tance, A Life Uncommon is a unique resource at Notre Dame. 
"The fact that we have it is amazing," said McLaughlin. "It's an opportunity for girls to get together. It's a place where people can come and get sup­port."

KIEV, Ukraine 

With prayers and flickering candles, people across the for­mer Soviet Union honored those killed and sickened 15 years ago by the world's worst nuclear dis­aster at Ukraine's Chernobyl power plant. 
In Moscow, hundreds of peo­ple mourned firefighters who died after the radioactive explo­sion and were buried in radia­tion-proof coffins. In Kiev, hun­dreds more people attended an overnight memorial service at a chapel built to commemorate the disaster. 
The scene was repeated in the Belarusian capital and in Slavutych, a town of Chernobyl workers near the plant. In Home, Pope John Paul II prayed for the victims. The pope is schcduled to visit Ukraine in June. 
The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire sent a radioaclive cloud over much of Europe and conta­minated large areas in then­Soviet Ukraine, Hussia and Belarus. 
The Ukrainian government says more than 4,000 people involved in the hastily and poor­ly organized Soviet cleanup effort have died, and that more than 70,000 Ukrainians were disabled by the disaster. 
In all, 7 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are estimated to suffer physical or psychological effects of radiation related to the Chernobyl cata­strophe. 
At the chapel in Kiev, mourn­ers held burning candles as priests prayed for the dead. The chapel bell rang shortly after 1 a.m., the time the reactor exploded. Some in the crowd broke into tears. 
Early Wednesday, Ukrainian leaders laid wreaths at a monu­ment to firefighters and emer­gency workers next to the chapel. A similar service was held in Slavutych, where President Leonid Kuchma said the disaster continues to hobble Ukraine's development. 
"Human calamities and prob­lems born by the disaster remain," Kuchma said. "For 15 years, Ukraine has borne the cross of Chernobyl practically alone. We had to do everything on our own in unfavorable eco­nomic conditions." 
In Belarus, some 10,000 peo­ple turned out for an evening rally in the capital, Minsk, to commemorate the tragedy. 
"We are a sick nation and we must do everything to become a normal nation," opposition politician Pavel Severinets said. 
In the Vatican, the pope prayed for the Chernobyl victims at a service attended by Ukrainian children. 
At Moscow's Mitino cemetery, hundreds of relatives and friends paid tribute to dead fire­fighters. 
"We have come here for 15 years and I will come with my husband as long as we have our health," said Valentyna Lopatiuk, whose son was a Chernobyl firefighter. 
Following the explosion, other reactors at Chernobyl continued operating until shutting down in December under intense international pressure. 
At the plant itself, workers still monitor the now-idle reactors, and they are building a heating plant and facilities for nuclear waste disposal and reprocessing. 
They are also involved in a $758 million internationally funded project to repair the leaky concrete and steel sar­cophagus over the ruined reac­tor.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 

A judge Thursday ordered that a comatose woman be placed back on a feeding tube, two days after her husband won legal permission to remove it. 
Circuit Judge Frank Quesada granted a delay requested by Terri Schiavo's parents, citing new allegations that Schiavo·s husband lied in saying his wife didn't want to be kept on life support. 
"I don't think there is any­thing more final or irrepara­ble than death," Quesada said. 
Attorneys for parents Bob and Mary Schindler told Quesada that their daughter, 37, had not received the liquid nutritional supplement that has kept her alive during her 11-year-coma since Tuesday morning. 
After the judge's order, Michael Schiavo called hospice officials as requested to have the feeding tube replaced, his attorney said.

McVeigh considered killing Reno 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Timothy McVeigh said he con­sidered assassinating former Attorney General Janet Reno and others instead of bombing the Oklahoma City federal build­ing to retaliate against the gov­ernment. 
"I considered, among other things, a campaign of individual assassination," McVeigh said in a letter to Fox News released Thursday. 
McVeigh said "eligible" targets included Reno, "making her accept 'full responsibility' in deed, not just word," for the deaths as a result of the federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. 
Other targets included federal Judge Walter Smith, who presided over the Waco trial,

and Lon Horiuchi, an FBI agent involved at a shootout at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. 
McVeigh said he bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City as a retaliatory strike against a government that he believed had waged violence against its citizens. 
"I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile. by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who repre­sent that government," McVeigh said in the letter. 
McVeigh, 33, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on May 16 for the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. 19 of them children.

War veteran had not admitted his involvement in the bombing or explained his reasons for doing it. 
Last month, though, in a book about the bombing written by two reporters who interviewed him, McVeigh admitted his actions and called the children killed "collateral damage." 
Asked about the passage, McVeigh told Fox: "Collateral Damage? As an American news junkie; a military man; and a Gulf War Veteran, where do they think I learned that [It sure as hell wasn't Osami Bin Laden!l" -he wrote, misspelling the name of a suspected terrorist. 
As in the book, McVeigh said he bombed the federal building to avenge the deaths at Waco and contended his actions were justified. 
"Bombing the Murrah Federal Building was morally and strate­gically equivalent to the U.S. hit­ting a government building in Serbia, Iraq or other nations," McVeigh wrote. "Based on the observations of the policies of my own government, I viewed this action as an acceptable option."

House passes fetus harm bill with support 
Asoociated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The House voted Thursday to make it a federal crime to harm a fetus during an assault on its mother, urging action on behalf of "unborn victims." Abortion rights advocates decried the bill as a foot in the door toward legal recognition of fetuses as people. 
After a lengthy and some­times testy debate that included pictures of a woman holding a stillborn baby who died after she was assaulted, the House passed the bill 252-172, almost identical to the 254-172 margin by which it was passed a year ago. 
Unlike last year, this bill has the support of the White House and its new occupant. Former President Clinton had promised to veto it if it ever reached him. It didn't, large­ly because there was little support for it in the Senate.

The Senate Judiciary 
Committee, now evenly split 
between Democrats and 
Republicans, has yet to set a 
hearing on the issue this 
year. 
"This legislation affirms 

our commitment to a culture 
of life, which welcomes and 
protects children," President 
Bush said in a prepared 
statement as he traveled to 
Houston on Thursday. 
House supporters charac­

terized the bill as an anti­
crime measure, not an abor­
tion issue. 
"The law must not look 

upon a violent criminal's 
unborn victims with an indif­
ferent eye," said House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R­
Texas. "Every young life 
must be acknowledged. And 
every young life must be pro­
tected from predatory crimi­
nals." 
De Lay assailed a 

Democratic amendment that 
would have stiffened penal­
ties for harming a pregnant 
woman but not made harm­
ing a fetus a separate crime. 
"Life and death should not 
be subsumed beneath a 
semantic fog," he said.

In many dorms. parietals are already adjusted on football weekends so visitors of I.he opposite sex mn meet students in their dents from cngagmg m sexu­
al activity. BuL if that is true, then why are same-sex residents of differ­ent dorms allowed to enter another dorm before 10 a.m. while opposite-sex residents arc not? 
If parietals aren't about sex and deviant activity, why are residents of Alumni Hall allowed in Sorin before 10 a.m. but resi­dents of Pangborn not? 
Are residents of Alumni quieter and less distracting than Pangborn rcsident'i? And why are Pangborn residents allowed in Howard before 10 a.m. but not Alumni res­idents? 
It is obvious parietal'> have little to do with quiet hours and more to do with sex. 
Do Kirk, Rozum and Doyle really believe that students are more likely to engage in improper sexual activities between 9 a.m. and lO a.m. than they arc alter 10 a.m.? If students of the opposite sex can attend classes together at 8:30 a.m., why wouldn't they be able to study or work together in dorm rooms at 9 a.m:? 
Father Mark Poorman would be wisn to accept the recommendation of the 13 CLC members who voted for the 9 a.m. propos­al and adjust the parietals standards for next year. 
My own contmencement address 
Commencement addresses are notori­ous for quickly fading from our memories. My commencement was no exception. Today, I only remember that the late jour­nalist Carl Rowan received an honorary 
degree with me on May 20, 1973. 
Several years ago I approached Howan at a dinner where he was initially reluctant to speak with me until l mentioned that we were class­


mates. Funny how 

Gary Caruso
a commencement 
can have such a 
disarming quality 
Capitol
decades later. 

Each spring, l Comments imagine that Notre Dame has invited me to address the graduating class. This year's fantasy address has special rele­vance for me because I am countering the President of the United States. As a former Clinton appointee that distinction gives me a measure of satisfaction. 
As a Democrat, I emphatically oppose Bush's policies and politics, but still recog­nize that the class of 2001 is among a handful of Notre Dame classes to be hon­ored by a presidential commencement address. 
Yet, something is terribly wrong with our political system when African Americans vote by more than 95 percent for Democrats and against Republicans. The gender gap of women favoring Democrats and men favoring Republicans is a storm cloud in our future. Political changes are needed when Republicans are delighted that only 65 percent of HL'ipanics voted against the Republican president. 
Bush will speak about prayer and faith, forgiveness and compassion, family and conservative values, service to the com­munity, willing hearts and commitment to children, neighbors and God. Democrats find it ironic that George W. Bush's presi­dency is developing a pattern similar to Ronald Reagan's. 
Both portray themselves as such patri­ots invoking God and prayer at every opportunity, yet both rarely attend church on Sunday. Since his inauguration, Bush has yet to worship in Washington. It is quite a contrast to the many Sunday mornings while I was walking the dogs when the Clinton motorcade silently passed to his church a block from my resi­dence. 
Hegardless of what is said, this year's seniors will always remember that the president spoke to them. The late humorist Art Buchwald reminded gradu­ates that nobody remembers commence­ments and only hoped that his audiences would at least remember that they laughed on graduation day. My wish is that graduates can learn to choose between the names Elliott and Nick. 
It seems to me that life facing this year's seniors is like the cross-country journey director Rob Reiner portrayed in the movie "The Sure Thing." Two college stu­dents, John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, traveled from New England to California. Their trek begins with absolute friction between them, but eventually grows into an understanding of each other. 
Cusack, a free-spirited, crass freshman, uses a fake identification to drink beer and eats junk food for breakfast. He trav­els to visit a high school pal who ha'> set Cusack up with a girl who is a "sure thing." Zuniga is on her way west to visit her cultured high school boyfriend whose greatest attribute is his collection of brands of tea. 
Along the way Cusack shows the refined, introverted Zuniga how to shot­gun a beer, live fast and be spontaneous. For her part, Zuniga teaches Cusack to be serious and more mature. In the end, Zuniga breaks up with her old boyfriend and Cusack refuses "the sure thing." 
For me, the essence of the movie is cap­tured when Zuniga says she would name her first child either Cynlhia or Elliott. Cusack counters that Elliott is I.he "name of a fat kid with glasses who eats paste." Cusack continues, "Nick is a real name. Nick is a guy you can trust. Nick is a guy you go with to drink a beer." 
Life for the class of 2001 will be a series of choices between the so-called Elliotts and Nicks. Those choices may not be as dramatic as the I Iebrew saying, "Whoever 
saves one life saves the world in time." 
Yet, already these past four years students 
have affected the lives of their fellow 
classmates for better or worse, depending 
upon their degree of openness and toler­
ance. 

This year students could choose between HOTC and Pax Christi or compro­mise between the extremes. 'Ibey could support or oppose a public offering of 'The Vagina Monologues." They could have added to another's life or chipped away at someone's pride by ignoring or ridiculing others. 
Notre Dame strives to develop intellect. character and values. Yet. all too often. in an effort to attain such lofty idcal'i, indi­viduality is sacrificed for a herd mentality. One will eventually learn in the real world. well beyond Catholic Disneyland, that diversity and tolerance are the strengths of our nation. Adaptability is the thread that ties civilized societies together. 
Many of my fellow classmates have become disillusioned, arc disturbed at I.he rapid rate of expansion on campus and arc upset that money seems to be playing more of a role in life. Some arc embar­rassed at I.he administration's dealings with issues perceived to be contrary to Church teaching. It is sad to see friends. who as young "Nicks," were full of exu­berance and loyalty, turn the magic twin­kle once radiating from their eyes into the dull, disappointed glare. 
People of presidential stature arc remembered for the positions they held. Humorists like Art Buchwald are remem­bered for the way they entertained with laughter. My words today will fade surely as the seasons of the year turn. 
But if just one member of this graduat­ing class can instill pride and self-confi­dence in others a'i a result of my analo!,,Y of Nick, then my anti-commencement address has had value. We should always remember that everything we do has a consequence. For everything we take. we leave something behind.

KRISTINE KAAI/The Observer The cast of "Gypsy" has put together an astounding show that will be gracing the stage of the O'Laughlin Auditorium this weekend. Recreating the pop­ular 1960s musical by Arthur Larents, the story follows the trials, hopes and dreams of a show business-bound family. 
'Gypsy' roams onto O'Laughlin stage 
With its first musical in six years, SMC lights up a spectacular performance 
By MATT KILLEN 
Scene Theatre Critic 
Musical theatre returns to South Bend this weekend as the Saint Mary's Theatre Department performs "Gypsy" at the Moreau Center for the Arl<;. 
This 1960 musical by Arthur Larents, .Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim follows the story of Hose (played by junior Beth Gervain) and her daughters, June and Louise. Set ln the 1920s, "Gypsy" ls about lfose's desirn for her daughters Lo pursue earners in vaudeville. Rose focuses her attention on the daughter she sees as the most talnnted, June. 
Vaudeville is fading from popularity {particularly as the depression hit.<;), how­evnr. and the rising tension between Rose and June eventually causes June to leave. Hose then turns her focus on her other daughter, Louise (played by junior Jen Simantz). Rose views Louise as far less tal­enwd than June, but her opinion soon changes as the two begin to work with each other. 

"The musical is a big deal here," Gervain said. "We haven't done one in about six years, and we're putting it on in O'Laughin [Auditorium]." Because of this, the Theatre Department is "Gypsy" pulling out all of the stops for

of plays and musicals explore minimalist approaches, we wanted to explore what we could to with more, to maximize almost everything. From the 
start, we've tried to expand the edges of a musical theatre production." The crew has even pushed the limits of the O'Laughlin Auditorium. Set and lighting designer Tom Boelman actually designed and built the turntable used on the stage. 
The Theatre DepartmPnt chose "Gypsy" because of Lhe production value and the music. '"Gypsy' was chosen because the music is really fun," Abram­Copenhaver said. "One of the things we\.e tried to capitalize on is that the music be an appropriate extension of the play." 
Gervain said what drew her to "Gypsy" was her character. Hose. "Hose isn't a typical musi­cal character." Gervaln said. "She's quitA complex. The char­acter has a lot of depth to her." 
This is one of the musical's strongest aspects. The plot is a fascinating look into Rose's attempts to fulfill the dreams she has for her daughters. The musical takes the time to explore the com­plex relationships, and the result is rewarding. This is a rare instance in musi­cal theater when the audience is as involved in the fate of the characters as they are in the songs and dances. 

In fact, there are some quite tragic moments in the play. The whole first act shows how June is unhappy doing whatev­er her mother asks. The audience feels a sensfl of pity and almost sadness for the whole family as they try to make it per­forming their vaudeville act wherever they can. 
The music and the story lines comple­ment each other nicely. Since the play is focused around vaudeville, this serves as an easy and natural transition to many of the musical numbers, which arc vaudeville acts performed on the "stage" in the musi­cal. 
Even scenes that take place outside the musical's stage have rousing and powerful numbers that seem to fit naturally, like Rose's "Everything's Coming up Roses," a highlight of the musical. The songs don't come out of nowhere -they arrive during the musical at the appropriate times. The musical is not rushed, yet at the same time moves along at a comfortable pace. 
Simply because "Gypsy" is rich in plot and substance doesn't mean it loses its production quality. In fact. the Saint Mary's Theatre Department's production is so highly detailed and demanding that it rivals even some professional productions. Ono of the most exciting aspects of the pro­duction is the turntable employed. This device allows for a variety of scene changes in a relatively expedient manm~r. 
The result is an incredibly entertaining show that has large musical numbers, powerful act.in.g and rewarding production values. "Gypsy" is certainly worthy of being the fu·st musical at Saint Mary's in several years. With a strong r,ast and a rousing score, "Gypsy" is a show with a wide appeal to many people. 
"Gypsy" is showing Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. with a matinee performance Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $16.50 for adults. $14.50 for senior citizens, $8.50 for members of the Notre DametSaint Mary's community and $7.50 for students. Tfckets can be reserved by calling Special Events at (219)284-4626.

is washed in 

students the soothing 
silence of the 
blackness. 

When the lights return, the stage is a tranquil blue. And, for the moment, the dire feelings of catharsis, of emotional purging, have sub­sided. Of course, the real tragedy of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" has yet to begin. 
Obviously, this production of the (;reek tragedy of tragedies is anything but usual. To avoid being a "museum piece" of the­atre. one that people attend but only pre­tend to enjoy, the FTT production staff has given Sophocles' 2,500-year-old show a face lift. Instead of being the mythical king of Thebes who solved the riddle of the Sphinx, Oedipus is transformed into the President of the United States. Creon, Oedipus' brother-in-law, is presented as a fellow political adversary and sometime ally. 
The modern translation of the text by Luci Berkowitz and Theodore Brunner closely follows the original Greek text. However, sometimes the lines show up more in the spirit of the text than in direct translation. Overall, this looser style makes the show a lot more entertaining to watch, although classicists would complain that some lines have been translated with a specifically modern spin. 
The presentation of the show in United States politics works alarmingly well. Although the lines still refer to Oedipus as "king'' and Jocasta as "qm~en," the actors convincingly portray their modernized roles. 
Staging the. show is not all patricide and self-mutilation, though. Tony Lawton, the director of the play, has a wonderful rela­tionship with his cast on and off the stage. During breaks and cast dinners. Lawton (although he mwer has anyone refer to him in such formal terms, a simple "Tony" will do) is constantly seen joking around with the rest of the cast. 
Lawton, an '89 Notre Dame alum who majored in the Program of Liberal Studies, is a visiting theatre professor for two years. Although Lawton was a full-time actor in Philadelphia, he jumped at the chance to return to the Dome to teach the­atre. 
Lawton was not the original director of the show but was selected when the first director took an unexpected leave of absence. 
Lawton has, however, stayed mostly to the original concept of the show, "[the original director] wanted to go modern dress with it and have Oval Office imagery, and I think it works well," Lawton said. "The important luxury modern dress affords us is that we are less removed from the story." 
In Lawton's mind, it is extremely impor­tant for the audience to identify with the protagonist in a tragedy. He feels that the arch of the story is reflective of human experience. "It's a great story for a Catholic school," Lawton said of the moral teachings the show presents. Oedipus goes looking for evil, finds it in himself and then must perform penance to purge it. 
"The problem people have with 'Oedipus [Rex]' is that they have the irrational anxi­ety that any one of us can [potentially] become a monster," Lawton said. 
Critics may assert that this production's interpretation of the classic modernizes not only the dress but also the message. Lawton, howev­er, does not believe that he has imposed his interpretation on 
the story. He feels that parallels exist because the story is truly a classic. "I think a thing is true regardless of what culture discovers it," Lawton said. 
The real triumph of "Oedipus Rex" is not its novel interpretation, but its acting. Junior Matt Lee, who plays Oedipus, is remarkably convincing in his portrayal of the king/president. And the audience will certainly enjoy senior J.J. Area's perfor­mance as the sallow-faced Creon. A con­siderably talented chorus performs sopho­more Kat Walsh's enchanting choreogra­phy, and freshman Tom Connor's portray-al of an elderly messenger is sure to please, as well. 


Theatre lovers will find that "Oedipus Rex" is one of the best theatrical presenta­tions on campus this year. It is a produc­tion not to be missed. 
"Oedipus Rex" will be performed at Washington Hall Friday and Saturday at 
7:30 p.m. and there will be a matinee at 
2:30 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are $9 for general admission, $8 for senior citizens and $6 for students. Thickets are available at the Lafortune Student Center Box Office or order by phone call (219) 631-8128.

Bosephus won't be 
overlooked this time 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Senior Staff Writer 
Last year, Please Call Us Bosephus took the Bookstore Basketball tournament by sur­prise. with the all-freshmen team going from virtual unknowns all the way to the final eight. where it lost to eventual 

,. champion Keyplay.com. By the end of the tourney, Bosephus had earned the respect of their competitors. with Keyplay's Cas Schneller predict­ing Bosephus would be the team to beat the next three years. This year. No. 5 Bosephus has no such anonymity. Bosephus backed up its seed with a 21-16 
r 
victory against No. 12 seed Five Degree Guarantee Thursday. 
''This is the first game where we really played as a team." Bosephus· Evan Maher said. "We really moved the ball around." 
The five sophomores of Bosephus -Morrissey's Pat O'Brien and Alumni residents Maher, Brian Ostick, Jason Sullivan and Andy Bozzelli ­shot their way to a 7-3 lead, with O'Brien doing the bulk of the scoring. 
But Five Degree didn't give up that easily. Blake Sanz led the assault on Bosephus. scoring half his team's points. 
"We got it lo 11-9 and then rushed shots," said Josh Bilz of Five Degree, which also made it to the Sweet 16 a year ago. "We took a lot of perimeter shots, and didn't get it inside. I thought we had an advantage inside. We lost where our game was." 
Bosephus reeled off three straight points to pull ahead 17 ­
11. Ostick was a big key in the second half with two free throws and several field goals. 
"We moved on offense the whole time," Sullivan said. "Before, we just sat around and let two people try to take over. Today everyone was playing well, cutting through lanes." 
As Bosephus closed out the game, it got a little fancy. O'Brien swiped the ball from the opponent and tossed it behind his back to Sullivan, who got it to Ostick for an in-the-lane bucket. After three more Five Degree buckets, Sullivan finished the win off for Bosephus by sinking a free throw. 
"We plan on being back," Bilz said. "Everyone's coming back, so we'll be back." 

Versatility edges Killer Boots 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

It takes heart to come from behind for the 21-19 victory like Versatility did Thursday. 
"When you get down to the final 16." said VersatilityOs Chris Dillon, "you expect every game to be close. Obviously, it was a little closer than we would have liked." 
Versatility entered the match-up against Killer Boots, Man! as the decided favorite. Versatility held the No. 2 seed in the tourney. and has taken its game into the Final Four each of the past two years. Killer Boots. Man! was the No. 15 seed, and only got into the Sweet 16 when Boat Club, which defeated Killer Boots in the round of 32: was disquali­fied for using an ineligible play­er Tony Rice. 
The rankings didn·t mean much in the Versatility-Killer Boots contest, as Versatility held its last lead at 3-2 and trailed by as many as four mid­way through the game. Dave Marchiano, Mike Eades, Andrew Orosz and Mike Hoefling received a huge height boost when they replaced an injured player with 6-foot-8 assistant men's basketball coach Evan Preston Thursday afternoon. 
But betting on Versatility to make its free throws would have made a jackpot of money. Versatility, down 16-14, scored six of its last seven points on free throws, with four players getting in on the charity work. 
"They hit their foul shots," said Killer Boots' Dave Marchiano. a lights-out shooter in the first half. ..The foul shots were really clutch." 
John Hiltz of Versatility, a walk-on for the Irish men's basketball team in 1999-2000. brought the heart to nail the final two free throws. His heart may have been beating a little bit faster, but it was nothing compared to the way it used to race back in high school. 
"When I would play basket ball," Hiltz said, "my heart would race and go up to like 250 beats a minute, and I would get tired." 
Although Hiltz kept playing high school ball, the heart problem hampered his game. 
"The doctors couldn't diag­nose it until my freshman year." Hiltz said. "Once I had surgery to fix that, I was able to play. My endurance was a lot better and I was able to play at a much higher level." 
The surgery took place just in time for Hiltz to play Bookstore Basketball as a freshman in 1999. He and three Keough Hall sectionmates -Joe Lillis. Jason Childress and Chris Dillon -teamed up with James Cochran. The unseeded Versatility squad went all the way to the championships. where it lost to Malicious Prosecution. 
As a sophomore. Hiltz was in good enough shape to try out for the varsity men's basketball squad. He made the team, and saw action in several games for coach Matt Doherty. 
"It was something I'd wanted to do my whole life," said Hiltz. 
No walk-ons made the team this year. Mike Brey's first as the head coach for the Irish. 
"[ was disappointed. but I undersand that it's his philoso­phy," Hiltz said. "He's the coach and he didn't take any­body. That's his prerogative. The bottom line is, if you're a good enough player. you make the team." 
Without Hiltz last year. Versatility advanced to the Final Four before losing to eventual champions Keyplay.com. This year, Lillis. Childress, DiUon and I liltz are reunited. with the addition of senior Tim Greene. 
"Both years, we lost to the champions, so this year. we're hoping it will be us," said Dillon.

Top-ranked Five Reasons rolls over Check Your Head 21-7 
By KA THLEEN O'BRIEN 
s~nior Staff Wri1~r 
Five Reasons Your Girl Left You could have given itself another name; Five Reasons We're Going To Dominate You. 
Dominate is what No. 1 Five Reasons Your Girl Left You has done all through the tour­nament. It did it once more Thursday night, running past Check Your Head 21-7. 
"In my mind, we have the top guys in all five positions," said Five Heasons' Dan Reidy. "We 're the best at all five positions -I mean, that's why we put the team together." 
The game might have been a little closer if Check Your Head, the 16th-seeded team, hadn't had to play without its top player. Six-foot-10 varsity basketball player Hans Hasmussen, left Thursday level Bookstore team. 
The first new player cement­ed on Five Reasons' roster was Pete Ryan. 
"Dan [Reidy] and I always wanted to play together," Ryan said. "Last year. we played against each other. and we eliminated his team to go to the Final Four. That's when I played for Majesties. So he was like, well, we're not doing that again. We're going to play on the same team next year." 
Ryan, at 6-4, is an all­around athlete. He captured four straight Bengal Bouts titles as a captain of the Boxing Club. With his older sister a Saint Mary's graduate, Ryan's been watching Bookstore since early in his high school career, counting down the days until he could compete. 
"My brothers are the ones 
that give me a

out having Hans," said Check Your Head's Aaron Crall. "They were just a lot bigger than us. Size was a big factor because most of the shots they got were tip-ins or off of rebounds." 
Heidy, Dan Lustig and Kevin Muempfer all came to Five Heasons from the dismantled Franchise team. The three Franchise transfers were bas­ketball junkies, the guys seen every afternoon playing pick­up games at Rolfs. With Franchise's best player Steve Craig gone to graduation, they began scouting out replace­ments in the fall, hoping to put together a championship-

for the team ­his roommate Paul Raih, a 6-8 Irish Guard member who missed Bookstore last year while studying in London. Raih made Check Your Head pay last night, as his younger brother, John, was a sopho­more on the other team. 
"Today's his birthday, too," said Paul Raih. "I had to beat him up on his birthday." 
Five Reasons has been beat­ing teams up all tournament long. 
"We've scrimmaged against the top teams," Lustig said, "and we know what's ahead of us. I haven't known one per­son who we've played against

Reidy, a senior, is a midsi:le player who can hit from inside or outside. He's gotten more than his share of time in scouting out his competition as a head Bookstore Commissioner. 
Lustig, a 6-4 sophomore, brings an inside presence to the team. The Irish Guardsman from Alexandria, Ind .. turned down a host of offers from Division II and Ill basketball programs to come to Notre Dame. ft wasn't a dif­ficult choice. 
"I'm the sixth one in my family to come here." said Lustig, who is the sixth of nine children.

The No. 1 Irish enter this weekend's series against St. John's on a losing note, hav­ing dropped the second game in a doubleheader with Valparaiso on Wednesday night at Eck Stadium. That loss snapped Notre Dame's nation-leading 16-game winning streak. 
Even after the loss, the Irish boast an offense that is clicking after sputtering early and a pitching staff as dominant as ever. With just nine games left on its Big East schedule, the team looks to take a bite out of the Big Apple this weekend in a three game series against conference foe St. John's in Jamaica, N.Y. 
Notre Dame has made this year's Big East race look like a 100-meter dash between Michael Johnson and Al Roker, as the Irish have raced out to a five game lead over the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers and the Red Storm. 


"If we can have good suc­cess this weekend, it would be possible to clinch the reg­ular season Big East title at home against Connecticut, which would be nice for the home fans," said Irish head coach Paul Mainieri. 
The Irish feature the Big East player and pitcher of the week in Steve Stanley and Danny Tamayo. Stanley was recognized for an 8-for­14 performance last week and his first career home run. 
Tamayo earned his honors with an eight-inning outing against Villanova on April 21 where he held a no-hitter until tho seventh stanza. Tamayo, a senior from Miami, was one of the play­ers Mainieri singled out as someone who needed made a considerable impact on this year's squad. Mainieri also noted the accomplish­ments of freshman Steve Sollmann, who leads the team in batting average and homeruns. 
"Danny has given us a dominant second starter," said Mainieri. "Steve Sollmann had been very consistent, he's hit in the clutch. he's hit for power. They've been the big differ­ence in us taking the next step up." 
That next step up for the Irish has been the spotlight of being ranked No. 1, with all the prestige and annoy­ances of an honor the pro­
gr am  has  never  experi­ 
enced.  
Mainieri  isn't  worried  

about any ill effects from Wednesday's home loss to Valparaiso. 
"Our players are smart enough to know that any­thing can happen in a game," said Mainieri. 'Tm really proud how we've han­dled the No. 1 ranking." 
More importantly, with the program's new status comes a very good possibility of hosting a NCAA regional on May 25-27. "We're in the stretch run," said Mainieri. "We're in a great position in the conference, and also nationally." 
The Red Storm enters the weekend series at McCallen Field with a 2 5-15 record (13-7 in conference play). St. John's defeated Pace 11-3 at home, Wednesday. 
The Irish are ready to hit the road . 
"We're upbeat, positive, and excited right now," said Mainieri.

MEN'S GOLF 
Irish to participate in Big East tournaillent 


Special 10 The Observ.,, 
The Notre Dame men's golf 
team will look to extend it's 
season when the Irish travel to 
East Providence, R.I., this 
weekend to participate in the 
Big East Golf Championship at 
Metacomet Country Club. On 
the line for the tournament 
champion is the Big East's 
automatic bid to the NCAA 
Division I Championships, 
which begin with regionals the 
weekend of May 17-19. 
The Irish, the tournament's No. 3 seed, will play a practice round on the par 70, 6,464­yard course today. The two­day, 54-hole event begins on Saturday at 8 a.m. with 36 holes, followed by the final 18 holes of play on Sunday. Notre Dame has won Big East titles in 1995, 1996 and 1997 since joining the conference in 1995, while finishing second in 1998 and third last season. 
Coach George Thomas' team heads into the tournament playing its best golf of the spring, as it finished in a third place tie in last weekend's First Energy Intercollegiate tourney at Kent State. The (rish finished the rain-shortened tournament just one stroke out of second after firing a 36-hole total of 585. 
The Irish come into the tour­nament with two of the top players in the Big East in Alex Kent and Steve Ratay. Both played in last year's Big East Championship. Kent leads the Irish with a 74.00 average for the spring and has a 73. 96 average for the entire season. His best finish this season came at the Legends of Indiana Intercollegiate during the fall where he finished fourth with a six-under par total of 210 (67­71-72}. Kent has been Notre 

Dame's top finisher in three of 
the team's five tournaments 
this spring. He finished fifth in 
last year's Big East 
Tournament with a three-over 
par 145 (77-68). 

Ratay has a 74.31 average for 
the and for the year leads the 
team with a 73.96 average. 
Ratay is coming off his best fin­

ish of the spring as he tied for 
second at the First Energy 
Intercollegiate with a two-over 
par 142. During the fall, he tied 
for first at the Wisconsin 
Invitational with a four-under 
212. Last season, Ratav finished in a tie for ninth at the Big East Championship with a five-over par total of 147 on Notre Dame's Warren Golf Course. 
Another Irish golfer with Big East experience is sophomore Kyle Monfort. He played in the 1998 tournament before sitting out last season. As a freshman, Monfort finished in fourth place with a 10-over par 152 at the TPC Course at Avenel. Monfort has a 75. 77 average for the season with his best finish com­ing at the Kepler Intercollegiate at Ohio State where he finished 19th with a 10-over par 226. 
A pair of Texans round out the Notre Dame lineup. Senior Pat Schaffler stepped into the lineup in the fall and has given the Irish consistent scoring all season long as 19 of the 22 rounds he's played have been counted towards the team score. He owns a 76.92 average for the fall and a 76.45 mark for the season in the eight tour­naments he's played. 
Sophomore Brandon Lunke saw his first action of the spring last week at Kent State and turned in his best rounds of the season as he tied for fifth with a three-over par 143. For the year, Lunke has appeared in five tournaments and has a 
76.21 average.

MEN'S LACROSSE 
No. 4 Notre Dame prepares for final regular season match 

ByJOE LICANORO 
Sports Writer 
With a six-game winning streak, an 11-1 record and the No. 4 national ranking, the Notre Dame men's lacrosse team has had an incredible regular season, but it's not over yet. 
There's one more regular­season game to play. 
After a one-game road trip to Fairfield last weekend, the Irish will have an opportunity to close out their final regular season with a win when they take on Harvard at home this weekend before heading into NCAA tournament play. If the [rish win on Saturday, they will have the highest regular­season winning percentage in the history of Notre Dame men's lacrosse. 
While winning the NCAA tournament is their ultimate goal, the Irish realize that 
they cannot look past Harvard. 
"Harvard is an excellent team." said Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan. "We're not worried about the NCAA tour­nament yet. Our onl~ concern right now is preparing to play Harvard on Saturday." 
While the Irish have feasted on their Great Western Lacrosse League divisional foes in their recent games, Harvard, coming from the traditionally tough Ivy League, will be a good test for the Irish. 
Although Harvard's record is a modest 6-6, they should provide the Irish good prepa ration for the NCAA tourna­ment. 
"Harvard is a very good team," he said. "They beat Duke, and Duke just won the ACC tournament last week so we're not taking them light­ly." 
For the 11 seniors on the 
team, Saturday's game marks the end of a remarkable four years. Despite being a Midwest school in a predomi­nantly East Coast sport, the Irish seniors are responsible for elevating Notre Dame to one of the best lacrosse teams in the country. The game will be especially bittersweet for Corrigan because this is his last chance to coach the seniors in a regular season game. 
"These guys have been out­standing over the last four years," said Corrigan. "They are a great group of kids. I'm going to miss them on so many levels. I'll certainly miss coaching them, but I'll m'iss them as people even more."

Then the momentum turned again, and it was Boston's free throw that sent the game to half­time with LazyBoyz up 11-10. 
The second half featured more of the same disciplined basket­ball. A couple of turnovers by LazyBoyz helped NDToday open a 15-13 lead. Eventually NDToday stretched that lead to 17-14 for the first three-point lead of the game. The teams traded baskets with NDToday in control until the score was 20­18.

In other action Nylon Strokers were able to hold off a late rally by Candy Rain to pull out a 21­19 win. The game was undisci­plined from the start, with nei­ther team hitting their baskets.

Nylon, with Al Vitter, Brian Oleniczak, Courtney Watson. Chris Conway and Ryan Wood, grabbed an early 2-0 lead and played well enough for an 11-8 halftime edge. 
In the second half Candy start­ed playing a fast break game. They got several turnovers and turned a 14-9 deficit into an 18­17 lead. 

Nylon didn't fold though, and after a Candy turnover, they took a 20-19 lead. Another Candy turnover I.hen allowed for the game winning shot by Oleniczak. 
Nylon got the ball to Oleniczak on the right side, where he drained a game-winning basket from just inside the :-3-point arc. 
"I was just thinking to shoot with confidence." Olcniczak said. "We aren't a big team, so we had to compensate for their [Candy Rain's] size."

The teams started to exchange foul shots, but Verzatility's defense began to hold, and Kevin Murphy of Verzatility hit several clutch shots as the fourteen seed grad­ually put the game away. 
Wolbeck had a laundry list of 
things that the Majesties didn't 
do during the game. 
"We played like sh*t," said Wolbeck after the game. "We didn't execute, we didn't rebound, we didn't get back on defense, they outplayed us." 
Ninth-seeded Project Mayhem tently fed the

But the Dandies athleticism would keep the game close. 

Abe Elam found his scoring stroke late in the game. He had five points overall. 
"We know where each other are going to be. we played well as a team," said Wilson. 
Wilson believes that fatigue played a role in the game, with several. of the Dandies players competing after football prac­tice. 
"I think the fact that they were coming back from prac­tice, they were a little tired help us out run them a little bit," said Wilson. "We were a little quicker."

By reclaiming his role as the team's No. 1 starter, Heilman allowed several

younger pitchers to develop and gain

this year because they want to show 
that they arc just as committed to 
him." 
The big senior has definitely made the most out of his decision to remain in South Bend. Heilman. who has won 20 of his last 21 decisions, is 10-0 this year with the nation's fifth-best ERA at 1.32. 
So far this season, he has captured the Big East career records for wins and strikeouts. If he continues to pitch well, Heilman will own many other Notre Dame pitching records as well. 
His 38-7 career record is just two wins shy of the all-time mark of 40 set by Tom Price from 1991-94. Ileilman's career EHA is only .13 higher than the record mark of 2.36 set by Nick Palihnich from 1959-61. 
"He's definitely a great pitcher. We always feel like we can win when Aaron is on the mound," said Mainieri. "In my mind. he may go down as the best baseball player in Notre Dame history." 
Heilman, who likely stands to become only I.he 17th athlete at Notre Dame to be a four-time All American. is not content with just his past suc­cess. Make no mistake -he came back for his senior year to win. 
"Playing in the tournament last year and hosting a regional a couple of years ago were great experiences for me," said Heilman. "Being ranked No. 1 this week has probably been the highlight of my career so far, but I have a feeling that the best times are still to come." 
lleilman's return to Notre Dame will last far beyond his final season. While next year he will be playing profes­sionally, the Irish will still feel the ben­efits of his decision to remain. 

experience before being tossed into 
the fire. 

Next year, when these pitchers step into the spollight thcmsdves, they will have an extra year of pitching under their belts. In the meantime, these younger pitchers will have benefited from learning under one of the game's best players. 
"Life will go on next year without him because he has laid such a great foundation for us for years to come," said Mainieri. "'He has been a great leader and teacher to the younger guys by helping them to develop as players." 
Mainicri believes what makes Heilman the special player he has become is not merely his talent -it is his personality and the way he leads his team. Even as a perennial All­American and nationally recognized ace, Heilman has never let his fame inflate his ego. 
"Ile is one of the most unselfish players J have ever coached," said Mainicri. ''So many guys feel they should be treated specially because they have talent, but Aaron has never been like that. Be is the type of player that leads by example. He is always giving advice to younger players, rak­ing the mound after games and prac­tice and doing whatever he can to help out the team." 
Jn Heilman, the Irish have every­thing a team could want in a pitcher and captain. He has the talent to dom­inate any hitter, the poise take over a game and the personality to lead any team to a national title. 
Mainieri sums up the Irish leader very well as he boasts with pride, "He is the type of player and person that you only get to coach once in a life­time, and I feel very fortunate to have that opportunity now." 
Since deciding to return for his senior season, Aaron Heilman h.as been the sparkplug on the Irish pitching staff Above, Heilman pitches during a 7-1 win against Villanova. At right, Heilman throws while pitcher Danny Tamayo and Brian O'Connor look on.

Blue-Gold game features less football, more fun 

We met. for the first time, by accident, about a half-hour prior to last year's Hlue-Gold game. 
While waiting for an elevator that would stop at the third floor ofthe Stadium press box, I spoke with another writer. 
"Not exactly the way I want to spend my Saturday afternoon," the scribe said. 
Poor guy. 
What a 
tough gig. Receiving free admission to the nation's most famous college football shrine, watching the Irish scrim­mage, eating free (albeit less than gourmet-quality, probably less than White Castle-quality} food, sitting in a relatively com­fortable, unobstructed 40-yard line seat, and typing a 1,000 word recap sure sounds like an awful experience. 
You hear this all the time. Sportswriters complain more than Frank Costanza. 
Politicians lie. Salesmen bulls*"'*. Sportswriters whine. 
It's part of the job, I guess. 
And this weekend's game brings out the worst in us. 
Why? Because it's a glorified publicity stunt, a tradition that has little significance for next season. Because of injuries, the format will feature one offensive squad against one defensive team for the entire afternoon. Not one of the spectators will understand the complex scoring system. Someone, perhaps Vince McMahon or Jesse "Don't Call Me the Body Anymon~" Ventura, has devised a plan where even the defenders receive "points." Advice: Trust that the coaches won't cheat and frequently check the scoreboard_ 


Also. the game plan will con­sist of roughly 8 percent of the team's full playbook. (Maybe the Irish are scared that Nebraska coaches will rent out one of those planes, attach a 'Suckers!!' sign to its body, fly over the Stadium, and stMI "secrets"?) 
In last year's Blue-Gold game, quarterback Arnaz Battle, who had started only once in his career, said the entire offensive package had eight inside runs, five drop back passes and six play action passes. Pop Warner teams utilize a more detailed scheme. 
Even the head coach down­played the 2000 tilt. 
"I don't know how much we can determine from the outcome of the game, if anything," Bob Davie said after last year's game. "But it was a good day." 
Guaranteed Davie will repeat the same sentence on Saturday. 
But he has a point. 

It will be a good day. It cer­tainly won't be one of the most memorable of games, but a game nonetheless. 
The sports media forgets that a lot of the times. These are games. Games are supposed to be fun. Yet several others will agree with aforementioned writer's assertion. 
I admit it's not the best assign­ment of the year. But let's put some context in here. 
If your biggest complaint revolves around attending a meaningless Notre Dame scrim­mage, then I'm thinking you're not living the hard knock life. 
Roughly 20,000 fans will be in Rockne's House on Saturday. Every single one of' them paid an entrance fee. (I know the stu­dent tickets arc free. Bui I also know four years of' tuition should qualify as having shelled out some cash.) 
Some fans even paid $50 per ticket to sit in the press box. 
And guess what? No one will bicker, before the game, that he or she "must" go to the scrim­mage. 
For those who still have a problem, one simple suggestion_ 
After the scrimmage, the play­ers and coaches stay on the field, autograph merchandise, and interact with fans. Instead of stressing over an impending deadline. look around. Watch as sons and daughters, mothers and sons, journey from player to player, hunting down signatures as if they were keys to a new Ferrari. It's safe to say 97 per­cent will feel privileged to be on the same grass where the likes of Hart, Hornung and lluarte starred on so many memorable Saturday afternoons. 
Maybe then you can appreci­ate your "job."

______J 

Quarterbacks 

According to Bob Davie, Matt LoVecchio will be the starter on opening day at Nebraska. But Davie also said that he will play Carlyle Holiday and Jared Clark regu­larly, maybe even as early as Nebraska. Davie plans to utilize a multiple-quarterback system to begin the year. LoVccchio will take the first snaps in Saturday's scrimmage. The speedy Holiday will probably follow. and the strong-armed Oark will finish the day. 
Running backs 

With Julius Jones unable to partake in spring practice because for suspension and Tony Fisher out with an injury. the door is wide open for Terrance Boward (left) to seize the starting spot. But he could be chal­lenged by Mike McNair, who has had a rather impressive spring. McNair, a highly touted recruit who has never fully devel­oped only logged about 12 minutes of play­ing time last season, has shown consider­able promise in spring practice · He is listed as a fullback, but the coaching staff has also experimented with him in the tailback slot. 
Offensive line 

The big offensive hole to fill is the pair of guard spots vacated by Jim Jones and Mike Gandy. Several players could step up to fill the gap, including Sean Mahan and Ryan Scarola. At tight end. Gary Godsey. who played quarterback for two games last sea­son, and John Owens will replace graduat­ing seniors Jabari Holloway and Dan O'Leary. 
Wide receivers 

David Givens and Javin Hunter are clearly going to be the main receivers. But Arnaz Battle Oeft} has done a remarkable job mak­ing the transition from quarterback to flanker. While he's had trouble learning the routes, Battle has proven to be extremely quick in the open field once he catches the ball. Also, a trio of highly touted rising sophomores, Lorenzo Crawford, Omar Jenkins and Ronnie Rodamer, have made considerable progress during the spring and have shown they are capable of replac­ing Joey Getherall 
Defensive line 

Anthony Weaver (right) and Ryan Roberts are the only two returning members of the defensive line. However, the Irish will get an added boost by the return of Grant Irons. The rising fifth-year senior, who is still recovering from a shoulder injury, will not play Saturday. At the nose guard position, Andy Wisne and Cedric Hilliard are compet­ing to replace Lance Legree. Darrell Campbell will probably fill the gap vacated by B.J. Scott at defensive tackle. 
Linebackers 

With 2000 team MVP Anthony Denman graduating and rising senior Rocky Boiman hampered by injury, the linebacker corps are a thin this spring. Tyreo Harrison earned a lot of playing time this spring, and Carlos Pierre-Antoine also saw quality time on the field. Mike Goolsby. one of only three true freshmen to monogram last season, Patrick Ryan and Courtney Watson have also shown dramatic improvement this spring. 
Secondary 

The biggest question mark for the Irish is the secondary. Brock William's decision to leave early for the NFL hurt the corner­backs greatly. The only other returning cor­nerback is Shane Walton. who hasn't seen much action this spring because of an injury. Most of the playing time has been split between Jason Beckstrom, Clifford Jefferson, and Vontez Duff (right). The fastest man on the team, Duff, is also work­ing with the kickoff return team. At safety, Ron Israel has been injured. and Glenn Earl and Gerome Sapp have seen the most play­ing time. 
Special teams 

Although fans won't see much of the spe­cial teams. the Irish have devoted an exten­sive amount of their spring practice toward this area. Nick Setta will most likely contin­ue as the field goal kicker, and Setta and Joey Hildbold are battling for punting duties. However, Davie doesn't feel the Irish have a solid kickoff man. The primary con tenders for return spots include Vontez Duff, Julius Jones and Arnaz Battle.

Quick on his feet 
Speed, versatility key to quarterbacks game 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Sporrs Editor 
Kevin Hogers said it best. 
"The day and age of the immo­
bile quarterback, the guy with 
cement shoes on. is gone," the 
Irish offensive coordinator said 
all,ir a rncent practice. The mes­
sage is clear. No longer will the 
Irish stand for an immobile 
thrower. The future leaders in 
thn Irish backfield will look more 
like Michael Vick than Ron 
Powlus. 
Enter Carlyle lloliday. 
Tho rising sophomore quarter­
back can throw, as ho showed 
during his senior year at San 
Antonio's Hooscvelt High School, 
passing for 719 yards. 
"We tri,id to have the ball in 
his hands as much as we could," 
said Iloliday's high school coad1, 
Glim llill. "We didn't have the 
receivers that l'm sure he has 
them but he wa.'i able to get the 
ball thflre regardless." 
But I luliday's arm is only one 
of many aspects to his game. 
Hanktld 48th on the Chicago 
Sun-Times list of the top 100 
players in the country, Holiday 
totaled 876 yards and scored 13 
touchdowns on the ground in 
1999. And his skills extended 
beyond the gridiron. 
Irish head coach Bob Davie loves to talk about Holiday's ath­leticism. and with good mason. A fow· spurt letter-winner, the 6­foot-2 guard was a four-year starter on Hoosevclt's basketball team, finishing with more than 1,000 career points. lie also competed in track and field and baseball, clearing 6-6 in the high jump and starting in center field his senior year. Holiday also excelled in the 110-meter hur­dles during his two years on the track squad. 
Today, the 19-year old focuses on his goal of gaining playing time in the three-headed mon­ster that is the Irish quarterback position this spring. But he still finds time to show off an on­court talent that Ind schools such as Oregon and Wake Forest to rncruil Iloliday as a basketball player. 
A member of Diaper Dandies, along with teammates Abram Elam and Jerome Collins, 1loliday's Bookstore Basketball tnam has advanced to the final field of 16 teams in the tourna­ment. 
''I've never really seen any­thing like it," Iloliday said of the 30th annual Bookstore tourna­ment. "The people go out there and play hard no matter what, whatever skill level they are and just try to win. It's really com­petitive." 
So is th11 quarterback position. 
Coming to play 
After his stellar senior season, 1loliday was a hot commodity in recruiting circles. After talking to a variety of schools -includ­ing Texas A&M,where his older brother Terrell I laynes played in the late 1990's -he narrowed his choices down to Nebraska and Notre Dame. 
Although Nebraska had only Eric Crouch at quarterback and an offense that seemed more suited to his skills, Holidav chose to spend his college years in South Bend.

"I always wanted to come to Notrn Dame and be a quarter­back really," Holiday said. "Nebraska's a great program but I just felt this was the place for me really. Everybody wants to come here. It's basically been a dream of mine." 
When he arrived in the fall, it soon became apparent that there was much to learn. In high school, Holiday was allowed to roam free and use his athletic ability to take his team into the end zone. The focus was on results and athleticism, rather than teaching skills. 
"My high school offense really was based on mostly on athletic ability," Holiday said. "We didn't work on the fundamentals of being a quarterback really." 
As a result, Holiday's throwing abilities were behind the other quarterbacks. While his arm was strong, he struggled to get in position to make the pass. With the B.ogers' help, that ability is now harnessed." 
"There was a lot of mechanical work," Holiday said. "Coach Rogers has helped me signifi­cantly on that. I've got a quicker release now." 
Rising up 
While most players from Texas get chills just thinking about the unseasonably cold South Bend weather, Holiday's childhood helped him prepare for his col­lege years. With his father in the military, he spent his grammar school years living in Alaska. 
"It was nice. It was cold but it was nice," Holiday said. "It was a great experience to go through really, just to say you were up there." 
What Holiday didn't expect coming to Notre Dame was the amount of walking he would have to do. He was assigned to Carroll Hall, a small dorm roughly 10 minutes walking dis­tance from the center of' campus and nearly a mile away from ihe athletic facilities. 


"It's a cool hall but it's not cool when you've got to come all the way across campus to go to practice or something like that," Holiday said. "I say they need to supply us with trollies or some­thing. If you have a bike or a car it's cool. But I love it out there, the guys out there are cool." 
It was as a youngster on that military base in Alaska that Holiday first set his hands on a football. Even at age 8, every­body knew that he had the skills and leadership qualities to play quarterback. 
"That was something I wanted to do," Holiday said. "I had the ability to do it and everybody had faith in me to do that job." 
While manv focused on his athletic accomplishments, the place where Holiday felt he needed to excel most was in the classroom. In high school, he was a member of the National Honor society as well as taking part in a group that worked with the local city council. 
"We went to all their meetings and we partnered up with a commissioner. There were about 11 or us and 11 of them. We just partnered up and saw what they did, what it was like to run a city. It was fun." 
Holiday came to Notre Dame intending to major in computer engineering, but like many intended engineers, changed his mind and switched to the College of Business Administration, where he intends to major in marketing or finance. 
Still, Holiday contends that academics were one of the deciding factors in his decision to choose Notre Dame. 
"'Without that I wouldn't even be here right now," he said. "That was the first thing that I concentrated on in high school. That got me here. That's what I really like about me -my acad­emic accomplishments before my football accomplishments." 

Friends, not foes 
This spring, the Irish coaching staff decided to give each quar­terback an equal amount of rep­etitions in practice and let them battle for the starting spot. With Battle moved to flanker and Godsey now at tight end, only the three freshman compete only with each other for playing time. 
In fact, Davie has suggested a situation in which two, or possi­bly all three, will take snaps at critical moments during the sea­son. 
"We're going to have to use two in a game," Davie said. "There's too much ability at that position to say, OK, this guy's the quarterback and that's it. I could almost go out on a limb here in April and say you're going to see two quarterbacks playing; you may see three." 
Such a platoon system is just fine for Holiday. "It's OK with me," he said. "If it does happen you've just got to get in there and do whatever you can. Some people run it. H's worked and it has~·t work~d. It's up to Coach Davie really. 
While the coaches still say the position is wide open. Holiday concedes that it is unlikely either he or Clark will wrestle the start­ing spot away from LoVecchio. 
"Matt's played eight games," Holiday said. "He has a lot of experience and he's a smart kid. It'd be hard to say somebody could take his spot right then. You've just to go out and com­pete and try to get whatever you can." 
Holiday now feels more com­fortable playing the offense with the first team, as a result of his increased reps in practice. 
"Now this spring we're getting the same amount of reps," Holiday said. 'Tm learning a lot more, I'm starting to pick things up a lot faster." 
His only struggle so far is maintaining the same level of play day-in and day-out. In a scrimmage earlier this spring, he completed only one pass, fum­bled a snap and was "touch sacked" twice. He did. however, have two rushes for more than 10 yards. 
"My thing right now is that I need to develop a little bit of con­sistency," Holiday said. "It's been up and down in the spring. I just need to go out and keep compet­ing and when the game comes up try to do what l can. 
Despite the battle for playing time, the three freshman quar­terbacks remain close friends olT the field. 
"We're friends," Holiday said. "We talk about each other in a good way. It's a competitive thing at the quarterback situa­tion right now. It's a friendly thing, it's a friendly competition really. We just chill and when football's here we do that but wh~.n it's over, we just hang out. 
While Holiday looks forward to the chance to impress coachos in Saturday's Blue-Gold game, he is most excited about playing in front of a cheering crowd once again, an experience he missed for the first time in over 10 years last season. 
'Tm looking forward to play­ing in front of fans. really," he said. "It's been a long time."

Getting comfortable 
Clark learns offense, awaits chance to shine 

By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sporrs Writer 
For Jared Clark, this spring is not about a quarterback competition. It's about getting comfortable. 
Although he is one of three freshmen battling for a spot under center Sept. 8 in Lincoln, Neb. Clark said he is focusing more on learning the offense than trying to beat out his fellow classmates ­Carlyle Holiday and incum­bent starter Matt LoVccchio. 
"1 am trying to learn every­thing," Clark said. "Right now I am just trying to get better at every part of the game. I am getting better at reading the routes and the defense better now." 
It's hard to imagine that Clark couldn't feel comfort­able under center. The 6-foot­4, 220-pound freshman from Sarasota, Fla. was one of the most heralded high school seniors in the country when he signed with the Irish in Februarv, 2000. 
But upon arriving at Notre Dame, he quickly learned that college football is much faster and complex than anything he experienced on the high school gridiron. While his arm strength and athleticism made him successful in high school, his mind would become his most important attribute in college football. 
"You have to read the defense and know where to throw the ball, he said.
n 

"Everything has a purpose here rather than in high school when it was just 'go down and out and I'll throw you the ball.' [In college,] you have to read people because everything they do here is for a purpose." 
Although Clark is still wait­ing for his chance in shine under the Dome, he was

His first start didn't go as well as expected. Tampa Catholic, led by former Miami Hurricanes quarterback Kareem Kelly, blasted Clark's squad 27-7. 
"I didn't play real great," Clark said. "We ran like a wing-T offense so I didn't really do anything. I think I threw about three passes." 
Clark admits being thrust into the starting spotlight was a bit overwhelming for a 15­year old. 
"In high school, you are just a little kid when you are a freshman. It's kind of the same way here," he said. "You are just kind of in awe of how big everyone is. I was pretty nervous for that first game. I got used to it and I got better as the years went on." 



After starting as a sopho­more, Clark became the undisputed leader of the team his junior and senior season. As a junior, he threw eight touchdowns and rushed for 11 while throwing just six inter­ceptions. 
He was even better as a senior. He accounted for 27 total touchdowns his senior year -10 rushing and 17 passing -as he led his high school to one of its best sea­sons ever. Cardinal Mooney advanced to the third round of the playoffs beforp losing to the eventual state champions. 
He was also named first team all-state quarterback despite missing 2 1/2 games because of pn!:)Umonia. 
Despite his high school suc­cess, many colleges wanted Clark to play defense in col­lege. He started as a line­backer and defensive end. But Clark's heart was always at quarterback. 
"All those schools wanted me for quarterback and that is definitely the position I want to play," Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune when he committed to Notre Uame. "I would've played defense only if there weren't any other options. Fortunately that wasn't the case." 
best attribute compared to the other two quarterbacks is his arm strength. He gives the nod for rushing to Holiday. 
"I feel like I can run the ball if I need to," he said. "I am not as fast as Carlyle so I can't run it as well as he can but I think I can get good enough at it that I can be effective." 
Clark said he had no reser­vations about signing with Notre Dame even though he knew head coach Bob Davie had commit­
and the three potential quar­terbacks, for now, are more interested in helping each other improve than making each other look bad. 
"I think it's definitely friend­ly between the three of us. We're friends off the field and we're friends on it," Clark said. "We are all trying to do our best. When anyone comes off the field, we try to help them. They come off the field, they ask questions. When I come off the field, I ask ques­
tions. We tell

not going to win the starting job here, I am probably not going to be good enough to go to the next level anyways so I should probably try to get a good education." 
Clark also had a pretty good idea about the competition he would face in the future.

Holiday's run­ning skills can't be ignored. But in the last scrimmage open to the media, Clark looked the sharpest.

Experience prevails 
Coaches fall back on lo Vecchio sexperience in quarterback decision 

By ANDREW SOUKUP As.socia1e Sports Editor 
Last f'riday, Bob Davio addrnssed one or the biggf1st con­troversies surrounding the Notre Dame football squad. 
Who was going to bn the 2001 quarterback? 
Would he go with the calm, experienced Matt Lovecchio, who led the Irish to a Fiesta Bowl berth? Or would he settle on either Carlyle Holiday or Jared Clark, two highly-touted quarter­backs who haven't played a down'! 
lie did noithnr. 

"I could almost go out on a limb hem in April and say you'rn going to Sl'e two quartt!rbacks playing; you may sec thnw," Davie said. 
But when asked to name the probabln startPr, Davie rnsponded without lwsitation. 
Ilis man: Matt LoVncchio 

The Audition 
It's hard to imagine that one year ago LoVecchio was getting ready for his high school prom. I le took a 2-2 team reeling from a hL-.;t-second loss against Michigan State and led them to seven straight wins. The experience LoVecchio gained last season is what made him the most attrac­tive starting candidate. 
"The advantage Matt LoVccchio has is he's played in high-profile games," Davie said. 
The highest-profile game Lovecchio played in was the 41-9 loss in the Fiesta Bowl. But he said the pressure didn't faze him. Instead, he found himself in an unfamiliar position -trailing. 
"We were just put in a situation where we got behind," he said. "One thing led to another and it just snowballed." 
Despite the loss, Davie knew Lovecchio got something out of playing in the Fiesta Bowl. 
"Part of becoming a successful quarterback is to get your butt kicked a little bit," he said. "Certainly he had it in the Fiesta Bowl. That's got to be worth something. It L,; in my mind." 
Center Stage 
The composure LoVecchio showed after the Fiesta Bowl loss reflected the calm demeanor that
-made him the preferred choice last season. Davie and offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers picked Lovecchio because he had the best grasp of the system. not nec­essarily because he had the most athletic ability. LoVecchio didn't disappoint. He came out game after game and performed solidly. In his seven wins, LoVecchio threw for 11 touchdowns and just one inter­ception. Had he been eligible, he would have finished seventh in the nation in pa<;sing ellkiency. But when spring practice opened, Davie made it clear the quarterback job was wide open. Although LoVecchio had the expe­rience, lloliday and Clark could potentially overtake the freshman. ft Ir those other two quarter­backs play better than Matt, how much better are they?" Davie said. "That's the decision we have

to make. They're going to have to be a lot better to overtake the experience factor that he has. Are they capable of doing that? Sure, they are. They're both very talent­ed players." 
"As far as they're concerned, in their minds they believe they have a chance to be the starting quar­terback here," Rogers said. "That's what I want." 
Davie gave all three quarter­backs an equal opportunity to shine. But having to share snaps and watch didn't faze LoVecchio. He continued to do what he does best -stay quiet and work hard. 
'Tm just going to go out there each day and get better this spring," he said. 
LoVecchio had to share playing time with Holiday and Oark. He watched as Holiday and Clark, each with a year on the sidelines, showed just as much talent and potential. 
"You don't have to talk about competition at that position," Davie said. "There is competi­tion." 
"I legitimately am busting my tail to make sure everyone's get­ting equitable reps," Rogers said after one practice. "Some guys do better than others, but they're all getting better and they're all qual­ity players." 
Day after day, Davie said the quarterbacks kept getting better and better. One day, Clark would shine, and the next, Lovecchio would step up. 
"There hasn't been one guy that has been consistently better than the others," Rogers said. 
"Competition brings out the best in everyone," Davie said. "There's no question at that position, the standard has been raised because of those three young guys. 


"Every day out here a different quarterback steps up and a differ­ent quarterback impresses you," he continued. "There's a fine line between each one ofthem." 
Staying In the Spotlight 
So how did Lovecchio distin­guish himself -again? 
"I think I'm just taking it day by day and working as hard as I can," he said. 
If LoVecchio won't say his expe­rience is a factor, his teammates will. 
"Matt's played eight games," Holiday said. "That's a lot of experience and he's a smart kid. It would be hard to say someone could take his spot. You just have to go out and compete, and get whatever you can out ofit." 
There's no tension between LoVecchio, Holiday and Clark. All three are good friends on and off the field. 
"It's a good situation," LoVecchio said. "Since we got here in August, everything's been good. We hang out on and off the field and we're there to help each other." 
"We just push him to be a bet­ter person and player, just like he pushes us," Holiday added. 
When Davie effectively named Lovecchio the No. 1 quarterback, it wasn't as much a matter of him playing significantly better in spring than the other quarter­backs. Talent-wise, all three quarterbacks are very close. LoVecchio's experience sets him apart. 
"It's the combination of where he's been where he's played, and who we play early that gives him the advantage," Davie said. "You think about going to Lincoln, Neb., going to College Station, you like the idea that you've got a quarterback that's been in a 
game."· 
"The fact remains that we are playing Nebraska in the first game-away," Rogers said. 
Lovecchio admits there's a lot of pressure associated with being the quarterback at Notre Dame. 
"If you actually sat down and thought about it, things can get pretty overwhehning," he said. "I try to avoid all the talk and just go out there each day and go to practice." 
"Matt's been tremendous," Davie said. "Sure, all the conver­sation's going to be about those guys that didn't play. That's just what it is here at Notre Dame. I think Matt's mature enough to understand that." 
It's this calm, confident demeanor that sets LoVecchio apart. Despite all the attention focused on him last season and the quarterback situation this season, he loves playing football and he loves Notre Dame. 
"I'd never trade this for any­thing," he said. "Football got me to Notre Dame, and I love this team. I'm happy." 
Sharing the Lead 
But is Lovecchio only happy because he played last year? It's hard to tell -and nobody knows how long Lovecchio will start. Davie isn't saying for certain that the quarterback job is just LoVecchio's. 
"There's too much ability at that position to say, OK, this guy's the quarterback and that's it," he said. 
Davie made it obvious LoVecchio will lead the Irish onto the field against Nebraska. But after that, it's up in the air. 
"It's a long season, and all three of them have long careers here, so that can change," he said. "It all depends on performance." 
Regardless of how much he ends up playing, LoVecchio plans on doing what he does best ­working hard. 
"We just mind our business and work hard on the field," he said about what the coaches plan to do with the quarterbacks. 'Tm just going to go out each day and get better." 
"Sometimes the guy that's played doesn't get as much atten­tion," Davie said. "He's handled it great. He has a tremendous upside. He's made improvement this spring. I'm really pleased with him." 
That's why Lovecchio is the No. 1.
