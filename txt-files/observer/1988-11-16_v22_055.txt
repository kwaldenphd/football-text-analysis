IN BRIEF 
Stephen Preston, agradua~estudentin the ~epartment of Civil Engineering, has received a 1988 Envrronm~ntal Conservation Fellowship of $7500 from the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. Preston, a native of Philadelphia, was graduated from Shippenburgh State University in Pennsylvania. He earned a master's degree in environmental engineering from the University of Florida at Gainesville and studied at the University of Minnesota before coming to Notre Dame, where he is pursuing a doctoral degree in civil engineering. At Notre Dame Preston's research concerns the measurement of toxic ~ubstances which pollute tributaries of the Great Lakes. -The Observer

Campus inanities drive me to near insanity 
There's nothing like checkmarking to 
heighten one's sense of the ridiculous. I sat out­
side Stepan Center for over two hours, catching 
a cold for a class I don't even like. It is at times 
like these that I learn the true meaning of the 
concept of "Every man for himself," as people 
that I normally consider to be halfway civilized 
become monsters as they fight for classes. 
This optimum situation put all of us in such a wonderful frame of mind that we found our­selves griping not only about the uselessness of the checkmarking system, but about the world in general. Thus, I decided to collaborate with my companions in the language lines to compile a list of other inanities to be found around campus: 
The fruitflies have returned to the mirrors of 
Farley; now when I blow-dry my hair, I find 
myself wondering what forms of insect life are 
finding thier way into my scalp. 
The cereal dispensers in the dining halls are about as useful as trying to build a snowman in the summertime: either you can count the number of Rice Krispies that come out on one hand, or a sudden avalanche yields more than I could eat in a week. To top it off, the dispensers won't fit under your shirt. 
People buy trash bags just to fill them with garbage and throw them away. It costs more to dry a load of laundry than it does to wash it. 
The doors of O'Shaughnessy Hall open out­wards. For people like me, who find walking challenging as it is, the added stress of worrying about dodging potentially deadly doors is too difficult. Not only that, when they are standing open it is impossible to read the room number. 
Why is there a food name chili when it is meant to be served hot? 
People applaud with greater enthusiasm for the unfortunate individual who strips and sends his main course flying through the dining hall than for any other person or event on campus. 
The Detex outside the main doors of Farley is so far away from the door itself that in order. to insert my Detex, open the door and juggle whatever I happen to be carrying I really need a third arm. 
It is more difficult to smuggle food out of the dining hall than it is to pass through United States customs with undeclared goods. Trust me-I've tried both. 
The number of clocks in the classrooms of

O'Shaughnessy is decreasing at an increasingly rapid rate. 
Local bars are no longer allowed to advertise in student publications, and the "Buzz Bus" has been changed to "Weekend Wheels" to avert references to the a-word, yet the University con­tinues to allow all-hall semi-formals to be called "Screw Your Roommate." 
The last time I ordered a Leprechaun pizza, the person delivering it arrived carrying the box sideways. If I'd wanted a crepe I would have ordered one. 
By the time the student directories arrive, the year will be over. 
I could walk into the infirmary with a broken nose and the first thing they would do still would be to take my temperature. 
It took me over an hour to exercise my right to vote because there was one voting booth in Stepan Center. Could that be a statement about the amount of political activity on this campus? 
The dining hall operates more efficiently than the College of Arts and Letters' system of course registration.

"I'm not sure they are united," Savisaar said in an in­terview Tuesday. 
Deputies are expected to divide approximately along ethnic lines, as many law­makers who are ethnic Rus­sians or members of other ethnic groups do not share the Estonians' views. 
Ethnic Estonians hold 180 seats in the parliament, but need 189 for a two-thirds majority, according to the People's Front. 
Deputies were being in­tensely lobbied Tuesday as proponents and opponents of the amendments tried to win their votes, said Tarmu Tam­merk, a Tallinn journalist working with the People's Front.

'Security Week' planned at SMC 
By JOANNA GRILLO Staff Reporter 
Plans for a future Security Awareness Week were intro­duced at Tuesday's joint meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance-Programming Board. 
"The plans for this event come out of our concern for safety and security on our campus," said Student Body President Julie Parrish. 
The tentative Security Awareness Week is scheduled to take place early into the Spring semester. One of the goals of the event is to better inform the students on matters of personal safety, including the dangers of walking alone at night. 
Other topics of interest in­clude the results of the Foun­der's Day student survey. 
"The survey's were really positive. We are very pleased with the results," said Parrish. 
Students expressed the most concern over items such as the improvement of social life, residence life, expansion, di­versity and better relations with Notre Dame. Comments directed toward student gov­ernment were all positive. Stu­dents praised members for their availability, openness and willingness to talk with stu­dents. 
Requests for more campus wide events and service proj­ects were also voiced. 

The completion of the student wide survey marks the ac­complishment of one of student government's goals for the school year.

PLO chief calls for 
U.S. move in Israel 
Associated Press 
ALGIERS, Algeria--Pales­tinian Liberation Organization Chief Yasser Arafat said Tues­day it was up to the United States to make the next move toward Middle East peace now that the Palestinians have formed an independent state that implicitly recognizes Is­rael. 
"The ball is now in the Amer­ican court," Arafat said a few hours after the Palestine Na­tional Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, solemnly proclaimed Palestinian inde­pendence in a ceremony early 
Tuesday. The declaration accepted 
U.N. Security Council Resolu­tion 242, which implicitly recognizes Israel when it refers to the right of all countries in the region to live within secure and recognized borders. 
The proclamation topped the list of issues taken up during the council's four-day special session in Algeria, which ended Tuesday. The 450-member council also voted to form a provisional government at a fu­ture date and pledged to restrict guerrilla operations to military targets in Israeli­occupied territories.

Flaherty said that the policy is confusing to all involved and 

tion, senate members are hope­ful the University will take ac­tion. "There is good communication between the senate and administration," said the Senate Chair F. Ellen Weaver. "Often, in very serious matters, the adminis­tration has listened to the recommendations of the senate and acted upon them." 
Resolution co-author Fallon said he was "dismayed that the University allowed the Bush campaign to give a political rally under the guise of a Uni­versity sponsored lecture." Fallon said that he hoped the resolution would be a step towards ~nding the commer­cialization of candidates and returning politics to the issues.

Red dots hurt ecosystem 

Dear Editor: 
Did you know that we have enough atomic weapons to destroy the world 45 times? Yes, we know. How many times have you heard this since you were in grade school? And yet we learn it again. I awoke to a very unpleasant sight Mon­day morning --6,000 red dots had in­fected our beautiful campus. They are stuck on the sidewalks, trees, buildings and even on Moses. Not just aestheti­cally destructive --but also a vast and abrasive denial of the sanctity of na­ture. Great. Just great. For the "nth" time we learn about the wickedness of the large numbers of nukes and the result is an infringement upon the ecosystem. Is there no sanctity for God's green earth anymore? 
United Campuses to Prevent Nuclear War shows us a real problem by causing another real problem: Ecodestruction. Now these innocent looking dots are slowly but surely losing their red dye and it's seeping into the soil. Sure, the hideous results may not 
Doonesbury 
be visible now --but just wait 20 years. That red dye will contaminate immense amounts of the ecosystem of Notre Dame. Future Notre Dame students will wake up feeling a little nauseous for some mysterious reason. And it won't be from too much alcohol con­sumed the night before. It will be from that damn red dye spread by UCAM twenty years earlier. Good job guys. Two wrongs don't make a right.

MBA summer school invites students 
Dear Editor: 

Summer is usually a time for relaxa­tion, for play; a general break from the pressures of school. There are those of us, however, who also have the oppor­tunity to study throughout the summer. Yes --thanks to a program developed by the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago, summer school can become an opportunity of a lifetime. 
The Chicago Business Fellow pro­gram was developed about five years ago as a marketing strategy for the nor­mally conventional business school. They wanted to see what effect under­graduate majors besides business would make on the homogeneous envi­ronment at the "B-school." 
The result: an invitation for students at liberal arts colleges to see what busi­ness school is all about. Two students are chosen from each of the fifteen to twenty small colleges involved in the program. A scholarship which pre-pays tuition expenses for up to three courses is given to each student. The classes, which are with the other summer MBA students, are supplemented with weekly non-credit management semi-

nars given by leaders in business, and also with several corporate visits. 
All in all, the summer was one that none of us involved would have missed. Although the thought of MBA studies was intimidating at first, the staff at University of Chicago made us feel like a part of the university community from day one. It was an academic, pro­fessional, and personal opportunity of a lifetime.

For the finale, Lori is sucked through a giant, Batman-like roller to be com­pressed wafer thin and as flat as old 7-UP. Not to worry, all that needs be done is to add water and you have an in­stant 3-D woman. 
Lori, by all means, is not the only member of the team exposing herself to danger. Stuart, always managing to stay in front of the act, ex­poses himself in a different manner when he performs his hilarious rendition of a magician's version of a male stripper. Relax, it's just an illusion... or maybe not.

evaluated on tone quality, balance and blend, -diction, intonation, rhythm, arid ex­pression. A third commen­tator will meet with each choir after their performance and work with them on these points. 
Dr. Nancy Merik, coordina­tor of the event, feels that all-women's choirs don't get many opportunities to per­form, so the festival is held really "to promote women's vocal ensemble." 
The choirs will be perform­ing during the morning and afternoon and there will also be a performance by the Saint Mary's College Wo­men's Choir. Members of the various choirs will have the opportunity to take a guided tour of the campus and to eat in the dining hall. Dr. Merik concludes that this event will give the high schools a 
chance to hear a good wo­men's choir perform and to see what Saint Mary's College is all about.

hat you see is what you get. ..or maybe not, es­pecially when you're dealing with an illusionist. Stuart MacDonald and his lovely as­sistant Lori perform "A Night of Illusion" Thursday at 9 p.m. in Washington Hall. The show is centered around illusion, (hence the title) but that's not all--comedy, suspense, glamour, and music also play a vital role in the production. 
Stuart, born in Topeka, Kansas, found his calling early in life and began per­fecting his act as a young teen. He studied illusions, sleight of hand, and manipulation until he earned the title "virtuoso." His now famous routine has taken him halfway around the world and landed him a spot in the Soci­ety of Magician's Hall of Fame in Hollywood, Califor­nia. 
Lori, the ultimate team player, allows herself to be sliced in three, floats, trans­forms into Stuart, and gets locked in a small wicker bas­ket as Stuart thrusts five Hindu steel swords deep into her body. 
Always looking for a new thrill, Stuart locks Lori in cuffs, ties her in a sack, and secures her in an airtight trunk. Feeling remorse for his dastardly act, however, Stuart, with much swagger

both should help the Irish in an area of weakness--rebounding. 
Junior Cathy Emigholz, who has been hitting the boards hard for the Irish as of late and sophomore Krissi Davis, who must compensate for a distinct height disadvantage under­neath with hard work and hustle, have been fighting it out in practice trying to claim the final spot in the lineup as a for­ward. 
Emigholz and Davis have been pushed from behind as well, as two talented twin tow­ers, freshmen Margaret Nowlin and Jennifer Tranel, should provide the power under the boards and take some of the scoring pressure off Bunek in the key.

Tennis sends 4 to regionals 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's top four wo­men's tennis players have been invited to participate in the ITCA Rolex Regional Tourna­ment Nov. 17-20 in Madison, Wis. 
CeCe Cahill, Katie Clark, Tracy Barton and Kristy Doran will compete against 64 of the Midwest's best collegiate players. The top two singles finishers and the number-one doubles team will qualify for the national tournament next February. 
All four of the women will compete in the singles draw, while the combinations of Cahill-Barton and Clark-Doran will vie for the doubles crown. Kim Pacella and Ann Brad­shaw have been named as al­ternates and also will attend the meet. 

Irish coach Michele Gelfman hopes that the team will con­tinue its recent intense level of play. 
"We hit with the best of them at our last meet in Houston," Gelfman said. "I hope we can carry our confidence into this tournament and avenge our earlier losses to Indiana." 
Cahill has been seeded fifth, and Gelfman believe she has a good chance of advancing at least as far as the quarter­finals. 
"CeCe, and the entire team, 
Crawford works way to walk-on position 
How would you like to have to sit on the bench and never 
get a chance to play until the game is out of reach? OK, let's put it another way. How would you like to have the crowd erupt whenever 
you pull off the sweatpants and check in at the scorer's table? How would you like to have everyone in the arena want you to shoot the ball whenever you get your hands on it? 
For two years, Tim Crawford wished to experience all three of these. And after the basketball walk-on tryouts on Oct. 24 in the Joyce ACC Pit under the scrupulous eyes of the Irish coaching staff, Crawford got his wish. 
The 6-4 junior, a native of Frankenmuth, Mich., was cho­sen from a bastion of hopefuls that evening to be the tradi­tional Notre Dame basketball walk-on for the 1988-89 season. 
"I've felt since I've been here that we should have a walk-on to represent the student body," said Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps. "We've been doing this for 18 years now." 
will have to take one match at a time," Gelfman remarked. "We're up against the best of the Midwest, and we will have to keep our heads and play our toughest tennis. We'd be foolish to look any further than the first round." 
Gelfman feels this tourna­ment will be a big test for Clark, Barton and Doran, who all are freshmen. 
"With such a young team, this may be where our inexperi­ence might show," Gelfman commented. "However, the girls are all playing well." 
Gelfman added that if some­one finishes in the top three or four, she hopes they will receive at-large invitations to the national tournament.

"Tim has tried out every year and he's done well in Bookstore, which is another thing we look at. And he went to our summer camp for several years as a kid. He's just very wired to Notre Dame and Notre Dame basketball." 
With the departure of Steve Nicgorski and Chris Nanni last May to graduation, the walk-on spot was empty and ready to be filled by a member of this basketball-crazy student body. Bookstore Basketball and afternoons at the Rockne Memorial are just two ready times for former high school standouts to display their talents. 
Both of those environs have been familiar ones to Craw­ford, who last April was named Most Valuable Player in the Bookstore All-Star Game and in his freshman year was named to the all-tournament squad. 
Crawford has worked diligently on his game and his grades--the accounting major was named to the Dean's List last semester--to make sure he was ready when opportunity knocked. 
"I tried out freshman and sophomore years," said Craw­ford, "but their really wasn't much opportunity with those two guys already on the team. But I went to the Rock everyday to play and lift and played with guys from the team and always tried to improve my game hoping that at some point I could do this." 
Besides the springtime laurels, he came to Notre Dame with an impressive list of credentials. Among them are being nominated to the McDonald's All-American high school basketball team, two years as second-team all-state in Michigan, two years as academic all-state and a starting spot on both the Basketball Coaches Association on Mic­higan All-Star Game and the Best of Michigan vs. Best of Iowa contest. 
During his senior year in high school, Crawford averaged 24 points and 11 rebounds per outing and led his team to the state's regional finals two years running before bowing out both time's to a team led by Temple's sophomore sen­sation Mark Macon. 
Temple is just one of the four pre-season Top 20 teams on the Irish home basketball schedule, along with Duke, Louiville and Syracuse. 
"I'll have the best seat in the house for those games," joked Crawford. 
Crawford was recruited by Minnesota and Penn State, but fell in love with the Air Force Academy, recieved an appointment and planned on going there until he was told on June 1 that problems with his hearing would keep him out. "So there I was without a school," said Crawford. Notre Dame was the only school I had applied to and only place I wanted to go if I couldn't play basketball. I decided to come here a week before school started and decided to just work as hard as I could to make the team." 
The work has paid of and he is now doing what he always wanted to do--play for a Division I basketball team. 
"So far I'm loving it," said Crawford. "I'm having a great time, and I've learned more in three weeks about the game of basketball than I did in four years of high school. I'm still trying to get familiar with the strategies and defenses. 
"But as far as being the walk-on, I don't feel any different than somebody on scholarship. I'm treated the same and I feel as much a part of the team as anyone else. I put my shorts on one leg at a time like everybody else does." 
Crawford knows not to expect too much, even though his services become all the more valuable with only 12 team members. 
"If you expect too much," said Phelps of a walk-on's status, "you'll get nothing. But on the other hand if you

The cork is ready to pop 
Aging process adds experience to women's basketball 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
"Vintage." 
That is sophomore Karen Robinson's preseason prog­nosis for the Notre Dame wo­men's basketball team. 
The Irish have had to shelve hopes for an NCAA bid through the growing years of the pro­gram, but like a good wine, they have matured and are now ready to uncork the type of ex­plosive play that nearly earned them their first trip to the NCAA's last year. 
It will be up to an intimidat­ing trio--Robinson and senior co-captains Heidi Bunek and Lisa Kuhns--to provide the combination of experience and speed that the Irish will need to propel them past opponents and into the national spotlight. 
Robinson will have her work cut out for her this year. She will try to fill the shoes of graduate Mary Gavin, who ran the point for the Irish last year with precision en route to es­tablishing herself as the most prolific passer in Notre Dame history. 
Robinson's great speed al­lows her to get the ball down the court quickly on offense and create scoring situations off the fast break. But it is her quick hands defensively which are of­ten the key to getting the team's transition game going. 

She will have two choice tar­gets this year, with Bunek bearing the brunt of the scoring inside and Kuhns keeping the defense honest on the outside with her ability to hit the three­pointer. 
The Irish will be without last year's one-two punch of Bunek and Botham underneath the boards, as Botham has shifted responsibilities, from player to coach, by becoming a graduate assistant. 
So the Irish coaching staff is counting on Bunek, the preseason player of the year in the Midwestern Collegiate Con­ference, to make more than a modest contribution this year. 
"Heidi's going to have to do it all for us this year," said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw, "It's as simple as that. We need her to score about 20 points a game, if not more, and she's got to hit the boards in double figures for us to be successful. 
Kuhns will offer the Irish a dangerous threat from the three-point stripe and around the perimeter as she tallied a three-pointer in each of her last 23 games last year, for an im­pressive .429 shooting percentage. 
But.both will need help from their teammates if the Irish are to maintain a fast-paced run­ning game. 
Sophomore Sara Liebscher should join Kuhns as an off­guard and help take some of the pressure of Robinson with her playmaking ability and consistent shooting from the outside. 
Liebscher's accuracy, which helped her tally a .516 shooting percentage from the field last year, should also help the Irish deal with hole left in the lineup by senior Diondra Toney's con­tinued absence due to last year's knee injury. 
Junior Carol Elliot, who's hard work as a walk-on recently earned her a scholar­ship, should see playing time this year at point guard and freshmen Deb Fitzgerald and walk-on Maureen Nelligan should add depth to the Irish backcourt. 
Junior Annie Schwartz and freshman Comalita Haysbert both provide the Irish with quickness on the perimeter, either filling the lanes on the fastbreak or scoring off a jump shot from the set offense and
