The second recommendation was for the university to do all possible to stimulate recruitment on campus by educational institutions. It further recom­mended that "visible attempts to improve the Educational Place­ment Service should be made." After a minor change in wording suggested by Rich Meckel it was quickly passed. 
The third recommendation called for the Placement Bureau to provide funds for a column explaining the policies of organizations doing recruiting on campus. This column would pos­

sible be printed in the Observer or the Scholastic. After much debate and amendment the reso­lution was passed. 
The fourth recommendation asked that interested members of this university be allowed and encouraged to man an area "not a great distance from" the Place­ment Bureau office in order to present to students information, either pro or con, concerning the practices and policies of inter­viewing organizations. After dis­cussion and minor changes in wording ("not a great distance from" to "near") the measure was passed. _ 
The next two recommenda­tions passed were very similar. The first asked the university to 
have the Placement Bureau en­courage recruitment by socially-
VISTA. The other called for the Placement Bureau to integrate summer employment opportuni­ties by groups such as Cila and VISTA into its program. 
The seventh recommendation asked for a reciprocal open poli­cy for the Placement Offices of Notre Dame and St. Mary's. The university was also requested to explore all possibilities of the merger of the two offices. This recommendation was quickly passed by the SLC. 
The next measure to be voted on was Ted Jones' recommenda­tion to charge all profit-making organizations doing recruitment on campus a fee of from $50 to $75 dollars. This was quickly

would have complete judicial 
power over cases of cheating and 
the like. In the area of student 
complaints, it would take the 
form of a formal recommenda­
tion to the concerned depart­
ment head. 

Faculty members could 
submit any case of cheating or 
plagiarism to the council, and 
students owuld use the council 
as an appeals board after first 
consulting the teacher concerned 
and their advisors. 

The Academic Affairs Com­
mittee has issued an outline of 
the proposal which summarizes 
the idea of an appeals council. 
"This would not be 'just another 
committee' in a bureaucratic 
structure. This would be the one 
body empowered to accept com­
plaints from both sides, giving 
direction and guidlines in an 
academic area where none exist­
ed before," the committee state­
ment concluded. 

At tonight's meeting the com­
mittee will discuss the measure 
and recommend action to the 

campus 

which open discussion is a hall­mark then where even the possi­bility of discussion is non-exis­tent, the university should not involve itself (classified research, e.g.). Because It is the stated policy of The Central Intelli­gence Agency not to engage in discussion in any kind of form, even for the sake of defending its actions and operations, this agency should not be allowed to use campus interview facilities." This recommendation met with much debate, and was finally passed by a 13 to 8 vote. Those voting against the proposal were Observer editor Guy DeSapio, Mr. Faccenda, Mr. Hogan, Dean Lawless, Fr. McCarragher, Mr.

The Model United Nations Committee announced that the preliminary delegate list for the Model U.N. would be posted Monday morning in the Huddle. 
Aside from this posting, each delegate will be informed of his country and block by mail when the delegate information packets go out this month. 
Delegate Director Tim Walch emphasized that there were still many delegation spots open. "Only fifty-three delegations are represented thus far," Walch said, "And anyone who wishes to sign up may still do so by sending their delegate fee to me at 237 Breen-Phillips."

Rep. criticizes budget 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-Chair­man George H. Mahon of the House Appropriations Commit­tee said Monday President Nixon's new budget will raise the national debt by more than $7 billion. Even so, he said it provides little extra money for new programs like cleaning up the environment. 
The Texas Democrat said un­less Congress is willing to raise taxes, it should not try to boost Nixon's spending proposals.

facilities 

Norling, Fr. Riehle and Fr. Schiltz. Many arguments pro and con were given. Fr. Riehle and Mr. Norling felt that the CIA was a necessary evil in this world. Dean Lawless cited the Berlin Airlift and the Cuban Missile Crisis as examples where the CIA was essential to this country's security and as such should not be banned on cam­pus. DeSapio felt that whether or not the CIA would consent to any discussion was unimportant since nothing new would be learned from such a discussion. 
The SLC also passed a motion asking the Placement Bureau to inform companies that the uni­versity is an open community and that they were free to send representatives to address the student body on their activities. 
The student body would be informed of the companies that were interested in such a pro­gram. If enough students were interested in hearing them speak the companies would be asked to send a representative. The Placement Bureau would also be directed to ask a company to send someone to talk about the company's activities if l 00 mem­bers of the community asked for such a meeting through a peti­tion. 
Auto accident, vandalism mar Mardi Gras weekend 
The injury of a Notre Dame student in a car accident was revealed by Arthur Pears, Direc­tor of Security, in an interview
yesterday. On February 4, a vehicle driven by John Hancock 
Other incidents were also re­vealed by Pears. The large iroii gate of St. Mary's was found torn off on Saturday morning. Four cases of larceny were re­ported from Stepan Center over the weekend. All four incidents ·were the theft of coats during 
Mardi Gras. 
A series of vandalism on Feb­

ruary 7 is believed to have been 
caused by visiting students, 
probably from Marquette Uni­
versity. In Badin Hall, a banister 
was wrecked and a lavatory 
water pipe were damaged. In 
Holy Cross Hall, windows were 
broken. In Grace Hall, a thermo­
stat and several light fixtures 
were destroyed. In Flanner Hall,

panel were broken. Campus

about schools and all these other 
good programs,"  he  told  news­ 
men.  
"The  trouble  is  nobody  is  
shouting  in  a  loud  voice  that  

somebody has got to raise the money to pay the bills. We can't have all these glamorous new programs unless we find more revenues," he said. 
Austerity was the theme as Mahon's committee began its formal review of Nixon's $200.8 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 which shows a $1.3 billion surplus on the "uni­fied books." 
Treasury Secretary David M. Kennedy, Budget Director Rob­ert P. Mayo and Chairman Paul 
W. McCracken of the Council of Economic Advisors all insisted tight control on spending is needed to combat inflation. 
"The fiscal 1971 budget is an anti-inflationary budget...a pru­dent budget...as lean as we could make it," Mayo said. 
Mahon said although Nixon's budget is balanced on the "uni­fied" accounting system, it would be $7.1 billion in the red if the government still keeps its books the way it did before 1969. 
The government's overall bud­get figures now include, in addi­tion to regular day to day opera­tions, the income and expendi­tures by trust funds such as those set up exclusively to pay for Social Security and high­ways. 
Mahon said general funds must borrow at least $7 billion from the trust funds in the new budget, thus pushing the nation­al debt to above the $377 billion limit. Kennedy agreed that the limit must be raised again this year. 
"I point out these important facts in the hope that the head­lines in the papers indicating a budget surplus will not generate an atmosphere of complacency," Mahon said.

Editorials: 

Southern hypocrites? 
The Southern governors engaged in a remarkable hypocrisy over the weekend in their statements about the Supreme Court's orders for immediate school desegregation in their states. 
Ever since the Court's ruling setting Feb. 1 as the desegregation deadline Southern Governors have been attempting through the Courts to gain extra time to implement the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation order. Time and time again their appeals have been turned down. Some of the Governors like John McKeither of Louisiana are still trying. 
We believe in the Supreme Court's orders and civil rights decisions. We feel however that the Southern states have every right to appeal for more time through the courts. The Southern governors' suggestions made through their meeting in Mobile over the weekend suggest however that they will not be willing to abide eventually by the courts' conclusions. If the courts do not rule in the State's favor, one governor suggests, the States will have to move on their own with actions even if they are contrary to the Supreme Court's orders. 
Some of the Governors in question have been the prime proponents for law and order. They will be the first to argue that the government should clamp down on law breakers, make the streets safe, and teach all those who engage in civil disobedience respect for the laws of the United States. 
Now the shoe is on the other foot. When faced with a law which they don't particularly like, some of the governors seem very willing to ask the people of their states to break the law-to oppose the integration efforts. A governor's responsibility is to engender respect for the law of the land, to see it is enforced. We feel that governors who encourage their citizens to break the law should be held accountable for their actions. 
At the same time, the governors have a legitimate case when they argue that civil rights laws are not uniformly enforced. In many of the urban centers in the North, there is commensurate inequity. We hope that the Justice Department will make strides to ensure that the Civil Rights Laws are pushed with equal vigor in Northern States. 
That simple fact, however, does not exonerate the South or justify their arguments for more time. They have been given 15 years advance notice of the move. It is time that they are forced to move. Every effort should be ,ma_9_eto help individual communities to overcome their local problems-but the time has come to act-for justice's sake. 

Favor Nutting 

The recent action by several Notre Dame and St. Mary's students asking that the pre­sent offi~e of Uni~ersit~ President be divided into a Presidency and a Chancellorship de­serves senous consideratiOn by the Board of Trustees. 
The idea has been brought up almost every year since Father Hesburgh began spending a large amount of time away from campus working to enhance the national stature of the University. The question asked is whether the present practice of having a Vice-President act as President while Fr. Hesburgh is away is adequate for Notre Dame. 
Critics point to the confiscation of Vasciline last spring and this fall's Dow-CIA demonstration, as questioning whether or not the tensions could have been avoided if a President, instead of an Acting President, had been here. 
Others though insist that the events would have occurred whether or not the University's acknowledged head had been here. They say that at all times, the Acting President has full power and is free to make decisions during times of crisis. Critics counter, however, by suggesting that most confrontation could be avoided if students had a recognized full time President with whom they had repour and with whom they were in constant communication. 
What, if any changes are needed, could best be ascertained through a thorough study of the problem. The Trustees now examine the President and the Vice-Presidents each year to see whether or not they should be replaced. We think the Trustees should make a thorough examination of the Chancellor-President idea this year and make some sort of affirmative statement. 
The discussions have reached a peak on campus during the last couple of weeks with the Scholastic issue on the potential successors to Father Hesburgh and the Willis Nutting for President Campaign. 
Professor Nutting has indeed made a remarkable contribution to Notre Dame. Through the years, students who have come in contact with him have acknowledged his ability to spark enthusiasm for intellectual pursuit-a rarity in many classrooms today. Such a talent is a rare gift-privileged is the university that has such men-privileged is the 
student who has the opportunity to sit in on such an individual's class. 
We cannot comment on Professor Nutting's and any of the individuals mentioned in the Scholastic articles qualifications for the office of President. We feel however that it is a remarkable tribute to Professor Nutting that his students would feel so strongly about his character and concern for students that they would propose that he be made University President. Although we do not feel that it would be appropriate to comment on the Nutting for President Campaign other than to say that we add one voice to paying tribute to an admirable faculty member.

Campus politics has undergone dramatic changes in the last four

in style. Not since early in the 1960's has ND been plagued with 
dull, year after year conformity among student political leaders. 
Times have changed indeed! 
It all started back on April I, 1967 (an ironic date) when cowboy 
Chris Murphy took office. Armed with the first set of long sideburns 
on campus, a pair of genuine Maryland cowboy boots, and a flashing 
smile, Chris cut a dashing figure. What little Chris did accomplish, 
when he wasn't zipping around the country with Fr. Ted pushing 
SUMMA, he did with style. Chris had the seemingly quaint 
philosophy that politics should be monetarily rewarding, and it 
rubbed off on his administration to the tune of a 'deficit' that will 
be long felt. 
The spring of '68 brought Richard Rossi and "Student Power" to 
the front of Notre Dame politics. Richard, though not the dresser his 
predecessor was, had always been a 'big' man in ND politics. Though 
plagued by his constant 'fired' up sidekick, Richard. '}did instill a 
great deal of activism among the politically inclined of the campus. 
Though possibly his administration did too much demanding and 
not enough asking through proposals and dialogue, Rossi showed 
that the best success that can be enjoyed comes through hard work 
and constant effort. 
Power again changed hands when Phil McKenna won a close and 
hard fought election from his favored opponent John Mroz last year. 
It is hard to say what style Phil has given the office since he 
gained power. However, I did overhear two freshmen talking on their 
way to class the other day and one said, "I heard that Phil McKenna 
was going to ...."but he was cut off by the other's puzzled queary of 
"Who?". Even though we cannot pinpoint Phil's elusive political 
style, his political philosophy is easier to trace. It seems to be one 
that advocated the principle much seen in the US Senate and 
Congress, that politics should be fun -and indeed fun it is. A gleeful 
time has been had by all as they merrily bypass important issues, 
speak out on hilarious things like the Chicago Weathermen, and 
happily romp about their third floor offices. 
Ho~ever, the time has drawn nigh to once again replace the present leader with a new, fresh face. At the start of the year there were two frontrunners for the position. The first was the soft spoken hard working · semi-moderate politician and man of letters from the north quad, and the other was the good looking, equally hard working, though not as well known, contender from the south quad. However, after much soul searching it has become apparent that for different reasons neither desires the position any longer. That leaves us with the question, "Who will our next pace-setter be?" Many names have been thrown around the 'upper echelon' circles these last two weeks and one is led to repeat the question 'who?, The names that have been suggested are like suggesting that Horace Clarke, Jerry Kenney, and Thurman Munson have the potential to build another Yankee dynasty. 
In a way it is sad that there is no dashing leader to keep the image pattern going that has been established the last three years. Maybe we have indeed come to theimQasseT. H. White describeS; in his book

Although the rumors were flying that the only reason that David Frye was contracted to play at Notre Dame last Friday was because he was some distant relative of Student Union Business Manager, Joe Frye, nothing could be 
further from the truth. They are obviously not related, and in truth, Joe could have been better on stage than his namesake, David. Anybody could have. 
lie was a good impressionist, but a poor comedian. His voice and gestures for the most part were fair, hinting even at brillance' at times, but only if you were close enough to see him. It was lucky for those who bought bleacher seats that the more expensive seats in front of them were largely vacant and they could move closer to the worst concert Notre Dame has seen in recent years. 
Frye would have been good at a party' fair in a nightclub, but in a sports arena he could and maybe should have been ignored. In order to compensate for the size of the auditorium and his poor delivery, he shouted when he came to a line that he enjoyed; and in fact many times he was the only one of an estimated 
4,500  concert  attenders  that  liked  his  
lines.

With a half-hearted jump Mark avoided one of the numerous puddles which had been left by the morning's steady rain. The afternoon sun was bright, and it glis­tened off the windows dotting the back of the bookstore. Funny, Mark thought; he had never noticed those windows before. But now he was sure a thousand eyes behind those windows were watching every move he made. He swallowed hard, but resolved to carry through. 
As he held the door open for a nun in a 
blue habit, Mark realized that for the first 
time this year he had approached by way 
of the sidewalk behind Walsh. He usually 
went under the breezeway between the 
bookstore and Gilbert's to look at 
clothes; but the fact that he didn't do so 
convinced him that his singularness of 
purpose had excluded any regular triviali­
ties. 
Entering the foyer, he wondered if the 
nun who had just left ever thought of 
stealing. Of course she had: he remember­
ed that the waitress at the Huddle had 
told him about the nuns taking all the 
sugar and salt on the counters. But that 
wasn't quite the same Mark told himself. 
But what's the difference Mark asked 
himself. A damn nun never had to buy a 
$2.95 book for twenty pages of reading. 
Walking into the main part of the 
building, Mark quickly scanned the 
check-out counters. The middle-aged 
woman with brown hair and glasses was 
at the counter where you pick up film; 
the colored lady who always wore a loose 
green over-shirt was in the middle, and 
the young but not particularly attractive 
girl was at the counter with all the pens. 
lie could feel them staring at him as he 
turned toward the stairway. Why do they 
have to stare'! Now everyone at the 
counter would be staring, including John, 
who would wonder why Mark had passed 
without talking. 
The steps lasted forever. Mark couldn't 
figure out if he was walking slower or if 
he had just never noticed that it was such 
a long walk to the second floor. No 
matter; the turnstile at the top of the 
stairs had just attacked him, as it always 
did, and a laughing sigh at last escaped his 
tense lips. But the matter at hand quickly 
restored his stiff, dead-serious attitude. 
none of the Benny timing. When he 
should have paused, he rushed; and rather 
than playing it low key, counting on good 
material, he loudly forced what material 
he had on the audience with a booming 
voice. He wanted to make sure we didn't 
miss any of his wit, so he shouted it to us 
when he got a chance. 

Perhaps rather than shouting "I am the 
president, I am the president", he could 
have been saying "I am a comedian, I am 
a comedian, please believe me I am a 
comedian, I think," even though he is 
not, maybe it would give him the 
confidence that he needs. And when he 
lost his notes (who ever heard of any 
decent comedian on stage having to 
depend on notes?) he stated "I don't 
need my notes, I need comedy material." 
David, you were so right. And while 
you're out looking for material, try and 
develop a comic delivery to complement 
your impressions. 

And even though a number of yahoos and philistines in the audience, whose favorite occupation obviously is writing graffiti on john walls, enjoyed and even cheered at the earthy humor. There is certainly no place and no excuse for this type of burlesque humor at the school of 
Our Lady. Mr. Frye showed an extreme 
lack of taste, in spite of the fact that he was forced to try a different type of humor, after his earlier flop with clean material. 
But the worst was yet to come. Much of the audience had never eve , heard of

around; Mark realized the big rush at the beginning of the semester was over. Good. 
But on second thought it wasn't good at all. Granted, there would be few people to see him; but he would be much more vulnerable, more in the open ­more likely to be seen by an employee. lle cursed himself for being stupid enough to assume an uncrowded hour would be best. No matter now; he was determined to carry through. 
Attempting to act naturally and at the same time gaze constantly from side to side, Mark made his way to bin 24, History, with a brief stop at the drama bin to make a final survey of the entire area. No one was at the history bin; no one was watching. 
Everyone was watching. Where had they all come from? Mark couldn't under­stand, for when he had disappeared be­tween the bins the place was empty. Now a thousand gazes fell upon him. The bearded professor seemed to stare intent­ly at the latest fiction, but Mark knew that he was watching too. Why don't they all mind their own business? 
Mark stiffened his right arm and ner­vously approached the check-out counter. The book was suddenly big bulky and heavy. How could he avoid detection? How could he have thought seconds ago 
that  his  winter  coat  concealed  it  com­ 
pletely?  
As  he  hurried  between  the  box  of  

posters and the last o er, he noticed 
that both women had stopped punchinJ;  the register and now stared at him intent­ly. As he descended the steps he felt their stares, the stares of the customers; as he hurried out the front door he felt the stares of the world. 
Faceless, colorless, and plain, they attacked him as he stepped outside. Plunging their knives into his body deeper and deeper, faster and faster; the sweat flowed freely from his body. A prolong­ed, forceful thrust to the throat finally broke his resistance. Lying on the pave­ment in a pool of blood, exhausted but 
relaxed, crushed but ecstatic, Mark realized that stealing a book was hardly the sin he had previously thought it to be. With a smile of accomplishment and 
the Grand Funk Railroad, let alone heard 
any of their material; and most don't 
wish to hear it again. 
Judging from the number of people who left during the GFRR performance (presumably to the infirmary to see if anything could be done about broken eardrums) this would have to be considered the worst concert in the last four years at Notre Dame. Never before have Du Lac students flocked from their expensive, middle range, or bleacher cheap seats to escape an act. Last year Phil Borneo Jr. was terrible, everybody that payed stayed. 
The Grand Funk RR had to be the heaviest thing ND has seen since the last time the dining hall served pancakes for breakfast. If heavy means loud, they were heavy; but if heavy has any conotations of being enjoyable, they were light -very light. 
They were good musicians, but the previews that put them in the same league as the Cream were simply lying. About the only way that they resembled the Cream was that they had only 3 members. Beyond that they were only the average rock group.

A bidding system that has gained popu­larity in the past decade is the Big Club, a brainchild of Howard Schenken, one of America's greatest players. The heart of this system is the One Club opening, which is entirely artificial, and denotes a hand of seventeen or more high card points. Any other suit opening in this system denies 17 H.C.P. Responder an­swers to I Club as follows: with less than 9 HCP an artificial I Diamond Bid; with over 9 HCP or more he responds natural­ly. At this point, holding a guaranteed 26 HCP, the partnership is forced to game. The Schenken system is at its best on

music  less,  if  that's  possible.  For  
supposedly  heavy  music,  they  had

repetitive to the point of boredom. 
They never even got around to the best cut on their first album, also their biggest single to date, called Time Machine. This is not quite so overpowering as the songs they attempted on stage and left many wondering if they could even play such a tune. Can they do anything except drive crowds away? 
Their best offering of a bad lot was their opening tune called Are You Ready, and two others In Need and Heartbreaker showed some promise, but their overall effect was somewhere between devastation and boredom. 
Only superlatives can describe this concert. The most horrible, the most wretched, or simply the worst.

Mrs. King, in London on the first stop of a tour promoting her book, "My Life With Martin Luther King," said the Nixon administration was being overly influenced by the South and was bent on following what it thought most Americans wanted 
with regard to Negro civil rights. 

Mrs. King said Americans were willing to move toward complete integration of the races, but Nixon was not willing to give the positive leadership that is "desperately needed." 
As for the Black Panthers, Mrs. King said some members of that militant group had been in jail for six months without trial.

Integration --'de jure' versus 'de facto'? 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Accusing the North of "monu­mental hypocrisy," Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, (D. Conn.), called Monday for both govern­ment and business to work to integrate Northern suburbs. 
"If Sen. John Stennis wants to make honest men of us Northern liberals, I think we should help him," Ribicoff told the Senate. He promised to sup­port the Mississippi Democrat's proposal under which schools segregated because of residential patterns would be considered in violation of civil rights laws the same as those segregated by Jaw or local custom. 
Ribicoff, onetime secretary of llealth, Education and Welfare, (HEW) was the first Northern senator to openly support Sten­nis' proposal, one of at least nine amendments offered by South­erners to a four year, $35 billion school aid authorization hill pending before the Senate. 
Stennis and other Southerners have accused HEW of ignoring Northern segregation while clamping down on Southern school segregation. 
Just before Ribicoff'sspeech, Stennis recited HEW statistics which showed hundreds of all white and all black schools in the North. 
HEW has acknowledged that it distinguishes between the South's "de jure" segregation ­separate white and Negro school systems -and the North's "de facto" segregation which results from distinct white and Negro neighborhood patterns. Stennis' amendment is designed to elimi­nate the distinctions. 
"We must be honest with ourselves," Ribicoff said. "Our problem is not only the dual systems of education...the more fundamental problem is the dual society that society that exists in every metropolitan area -th~ 
black society of the central city and the white society of the suburb. 
"Massive school segregation does not exist because we have segregated our society and our neighborhoods," he said. 
" ... The North is guilty of monumental hypocrisy in its treatment of the black man. Northern communities have been as systematic and consis­tent as Southern communities in denying to the black man and his children the opportunity that exists for white people." 
Ribicoff said 80 per cent of new metropolitan area jobs in the past 20 years are located in suburbs. He said discrimination

1n the War in Vietnam 
SAIGON (UPI) -South Viet­namese troops Jed by U.S. Green Berets clashed with North Viet­namese regulars yesterday in the fourth day of a battle 60 miles west of Saigon. Other U.S. troops found a Communist ar­senal contianing 3,000 rifles and tons of ammunition. Field re­ports said the four day battle on the marshy Plain of Reeds six miles from the Cambodian bor­der had cost the North Viet­namese 117 men killed. Allied losses were placed at 22 killed and 25 wounded with a brunt of the fighting borne by South Vietnamese forces. 
Military sources said a North Vietnamese soldier captured on the Plain said his outfit, the 88th Regiment, was trying to move on the Dinh Tuong capital of My Tho, 34 miles southwest of Sai­gon. It is a major Meking Delta river city and the headquarters for the 7th Division of the South Vietnamese army. 
At least 12,000 North Viet­namese troops are known to be stationed in the delta along with others across the border in Cam­bodia the sources said. Some intelligence reports have indicat­ed that Honoi is planning a major offensive in the delta rice­bowl to test the ability of South Vietnamese troops who haw re­placed American ground forces in the sprawling area.

They particularly objected to midterm desegregation dead­lines, "busing" of pupils to achieve racial balance and the application of exclusive desegre­gation standards to I 2 Southern states. 
The governors, from Louisi­ana, Alabama, Mississippi, Geor­gia and South Carolina, ex­pressed their views in copy­righted interviews with U.S. News & World Report. 
"In my judgment, it has been an absolute, utter disaster. It is a disaster for public education," said Gov. John J. McKeithen of Louisiana. 
"The future of the Mississippi system of public education at this point is in serious jeopar­dy," said Gov. John Bell Wil­liams. 
"Turmotl, tear, contusiOn ... 
in some areas, the public school 
system is going to be almost 
destroyed," said Gov. Lester 
Maddox of Georgia. 
"These court orders, the con­stant shifting about of pupils and teachers to maintain a racial balance, the taking of young children out of their neighbor­hood school areas -these sorts of things are demoralizing ... and there is going to be a serious loss of public support for public education ..." said Gov. Albert Brewer of Alabama. 
"... This order has come at the worst possible time -in the middle of the school year. It is almost impossible to implement it. The effect on our public education system could be seri­ous," said Gov. Robert E. McNair of South Carolina. 
None expressed real hope that relief might be forthcoming from the courts, but none advo­cated violence to resist. 
not enough ... how much more sensible, both in terms of eco­nomic growth and simple humanity, it would be to open up our suburbs to the black and the poor so that they live near their places of employment." 
on a reciprocal basis. "Tills mean," he pointed out, ''that for every student the local chapter wishes to place overseas, we must find a local business willing to take on an exchange trainee from overseas." 
The Notre Dame chapter is 
one of the most active groups in the organiz-;_tion. Recently, Paul Roberts, an N.D. student, was appointed Asian co-ordinator for AISEC-US. In his role, he will coordinate the exchanges be­tween Asia and the United States. Roberts explained the role he plays, "the job has three functions: Public Relations, coordination, and being a good will ambassador, and a represen­tative at the Asian President's 
meeting." 
The officers of the club in­
clude: Joe Loughrey-President, 
Jim Wisner--Secretary, Terry 
Hennen-Director, Paul Roberts­
-Asian Coordinator, and John 
Donaghue-Publicity Director. 
Jim Wisner emphasized several things about the club: "It's run more like a business than a club, the organization provides stu­dents with contacts in business, it is highly organized, set up more like an corporation than an informal club." 
The organization was first started on campus in 1963. After a couple years of activity it sort of died out, only to be revived last year. It experienced phenomenal growth over the last year nad has increased its mem­bership from 15 to 92 members. 
Besides gaining on-the-job ex­perience overseas, the AISEC or­ganization provides other advan­tages to its members. It gives members a chance to meet people involved in business, giv­ing them a chance to discuss problems and develop friend­ships with them. Another im­portant job is in the area of public realtions. A third, is in­volved with the reception of foreign students.

exactly lavishing him with seeking ways to benefit all 600 its undeserved reputation in its infancy ("Some of the biggest thieves in the world are on a golf course," he complained). He snorts also at the notion of pool hall violence. "Pool is not physical in any way. If you can lift 20 ounces, you can play it." He dozes off between turns at the table, sometimes to the considerable annoyance of his opponents (which may be what he intends all along), but Wimpy says sleep is good for you at any ~ime. He looks like a traveling parson, which must have sttod him in good stead (and given the clergy a bad name) in the days when he would hop off a train or drop over th Norfolk to chalk a cue and get himself a little hamburger money. He travels light-just a tux and a pool cue. He never married, never worked for a salary (except when there was a war on) since the days when he used to see his father ruining his health as foreman of a rolling mill near his home in Elizabeth City, N.C. A halo is not part of Luther's wardrobe either.· He admits to hustling in his day ("Everybody hustles," he observes). He's been in love a few times, but mainly with money but he has seen real tragedy. That would be the time the guy with the faulty stroke and $116,000 showed up in Norfolk and all Wimpy could get of it was $9,1 00 before he got called home to take care of his parents. By the time he got back, someone else had got the $106,900. Wimpy has been looking for the guy ever since. He carries his own "Do Not Disturb" sign with him (in case the hotel runs out), shuts off the phone, feels about publicity the way a bank robber would feel about having his picture in the post office, and thinks that life in general is an 8-ball. "I'm glad to be here, and I'll be glad to leave," he says. At 51, he figures the Lord may run the table on him at any moment, particularly since he feels so lousy. He sat in the Elks Club downtown the other day where he's playing in the $19,500 world's pocket billiards championship and surveyed the scene with visible dissatisfaction. For one thing, the billiard cloths will be too new (they will get wet and then dry and lift off the table and the balls will fly high); the pockets are too big ( a good player, like a good golfer, likes the course tough so some rinkydink won't get lucky and win); the guy racking for the break will likely have greasy hands ("Greasy balls don't stroke true"); but, 
worst of all, the guys won't be playing for their own money ("It tenses a man up if he has to reach in his own pocket if he loses-this way I couldn't care if they put up $72 billion. If it don't come out of your own pocket, it's like writing home for money. I'd like to play these guys for THEIR money"). 
Luther looked around the room as though it were a scarlet fever ward. "Do you know," he asked gloomily, "this is the only game in the world you could lose without ever gettin off a shot?" 
Photographer Joe Raymond captured Saturday's highest emotional moment. Austin Carr ,lays in a field goal at the buzzer of the first overtime period, grabbing a tie and the chance to win in double overtime.
