Postal strike fades 
W ASBINGTON -Big -city union leaders backed down from earlier threats to stage an illegal mail strike this week as a labor mediator moved yesterday to settle the deadlocked postal contract dispute on his own. Sources said the chances of a strike appear to be fading because union members are reluctant to jeopardize their carters and risk going to jail.

Speedway bombings end 
INDIANAPOLIS -Still wary after a week's pause in a series of mysterious bombings, the Speedway area oflndianapolis is slowly relaxing again." School attendance has returned to normal, and evening athletic activities have resumed. Police, however, are still working ten-hour shifts, checking any reports of suspicious packages. The sudden halt in bombings after eight explosions in six days is just as baffling as the attacks were to begin with.

p.m. this Saturday in Stepan Center. 
The evening is planned to pro­vide an opportunity for girls to meet people outside their dorms in 
an atmosphere free from interhall or classroom rivalries.

Erratum 
The Off-Campus Commission is not under the jurisdiction of Student Union as was reported in yesterday's Observer. It is under the direction of Student Govern­ment.

ND security 'steals' bikes to protect student owners 
by Sue Wuetcher Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame Security has been confiscating unlocked bicycles to prevent them from being stolen. 
"We steal them before someone else does," Arthur N. Pears, director of Security, stated, adding, "All reported stolen bicycles are checked against those we have on hand. The owners are notified immediately." He said that if students would lock their bicycles then Security would have no reason to take them. 
Pears commented that the bi­cycles located in the basement of Holy Cross Hall are those that were unclaimed at the end of the school year. "I would think that if a student's bicycle was stolen he would think enough to report it," Pears said. 
He noted that having bicycles registered with Security makes it much easier to recover them in the ~vent that they are stolen or claimed by Security. Pears said that he could see no reason for 
students failing to do this. "The 
office remains open until 8 p.m. to 
accomodate students," he said, 
addind, "Registration costs only 
one dollar and is good for four 
years." 
Pears stated that Security is trying to alert students to take precautions with their property. All on-campus bicycles are tagged two or three times .a year as a reminder for the owners to register them. 
Ads are run in The Observer encouraging students to register and mark their property. There are also programs in every hall designed to inform students on how to protect their property.

Astronaut speaks on space 
[Continued from page 1] proper exercise, diet, and the "knowledge that he will return to earth,'' Lind noted. Seven telescopes were used to study solar physics in the Skylab program. Information from these observational telescopesrevolution­ized the knowledge of solar corona and solar flares, Lind said. He added that over 218,000 miles of film was used to photograph the -sun for every two weeks that the Skylab was in operation. Some of the earth resource experiments carried out on the Skylab missions were designed by high school students. These studies investigated the effect of weightlessness on animals and tested the usefulness of searching for fuel desposits on earth from the vantage point of space, Lind explained. He showed slides of the newly developed Space Shuttle which

already has been taken for low­speed test flights and landing patterns. The reusable shuttle handles like a fighter plane, takes off like a rocket from an upright position and lands on a regular commercial runway, Lind said. It will be used to deploy satellites as well as carry cargo. 
Lind's concluding slides depicted the projected Spacelab, a scientific lab which will operate in outer space for long time periods. The generation of solar energy is under consideration as a Spacelab project. According to Lind, the plan is technologically feasible, but its implementation depends on whether Congress will allocate the funds to carry it out. 
A question and answer session followed Lind's presentation.

Over-crowded conditions at recent graduation ceremonies have caused Notre Dame to announce reserved seating for next May's commencement. 
The policies on admission to graduation exercises scheduled for May 20, 1979, were outlined to representatives of the senior class and of postbaccalaureate degree groups yesterday by several admin­istration officials, headed by Sr. 
John  Miriam  Jones,  assistant  
provost.  
Jones  said that  the  University  

made the decision reluctantly to adopt the seating procedures used in 1977 when President Jimmy Carter addressed graduates. "We are faced with an overtaxing of the ACC Arena and its 10,350 seats." Jones said. 
She pointed out that some/2,000 persons attending last May's commencement did not have seats and were forced to sit in aisles and stand in exit ways. She also noted that the past policy of unreserved seating has come to result in many persons arriving up to three hours in advance of the two-hour cere­mony to insure seats. 
According to Jones, "These conditions have become irritants to those who have sacrificed so much toward this important day and should have the right to enjoy it in comfort." 
The unpredictable nature of Indiana spring weather does not make a return to outdoor cermonies sensible, Jones explained, noting that it has rained on the day of the last two Saint Mary's outdoor commencements. 
Jones said that the University would adopt the ticket allotment 
procedure tJsed in the Carter commencement. All seats will be reserved, and candidates for bac­calaureate degrees will be entitled to five tickets in the initial distribu­tion. Candidates for post­baccaluareate degrees will be eligible for four tickets. 
In each case, two lower arena seats together will be issued, with t! remainder together in the 
i.i • .,,.. arena. If all seats are 
·'-'".ted together, they will be assigned in the upper arena as long

as seats are available there. All locations will be selected randomly. 
If every degree candidate requests the maximum number of tickets to which he is entitled, about 500 seats, most of them lower arena, will be available for a lottery distribution to students needing an extra ticket. Students are encouraged to ask for the maximum number of tickets only if they need them, allowing unclaim­ed tickets to be added to a lottery. 
Postbaccalaureate graduates needing more than four tickets will be given a priority in the lottery because they are eligible for fewer tickets in the initial distribution. 
The initial ticket distribution and lottery will be handled by the Registrar's Office during advance registration in November. It is hoped that lottery results will be available in January so that all students will know in advance exactly how many tickets they have for commencement. 
Jones said that letters will be mailed soon to all candidates for baccalaureate and postbaccalaur­eate degrees, as well as the parents of the former, explaining the necessity of the policy for "the safety and convenience of parents and guests." 
Invited to today's briefing were Andy McKenna, student body president; Mike Roohan, vice president; senior class officers Jerry Castellini, president; Julie Rittenhouse, vice president; Barb Langhenry, secretary; Gary Fair, treasurer; Joe LeVert, graduate student; Peggy Foran, law student, and Bob Riley, M.B.A. student. 
The administrators also asked the students for advice concerning student decorum at graduation. The University officials indicated behavior at last year's commence­ment was inappropriate to an academic exercise. 

Movies planned to be shown this semester in the Engineering Aud­itorium include "Julia" ,and "Shampoo" this month and "The

Juniper Press operating normally after summer 
by Pat Mangan 
Juniper Press, the publishing company founded, owned, and managed by the students of Prof. Elizabeth Christman's book 
publishing class is back in opera­tion and is reviewing ten manuscrjPts of varied authorship 
forA~~~~:i~t!onto 
Karen Caruso, company president, the search was not limited to any specific type of book or author. She said that every manuscript that they found would be considered. However 
Christman said that a book of more than 100 pages would not be feasible. 
Since the company was founded by students, it is also funded by students. At the beginning of the semester each student in the class invests at least $35 in the company. This amount, plus whatever is left by the previous class, is the bulk of the company budget. So far, the Juniper Press budget has never exceeded $1000. 
Each year the company pub­lishes one book. In its first year under the leadership of President

Aragon set for sophomore season 
by Bryan Can:1 Sporta Writer 

The 1977 sports year was a very 
successful on e at Notre Dame, 
with National Championships in 
both football and fencing. Few, 
however, would recall the fact that 
Notre Dame also gained significant 
national reco~nition when its track 
team set the NCAA school record in 
the two mile relay. 
Unless of course, you're Chuck 
Aragon, a key member of that 
record breaking foursome. 
Aragon ran cross country and 
track during his high school years 
in Los Lunas, New Mexico, and was 
recruited by over fifty colleges to 
compete on the collegiate level in' 
these sports. 
"I finally chose to go to Notre 
Dame because it offered me a high 
quality education," recalls the 
sophomore from Morrissey, "and 
when visiting the campus, every­
one was so friendly . •' 
Aragon's normal weekday starts 
a bit earlier than the typical 
students. He's up at 6:30 to run a 
brisk five miles before his eight 
o'clock class. He finishes his days 
training in the late afternoon with 
ten to fifteen more miles (eight to 
ten, at a faster pace, during track 
and field.) 
"I only have so much energy to spend in a day," said Aragon, "and I try to find a happy medium between my academics and athletics." 
Aragon's balancing of energies proved most successful his fresh-· man year. Not only was he a member of the record-setting relay team, but he also ran well enough in his specialty, the half mile (800 meters), to qualify for the U.S. Junior Team Trials in Bloomington, Indiana. 
From there, things were as 

smooth as Aragon's stride. He 
placed second in the trials and was 
off to spend a portion of his 
summer running in West Germany 
and Russia. 
"In Russia," he recalls, "people 

would barter with us for colorful 
T-shirts and blue jeans. I got sixty 
dollars for a pair of Levis! " 
Aragon's success in Russia was 

not limited to his marketplace 
dealing. There, Aragon ran his 
best time ever, an 1:49.4, and 
plaved first in the event, displaying 
"world class" capability. 
This will be Aragon's second 

year of running at Notre Dame. 
His outlook? 
"We had a good recruiting year and have a lot of lettermen return-' ing from last year's squad," point­ed out Aragon, "so it looks like a good year is in store for Notre Dame tracksters. 
"Personally, I would like to improve my time and bring it into the low 1:48's," Aragon said. 
Aragon doesn't dwell much on the future. "Right now I'm a biology major," said Aragon, "but have yet to make any future ,career plans. I just do the best that I can during the present." 
One thing, however,. has been the subject of Aragon's thoughts-­that is, the upcoming Olympics. 
"Sure the Olympics have crossed my mind," remarked Aragon , "the 1980 Olympic Trials is some­thing to aim for and with some hard work, maybe the 1984 games could be a possibility." 
If past performance is indicative of things to come, it seems that the sophomore from Los Lunas might be visiting Russia again sooner than he thinks.

You had to feel sorry for Dan Devine. The Notre Dame head coach was damned if he did, and he was dammed if he didn't. On 4th down and the football resting within the shadow of the Missouri goal line. Devine was faced with a hard decision. Should he send in JOe Unis, inexperienced under fire, to attempt a field goal that would break a scoreless tie? Or does he try to ram tlle ball-in for six behind Notre Dame's mammoth offensive line? . ,; 
If Devine opts for Unis, he is gutless and lacks confidence in offense. supposedly the strength of his team. But if he goes for the touchdown, he is foolish for passing up a near-certain three points in a scoreless game. 
It's true, Devine was damned if he did, and he was damned if he didn't. But most of all he was dammed because his players_._4idn't. 
Didn't block, didn't pas~n't c~dch and didn't run.......·· , 
Devine was damnpd because in the first halfJoe Montana1ooked more like a prep team quartelback than a Reisman Trophy candidate. And he was damned becaus~n the few occasions in the firit half that Montana did get the ball to an open receiver, it seemed that the Irish offense was competing with the Irish defen~ for the lead in passes broken up. 
But most of all, Devine was damned because his offensive line was stuck in neutral all afternoon. When the chips were down, so was Notre Dame's offensive line. Whether or not Devine was foolish to go for the touchdown on fourth-and-goal from inside the one is immaterial. What is important is that when the Irish needed a yard, they couldn't get it. Not once, but three times, Notre Dame failed on fourth-and-short. 
There may have been instances of poor play-selection on the part of Devine and his aides Saturday afternoon; and questionable use of timeouts in the second half that left the Irish with only one in the final minutes didn't help either. But the point is that the Irish never should have been in the position where a single play could have made difference in the outcome of the ballgame. 
I won't insult anyone's intelligence by restating the obvious, other than to say the Irish lost a game they should have won. Nobody needs to be told how damaging the loss was-·the wire service polls are already out. 
But at the same time, nobody needs to be reminded that the season.is far from over. Thanks to Alabama's sour-grapes fans, nobody has forgotten last season's Mississippi game. And few people have forgotten the aftermath of that 20-13 loss to tl}e Rebels--including the "Dump Devine" mi>vement, complete with bumper stickers now covered by National Championship stickers. 
Let's not be too anxious to peel off those top decals. 

Notre Dame's Chuck Aragon displayed his running prowess In Russia this summer. 

Kickers blank ·Tri-State, 3-0 
by Mark Perry and BID Murphy Sports Writers 
The Notre Dame soccer team 

won their second straight game of 
fhe season last night, as they 
defeated Tri-State University, 3-0. 
The win extended the Irish winning 
streak to eighteen games over the 
past two seasons, which no.w ranks 
as the top winning streak in the 
nation. 
"We were very pleased with tonight's game, " said coach Rich Hunter. "We have a new defense which has been developed by assistant coach Todd Cooper. and it has been very successful so far." 
The defense was very effective last night. as the Irish controlled play throughout the game. taking 25 shots on goal to only three for Tri-State. 
Tri-State used a kick-and-run offense for the entire game, boot­ing the ball high into the Irish enJ and then trying to run under the ball in front of the Irish defenders. But strong defensive play by fullbacks Jim Rice, Tom Luetkenhans, Randy Wittry, and Jim Sabitus denied Tri-State the scoring opportunities they wanted. 
Sabitus was injured on a rush by Tri-State in the first half, but Hunter expects him back by next Monday at the latest. 
Neither team could score in the first 25 minutes, although the Irish had several scoring opportunities. Roman Klos had two excellent shots, one. which bounced off the crossbar and another blocked by the Tri-State goalie from point­blank range. Terry Finne_gan also looped a shot over the goalie's head. but this was also pulled down. 
Finnegan finally broke the tie with 18 minutes, 12 seconds left in the first half. After an illegal push in the goal area, Finnegan blasted a low line drive into the left side of the net on the penalty kick. 
The Irish increased their lead 32 seconds later, as Bill Wetterer drove down the right side and crossed the ball in front of the net, where Kevin Lovejoy headed the ball in for the 2-0 lead. 
The Irish continued to dominate play for the remainder of the first half, with a lot of good passes in front of the Tri-State net. but could not manage another score. 
Tri-State finally developed some offensive pressure in the second half, as a few high kicks got past the Irish defense, but goalie Bob Ritger kept Tri-State off the score­board. 
Then. with one minute, 30 seconds left in the game, a hand­ball by the Tri-State goalie outside the goal area gave the Irish direct kick. Finnegan lined up for the kick, but swung over the ball. Bill Ralph followed right behind him to drive the ball past the suprised Tri-State defense into the lower left hand corner of the net for the final Notre Dame score. 
In last Friday's home opener, the Irish defeated St. Louis Community College 3-0. Wetterer opened the scoring for Notre Dame in the first half, assisted by Lovejoy, and Sabitus and Lovejoy scored in the second half. the final goal _coming with only five seconds left in the game. 
***************** 
Next on the schedule for the Irish will be two more home games, as they face Indiana-Purdue Univer­sity this Friday, and then take on St. Joseph's College next Monday. Both games will be at Cartier Field beginning at 8 p.m.
