Rafferty's scheduled to shut down; operators unable to repay debts

News Staff 
Rafferty's in the East Bank Center at 401 E.Colfax will make its last call for alcohol on Saturday, April 14. 
According to Bob Holloway, a bar­tender at Rafferty's since last Oc­tober. the nightclub is closing because the property owners will not renew the lease. "Another fac­tor," Holloway said, "may have been that the operators have not been able to repay the debts they assumed from the previous owners." 
Ironically, Holloway says that "the bar is making very good profits and would be successful ifit were not for the large debts it had from the begin­ning." He added, "The managers have done a great job running Raf­ferty's. They just have problems with the property owners and the creditors of the original owners." 
The shareholders of Rafferty's on 
the Race, Inc. and managers of the 
restaurant and bar are Larry Wech­
ter, Steve Wechter, and Bruce 
Bartone.

managers and employees, Holloway said,"the main reason for closing down was that the property owners would not renew the lease." The other reason given, says Holloway, was that the facility has a restaurant and liquor license but is required 
that 75 percent of its gross revenue comes from food alone. Holloway estimates a very large percentage of the gross revenue is from liquor sales, "thus invalidating the res­taurant license." Bankruptcy was not one of the reasons given the employees. 
Holloway added that, according to manager Bartone, the space will be made into a restaurant after April 14 and the new owners will keep the name "Rafferty's".

Murray, Roemer pick Senior Bar managers 
By SARAH HAMILTON 
News Editor 
M.J. Murray, director of the Senior-Alumni Club, was looking for "good quality people" in the three student managers she hired for the 
1984-85 school year. After in­terviewing approximately 40 ap­plicants, Murray and Dean of Students James Roemer selected John Bowie, general manager; Kath­leen Conley, club/promotion manager; and Charlie Moore, food/supply manager. 
Bowie is a junior marketing major from Boston. Mass. As general manager, Bowie will be responsible for most of the scheduling of employees, and the ordering of liq­uor and soft drinks. He will work closely with Murray and the other managers and will rotate with the other two student managers as 
nightly managers ofthe club. 
Conley, a Saint Mary's junior from St. Louis, Mo., is majoring in English Literature and Writing. Her respon­sibilities will include booking Senior Bar for club nights, coordinating all music in the club, and publicity.

Fanfare marks op_ening of Mock Convention 
By MARY HEILMANN 
News Staff 
Amid fanfare and political 

'rhetoric, the 1984 Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Mock Political Convention opened last night at Stepan Center. 
Speeches by Congressional Aide Gary Caruso, former Ohio Represenatative Ron Mettl, Notre Dame law professor John Gilligan, and William Mondale, son of Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale, highlighted the event. 

Convention Chairman Tom O'Leary emphazised in his opening ·address that one of the convention's goals is to "have fun," and in­troduced Caruso, the opening speaker, as a man who keeps that goal in mind. 
Caruso, a Notre Dame graduate, called the half-empty delegations to overcome the apathy which he believes is characteristic of the United States political scene. He said the U.S. "consistently has the lowest voter turnout ofany country except one-Botswana." 
"We are special for having at­tended Notre Dame," he said. "We are not poor, we are not uneducated 
-we are almost forced into a posi­tion of influencing the world. You demand Cap'n Crunch or Lucky Charms cereal on your breakfast table; why not take a stand on issues ofworldwide importance?" 
Caruso, who received a standing ovation, closed with, "This conven­tion goes beyond who we are and what we vote. It challenges each of us." 
William Mondale, campaigning for his father, followed Caruso and emphasized "the depth of ex­perience and compassion" of the Mondale campaign. 
"We need a Democrat who is going to go into that office and fight for peace," he said. "Walter Mondale brings compassion to that office. He believes in the ideals which bring us together as a community, a family, and a country." 
Mondale then fielded questions from several delegates concerning the Middle East, national defense, and his father's stance on abortion, described as a "crucial issue" to the Notre Dame community. 
After Mondale, keynote speaker Ron Mottl, also a Notre Dame alumnus, spoke. His briefcomments 
!~
were merely an endorsement of John Glenn and he asked the delegates "not to overlook plain old middle-of-the-road competency" in their vice presidential nomination. 
Notre Dame law Professor John 
Gilligan closed the evening with, 
"the development of a just 
society ...should still be the goal of 
the Democratic party, as it has been 
through our long and honorable his­
tory. If economic and social justice

Mondale emphasizes his father's compassion, search for future 
By TIMOTHY GIANOTTI 
News Staff 
Walter Mondale's presidential campaign champions "compassion, caring, the search for future and the search for fairness," said the Democratic hopeful's son William before last night's Mock Conven­tion. 
Drawing on his father's 30-year political career as an attorney general, senator and vice president, Mondale pointed out his candidate's experience and dedication, boasting "a strong foundation for the future." 
"I feel that I have got a strong can­didate to work with," Mondale said. "He puts his money where his mouth is." 
Tuesday's victory in the "very im­portant state of New York" was a shot in the arm for the campaign and put Mondale in a "very good posi­tion" for a showdown with Colorado senator Gary Hart, said the 21-year­old spokesman. 
Mondale did mention, however, that the race remained "very close" and that the competition would be no pushover. 
"In the beginning," he said, "we 
thought this primary would be a 
100-yard dash for Walter Mondale." 
They soon discovered some tough 
opponents, he said, namely Gary 
Hart. 
Young Mondale said Hart's begin­
nings were very good and his "pitch 
for new ideas" was fresh and appeal­
ing upon first impression, but he is 
confident that it will not hold up, saying that it has already begun to "peter out." 
He made several references throughout the evening to Hart's in­consistency, focusing on six dif­ferent statements concerning the arms race released by the Hart cam­paign thus far. 
His father's "strong and consis­
tent" record is the  most  effective  
counter  to  Hart's  shaky  stance,  
Mondale said.  
Concerning  the  nuclear  arms  

issue, young Mondale says his father 
realizes that "bullying" is not as powerful or as effective as arbitra­tion and cooperation. 
"We need a president who will go into that office and fight for peace," Mondale said. 
Concerning .the abortion issue, Mondale insisted, "My father does not favor abortion," although the campaign remains pro choice. "It is not the government's place," he said, to dictate to the people how to act on this issue. 

Hart leader in random poll just ahead of undecideds 

By KRISTINE WIDERQUIST 
News Staff 

Gary Hart was the leading nomination candidate in a poll taken of 
delegates at the Mock Convention last night. Undecided delegates 
ran a close second. 

Ofa random survey of 234 student delegates Hart pulled 67 votes 
for 28.6 percent of the total. Undecided delegates made up 26. 1 
percent with 61 votes. 

Reubin Askew, no longer a candidate, came in third with 47 votes, 
or 20.1 percent. Walter Mondale, one of the leading national 
Democratic candidates, struggled to the fourth position with 24 
votes, 10.3 percent of the electorate. 
Jesse Jackson, the only other Democrat still in the race, received 
12 votes ( 5.1 percent). John Glenn. Ernest Hollings, George 
McGovern and Edward Kennedy garnered 3.4. 2.9, 2.6 and 0.9 per­
cent respectively. 

The delegates will have an opportunity to vote for their choices 
when the Mock Convention chooses its Democratic presidential 
candidate at tomorrow night's session.

a reminder for tomorrow 
That donut you threw away at breakfast may come back to haunt you. 
Courtesy of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's World Hunger Coalition, the food wasted at yesterday's lunch and dinner and today's breakfast is making a second ap­pearance at the dining halls today. 
If you arc eating at North Dining Hall, you probably noticed the clear plastic bins filled with wasted food outside the building. Another bin will be placed outside South Dining Hall tonight during dinner hours. Similar displays arc planned at Saint Mary's. 
These bins arc another attempt by the coalition to make us aware ofhow much food is wasted. 
Last semester, coalition members counted how much food was wasted and posted the results. A month later, another count was taken and no substantial dif­ference was found. 
Since just telling us how much food is wasted did not substantially decrease food waste, the coalition decided to literally show us how much is wasted. "We'd like to make people more aware of how much food is wasted,"said Kevin Moser, a coalition member involved in the project. "The food count was just statistics to a lot ofpeople." The bins should certainly make people aware that food is being wasted, but will they cause people to change their eating habits? ''I'd like to be optimistic," said Moser. "I think it's worth a try. The food count didn't seem to work." It seems unlikely that this latest attempt to decrease waste will help either. Some were annoyed by the food count, claiming that what they eat or don't eat is their own concern. It is probable that even more people will be annoyed by the bins. Not only does this project ask people to change their eating patterns, but the sight of a day's worth of organic garbage is offensive to some. In fact, the bins may actual­ly alienate some people from the coalition. But the coalition stresses their message is not to be found in the bins themselves, but in the sheets dis­tributed at the meals where the bins are displayed. "We're definitely expecting to get some flak from this," said Moser. "Some people think wasting food is a personal matter. I don't think it is." Regardless of viewpoint, some people do consider what and how they eat a personal matter. Although most would agree that waste is a problem, a certain amount is inavoidable. Although the coalition's goal of cutting down on food waste is admirable, is displaying

Inside Thursd 
wasted food ouside the dining halls the best way to achieve this goal? 
Perhaps not. But even ifone is offended by the bins, it is important not to let one's initial reaction of "This is gross!" interfere with the coalition's message. 
Few students see any relation between how much food they waste in the dining hall and the problem of world hunger. After all, what docs the donut on my plate have to do with starving children in India? 
"Directly, it does not," says a sheet distributed by the coalition. "However to ef­fectively address the problem of world hunger, the change needs to begin with the individual. We have the privilege ofbeing able to waste food. Let's not abuse that privilege out of con­venience. Can we afford to waste food in a world where people are starving?" 
"I think that sometimes if 
is graphically demonstrated it is more ef­fective in raising people's concerns," said Bill Hickey, director of Notre Dame's food services, who gave per­mission for the demonstra­tion. Hickey said he realizes the display may be offensive to some people, but told the coalition that ifthey thought it would help reduce food waste, he would support it. Coalition members themselves realize some may be offended by the bins, but they are willing to take that criticism. "We don't want to offend anyone," said Moser. "We want people to realize how much food is being wasted .. .If it doesn't help, then it doesn't. We feel it's worth a try." So if you are offended by the reappearance of this morning's donut, you can turn your head as you leave the dining hall. The coalition only hopes that tomorrow morning you'll think twice before grabbing that extra donut.

WASHINGTON D.C. -The Senate turned aside a move yesterday to restrict presidential power to send combat troops to El Salvador after a debate in which Democrats charged that President Reagan is likely to send fighting men into Central America within the next year. 
By a vote of59-36, the lawmakers rejected a proposal by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to bar the president from sending U.S. armed forces into El Salvador or Salvadoran airspace for combat unless Congress has declared specific authorization. 
Leahy said he made his move, as an amendment to an appropriations bill containing S61. 7 million in emergency military aid for the Sal­

Two killed, 19 injured as buildings collapse 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Two adjacent buildings undergoing renovation collapsed yesterday on Manhattan's Lower East Side, killing two people, injuring 19 others and reducing it to "a big pile ofdirt," witnesses said. 
The dead men apparently were two members of a construction crew pouring concrete inside the vacant brick buildings wht:n they collapsed at 2:35 p.m., New York Fire Department officials said. 
Last week, the Buildings Commis­sion had ordered a safety inspection ofthe buildings. 
"Everything just came down ... It's a big pile of dirt," said Michael Cruz, an employee ofa nearby store. 
There were only I 0 workers believed to be inside the buildings when they collapsed, said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward. 
"The dead men and three injured workers were pulled from the rubble," said Fire Lt. Frank Martinez. 
Of the 19 workers and bystanders who were ,injured, none were seriously hurt, said Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the city's Emergency Medical Service. 
Service on three subway lines was halted in the area for two hours, and police closed the Williamsburg Bridge. which conects Manhattan and Brooklyn over the East River. 

The collapse caused a 20-inch water main under the buildings to snap, sending cascades ofwater into the street and nearby sewers, said Andrew McCarthy of the city En­vironmental Protection Depart­ment. "It's chaotic," he said. "It's just a mess." 
Fire Lt. James Curran said the workers apparently were .pouring concrete, and that "apparently brought the two buildings down."

No charges to the students' accounts will be permitted. However, this does not apply to the regular student bundle service. Any amount over the bundle allotment will be billed on the next semester's in­voice. Seniors are reminded that their accounts must be billed prior to graduation, including overuse of bundle service. We will have balances owed, as a result of exceeding the laundry allotment, for seniors only, on May 10, '84. Any bundle input by a senior after that date may result in a negative balance which will require us to collect 
cash upon receipt of the bundle by the senior.

Researcher discovers new drug 
Associated Press 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.-A new anti-cancer drug stimulates the body's natural cancer-fighter, inter­feron, by safely mimicking a viral in­fection, a researcher said yesterday. 
Laboratory studies suggest that the artificially induced interferon will be more effective against can­cer than existing synthetic inter­ferons, which in early trials have produced mixed results against various forms of cancer, the researcher said. 
The first human trials in the United States to determine the safety of the drug have begun, said Dr. Paul Ts'o of theJohns Hopkins University School MHygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. Trials of the drug's ef­fectiveness at treating cancer in humans wm follow. 
The drug is one of a new class of so-called biological response modifiers, which attempt to provoke the body's defenses -in this case, interferon -to fight can­cer. Existing drugs are merely toxic agents intended to kill cancer cells. 
In studies with tumor cells taken from 50 patients, at least half of the tumor samples responded to the new drug, called Ampligen. 
The samples that responded were reduced in size by at least 50 per­cent, Ts'o said. He did not present data suggesting that the drug could completely eliminate tumor cells. 
The drug has been shown in human trial in other countries to be possibly effective in kidney and colon cancer. Liver cancer and stomach cancer are other likely tar­gets, said Ts'o, speaking at the annual American Cancer Society Science Writer's Seminar. 
He said it will likely take up to two years to test the drug against those cancers. 
He said a big obstacle to wide use of the drug is that it is toxic, causing fever and provoking an attack by the body's immune system. 
Trials have shown, however, that low doses can be effective without being excessively toxic, Ts'o said. 
The patent rights to Ampligen are owned by Johns Hopkins and have been licensed to HEN Inc. in Bet­hesda, Md., said Ts'o.

Governor Lamm proposes economic cure 
Gary Hart is not the only politician from Colorado with new ideas. Last week, Gover­nor Richard Lamm suggested an approach to 
Joseph Murphy 
Wishful thinking 

reviving the American economy. 
Lamm said that medicine which allows some terminally ill people to live longer is destroying the nation's economy. "We've got a duty to die and get out of the way .... I'd take the money we could save in reforming the health-care system and put it into restart­ing America's industrial engine and in the education system," Lamm told a group of health lawyers. 
Lamm compared dying to "leaves falling off a tree and forming humus for the other plants to grow up." One easily could argue that Lamm is full of humus. 
What Governor Lamm does not realize is 
that human beings do not exist for the benefit 
of the economy. Instead, the economy exists 
for the people's benefit. 
Using the governor's logic, society can easi­ly eliminate such problems as poverty by tel­ling poor people they have a duty to kill themselves. Once society starts putting a material value on human life, as Lamm does, where does society draw the line? When does an individual's duty to die begin? 
A society which reduces human life to its value for the majority of human lives has en­tered the danger zone. Lamm has, for ex­ample, questioned spending thousands of dollars to educate mentally retarded children 
"when after four or five years all they do is roll 
over." 

Not content on attacking the dying, suppor­ters ofLamm's quality oflife position advocate giving the right to life only to those who are physically fit and able to help society. 
The case of Infant Doe represents an in­famous victory for those who hold the quality of life theory. This infant was born with Downe's syndrome. Infant Doe died shortly after he had obtained his right to life. Doctors, with his parents' consent, refused to perform needed, but not excessively dangerous, sur­gery which would have corrected his deformed esophagous. Infant Doe starved to death because those in control of his life deemed him unworthy oflife. 
Had Infant Doe not been mentally retarded, no doctor would have advised against the sur­gery since the choice not to act would have 
meant certain death. Thus, Infant Doe was 
refused surgery only because ofhis handicap. 
The alternative to the quality oflife position 
is a return to the traditional view which places 
life, no matter how great a. burden on society, 
as a priceless commodity. No one has a duty to 
die unless one first has a right to life. 
Pope John Paul II said in Washington D.C., "When a child is described as a burden or looked upon only as a means to satisfy an emo­tional need, we will stand up and insist that every child is unique and unrepeatable gift of God. When the sick, the aged, or the dying are . abandoned in loneliness, we will stand up and proclaim that they are worthy of love, care · and respect." 
Joseph Murphy is a freshman in Arts & Let­ters atNotre Dame and is the Assistant View­pointEditor at The Observer. 

P. 0. BoxQ  
Stop the pain DearEditor: The idea of being tortured is so horrible that most of us cannot even comtemplate it. Torture seems unthinkable, but in the 80s, 98 countries, more than one-third of the world's governments, are responsible for brutalizing prisoners. For many torture victims, their only "crime" was non-violent practicing of their religion and speaking their beliefs. These facts are substantiated in the recently released report, Torture in the Eighties. Amnesty International is beginning a two year Campaign for the Abolition of Torture. To stop torture, public opinion must be turned against countries that torture and countries that support torture. Although the United States is not mentioned in the report, our government is in the unique position of being able to put pressure on governments that do torture in order to stop these atrocities. In May, Congress will be meeting to discl!SS the issue of torture. With widespread public support, they will hopefully act to prevrnt torture throughout the world. OR April 26, Amnesty International will sponsor a fJ.lm and a speaker which will both deal with torture. Throughout the next two years, Amnesty International will sponsor other events and undertake a massive letter­writing campaign to help abolish torture. All torture cannot be stopped in two years. However, just as slavery was abolished, torture must be abolished. By working togeth­er, eventually we can bring about an end to torture. Robert V. Breunig Freshman Picher vindictive Dear Editor: There is no excuse for the way in which Keith Picher's March article contrasted Notre Dame Magazine with Scholastic. Rather than a professional critique, he wrote a piece clear­ly vindictive against the Scholastic, using per­sonal attacks that can only be called "cheap shots." First, if Kathy Curran laments a problem ailing this generation, viz., loss of reverence, be it for God, country, family or whatever, she should not be sarcastically ridiculed. Period. Paragraph. Second, a man can be well read and even intelligent in matters theological even if he is an anthropologist.

NCAA vetos 45-second shot clock 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -The National Col­
legiate Athletic Association's Rules 
Committee, in a surprise vote. 
decided yesterday to put off for at 
least another season using a 4S­
second shot clock in college basket­
ball. 
The committee will next consider 
the shot clock issue at a meeting af­
ter next year's Final Four Tourna­
ment in Lexington, Ky. Ed Steitz, the 
committee's secretary-rules editor, 
predicted its adoption then. 
Steitz said the committee decided 
not to go with the shot clock be­
cause of uncertainty over whether 
to use it for the whole game. 
In order for the rules committee 
to adopt a uniform, nationwide shot 
clock, it would have required a two­
thirds vote of the 13-member com­
mittee. 
Steitz said the committee was 
leaning toward a shot clock to ta!l:e

cause the slowdown game was not 
exciting to watch on television, and

middle, Detroit is very strong in the field with Lance Parrish at catcher, Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker at short and second, respective­ly, and Chet Lemon in center. SteadyJack Mor­ris, along with Dan Petry, lead a pitching staff that is, to some degree, still looking for solid third and fourth men. Look for the team from the Motor City to fall just a little short for a second straight year. 
Milwaukee (87-75) -First-year skipper Rene Lachemann has to be happy with the team he encountered upon his arrival in the Brewer camp after the atrocities he found in Seattle with the unceasingly bad Mariners. Lachemann finds a team of hitters with the ability to really pound some people. But, by the same token, his pitching staff may get roughed up nearly as much. Cecil Cooper,Jim Gantner, Robin Yount, and Paul Molitor make up probably the best infield in the game anH the outfield isn't too bad with Rick Manning out in center field. Pete Ladd will carry a bul­lpen which may be getting the call quite a bit. Solid starters are noticebly absent, and the return ofRollie Fingers and Pete Vuckovich is an uncertainty. If Milwaukee can find one or two good starters, it could be a good year for the Brew Crew. 
Toronto (89-73) -Last year was Bobby Cox's first year as manager ofthe Blue Jays and it was a !Jighly successful one. He took theJays to a fou.rth-place finish and Toronto ought to do as well this season. Alfredo Griffin and Damaso Garcia make up one of the best double-play combinations in the league. Dave Stieb, Jim Clancy, and Luis Leal give the Jays three good starters, with the strong chance that either Doyle Alexander orJim Gott could come through as a dependable fourth man. If recently acquired Dennis Lamp can come through as the stopper, there's a chance that Toronto fans could still be watching baseball when hockey season opens. 
New York (91-71) -Who's on first? Who's on third? Omar Moreno and Toby Har­rah right now for the Yankees. But for how long? As long as George Steinbrenner con­tinues to be puppeteer ofmanagers, the Bronx Bombers will continue to bomb as much as they did in the exhibition season. The Yanks have good depth but never seem to find one everyday player for most positions. The pitch­ing ought to be good with Ron Guidry and the new short relief man, Dave Righetti, leading

tially outstanding pitching staff which in­cludes starters Steve Rogers (17-12), Bill Gullickson ( 1 7-12 ), and Charlie Lea ( 16-11 ), as well as newly acquired Fred Breining from San Francisco. Rogers and Breining already have sore shoulders, so the Expos could have a rough start. The bullpen ofJelfReardon, Dan Schatzeder, Bob james, and former-Padre Gary Lucas could be the league's best, but the big question is whether or not Pete Rose can be both a consistent leftfielder and a much­needed spark to a team lacking enthusiasm. 
Philadelphia (90-72) -The Phillies could have the best team in the division, but there are a lot of questions that won't be answered until the season unfolds. The most important of these is whether new starters Len Matuszek (first base) and Juan Samuel (second base) can make the fans forget the "Big Red" memory of Pete Rose and joe Mor­gan. The pitching is pretty solid with Cy Young Award winners Steve Carlton and john Denny topping the list of starters, and veterans AI Holland and Tug McGraw leading the bullpen corps. The logjam in the outfield was broken up with the trading of Gary Mat­thews to Chicago, and the Phillies strengthened their bullpen with the acquisi­tion of Bill Campbell. 
St. Louis (79-83) -The Cardinals didn't do a very good job of defending the NL pen­nant last season as they spent most ofthe year under the .,500 mark and wound up finishing fourth. Whitey Herzog apparently feels that everyone just had an off-y t car because the Cards opened the season with essentially the same pitching staff that finished 1983. To make matters worse, the staff will be missing John Stuper and Danny Cox, who are both sidelined indefinitely with arm injuries. Defense and speed will again be the Cards' major strength -Willie McGee, Ozzie Smith, Tommy Herr, Lonnie Smith, Andy Van Slyke, and David Green are all basestealing threats. George Hendrick will be back in rightfield, and Green will move in at first base, but other­

the way, especially with the way that John Montefusco and 18-year-old Jose Rijo have done in the spring. Dave Winfield could turn out to be the only bright spot in what might otherwise be a long season for Steinbrenner 
andCb. 

Cleveland (70-92) -A strong pitching staffcan really carry a team and that will have to be the case this year in Cleveland. Luckily for the Indians, they have the arms. Veteran Bert Blyleven, Rick Sutcliffe, and Neal Heaton are the core of an excellent staff that is going to have to pick up the slack for all else the Tribe lacks, which could fill up a couple reservations. Julio Franco, Tony Bernazard, and the dependable Andre Thornton will have to be the main men for Cleveland day-in and day-out. Now that the Indians have George Frazier as their stopper and have gotten rid of Gorman Thomas, things could finally pick for Cleveland fans. Don't count on it, though, considering that this is the American League East. 
Boston (78-84)-Wade Boggs may not be the greatest third baseman but the guy can sure hit. In simplistic terms, Boggs will have to get on andJim Rice will have drive him home with some consistency in order for Boston to do much of anything this year. Dwight Evans and Tony Armas round out an excellent out­field which will be doing a lot of scurrying about the wide open pasture ofFenway when other teams take Red Sox pitchers to town. Add to that the fact that the Boston infield could be compared to a seive and you see that manager Ralph Houk has some serious problems. Ifthe Bosox hitters could only get together on a team with the Indian pitchers ...

wise this is the same Cardinal team that flopped in '83, not the World Series team of '82. 
Chicago (71-91) -Hoping to benefit from a managerial change, the Cubs enter 1984 with a chance for substantial improve­ment. Jim Frey, who last managed in Kansas City, has a potential power-hitting team with Leon Durham, Jody Davis, Bill Buckner, Ron Cey, Keith Moreland, and Gary Matthews. Startfng pitching will be the Cubs major con­cern, however, as Chuck Rainey, Dick Ruth­ven, Scott Sanderson, and Steve Trout form a less-than-dependable quartet. The Cubs were a dismal 13-35 on artificial turf last year, but Frey didn't seem to mind the carpet in Royals 
Stadium when he took K.C. to the Series in 1980. 
New York (68-94) -The Mets will be sporting a lot of young talent this season, as they enter the eleventh year of their major rebuilding project. New manager Davey .Johnson has a strong bullpen with Jesse Orosco, Doug Sisk, and Dick Tidrow, as well as a the offensive punch of Keith Hernandez, George Foster, and rookie-of-the-year Darryl Strawberry. He also has a plethora of good young pitchers like Ron Darling, Dwight Gooden, Tim Leary, and Walt Terrell. Unfor­tunately, he doesn't have Tom Seaver or anyone else that can provide leadership for an erratic pitching staff Nor does he have a con­Sistent offensive team, the kind that can win without a dominant pitching staff.

improve -the addition of bullpen ace Bill Caudill is definitely a step in the right direc­tion -the A's could turn out ·to be the surprise of the league. If not, they could be struggling to get to .500. 
Kansas City (79-83) -If it's true that facing adversity builds character, then the Royals should have the strongest chllracter in the majors. Injuries hurt the team's chances last year, and a drug problem has cast a shadow over the organization. With star pitcher Dennis Leonard out for at least halfthe season and Willie Wilson out until May 15 on suspension, nobody has given the Royals much ofa chance. But Kansas City knows how to win, and it's hard to ignore a team with players like George Brett, Hal McRae, Frank White, and Dan Quisenberry. Ifyoung players like Don Sheridan and veterans like Larry Gura come through, the Royals could make some big waves. They probably don't have enough to worry Chicago, but they could fmish second again. 
Texas (77-85) -Last year, Doug Rader performed miracles in his first year in charge of the Rangers. He somehow turned many of his players into overachievers who provided about the only challenge to the White Sox all year. The unsung Ranger pitchingstaffhad the lowest team ERA in the league, although the ace of the staff, Rick Honeycutt, the league's ERA leader, was traded near the end of the season. Dave Stewart, who came to Texas in the Honeycutt trade, must pick up die slack or it could be a long year for the team. The pitch­ing staff was weakened over the winter when two pretty good pitchers -Mike Smithson andJohn Butcher -were traded for more hit­ting. If some of the overachievers like Odell Jones and Wayne Tolleson fade, Texas could also fade right into the cellar. 
Minnesota (70-92) -Twins owner Calvin Griffith is looking for some large crowds this year or he might move the team out of Min­neapolis. That would be too bad for the Twins fans, because the team looks to be just a year or two away from challenging in the division. Minnesota is loaded with good young hitters like Kent Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, and Tom Brunansky. Tom Teufel shows great potential at second base, andJim Eisenreich could be an outstanding center fielder ifhe overcomes his nervous problem (the Twins are confident that he has recovered). Even the awful pitch-
continued from page 12 
Alejandro Pena and Bob Welch are coming off of good years, the Dodgers really don't know what to expect from Fernando Valenzuela, Jerry Reuss, and Burt Hooton. The Dodgers have a hideous defense and have no hope of winning this division unless their gloves im­prove. Steve Sax will be the key to success for the Dodgers this year. Sax must make the throw from second to first, and he must be the offensive catalyst in the L.A. lineup. The Dodgers don't hit the home-run ball the way they used to, but the system is still strong enough that Los Angeles will contend. If Pedro Guerrero ever gets hurt, it will be a quick sayonara for this team. 
Atlanta (88-74)-Yes, the Braves have the best eight-man starting lineup in baseball, but then again, so did the Boston Red Sox in 1978. Look where it got them. There is no question the Braves will contend. Atlanta suffers the loss of two starters in all-star Pascual Perez and veteran Phil Niekro, and now must rebuild the starting rotation. However, the Braves did not have outstanding starting pitching when they won in 1982, and the arms ofSteve Bedrosian and Gene Garber will keep Atlanta in business. Dale Murphy, the National League's MVP the past two years, is the leader of this club. The last two seasons have helped the Braves build some experience and a.grcat deal of comradery. Atlanta still has defensive questions on the left side of the field that may plague them, though. 
San Diego (81-81)-Rich Gossage, Steve Garvey, Graig Nettles -these folks are well­known to the baseball world and have a lot of people picking the Padres this season. But the question to the San Diego faithful is: Can you name a Padre outfielder? The only one I can think of is Alan Wiggins and he is playing second base. Even though you need a program to figure out who is playing out there for San Diego, the pitching staff may be the best ever for the Padres. Eric Show, Dave Dravecky, and Tim Lollar will be key pitchers, but there is great pitching depth in Luis DeLeon, Sid

ing staff of a year ago is looking much better. 
Mike Smithson and John Butcher joined the 
team in a trade, and Ron Davis is one of the 
best bullpen stoppers in the league. Ifpitchers 
like Len Whitehouse and Pete Filson improve 
a little, Minnesotacould challenge for second. 
california (70-92) -The Angels, while 
they will be starting two rookies -Gary Pet­tis and Gary Schofield -are still a very old team. They are relying on veteran players on the mound and in the field. This is not neces­sarily bad, but many ofthe Gilifornia veterans are starting to show their age. Tommy John, Ken Forsch, and Geoff Zahn do not have the ·stamina to pitch through an entire season. Worst of all, there is no bullpen to back them up. The hitting is still there, with Rod Carew and Doug DeCinces, but ReggieJackson has to bounce back from his worst year ever. The An­gels have the experience to win the division, but all those creaking bones seem to indicate that they will finish closer to the bottom than 
to the top. 
Seattle (60-102) -Two years ago, the 
Mariners finished 76-86 and looked to be a 
team of the future. Last year's 60-102 record 
made that future seem very far away. It still is. 
However, Seattle picked up some good bats in 
Gorman Thomas and Barry Bonnell, so there 
should be some more runs scored in the 
Kingdome than there were last year. The 
pitching rotation of Matt Young, Bob Stud­
dard,Jim Beattie, and Mike Moore isn't great, 
but it is adequate. In short, the Mariners 
should be improved enough to challenge for 
fourth orfifth. With this poor division, though, 
they could finish even higher. It is possible 
that a team with a losing record could finish 
second -just like last year.

. Houston 
Monge, Ed Whitson, and Gossage. No, they don't have the bats, and they don't have stellar defense, but pitching and speed will keep this team in contention until the last two weeks of the season. 
Cincinnati (74-88) -Slowly but surely the Reds are trying to make a return to the game of baseball. Newly-acquired Dave Parker should help this young team's offensive output. Cincinnati is also getting a long hard look at young catcher Dann Billardello. As for the pitching staff, new skipper Vern Rapp must ask "Is there life after Mario Soto?'' Un­fortunately, the opposing bats in Riverfront this summer will answer a resounding "No!" 
San Francisco (79-83) -Remember all the rumors of Manager Frank Robinson losing his job? By the end of this season, we won't have to worry because 1\>binson will be long gone. The Giants have picked up a pair ofcon­summate pros in veterans AI Oliver and Mm· ny Trillo. The San Francisco outfield includes such notables as Jack Clark, Chili Davis. and Gene Richards. Unfortunately, the team lacks the chemistry ofa winner because ofpoor at­titude. Regular outbursts by malcontent Clark continue to hurt a team with enough problems. The pitching staff is not deep at all and the defense still includes johnnie LeMas­ter at shortstop. So much for defense. This team sounds like a perfect case for, you guessed it, Billy Martin. While the team has potential to finish above .500, poor attitude will wipe out the Giants quickly.

"Gann is a polished football player with outstanding athletic ability," Lantz says. "He possesses a lot of knowledge, which allows him to ad­just to different situations, and he is also very confident ofhis ability." 
One thing that may be lacking for Lantz is depth. 
Sophomore Wally Kleine, who has looked good so far this spring, has the tools that are needed to make a good replacement. The 6-8, 278­pound giant is big enough that he can make a few mistakes at frrst, but his coach is looking forward to im­provement. 
"Our whole line needs to get the experience so they can play with confidence and be aggressive," Lantz states. "They can't just go through the motions." 
"We believe there's enough talent on the defensive line that, if every­thing goes right, we will he a dominating force," Lantz predicts. 
Lantz's goal for the spring is to es­tablish a depth chart with the posi­tions filled two-deep. 
"We think that we're making the kind of progress we need," Lantz comments on his impression of the linemen at this point. "It's easy with defensive linemen because we do the same things over and over, so our techni4ues will improve pretty fast." 
Lantz looks to fifth-year seniorJer­ry Weinle and sophomore Byron Spruell, who is hampered with a knee injury, to compete for the remaining backup spots. 
With the defensive scheme focus­ing on situational substituting, Lantz would like to find out who are his best players for each situation. 
The defensive line does seem to be shaping up fairly well, and there still is much time for Lantz's squad to improve before next fall. 

The predictions for the 1984 baseball season

In recent years, the team with the second­or third-best record in the major leagues did not even win its division. Why? Simple. It was in the American League East. 
The chances for the same thing happening this season are good, as Baltimore, Detroit, and Milwaukee all should make runs at tOO­win seasons and the Ea'it crown. And, al­though the favorite will again be the Orioles, don't be surprised to see the Tigers or Brewers sneak in. 
Baltimore (98-64)-Oriole pitching is al­ways among the tops in all ofbaseball and this year should lx no exception, as the Birds con­tinue to pull gems out of their farm system. Last year it wa'i Mike Boddickcr, who came out of nowhere to become MVP of the American League Championship Series. Bod­dickt·r joins the starting staffof Mike Flanagan, Scott McGregor, Jim Palmer, and Storm Davis as the occasional fifth man, all of whom hold lifetimt.· winning percentages over .600. Amerkan League MVP Cal Ripkcn and runner­up Eddie Murray arc two constants for Bat­timon-, both of whom always do more than their share in the fidd and at the plate. It be hard for the two to matl'h their 
sea'i<>ns year ago, but anything dose to that should more than enough to catapult tht.· O's into top spot. As for the World Championship, take tht.· Orioles and any odds your local bookie might give you. 
Detroit (92-70)-Sparky Anderson is call­ing this his best team yet, even counting the powerful Red teams he managed in the early 70's. Anderson, though, has been known to make similiar statements in the pao;t so his es­timate ofteam strength should be taken with a grain ofsalt. Not to say the Tigers won't be an awfully good ball club. They will. Up the

The 1984 season should not be much dif­ferent from the 1983 season for the American League West. Once again, the division should win the title as the major's weakest division with little argument. Also, the most interest­ing race in the division should be for second place. 
The Chicago White Sox should have little problem repeating as division champs, even if they do not match last year's 99-63 record. What should be interesting is the race for the last six spots in the division, as all six teams have a shot at second place, depending on who gets hot and who does not. 
Chicago (99-63) -The White Sox are, once again, head and shoulders above the rest of the division. They have nearly everyone coming back, so there is really no rea'>on to doubt that they will repeat. The pitching wao; the best in the division last year and should be one of the top stafi5 again this year. The speed is there, as is the power. The only meaningful change wao; adding Tom Seaver to the pitching staffto replace free agent reliever Dennis Lamp. Losing Lamp could hurt more than people expect, especially near the end of the year when the starters' arms get tired. Still, the White 'Sox could hurt themselves if they start believing they are as good as the Chicago papers and fans say they are. They should not even think ofa World Series until they win the AL pennant -which still could be a year or two away from happening. 
Oakland (74-88) -The young A's probab­ly have the best chance of making a run at the White Sox. Last year, their pitching staff was comprised of a number of rookies who im­proved as the year went by. One rookie, Mike Warren, even pitched a no-hitter in his last outing of the season. If the staff continues to

The National League East may not have been baseball's most talented division during the past few seasons, but it has provided plenty of excitement during that time. The 1984 season should prove no exception to either of these trends. As usual, any one of several teams could wind up leading the pack, and if you stretch your imagination a little (well, for New Yorkers, maybe a lot), each team has a legitimate chance to be in conten­tion most of the way in a race that should go right down to the wire again. 
Pittsburgh (84-78) -Ifpitching, like they say, is really 90 percent of the game, then the Pirates should be the team to beat this year. Larry McWilliams, John Candelaria, Rick Rhoden, and the newly-acquired John Tudor all won at least 13 games last season as start­ers, and rookiesJose DeLeon and Lee Tunnell were impressive in August and September. The bullpen will be strong because the team persuaded top-notch fireman Kent Tekulve that there's no place like home. The Bucs have some, but not a lot, ofoffense to go with their pitching. Four-time NL batting champ Bill Madlock, along with jason Thompson, Tony Pena, and Dale Berra wil he counted on to supply most ofthe frrepower. Rookie rightfiel­der Doug Frobel had an outstanding spring and could become a regular soon. Chuck Tan­ncr is hoping that he'll hit more and gripe less than did Dave Parker. 
Montreal (82-80) -The Expos are 4uick­ly getting the reputation of a team that looks great on paper every year, plays well into the stretch, but then folds at the season's end. When things like that happen several years in a row, it starts to have an effect on a team's confidence. This season, the loss of AI Oliver will hurt, but manager Bill Virdon has a poten­

Over the past two years, the National League West has been dominated by two clubs -the Atlanta Braves and the Los An­geles Dodgers. However, while the Braves may be "America's Team," and the Dodgers arc defending champs of this division, neither team has taken steps to improve. 
Atlanta and Los Angeles both are trying to fill voids in their pitching staffs because of drug problems, and, in a sport where good pitching leads to wins, these teams will lose their edge. 
Four ballclubs will contend for the National League West title. All four have 4uestion marks, but the team with the best pitching and defense will take it. That team is the Houston Astros. 
Houston (85-77) -Strong starters and strong relievers make the Astros a strong choice for first. Nolan Ryan and Joe Niekro anchor a staff which has good young pitchers (watch for rookie Mike Madden to have a big year) and a proven bullpen in young.'itcrs Bill Dawley (51 hits allowed in 79 innings pitched in '8.3) and Frank DiPino (52 hits in 71 in­nings). One of baseball's great young shortstops, Dickie Thon, anchors a splendid infield, which includes solid hitting from Ray Knight and Phil Garner. Thon, who hit .286, with 20 home runs and 79 runs batted in la'it season, could be an MVP candidate this year. OutfielderJerry Mumphrey is back on the Na­tional League artificial turf, where his speed and hitting will be of great value to Houston. The Astros won't lead the league in homers, hut nobody hits homers in the Astrodome, anyway. The acquisition of Enos Cabell and Alan Bannister will add depth should injuries occur.
