Hall Presidents discuss variety of problems 
by Steve Lazar Statuatory rape, drinking, vio­lence and room picks were the subject of discussion at the meeting as the HPC prepared to draft reports concerning hall life for the Student Life Council and Board of Trustees, at their meet­ing last night The report for the Board of Trustees is to deal with parietal hours drinking, and the hall staffs, that is, rectors and resi­dent assistants in each hall. The 
SLC want information about parietal hours and drinking. 
The problem with parietal hours, as the Council sees it, is that high school age girls can easily wander in to the halls to find alcoholic beverages readily available to them, as well as students interested in sexual "familiarities." According to In­diana State law, if a girl fifteen years old or younger accuses a student of having sexual inter­course with her, there is little he can do to defend himself. 
"If the girl (a minor) walks in someday with her parents or the law, and puts the finger on somebody-well, you've had it," explained one Council member. 

The problem with drinking could be equally serious. A stu­dent accused of supplying alco­holic beverages to a person be­low the age of eighteen could be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Such accusations could result in the 
Junior Parent schedule issued Discount 5th Dimension tickets 

Jim D' Aurora chairman of the Junior Parents-Son Weekend Committee, announced last night that all Notre Dame Juniors will have the oppor­tunity to buy an unrestricted number of discount priced tic­kets to the Saturday, March l4 concert-in-the-round given by the 5th Dimension. 
The discount tickets, which will be sold March 3rd and 4th at the Athletic and Convocation Center, are being reduced by $1.00 for the $4.50 and $2.50 sections only. D'Aurora said that all students can buy a maximum of two tickets at the reduced price, but that only Juniors can buy an unlimited number. 
D' Aurora also said that be­cause of the conflict in the time schedules of the concert and the Junior Parents-Son Dinner that evening, the Dinner will be moved back from 7:30 to 6: IS p.m. Also revealed at last night's meeting were the Saturday morning .and afternoon activities 
of Junior Parents-Son Weekend. 
During the morning hours, 
parents and sons will meet with 
the department chairmen of 
every academic major offered on 
campus. The department heads 
will present information about 
the academic nature of each 
major, and will also discuss 
career opportunities in each 
field. The schedule of the time

will speak will be given to each 
Junior at the time he registers

The President's concern with 
drinking, though, was the de­
struction of property that results 
when students are under the 
influence of alcohol. One hall 
president felt that drinking was 
to be expected when students 
have little to do on a weekend: 
"You can't isolate drinking as a social problem of the halls because it's a natural way for the guys to let off steam. On week­ends when there are lots of social acitivities going they don't need to just sit around and drink," he said. 
A problem that increases in 1 potentiality with the indulgence of heavy drinking is physical violence, they thought. Alumni Hall, often plagued with racial tensions, has seen a number of fights occassioned by intoxicat­ed persons from town. The hall president, Tony Scolaro, expres­sed the need for a security guard on weekends rather than only a 
fire guard. 
Another problem confronting the halls is that of room picks. Carroll Hall may by forced to close its doors to undergraduates . next year if the University turns the building over to graduate students. This would mean that as many as 70 students would have to find other accomoda­tions on or off campus. With the 
towers and a few other halls already overburdened with stu­dents, the displaced Carroll re­sidents would come near the bottom of the list as far as room picks go. 
At the close of last night's meeting, HPC chairman Tom Suddes invited anyone with a specific concern about parietals or drinking to come to tonight's meeing at 10 pm in the Student Center Amphitheatre. Student o­pinions on these subjects would be very helpful to the HPC, he stated. 

More SMC housing 
by Prudence Wear 
SMC News Editor 

The Student Affairs Com­mittee was unable to finalize a proposal for Off-Campus Hous-· ing last night, and will meet Friday to attempt to resolve the issue. 
At last week's meeting, two proposals were presented; one was formulated by the Director of Housing, Mrs. Petrovich, and the other by junior senator Carol Cusick who has been working on the Committee for Off-Campus Housing. The committee mem­bers were to study the proposals and begin discussion last even­ing. 
At the beginning oflast night's meeting, Carol stated that the basic difference between the two proposals was that hers allows sophomores, juniors, and seniors to live off the campus, where the other applies to only seniors. 
In addition, her proposal con­tains fewer rules pertaining to social and academic standing and eliminates the rule which pro­
hibits male residents in the hous- ing areas. 
Carol said of the last point, "this proposal has an orientation to the student's freedom to act in a way reflecting only personal principles or those of her family. 
A motion was made to con­sider the proposal of the Direct­or of Housing and was defeated. 
The motion to consider Cusick's proposal point by point was passed and a long discussion of the first point followed. 
At the end of the discussion, one of the members suggested that the committee meet again this week. She noted that the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees is to meet on March 14 and before that time an Off-Campus Housing proposal had to be sent to and passed by the Student Affairs Council. There will be an overflow of approximately 110 students next September and the decision must be made as to where the college will house them.

Nutting speaks on academic reform 
Dr. Willis D. Nutting, profes­sor in the General Program at Notre Dame, will speak at 8:00 PM in the Library Auditorium on Wednesday, March 4. Nutting will lecture on "The Free City", the title of his most prominent book. Nutting has come to prominence on the campus during the past few weeks as a group of students have begun a campaign of "Nutting for Presi­dent" of Notre Dame. The students are urging the Univer­sity to adopt a Chancellor­Pr~:sident system, by which the Chancellor, Rev. Theodore M. H.esburgh would handle external affairs while the President would be responsible for internal affairs. 
The popular Nutting will be the second of a series of lectures on the question of Academic Reforms. The first lecture was delivered by sociologist and critic Paul Goodman who spoke on "Contemporary Mis­education in America." Whereas

the entire year on campus," Goodman concentrated on ele­mentary and secondary educa­tion, Nutting will focus on higher education as he did in The Free City. The lecture will also give people an opportunity to hear a man, who has been promoted so rigorously for the presidency of Notre Dame. 

Nutting was born in Iowa where his father was a professor at the University of I ow a; Nutting him~df earned his B.A. from Iowa and studied at Ox­ford as a Rhodes Scholar, where he received his B.A. and B.Litt. degrees. He then attained his Ph.D at the State University of Iowa. He has been a professor at Notre Dame since 1936. His special studies have ranged from agrarianism to an examination of popular religion in the Orthodox 


('11Urch of modern Greece. In addition to the Free city, he has written How Firm a Foundation, The Reclamation of Indepen­dence and Schools and the 

Means of Education. His wide diversity of academic activities have been amnifested in the var­iety of courses that he has taught: theology, history and the classics. One of the more noted events of his career was a televised debate with Ara Parse­ghian on the relative merits of football 
stated Crawford. Crawford con­tended that management of the Club is being closely watched by the University. According to the Senior Class President, the Club is "on trial." If it fails, Crawford said that the University will give it to the c;su or the University Arts Center. "Should the financing of the Club fall through," Crawford said, "the dunes excusions and parties of Senior Week would be charged-for events or cancelled altogether." Crawford traced the Club's deficit to a regular turnout of only 600 regular members. He estimated "at least 1,000 stu­dents" are needed to "make this year's Cluh a success." Crawford gave reasons why he felt there was such a small turn­out. Many, he noted, have kept away because of the new pari~:tal hours, drinking regulations, the past image of the Club from "former yea~," and a lack of SMC girls. Crawford said that he felt that the $1,000 spent in redecorating the Alumni Club during the sum­mer and lht! managem~:nt of Randy Harkins have "tra­nsformed the Club." He there­fore encourages "more SMC girls without dates" to come and "look it·over." "The !'acuity-Senior Night, a recent innovation, proved a huge success" said Crawford.

Tom Hufendick 419 Breen Phillips Off the grass Editor: We have taken Fr. Lochner's suggestion to heart and decided to stay off the grass. Now we will be forced to utilize the mainline route. We realize that this may be a bit painful at first but after the initial job of it has worn off we are sure we will reach greater heights of euphoria on our trips across campus. These trips will now take on more meaning for us as we grow to appreciate the high quality of Notre Dame grass. Perhaps our decision will needle the Phys Ed department but it will add speed to our maturation process as our Jives reach a new peak. Lettuce have peas & mush­rooms Ever devotedly your in Notre Dame, L. Emmet Ballantine 306 Badin Hall Poor planning Editor: Referring to Rev. Robert J. Lochner's letter in The Observer of Feb. 25. I have for sometime been meaning to write the Observer concerning the marked increase of trodden footpaths across the sprawling green lawns of Du Lac. Rev. Lochner's Jetter, however, completely misses the point. He seems to place the blame for these depreciating lawns on lazy students. I must dispute this. If anybody is to blame it is the  Phillips Hall and the side doors of the Library. It seems quite absurd to me that somebody didn't forsee such a path when the Lib­rary was being built and put a sidewalk there. True to form. however, sidewalks were layed in a handsome grid pattern, resulting today in seldom used sidewalks and an ugly dirt path across the lawn. Why doesn't somebody put a sidewalk there? The Adminis­tration plants new grass there every spring, only to have it tram­pled again. I guarantee you that less grass would be ruined if side­walks were placed where they should naturally be. I strongly urge Rev. Lochner to redirect his berating comments toward the peiole responsible for the poor planning rather than at the "lazy" students. And if Rev. Lochner is ser­iously concerned with the deprec­iating beauty of this campus, perhaps he ought to concern himself more with th'e Ellerbe dynasty that is turning this campus into an architectural nightmare, rather than scattered patches of trampled grass. Even beautiful lawns won't improve an ugly, poorly designed building (i.e. our famous picture postcard grain elevator turned library). Think about it. Sincerely, John W. Kuhn Opinion please  to give my opinion." Sincerely, J. Kelly Flynn 308-229 Howard Hall Communist plot Editor: Leaders of the Union of So­viet Socialist Republics have bragged many times that Ameri­cans would pay for their own destruction. These leaders, for fifty years, have been marching to victory. Every American has had the opportunity to discover that riots, racism and hatred were importations from Moscow by way of Cuba. Despite this, they not only coddled the criminal but, like Pontius Pilate, dare to ask sacriligiously, "What is truth?" The truth is that Communism is winning. Last night at the Auditorium in the Department of Education on the Ole Miss Campus, I heard a member of· the North Mississippi Legal Ser­vices which is funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity openly encourage revolution Marxist style circa Russia, 191 7. American taxpayers pay this black racist's salary. Tonight, I can attend a local theatre and view a Paramount Picture, "If" which is beautifully made, deceptively lethal. It is a film which has found a great receptive audience among cam­pus revolutionaries.

Ted Price· Stick to campaign issues Spring is coming to the Groovy Midwestern Catholic University. And with the return of warmth and beauty will come the inevitable reawakening of student idealism in the campus elections. Five candidates have already announced and other machines are being ginned up. There will be much talk of community and student rights and sophomore cars and the whole nine yards. Then we'll elect someone, and turn to more important things like frisbee on the quads -and if the freshmen don't decide to recall the SBP in October, campus politics will be forgotten for another year at Notre Dame. But before this mass student catharsis, think back on the outgoing administration and the ones that preceded it. What has been their worth? Or, more properly, what have been their accomplishments? In the closest election in the history of student government, Phil McKenna beat John Mroz after weeks of debate over the meaning of the word "community." Now, he leaves office after a colorless year of minimal accomplishment. As Mayor Lindsey's song goes, "Where Has the Charisma Gone?" Maybe it's gone to the Student Life Council. Maybe, but I doubt it. The SLC has certainly been the focus of whatever progress Notre Dame has made in student life. But at the same time, it has permitted itself to become bogged down on larger philosophical questions. Sadly, student life is not a larger philosophical question. It is a day-to-day problem which is much Jess fun to deal with than the Burning Issues of Our Times. When Minch Lewis organized the mass "sleep-out" on the quads to force the abolition of the lights-out rule and bed checks, he was not debating the Great Issues. When the student senate, under Chris (believe-it-or-not) Murphy abolished coats and ties at dinner, they weren't talking about Larger Societal Problems. Two small steps, in retrospect, but they weren't so unimportant then. Face it: since student government has begun its quixotic tilt with society's windmills, the Student Life Council has taken over the job of resolution of campus issues. And its performance has been frighteningly poor, as Prof. Norling's bitter resignation statement pointed out. Maybe this is the way things were meant to be: student government being a forum of in-group members thinking radical thoughts with no action to back them up -except, of course, a financially solvent student union. Progress will be made by the Student Life Council but only when it cares to take a break from decisions like Red China's admission to the U.N.  
planners, whoever they may be, who layed the sidewalks down in the first place.

But if so, I'm not paying my student activities fee next fall. On the other hand, student government could seek to overcome its growing superfluity. It could realize its true role.  
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. When hundreds of students a day travel between these two points, it seems natural that a sidewalk would be placed along this path.

Up to now, student government has been too busy for such trivia. But maybe their workload can be lightened if they leave national politics to the campus chapters of the national political fronts. Lord )cnows, we have plenty of these, from YAF to SDS. Student government could then have time for student issues. 
So bring on spring, and bring on student elections. But don't ask me to vote here and now on the evils of American society. I'll do that in November's national elections, thanks.

The American Scene: Absurd and relevant 

hy David Allen Edmonds 
Thc letter is A. 

A as in Absurd. Absurd as in the ND-SMC produdion of Edward Albee's 71ze American Dream. Albee's play is a modt:l of absurdity: it shows the contra­dictions of life through a hollow plot line and figures that arc caricatures of real people. There is not much a director can do ext:ept to accentuate the inherent absurd-ness. 
This is exactly what director William T. Byrd has done. The American Dream is set in an apartment, and Byrd's concep­tion of this is a primary-colored vinyl monstrosity, filled with inflatable, plastic furniture. Albee would love it, for besides reflecting absurdity, Byrd has created a motif of plasticity that grounds the play in contempomry America. This plasticity is also carried through in the costuming, as Daddy wears a black vinyl suit, and Mommy is covered by a picnictablecloth dress. 
Byrd has done an excellent job of directing his actors. They bring out all that the author intended, and perhaps more. Daddy (Francis Donovan) is the perfect whimpery husband, sitting in his easy chair (plastic) wringing his hands, and saying "yes, dear, whatever you say, dcar." Jean-Marie Meier's Mommy was marvelously bitchy. From the reactions of the audience, I wasn't the only one who wanted to belt her one right across the mouth, and that's what the part is supposed to do. Iler posture and overall carriage was perfect and a credit to her talent as an actress. Rita Gall succeeded in convincing the audience that Gramma was the only one in the play with any sense, and I espet:ially liked her peace medallion. Christine Hall, well, what can you say about Christine llall? Her Mrs. Barker was simply searing and her stage presence was simply titillating. 
Every detail of Chuck Amato's Young Man added to the desired. His muscular physique was deeply tanned, topped with a too-blond head of hair and covered only with translucent white levi's. His hand movements, both when erect and when stiffly inserted in a chair, completely reflected the phallic-ness of his character. 
The letter is R. 
R as in relevant to today's racial tension, and relevant to The Death of Bessie Smith, the second half of the Theater's production. 

Realism might be just as good a label, however, as a different tack was used in this play. Byrd wanted to stress the tension of American life that is rooted in cast) did an excellent job in handling the Race. His set incorporated hard, straight, .

incidentally, either black or white. The use of multi-sensory media (slides and off-stage noises) served to concretize the action and to build the tension. 
Emotion is the sister of tension, and this was best brought out by Missy Smith in the role of the Nurse. She ranted and raved and succeeded in intensifying the production. Miss Smith (and the whole 


Dreams .... or nightmares?

1/ostile, h/oodthirsty forces have seen to the printing of the following review. After noting the Brogan-less Monday fea­tures page, 350,000 raging Brogan devo­tees stormed the student center and demanded the head of the features editor. After learning that this individual had lost his head months ago, the angry mass agreed to settle for Tuesday afterthoughts by their impeccable leader. -Features ed. 
The combination Beatles, Doors. and Blood, Sweat and Tears, that we were promised by the Student Union last week arrived in all their glory last Saturday evening in Stepan Center. 
It was one of those small events to fill the long, cold winter nights that we had been promised for so many years. No gala affair -just a samll inexpensive happen­ing on campus. Another Woodstock, or so they claim. 
For many long winters the student body has gone into hibernation (or so it is also claimed) not to emerge again until the next football season. This winter was to be different: we could sleep while visions of a new student union activity danced in our heads. But when finally awakened in Stepan Center, we found that our hopes turned out to be only dreams. 
It has yet to be proved that six studio musicians, no matter how excellent each one was individually, automatically can make a super-group once they join forces. It takes a mixture of faith, trust, and unselfishness as well as talent and practice to make any sort of dent in today's musical world. 
Just because you once played behind an excellent group doesn't mean that your group will be excellent. Because you once played in the majors, doesn't make your present farm-club any better as a team. 
The Dreams were excellent musicians, . II th . d I can't pral·se.

have ever heard in a live performance. He was not a great showman, he was not theatrical, but he could drum. And drum he did. Excellently. 
Each of the six members could play his 
own instrument and play it well. But as 
far as playing together, they had their 
troubles. A replication of the opening of 'the first set can be heard for free any afternoon outside of the band room, where. a number of student musicians arc practicing difficult tunes at the same time. 
They tried to imitate Blood, Sweat and Tears, even as far as the voice of David Clayton Thomas. An uncomfortable voice for the lead vocalist, who doubled on the bass. The organist tried his turn at imita­ting and sounded as if he were crossing the throaty screaming of a Jim Morrison,] and the bluesy-greased sandpaper voice of' a Joe Cocker. The whole group was· I obviously trying to be something that' they were not. The brass section sounded as tinny as the ceiling of Stepan Center' looks. 
But luckily, this didn't last. By the second half, they had stopped being :pretentious, and had settled down to making their own music. They showed great potential in their closing pieces with their combination jazz-rock. It was not .the commercial rock -then jazz -then rock forced mixture of the BS&T, but an honest effort at combining the two music 'forms and, best of all, it finally worked. 
But viewing the concert as an entity, we are forced to note that the greatest audience reaction was to the individual solos, not the whole group. They've already proven themselves individually, but we are still wondering if they can play as a group. Hopefully, someday, the six members of the Dreams will combine to be the Dream they could be.

In a press conferen~e yester­day afternoon, Pat McDonough, Student Union Academic Com­missioner announced that the Academic Commission would be from approximately $1000 to $3000 under their budget. 
Through February 11, when the commiSSIOn resubmitted their budget to the Senate, only $1 1 ,000 of their $ 18,000 alloca­tion had been spent. He stated that their financial situation is generally good, because of changes in their budgeting through the "encumbrance system," and a new system in choosing the commission's guest speakers. 
Although it had been the poli­cy of past commissions to bring in top name speakers, this year's commission chose instead to concentrate on the subject mat­ter involved. Under this system, McDonough commented, "we were able to budget ourselves in such a manner that we could present as many programs during the first semester as last year's commission did in the entire year and at half the cost." Thus, it has been possible at later times in the year to bring in unsche­duled speakers such as Dr. Spock and still remain well within our budget. 
McDonough however stressed that the overall situation is not entirely without its problems. It was at this point then, that he revealed that the Indian Confer­ence was the only event spon­sored this year that ended up in the red. He explained that al­though Bill Kurz and his com­mittee began this conference with the best of intentions, they were unfortunately taken advan­tage of by the delegates. In describing the resultant situa­tion, he stated that it was simply a case of "promising too much money, for too many people." 
Part of this situation was attri: buted to a lack of communica­
tion with the Academic Com­missioner, who at the time had only recently taken office due to the resignation of Pat Dowdall. Thus, while $2,400 had been allocated to the Indian Confer­ence, $5,000 was the ultimate expenditure, making this the most expensive event sponsored this year. Presently, then, the exact amount that the commis­sion will be under their budget is not known, and no further events can be added to this year's present calendar until this is determined. 

McDonough further revealed that although the Indian Confer­ence has at this point lost money, its chairman Bill Kurz is attempting to obtain federal funds to pay for part of its deficit. This may be possible, since the government has spon­The Student Arts Festival continues through the rest of the week in the Old Fieldhouse. sored a series of conferences of this type around the country, and our conference may thus

Frosh face computer exerc1se Provides insight to concepts 
What materials could be used to make a spherical bubble capable of traveling 35,000 feet down into the ocean without buckling or collapsing, and bouyant enough to float to the surface if the power failed? 
This is not a major problem facing research scientists, but a computer exercise for freshmen students majoring in engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Or. Stuart T. McComas, asso­ciate professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering, directs the introduction to engineering concepts course this year. 
Students arc taught the ele­mentary computer language FORTRAN, as well as the more advanced assembly language and the basic theory behind com­puter operation. For their final problem last semester, the fresh­men not only found the best materials for the bubble (glass, 
high  strenght  steel  or  high  
strength  titanium),  but  also  
calculated  how  long  it would  

take the shell to sink to 35,000 feet if weights were added, and 
McComas described the intro­ductory, semester-long class as basically a computer program­ming course that uses engineer­ing problems and concepts as examples. Its goals, he said, are to teach computer programming as an integral part of engineer­ing; and to introduce some engineering insights so that freshmen may gain some flavor of the basic disciplines -civil, aerospace, metallurgical, chemi­cal, electrical and mechanical engineering. "The computer is a basic tool for engineers today," McComas said, "as basic as the slide rule used to be." 
During his sophomore, junior 
·and senior years, the engineering student finds the computer a necessary tool in tackling his homework. By the time the student graduates, McComas said, he should have no fear of programming. 
The College of Engineering has its own computer primarily for educating its students. The cated needs of faculty research. The students punch their own cards, feed the machine them­selves, and retrieve the results within half a minute. In fact, McComas smiled, the "no-wait" computer is a luxury they may not soon find in adult life. 
Freshmen in previous semes­ters have learned to calculate simple moon-shots, solve ele­mentary reactor problems, de­sign electrical networks, and find the natural frequency of oscilla­tion for a tall building.

The candidates hope to see a continuation of academic re­form. The Academic Commis­sioner will sit on the Student Assembly next year and this will increase communication be­tween the two branches. 
Greater involvement and more participation on any level, or in any way, not necessarily student government, are the goals of the candidates, in order to develop a community closely identified with the individual student.
