Martial law declared by SBP Kersten 
by Michael G. Baum 
In an arbitrary move last night, R. Calhoun Kersten, elect, announced that the Notre Dame campus was under martial law. 
Speaking from the Observer offices with a few close friends, and an "Influential Nonentity," Kersten mollified his statement with a few ex­planations. Due to his repeated inability to get a quarum of the Senate in any of the meetings he called, according to Kersten, the decision was made to declare martial law without the benefit of "Senatus Consultum." "I just want to get rid of any checks and balances on my awesome power." Kersten explained. 
He noted that the Senate "may have been intimidated "by the presence of the two gunsels he had brought along for moral support. He had no comment on the probable reaction of the Senate to his move beyond, "If they want to rubber-stamp it for me, that's okay, but they had their chance." 
Kersten then explained that the reason behind the move was to allow the "Oligarchy" to "write our own Constitution and pass it by referendum"

without Senate aid or obstruction. "We'd rather see it go through the students than the Senate," Kersten remarked. The referendum on the new 
eonstitution. once it is written, will be carried out in each hall section by the section leaders. 
The 'Influential Nonentity" elaborated on the plan. A Constitutional Committee well be con­vened in April. to report by May 11, the end of the 1\lartial Law period. "We want to get in (to the constituionl some sort of referendum," he said, including a body of section leaders, which they feel will be more responsive to students than the Senate.

Kersten explained that he had no plans as yet for the SLC elections. explaining. "My mother really makes all the important decisions in my life. and I haven't got a letter from her yet."

Nixon to request
~\lational Ne,Ns 
immediate halt on new busing 
WASHINGTON, March 16-­President Nixon said tonight that he would ask Congress for legislation that would call an immediate halt to all new busing
Page 3

Friday, March 17, 1972 orders by Federal Courts --a "moratorium", he said, on any new busing of schoolchildren for purposes of achieving racial balance. 
In a nationwide television and radio address, Nixon said he would also propose a companion measure, called the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1972, to improve the education of children from poor families. 
The President asserted that, when taken together, the two proposals "would focus our effort where they really belong --in better education for all of our children rather than on more busing for some of our children."

Sen. Robert P. Griffin. R-Mich., would, for example, have permanently denied all courts the power to bus children for purposes of racial balance. The President's brief address constituted only a summary of more detailed and comprehensive recommendations he will send to Congress tomorrow. He did not, for example, explain precisely what the word "moratorium" involved --whether, in other words, busing could be resumed in the future and when. He also said that the new Educational Opportunities

this, of course. 
A key element of the proposed Act, he said, would require every state or city to grant "equal educational opportunity" to all persons regardless of race or color. This was taken to mean that states would be required at least to "desegregate dollars" --that is, equalize per-pupil expenditures. 
After sketching the highlights of his long-awaited response to the public controversy over busing, the President spent most of the rest of his speech ex­plaining his opposition to "busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in our schools." 
The President's essential argument was that busing "is a bad means to a good end" because it disrupts established patterns of neighborhood schools--a concept in which he had said many times he believes. 
He also resisted the notion that all those who oppose busing are bigots. 
"There is no escaping the fact that some people oppose busing because of racial prejudice. But to go on from this to conclude that 'anti-busing' is simply a code word for prejudice is a vicious libel on millions of concerned parents who oppose busing not because they are against desegregation but because they are for better education for their children." 
As he has done in the past, Nixon devoted a section of his speech to letters he said he had received from parents across the nation. The thrust of these letters, he suggested, was that the majority of Americans do not wish their children "bused across a city to an in­ferior school just to meet some social planner's con­cept of what is considered to be the correct racial balance." 
The President's announcement came after weeks of Congressional stuggle over various proposals to restrict the capacity of the Courts to order busing to achieve school desegregation. 



Pompidou calls for Market referendum 
<cl 1!172 New York Times 
Paris. March 16--President Georges Pompidou unexpectedly announced today a popular referendum on the question of the entry of Britain, Ireland, Norway and Denmark into the Western European Common l\larket. 
In President's decision to bypass parliament for the ratification of the treaties signed with the four ap­plicants last January came as a surprise at the end of a long news conference on a wide range of domestic and foreign matters. 
Roth the President and those who heard him in the crowded, stuffy Salle Des Fetes of the Elysee Palace appeared confident that he would win his vote easily and thus enhance his position in Europe and in France. His aides said the vote would probably be held at the md of April or the beginning of !\lay. Since the French ah\·ays \·ote on a Sunday. either April 30 or May 7 was considered a likely date. 
This will be Pompidou's first use of a constitutional device to which his predecessors and political mentor Charles De Gaulle, resorted five times. Ironically, the President is using the referendum to push through a vital change in Western Europe that De Gaulle twice vetoes. The last referendum, in April, 1969, marked a defeat for De Gaulle and his subsequent resignation paved the way for the election of Pompidou. 
Pompidou said his "personal responsibility" was involved in the British entry, an event "that goes well beyond a simple widening of the common market." 
He declared "it is a new Europe that is being created and will assert itself and on which will depend the future of the European peoples and consequently of all theFrench in the political, economic, social and human fields."

You 

This is not the typical obscure artist's 
statement. My purpose here is much more 
mundane that that. It is, quite simply, PR. 
You is going to be in the Old Fieldhouse this 
weekend. And after reading a little about it, 
perhaps you will be there too. 
You is a theatre piece, twenty minutes 
from front to back, inside out, beginning to 
end. Although an elaborate projection and 
soun_d system synchronize the photography, 
music, and poetry, it is not a multi-media 
show, at least not in any McLuhanesque 
sense. You does not demonstrate media­
effects; it uses them. It does not relate the 
psychedelic experience. It's the pill. 
The sexual confrontations of a given 
conciousness comprise the scenario of the 
work. The sub-surface fabric is woven with 
threads of reality and illusion. You is the 
title, so pick a place in the scene that seems 
confortable and watch it become un­
bearable. It's all in your mind anyway.

Paris talks center on POW issue 
by John L. Hess 
(c) 1972 New York Times News Service 

Paris, March 16--The United States proposed to the Vietnamese Communists today that prisoner-of-war camps be opened to international inspection "in return for an undertaking by both sides to refrain from efforts to liberate prisoners from the locations visited." 
Without responding directly, the other side called the proposal an evasion of the fundamental issue. Nguyen Thanh Le. the North Vietnamese spokesman, said that if the Nixon administration agreed to the two main points of their peace plan, "all the American troops, prisoners or not, can certainly be back in the United States before Easter." 
Leaving the 146th session of the Paris conference, ambassador William J. Porter summarized it as "more of the same." 
It was the first full session since Feb. 10. after that meeting, Porter and Saigon's ambassador, Pham Dang Lam, then called off the next two meetings, citing the "climate" of an antiwar conference in Versailles. The communists walked out of the Feb. 24 session in protest at the escalation of American air raids on North Vietnam, and Porter and Lam cancelled the next two. 
Despite harsh mutual charges of violations of the agreement underlying the conference, both sides agreed to meet again next Thursday. It was the only point of accord. 
Porter raised the prisoner question in his opening remarks, reading President Nixon's proclamation of a National Week of Concern for Prisoners of War Missing in Action, beginning next week. 
Later the ambassador renewed a series of demands for treatment of prisoners in accord with the Geneva convention, including inspection by the International Hed Cross or another impartial party. He repeated that the prisoners could be seen elsewhere than in their camps, then added the new alternative, that both sides pledge to refrain from raiding camps so inspected. 
Stephen Ledogar, the American Press spokesr.:~an, explained to a sparsely attended news briefing that both sides had previously made rescue efforts, and that the communists had cited this problem in the past as a reason for refusing inspection. Today, the communists insisted that their prisoners were well-treated and would be sent home promptly if a peace agreement were reached. , 
With Xuan Thuy reported ill, Nguyen Minh Vy headed the Hanoi delegation. Le quoted him as describing Porter's proposal on prisoners as "a hypocritical maneuver that fizzled." 
"In the course of a private meeting we had with Mr. Kissinger in July, 1971," Le continued, "Mr. Kissinger declared this: 'Don't think we are negotiating with you to settle the war only because of the prisoners'--which shows that the Nixon administration doesn't care about the prisoners." 
Almost offhandedly. Le added that all Americans, including the prisoners. could be home by Easter if Washington agreed to the basic two points of the Communist Peace Plan. The first calls for withdrawal of American troops and war materials and the relase of prisoners. the second for the replacement of the Thieu regime in Saigon and negotiations toward a coalition government. 
The interval proposed for the prisoner release, less than 16 days. was by far the shortest yet specified at the conference. but Ledogar dismissed it as "the same sort 'Of thing we heard when Christmas was ap­proaching."

Editor: 
It is extremely reassuring to see Tom O'Mara, the epitome of the "Notre Dame man" (bright, athletically talented), look beyond the glitter of the golden dome and decide that there is indeed much more to life than what one finds at Notre Dame. Maybe his decision will shake our self-assured ad­ministration into making some serious reappraisals of the student experience at Notre Dame. 
Today's student (and student­athlete) needs more than a spoon­fed "Christian" education. He needs the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the making of decisions that ultimately affect iim, the chance to question and to experience a variety of stimuli and ways of thinking. 
The college years should be a time to grow; and if a student finds himself stagnating <and it's easy to do at Notre Darnel. he should go to a campus where life can be more meaningful and stimulating.Good luck at Berkeley Mr. O'Mara. You are the rare Notre Dame man who didn't get blinded by the glittering gold. Sincerely, David A. DeMuro 
... And Good Luck 
The following is an open letter tu Tom O'Mara. -ed. 
Dear Tom: Needless to say, I was quite surprised to read about your decision to transfer, but after a second and third reading of the article published in The Observer I would hope that these comments be somehow useful. For more people than you, Tom, Notre Dame is something less than an intellectual and academic oasis. May students here repeat, "just wait until I get out of here," as if they had been sentenced to four years at hard labor by a federal judge. That "let's get it over with" exists here at Notre Dame more than you '11 probably see anywhere else. I agree with you that living only for the future is very detrimental not only to the individual's present, but his friends as well. Is it right to just attend classes and take tests and make practice sessions'? And what about that disillusionment 
high-paying job to even think about a humaniustic personal growth. 
Life here at Notre Dame is not what we are led to believe. The conditions prevailing at visit-the ­Golden-Dome-time are make believe. The pressures put on an incoming Freshman is enough to send anyone to the men with the white suits. A troubled Freshman is told how glamourous his future will be if he only "sticks it out." Why isn't any of that mentioned to a prospective student'? Tom, your points are well taken--you are blessed with a courage to speak out and act as only few individuals are. 
Whether or not you will find reality at Berkeley I don't know. What you are looking for and the way you are looking for it should never be taken lightly. I hope that your life ends in this same search-­it is a quest well worth taking. 
Finally, I would like to thank you for your participation in Notre Dame this past season. It was a pleasure to watch you make the game of basketball look easy. I hope that other students will learn from your experiences--I know that I have. 
Very sincerely yours, 
Daniel Rock 330 Morrissey 
Hickey Doesn't Need Observer 
Editor: 

On March 8 you published a letter from your managing editor in which he supported my letter of March 6 where I implied that it is naive and farcical for Ann Therese Darin to go around calling Notre Dame and St. Mary-s students the "finest and smartest" Catholics in the country. 
It should be clear from previously published letters that I do not want, nor do I need, the OBSERVER's endorsements of my viewpoints. Furthermore, opinions of the editors should be "confined" to all the parts of the newspaper besidess the Letters to the Editor column. If the editors continue to pollute this column with garbage by writing letters to themselves, readers might get the mistaken notion that there are other idiots on campus besides the OBSERVER staff. 
Sincerely, John W.N. Hickey

Editor, The Sadness of Pragmatism: The Grass Speaks 
Many people believe that in the face of a pragmatic solution to a question they nave no free will, or rather that pragmatism is the ultimate value they must choose. Witness the grass. How many souls guiltily trample the grass and disfigure the campus thinking -I 
know I'm destroying the grass but I've got to do it because I'd be a fool to take the long way because it's slower and less efficient. This person is sad instide because he is not listening to the call of freedom within himself. He is denying his freedom, unless of course he absolutely bieves that in this case efficiency is better than beauty. e is dying inside and killing joy because he is suppressing the source of joy, living the truth in himself. 
Many of us never listen to our hearts. Instead, we believe in profit over mercy and justice, in pride over honesty and in pleasure over interior peace and self respect. Many believe that if there is a chance for them to sexually exploit someone without any fear of danger to self that they have to, that they have no choice ­otherwise they'd be fools because pleasure is better than interior peace. This person becomes very sad because he is strangling and suffocating the inner voice calling him to freedom. And the greatest affirmation one can make of 
Then you will be happy, not like the sad rich young man who chose wealth over Christ. And then you can see the grass as your sister as St. Francis would, and love. her for being herself before God. 
Sincerely, 
Thomas Uebbing 233 Farley

Happenings    
Don Luce to Speak 
The man who discovered the "Tiger Cages" in a South Viet­namese prison, Don Luce, will speak at the Unitarian Church in South Bend Saturday night at 8 o'clock. 
Luce, a 37 year-old agricultural economist. will also be bringing an exhibit on the peoples and cultures of Indochina. The exhibit will be on the campus of Indiana University at South Bend on Monday from 9 to 5. 
Luce has spent the last twelve years in Vietnam. Until 1967 he was Director of International Voluntary Services, a non-profit organization with international programs in agriculture and education. He has also been a researcher and journalist in Vietnam working under church sponsorship. 
An outspoken critic of the war, he was asked to leave the country by the Saigon Government i:1 May l!l71. 
lie has spoken and written ex­tensively on Vietnam, and has co­authored a book, Vietnam: The l 'nhtanl \'oicts. 
Heverand Scholefield of the 
Unitarian Church in South Bend 
commented that he "hopes for a 
good turnout from the students 
and faculty of Notre Dame. 
Catholic Schools in Trouble 
If present enrollment declines 
eontinue, the nation's nonpublic 
primary and secondary schools, of 
which ll:l per cent are Catholic, will 
lose more than half their current 
stud(nts by 1980, creating even 
greater financial problems for our 
largest cities. 
This is one conclusion of a 660­
page report. "Economic Problems 
of Nonpublic Schools," completed 
by the University of Notre Dame's 
Office of Educational Research 
(0f<:H l at the request of the 
President's Commission on School 
Finance. 
The report also noted that if the 
entire nonpublic system, which 
now enrolls some five million 
students. were to cease to exist, the 
additional educational costs to 
taxpayers would be $1.25 billion 
annually with seven of the nation's 
largest industrial states bearing 
almost three-fourths of the cost. 
Dr. !<'rank J. Fahey, director of 
o!<:H. Dr. Hichard H. Metzcus, 
assistant professor of education, 
and a staff of Notre Dame 
economists and reasearchers, did 
the t>ight-month study, which in­
dudes a careful analysis of 
pnrollmt'nt declines and nonpublic 
school dosings between 191i7 and 
1!l70. 
"Catholics generally perceive 
Catholic schools superior to public 
schools in terms of religious in­struction, and personal and social development," the researchers wrote. They see public schools superior in academic offerings, efficiency, practicality and con­venience." 
"As the Catholic population has outgrown its immigrant status it has prospered," the survey con­tinues. "In fact, Catholics are curretnly 'out-achieving' Protestants in terms of education, occupation and income. Young, educated, at least middle-income, suburban Catholics aspire to a quality education for their children. Quality for these Catholics who are beyond the urban area is found in public schools." 
The Notre Dame research team 
noted that costs inherited by public 
school systems where nonpublic 
schools cease to exist would be 
centered mainly in the large in­
dustrial states of New York, 
Illinois. Michigan, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Ohio and California. 
More than 73 per cent of the $1.2 
billion cost would be borne by 
taxpayers in these states. Over the 
nation the financially pressed 
cities would be asked to absorb 59 
per cent of the transfer costs; 
suburbs. 23 percent, and rural 
areas. 17 per cent. 

Cavanaugh Elections 
Cavanaugh Hall elections held 
yesterday resulted in run-offs in 
the presidential and 
vice-presidential races and clear­
cut victories for Kevin Casey and 
Joe Wilkowski in the Treasurer 
and Secretary contests. 
In the presidential election, Paul Sponsored Tobin polled 79 votes to Denny Endowment for

Mike Cavanaugh's 66 votes pushed him to a good margin over second place finisher Steve DeCourcey But DeCourcey polled 44 votes, enough to cause a run-off. 
Casey pulled 105 of a possible 182 votes to lead him to his victory over Gary Dadaian. Wilkowski, a sophomore from Detroit, received a mandate from the Cavanaugh !!all populace with 143 votes to Nelson Smith's 33.

Courturier will discuss the social aspects of life in France­government in social life, education, crime, and the political system. 
Program Producer Jim 0 'Sullivan commented that "the nature of interface between the 
foreign student and his American 
host is directly related to the ex­
tent with which the native 
American is familiar with the 
student's country." 

Humanities Conference 
Notre Dame will host a planning 
conference sponsored by the 
Indiana Committee for the 
Humanities. Delegates from 
several cities in the northern area

the Notre Dame program is designed to build a framework where academic humanists are brought into discussions of current problems involving the general public. Dr. Robert E. Burns, associate professor of history, will serve as chairman of the con­ference. 
ObJectives of the state-based program include the development of a formal or informal structure capable of defining a broadly-based public program m the humanities and of regranting funds to implement the program. Also. to bring academic humanists into meaningful dialogue with the general adult public on real problems of contemporary public concern. and to create new human and financial resources for public activities in the humanities through wide involvement of state and community organizations and institutions in their support.

Winning is ND netmen' s racket 
by Eric Kinkopf 
The "Tiger" is back, and he and his kids are roarin' and ready to go, as the Notre Dame tennis team opens its 1972 season this weekend as the hosts of the second annual Irish Invitational Tournament. 
The "Tiger" is head coach Tom Fallon, and his kids are a gaggle of raw potential and polished skill, headed by seniors Buster Brown, John Allare, and Mike Reilly. 
Coming off a lofty mark of 26-5 in 1971, including the Central Collegiate crown, and returning five of six starting singles players, the Irish racgueteers are looking forward to a duplicate per­fo~mance of last year this spring, with perhaps a few changes-like reversing those five losses. 
The ND netmen are led by senior co-captain Buster Brown, a blond­headed whip-lash from Florida. Buster will be making it three years in a row at the top spot this season, and is coming off a junior year in which he posted a 21-9 mark against the toughest collegiate players in the country. 
The number two seed has gone to 
lefty John Allare, who will have a 
heavy gep to fill, left by the 
graduation of last year's captain, 
steady Bernie LeSage. Allare 
compiled a 26-4 record playing in 
the number three spot last year. 
Allare will also be teaming up 
with Brown as the number one ND 
doubles duo. The Brown-Allare 
combo netted a 19-5 doubles mark 
last year. 
Another southpaw, Mike "Riles" 
Reilly will be competing for the 
number two spot with Allare, 
although Mike will be spotted third 
for the Saturday Invitational. 
Reilly, in control and at times 
out of control of one of the most 
blistering serves in the college 
ranks, ended up with a 15-14ledger 
while playing in the number two 
spot last year. 
Right now it looks as though 
Brandon Walsh will be filling in at 
the number four position. The 
heady soph from Jamaica, 
currently the top-ranked player in 
his native country, is expected to 
handle opposing number four men 
with ease. 
Hob Schefter. a junior who 
lettered at the number six position 
last spring has been moved up in 
the line-up to the fifth spot. 
Schefter compiled a 20-9 mark last 
season as the ND anchorman. 
The battle for the last spot in the 
Irish starting six has been tem­
porarily won by freshman and 
native Californian Chris Kane. 
The frosh prospect, listed among 
the top five nationally in junior 
doubles last year, rates a shade 
ahead of another freshman, John 
Carrico. in coach Fallon's weekly 
rankings. 
Carrico. from Lake Forest, 
Illinois is momentarily down, but 
definitely not out of the overall 
plans of coach Fallon. 
The 1972 tennis team can also 
boast of good overall depth, having 
both last year's top junior varsity 
player. Dick Murray, and senior 
Greg Heid waiting in the wings. 
Last year. the racqueteers en­
joyed a very good season, and 
coach Fallon sees no reason why 
things should be any different this 
year. 
"Last year we had a good 
season. and this year we should be 
a little bit better. We have three seniors starting, and they should week long trip to Mexico City t0 be improved over last season. And compete with the top collegiale we have a couple freshmen that and amateur netmen in Mexico look pretty fair. We should be at After the Easter fiesta south of least as good as last year, and the border, the team will return t0 hopefully better." the Convo and ready themselves 
The Irish begin their '72 slate for the steady onslaught of Big Ten this Saturday, entertaining Purdue teams, and the more traditionaI '"lrl ne Paul before leaving for a Irish opponents. 
Fencers host Wayne State 
by Joe Wilkowski Four years ago, the Irish fresh­man fencing team was just like ~ny ?ther, very little fencing talent m fair to good high school athletes. That team has blossomed into one of the best senior classes at du Lac, and that senior class is planning to end their varsity careers with a flourish against unbeaten Wayne State University here at Notre Dame. Six starters lead the list of four­year men, and much of the depth that has marked Notre Dame fencing is also due to seniors. Ron Sollitto, Matt Fruzynski and Joe Pauwels, in sabre, Tim Taylor and Chuck Harkness in epee and foilman Warren Yau hav~ con­tributed greatly to the team's success in starting roles throughout the year. In addition North Carey (17-5) in epee and Jim Froes s, (12-4), in foil, 'have provided needed depth and in­centive for ths starting three in their weapons. _Sollitto and Fruzynski have been ripping their sabre opponents at a record pace, and their efforts give them a good chance to break Doug Daher's mark for victories in a season. They have provided the best 1-2 punch in Irish fencing 
history,  with  79  wins  between  
them.  
In  addition  to  a  40-5  season  

Sollitto has placed sixth in th~ Great Lakes Tournament and earned a place in the NCAA championships. Fruzynski has rolled up a 39-6 record, good enough to place him second on the 


Ruggers host Wolverines 
Notre Dame's A and B rugby teams will be hosting the Wolverines of the University of Michigan today at 2:00 P.M. behind Stepan Center. 
The Michigan club, composed mostly of graduate students, is always a potent threat and is sure to be some of the toughest com­petition the Irish ruggers will see this season. 

all-time sabre list, but his true worth. has been in a teaching capacity. He has been in­strumental in the development of 
the younger fencers, notably next year's captain, Dan Mulligan. Pauwels has had a good year as the 
third sabreman. He hasn't fenced much of late in order that the underclassmen earn some meet experience, but his 12-12 record speaks well of the contribution that 
he has made to the team. 
Taylor and Harkness have provided steady leadership and consistent performance for the epee team all season. Harkness has fenced to a 32-8 record, and his stellar performance in the Great Lakes tournament. going 14-3 against the best in the midwest earned for him a third-place and the right to seek further honors at the NCAA's. He has moved up to the fifth position on the all-time epee list, and has also moved into the top ten of all-time Irish fencers. 
Taylor, fencing at a 32-8 clip and also serving a freshman fencing coach, has been a tremendous asset to the team this year. He ends his fencing career with 69 victories and only 26 defeats. 
Yau has fenced well all year in foil, racking up an 18-13 win slate. He has been one of the most ex­citing fencers here at Notre Dame utilizing his quickness t~ penetrate an opponent's defense. 
The fencers are going to have a tough match for their going away present. Wayne State University has a great claim to Midwest supremacy. It gave the University of Detroit its only defeat and placed second in the Great Lakes tournament 18 points in front of the Irish. They feature two out­standing performers in Pete Milazzo, an all-American in foil and thidr-place finisher in the Great Lakes tourney. And Steve Danosi, the 19-and-under cham­pion of the United States in sabre. Steve also finished first at Great Lakes in his weapon. 
Notre Dame will try to spoil the Tartan's perfect record Saturday at 1:30 in the auxiliary gym of the ACC.
