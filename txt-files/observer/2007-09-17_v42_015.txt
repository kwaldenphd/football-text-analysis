Ordinance undergoes drastic changes 
Student body president Brown expects South Bend Common Council to pass party resolution tonight 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 

Major changes have been made to the ordinance proposed by the South Bend Common Council to control student par­ties, said student body president Liz Brown, who expects that Council members will approve the ordinance at their meeting tonight. 
The biggest modification is that the ordinance will not require rnsidents of boarding houses ­defined as houses where more than two unrelated people live ­to register for a permit from the city before holding a gathering at which more than 25 people would have access to alcohol. 
"Although the bill contains all the permit 
and regis­tration lan­guage for social gath­erings, it also stipu­lates that such a pro­gram will 

not be Luecke enacted unless a subsequent ordinance is passed by the Common Council, which would require another set of public hearings," Brown said. 
The new ordinance will also establish a community coalition composed of members of the Notre Dame and South Bend communities. 
"We think it makes sense to bring together city officials and University officials and students and residents to discuss, not just student parties, but neighbor­hood watches ... and anything that might come up," Brown said. 
She said the language regard­ing the coalition was still in the process of being finalized Sunda~ The South Bend Community Relations meets Monday evening and will be fol­lowed by a public hearing at 6 
p.m. to discuss the ordinance. 
The newly drafted ordinance, Brown said, directs the Common Council to evaluate how well the coalition and other efforts to address the issue of disruptive student partying work -and if they do not work well, the option to revisit the registration process is still "on the table." 
''I'm happy with the way this has turned out," Brown said. 
Brown, along with student body vice president Maris Braun, was first alerted to the proposed

Gerard Powers, director of policy studies at the Kroc Institute, com­mended two visiting general<; who spoke at the "What is War?'' con­ference this weekend because, Powers said, "you can't talk about war and peace without under­standing the situation on the ground." 
The conference, hosted by the Kroe Institute Friday and Saturday, IP.aturod speeches by scholars, mili­tary personnel and war correspon­dents. It was held to help the International Law Association for­mulate a more precise and modem definition of war, which i.<; "central to protecting fundamental human rights that can be legally suspend­ed during formal wartime," aecording to a press release by the Kroc Institute previewing the event. 
Two former commanders of U.S. and British forces in Bosnia com­posed the military panel, which filled an auditorium well beyond capacity. U.S. Gen. William Nash and British Gen. Michael Rose focused on how international law and morality affected war policy. 
According to Rose, obeying the rules of war was an important way to mobilize public support. Violations, he said, undermined the mission, promoting the forces of civilization. Nations that lose the moral high ground "don't have a

Students, temn suffer third loss 
Campus attitude grim after Michigan defeat 
By MARCELA BERRIOS and 
KAREN LANGLEY 
News Writers 
With the realized fear of an 0-3 record to kick off the year, saying students are disappoint­ed, frustrated and pessimistic about the rest of the football season would be an understate­ment. 
"We sucked," sophomore Steven Mazer said about Notre Dame's 38-0 loss to Michigan Saturday. "I have some friends coming this weekend for Michigan State. We're going to get killed." 
And he wasn't alone in his gloomy forecast. 
Many students said they were embarrassed by the crushing defeat at Ann Arbor, and they don't expect the first post­Brady Quinn season to get bet­ter. But at a school where tra­ditionally, the fall semester equals the football semester, they said they're still planning to attend the remaining games. 
"The score isn't the impor­tant thing. It's the atmosphere," freshman Natalie Parra said. "Even when we're losing, it's a great atmosphere." 
But some upperclassmen think it's easier to stay as posi­tive as Parra when there are still three years of football ahead.

Int.'l enrollment at 10-yearlowfor SMC 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Saint Mary's is furthering its recruitment of international prospects as its enrollment of such students hit a 1 0-year low this semester. 
The College has only eight international students this year, including two freshmen. Saint Mary's is striving to increase its international student population to three percent by the 2012, vice president of enrollment management Dan Meyer said. The eight students compose less than one percent of the student body. 
The College utilizes a number of electronic resources to target potential students abroad. While no one from the admissions office has traveled international­ly for a number of years, the office does have a number of contacts in other countries. 
"We seek names from high school counselors who are a good source for international students participating in study abroad [and] exchange pro­grams," Meyer said. 
The office also contacts alum­nae who are living in other countries and asks them to help with recruiting.

Firefighters save donkey trapped in well 
UNOEHWOOO, Minn. ­!\ donkey is happily eating grass again after falling down a dry, abandoned well and being freed in an intensive rescue effort. It appeared that the animal wandered away from its farm and onto some boards covering the well, which broke, said Bruce Huseth, fire chief in this western Minnesota town. 
Firelighters quickly real­ized that the animal, which belongs to farmer Warren Gundberg, could­n't just be pulled from the abandoned well on Bryan Nelson's land. 
So they started pulling away earth with a tractor and dismantling the well block by block Thursday. Once one wall had been taken apart, f'iref'ighters put a harness around the donkey and guided it out with a rope. 
"Whatever it takes," Nelson said as he watched his well come down. "I love animals, and I'm just glad it's OK." 
College student leader charged wth DUI 
BLOOMSBUHG, Pa. -Bloomsburg University's student government presi­dent was charged with drunken driving just weeks after saying the media has unfairly por­trayed students as irre­sponsible. 
Christopher Bevan, 21, was pulled over last week­end after a campus police officer said he saw the stu­dent driving more than 50 mph in a 15-mph zone. 
A breath test showed Bevan's blood-aleohol level was .147 percent, authori­ties said. The legal limit for drivers in Pennsylvania is .08 percent.

'Til probably end up regret­ting having spent money on another defeat," she said. 
Senior Camila Bernal, who drove to Michigan this week­end, said she paid $80 for tickets, while scalpers at Ann Arbor were selling for $25 Saturday -and she felt slightly cheated.

Sophomore Dan Dixon said he was also hesitant about going to an away game this season in light of Notre Dame's recent performances. 
"We were thinking about going to Purdue, but with the way the team's been playing, it might not happen," Dixon said. 
But while his enthusiasm about Notre Dame football is dwindling, Dixon said his friends from rival colleges are still excited about coming to a game. 
"I've got friends from Boston College. They think they're going to win, so of course they'll come," he said.

however, may actually be deterred from journeying to South Bend unless it's to see Notre Dame win. 
Saint Mary's freshman Claire Yancy said she had planned to have guests dur­ing a home game this season, but the team's losing streak has affected their excitement about the trip. 
"I have a couple people coming to visit. I don't think they want to pay [for football tickets] anymore," Yancy said. "They keep watching Notre Dame play, and they feel sad -but they still want to come. It's the experience." 
And that half-heartedness may be the tone of the sea­son. 
"My uncle is coming in from Ohio for Michigan State. We're not really expecting anything from the game itself, but the tailgating should be fun," sophomore John Maltese said. 
A few students, however, remained steadfast in their support of the team. 
"The biggest thing we need to do as fans Saturday against Michigan State is -no mat­ter the score -to give our 110 percent and let the team know how much we care," freshman Sean McCullough said. "For the first game I came fully dressed as a lep­rechaun and I intend to do that at each home game. We could be 0-8 and I'll still dress the same way."

Court exposes plans to destroy Sears Tow-er 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -To hear prosecutors tell it, Narseal Batiste and six followers formed a budding homegrown ter­rorist cell determined to rival the Sept. 11 attacks by toppling the Sears Tower in Chicago. 
In the same court building where Jose Padilla was convicted last month, trial begins this week for seven men who federal prosecutors say envisioned a "full ground war" that would eventually replace the 
U.S. government with an Islamic regime. 
"I want to fight some jihad," Batiste said in a 2006 conversation tap~d by the FBI. "That's all I live for. 
Defense lawyers and supporters of the so-called "Liberty City Seven" say the men never sought to hurt anyone and amassed only one gun and a few knives and machetes. They say the alleged terror conspir­acy was driven by a pair of paid FBI informants -one claiming to be an al-Qaida emissary. 
"These guys never left the United States. They never traveled to the Middle East," said Albert Levin, attorney for defendant Patrick Abraham. "They never had any way of carrying out what was dis­cussed. Thi<; was pure words." 
Batiste, the leader of an obscure religious sect, and the others from Miami's blighted Liberty City neigh­borhood each face decades in prison if convicted. The four-count indictment includes charges of con­spiracy to levy war against the United States and conspiracy to provide material support to al­Qaida. 
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday and take one to two weeks. The main prosecution case is expected to last at least six weeks. 
The trial will be held before U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard, one floor above the courtroom where a jury in August convicted Padilla, the former enemy combatant, and two other men on murder conspiracy and terror support charges. 
The trial promises to test anew the Bush administration's post­Sept. 11 strategy of disrupting potential terrorists in the earliest possible stages. When it comes to terror cases, federal officials say, arrests can't wait until the prover­bial fuse is lit.

Sectarian violence prompts arrest 
BAGHDAD-The U.S. military on Sunday announced the arrest of a suspect in the killing of a sheik who spearheaded the U.S.-backed Sunni revolt against al-Qaida in Iraq, even as the terror network launched a campaign of violence during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. 
Dozens of suspected Sunni insurgents raided Shiite villages north of Baghdad, killing at least 15 people and setting homes ablaze, police said. A bicycle bomb exploded at a cafe serving tea and food during the Ramadan fast in northern Iraq. 
The surge of bloodshed-with 54 people killed or found dead nationwide -occurred a day after al-Qaida announced a new campaign aimed at countering U.S. and Iraqi claims the terror move­ment is reeling following the U.S.-led offensives around the Iraqi capital. 
Greece elects new prime minister 
ATHENS -Conservative Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis declared victory in Greece's parliamentary election Sunday, although official results showed he would have a slimmer major­ity in parliament. 
Karamanlis overcame widespread anger and accusations of incompetence following devastat­ing forest fires that killed more than 65 people last month, and a challenge from a split in the right-wing vote to win a second four-year term. 
'Thank you for your trust. You have spoken loud and clear and chosen the course the coun­try will take in the next few years," Karamanlis said as thousands of party supporters thronged the streets of central Athens.

Clark endorses Clinton campaign 
NEW YORK -Democrat Hillary,Rodham Clinton was endorsed Saturday by retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who sought the party's nomination in 2004 and whose sterling military credentials could bolster her bid to be the first female commander in chief. 
Clark, the former supreme allied com­mander of NATO, praised the New York senator as "a remarkable person" with the skills and experience to be president. 
"She will be a great leader for the United States of America and a great commander in chief for the men and women in uni­form," Clark told reporters in a conference call with the former first lady. 
Clinton welcomed Clark's endorsement as a "real sign of confidence" in her ability to lead the military as president. "He and I have been friends for 25 years, and I am deeply admiring of his leadership," she said.

Bond was set Saturday for Alba Bello; her boyfriend, Lazaro Guardiola; and her son, Alain Gonzalez, who are charged with accessory after the fact, said Janelle Hall, a jail spokeswoman. 
The judge mandated that the three give an account of where their bond money would come from, Hall said. All three remained in jail.

Bush selects new attorney general 
Retired federal judge Michael Mukasey is called upon to replace Alberto Gonzales 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON President Bush has settled on Michael B. Mukasey, a retired federal judge from New York, to replace Alberto Gonzales as attor­ney general and will announce his selection Monday, a source familiar with the president's deci­sion said Sunday evening. 
Mukasey, who has han­dled terrorist cases in the 
U.S. 
legal system for more than a decade, would become the nation's top law enforcement officer. 

The 66-year-old New York native, who is a legal adviser to GOP presiden­tial hopeful Rudy Giuliani, would take charge of a Justice Department where morale is low following months of investigations into the firings of nine

IN BRIEF 
Stocks fall due to poor retail sales 
NEW YORK-U.S. stocks fell Friday after the government reported August retail sales excluding autos fell sharply, suggesting that consumers held off spending in the face of turmoil in the financial markets. Bond prices jumped. 
Also pressuring stocks was news that the Bank of England approved emergency fund­ing for lender Northern Rock PLC to head off a possible liquidity crisis. Northern Rock issued a profit warning and blamed the shortfall on credit market turmoil. 
In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.24, or 0.40 per­cent, to 13,371.64. 
Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 6.55, or 
0.44 percent, to 1,477.40, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 11.7 4, or 0.45 percent, to 2,589.32. 
Bonds rose, with the yield on the bench­mark 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.41 percent from 4.48 percent late Thursday. 
Gold remains steady on the week 
NEW YORK -Gold prices ended essen­tially flat Friday, reversing an early rally, as investors made cautious bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. 
It was a quiet finish to a volatile week in which gold hit its highest level in more than a year and the U.S. dollar sank to a 15-year low on expectations the central bank will trim the federal funds rate on Tuesday. Some investors turned to gold to hedge against inflation. 
In other commodities markets, oil prices fell from the $80-a-barrel mark and gasoline prices eased, while industri­al metals finished the session mixed. Agriculture futures rose broadly. 
Still, Friday's weak figures further solidified expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates. For many investors, the question has shifted from whether the Fed will cut rates to by how much. But nothing is guaranteed and trading remains jittery in many markets.

Bloomberg builds up philanthropy 
Billionaire mayor will disclose $165 million in charitable giving in 2006 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to run for presi­dent in 2008, it is clear he is serious about building up his philanthropic giv­ing. 
The billionaire mayor is expected to disclose short­ly that he gave $165 mil­lion to more than 1,000 charities in 2006, and is forming an organization called Bloomberg Philanthropies that will organize all of his giving: his personal one-time con­tributions, his company's donations and the projects undertaken by the new foundation. 
He recently purchased two buildings near his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side to use as the headquarters and has begun to assemble a staff that is sketching out some of the foundation's first projects. He is even recre­ating another Bloomberg bullpen there -his trade­mark office arrangement that has everyone sitting together with no walls. 
Despite the speculation that Bloomberg will dip into his fortune to bankroll a presidential run, the bil­lionaire insists that when he leaves City Hall at the end of 2009, he will take a vacation and then focus on giving his money away. 

But if he were to run for president while also oper­ating a foundation, it would be a historic moment in the philan­thropic world and likely a tricky road to navigate. 
"It has never happened before -people who are affiuent do run for presi­dent, but nobody who's had such a major role in philanthropy," said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. "Foundations are really not allowed to be involved in politics at all, so he would have to be extra careful so that one world doesn't mess with the other." 
Palmer said the fact that Bloomberg is creating an official foundation is a sig­nal "that even though he's been giving generously, he is going to ratchet up his giving and needs some­thing more formal. 
"He's already supporting a huge number of chari­ties, but this is probably a sign that he needs more professional advisers and may be thinking about something more ambi­tious," she said. 
Estimates of Bloomberg's wealth range from $5.5 billion to more than $13 billion, and his riches would multiply if he sold the financial information company he founded in the early 1980s. He said last year he had decided not to sell at that time. But he had previously indicated that establishing his foun­dation would probably involve selling the compa­ny. 
Bloomberg has been giv­ing his money away for many years. Since he has been in office, his staff has released annual lists of where his money goes and the total amount. 
Every year, he is giving more money to more groups. In 2005, he gave $144 million to 987 organ­izations, compared with $139 million to 843 groups in 2004 and $136 million to 653 charities in 2003. 
Evista approved for breast cancer use 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly and Co. can sell its osteoporosis drug Evista to doctors as a two-for-one treat­ment that also prevents breast can­cer. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Evista as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer for some women, Lilly announced Friday. 
Evista rang up slightly more than $1 billion in sales last year as Lilly's fifth best-selling drug. Analysts say the newly approved use should bump future sales. 
"This isn't going to be a windfall indication, but we expect this will help to modestly grow Evista sales," said Brandon Troegle, who covers Lilly for Morningstar. 
Lilly introduced Evista in 1998 for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the disease of pro­gressive bone loss. But it also has been testing the drug as a cancer preventer for 10 years. The compa­ny applied for the new use after conducting studies on about 37,000 postmenopausal women, spokes­woman Sharon Corbitt said. 
The FDA approval means Lilly can market it as a once-daily pill to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and those at high risk for the aggressive cancer. The drug doesn't treat existing cancer. 
Doctors could have prescribed the drug as a preventive measure before the FDA approval, but Lilly couldn't market it that way. Analysts say they're not sure how many new patients the drug will attract. 
Roughly 180,000 women are diagnosed with invasive breast can­cer each year, according to the American Cancer Society. 
Lehman Brothers analyst Tony Butler said he doesn't think Evista will draw many new patients who don't have osteoporosis already. He believes a small pool of doctors already use the drug in its cancer­preventing role. 
"I think it's hard to say you might be at risk for breast cancer, take this," he said. "I think it's easier to say you need this for osteoporosii? and you've got a history of breast cancer." 
Evista's sales grew only 1 percent in 2006 and in the second quarter of this year. Troegle believes it might see as much as 10 percent growth in 2008, thanks in part to the new use. 
"It gives them a competitive advantage in a field that's going to be increasingly competitive," Tooley said.

Associated l'ress 
LAS VEGAS-O.J. Simpson 
was arrested Sunday and faces 
multiple felony charges in an 
alleged armed robbery of collec­
tors involving the former football 
great's sports memorabilia, 
authorities said. 
Prosecutors were planning to 
charge Simpson with two counts 
of robbery with use of a deadly 
weapon, conspiracy to commit 
robbery. burglary with a deadly 
weapon, two counts of assault 
with a dnadly weapon and coer­
cion, said Clark County District 
Attorney David Hoger. 
A conviction on the most seri­
ous charge, robbery with use of a 
deadly weapon, could bring a 
sentence of thrne to 35 years f(Jr 
each count, he said. 
"lie is f'aeing a lot of time," 
Hoger said. 
Simpson was transferred to a 
detention center for booking 
Sunday evening, Dillon said. 
Dillon said he did not know 
whether Simpson would be able 
to post bail and be released 
Sunday. 
"lie was very cooperative, 
there were no issues," Dillon 
said. 
At least 1me other person has 
been arrested and police said 
Sunday that they were searching 
lor f(mr others in connection with 
the allegnd armed robbery that 
occurred in a room inside the 
Palace Station casino-hotel on 
Thursday. 
Police Lt. Clint Nichols said 
Simpson invoknd his right to an 
attornny immediately after being 
arrested. 
Simpson, 60, has said he and othnr people with him were retrieving items that belonged to him. Simpson has said there wnrn no guns involved and that he went to the room at the casino only to get stolen mementos that induded his llall of Fame certifi­cate and a pkturn of the running back with J. Edgar Hoover. 
Simpson told The Associated Press on Saturday that he did not call thn police to help redaim the items because he has found the police unresponsive to him ever since his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Hon (;oldman, were killed in 1994. 
"The policn, since my trouble, havn not worked out for me," he said. noting that whenever he has called the police "It just bneomes a story about O.J." 
The fleisman Trophy winner, ex-NFJ. star and actor lives ncar Miami and has been a tabloid staple since his ex-wife and c;oldman were killed in 1994. Simpson was acquitted of mur­der charges, but a jury later held him liable for the killings in a wrongful death lawsuit.

Coastal crash kills 87, cause still uncertain 
One-Two-Go Airlines plarie skids off rainy runway in Phuket with 130 people onboard 
Associated· Press 
PIIUKET -A passenger plane filled with foreign tourists crashed Sunday as it tried to land in pouring rain on the island of Phuket, splitting in two and bursting into flames, offi­eials said. At least 87 peo­ple were killed. 
The budget One-Two-Go Airlines domestic flight OG269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members from the capital, Bangkok to Phuket -popu­lar among tourists for its pristine beaehes and one of the areas hardest hit by the 2004 tsunami. 
Survivors described their 

escape from the airplane's windows as fires and smoke consumed the plane. 
"I saw passengers engulfed in fire as I stepped over them on way out of the plane," Parinwit Chusaeng, a survivor who suffered minor burns, told the Nation television channel. "I was afraid that the airplane was going to explode so I ran away." 
Wallop Thainua, the coun­try's deputy health minister, said he received a report that 87 people were killed in the crash, many of their bodies laid out in an airport building. 
Officials at the scene said the McDonnell Douglas MD­
82 crashed in a downpour, skidded off the runaway and broke in two. 
Officials said it was too early to establish the cause of the crash, but some said weather was likely a factor. 
"The visibility was poor as the pilot attempted to land. He decided to make a go­around but the plane lost balance and crashed," said Chaisak Angsuwan, director general of the Air Transport Authority of Thailand. "It was torn into two parts." 
Local television reports showed parts of the twisted and smoking wreckage sit­ting off to the side of the runaway. Masked rescue workers converged on the 
plane, carrying away bodies wrapped in white sheets. 
Lt. Gen. Amporn Charuchinda, chief of the police forensic bureau, said that the authorities might move some of the dead bod­ies to a mortuary in Phang Nga province where some of the tsunami victims were kept. Some 8,000 people were killed in Phuket in the 2004 disaster. 
Sunday's crash is the country's deadliest aviation accident since Dec. 11, 1998, when 101 people were in the crash of Thai Airways plane at Surat Thani, 330 miles south of Bangkok. Forty-five people survived.

ISRAEL 
Rice's arrival preetnpted by Israeli-Palestinian discord 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM Prime Minister Ehud Olmert indi­cated on Sunday that there would be no major break­throughs in peacemaking ahead of a U.S.-sponsored peace conference this fall, prompting a Palestinian threat to skip the gathering. 
The crisis erupted just days before the arrival of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is 
expected in the region Tuesday to gauge progress on preparations for the confer­ence. U.S. officials have said little about the meeting's agenda, and the list of par­ticipants has not been set. 
At a meeting of his Kadima Party, Olmert dismissed recent reports that he and Abbas had agreed on binding principles to guide peace talks, officials said. Instead, he said he and the Palestinian leader would go no further than a non-bind­ing declaration of intent. 
"There is a difference between an agreement on principles and a declaration of intent," a participant in the meeting cited Olmert as saying, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed. 
Without the outlines of a final peace deal, the Palestinians say, the confer­ence will be a failure. 
"If Olmert says there'll just

be a declaration, it's not worth going to this meeting," said Nimr Hamad, an adviser to Abbas. 
Peace talks have snagged in the past over three key issues _ final borders, control over disputed Jerusalem and a solution for millions of Palestinian refugees. 
Olmert and Abbas have broached these topics in recent talks, but the Palestinians have been press­ing for greater Israeli com­mitment ahead of a. confer­ence. 
After years of deadlock, peace efforts have gained momentum following the Hamas group's violent takeover of the Gaza Strip and Abbas' subsequent expulsion of the Islamic group from government. With Barnas out of the govern­ment, Western powers hope the moderate Abbas will have a freer hand to negotiate with Israel. 
But analysts question whether he or Olmert is 
strong enough politically to 
make the concessions that 
would be needed for agree­
ments on the explosive issues 
that divide the two sides. 

At their latest meeting last 
week, Olmert offered some 
gestures meant to bolster 
Abbas in his power struggle 
with Barnas, like proposing 
to release an unspecified 
number of Palestinian pris­
oners during the current 
Muslim holy month of 
Ramadan. 

Israel holds about 11,000 .Palestinian prisoners, and 
their fate is an emotional 
issue in Palestinian society. 
Olmert and Abbas are 
scheduled to meet every two 
weeks leading up to the 
November meeting. 

In Gaza, meanwhile, a 
spokesman for Gaza's Barnas 
rulers, Taber Nunu, said the 
Islamic militant group had 
"renewed" its commitment to 
a mutual truce with Israel, 
which has broken down amid 
Palestinian rocket attacks 
and Israeli retaliation.

Litvimmko, who became a vocal Kremlin critic and sought asylum in Britain, died Nov. 23 in a London hospital after ingesting radioactive polonium-210. On his deathbed, he accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind his poisoning ­charges the Kremlin has fiercely denied. 
Britain has identified Lugovoi as the main suspect in the death and and demand­ed his extradition. Russia has rejected the demand, saying its constitution forbids it, and Putin has called the demands a vestige of British "colonial thinking." 
Lugovoi has dismissed the accusations and accused British authorities of hurting his business interests. 
"I was a businessman, but no longer, thanks to the dis­gusting policy of British pros­ecutors which led to this political hysteria," Lugovoi told Russia Today. "With the situation being highly politi­cized by British opponents, I find myself in the midst of a political wave of interest in me." 
Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant politician who heeds the Kremlin's orders, said his party congress would confirm Lugovoi's position on the party list on Monday. He dis­missed British charges against Lugovoi as "an attempt to organize provoca­tions against our citizens," the Interfax news agency reported. 
Tensions over the Litvinenko case have badly hurt the bilateral ties, and the two nations recently have announced tit-for tat diplomat expulsions.

FBI pushed plea deal, lavvyer says 
Agents deny any wrongdoing in federal corruption investigation 
Associated Press 
ANCIIOHAGE -The Justice 
D1~partment inappropriately 
prnssured a former state law­
maker to consider pleading 
guilty in a corruption case, 
according to his lawyer, who 
wants a federal judge to review 
the agency's aetions. 
The claim is surfacing in a bribery investigation that has now stretched to Capitol Hill, where Sen. Ted Stevens and Hop. Don Young, both from Alaska, arn under scrutiny. 
A lawyer for former state Hep. Vie Kohring said the FBI recent­ly used anotlwr state lawmaker, who was cooperating with investigators, to press Kohring to take a plea deal. 
Investigators normally are prohibited from contacting defendants once they have a lawyer. 
Kohring has pleaded not guilty to bribery and extortion charges despite what dnfense lawyer John llenry Browne eont1~nded was persistent pressure from the .Justice Department to change the plea. 
That pressure culminated nH:nntly, Browne said, when Kohring's former aide reeeived a call from an aide in state Snn. Fred Dyson's office. The mes­sage, Browne said, was to take a plea deal. 
It was only last week that Browne learned Dyson had been working with investigators sinee 2006. Details about the coopera­tion emergod in a rolated trial and showed that Dyson helped prosecutors persuade oil con­tractor Bill Allen to cooperate in the overarehing investigation. 
Allen, the founder of the polit­ically powerful oil services com­pany VECO Corp., became a key witness against Kohring and other lawmakers and has pro­vided investiga­tors information denied making the overture at the government's prompting. But he again encouraged Kohring to consider a deal. 
"My sense of the FBI investi­gations is that it is not a witch hunt and that they mostly want to nail the really bad guys," Dyson wrote in an e-mail to Kohring's lawyers, who provid­ed the message to The 
Associated Press. 
Dyson wrote

Browne planned to raise the issue in court Monday during a pretrial hearing. If he persuades a judge that Dyson initiated the contact at the government's behest, it could sink the govern­ment's ease against Kohring. 
A telephone message left at Dyson's home was not immedi­ately returned Sunday. When Kohring's lawyers questioned Dyson about his FBI eontaets in an e-mail last month, Dyson

VECO also helped organize fundraisers for Young, who has come under scrutiny in the investigation. 
Prosecutors have asked whether Kohring has any infor­mation about Stevens but he does not, Browne said.

Melting Arctic ice 111ay uncover nevv routes 
Associated Press 

PARIS -Arctic ice has shrunk to the lowest level on record, new satellite images show, raising the possibility that the Northwest Passage that eluded famous explorers will become an open shipping lane. 
The European Spaee Agency said nearly 200 satellite photos this month taken together showed an ice-free passage along northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland, and ice retreat­ing to its lowest level since sueh images were first taken in 1978. 
The waters are exposing unexplored resources, and ves­sels could trim thousands of miles from Europe to Asia by bypassing the Panama Canal. The seasonal ebb and flow of ice levels has already opened up a slim summer window for ships. 
Leif Toudal Pedersen, of the Danish National Space Center, said that Aretic iee has shrunk to some 1 million square miles. The previous low was 1.5 mil­lion square miles, in 2005. 
"The strong reduction in just one year eertainly raises flags that the ice (in summer) may disappear much sooner than expected," Pedersen said in an ESA statement posted on its Web site Friday. 
Pedersen said the extreme retreat this year suggested the passage could fully open sooner than expected -but ESA did not say when that might be. Efforts to contact ESA officials in Paris and Noordwik, the Netherlands, were unsuccessful Saturday. 
A U.N. panel on climate change has predicted that polar regions could be virtually free of ice by the summer of 2070 because of rising temperatures and sea ice decline, ESA noted. 
Russia, Norway, Denmark, Canada and the United States are among countries in a race to secure rights to the Arctic that heated up last month when Hussia sent two small sub­marines to plant its national flag under the North Pole. A 
U.S. study has suggested as much as 25 percent of' the world's undiscovered oil and gas could bn hidden in the area. 
Environmentalists fear increased maritime traflie and ell'ort<; to tap natural resources in the area could one day lead to oil spills and harm regional wildlife. 
Until now, the passage has been expected to remain dosed even during reduced ice cover by multiyear ice pack -sea ice that remains through one or more summers, ESA said. 
Heseareher Claes Hagner of Norway's Fridtjof Nansen Institute, which works on Aretic environmental and political issues, said for now, the new opening has only symbolic meaning for the future of sea transport. 
"Houtes between Scandinavia and Japan eould be almost halved, and a stable and reli­able route would mean a Jot to eertain regions," he said by phone. But even if the passage is opening up and polar ice con­tinues to melt, it will take years for sueh routes to be regular, he said. 
Associated Press 
DETHOlT -Contract negoti­ations betwnen General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers roached a critical point Sunday as local union officials hopnd for an agree­mont but prnpared once again l'or a possible strike on Monday. 
Lnaders at l'aetorics across 
the country received conflir.t­
ing reports out of Detroit 
Sunday af'tcrnoon. Several 
roported progress and opti­
mism but said that if no agree­
mont was rnached Sunday 
night, the union would walk 
out Monday morning. A local 
in Arlington, Texas, however, 
told its mmnbers to report as 
scheduled Monday. 
At a union meeting Sunday af'ternoon, UAW Local 735 Presidnnt Chuck Hogers told mombnrs l'rorn a GM transmis­sion complex ncar Ypsilanti that he was told by one of tho nogotiators that if no agree­ment was reached Sunday, they will go on strike. 
Two other local leaders also said they wore told to cxpoet a strikn if no agreement was roaehnd Sunday. They asknd not to bo identified becausn the talks are private. 
Hogers told union members that the union came within minutes of striking Friday night whon President Hon Gettolfingnr walked out of a bargaining room after getting into a dispute with GM nego­tiators. But GM Chief Financial OITieer Fritz Henderson inter­vened and brought Gettelfinger back to the bar­
'--­
gammg table, and progress has been made since then, Hogers said. 
GM's contract with the UAW was to expire at midnight Friday, but the union extended it on an hour-by-hour basis. The strike threat loomed until early Saturday, when negotia­tors told local leaders to stand down. 
Strike talk often is heard when negotiations get elose to or pass the contract expiration deadline. 
"I heard things are moving kind of in the right direetion," said Dave Green, president of one of two locals at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant that makes small ears for Chevrolet and Pontiac. "We let our folks know a strike is not out of the question," he said, adding that he hoped for a resolution. 
Bargainers worked all day Saturday, taking a rest break at 9 p.m. and resuming negoti­ations at 11 a.m. Sunday, said GM spokeswoman Katie McBride. She reported progress but said several tough issues remained, declin­ing comment on speeilies. 
A message was left for UAW spokesman Hoger Kerson. 
Local 276 at a GM sport util­ity vehicle plant in suburban Dallas told workers on its Web site Sunday to report to work as seheduled. 
"The instructions for all employees at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Arlington, Texas, remain the same: You are instrueted to report to work at your normal time on Monday," a notiee on the Web site said.

Laid man 
had their doath sen­tences thrown out -High Sounding 
taming the f'requen-Words cy of executions slightly -in rare instances for Texas: A commutation by Governor Hick Perry and a stayed execution by a Dallas county judge. 
Thirty-nine executions have occurred so far in 2007 across the 
U.S. Twenty-four of those have been in Texas. No other state has executed more than three inmates this year. 
The death by lethal injection of Johnny Conner on Aug. 22 marked the state's 400th execution since the reinstatement of the death penalty there in 1982. That's an average of 16 executions per year over a quarter of a century. 
Sixteen deaths per year is a shock­ing statistic, but it fails to capture the reality of' the death penalty in Texas. Calculating the average number of executions doesn't reveal that 315 of the 400 executions in Texas have occurred in the past 13 years under the tenure of only two governors. 
From 1994 to 2000, 152 inmates were killed under then-Gov. George 
W. Bush. From 2000 to today, 164 have been executed with Gov. Perry in charge. 
These two governors have achieved the highest numbers in American his­tory for a state in killing its own citi­zens. And to what end? The murder rate in Texas remains more than dou­ble that of any state without the death penalty in the nation. 
While executions continue to climb in Texas, they're declining nationally, returning to levels of the early 1990s when the American public found the death penalty far Jess appealing than it has in the last decade. Overall sup­port for the death penalty is down, and a 2006 Gallup poll reported that f'or the first time, more Americans expressed support f'or life without parole as a sentencing option than for the death penalty. 
A more recent poll by the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) in Washington, D.C., found that 58 per­cent of Americans want a moratorium on executions. A poll by the American Bar Association in Indiana reported that 61 percent of Hoosiers agree. 
In an interview with Newsweek. Hichard Dieter, executive direetor of the DPIC, said Americans are not expressing total opposition or moral objection to the death penalty, but rather concerns about how the state's ultimate punishment is used and implemented. The big issues are pro­tecting the innocent, unfairness and disbelief in the death penalty as a deterrent. 
Aceording to Dieter, who comes to campus this week to deliver the open­ing lecture of a five-part series on the death penalty, "[TJhere's common agreement about who's on death row: People who can't afford their own lawyers, and a high percentage of minorities. The end result is dissatis­faction." 
Dissatisfaction, skepticism, and waning support for the idea that minor reforms can bring fairness. 
Even Perry expressed concerns about fairness, with his commutation of Kenneth Foster on Aug. 30. Foster was sentenced to death even though he did not pull the trigger in the 1996 murder he was convicted of, under a Texas law that makes an accomplice to murder subject to the death penal­ty. 
Foster was driving with a group of friends late into the night on Aug. 15, 1996. They were heavily under the influence of drugs and were commit­ting arnwd robberies. Ono confronta­tion between Foster's frim1d, who had exited thn car, and a man on the street ended in murder. Foster was sentnnecd to death in thn ease, though he sat eighty fnet away in tlw car when his friend's gun went ofT. 
The approach of the scheduled exe­cution of Foster for Aug. 30 (the date of his commutation) received interna­tional attention and petitions for his exe-cution to be called ofT. 
The idea of executing the man who didn't pull the trigger was just too much, even for Perry. 
"After carefully considering the facts of' this ease, along with the rec­ommendations from the Board of Pardons and Paroles, I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster's sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment," Perry said in a statement. "I am coneerned about Texas law that allows capital murder defendants to be tried simul­taneously, and it is an issue I think the legislature should examine." 
As a nation, America is losing confi­dence in the death penalty. That's the verdict of polls, interviews, nation­wide trends, events like Foster's com­mutation and the stance of experts like Mr. Dieter, who believe that a moratorium on executions is the solu­tion Americans want.

Adopt a code of conduct for apparel 

Step up efforts for worn_en's hockey 
I recently saw the announcement that Notre Dame will be investing in a new hockey facility. This is a great move for the University and the CCHA. In order to build a hockey cul­ture, I believe it is critical to have a competitive women's program as well. Most of the recent NCAA men's champi­onship teams have women's programs, often great ones! 
What is Notre Dame's plan for women's division I hockey? Just look outside: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Harvard, St. Cloud State and Ohio State have programs. Plus, we might as well beat the Wolverines to it.

'Deuces Manor' in poor taste 
One of my closest friends freshman year was extremely over­weight. One night at dinner, she asked me to go up and get her dessert so that no one would know she was eating ice cream. She felt too self-conscious -not to eat the dessert, but to have her fellow peers judge her as they watched her pick up those "unnecessary calories," shamefully bringing them back to her table. 
To me, this interaction was devastating, but what is even more of an issue is the fact that this isn't a singular or unique case. Wednesday's "Deuces Manor" comic strip represents a serious problem on Notre Dame's campus. Body image is a real topic and a real issue. There are eating disorders at Notre Dame. Is this something to joke about? I don't think so. Should my dining hall tray or my presence in the fro-yo line be monitored? I hope not. 
It is not easy to be a woman at Notre Dame. At a school where most women are athletic and intelligent, there are defmite pres­sures to look and be a certain way. Instead of poking fun at the overweight, perhaps we should seek to understand the pain that so many go through because of the pressures of body image. We are members of a top academic and religious institution that prides itself on forming its students towards goodness and truth. Shouldn't we be slightly above writing, publishing and laughing at such a comic strip? Not only is this a blatant insult to the intel­ligence of the Notre Dame student body, but it also represents a great lack of compassion and understanding.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
On March 6, 2001, then-University President Edward Malloy signed the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC), allowing Notre Dame to join more than 100 schools that were a part of the process to make a positive statement against sweatshops that made its T-shirts and other articles of clothing. Because of Notre Dame's powerful influence in the collegiate apparel industry, the signing of the contract was considered a huge suc­cess for the WRC. 
llowever, the gains the WHC bring are under con­stant threat due to the destructive pressures of the apparel industry, and the majority of college apparel continues to be made in factories that violate workers' rights. A large percentage of the factories have, in fact, closed down because making change factory-by-factory makes the improved factory uncompetitive unless there is an incentive outside the system of competition. A factory that is paying better wages and implement­ing reforms in order to comply with codes has higher operating costs and is less competitive based solely on price. 
To ensure that the principles behind the codes of conduct become a reality, an additional program was created in order to subject all companies that produce collegiate apparel to the same higher standard. Last year, United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) launched a new national campaign to get college apparel to be produced in a set of sweat-free designat­ed factories. Under the Designated Suppliers Program (DSP), university licensees are required to source most university logo apparel from supplier factories that have been determined by universities, through inde­pendent verification, to be in compliance with their obligation to respect the rights of their employees ­including the right to organize and bargain collectively and the right to be paid a living wage. 
While it is true that the collegiate sector is only a small portion of the global apparel industry, colleges and universities have the freedom to influence the apparel market. If Notre Dame joins the DSP, it will become a model for other apparel sectors as well as for other colleges and universities across the country. While it cannot be assured that the DSP will solve the sweatshop problem even in the collegiate sector, it surely is a better answer than other policies being pro­posed elsewhere. So, in 2001, Notre Dame decided that it would actively oppose the exploitation of workers in other countries. Notre Dame also decided to take a stance on where its apparel would be made, and decid­ed that it would live up to the Catholic standards of ethical and moral practices. Why not take the next step to ensure that the expectations are truly being met?

Notre Dame looked helpless to stop Michigan or to score; now will startfrom scratch 

By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -For the third straight week, Notre Dame's offense stumbled and fumbled its way to a blowout loss. 
Michigan (1-2) followed the lead of running back Mike Hart and beat the Irish 38-0 in front of a relieved crowd of 111,178 at Michigan Stadium Saturday.. 
Hart ran 35 times for 187 yards and two touchdowns as Michigan redeemed itself after a blowout loss to Oregon and a defeat at the hands of Football Championship Subdivision (for­merly Division 1-AA) Appalachian State to start the season. 
For Notre Dame, there was no change of fortunes. It lost 33-3 to Georgia Tech on Sept. 1 and 31-10 to Penn State a week ago. 
Notre Dame once again failed to establish either a rushing or passing attack against Michigan, totaling only 79 yards on 55 offensive plays. Freshman quarterback Jimmy Clausen was 11-of-1 7 for 7 4 yards with one interception, but sacks of the freshman cost the Irish 65 yards. 
The interception was indica­tive of the way Notre Dame's offense operated. On the play, the offensive line failed to sus­tain a block, and all four Wolverine defensive linemen rushed into the backfield. Clausen dropped back, but line­backer John Thompson inter­cepted the pass intended for David Grimes. 
The Irish also failed for the third game to break even on the ground -finishing with -6 yards. Sophomore James Aldridge was the only bright spot, with 51 yards on 10 car­ries -though much of his yardage came against Michigan's second string. 
The Michigan defense plowed through the Irish line on passes and rushes, recording 14 tack­les for loss, including eight sacks. 
"We gotta do a better job [on pass protection]. We've gotta start seeing improvement from game to game," said sophomore Sam Young, who switched to left tackle from right tackle for most of the game. 
Clausen looked confused against the Michigan defense, which used disguised coverage and blitzes. 
"We'd come up on different plays and mix up his mind," Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham said. "Once we did that, he didn't know what to do. We tried to keep things moving the whole game." 
But the Irish added a new wrinkle to their offensive faults -fumbles. Notre Dame fum­bled five times in the opening quarter, including John Sullivan's snap on the game's first play, which went over the head of running back Armando Allen, who was lined up in the shotgun. 
The Wolverines weren't per­fect, but they didn't need to be. 
Michigan freshman quarter­back Ryan Mallett finished 7 -of­15 for 90 yards in his first start but had three touchdowns. 
"Our objective in the red zone is to make him throw it and not run it," Irish safety David Bruton said. "So if we get them to throw it in the red zone, that means we're achieving one goal but they're still getting points." 
Michigan took an early 3-0 lead after forcing Notre Dame to punt on its opening posses­sion. The Wolverines went up 10-0 minutes later when Hart ran two yards to cap a six-play, 21-yard drive that began after a Clausen fumble. 
On Michigan's second score, Hart ran left into a crowded Notre Dame 3-yard line, but bounced back outside, found space and ran in for the score, putting Michigan up 17-0 with only 21 seconds expired in the second quarter. 
"Obviously we were going to try to run the ball, regardless. I don't think it was anything about taking advantage of them," Hart said. "With a fresh­man quarterback we had no choice but to try and run the ball." 
Hart was nearly unstoppable in the second half. The senior pounded the ball up field for 50 of the Wolverine's 79 yards on the team's final scoring drive. 
"We kept going getting five and six yards a carry," Hart said. "If you keep getting that you're going to keep running the ball."

And yet the defense seemingly never quit. Yes, Terrail Lambert's pass inter­ference was a penalty of frustratlon, one of laziness. But where was he the rest of the game? Haeshon MeNeil took over at the cornerback spot for most of the remainder of tile game.

At this point, Charlie Weis has to stop thinking about what he owes his filth­year guys.

Weis returns team to preseason 
NO failure so far leads to new training camp mentality

said. "Obviously after three games in, the team is heading in the wrong direction, and [the] only way I know to fix it is to come out swing­ing," Weis said. 
What that literally means is that the Irish will be spending less time watching tape and preparing for defenses and more time in pads and practicing plays, 
"I can't worry about Michigan, I can't worry about Michigan State," Weis said. I have to worry about Notre Dame. I have to worry about me, about my coaching staff, about my players-and justifiably so after you lose a game like that." 
When Weis began his post-game news conference, he said he would take his "beating" and answer as many questions as reporters had. About 10 minutes into the conference, Notre Dame's media relations director said there would be "one more question," but Weis said he would continue answering questions ­and did, for another 10 minutes. 
It was the definite change in Weis's routine in the move from Week 3 to training camp. 
Weis cancelled his usual Sunday news conference and moved his mid-week news conference, at which he answers questions about the upcoming opponent, to Thursday from Tuesday. He will talk about the team's practices and whatever progress it makes Tuesday and Wednesday night. 
But there will be some significant dif­ferences from the two-a-day training camp that began Aug. 6 and lasted until the week before Notre Dame and Georgia Tech kicked off the season. 
The biggest week-to-week change for the players was Sunday's padded prac­tice, which replaced the film study and classroom work it usually does the day after a game.

NCAA rules limit teams to 17 hours of out-of-game football time each week. So, Weis said, the Irish will go into Saturday's Michigan State gariie after practicing for four hours on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday is the team's day ofl'. 
Through three games, Notre Dame has accumulated only 359 yards passing and negative-14 yards on the ground. The Irish have fumbled 12 times and lost five, have committed 24 penalties and have surrendered 23 sacks. 
Against Michigan, Notre Dame took its largest step back. Still without an offen­sive touchdown on the year, the Irish failed to threaten for a touchdown and had only one play in Michigan territory in the first half. 
When asked if the return to "training camp" meant all positions would be open for competition, Weis skirted the issue. He said the starting point for the team would be installation of the offense. 
For Weis, the reversion to training camp mode is a stark admission that his strategies were not working and his game planning was deficient, at least in trying to minimize Notre Dame's weak­nesses. 
"We've come up short every time," Weis said. "What we're going to do is we're going to start from the beginning."

By DAMON JASON Staff Writer 
"BioShock" is one of those rare games that takes an established genre and cre­ates something much more. With a first­person shooter setup, "BioShock" incor­porates role-playing and action-adven­ture elements, as well as including con­ventions from survival horror titles like "Resident Evil." The result is a game that is undoubtedly the best example thus far of what is capable on next-generation consoles. 
As the sole survivor of a plane crash, the game's main character, Jack, is stranded in the Atlantic Ocean. Struggling to get by, Jack ends up stum­bling upon the underwater city of Rapture. In its current state, Rapture is nothing but a shadow of the underwater utopia it was once intended to be. Creatures called Little Sisters, Splicers and Big Daddies roam the city, and it is clear that you must do anything to sur­vive. 
From the start of the game, Jack learns that the heart of the problem -why things went so badly so quickly in Rapture -was the clamor for a sub­stance called ADAM. ADAM is a sub­stance resulting from a form of stem cell research, and by using this matter, it is possible to undergo a number of genetic modifications (or Plasmids). Existing in many forms, such as incinerate, lightning and telekinesis, these plasmids can be used in a variety of ways to defeat your enemies. In order to survive the horrors that exist in Rapture, Jack must equip and effectively use these genetic upgrades to his advantage. 

"BioShock" gives players the standard conventional weapons, including pistols, shotguns, machine guns and melee weapons. Effectively switching between conventional weapons and plasmids is essential for your survival in Rapture. For example, you may have to stun an enemy with lightning, then whack it with a melee weapon to defeat it. Switching between the conventional weapons and plasmids feel surprisingly intuitive, and overall "BioShock" controls incredibly well. 
All plasmids are purchased from Little Sisters, who roam around harvesting ADAM from corpses scattered through­out Rapture. While powerless on their own, Big Daddies accompany each Little Sister. The Big Daddies are immense, armor-clad behemoths that will do any­thing to protect the Little Sisters and the ADAM they collect. By using a combina­tion of conventional weapons and plas­mids, none of these creatures should pose too big of a problem. After taking care of the Big Daddies, the ADAM car­ried by the Little Sisters is yours for the taking. 
Aside from various boss battles, the other creatures that garners will often encounter are called Splicers, which are essentially Rapture survivors who have gone insane in their lust for ADAM. 
Existing in multiple 
forms, none of these creatures are too hard to defeat. 
Graphically, the game is a beast. Powered by the popular Unreal Engine 3, everything in the world looks simply amazing, especially in HD. While the game itself can be completed in 15-18 hours, garners will likely spend more time just simply explor­ing the city of Rapture. The realism of the 
OBSERVER GRAPHIC I Jarred Wafer 

"BioShock" takes place '~~:t~~~~··~~~: mythical city of Rapture. 
graphics helps add to the game's creepy atmosphere. Combine these visuals with a superb audio soundtrack, and this game is genuinely scary. 
If there is anything players can fault the game for, it is the fact that there is no death penalty. When Jack dies, he simply resuscitates in the nearest Vita Chamber, with most health and inventory in tact. Everything else in the world remains exactly as it was before dying, including damage dealt to enemies. While this cer­tainly takes away the frustration that accompanies backtracking over the same area multiple times, it does make game play a little too easy. Aside from this small deficiency, there is nothing nega­tive to be said about this game. It con­trols perfectly, looks beautiful and is gen­uinely fun to play. 
"BioShock" is likely to be one of the best games released this year. Aside from creating a very entertaining and fun gaming experience, the developers deliv­er in creating one of the most engrossing stories ever featured in a video game.

The place has a Joseph Conrad­esque "Heart of Darkness" feel to it, an "Apocalypse Now" sensation of

ness, with the utter certainty Scene Editor that the locals are most definitely unfriendly and will not hesitate to make their opinions known. 
You go there for two things: Get a win, and get the heck out of there. On the whole, taking in a Notre Dame-Michigan game is much like how I'd imagine fighting a real wolverine inside a Port-a-Potty would be: It's unpleasant, it smells bad and you try not to touch any­thing. 
No man, woman or child sporting the wrong colors is safe in Ann Arbor. 

That being said, the U of M isn't entirely without its charms. The blue and maize (always original, the Michigan student section has dubbed the yellow color scheme the "Maize Out") pompous morons pumping their fists (and the free yellow pom­poms stadium officials hand out) fail not to impress with their never-end­ing chants of that jarring headache, "Hail to the Victors." 
To top it all off, they finished each rendition with a new signature catch chant at the end-"You suck!" As my friends and I sat there cringing and taking in the suffering, there wasn't a whole lot we could do to refute this claim, and so we sat and took our medicine quietly. 
I have to say, the Ann Arbor expe­rience of two years ago was much better. Then, there was the pleasure of watching the Michigan unfaithful booing their own team and tossing their pom-poms onto the field before escaping like scurvy rats from a pirate ship after a 17-10 Irish upset of third-ranked Michigan. 

Heading to Ann Arbor is a masochistic experience; you have to be prepared for people yelling at you and potentially drenching you in car­bonated beverages. Not to mention the possibility of a Wolverine victory. 
On our way out, as we were hum­bled and tired, a Michigan man tossed out a final parting shot, adding insult to injury. 
"Thanks for coming, you guys," he said, his mullet wreathing his shoul­ders underneath the Michigan ball cap tucked tightly on his head. In his hand he held a maize-colored pom­pom, a fluffy victory memento. 
"No problem," I said, stalling for time. Tired, cold and nearly out of comebacks, I nonetheless managed to come up with at least a halfway decent parting shot. 
"Real men don't wave pom-poms."

PGA TouR 


Associated Press 
ATLANTA -The FedEx Cup didn't change anything but Tiger Woods' bank account. 
The PGA Tour's "new era in golf' came to a familiar conclusion Sunday when Woods captured the Tour Championship in record-set­ting fashion, closing with a 4-under 66 for an eight-shot victory at East Lake and his seventh title of the season. 
The only difference? 
This was the first time Woods walked away from one tournament with two trophies. 
Along with winning the Tour Championship and its $1.26 million prize, Woods was a runaway winner of the FedEx Cup and the $10 million that goes into his retirement account. 

If this was supposed to be the "Super Bowl" of golf, Woods spent most of the final round running out the clock. 
He stretched his three­shot lead to four at the turn, and the only drama was whether he would break the 72-hole scoring record on the PGA Tour. He had to set­tle for a 23-under 257, his career low on tour and breaking the Tour Championship record by six shots. 
"I hit it good this week," Woods said. ~It's been a phenomenal week" 
Masters champion Zach Johnson closed with a 68 and tied for second with Mark Calcavecchia, who shot a 71. 
Steve Stricker and Phil Mickelson were the only players with a realistic chance of capturing the FedEx Cup, and their hopes were gone by the weekend. Stricker closed with a 67 and wrapped up second place in the PGA Tour Playoffs, giving him a $3 million retirement boost. 
The FedEx Cup was a points race that began in January, with the points reset after the majors for a four-week stretch of the PGA Tour Playoffs. Woods skipped the first playoff event in New York, tied for second outside Boston, then won the last two tourna­ments to win by an over­whelming margin . 
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem first presented Woods with the crystal tro­phy from the Tour Championship. Before handing him the FedEx Cup trophy, Finchem alluded to the tour's promotion of the FedEx Cup by noting it had never been kissed. 
And it still hasn't. 
Woods simply held it aloft as the thousands around 18th green cheered. 
"Once you got into the playoffs, you're playing against the best guys and the hottest players. You have to play well," Woods said. "We had some great drama. In the end, it was a lot offun for all of us." 
IN BRIEF 

Bowyer gets first Nextel Cup 
win m New Hampshire 
LOUDON, N.H. -Clint Bowyer vowed to use the Chase for the cham­pionship to raise his Nextel Cup pro­file. One race in, and Bowyer is NASCAR's newest race winner. 
Bowyer raced to his first Nextel Cup victory Sunday, starting from the pole and leading all 221 of the 300 laps to win at New Hampshire International Speedway. 
Bowyer entered the 12-driver Chase as the only contender without a victory, and had never finished higher than third in his short Cup career. But he's inched closer and closer to the front of the field, and thought he had a chance at a win last week in Richmond but spun his Chevrolet as he was making a pass for the lead. 
It brought him into the Chase open­er as the 12th seed, trailing defending series champion Jimmie Johnson by 60 points and acutely aware of his ranking. 
Phoenix shocks Detroit on 
the road to claim WNBA title 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. Phoenix's fast start made the Mercury the WNBA's first road champion. 
Penny Taylor scored 30 points and the Mercury cruised to a 108-92 vic­tory Sunday over the defending champion Detroit Shock in the fifth and deciding gam!'\ of the WNBA finals. Cappie Pondexter added 26 and Diana Taurasi had 17 for Phoenix, the first road team to win the title away from home. 
The Shock lost the last two games of the stlries, foiling their bid to become the third WNBA team to win back-to-hack championships. 
Phoenix, taking some steam out of the fired-up home crowd, raced to a 20-9 lead midway through the first quarter. Taurasi had eight points, including 2 3-pointers, in that stretch as Phoenix came out firing against the frazzled Detroit defense. 
Eaks rallies for second win 
at Greater Hickory Classic 
CONOVER, N.C. -R.W. Eaks won his second Champions Tour title of the year Sunday, closing with a 2­under 70 to hold off Jay Haas and Rod Spittle by two strokes in the Greater Hickory Classic. 
Eaks finished with a 17 -under 199 total to break the tournament record of 16-under 200 set by Haas in 2005. 
"That's the hardest thing I've ever had to do," said Eaks, who rallied from a five-stroke deficit to force a playoff with eventual winner Andy Bean last year at Rock Barn Golf and Spa. "I always told myself that if I ever had that kind of a lead, it'd be the easiest thing to do to keep it, but it's not. ... I'll never do that again ­at least not intentionally." 
Eaks, who held a three-shot lead over Spittle entering Sunday's final round, extended his margin to six strokes with three birdies on the front nine at Rock Barn's Jones course.

Raikkonen vvins third Belgium Grand Prix 
Associated Press 
BEL<;IUM ~ Kimi Haikkonen won the Belgian (;rand Prix for tho third straight time, boating Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on Sunday in thn first raee since Formula One was rocked by a $100 million finfl in the sport's spy scandal. 
World champion Fernando Alonso took third ahead of McLaren teammate Lewis llamilton after an opening cor­nor duel, rndudng the rookie's load in the driv~rs' standings to two points with three races remaining. 
Haikkonen 's victory only looked in doubt when Massa launched a latn attack with three or the 44 laps to go. When it was clear Massa would not get past the Finn, the two drivnrs eased up to coast at the c:lwckered flag. 
"It was a perfect thing for the team, 1-2," Haikkonen said. 
Haikkonen celebrated by spinning his ear on the track. snnding a white plume of burnt rubber up in the air in front of (>5.000 fans at the 4.325-mile track. With his victory, Haikkonen also maintained his outside chance to win the world title. 
"We haven't given up hope. We are still in the hunt," Haikkonnn said. "We just keep pushing and sen what hap­pens." 
In the standings, llamilton has 97 points and Alonso has 
95. Haikkonen is third with 84 and Massa fourth with 77. With races still to come in Japan, China and Brazil. a maximum 30 points can be won. 
Another clean race for both Alonso and Hamilton even though none got close to win­ning was good enough for McLaren after a tumultuous week. 
"W1've got a great world championship," McLaren team leader Hon Dennis said. 
The 1-2 victory also assured Ferrari of the constructors' title since McLaren was thrown out. Ferrari has an insur­mountable lead of 161 points, with BMW Sauber second with 90. 
Haikkonen finished Sunday in 1 hour. 20 minutes, 39.066 sec­onds, beating Massa by 4.695. Alonso was 14.343 back, and Hamilton 23.615 behind. 
Nick Hcidfeld in a BMW Sauber was fifth, ahead of Williams' Nico Rosberg. 
Even though Spa has the most spectacular track on the circuit, the race was unevent­ful. with the top four on the grid finishing in the same posi­tions and never overtaking each other. The only momen­tary chances came during the drivers' two pit stops. 
The biggest incident came at the start and highlighted the hot rivalry between McLaren teammates Alonso and llamilton. 
Alonso, starting third on the grid ahead of Hamilton, imme­diately moved over to attack the Source hairpin, blocking Hamilton's way. 
Coming out and gathering speed, Alonso went wide and pushed llamilton onto the side­track.

Broncos need overtime field goal to top Raiders 
Shanahan calls strategic timeout to foil Janikowski's game-winning attempt; Denver now 2-0 as Oakland drops to 0-2 
Associated Press 

DENVI\H -The crowd J.{roaned. the Haidnrs celebrated and Mike Shanahan smiled. 
The Denver Broncos coach may never have callnd a smarter timeout. 
Jason Elam's 23-yard field J.{oal with 5:4H left in overtime !-{ave the Broncos a 23-20 win over Oakland just minutes aftor tho Haiders had exulted ovnr what they thouJ.{ht was their own wild win. 
Sebastian .Janikowski nailed a 52-yard field goal at 11:13 or overtime. But as the Haiders rushed the lield in e1~lebration and many of' the Broncos hun!-{ their heads in defeat. referee Walt Anderson ruled that Denver had called a timoout just before the snap. 
On the rPtry, Janikowski's high -an~ ing kick hil tho le l't upright, fluttering tho flag atop the polo and giving tho Broncos new life and tho ball at their 42. They drove to thn Oakland 6 and Elam nailed it on first down -and the Haiders didn't bother calling their own tirnnoul. 
"They stole it from us and we stole it right back," Elam said. 
"I feel bad," Broncos safety John Lynch said. "But not real­ly." 
The Haiders (0-2) swore they never heard the whistle. 
"Nobody was aware they called timeout," lamented Oakland's rookie coach, Lane Kiff'in. "They rushed just like thern wasn't a timnoul. Maybe somobody's got to tell me the rule. They should tell the ref to blow it just before he kicks it." 
Shanahan knew exactly when to eall it: right as long snapper Jon Condo looked up. 
"When you take it down to a millimeter of a second, that works pretty good," Lynch said. "Mike's timing was unbeliev­able. I was standing next to him when he told the referee, 'We're going to call a timeout.' But then I'm saying, 'All right, do it! Do it!' And he did, I think with 2 seconds, and thn guy blew his whistle." 
Thn Broncos insisted they wcrnn'l so much trying to icc .Janikowski as they worn hoping to get their rushers a breather. Sure enough, Janikowski pushml it ever so slightly to the left whon Dre' Bly applied pres­sure oil' the corner. 
.Janikowski, who missed three field goals last week, had split thn uprights from 65 yards in pregame warmups, and his miss in overtime looked like it could have traveled 80 yards had it not clanked off the yellow pole. 
''I've never seen anybody hit the top of the upright from 52 yards out." Elam said. "lin's very talented." 
.Janikowski's leg strength had the Broncos on edge. 
"That's what we were fearful of on that last drive," Lynch said. "lie can be erratie, but you know he can kick the ball from 70 yards here." 
.. 
This was the first time since Green Bay did it in 2004 that an NFL team had won consecutive 
games on the last play. Elarn hit a 42-yarder as limn expired to give Denver a 15-14 win at Bull'alo in the opener. 
"When you keep playing, good things happen," Lynch said. This one wasn't nearly as fre­
netie a finish as that one, when the Broncos had no timeouts and only 10 seconds to get off the mirade kiek. But it was just as satisfying to the Broncos (2­0), who won their eighth straight home opener and handed the Haiders (0-2) their 11th straight loss overall. 
"It was tough," Haiders quar­terback Josh McCown said. "Because you go from total ela­tion, you're excited, you came on the road and got a win, and it takes the wirul right out of you. It's unfortunate for 'Seabass.' He nailed it, the first one." 
The Haiders overeame a two­TO halftime deficit and grabbed a 20-17 lead with 8:55 left in regulation when linebacker Thomas Howard intercepted Jay Cutler's tipped pass returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. and Oakland got the 2-point conversion.

WOMEN'S GOLF 
American women win Solheim Cup 
Morgan Pressel upsets Anika Sorenstam to give U.S. victory 
Associated Press 
SWEDEN -The Americans were hardly chokers when the stakes were highest at the Solheim Cup. 
Doggone good was more like it. 
Dominating the singles match­es like they always have, the Americans celebrated one of the most coveted wins in women's golf Sunday, a 16-12 decision over Europe that ended any thought that they might be the "Chokin' freakin' dogs," that Dottie Pepper said they were. 
Led by Morgan Pressel's upset over Annika Sorenstam and Stacy Prammanasudh's surpris­ing win over Suzann Pettersen, the Americans went 8-3-1 in sin­gles. They cap­tured the Solheim 
ers,"

"I thought we had a

win at Crooked really shows." Stick in Indiana. American captain Nicole Castrale said. "It wasn't like we were playing that bad. It wasn't like we were giving it away." 
When the singles rolled around, those setbacks were for­gotten and the Americans took control quickly. 
At one point, they led in eight of the 12 matches with a few more tied. Red dominated the scoreboard and there was no way the Europeans could ignore it. 
Inkster took a big early lead for a 4-and-3 win over Iben Tinning. Pat Hurst led almost the whole way in a 2-and-1 win over Sophie Gustafson. Pressel got her first Solheim Cup win, 2 and 1 over Sorenstam -in Sorenstam's home country, no less. 
The Americans improved their winning percentage in singles to .602 over the history of the tour­nament. 
"Without this sounding wrong, the feeling was that our team had the better play­said 
''I'm even more excited now." 
They did it in rain and wind and cold, the kind of week in which the love of the game ­what the Solheim Cup is all about -is the about only thing that could possibly get someone out on the course. 
And they did it with a bit of a chip on their shoulders, placed there by Pepper, the former American player and firebrand who is now an analyst on the Golf Channel. 
On Saturday, after the United States turned a couple of looming wins into disappointing ties, Pepper called the Americans "Chokin' freakin' dogs"-a com­ment she made when she thought she was ofT the air, but wasn't. 
"It was hurtful, very, very hurt­ful to all of us on the team," said assistant captain Beth Daniel. "Dottie's been there. She knows what it's like. Even if she said it off the air, it was ill-spirited." 
Back on the air Sunday, Pepper said she stood by the comments. The Americans insisted they had let the whole thing go by the time they went to bed Saturday night and were just concentrating on winning. 
But before the winning started, there were a few more disap­pointments. · 
Because of the brutal weather, the fourball matches needed to be finished early Sunday. And when CTeamer and Brittany Lincicome each missed 3-foot tap-ins on No. 17, it cost their team a hole, the lead and eventu­ally a half-point in a tie against Linda Wessberg and Maria Hjorth. 
The Europeans went into the final round with an 8 1/2-7 112 lead, and the Americans -with four rookies on the team ­looked like they really might be too young and nervous to actually win this event. 
"But we knew 16, 17, 18, they're tough holes," Juli Inkster made an 8-footer 
to close out a 3­and-2 victory over Bettina Hauert and make things official, giving the United States 14 1/2 points to secure its second straight win, but first on foreign soil since 1996. 
"None of us feel like losers," Laura Davies said. "We lost to a better team today." 
After Castrale closed things out, the Americans piled into a big golf cart to watch the rest of the now-meaningless matches. Laura Diaz waved an American flag. Later, they got in a big hud­dle and cheered "U.S.A, U.S.A, All the way!" 
"I thought we had a lot of talent on our team but that it would be tough to do it over here ifyou go by history," American captain Betsy King said. "I thought we were going to do it, but I didn't want to say that before we did it. So now I'm saying it." 
Through most of the singles matches, it was the Europeans, not the Americans, who looked as if they hadn't been in these sit­uations before. 
Maybe the most symbolic scene for Europe was that of rookie Becky Brewerton stymied by a tree near the 18th green, looking at playing a left-handed shot. 
A veteran more familiar with the rules might have asked for relief, then been able to move the ball and play right-handed, because of the stands that blocked her path to the hole.

Irish sweep Catholic Championships again 
Men win 19th title and women get 14th in annual home race 
By KATE ARNOLD Sports Wri1er 
The Irish once again earned bragging rights on Friday after­noon at the 28th annual National Catholic: Championship, held at Notre Dame's Burke Golf Course. Both the men's and women's teams eaptured the first place title over the 35 Division I teams competing. 
Notre Dame ha<; a rich history of success at the National Catholic: Championship. The men's team has won 19 raees, 17 of them within the last 20 years, while the women's team has won 14 of the last 16 titles. 
The women's team was espe­cially suceessful, daiming five of the top seven spots. In her first collegiate race, freshman Marissa Treece took the gold with a time of 17:24, 20 seconds ahead of the field 
Tn1ece didn't have to wait long at the l"inish line to celebrate with her teammates. Sophomore Lindsey Ferguson finished next for the Irish in fourth plaee over­a11(17:49). 
Freshman Theresa Cattuna (18:03), senior Ann Mazur, and sophomore Beth Tad were right behind Ferguson finishing fifth, sixth, and seventh. 
The men's team also continued their domination against all other teams, but they do not take their success for granted. 
"It's always a challenge," men's head coach Joe Piane said. "Two years ago we lost to Duquesne." 
All five Notre Dame runners fmished in the top ten spots. 
Finishing first for the Irish was freshman Dan Jackson. 14 seconds Vaselik (25:32). They finished fifth, ninth, and tenth, respective­ly. 

Both teams chose to run in packs this week, a strategy that certainly paid off. 
Jackson and Springer were neck and neck for the entire race, and the other team mem­bers stayed together as a pack for the first three miles. 
"It's the best way to run cross

said. "It intimi­

Paine was excited about the freshmen joining the team, and looks forward to continued excel­lence. 
"I thought Jackson and Springer would be up there," he said. "They came in as some of the best runners in the country. They're quality, quality kids, strong as an ox and love to com­pete."

The coaches 
look forward to another successful meet, with times comparable to this week­end's. 
"They'll continue to run these times, even though this course was especially fast. The course has the elevation of a pool table,", Plane said. "These next meets will be really demanding. The Notre Dame Invitational will be hard, and the Pre-National meet harder still, and so on through the NCAAs."

Senior leads the way as Belles finish 15th at Illinois-Wesleyan 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
Senior captain Katie O'Brien once again led the way for the Belles in a tournament this weekend, but this time she set records. 
The Belles finished 15th in the 21-team field with a two­day score of 688 ( + 112) at the Illinois Wesleyan Fall Classic. 
O'Brien shot an 84 on Saturday and followed it up with a 7 4 on Sunday, giving her a total score of 158 (+14), good enough for 13th among all individuals in the tourna­ment. 
Her 7 4 ties the record set by Stefanie Simmerman for the best round by a golfer in Saint Mary's history. O'Brien's record-tying performance comes on the heels of first­place individual finishes at each of the first two MIAA jamborees. 
The Dearborn, Mich. native was named to the MIAA All­Conference second team after last fall. She finished tied for 24th in the MIAA Tournament. 
O'Brien was 13 strokes off the pace of overall leader Katie Tewell of Franklin in this weekend's contest. 
Southern Indiana finished first with a score of 619 (+43). Three of the top five individ­ual scorers were Salukis. Rounding out the top five on the team leaderboard were SIU Edwardsville, Wisconsin­Stevens Point, St. Ambrose and host Illinois Wesleyan. 
The Belles ended round one in 17th place after shooting a team score of 355. The 22 ­stroke improvement from Saturday to Sunday allowed Saint Mary's to move up two more spots in the team stand­ings.

utes to give the Belles the deeisive 3-0 lead. Sophomore defender Jessiea Slean assisted Durkin's sec­ond goal. 
The Belles defensive unit once again operated on all cylinders, allowing Mount Mnrey to register only six shots. Senior Amy Mahollf~Y made three savns and was relieved by freshman Kristin IOwa in the S3rd minute. 
Saint Mary's recorded 20 shots, eight ol' which were on goal. The B1~lles also had a 7-2 edge on corner kicks, something with whieh they had strugglnd with last week in a loss to llope College. 
Sunday against North Central, 90 minutns of regu­lation and a 20-minute over­time left the teams scoreless. The Belles had a 13-7 advantage in shots and a 5-2 advantage in corner kieks but eould not take advantage ol' the gap. Mahoney was perfeet yet again, notching her fifth shutout in six starts on the season. 
Bridget Honayne, lledinger, Hart, l'n~shman Lauren Eaton and junior Mandy Thomson made their penalty kicks for Saint Mary's, and goal keeper Amy Mahoney made a save to give the team the win.

and he would be out there every day with a bag of balls working on set pieces," Clark said. "Don't be surprised il' lw gets a few more before the end of the season." 
Notre Dame was in control of the mateh for most of the night, out-shooting the Golden Eagles 6-3 in the first half and 14-6 for the game. The Irish also held a 4-3 edge in corner kicks. 
Despite the statistical advan­tage, there were a few tense moments in the second half for Notre Dame. Early in the half, Marquette played a through­ball, and Irish keeper Andrew Quinn came off his line to dear with his feet. The Golden Eagles best ehance came in the 84th minute when Irish mid­fielder Matt Armstrong inad­vertently played the ball back­wards to Marquette's Dan Addis, who shot just wide of Quinn's goal from 18 yards out. 
"There were a couple of times in the second half when 
[Marquette! snmnnd to find a spot through," Clark said. "We controlled the game pretty well, but we always felt a dan­ger there, especially when it was 1-0." 
Quinn, who recorded two saves, pieked up his first win of the season in his second start. The junior goalkeeper got the nod in plaee of senior Chris Cahill who was nursing a quadriceps injury that ham­pered him throughout last weekend's Mike Berticelli Mmnorial Tournament. 
"Chris wasn't able to kick the ball properly, so we decided to give him a rest," Clark said. "Quinn did everything that was asked of him. It's very niee to have backups who can play well." 
The win brings Notre Dame's record to 3-1-1 on the season and 1-0-0 in Big East play in what was the opening eonfor­ence game for both toams. The Irish will travel to Piscataway, N.J., this Friday to take on Hutgers in a game that will b1~ televised on Fox Socc(~r Chanllfd.

The returning Belles were happy to avenge the 1-0 loss they suffered against North Central in the 2006 tourna­ment. 
"We talked about remem­bering how we felt after that game last year." MacKenzie said. "But we fought to get to PKs and got the win." 
The games were the final non-conference tests for the Belles. The team starts league play Saturday when 

they host M IAA foe Kalamazoo. The week off should allow junior Lauren Hinton, and last season's leading seorer, to get healthy enough to make her return and bring the Belles one step eloser to full strength. 
''I'm pleased with our effort everywhere," MacKenzie said. "Our play­ers who have filled in have done well, and we're confi­dent no matter who is out there on the field."

One week al'ter a red eard forced him to sit out Notre Dame's l-1 tie with Northern Illinois, Traynor was back in the lineup Saturday night, scoring Notre Dame's only goal in a 1-0 vil~tory over Marquette at Valley Fi1dds. 
"It was a little bit of naive­nnss mixed with a littl11 bit of bad luck." Irish coach Bobby Clark said of Traynor's red card against Hhode Island. "Tiw punishnwnt of him sitting out last wt>nk was rnon1 than nnough, and he was ready to go."

Napa Cup starts in Louisville today 
Irish face SEC, C-USA clubs in tournament 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Notre Dame isn't looking at the Jield. It's looking at itself. 
After beginning their season with a tournament victory, the Irish are looking to make a statement today at the Napa Hiver Grill Cardinal Cup in Louisville, Ky. The tourna­ment, hosted by the Louisville, is a two-day event. The event will feature several teams from the Big East, SEC and Conference USA. 
"Whenever we get ready for a tournament, we know we are going to face some tough competition," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "We're not looking to go out there and beat specific teams. We want to go and beat the golf course and compete to the best of our ability." 
Notre Dame's lineup will feature Sophomore Kristin Wetzel shooting from the No. 
1 spot. Wetzel finished tied for No. 42 at last week's Cougar Classic when she l'ired a 225 (76-75-74). 
The second spot belongs to frnshman Katie Conway. In her first collegiate action, Conway put up a scorn of 231 (78-75-78) plaeing her in a tie for No. 64. 
Fellow fr~~sh man So -II y u n Park will tee off from tlw third spot. The rookie fired a three­under-par 213 (70-69-741 in hnr debut at the Cougar Classic. 
''I'm not surprised at all," llolt said of Park's early sue­cess. " ... She doesn't put any pressure on herself on the course. She just goes out thorn and knows what she has to do, and executes." 
Junior Lisa Maunu fared even better last week. The veteran co-captain, who will shoot fourth for the Irish, set program records for the low­est round of golf with her opening-round six-under-par 66, and the lowest total for a three-round tournament with a six-under 210 (66-74-70).
