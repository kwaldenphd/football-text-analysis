University Club tests below health standards 

. Inspector finds food in kitchen below specified temperature 
By HELENA PAYNE 
Assistant News Editor 
· The St. Joseph County health department recently cited Notre Dame's private dining facility, the University Club, during an inspec­tion and will soon release its offi­cial report from last week's follow­up inspection. 
Although the initial Oct. 16 visit from the department was supposed to be a routine inspection. the University Club failed to show that they were complying with public health standards. 
An inspector from the St. Joseph Health Department dressed in a black pants suit and a black base­ball cap and carrying a bag walked into University Club's kitchen dur­ing the peak lunch hour and found food below the suggested tempera­ture.

Applying sociology 
. Lecturer describes role of subdivision within sociology discipline 
By JILL MAXBAUER 
News Wricer 
Applied sociology isn't an inferior brand of sociology that needs to be hidden, according to sociologist Jay Weinstein from Eastern Michigan University. 
"Sociologists say that there wasn't applied sociology before 1981, when actually people were doing it," Weinstein said in his Tuesday address at Saint Mary's. "Some scientists think it is an inferior brand of sociology, whereas L believe it's the only brand of sociology." 
Applied sociology is a division of the discipline that uses sociology's theories and core princi­ples to improve and analyze social structures. 
Weinstein said applied sociologists want to make their mark on the world. 
"We go into the world of sociology to repair the world ... to leave the world just a little bit better," he said. 
This hope is at the core of the evolution of the discipline. Weinstein split the evolution of applied sociology into three stages: amateur, academic and post-academic. In the amateur stage, sociology was studied because the schol­ars loved it, not to make a living. 
"For them, sociology was technological knowl­edge designed to change the world," Weinstein explained. It gave the world an outlet that would allow us to organize social life in a moral and scientific way. 
The academic stage was important due to 
"We go into the world of

the interdisciplinary Eastern Michigan University aspect of sociology was sacrificed when looking 
at society. "Problems do not come with labels, only the disci­plines have names," Weinstein said. 
The third stage of the evolution is the post-acade­mic stage. In this field. sociological d·epartments all over the world have to turn to a university for fund­
ing. With state grants, the federal government and

others support the school of thought. This stage is also when the concept of altruism comes into play. 
"Altruism is the idea that behavior should be pro-social, intended to help others in and above itself," Weinstein said. 
Figures who use this concept range from Comte to Jesus Christ. 
"Altruism goes together in a common humanity. You'll find it in those individuals, in those times, where there is a perception ... that we are all one," Weinstein explained. 
Weinstein spoke after accepting an invitation from sociology department chairman Jeff Breese. 
Weinstein is president-elect of the Society for Applied Sociology and specializes in demography and urban sociology for the master in applied sociology program at Eastern Michigan 
University. 

Weinstein spoke on campus since the College has both a major in sociology as well as a major in applied sociology, which has students involved with an internship in the community that will be the basis

Rape victim confides sense of helplessness 
By LAUREN BECK 
News Writer 

Rape victim Wendy said she never thought her best friend Bill was "that type of guy." 
"He was supposed to be my best guy friend, but at a point when r was weak he had taken advantage of me," she said. 
Wendy described her experience of sexual assault Tuesday in a talk about surviving after rape. 
During her junior year of high school, Wendy spent most of her time with Bill. "We talked on the phone every night, went to dances together," she said. "His parents even had pictures of the two of us all over their house." 
When Wendy learned from a mutual friend that Bill wanted to date her, she dis­missed the idea and continued their friend­ship. Weeks later though, after a dance, Wendy found herself intoxicated and alone with Bill in his lake house 40 minutes from home. 
"It was my first time drinking alcohol. and he was making my drinks for me," she said. "I had no clue what I was doing and that was really bad." 
Eventually Bill convinced her to go to bed. "I couldn't walk on my own, so Bill took me back to the bedroom. He tucked me into bed and then turned off the light. but then he sat on the edge of the bed and kissed me on the forehead. 
He kept kissing me but I wasn't kissing back," said Wendy. 
She described her feelings of helpless­ness, confusion and vulnerability as Bill proceeded to rape her. 
"Nothing was making sense and. I was con­fused as to why it was happening," Wendy said. "It was like he was moving me but I had no clue what was going on. Mentally I couldn't think, 'This shouldn't be happen­ing ... It wasn't registering with me that I could do something to stop this."

INSIDE COLUMN 
NDSP a pawn for du Lac 

The Oflice of Student Affairs must think that the Notre Dame Security/Police is a collection of idiots. How else can you explain the no tailgating rule in du Lac? 
Rather than allowing 

NDSP to act like the intelligent thinking men they are when enforcing alcohol laws before foot­ball games, the University enforces a strict and illogical policy. 
Du Lac states: No stu­dent. student organiza­


tion, or University hous­ 
ing facility may organize  Mike Connolly  
or sponsor tailgaters on  
campus or on any adja­ 
cent fields or parking  Editor in Chief  
lots at any time for the  
purpose of serving alco­ 
holic beverages.  

Here is what the rule should state: The University will enforce Indiana State liquor laws in regards to all tailgaters before football games (or some sort of legalese saying the same thing). 
With that, NDSP would be free to act as intelli­gent guardians of the law. They would stop underage drinking by carding and citing suspect­ed underage consumers. This is Indiana law. 
No arguments about tradition or anything else will supercede Indiana law. State law says you have to be 21 to drink. Notre Dame has every right to enforce that law at tailgaters -even if it does completely ignore it on Saturday night when 100 freshmen are packed into a dorm room drinking Busch Lite and singing YMCA. But University hypocrisy is a topic for a completely different column. 
NDSP officers could also cite students who are publicly intoxicated. Public intoxication is against the law regardless of age. Notre Dame has every right to arrest publicly intoxicated individuals who are a nuisance to people around them. 
If a group of 21-year old students are complete­ly drunk and obnoxious, Notre Dame should cite them. Becoming so drunk and belligerent as to disrupt the tailgating enjoyment of others is a problem. NDSP officers are intelligent people who can spot this type of behavior and put a stop to it. 
But if a group of 21-year-old students are standing behind a car, grilling some burgers and drinking a few beers, this is not a problem. If they are not disrupting anyone. if they aren't intoxicat­ed, if they aren't underage, they aren't violating any Indiana law. NDSP can easily determine the difference between the obnoxious drunks and the quiet tailgaters. NDSP can tell the difference between alcohol use and alcohol abuse. 
But ResLlfe won't let NDSP act in an intelligent manner. 
Rather than writing a rule that makes sense, ResLife creates an illogical and stupid rule that classifies all drinking -legal or illegal -as a violation of du Lac on or before football games. 
I applaud all attempts to stamp out alcohol abuse. I feel that Notre Dame has every right to enforce Indiana liquor laws. But telling 21-year olds that they cannot enjoy alcohol in a responsi­ble manner is asinine. 
If ResLlfe officials are really concerned about alcohol abuse, they need to enforce laws designed to end alcohol abuse. Indiana has already passed many laws designed to curb alcohol abuse ­Notre Dame does not need to expand on these rules. 
But Notre Dame should also encourage stu­dents that do use alcohol to do so responsibly. Citing every 21-year old with a beer, regardless of blood alcohol level, is not accomplishing this goal. It is only turning the NDSP into mindless ticket writers.

Princeton ·analyzes Bush/Gore election one year later 
PRINCETON, N.J. 
While millions of Americans are headed for the polls Tuesday to cast their vote for candidates from gover­nors to congressmen to city council­men there will be no punch marks or levers pulled for presidential candi­dates this year. . 
One year after one of the most con­tested presidential elections in histo­ry, few Americans seem to remember the turmoil of Bush v. Gore. 
I.t was an election many analysts said would taint the new president with illegitimacy and contaminate the Supreme Court with partisanship. But after the shock and anger stem­ming from the attacks on Sept. 11, America has become a united, patri­otic country proud of its political institutions and leader, President George W. Bush. 

"I think the irony is that an election that seemed fated to give us a presi­dent who would be deemed illegiti­mate is virtually forgotten," noted politics professor Fred Greenstein, an expert on the American presidency. "Even before Sept. 11, Bush was accepted by the bulk of the public and all of the nation's major political actors." 
The Bush presidency has garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats. Politicians who once bickered over social security and taxes are cooperating on some issues and at least refraining from criticiz­ing the Bush Administration. 
"Since [Sept. 11) he has been the beneficiary of the 'rally around the president' effect that regularly occurs in times of international crisis and has the highest public approval rat­ings in the history of the presidency," Greenstein said. 
Last year, like the election 200 years earlier, the presidential voting was deadlocked. Two candidates claimed victory. 


HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
Bush limits public's access to records 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
President Bush's order Monday granting former presi­dents greater authority to withhold records requested by historians and other researchers is causing discontent among academics, who say the government is illegiti­mately blocking access to valuable resources. The order is a modification of the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires disclosure of particularly sensitive records 12 years after presidents have left office. Bush and White House officials say these measures are being put in place to ensure that no information will be released which could lead to a breach in national securi­ty. But some historians and scholars see the order as a smokescreen for the Bush administration's desire to con­ceal potentially embarrassing records from past admin­istrations. The records, scholars claim, contain no infor­mation that would assist a terrorist attack. Some histori­ans point out that there are strict exemptions that keep important information protected from the public.

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
Admissions office delays deadlines 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 

As anthrax scares plague the mail service, high school seniors are facing difficulties ensuring their col­lege applications arrive on time. As such, the University of Virginia admissions office has joined other schools across the nation in delaying its early decision application deadline. Applications postmarked as late as Nov. 8 still will be accepted, as opposed to the usual Nov. 1 deadline. Admissions officials made the decision because anthrax scares and new safety measures slowed mail traffic, particularly on the East Coast. "Applicants deserve the necessary amount of time to prepare, and our application is not one that you do lightly," Dean of Admissions John A. Blackburn said. Blackburn said he anticipates receiving more early decision applications this year than in the past. "The high school population is growing. And because of a declining economy, public colleges are becoming a more popular option than private schools," he said.

Workers at the facilitv were surprised when the inspector. who did not immediately iden­tify herself, began to record temperature problems and poor food storage, said Deborah Colley, assistant gen­eral manager of the University Club. 
~·when you're in the middle of serving 100 people, things aren't always-the way they're supposed to be," said Colley. 
Part of the seemingly disar­rayed state of the kitchen, according to Colley, was due to the busy lunch hour when workers were constantly opening and closing refrigera­tors.

Hooton said the inspector that visited the University Club is on medical leave, but she will address the inspec­tor's behavior when the inspector returns.

WASHINGTON 
Struggling to reverse the slide in the American economy, or at least slow it, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates today by half a percentage point, to 2 percent, the lowest level since the 1960's. 
In a statement explain­ing the rate cut, the Fed's policymakers said that "heightened uncertainty and concerns about a dete­rioration in business con­ditions both here and abroad are damping eco­nomic activity." 
Wall Street analysts 

interpreted the half-point cut as determination, par­ticularly on the part of Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, to go all out in reviving an economy that had been weak before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and grew weaker from the blow. 
"The message is pretty clear," said James Glassman, chief domestic economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. "They are quite uncertain about what is going on in the economy, and they are not going to err on the side of caution." 
The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks for the 10th time this year, to 2 percent. It also dropped its discount rate on loans the Fed makes to banks by half a point, to 1. 5 percent. 
Not since the presidency of John F. Kennedy in 1961 has the overnight rate been as low. 
In its statement, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market said it still sees the economic downturn rather than inflation as the main threat. "For the foresee­able future, then, the com­mittee continues to believe that, against the back­ground of its long-run goals of price stability and 

sustainable  economic  
growth and of the informa­ 
tion currently available,  
the  risks  are  weighted  
mainly toward conditions  
that may generate eco­ 
nomic weakness," it said.  
The statement was not a  
surprise, since even before  
the  Sept.  11  terrorist  
attacks, the economy had  
been slowing since the  
heady days that ended  
around the spring of 2000.  
"The objective here is  
growth, growth, growth as  
soon as possible, and everything else is out the  
window," said Ian Shepherdson, an econo­mist at High F-requency  l l j

Afghan rebels capture territory 
Associated Press 
AFGHANISTAN 
Northern Alliance officials claimed today to have captured three districts near the strategic northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif after what they said was extensive involvement by United States military advisers in the attacks. 
If confirmed, the capture would be the opposition's biggest breakthrough since the United States began its bombing campaign nearly a month ago, a New York Times correspon­dent, Dexter Filkins, reported from Khoja Bahauddin, near Afghanistan's border with Tajikistan. 
Northern Alliance troops captured the districts of Zari, Aqukupurk and Keshendeh after a short but intense overnight battle, a top opposition aide, Qudratullah Hurmat, said by satellite phone today. 
Keshendeh, the capital of Baluch Province, which borders Uzbekistan, is some 25 miles south of Mazar-i­Sharif, which the opposition has tried in vain to recapture from the Taliban. 
There was no independent verifica­tion of the attacks. Asked about the attacks today at a 
Pentagon briefing, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he liked "to let the dust settle" before comment­ing on such reports. 
The number of United States forces on the ground in Afghanistan has more than doubled since last week, and more are preparing to go in when weather and circumstances on the ground permit, Mr. Rumsfeld said. 
The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported five people from both sides were killed in the fighting for Zari, but, again, independent confir­mation could not be obtained.

Forest who also is sec­retary of the Orthodox Peace Fellowship, joined the Catholic Worker community in New York City in 1961 after being discharged from the Navy on grounds of con­scientious objection. 
He edited the commu­nity's newspa-per, The Catholic Worker, and worked as a reporter for Religious News Service and for the daily Staten Island Advance. An outspoken opponent of the war in Vietnam, he was imprisoned from 1969-70 for his involve­ment with the Milwaukee Fourteen, a group of Catholic priests and lay people who burned draft records. Forest and Father Merton, a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Gethsemane in Kentucky, corresponded lengthily and became friends during their mutual involvement in the anti-war movement of the 1960s.

The Federal Heserve dropped a kev interest rate to iis lowest level in ·40 years as it hauled to prevent the "heightened uncertainty" fol­lowing the terrorist attacks from sending the country into a deep recession. 
The Fed on Tuesday slashed its federal funds rate, the key bench­mark for overnight loans, hy a half­point to 2 percent and signaled that it was prepared to continue cutting if conditions deteriorate further. 
"The Fed is telling us they are really worried and they will likely move again at their December meeting," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. 
Wall Street rallied on the news, given that investors had been split over whether the Ped would move by a half-point or a quarter-point.

The government reported last week that the gross domestic prod­uct declined at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the July-September quar­ter. Many analysts believe the pace of the downturn will accelerate to a drop of 2 percent or more in the current quarter. A recession is tra­ditionally defined as two consecu­tive quarters of falling GDP. 
Job cuts in October alone totaled 415,000, the biggest one-month total in 21 years. 
The concern is that the hundreds of thousands of job layoffs that have occurred since the Sept. 11 attacks will trigger a sharp reduction in consumer spending as more people recession.

Many economists argued that the Fed's aggressivemoves, along with the massivo tax cut Presidont Bush pushed through Congross last spring and an additional $100 bil­lion in economic stimulus now being debated in Congress, should bf-l enough to assure an end to the recession next year. 
However, while many analysts had expect11d the rnhound to occur in the lirst three months of' next year, the recent string of bad statistics has caused some analysts to predict the recession will last into spring, with the unemployment rate, which shot up to 5.4 pP-rcont in October, topping 6 percent before the recovery begins. 
Analysts believe tho rocession will not be worse than the 1990-91 d<}Wll­turn, which lasted nine months, although they cautioned that it could feel worse to many people given that unemployment had dropped to a 30­ycar low of 3.9 percent last year. 
"While tho data are unmistakably dismal, this is so-far simply a normal recession,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock in Boston. "There is every reason to think that vigorous monetary and fiscal stimulus will produce a vigorous recovery."

First Minister David 
Trimble returned to 
power Tuesday as leader 
of a Northern Ireland gov­
ernment saved from the 
brink of rollapsr. 
Trimble's re-election by 
the lawmakers gave a 
new lease on life to the 
Protestant-Catholic coali­
tion at the heart of the 
peace process. It came 
four days after Prornstant 
hard-liners threatened to 
bring down the power­
sharing government by 
blorking his return to 
office. 
"We will carry through 
the work. and ½·e will not

tracted by the sort of mob

descend to," said Trimble.

Barely 10 feet away, Protestant lawmakers opposed to his re-election jostled and traded insults with Catholic politicians.

a rare state of affairs 
sinc·e Trimble agreed 
nearly two years ago to 
lead his Ulster Unionist 
Party into a coalition with 
Catholics, including the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein. 
The government had 
been shelved three times 
in disputes about when. if 
ever, Sinn Fein's allies in 
the Irish Republican Army 
would support power­
sharing and peacemaking 
by starting to disarm. 
Now, following the IRA's 
start to scrapping 
weapons and Trimble's 
willingness to resume 
power-sharing in 
response, key planks of 
the 1998 peace accord 
appear finally to be falling 
into place.

Reid. "But there is at least 
now the prospe1;t that the 
institutions will work 
effectively and inclusively 
as the agrnement always 
intended,'' 
It looked different on 
Fridav. when Protestant 
hard:liners led by the 
Hev. Ian Paisley blocked Trimble's re-election. 

While Trimble. leader of the largest Protestant party. the Ulster Unionists, received unani­mous support from the Catholic legislators, he also required majority backing from his own side -where Im fell one vote short. 
That raised the likeli­hood that Britain would havp to strip power from local hands on Saturday, the deadlinn for Trimble's post to be filled. Instead, Britain pressured a small neutral party, Alliance, to allow a few of its member to briefly join the Protestant voting bloc for an unprecedented second vote. · 
With Lhrcc Alliance law­makers behind him. Trimble won the Protestant vote 31-29. The result also confirmed Mark Durkan. a moderate Catholic, as the adminis­tration's No. 2 figure. deputy first minister. 
Paisley's Democratic Unionists refused to accept the result. They stormed into the lobby of the Stormont Parliamentary Building just seconds behind Trimble and Durkan. and hurled abuse as the two attempted to give their victory speeches. 
"You're a cheater!" shouted Ian Paisley Jr. "You're in the pocket of the Provos!" accused another Democratic Unionist, Paul Berry, using the local nickname for the IRA. 
Paisley's supporters had hoped that, by keeping the 12-member Cabinet's top two posts unfilled, Britain would have to dis­solve the entire 108-legis­lature in favor-of a new Northern Ireland-wide election. 
Citing growing Protestant opposition to working with Sinn Fein, Paislev·s Democratic Union(sts are aiming to outpoll Trimble's Ulster Unionists and become the largest party -putting Paisley in line to be first minister and pull the plug on power-sharing for good. 
But Reid. who retains considerable power in Northern Ireland because the province remains part of the United Kingdom, announced Tuesday that as far as he was con­cerned. Paisley would have to wait. He said he had no intention of calling a nt>w legislative election until the end of its full term -May 1. 20(R

M v e r s Squibb's patent has expired. but ABI says it has a claim on the drug, too. and says that claim is still in force. 
The FDA argued that ABl's patent claim was not filed on time and therefore is not valid. But after analyzing the com­plex regulatory law, the judges disagreed and said the FDA was wrong to ignore the claim. 
"We are convinced that the FDA's order, in this case. was arbitrary and capricious and must be vacated," wrote Judge Laurence Silberman for a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
Specifically, the order instructs the district court to order the FDA to rescind its approval, but that hasn't hap­pened yet. 
Ivax said it would ask the full appeals court to reconsid­er Tuesday's ruling.

In the last year, the FDA has approved two other generic forms of Taxol. While· the court's action does not directly affect them, the FDA used the same reasoning in approving those applications. 
Ivax President Neil Flanzraich would not say how much his company charges for its version of the drug but said it was 30 to 40 percent less than Taxol, which can r.ost $5,000 to $7.000 per person. He said the court's ac:tion would hurt consumers.

The Dork Theory 
Guess what? You're a dork. Don't believe me? Think about for a minute. 
Still not convinced? Remember this morning when you were alone in your room listening to music? Remember when you started to sing along and maybe even dance or play a lit tlc air guitar? Remember when you were walking through the quad and you 
Joe Larson 

saw someone you have met before but don't know if they remember you? Remember how you awkwardly looked 
The Principles 

up at them and then back down at the 
ofJdiocracy

ground and then back up at them again? Remember how as they passed by you kind of halfway cocked your head which could signify acknowledgement, but in case they weren't looking it didn't look like anything? 
Still no? How about the time you vomited all over that 
unsuspecting sober girl at a party? How about the fact that you own all three Spin Doctors albums? Had enough? 
Okay. ( know what you're thinking: how can these things make me a dork? Everyone does them. 
Yes. Exactly. And tha.t's what Dork Theory is: Everyone (absolutely everyone, no exceptions. Except for maybe U2, they wail) is a dork. Every single living, breathing human being on the face of the Earth is a dork. Try me. Clint Eastwood ­pretty cool, right? No, dork. He was in Bridges of Madison County. Bruce Willis? Look Who's Talking. 
How about politics? Clinton. Selfexplanato· ry. George W. Big ears, looks like the cartoon character from MAD magazine. Abraham . l~ Lincoln? Beards like that are only cool on lep· --....c...:::.~~ 
rechauns. 
And I'm sure these known cool guys and world leaders have tons of other little dorky quirks to go along with these more obvious ones. It doesn't mean they're bad people. These are the things that make them regular people. Even Batman had to wear blue underwear over gray tights before he got the badass black rubber suit. The point is that no matter how cool a person may seem, there is always something about them that negates the coolness; hence, they are no more cool than anyone else. Whoever you are and however good you are at concealing your dorky quirks, they are pre­sent and therefore you are a dork. 
But wait, you contest. if every single one of us has dorky quirks, then why are we all dorks? Aren't we just normal? 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Simple shirt solutions 
Over the last week or so, much talk has been made about what color shirts we should wear to home football games. Is it blue? Is it green? What is it? 
The real problem with the whole effort is a communica­tion problem; most alumni simply don't hear about the effort until game day, and by that point, nobody wants to waste time buying a shirt that they feel is going to be used for one or two games. 
Here's are three potential solutions. First, when tickets are distributed next season, the athletic department could include a pamphlet outlining what color should be worn to the games and why this effort is being undertaken. The selected color &hould not change throughout the season, and The Shirt should be a matching color. The second potential solution, which would be more effective, would be to make some simple shirts and to sell them for cost, proba­bly about $5, all over the outside and inside of the stadium on game day -n~t simply in the bookstore. Finally, our 
Fair point, but no. Dorky quirks are normal (to have, not the quirks themselves; those will never be normal), but the acceptance of them is not. See. since people in the world choose to shroud their dorkiness from the public, they ulti­mately prohibit a dork from being normal. These cowardly "Shrouders" arc the problem. These people walk around pre­tending to be cool when they are, in fact, dorks. Everyone knows these people. You may even be one. These are the people who are always perfect every time you see them. They never trip. They're never wrong about anything, ever. Their hair is always in exactly the right place. If they wanted, they could probably grow full beards, or fly like a bird -whatev­er. These people may even act like they are so cool that they can't be bothered with the likes of you because you clearly possess faults. Your hair may not be so perfect. Your facial hair may be accurately categorized as "squirrelly." You may 
actually like the Spin Doctors. 

What needs to happen is an overall understand­ing and acceptance of dorkiness. "Shrouders" need to realize that their dorky quirks don't make them bad; they make them original. And it's much better to be original than phony. 
Now don't misunderstand me here. I'm not asking for everyone to share every little dorky quality with everyone else. Some things should mosl definite­ly be left alone. If you like to do calis­thenics in nothing but a sombrero 
before you go to bed, that's fine, but 
that is probably a dorky quirk that you should only share with yourself. What I'm asking for is. that everyone just be comfort­
able with their own dorkiness. Realize you are not the cool person you project yourself to be. Realize you have personal qualities that may 
seem a little weird to others. Realize this and know that you are no cooler than anyone else and they are no cool­er than you. My grandmother used to say, "Everyone's a little weird." And I think she's completely right. 
Think about it. You're a dork. That's what makes you who you are. So stop trying to hide it and embrace the dorkiness that is you. 
Joe Larson is a senior English and History major. He would like to take this opportunity to reinforce "Dork Theory" by admitting that the person who owns all three Spin Doctors albums mentioned above was not made up. It was him. And he's not ashamed to admit it. 
The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author 
coach (whoever that may be next season) needs to energize the fans and rally them behind this effort. 
I saw a photo of Texas A&M's stadium earlier this year, when a group of students banded together and organized an effort to make patriotic shirts for the entire stadium. They sold the shirts for a price that was about $5 each. The picture of that stadium was one of the most impressive sites I have ever seen, with one tier of the stadium red, another white, and another blue. 
I challenge someone in the athletic department to consid­er implementing one of these solutions next season. It will bring the stadium together, make it louder, and make Notre Dame a tougher place to play for our opponents.

ACEing Life's Trials 
Ryan Smith is still praying for my cousin. 
My cousin had surgery about a month ago related to Crone's disease. That, in and of itself, is not terribly significant. The fact that Ryan Smith -a kid with memory and reading dis­abilities so severe that his teachers must read his tests to him and write him reminders about what to bring from class to class -has remembered my special intention from a month ago and is still praying for my cousin L'l significant. 
Ryan is one of the sixth graders I teach at St. Vincent de Paul school in Mobile, Alabama. As an Alliance for Catholic Education teacher, I "have to" and "get to" spend time with Hyan and SO-something other kids just like him everyday. 
I say that "I have to" spend time with them somewhat negatively because some days it is a real chore to bear with these students. They pass notes with mean rumors and gossip. They lift their legs to secretly break wind. They forget things I tell them a hundred times. They make fun ofme in hushed whispers. They drive me crazy. 
Sometimes at the end of the day lessons I have spent hours preparing are not remembered by my students as fondly as a shot a fellow pupil takes to the twigs and berries at recess. Those are the days 1 wonder, "Why am I an ACE teacher?" On those days, I hang,m}'head and wonder where is tbe reward in this? 
Then I remember that Ryan Smith is still praying for my cousin. 
The reward on those days is that I feel "I get to" spend time with the kids rather than "l have to" teach. On those days the student who is hard to reach will tie it all together and answer a question correctly. On those days par­ents will mention how much they appreciate what I am doing for their son or daughter. I will catch kids doing acts of kindness to each other instead of punching one another behind my back. They remember their manners and their homework on those days. On those special days when the cafeteria serves lasagna, the kids all pass the test and the student council elections come off without a hitch. Those are the days I love being an ACE teacher. 
Is ACE for you? I can't tell you that. If you are looking to do service after you graduate, if you like kids and if you are really, really patient, it might be. If you think teachers only work from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon and are looking for an easy job, it might not be what you are after. 
The best way to find out if meeting and working with kids like Ryan as an ACE teacher would tickle your post­graduate fancy would be to meet John Staud and the rest of the inspiring Alliance for Catholic Education staff this Thursday. Pay good attention, ask a lot of questions and eat all the free food ACE offers, because they will expect a 1ot in return. There will be a lot of challenges and there will be some of "those days" described above. But there are a lot of rewards too. 
Maybe next year a student like Ryan Smith will be praying for your special intention.

Unfounded claims 


·are invalid 
The letter published by Andrew Oxenreiter in last Thursday's Observer was repulsive. Andy wrote a rather biased let­ter filled with all sorts of legalese to attempt to cover the thinly veiled malice with which he wrote. I hold no shame in being blunt and forthcoming with my dis­gust for the thoughts that he penned. 
He wrote, "Due to an unfortunate situa­tion of late regarding a fellow member of the Notre Dame family ..." when simply writing, "My friend got in trouble for" would have certainly sufficed -such ver­bosity, Andrew. The appeal to the glorious Notre Dame family will be addressed later. 
A later claim: "This (presumed guilt of accused parties) means that any student, male or female, may accuse another stu­dent of sexual assault on the slightest impulse, for whatever reason. and the accused student could be found guilty regardless of the evidence or lack thereof.'' I intensely disliked Andrew's letter. Could I accuse him of sexual assault for that rea­son? Maybe he would be convicted; of course he probably would not be found guilty due to the "lack of justice that our present system provides." 
"One might be under the impression that a situation such as this would never occur, where an individual creates a false allegation in order to appear victimized." Later Andrew implies that the victim in this incident is an exception to this notion. When would a person create these false allegations? What benefit is gained? Wouldn't the victim be better off just keep­ing quiet? 
Mr. Oxenreiter appeals· on separate occa­sions to the Notre Dame family, Christianity, and America. One might sug­gest that when a person violates the digni­ty of another member of the Notre Dame family, he or she forfeits membership in that family. Andrew attempts to hide his perverted thought behind the dome, flag and cross. in that order. 
I sympathize with some of Andy's argu­ments. Legally his position is very sound. Sexual misconduct often serves as a diffi­cult charge to support with physical evi­dence. I also appreciate his desire to limit claims of sexual misconduct only to cases where sexual misconduct has taken place. The major problem is that Andrew never distinguishes this case from an unfounded case. Why should I not believe this person? 
At different points in the letter, Andy wants me to support him because the claimant is "vindictive," "manipulative," "capable of a blatantly wrong act," "irre­sponsible," and "dishonest." In addition, she has hurt the cause of later women who may be actually victimized by sexual assault (for she was obviously not). Finally, she is one who "can't come to terms with [her] own promiscuity." Why not use "whore" or "slut?" Certainly those terms are the ones bandied about when you and your friend discuss her. 
The real problem is that Mr. Oxenreiter knows as well as 1what went on between his friend and the other party -absolutely nothing. He was not there. Neither was I. Of course, I did not write a letter to be published in a public forum calling Andrew and his crony thoughtless. degenerate · idiots. Unlike Andy, I do not have evidence to support a claim of this sort.

God can be found outside of church 
This summer my church was located in a dilapidated office building in the impov­erished community of Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. This was the location of the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force (PATF) and the home ofmy summer internship. As a student at Notre Dame with theology as a second major and someone who has always taken her Catholic faith seriously, I was not expecting PATF to have such an influence on teaching me how to be a better Catholic. 
Two very different scenarios demonstrate how the Pittsburgh 
Nora Jones
AIDS Task Force showed me how to live faithfully everyday. Scene I: The setting is my home parish church on a bright Sunday morning. Hundreds are present. Many straggle in after

priest's reflection on the Gospel while others balance their check books to pass the time. We exchange a sign of peace and most people shake hands with the others around them without ever looking into the eye of the person they are touching. Some let the incredibly powerful meaning of Jesus' tremendous sacrifice for us sink in during the Eucharistic celebration, while most go through the motions, not allowing the significance of the Sacrament to move them at all. The Mass ends and there is a mad rush for the parking lot as very few stay to sing the last verse of the exit hymn. God's name has been mentioned often during the hour we are there. 
Scene II: It is a muggy Wednesday at the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. There are many clients to be seen. One is a transgendered person who comes to use the food pantry but stays to talk because there is no one else in her life who knows she is battling this fatal illness. She is respected by the PATF staff and encouraged to please come back. Another client has found a job but cannot afford the clothes needed for it. His case manager connects him to a place he can go for clothing. He is grateful. Another client calls from jail and asks for assistance from one of PATF's volunteer lawyers. Another client is a drug addict fighting two diseases at the same time. The Task Force's door is open to all of them, discriminating against no one ­regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or income level. During the whole day there is no mention of God's name. 
The first scene is in a church. The second setting claims no religious affiliation at all. Yet it is the latter that clear.Jy stands out as doing the work of God. In compar­ing these two scenes. I am reminded of the Bible story in Matthew 21:28.-31. 
Jesus teaches: "A man had two sons. He went and said to the first. 'My boy, you go and work in the vineyard today.' Ile answered, 'I will not go,' but aftcrwar_ds thought better of it and went. The man then went and said the same thing to the second who answered, 'Certainly, sir,' but did not go. Which of the two did the father's will? 'The first,' they said." 
The Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force is akin to the first son, not claiming to follow God's will but doing it nonetheless. My parish church proudly proclaims to house faithful people while so many among us do not even rejoice in God on Sunday, a day set aside for the Lord. I am confident that God is present in both places at all times. There are many incredible people who go to my church who I am not giving enough credit to in this analogy. However, I draw the analogy as a sharp contrast in order to illustrate how much more my daily job affected my faith than did my attendance on Sundays at my parish. 
I saw the staff of the Task Force more clearly doing the will of God because they welcomed every type of person. The door was open for everyone -including drag queens, drug addicts and of course, homosexuals. I do not know if I could say that of my church. I am saddened at the thought of the reaction my church might have if one of those people walked through the door. I hope they would prove me wrong, but judging by my conversations with homosexual staff members at PATF, 1 doubt they would feel welcome. 
Ubi caritas et arnor, Deus ibi est is. "Wherever there is charity and love, there is God." Charity and love are endless at PATF and the presence of God is strongly felt. I am so grateful to have met the staff of PATF and so many of their clients this past summer. l thank them for being my faith-teachers. 
I also thank the Center for Social Concerns for providing me with an opportunity to learn like this over the summer. As an RA this year, I think my section gets tired of my constant pleas to just walk throughthe door ofthe CSC -I have assured all of them that it will impact their college careers and undoubtedly their lives. 1 would encourage anyone to look at what the CSC offers over breaks but most especially what is offered during the summer. The Summer Service Project Internship, the International Summer Service Learning Program, ACCION and others are all incred­ible summer opportunities -ones that have changed the way I think, learn and practice my faith. I feel blessed by the opportunities I have participated in at the Center, and my hope is that no one leaves Notre Dame without participating in just one thing that the CSC offers. It will truly be unforgettable!

NHL 
Islanders short out Lightning at home, 3-0 
... 
> 
-
As,ociaLCd Press 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. 

Michael Peca scored a short-handed goal and Shawn Bates scored one on a power play as the New York Islanders beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 3-0. 
Brad Isbister scored an emply-nct goal with 1:35 remaining for the [slanders, who are 11-1-1-1. Last sea­son, it took them until Dec. 29 to get to 11 wins, and until Jan. 13 to get their 12th. 
Adrian Aucoin, who played for Tampa Bay last season, had two assists. Peca extended his point streak to six games, and Mark Parrish extend­ed his to nine with an assist on Bates' goal. 
Chris Osgood, who had 29 saves for his third shutout, and the Isles defense have held opponents to under two goals for nine straight games and 11 out of 14 this season. 
With just over two minutes remain­ing, Osgood just missed an empty-net goal of his own when his sweeping shot trickled down ice and tipped off the left post. 
Peca put the Islanders up 1-0 at 4:40 of the second period. He won a faceoff in the Islanders' zone and Aucoin scooped the puck just past the blue line where Peca could get his stick on it. Peca, skating down the right side, and Bates, skating down the center, led a trail of Tampa Bay players. Peca appeared poised to pass to Bates the whole way down the ice, but at the right circle Peca snapped the puck high into the far side of net. 
With 7:30 left in the third period, Aucoin took a shot from the point, the 
rebound was tipped by Parrish, but Bates put it high from the. left side of net. 
The first period was full of near-miss­es for the Islanders, who had just eight shots on goal but also had many breathtaking tries that flew just wide. Osgood had to make just two stops in the first period. 
Tampa Bay had a spirited rally after the short-handed goal, outshooting the Isles 9-0 to finally test Osgood. The Islanders went more than 11 minutes without taking a shot, but retained the lead when Tampa Bay couldn't· take advantage. 
Rangers 3, Wild 1 
Theo Fleury had a goal and an assist, and Mike Richter made 23 saves to lead the New York Rangers to a victory over the Minnesota Wild. 
Flcury's goal, his fifth, gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead at 15:47 of the thil"d period. Fleury followed Mike York on a rush into the Minnesota zone and redi­rected York's pass past goalie Manny Fernandez from close range. 
The Wild pulled within 2-1 when Pascal Dupuis scored his first goal of the season at 11:14 of the third period. With Minnesota on the power play, Sergei Zholtok sent a centering pass from behind the net to Dupuis, who blasted a shot from the inside of the left circle into the top corner of the net. 
It spoiled another shutout chance for Richter, who hasn't blanked an oppo­nent since Feb. 26, 1999, a 136-game span. 
Eric Lindros gave New York a 1-0 lead 3:20 in with his sixth goal. Fleury intercepted a clearing pass in the 
Minnesota zone and took a wrist shot that Lindros redirected past Fernandez. New York led after the first period for 
the first time this season. 
The Rangers took a 2-0 lead when Steve McKenna. in his Rangers debut. scored his first goal of the season at 
17:31 of the second period. Jeff Toms circled behind the net and sent a pass across the goal mouth, where McKenna smacked it past Fernandez. 
McKenna, who played with the Wild last season, had not scored an NHL goal since last Nov. 12. He was recalled from Hartford of the AHL on Sunday. 
The Wild average 22 shots a game, the fewest in the league, but forced Richter to make a number of quality saves. Richter denied two shots in quick succession against Jim Dowd and Willie Mitchell in the third period. 
Canucks 3, Blue Jackets 2 
Todd Bertuzzi scored a goal and had an assist in his first game back from a 10-game suspension as the Vancouver Canucks beat the Columbus Blue Jackets. 
Ed Jovanovski and Brendan Morrison also each had a goal and an assist, and Markus Naslund had two assists. 
Dan Cloutier, who made 26 saves, and the Canucks weathered two late Columbus power plays after the Blue Jackets pulled within a goal. After Columbus pulled goaltender Marc Denis, the Blue Jackets had a 6-on-4 advantage for the final 1:08. 
Bertuzzi had to sit out since leaving the bench to join a fight during the Canucks' game against Colorado on Oct. 13. Vancouver was 3-6-1 during his suspension. 
Bcrtuzzi's power-play goal late in the second period helped the Canucks end a five-game road losing skid. 
Columbus lost its fifth in a row at home -and.have been outscored 23-6. The Blue Jackets are 0-5-2-0 this year at Nationwide Arena. 
The Blue Jackets were scoreless on seven power plays, and are 1-for-36 with a man advantage at home. 
Denis was holding onto a 1-0 lead through the first 35 minutes until Jovanovski's shot from the point was redirected by Bertuzzi at the 15:07 mark for his second goal of the season. Harold Druken also picked up an assist. 
Less than 2 minutes later, the Canucks took the lead for good with an even-strength goal. 
After a giveaway by Columbus defenseman Mattias Timander, Naslund ended up with a breakaway that Denis stopped with his left knee pad. With Denis sprawled in the crease, Morrison got a stick on the puck with Jovanovski coming in late to jam it in. 
Jovanovski's fifth goal came with three minutes left in the second period. 
Columbus, last in the NHL on the power play at home and next to last on the penalty kill, scored a short-handed goal to take an early 1-0 lead. 
Espen Knutsen took a lead pass from Robert Kron and beat Cloutier at 11:37 of the first period. 
Cloutier, who had missed the Canucks' last game with a slight groin pull, was in control most of the game the rest of the way. He allowed Sean Pronger's goal with 6:35 remaining. 
Vancouver added an insurance goal midway through the third on Morrison's one-timer in the slot from Naslund.

scoring average, most money on tour 
Associated P re.ss 
HOUSTON 

Tiger Woods won the Vardon Trophy on Sunday, the third consec­
utlve season he has had the lowest scoring average on the PGA Tour. 
Woods also won the PGA Tour money title for the third straight season, making him the first player since Tom Watson from 1977-79 to sweep golfs two biggest indicators for three straight years. 
"It wasn't quite as good as last year, but it was still a pretty darn good year," Woods said after finishing the Tour Championship in a tie for 13th. 
Woods was coming off a record-setting season, winning 12 times around the world -nine of those on the PGA Tour -including three straight majors. 
He set the record for the adjusting scoring average at 68.17, and won the Vardon Trophy this year with an average adjusted score of 
68.81. Davis Love III was second at 69.06. Woods won the money title with nearly $5.7 million. down from $9.1 million last year. "When I won 12 times around the world ... it's kind of hard to 
duplicate," Woods said. Still, he had few complaints. Woods won five times on the PGA Tour, twice more than anyone 
else. He went five tournaments without winning -the longest he has gone to start a season in his professional career -but then won three straight.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL NFL 
Williams selected as top All-American 
Associated Press 
Jason Williams, who led Duke to the national championship last season, was a unanimous selection Tuesday to The Associated Press pre­season All­America team, the first player on every ballot since 1996. 
The junior guard was joined on the team by Stanford's Casey Jacobsen, like Williams a returning first-team All American; Missouri's Kareem Rush; Frank Williams of Illinois; and Kentucky's Tayshaun Prince, the lone senior selected. 
Jason Williams was on each of the 72 ballots from the national media panel that selects the weekly college basketball poll, becoming the first unanimous preseason pick since Tim Duncan of Wake Forest five years ago. · 
Williams averaged 21.6 points last season -the first Blue Devil to lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring since Danny Ferry in 1989 N 3.3 rebounds and 6.1 assists. 
He was the only player to rank in the top 20 nationally in scor­ing (15th) and assists (19th) as Duke won its third national championship. 
The top-ranked Blue Devils lost national player of the year Shane Battier and fifth-year for­ward Nate James, but Williams, who averaged 25.7 points in the NCAA Tournament, will lead the way as they try to become the first team to repeat since Duke did it in 1992. 
"We want it just as bad as last year," Williams said. "It's like putting your fingertip in honey and tasting it and never getting a chance to do it again. You say, 'I want it again really bad."' 
Rush, the preseason Big 12 player of the year, was the sec­ond-leading vote-getter with 47, one more than Prince and two more than Jacobsen. 


-
The 6-foot-6 Rush led the con­ference in scoring last season with a 21.1 average. His run at national postseason honors was hurt when he missed seven games with a thumb injury on his shooting (left) hand. 
Rush, an honorable-mention pick last season. scored 29 points in the Tigers' 94-81 loss to Duke in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. 
"Even though people are talk­ing about him the way they are now, he should still get better. And he can," Missouri coach Quin Snyder said. "There is a lot more there." 
Prince, the Southeastern Conference player of the year. withdrew his name from the NBA draft to return for his senior season with the Wildcats. The 6-9 Prince belied his thin frame by playing at power for­ward last season and wound up a second-team All-American after averaging 16.9 points and 
6.5 rebounds. 

Jacobsen is going to draw a lot of attention from opposing defenses this season as the only returning starter for the Cardinal. 
The 6-6 swingman averaged 
18.1 points in a balanced offense as he became Stanford's first-ever All-American. He'll look for his shot more and that's not a bad thing considering he hit 51 percent from the field, including 47 percent from 3­point range. 
Frank Williams returns to the Fighting Illini after being select­ed Big Ten player of the year and a third-team All-American. 
The 6-3 guard, who averaged 
14.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 
4.4 assists, already has said he will enter the NBA draft after this season. Last season ended on a sour note when he went 3­for-15 from the field in the 87­81 loss to Arizona in the region­al final. 
Three members of last year's preseason team -Battier, Troy Murphy of Notre Dame and Joseph Forte of North Carolina -went on to be first-team All­Americans, while Jamaal Tinsley of Iowa State was picked for the second team and Loren Woods of Arizona was an honor­able mention selection. 
Saints slap Turley with $25,000 fine 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS 
It wasn't as bad as it could have been -New Orleans Saints coach Jim Haslett originally thought about cutting tackle Kyle Turley or at le~t suspending him. But it was no slap on the wnst either. 
Turley was fined $25,000 for conduct detrimen­tal to the team during Sunday's game against the New York Jets. 
Turley has also agreed to undergo counseling at the team's request. 
Turley attacked Jets safety Damien Robin~on when Robinson grabbed the face mask of Samts quarterback Aaron Brooks and twisted it. Turley ripped Robinson's helmet off and threw it down­field, then made an obscene gesture. His actions got him tossed out of the game. They also drew a 15-yard penalty that ended the Saints' final chance to tie or win the game. The Saints lost 16-9. 
''The Saints do not condone such· actions," gen­eral manager Randy Mueller said Tuesday. "We believe that the amount of the fine is appropriate for the severity of Kyle's conduct on the field. We understand that Kyle is a very emotional player, but it is clear that the type of actions he demon­strated last Sunday will not be tolerated." 
Mueller said that Turley will not be suspended by the Saints and is expected to play Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. 
"Unfortunately Kyle's actions cost us a chance to possibly win a game," Mueller said. "I would hope that the lesson learned here will bring our team together." 
Turley also faces disciplinary action from the NFL. 
Turley was composed, but not contrite, when he spoke to th 3 media Monday. 
"It was a very emotional outburst on my part that I nead to be a little more mature about," Turley said. "But I cannot apologize for defending my quarterback and trying to, basically, from my point of view, save his life. The guy was seriously trying to break hLc; neck." 
Trailing 16-9, the Saints marched to the Jets' 6­yard line in the final minute of the game. On sec­ond-and-3, Brooks ran to the 5-yard line only to be stopped by Robinson, who grabbed Brooks' face mask. 
"I figured I had him bent back when I heard Brooks scream," Robinson said. ''Then I let him go." 
Turley had a different take on the situation. 
"I came up on the play and the guy started twist­ing Aaron's head back and he started screaming," Turley said. "I've never been placed in a situation like that before where I sec my quarterback get­ting his head turned around like the exorcist." 
Turley, who turned 26 in September, jumped into the pile, grabbing Robinson and eventually his helmet. He emerged without his own helmet, but still clutching Robinson·s, which he flung down­field before making an obscene gesture. By that time the field was littered with players, oflidals and yellow flags. 
"l felt like Turley was trying to break my neck," Robinson said. 
"They pulled my hair, the bunch of girls," Turley responded. "I got turf burn on my head. I've never had turf burn on my head. They were trying to get me when I was down." 
There were offsetting penalties for personal fouls, but Turley, who was thrown out of the game, drew a second 15-yard penalty for throwing the helmet and making the obscene gesture. That put New Orleans on the 20-yard line and ended the scoring threat. 
"Driving home (Sunday) night I was thinking about cutting him," Haslett said. "Last night, lay­ing in bed, I thought about suspending him. I didn't see the whole incident on the field. Then I saw it on TV where Damien Robinson was trying to pull Aaron's head off. Then I talked to Aaron about it and Aaron said he thought he broke his neck. So 1 can understand why Kyle did it to that point."

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Rodriguez wins I0th straight Gold Glove, ties Bench 
Associa.ted Pre .. 
Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez won his 10th straight 
Gold Glove award Tuesday, tying his idol Johnny Bench for the 
most by a catcher. 
"I can see him winning 12, 13, maybe as many as 14," said 
Bench. the former Cincinnati star and Hall of Farner. "I don't see why he would stop. He wants to be behind the plate. He thrives on it." 
The only thing that might stop Rodriguez's streak is a position change. Wear and tear behind the plate has led some good-hitting catchers, like Bench. to switch positions to extend their careers. 

Rodriguez joined Atlanta right-hander Rodriguez Greg Maddux, and Cleveland second base­man Roberto Alomar as Gold Glove record-setters. 
Maddux extended his NL record for pitchers by winning his 12th straight Gold Glove. He trails only Jim Kaat, who won the award 16 times. 
Alomar passed former Chicago Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg with his 10th Gold Glove, the most for that position. 
He was joined by his Cleveland double-play partner shortstop Omar Vizquel, who won for the ninth straight seaso_n. Vizquel trails Ozzie Smith, who took the award 13 times. 
Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki and Mike Cameron earned two of the three AL outfield spots. Suzuki made only one error in his first major league season after coming ove.r from Japan. 
Torii Hunter of the Minnesota Twins filled out the AL outfield. 
Mike Mussina, in his first season with the New York Yankees, was again chosen as the top pitcher in the American League. Mussina won four straight years (1996-9 9) before Texas Kenny Rogers broke his streak last season. 
Minnesota first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, and Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez round out the AL squad. Atlanta's Andruw Jones -who won his fourth straight out­field award in the NL. 
The St. Louis Cardinals had two winners, outfielder Jim Edmonds and second baseman Fernando Vina. Edmonds won his second NL award in a row, after winning three in the AL with Anaheim. 
Vina took over from Cincinnati's Pokey Reese, who won the past two years. 
Colorado also had two players make the team. First baseman Todd Helton broke the run of San Francisco's J.T. Snow, who won six consecutive. 
Helton was joined by teammate Larry Walker, who completed the NL outfield.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Largest audience in 10 years tunes in for Game 7 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK Nearly 40 million people watched Game 7 of the World Series, the largest TV audience for baseball in 10 years. 
Fox's broadcast of the Arizona Diamondbacks' 3-2 victory over the New York Yankees to win the championship Sunday night drew a 23.5 preliminary national rating and 34 share, making it the most-watched telecast in the network's history outside of NFL games. 
The rating is the percentage of the country's 105.5 million TV households tuned to a broadcast. Share is the percentage of homes with TVs in use. 
The game, which Arizona won with a two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning to end New York's streak of three straight titles, drew more than twice as many viewers as Sunday night's Emmy Awards show on CBS. 
Overall, the World Series averaged a 15.6 rating and 25 share. 26 percent higher than the record-low 12.4/21 for the 2000 Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets, which generated little TV interest outside of New York. 
One indication, though, of how the proliferation of cable and satellite TV has changed viewers' habits is that only one other World Series (the Yankees' four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres in 1998, with a 14.1 average) drew lower ratings than this year's. 
An estimated 39.1 million people were tuned to Fox at any given time during Sunday's game. Only three TV programs were watched by more people in 2001: the Super Bowl (No. 1 with 84.1 million). the premier of "Survivor" (which fol­lowed the Super Bowl on Jan. 28) and the Academy Awards show. 
It was he biggest average audience for a baseball game since 50.3 million tuned in for the 10-inning Game 7 of the 1991 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves. 
Fox estimated that 71.9 million people watched at least part of Sunday night's game, which had a rating more than twice that for Game 1 on Oct. 27 -the lowest-rated game in World Series history.

Huskies nab top preseason spot for third year 
A<socia tee! Press 
Conneclicut, still brimming with tal­ent even after losing three key players, was an overwhelming choice as the No. 1 team Tuesday in The Associated Press preseason women's basketball poll. , 
It was nothing new for the Huskies. This will be the third straight season that has started with Connecticut lead­ing the poll and the fourth since 1995. 
'Tm sure that our performance in the NCAA Tournament had a lot to do with this, but this is a different season and different circumstances," UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. 
"I don't think it's as clear cut going into the season as to who the favorite should be this year. I'm sure there are plenty of other schools who feel .:they deserve to be number one."

Connecticut no longer has All­Americans Shea Ralph and Svetlana Abrosimova, and center Kelly Schumacher also is gone. But the Huskies learned to play without Ralph and Abrosimova after they were 'injured last season and UConn still made it to the Final Four. 
Point guard Sue Bird is back to run the offense and she'll have plenty of options on the floor with Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones and Diana Taurasi, who played fearlessly as a freshman last season. 
"We've got as good a first five as any­one in the country," Auriemma said. 
Williams is not playing at the moment because of a condition that causes pain and numbness in her left arm. It's not known when she'll return. 
Connecticut received 31 of 45 first­pl ace votes from a national media panel and had 1,102 points. Tennessee, which has been No. 1 in the prescason poll three times, was second with five first-place votes and 1,032 points. 
The Lady Vols' big three of Tamika Catchings, Semeka Randall and Kristen Clement have moved on, but coach Pat Summitt still has veterans Michelle Snow, Kara Lawson and Gwen Jackson and a freshman class headed by national player of the year Shyra Ely. 
Three teams split the remaining first­place votes. No. 3 Vanderbilt received six, No. 4 Oklahoma had two an.d No, 5 Duke got one. Vanderbilt finished nine points behind Tennessee. 
Louisiana Tech was sixth, followed by Texas Tech, Iowa State, Stanford and North Carolina State. Stanford was the only team in the Top 10 that was not in the final poll last season. 
Purdue, the national runner-up last season, was voted into the No. 11 spot. Then it was Colorado, Florida, Baylor

SMC SWIMMING AND DIVING 
Saint Mary's blows Rose-Hulman out of water 
By NELLIE WILLIAMS 
Sports Wricer 

Saint Mary's swim team made a splash into their season with a 151-84 victory over Rose­Hulman Saturday. 
The Belles had recently competed in the Notre Dame Relays and were looking to build on that performance. 
"Each meet we'd like to see improvements in different areas," said first-season coach Gregg Petcoff. "So the basis of our view is from the Notre Dame H.elay meet." 
After a seventh place finish at the Notre Dame Relays, the Belles went back to the practice pool with a new focus. 
"We have been training harder and longer than we had been going into the early-season Notre Dame Relay meet," said Petcoff. 'Tm not sur­prised with our somewhat mixed results with regard to times, but the technical improvements l was looking for were clearly there this weekend." 
Many of the swimmers made a point of improv­ing their individual times. 
"One group that really stood out in their times, improvement and technically were our breastro­kers," said Petcoff. "[TheyJ all seemed to have at least one best ever collegiate in-season time." 
Petcoff was especially pleased with sophomore Maureen Palchak's performance. 
"Not only did Maureen lead our sprint freestyle swfmmers in the 50, 100, and 200 yard freestyles," said PeJcoff. "But she was a fantastic aid to the coaches and captains in helping with the many first-year swimmers we have who were swimming their initial collegiate individuals events." · 
Junior captain Lauren Smith said she was satis­fied about how things a.re falling into place in the team's training and performances so far this sea­son. 
"As a team we did really well," said Smith. "It wasn't a high pressure meet." 
Smith, along with sophomore Megan Ramsey, won multiple events. Hamsey took first in the 100-and 200-yard butterfly races. Smith domi­nated the pool in the 100-and 200-yard breast­stroke events and the 200-yard individual relay. 
Smith credits her performance on Saturday to the team's new coach this season. 
"I think [Petcoft] is doing a great job. I couldn't be happier," she said. "It's been two years since I felt this good about how I swam." 
The Belles now .turn their focus toward three big meets that will begin at the end of next week. They will be facing two Division I schools, Western Ontario and· Texas Christian University, and then compete in an Invitational at Wabash College. · 
Petcoff looks to build off this victory and contin­ue to improve with each meet. 
"I can see that the beginning of the next train­ing cycle this week will continue the progress that they have been making so far this season.0

"[Our defense] has made my job easier than any other goal­keeper in the league." he said. "There have been games when we've only allowed one or two shots, or even in some cases none." 
Sawyer has also benefited from the knowledge of an experienced backfield. All three of the team captains ­Griffin Howard, Andreas Forstner and Martin -are defenders in front of Sawyer. 
"The captains in the back have helped me a lot to figure out my role and what to do in some of the tougher situa­tions," Sawyer . said. "Basically, I can just look at my defenders for guidance." 
With the more experienced players such as Howard, Forstner and Tait guiding him, Sawyer has been able to settle into his position early in his career. 
"They always keep giving me advice on and off the field," Sawyer states. "Once I started playing, they were the first people to show me my role and help me fit into it."

Notre Dame grabbed 58 rebounds during the final 20 minutes of the game, while hold­ing the Legends to only 41 rebounds and 21 points.

Notre Dame trailed the Legends 
by 10 points. But Wicks hit a 
three-pointer sending the Irish 
on a 10-point scoring run that 
left the game tied at 40 going 'into halftime. 
A defense that allowed six three-point shots in the first half, stepped up play and held the Legends to 21 second half points. Despite improved play in the last 20 minutes of the game, McGraw is looking to spend more time talking with her team half to 44 percent 
in the game. 

"We're not real­ly worried about shooting per­centage. We're not really wor­ried about the shots," said assis­tant coach Coquese Washington. "We're looking for a consistent effort. We're looking at our ten­dencies. We're looking at getting game by game growth and get­ting better each game." 
The six Irish freshmen will be key to that consistent play. As McGraw tried out several com­binations on the court, the coaching staff and the large crowd at the Joyce Center got a feeling for the young team's 
' 

play. 
"I think they did definitely well for the first game," Severe said. "I know my first game wasn't that good. I think they all held their composure and they did well." 
Despite playing a majority of the game, Batteast, who was chosen preseason Big East Rookie of the Year. only shot 4­17, but managed to grub 10 rebounds. 
"Yeah, I was a little nervous," she said after the game. "Next game, I'll be ready." 
Like Batteast. the rest of the freshmen battled nerves, but turned in promising perfor­mances. 
"I thought they did great," Ratay said. "I was really impressed with how Theresa [Borton] played, how Jackie [Batteast] played, how Kelsey [Wicks] played." 
The Irish will play one more exhibition game next Tuesday at the Joyce Center against the Christian Brothers before open­ing regular season play against Valparaiso on Nov. 18.

Severe 
1D1pr~1ve in Irish win 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
Tuesday night's exhibition game was a first for the six freshman players that stepped onto the court at the Joyce Center. But they weren't the only women facing new roles. 
Although all eyes were on Jackie Batteast, Theresa Borton and Kelsey Wicks. it was sopho­more point guard Le'Tania Severe that turned in the most notable performance during an Irish 76-62 victory against the Ohio Girls Basketball Magazine Legends. 
"Le'Tania Severe was proba­bly the one I'm most pleased with right now," head coach Muffet McGraw said. "She did such a great job leading the team." 
With the graduation of last year's leaders Ruth Riley and Niele Ivey, the Irish needed someone to step up on the court and take a leadership role. especially with six freshman players. Severe took that posi­tion. 
"It's very rewarding," Severe said. "This-summer I worked very hard to get healthy and get back where I was." 
Severe. who sat out much of last season due to injury. only sat out eight minutes during Tuesday's game, grabbing five rebounds and posting eight points. 
"{Severe's] nice," Legends coach John Feasel said. "She's quick, she penetrated against us, played good D, pressure our guards. She's a nice player." 
After Severe's performance in Tuesday's game, there are no doubts that her injuries are behind her. 
"I feel 100 percent now com­pared to last year," Severe said. "I wasn't anywhere near where I wanted to be and now I've got healthy. I'm ready to go." 
Severe wasn't the only player whose injuries made her play questionable. Wicks, a fresh­man guard, has also been ham­pered with an ankle injury. She took part in half a practice on Monday and was still question­

-able before the game started. "We were kind of debating it this morning -seeing if this would set me back," Wicks said. "So there was a little bit of doubt but I'm happy I got to play." After finishing the game with

Part of the identity the Irish , have established since Sawyer has come in is that of a dominant defensive squad, having recorded six shutouts and four one-goal perfor­mances in their last eleven contests. 
"Our defense starts with the strikers," forward Erich Braun said. "Then the mid­field takes over, and if the ball gets through, the defend­ers are the next option we have. Then back in goal there's Sawyer, and if any­thing gets through the defenders, hopefully not, he's there to save it., and he's doing a tremendous job of that."

Often in sports, in order for a team to begin winning, they have to have the attitude that they can win.
