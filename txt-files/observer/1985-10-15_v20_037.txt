Proposal to disband senate meets with outrage 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
Senior StaffReporter 
Five student leaders, Including Student Body President Bill Healy, proposed last night to disband the Student Senate in a letter which stated the senate had "longceased to he a legitimate voice of the student body." 
"Student Senate doesn't do anyth­ing. A bunch ofpeople debate things and they don't accomplish anyth­ing," said Student Activities Board Mananger Lee Broussard, one of the five signers. 
"It's time we start doing our job and addressing student concerns," said Student Body Vice President Duane lawrence, who also signed the letter. "The Student Senate is stopping us. It's apparent to everyone on campus." 
In addition to Healy, Broussard 
and lawrence, Hall Presidents' 
Council Chairman Kevin Howard 
and judicial Council Coordinator 
Karen Ingwersen signed the letter 
asking for the abolition of the senate 
by student referendum. 
The announcement, which was 
made after the senate meeting last 
night, was met with outrage by 
several senate members. 
"This Is the most reactionary, 
juvenile stunt student government 
has ever attempted as yet," said 
Senator Jim Hagan. 
"They refuse to even consider taking up any issue dealing with the administration. These so-called stu­dent leaders proposing this referen­dum didn't even have the guts to bring up any of this just one hour earlier at the senate meeting," said Ilagan. 
"Three of the people: who wanted 
to disband the senate were not elected," Senator KC. Culum said, referring to Howard, Broussard and Ingwersen. 
To abolish the senate, a proposal first would need 1 5 percent of the student body's signatures or a rwo­thirds vote by the Hall Presidents' Council, said Parliamentarian Eric 
Parzianello, who also is Student 
Body Treasurer. 
The senate also could vote by a 
rwo-thirds margin to begin the 
process of disbanding itself, Par­
zianello said. 
If one of the above requirements Is met, then the proposal would need approval ofone-halfof the stu­dent body or a rwo-thirds vote by the HPC or the senate for adoption, said Parzianello. 
The process of disbanding the senate potentially could take six weeks, lawrence said. 
Several of the signers said they believe the Campus Ufe Council, composed of students, rectors and administrators, is the proper forum for student concerns. The process for approving proposals, they said, would become more efficient if proposals went directly through the CLC. 
In the present student govern­
ment framework, the CLC must pass 
all senate resolutions before they go 
to the administration for final ap­proval. All of the student senators are members ofthe CLC, Lawrence said. "The CLC is going to be the voice of the students," he said. 
Junior Class President Jim Domagalski criticized the leaders' action. 
"Bill Healy has once again shown his total inability to lead," said Domagalski, who is a senate mem­ber. 
"His attempt to disband the Stu­dent Senate has nothing to do with anything but his inability to organize student opinion into legislation and programming," said Domagalski. 
Healy, who chairs the senate, had much criticism for the body. 
"The senate is associated with the word 'joke,' " said Healy. "By the time the Student Senate dealt with something like South Africa, It would be 30 years later." 
"It's proven itselflnei:Iective,'' said Healy. "The students have had enough of Student Senate members tinkering with student government toys." Healy said last night's decision 
was  a  long  time  in  coming.  
"Tonight's  meeting  was  the  last  
straw,'' he said.

"The idea has been around for a long time," agreed Lawrence. 
Hagan said the action came be­cause Healy had received criticism from alumni at last weekend's Stu­
A NEW BEGINNING

Given that the Student Senate has long since ceased to be s legimate voice of the student body, we propose that this body be disbsnded. In order thst we get back to the students and serve you as we were elected to do, we call for s student initiative to begin this process. Should f~fteen percent of the student body support this initistive by signature with I. D. number, it will become a student referendum. The support of one-half of the student body for this referendum will eliminste the Student Senate and will sllow student government to serve the students without the encumbrance of this "debate forum."

WASHINGTON-Top Reagan ad­ministration law enforcement offi­cials insisted yesterday that a Palestinian guerrilla leader accused of masterminding the Italian cruise liner hijacking be brought to the United States to face trial. 
But the administration, rebuffed earlier by Italy in an attempt to have Mohammed Abu el Abbas arrested, made no headway in getting his provisional arrest in Yugoslavia, pending a formal extradition re­
quest. 

In fact, the Yugoslav news agency reported that Abbas, 38, was out of the country. The White House said it had no independent confirmation of that. 
CBS news, however, said its cor­respondent in Tunis, Tunisia, had spoken to Abbas by telc:phone in Yugoslavia shortly before 8 a.m. ­after the Palestinian leader was al­ready said to have left. 
CBS quoted Abbas as saying that Yugoslav authorities had told l)im he could stay as long as he wanted. The nerwork did not say how its cor­respondent knew that the man to whom he spoke was Abbas. 
The State Department said the United States was asking Yugoslavia for confirmation that Abbas had left the country. 
The statement also said: "We have not yet received a response from the Yugoslav government to our request that Abbas be provisionally arrested pending a formal extradition re-

An American plane left Ilopango military air base yesterday carrying what sources said were 1 5 to 18 people. "The question of the trip that my children and grandchildren are taking today is because I received more threats of another kidnapping, and I'm taking the precautions to protect my children and my grandchildren, and the men of the family are all staying with me," said Duarte, president of El Salvador and graduate ofNotre Dame. -AP

Americans touring other lands face real possibility of hostile treatment 

The release of the luxury liner Achille Lauro brought to an end to yet another act ofterrorism in a long string affecting American citizens while travelling abroad this 
year. 

Recent hijacking victims have been lucky in a sense. No crazed terrorists have opened fire randomly. In­stead, the few killed seem to have been chosencarefully after a search of passports by hijackers. American tourists seem to be susceptible if Leon Klinghoffer is any indication. Klinghoffer, an 69-year old stroke vic­tims confined to a wheel chair, was shot and thrown into the sea by attackers. 
An article in yesterday's Chicago Tribune told of an American couple on the ship who concealed their U.S. passports and passed themselves off as Austrian citizens, producing identification issued by the Austrian govern­ment. Donald Saire was a United Nations diplomat based in Austria. His wife hid their passports, fearing her husband would be the first killed.

Students in foreign studies programs may also think twice about some of their travel this semester. But ac­cording to Notre Dame Foreign Studies Director Isabel Charles, students may be "more and more realizing that these are isolated incidents possible anywhere in the world today." 
"The result (ofsuch attempts) is more security rather than less," she continued. 
Charles said that Notre Dame students travelling abroad are instructed to keep updated about possible trouble spots, and to avoid those areas. Students check

Ronald Reagan can fume, and threaten international terrorists with retaliation all he wants. But until the ad­ministration starts to deal with what is behind such acts, threats ofrevenge will not serve to deter terrorists who are beyond reasoning anyway. 
Secondly, while the government needs to look into the causes of hijackers' actions, Americans cannot be fearful of leaving the country because of them. When that happens, we will know that American esteem and confidence has hit an all-time low at home and abroad. 
Common sense is the precaution to be considered these days for American citizens travelling overseas. But in this case, simple prevention will not be the best cure. Examining the symptoms of the epidemic can only serve to stop the disease from further spreading.

"Whistle Stop" highlights Board of Governance talks 
By PEGGY PROSSER 
News Staff 
Security precautions recently taken were among the topics dis­cusseJ at the Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting last night. 
"I couldn't believe it, but a lot of students were getting mace and flashlights in their care packages from home," said Regina Hall Pre!>ident Mary Flynn, speaking about security concerns. 
To allay those concerns, Representative Ann Conte described "Whistle Stop," a program instituted as a safety precaution for the Saint Mary's community. 
She said a letter was sent to Saint Mary's students detailing the purpose for the sale of whistles, which are meant to scare away attackers and attract attention when blown. 
"Security on both campuses has been told about the program," said Conte. "But we do stress that the possession of a whistle does not guarantee your safety." 
Those int&:rested in purchasing the $1 whistles can contact their resident assistants, Conte said. 
Another topic raised at the meeting was the benefit for Notre Dame student Kevin Hur­ley. 
Although the original idea for a benefit dance was not employed, Saint Mary's Campus Ministry has donated SSOO to the trust fund Hurley's parents have es­tablished. 
In other business, jeanne Hel­ler, vice president of student affairs, said those at the meeting should continue their efforts in collecting for the United Way. 
The survey results from the possible change in library hours were announced, with only 39 percent of the campus respond­ing. 
"Until we get at least a 50 per­cent response from the students, we can't draw up any type of proposal, so we're urging those who wish to see a change in the library hours to return their sur­veys," Student Body President Anne Marie Kollman said.

While many Saint Mary's students will be relaxing during their week­long October break, Anne McCarthy will be busy making their opinions known. 
McCarthy, the student regent on the College's Board of Regents, will be attending the board's three-day meeting beginning Oct. 24. 

"My main concern is voicing stu­dent opinion on decisions made and making sure they take students into consideration," McCarthy said. 
McCarthy, a full voting member on all issues addressed by the board, has several responsibilities that al­low her to accomplish this, she said. 
Among those responsibilities in­clude orienting the new regents to student life and government and sit­ting on the committee for student life. 
McCarthy is confident she will have an impact on decisions made by the board, she said. 

"The regents have an open ear for the students," McCarthy said. "Student government does have a large role in administrative deci­sions at Saint Mary's." 
McCarthy, who sees her position as a "student representative bet­ween the body of students and the administration's executive board," said she expects to be Involved in several issues at the October meeting, Those issues, she said, in­clude the sexuality survey taken last year and the College's financial mat­ters.

Three senators walk out in protest 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
Senior StaffReporter 
In what could have been one of the Student Senate's final meetings, three senate members walked out destroying the quorum and ending the meeting. 
The quorum, which is a sufficient number ofsenate members present, is needed to approve any senate resolution. 
The senate had been debating a 
proposal by Student Body President r Bill Healy to take a referendum on r students' views regarding 
r 
divestiture in South Africa. 
r 
When Healy was reminded by
r 
Kevin Howard, Hall Presidents' 
r ~ 
Council chairman, that he didn't need the senate's approval to spon­
r 
sor the referendum, Healy ended
r 
debate on the matter and told the r senate,"I will bring the referendum r to the student body." t According to parliamentary r procedure of the senate, however, 
Healy could not end the debate and ,.f it began again. 
At this point Howard, Judicial Council Coordinator Karen Ingwer­sen and Student Activities Board Manager Lee Broussard walked out. 
r 
"I think it's awesome," said Healy, referring to the walkout. He added he was glad to see some action taken. 
Earlier in the meeting, the senate had electedStudent Body Vice Presi­dent Duane Lawrence chairman ofa committee that will investigate a restructuring of student govern­ment. 
Lawrence was nominated by Healy, igniting an argument with Junior Class President Jim Domagalski and Senator K.C. Culum. 
"It cannot be Bill Healy's restruc­turing committee. It should be the Student Senate's," said Domagalski. 
Culum added, "Until we see the type of committee I don't think we should select a chairman." 
Healy then told the senate that all committee members had to be ap­proved by the senate as well as the committee's future actions. 
Earlier in the meeting, senate members had reported on what they learned during last weekend's Stu­dent Leadership Conference. 
"I got a lot more out of the weekend than I thought I would," said Ingwersen. 
"I learned to set realistic goals. Leadership is not just a position but making people believe you can do something," she said. 
Many problems plaguing the cur­rent student government discussed with past student leaders during the 
leadership  meetings,  Sophomore  
Class  Vice  President  Laurie  Bink  
said.  
"Student  relationships with  the  

administration aren't where they should be," Bink said. "Some mutual respect would go a long way." 
"One voice needs to come out of student government," said Brous­sard, adding, "We have too many right now." 
"Maybe we have to redefine our goals to gain the student's respect," said Senior Class President John Spatz. 
"If you're going. to be a leader you've got to lead and get things done," said Howard. "It reminds the administration that we are still here." 
Parliamentarian Eric Parzianello said arguing with the administration is not showing disrespect but is a good way to cause change. 
"We can't be complacent with the administration," he said.

Senator K.C. Culum also strongly 
disagreed with Healy. "I question 
the prerogatives of the people who 
signed the letter," he said. "Who is 
the legitamate voice of the student body?" 
Culum said he believed better or­ganization on leadership's part would make the senate more ef­
fective. "I think Student Senate has the people who could make it effective," he said. Both Healy and Lawrence said the action would be in students' best in­terest. 
"We have to start leading the stu­dents and meeting their needs," said Lawrence. 
Added Healy, "It might look bad but it's the best thing." 

dynamic speaker and a very learned man." 
Walter called Kaplan a "great entreprenuer" who "has done a lot for education." He said Kaplan will discuss "the importance of prepar­ing for standardized exams in general." 
Kaplan's preparation program is unnecessary for students who are well prepared and self confident, Walter said, but for others it's a "perfect review." 
Walter said the program also gives confidence to students who are ap­prehensive about standardized ex­ams. 
As Walter said he tells his students, "It's here, it's available if you feel you need it for review or selfconfidence." 
Robert Waddick, assistant dean of arts and letters and advisor to the prelaw society, said he does not advise students to invest in the relatively expensive test prepara­tion programs.

E.B. White leaves his legacy in his written words 
I don't remember exactly when I had my first introduction to E. B. White, but I'm almost certain it occurred before I was able to read. 

johnHuebl 
guest column 
"The Trumpet of the Swan," a classic story about a swan named Louis who is born wit­hout a voice, was read to me and my siblings by my mother, who always had a sense for great books. I later read "Charlotte's Web" and "Stuart Little" on my own, and then, on entering junior high, I decided I had out­grown E.B. White. 
What I didn't realize was that White is con­sidered one of the most talented and versatile writers in American history. 
White's love for writing developed early In his life. He kept a serious journal as a boy, and as a teenager he published a series of poems, essays, and short stories in his high school newspaper. After graduating In 1921 from Cornellllnlversity, where he served as editor­in-chief of the student newspaper, White spent a few years traveling and working at odd jobs before joining the New Yorker full-time in 1927. 
White soon became the New Yorker's most important and influential writer, contributing serious essays and humorous articles in addi­tion to his regular introductory and editorial sections. 

Even when his prolific career had taken him elsewhere, White maintained a close relation­ship with this magazine and continued to con­tribute to it for over 50 years. His career culminated with a series of prestigious awards. including the Pulitzer Prize in 1978. 
I rediscovered White when I entered col­lege and picked up a small, thin handbook titled "The Elements ofStyle," known to many college students as "Strunk and White." It sits on a shelf next to two other books to which I refer whenever I write a paper: a dictionary and a thesaurus. 
White's pithy, 85-page book is written in the same concise style that it preaches to the reader. It contains a long list of one-line in­structions which read something like the ten commandments: 
Be clear. 
Do not overwrite. 
Do not overstate. 
Omit needless words. 
Revise and rewrite. 

The list goes on. A brief explanation and usually an example follow each command. "The Elements of Style" is the product of White's revision of the first edition, com­monly referred to as "the little book," published by his former English professor at Cornell. White's revised edition has become state of the art among books of English and composition and style, and it probably will be a long time before anyone suggests doing a second revision. This book would be difficult 
White's command of the structural and 
stylistic aspects of the English language 
marked him as a great craftsman. It was his 
humanity, however, that made him famous. 
It is for his humanity that he will be remem­
bered. His novels and essays emanate a love of 
the world and all of its creatures, great and 
small. Common themes were his hatred of 
war, his love for animals and especially his 
love for young people. 
In an essay titled "A Slight Sound at Evening," White reflects on Thoreau's "Walden," and offers some advice to both uni­versities and students: Ifourcollegesand universities were alert, they would present a cheap pocket edition of the book to every senior upon graduating, along with his sheepskin, or instead ofit. Received at such a juncture, the book is like an invitation to life's dance, assuring the troubled recipient that no matter whatbefalls him in tbe way of success orfailure he will always be welcome at the party -that the music is played for bim,too, if be will but listen and move his feet. 
Coming from such a phenomenally­successful man, these words of advice offer hope and inspiration to all students worried about their future. I, a senior whose real major (who am I trying to kid?) remains undeclared, read "A Slight Sound at Evening" for a class last week, and was floored by it.

majority in South Africa. 
We appreciate Hesburgh's participation in the rally. His apparent opposition to Notre Dame's divestment from South Africa, 
however, is wholly unacceptable to many of us. To begin with, his theory that theJapanese and West Germans would fill the economic vacuum created by divestment is insensitive and insulting to those people's social concern. Second and more Importantly, this line of thinking is believed by many informed scholars on the_ issue to be one of the more fallacious arguments about divestment. Third and finally, let us follow in the footsteps ofot­her fine institutions that have already divested their shares in South Africa, and not be among the last to wring our hands of the crime in South Africa. 
We believe that whereas President Reagan's policy of constructive engagement has only allowed the flames in that country to continue to smolder, constructive dis-engagement (i.e. divestment) will help to extinguish the fire outright.

easy to see that a room could become a blazing inferno within a matter of moments. 
An incident at Providence Col­lege in the early I970s affected fire safety policies at many institutions, and Notre Dame was no exception. According to Bland, one student was trying to dry her socks with a hair dryer when a fire ignited and spread quickly into the hallway. 
Because it was Christmas time and the halls were lined with paper decorations, there was a flash fire effect which claimed the lives of ten women who had opened their doors and entered the corridor. "This is why we enforce decorating rules so strictly," said Bland. 
There have been incidences of damage done to buildings and campus structures. Most recently, the result ofan overabundance of candles burning at the Grotto called the department into action. 
As far as dorm fires go, a fire in St. Edward's Hall onJune 25, I980, probably was the most serious. It began when sparks from a cutting torch used by a workman to remove a fire escape set the roofon fire. Extensive smoke and water damage was done to the entire building, but the fire never reached below the fourth floor. 
As a result, the department now requires that any welding or use of cutting torches on campus be ap­proved by Bland. "Ifthere's any chance ofcombustion as a result of the job, we won't allow it," said Bland. "Ifwe do approve, there will be someone from the fire depart­ment nearby to supePVise." 
Besides Malley and Bland, the department is staffed by eight ex­perienced firemen (two ofwhom act as captains) and three students who also live in the fire house and juggle their academics with the responsibilities offire prevention. "At least four or five of of us will answer a call during the day," said Bland, "and at least three will respond at night." Bland also added that if those responding to the call were to spot any smoke coming from the building at all, the South Bend Fire Department would be called immediately. 
Because more smoke detectors continue to be installed in various buildings, the department is being called out by more false alarms. According to Bland, however, they leave the station hoping each time that it is just a case ofburnt pop­corn or toast. "I'd much rather answer 4000 false alarms than one real fire." 
The department's domain of responsibility is not limited to the University's campus. "We also respond to alarms at Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross Junior College," said Bland. Besides responding immediately to any an_d all fire alarms, the department has a number ofother reponsibilities. Among others, they conduct train­ing sessions, test equipment, install sprinkler systems, clean smoke detectors, check all safety systems regularly and participate in the orientation ofresident assistants each year. 
Possiblity offire, destruction and tragic loss are not things we want or need to be reminded ofevery day. In this respect, the Notre Dame Fire Department does what it can to make them the least ofour worries. Although "National Fire Prevention Week" was last week, the senti­ments that abide at the Notre Dame fire house are reflected well in a comment made by Malley: "We have fire prevention every day here."

Though not uncommon, fire drills are something you neverget used to. As you stand in the cold, shivering and yawning, you might notice the red fire truck parked nearby and people running around the dorm looking for the hypotheti­cal blaze.

the fire department in cooperation

with the utilities department. Ac­

r cording to Malley, who constructed the University's first fire engine himself, "There was no fire station at first, so we kept the engine and equipment at the power plant." In the beginning, the fire depart­ment was run entirely by the Holy Cross brothers. The fire station, which is located on the north side ofcampus, was finally built in 1945 and the brothers slept at the station to provide around-the-clock service. It wasn't until 1978 that the fire department was recognized as a 
service independent ofthe utilities department. At this time, highly qualified firemen were hired from outside the University and put on payroll. Also, the position ofdirec­tor offire safety was filled byJack Bland, and Malley became the offi­cial fire chief. 
So for 46 years, the campus has been drilled, inspected, instructed, and asked to abide by certain fire safety policies. Grumblings over untimely drills or policies that limit creativity when decorating for SYRs can be quieted by the fact that throughout the 46 years ofservice, there have been no fatalities as a result offires at the University. 
According to Bland, the general attitude ofstudents during fire drills seems to be one ofunconcern. "This is understandable," said Bland. "Very few people will enter a dorm wondering 'am I safe in this building?' " Recently, this ques­tion has been raised by many when entering hotels across the country. ' 
Some visitors to hotels will refuse to stay in a high rise. Ifthis is the case, then perhaps more concern should be shown by students in regard to their safety in dorms; in the uniform building code for the state ofIndiana, dorms are treated as hotels for purposes ofinspection and fire codes. 
At the very least, it seems a cer­tain level ofawareness is needed for students. "Students hold a certain

Toronto faces Royals tonight 
Cardinals win on Smith's homer 
ST. LOUIS -Ozzie Smith, the least likely man in the St. Louis lineup, homered with one out in the ninth inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 vic­tory over Los Angeles in the pivotal fifth game of the National League playoffs yesterday. With the victory, the Cardinals swept the three games in their home park and took a 3-2 lead as the best-of-seven series headed back to Los Angeles. 
The homer came on a 1-2 pitch from Tom Niedenfuer and was the first that the switch-hitting Smith has hit batting left-handed in 2,968 career at-bats. He had only six homers this season. 
After an off day, the series resumes tomorrow afternoon at Dodger Stadium. In a rematch of Game 2, won by the Dodgers 8-2, Los Angeles will start right-hander Ore! Her­shiser against the Cardinals' Joaquin Andujar. 
In American League action, Kansas City travels to Toronto tonight to take on the Blue Jays in a game starting at 8:1 5 p.m. EDT. 
Before Smith's dramatic homer 
yesterday, the two teams had played 
a 2-2 tie after Bill Madlock's two-run 
home run for the Dodgers in the 
fourth inning. 
In and out oftrouble, Dodger left­
bander Fernando Valenzuela finally 
left after throwing 132 pitches 
through eight innings, and Nieden­
fuer, who saved Game 1 for Valen­
zuela, came in to pitch. 
He got Willie McGee to foul out to third and ran the count to a ball and two strikes on Smith before the slightly built shortstop launched .one into the second deck in right field, bringing his teammates rus­hing onto the field and eliciting a huge ovation from the 53.708 at 
Busch Stadium. 
Tommy Herr gave the Cardinals 
their only two other runs in the 

and Mil Mlllvllvan Classic

game with a two-run double in the first inning, and Madlock evened it up in the fourth. It was the most closely contested game ofthe series. In fact, it was the only game decided after the sixth inning and only the second game of the playoffs decided after the third. 
The winning pitcher was Cardinal bullpen ace Jeff Lahti, the fourth St. Louis pitcher ofthe day, who retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth. 
Valenzuela pitched eight innings, giving up four hits and two runs with seven strikeouts and eight walks. The walks established an NL playoff record, surpassing the six allowed in 1974 by Pittsburgh's Bruce KJson and in Game 3 of this series by the Dodgers' Bob Welch . 
The Cardinals played their second straight game of the series without left fielder Vince Coleman, whose left leg was injured Sunday when he was partially trapped under the machine that rolls the tarp onto the field. 
"I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy," said Coleman, whose only real injuries were scrapes and bruises. He could play Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
Cardinals right-hander Bob Forsch, a spot starter this year, lasted only 3 1-3 innings before he was relieved by left-bander Ken Dayley after giving up the tying runs in the fourth inning. The 35-year-old Forsch is the senior member of the Cardinals, having been with the club since 1974. 
Cards manager Whitey Herzog elected to go with Forsch on yester­<4y instead ofbringing back Andujar on three day's rest. Andujar was inef­fective in losing Game 2 in Los An­geles, going 4 1-3 innings and giving 
up six runs on eight hits. 
In Game I, Valenzuela had to 
pitch his way out ofminor trouble in 
the first two innings. This time, he 
was only half as lucky. And this time, 
the trouble was ofhis own doing, the 
result of wildness. 
Valenzuela walked Willie McGee 
on a 3-2 pitch to start the first inning. 
McGee checked his swing just in 
time to avoid striking out, and the 
next batter, Smith, walked on four 
pitches. Valenzuela then threw a 
strike to Herr before the Cards' RBI 
leader pulled a ground double down 
the left-field line. 
McGee scored easily and Smith ran through the "stop" sign of third­base coach Hal Lanier to score as Pedro Guerrero's throw from left field sailed over the head ofcatcher Mike Scioscia. Valenzuela backed up the play, and Herr held at second. Herr, who homered in Game 3, wound up at third shortly thereafter, however, when Valenzuela threw the ball into center field on an at­tempted pickoff. 
The Cards failed to score Herr as Jack Clark lined out hard to Bill Mad­lock at third, Cesar Cedeno struck out and Tito Landrum, Coleman's replacement in left field, flied to center. 
The double was Herr's fourth of the playoffs, tying a record set by Pete Rose of Cincinnati and Matty Alou of Oakland, both in 1972. And the RBis were the fourth and fifth in the series for Herr, who had 110 during the season. 
The Cardinals again had the first two runners of the second inning aboard on a double by Terry Pendleton and a walk to Darrell Porter. Forsch sacrificed the runners to second and third, but McGee struck out and Smith popped deep to shortstop Mariano Duncan to end the threat.

Because of an editing error, a hc:-adline in yesterday's paper in­correctly reported the status of the American League Champion­ship Series. Toronto leads the series, 3-2, over Kansas City.

Clubs find success in competition 
WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY: The Notre Dame women's cross country team took this past weekend off. After having run in the Loyola Lakefront Invita­tional two weekends ago, the Irish ready themselves for a big meet at Indiana University next weekend where they will be competing in the Little State In­vitaional Cross Country Championship. 
"We should do real well at the meet because we are really begining to run well," said team captain Mary Beth Fiske. "At first, we didn't know how many women were going to run because ofbreak. But now we know that Kathleen Lehman, Julian Merkel and Nancy Loughlin will be, we should place well. Also, I intend to run in the tournament and hopefully, I am competely healed from my tendonitis inj_ury." 
After the Indiana meet, the Irish will run in the North Star Confrence Meet on October 26. The team feels pretty optimistic about the meet. 
"This year has been a little bit disappointing be­cause we have had a problem with injuries," said Fiske. "But all the runners have done real well this season and I expect good results at the confrence meet." 
One of the women who should do real well is Julian Merkel, who at the Loyola Lakefront Invita­tional placed 13th overall and was the first of the Irish to cross the finish line. Overall, the Irish as a team finished 1Oth out of 1 5 teams. 
ROWING CLUB: When the members ofthe Notre Dame Rowing team went to Des Moines, Iowa on September 28, they went into the regatta expecting good results. They weren't disappointed. They en­tered four boats and three of them came away with medals. In fact, one of the lightweight boats dupl­icated last year's feat when it came away with the fastest time of the day. And in accomplishing this feat, the boat was awarded the Traveling Trophy. 
In the lightweight division where the Irish enter two boats, the A boat won the gold medal and the trophy, while the Irish B boat settled for the silver. The participants in the winning boat were: Jeff Coil, Joe Brunnetti, Chuck Lumb, Tod Waffner, Eric 


Tom Voon 

Club Corner 
Adams, John Crilly, John Gibbon, Le Keogh and coxswain Lisa Thummus. 
In the heavyweight division, the Irish won the sil­ver medal, losing only to Kansas State. On the women's side, the Irish won the gold in the Open and Lightweight division. 
Last weekend, the rowing club traveled to Petersburough, Canada and participated in the Head ofTrent regatta. The Irish were one oftwo American squads in the race which had 54 boats total. Notre Dame entered three boats and they placed 17th, 23rd and 28th. 
"It was a very big trip and gave our club more exposure," commented team member Chris Ric­hardson. "Hopefully, by our results in Des Moines and Canada, the Administration will realize that our club is growing quickly and maybe give us varsity status." 
This weekend, the women's rowing team will travel to Boston and race in a very big regatta. The reason why the men's team cannot go is that this regatta has many varsity teams and can only accept a few club teams. Last year the men's team, which placed 18th, received priority over the women's team. So this year, the women will go, and maybe before the week is out the men's team, which is on the waiting list, will be accepted. 
"We really hope to be expected this year because this year, we have a much better team," said Ric­hardson. "I believe that we could do real well in Bos­ton, but since we are only a club team, we can only wait." 
Iowa retains No. 1 spot in poll; Wolverines move up to challenge 
Iowa remained No. 1 in the As­sociated Press college football poll yesterday but Michigan edged ahead of Oklahoma to set up a 1-2 show­down this Saturday, while surprising Army cracked the rankings for the first time in 23 years. 
The top three teams received 59 of the 60 first-place votes, with the other one going to sixth-ranked Penn State. 
Iowa is No. 1 for the third week in a row after defeating Wisconsin 23­
13. The Hawkeyes received 27 first­place votes and 1,146 of a possible 1,200 points from a nationwide panel · of sports writers and sportscasters. 
Michigan, which blanked Mic­higan State 31-0, received 20 first­Nebraska 34-24. Meanwhile, Arkansas climbed from sixth to fourth with 936 points following a 30-7 triumph over Texas Tech and Florida rose from seventh to fifth with 905 points by defeating Ten­nessee 17-10. 
Penn State, a 19-17 winner over Alabama, received the one first­place vote and 902 points. Alabama slipped from 1Oth to 15th. 
Nebraska moved up from ninth to seventh with 868 points and Auburn's bombing of Florida State enabled the Tigers to jump from 12th to eighth with 777 points. 
Rounding out the Top Ten are defending national champion Brig­ham Young, which trounced San Diego State 28-0 and vaulted from 11th to ninth with 685 points, and Air Force, which trimmed Navy 24-7 and shot from 13th to 1Oth with 624 points. 
.The Second Ten consists of Ohio State, Oklahoma State, Florida State, Baylor, Alabama, Georgia, LSU, UCLA, Army and Tennessee. 
Army's 45-14 rout of Boston Col­lege gave the Cadets a 5-0 record for the first time since 1950 and put them in the rankings for the first time since a No. 10 listing on Oct. 1, 1962.

Kleine out 4-6 weeks following knee injury 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Editor 
Junior starting defensive tackle Wally Kleine will be lost to the Notre Dame football team for the next four to six weeks, it was an­nounced yesterday. Kleine un­derwent successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sunday afternoon after injuring it during a rigorous team practice on Saturday. 
The injury, which at first was thought only to be a slight sprain, was fully realized on Sunday mor­ning when Kleine awoke to find that the knee had locked up on him. Upon further examination, it was discovered that he had torn some cartilage in the knee, as well as straining some liga­ments. 
"It's a tough loss for us," said Irish head coach Gerry Faust. "We hope to have Wally back for the last two to three games ofthe season, though. He couldn't have gotten through the season wit­hout the surgery." 
It is expected that senior nose tackle Eric Dorsey will move over to see time at Kleine's right tackle spot. In turn, senior Mike Kiernan and sophomore Matt Dingens would play more at nose tackle. Sophomore Bob Martz will switch over from left tackle to back up Dorsey on the right Side. 


Wally Kleine 
The 6-9, 274-pound Kleine ranks seventh in tackles for Notre Dame this season with 22 and is credited with causing one fumble. 
As a sophomore, Kleine started every game as he racked up 48 tackles. He led the Irish in tackles for lost yardage and was a first­team pick on the sophomore all­America team of Football News. 
Students are to bring applications, payment and their ID card to Gate 3 ofthe ACC on the specified day, and each student may present up to four applications and IDs.

Cavanaugh, 1·2, will challenge defending champion Stanford on Thursday at 9:00 at Cartier Field. 2-1 Stanford will be fresh off Sunday's 
10-0 blanking of Zahm. A 30-yard Dan O'Donnell field goal and a 31­yard Vince Calouri run provided the scoring for the victors. 
"We had one surprise for Holy Cross (the wishbone)," warns Pat­terson, "but we're going to have two for Stanford." 
In the other Leahy game on Thursday, 1-2 Zahm will face Alumni, 1-2, at Cartier at 7:00. All five of the Leahy Division teams are still in contention for post-season ac· tion. 
Dillon produced the other big up· set of the week by conquering previously unbeaten Morrissey, 7-6. Dillon's triumph means that the win­ners of Wednesday's 7:00 Dillon­Grace game and 8:00 Morrissey-Flanner contest will reach the playoffs from the Parseg­hian Division. Both games are at Car· tier Field. 
A 28-yard touchdown pass from Pangborn/Fisher eliminated the losers and secured Sorin's post­season berth. 
Carroll will face fellow 2-1 squad Howard Thursday at 10:00 at Cartier in a battle for the final Rockne 
playoff position. Howard won its second consecutive game, a 7-6 tri­umph over winless St. Ed's. Mike Dooley hit Tom Passinault for a .24­yard touchdown pass for Howard. 
Carroll's lone two points in its vic­tory came through no merit of its own. An errant snap by the Pangborn/Fisher center sailed over his punter's head and out of the end zone for a safety. 
Sorin hopes to secure a first-round 
bye in the playoffs at Cartier at 8:00 
Thursday when it faces 1-2 
Pangborn/Fisher. 
Two Sundays ago in the Leahy

If Notre Dame women's tennis coach Michele Gelfman had set her fall season goals any higher, she would only have been pleased with perfection. As it turned out, she al­most got it. 
Last weekend's conference cham­pionship in St. Louis was the capper on an outstanding fall warm-up for Gelfman's squad. Making its debut in Division I tennis, the Irish sailed through a schedule of second-class opponents and held their own against the challenging competition it faced. 
"I'm estatic about the way the girls played in these last six weeks," said Gelfman. "They played hard, practiced hard, and they drove themselves to improve the entire fall. I can't say enough about the dedication of the girls to achieve what they have. Their play was remarkable under the pressures of academics, and the balance they demonstrated was excellent." 

After a three week break from competition, which will consist of conditioning,lifting and some hit· ting, the Irish will play in the Rolex Invitational in mid-November. The 
experience will be essential because the spring season will formally in­troduce The team to big time women's tennis. Some tough Big Ten teams combined with other 
Division I heavyweights will provide enough reasons for more hard work and Gelfman is aware of necessary improvements. 
"We have to work on changing stratagies, our serve and volley games and our baseline consis­tency," said Gelfman. "We also have 
to improve our tenacity when it comes to putting points away." Led all season by the steady play of 
senior captain Susie Panther, the Irish will make few changes in per­sonnel over the winter. The singles lineup of Panther, Mary Colligan, 
Michele Dasso, lzzy O'Brien, Joanne Biafore and Tammy Schmidt proved their strength and will try to extend the momentum gained in the fall. 
The doubles teams of Panther­Dasso, Colligan-O'Brien, with Biafore and freshman Natalie Illig, were formidable as the season ended and can only get better as their court time together increases. 
The future looks very bright for the Notre Dame women's tennis program. The fall season was both a confidence builder and an indica­
tion for Gelfman of where improve­ment is needed, both in singles and doubles play. The hard work has paid dividends already and the 
spring should be an interesting and exciting season. Division I powers beware. ·There's a new kid on the block.
