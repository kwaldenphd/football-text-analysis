News Writer 
Grace Hall was vandalized early Sunday morning resulting in damage to several of its first floor facilities. 
The first floor men's room sustained the most extensive damage. 
A stall door was ripped from its hinges and its metal frame torn from the floor where it was anr.hored. Both were found in a heap of dented. twisted metal on the floor of the bath­room. The dents in the door and frame appeared to have been caused by a hammer or a similar type of heavy weapon. A mirror was also broken. 
Cabinet doors underneath the information desk across from thP main door of the building wnre ripped from their hinges and the telephone behind the desk was torn from the wall. The culprit apparently tried to pry open the r.ash box located there. without success. 
The glass on a first floor vending mar.hine, one of five in its area. was smashed and the machine's r.ontents stolen. The other four were untouched. 
The vandalism is thought to have occurred around 4 a.m. on Sunday. A resident of Grace heard noises at that time from his room, which he believed were coming from outside. 
It is now thought that they were probably coming from within as the vandalism was occurring, said Grace Rector Father Gerald Lardner. 
Hall Clerk Jonathan Halloran discovered the damage to the front desk and the vending ma­chine at 9 a.m. and telephoned Lardner, who then called Notre Dame Security. The damage to the bathroom was discovered later in the day. 
Members of the Security staff were unavailable for comment. 
Suspects have not been identi­fied yet, although steps have been taken within the hall to find further information. Signs have been posted in each sec­tion asking residents to tele­phone Security if they are aware of any relevant informa­tion. 
No damage to any of the hall's outer doors was re­ported. Grace's resident assis­tants ~ke final rounds at 2 a.m., when all outer doors are lor.ked. There is no hall monitor of any kind on duty after this time, said Mark Wattley, assis­tant rector. 
The culprit is not necessarily a resident of Grace, Wattley emphasized. No one without a key could easily gain access to the hall after 2 a.m., but the culprit might have been unwit­tingly admitted to the dorm by a resident. This is possible, as "there are always people around," according to Grace Hall Co-President Stephen Leinenweber.

Christmas  gifts  to

1990 HATE MIAMI CALENDAH: Sure they

beat us, but we can still hate the llurrieanes. The 1990 llate Miami calendar counts down the number of days until our next confrontation with Miami (October 20, 1990-and it's a home game) with a differ­ent player to hate each month. 
HOCK: No, not the Rockne Memorial, but a real rock. In many third world countries, people wash their laundry by bringing it down to the river and scrubbing it against a large boulder. Until the University installs washing machines and dryers in all of the men's dorms, (hint hint) a rock and a river might be the best way to get the wash done. However, there is one small problem. The mighty St. Joe may be just a little too polluted to clothes. Rumor has it that people fishing in the St. Joseph find that their eateh is already cooked. 
MIL SNOWBALL: Remember Mr. Snoweone? All you had to do is shave some iee eubes, add syrup, and you had a nice yummy snoweone. Mr. Snowball operates on the same prineiple (syrup is optional.) This way you ean have snowball fights all year round-just as long as you don't run out of lee. Just make sure you don't hit Father Tyson's window. 
DICK ADDIS DOLL: For those of you who ean · t get enough of the Channel 16 Weathergod. lie's cute! lie's cuddly! Just pull the string in his back and he'll give you the weather word of the day. 
DANCING DICK ADDIS DOLL: For diehard Dick Addis fans. This gift is basi­cally another version of the dancing flowers which are so popular this Christmas season. The Daneing Diek will boogie down to anything except musie by Hick Astley­the scourge of humankind. 
APPLE: A juicy, shiny, red apple is the perfect gift for that special prof. (And what a way to get in good with your prof right before finals.) 
BHOWN NOSE: This is the perfect gift for professors to give to their students when they sec students pull an apple out of their bookbags. It's a simple plastic schnoz with a big splotch of brown on the tip. One size fits all. 
DAHT VIDEO: DAHT may not have been the rousing success we all hoped it would be, but that DART video was exceptional. It's the perfect addition to anyone's video library. 
So there you have it, the hottest gift ideas for Christmas 1989. If all else fails, the Bookstore is always ready and willing to take just a little bit more of your money to invest in another Notre Dame sweatshirt. Happy holidays and happy shopping!

WORLD 

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev chided Presi­dent Bush at their Malta summit for not granting visas to thousands of Soviet citizens who want to live in the United States. On the flight back to Moscow Bush raised the hu­man rights issue by giving Gorbachev a list of divided spouses the United States claims are separated by Soviet refusal to grant one or the other an exit visa. Soviet offi­cials have estimated 4-5 million citizens will leave the country under a new law permitting the departure of most people who want to leave.

Divers managed to block most leaks in an Israeli oil tanker Monday that sank after developing engine troubles and officials hoped to refloat the vessel before its cargo causes an ecological disaster. Up to 60 tons of the ship's 660 tons of heavy oil have polluted the waters off this Mediterranean resort since the tanker went down Thursday after it stalled because of engine problems and was swamped by high seas. 
The PLO's campaign to win recognition in the General Assembly as the provisional government of Palestine broke down Monday and negotiations shiftnd to finding a face-saving retreat, diplomats said.They at­tributed the failure to upgrade the PLO to observer-nation status in the General Assembly to shallow support, divi­sions within the Palestine Liberation Organization and a 
U.S. threat to stop contributing to the United Nations.

The last obstacle between Leona Helmsley and sentencing was lifted Monday when a judge refused to set aside her tax evasion conviction. Mrs. Helmsley, owner of many luxury ho­tels, was convicted Aug. 30 of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her business empire. By denying a request 


to overturn the conviction and dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge Walker cleared the way for her Dec. 12 sentencing. 
Sonic booms set off by a descending space shuttle created ground motion that showed earthquakes may shake Los :'-ngeles skyscrapers more violently than once thought, scientists said Monday.The researchers found that the shuttles' characteristic twin sonic booms thumped 400 high-rise buildings in downtown L.A. Build­ings 20 to 30 stories tall tend to sway baek and forth once every 2 to 3 seconds, making it possible that "in an earthquake, the Los Angeles basin would preferentially amplify ground motion," Calteeh said in a news release.

Students earn tuition dollars through service 
By CRISTINA ORTIZ News Wnter 
Ninety-four Notre Dame stu­dents participated in a public service project set up by the Center for Social Concerns, this past summer, and in exchange for their commitment, received tuition funds. 
The Summer Service Project, initiated in 1980, is part of a memorial to James Andrews, a 1961 Notre Dame graduate who co-owned Universal Press Syndicate. "He was always con­cerned for the less fortunate of the community," said Sue Cun­ningham, coordinator of the Summer Service Projects and Urban Plunge programs. 
The CSC offers many public services ranging from tutoring elementary children to assisting in orphanages. 
Since its existence, the pro­gram has gained the enthusias­tic support of Notre Dame alumni clubs across the United States, said Cunningham. 
Many clubs pay a portion, if not all, of the student's stipends through the summer. The student is expected to de­vote 8 weeks of his/her summer to public service for the disad­vantaged. This is made possible through various agencies within the community. 
Through the combined efforts of the Andrews Memorial Pro­gram and the Notre Dame alumni clubs, the student re­ceives $1400 towards tuition, room and board. 
The selection process consists that it gives the participants a of an application along with chance to experience a different several interviews. "We are part of American Culture.

Hoosier Lottery seeks 
I I I 
an 1ncrease 1n w1nners 
INDIANAPOLIS (API -The lloosier Lottery will change the format of its weekly television game show to improve the odds of winning the top $1 million prize and offer a more gem~r­ous consolation prize. lottery officials announced Monday. 
Lottery Director Jack craw­ford said the changes, which will go into effect this Satu r­day, will reduce the finalist's odds of winning the top priz1~ to one in 2.7, compared with the old format's odds of one in four. 
Under tlw new format. the fi­nalist who fails to win anything in the final round will walk away with a $25,000 consola­tion prize, regardless of when the player drops out in the game's last round. 
Crawford said the changes were made to respond to viewer comments and to make the show more generous with prizes in light of higher-than­expected lottery ticket sales. 
"We feel that those people who participate by buying tick­ets need to be rewarded with better odds on winning our big prizes and increased generosity on behalf of the Hoosier Lot­tery," said Crawford. 
Through six weeks of the game show, only one person has won the top prize. Marilyn Bonavita of Indianapolis did that last Saturday. Crawford said viewers who have writtlm to him in recent weeks want to see more big winners and morn prizes awarded. 
Under the new format. the show should produce a $1 mil­

lion winner 1wery three weeks, 
said Crawford. 
With sales of $1 instant lot­

Gramm-Rudman tax cuts preclude a 'peace dividend' 
WASIIINGTON (AP) -De­spite a declaration Monday by !~resident Bush that he doesn't expect a "peace dividend" to result from reduced East-West tensions. many members of Congress are urging heftier spending on domestic programs as the military budget is re­duced. 
"We have a lot of demands at home, and there's no question about that," Bush said at a news conference in Brussels at the end of trip to a summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gor­hachev. "But I think it is pre­maturn to speak as some are at horne about a peace dividnnd ­take a lot of money out of de­fense and put it into othnr wor­thy causes." 
The president said the reason there can be no such windfall was that the Gramm-Hudman deficit-reduction law requires that he produce a budget for fiscal 1991 containing a short­fall of no more than $64 billion. 
The deficit for this budget year, which ends Sept. 30, is projected at about $110 billion. Bush will present his proposed budget to Congress on Jan. 22. 
"There just isn't a lot of, quote, excess money, unquote, floating around there," Bush told a news conference in Brus­sels, Belgium. 
Although members of Congress are split over the question, many believe it is time to impose deep cuts on the nearly $290 billion defense budget, which comprises about one-fourth of the government's $1.2 trillion annual spending. 
They cite three reasons: 

 
The easing of Cold War ten­sions 

 
The need to shrink the deficit 

 
A desire to replenish domestic programs that have been hit hard by Reagan-era spending cuts. 


"The more you cut from the military. the less damage you do to domestic programs to meet Gramm-Rudman targets," Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Monday. 
Frank has been a leader of a group of liberals pressing con­gressional leaders to slash about $20 billion off the Pen­tagon's budget and redistribute most of it among health, hous­ing, education and other do­mestic programs. 
But it is not just liberals who want to reduce the Defense De­partment's coffers. 
Conservative Hep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss .. chair­man of the House Veterans Af­fairs Committee, told reporters Monday that he would like to see next year's defense spend­ing frozen at 1990 levels and envisions savings by eventually bringing some U.S. troops home from Europe. 
"If we do have these extra monies I would like for them to go into the national debt and take about half the money and use it for domestic programs in the United States," Mont­gomery said. 

Since Frank's group made its proposals, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has begun consid­ering plans to shrink expected military spending rates by up to $180 billion over the next three to five years. 
Such a reduction sounds dramatic, but it would in fact do little to change the direction Pentagon spending has taken in recent years. 
Since 1986, military spending has decreasnd by an average of 3 percent annually when infla­tion is taken into account, even though the actual amount of money going to the Pentagon has incrnasnd each year.

Certain outer doors some­times stick in snowy conditions, and are difficult to close prop­erly. said Assistant Hector Vic­tor Krebs. Although the HA's secure the doors at 2 a.m. each night, students coming in after parietals who are unaware of the problem might fail to close a door completely. If this hap­pened, anyone could have gained access without a key, despite that the doors were locked. explained Krebs. 
Security, according to Krebs, "is a major issue here. The dorms are unguarded after the RA's are off-duty. All sorts of 
things could happen, especially in Grace and Flanner, the only (men's) dorms on campus where no students live on the first floors. except for one as­sistant rector in one of the two wings. Anything could happen on the first floor, especially in the other wing, and no one knows about it." 
Steps will be taken to insure all doors fully close, even in snow, and to guarantee that they remain locked. The possi­bility of an all-night monitor for Grace and other men's dorms will also be raised. Lardner said. 

"This is something more in­tense than ordinary dormitory vandalism," lw added. "We don't know what to make of it."

Fighting stalls evacuation of foreigners from Manila 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) -Fighting intensified today between rebels and loyal forces in the Makati financial dis­trict, where about 2,000 foreigners, in­cluding more than 200 Americans, have been trapped in hotels for five days. 
Efforts to evacuate foreigners held by the n~bels appeared to have stalled early today. 
A 60mm mortar round slammed into a squatter settlement near the Makati Medical Center about 6 a.m. (5 p.m. EST Monday). Ten people were taken to the hospital, including a 6-year-old girl who died. 
Two bombs exploded in the capital latn Monday, wounding two people. It was unclear if thPy were related to the coup attempt. which began Friday and has killed at least 71 people and woundnd more than 500. 
The U.S. Embassy recommended this morning that Americans living in Makati remain in their homes but avoid uppnr floors. lest they become targets for snipers. 
At lf~ast three people were killed in Makati Monday and 15, including one American. were wounded by sniper fire and shells. 
Troops loyal to the government of President Corazon Aquino, backed by three armored personnel carriers, be­gan moving under cover of fire toward the hotel district where the foreigners are. 
"Arc we going to win?" a colonel asked his men at the end of a briefing. "Yes. sir!" they shouted. 
IIc told his men not to fire unless they had a rebel in their sights. 
The Japanese Embassy recommended that Japanese citizens living in parts of the posh Makati district not under rebel tontrol leave for safer areas of Manila. 
EPA proposes restrictions on cancer-linked fungicides 
WASliiNGTON (AP)-The Environmental Protection Agency called for curbs Monday on the pesticide EBDC, saying widespread use of the chemical on scores of crops from apples to tomatoes poses an unrea­sonable cancer risk. 
The EPA proposed elimi­nating the use of the EBDC family of fungicides on 45 crops. but said its continued use on another 10 food products, including grapes, onions and cranberries, "do not present an unreasonable risk" to consumers. 
The proposed restrictions would eliminate from agri­cultural use about 80 per­cent to 90 percent of the es­timated 18 million pounds of EBDCs that are sold annu­ally in the United States, ac­cording to government and industry officials. 
EBDCs, or ethylene bis­dithiocarbamate, are a group of pesticides that have been used since the 1930s to control fungi and protect a wide variety of food crops against damage from mold, mildew and fungal diseases. The group includes the spe­cific fungicides maneb, mant cozeb and metiram. 
Environmentalists accused the EPA of moving too slowly, noting that no final regulation on EBDCs is likely to be issued until early 1991, and maintained that remain­ing uses being allowed by the EPA still pose serious health concerns. ·. 
It estimated 500 Japanese remained in Makati, including about 300 trapped in the hotels. 
A statement telephoned to news or­ganizations from a rebel spokesman, Capt. Albert Yen, said the insurgents would release the foreigners to dispel suspicions they were being held hostage. 
The statement said the foreigners would be free to leave the hotels at 10 
a.m. Tuesday and would be taken to Manila's airport aboard shuttle buses. 
Yen said the move did not indicate the rebels were about to end their bid to oust Mrs. Aquino. 
"That's the farthest thing that we could do," he said. "We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the last drop of our blood." 
About 400 mutineers from the elite Scout Rangers were holding 22 build­ings in the Makati district, where many foreign embassies and residences of foreign diplomats and businessmen lie. 
About 400 rebels continued to occupy Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila. Their leader refused to surrender and threatened to blow up the base's planes. 
President Bush called Mrs. Aquino on arriving back in Washington from the Malta superpower summit and follow­ing a visit with NATO allies in Belgium to express concern for the lives of Americans in the Makati hotels. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted Bush as telling Mrs. Aquino: "'I understand some Americans are in the hotels.... Can we get those people out? I'm very concerned about their lives and their safety."' 
"She assured him they were doing ev­erything possible to protect American 
lives," Fitzwater said. 
Greenpeace quelled in sea melee 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -The Navy outmuscled Green­peace anti-nuclear protesters Monday, crippling their vessels and towing them out of an area where they tried unsuccessfully to halt the test launch of a Tri­dent 2 missile. 
The high seas drama took place in the Atlantic 50 miles off the Florida coast just be­fore the nuclear-powered sub­marine Tennessee unleashed the $26.5 million missile on a test that put the Trident 2 pro­gram back on track after two explosive failures in the first three undersea launches. 
"We did a perfect launch, just beautiful," Vice Adm. Roger Bacon, commander of the At­lantic Submarine Fleet, said at a news conference. 
The Navy said its ships had to "shoulder" aside a large ship carrying protesters, and cap­ture and tow away two high­speed rafts called Zodiacs from the launch area.

down its smoke stacks to stop its engines and that Navy divers had sliced the fuel lines and punctured the pontoons on the Zodiacs. 
Bacon said hoses were used and that Navy sailors in rafts cut the fuel lines on one of the Zodiacs after the other broke down in heavy seas. 
Three Navy helicopters made life even more miserable for the two men in each of the Zodiacs by hovering overhead, making already choppy seas even chop­pier. 
Shannon Fagan, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said a Navy ship, the 254-foot submarine support ship USS Grasp, left two gashes in the hull of the USS Greenpeace, a 190-foot ocean­going tug. She said the largest, about 3 feet long, was stuffed with mattresses to keep water out. 
Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, a Navy spokeswoman, said Navy officials at the scene reported only one hole about 1 foot in diameter in the Greenpea-ce hull. 

"This is a terrible outrage," said Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace USA, in a statement. "This is an unbri­dled act of aggression against a peaceful protest in interna­tional waters." 
Fagan said Greenpeace was considering legal action against the Navy. 
Greenpeace had successfully used the ship and Zodiacs to block a Trident 2 launch at­tempt July 28. But the Navy was ready for them this time. 
"We were more prepared to­day because we looked at what they tried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessary today to clear the area," Bacon said. 
Once the protesters' vessels were muscled outside the 5,000-yard diameter safety cir­cle, the Tennessee sent the 44­foot missile shooting out of a tube in the deck. It broke the Atlantic surface, ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean target several thousand miles away.

EDITORIAL 
Laundry tragedy calls for fresh start 
The Joss of St. Michael's Laundry and the shortage of coin-operated machines on campus has been t~e topic of several humorous columns and cartoons m The Observer lately. But as paper deadlines and finals approach, the shortage of machines on campus will not seem quite so funny. 
Unfortunately, with the loss of St. Michael's laundry service, there are just too few machines for the men and women of this campus to use. The Administration ha~ done little to solve the problem in the past few weeks and seems unlikely to remedy it soon. We rec­ommend two steps to remedy the immediate machine shortage and offer several suggestions for the plan­ning of the new laundry facility. 
First, to remedy the immediate shortage of ma­chines, many of the women's dorms have set aside hours when men are permitted to use their machines. We suggest that those women's dorms that have not set aside times for male students follow suit. 
Second, the University will have to increase the num­ber of machines on campus before next semester. We suggest that the University install washers and dryers in all of the men's dorms over Christmas Break to al­leviate the problem. 
Third, we recognize the need for institutional laun­dry at Notre Dame, but recommend several changes to the planners of the new facilities. 
Laundry service should be optional for both men and women. We realize the necessity for institutional laun­dry but fail to see the necessity of imposing a $50.00 fee on all male students when some do not use the facility. 
In addition, the old laundry policy was sexist: men's laundry was picked up from their dorms while women wanting to use the laundry facility had to lug their bags down to St. Michael's themselves. This policy must be changed for the new facility. 
Furthermore, as some of the men's dorms do not have space for a sufficiently large laundry room to ac­commodate their residents, we suggest that the new facility include coin-operated machines on the premises.
In the meantime, let's hope the University buys us new laundry machines for Christmas.

Helping the needy offers valuable lessons 
Dear Editor: 
For four years i have been a student at Notre Dame, but today I learned one of my most important lessons, and it didn't happen in a classroom. Today I, along with 15 other Navy ROTC midshipmen, worked at the Shelter for the Homeless and I learned a lesson about real life. 
Formerly I had been quick to complain and feel sorry for my­self. I got upset if I had to wait more than a few minutes in a dining hall line. If my home­work caused me to get less sleep than I desired, disgrun­tled I became. I worried be­cause I might not be able to af­ford the boots and bindings to go with my new skis. I realize now what a fool I have been. 
I arrived at the Shelter around 11 p.m., after most of the people were asleep. But my friend, Don, and I helped a paraplegic man take a shower and get ready for bed. Bill, as I shall call this man, had little use of his legs and had trouble moving. His legs and feet were deformed, and the smell of his clothing was awful. 
When I first saw him I felt very uncomfortable and wanted to leave, but Dan had been helping him before I got there and had to leave, so it was my turn to help Bill. 
As I helped him get dressed after his shower, I began to talk with him and soon was telling him about my family and friends. He began to trust me and started asking about what I wanted to do after college. The more I talked with Bill, the more I realized that he was a human being. just like me. Even though he was handicapped and I was not, we were both children of God, and I realized that he deserved to be treated as such. What really made an impression on me is that the whole time I spent with Bill he never complained. Here was a 44-year-old handicapped man with no family, little money. and no home, and unlike my­self, he did not look for things to get upset about. 

I watched television and mad periodicals. so l was aware of the plight of the homeless in Amerka. But until today I n1wnr really understood what it meant to be in that situation. My eyes havn dPfinitely bcnn opened and I want to give morn of my time to help others. We all think we have so many things to do, such as study. but why not help those in need, in­stead of watching a movie or playing video games'? 
Every one of us has been blessed, for we arc able to at­tend a great university. But when we sit down for dinner we should thank the Lord that we have strong minds and bodies, a place to live, and enough money to keep us comfortable. l will do this, but in addition I will give thanks that l was for­tunate enough to meet Bill; for I will never forget what I have learned from him.

Honor Code receives midpoint evaluation 
Dear Editor: 
The University of Notre Dame initiated a four-year experi­mental Academic Code of Honor in the spring semester of 1988. As we reach the halfway point of this experimental period, the University Academic Code of Honor Committee would like to express thanks to those who have contributed their sugges­tions and provided feedback. But two years remain in this experiment -time for changes to take place between now and 1992. 
So, at this midpoint. the committee would like to ask for further student and faculty in­put. To facilitate the opportu­nity to provide input, the committee has planned a Code of Honor Open Forum. This fo­rum will take place tonight from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the Dooley Room on the first floor of LaFortune. 
The students and faculty who comprise the committee will be present to answer any ques­tions about the Code of Honor. but more importantly, the committee will be available so that issues of concern and sug­gestions for improvement can be expressed. 

The primary purpose in pro­viding this Open Forum is for those of us on the committee to become more edueated about student and faculty opinion. We are looking forward to hearing opinions from the members of the Notre Dame community on how the Code of Honor is pro­gressing.

'Steel Magnolias' depicts women as suNivors 
MICHELLE BERNINGER 
accent writer 

"Steel Magnolias" is about women. This Herbert Hoss Film perhaps ev!m sets the stage for a new trend in the strength of "female bonding," li1r a change. 
Although quite an odd combi­nation, Dolly Parton, Sally Field, Julia Hobnrts, Daryl Ilannah, Olympia Dukakis, and Shirley Mael.aim~ work to give an outstanding portrayal of friendship and loyalty which supports them through the cy­des of life -birth, marriage, and death. 
"The film also asks 'which is the stronger sex?' by presenting the lives of these women and their relation­ships with men not one being ideal." 

On the surface, "Steel 

Magnolias" is about survivors 
and their abilities to maintain 
stnmgth and even a sense of 

humor in the face of adversity. 
Despite their individual hard­
ships, the women are always 

able to lind something to laugh 
about. 

The film also asks "which is the stronger sex?" by present­ing the lives of these women and their relationships with men -not one being ideal. Along with being depicted as sources of loneliness and tragedy, the men in their lives are also shown to be weaker when life's challenges get toughest. 
For instance. Field's charac­ter, M'Lynn, reveals one woman's courage in dealing with the sickness, coma. and eventual death of her beloved daughter, Shelby (Hoberts). Whereas the men turn their backs on adversity as a way of coping, M'Lynn remains with Shelby until the bitter end, rep­resenting the warm-hearted yet iron-willed "steel magnolia." Even at her daughter's grave, 

Furs' new album: Missing the needed balance of lyrics and music 
BRIAN GRUNERT 
accent writer 

Since the release of their self­titled debut album, the Psychedelic Furs have ev.olved stylistically from a sometimes brash. sometimes brooding punk style to a melodic bright­ness, characteristic of their re­cent material. Along with their musical development, the band's lyrical advancement has been invigorated by the talents of singer Hichard Butler. 
After live albums and hit singles such as "Pretty in Pink" and "Heartbreak Beat," the Furs have established them­selves as one the premier bands on the college scene as well as in the rest of the music indus­try. However, Book of Days, the band's most recent effort, falls short of the standards they have set for themselves by ear­lier accomplishments. 
The songs "Torch," 

"Parade,"and "Mother-Son" are 
good examples of this old ag­
gressiveness, emphasizing the 
guitar playing John Ashton. 
However, Ashton is far less in­
novative than in past years, and 
his lackluster performance 
wrecks whatever potential these 
tunes might have. 
Although many of the tracks on Book of Days are sluggish musically. Butler provides solid lyrics for the album. !lis style of poetic abstraction is espe­cially prevalent in "Wedding," "I Don't Mine," and "Should God Forget." Butler continues to write in broken sentences, utilizing obscure plays on words, and assuming an at­tacking, self-righteous stance: Without specifics, he is able to relay his message. 
Unfortunately, the musical repetitiveness detracts from and alienates the abstractness of Butler's words and the raspiness of his voice. The in­terplay between bright melodies and obscure lyrics is ·obliterated, and eventually the vocal and lyrical styles become part of the overall monotony. 
Two bright spots on the al­bum are "House" and the title track, "Book of Days." "House" is reminiscent of some of the Furs earlier material, lively yet tense. "Book of Days" shows off a bit of experimentation as Ashton plays an acoustic gui­tar, a perfect playground for Butler's absorbing ideas. These two tunes seem to have the del­icate balance of music with lyrics that is missing in the rest of the songs. 
Despite flashes of variety and innovation, Book of Days is not an exciting step in the develop­ment of the Psychedelic Furs. It is either a regression or an in­significant step in a new direc­tion that is met with stale indif­ference. 
M'Lynn is comfortnd not by hnr husband or sons, but by her four female friends. 
Unlike Parton, who has little difficulty rev1)aling her own personal Soutlwrn charm through her part as an affec­tionate. witty hair salon owner, Hannah mnnts the challenge of deviating from her beautiful­woman roles of the past. She must play a homnly, strictly re­ligious outsider who hides bP­hind thick hornnd-rimnwd glasses and stringy brown hair for most of tlw film. · 
MacLaine's pnrformance as the ill-tempered, cynical Ouiser, adds the humorous nlenHmt to the plot. Although Ouisnr is tlw brunt of most jokes, she, too, is not without tlw kincllwss that binds her to tlw others. Tlw close camaraderie that the six share bridges tlw boundaries of reputation, along with age and social status. 
The film has quill) a story bP­
··-hind it as wnfl. For tho screen­play writer, Hobert Harling, "Steel Magnolias" was written as a way of d1~aling with his grief aftnr the loss of his sister to diabetes. By filming in Harling's hometown of Natchitoches, Louisiana. Tri­Star Pictums was able to cap­turn the people, events, and aura of the close-knit commu­nity which nurtured the story. Many people who had been a part of Harling's sister's life were cast to replay events from their own pasts befom the camera. You may start to pat yours1)lf on the back near the end of the movie because you haw) not yet shed a tear watching this sup­posedly bittersweet film. 1\Jot so fast. In a climactic funeral scene, Field portrays the help­lessness of a mother who has just lost her child so effectively that within minutes the audi­ence is sobbing. Despite its sadness, "Steel Magnolias" offers optimism. Through Hannah's character, Annelle, Harling even gives us a new, hopeful outlook on death. Above all. the film makes the audience see that things aren't always as bad as they seem, and that you can and will sur­vive.

Last second shot lifts Georgia Tech 

(AP) Dennis Scott scored 42 points, including a fallaway bank shot with one second left that gave No. 18 Georgia Tech a 93-92 victory over No. 22 Pittsburgh Monday night in the opening game of the Big East­ACC Challenge. 
Scott, who was 8-for-14 on 3­pointers, got the ball near the lane with four seconds left and then drove toward the basket, pulling up for the winning shot. 
Jason Matthews had given Pitt the lead at 92-91 with two free throws with nine seconds left. 
But Georgia Tech (3-0) ad­vanced the ball to midcourt and called a timeout to set up the winning play for Scott. The ju­nior swingman averaged 29.5 points in the Yellow Jackets' first two games. 
Kansas 103 
Tenn.-Martin 48 
Terry Brown scored 21 points and Kansas started the second half with a 32-4 run Monday night as the No. 2 Jayhawks routed Division II Tennessee­Martin 103-48. 
Mark Randall scored 19 points and had 14 rebounds for Kansas (7 -0). Rick Calloway had 12 points and Kevin Pritchard 10. 
The Jayhawks capitalized on numerous turnovers by Tennessee-Martin (3-3), which had nearly twice as many fouls. Kansas' only problem was at the free-throw line, going 11­for-27. 
Oklahoma 130,
Angelo St. 62 
Oklahoma scored 31 consecu­tive points in the first half Monday night and the 12th­ranked Sooners routed Angelo State 130-62. 
Oklahoma (3-0) is averaging 149 points per game and has won by an average margin of 
78.3 points. The Sooners' 68­point victory over the Division II Rams was their smallest this season. 
William Davis scored 10 of his game-high 22 points during the run. Davis, a senior for­ward who has been Oklahoma's 
leading scorer in each of its games, also had a game-high 13 rebounds. He is averaging 
25.7 points and 13.7 rebounds. 
LSU 116 
Lamar 76 
Ninth-ranked Louisiana State went to a man-to-man defense· with about six minutes to go in the first half, broke open a close game and rolled to a 116­76 victory over Lamar Monday behind the 30 points of Chris Jackson. 
LSU (3-1) led 28-25 when the Tigers switched out of the zone they had used from the tip-off. Lamar got just seven more points before intermission and only two -on a pair of free throws by Victor Trahan -in the final 4:32. 
Jackson had 18 of his points in the final 6:40 of the first half as LSU opened a 60-32 halftime lead. 

Missouri 86 
Creighton 79 
Freshman Travis Ford made three 3-pointers as Missouri closed the first half with a 32-9 run Monday night and the fourth-ranked Tigers beat Creighton 86-79. 
Missouri (5-0) trailed 28-20 with 8:16 remaining in the half after Matt Roggenburk made three straight 3-pointers. Nathan Buntin then made a 7­foot hook shot, starting the run. 
Creighton's leading scorer, Chad Gallagher, committed his third foul at 5:16 of the first half. Ford's 3-pointer gave the Tigers their first lead at 33-32 and Missouri capitalized on the absence of the 6-foot-1 0 Gallagher, outscoring the Jays 22-5. 
Louisville 104 
Cleveland St. 77 
Felton Spencer was 8-for-8 from the field and scored 21 points Monday night as No. 11 Louisville used its superior size and quickness to beat Cleveland State 104-77. 
The Cardinals ( 4-1) made 9 of their first 10 shots. LaBradford Smith and Tony Kimbro set the 
pace with consecutive 3-point­
ers in the first 1:10 and Keith 
Williams' turnaround jumper at 
the 13:52 mark made it 23-8.

Baseball winter trade talks heat up 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) ­Free agents Hobin Yount and Mark Davis held ofT making de­cisions Monday, putting several possible trades on hold at baseball's winter meetings. 
The Chicago Cubs said they were told by Yount's agent, his brotlwr Larry. that nothing was imminent. The Cubs are among the teams making multi­year, $3 million-per-season of-, fers to Yount, the American League's Most Valuable Player. 
"We called this afternoon to lind out the situation and they said no decision would be made at the meetings," Cubs presi­dent Don (;renesko said. 
As usual, there was more talking than trading. The New York Yankees sent Don Slaught to Pittsburgh for Jeff Hobinson and a minor leagunr in the only definite deal, while rumors swirled about Joe Carter and Mike Greenwell. 
The annual draft of players left off 40-man rosters did produce some familiar names. Mike Dunne, one of the best rookie pitchers in 1987, was taken by San Diego, while Sil Campusano, once Toronto's most promising prospect, was selected by Philadelphia.

of collegiate fencing. Mlie's a 
tough man in the last bout." 
The Irish will next travel to 

State College, Pa., on January 
19 for the U.S.F.A. Collegiate 
Open. 
One bright spot out of the weekend was the fine results from the Saint Mary's squad. While only a club sport with minimal experience for some members, the Belles managed to wrest five bouts from North Carolina and four bouts from Northwestern in a losing effort. 
Mlnitially, I was hoping that we'd get two victories off each team," said Marx, who also coaches the Saint Mary's squad. MThe girls have really good team competitiveness, and are very supportive. They had the desire to win." 
For the Belles, Leigh Voyt was 4-4 on the day, while both Laura Curtin and captain Heather Briggs were 2-6. Christina Vellucci went 1-7 in her first ever collegiate fencing action. 
M(Vellucci) was really the biggest surprise of the day, be­cause she hadn't had much fencing experience," said Marx of the North Carolina native. 
As if he isn't busy enough al­ready, Irish assistant fencing coach Mike Marx competed this weekend in the Dominguez Open foil competition against some of the top foilists in the country, coming away with top honors. 
Marx, who cruised to an in­credible 15-0 mark in the meet, knocked off some noteworthy names, including former Irish standout All-American Tim Glass and 1985 world champi­onship team member Ed Kaihatsu, the latter presently a teammate of Marx's with L'Escrime du Lac fencing club. 
"Maybe I was angry !about the Irish performance!. Maybe I was just relaxed, I don't know," said Marx, whose last competi­tion came in the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. Ml haven't feneed like that in eight years. It really felt good." 
The next challenge for the versatile Irish coach will come this weekend as he will meet even tougher competition in a North American circuit event in Louisville, Ky. 
his first state of the game ad­dress, said he did not think there would be a work stoppage next season. lie also talked about broadening baseball's interest in Europe and re­iterated that a timetable for expansion will come within 90 days of a new contraet between players and owners. 
It remained uncertain. how­ever, when free agents Yount and Davis would announce their plans. 
Yount is being wooed by big offers from Milwaukee, California, San Diego and the Cubs. He has played his entire career with the Brewers and they, along with the free­spending Angels, appeared to be the favorites to get him. 
"We don't have anything to say one way or the other right now," Angels general manager Mike Port said. "Everyone ex­cept us was going around yes­terday saying we had him." 
If the Angels get Yount, they are rumored to be interested in paekaging Devon White and Kirk McCaskill to Cleveland for the hard-hitting Carter. San Diego also might be more will­ing to trade young catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. for Carter, if Yount signed with San ·Diego. 
While Larry Yount did busi­ness by telephone from Arizona, the agents for Davis came to Nashville. 
Alan and Randy Hendricks met Monday with San Diego general manager -and newly named vice president -Jack McKeon to talk about Davis, the National League Cy Young 
winner,  staying  with  the  
Padres.  
"We  don't  have  any  

timetable," Alan Hendricks said. "We'll try to it, as lawyers say. with all deliberate speed." 
Philadelphia, the team Davis started with, has entered the big-bucks bidding and has thrown in another incentive ­the chance for Davis to become a starter. 
Davis was a success starter in the minors but struggled in that role in the majors. Now a successful reliever, Davis may want another chance in some­one's rotation. 
The Yankees are anxious to get Davis and, if they can't get him, perhaps sign free agent Jeff Reardon. The Yankees are interested in Chicago White Sox reliever Bobby Thigpen, but won't make a move until set­tling their situation with Davis and Heardon.

Miami 2nd in AP poll, but not yet satisfied 
COHAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -The University of Miami moved two steps closer to its third national championship this decade. 
After the llurrieanes (10­
1) improved two places to seeond in Monday'·s Associated Press poll to No. 2, first-year coach Dennis Eriekson quickly assessed his team's chances of overtaking No. 1 Colorado. 
"We're excited about that." Erickson said, "because it puts us in a position when~. if we focus in and take care of business at tlw Sugar Bowl against Alabama. we'vp, got the opportunity to win the national championship. 
"If we're able to beat Alabama and Notre Dame
000 

were to beat Colorado, then I would say that because of where we're ranked right now, our chances are pretty good." 
Miami will play in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 against Alabama (1 0-1). which fell from seeond to seventh following a 30-20 loss at Auburn Saturday. The Buffaloes ( 11-0) will play in the Orange Bowl against Notre Dame (11-1), which moved up one spot to fourth. Michigan ( 10-1 l still is No. 3 and will play No. 12 Southern Cal in the Hose Bowl. 
If Miami loses and Notre 
Dame wins, the Fighting 
Irish stand to win their second consecutive national 
championship. 
Miami finished No. 1 in 
1983 and 1987 and No. 2 in 
1986 and 1988. The 
Hurricanes' only stumble 
this year was a 24-10 loss at 
Florida State. They ended 
Notre Dame's 23-game 
winning streak with a 27-10 
victory Nov. 25. 
Miami received four first­
place votes and 1.407 points, 
while Colorado received 55 
first-place votes and 1,492 
of a possible 1,500 points 
from a nationwide panel of 
sports writers and 
broadcasters. 
Michigan received the 
other first-place vote and 
1,374 points. Notre Dame's 
point total was 1,323. 
Rounding out the Top 10 
are Florida State, Nebraska, 
Alabama, Tennessee, Auburn 
and Arkansas. 
Florida State, winners of nine in a row since op«ming the season with two losses, moved up one place to fifth after beating Florida 24-17 Saturday. Nebraska, which was idle, advanced from No. 7 to No. 6. Tennessee remained eighth after defeating Vanderbilt 17-10. 
Auburn jumped two places to No. 9 following its victory over Alabama, and Arkansas fell one spot to No. 10 following a 38-24 win over Southern Methodist. 
LAKE FOHEST, Ill. {AP) -It ain't over 'til it's over but.
000 

With three games remaining, the Bears still have a mathe­matical chance to make the NFL playoffs for the sixth straight year. But for all prac­tical purposes, their season is 
over.  
"We  got  to  realize  we've  
fallen  into  that  category  of  
teams  that  don't  make  the  

playoffs," Coach Mike Ditka said at his weekly news confer­ence at Bears headquarters. 
"I haven't been there for a long time," he said. "It's part of life. I can accept it. I don't like it. I don't relish it... 
The opera may not be over until the Fat Lady sings, but the Bears' football extravaganza ­which some have likened to a soap opera in recent years ­hit the lowest note of the past half-dozen years Sunday night with a 27-16 loss to the Vikings at Minnesota. 
They are 6-7, under .500 for the first time since December 1983. 
A year ago, the Bears were 12-4. 
"We've got 18 or 19 kids who are first-or second-year men, and we're a little different. They don't respond the same way the veterans did a couple years ago," Ditka said. 
But he said he doesn't regret any personnel decisions. "These are the guys we want to go to the well with," he said. 
For Chicago to make the playoffs for a sixth consecutive year, the Vikings and Green Bay Packers -8-5 and tied atop the NFC Central -would virtu­ally have to collapse. 
A wild-card spot in postsea­son is further out of reach. The wild-card leaders, the New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams, are 9-4. 
"Our goal is to go out and
00. 
win three football games come heck or high water," Ditka said. "We're going to try to do it by playing better football than. we played, by playing more aggressive football than we played and more intelligent football than we played.". 
The Packers are one of the three teams Chicago has left to play. The Bears play host to Detroit on Sunday, then greet Green Bay before the schedule finale at San Francisco on Dec. 24. 
Ditka said he thought that if a couple of third-down plays had gone differently, the Bears could have beaten the Vikings. He also was critical of a few calls by the game officials. 
"I think it's justified to say somebody missed some plays," he said. 
Several Bears limped away from Minnesota with injuries and may not play next week, in­cluding halfback Neal Anderson (ankles), defensive lineman William Perry (knee), guard John Wojciehowski (back), tackle Jim Covert (hamstring) 
. and cornerback Lemuel Stinson (knee). Ditka is considering replacing Mike Tomczak with Jim 
· Harbaugh at quarterback if Harbaugh's hand, injured in Pittsburgh three weeks ago, has mended. The coach praised Anderson, a 1,000-yard-a-year rusher who hasn't been able to reach terms on a new contract and could be a free agent at the end of the season.

"I think he's as good as any player in football right now running the football," said Ditka. "I hope he's always a Bear." 
The Bears' lack of success on 
the gridiron has translated into 
no-shows among the Chicago­
area media at Halas Hall. Two 
dozen reporters showed up for 
Monday's news conference, half 
the number on hand two 
months earlier when the team 
was undefeated. 
Ditka offered a kinder and 
gentler interview for media 
used to his usual brusque and 
flippant approach to many 
questions. 
His boss, who gave Ditka a 
vote of confidence last week, 
had a smile on his face when he 
spotted reporters Monday. 
'Tm trying to laugh so I 
don't cry. I'm trying to stay 
even keel," said Bears president· 
Mike McCaskey. 
What hurts Chicago fans is 
that the Bears started off the 
season 4-0, with wins over 
Cincinnati, Minnesota and 
Philadelphia -all apparently 
playoff bound. Hopes were high 
the team could capture its sec­
ond pro football title since the 
glorious Super Bowl XX that 
capped the 1985 season. 
But then Chicago lost seven of the next nine games, including the first-ever season sweep by Tampa Bay. 
The players, however, haven't given up. 
"We just got to hope its works out," said linebacker Ron Rivera. "You never know, stranger things have happened. We have three games and mathematically we're not out of it."
