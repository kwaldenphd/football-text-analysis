Terrorists take hostages, hold three buildings, kill newsman in D. C. 
WASHINGTON [AP] · In bizarre sequence, terrorist gunmen in­vaded the headquarters of a Jewish organizaion, a Moslem religious center and Washington's City Hall yesterday, killing a radio newsman and seizing scores of hostages. 
A handful of black men, 9 to 11 by police reckoning, captured their hostages during the day and still held at least 80 people at three different locations early Thursday. 
Police ringed the three build­ings, and sealed off the areas involved, including Pennysylvania Avenue, close to the White House, and Massachusetts Avenue, in the heart of embassy Row. 
The gunmen, armed with rifles, shotguns, some automatic weapons and a machete, were thought to be members of the predominantly black Hanafi Moslem sect, victim­ized by a mass murder in Washing­ton four years ago. 
Their apparent ringleader said he wanted revenge for ~he 1973 killing of the seven Hanafi Mos­lems, six of them his children. 
He demanded that the people he holds responsible · leaders · be delivered to the terrorists holding nearly 60 hostages at the head­quarters of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish service organization. 
Khalifa Hamaas, Abdul Khaalis also demanded, and got, cancel­lation of American showings of the film "Mohammad, Messenger of God," when he said he was an affront to his religion. His were the only public demands. 
The slain newsman was Maurice Williams, 24, a black reporter for WHUR, a station affiliated with Howard University. Williams was killed by a gun shot during the takeover at the District of Columbia Building, two blocks from the White House. 
There was shooting at the B'nai B'rith building too, where four to six men, led by Abdul Khaalis, terrorized office workers in a late morning invasion. 
Eight people ther were reported wounded · shot, stabbed or beaten. 
Four more were injured at the District Building, one of them City Councilman · Marion Barry, who was shot in the chest. 
There were no known casualties at the third site, the Islamic Center, a mosque on Washington's Em· 
bassy Row. Federal agents said three gunmen there were armed with two shotguns and a rifle. 
Late last night, a police spokes­man said foreign diplomats were negotiating with the same gunmen he said were at B'nai B'rith, holding their hostages in an un­finished cafeteria on the eighth floor. 
Two other deputy police chiefs were conducting negotiations with the intruders at the District Build· ing and at the mosque. 
Police said the episodes at the mosque and at B'nai B'rith are a coordinated operation. They said there was no proof that the City Hal! takeover was linked to the other two. But it appeared to be. 

It all happened within hours. First came the strike at B'nai B'rith, the Jewish organization headquarters seven blocks north of the White House. Then at least one gunman invaded the islamic Cen­ter, a mosque on Embassy Row taking 15 hostages. Then came the shootings at the District of Colum­bia building, within sight of the White House grounds. 
Police said they believed 8 to 10 hostages were being held by the gunmen at the District building, with an undetermined number of

FDA to ban saccharin because of cancer danger 
WASHINGTON [AP] -The Food and Drug Administration announc­ed yesterday it is banning saccha­rin, the only artificial sweetner approved for use in the United States, because it causes cancer in laboratory animals. 
Acting FDA Commissioner. 

Sherwin Gardner said it will take at 
least until July to complete the 
administrative requirements before 
the ban goes into effect. But he 
called on manufacturers "to dis­
continue use of saccharin as soon 
as possible, even while we are · 
drafting the documents needed to 
accomplish this action." 
The FDA said it was not ordering a recall of the many soft drinks and foods containing the sugar sub­stitute, saying tests "do not in­dicate an immediate hazard to public health." 
A similar ban was announced simultaneously by the Canadian government whose scientific stud­ies were the basis for the U.S. action. _ 
The Canadian study involved feeding 100 rats a diet of 5% pure saccharin for their entire lives, from conception until death. Four­teen of those rats developed can­cerous bladder tumors compared to two such tumors in a group of 100 animals give!! no saccharin. 
The FDA order was denounced by ~n officer of Sweet 'N Low, a 
Terrorists hold hostages in D.C.

workers barricaded in their offices. 
Mayor Walter E. Washington was for a time locked in his own office before he was able to leave the building. 
City Council President Sterling Tucker, first repqfted a hostage, later was found to have eluded the gunmen. But councilman Marion Barry was shot in the chest, underwent surgery and was repor­ted in stable condition. 
At B'nai B'rith, Daniel Thursz, the executive vice president, said 
large saccharin user. "Any call for 
a ban of saccharin is an outrageous 
and harmful action based on flimsy 
scientific evidence that has absolu­
tely no bearing on human health," 
said Marvin E. Eisenstadt, execu­
tive vice president of the company. 
"It is an action that provides no 
public benefit, and indeed, could 
cause great harm to the millions of 
Americans who need an artificial 
sweetner for medical reasons and 
as an aid in weight control." 
Commissioner Gardner said he could not assess the economic impact of the FDA's decision but that it would be "substantial, no question ~bout it.'' 
Gardner said his agaency would consider the possibility of classify­ing saccharin as a prescription drug to enable diabetics and other s who can't consume sugar to obtain it with their doctor's consent but that any such decision is at least months away. 
One other artificial sweetner, Aspartame, has been developed but has never been marketed. The FDA approved the substance in 1974 but then withdrew its appro­val in 1975 when it became suspicious of safety data submitted by the manufacturer. The agency is now reviewing its action but any final decision is at least a year away.

The 19th annual Collegiate Jazz 
Festival, the oldest and largest 
festival of its kind in existence 
today, will be held at Stepan Center 
on April 1 and 2. Michael T. 
Dillon, chairman of this year's 
festival. announced the schedule of 
events and guests who will serve as 
judges for the weekend's activities. 
Aided by a $1000 grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts, 
Dillon has secured the services of 
six professional musicians and 
critics to serve as judges. This 
year's festival is highlighted by the 
return of the celebrated "Judges' 
Jam" after a one-year absence. 
Tentatively set to serve as judges 
are: Bob James, composer, arran­
ger, pianist, and -producer; Dave 
Sanborn, alto sax; Randy Brecker, 
trumpet; Will Lee, bass; Steve 
Gadd, drums; and Dan Morgen­
stern, free lance author, writer, 
and critic. Charles Suber, editor 
for Downbeat magazine, will serve 
as master of ceremonies. 
Sixteen collegiate bands and 
combos have been selected to 
participate in the festival on the 
basis of taped auditions. The . 
Lauderdale guide to be distributed 
The Notre Dame Social Commis­
sion is distributing a Fr. Lauder­
dale guide for students vacationing 
in Florida over spring break. 
Kevin Saddler, social commis­sioner, and Mike Orlando, a native of the Fr. Lauderdale area, pre­pared the five-page pamphlet des­cribing the city's bars, restaurants, and stores. In addition, the guide contains the names of popular radio stations and the locations of hospi­tals in the Fr. Lauderdale area. 
Saddler urged students to take advantage of the service by picking up the pamphlet near the mailbox in their individual halls or at the Student Union office anytime to­day. He also requested that students vacationing together share a single pamphlet as a limited number of the guides are available. 

Swimathon raises $1700 for cancer 
Over $1700 was raised for the American Cancer Society in last Sunday's Swimathon sponsored by Notre Dame's Circle K volunteer organization. 
All of the swimmers were from St. Mary's and Notre Dame and most of them swam 100 laps of the Rockne pool. Eighty percent of the contributions were from students. 


ERRATUM 
Students planning to leave their cars on campus during break should park them in lot D-1, not D-2 as reported in yesterday's Observer. 

FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley said Carter ordered the bureau to investigate "all violations of fede­ral law involved in the terrorist­type activities being perpetrated in the Washington, D.C., area."

by Maureen Sa,Jbel Staff Reporter 

The .St. Mary's Academic Coun­ci1 met last night to discuss a project for improving teaching methods, elections of student rep­resentatives within departments and academic policies with regard to cheating, plagiarism and student honesty. 
Sister Maria c. McDermott, professor of education, introduced a program called the "project for institutional renewal through im­proved teaching (PIRIT)." This program, funded by Lily Pharma­cutical company, is active in 16 colleges in the United States and abroad. It studies students' learning styles and then gives this informa­tion to the faculty so they may assess their teaching styles. 
McDermott said that the pre­dominant style used is lecturing, note-taking, and writing papers for teaching purposes. She stated that 
other learning and teaching styles letters sent to members of each what students feel to be the extend exist that are both beneficial and major to obtain nominations, send-of the problem and the possilbe challenging. ing out ballots, or having specified solutions.

A challenge by the Armco Steel Corporation to form an industrial design project under the theme of "firefighting" is being tackled by a group of Notre Dame students, as a program of the Art Department. 
"We had to learn what fire-fight­ing was, first," explained Freder­ick Beckman, art department pro­fessor and faculty leader of the project. "This involved in-depth research, which started in Septem­ber. The object of industrial design is to approach the problem, define it, and focus on areas that are in need. We focused on 'combat gear', and the problem of disasters in high-rises," he said. 
Some combat gear is "ancient", according to Beckman with the helmet and face-mask ill-designed to fit with each other. The Art Department project focused on this problem, as well as the designing of turnout coats and trousers of material which can withstand very hot temperatures. 
A plan for designating critical floors in high-rises, and sites where fire-fighting equipment is instal­led, was also devised. 
One problem with the common fire-fighting cabinets in buildings, according to Beckman, is that they are simply "first-aid kits for fire," and can be easily ripped off. 
The members of the project suggest a large cabinet which would also contain fresh-air tanks and professional hoses. They also designed vehicles for fightin~ fire on water and for use in large malls. 
Beckman and 14 students will 
present their project-its concepts 
and models--to a group of under­
writers and fire investigators in 
Dallas, Texas, on March 28, along 
with other colleges who are partici­
pating in the project. 
According to Beckman, Armco, who sponsors all aspects of the yearly progrjm ~n tiptely, vital 

topics, seems to be enthused about the student fire-fighting sugges­tions. Lab tests of concepts would be given only by them. 
Why is a project in Industrial Design directed to the Art Depart­ment? "You need a creative aspect," says Beckman, "in addi­tion to thethoJ.!ght process~ This project fit in well with the class it was presented to. Enthusiasm for it !s very high, and we may have sptn-offs on something similar after the project.is over."

Student Advisory Council to host academic affairs conference 
by Michael Lewis 

The Notre Dame Arts and Leters Student Advisory Council (ALSAC), assisted by the College of Arts and Letters, will sponsor the second annual Midwest Con­ference on Academic Affairs, ac­cording to conference chairman Scott Medlock. 
Starting Oct. 14, the conference will be attended by approximately 25 universities and colleges. Schools of all sizes will be invited, including all of the Big Ten 
universities, Washington Univer­
Reserve and St. Mary's. "The conference will serve two main goals,'' Madlock statet;l. "First of all it will give students a chance to share ideas and experi­ences concerning the improvement of the respective schools. Se­condly, it is an opportunity to develop better lines of communica­tion between the student body, faculty and administration here at Notre Dame," he outlined. Conference activities include dis cussions, seminars and presenta-

The annual 'Mock Stock Market, sponsored by the Notre Dame Finance Club, will open on Monday, March 21 at 10 a.m. in the lobby of the old business adminis­tration building. 
Between 10 a.m. and 3· p.m. Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­dents can open a single $10,000 account for one dollar or three $10,000 accounts for two dollars at the Mock Stock Market booth on any trading day. 
The investor with the largest dollar increase over the trading period, ending April 21, will win $100. Second place is worth $50, and third place $25. The first pirze has been donated by Thomson, McKinnon Securities, Inc., a South Bend brokerage firm. 
Traders at the booth will be provided the latest prices of New York and American Exchange stocks by constant communication between the booth and a telequote machine. Selling short and buying long will be permitted, and a mock brokerage commission will be charged for all purchases. 
Throughout the mock market participants will know how they stand in relation to others by means of posted information at the booth, Observer articles arid WSND broadcasts. 
Co-Chairman Dan Bishop and Robert Fauria see the Mock Mar­ket as a learning experience and a challenge to the gambling instinct. They note that students can learn something about the stock_ market through first hand experience with­out extreme financial risk.

Gassman: 
'A' for Effort 
Nearly one year ago, Mike Gassman took office as student body president after winning the election by a wide margin on the first ballot. He brought with him considerable experience as the Academic Commisioner who finally got the Academic Council to adopt a calendar students favored. like all new student body presidents he entered office with high hopes and a long list of campaign promises.

boards. At the beginning of the year most 
halls did not even have functioning 
J-boards. Now, in large part because of the Gassman regime's work, all halls have boards. But the SBP cannot make students use the boards, he can only try to insure that boards are available. Most students continue to prefer going to the rector to 
deal with disciplinary problems. And, despite public statements to the contrary, some rectors still seem reluctant to let the j-boards do much. This reluctance will have to be left to the next regime to deal

Student government's continued efforts to get the Indiana legislature to lower the drinking age were of course less success­ful, but not for lack of effort. Jerry
Klingenberger and his staff put in long hours on the lobbying effort but opposition from conservative legislators and voters 
continued to be too strong. The drinking· bill is a long-tenn effort which will have to be canied on by the Bender regime. 
Hopes of improving the services of, and links between, Student Government and Student Union ran aground because of a feud between the two organizations over the independence of the Student Union director. Relations between Gassman and 
S. U. director Ken Ricci were strained all

Gassman hoped to improve student-faculty relations. The approach to the faculty came mainly in the Academic Council and continued Gassman's own efforts during the calendar fight. Though 
the Academic Council was not as active as in past years, closer relations there may ~ay off in the future. 
Improving contact with the Board of

mg Notre Dame lacks the money. That rejection killed the idea for the near future. Gassman's people have gone looking for outside backers and claim to have four prospects but don't expect anything defin­ite soon. 
The Gassman regime continued work on the perennial issue of LaFortune renova­tion. It has just presented extensive new plans for renovation to the Administration, plans backed by a survey of student 
desires. But LaFortune renovation, like cablevision, must be paid for by the University or by wealthy outside benefac­tors. The SBP proposes but the Admini­stration disposes. 
Two other issues arose in the course of the year: the great case of Pigs vs. Price and the laundry proposal. After the usual prolonged discussions both were resolved successfully: the pigs got their garbage and the students will get their washing machines. Overall, then, how successful has Gass­man been? True, he failed to achieve some of his major goals--a lowere drinking age, cablevision, better links between student government and Student Union. True, he

The Student Life Council has come in for heavy criticism this year and justifiably so. One mem­ber, asked at the end of last semester what it had done so far, replied, "We haven't done sh--." That record has not been improved this semester. Clearly something needs to be done to revive the SLC but proposals to junk the present model and start ove~ such as SBP-elect Dave Bender has mad; would only make things worse. 
The SLC has been declining in activity and influence for years but this year it has almost completely degenerated into a debating soci­ety. Members sit around discus­sing vast, vague issues like "sexu­ality at Notre Dame" and long­range "personal development." 
A year of this has produced no legislation although the Council was originally created as a legisla­tive group to deal with current University problems. In fact, the SLC's only products this year are some statistics on social space, a long-delayed survey of student opinions on coeducation which the Administration tossed in the circu­lar file, and a stack of committee reports which wiii end in the same piece. 
The interminable discussions and general futility have driven some of the faculty members away
and the students seem unable to 
deal with Bro. Just Paczesny's obstruction of real action. 
To get the Council moving again SBP-elect Dave Bender has pro­posed drastically restructuring it. He wishes to replace the current
membership with a group of rectors 
elected by the other rectors and an equal number of hall social com­missioners. The idea is that since student life takes place primarily in the halls, the Student Life Council should be made up of 
people intimately concerned with 
the halls. That way policy would supposedly be made by those who implement it. ·

placed With men who, whatever their personal opinions, would be appointees of the central admini­strators, directly answerable to Paczesny. Students would lose access to top administrators while still having to deal with their subordinates. 
Replacing specially elected stu­dent representatives with hall social commissioners is even more ridiculous. Social commissioners are chosen for their ability to organize parties, not to deal with the whole range of student issues. Further, Bender has completely forgotten the roughly 1400 people who live off-campus. They would be left with no representatives at all. 
Such drastic changes would have to be approved by the current SLC, which is unlikely, and then by the 
"Board of Trustees, which is even more unlikely. Administrators like the current arrangement--it looks nice but does nothing--and the Board will not overrule them. 
Even if the Board did like the idea it operates so slowly that the change would take a whole year to put through. Then would come the actual re-organization. During all this time the SLC would be doing nothing. It is about time a new SBP sticks with the structures he inher­its and concentrates on making them work instead of spending the whole year reorganizing. 
The basic flaw in Bender's plan is that he thinks the SLC's problem is structural. This is wrong: with the same tripartite structure the SLC was dynamic when it was created in the late sixties. It was the Council, for instance that won Board approval of the first visita­tion hours. 
That potential is still there but the Council needs active student support (as it had in the sixties) to do its job. Since most students get excited only about issues that effect them immediately such as the draft or the calendar, the Council will have to work on these issues. Even the most concerned 'student will quickly weary of endless debates on "sexuality" and "develop­ment.'' 
. Finally, the SLC needs dynamic student members capable of rous­ing working students, with facutly and standing up to administrators. 
The SBP and SBVP -should take the lead in this revival. 
Even if the SLC cannot be revived next year, it should at I~ast be kept going to serve again when the students want to use a legisla­tive body with direct access to the

WASHINGTON--The "human rights" issue in the Soviet Union has the Kremlin terribly upset. The question is why? I posed this problem to my good friend Gregor, a minor functionary at the Soviet Embassy with high KGB connec­tions. 
"Gregor," I said, "why on earth 
are you people so excited about a 
few malcontents in your country? 
Surely you, as the first or second 
most powerful nation in the world, 
can stand a little criticism from a 
few dissidents who march to a 
different drummer.'' 
"Is personal matter and none of 
your business!" Gregor said sour­
ly. 
"I'm not chiding you, Gregor, 
for your stand," I said. "I'm just 
curious why the full power of the 
state has come dowh with such 
force on a handful of men? Is the 
Communist system so fragile that it 
can't allow one or two people to 
complain about the political condi­
tion in your country?" 
Gregor scowled. "Do you want 
detente or don't you want de­
tente?" 
"Of course, I want detente." 
''Then stop asking me such 
stupid questions." 
"Gregor, that's no way to talk to 
a friend who gave you an entire set 
of blueprints for the EdseL I'm 
trying to understand what makes 
your leaders tick. Why do you keep 
arresting people for speaking out 
for a little more freedom?" 
''There is no such thing as a little 
freedom," Gregor said. "There is 
either freedom or no freedom. 
America wants to destroy us with 
freedom." 
"We do not," I protested. "We 
like you just the way you are. But 
frankly, you're very boring people. 
You keep saying the same thing 
over and over again. It's nice to 
hear a fresh voice from Moscow 
every once in a while, even if he 
doesn't have a following." 
"How do you know he doesn't 
have a following?" 
"I just assumed it." I said. "I ploring if they were not sure of the confidentiality of their disclosures: ambivalent feelings toward par­ents, problem pregnancies, sexual· orientation and behavior, and vio­lations of law or college policy.

the Soviet press, that these people 
are nothing more than maniacs who 
belong in mental institutions. Do 
they really have many supporters 
in your country?" · "We don't know and we're not going to find out,'' Gregor said. 
''Gregor, you sound frightened. 
Do you really believe that a few 
writers and scientists would drive 
you into a free state?" 
"Not a free state--a Capitalist 
state. We don't want any part of 
Capitalism.'' 
"I don't blame you. It's a messy 
system. We have gas shortages, 
coffee at $3 a pound, and you can't 
even find a parking place when you 
want it. But surely Sakharov and 
Ginzburg, and a few others, don't 
have it in their power to make the 
Soviet Union a Capitalist country." 
"Maybe yes--maybe no. But that 
is for us to decide. Just because we 
buy your wheat does not give your 
President an excuse to write to one 
of our traitors." 
"President Carter didn't mean 
any harm. He answers all his mail. 
It's a habit he picked up when he 
was selling peanuts." 
Gregor hit his fist on the table. 
"Well, we. won't stand for it. How 
would you like it if Brezhnev wrote 
to one of your dissidents, Ronald 
Reagan?" 
"I wouldn't mind, but I don't 
think Reagan would like it. He 
might want to run for President in 
1980 and a letter from Brezhnev 
would kill his chances." 
"Why should Americans care 
what we do to our writers and 
scientists?" he shouted at me. 
"That's a good question. Gre­
gor. We shouldn't care but we do. I guess you could call it one of our weaknesses. We hate to see people anywhere locked up for their · thoughts. If you were a Fascist country many of us would feel the 
same way." 
Gregor stared at me. "This is 
your last warning. Stay out of our 
internal affairs, or else." 
I refused to blink. "Don't threat­

Carter to write Sakharov another

Digger Phelps: Another Round in the Playoffs 
Editors note: As Coach Digger Phelps heads Into another playoff season, he took dme out for this Interview with Features Editor Tim O'Relley. 
Observer: The story that was run alter the San Francisco game noted that you've prayed to Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. Does that Imply that you considered this season a lost cause at some point? 
Phelps: No, It wasn't so much a lost caus<,!_, it's that you're looking to get the most out what you have, and we had gone to mass in one of the chapels, and somebody left a paper. What happened was, I picked it up -this is back early in the season -and I and my secretary run off a few copies. There was a time right after the-nine days prior to the Holy Cross game, we really wanted to get the thing going, and from there, we went well, but lost at West Virginia. So I felt it was time to try it again, just to make sure that we did our best and that's all we're trying to do is get the most of ourselves. You know, every personality has it's own faults and weaknesses but there's certain weaknesses in me that would not make me ashamed to say, yeah, I pray to Saint Jude. And obviously we got an NCAA bid, so I ought to thank Saint Jude. 
Observer: Going Into the' season In October you lost your top-scoring super· star, Adrian Dandey What kind of concept did you have for this team? How did you 
think you could win? 
·Phelps: We just felt we have seven players coming back out ofthe ten that played last year, and a lot of these kids are underrated. When we're healthy, we are as good as anyone in the country. In that one spurt when we lost four games in a row, we lost Ray Martin, and we lose Bruce Flowers for three ofthose games, and it's just a situation where we had to make 
re~~m~. ~~~saili~~
where I think, to end up 21 and 6, it's just unbelievable. It's just been a fantastic year, and we're very happy about it, and here we are in for a fourth straight NCAA playoff. When everyone else thought this was a rebuilding year, we just said, "Hey, we're going to pick up where we left off." and obviously we have. So I think there's guys in this team that have done things to make a contribution that people didn't 
, expect they could do. . Observer: And you feel that the team came very close to playing to Its potendal? Phelps'; Yeah, I think we showed that Saturday, and Monday at Depaul I think the team really showed a lot of poise :and a lot of class. I think the attitude and the togetherness that's on this team has probably been our sixth man. ­Observer: Speaking of another sixth man, the crowd, do you think the team can 
 sustain its Inspired effort _during the USF game, though all the g~es wiD be oil the~road? -­Phelps: I think that's going to be a· part of it. I think we're going to have a lot of support in Philadelphia, and I th nk we're going to have a lot of support in 11. .aryland. As far as tickets go, it's a sham: we can't get more tickets. I'd have to ~ iY that of those who will be there, many w' .I be Notre Dame fans there. even now, thf re's a lot of students who have never travel'ed with us before going to Philadelphia. So every ticket that was availab~e mad_e t1 us _h~re, has been sold. So I thmk Philad ~lphia sa good Notre Dame town, so hopefully 

if you do it once in your lifetime it's really 
an outstanding accomplishment. So 
whenever it happens, I'll take it now and 
worry later about what's going to happen 
after that. 
Observer: You are known as one of the 
most colorful coaches on the sideline. How 
much of that Is you and how much of It Is a , 
calculated effort to try to control the tempo 
of the game? 
Phelps: I think both questions are heading 
in the same direction, and which seems to 
be I just have to be myself. I think that to 
go 27 games without a technical is a 
record. So obviously, I've grown in the 
areas of dealing with the officials and 
crowd control. 
My coaching style has to be what it is. 
And I can only be my own man. I just feel i very comfortable being that person. 
Observer: Many coaches will take a 
technical to get his team going, or employ 
other such tactics. Do y ou try to help the 
officiating with Uttle hints along the way? . 
Phelps: Well, I think everybody baits the 
officials, but you can only bait them to the 
point where you're not going to get hit with 
the technicals. You've got to know when to 
do it and when not to do it. I think this year 
was the year that I just learned when not to 
do it. I have a clean slate as far as technical 
fouls. Yeah, I think it's been a factor. 
Observer: In your coaching style, how 
much would you say Is teaching versus 
=======~===========================:::those rules while you're being recruited, 
Unfailing prayer to St. Jude. 
Say the following prayer 9 days in succession, leaving a copy in church each day. It has never failed to grant a request. 
May the Sacred Heart of Jesus be praised and glorified this ay probation period. So we're getting in that 
direction. And I think that's probably theand forever. St. Jude pray for US, hear my prayers, only.way we're ever going to end all illegal 
_, recruiting.and grant OUr petitions. Observer: Another aspect of NCAA

college programs. 
they're g~to be rootinll_~r us. _____ coaching, is, of course, recruiting. Are you 
-Ohserver: Coach John Wooden once advised you not to win the championship right away, but to keep them guessing. Have you ever made any attempt at foUowlng that advice? Phelps: Well, I'd love to win it once. 
Maybe then I'll quit. 
I can see the pressure though,. after you win it once. I can see what Indiana went through this year. I can see what John Wooden went through. And once you win your first one, everyone w;mts your second. Then they want your third. I think one of those that absolutely despises It, considers it an evll necessity? Phelps: Well obviously you have to rec~uit in order to be successful each year. I thmk the type of person we have in out program really just typifies the student-athlete that has to be really concerned about whether or not _he can get the job. done ~ere academically as well as athletically. It s a two-way street; we have certain rules ar,td regulations as far as making that commit.­ment, and I think that's healthy.. . . 

I just got back from a recrUitmg trtp yesterday. I get our during the season country today, that's obvious. about three or four times during the season I think that the rules and regulations because I want to make all the practices. themselves should be stiffer. I feel that if a Once the season's over, all we do is youngster in high school reads the rules of recruiting during the months of April and recruiting before he starts his senior year, May, until we've got at least 5 people his parents or his high school coach even, signed. then he should sign an affidavit that he's Observer: Do you do a lot of It personally? read the rules. That goes on file in Phelps: We only have three visits, Kansas City, and if you violate any of 
once you get to that school you lose all your 
eligibility to play, the school goes on probation for four years and· the college coach is actually fired. 
Now, we're getting in that direction, Michigan State is an example. Many football players were penalized, they couldn't play in games this year. One kid couldn't play the whole season. The coach d was fired, and they got a three-year 
coerslon, to get a player to get him to do something? Phelps: I think about 90 per cent of the time in our program is really mechanics of teaching and mechanics of getting the unit to be a real unit, the team effort, offensively and defensively, even though, only really is ten per cent of what you do with the team. Ninety per cent is mental and ten per cent of our time is really needed to produce that. The ten per cent of effort takes longer, and yet the ninety per cent, the mental part of it, sometines takes just five minutes. The daily practice, the preparation we'll have today,_ tomorrow and then one on Friday, that's the ten per cent we're talking about. The rest of it will be just getting them in that locker room, juicing them up, telling them what we're playing for, and why we're playing, and what we have to do to win. That's the mental part. Mental concentration, the emotional concentration, and the intensity about them to get it done. Observer: Do you have any particular tricks that you use for that ninety per cent or the mental part? Phelps: Again, just being myself. Observer: Play It by ear? Phelps; Yeah, it just happens. You know, I'll think about a couple things that you have to do, and just really grow on it for, you know, you give a forty-five minute speech the guys are asleep. You give them a two minute speech and that's it. Observer: Another big aspect of college personal c-ontacts with the youngster, andthe head coach will usually take those three off campus, He's allowed to visit you once, but your assistants can go see him play, go watch them practice and things like that. They keep interest shown in the youngster that we do want him here at Notre Dame. Observer: One Issue that came up at the last NCAA convention was the financial need clause. Phelps: That rule would be the biggest joke around. They wouldn't be able to police it because there would be a lot of cheating going on. 
When people have to fill out a Parents' Confidential Statement you have to process that ~tatement as well as legislate the rules regarding that statement, and it would really lead to a lot of turmoil. I think that a youngster has every right to be com pen-sated for his work just as a chemistry student gets his grant-in-aid, a fellowship, or academic scholarship. Why should an athlete be penalized because his talents are in athletics versus those that are in academics? And I think that's what need to be talked about. 
When they fill the arenas around the country and people pay to see them play, there's nothing wrong with compensating them for that because they are not allowed to work after school. or part time, or having a teacher fellowship working as a lab instructor or whatever you may be in your senior year. They should be compensated because they a're producing revenue for the 
university. They are human beings like anybody else, except there's a talent difference. Yet I think this new factor would iust lead to a lot of confusion and a lot('' violations. Observer: Doyou see anyplace where you would like to refo~ your recruiting system? Phelps: Yeah, I think there should be a budget limit on recruiting. Obviously as lot of schools out west are going to say, "Well, how am I going to get a kid back east?" But, there are many good schools in the Phelps: I think there's nothing wrong with 
that. That's just like competition, and 
that's what this country thrives on. 
It depends on the commitment you want 
to make as a university. I think we at Notre 
Dame make a commitment in both direc­
tions, academically and athletically. The.r 
only thing I disagree with is and I don't 
think a Division One school should have to 
play football and basketball. H they want 
to have eight varsity sports to be Division 
One, fine, of which you must have football 
or basketball. That's the only thing that I 
disagree with. If there's a power r 
conference of SO schools, and they have to 
play against each other, the small schools 
may say, well, it's not fair to us. Well, 
that's a commitment they must make. If 
you don't want to go bit time, you don't 
have to go big time. But why penalize 
those that want to be in that area? AthletiC 
competition is another way of bringing 
revenue into the university, today's prime 
need for university finances. A lot of the · 
other schools like MIT, they get their money in other ways. That's fine, but other institutions, if they are to survive, need athletics to contribute to the universi­ty, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's okay for MIT to go out and raise money in one area. But yet there's a school that ·would vote ag:;tinst anothet school if they want to do it for athletics. So they're inconsistent, and that's what is unfair 
about it. 
Observer: Do you think the big sports 
establishments, almost of professional 
proportions, are ruining an academic atmosphere at a university? Phelps: No, I don't think so. If anything else, I think it's under control, here. Right now, all our budgets are controlled by the university. Any money we get from bowls or basketball goes into the general fund. All our revenues generated end up in .a general fund. Just like development or any of the science programs, anything that's raised by the university goes in one pool. 
Believe me, desoite everything here,

LYONS ROOKIES WIN 1-H TITLE 
For the second year in a row, the basketball championship would belong to a Lyons Hall team. Unlike last year though, there were two teams from Lyons and both were in the Championship game. The Lyons Rookies [an all-freshman team] advanced to the finals. by defeating Farley while tfie Lyons Bionic Women defeated . previously unbeaten Badin Hall to reach the championship. The championship match was tight, full of good defense and up in the air till the last three minutes. A Betsy Flowers jump shot and two clutch free throws by Beth LaRocca offset a brillant effort by Sharon Sullivan to clinch a 20-18 win for the Rookies.

Adrian Dantley stands out in NBA 
What does former National Bas­ketball Association stars Willis Reed, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamber­lain, Jerry West and Bob Pettit have in common with such current superstars as Kareem Abdul­Jabbar, Wes Unseld and Earl Monroe? 
All were selected "Rookie of the Year" in their freshman NBA seasons. That's an imposing array of talent 
to say the least, and destined to join their ranks before long as the NBA's top rookie of 1976-77 is Buffalo's sensational first year performer, Adrian Dantoley. 
Though selected sixth in last spring's NBA draft, he is by far the cream of an immensely talented crop of NBA rookie standouts that includes among others, Richard Washington of Kansas City, Chica­go's Scott May, John Lucas of Houston, Phoenix's Ron Lee, and Quinn Buckner of Milwaukee. 
"If! were to vote tomorrow, he's be my choice," observed Coach Bill Fitch of Cleveland after watching the former Notre Dame All-Ameri­can score a game high 28 points and grab 11 rebounds in a Buffalo victory over the Cavaliers a few days ago. 
For Dantl~y, it was the type of game he .has come to expect gf _himself after SO NBA contests, and was reminiscent of his many awesome performances at Notre Dame, and even a few years earlier at famed Dematha High School in Hyattsville, Md. 
A 6-5, 210-pounder, the muscu­lar Washington, D.C., native Dantley admits strength and in­stinct have been major factors in his play this season. "Offensive rebounding is one of my better assets because I just seem to have a knack of getting to the ball and knowing when the shot is going to be taken. That way, I'm already in the lane in many cases." Dantley added, "My upper body strength is also better than some of the guys who guard me and that's a big factor, too." 
Dantley has led the Braves in 
offensive rebounding all season 
long and through games of Feb. 22 
had 181, an average of 3.35 per 
contest. Based on the latest NBA 
statistics which included games 
through Feb. 20, John Drew of 
Atlanta was the only other small 
forward in the league with more 
offensive rebounds. Significantly, 
such strong rebounders as Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and Bob Lanier had 
only 14 and 13 more offensive 
rebounds than Dantley heading 
into the current week And, Bill 
Walton, the league's. top rebound­
er, has fewer offensive rebounds

than Dantley. 
A quick glance at his statistics boggles the mind. The Braves rookie has scored 21 or more points 27 times in 54 games. That total also includes five games of 30 or more points. Topping this latter· category is a career high 39-points against Indiana last Mon­day night. 
A.D. has been on an amazing tear in the last four weeks. In a 
12-game  span,  he  has  led  the  
Braves  in  scoring  eight  times,  
scored  20  or  more  points  on  10  

occasions, and is averaging 24.7 points per game(296 total points) for the period. His play has had a direct effect on the Braves' latest resurgence. 
Overall, Dantley leads the Braves in scoring with a 19.2 average. He has the second best free throw percentage of .814 (Ernie DiGregorio, theleagueleader is ahead of him); is second in field goal percentage at .514 (he's 61 of 108 in the last seven games-.565); is second in rebounding (7.9 per game); leads in offensive rebound­ing with 181, and has averaged the third highest number of minutes played per game (35.5). 
Statistics are only a part of the · Dantley story this season. The enthusiasm and intensity with 

which he plays not only has made him a feared opponent and popular with the Buffalo fans, but continu­ally draws praise from opposing coaches. 
Some of their comments: 
"He's so strong and determined that it's difficult for most small forwards in this league to handle him. He's going to be a great one." -Coach Kevin Loughery after Dantly had scored a game high 30 points against his New York NetsJan. 1. 
"Dantley was exciting. I wanted to go out there and play him myself. We had five different guys on him tonight.'' -Coach Dick Motta of the Washington Bullets, after Dantley's 29 point showing Dec. 17. 
''Adrian Dantley is a great player. He is very physical under the boards and is probably the Braves' best offensive rebounder.'' -Coach Phil Johnson of the Kansas City Kings, after a 19 points, 14 rebounds performance, Dec. 29. 
And, Jerry West, coach of the Los Angeles Lakers has this com­ment: "I don't understand why he wasn't the number one pick in the draft.''

Irish icers capture Game One, 5-1 
mine from home,'' laughed Nugent after the game, "This summer, he bet me five dollars I wouldn't score on him." Needless to say, a very gratifying goal for Kevin Nugent. 
For the rest of the period, the Irish pressure continued, save for Eric Strobel's one-on-one rush on net, which Don Jackson took care of by riding him into the boards . 
.A delayed penalty sitUation set up what looked to be the Irish first goal of the second period. After hard slap-shots by Paul Clarke and Clark Hamilton just missed net, Dukie Walsh set up the puck in back of the net for another threat. Finally, Kevin Nugent simply lof­ted the puck toward the net at a seemingly impossible angle, and after the officials whistle had blown, evidently, the puck found its way behind Janaszak. 
Donny~-;' Wizard" Fairholm scored the Irish third goal all by himself, intercepting an intended clearing pass, reversing his tracks, and firing the puck to Janaszak's stick side. 
Clark Hamilton joined the scor­ing spree next, when he directed a Paul Clark slap sho.t by bedazzled net minder Janaszak. Then, finally, the puck saw its way to the other end of the ice for awhile, and John Peterson was again tested with Minnesota on the power play. 
Peterson first stopped a hard slap shot off the stick of defense­man Jim Boo. Later on in the same attack, Phil Verachotta tried to slap it past the log jam that had developed in front of Peterson. 
A steal by Allen Karsnia and some nifty puck ragging by Donny Fairholm ended that penalty situa­tion, but the Gophers struck shortly after for the only goal of the game. 
Defenseman Joe Baker hit a soft slap shot toward Peterson which Joe Michaletti redirected into the strings. With the score 4-1 and the ice broken, Minnesota started up with a little more pressure. Ken Yackel was set up perfectly by Steve Christoff but couldn't capital­ize. Rob McClanahan raced in on goal and was foiled by Peterson, then Michaletti lofted a soft but tricky slap ·shot that Peterson handled, and the threat was over. 
Before the period had ended , Ted Weltzin had proved that when things are going well, everything turns out a winner. With about two minutes left in the period, Roger Bourque followed a face off, cen­tered it quickly to Weltzin, who unloaded a hard lightning-fast, backhand that went between Jana­szek's legs. 
''I think my parents brought me luck," laughed Weltzin, who claims his parents have been in the stands for three of his six goals. 
The third period produced little but penalties, as John Peterson coasted with a six save finale. 
"I don't think we have to worry about not playing with the same intensity tomorrow,'' commented Coach Lefty Smith, "I think that the boys realize that a bad game tomorrow means the end of the season.'' 
Even if Irish fans won't show up, one old face from the past will haunt the ACC tomorrow. Tim Ryan, Notre Dame graudate and broadcaster for NBC television will bring Grand Stand to tomorrow's game. Welcome back, Mr. Ryan. You may just be seeing Notre Dame's best hockey team ever.

It would have been a good night for Irish hockey fans to regain confidence in their team. Unfor­tunately, there were few fans there to witness one of the Irish's most convincing victories, a 5-1 rout of the Minnesota Golden Gophers. It was, in the least, an auspicious playoff for the pucksters, who are now four goals up in the total goals series. 
"It was the best hockey we've played, probably since the Michi­gan series," commented a jovial Coach Lefty Smith, "All three of our lines played outstanding hock­ey tonight." 

As has been the case all year long, much of the. outstanding play came from the freshmen on the team. Tonight was no exception, as winger Ted Weltzin opened and closed the night's scoring with his fifth and sixth goals this year. The goals were particularly gratifying from Weltzin's view, being a native of St. Paul. 
The Irish started off melting the ice, and continued on throughout the game, keeping the action penned up in the Minnesota zone. John Peterson was the lonliest guy in town, stopping only 16 shots all night. Meanwhile, at the other end, it was a nightmare for Gopher goalie Steve J anaszak , who was forced to handle 58 Irish drives. 
Janaszak was tested from the outset of the game, when Allen Karsnia slapped a Dukie Walsh rebound at Janaszak who made the kick save, the first in what would be a long night for the entire Gopher defense. 
With Terry Fairholm off for tripping, the Gophers had their best scoring opportunity of the period when Gopher Phil Verachota snapped a quick shot off the face-off that might have taken Peterson by surprise. After that, the Irish penalty killing squad, which played a stellar game, controlled play. Geoff Collier and Jack Brownschidle contributed to the effort by blocking slap shots. 
Minutes later, the action was again in familiar territory. Terry Fairborn, centering the puck from behind the Gopher's goal, flipped a pass through the middle that Don Jackson boomed towards the net. Ted Weltzin, clogging up the middle, redirected the puck into the net for the Irish's first mark. Minutes later, Clark Hamilton and Ke,·in Nugent broke into the zon~ ~. on 1, and after Hamilton fed him a pict.ure-perfect pass, "the Stork" put it into the lower right hand corner, and became five dollars richer in the process. 
"Janaszak is a good .friend of

Irish reach goal; on to NCAA tourney 
Hofstra enters the playoffs with a 23-6 mark, having won the first ever East C,oast Conference championship. Hofstra has won their last nine contests in a row, and 13 of their last 14. 
They boast the nation's individ­ual rebounding leader in 6-9 center John Irving. Irving is currently pulling down 16.4 caroms a tilt and scores at a 14.2 clip. 
But for scoring, Hofstra turns to Rick Laurel, the nation's fifth leading scorer. Laurel, a 6-7 for­ward, scores 30.1 points per game. Besides being a high scorer, he is also a very consistent scorer. laurel has only scored more than 40 points twice this season and has only scored fewe~ than 20 once. He also adds 7.7 rebounds a game. 
Pat Kammerer, 6-8, starts at the 
other forward. Kammerer averages 
8.6 points a battle and 6.2 re­bounds. 
All of Hofstra's forecourt shoots 
better than 50% from the field. 
Kammerer hits 54.8% of his at­
tempts, Laurel 54.2% of his and 
Irving connects on 51.4%. 
· Ken Rood starts at one of the 
backcourt positions. Rood averages 
markers per contest. 
Willie Vickers rounds out the starting lineup for Hofstra at the other guard. While only averaging 
4.9 points a game, he has dished out 105 assists on the season. 
Guard Arnold Coleman and for­
ward Mark Jenkins are the top 
reserves for Hofstra. Of their top 
seven players, all are seniors 
except Jenkins. 
This is the second straight NCAA 
tournament appearance for Hof­
stra. Last year they lost to Conn­
ecticut in the first round 80-78 in 
overtime. 
They defeated Lehigh, Temple 
and LaSalle in the ECC tourney 
after finishing in a tie for first 
during the regular season. They 
were 7-1 in league play for the 
season, including playoff action. 
"We don't know an awful lot 
about Hofstra, but they're in the 
tournament so they mustbea good 
team," Phelps said. "One thing's 
for sure, we can't afford to take 
them lightly." 
Phelps will counter Hofstra with the same starting five that has played most of the season. Duck Williams and Rich Branning will be at the guards, Bruce Flowers at center and Toby Knight and Dave Batton will man the forward spots. Batton, who missed Monday's game with DePaul due an injured thigh, is expected to be at full speed for the encounter. 
Hofstra and Notre Dame have four common opponents. Hofstra lost to both Manhattan and Ver­mont by a point, while the Irish beat the Jaspers by four and the Catamounts by 41.Both teams lost to Villanova by a score of 64-62. Hofstra beat LaSalle twice, once by four and once by 11, while Notre Dame beat the Explorers by 39. 
The winner of the game will meet the winner of the North Carolina ­Purdue game, also to be played Saturday, on Thursday night at College Park, Md. 
The Hofstra -Notre Dame game will follow the Kentucky -Princeton contest. Tip-off for the Irish game is set for8:30 p.m.
