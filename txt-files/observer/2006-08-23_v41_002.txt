Temporary cell phone towers stand behind South Dining Hall and at other locations around campus to give students better reception. 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
The University's initiative to improve cellular tele­phone service on campus hit a roadblock this summer, delaying the project's com­pletion date and forcing cell phone users to rely on tem­porary mobile transmitters for service. 
The cellular antenna sys­tem project was supposed to be completed by the start of the school year, but that was before officials learned they had to get state approval to add antennas to older buildings on campus, said Dewitt Latimer, chief technology officer in the Office of Information Technologies. 


Delays plague cell service improvements 
"Any modification to a building [more than 45 years old] done by a cell phone carrier ... must go through an approval process with the state historical preservation office," Latimer said, recalling the information his office learned after they finalized the locations for the anten­nas. "It caught us all off­guard." 
Latimer said all antenna sites but one have now been approved and work on them has resumed. But the approval process set the antenna project back about six weeks, Latimer said. 
The University announced last spring that it had entered into agreements

ND evacuees return from Lebanon 
Professor helps family escape conflict, student makes own way home 
By MADDIE HANNA 
News Writer 

When Israel bombed Lebanon on July 12, Ramzi Bualuan's week of hell began. 
His wife and children were near Beirut when the conflict broke thousands of miles from where he was, in South Bend. 
"Unbelievable," the computer science and engineering profes­sor said last Wednesday, shak­ing his head slightly. "Oh, my God. Awful." 
Bualuan, paralyzed by help­lessness, watched the crisis unfold on his TV screen. 
But junior Joe Janke was in the thick of the chaos, cool and unconcerned. 
"I didn't think it was serious at all," Janke said Sunday. He had spent three and a half

University cuts dorm telephones 
Students have option to purchase room line 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
Assistant News Editor 

Notre Dame students return­ing to the dorms this semester will be greeted by technology improvements, including cable jacks and solid cell phone recep­tion. There is one Old Faithful, however, that is absent -the blinking red light of the room phone. 
Beginning after spring resi­dents moved out in May, the telephones located in every dorm room were systematically removed from the halls and many sold in the end-of-the­year charity "yard sale" in the stadium, "From Old to Gold." 
This move came after the Office of Information Technologies (OIT) found that only a very small percentage of on-campus students regularly used their room phones, accord­ing to Steven Ellis, the director of Integrated Communications Services at OIT. 
"We'd found that roughly 80 to 90 per cent of the telephones were not used in the dorms," Ellis said. "With a large number like that, it's an obvious [deci­sion]: If they're not using the phones, then why are we put­ting them out there?" 
Students will now rely on their personal cell phones, most of which are expected to have improved reception after the addition of 16 service antennae across campus is completed.

Football ticket lottery proceeds smoothly 
By MAUREEN MULLEN 
News Writer 
Over the course of two hours yesterday morning, an estimat­ed 2,200 Notre Dame seniors waited outside the Notre Dame Stadium box office to purchase their season student football ticket booklet -with members of the junior class eagerly wait­ing to follow. 
Tuesday was the first day of this year's student ticket distri­bution. The process ran "very smoothly" according to Joshua Berlo, Director of Ticket Operations for the University. 
Berlo said Notre Dame's pres­ent ticket distribution proce­dure resulted from collabora­tion between the Student Activities Office and the Athletic Department. 
Though the current process has been in place for the past several years, Berlo said this is the first year two classes of stu­dents will receive tickets on a single day. Between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. yesterday, the senior class received their tickets, and juniors had their chance start­ing at 1 p.m. 
The ticket distribution process is organized by a lottery system in which most students are familiar. On Monday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., stu­

earned cash. 
You've proba­bly been given advice about get­ting to bed at a decent hour, going to class, getting to know your roommate and when and where to study. But one thing that no one ever told me when I was a fresh­man was how to save a few bucks. 
Well, you won't have to suffer through that. I am feeling very generous today. 
There is a large building called the Notre Dame Hammes Bookstore. You will probably hear your friends describe how that place is wiping them out. Don't be a fellow victim. 
The one useful thing student government has ever done throughout its history is to require the Bookstore to post its books online. Take advantage of this. 
There are plenty of Web sites on which you can buy books. Ebay, Half.com, Froogle and MySimon are a few of the great places to go. 
The bookstore will post signs to scare you away from doing this, claiming that you will buy the wrong books or that you be the victim of outright fraud. 
But being that you probably have an SAT score above 1350, I'm sure you are competent enough to spend just a little time to check that you are buying the right book from a reputable source. 
And of course, there is NDSP. In September, NDSP has a bike auc­tion in which they auction off bikes that people had a good reason for abandoning on campus. 
Expect decrepit bikes to go for a value equal to their original sale price, and expect bikes that are actually in good shape to be quick­ly snatched by local bike sellers who do this for a living. 
If you do find a cheap bike, keep in mind that you could likely pay for it in the end with your medical bills due to its poor condition. 
It could even be a big conspiracy. You buy the bike and severely injure yourself. Then NDSP offi­cers keep their jobs by giving you a MEDEVAC. 
Nevertheless, a bike can be a very useful thing on campus, and you will never accumulate parking tickets when using one. Some stu­dents buy $40 dollar kids bikes at Wal-Mart and look silly. 
But if you are looking for some­thing better, you could also go to a local cycle shop to get a good one or even buy one online along with your books. 
Just stay away from Stepan Dome on that day. You are paying over $40,000 to go to ND. You need not pay more.

Repairs tnade to SMC w-ater-dalllaged dorlll 

By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
Repairs were made over the sum­mer to the damaged floors and ceil­ings in Holy Cross Hall that came after scorching summertime tem­peratures caused the sprinkler sys­tem to malfunction at approximately 9 p.m. on Sunday, July 16. 
College spokeswoman Melanie McDonald said the sprinklers went off in the attic of the residence hall when temperatures reached 150 degrees -the point at which the system was set to disengage. 
The intense rush of water burst through the attic and leaked all the way to the basement on the build­ing's south end, causing major struc­tural damage in the hallways of the third and forth floors. McDonald said the water did not structurally damage any dorm rooms. 
The Notre Dame Fire Department quickly arrived on the scene and no one was injured during the incident, McDonald said. 
Approximately 130 Fine Arts Camp and Summer Academy campers and counselors and student summer residents were living in the building at the time, and were forced to relocate to LeMans Hall for the duration of their time at the College. 
McDonald said repairs were made to the building and it is now deemed structurally sound. The only visual impact of the incident is the tile used to replace the usually carpeted hall­ways. The carpet was removed to avoid the growth of mold and will hopefully be replaced during fall break, McDonald said. 
The College has added additional ventilation to the attic and set the new triggering temperature to 200 degrees to avoid a reoccurrence of this incident, McDonald said.

South Bend tour dra-ws freshmen 
By KAITLYNN RIELY News Writer 
While most Notre Dame students spent Monday after­noon settling into their rooms and preparing for the start of the academic year, over 100 freshmen boarded Transpo buses for the first­ever "Explore South Bend Tour." 
Freshman Jarrod Castro­Mendoza said the tour, which focused mainly on the down­town area, gave him a better impression of South Bend than he had coming into col­lege. 
"When I came here in the spring... all I saw was the really bad parts of town when I was leaving the city," Castro-Mendoza said. "[The tour] made it much more positive." 
Now that he is aware of entertainment options avail­able in the city, he said he may return with friends to some of the restaurants and museums he spotted. 
The Senate Community Relations committee (CRC), Mayor Steven Luecke's office and the city of South Bend sponsored the tour with the common objective to wel­come the new freshmen class to the community and to give them information about things to do beyond campus limits. 
Mikki Dobski, director of communications and special projects for the mayor's office, said she has received 
positive feedback regarding the tour's inaugural run. 
"Everybody seemed to have a good time and good questions," Dobski said. 
It was an excellent oppor­tunity for the mayor's office to reach out to Notre Dame students, she said. 
"I think we were showing students the kind of places that they were looking for, in terms of restaurants, food, and entertainment," Dobski said. 
Freshman Amy Kruger signed up for the tour to see the city she would be living in for the next four years. Kruger said she was impressed by South Bend, but was hesitant to recom­mend the tour to freshmen next year due to the lengthy amounts of time spent on the buses. Kruger recommend­ed event organizers make the tour more interactive in the future. 
CRC chairman Josh Pasquesi estimated 160 peo­ple showed up for the approximately two-hour tour. 
"I think that overall it went great," Pasquesi said. "We are happy with the numbers and we are definitely going to keep doing it next year." 
At the conclusion of the tour, the freshmen enjoyed local pizza and were treated to free fondue from the South Bend Chocolate Cafe. Luecke and student body president Lizzi Shappell wel­comed the freshmen and encouraged them to take 
advantage of what South Bend has to offer. 
"My message [to the fresh­men] was just to engage themselves in the South Bend community, because it is easy to become comfort­able living in the Notre Dame bubble," Shappell said. 
Luecke gave a brief history of the city and discussed how South Bend and Notre Dame can be partners. He invited students to contact his office to get more information about how they can get involved in the community. 
Both the mayor's office and the CRC are enthusiastic about making the "Explore South Bend Tour" an annual event. Dobski hopes to meet with the student government at some point in the coming school year to assess the success of the event and dis­cuss ways to improve the tour for next year. 
Dobski said she wants to keep the tour length to a reasonable time, but also thinks future tours should include a stop at local attrac­tions like the Farmer's Market, and should take stu­dents through more neigh­borhoods. Dobski also sug­gested expanding the initia­tive to give separate tours to new graduate students and parents. 
"What we want to do is sort of open the gates to what's available beyond campus," she said.

Fair provides off­campus advising 
By LAURA BODIEN News Writer 
Notre Dame's second annual off-campus fair, Monday, drew off-campus students searching for foot­ball tickets, free food and advice on living outside the University bubble. 
Former student body pres­ident Dave Barron and cur­rent student body president Lizzi Shappell jump-started the program last year in response to concerns voiced by the Board of Trustees report of an off-campus Security. 
"We were looking at a way to get information out from NDSP (Notre Dame Security/Police) and the South Bend Police," off-cam­pus senior Josh Paquesi said. 
Pasquesi has organized the fair for two years run­ning and estimates this year's turn out to be near 100 percent of eligible stu­dents. 
"We had more vendors this year and therefore more free stuff which is always good," he also noted. 
"It was great," off-campus senior Kristin Schwarz said. 
"The information on meal plans was extremely help­ful." 
In addition to a presenta­tion on meal plans, tables by NDSP, the South Bend Police, Sex Offence Services and the Office of Drug and Alcohol Education were set up to raise student aware­ness of security in the com­munity. Among other things, students were informed on how to be responsible neigh­bors. 
Students were drawn to the popular booths run by Jimmy Johns and Papa Johns, but everyone flocked to the tables handing out football ticket applications. 
"Everyone loves a mini­Jimmy John, but I think peo­ple were most zoned in on the football," Schwartz said. 
While the students waited, businesses promoted their wares to new potential cus­tomers. 
"We wanted to inform stu­dents about convenient loca­tions for nearby necessi­ties," Pasquesi said. 
Meijer, Target, Fun Tan, Salon Rouge and Dominoes were among those present.

Iran ready to talk about nukes 
State run media says the nation is unwilling to budge on uranium enrichment 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN, Iran -Iran said Tuesday it was ready for "serious negotiations" on its nuclear program, offering a new formula to resolve a crisis with the West. A semi­official news agency said the government was unwilling to abandon uranium enrich­ment -the key U.S. demand. 
Iran delivered its written response to a package of incentives offered by the United States and five other world powers to persuade Iran to roll back on its nuclear program -and punishments if it does not. The world powers, the five permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany, have given Iran until Aug. 31 to accept the package. 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, said Washington will "study the Iranian response carefully" but was prepared to move forward with sanc­tions against Tehran if it was not positive. The White House held off commenting until it had studied the text. The European Union's for­eign policy chief, Javier Solana, said the document was "extensive" and required "a detailed and careful analysis." 
Iranian officials alTered no details of the response, but it appeared geared at entic­ing those countries into fur­ther negotiations by offering a broad set of proposals vague enough to hold out hope of progress in resolv­ing the standoff. 
If the Iranians leave the door open to halting enrich­ment as talks progress, that would drive a wedge in the Security Council between the Americans, British and French on one side and the Hussians and Chinese on the other. Last month, Hussia said the Council was in no rush to pressure Iran, strik­ing a more conciliatory tone than the United States. 
Tuesday's announcement was the latest development in the yearlong standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. Iran says it wants to master the technology to generate nuclear power. But critics say Iran is interested in ura­nium enrichment because it can also be used to make the fissile core of nuclear weapons. 

The current drama is playing out in the wake of fpars that thfl ability of tho pro-Iranian I-lezbollah guer­rillas in Lebanon to with­stand 34 days of Israeli bombardment has embold­ened hard-liners in Tehran to risk a showdown with tho Americans, who are bogged down in neighboring Iraq. There has also been specu­lation in the West that Iran encouraged Hezbollah to provoke the Israelis to dis­tract attention from its nudear ambitions. 
Iran has pursued a con­frontational stance on the nuclear issue since the elec­tion of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last year. The hard-line president has used the nuclear issue to encour­age a sense of national pride among Iranians by standing up to the United States and other Western countries. 
On Tuesday, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, hand-delivered his government's response to ambassadors of Britain, China. Russia, France, Germany and Switzerland -which represents U.S. interests -nine days before a Security Council deadline for Iran to halt uranium enrichment or face econom­ic and political sanctions. 
Larijani refused to dis­close whether the response included an offer to suspend uranium enrichment. But the semiofficial Fars news agency reported that Iran rejected calls to suspend "nuclear activities" -or uranium enrichment -and "instead has offered a new formula to resolve the issues through dialogue." 
The state-run television quoted LarUani as telling the diplomats Iran "is prepared as of Aug. 23rd (Wednesday) to enter serious negotia­tions" with the countries that proposed the incentives package. 
The Irna official news agency reported that "Larijani said Iran's answer has logically, fairly and con­structively addressed demands of the proposed package, recommending the P5+1 group to return to the negotiation table immedi­ately despite the false atmosphere created against Iran that it was buying time." 

VIRGINIA 

Virginia Tech suspect arraigned 
Associated Press 
CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. -A jail inmate who was the object of a man­hunt that enveloped the Virginia Tech campus following the slayings of a deputy sheriff and a hospital security guard was arraigned Tuesday on capital murder and other charges. 
William Morva, 24, was held with­out bond and was arraigned from jail via video conference for security rea­sons, Montgomery County Sheriff's Lt. Gary Chandler said. 
Morva was recaptured without incident Monday afternoon in a thick briar patch near campus and not far from where a county sheriff's deputy was shot and killed earlier in the day. 
The deputy, Cpl. Eric E. Sutphin, was among officers searching for Morva, who had escaped from a hos­pital Sunday morning. Hospital secu­rity guard Derrick McFarland was slain and a sheriff's deputy was injured during the escape. 
Morva was arraigned on charges of capital murder, assault on a police officer, escape and use of a firearm in a felony. Charges in Sutphin's slaying will be filed later, Blacksburg Police Lt. Joe Davis said. 

Marva's brother, Michael Morva, 26, was charged with aiding in his brother's escape, according to Cpl. Kris Weaver. He also was charged with marijuana possession. 
Sutphin's colleagues and members of the community paid their respects to the fallen officer Tuesday by lay­ing bouquets of flowers, cards and notes on his cruiser, which was parked outside the jail.

dents visited gate B of the stadi­um and received their lottery number. 
Berlo said an estimated total of 10,000 students -including graduate students and students from Saint Mary's College ­picked up lottery numbers. Later that evening, during halftime of the men's soccer game, two magic lottery numbers were drawn -one for undergradu­ates, and another for graduate students. The undergraduate number was 26 and the graduate number was 337. 
Tickets were sold Tuesday first to those who held lottery num­bers closest to the magic number that had been drawn the evening before. Berlo said the system was created to efficiently serve stu­dents without the chaos of a "first come first serve" format. 
Cappy Gagnon, coordinator of stadium personnel, said Tuesday morning went so well because of student and staff familiarity with the process. 
"Because we've been doing this the same way for some time now, students are in the groove," Gagnon said. "Students partici­pate in the process more intelli­gently each year." 
Gagnon said while he was overseeing the ticket distribution during the morning, he spoke with several seniors who asked

why the university did not move towards a computerized distribu­tion system. 
"The answer to that is that the ticket office has created a process that works with student input," he explained. "For a change like that we would not go forward with out student input, and most students like the process as it is." 
Most students from the junior class in line Tuesday afternoon seemed to agree with Gagnon. 
Knott Hall resident Jacques Nguyen reached the front of the line at around 1:45pm with lot­tery number 1162, after waiting only 10 minutes. 
"Things seem to be going pretty smoothly," Nguyen said. "Ushers

To keep up a standard form of connection in lieu of the dorm phone disappearance, every stu­dent, regardless if they are living on or off campus, has been given a five-digit voice mail box num­ber that can be accessed from any phone: The number previ­ously used to call up voice mail -familiar to many students as 4-7474-will still be employed to either check voice mail or leave a message in another voice mail box. A student will keep the same number throughout their tenure at the University. 
"The [voice mail] service is free of charge, so if students decide they want to use it, it's there," Ellis said. "However, the University will be using [the voice mail boxes] as a method of communicating with students, so they really need to set up their mail boxes." 
With the transition out of the traditional dorm phone system, Ellis said Notre Dame is on "the leading edge" for changes in university communication ­changes he said have, so far, met with silent approval. 
"We've not really had any have been helpful." 
Stanford Hall resident Chris Howson experienced a longer wait than Nguyen, as he arrivod at the stadium with a group of friends when sales reopened at approximately 1 p.m. 
As he and his friends neared the front of the line, Howson explained, "We've been waiting about 40 minutes, but we expect­ed this to take time."

However, Jenkins differen­tiated between two different spirits, one with a lower case "s" and one with a capital "S," the latter being the Holy Spirit that guides us but is "not from us." This Spirit can be distinguished from others because it only leads to the truth and guides to a "pro­found and generous love," Jenkins said. 
This love, Jenkins said, should be expressed to neigh­bors, and in the spirit of this love for humanity, students should reflect upon those in developing nations whose daily lives are a struggle. 
He continued, citing vari­ous examples of such that globalization has brought to the spotlight, such as geno­cide in Sudan and the condi­tions in Haiti, Peru and Bangladesh. Jenkins men­tioned the upcoming academ­ic forum entitled "The Global Health Crisis: Forging Solutions, Effecting Change," on Sept. 14 as a place where students can get involved in a discussion about these issues. 
Burish's address cited the University as a place of con­versation, where different people join as one to engage each other. He advised first year students that they "only have one beginning ... and this is it."

Though Ellis could not provide the exact cost the service used to run the students, he said the sys­tem is "revenue neutral" for the University. 
Ellis said as of last week, only 60 students chose to opt-in to the plan. This number does not, however, include dorm Resident Assistants, who are required to have the service by ResLife and therefore receive it for free.

IN BRIEF 
Manufacturing jobs brought to NC 
RALEIGH, N.C. -A Fort Wayne, Ind., com­pany that makes parts for heavy equipment will bring 96 jobs to Surry County and invest $4.7 million in a new plant there over the next three years, officials said Tuesday. 
Ottenweller Co. Inc., a supplier of fabricated welded and precision machined parts, will receive a $75,000 state grant if it meets its job creation goals. 
The expected average weekly wage at Ottenweller will be $600 a week. The average weekly wage in the county in northwestern North Carolina is $480. 
"The ability to be close to our customers in the southeast, and North Carolina's business friendly atmosphere, made the decision to locate our plant in Surry County an easy one," said Michael Ottenweller, president of Ottenweller Co. Inc. 
Stocks advance despite Iran worries 
NEW YORK -Bullish comments from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. led Wall Street higher on Tuesday, helping offset fresh polit­ical worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
An executive at the world's No. 2 chip maker behind Intel Corp. told news services the company hopes to capture 40 percent of the global market for computer processors by 2009. Along with an upgrade from Bear Stearns, AMD shares surged 6.5 percent ­bringing technology stocks along with it. 
However, with light volume, Wall Street wasn't able to make a more robust advance as geopolitical concerns kept investors at bay. 
European Union leaders were expected to get an official response from Iran this after­noon over their offer of incentives to per­suade the nation to halt uranium enrich­ment. Iran's top nuclear negotiator did not say if his government was willing to abandon nuclear aspirations, but did commit to "seri­ous negotiations" over the dispute. 
"There a lot of geopolitical risk out there, and investors are trying to figure out where things are going with Iran," said Scott Merritt, a U.S. equity strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. "The market is pretty schizophrenic, it doesn't know what to pay attention to right now."

Emotional testimonies about Anfal campaign mark second day of trial 

Associated Press 
SUKHA BALKA -A Russian passenger jet crashed during a thunderstorm just minutes after sending a distress signal on Tuesday, killing all 170 people on board, including dozens of children. 
Emergency officials said pre­liminary information led them to believe that weather -not ter­rorism -caused the Pulkovo Airlines' Tu-154 to plummet to the ground in what was the third passenger plane crash involving Russia's aviation industry this year. 
"Nobody survived," Mykhaylo Korsakov, spokesman for the Donetsk department of the Emergency Situations Ministry, told The Associated Press. 
Ukrainian officials said a storm with high winds, driving rain and lightning was raging through the region at the time. Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Irina Andrianova, citing information from her Ukrainian counter­parts, said the plane was likely hit by lightning. 
Korsakov said the pilot asked to make an emergency landing before disappearing from the radar screens at around 2:30 p.m. 
The Tu-154 was en route from the Russian Black Sea resort of Anapa -a holiday destination popular with families -to St. Petersburg when it ran into trouble. Two minutes after the crew sent a distress signal, it dropped off the radar, said Russian emergency official Yulia Stadnikova. 
Residents of Sukha Balka, a village north of Donetsk and some 400 miles east of Kiev, found part of the plane's tail sec­tion and still-burning pieces of debris in a swampy field. Television footage showed scorched, smoldering land cov­ered in small pieces of wreck­age. Thick white smoke hung over the debris. 
Of the 170 people on board, 45 were children, Pulkovo Airlines deputy director Anatoly Samoshin told reporters at the St. Petersburg airport. The list of passengers, most of whom were from St. Petersburg, appeared to include many families. 
Investigators were searching for the flight data recorders commonly called black boxes. 
Samoshin said the pilot decid­ed to climb about 3,300 feet to try to get above the storm. But as the plane ascended from 29,500 to 36,000 feet, the pilot sent the first distress signal. Later, the pilot sent two more distress signals, the last from 9,800 feet, he said. 
Ukraine Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Igor Krol told AP that a fire broke out on the plane at 32,800 feet and the crew decided to try to make an emergency landing. 
"The only known fact is that the weather was bad, there was a strong thunderstorm and poor visibility," Ukrainian emergency official Leonid Kastorsky told Russia's NTV at the site of the crash.

Russian jet crashes, killing all aboard 
Associated Press 
BAG I I DAD Survivors described a chmnieal weapons attack on their villages in tnsti­mony Tunsday at the trial of Saddam I lussnin, telling of poi­sonous douds of' gas that killed children and blinded residents during a military oiTensivn against Kurds in 1987. 
Saddam's eo-def'endants insisted that the Anfal eam­paign, in which tons of thou­sands of Kurds were killed, was directed only at Kurdish hruerril­las and Iranian troops in north­ern Iraq during the bloody Iran­Iraq war. 
Saddam f'aces eharges of genocide in the trial, which eompleted its seeond day Tuesday. Six eo-defendants arn in the dock with him over thn 1987-88 Anfal eampaign, in whieh troops swept across parts of northern Iraq, destroying vil­lages. 
Two survivors told the eourt about an April 16, 1987 attaek on the Kurdish villages of Basilan and Sheik Wasan ­believed to be the first time Sad dam's rngime used chemical weapons on Iraqi eitizens. 
"The villagers were blinded and they wnre vomiting -only God knows what it was like that night," said Najiba Khider Ahmed, a 41-ynar-old woman from Sheik Wasan. She deseribed boing held in a deten­tion camp for nine days, where her brother and nieee disap­peared. 
"During thosn nine days, it was like the apocalypse. Even Hitler didn't do this," she said, breaking down into tears repeatedly. "Saddam II ussein used to shout about 'the Iraqi People.' If we were his people, why did he bomb us with all sorts of weapons?" 
She said she had two preg­nancies after the attack -the baby in the lirst was born with skin penling oil', and tho sncond misearried, born with mal­formed limbs, whieh she blamed on the gas attacks. 
Another survivor, Ali Mostafa llama, said the ehemical bombs let olf "grmmish smoke. It was if 

The crash occurred just two days before the second anniver­sary of near-simultaneous explo­sions on two planes over Russia. Those explosions, which killed 90 people, were blamed on Chechen terrorists. 
Both Hussian and Ukrainian officials said nothing indicated Tuesday's incident should be blamed on terrorism. 
The crash "was not a terrorist attack," said Leonid Belyayev, acting director of Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry in St. Petersburg. 
The 16-year-old plane had flown 5,600 miles since its last maintenance checkup, and was not immediately due for another check, Samoshin said. Pulkovo is among Russia's largest airlines. 
The plane "was falling down like a petal," one unidentified woman told Hussia's Channel One, waving her hand from side to side. "It was floating, it circled around, then it went down and then there immediately was an explosion ... and smoke started rising." 
Zhenya Donets, a 16-year-old villager, said he saw the plane hang in the air for a moment, before corkscrewing to the ground. 
"There were fragments of the plane and bodies were lying among them. There were chil­dren there too. Many bodies were burning, we tried to put the fire out, but all people were already dead. It was a terrible sight," he said. 
The crash was the third major incident involving Russia's avia­tion industry this year. It came less than two months after an Airbus A-310 of the Hussian air­line S7 skidded off a runway and burst into flames on July 9 in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, killing 124 people. 
On May 3, an A-320 of the Armenian airline Armavia crashed into the Black Sea while trying to land in the Hussian resort city of Sochi in rough weather, killing all 113 people aboard. 
Russian-made Tu-154s are widely used by Russian airlines for many regional flights. 
there was a rotten apple or gar­lic smell minutes later. People were vomiting ... we were blind and screaming. There was no one to rescue us . .I ust God." 
Barna, wearing a traditional Kurdish headdrnss, said he saw a newborn die during the bom­bardment. 
"The infant was trying to smell life, but he breathed in the chemicals and died," he said, speaking in Kurdish with an Arabic translator. 
Throughout the testimony, Saddam and the defense lawyers insisted the two had bnen coached in their testimony -with one lawyer asking how Ahmed, who said shn was illiter­ate, eould spneify that Russian­made Sukhoi warplanes carried out the bombardment. 
"Who told you to say these things?" Saddam asked llama at one point. 
Two of the defendants addressed the court and insisted Anfal was targeted at Iranian troops and allied Kurdish guer­rillas in northern Iraq. 
"The goal was to fight an organized, armed army ... the goal was not civilians," said Sultan I lashim al-Tai, who was the eommander of Task Force Anl'al and head of the Iraqi army 1st Corps. 
lin said civilians in the areas where Anfal took place were "safely transported" to other areas, ineluding tlw northern city of Kirkuk. 
The orders in the campaign were "to prevent the Iranian army from occupying Iraq at whatever price," al-Tai said. "I implemented them precisely and sincerely without adding anything or exeneding my pow­ers." 
"I never turned a blind eye to any violation," said al-Tai, who later served as Saddam's last defense minister, up until the 2003 U.S.-Ied invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime. 
Sabir al-Douri, thn direetor of military intelligence at the time of Anfal, said "the Iranian army and Kurdish rebels were fight­ing together" against the Iraqi army and that Anfal aimed to clear northern Iraq of Iranian troops. 
He insisted the Iraqi govern­ment faced a "tough situation" and had to aet beeause the area where the lranian-allind guerril­las were located had dams that, if destroyed, would flood Baghdad. He said eivilians in the Anfal region had already been removed. 
"You will see that we are not guilty and that we defended our eountry honorably and sincere­ly," al-Douri said.

Charter schools fall behind 
Report shows public school students performing better in math, reading 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Charter school opponents got a boost Tuesday from an unlikely source: the Bush administra­tion. 
President Bush has been a big supporter of charter schools ­public schools that are usually free of many of the regulations that govern traditional schools. 
Nevertheless, a study by the Department of Education found that fourth graders in tradition­al public schools were doing better in both reading and math than students in charter schools. 
"We welcome the release of this data," said Nancy Van Meter, deputy director of the American Federation of Teachers, which has been criti­cal of charter schools. "We've been calling for it for two years." 
Charter school foes said the findings show that the schools are a failing experiment that drains resources from tradi­tional public schools. Charter school supporters called the report flawed and outdated and said charter schools improve public education by creating competition. 
Fourth graders in regular public schools scored an aver­age of 5.2 points better in read­ing than students in charter schools on the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress test. Students in tradi­tional schools scored an aver­age of 5.8 points better in math, said the report by the National Center for Education Statistics, an agency of the Department of Education. 
Mark Schneider, commission­er of the NCES, said a small staff and other priorities had delayed release of the report. 
"The fact that this is 2003 data being reported in 2006 is something that I'm not proud of, frankly," Schneider told reporters. 
He cautioned against reading too much into the report's find­ings.

The test scores were from the 2003 National Assessment, a test given to students across the country. 
The report offered some good news about charter schools: Reading scores at charter schools in central cities serving mostly minority students were comparable to scores at tradi­tional public schools. However, math scores at such charter schools still lagged behind those at traditional schools. 
"On average, they're not doing harm," Schneider said. 
Van Meter said the report confirms research by the teach­ers union showing that charter schools are not improving edu­cation in America. 
"It says that they were not able to deliver on their promis­es on a consistent basis," Van Meter said.

Karr appears in court, declines extradition 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -John Mark Karr, wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and handcuffs chained around his waist, waived extradi­tion to Colorado on Tuesday to face murder charges in the slay­ing of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey. 
Karr spoke only briefly during a two-minute court hearing to confirm his decision. His blank expression changed only once when he slowly closed his eyes as the judge recited the charge of first-degree murder. 
Although his public defender and a former defense attorney described Karr as eager to go, it was unclear when the 41-year­old teacher would be transferred. The Boulder County sheriff's deputies would not discuss travel plans and Los Angeles jail offi­cials said they had not yet been contacted about a transfer. 
Deputy Public Defender Haydeh Takasugi, who repre­sented Karr in the hearing, said he was concerned about having to appear in court wearing jail attire rather than civilian clothes. 
"It's going to taint any potential jury pool out there," Takasugi said. "He was upset at that." 
Karr's face has flooded news­casts since he was named a sus­pect in Bangkok last week in the long-unsolved slaying of the 6­year-old beauty pageant queen, who was found strangled in the basement of her Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. 
Prosecutors have not disclosed their evidence against Karr, and his family has said he was at home in Georgia at the time of the slaying. 
Karr told reporters in Thailand before he voluntarily flew to Los Angeles on Sunday that he was not innocent in JonBenet's slay­ing, explaining only that he was present when she died and that her death was an accident. 
In addition to first-degree mur­der, the charges against Karr in a sealed probable-cause arrest warrant include felony murder, first-degree kidnapping, second­degree kidnapping and sexual assault on a child. 
The felony murder charge means prosecutors are either 

accusing Karr of killing JonBenet during the course of a sexual assault or kidnapping, or that he was present while someone else killed the girl. 
Felony murder carries the same penalties as first-degree murder: either life in prison with­out the possibility of parole or the death penalty. 
"It's a perfect insurance policy for the prosecution in Colorado," said former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman. "Even if a jury were to somehow buy that this was an accident, any death dur­ing the commission of a kidnap­ping or sexual assault is first­degree murder regardless." 
Jamie Harmon, an attorney who represented Karr when he was charged in 2001 with pos­sessing child pornography in Northern California, downplayed Karr's comments about the slay­ing. 
"A confession is a legal term ... and the statements taken from Mr. Karr are primarily sound bites," Harmon said outside court. "We have no idea what the context of the comments may be. " 
Harmon also said Karr was injured by aggressive camera crews in Thailand and has three bruised ribs and bruises on his body. 
Harmon said she and another attorney, Patience Van Zandt, would be advising Karr "in some capacity" but that she would not be accompanying him to Colorado. 
"He wants to go now," Harmon said. "Mr. Karr has been por­trayed by the media as of late as being mentally unstable, atten­tion-seeking, unwell, mentally unwell. And he is none of those things. He is anxious to have an opportunity to address the allega­tions against him, to be portrayed in a more accurate and complete way." 
The attorney said Karr was "not subject to ready categoriza­tion or easy answers." 
"You've heard the expression, 'He marches to the beat of a dif­ferent drummer?' John Karr marches to the beat of a different drummer," Harmon said. 
She described him as intelli­gent and unusual.

Last spring, while shopping in Chicago over Easter Break, I made the purchase of a lifetime: a fanny pack. For about a month I had been complaining to my friends and family that I was in dire need of a "hands free," stylish accesso­Katie ry that could be used Palmitier to transport necessi­
A Word to the 

ties (keys, ID, lipstick, 
Wzse

etc.) across campus, or even across Michigan Avenue. A purse was too big, and a backpack too bulky. The only logical choice was the infamous fanny pack, completely out of style since the early '90s (that is to say if it was ever once considered "in vogue"). Needless to say, my life since the revival of the "hip bag" has never been the same. 
Although many of you may have no desire whatsoever of digging out your neon. nylon fannies from the basement or treasured memory box, or <wen pur­chasing a new one, we all have some­thing about us just wanting to break free. Whether it is material or ideologi­cal aspects being hoarded within our self-conscious psyches, the world is being sheltered from whom some of us really are. These ideas and creativity are no longer to be carried inside of us, but rather on the outside, hands free, for the world to see. 
Instead of a fanny pack, maybe you are more of a pocket protector wearer, and long to keep your oxford shirts from receiving ink stains. But, ashamed and embarrassed to put the protector in your pocket, you suffer from the oblong navy blue ink blot on the upper left corner of your new, starched shirt. 
Or perhaps you would rather discuss a new mathematical formula than watch Monday Night Football. Well, the time is now to bust out the fanny packs, pocket protectors and calculators, all of which may have caused you years of ridicule in high schooL The bad news is your shirts are still stained, and your fanny pack may no longer lit around those Freshman Fifteen hips -but the good news is we arc no longer in high school. 
In college, and especially at a place like Notre Dame, we are allowed to start ofT with a clean slate. The nicknames, the embarrassing moments and the fashion don'ts are all erased dean. So what if you dropped your retainer in the trash can after lunch, missed sixth peri­od digging through the trash cans and had to explain to your teacher in front of your peers why you had to miss class? The sull'ering is over. The humiliation? Eliminated. It is time to finally embrace who we truly are. 
In high school, I felt restricted from exprnssing myself completely out of fear of being rejected by friends, boys, even the Catholic community. Jlownver, in the past year I have decided that I have bonn given the opportunity of' a lifetime here at Notre Dame to be me. We are at an institution where academic and spiri­tual growths are promoted. Through dis­cussion in the classroom, as well as con­versations with our peers over dinner, we aro allowed, and encouraged, to express ourselves freely. And the best part is, in doing so, we make new friends, learn about each other and gain a new appreciation and insight of our world. Faith, style, beliefs and opinions will not always be similar to those of our friends, the government, or religious teaching, yet those are the traits that define each and every one of us. By expressing these differences, we will not only learn about others' personalities and beliefs, but also will strengthen and define our own personalities and beliefs. 

Notre Dame and its students have been criticized as being overwhelmingly Catholic, white, wealthy and conserva­tive. While it may seem that many stu­dents do fall into one or more of those categories, as a whole those accusations are not necessarily true. Being that many of the students do share the same politics, religion and economic back­ground, we are challenged even more to embrace the differences we do have. No one wants to be just another stereotype. 
While we all share much in common, not one of us is exactly the same. Therefore, express your differences and embrace those of others. Our school, country and personal well-being will benefit immensely. There is no greater liberating experience than shedding our masks and growing into our own unique mold. 
We would never learn, or grow, if we all just conformed to government, reli­gion and popular fashion. Currently our world, and, even more so, our country, are in desperate need of new ideas. Therefore it is our duty, for the sake of mankind, to be ourselves. Stand up for your beliefs, express your ideas and strap on the fanny pack for the "hands free" mission of being true to yourself.

/What's switchgrass? 
As a college student whose primary means of transportation are his old monogrammed Notre Dame sandals, last year's astronomical increase in the price of gasoline hasn't affected me much. When I moved out to D.C. for the spring semester, I walked and used the Metro to get around. So it was quite a sur­prise to me when I came home for Easter and it cost me almost forty dollars to fill my gas tank. Even though I was inclined to blame my local gas station for the cost, the truth behind higher gas prices is found in the fact that crude oil is a globally traded commodity which has to react to the demands and instabilities of markets around the world. 
For the last few years, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has held back the growth of crude production to increase profits. This means that the growth of crude supply is unable to keep up with the growth of crude demand in developing nations. As workers in China and India are able to purchase cars for the first time, they enter the gas market, bid­ding against Americans for the next available gallon of fuel. This imbalance of supply and demand leads to higher prices for all crude oil traded on the world market. 


Despite the undeniable fact that recent price increases are caused by the explosive economic growth of China and India and the desire of Iran, Venezuela and Russia to make as much money as possible from their limited crude supplies, some policy makers have decided that a windfall profits tax on American oil companies would help rectify the problem. 
According to supporters of the wind­fall profits tax, or WPT, such a meas­ure would add billions to federal rev-. enue and prevent big business from extorting working families. Critics claim that taxing oil companies for being successful leads to decreased oil production and refining capacity due to the perceived lack of returns on invest­ment. 
Luckily for us, we are able to look back at the 1980s to examine the effects of the WPT. According to the Library of Congress, the WPT actually decreased domestic oil production by as much as 1.27 billion barrels and increased our dependence on foreign oil as increased marginal costs led to decreased extraction of oil from American wells. The increase in oil imports due to the WPT as well as the many exemptions in the WPT led to actual revenues being about $80 bil­lion instead of the projected $393 bil­lion return. The utter failure of this provision to collect revenues and iso­late American oil prices from the world market led to its repeal in 1988. 
Considering the fact that recent increases in oil prices exist because of foreign problems in supply and demand, I believe it would be a horri­ble idea to reinstate a policy which increases our dependence on imported oil. Increases in oil costs are a threat to the stability of the consumer gaso­line market, and energy companies are investing significantly in biological renewable fuel technology. 
As gas prices soar, the energy com­pany that can first provide a cheaper fuel to consumers will be able to make great profits, and corporations are rac­ing to get products ready for market. Shell Oil recently invested $45 million in Iogen, a Canadian technology com­pany, to build the first cellulosic ethanol plant in North America. Oil companies know that their days are numbered, and are investing their "windfall profits" into new forms of energy so that they will be able to thrive once gasoline becomes too expensive for most consumers. 
Corn-based ethanol has long been championed as gasoline's successor for consumer energy needs. Politicians and energy companies have occasion­ally claimed that the U.S. will be able to grow all of its energy through corn­based ethanol. Unfortunately, using a food product like corn to produce ethanol would mean that a massive increase in corn consumption for ethanol production would lead to like increases in corn prices because of greater demand for corn to make ethanol. 
A far better alternative to corn-based ethanol is cellulosic ethanol. Stalky eel­!uloid plants like switchgrass can grow in currently unused pasture lands, and many have no significant commercial use today, so there would be no con­current inflation in prices. Additionally, the cheaper costs of switchgrass com­pared to corn would make cellulosic ethanol almost twenty cents cheaper per gallon than corn-based ethanol. The National Resource Defense Council argues that an investment of $2.1 bil­lion in cellulosic ethanol research and product development could make the US energy independent by 2050. As an added bonus, switchgrass makes an excellent shelter for field animals. David Hamilton of the Sierra Club says that cellulosic ethanol is environmen­tally friendly, and could reduce green­house gas emissions by 1. 7 billion tons per year. 

It is very rare that the Sierra Club and Shell Oil agree on anything. Sure, oil companies are making record prof­its, but they are investing those profits in new technologies that will lower fuel costs, help the environment and aid farmers. I say don't look a gift horse in the mouth-feed it switchgrass.

"Nacho Libre" had its best moments mostly thanks to Black's comedic talent, but the rest of the film failed to impress. Nickelodeon Films signed on to produce and promote the film, perhaps leading to childish humor that can often turn away adult viewers. Even though "Nacho Ubre" ended up as a disappointment, positives included Jack Black's ever funny acting abilities along with a strong per­formance from the young, gifted actress Ana de la Reguera. For Hess, only time will tell whether he is a one-hit-wonder director or can establish himself as a prominent Hollywood filmmaker. 
X-Men: The Last Stand 

There are moments in "X-Men: The Last Stand" that boggle the senses and the mind. Sadly, these moments more often than not boggle in a negative and uninspiring manner. 
As the third ·movie in an already successftll comic book trilogy, there were both high hopes and expec­tations that "X3" would rake in box office gold. The movie was billed as an "event movie," but the only events were needless story points and characters that were never developed or resolved. Bryan Singer, director of the first two "X-Men" movies, left "X3" to film "Superman Returns" and Brett Ratner ("Rush Hour 2") stepped in to finalize the series. 
While Singer's talent did not help "Superman Returns," it was sorely missed in "X3." The first two films artfully combined character-driven story­telling with excellent special effects, but "X3" relied solely on mind-blowing effects, leaving a story that was just mind-numbing. Significant characters like Rogue were pushed aside in order to feature as many mutants as possible without expounding on backstories or character development. "X3" served as a functional film instead of the masterful climax to a trilogy befitting mention among the likes of "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings." 
THE UGLY 

A mixed bag and often exactly what is expected from summer blockbusters -light, cheap entertain­ment that is almost immediately forgotten. While some feel like wasted potential, these films were effective diversions on hot summer days. 
Clerks II 

After the abysmal "Jersey Girl," Kevin Smith returns with "Clerks II," a film that is not up to his past accomplishments, but still worthy of the name "a Jay and Silent Bob movie." 
Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson return as Dante Hicks and Randal Graves. Their quirky rela­tionship has its moments, but the originality and carefree nature of the first mm did not translate well in the sequel-mostly because of its narrative. "Oerks II" has a story while the original consisted of two guys hanging out and talking about every­thing from girls to constructio~ workers in "Return of the Jedi." Where "Clerks" had witty dialogue and biting sarcasm, "Clerks II" focuses more on the story involving the surrounding characters. However, Jay and Silent Bob are as lazy as ever and make funny jokes at the expensive of other charac­ters -just about everything one would expect from them. "Clerks II" is a funny film but not one that deserves a high spot in Smith's filmography. He has made a funny and acceptable return. However, "Clerks II" is just too little too late. 
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest 
The second movie in the popular trilogy smashed box office records over the summer. Director Gore Verbinski sent Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann on a quest to retrieve the Dead Man's Chest from Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). 
Highlighted by the crazy antics of Johnny Depp, top-notch special effects and action scenes, "Dead Man's Chest" sailed to become the highest grossing Disney film ever and one of the top films of all time. Despite hauling in a. treasure. chest of money, some reviews of the film were tepid due to its long run­ning time, slow plot development and clifThanger ending. These criticisms were tempered with hopes that the third film would resolve plot holes and bring a stronger conclusion. When the final film of the "Pirates" trilogy arrives in theaters next sum­mer, studio execs hope to couple the assured finan­cial windfall with the critical success earned by the first "Pirates" film. 
Superman Returns 
Brandon Routh looks a great deal like the late Christopher Reeve, but he doesn't display as much of Reeve's charm and charisma in this update of the Superman saga. Bryan Singer at once paid tribute to the older films, while creating new ground for the franchise. 
Although Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane) and Routh are both unexciting in their portrayals, Kevin Spacey gives an enjoyable performance as Lex Luthor. The CGI effects are stunning, and the whole movie is beautiful to watch. Even with an unimagi­native storyline and a few lackluster portrayals, "Superman Returns" is still an exciting event. 
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby 
It is impossible to watch "Talladega Nights" with­out evoking 2004's "Anchorman." Both were creat­ed by writer/director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. "Nights" may feature cars instead of news report­ing, but it uses the same approach to comedy -a random collection of sketches tied together by a loose plot. The only real difference is that the "Talladega" plot is thinner -much thinner. The cast's comedic improvisation carries the film, but the initial script could have used a great deal more work. The supporting cast is impressively funny, especially Sacha Baron Cohen as Ferrell's arch rival, a gay, French Formula 1 racer.

TRACK & FIELD 


NEW YORK -Sprinter Justin Gatlin agreed to an eight-year ban from track and field Tuesday, avoiding a lifetime penalty in exchange for his coopera­tion with doping authorities and because his first posi­tive drug test was deemed an honest mistake. 
He will forfeit the world record he tied in May, when he ran the 100 meters in 
9.77 seconds. At age 24, the lengthy ban would all but knock Gatlin out of competi­tion for the rest of his life. 
Gatlin tested positive in April for testosterone or other steroids, five years after his first positive test, which was for medicine to control attention-deficit dis­order. Under the World Anti-Doping Agency code, a second doping offense calls for a lifetime ban. 
But Gatlin reached a com­promise with the U.S. Anti­Doping Agency, which levies doping penalties in America. Under terms of the compro­mise, he can still appeal to an arbitration panel in the next six months to have the term reduced. 
He cannot, however, argue that the test was faulty. 
"To his credit, it's recogni­tion that the science is reli­able," USADA general coun­sel Travis Tygart told The Associated Press. "Instead 
IN BRIEF 
Glavine learJ]Ji he will not 
need shoulder surgery 
NEW YORK -Tom Glavine does not need surgery on his troublesome left shoulder and will be able to rejoin the New York Mets' rotation in seven to 10 days. 
Glavine felt coldness in his left ring finger after a start last week, trigger­ing fears that a blood clot might have developed that could end his season -or possibly, his career. 
An angiogram Monday showed that no invasive procedure is needed. 
"The test showed that the symp­toms are caused by an old injury to an artery probably caused by pitch­ing," the Mets said in a statement Tuesday. "The scar tissue from that old injury occasionally causes blood clots to form in Tom's finger. The condition is not serious and will be treated with baby aspirin and other medication to help his circulation." 
A news conference was expected at Shea Stadium before Tuesday night's game against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
of wasting a bunch of resources attempting to cre­ate smoke where there's not any, he's acknowledging the accuracy of the positive test, and in exchange for his agreement to cooperate, we've recognized the nature of his first offense." 
The first offense occurred while Gatlin was in college. He stopped taking the ADD medicine a few days before competition, but it did not clear his system. He received a two-year ban for that test, which was reduced by a year because of the "exceptional circum­stances" of the offense. 
"The nature of Gatlin's first offense for use of his medication puts this viola­tion in a unique category," said USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden. 
Gatlin has said he didn't know how steroids got into his system this time. 
One of his attorneys, John Collins, said Gatlin would spell out his case at the arbitration hearing. He would not discuss strategy. 
"The last time this hap­pened, he went to the panel and explained he neither cheated nor intended to cheat," Collins said. "This time, we'll explain the full stack of circumstances and everything around it and, hopefully, we'll get a simi­lar result." 
"I was relieved to hear the news," Glavine said in a statement, "First and foremost to hear that the condi­tion is not serious, but also to hear that I can get back to doing what I love to do relatively quicklj!." Pacers reacquire forward Harrington from Hawks 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indiana Pacers finally completed a sign-and­trade deal with the Atlanta Hawks for forward AI Harrington on Tuesday. 
The Pacers acquired Harrington and center John Edwards in exchange for a 2007 first-round pick. Harrington spent the first six years of his career with the Pacers before spending the last two in Atlanta. 
"We've had Al before," Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh said. "He was a good player for us when we had him the first time. He comes back with more seasoning. Most importantly, he fits in with what we're trying to do at this point." 
Walsh and team president Larry 

Bird considered Harrington one of the summer's top three free agents, along with Ben Wallace and Peja Stojakovic. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 18.6 points and 6.9 rebounds for the Hawks last season and was the central figure to the Pacers plans to recover from a 41-41 season that ended with a first-round e.Jayoff exit. Uiamondbacks trade Shawn 
Green to Mets 
NEW YORK -Outfielder Shawn Green was traded from the Arizona Diamondbacks to the New York Mets on Tuesday night, giving the NL East leaders one more big bat as they gear up for the postseason. 
Two team officials familiar with the trade confirmed the deal to The Associated Press. They spoke on con­dition of anonymity because the trade had not been officially announced. 
It was not immediately known what the Mets traded to get the 33­year-old Green.

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
AC Milan, Liverpool advance to first round 
Two-time champion Benfica moves on with 3-0 win over Vienna 
Associated Press 
MILAN -AC Milan and Liverpool advanced to the first round of the European Champions League on Tuesday along with Benfica and Hamburg SV. 
AC Milan, a six-time cham­pion whose berth was in doubt because of Italy's match-fixing scandal, won 2­1 at Red Star Belgrade on goals by Filippo Inzaghi and Clarence Seedorf to win the home-and-home, total-goals qualifier on 3-1 aggregate. 
Originally, AC Milan quali­fied for the Champions League by finishing second in Italy's Serie A last season. 
But it was penalized 30 points in last season's stand­ings, moving it down to fourth and forcing it into the third round of qualifying. It will be penalized eight points in this season's Serie A standings. 
Juventus was stripped of its last two Serie A titles and demoted to Serie B, and its Champions League berth was taken away. 
After AC Milan built a 2-0 lead, Dusan Djokic scored for Red Star in the 80th. 
Liverpool, which won its fifth title in 2005, tied Maccabi Haifa 1-1 at Kiev to advance on 3-2 aggregate. The game was moved by the Union of European Football Associations to the Ukraine capital because of the current conflict in Israel. 
Peter Crouch headed in Liverpool's goal in the 54th minute, but Roberto Colautti tied it nine minutes later after Brazilian midfielder Anderson dribbled past four players and his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Pepe Reina. 
Benfica, a two-time champi­on, won 3-0 at visiting Austria Vienna to advance on 4-1 aggregate, getting goals from Rui Costa, Nuno Gomes and Armando Petit. 
Hamburg SV tied 1-1 at Spain's Osasuna following a 0-0 draw at home and advanced on away goals. 
The German club, which won the title in 1983, fell behind on Carlos Cuellar's goal in the sixth minute, then tied the score in the 74th on Nigel De Jong's goal off Rafael van der Vaart's cross. 
Eleven more qualifiers are set for Wednesday, and eight four-team groups for the first round will be drawn Thursday. 
TENNIS 

Davenport opens title run 
Veteran begins defense ofPilot Pen title with victory in straight sets 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. ­Lindsay Davenport started slow­ly but tinished strong Tuesday in a straight-set win over Katarina Srebotnik as she began her title defense at the Pilot Pen. 
The seventh-seeded Davenport managed just two points in the first two games before recovering for a (>-3, 6-3 win. 
"I just got oil" to a little bit of a slow start, but from love-2, I lost just one more game that set," she said. "Overall, it was a good performance considering the amount of time l'vn playnd the last six or seven months." 
It was the only the ninth match of the year for the former No. 1 player, whose battled injuries throughout the season. Bulging disks in her back side­lined her in March and a con­cussion sustained from a fall at her Los Angeles home kept her out of Wimbledon. She's bank­ing on a solid outing at New Haven, the final hard-court tuneup before next week's U.S. Open. 
"This was really my target tournament, so I'm happy with the goal of coming hnre and winning a match and playing better," she said. "I feel like I've improved a lot over the last cou­ple of weeks and I feel like I'll learn a lot from this and hope­fully carry it with me." 
D!ivenport charged out to a 3­0 lead in the second set with pinpoint passing and a solid service game. She appeared on the verge of cruising into the second round until Srebotnik, ranked 23rd in the world, dug in. Down 4-1, Srebotnik sur­vived three break points, hold­ing serve on a cross-court win­ner. But she was unable to break Davenport and has now lost all three head-to-head meetings. 
In other women's action, Mara Santangelo went from lucky loser to upset winner, beating eighth-seeded Anastasia Myskina of Hussia in three sets. 
Hanked No. 40 in the world, the 25-year-old Italian won a spot in the women's draw despite losing in the qualitiers when Dinara Salina pulled out of the tournament with an elbow injury. 
Santangelo lost the first set 4­6 before taking the next two, 6­3, 6-4. Down 15-40 in the final game, she was able to serve out the set. 
"I tried to push harder (on) my serve," she said. "It was not easy from 15-40. I'm very happy." 
In the men's draw, American Mardy Fish's run ended in a three-set, seeond-round loss to fifth-seeded David Ferrer, who beat the American 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 
(7-5). 
It was the third meeting between the two and the first time the 13th-ranked Ferrer has beaten Fish. 
Neither yielded serve in the linal set, with Ferrer having the best chance of breaking Fish in the ninth game. But Fish hung on, saving a break point in the three-deuce game. Ferrer screamed and slammed his racket in frustration. 

He gathered himself and jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. Down 6-3, Fish saved two match points before sending a backhand wide. 
"It was important today to stay in the match and not to lose focus," Ferrer said through a translator. 
Fish is ranked No. 60 in the world and rejoined the ATP Tour this year after spending most of the 2005 season side­lined with injuries to his left wrist. 
"I take that as a positive and know I ean play with a guy right there who is in the top 10 or top 15 in the world. The guy is obvi­ously in form and we both played some good tennis in the third set." 
Svetlana Kuznetsova, the women's fifth seed, also avoided an upset, showing some stami­na in the process. In her second consecutive three-set match, she outlasted Tatiana Golovin of Franee, 6-0, 2-6, 6-4.

"It's a totally different thing when they're hitting 3-point shots," Slovenian swingman Bostjan Nachbar said. "When they make 3s, you can't pull the defenders in and hope for rebounds. That opens the lane, and then they're really tough to stop."

Slovenia made only two of six 3-point shots in the first half and finished 6-for-15 [ 40 per­cent].

In the first three games here, the Americans have forced 64 turnovers.

NFL 
Simon undergoes surgery 
Indianapolis defensive tackle has arthroscopic work on left knee 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. ­Indianapolis defensive tackle Corey Simon is likely to miss a couple of more weeks after having arthroscopic surgery on his injured left knee, but was hopeful he could return for the regular-season opener. 
"It was just that, after the second opinion, we thought it was best to go that way," he said. "So we took care of it." 
Simon hasn't practiced since banging his knee Aug. 4. 
Colts coach Tony Dungy had only said that the Colts were considering surgery for the former Pro Bowl defensive tackle who signed a five-year deal last September. 
Dungy expects Simon to return the week before the Colts play their final presea­son game against Cincinnati on Sept. 1 but hasn't decided whether Simon would play. 

"He's really targeting open­ing day," Dungy said Tuesday. 
At 300 pounds, Simon is the biggest player on a defensive line that is undersized by most NFL standards. Known as a run-stuffer, Simon is expected to play a major role in the Colts' defensive tackle rotation that also includes Montae Reagor and Raheem Brock, a converted defensive end who is moving full-time to tackle this s1mson. 
Simon plans to sit out Saturday against New Orleans and if he misses the Cincinnati game, it would mark the second straight year he's missed the entire presea­son. The Colts first regular season game is Sept. 10 against the New York Giants. 
In 2005, Simon held out

Colts signed the Colts defensive tackle practice for the
former Pro Bowl selection hoping he would be the final piece to their Super Bowl puz­zle. 
But skipping meaningless games does not concern Simon. 
"The preseason is great," he said, smiling. "It's the presea­son, you know." 
The question now is how long it will take him to get to 100 percent. 
He reported to camp signifi­cantly lighter and admittedly in better shape than last year, and he acknowledged that it would take some time for him to get back in football shape. 
''I'm definitely ahead of the curve from when~ I was last year," he said. "I think I was playing prntty well, practicing pretty well and knnping thn weight off. The only bad thing is that nothing gets you in

Painter feels pressure as Purdue quarterback 
Sophomore starter to follow in footsteps of Griese, Dawson, Brees 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. ­Strong-armed sophomore Purdue quarterback Curtis Painter knows he's under pressure to guide the Boilermakers back to respectability al'tnr a 5-6 sea­son. 
Painter said he looks for­ward to thn challenge at a pro­gram that has produced an impressive list of quarterbacks that went on to NFL success, ineluding Bob Griese, Len Dawson, Gary Danielson, and more recently, Drew Brees and Kyle Orton. 
"It's an honor to be a part of this tradition," he said. "There's been a lot of' great quarterbacks around here, and to be in the same sentence as some of them is really great. I hope I ean perform half as good as they did. If I can do that, I think I ean be successful." 
He wears the same No. 12 as Griese, who 40 years ago led the Boilermakers to a Rose Bowl win over USC. Purdue will wear throwback uniforms in the season opener Sept. 2 against Indiana State to honor Griese's 1966 team. 

Coach Joe Tiller benched Brandon Kirsch in favor of Painter midway through last season. After a slow start, Painter elosed the year by leading Purdue to three straight wins. Kirseh left the program after last season, making Painter's transition easier. 
"I sense that Curtis is more comfortable today in his role than at any time last year," Purdue coach Joe Tiller said. "I think his confidence has improved, and I think that's through reps and experience. I think the fact that the guy who he has replaced is not here is hopefully good for him." 
Painter finished with 932 yards passing and 251 rushing last season. lie isn't expected to carry the team, but the 6­foot-4, 230-pounder has the potential to do it. 
"He's not going to lose a game for us," Tiller said. "Now as he matures and gets older, he can win a lot of games for us. But for right now, he per­forms at a level we expect, he's pretty level-headed and a good decision maker." 
An offense of spread passing with an occasional option play won't change much for Painter, who likes what the option does.

better decisions had a program like this been around when I graduated from college," Pinkett said. "When I got my first NFL paycheck, I would go to the ATM machine and take out the maximum amount just because I could. I went into a store to buy one suit and ended up buying seven." 
Poutre, who started his own business while he was a sopho­more at Hartford and made $250,000 profit before the start of his junior year, remind­ed students about fiscal responsibility. 
"I spent the $250,000 really fast," he said. "I bought two cars and even a racehorse. If I have saved that money, it would be worth close to a mil­lion dollars today." 
Despite his youthful indiscre­tion, Poutre's business acumen allowed him to become finan­cially independent by age 40 and semi-retire as a coach and adjunct professor at Hartford. 
"Playbook for Life" originat­ed in March 2005 after The Hartford surveyed student-ath­letes and found that 75 percent wanted more information about financial planning. The company came to Pinkett, who was selling insurance for them at the time, and asked if he would be "team captain" for their financial planning educa­tion effort. 
To help get "Playbook for Life" off the ground, Pinkett put together a group of former college athletes who had become successful in other endeavors to give presenta­tions around the country. The group, called "Team Hartford," is made up mostly of former student-athletes who did not play professionally. 
'Tm sort of the aberration," said Pinkett, who played seven years in the NFL for the Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints. 
Since its inception, "Team Hartford" has written a booklet -an actual "playbook" for personal finance -which its members hand out for free at all its presentations. The book­let is also available online at playbook.the hartford.com. 
"The language in the booklet is practical and there are things you can get out of it, whether you are an incoming freshman or an outgoing sen­ior," Pinkett said. 
The program was initially aimed only at student-athletes but has been expanded in recent months to include regu­lar college students. 
"What we discovered over the past year or so is we real­ized the information is relevant to all students," Pinkett said. "A lot of college students think, 'Well, when it happens I'll take care of it, but, in reality, if they would start doing the things we talk about in the book while they're still in college, it would make their lives a lot easier."' 
Pinkett was a two-time All­American at Notre Dame and holds 13 Irish records. In addi­tion to his work on "Playbook for Life" at The Hartford, he works as a football analyst for Westwood One, contributing color commentary for Notre Dame radio broadcasts.

him to miss the season. 
Senior defensive tackle Derek Landri said he was happy to have Leitko as a possible backup during the game. 
"He's right back where he left off," Landri said after the team's practice Tuesday. 
Defensive coordinator Rick Minter said Leitko and Cullen could bring an important vocal leadership role to the team, even if they do not start on a defensive line that fea­tures returning veterans Landri, Victor Abiamiri, Chris Frome and Trevor Laws. 
"That kind of leadership is something we look for from all the seniors," Minter said. 
Unlike Leitko or Cullen, Chervanick is listed as an offensive lineman, but has seen most of his action on the defensive side of the ball. 
The fifth-year senior played in four games during the 2005 season, made two tack­les and caused one quarter­back hurry. Chervanick made one special teams appear­ance, while earning the rest of his playing time at defen­sive tackle. 
The only player out of the 

four who is not a predomi­nantly defensive lineman is Jansen, who took over long snapping duties last year starting with Notre Dame's 34-31 defeat to USC. 
Now a junior, Jansen has been a reliable fixture on long snaps, successfully converting all 62 attempts he made dur­ing the regular season. 
All four will return to the practice field Wednesday as Notre Dame continues its third and final week of fall camp with another late-after­noon session on Cartier Field.

utive conference titles as the team maintains its rigorous academic standards. He said he has seen Saint Mary's progress during his tenure "to the point that the combination of athlet­ics and academics available is virtually one of the finest offer­ings in the country." 
Kachmarik notes that all of the Belles' teams had collective GPAs of between 3.1 and 3.48 with goals for this year of 3.2 to 
3.6. Incredibly, many of the Belles have become even more than student-athletes, uniting to become powerful forces in the community. Kachmarik said the Saint Mary's Student­Athlete Advisory Council, whieh is made up of two student-ath­letes from every team, is one of the strongest in the country. 
Every team has either two or three service projects and the women combine to host such events as Halloween party for children from the Logan Center and Valentine's party for chil­dren from Memorial Hospital. 
Senior golfer Katie O'Brien said playing golf for the Belles has taught her more than sim­ply skill in the sport. 
"It has shown me how to manage time, deal with differ­ent types of people and be a leader not only on the course, but also in the elassroom," O'Brien said. "Since I enjoy golf so much, it is easy for me to find time to fit it in to my school schedule." 
Saint Mary's has gone from eighth to fourth in the MIAA overall standings in the last seven years, but Kachmarik hopes the athletic program as a whole can follow the lead of the golf team and continue to improve.

Norman secured the game for the Irish with a powerful shot past Janicek with just two minutes left to play. 
"lllel scored tho goal of the game," Clark said. "Fantastic. fantastic goal." 
In the second half, St. Francis had numerous chances to score an equalizer. The Red Flash came their closest al"ter midfielder Brnnt Brockman had an open shot on net. The play developed after goalkeeper Andrew Quinn stepped out to defend a previous attack, but had the ball deflected and cleared by senior defenseman Ryan Miller, whose slide tackle saved an equalizing goal. 
"They got in behind us more than I would have liked," Clark said. "They have a good side and they made it very difficult for us; full credit to them." 
Despite a few scares, Clark was impressed with the per­formance he got from both his goalies, as senior Chris Cahill kept the Red Flash scoreless in the first half while Quinn kept them out of the goal in the final 45 min­utes. 
"Quinn maybe had a little more to do than Cahill, [but] both did well," Clark said. "I don't know if we've decided who's going to be the starter, because they've both done very well through the early season." 
Clark was also pleased with the team's progression from their first exhibition -a 1-0 victory at Drake -to Monday night's game.

SMC GOLF 
Saint Mary's ranked third by Golf Digest 
By BECKI DORNER Sports Writer 
Princeton. Yale. Harvard. These are just a few of the world-renowned universities with whom Saint Mary's finds itself ranked in a new Golf Digest article. 
The national publication recently released its annual ranking of top schools for female student-athlete golfers. Saint Mary's was ranked third, behind Princeton and Yale, in the list that noted schools where the student-athletes are "excellent students first, golfers second, [providing] the absolute best education and an opportu­nity to play." 
Harvard and Trinity (Texas) rounded out the top-five. Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) rival Trinity College joins the Belles as the only other Division-III Team to earn top­five honors. 
Factors considered in the rankings were adjusted scoring average, player growth, aca­

... demics, climate, coaches and

facilities. Saint Mary's earned the highest possible marks for academics, followed closely by player improvement. Saint Mary's had higher marks than Yale, Dartmouth, Brown and Penn for its academics. 
Saint Mary's athletic director Lynn Kachmarik was pleased with the new rankings. 
"Everyone associated with our golf program and entire athletic program has been working hard for years to bring this kind of credibility and national recognition to SMC," she said. "I have never been more excited or proud to be at Saint Mary's then I am right now." 
Saint Mary's has enjoyed unprecedented success from its student-athlete golfers in the past both on the course and in the classroom. In 2003, Saint Mary's golfer Stefanie Simmerman became the col­lege's first national champion when she captured individual medalist honors. More recently, Megan Mattia finished No. 18 last year at the NCAA Championships after winning MVP honors for the MIAA con­ference. 
Belles coach Mark Hamilton has led the team to four consec­

MEN's SoccER 

Irish win with second half surge 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Spores Editor 
Second-half goals by for­ward Bright Dike and Nate Norman lifted No. 15 Notre Dame to a 2-0 victory over St. Francis Monday night as the Irish concluded their perfect preseason. 
Notre Dame head coach Bobby Clark was pleased with his team's effort in the second and final exhi­bition. 
"We had the best share of things, it was a good game," he said. 
The game remained deadlocked throughout the first half despite a 7-3 Irish advantage in shots on goal. 
Notre Dame finally broke through in the second half after midfielder Andrew Benton deflected a Kurt Martin corner kick to Dike in the 63rd minute, and Dike was able to beat St. Francis goalkeeper Justin

FOOTBALL 
Past great returns as speaker 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
When he got his first NFL contract, former Notre Dame running back Allen Pinkett was not careful with his money. 
Now he's making sure other recent college graduates don't make the same mistake. 
Pinkett is touring colleges around the country preaching a message of responsible spending, retirement savings and debt management with The Hartford Financial Group's "Playbook for Life" project. 
On Monday, Pinkett stopped at Notre Dame. Along with Hartford University golf coach William Poutre, the former Irish great gave a presentation for almost 150 senior student athletes in the morning and another for a smaller group of regular students in the after­noon at the Career Center in Planner Hall.

Four players earn full scholarships 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Notre Dame had the scholar­ships available, and Irish head coach Charlie Weis had three linemen and a long snapper in mind. 
On Monday, Notre Dame's athletic department announced that defensive line­men Casey Cullen, Travis Leitko and Dan Chervanick, and long snapper J.J. Jansen would receive football scholar­ships for the 2006 season. 
"The four players were sur­prised with their scholarships at a private team meeting con­ducted at the conclusion of Monday's practice," the athlet­ics press release said. 
Cullen is a 6-foot-1 senior who forced two fumbles last season on special teams. lie began his career as a reserve linebacker, but switched before the 2005 season and played in all 12 of Notre Dame's games last season. 
Cullen also earned a one­year scholarship last season for his "commitment, dedica­tion, work ethic and perform­ance during spring and fall camp," according to a Notre Dame press release from Aug. 22, 2005 -nearly one year to the day before earning his sec­ond such scholarship. 
The other three have taken different routes to obtaining their scholarships. 
Leitko was a scholarship player from 2002 through 2004, but was not on the Irish roster in 2005. He returns to Notre Dame this year after leaving for the 2005-06 school year for academic reasons. The aerospace engineer strug­gled with a form of attention deficit disorder that forced
