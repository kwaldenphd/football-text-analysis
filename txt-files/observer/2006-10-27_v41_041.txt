New Web site offers help for pregnant students 
By MAUREEN MULLEN News Writer 
The Notre Dame Office of Student Affairs launched a new Web site this week dedi­cated to providing support to students facing unplanned pregnancies. 
Ann Firth, associate vice president for Student Affairs, played an instrumental role in creating the site, which explains the University's policy concerning pregnancy and offers information on counsel­ing resources and assistance programs for pregnant stu­dents. Firth, along with a com­mittee of individuals from the Office of Student Affairs, rep­resentatives from the University's Counseling Center and Health Center and stu­dents from Notre Dame Right to Life collaborated to produce the site. 

Firth said the site was not created due to any recent increase in student pregnancy, but simply as "an attempt to give students more informa­tion." It is important that this information be accessible to students online, she said, because the Internet is the place students might first go for information. 
"Oftentimes people don't know where to turn," she said. 

Student Affairs has frequent­ly run "Don't Go It Alone" ads for pregnant students in The Observer, and the new Web site "seemed to be the next logical piece," Firth said. 
Firth said the construction of the site was motivated by a desire to "better articulate what the University believes" -to dispel false understand­ings of the University's preg­nancy policy. 
"I think there is the common misconception that pregnant students could be kicked out of Notre Dame. That," Firth said, "is completely false." 
Notre Dame's studen1io hand­book, duLac, states that "in keeping with its mission as a

D.C. program numbers declining 
Football effect deters fall semester applicants; internship opportunities missed 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL News Writer 
Of the 53 percent of Notre Dame students who participate in an international study pro­gram, most make plans to view Incan ruins, Michelangelo's masterpieces and Egyptian pyr­amids. 
For just a smalJ number of students studying "abroad," the White House tops the sightsee­ing list. 
Six students are studying this fall in Washington, D.C. as part of the Office of International Studies' only domestic program. The program's current capacity is 15 students, but lack of inter­est means sending six this fall and 13 this spring. 
Liz LaFortune, academic coordinator of the Washington Program, attributed some of the dwindling interest to confusion -a domestic program is not "abroad" in the traditional sense -and to the physical movements of the office in the last few years. 
LaFortune named another factor, however, as a more influential deterrent from spending a semester in Washington: a strong football season. 
"We call it the 'Charlie Weis effect,"' LaFortune said. "The Office of International Studies has seen a decrease in fall applications across the board." 
As far as football is con­cerned, the program is unique because students can squeeze in trips to South Bend -junior Dan O'Connell said he returned to campus twice during his stay in the nation's capital last spring. Students studying over­seas likely would not have the same opportunity. 
With studying abroad nearly synonymous with traveling across the continent, the Washington Program offers stu­dents a very different experi­

Library upgrade planned 
Cluster relocation to first floor considered 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News Editor 

Keeping with the tide of technological improvements 
· that has recently swept the University, the Office of Information Technologies (OTT) is now looking to give the Hesburgh Library com­puter cluster a major facelift. 
In conjunction with University Libraries staff, OIT is making plans to move the cluster -currently tucked away on the building's second floor -to an open area on the first floor, direct­ly to the left of the current Reference Desk. 
The move, however, will 
mean  a  lot  more  than just  
that.  
"Based  on  the  planning  

stage so far, we wouldn't just be moving what's there," said Nigel Butterwick, University librarian and associate direc­tor for User Services. "We'd be effectively opening a much improved facility on the first floor." 
Butterwick explained that while the physical area allot­ted for the new cluster is not larger than that of its current location, the types of technol­ogy and study spaces avail­able will be far more varied. Plans include not only the

Relay raises money 
for cancer research 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
The University community will gather tonight to cele­brate the progress of cancer research and raise money to advance the fight against cancer in Notre Dame's fourth annual Relay for Life. The event begins at 6:30 p.m. in the Stepan Center and stretches until Saturday at 10 a.m. 
The two-day, one-night event is one of thousands of Relays that happen nation­wide and serve as fundrais­ers for the American Cancer Societv. · Last· year more than 1,000 students, faculty and staff raised roughly $100,000. This year, Dee Dee Sterling and Jessica Brookshire ­two of the event's four co­chairs -expect a similar turnout, but the goal is to exceed last year's total dona­tions. 
In terms of both participa­tion and money raised, Brookshire said Notre Dame ranks "probably in the top 10" of all other college Relay events. 
Relay teams, including res­idence halls and academic departments, raised funds in creative ways, Brookshire said. One team of Holy Cross priests put on an event called "Priests on Wheels" which

Joumalist discusses poverty 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
A cardboard roof and blan­ket of newspapers are quin­tessential images of poverty, but when the U.S. govern­ment counted more than 37 million people living below the poverty line in 2005, that figure encompassed a much larger segment of the popula­tion than the homeless. 
Pulitzer Prize recipient David Ship~er, a renowned journalist and scholar, spoke Thursday night in the Jordan Auditorium about the millions of families who may sleep in brick houses, but are nonetheless on the breadline -and overlooked -in a lee-

Living in the 'armpit' 
When I heard on our local news in Scranton, Pa. that NBC was going to adapt the classic British comedy "The Office" for American television -and set it in Scranton -I did not know what to expect. So, I did 
Chris Hine 
a little research and found that some websites 
compared Sports Writer 
Slough, the set­ting for the British version, to an armpit. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant purposely picked a depressing city to underscore the characters' humdrum lives. 
I feared the worst, like the pro­ducers making fun of our economi­cally depressed, Gerry 'McNamara­loving area where you need to know someone who knows a guy jn order to get a good job. The materi­al was there, but how would they use it? 
"Life moves a little slower in Scranton, and that's the way we like it," is the harshest I've heard after 33 episodes. That's not to say they are wrong in depicting Scranton as an armpit, but it is nice that they restrain themselves. The above comment is mostly correct, except life doesn't move slower in Scranton -it is static. 
The character of Jim is a gradu­ate of Bishop Hannan high school and now works in "The Office." One Scranton resident in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, "I can just see him graduating from Bishop Hannan and getting a job at a local Scranton company. That is what we do here." 
Our grandparents established our family roots there and went to work in the coalmines. Some left after the coalmines went out of style, but many stayed. People complain about how depressing of a city it is, but they never leave. There's some­thing about Scranton that keeps you there. Like any other town, your family and friends are there. For how boring and mundane life may be, it's our home. 
"The Office" has recently put Scranton back on the map and has been a bright spot for the city. Each episode is filled with references to Scranton landmarks like the coalmines or the Steamtown Mall. Rumor has it the producers plan on coming to Scranton to film an episode about our St. Patrick's Day Parade, one of the largest in the country. 
When some of my friends from campus came to Scranton this sum­mer, I felt an odd sense of pride as we drove through Scranton and got our picture taken by the "Scranton Welcomes You" used in the opening credits to the show. I couldn't wait to show them what Scranton was like. 
And before "The Office," I'd never felt pride for my hometown like that. 
Even if it is an armpit.

School boots 3 girls in 'Underpants' 
LONG BEACH, N.Y.-A high school principal has decreed that Captain Underpants has no place in an institution of learning. 
Three 17-year-old girls were told to leave Long Beach High School on Wednesday after they showed up on Superhero Day costumed as the subject of the best-selling children's books. 
"I didn't know which superhero it was, not that it mattered," said Principal Nicholas Restivo. 
The girls depicted this superhero -who has bat-tied, among other things, talking toilets and the infa­mous Professor Poopypants -by wearing beige leo­tards and nude stockings under white briefs and red capes. 
"Yes, I know they weren't naked," Restivo said. "But the appearance was that they were naked." 
Woman wallops intruder with cooking pot 
MUNCIE, Ind. -A woman watching television in her nightgown raced from her bedroom and attacked a man with a cooking pot after he stole golf clubs from her porch, police said. 
Sabrena Davis said she first grabbed a knife after a neighbor yelled to tell her that a man had taken the clubs, but then decided to instead attack him with a 10-inch cooking pot. 
"I started beating him with it. He asked for it," she said. 
Davis' attack slowed Timothy A. Simison, 27, until police arrested him outside her home Tuesday morning shortly after she had whacked him in the head and shoulders with the pot.

Butterwick called the proj­ect "a meeting of the minds" between OIT and University Libraries staff, with talks between the two groups starting around a year ago during which both agreed "the current cluster was dated in appearance."

Nevertheless, Butterwick was positive about the proj­ect, describing it as a chance for the library staff and OIT to work together to provide students with valuable resources.

Ethiopian civilian protesters killed 
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -Ethiopia acknowledged Thursday that security forces killed 193 civilians protesting election fraud last year but insisted excessive force was not used. 
The figure -three times an earlier official toll-had been revealed last week by a sen­ior judge who accused the government of try­ing to cover up the findings. 
Mekonnen Disasa, the newly appointed head of the inquiry board, was the only mem­ber to appear before reporters Thursday. He refused to take questions after his presenta­tion, during which he said security forces used reasonable force to quell post election distur­bances. 

Iranian officials condemn bombing 
BUENOS AIHES, Argentina -An Iranian envoy said Thursday that Argentine prosecu­tors' accusations linking former high-level Iranian officials to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center were unfounded and an attempt to find a "scapegoat" for the attack. 

Mohsen Baharvand, Iran's charge d'affaires here, told The Assodated Press that his gov­ernment still vigorously condemns the bomb­ing that killed 85 and wounded 200 others, calling it a "horrible act." 
On Wednesday, two Argentine special prose­cutors asked a federal judge to order the arrest of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and seven others for the bombing. 
Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman said the decision to attack the center "was undertaken in 1993 by the highest authorities of the then­government of Iran." He also alleged that the actual attack was entrusted to the Lebanon­based group Hezbollah.

Rumsfeld: no demands for progress 
WASHINGTON-Defense Secretary Donald 

H. Rumsfeld said Thursday that anyone demanding deadlines for progress in Iraq should "just back ofl'." because it is too difficult to pre­dict when Iraqis will resume control of their country. 
During an often-combative Pentagon news conference, Rumsfeld said that while bench­marks for security, political and economic progress are valuable, "it's difficult. We're look­ing out into the future. No one can predict the future with absolute certainty." 
He said the goals have no specific deadlines or consequences if they are not met by specific dates. 
"You're looking for some sort of a guillotine to come falling down if some date isn't met," Rumsfeld told reporters. "That is not what this is about." 

Early Colorado blizzard hits hard

The storm began late Wednesday and turned highways wet and slushy across the state. At one point, snow was falling at a rate of about 3 inches an hour in Denver. A 125­mile corridor from Colorado Springs to the New Mexico line was under a blizzard warn­ing.

Catholic university, Notre Dame is committed to life and to offering students resources that support the choice of life. Therefore, the University will make every effort to provide pregnant students with caring, non-judgmental. professional assistance and support." 
The new Student Affairs Web site elaborates on duLac's explanation of University policy by providing a list of assistance programs on campus. The names and contact information for individuals in Campus Ministry, the Counse1ing Center and Health Services are avail­able on the site as resources for students -pregnant, or simply affected by pregnancy -to contact. 
The site features a Frequently Asked Questions page that, Firth said, "presents information in a more user­friendly way." "Where can I go to get a free pregnancy test?" is one question included on the FAQ page. The answer: Notre Dame Health Center or the Women's Care Center of South Bend. The page stresses confi­dentiality in all medical and counseling visits. 
The Web site names Firth as one of the University's three Pregnancy Support Advocates -a position that provides con­fidential information and coun­seling assistance to students. Assistant Vice Presidents for Student Affairs Sister Sue Dunn and Sister Jean Lenz are Notre Dame's other Support Advocates. 
Lenz, who served as Farley Hall's rector for 10 years, still lives in Farley and has long been a campus counseling resource for students facing unplanned pregnancy. 
"I have taken a pastoral role in trying to help an individual that is pregnant," she said. 
Lenz said throughout her time at Notre Dame, it has always been a priority of hers to ensure that pregnant stu­dents be provided proper med­ical care, counseling and sup­port. 
"That is why we are there ­to help in any way we can," she said. 
In addition individuals on University staff, Lenz said a number of students from Notre Dame Hight to Life played a large role in the creation of the Web site. 
"Students were critical to our discussion," she said. 
Members of the pregnancy resource sub-committee of the Right to Life Club compiled a 20-page proposal for the preg­nancy assistance Web site and presented the proposal to Student Affairs last spring, said sophomore Jessica Hagemann, the committee's commissioner. 
Hagemann said included in their proposal were examples of other Catholic colleges across the nation who provided pregnancy support Web sites to students. 
"We hoped it would persuade Notre Dame to create a similar site," she said. "Our reasoning was that Notre Dame, as a Catholic institution, needed to present our women with pro­life options on campus so that they wouldn't feel helpless and be pushed to other options."

ture bearing the name of his latest book: "The Working Poor: Invisible in America." 
"The first step is to see the problem, and the first prob­lem is the failure to see the people," Shipler said. "I'm talking about the guy who washes the cars but doesn't own them, and just stands on the edge of an affluent socie­ty." 
The cause of this phenome­non can be traced back to Benjamin Franklin's promise and the deeply embedded myth that in the U.S. dedica­tion and integrity will lead any man to prosperity, Shipler said. While this mentality can be a source of motivation, he said, it may also be detrimen­tal and biased against people who aren't able to succeed despite their efforts. 
Poverty, he said, is not merely the result of laziness or lack of enthusiasm among the lowest class. 
"Poverty behaves like an ecological system, where the fate of the individual depends on his interactions and his relationships with the commu­nity and the economic envi­ronment and other institu­tions," Shipler said. 
lie illustrated his explana­tion with the story of Lisa Brooks, a woman he encoun­tered when he was conducting his research. 
Brooks was a single mother earning the minimum wage who couldn't afford to make significant improvements to her house. 
As a result of the mold and dust bites in her home, her son became ill with asthma and was rushed to the hospi­tal a couple of times. 
Brooks' health insurance took care of the hospital bill but didn't cover the ambu­lance expenses. She was unable to pay them out of her pocket, and soon her credit record was stained. 
When she tried to take out a loan for a new car, she was rejected numerous times ­forcing her to buy a dubious used car within her immedi­ate budget. 
Shipler said that in many cases like Brooks', "Housing can actually contribute to malnutrition and illness." 
In fact, when families are pressed to make the obligato­ry rent, insurance and utilities payments, the only expenses that can be reduced and squeezed are those related to nutrition. 
"When the children aren't properly fed, you will begin to see learning problems devel­op," Shipler said.

GRAPE RD. 
While that may not be the path towards sustaining a competitive advantage in a global economy, Shipler said the country's business leaders were slow to see beyond next quarter's earnings and invest in the future of their work­force. 
The responsibility to make poverty history in the U.S., however, also falls on individ­ual citizens, Shipler said. 
He asked his audience how many people would be willing to pay slightly higher taxes if they were sure that money would really improve a public school or hospital. 
More than half of the people in the auditorium raised their hands. 
Shipler then asked how many of those people had informed their congressmen or their senators of their will­ingness. 
Just 10 people in the room raised their hands a second time. 
"Ladies and gentlemen," Shipler said, "this is a time and a situation that requires civil action." 
Junior Nate Serazin appre­ciated Shipler's take on the poverty issue. 
"So often we view poverty as being merely a problem of lack of wealth," he said. "It's nice to be reminded that poverty is so much more com­plicated than that ... it's a problem that requires a com­plicated solution -a team effort to address issues such as health care, education, and housing." 
$1.00 GAMES $1.00 SHOES VVear a costun1e and

A panel of three profession­als responded Shipler immedi­ately following his lecture. 
Jen nif'er Warlick, chair of the economics and policy studies department, praised Shipler's conclusion that the ingredients of poverty in North America are "part financial, part psychological, part societal, part personal, part past and part present." 
Dawn Chapla, a community service liaison from United Way, spoke about poverty in St. Joseph County. There are currently more than 2,000 grandparents acting as sole caregivers, putting children in vulnerable positions and unstable home environments. 
Chapla said the number of single mothers has also increased in the last decade, from 6.9 percent to 8.6 per­cent of the population. 
Joe Holt, director of the Executive Education Program in the Mendoza College of Business, commented on the relevance of Shipler's studies in light of "Economic Justice for All," a pastoral letter on Catholic social teaching and the U.S. economy prepared by 
U.S. bishops in 1986. 

The lecture, in recognition of the 20th anniversary of that letter, was sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns, the department of theology, the department of economics and policy studies, and the Masters in Nonprofit Administration.

IN BRIEF 
CEO'ssalary increases at time oflayoffs 
NEW YORK -As if Countrywide Financial Corp.'s CEO isn't getting paid enough, the mortgage lender's board is taking the unprecedented step of lavishing him with $10 million in retirement money. 
And he isn't even retiring. 

Countrywide is spinning it as a "reimburse­ment" because Angelo Mozilo agreed to stay on at the helm until 2009 instead of retiring this year as was expected. That will come on top of the hefty salary he will get to stay at work. 
The company released details of Mozilo's financial package on the same day it announced plans to lay off 2,500 Countrywide employees. Talk about tone-deaf timing. 
Mozilo has long drawn flak for his pay, which the Calabasas, Calif.-based company has defended as appropriate since under Mozilo's watch Countrywide has become the nation's largest mortgage lender. 
Dow closes with fourth straight record 
NEW YORK -Wall Street extended its rally Thursday as robust earnings at Exxon Mobil Corp. and Aetna Inc. helped ground investors as they tried to reconcile divergent economic data. 
The Dow Jones industrials, lifted in part by component Exxon Mobil, had their fourth con­secutive record high close. The generally upbeat earnings reports of the past two weeks have helped power the blue chips as well as the rest of the stock market; Thursday's batch of earnings also helped investors digest a pair of government reports that suggested an eco­nomic soft landing might be harder to achieve. 
The market was initially inspired by Commerce Department durable goods data that indicated capital spending jumped by the most in more than six years. But stocks then fell on a report from the department that new home prices plunged at its steepest pace since 1970. 
Investors were particularly wary after the Federal Heserve said Wednesday it remains concerned about inflation even as the econo­my is slowing. 
"Things on the horizon are becoming less and less visible," said IIugh Moore, a partner with portfolio manager Guerite Advisors. 



ExxonMobil earns record numbers 
Second-largest quarterly profit set by a publicly traded U.S. company 
Associated Press 

DALLAS -Oil industry behemoth Exxon Mobil Corp. said Thursday its third-quarter earnings rose to $10.49 billion, the second-largest quar­terly profit ever recorded by a publicly traded U.S. company. Its shares rose to a 52-week high. 
The report comes as high crude prices this year have fueled record profits in the oil industry, triggering an outcry from consumers who were being asked to pay about $3 a gallon for gasoline in early August. 
The largest quarterly profit ever was Exxon Mobil's $10.71 billion profit in the fourth quar­ter of 2005. 
They may beat that next quarter, said Howard Silverblatt Standard & Poor's Senior Index Analyst. "Then in all likelihood they will be at that $40 billion mark for the year." 
That would put the company on track for the highest annual profit ever by a U.S. company. Exxon Mobil holds that record with a 2005 profit of $36.1 billion.

Pigs may be source of spinach contamination 
E. coli outbreak causes sickness, 3 deaths 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Wild pigs may have spread deadly bac­teria onto a California spinach field, sparking an outbreak that killed three people and sickened more than 200 others nationwide, investigators said Thursday. They also said the outbreak appears to be over. 
No one has become ill from eating contaminated spinach since Sept. 25. "All evidence points to this outbreak having concluded," said Dr. Kevin Reilly of the California Department of Health Services. 
State and federal investiga­tors have narrowed their focus to the ranch, where boar trampled fences that had hemmed in a spinach field. 
Samples taken from a wild pig, as well as from stream water and cattle on the ranch, have tested positive for the same strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak, Reilly said. 
Still, investigators continue to look at three other ranches in the areas in see king the source of the contaminated fresh spinach. 
"We are not saying this is the source at this point," Reilly said of the ranch. 
The outbreak sickened 204 people in 26 states and one Canadian province, he said. 
Wild pigs are one "real clear vehicle" that could explain how E. coli spread 
from cattle on the ranch to 
the spinach field less than a 
mile away, Reilly said. The 
pigs could have tracked the 
bacteria into the field or 
spread it through their drop­
pings, he said. 

Investigators also are look­
ing at runoff, flooding, irriga­
tion water, fertilizer and 
other wildlife, including deer, 
as possible sources. 
Investigators first recovered the same strain of bacteria earlier this month from three cattle manure specimens col­lected on the ranch. On Thursday, Reilly said the strain had been isolated from six other samples collected on the ranch, including from cat­tle. 
The finds mark the first time that investigators have identified a possible source for any of the multiple E. coli outbreaks linked to the heavi­ly agricultural area. 
Reilly refused to give a location for the ranch, other than to say it's in a valley in the area of San Benito and Monterey counties. 
Investigators have taken roughly 750 samples from the four ranches. They've found generic E. coli on all four ranches -the bug is com­monly found in cattle -but turned up the particular strain involved in the out­break on only one. 
"We have no evidence to suggest people should not be eating spinach from other places -except from these four ranches," said Jack Guzewich, of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

Congress bans all abortions 
Women's groups rally against new measure 
Associated Press MANAGUA-Nicaragua's Congress voted Thursday to ban all abortions, including those that could save a mother's life. If signed into law by President Enrique Bolanos, the measure would eliminate a century-old exception to Nicaragua's abor­tion ban that permits the proce­dure if three doctors certify that the woman's health is at risk. Fifty-two lawmakers voted for the measure. Nine lawmakers abstained and 29 others did not attend the legislative session. Bolanos has proposed increasing prison sentences for illegal abortions -currently around six years -to 10 to 30 years for women who have the procedure as well as those who assist them. But it was unclear whether he would sign the bill approved 
Thursday after lawmakers decided not to increase the penalties in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. 
The bill has drawn protests from women's rights groups, and the Women's Autonomous Movement has said it was pre­pared to seek an injunction to block the measure if it passed. 
Congress approved the bill despite a letter from European Union diplomats and U.N. rep­resentatives asking lawmakers to hold off on voting on the issue until after the Nov. 5 presiden­tial elections. 
U.N. official Rebeca Grynspan, who is in Nicaragua this week, told reporters, "It's very difficult that this (be determined) during an electoral period." 
Nicaragua's medical associa­tion also urged legislators to postpone the vote, saying the issue had become politicized. 
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, who was a supporter of abortion rights as a young revo­lutionary, has said he has become a devout Roman Catholic and now opposes abor­tion. 
Ortega's socialist government of the 1980s had a contentious relationship with the Catholic church, but Ortega recently has established warm ties with 
leading  church  figures  in  
Nicaragua.  
Congressman  Wilfredo  

Navarro, of the ruling Liberal Constitutionalist Party, said the exception to Nicaragua's ban had allowed for cases in which healthy women who did not want to have their babies had convinced doctors to say an abortion was needed for health reasons. 
Aside from Cuba, which per­mits abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, Latin America has some of the world's most restrictive anti­abortion laws. 
El Salvador and Chile also ban all types of abortions.

help people live healthier lifestyles, which in turn, could slow soaring health care costs. 
"Obesity is an epidemic, and chronic disease inevitably fol­lows. It has become a major quiet killer," said Mike Leavitt, the health and human services secretary. 
More than half of adults in the United States do not get enough of the kind of physical activity that actually benefits them. One-quarter are not active at all in their leisure time. Overall, more than 60 million adults are obese, Leavitt said. 
The lack of exercise con­tributes to the $2 trillion that people spend on health care in this country, Leavitt said. About three-quarters of that amount goes toward the treat­ment of chronic disease. 

Every five years. the govern­ment updates dietary guide­lines that are designed to telJ people what they should eat and how they should prepare food to keep it safe and wholesome. The food pyramid is a separate document, put out by the Agriculture Department and based on those dietary guidelines. 
Leavitt said the government has a compelling national interest in promoting healthy choices. But he made it clear that the steps he envisions are less forceful than others might consider necessary. For instance, New York City is considering strict limits on artificial trans fats in restau­rant meals.

Research emphasis essential 
For many high school seniors, there isn't a better choice than Notre Dame. The University boasts solid academic programs and impressive athletic teams -and it has that Catholic identity no other U.S. college is able to truly match. 
While the University may attract the nation's top undergradu­ates, it lags far -sometimes stunningly far -behind its peers in Ph.D. programs and research, Provost Thomas Burish told faculty members earlier this week. 
His frankness was unusual at a school that all too often tends to sugarcoat its problems. But if Notre Dame focuses its resources on research, it won't be a O t.The

for life after college. If Burish is successful in his push for stronger Ph.D. programs, the University will send even more students out ready to be that powerful force for good, armed with an extra few years of Notre Dame education under their belts. 
It's going to take a lot of money. It's going to take a group effort. And it's going to take time -but as Burish was correct to emphasize, it's got to happen now. Notre Dame doesn't want to become Harvard or Stanford -something University officials are quick to articulate. Right now, however, its best graduates are doing research at Harvard 
Notre Dame undergraduates are some of the most desirable graduate school applicants in the country. Why not keep them here? 
University founder Father Edward Sorin said Notre Dame would one day be a "powerful force for good in this country." Right now, University graduates are all over the country -and the world -running companies, curing diseases and serving others. And one of the main reasons graduates are so successful is their strong undergraduate background. 
To a certain extent, undergraduate education trains students 
important to not overemphasize research to the point where it undermines undergraduate student life. Burish acknowledged that issue, and it's a danger that should always be kept in mind. 
Change can chip away at an institution's identity, or it can build upon it. The financial resources needed for this project ­which will undoubtedly be hefty -must be raised by Notre Dame, not diverted from its current programs and departments. 
If all goes according to Burish's plan, those Stanford under­graduates will someday pin their hopes on a Notre Dame Ph.D.

U.S. neglects students as lenders make a killing 
The indignities ofstudent life take on a certain glamour after a while -call it poverty chic. But it's not just for undergrad­
uates anymore. Staff Editorial Chances are, you'll be living that way for a University of long, long time. Florida Since 2001, tuition at Independent public universities has Florida shot up by 35 percent, Alligator more than three times the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, the aver­age family's income has fallen. So has fund­ing for Pell Grants and other forms of stu­dent aid. As college costs more and more, 
Americans are making less and less -but somehow, enrollment keeps rising. What's the catch? 
Debt, naturally. Students are borrowing like never before-in fact, we're borrow­ing more than universities and the federal government can spare. That's why private education lenders, which didn't even exist when our parents went to college, now pro­vide about 20 percent of all student loans. That's bad news. 
Banks charge higher interest than the people in Criser Hall, of course -some­times as much as 19 percent. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Unlike nonprofit lenders, they also turn away students with bad credit. And forget about consolidating your debt after graduation -private loans aren't eligible for that. 

Unfortunately, some students can't pay for school without turning to predatory lenders for help. Politicians from both par­ties talk a good game about "valuing edu­cation" and "investing in the future"-but instead of removing the limits on federal Stafford Student Loans, for example, they sit back and watch as their constituents sell themselves into bondage. Thanks, guys. 
With congressional elections in less than two weeks, you'll be hearing about plenty of domestic issues: gay marriage, property taxes, insurance -and did we mention gay marriage? But it seems student debt isn't high on anyone's list of priorities. Keep that in mind on Nov. 8, when the lectures about poor turnout among young people start.

that have been talked

about in this cam­paign are important, like the depth of the Mark Foley page scandal or the off­color comments by a Senatorial candi­date in Virginia. Ultimately though, "this too shall pass." Many topics that are discussed today are transient issues that will soon be forgotten. 
On the horizon of the next two to six years, though, lie several hurdles that will define the way America views its two chief parties. One of those hurdles, the federal deficit, looks more like an elephant. In President Bush's remaining time in office and during the next President's first term, leaders, future leaders and the American electorate must define their beliefs on this impor­tant topic. 
Conventional wisdom, since the big government era of Roosevelt's New Deal, has been Democrats like big gov­ernment and Republicans prefer small government. If the last two presidencies are any indication of the current status of the two parties' manifestos, conven­tional wisdom has been thrown out the door. Democratic President Clinton boldly declared, "The era of big govern­ment is over." For eight years it appeared his analysis was correct. A Republican Congress and a moderate Democrat seemed to come to a common ground founded on the belief that a low deficit could help America be more competitive abroad and more produc­tive at home. 
That belief was accurate. Lower deficits meant America did not have to rely on foreign governments, such as China and Japan, to buy treasury bonds to finance its debt. It meant the children of America had a more secure future. It meant our dollar was strong; therefore, America's citizenry could travel abroad easily and experience the world. It  meant interest rates were low; people felt free to spend and invest their money. It meant mortgage rates were low; people could buy their own home. When citizens purchase freely they buy rugs, furniture, televisions, stereos, refrigerators and any other accou­trements that accompany a home. The 

door of owning one's own home was 
opened to a new portion of Americans. 
Greater access to success fulfilled John Locke's notion that one is intrinsi­cally tied to one's democracy and is interested in its prosperity when one owns property. The middle class grew and America's economy was strong. By the end of the Clinton administration, America had seen three consecutive budget surpluses and experienced the longest sustained growth in American history. The biggest issue of the 2000 campaign season was how to spend the $237 billion available in extra revenue. In the words of a friend of mine, "it appears the tables have rolled." Under a Republican President and Congress, America's youth must confront the real­ity that our country is buried under $8.5 trillion in debt. Fiscal year 2006 saw a budget deficit of $247.7 billion, and the Republican President called it a victory. A victory? 
As a Republican I would not argue that the Democratic Party now stands for fiscal conservatism and the Republican Party for increased spend­ing. The reality is neither party is will­ing to accept what works-fiscal con­servatism. The notion of "bringing home the pork" by spending grand amounts of money on a politician's constituency is too enticing. Democratic leaders have forgotten their lessons learned during the Clinton years and Republican lead­ers have forgotten their values that pro­pelled them to success in 1994. 
I am angry that my party has aban­doned one of its most important beliefs. I am angry that a Republican president will not express distress or veto budgets that endanger my future. Over the next six years the burden of proof lies with Republican leaders. Will we see a return to fiscally responsible govern­ment? If so, they must lead the way as they did in winning the Congress in 1994. If not, the party that currently dominates Ameriean government (rep­resented, ironically, by the symbol of the elephant) will lose its idealism and a large part of its following. 
I am angry that this elephant of fiscal irresponsibility is in the room.

Memorable moment: The first appearance of Leatherface, one ofthe screen's greatest villains. 
A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984, Wes Craven) 
Created after the success of both "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th," "A Nightmare on Elm Street" quickly developed into one of the most suc­cessful horror franchises, spawning not only numerous sequels but a television show as well. Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is the star of the show as the child molester who was burned to death by the parent~ of the children he attacked. He comes back to the nightmares of those related to his killers, vowing to kill them in their sleep. 
Unlike the slashers who came before him, Freddy is scary and funny at the same time, having plenty of actual dialogue and banter with the other characters. His burned and mutilated face and long knives where fmgers should be create one of the perennial images of horror. Also noteworthy is a young Johnny Depp starring in his first feature film. 
Memorable moment: "One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better lock your door. Five, six, grab your crucifiX. Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. Nine, ten, never sleep again." 

THE SUPERNATURAL MOVIE 
Rosemary's Baby (1968, Roman Polanski) 
A disturbing and affecting examination of late 1960s paranoia, "Rosemary's Baby" was adapted by Ira Levin's bestseller: The story of-the pregnant Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia FarroW) and her actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes), "Rosemary's Baby" is a film about the occult, as Rosemary begins to learn the satanic truth about her titular child-to-be. 
Memorable moment: Rosemary's disturbing, hal­lucinogenic dream sequence. 
The Exorcist (1973 William Friedkin) 
Easily one of the most famous horror films of all time, William Friedkin's 1973 classic about priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) and his run-in with a demon possessing the child Regan (Linda Blair). Featuring some fantastic performances by Ellen Burstyn as Regan's mother and Max Van Sydow as the exorcist, Father Merrin. "The Exorcist" is still a shocking and scary film, despite being over 30 years old. 
Memorable moment: "The power of Olrist com­pels you!" 
Carrie (1976, Brian DePalma) 
Based on Stephen King's first novel, "Carrie" fol­lows the eponymous character (Sissy Spacek), a shy and repressed teen whose supernatural pow­ers come to vengeful fruition during the iconic high school prom. As much a film critiquing the social class system as it is about the scares themselves, "Carrie" remains equally effective for its portrayal of high school politics and religious guilt. Also noteworthy is a young and poorly-acting John Travolta. 
Memorable moment: The epic shower of pig's blood during the prom's fa.t.eful final moments.

IES FROM -,\ TO Z 
D ERIN MCGINN 
The Evil Dead Trilogy {1983 -1992, Sam Raimi) 
The frrst "Evil Dead" movie was a low-budget 
cult classic about five teens who accidentally 
unlock an evil spirit deep in the woods. By "Army 
of Darkness," the third film in the series, it had 
become a joking, stylish homage to, and parody of, 
the classic zombie movie. "Evil Dead" was effective 
because of its simplicity -Raimi depends on the 
camera and the paranoia of the atmosphere, 
which drove the series throughout its three-film 
run. 
Memorable moment: the flying eyeball in "Evil 
Dead 2." 
THE CLASSIC MOVIE 
Psycho (1960, Alfred Hitchcock) 
Among Hitchcock's most famous film, "Psycho" is responsible for one of Hitchcock's most famous creations, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) of the Bates Motel. "Psycho" set new standards in horror, as it pushed the boundaries of what was accept­able in 1960. With its Oedipal overtones and Perkins' genuinely scary portrayal, "Psycho" remains the gold standard in modern psychologi­cal horror. 
Memorable moment: the shower scene, perhaps the most famous sequence in Hitchcock's storied career. 
Nosferatu (1922, F.W. Murnau) When "Dracula" was frrst put on sale for movie right'i, one of the first men to pursue the text was 
F.W. Murnau. Although he failed to get the rights, Murnau had already started production on the film. To get around the rights issue, they cut out the name Dracula and replaced it with Count Orlok, or Nosferatu (the vampire). What separates "Nosferatu" from others of its time is that most of the film was shot on location in Eastern Europe ­the production hardly used any studio set.:;. It is dif­ficult to find any surviving original copies because when the film was released, Florence Stoker (widow of Bram} pursued the rights case relent­lessly and in July 1925 a German court ordered all prinl'i of the film to be destroyed. 
Memorable moment: Nosferatu's first appear­ance on screen. 
Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) 
An obsessed scientist creates a living being from parts of exhumed corpses. No longer so much a movie as it is a genuine part of popular folklore, the film itself shows its age, particularly in the absence of a musical score. But the performances by Colin Clive and particularly the great Boris Karloff as the Monster are the whole show here, forgiving a multitude of creaks and groans and more than compensating for any' lulls in the narra­tive. 
Memorable moment: When Dr. Frankenstein yells, "It's alive!" 
Dracula (1931, Todd Browning) 
Before Bela Lugosi wa-; relegated to starring in role. While this version of "Dracula" is far being the most definitive version of Stoker famous novel, it is quite possibly the most memo­rable one -due in large part to the presence Bela Lugosi. Born in what is now Romania, Lugosi brings to the character the flavor of his homeland, making him more believable than any of his prede­cessors. His performance alone is reason to watch this monster movie classic. 
Memorable moment: Lugosi's deliverance of uv _ infamous line, "I am Dracula." 
THE HALLOWEEN-ORIENTED .....,.... 
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) 
Thi-; Tim Burton-written classic tells the story Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, Danny Elfman), the pumpkin king of Halloween Town who is bored with doing the same thing each year for Halloween. One day he stumbles into Town, and is so taken with the idea of Christmas that he tries to get the resident bats, ghouls and goblins of Halloween Town to help him put n.~._._...,. Christmas instead of Halloween. In typical Tim Burton fashion, they just can't seem to get it right, putting their own creepy spin on the beloved holi­day.

Sloppy defense allows Cardinals to slip by Tigers 5-4 

St. Louis pulls within zvin of championship 
Associated Press 

ST. LOUIS -With some help from a soggy field and two big hits by little David Eckstein, the St. Louis Cardinals took control of the World Series with a wild comeback win. 
Eckstein's tiebreaking double glanced off the glove of a diving Craig Monroe in left field in the eighth inning, and the Cardinals capitalized on Detroit's sloppy defense for a S-4 victory Thursday night in Game 4. 
"lie's the toughest guy I've ever seen in a uniform," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said, praising his scrappy short­stop. 
After Curtis Granderson slipped in center field on a key play trying for an earlier ball hit by Eckstein, rekindling memo­ries of Curt Flood in the 1968 Series between these teams, St. Louis took a 3-1 lead to move within one win of its first cham­pionship in 24 years. 
Jeff Weaver can wrap it up Friday night at Busch Stadium when he pitches against rookie Justin Verlander. Each lost his first start in this Series. 
"The fans here are unbeliev­able. They come out every single night supporting us and it would be a real honor to do something for them," Eckstein said. 
One word of caution, Cardinals rooters: St. Louis had a 3-1 lead in '68, too, before Detroit rallied to win behind lefty Mickey Lolich. 
The decisive hit that time came when Flood, a Gold Glove center fielder, slipped on Jim Northrup's two-out, two-run triple off Cardinals ace Bob Gibson to break a scoreless tie in the seventh inning of Game 7 ­right across the street, where the old Busch Stadium stood. 
This time, the 5-foot-7 Eckstein hit three doubles and a single as St. Louis overcame an early 3-0 deficit to close in on its 1Oth World Series title. The last team to squander a 3-1 Series lead, however, was the 1985 Cardinals against Kansas City. 
After a rainout Wednesday night, only the second World Series washout in 20 years, showers were expected again Thursday. But the heavy stuff stayed away on a 53-degree night and much of the back-and­forth game was played in a light mist that obscured the Gateway Arch beyond center field. 
The mist got heavier in the sixth, however, and the Tigers began to struggle with the ele­ments. 
With St. Louis trailing 3-2 in the seventh, Eckstein hit a drive to right-center that Granderson appeared to have in his sights before he slipped to the slick turf, kicking up a huge divot. The ball fell for an easy double. 
"If I had stayed up, I catch it easily," Granderson said. "It wasn't too much of a cut. As soon as I planted, it went under­neath me., 
"It wasn't just wet," he added. "It was wet and soft." 
Pinch-hitter So Taguchi dropped down a sacrifice bunt, and reliever Fernando Rodney rushed an off-balance throw over the head of Placido Polanco covering at first base, allowing Eckstein to score the tying run. 
It was the fourth error by a Tigers pitcher in four games, a record for one pitching staff in the World Series. 
"Obviously, it was a little bit of a freak inning," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "It's not our best fielding in the world, but that's baseball." 
After an intentional walk to Albert Pujols and two strikeouts, Preston Wilson singled to left against Rodney to give St. Louis a 4-3 lead. 
But Ivan Rodriguez opened the eighth with a double and Brandon Inge tied it with a dou­ble off rookie closer Adam Wainwright, who avoided fur­ther damage by striking out pinch-hitter Alexis Gomez and Granderson. 

That set the stage for St. Louis' final rally. Yadier Molina drew a leadoff walk from Joel Zumaya before Aaron Miles beat out a potential double-play ball. 
Miles moved up when strike three to Juan Encarnacion got past Rodriguez for a wild pitch, and Eckstein hit a drive to left­center. 
Monroe sprinted to his left and laid out with a desperate dive, but the ball ticked ofl' the tip of his glove. The left fielder lay prone on the grass as Miles scored the go-ahead run. 
"Facing Zumaya, you want to make sure you don't try to over­swing," Eckstein said. "I got a fastball and was able to get on top just enough, just barely out of the reach of Craig Monroe, who almost made one heck of a catch." 
Wainwright set down Detroit in order in the ninth to the delight of the red-clad crowd. 
With NL championship series MVP Jeff Suppan on the mound for St. Louis, one sign read: Cold Night. Hot Supp. 
Suppan allowed three runs in six innings. 
The right-hander, sporting his full, dark beard, was quite a contrast to the boyish-looking Jeremy Bonderman, who made his Series debut for Detroit only two days shy of his 24th birth­day. 
Making his first start in 12 days, Bonderman was staked to a three-run lead and was visibly steamed when he was pulled after 5 1-3 innings with the score 3-2. He slammed his glove and hat on the bench, knocking over a full cup, and kicked the ground. 

But Rodney preserved the lead -for one inning, at least ­when he struck out Miles and pinch-hitter .John Rodriguez with runners at the corners. 
Hodney whiffed Rodriguez with a 97 mph fastball as catch­er Ivan Rodriguez popped out of his crouch and pumped his fist. 
In the second, Sean Casey golfed a 1-0 pitch into the Cardinals' bullpen in right field for his first career postseason home run. It also was the first homer off Suppan this postsea­son. Rodriguez then grounded a single to right, ending an 0-for­23 slump since Game 1 of the ALCS. 
Granderson doubled to start the third, his first hit in 15 World Series at-bats, and scored on Casey's two-out single. Rodriguez followed with an RBI single, making it 3-0. 
But La Russa stayed aggres­sive, calling for a hit-and-run with Suppan batting in the third. Suppan swung through a strike, but Miles stole second against Hodriguez, an 11-time Gold Glove winner who led major league catchers by throwing out 46 percent of attempted bases­tealers this season.

Associated Press Former German nation­al team coach Juergen Klinsmann is engaged in informal talks with the 
U.S. Soccer Federation that could lead to him taking over as coach of the American national team. 
Klinsmann, who coached his native Germany to a surprising berth in the World Cup semifinals this summer, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday that he's been speaking with USSF pres­ident Sunil Gulati. 
"We've had a couple of conversations. I'm evalu­ating everything that comes up," Klinsmann said. "I'll stay in touch with Sunil and see what it leads to. It's a very casual and relaxed correspon­dence." 

Klinsmann resigned as Germany's coach three days after the tourna­ment, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. He lives in suburban Los Angeles with his American-born wife and is regarded by many as the favorite to replace Bruce Arena, who was told by Gulati in mid-July that his contract would not be renewed. 
"Sooner or later, I have to get back into coach­ing," Klinsmann said. 
Gulati, who has refused to comment on his talks with any potential replacement, repeated Thursday that he hopes to have a new coach in place by the ·end of the year. 
Klinsmann is a close friend of Arena's and attended some U.S. team practices when the play­ers worked out in California. He said there isn't any timetable on his talks with Gulati. 
"Obviously, those are discussions that will con­tinue, and we'll see where they lead," he said. 
In announcing Arena's departure, Gulati said his successor should have "some knowledge of American soccer, experi­ence, leadership, a track record of success." 
"Does Juergen Klinsmann have those qualities? He probably does," Gulati said then. "He's had success with the German team; he has a much better handle on American soccer scene than someone who hasn't spent time here; he's inquisitive. He's an intel­ligent guy, multilingual with a lot of very positive qualities." 
IN BRIEF 
Cowboys assistant to sue McDonalds over dead rat DALLAS -Dallas Cowboys assis­tant coach Todd Haley is suing a sub­urban McDonald's, claiming his wife and the family's live in baby sitter found a dead rat in their salad. The lawsuit filed Thursday in state district court seeks $1.7 million in damages, The Dallas Morning News reported on its Web site. In addition to Haley, the Cowboys' passing game coordinator who got in a well-publicized shouting match with Terrell Owens earlier this month, the suit was also filed on behalf of his wife Christine and the family's au pair, Kathryn Kelley. A message left for McDonald's Corp. spokesman Walt Riker on Thursday evening was not immedi­ately returned According to the lawsuit, Christine Haley and Kelley had eaten part of the salad purchased June 5 at a McDonald's in Southlake before the 

dead rodent was uncovered. 
Sheffield upset over Yanks decision to exercise option 
NEW YORK -Gary Sheffield is angry that the New York Yankees plan to exercise his $13 million option for next season rather than allow him to become a free agent. 
While the Yankees have until Nov. 5 to decide on the option, Sheffield told USA Today that he has been told it will be exercised. 
"This will not work, this will not work at all," he was quoted as saying in Thursday editions. "I don't want to play first base a year for them. I will not do that." 
If the Yankees exercise the option, included as part of the three-year contract Sheffield negotiated before the 2004 season, they likely would trade him. By exercising the option, they can prevent him from winding up with the Boston Red Sox. 
Sheffield was New York's right 
fielder before he was sidelined from May 29 to Sept. 22 with an injured left wrist that required surgery. When he returned, he played first base for the first time in his major league career. 
Miami receiver to receive felony charge for altercation CORAL GABLES-Miami receiv­er Ryan Moore is expected to face a felony charge for his role in an August altercation with two women, and will not accompany the Hurricanes to Georgia Tech for their game Saturday. The felony charge is not why Moore isn't traveling to Atlanta on Friday, Miami coach Larry Coker said. "I probably know a lot more about it than you do right now and I won't go into that," Coker said. "But I will say that he will not travel."

Virginia Tech handles Clemson 
Branden Ore rushes for 203 yards to lead Hokies over Tigers 
Associated Press 
BLACKSBURG -Branden Ore shredded Clemson for 203 yards rushing yards and two touchdowns and Virginia Tech held the No. 10 Tigers to 76 yards in the last three quar­ters in the Hokies' 24-7 victory Thursday night. 
Virginia Tech (6-2, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference}, beaten soundly in its last two ACC games by Georgia Tech and Boston College, showed the Tigers what it felt like. 
Clemson (7 -2, 4-2} had just three first downs in the last three quarters, and the third one came in the final minute, not long before the final gun sounded and Hokies fans streamed onto the field, sur­rounding the team and cele­brating around midfield. 
Ore carried a career-high 37 times for his second consecu­tive 200-yard performance. He had 207 five days earlier in a rout. of Southern Mississippi, and this time upstaged the Tigers' vaunted two-back tan­dem of James Davis and C.J. Spiller. They came into the 
game averaging 185 yards 
between them, but finished 
with just 71 yards on 22 tries. 
The Hokies, leading 10-7 at 
halftime, padded their lead 
early in the third quarter after 
Xavier Adibi intercepted Will 
Proctor's pass at the Clemson 
35. Ore did the rest, carrying on five consecutive plays, the last an 11-yard, second-effort run for the TO. 
Later in the period, he essentially put the game away, breaking off a 21-yard run to get the ball inside the Clemson 5, then carrying two more times to get it to 24-7. Sam Wheeler also had a big play in the drive, a 41-yard reception from Sean Glennon. 
Glennon came in expecting to yield to Ike Whitaker at times to boost the running game, but it never happened. Glennon finished 9-for-15 for 108 yards and ran for a TD. 
The Hokies dominated the second quarter on defense and led 10-7 at halftime. 
Clemson ran just 12 plays _ for 21 yards _ in the quarter as Virginia Tech kept the ball for nearly 10 minutes. 
Brandon Pace's 37-yard field 
goal with 11:36 left in the half 
made it 10-7 and was his 14th 
consecutive successful field 
goal. 

Clemson was in great posi­
tion to at least tie it when C.J. 
Gaddis stripped the ball from 
a scrambling Glennon and 
Gaines Adams recovered for 
the Tigers on the Tech 25. 
Three plays later, however, Proctor never got the handle on the third-and-9 snap and Hokies defensive end Barry Booker jumped on the loose ball to end the threat. 
The teams were like mirror images in the first quarter. 
Both started with three-and­outs, and then the Tigers drove 77 yards in 11 plays to Davis' 17th rushing touch­down of the season, a 6-yard burst around the left side. 
The Hokies countered by driving 84 yards in 12 plays, highlighted by Glennon's 2­yard sneak on fourth-and-1 from the Hokies 36, and Ore's 40-yard burst through the right side to the 6-inch line. Two plays later, Glennon dove it in.

Belles play Bulldogs in final MIAA match 
By SARAH LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will have the opportunity to knock off MIAA No. 3 Adrian College at home Saturday in the final game of the regular season. 
Coming off a big win against MIAA foe Tri-State Tuesday, the Belles (16-8, 9-6 MIAA) will play their fmal match before the MIAA tournament. Adrian holds a 16-8 overall record and 11-4 mark in the conference ­
Saint Mary's 16-8 record overall is tied with Adrian's, but SMC is now fifth in the MIAA. 
Coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said that she believes in her team, but she knows the Belles will encounter problems if they don't improve their fundamentals. 
"We will be working on our net game a lot these next two days ­blocking, attacking, as well as coverage," she said. "Adrian has 
a very strong offense. We need to 
be ready to stop them at the net. 
"Our floor defense has been strong all season so, of course, we need to maintain that as one of our strengths. Our front line is going to have really rise to the challenge." 
Schroeder-Biek will be looking to her seniors to lead their team to a fmal regular season victory. 
"Our seniors have done a nice job on the court all year," she said. "They have also been great leaders both on and off the court." 
The Belles coach is very happy with how the season played, and is proud ofher team. 
"We have had a nice balance of players this season," she said. "If one player is having a rough game, someone else picks it up. That ha'j been a huge reason for our success this year. 
"We are not dependent on one player to carry the team."

Broncos defense to take on high-octane Colts offense 
Manning and undefeated Indianapolis travel to Mile-High City to face league's stingiest defense in key AFC matchup 
DENVER -A blizzard cov­ered the Mile High City during the week, so maybe it's not too early in the NFL season to start talking about really significant games. 
And Indianapolis at Denver is about as colossal as an October game can get. 
"I love a game like this because it doesn't get any big­ger," Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker said. "It reminds me of back in college with Florida State getting ready for Florida or Miami. It's a big game. It's going to be magni­fied. People are talking about it." 
Despite some flaws on one 
side or the other, the Colts (6-0) and Broncos (5-1) are so good 
at  what  they  do  well  that  
they're  harkening  to  the  
league's  formative  days  of  

leather helmets and two-way players. 
The Colts can become the first team to start 7-0 in consecutive seasons since the 1929-31 Green Bay Packers, who did it three straight years. No one else has done it twice. 
The Broncos have already made history, becoming the stingiest team to start a season since the 1934 Detroit Lions shut out their first seven oppo­nents. 
Denver has allowed just two oh-by-the-way touchdowns this season, both coming in the fourth quarter after they had built 17-0 leC~ds on New England and Cleveland. They've held their last five opponents to single digits, a franchise best. 
Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer, the biggest benefici­ary of Denver's stifling defense, which has taken some heat off his season-long poor play, said this one feels like a playoff game. 
"Any time you have an unde­feated team coming to your place and we're 5-1, it's a big game," Plummer said. "(Winning it) sends a statement. It doesn't mean you're going to win the Super Bowl by any means, but it just sends a state­ment to everybody that you can beat the good ones, too." 
Plummer's job got harder this week when left tackle Matt Lepsis was lost for the season with a knee injury, leaving Adam Meadows, Erik Pears or right guard Cooper Carlisle as candidates to face Colts star defensive end Dwight Freeney. 
The Colts have their own injury issues, with defensive tackle Montae Reagor (eye socket) missing his second straight game and safety Mike Doss being placed on injured reserve with a torn knee liga­ment. The Colts expect to have

"We believe we can score on anybody, and I'm sure they like to believe they can stop any­one," Colts coach Tony Dungy said. "Everybody's going to focus on that matchup, but spe­cial teams, our defense against their offense is going to be just as critical." 
What everyone really wants to see, however, is Indy's prolific offense going against Denver's dominant defense. Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Dallas Clark vs. Al Wilson, Champ Bailey, Darrent Williams, John Lynch and Ian Gold. 
"They are just playing excel­lent fundamental defense right now," said Manning, who spends most of his waking hours dissecting defenses and has found few flaws to exploit in this one. "Their tackling is exceptional. That's one thing that just jumps out at you." 
In many ways, the Broncos have the Colts to thank for their defensive dominance, the seeds of which were planted following the 2003 and '04 postseasons when Indianapolis spanked the Broncos by a combined 56-point margin.

E a g l e Invitational, Gray took fourth indi­vidually and the team took fourth overall. 
"The team looked stronger than most other teams during the second half of the race and ran well together," Belles coach Jackie Bauters said of the Manchester Invitational. 
In preparation for the MIAA meet, many of the team mem­bers stayed around campus for fall break. 
"(It] benefited the team and allowed them to stay more in the flow of the season, rather than being totally out of sync a Todd Heap said after seeing McNair practice this week. "You couldn't tell anything about any concussion.... It was basically like the normal Steve out there." 
It also gave Billick more time to take over the offense after he fired offensive coordinator Jim Fassel. Billick will call the plays for the first time this season in a stadium where crowd noise has disrupted visiting teams. 
"This will be like nothing they have ever heard," Billick said of his players. "I have been in that building when it has been cranked.... The noise doesn't go anywhere. It is as hard a dome to play in as there is." 
But recent history shows Baltimore has done well com­ing off a week's rest, having won the next game after a bye four seasons running. 
Past trends matter little to the Saints, who seem to have entered a new era under rookie coach Sean Payton. But Payton does have memories of facing the Ravens, and they aren't good. 
He was the Giants' offensive coordinator in Super Bowl 35, when the Ravens shut down the Giants in a 34-7 romp. 
"That's a bad horror movie for me," Payton recalled. 
These Ravens, like that Super Bowl team, are known for defense, led once again by line­backer Ray Lewis, who has a team-high 39 tackles and has assisted on 11 more. 
The Baltimore defense is allowing only 11.5 points per game, the third-lowest average in the league. The Ravens have 19 sacks, most of them by line­backers executing a confusing array of blitzes from a 3-4 defense. 
They may present the tough­est challenge of the season for New Orleans' revamped offen­sive line, which has new starters at every position from last season, including rookie guard Jahri Evans and right tackle Jon Stinchcomb, who never started before this year. 
"This defense challenges you before the ball is even snapped, just recognizing your assign­ment," Stinchcomb said. "We've seen a lot of film where there's been some confusion on the offensive line. Second, they've got a great group of athletes. So, one is recognizing who you've got to block, and two is getting the job done, which is not an easy task." 
So far, the Saints' new line has allowed only six sacks, even shutting out a Philadelphia defense that had 23 coming into the Superdome two weeks ago. 
Quarterback Drew Brees has taken some pressure off by throwing quickly and accurate­ly to receivers Joe Horn and Marques Colston, as well as running back Reggie Bush, who catches the ball coming out of the backfield or lining up as a receiver. The Saints also expected receiver Devery Henderson, who missed the last three games with a shoulder injury, to be back this weekend. 
Meanwhile, Deuce McAllister has averaged 4.9 yards a carry, the only question with him being how well he has recov­ered from a minor hamstring injury against Philadelphia. 
Bauters is 
optimistic about 

the conference meet this time around. 
"This season has been won­derful thus far, and I believe the team is ready for a great race this Saturday," she said. 
The main competition for the Belles will be last year's MIAA champion Calvin College, Hope and Albion. But the most important thing is, Gray said, "for everyone to just go out there and have fun, run their race and enjoy it."

That history is compounded with Notre Dame's success this year, knocking off higher ranked opponents in each of its last two races -the Notre Dame Invitational and the Pre­National Tournament.

NFL 
Barber brothers to face each other for last time ­
Tampa tries to continue two game win streak 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD -A lit­
tle less than two months after 
kicking off the season with the 
Manning Bowl, the New York 
Giants have another brotherly 
matchup: the Barber Bowl. 
Unlike the opener that pitted Peyton and Eli Manning in the first NFL game featuring broth­ers as the starting quarter­backs, Ronde and Tiki Barber will be meeting for the fifth time as pros when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers {2-4) and Giants (4-2) play Sunday at Giants Stadium. 
While not as hyped as the Manning matchup, this game is just as special because it might be the last time the twins run into each other -literally. 
Barring a change of heart, Tiki plans to retire after this season to pursue a television career. 
"It's pretty set," the Giants halfback said. "It is set. I have tons of other things that I am interested in and eager and excited to get to doing. Obviously, the last 10 games of the season are first on that list. But, beyond and the rest of my life, there's a lot." 
Ronde isn't surprised, but the Bucs cornerback refused to write off his brother entirely for the 2007 season. 
"I think he's had a feeling for a vear now, at least, and I saw it: to tell you the truth, in the offseason when we were work­ing out," said Ronde, who hopes to play for another five years. "He just wasn't the same. The passion to get up and get ready wasn't the same." 
Luckily for the Giants, Tiki hasn't lost his passion for the regular season. In fact, the twins are both having spectac­ular seasons. 
Tiki leads the NFL in rushing with 647 yards, and is a major reason the Giants have turned around their season with three straight wins. 
Ronde had a career game last Sunday, returning two inter­ceptions for touchdowns in an improbable 23-21 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, a win 
nailed down on a 62-yard field 
goal by former Giant Matt 
Bryant as time expired. 
During one of their telephone 
conversations this week, Ronde 
didn't hesitate to let Tiki know 
his two touchdowns are two 
more than Tiki has this season. 
"My brother and I have always been competitive, and we've rarely done the same things," Tiki said. "For instance, in track he was a hur­dler, and I was a long jumper. Football, he played defense, and I played offense. But we always competed against each other's successes. 
"For instance, when he would win, I would say, 'There's no way I'm not winning," Tiki added. ''I'm not going home without something if he won.' And I think that's driven us all the way through, even now into the National Football League." 
As much as they compete personally against each other, the Barbers played on the same teams from their days in Pop Warner football through the University of Virginia. The only times they weren't on the same teams were in neighborhood pickup games. 
"If we were on opposite teams, we hated each other," said Ronde, who also leads the Bucs in tackles. "We both want­ed to win so fervently. I think that's probably the only time I've really disliked Tiki. for the most part, sports was just a way for us to get after people together." 
Even in those 'hated' moments, there was a bond. 
"When we would get into fights with a teammate playing in the backyard or something, as soon as they would gang up on one of us, we all settled back on the same team again, so it was kind of cool," Tiki said. 
The Barbers both intend to bring families and friends to the game, which is important for both teams. 
After impressive wins against Washington at home and on the road at Atlanta and Dallas to take the lead in the NFC East, the Giants can't afford a let­down. They were in a similar position last year. They won three in a row to get to 6-2 and then lost to the sub-.500 Minnesota Vikings at home on a late field goal.

Irish to play rival Louisville 
By KYLE CASSILY 
Sports Writer 

Notre Dame and Louisville square off Sunday in Kentucky in a rematch of last year's Big East championship and for sole possession of second place in the league. 
The Irish {13-8, 7-1 Big East) fell out of first place in the league Sunday with a 3-0 loss to St. John's and are currently tied with the Cardinals (14-6, 7-1 Big East). Louisville must face DePaul a day before the match, and the Irish play Saturday at Cincinnati (15-5, 5-3 Big East}. 
The Louisville match will be televised nationally at 1 p.m. Sunday on ESPNU amidst an already sold-out Cardinal arena. 
"We expect it to be a very loud crowd and a fun environment to play in," Irish coach Debbie Brown said. 
The Irish and Cardinals last met Nov. 20, 2005 when No. 8 Notre Dame defeated No. 7 Louisville 3-2 for the Big East title. The Cardinals had won the regular season match. 
Brown said that Louisville is adept with net play, attacking and blocking due to their height. 
"We will have to serve very tough to keep them out of [their] system," Brown said. "They're very physical and very big." 
Freshman Tatyana Kolesnikova (Tashkent, Uzbekistan) leads the Cardinals with 218 kills, while Svetlana Dukule (Riga, Latvia) is second with 174. There are six interna­tional players on Louisville's 11­woman roster. 
As important as Sunday's match will be, the team refuses

to look past middle-of-the pack Cincinnati. The Bearcats are in their second Big East season, along with the Cardinals, after moving from Conference USA. 
"I honestly don't think that it would be possible to look past [Cincinnatil," Brown said. "We've done special drills to get ready for them. Coming off a loss, we're not going into any match thinking we got this one." 
Serving is the key to an Irish win Saturday against Cincinnati, Brown said. The Irish served no aces in their last match. 
"Cincinnati is a good blocking team," Brown said. "It's impor­tant for us to be really smart with our shots. We need to make sure we're not going up and just powering it through their block. We have to hit smart." 
The Irish have rebounded 
well from Sunday's loss to St. John's, Brown said. Players have come early to practice to spend extra time on their block­ing and passing in preparation for this weekend's key confer­ence showdowns. 
"We just continue to work on the fundamental skills," Brown said. "Our group is so motivated and so resilient it's not like we have to come back in and muster up motivation or feel sorry for ourselves." 
And with only four matches left in the regular season after this weekend, the Big East regu­lar season title is still up for grabs. 
"It's going to be a battle to the end," Brown said. "We have to play well every night we go out."

Belles ready to start conference postseason 
Team will face fifth­seeded Kalamazoo 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 

The first MIAA postseason tournament kicks off this Saturday with four first­
round matchups,  one  of  
which  includes  Saint  
Mary's.  

The Belles finished in fourth place and drew a home game against Kalamazoo that will be played at noon. 
The fifth-seeded Hornets finished the year at 3-3-2 in conference play -two points behind the Belles. 
The two teams met Sept. 30 on a cold, rainy after­noon. Saint Mary's man­aged to scratch out a 2-1 win, despite not scoring an offensive goal. The Hornets 
Leading the way for all games on the season was sophomore Kelly Lepper (nine goals, nine assists). Lepper was named MIAA offensive player of the week twice this season. 
Goalkeeper Kassandra Johnston was also given MIAA honors the week of Oct. 5 for her work between the posts. The freshman made 14 saves in a 0-0 double-overtime game with Olivet, and fol­lowed it up with another shut out two days later as the Hornets took down Franklin College 5-0. 
"We have been working of finishing a lot in practice so hopefully that will carry over into the game," Courtney said. 
Johnston finished the sea­son with seven shutouts and a goals-against average 
of 1.20.

"We have a really good chance to win," senior Colleen Courtney said. "They are a good team and it is going to be an evenly fought game." 
Freshman Paige Howell scored Kalamazoo's goal less than eight minutes into the game to even the score at 1-1, but the Hornets offense was unable to get anything else going for the remainder of the game. 
Seven different Kalamazoo players con­tributed to the team's nine conference goals for a very balanced offensive attack.

captain Brandon McLeod said. "But l am disappointed with the out­come. The team feels that we were a lot better than our 2-2 record for the season." 
The Griflins will have a tough time this weekend against the Green Wave. Fisher ended its sea­son with a big win over their rivals from Carroll Hall, and the team is hoping it will be able to maintain that momentum deep into the post­season. 
While Fisher is optimistic about its chances in the playoffs, it suf­fered a major setback at the end of the regular season. Against Carroll, Fisher quarterback Kevin Rabil was carried off the field in an ambu­lance. Rabil broke his ankle and is out for the rest of the season. 
The Green Wave is counting on their back-up quarterback, Pat Gotebeski, to step up. Gotebeski showed he is ready to take on the role when he sealed the victory over Carroll with a 49-yard touch­down drive. 
"The team has been practicing more this week to make sure that we are as prepared as possible going into Sunday's game," Rabil said. "We don't want to leave any­thing on the table." 
Stanford, who lost to Alumni and Keenan, knows this weekend's game will be tough, but the team thinks it is ready for the challenge. The Griffins have been working hard to prepare for the big game, and ifthe offense can dominate the Fisher. 
"Fisher is a really good team ­very sound offensively," McLeod said. "And they have a very di<ici­plined defense. I think our size, aggressiveness and overall team speed will be the advantage for us." 
The two teams will play on Sunday at 1:30 pm on the Riehle Fielcl<>. 
Zahm vs. Morrissey 
Can momentum trump talent? 
Zahm has the two-game winning streak. Morrissey has the better record and a size advantage. One will prevail Sunday, when the Rabid Bats face the Manorites at 2:30 
p.m. on Riehle North Field. Morrissey's size has not escaped Zahm captain Sean Wieland's eye. 
"We need to have a balanced attack," he said. "They're big, so we need to be able to run the ball so we can open up other facets of our offense. Their tight end is pretty tall, so we'll definitely keep an eye on 
him." 

Zahm, at 2-2 with the No. 6 seed, is looking for the upset. Morrissey, who at 3-1 has the No. 3 seed, comes into the playoffs fresh off a loss to Keenan. 
"We worked on being consistent in what we had," Manorite captain Steve Klein said. "We had some miscommunications in the Keenan game, so we've worked on that." 
The success of both teams will hinge on the play of their linemen. Zahm must find a way to win the battle in the trenches against a larger Morrissey front to stay in this game. 
the line." 

Morrissey has confidence in both 
its offen<;ive and defen<;ive lines and 
for good reason. 

"Our offensive line has been great," Klein said. "It's given us options on offense and allowed us to pass. Our defense has played well across the board all season, especially our line and linebackers." 
Morrissey's offensive Jine will have its hands full. Zahm's defen­sive front four have had success this year in locking up their man and preventing them from reaching the backfield. 
"We need to play the way we've played the last two weeks," Wieland said. "We'll do the same 
stuff." 
O'Neill vs. Carroll 

Neither the Mob nor the Vermin have a clear advantage on Sunday, when Carroll squares off against O'Neill at 1:30 p.m. on Riehle South Field. 
Both by chance -the two teams were 3-1 in the regular season. And by design -Carroll, the No. 4 seed, plays O'Neill, the No. 5 seed -this game is the closest match-up of the first round of the playoffs. 
Carroll's only loss came against No. 1-seoded Fisher, O'Neill lost to second-seeded Keenan. The winner will play Fisher or Stanford in the second round. 
Both teams know the importance of the game, but they trust that the strategies that got them to the play­offs will continue to be successful. 
"Nothing special," Carroll captain Mike Versagli said, when asked 
way. We'll run plays that we feel we're best at." O'Neill captain Pat Conley said the same thing. 
"We haven't worked on anything special," Conley said. "We're doing what we've been doing. We've been working on offense, working on defen')C, getting ready to play." 
Carroll hopes to get its pass offense on track after its loss to Fisher. 
"We need to play better than against Fisher," Versagli said. "We need to get our passing game on track and go from there." 
O'Neill, on the other hand, views the running game as the important factor of offensive success. 
"We need to establish the run," Conley said. "We'll take what the defense is giving us, but we really need to establish the run." 
O'Neill's defense has been strong all season, and Conley doesn't expect any less on Sunday. 
"Our defense has been pretty solid," he said. We've had a few shutouts, and that's what we're looking for, is a shutout." 
Keenan vs. Siegfried 
The Keenan Knight<; will look to continue their push for a return trip to Notre Dame Stadium when they face off against the 2-2 Siegfried Ramblers. 
The game will be played Sunday at 2:30 p.m. on Stepan Fields. 
However, while Keenan was the runner up last season, team captain Matt Gibson said that game is the farthest thing from his team's mind. 
"Thi" is a new year," he said. "We 
Keenan rolled through the com­petition this faJl en route to a 4-0 record. It knocked off highly-touted Morrissey in its final game of the season to clinch the Gold League regular season title.

"We have to stop their rushing attack," he said. "This game will most likely be decided by the play of the lines." 
Each team's most recent game was prior to Fall Break, over three weeks ago. 
"The break was good to get guys rested and healthy," Gibson said. "We got back to the grind as usual this week." 
One interesting thing to watch will be the head-to-head battle between the Knights' starting back, Alex Gonzalez, and the Ramblers' tandem ofWopperer and Manning. 
Gibson also pointed to his line­backer trio of Adam Fisher, Joe Pappas and Alex Staffieri as poten­tial game-changers. 
On the flipside, Pablo Nava, Siegfried's kicker, is close to auto­matic. Ifthe game is decided by the special teams, he will be an asset.

need to keep our team chemistry up." 
Spring admitted that there were aspects of the game that wil1 present challenges. 
"Our team has never seen Walsh play, so we're going in a little blind," she said. "And we'll need to just play to the best of our abilities." 
So what does Walsh need to do on Sunday to pull off the upset? 
Senior Wild Woman Laurie Wasikowski believes she knows the answer to that question. 
"The key is execution," she said. 
The winner of the game will advance to the second round, where they will match up against the winner of Welsh Family versus Breen-Phillips. 
Cavanaugh vs. Farley 
No. 4 Cavanaugh, once the top-ranked team in the Blue League, will battle No. 5 Farley Sunday in the opening game of the playoffs Sunday at 2 p.m. on West Quad. 
Chaos captain Kerri Bergen believes her team is entering the postseason with momentum, thanks to a 7-0 win over Lyons in Week 5. The win helped to erase the bad taste that resulted from two consecutive midseason losses. 
"The final game can definitely set the tone for how we mentally go into the first game of the playoffs," Bergen said. "And I think it's going to help tremen­dously that we came off with a win." 
Cavanaugh quarterback Katie Dunn led the Chaos against Lyons. She passed for a touch­down on the first drive of the game while the defense held on to preserve the victory. 
It was Cavanaugh's second win of the year and its second shutout of the season. However, it also marked the second time that the Chaos offense scored seven points or fewer, which could be a concern. 
Bergen said that her team can win the battle in the trenches on both sides of the ball. 
"The offensive and defensive lines have been working hard all year and have done a tremen­dous job," she said. "They don't get credit often, but they've been a major factor in our wins so far this year." 
As with Cavanaugh, Farley enters the postseason on a high note, following two consecutive wins to close out the regular season. The Finest turned their season around in Week 4, with a forfeit win over McGlinn. 
The Finest then went on to defeat Lewis, 26-6, the following week. 
Despite Farley's initial dis­pleasure with beating McGlinn by forfeit, the Finest clearly ben­efited from the win, which helped to strengthen the squad's late playofl' push. The following week's dominant victory over Lewis guaranteed that the Finest would enter the postsea­son on a roll. 
Neither team has played a game since the Sunday before Fall Break, but Bergen is not concerned. 
"We had practice the week before the break, and we've had a couple practices already this week to prepare for Sunday," she said. 
The Chaos appears to be tak­ing the high pressure of the playoffs in stride. 
"We want to have fun, but we're not taking this lightly," Bergen said. 
Breen Phillips vs. Welsh Family 
The Breen-Phillips Babes return to the postseason for the first time since 2004 when they face Welsh Family on Sunday at 4 p.m. on West Quad. 
At 6-0, the Whirlwinds look to spoil the Babes' (2-3-1) hopes of a Cinderella run to the Stadium. 
Welsh Family captain Brittany Scott identified the importance of getting a good start to demor­alize its inexperienced opponent. 
"We'll definitely try to get an early lead," Scott said, "We don't want to have to play from behind." 
Scott also downplayed the notion ~f "looking ahead" to a potential matchup with defend­ing champs Pasquerilla West. 
"We're going to treat this like any other game," she said. "We have to take it one game at a time to get to the Stadium." 
Meanwhile, Breen-Phillips has quietly been one of the more surprising teams this season. Behind the leadership of captain and quarterback Melissa Meagher, as well as receivers Meghan Ohlenforst and Tara Johnson, the Babes rebounded from a disappointing season last year to edge out Howard for the final Gold League playoff spot. 
Meagher counts on her team's energy and desire to keep the Babes in position to win. 
"We are excited to play, and we have a lot of confidence that if we play our game, we will beat Welsh [Family]," she said. 
"We know that they have a lot of talent, but we are excited to play." 
Both teams may come out sluggish as a result of the Fall Break layoff, but Scott said that her Whirlwind team would not be affected. 
"We 'vc had more than our usual number of practices this week, so it shouldn't be to our disadvantage," she said. 
Meagher agreed. 
"It probably wasn't good to have the week off, but we prac­ticed a couple times this week and we should be ready," she said. 
Meagher said solid fundamen­tals and focus was a priority for her team, while Scott said that forcing three-and-outs will be a point of emphasis. 
"We've lost one of our defen­sive stars for this week," Scott said. "But everyday it's someone different who makes a big play. So we'll just have to see who it is against BP."

8:05 p.m. in order to determine the tournament champion. ­
The Black Knights (3-0-1) are currently in first place in the Atlantic Hockey Conference after a pair of weekend wins over Connecticut. Seven of the team's 12 goals were scored while the Huskies were shorthanded. 
"They have the best power play in the country right now, no game in college hockey is an easy one," senior defenseman Wes O'Neill said. 
O'Neill, along with the rest of the Irish penalty-killing unit will be tested this weekend. Through four games, Notre Dame has held opponents to only three power play goals on 28 attempts. 
The two teams have met 15 times in the past and the Irish currently hold a slight at advan­tage with eight wins and seven losses. 
The other Academy in the tour­nament, Air Force, comes into the weekend with a 2-4 record. Junior Eric Ehn is averaging two points a game (8 goals, 4 assists) to lead the Falcons in the early part of the season. The winger is on pace to crush his previous career high of 14 goals in his sophomore year. 
East tournament hopes. Sop homore strikers Kerri Hanks and Brittany Bock and freshman forward Michele Weissenhofer all scored goals as the unit has solidified itself as one of the fiercest attacks in the country, with Hanks' 15 goals ranking fourth in the nation and Weissenhofer's 15 assists ranking first. That balance up front is crucial to their tournament success, accord­ing to Waldrum. 
"I think if you've got it spread out like that, it means the team is playing well as a group," he said. "All three are so different in the way they play. When they're all playing well like that, it's very difficult to shut all of them down." 
Eyeing its ninth Big East championship, Waldrum says Notre Dame is ready to take on the second half of the sea­son. 
"With this team, in the his­tory of the program, the play­offs are really what you get excited about," he said. "It's good to get into that part of it. Now you have to step it up another notch. We're looking forward to it." 
Contact Tim Dougherty at tdougher@nd.edu 

Air Force's first-round oppo­nent, Alabama-Huntsville, has one win in its first six games. The Chargers came out on top of a 4-2 decision over Wayne State Oct. 20. 
"We just have to go out and do what we did last weekend," Irish captain T.J. Jindra said. "A great team goes out and plays every weekend no matter who they are up against, and that's what were trying to be here." 
Notre Dame took a big step in the right direction last weekend with wins over No. 1 Boston College and Providence. The Irish outscored their Hockey East opponents by a total of 13-2 to bring their season total to 21 goals scored and six allowed. 
The Irish will not play at home again until Nov. 10 against Bowling Green. 
Notes: 

+Jackson would earn his 200th career win with a sweep of the Lightning Classic this weekend. The second-year Irish coach is 198-72-29 in eight years behind a college bench. 
He ranks 22nd in all-time wins among active collegiate coaches and has the best winning percent­age (.711) among those with at least five years behind a bench.

Knights of the pitch 

By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

After an efficient 2-0 victory over DePaul Wednesday night in the first round of the Big East tournament, No. 8 Notre Dame travels to Piscataway, 
N.J. to take on Rutgers in the quarterfinals this Saturday. 
With its conference record of 6-4-1 during the regular sea­son, Rutgers earned the No. 2 seed in the Big East's Red Division, which qualified the Scarlet Knights for a first round bye in the tournament. 

Despite Notre Dame's supe­rior conference record of 8-3­0, the Irish played a first round game because they fin­ished third in the Big East's Blue Division behind Connecticut and West Virginia. The top two teams from both the Red and Blue Divisions received byes.

By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 

Not a single player on the Irish roster was alive the last time Notre Dame won a mid-season tournament. 
No. 11 Notre Dame travels to Tampa, Fla. this weekend in hopes of changing that at the first annual Lightning College llockey Classic, hosted by the Irish. 
On Dec. 30, 1981, the Irish captured the Great Lakes Invitational with an 8-3 win over Michigan Tech. Since then the trophy case has remained untouched. 
"I knew that at some point I wanted to create an environment for our team to play in a big venue," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. 
Jackson, who already has four CCIIA titles and two national championships, played a big role in starting the tournament in order for his team to get accus­tomed to a high-pressure, post­season atmosphere. 
The second-year coach also hopes to use the location as a recruiting tool for future players when the tournament is moved to Christmas next season. ''I'd rather be in Tampa for

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
Walsh,PW primed for playoff tilt 
By ANDREW KOVACH, JOHN TIERNEY and COLIN REIMER Sports Writers 
Sixth-seeded Walsh Hall hopes to score an upset Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. on West Quad when it meets the No. 3 Pasquerilla West Purple Weasels in the first round of the Women's Interhall playoffs. 
The Purple Weasels' only blemish on the season came against top-ranked Pangborn. On the other hand, after a slow start Walsh was able to finish 4­2 and secure a spot in the post season. 
Both teams will not be satis­fied this season unless they leave West Quad with a playoff victory. PW is still hungry after losing the nail biter to Pangborn early in the year, while Walsh captain Mary Claire Sullivan knows that the Wild Women still haven't completed their goals. 
"We went 4-2 this season, but we definitely had a slow start and haven't met our full expec­tations,'' Sullivan said. "We have room to improve." 
PW captain Mo Spring, though disappointed her team couldn't pull ofT a perfect run, is confi­dent going into the playoffs based on the Purple Weasel's performance in October and November of last season. 
"We're a pretty strong return­ing team, so we're not going to change anything drastic in the playoffs," Spring said. "We just

Top-ranked Notre Dame cruises into postseason 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
After sprinting through its non-conference and Big East regular season 18-0-1 as the nation's only undefeated team, No. 1 Notre Dame begins the third leg of coach Randy Waldrum's professed four­phase journey when it hosts its Big East quarterfinal 1 
p.m. Sunday at Alumni Field as the top seed. 
The Irish welcome fourth­seeded St. John's (10-4-4, 5-3­
3 Big East) after they beat fifth-seeded Seton Hall 2-0 Thursday in the first round of the tournament. 
St. John's is one of only four Big East teams Notre Dame hasn't faced this year, along with Syracuse, South Florida and Marquette. Since the Irish did not play St. John's last year, either, Waldrum and the staff are still waiting to look at tapes of the Red Storm today to break down their style.

an of promise 
D~fensive end Victor Abiamiri was a prep standout in Baltimore. Four years later, he's back to show how far he's come zvith the Irish. 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Editor 
Victor Abiamiri has made a 
name for himself. 
His attitude is fierce and point­
ed, his intelligence sharp and his 
football knowledge top notch. He 
draws double teams because one 
man simply isn't enough. 
NFL scoul'i drool when they see 
a 6-foot-4, 270-pound defensive 
end with the Irish senior defen­
sive end's foot speed and power. 
His body size and weight are per­
fect for the position, and what 
NFL teams see is upside -some­
thing people have always seen in 
him. 
A native of Randallstown, Md., 
a Baltimore suburb, Abiamiri 
returns to a home crowd for the 
contest Saturday following two 
games in which opposing quar­
terbacks often found themselves 
looking at dirt, then turning up to 
see a white "95" bulging from a 
deep blue jersey. 
But Abiamiri didn't first pick up any of his coveted traits from a whistle-blowing drill sergeant or a pull-your teach coach. Abiamiri's path to football star­dom started with a head coach and defensive coordinator who had a simple mantra: "Fifty men working together, loving each other, cannot be beat." 
Growing up Gilman 
Abiamiri and Ambrose Wooden never met until August of 1999. They've gone to school together ever since. 
Wooden, now an Irish corner­back, remembers when he first encountered the hulky Abiamiri in football practice at the begin­ning of their freshman year at Gilman School on Baltimore's northern edge. 
"He was probably the same size he is now, maybe 40 pounds lighter. I saw him and he said he dunked in fifth grade," the 5-foot­11 Wooden says with a smile. "I was like, wow, I can't even dunk now." 
The two would spend the next four years under the tutelage of two men -Gilman head coach Biff Poggi and volunteer defensive coordinator Joe Ehrmann. The two have a unique coaching style that stresses brotherhood over competition. 
Their focus on teaching players how to become men -is so dif­ferent than other programs that Abiamiri calls Gilman "probably the only place in the world" to get the kind of coaching he did. And he soaked it up. 
Abiamiri says Poggi and Ehrmann have been "father fig­ures" to him. 
"They're probably some of the best influences I've had in my live," he says. "They, and my own father, turned me from a boy into a man." 
Wooden remembers his team­mate Abiamiri starting at safety as a freshman, all 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds of him roving in the secondary, ready to make a play. The big man was then known as "Ookie Rock" -a nickname Wooden says comes from Abiamiri's dancing. Abiamiri jok­ingly said he will haunt Wooden 
down the sideline. "We were going crazy," Wooden says. 
He remembers the "big and goofy" Abiamiri looking toward the end zone. 
"He didn't make it," Wooden says with a chuckle. 
The personality switch 
His teammate would become a defensive end with a mean streak that stands in stark contrast from his otherwise soft, intelligent per­sona. Off the field, he seems more peace-seeker than quarterback hunter. 
Brady Quinn laughs about Abiamiri's Jekyll and Hyde. "Vic," he says, is "one of those guys that's a lot of fun to be around." 
"It's tough to put into words," the Irish quarterback said with a smile. "He's one of those big, mean guys that really doesn't like to be mean. I think that's why he kind of likes playing football because he's able to go out there on the field and dish it out on the field and be happy." 
For Abiamiri, it's simple. \Vhen he's on the football field, he's looking to scare

earned that on the field, with 17 career sacks, including six this season and eight in 2005. 
Even before he had any, Abiamiri was confident. Just ask former Irish weak side end and current New York Giant Justin Tuck, who Abiamiri says took him 
under his wing dur­
teammates who are upset or down know they can turn any situation around with hard work. 
Yet when inches away from an offensive tackle before the ball is snapped, all he's trying to do is intimidate. 
"I actually don't think it's that tough to change your mentality," he said. 
Gilman School's motto is simple: "Turning Boys of Promise into Men of Character." 
Abiamiri has always had a lot of promise. 
The position switch 
Poggi and Ehrmann moved Abiamiri to the defensive line after his freshman season, a move that Baltimore high school foot­ball would never forget. As a jun­ior, he had 17 sacks. As a senior, he recorded 12 more and threw in an interception, for old time's sake. 
For colleges across the country, he was the defensive line stud of his graduating class. 
"He was everyone's No. 1 at defensive end out of high school," said Tom Lemming, a longtime national recruiting analyst. "Basically every school in the country was going after him." 
After a long recruiting period and at least one report of recruiters trying so desperately to get Abiamiri that they flouted NCAA rules, the academics at Notre Dame lured one of the nation's top prizes to South Bend in 2003. 
"Teams saw his size and speed," Lemming said. "He had 
Tuck had 13.5 sacks. Nonetheless, Abiamiri saw significant action. The freshman started five games and played in all 12; he registered 22 tackles, including four for losses, and a sack. 
'There arc two things you have to be to play as a freshman -tal­ented and smart," Tuck said. "And he was both." 
Eye on the motor man 
More than 40 games after Abiamiri first suited up for Notre Dame, pro teams from across the country are once again looking at his promise and potential. 
Projected by some to be a first­round pick, Abiamiri is playing under the careful eyes of scouts. Like he did during his senior year of high school by announcing his commitment after the season fm­ished, Abiamiri is pushing any NFL Draft talk aside. 
Like every other Irish player ­and most in college football -he says it would be too much of a dis­traction. Thinking about the weekly jumps and bumps from analyst'i like ESPN's Mel Kiper would be overwhelming. 
It would keep him from his mental preparation, he says ­keep him from doing what he needs to do to help his team win now. 
And one of the best ways Abiamiri can help his team now is by freeing up other Irish defend­ers when he faces double teams. 
"Victor has put himself in a position now where teams ­when we go against anybody, they know where Victor is," Irish comes from big games, like the two he's had against Stanford. In 2005, he recorded four sacks in the fmal game of the regular sea­son. This Oct. 7, he added anoth­er three against the Cardinal. 
"All you can do is help yourself by focusing on the game at hand every week," he says. 
If Abiamiri stays as focused as he has been, it'll help the Irish in the short term and -come April -pad his wallet. 
After his performance against Stanford and then his sack and two more quarterback hurries against UCLA last Saturday, Kiper has Abiamiri shooting up to No. 10 in his "Big Board" list of the best draft prospects in the nation. 
Weis credits much of Abiamiri's success to his ever-churning legs and forceful body push -and that, the coach says, is something NFL scouts love about the senior just as much as his physique. 
"The one thing I do know about [Abiamiri] that I didn't know when I got here is that he has a very, very, very high motor that goes with his athletic ability," Weis said. "There are a lot of peo­ple with athletic ability that don't have a high motor [but] he goes high on every play. It presents a problem week in and week out for any [offense] that we go against." 
The home option 
Abiamiri will try to be a prob­lem once again Saturday in an important game for the senior. He says he managed to get 15 to 20 tickets for family members in the Baltimore area to see his first ­and only -collegiate game in the area. 
"It's awesome to be able to go home and play in front of family and friends," he said. 
But against an option team, his job is a little different. 
He will have to replace his bull rushes and swims with mental focus and sharp discipline. As offensive tackles block toward the center of the line and fullbacks come full-steam-ahead toward the corner, Abiamiri's task will be much different. 
"We might not even block ol' Victor, much less double him," Navy coach Paul Johnson said Tuesday. "We will read him on the option." 
That means Abiamiri will be forced to wait out Midshipmen quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku­Enhada as he scurries to the cor­ner. If Abiamiri takes the wrong angle or bites at the wrong time, Navy could run right through the Irish defense. 
"It's the most frustrating offense in all of football," Tuck said, glad no NFL teams run it against the Giants. "You need a lot of mental preparation." 
Abiamiri thinks he has that. He thinks he'll be able to stick to his man on every play and be patient. 
For most defensive ends, that patience is tough. But for one who's used to being as calm off 
the  field  as  he  is  fearsome  
between t he sideli nes  -maybe  
not.

IRISH PASSING 

The biggest problem in the Irish passing game right now is the offensive line. But if Notre Dame wins the battle in the trenches, Quinn has five legitimate targets Navy must cover -Samardzija, 
Rashawn King and Keenan little, Navy's starting corners, are 6-foot and 5-foot-11, respectively. 
They both have good speed and the ability to flock to the ball, but only Uttle has an interception. Of Navy's three other picks, two have been by free safety Jeremy McGown and the last by backup safety DuJuan Price. 
With all their targets, the Irish may have the best receiving corps in the nation. McKnight and Samardzija are tied for second on the all-time Notre Dame receptions list (143), and Darius Walker leads all Irish receivers (92). With Grimes' performance against UClA, Quinn adds yet another reliable target.

IRISH RUSHING 


Notre Dame had some serious problems in its ground game against UClA. The offensive line didn't open holes for Darius Walker, and ·walker wasn't able to make anything happen. The Irish fmished with 41 net rushing yards and just 76 yards gained, discounting the Bruins' five sacks. 
Navy switches between a 3-4 and a 4-3 at times, but the Midshipmen linemen are always fairly light. Left end Tye Adams is 6-foot-3 and 225 pounds, nose guard Larry Cyic is 6-foot-2 and 280 pounds and right end John Chan is 6-foot-1 and 249 pounds. They are fast and can shoot gaps with solid efficiency. 

As much as Navy coach Paul Johnson (and most 
The Irish need to start getting some respect in of college football) would love to see the the national rankings. And given Weis' reaction to Midshipmen break Notre Dame's 42-game win Notre Dame's drop from No. 10 to No. 11 after streak in the series, it just won't happen. Not \vith beating UClA, concerns regarding the postseason this receiving corps and not after a close win over are beginning to creep into his mind. The Irish UQA that must have scared the Irish into taking front seven continue to gel, and there are some every team seriously.

NAVY 
RUSHING OFFENSE 
In the first quarter of Navy's last game against Rutgers, the Midshipmen lost quar­terback Brandon Hampton, throwing the offense into a state of disarray. After the 34-0 loss the Midshipmen had a bye week to adjust to quarterbacks Jarod Bryant and Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada (above), who have both seen time calling signals. Hampton had been leading the team in rushing, but both players have the chance to excel in the triple option. Navy's best defense is a clock-controlling offense. 
NOTRE DAME 
RUN DEFENSE 
Joe Brockington (above) had a career­high seven tackles against UCLA, and the linebacking corps will need to step up against Navy to keep the offense off the field. The linebackers need to force the Midshipmen out of their comfort zone and into an offense that 
. depends more on the pass. The defensive line has been playing well lately, and if its strong play is backed up by run-stuffing line­backers the Navy offense won't have a chance. Hard tackling will ensure that Navy doesn't pound the ball for 60 minutes and will give the Irish offense chances to score.

After Thomas' injury, Brockington emerges as aforce with Crum

Predicting that a rib injury to linebacker Travis Thomas, which came in the final moments against Michigan State, would eventually yield some positives for Notre Dame's season might have been difficult to imagine four weeks ago.
