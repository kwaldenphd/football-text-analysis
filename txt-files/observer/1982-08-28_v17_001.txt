Balancing your act 

I'm sure that you've heard it a million times already, but let me take this opportunity on behalf ofthe entire Observer staffto congratulate you on your acceptances to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Your first few days here have probably been hectic but exciting as you adjust to strange surroundings, meet new friends and say good-bye to your family. Ofcourse, there will be all the parties, dances, and picnics to at­tend and plenty of sporting activities going on all over campus. Amidst such fanciful happenings, one might tend to overlook the major reason why we're all here, which, obviously or not, is to learn. As you merrily make the rounds ofthe multitude ofevents this weekend, per­"haps somewhere in the deep recesses of your mind lurks that nasty homonculus called Reality which acts up every cince in a while, perhaps in between dances at the ACC, shouting such frightening curses as "Eat, drink, and be merry today, freshmen, for tomorrow..." Well, I'm sure you've already filled in the blank with your own ominous conclusion. 
But you can confidently tell that little man in your mind to keep quiet, because the true reality is that the transition to college life is really not that difficult, espe­cially at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Both colleges

you should be familiar with. Every day The Observer will present the news and sports you need to know in order to grasp exactly what Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are all about. Turning to The Observer each day at lunchtime, a campus tradition, will keep you informed and entertained and will present all that the schools have to offer in order to make your four years here fun and rewarding. 
As a freshman, you will be immediately subjected to a great amount of pressure, not only academically but even socially. Life away from home is very different, but coping with the many changes can be made easier just by keeping your cool and maintaining an even keel in the various aspects ofyour life. Many students, and cer­tainly not just freshmen, cheat themselves while at col­lege by indulging too much in one thing, while denying themselves involvement in other potentially rewarding areas. For some people, partying is what college life is all about. These students live only for the weekends, which for them usually starts Wednesday after classes. Others immerse themselves in their books in that elusive quest for a perfect 4.0 GPA. These students live for the weekends only because it offers them two class­free days in which to get more studying done. Still others become so involved with various organizations that their grades suffer and their social life becomes vir­tually nonexistent. 
If you are really concerned about getting the most out ofyour college experience, an equitable combina­tion of the these three activities is usually the best course to follow. You can learn a great deal outside the classroom by interacting with other people and getting involved with organizations and social happenings. By interacting with others, we all learn the very valuable gift of communication, something which no textbook , can teach. Unlike some calculus function which you learn today and forget tomorrow (obviously the words 

be playing with the rugby club or writing profound columns for the school newspaper. 
Icertainly hope that you keep some ofthese thoughts in mind as you try to find your own little niche in this new environment. Work hard, play hard, and get in­volved, and your four years at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's should prove very rewarding. 
And once again, congratulations to the class of I986.

Du Lac outlines policies 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Editor 
Du Lac, Notre Dame's guide to student life, may be 79 pages long but Dean of Students james Roemer can reduce the University discipli­nary rules to nine policies. 
And the alcohol policy is the one Roemer says freshmen should un­derstand best. 
"Alcohol is to be consumed with­in the laws of the state of Indiana in moderation," Roemer said yester­day. Students under 21 years of age may drink only in their rooms or designated party rooms. Comsump­tion of alcohol anywhere else on campus, including the football stadium, means a n 00 fine regard· less ofthe offender's age. 
Students over 21 may also drink in the new Alumni-Senior Club. Kegs on campus result in a S100 fine. 
"Alcohol abuse is the biggest, single problem freshmen run into," Roemer said. "Freshmen should be aware that the University feels very strongly about the moderate use of alcohol" 

The eight other major rules in du Lac are: 
Drugs. 
Using or providing drugs, including marijuana, is strictly prohibited and may result in expul­sion from the University. 

Sexuality. 
The University believes that sexual union should occur only in marriage. 

Parietals. 
Visiting hours for guests ofthe opposite sex end in residence halls at 2 a.m. Saturday and Sunday mornings and midnight on other nights. 

The 
other five rules prohibit academic dishonesty, theft, injuries to persons or property, defamation of character, and other infringe­ments on the rights ofstudents. 


"There are a lot of people who 

The Observer Saturday, August 28, 1982 -page 3 

don't worry about these rules and · regulations," Roemer said. "Their way of acting does not involve a violation." 
Another important du Lac regula­tion is the restriction on elevated beds. Elevated beds must have writ­ten approval from the office of Stu­dent Residences, and students must also install a smoke detector. The surface of the top mattress may not be higher than seven feet and may not be closer than three feet to the ceiling. 
This year's edition of du Lac will also be used next year since printing costs have made annual publication too costly, according to Vice Presi­dent of Student Affairs Father john Van Wolvlear. The 1982-84 du Lac (French for "of the lake") is dis­tributed to freshmen by the hall staffs. 
Campus life to get boost 
By KELll FLINT 
Executive News Editor 
Dave Drouillard says he has the third toughest job at Notre Dame. 
Drouillard ranks Coach Gerry Faust's job as the toughest, then Father Theodore Hesburgh's. But as the Student Union's social commis­sioner, Drouillard is responsible for social life on campus. 
"Social life here has always been questioned," he said. "Students think there isn't a lot to do compared with state universities." 
Drouillard attributes the prob),em to lack of student awareness about events. "Students look at posters, but it doesn't register in their minds." 
More active publicity will be implemented during the campus­wide Welcome Week, Consequent­ly, Drouillard predicts that activities 

Van Lines changes routes 
ByJOHN M. HIGGINS 
News Staff 
No changes are expected in the operation of the shuttle bus be­tween Saint Mary's and Notre Dame this year, adminstrators at both col­leges said. The weekend off-campus bus, Van lines, however, is undergo­ing significant schedule changes. 
The shuttle is operated by Transpo, the South Bend metropolitan transit agency, under contract to both colleges. The shuttle will continue to run at ap­proximately 30 minute intervals un­til 2 a.m. every day between various points on the two campuses. There is no charge for service before 4 p.m. and a 15-cent fare afterward. 
"Originally the shuttle ran only Monday through Friday during the day," said Jim McDonnell, Notre Dame director of student activities. "The two colleges felt obligated to provide transportation service to students attending classes at dif­ferent campuses." Gradually, service was expanded into the evening and 
on  weekends  and  fares  were  in­ 
stituted.  
McDonnell  estimated  costs  of  

shuttle service at more than SIOO,OOO. "The service is con­tracted jointly between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and split down the middle after evening and weekend fares are subtracted." 
McDonnell also said Van Lines will operate only between Notre

during the week will go over well. "When students can hear the bands outside, they will go outside and see what's going on." 
 Several individual groups offer so­cial outlets for students. However, they are usually for students with similar ethnic or regional back­grounds. Drouillard considers his commission an "umbrella figure." "There will always be individual factions," he said. "There is nothing you can do about it. We won't center aro~nd any certain group." 
Drouillard admits it is nice for stu­dents to have a place to go where they can be with people who share something in common. He expects students in these groups to par­ticpate in Student Union's scheduled activities as well. "Students won't forget the Student Union just be­cause they're a member ofthe Black Cultural Arts Council or M.E.Ch.A.( Mexican American Club)." 
While fraternities and sororities may provide a social outlet on other campuses, Drouillard thinks that at Notre Dame students place em­phasis on dorms for social activity. 
"It's a bigger deal here to get in­volved with dorms," he said. "At other universities, fraternities take social life away form campus." 
Drouillard says his major goal for the year will be to integrate dorms. "Although there are rivalries, I think the dorms respect each other and maintain the Notre Dame tradition." He hopes to provide more activities that several dorms can sponsor to­gether. 
One social activity that may suffer this year will be concerts. Drouillard notes that concerts at Notre Dame have dwindled during the past four

STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT 
Junior Kathleen Murphy, a Social 
Work major from Oyster Bay, N.Y., is 
the 1982-83 Saint. Mary's Student 
Body President. In addition to her 
official capacity as chairman of the 
Board of Governance, Murphy sees 
her job as one ofa delegator and ad­
visor. "I am here to make sure that 
the work gets done," Murphy said. 
Her goal this year is to encourage all 
students to get more involved in stu· 
dent government. Murphy stresses 
that she wants the student body to 
feel comfortable and knowledgeable 
about their student government. All 
student government meetings are 
open to the public. 
DIRECTOR OF STUDENT 
ACTMTffiS 

Mary Anne O'Donnell, director of 
student activities, works closely 
with both committees and in­
dividuals in planning activities at 
Saint Mary's. The oOffice of Student 
Activities, headed by O'Donnell, is 
designed to provide educational as 
well as social activities. O'Donnell 
stresses the importance of student 
input in her department. O'Donnell 
acts as advisor to many campus 
clubs and organizations, as well as 
being in charge of orientation ac­
tivities. She sees her job as "being an 
educator...to help students learn 
certain skills." O'Donnell urges all 
students to become involved in 
present campus activities, and to 
come to her with ideas for the 
future. 
FRESHMAN ACADEMIC COUN­
SElOR 

Susan Vanek, freshman academic 
counselor, plays a vital role in the 
academic life of all incoming fresh­
man. The Freshman Office, headed 
by Vanek, is the headquarters for all 
matters relating to freshmen. During 
orientation and the the first few 
weeks of college, Vanek is respon­
sible for answering any questions 
concerning pre-registration, course 
changes, and add/drops, in addition 
to general academic counselling. 
Once the year is underway, accord· 
ing to Vanek, her department is 
primarily responsible for maintain·.. 
ing all academic records pertaining 
to freshmen as well as the faculty 
academic policy. The Freshman 
Office also refers students to other 
departments, such as the Counsell­
ing and Career Development Cen· · ter.

His major duties, according to Duggan, include providing academic leadership an(f general direction of college affairs. "We try, through this office, to make sure the mission ofthe college is ad· hered to...That is, to be the very best Catholic women's liberal arts col­lege possible," Duggan said. He stressed the importance of "maintaining the sense of com­munity that thrives on this campus." Duggan's position as president fre­quently takes him away on fundrais­ing missions. He pointed out that the general decline in outside sources of financial aid make such projects as the new Cushwa-Leighton Library increasingly difficult to finance. 
While Duggan is pleased with the­working relationship between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, he stresses the importance of the College maintaining an identity as its own in­dividual women's college. 
DEAN OF STUDENT AFFAIRS 
Kathleen M. Rice, dean of student 
affairs, is the chief student affairs of· 
fleer and one offive senior officers at

For some people, the name Theodore Hesburgh means Notre Dame. That's because for the past 30 years, Hesburgh's name has ap­peared on the desk ofthe University president. Hesburgh planned to resign as president last May, but at the request ofthe Board ofTrustees, he decided to remain for five more years. Hesburgh directs all campus affairs, answering to the authority of the Board of Trustees. He oversees the administrative staff with his five­vice presidents, and he also acts as the liaison for the Alumni Board and the University. Hesburgh travels fre­quently -sometimes for fundrais­ing, ·other times for meetings of his several political, corporate, theological, and academic commit· tees. 
PROVOST 

Provost Timothy O'Meara is the second highest administrator at Notre Dame and oversees academic and faculty matters. He is the direct superior of the vice presidents of Student Affairs and Advanced Studies. One of the chief respon­sibilities of the provost is to review faculty tenure and promotion deci­sions. O'Meara was named provost in 1978. Before then he had been

The annual faculty art show starts today at the O'Shaughnessy Galleries in the Snite Museum ofArt. 
The show is primarily directed at freshman art majors, who will have a chance to see the recent WO[~S of their future professors. The.exbibit will also be open to the public Sep­tember 5 until October 10. 
The works oftw t elve Notre Dame professors will be featured in this year's show. 
"The show has an equilibrium to it," said Professor Don Yogi, who has an exhibit in the show. "It has abstract things in the front and figurative things in the back. 
"Most faculties seem to have a single direction which is usually figurative," said Vogl. "We (at Notre Dame) have an advantage in that stu­dents don't have to decide what style a school has and then p k, they can pick a school and work in their own style." _

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT 
Father Edmund P. Joyce is Notre Dame's money man. Joyce is the Ex­ecutive Vice President ofthe Univer­sity, but considers his most important role that ofchieffinancial officer. "The only private schools that will survive will be those able to raise enough money," says Joyce, who earned a bachelor's degree in· accounting from Notre Dame in 1937. Joyce's other duties include faculty board chairman, athletic director, and building committee chairman. Subordinate only to the University president and the provost,Joyce was named Executive Vice President in 1952, simul­taneous to the start of Hesburgh's presidency. 
STUDENT AFFAIRS 

Father John Van Wolvlear, vice 
president for student affairs, is 
respo1_1sible for every area ofcampus 
life except academics and finances. 
The office ofStudent Affairs includes

He ex­plained that instead of increasing use of the bus line, service to those · areas actually decreased ridership because of the increased length of the trip. 
"University Park and Town and Country are definitely the most popular areas," McDonnell said. "We felt that the movie theaters at the other two locations would at­tract more people but it didn't work." 
Van Lines evolved from the Quikee, a student-run weekend bus service to Michigan when the legal drinking age there was only 18 several years ago. When the Michi­gan drinking was raised to 21 in 1979 the service was discontinued. The idea was revived by Vice Presi­dent for Student Affairs Father John

The University contracts a private bus company to operate the service. Service is not offered on the days of home football games. McDonnell said that funds for Van Lines come from three sources: ac­tivity fees, University budget allot-. ments and fares collected. He 
estimated the costs to be $7000 or 
$8000. He added that costs should decrease this year as a result of the shortened length ofthe route.

Freshman Year offers home 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
NewsEditor 
Home base for Notre Dame fresh­men is the Freshman Year ofStudies, an office coordinating the freshmen 
· curriculum and guidance program. "The Freshman Year ofStudies is, in effect, the college for freshmen," says Dr. Emil T. H.ofman, dean of Freshman Year. "Freshmen need special consideration and care both academically and personally." All freshmen tackle a schedule of liberal studies including classes in social studies, science, writing, and mathematics. 'Students also take courses in their proposed field of study. "In the academic transition," Hof­man says, "freshmen must first get a good foundation in general educa­tion, but they must also have the op· portunity to sample areas of specialization before they commit to cenain majors." Freshman Year also employs seven coimselqrs who guide stu· dents' transition into the sophomore year. In addition, the Freshman Learning Resource Center offers old-test files, tutors, and career guidance. "It's not easy being a freshmen," says Hofman, who has been dean since I972. "But there is so much help given here, the freshmen stay." More than 99 percent of the fresh· . men remain at Notre Dame, compared to 70 percent at some col· leges. Dean Hofman, who also teaches freshmen General Chemistry, or­ganizes a popular array of social ac­tivities. "It is very imponant that freshmen be given some help in making these social and personal ad·· justments." The first activity is 'a shopping

Is there lite after classes ? 
Three years as a Notre D.tme :-.tuden. na\' tat.;,;llt me many things about how people <.ketde .u o~ve out tllL'tr days on this campus. The dtfterent methods vary some but rarely do they run outside of the accepted norm. 
Some are determined to spend their choicest hours perusing their textbooks, absorbing the minutest facts and figures concerning the topography ofSwaziland while others make a concerted effort to memorize with· in one weekend the exact location and prices ofall the area liquor establishments. 
Last year something very odd, almost foreign to this campus, happened to the freshmen. It seemed as though they had, as a united body, decided to dedicate themselves to the rigors of the academic life. That was all very fine considering that we as students atteml this university for just that purpose. The problem was that their dedication had faculty and staffworried because· the freshmen were studying to the exclusion of pursu· ing other extra-curricular activities. 
TariBrown 
features 

When I was a freshman, the excuse was, "I don't have time." College made me nervous. The idea that I would be attendingcollege courses, taught by some ofthe most learned people in their fields frightened me into budgeting my time with extreme discretion. Studies were first priority above all else. 
With me, that lasted for about two days, until I came across the audition notices for Hamlet. 
The excuse last year was much the same wording. The "do not" though seemed more absolute, rather symptomatic ofborderline paranoia. It was obvious to me that the excuse was taken more seriously than when I was a freshmen and adhered to with an almost fanatical dedication. 
Dedication to academics or non-academics? 
Someone very wise and very learned in the world once told me that it was important to find the balance between studying and pursuing my other interests. Those words ofwisdom guided me through my last three years. Choir, play rehearsals, movies, they all kept me sane enough to endure the last minute pressures of pre-finals week when everything but your grandmother had to be handed in by three o'clock Friday or your grade would drop a grade even ifyou aced the final. 
Living out your days on campus can be a chore, like taking out the garbage or cleaningout the garage, or it can open yours eyes and answer the question of whether there is life outside of textbooks. 
Rest assured that there is lite outside of Emil's chemistry manual. 
Where? As the motto of the state of Michigan goes, (modified herein), "Ifyou seck a pleasant experience, look about you." 
The choices range from art to dance, with a little hit ofeverything in between. 
One of the things any visitor to Notre Dame or Saint :\lary's discovers is that this is an artistic community. From the various sculptures that adorn our campus to the collections housed in our museums and galleries. one notices that the people here value art. The Snite :Vtusuem ofArt houses a permanent collection ranging in periods from )"iOO B.C. up to the present. The O'Shaughnessy Galleries, adjacent to the Snite :\luscum, provide exhibition space for traveling collections. Dealing mostly with contemporary art, they presently are exhibiting two shows: the Annual Faculty .Show from August 29 to October I 0 and Women Artists: Tbe Indiana -.Vew York Connection through September 
26. 
Across the road on Saint :\1ary's campus, three galleries are contained in :\loreau Hall. Throughout the coming semesters there will be student portfolios as welt as faculty and outside exhibitions displaye!l in the Hanu:ncs, Littlt: Theatre and Moreau Galleries. Though small in comparison to the Snite, the works there are not to be overlooked. The works are demonstrative of the direction in which the art world is moving. 
Ifwandering through an art gallery is not one ofyour major time priorities. music, theatre and dance provide three diflerent alternatives. 
For those with interested in vocal or instrumental music, there are choirs and ensembles to on both campuses to choose from. Saint Mary's :\1usic depart­ment sponsors the Chamber Singers, a mixed touring group, the Collegiate Choir, a pop group, and the Women's Choir, open to students from both campuses. Vocal music thrives at Notre Dame with Chorale, Uni­versity Chorus, men's Glee Club, Chapel Choir and Col­legium Musicum. 

Instrumental musicians have three resources, the Wind Ensemble and Collegium Musicum at Saint Mary's and the University Orchestra at Notre Dame. 
Music as performing art has its stages. Two of the regular arenas are Chautauqua and the Nazz, both in the Lafortune Student Center. The Nazz is reknowned for its campus musicians and comedy acts. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, a stop down there for a half 
. hour study break will bring you hack to reality and force you to remember that there is more to life than a Friday Though all ofthe music groups require auditions, no one should be discouraged. 
The stages of the Nazz and Chautauqua cohabitate the LaFortune Student Center. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights,student musicians, comics and whatever display their talents to warm, receptive audiences. Chautauqua, in a coffee shop atmosphere, presents the likes oflocal bands, gives its dance tloor an occasional workout and provides discussion space for social concerns presentations. 
Theatre is another area that has many opportunities throughout the year for participation. The cooperative Theatre Department of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's presents two seasons, the :\lain Stage and Second Scene. Auditions will be held for the first two productions, The Taming ofthe Shrew and Tbe Maids, Wcdncsday, Sep­tember I at O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint :\1ary's and Thursday, September 2 at Washington Hall at Notre Dame at 7 p.m. both nights. These auditions, as with all the auditions for theatrical productions on campus, are open to all students. 
Each semester Student Players produces one show 
i
under the auspices of the Student Union. Whereas the productions sponsored by the Theatre Department arc educational in nature, the Student Players sole purpose is to entertain. 
l 
The ND/SMC Theatre Department oversees the operation of the Cnderground Theatre which is one of the newest performing spaces. Students who are in­terested in directing and producing on a smaller scale use this space. Frequently these productions are original works by faculty and staff. 
While art, music and theatre have been represented 
o.n campus for many years, the dance community has only recently surfaced under two forms. Departmental­ly, there is the Notr.. Dame/Saint :\lary's Dance Theatre. Classical ballet finds ib home in the Dance Theatre with classes ofvarying levels oftercd on Saint \laf)·'s campus. The Dance Theatre offers classes in techniques besides classical ballet. 
Abiogenesis Dflnce Co/lectiue, a student-run dance company, explores the world of modern dance in its classes and performing troupe. This group is open to all students regardless ofprevious experience. 
Don't let the bookstore he the only source of your learning experience. There arc many additional resources from which to learn about the dimensions of lite outside ofacademia. Walk into Washington Hall, Crowley Hall of :\1usic, the Snite, Moreau Hall or O'Laughlin and sec the other side oflife, the creative side.

What makes Rickey run? 

The first thing you notice about Rickey Henley Hen­derson is, you are surprised you are able to see him. A guy who steals a base a game should be about as visible as an amoeba. You figure he must end to fade out when he gets to first base. He's like The Shadow in the old radio serial. You can hear him, but you can't see him. Lamont Cranston in spikes. Or, maybe, he just wraps himself in miles ofbandages like Claude Rains. 
Rickey's a perfectly ordinary-looking fellow. About 5-10, 190, he only has the two legs. The eyes are alert and wary. They remind you ofa deer who has just heard a hammer click. He talks fast, he walks fast, he probably eats fast, but there are no antennae poling out where his ears ought to be. He looks totally terrestrial. He doesn't change outfits in a phone booth. He comes to work on the team bus like everyone else even though a teammate one night answered a reporter's question "Rickey Henderson? He ain't here yet, but he'll come in over the flagpole in centerfield any minute." 
Rickey is the new U.S. Steal Corp. He's making a shambles of the basepaths. He's making a mockery of the geometry of the grand old game which dictated since the days ofAbner Doubleday that a ball can travel 127 feet faster than a man can run 90 feet. If Rickey were a step faster, they'd have to outlaw him -or re­engineer the game. 
Rickey has already stolen well over 100 bases this year. Up until 1962, no one had ever even stolen 100 bases in a whole season. Henderson did it byJuly. Ifyou t.hink this isn't remarkable, consider that Dom DiMag­gio 'led the American League in steals as late as 1950 with 15 for the season. Stan Hack led the National League back-to-back in the '30s. One year he had 16. The next year, he improved: He had 17. Rickey Hender­son has stolen more bases than the New York Yankees stole all last year. 
What makes Rickey run? Sheer speed? That's not enough. That's like saying black gloves make you a burglar. There may be a dozen guys as fast as Rickey Henderson in the game. And they don't have half as many steals. 
Rickey Henderson smiles slyly when asked his "secret." "Oh, I have my 'keys,"' he says vaguely. The keys to the kingdom for Rickey proved to be amor­phous things like the way a pitcher bends his knee, the way his ~boulders point when he stretches. 
Rickey Henderson may have Olympic speed and more keys than a night watchman. But that's not what makes him the greatest thief since Bonnie & Clyde. 
What makes Rickey Henderson the Man of Steal is runaway confidence, bordering on arrogance. He doesn't believe there's a pitcher alive who can throw· the ball60 feet six inches when he's on base, and, then, have the catcher throw it 127 feet three inches in the time it takes him to dash 90 feet. 
The proof is all on his side. If you read the record books, you will find that once a pitcher has let go ofthe ball Rickey Henderson has a 91 percent chance of success. 
Henderson has no fear offailure, anyway. Recently in Anaheim, he got picked off in the frrst inning, and thrown out in the second and sixth, once on a pitchout. When he got on base in the ninth inning, he promptly took off for -and stole -second. Rickey is like that World War I flying' ace. He comes out of the burning wreckage -and goes right back up in the sky in anoth­er rickety craft. 
· The first study ofa base-stealer is to get on base. The baseball axiom for it is, "You can't steal second from the

dtJgout." Rickey Henderson gets on base more than anyone in the game. He comes with first base like the straps. Every time you look up, Henderson is on it. At the end of July, he had failed to get on base only 10 games of the season. He had almost 90 walks, an astonishing statistic which makes you wonder if the American League pitchers read the papers. Giving Rick­ey Henderson a base-on-balls is lke giving him a triple, like giving a fox a chicken to take care of. A pitcher has little to lose throwing him strikes, particularly since he's a lead-off man. 
Still, it's not that easy. Henderson has a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart. There's hardly room for a baseball in it. There's hardly room for a key. Rickey at the plate appears to be trying to stand on his head, or put his feet in his back pocket at the same time. He looks like a guy squeezing himself into a trunk, or a suit three sizes too small. "He walks like Babe Ruth," Sparky Anderson once complained. Indeed, Ruth's single-season record of 170 walks is almost reachable for Henderson. "A walk is as good as a hit," is the ancient sandlot addage. In Rickey's case, it's better: it's as good as a two-base hit. 
Henderson feels his edge is acceleration. "I get out of first gear in two or three steps," he feels. Others feel the edge is attitude, not aptitude; philosophy, not velocity. Like the putter who wills his ball in the hole by envisioning it there, Henderson sees himself standing on second dusting himself off by the time the ball gets there. "I always felt if I started to steal secon&, I had an 85 percent chance of making it," Maury Wills, the first man ever to steal 100 bases, once wrote. "But, if I was stuck with the slightest inkling ofdoubt, the odds went down to 60 percent. And those aren't good odds at all." 
Henderson doesn't feel they can really catch him, un­less they install burglar alarms. Meanwhile, they tell the story, probably apocryphal, ofAngel Owner Gene Autry coming in the press room and inquiring of Henderson, "Well, did he steal anything tonight?" And the answer came back: "I don't know. Have you checked your horse today?" 
Copyrlgbt Los Angeles Ttmes S)'ndicate, 1982 
Henderson steals four but A'sstilllose 
MILWAUKEE ( AP) -Rickey Henderson swiped four bases to break Lou Brock's major league record for stolen bases in a single season, but Jim Gantner's two­run single in the bottom of the eighth lifted the Mil­waukee Brewers to a 5-4 win over the Oakland A's last night. 
Doc; Medich, 9-11, allowed only four hits over eight innings and Rollie Fingers pitched the ninth inning to earn his 29th save. ·

Rev. E~und P.Joyce, C.S.C. ­A 1937 Notre Dame graduate, Fr. Joyce was appointed executive vice president of the University in 1952, just three years after his ordination. As Chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics, Joyce main­tains, "First things come first, and the first thing for.us are academics. I tell every squad of athletes that when the students return to campus each fall." 
Gene. Corrigan Since succeeding the legendary Moose Krause as athletic director in 1981, Corrigan already has made his presence felt. He has been in­strumental in the planning and or­ganization ofNotre Dame's first-ever athletic endowment fund, which will increase opportunities for all Notre Dame students at all levels of competition. Corrigan also is credited with the introduction of two new varsity sports -lacrosse and women's swimming -in his first full year as athletic director. Before coming to Notre Dame, Cor· rigan was responsible for the rapid growth ofthe athletic department at the University of Virginia during his nine years as director of athletic 
orograms. 
Gene Corrigan 

Edward W. "Moose" Krause­Tacking the word "emeritus" onto the title he owned for 31 years hasn't changed this cigar-smoking, story· telling administrator one bit. Asai:h._.­letic director emeritus, Krause continues to be an integral part of the Fighting Irish as he has been for over half a century. Now 69, Krause played for Knute Rockne in 1930 and was a regular tackle during the 1931, '32 and '33 campaigns. Notre Dame's first two-sport All-American, Krause was honored not only for his gridiron ~excellence, but as a basket· ball center as well. He was so dominant in the middle that basket· ball's three-second rule was adopted to control him. At present, Krause is quite active in fund-raising activities for the University athletic endow­ment fund. 
Col. John Stephens -He used to call himself, "Moose's office boy," but as associate athletic director, Jack Stephens is far more than that. After graduating from the t;he Uni­
versity of iowa, Stephens received-a 
master's degree in guidance 
counseling from Notre Dame. 
Following his voluntary retirement 
as commanding officer of the Uni­
versity's Army ROTC unit in 1968, 
"The Colonel" was named assistant 
athletic. directQr .and assumed his 
present position in 1976. He also 
serves as a director of the Walter 
Camp Football Foundation.

~ Roger Valdiserrl -Following his 1954 graduation from Notre Dame, Valdiserri served briefly as an administrative assistant to Fighting Irish head football coach Terry Brennan. In 1966, after public rela­tions stints at Mercedes-Benz and the Kansas City Chiefs, he returned to his alma mater to become sports information director and ten years later added assistant athletic die· tor to his duties. Regarded as one of the best in his field, Valdiserri has received 37 awards over the past six years !rom the College Sports In· formation Directors of America for his sports publications, m.any regarded as the best in the nation.

Dr. Tom Kelly-As director of non-varsity athletics, Kelly oversees one of the nation's most extensive intramural programs for a university the size of Notre Dame. Since there are no fraternities or sororities here, dorm life and its accompanying spirit fill the bill, and this enthusiasm is often seen in interhall competi· tion. Kelly received his masters de­gree in physical education from Penn State and his masters and Ph. D. in Educational Administration from Notre Dame. After 11 years as NVA's assistant director, Kelly was elevated to his present post in the

Astrid Hotvedt -Since becom-­ing coordinator of women's ath­letics at Notre Dame in 1974, just two years after the University began admitting women, Hotvedt has over­seen the program's growth from its infancy. Currently, Irish women ath­letes in a number of sports compete at varying levels of competition, including several in Division I. A 1969 Eastern Michigan graduate, Hotvedt received her master's de­gree from EMU in 1972. She then served as women's gymnastics coach ~t Illinois before coming to Notre Dame. 
Sharon Petro -The chairman of the physical education department is always one of the first faces an incoming freshman sees at Notre Dame, since phys ed is a required part of the freshman curriculum (except ROTC students). Petro was appointed to her present position a year ago, but she certainly is no stranger to the Notre Dame com­munity. Like Hotvedt, she also did graduate work at EMU, earning her master's in 1976. Beginning her sixth year at Notre Dame, Petro · served as women's tennis coach during the 1977 and '78 seasons before deciding to devote herself full-time to her basketball coaching dutic:;s. She had been serving double duty for two years. After the bas~et­ball team was elevated to Division I status, Petro left the ACC and returned to the Courtney Courts to coach tennis once again. 
Erin Murphy -In her third year at Saint Mary's, Murphy serves as director of athletics and recreation. A graduate of Lewis University in Joliet, Ill., she has served as assistant director of athletics and recreation and volleyball coach for SMC since 1979. Along with supervision of the college's intramural, club and var­sity programs, Murphy continues her volleyball coaching duties. Murphy plans "to refine and perfect 
the programs that we have now at all three levels. I want the community to take advantage ofthe facilities and programs we have available," and wants SMC's Angela Athletic Facility to be used for recreation and leisure as well as competitive sports. 
Timothy J. Dillon -With degrees from Slippery Rock State College, and Eastern Kentucky Uni· versity and experience as a Division I gymnastics coach at EKU, Dillon views athletics "as a part of educa· tion." Dillon is the assistant director of athletics and recreation for SMC under Murphy. Dillon will work to "get some unity through the whole community and get the program to a point where it's recognized by Saint Mary's College as a useful part ofthe college curriculum."

Kotar tumor found malignant 
NEWARK, N.j. (AP)-Doug Kotar, the retired New York Giants running back, has a malignant brain tumor, pathology tests revealed yesterday. 
Doctors suspected the 31-year­old Kotar's tumor was malignant Tuesday after performing eight hours of surgery. Their preliminary findings were confirmed yesterday when laboratory analyses were com­pleted. 
"The pathology specimen report shows a malignant tumor," said Jenita McDaniel, an assistant ad­ministrator at the hospital ofthe Uni­versity of Medicine and Dentistry of NewJersey. 
"The probable source of treat­ment will be a form of radiation therapy,'' McDaniel said. She said she was unable to elaborate on what type of treatment would be used. 
Kotar, who was listed in guarded condition, has regained conscious­ness in the hospital's intensive care unit. 
Only family members were allowed to see him. The orders were enforced so strictly that even Giants owner Wellington Mara was turned away when he visited the hospital. 
The Giants have said that even though Kotar, the fourth-leading rusher in club history, is retired, they will provide the former Univer­sity of Kentucky standout with the best care they can. 
McDaniel and Giants spokesman Ed Croke said they did not know whether Kotar has been told of the seriousness ofhis condition. 
Neither neurosurgeon Roger Countee, who performed the sur­gery on Kotar, nor Giants or­thopedic specialist Kim Sloan, who assisted, could be reached for com­
ment yesterday. 
Doctors had said they were hoping to remove the tumor, but when they operated, they found a large mass shrouded in the center of the brain and concluded that to remove it would jeopardize his life. 
Kotar retired from the Giants last month because the separated right shoulder he suffered last season had not healed completely. 
The tumor was discovered last week when Kotar sought treatment for headaches that began after he was kicked in the head in a swim­ming pool.

By The Associated Press 
It's still the exhibition season, but Coach Ray Perkins of the New York Giants is planning to use his first string into the third quarter in tonight's game against the New York Jets, who have beaten the Giants six straight times. 
''I'd be lying if I said it wasn't sig­nificant," said Perkins, who has been at the helm for four of the losses. "I hate to lose -especially against somebody we haven't beaten. That still don't mean I'm going to go at it at all cost. I'm not going to go crazy. I can still keep it in perspective. It's still a pre-season game." 
Coach Walt Michaels of the Jets is unbeaten in the six National Foot­ball League encounters between the two rivals. Only once have they met in regular season during the streak. Overall, the Jets lead the regular season series 2-1 and have an edge in the pre-season, 7-5-1. 
"I'm treating it like it's the third pre-season game," said Michaels. "I'm trying to get people ready for the regular season." 
He pointed out, however, that he would rely heavily on veterans for a half or three-quarters of the game, which is being played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
For the Giants, winless in two pre­season starts, Scott Brunner and Phil Simms continue their battle for the No. I quarterback job. TheJets, who split two exhibitions, will count on quarterback Richard Todd for three quarters ofaction. 
In other games tonight, it's Detroit at Cincinnati, San Francisco at San Diego, Cleveland at New Or­leans, Seattle at the Los Angeles Rams, New England at Dallas, Miami at Kansas City, St. Louis at Chicago, Minnesota at Denver, Tampa Bay at Houston and Baltimore at Pitts­burgh. 
Tomorrow night, the Los Angeles -formerly Oakland . -Raiders make their debut in their new home, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, against the Green Bay Packers. 
Cincinnati, the AFC champion but winless in two pre-season starts, will be relying on its aerial game against Detroit, 1-1, which has moved Horace King into holdout Billy Sims' tailback spot. 
Super Bowl champion San Fran­cisco, 1-1, hopes to get more good work from tight end Eason Ramson, injured much of last season, against the high-powered Chargers. Ram­son, backup to Russ Francis, has made six grabs for 48. yards in the two pre-season games. · San Diego also stands 1-1.

future: 

September 18 -Notre Dame football vs. Michigan, in the first night game in the 52-year existence ofNotre Dame Stadium. Unless you've been on drugs for the past year, you've no doubt heard all about this one. Even if you didn't know, you had to at least wonder why those funny-looking things that look like giant fly-swatters were doing hovering over the stadium the past two days. ABC will televise this historic event in prime time; translated, that means more exposure to potential recruits and, of course, more money. If things go smoothly, this may open a Pandora's Box full of pos­sibilities for the future ofthe NCAA on TV. 
September 24 -Notre Dame soccer at Indiana. Since gaining varsity status in 1977, Coach Rich Hun­ter's teams have surprised many with their immediate success. Each season, Hunter uses the .match with always-tough Indiana as a yardstick of the soccer -quite an accomplishment, indeed. Now it's time to take on the big boys, er ... I mean, big girls. Louisiana Tech is the reigning NCAA champion, and has lost just once in its last 65 or so games entering this season. At this stage of development, a win for the Irish is not necessary; something much more important is at stake here. This game, on a Friday night when the men's team is out of town, will be a good indication as to just how widely-accepted women's basketball is, or isn't, at Notre Dame. If the usual paltry crowd of 100 shows up that night, even withfree admission, Mary D. will know that she still has a ways to go and more than a few sexist minds to change. 
All ofthis is just for starters, and there are bound to be many other highlights and lowlights as the year progresses. 
But one thing's for sure. Ifyou're looking for exciting sports action, you've come to the right place. 
Sports facilities --something for everyone

The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses have the facilities for al­most every athletic event im­aginable. Whether you are a fierce competitor, a physical fitness buff, or just a casual weekend athlete, you should find the facilities necessary to keep you satisfied. 
The Rockne Memorial Building, located at the west end of the South Quad, is the center of Notre Dame's physical education program. The huge brick structure contains bas­ketball courts, handball-qcquetball
.. courts, a weight room, a light ap­paratus room, a swimming pool, and the golfpro shop. Use ofthe facilities in "The Rock" is reserved for all Notre Dame students and faculty membe<S upon presentation of a University ID card. Closing time is 11 p.m. daily.

Outdoor basketball is a popular pastime during fall and spring. There are several outdoor courts available for student use. Two courts are located behind Lyons Hall, two be­hind the Hammes Bookstore, and eight in front ofStepan Center. All of these courts are the sites of the early rounds of Notre Dame's legendary Bookstore Basketball Tournament, which sweeps the campus during the spring.

127 games, 26 less than Brock needed when he stole 118 with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1974. 
Henderson walked on four pitches with two out in the third against Brewers' starter Doc Medich. Medich threw four pickoff attempts at first ba~e. twice almost catching Henderson as he dived back into the base. 
Then, on the first pitch to A's third baseman Wayne Gross, Henderson broke for second. The Brewers, an­ticipating the steal attempt, called a pitchout. 
Catcher Ted Simmons released the ball quickly but his throw to shortstop Robin Yount was slightly to the right ofsecond base. Hender­son was called safe by umpire Mike

Many m me crowd of more than 35,000, realizing they had just wit­nessed history, rose to their feet and applauded Henderson. Several ofthe Brewer players, including Medich and Simmons, extended their hands to Henderson after he got to his feet and pulled the second base bag from its moorings. Henderson held the bag high in a triumphant gesture. 
The game was held up for a few minutes as photographers rushed onto the field. The second base bag was formally presented to Hender­son by Brock in ceremonies at home plate. 
Henderson, successful in 75 per­cent of his steal attempts this year, tied the record in the first inning of Thursday night's game. A pickoff throw by Brewers' left-handed pitcher Mike Caldwell trapped Hen­derson a good 1 0 feet off first base. 
Henderson later added to his record when he stole second again in the sixth. 
MILWAUKEE (AP)-Rickey Hen­derson of the Oakland A's stole his way into the baseball record book last night when he swiped second base in the third inning for his 119th steal of the season in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers to break Lou Brock's major league, single-season mark.
