Tylenol stops production of capsules after death 
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ. · The maker ofTylenol announced yester­day It will no longer produce over­the-counrer medication in capsules, nine days after cynadide­conuminated capsules ldUed a woman and more than three years after they ldUed seven people in Il­linois. 
"We feel the company can no longer guarantee the safety of these capsules," said James Burke, chair­man ofjohnson &Johnson. 
The announcement came as a team of Investigators went to Pen­nsylvania to trace the path of the Tylenol capsules taken by a woman who died in suburban New York City on Feb. 8. 
The 1982 cyanide-poisoning deaths of seven people in IUinols also were blamed on tainted Tylenol capsules. 
Burke urged people to switch to coated oval-shaped tablets known as caplets, and said Johnson &Johnson would replace free any capsules consumers or stores now possess.

Readers all over the world can see Notre Dame senior Carl Gebo In a place usually reserved for bikini-clad beauties: the Sports Il­lustrated swimsuit issue. 
Gebo, a Notre Dame cheer­leader and Army ROTC cadet, is featured in a fuU-page adverstise­ment for the Army ROTC scholar­ship program which appears or will appear In 10 Issues of 8 na­tional magazines, including Sports Illustrated, Sport, Popular Science, People and Newsweek. 
The Howard Hall resident said he was one of nine cadets chosen at the Army Junior summer camp at Fort Louis, Washington, to ha.ve their pictures taken for promo­tlonalliterature.

He found out in December that the ad would appear in the swim­suit issue. 
"I really don't know what criteria they used to decide who to use In the ad," Gebo said, but he guessed that the choice was based upon his extracurricular activities, 
an  interview  conducted  at  the  
camp  photo  sessions  and  his  
photogenic qualities.  

An inset photo in the ad shows Gebo with several Notre Dame cheerleaders. Gebo said he and the cheerleaders were paid S1 to sign a release allowing the pictures to be used. 
Gebo said the ad tries to show that "even though you're a mem­ber ofArmy ROTC, you don't miss out on other college experiences." 
" 'For me, an Army ROTC scholarship Isn't making college any easier. It's making coUege pos­sible,' " he says in the ad. 
Two other cadets from other schools, who are also heavily in­volved with extracurricular ac­tivities, were chosen to appear in similar ads in different magazines, he said. 
Colonel Robert Skinner, com­mander of the Fighting Irish Army ROTC Battalion, said Gebo was chosen from approximately I 0,000 senior cadets. 
The University was paid a "legal buck," SI, for the right to use the "ND" symbol in the ad, Skinner said. 
He said the advertisement ap­pears In magazines that the Army's market survey indicated are read by high school seniors. Army ROTC, he said, is looking for stu­dents like Gebo who are athletl­caUy and academicaUy inclined.

Restructuring plan presented to senate 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
Senior Staff Reporter 
A proposal for a new student government constitution was presented by members of the Com­mittee on Restructuring to the stu­dent senate last night. 
According to the proposed constitution, the governing body of Notre Dame student government will be the student senate. The proposed senate would consist of a single representative from each dorm, with the exception of Grace and Flllnner which would have two, and two off campus senators. The student body president will chair the senate but will only vote in the case of a tie. The student body vice president would be a nonvoting member ofthe senate. 
John Spatz, senior class president, said he thinks representatives from the classes should be on the senate. "You need more distribution of representation," he said. I think it's lmportllnt that we (the classes) have more say and input into what's hap­pening." 
Under the bylaws of the proposed constitution six standing commit­tees would be esublished under the direction of the senate to carry out much ofthe senate's work. A finance and budget committee would be es­tablished to allocate student funds. A 
Mary Ann O'Donnell, dean ot stu­dent affairs at Saint Mary's, explained the reason for no direct reference to sex and sexuality in the ·Student Handbook. Sex is difficult to address in the form of rules, according to O'Donnell. 
"We feel that it is the respon­sibility of the students. They can decide for themselves," said O'Donnell, stating that the policy at Saint Mary's deals with education rather than regulation. 
"Saint Mary's has always prided it-

Student Concerns Committee would "formulate policy and direct action on matters that concern acedemic and societal problems which will affect student life," ac­cording to the proposed constitu­tion. 
Under the proposal, a Student Activities Board Steering Commit­tee would determine social programming and a Rules Commit­tee would intrepret the constitu­tion. An Executive Communications Committee would est2bllsh a chan­nel of communication between leaders of various student interests. 
In addition, under the proposal, a Campus Ufe Committee, composed of eight senators would formulate policy and direct action on matters that concern student resldenrlalllfe. Hall President's Council Chlllrman Kevin Howard said he thought eight senators is too many people on the committee. Howard said that a com­mittee of eight won't be able to get anything done. Howard suggested a two member committee would be more effective. "They will get much more done," he said. 
If the senate adopts the new con­stitution then it must be passed by two-thirds of the Hall President's Council or a two-thirds vote of the student body.

She said, adding that experts In each field have spoken on three

In Brief 
M1V, the cable music channel, has stopped using NASA footage ofthe space shuttle blastingoffas part ofits logo in the wake of the Challenger disaster. For the first week after the tragedy, MTV left the logo on the air as a statement of support for space exploration along with a statement by MTV's "VJ"s extending the network's sympathies to the families of the seven astronauts killed in the Challenger fireball. But network executives soon decided it was "too painful to use" and have replaced it with an interim logo, a menagerie ofanimated MTV promos, and a message from MTV's general manager explaining why it has been replaced. ·

Nobody likes to make mistakes. 

Especially a newspaper, which prides itself on ac­curacy and getting it right the first time. Indeed, be­cause . a newspaper does pride itself on accuracy, making a mistake hurts all the more. 
Yet a newspaper, like all human institutions, does make mistakes. Speakers can be misquoted, information misunderstood and names misspelled. 
When a mistake is made in a story, it reflects on that section ofthe newspaperand the newspaper as a whole. 
Ifa name is misspelled in a news story, for example, it hurts the credibility of not just the news department, but the sports, editorial and features departments as well. After all, when one fact is wrong in a story, how can the reader be sure that the rest of the story is ac­curate? Or the rest ofthe paper? 
Thus, once a mistake does appear, the newspaper has to admit it. In print. 
And it hurts. Running a correction can be comparable to standing in front of an auditorium packed with people and admitting that what you told them yester­day was wrong. For papers like the Wall Street Journal, Detroit Free Press or Chicago Tribune more than a half a million people are in that "auditorium." For The Observer, approximately 12,000 are there. 
Because corrections call attention to newspapers' mistakes, many of those in that "auditorium" focus on the aspect of error in that correction rather than the correction itself. In other words, instead of viewing corrections as evidence of a newspaper's commitment to accuracy, some readers unconsciously focus on that newspaper's occasional mistakes. 
Ironically then, while corrections should help a newspaper's credibility, corrections inadvertantly may be hurting it. 
Public opinion polls on the credibility of different media may provide indirect evidence ofthis. According to one such poll in 1980, a majority of Americans said that when they receive conflicting stories from televi­sion and newspaper reports, they give more credit to the television's account ofthe events. 
This might have something to do with television newscasts rarely, ifever, admitting to mistakes they've made the day before. Ofcourse it may be that television reporters never make mistakes. More than likely, however, it's because viewers would switch stations if every other night they heard the anchorman say, "Sorry about this folks, but last night we made a mistake in 
1la*sto you... it works... 

Mark Pankowski 
Assistant News Editor 
saying ...." 
So newscasts have good reason for not admitting to their mistakes, ifin fact they do make them. And by not airing corrections, that might just be enough to give television newscasts the edge over newspapers in the credibility department. 
Yet responsible newspapers continue to run correc­tions. And they do so primarily for two reasons. The first is the simple fact that when a newspaper 
makes a mistake, usually someone knows about it, and he or she makes sure the newspaper knows about it too. Sometimes in rather strong terms. If the newspaper then doesn't run a correction, that person is sure to tell others. Or rue a lawsuit. 
Once enough mistakes run without next-day cor· rections, then, that paper eventually loses its credibility, its readers, and its money. 
The other reason is much more idealistic, and impor· tant: a newspaper's commit· ment to accuracy and truth. 
A newspaper must go out ofits way to get the most ac­curate information possible. 
This of course means getting the facts right the first time. But when the facts aren't right the first time, it means admitting the mistake with a correction the next day. 
And readers must help that newspaper. They must try to focus on the newspaper's commitment to accuracy when it has to run corrections rather than its occas· sional mistakes. 
After all, when a newspaper prints corrections, readers shouldn't worry about that paper's commit· ment to truth and accuracy. It's when a newspaper stops printing corrections when readers should start to worry.

Food services director receives 'silver plate' 
By DAVID T. LEE 
NewsSmff 
Under the leadership of Director of University Food Services William Hickey, the dining halls may have to expand their trophy case:. 
Hickey has been awarded the Sil­ver Plate Award from the Interna­tional Foodservlce Manufacturers Association. 
"(It is) the most exciting profes­sional citation I've ever received in my life," said Hickey. "My family and I are dated." 
He: gave credit to "creativity, in­novativc:nc:ss, pride in the work we do," and pointed to a "routine that's offilet. . . creating special theme nights." 
"(Food Services) tries to cover every aspect of student dining," Hickey said. He pointed to such features as an excellent salad bar and the: c:ver·prc:sc:nt variety ofcereals. 
Suffering a heart attack two years ago, Hickey showed a healthy ap­preciation of the: nutritional value of food. "Everyone has healthy food available." He pointed to examples of low cholesterol fish and high car­bohydrate pasta. 
Hickey said, however, he sees "nothing different" from dining hall service last year. 

The International Food Service Manufacturers Association awards eight Silver Plate Awards from various categories of service. These include secondary schools, hospi­tals, hotels, public institutions, military, fast service and full service restaurants, and colleges, of which Hickey represents the last. 
Hickey said he will receive his medal at a banquet in Chicago on May 19. In addition, one person will receive the Gold Plate Award, which is the highest honor bestowed by the food service industry. Hickey, who noted that no college has won the award since 1955, is extremely doubtful he will receive this coveted honor. 
Although aware of the "dissatisfaction of students", Hickey said "students... (are) very impor­tant to us." "I wish students would try to compare our food service with other food services."

The senate will consider adopting 

the constitution proposal at a 
meeting tomorrow. 
Judicial Coordinator Karen In­

gwersen and Student Activities 
Board Manager Lee Broussard said 
they think it will be difficult to ap­
prove a new constitution before the 
upcoming student government elec­
tions, scheduled for March 4. They 
suggested that the senate take the 
next month to consider the 
proposed constitution and then 
have it take effect in April 1987. "If 
we decided tonight to make it come 
into effect a year from now then we 
will have more time to work on 
this," said Broussard. 
Off-Campus senator Jim Hagan disagreed with Ingwersen and Broussard. "I think the longer we delay, the worse things get. I think we need a strong, centralized stu­dent government right away," he said. It's like putting off chemot­herapy for another year." 
Jim Domagalski, junior class presi­dent, also said he didn't think putting off ratification of the con­stitution was wise. 
The senate compromised by res­cheduling the date for student government tors. elections to March 
11. The delay will give the senate more time to consider the constitu­tion and allow potential candidates more time to make a decision about running, said Senator K.C. Culum.

separate occasions. 
Should a student become preg­
nant, O'Donnell said they would not 
be suspended or expelled from 
school. 
O'Donnell concluded, "It should 
be remembered, however, that Saint 
Mary's strictly enforces a social con­
duct code which prohibits male 
visitation before or after the 
designated parietal hours," 
Patricia Rissmeyer, director of residence life and housing, outlined Saint Mary's philosophy on sex and sexuality. 
"I think what is most imponant to Saint Mary's is to graduate students who have developed a conscience. I think our approach to rules and regulations is to have students decide their own conscience and make their own decisions on impor­tant issues. 
"The RAs and residence hall staff are qualified to discuss issues about sex and sexuality. If a student has a decision then she can discuss the pros and cons with them in a Cat­holic context," said Rissmeyer. 
"When a student graduates, we hope she can make decisions that she can live with. That's what we want to send our students out into the world to do," she said. 
Rissmeyer also told of the sexuality education program in­itiated at Saint Mary's to help inform 
making Tylenol capsules after Diane Elsroth's death, and Burke had said Friday that resumption of produc­tion would depend on consumer surveys and the investigation of the tamperings. 
The replacement program will cost the company an estimated n 50 million, he said. But he said that does not compare with the suffering of, the family of Elsroth, who had taken cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. 
The future ofcapsule medications was called into question after Elsroth died and a second bottle students. Its purpose is to aid in 
responsible decision-making based 
on sound knowledge ofall aspects of 
the issue. 

Repeated attempts to contact 
John Goldrick, Notre Dame as­
sociate vice president for residence 
life, were unsuccessful. Sister Jean 
Lenz, assistant vice president for stu­
dent affairs, said that Goldrick deals 
with violations of the rules and she 
could not speak for him. 

Father Edward Malloy, associate 
provost and assistant professor of 
theology at Notre Dame, discussed 
the University's attitude towards sex 
and sexuality. 

"The basic philosophy is reg­
ulated by the trustees. Notre Dame 
defines itself as a Catholic institution 
and it respects the tradition from

F
ather Hesburgh's sense ofhumor 
is a well-kept secret here at 
Notre Dame. Just look at du Lac. 
Pretty funny, huh? Sorry, the joke's 

on you. Uke It says in"The Ab· 
solutely, Positively Very Last Notre 
DameJoke Book," "What's black 

and white and living-ln-the-40s all 
over? duLac." DuLac may well be 
the handbook that Is used for all the 
practical jokes that go on here. 
I'm not talking about the cosmic practical jokes that the universe plays on us with mathematics, or Casey Kasem, or even those McDL T "Hand-Warmin'" commercials. No, these are jokes thought up by some power (this may be hard for some ofyou to believe )even greater than the people under the Dome. 
Despite the fact that they really aren't the Omnipotent Proprietors ofthe Entire Universe that they pass themselves off to be, being at Notre Dame, one experiences some pretty clever practical jokes. Come with me as we uncover the Horrible and Nasty Practical Joke Conspiracy going on right under our noses. 
Ethanol. Uterally, right under our noses. This one is kind oflike that stink perfume that you can buy in Spencer's only on a much larger scale. Remember how funny It was to sprinkle that stuff on your best friend's sister when you were In fifth grade? Imagine the rollicking hilarity to be had from dousing an entire college campus In the stuff. 
Gerry Faust. I picture a member of the administration and his cronies sluing around some Friday night five years ago with a boule of Peach Schnapps and a bandolier of grenades trying to dunk midgets in McDonald's Secret Big Mac sauce. Around 2:30a.m., someone burped and he was suddenly hit with In­spiration. "Hey! I've got it! Wouldn't it be hilarious if we hired a high school coach?" Ofcourse, he knew the dangers of practical joking when he started. 
The Dining Halls. The jokes being played in the dining halls lean more toward the traditional. 
There's the "Eggplant Grinder." The trick brown bowls that are so hot that they evaporate yogurt always get me. And which one ofus hasn't stood by stifling our glee while some hapless friend or freshman unknowingly tried to actually eat 
one ofthose rubber biscuits? Whoever originally came up with the masterstroke ofstaffing the dining halls with renegades from Willy Wonka's Oompa-Loompa Land and outcasts from the Far Side is deserving ofsome kind of Practi­calJoke Ufetime Achievement Award. 
My Hall. Okay, I admit that it might have been a mistake telling the Admissions people that I was "a simple, !!ensitive country boy, who likes quiet music, good friends, fresh strawberries, and rainy days." It was a deplorable, vile lie. But did they have to punish me so per­manently? They put me right down the hall from a couple ofpsychos who enjoy racing up and down the hallways at light speed from suo­down to sunup, screeching loudly 
like chipmunks sucking helium. 
When those two are busy hiding from the sun, the-six-and-a-half-foot 
kickboxer next door usually has his atomic-powered stereo turned up so loud that it registers on the Rich­ter Scale. The novelty ofour R.A.; a blind, Air Force ROTC leper, wore off in two or three weeks. Then there are the wretched water grem­lins living in the walls near the showers who wait for me to let my guard down in the shower before turning up the heat levels of the water so high that three layers of skin are instantly vaporized off my Inner thigh. Funny stuff. And to top it all off, I think someone Is stealing my Kleenex. 


The Phone System. This Is a twist on the classic "Have you got Prince Albert In a can?" phone prank from everyone's childhood. I'm sure that all the Big Guys over In the Administration Building giggle like gleeful maniacs when they think about the phones here. My roommate noted astutely that one could conceivably walk to St. Mary's In the time It takes to get a phone connection over there. Then ofcourse there are the "trick" con­nections that I keep stumbling Into. Is it me? Do I have a demon phone or what? I'll pick up the phone and suddenly I'm listening Into some stranger's secret and Intimate con­versation. 
''Have you got Prince Albert in a can?'' 
Guy: You drive me mad with desire. 
Girl: Uh ...me too. 
Me (disguising my voice): but you look like Babe Ruth on acid. 
Guy: What? Me? 
Girl: Did you say that? 
Me (disguising my voice): No, my darling, you have the shins ofan eighty-year-old Zulu tribesman. 
Then I hang up. 
So that's it. These are but a few of 
the practical jokes that Notre Dame has played on me and I'm sure on you too. One that I didn't mention was the whole College Scene Facade. Sure,l saw "Animal House" in high school. I figured that's what college should be: wild parties, lots ofbeer, pretty girls surrounding me at all hours, mustard smeared all over my body and an endless soundtrack ofgreat music. 
So when does the Administration come up with a rock and roll policy?

Dollmaker strives for originality 
Associated Press 
MEDFORD, Ore. Some artists paint, create pottery or put words on paper. Theresa McQuiston Robinson makes dolls. She's created be-tween 2,000 and 3,000 of them in the last I 0 years, for people all over the United States and in several foreign countries. 
She creates quietly behind the counter of the shop at which she works, the Calico Junction in Jack­sonviUe, as well as at home.. 
"It started as a home business," she says. "From there it just blossomed." 
Robinson attributes part of her success to timing. She got interested in making dolls in the early 1970s, "before C~bbage. Patch," and before national interest in sewn dolls "became ln." 
Uving In the San Francisco Bay area at the time, she tried ex­perimenting with making a few dolls. A friend took a couple of the dolls to work with her and showed them to her co-workers. Robinson suddenly started to get orders. Her work became known by word of mouth. 
Her dolls sold in shops in Be-verly Hills and Santa Monica, often for as much as S600 each. She made: dolls worked at the CalicoJunction for six years. 
for  Disney  World  and  Universal  
Studios.  
Robinson  moved  to  the  Rogue  
Valley  eight  years  ago  and  has  

At one point, she was commls· sioned to create 12 patterns for dolls. The problem, she says, is that there is no money In creating doll patterns "unless you own the com· pany." 
Robinson now prefers to take someone else's pattern and do some· thing creative with it. If you compare her doll with the pattern from which it came, you'll notice ob­vious dltferences. 
"I always try to make them dif· ferent," she says. "My main trademark is hair." She works with each doll to make an elaborate hair style. 
How long does It take to make a doll? the average is about six hours, Robinson says. Hers vary In size from nine to 36 inches. 
Around the Rogue Valley, making dolls is not so lucratl~. An average creation ofhers goes for about 130, a far cry from the 1600 one might fetch in Beverly Hills. But she Is con­tent to work at those prices. 
Walk Into the CalicoJunction and you see a number of dolls, amon~t them a grandma doll and an angel doll that are much admired by brow­sers. The grandma doll led to the in­vitation to create those 12 pat-terns. 

You also see quilts and pillows that Robinson creates. "I always try to do some-thing out ofthe ordinary," she says. 
Besides creating her own dolls, Robinson also teaches others how to dolt. 
"I love teaching," she says. "It's fun to make a doll but even more fun to watch a student you've taught make one." 
Besides classes at the store, she has taught at Ashland High Schoo1 and Everyone's U at Southern Oregon State College. She has taught for the last seven to eight years and estimates 700 students have learned from her. Some are now her com­petitors, in a sense. 
Abit ofadvice Robinson gives !'ltu· dents is to sign and date each doll they create. Antique -dolls are popular In exhibits In museums. Today's dolls may be the museum exhibits of tomorrow, she points out. 
"One hundred years from now, sewing techniques will have changed some more," she says. "It's rewarding to see your knowledge passed on."

Citibank has many reasons for lending to Brazil 
Hey, do you want to get a job at Citibank? If you do, you should never mention in your job interview that you disagree with Citibank's credit policy towards countries like Brazil. This article is to help you understand why Citibank, among other banks, is still in love with the "Girl from Ipanema." 
Ricardo Araujo 
guest column 
Last January, authorities from the Brazilian 
government (the Finance Minister, the Plan­
ning Minister and the President ofthe Central 
Bank-the "Boys from Ipanema") visited the 
headquarters of Citibank in New York. They 
came to the United States reluctant to pay the 
world's biggest foreign debt ever-nos bil­
lion. Instead, the Brazilian authorities arrived 
in New York with hopes of borrowing more 
money from Citibank, one of Brazil's major 
creditors. 
What Brazil asked for, and got, was a short­
run credit of n 5.2 billion and a "will think 
about it" promise from the bankers about 
changing the interest rate level from the 
American prime rate to the libor rate (the rate 
paid in London's market). This change would 
save Brazil some S350 million annually, ac­
cording to Brazilian authorities. 
Like all previous meetings, the negotiations 
were long and tiresome. They were marked by remarks of skepticism on the part of Citibank negotiators, who demonstrated reluctance to lend more money to Brazil wit­hout the approval of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). yet, despite the hesita­tions expressed in the first rounds of negotia­tions,the three Brazilian authorities returned to Brazil with "their pocketsfull offresh cash." This time they got the best out ofthe negotia­tions precisely because the IMF played no role in the direct transactions between Brazil and Citibank. 
Bankers are smart, no doubt about it. They 
play only to win in this business of giving loans. Although they also make occasional mistakes, bankers score high in financial deals. Therefore, it was not the smiling and friendly faces of the three Brazilian authorities that persuaded Citiba(lk to advance more money to Brazil. The decision was undoubtedly based on the bank's optimism about the con­ditions of the Brazilian economy now and in the future. 
While it holds the fame ofbig debtor, Brazil remains the only country paying $1 billion in interest every month to all ofits creditors, wit­hout delay. Although the principal is left un­paid, one could say "who cares?" If the bankers received the principal owed them tomorrow, they would have to find somebody else to borrow the "bloody petro-dollars" that the Saudi Arabians deposited in American banks not too long ago. (The Saudis were looking for a safe place to put their money). 

As Michael Moffit, an economics consultant for Shearson-American Spress, has said, the bankers knew from the beginning that they could not get the same profit margin if they tried to lend money to made-in-USA com­panies. A company the size of Exxon, for ex­ample, can go anywhere to borrow money. Therefore, since the 1970's the bankers have largely depended on "poor" countries to make fat profits. Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Bank ofAmerica together increased their profits by 55 percent in the late seventies with transactions outside the United States. 
With Brazil, banks have a good thing going. They receive fresh payments every month from a debtor they have good reason to believe will not default. 
As a developing country, Brazil is doing very well despite the negative effects of the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks, which jeopardized the building of infra-structures (dams, bridges, roads, telecommuncations network, for example) and the industrialization ofcon­sumer and capital goods. The high cost of energy put pressure on the country to diver­sify its industrialization in order to increase its export earnings. Up until recently, 80 percent of the oil used in Brazil was imported from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). When the country used up all ofits foreign reserves, Brazil had to borrow dollars to pay the oil import bill and to finance its major industries. 
In the past five years, the tenth largest economy in the world has been struggling to restore its development process. So far, the results have been convincing. Last year Brazil had one of the highest growth rates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world-seven percent or S214.2 billion. The trade surplus reached U2.5 billion and now the country has S9 billion in foreign reserves. This trade surplus is bound to continue at this level, or higher. For the export diversification policy has made Brazil the fifth largest seller ofarms in the world and the third largest exporter of frozen chicken, among other items. 
Though the bankers are aware of the fact that Brazil has many internal problems (high inflation, unemployment, underemployment) and continues to depend largely on interna­tional markets to obtain dollars to pay the loans, they are optimistic about the future of the Brazilian economy and the political stability ofthe country's new democracy. 
Citibank's positive response to the demands of Brazil shows that this bank sees Brazil's economy as robust and dynamic. The foreign debt represents a plus for both Brazil (in regard to its development) and Citibank (in regards to its profit margin). And this is a good reason to remain in love with the "Girl from Ipanema."

Elitest attitude denying Rice a fair chance at ND 
The number 640 holds no significance in itself but seems to have come under close scrutiny over the past few days. 640 is the SAT score of football recruit Tony Rice. Many on this campus are quick to say that Rice does not belong academically at Notre Dame, that the University is lowering its standards to win football games. Before looking at that one simple number and deciding that Tony Rice does not belongat Notre Dame, consider this: 
Eric M. Bergamo 
here's to future days 
Many people believed that Vegas Ferguson did not belongat Notre Dame. 
Vegas Ferguson, one of the great players of the Dan Devine era, came to Notre Dame with academic numbers that were not much higher than Rice's. Some critics claimed that Notre Dame was lowering its high standards with the intention of winning football games. Fer­guson was accepted, and the naysayers waited for the moment that the prized recruit would 
Doonesbury 
fail in the classroom. That moment never came. 
Ferguson succeeded, both on the playing field and in the classroom. He became the all­time leading rusher with 3,472 yards and helped the Irish in their drive to the national championship in 1977. Ferguson graduated with a degree in economics in three and half years. 
Before we point the finger at Holtz and accuse him ofnot knowing the high academic standards of the University, consider that Devine knew the academic standards when he recruited Ferguson. Consider that th~ Univer­sity would not have hired Holtz if he was not aware of the academic standards that the Uni­versity demands. In Ferguson's case, the Uni­versity believed that he could succeed, with help, in the classroom. If the University did not believe that Rice has the same desire that Ferguson had, Rice would not have been ac­cepted into Notre Dame. 
As a community, we place too much of an emphasis on the SAT score. Our chances of success and offailure are gauged by one stan­dardized test. Remember that this test has

many variables involved. My sister recently took the SAT; she is very proficient in English but got an SAT that was mostly math. That dif­ference showed in the total score. One of her friends, with very high grades in math, received an SAT that was mostly English and recieved a lower total score in the end. We cannot judge a person just on his or her SAT scores, yet that is what we are doing in the case ofTony Rice. This judgment is greatly un­fair to him. We are saying, "You didn't do well on the SAT, so you don't belong here at Notre Dame." 
admittance to Notre Dame and give him the chance he deserves. Be assured that Holtz and the University know what they are doing in letting Rice come to Notre Dame as Devine and the University did in letting Vegas Fer­guson come to Notre Dame. 
Vegas Ferguson proved the critics wrong when he recieved his degree. Hopefully, Tony Rice will rise above his critics to recieve his degree. 
Eric M. Bergamo is a sophomore interna· tiona/ relations majoratNotre Dame. He is a regular Viewpoint columnist. 
This line of thinking is very dangerous, an elitest view that one who is not as academi­cally gifted as we deserves no place at Notre Dame. Tony Rice is an extremely gifted ath­lete, as some of the Notre Dame community are gifted scholars. Rice deserves a chance to prove himself in the classroom; that is what we as a community should give him. He also needs our support, both on and offthe playing field, if he is to succeed. The speculation that because of his 640 SAT score he will not succeed at Notre Dame is the last thing he needs. We should not question, but accept his

Big upset keys SMC fencing wins over weekend 
SMC swimmers end regular season with an impressive loss to Albion 
ByANDREA LaFRENffiRE 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's swim team com­pleted its regular season on Saturday in Albion, Mich., where it lost a close meet to Albion College by a score of 60-53. 
The meet was the Belles' best of the season, according to head coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz. 
"This was our most exciting meet," she said. "Everyone was all fired up for it, and the competition was keen." 
The meet's outcome is somewhat misleading, according to Kuzmitz, as Saint Mary's dominated Albion in the majority ofthe swimming events. 

"We swept pretty much each event, finishing in the one and two, one and three, and two and three seedings," she said. "We won both relays, too." 
The 400-yard freestyle relay team of seniors Anne Cushing and Joyce Murtagh, junior Patty Juckniess and sophomore Meghan Rafferty took first place with a time of 4:02.71, while the team ofJuckniess, Rafferty, junior Margaret Mannion and fresh­man Tanya Reeves finished first in

How sweet it was for the Saint Mar'y's fencing team as it went un­defeated over the weekend against California State (Pa. ), Carnegie Mel­lon, and Case Western Reserve. With the wins, the Belles raised their overall record to 12-7 this season. 
The Belles achieved their first vic­tory on Saturday when they defeated California State by a score of 9-7. There were two times in the meet when St. Mary's found itself down,

The Golden Flashes forged a tie 
with the second period's only goal at 

9:02, Aldridge once again turning on 
the red light. But Reilly, playing 

despite the. injury, got the game­
winner in the third with assists from 
Matt Hanzel and Anquillace. 
"It was a total team effort," said 
Smith. "Not any individual really 
stood out. The entire team gave 
their all. But with Reilly only playing 
on a leg and a half and Whitmore on 
an arm and a half, you really have to 
take your hat offto them."

time of2:04.69. 
Meghan Rafferty, a sophomore, placed first in the 50-yard freestyle event with a time of0:27.01. 
Cushing and Murtagh, co-captains 

for the Belles, performed especially 
well in their last collegiate meet, 
capturing first place in the 500-and 
100-yard freestyle events, 
respectively. 
"Both seniors put in a fine perfor­mance for us," Kuzmitz said. "Anne swam the 500-free in 5:59.18, and Joyce finished the 100-free in I:00.61." 
Cushing and Murtagh each had a second-place finish for the Belles, as well. Cushing swam the 1 000-yard freestyle event in 12:21.1 5, while Murtagh completed the 200-yard freestyle event in 2:07.03. 
Other second-place finishers for Saint Mary's include Rafferty, who swam the 100-yard backstroke event in 1:07.47 and}ucknless, who completed the 50-yard freestyle event in 0:27.85. 
In addition, Tanya Reeves, a fresh­man, finished the 200-yard in­dividual medley in second place with a time of 2:31.90, while Man­nion took second place in the 1 00­
once at 4-1, and again at 5-2. But determinination was key to their comeback, putting £he Belles on the winning track for the remainder of the day. 
Shannon Maughan enabled the team to pull out the upset over California State. Fencing in the last · position, she surprised her op­ponent and came away with a 3-1 record. 
"Shannon helped out a lot," said head coach Mike Weeks. "She was a standout in the meet which later led us to a victorious weekend.

The 200-yard medley relay team of junior Mary Fisher, sophomore Jennifer Veselik and freshmen Jen­nifer Burke and Anne Marie Wolf also placed second with a time of 2:16.46. 
Juckniess finished third in the 1 00-yard backstroke event, Burke placed third in the 200-yard freestyle event and Reeves took third in the 1 00-yard buttertly event. 
Saint Mary's fell behind Albion in the diving competition, where fresh­man diver Bridget Murphy's 1 I 1.25 points were not enough to surpass the totals of the three entries from Albion. 
Kuzmitz was quick to point out, however, that her team's perfor­mance was exceptional. 
"A lot of the swimmers lowered their qualifying times for Nationals, so I think we have a really strong chance ofplacing high at that meet," she said. 
Although the team's regulae season is completed, it is practicing daily in preparation for Nationals, scheduled for March 6-9 in Spokane, Wash. 
"The team never gave up. It was an important win, their best win ever." 
Saint Mary's dominated in its fol­lowing two meets against Carnegie Mellon and Case Western Reserve. The team won each bout with identical scores of I 2-4. 
Leading the Belles was captain Mary Beth Proost with a 4-2 mark. Ann Raney continued her consistant play in achieving an 8-3 record. Fol­lowing were teammates Becca Bar­nett, Maughan, and Laura Hartis with 4-2,9-2, and 5-2 decisions.

Improving ND gymnasts tripped up by Purdue 
A small but supportive crowd turned out for the ND Gymnastics Club's first home meet ofthe season. In a close battle with Purdue, both the men and women showed much Improvement, but came up short against the Boiler­makers. 
The men stayed with the Boilermakers through much of the meet, but they spotted Purdue too many points In the horse and the parallel bars. The final score was 118.6 · I 1 0. 7 In favor of the Boilermakers. 
"We definitely improved this meet," said Club President Jim Ciesil. "At the meet in Miami we lost to Purdue by 10, but this time we only lost by seven points." 
Celsil turned In one ofthe strongest performances ofthe meet In the floor exercise. His score of 8.0 was good enough for second place In that event. 
"The floor is my best routine," he said. "I still want to work on It and Iron out some ofthe bugs." 
Paul Nowak was the only gymnast to compete In the 
all-around for the Irish. His score of 39.0 for six events left 
him In second place, two-tenths ofa point behind Rob Hen­
thorn of Purdue. 
Nowak scored an Impressive 8.8 in the vault to take first place In that event. He also finished fourth in the floor ex· ercise with a score of 7.7, and he placed third In the high bar with a 6.6. 
Matt Sennett also was a key contributor to the cause, winning the high bar with a 7.4 and taking third with a strong performance on the horse. Mike Downing won the rings with a score of5.9, and Francis Sverdrup placed third in the vault with an 8.5. 
The women also stayed with Purdue the entire meet, and actually believed they would win the meet until the results from the balance beam were announced. The Boilermakers outscored the Irish in the beam by 2.3 points and won the meet, 79.4 · 76.7. 
Michelle Broussard gave another strong performance, placing second In the all-around with a score of 29.4 for four events. She won the uneven bars with a score of 7.8, and she took second In the floor exercise and in the beam. Her chances for first in the all-around were hurt when her second run on the vault was disallowed. 
MSU's Skiles will go to jail 
LANSING, Mich. · Michigan State basketball player Scott Sidles has agreed to serve 30 days in jail at the end of the college season for break­Ing probation on a drug convictior:t. a newspaper and TV station reported. 
Sidles, a senlor.guard for the Spar­tans and one of the nation's leading collegiate scorers, would serve the 30-day term at the end of the 1985· 86 season under the tentative agree­ment with Indiana authorities, according to reports Sunday by the Flint journal and WILX·TV in Lan· sing. 
Last week, Sidles' attorney, Charles Scruggs of Kokomo, Ind., said two weeks oftalks with Marshall County Prosecutor Fred jones had produced an agreement on punish· ment for Skiles. Scruggs did not say whether Skiles would spend any time In jail. 
Sidles, 21, was arrested In Plymouth In August 1984 on cocaine and marijuana charges. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of possession of marijuana, a mis· demeanor, and last April was given a one-year suspended sentence and fined SIOO.. 
Skiles also was ordered to perform 120 hours ofcommunity service and placed on one·year probation. 
Jones moved to revoke Sidles' probation after East lansing police arrested Skiles in November on drunken driving charges.

"I messed up on the run and touched the board," she said. "I thought you were safe until you touched the horse, but I guess I was wrong." 
Megan ZiUig also did well, taking third in the ftoor ex· erclsc:, the vault, and the unparallel bars. And Maureen Durkin placed fourth In the vault and fifth In the ftoor ex· erclsc:. 
"Maureen tumbled very strong," said Sandy Vanslager, an advisor to the team. "She hit her front pass which she had been practicing on this past week." 
The Purdue team was carried by one gymnast, Becky Gallagher. She placed first In every event except the un­parallel bars. 
The club now has two weeks to prepare for a triangular meet with Purdue and Miami (Ohio). Head Coach Rich John knows what It will take to beat Purdue in their third and final match. 
"We have to really work on routines in practice," he said. "We have to clean them up and keep them free of mistakes." 
 
The ND Ski team hoped to end its season on a high note this past weekend at the National Qualifying meet at Mar· queue Mountain. Instead, the note was slightly lower as the team sided well, but was unable to qualify anyone for nationals. 
Club President John O'Donovan was the top men's performer, placing In the top 20 in the giant slalom Satur· day. Chris Simonet also did well for the men. 
Against some sti.IJ competition, Kathy Skendzel took sixth in the slalom and ninth in the giant slalom, but failed to qualify for nationals. Laurie Shea and Jane Heisel also skied well. The official team results for the women's, as well a5 the men's races, were not available. 
 

Last Friday the ND women's Track Club traveled to Yp· 
silanti, Mich., to participate In the Huron Open. Julia 
Merkel was very impressive, taking fourth in the 1500 and 
seventh In the 1000. 
"Julia ran a fantastic meet," said head coach Dan Ryan. 
"The 1500 and the 1000 Is a tough double." 
Personal bests were recorded by Maureen O'Leary In the 
500-meter run and by Nancy Loughlin in the 1500-meter 
run. And the 1600-meter relay team of Merkel, O'Leary, 
Christine Dragani, and Kathleen Lehman chopped almost 
eight seconds off their previous best time. 
'I worked them really hard up to the race," said Ryan. "I didn't expect great times, but they surprised me, especially Julia." 
The team will finish up Its season at Ann Arbor, Mich., this weekend as It participates In the Sllverston Invitational track meet. 
 

You can say it was tests or illness, but Ed Abt has the real explanation for the Volleyball Club's play In the three matches at the ACC this past week. 
"We played like····," said the club President. 
On Wednesday, the Irish dropped the match to Calvin College (not to be confused with Calvin Coolidge) after winning the first two games. Friday's match against Purdue appeared to be headed for the same result, as Notre Dame took the first two games and dropped the third and fourth. But the Irish held on to win the fifth game and the match. 
Saturday afternoon the team won the first game against Wisconsin, and was up 14-11 In the second, but ended up dropping the second game, 16-14, and losing the match in four games. 
Things can only get better, right? They had better for the sake of the team because Notre Dame must face Ball State and Ohio State, both top-20 teams.

The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team has received important production from its freshman class this season, and one of those young impact players has been 5-9 guard Diondra Toney. "She has made a successful transi­ man-to-man defense, and now I ac­tually enjoy it. "In our defense, you are not al­ways on your man, but you have to keep an eye on the ball and on the man.

"She stayed with me when I had trouble adjusting. She would put no pressure on me, saying 'relax and do what you do best.' Recruiting was an educational ex­

As is the case with most freshman, the conversion to the collegiate game was difficult at the beginning. "In high school we were in shape, but here the players are so physical, and I had to really get on the weights and build stamina," said Toney. The area where Toney has made her greatest progress, though, is defensive play.  we do not practice every day oc­casionally, and we have summer to ourselves.

But Notre Dame fans already are seeing the influence of Diondra Toney on the Irish program.
