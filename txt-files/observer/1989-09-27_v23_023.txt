Salvadoran rebel attacks leave 39 dead 
Associated Press 
SAN SAI.VADOB. El Sal­vador-Leftist n~bels attacked government forces in scattered raids in nine provinces Tuesday and military officials said 39 soldiers and guerrillas were killed. 
The rebels have agreed to peace talks and a communique said Tuesday's actions were in response to government re­pression. 
The communique, broadcast on the rebels' clandestine radio station, called the attacks a "Halt the repression!" offensive and said it was ordered be­cause of the arrests of dozens of unionists. 
Military officials said guerril­las attacked targets in nine of El Salvador's 14 provinces. They listed the casualties as 26 guerrillas and 13 soldiers killed and 18 soldiers, 15 guerrillas and 6 civilians wounded. 
It was the broadest rebel of­fensive since May 10 when the guerrillas attacked positions in 10 provinces. And it was the first series of coordinated at­tacks by the guerrillas since government and rebel represen­tatives held preliminary peace talks in Mexico City Sept. 13­15. 
An 11-day cease-fire declared unilaterally by the rebels ended Sunday. 
The rebel communique spoke of the "fascist brutality" of the rightist government of Presi­dent Alfredo Cristiani, referring to accusations by detainees that they were tortured and raped last week at National PolicP headquarters. 
Cristiani's government has denied the allegations of brutality.

WORLD BRIEFS 

Lack of service at North 
China's Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin took a hard line Tuesday at his first news conference, insisting that those 

Dining Hall is distasteful
arrested in the spring democracy movement were criminals and refusing to rule out more executions.Asked by a reporter if the 

"Tiananmen tragedy" could have been avoided, Jiang said: "We believe it was not a tragedy. Tiananmen was a counterrevolution­ary rebellion opposing the Communist Party leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist system," he said. Premier Li Peng, who also took part in the news conference, reaffirmed the party's de­termination to end rampant corruption and said new limits on of­ficial perks would be announced in a few days. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Cancer Researchers have identified precise abnor­malities in an anti-cancer gene linked to lung cancer, raising the possibility of early diagnosis and better treatment for the 150,000 people who get lung cancer each year. During the last several years, researchers have found indirect evidence that defects in at least six genes can contribute to the formation of lung cancer. A new study has pinpointed precise chemical changes that should be useful for identifying people at high risk of getting lung cancer, or for predicting how deadly a particular case of lung cancer will be, said the author of the study's findings, Dr. John Minna of the Na­tional Cancer Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch in Bethesda, Md. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 
The Indiana Board of Pharmacy ordered an emergency suspension of a Michigan City pharmacist's license on Tuesday. The board voted 5-0 to suspend Dean Snyder for at least 90 days for alleged drug abuse. The attorney general's office said Snyder worked for Revco Drug Stores in Elkhart and Michigan City until Aug. 23 when drug losses were noticed. A pharmacy inspector also discovered evidence of missing drugs during a routine audit of the Elkhart store, officials said. By that time, Snyder had been fired. 
Community Hospitals Indianapolis will assume the $26 million debt at University Heights Hospital and spend up to $10 million to expand services at its newest branch. University Heights, which will be renamed Community Hospital South, will begin offering obstetrics services, as well as upgraded cardiology and pediatrics care, officials announced Monday. University I I eights had been struggling financially since its current facility opennd in 1984. "We were running an operating loss in six figures and ... we couldn't borrow any more money. We had reached the limit," said the hospital's board chairman, James Munger. 
CAMPUS BRIEFS 
Football parking last Saturday went well, according to Phil Johnson, assistant director of Security. He said that the pattern worked effectively and said many fans arrived early. Although there was some early morning congestion, Johnson said everyone made it to the stadium on time. "The credit goes to the different agencies for their cooperation." University, city, county and state police worked together to keep traffic moving. He said Security will meet to review last weekend's parking and to prepare for fu­ture home football games.

Most students on campus eat at least two meals a day. These meals are usually a time to socialize with friends and catch up on the latest gossip, and so should be a good time. But lately, the service, or lack thereof, has been making the meals almost a chore. 
North Dining Hall was rebuilt and re-engi­neered, I thought, with the purpose of reducing the lines that used to extend out the door, and making the dining experience more pleasurable for the students. Since we have been in session this semester, I have yet to experience a truly pleasurable meal. 
The problem, first and foremost, is the state of the salad bar. It is an excellent idea, and if it were filled with its respective fixings, a student could make a meal out of that alone. 
But many times I have had to hunt through the dining rooms to find a tray of lettuce, or green peppers that are not soft to the point of being able to squish them through my teeth. I have waited an hour for a tray of ketchup. Isn't that a little ridiculous? 
I have watched a dining hall worker take in­ventory of the salad bar, take away empty trays, and never come back. Do they get lost in the back somewhere? Do they make the ketchup themselves? 
Those rare times when the fixings are avail­able, they are usually on the borderline of inedi­ble. Call me a picky eater, but I don't know of too many other people who enjoy eating the heart of a head of lettuce, and I do not think the natural color of lettuce is brown. It makes me wonder if any worker looks at what is being thrown into those trays. If they did, I highly doubt that the tray would make it into the din­ing room. It also makes me wonder exactly how long some of those items sit out. Is there a reason for this? 
The salad bar is not the only aspect being ne­glected. Many a night there has been only chocolate milk. No skim. No 2 percent. Only chocolate. I don't think they could have run out of all other types of milk; someone just is not filling them up. Many times there has been only carbonated water in the pop machines. Many

times there is no ice. Is there a reason for this? 

Lines are still rampant in the dining hall as well. Granted, when everyone who has a class that lets out at 12:05 immediately goes to lunch, lines are bound to be long. But what about when the lines form with students just staring at empty food trays behind the glass? I find it hard to believe that no food is cooked in ad­vance. 
The University has spent a lot of money on re­building NOH to better serve the students, and yet the students are suffering. It is not right for the students to dislike going to their meals. From what I have heard from friends at other schools, our food is better than most. It is the service that is causing the dislike. 
Two years ago, in the old NOH, no problems like this occurred, except for the lines. The salad bar was always in fine condition -we never wanted for any condiment of any sort. In fact, one worker had the sole job of tending to the salad bar. It leaves me wishing for the ugly interior and long lines for the sake of better service. 

The students, or their parents, are spending over $1,500 per semester on room and board, and that figure includes meals. We should get our money's worth. 
Is it a matter of being understaffed? Is it a matter of carelessness? Whatever it is, it must be rectified. The University has been running a dining hall for many years now. It should know how to run one correctly.

Hurricane Hugo damage by state 
Associated Press 
Here is a state-by-state look at the damage and deaths caused by Hurricane Hugo and its remnants: 
SOUTH CAHOLINA-At least 17 deaths reported, with damage in Charleston estimatt~d at $1 billion or more. About 75,000 people in tho area were still out of their homes. A dust-to-dawn curfew remained in effect. Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic Tues­day. Power was restored to about 20 percent of cus· tomers. 
Columbia: Trees and power lines down. 25,000 people remained without electricity Tuesday. 
Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island: Residents continued to return home Tuesday by boat, but under police escort and only to look at their homes and collect a few be­longings beforo returning to mainland. Downed power lines and trees and leaking propane gas create a dan· gerous situation. The only bridge to the mainland was washed out. 
Garden City: Among the 
hardest hit areas. Water 
surged as much as three 
blocks inland. Electricity was 
restored to most of the city 
by Tuesday. 
Hilton Head: Less damage 
than expected, mostly roof 
and water damage. Some · 
broken windows, downed 
trees and power lines. 
Murrells Inlet: A marina and dock destroyed, as well as several homes. Most of th~} town had electricity re­stored Tuesday. 
Myrtle Beach: Damage es­timated at more than $600 million in Horry County. High-rise motels remain standing, but swimming pools, first-floor lobbies, restaurants and parking lots are damaged. Some hotels and motels reopened Mon­day, but a curfew remained in effect. 
Pawleys Island: Entire is· land without electricity, but most of mainland had power restored Tuesday. At least 14 homes destroyed. 
Rock Hill: Damage esti­mated at $11 million in York County. Electricity still out in several areas.

VIHGINIA -At least six deaths reported. The storm blew roofs off houses and toppled trees and utility poles throughout much of western and southwestern Virginia. but no major dam­~ge was reported. 
Sony may buy Columbia ~ Pictures Inc. for $3 ·billion 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Columbia Pic­tures Entertainment Inc. said Tuesday its board may decide Wednesday on a buyout offer from an unidentified suitor, widely believed to be Japan's Sony Corp. 
The deal would come in an atmosphere of consolidation sweeping the entertainment business in recent years as companies seek to position themselves in increasingly ac­cessible global markets. 
Trading in Columbia stock was active for the second con­secutive session on reports that Sony offered about $3 billion for the lilm and television pro­ducer. The rumored deal also boosted the prices of stocks of other entertainment companies. 
Columbia, Sony and Coca­Cola Co., which owns 49 per­cent of Columbia's stock, would not comment on published re­ports that Sony is offering be­tween $26 and $28 a share for all of Columbia's common stock. Columbia had about 111 million common shares out­standing as of May 31. 
Columbia stock jumped $5.25 
a share Monday when it dis­closed it was "in discussions with a third party involving their acquisition for cash of all of Columbia's outstanding shares." 
On Tuesday, Columbia said its board met Monday night to re­view those discussions, then adjourned until Wednesday when "it is anticipated that further action will be taken." 
Columbia and Sony reportedly have been talking for months. Sony is eager to expand hold­ings in the entertainment lield as a complement to its long­standing electronic hardware business. 
Columbia has a library of more than 2, 700 films and 23,000 television episodes that could provide a luerativn nnw source of revenue for Sony, which specializes in videocas­sette recorders and other hardware on whieh to display such shows. 
"Over time, there is a case for continued consolidation in the industry. The list of buyers is a lot longPr than thP list. of sellers," said Mara Balsbaugh, of Smith Barney llarris Upham & Co.

Just a 15 minute ride from the splendors of Cape Town, the Crossroads is a shantytown of 55,000 people stricken with extreme poverty.

and it was all the 
morn special due to 
the surroundings in 

whieh I feasted. I was in 
Mitehell's Plain, a colored 
township on the outskirts of 
Cape Town, South Africa, and 
I was lucky enough to be invit­
ed to dinner with several fam­
ilies. None of my hosts had 
much money, yet each 
brought vegetables and other 
itnms to add to the omelnttn. 
In thn end, we eaeh had our 
fill and spent the rest of the

township and I of life in the 
Unitnd Stales. 
Such was a lypieal day dur­ing my two week visit to South Af'riea. I belinve that I lnarned more in that 14 day period than during any other time in my life. I traveled to the coun­try to work as a voluntary stan· member for Arehbishop Tutu and also to get a realistic view of apartheid. I accom­plished both objectives and learned a great deal about myself and this country in the process. If anything, I have come to the realization that neither I nor the United States is doing enough to help save South Africa. 
When I first arrived in Cape Town, I thought I had found a paradise. Physieally it is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. The mountains whieh ring the sparkling

beaches combine with lush flowers and vegetation to pro­duce an amazing sight. The homes are luxurious, the res­taurants arc chic and delicious, and the stores rival the best Ameriea has to offer. It seems to have the best of everything, and the South Africans arc a privileged people. The white South Africans, that is. 
During the first two days of my visit, I had only been in white areas of Cape Town, and thus I had only experienced white South Africa, which is in­deed paradise. I never stopped to realize that no black South Africans had been driving any of the BMW's or Mercedes which cruise the streets. I never stoppnd to realize that no black South Africans had been swim­ming in the pools or playing tennis at any of the beautiful homes surrounding Bishop­scourt. No black South Africans were dining in the nice restau­rants or shopping in the stores. I would soon find out that Chris Ahrends, the Archbishop's Chaplain and my day to day su­pervisor and friend was abso­lutely correct when he told me: 

I was absolutely wrong. After a 15 minute ride from Bishop­scourt, I stepped out of the car in Crossroads, a black shanty town comprised of about 55,000 people. I became physi­cally ill at the sight. It was pov­erty unlike anything I have ever seen, and I couldn't be­lieve any government could al­low people to live in such conditions. The people live in whatever they can find, and garbage litters the narrow paths between the shanties. It was simply an unexplainable sight and one I shall never for­get. As we were leaving Cross­roads and got on the highway into Cape Town, I looked back for a final glimpse of the shan­tics. Such a view was impossi­ble because the government had erected huge mounds of earth on the side of the high­way to obstruct sight of the Crossroads. "Out of sight, out of mind," replied my guide, and we headed back to the white areas of Cape Town.

.Another former Notre Dame offensive lineman from Chicago gets to face his former team this weekend, though there figures to be much less animosity this time around. 
Jason Cegielski, a 6-2, 265­pound guard from Chicago St. Rita High School, is a junior at Purdue. Cegielski entered Notre Dame out of high school but left the University for academic reasons after his freshman year. 
Like Jeff Pearson, the former Irish offensive lineman now at Michigan State, Cegielski has found success in the Big Ten. A returning starter, Cegielski bench-presses almost 450 pounds and is an all-Big Ten candidate. 
Unlike Pearson, Cegielski has not spent the week speaking out about his dislike for Notre Dame and has not mentioned any sort of "vendetta" against particular players.

Eilers prefers blocking to glamour of scoring Irish TDs 
By MARY GARINO 
Sports Writer 
When Pat Eilers remembers his favorite plays of the football season, he doesn't think of catching long passes or running for touchdowns. lie thinks of blocking. 
"I like blocking linebackers," he says. "Those are the most memorable plays for me. I like it when the other person doesn't know you're coming, and you can really unload on them." 
Eilers has done his share of blocking in his role as Notre Dame's starting split end this year. But Eilers has also had many opportunities to carry the ball, haul in long passes and sack opposing quarterbacks in his three years playing for the Irish. He has been one of the most versatile players on the team, starting as flanker and strong safety in addition to his 

play  on  special  teams.  But  
Eilers'  best  skills  lie  in  his  
receiving ability.  

"His best features as a receiver are his intelligence and reliability," says Pete Cordelli, the coach of the receiving corps. "He's a smart player and even though he's not that fast, he has the ability to get open and make the catch." 
Last spring, when Haghib Ismail was moved from split end to flanker, Eilers made the switch from flanker to split end. One other role that Eilers has assumed this year is that of a team leader for the Irish. As a fifth year senior, he has become a model for the younger members of the team and has helped them to learn their jobs. 
"He is the example," Cordelli says. "He has great work habits, and he sets the tempo for the other receivers." 
The offense, and the receivers especially, need every bit of leadership that they can get this year. The only other wide 
receivers  who  are  
upperclassmen  are  David  
Jandric  and  Antwon  Lark.  

Going into the season, the receivers were one of the question marks for the Irish. 
"It's still is a legitimate concern, because we don't throw the ball a lot. We establish the run," Eilers says about the offense. "But I don't think you will ever lind a better receiver than Hocket Ismail. And everyone else has done a great job." 
"The offense still hasn't come into its own," Eilers continued. "With the exception of the first half of the Virginia game, we really haven't gone out there and dominated the game. I think we have been unfair to the defense so far." 
Playing on a dominating football team is one of the reasons that Eilers transferred to Notre Dame from Yale after his freshman year. Coming out 
of  high  school,  Eilers  
considered  attending  Notre  
Dame  but  opted  for  Yale  

instead. He was confident about playing for the Fighting Irish when he finally did transfer, and he hasn't regretted the decision. 
"I've met a lot of great people 
here, and I feel fortunate to be 
associated with the players and 
the coaching staff. It has been 
a really positive experience," 
Eilers says. 
Eilers finished the requirements for a biology degree last May, and is currently working towards a second degree in mechanical engineering. lie says that he has a special commitment that the other seniors share. 
"We've been afforded a great opportunity here at Notre Dame, and we are committed to what Notre Dame stands for. To go out and do a great job is rewarding and satisfying," Eilers says.

ND volleyball faces Boilermakers 


By GREG SCHECKENBACH 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame head coach Art Lambert is praying that history does not repeat itself tonight when the Irish host intrastate rival Purdue at 7 p.m. in the Joyce ACC Arena. 
His fear is very legitimate, since Notre Dame has never beaten the Boilermakers in nine previous matches. Last year, an experienced Irish squad lost a tough match to Purdue in four games. Luckily for Lambert, a 

.. new year brings a new team with different expectations. "We'll have to play the best we have played all year," stated Lambert. "Since we arc not able to scout them before the match, it will be less of Purdue's performance and more of our own that determines the outcome." Notre Dame comes into the match with a 2-8 record while Purdue enters the contest at 5­
6. Although the Irish haven't won a lot of matches, Lambert insists that they arc competitive and able to compete with anyone. 

"Our record is very deceiving," said Lambert, "but we are making progress every day through competitive practices. Our goal is to play better than the match before, and so far we have done that." 
The Boilermakers will be led by outside hitter Debbie McDonald and setter Kelly Niedbalski. Both are formidable forces at the net and should challenge the young Irish front row. According to Lambert, blocking is the key to stopping the Purdue tandem. 
"If we do a better job blocking," said Lambert, "we probably will come away with a win." 
The Irish attack will indude senior outside hitter Kathy Cunningham and freshmen Alicia Turner and Jessica Fiebelkorn. All have performed well in the early season and are expected to continue their style of play in the future. Junior Amy White, who recently made the jump from setter to outside hitter, will be a catalyst for the Irish as senior Taryn Collins will assume the setting job. Jennifer Slosar and Tracy Shelton are both expected to contribute greatly in the match. 
"Our experience is a problem right now," stated Lambert. "As we play morn I expect great things from our younger players-they are excellent athletes." 
History is not on the side of tlw Irish, but honw court advantage is. Notre Dame has a great chance to put a mark in the win column against the Boilermakers in front of a supportive home crowd. Since the Irish have subsequent momentum from last weekend's tournament and are looking to end a period of frustration, a quality performance can be expected. 

Hey, hey, holy mackerel: Cubs clinch NL East title 
Associated Press 
MONTHEAL -The Chicago Cubs clinched their second National League East eharnpionship in six seasons, beating Montreal 3-2 Tuesday night with an unearned run in th1~ eighth inning after second­place St. Louis already lost. 
The Cubs took advantage of the Cardinals' 4-1 defeat in Pittsburgh and became the first team to guarantee a spot in the playoffs. 
Hyne Sandberg's dash horne in the eighth made Don Zimmer a champion for the first time in 11 years of managing, and also made meaningless a season­ending, three-game series in St. Louis. 
Chicago will open the playolTs Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, all but certainly against San Francisco. The Cubs and Giants split 12 games this year. 
After Mike Fitzgerald made the final out of the game, the Cubs darted out of the dugout and met in celebration at the mound. 
Sandberg, the only everyday starter remaining from the Cubs' last title team in 1984, scored the go-ahead run with the kind of aggressive play that transformed Chicago from an 77-85 club last year into winners. 
Sandberg singled with two outs and was running when Dwight Smith followed with a single to right field. When Hubie Brooks bobbled the ball for a split second, Sandberg kept going and beat second baseman Torn Foley's relay to the plate. 
Zimmer, Chicago's eighth manager in the 1980s, was among the first to greet Sandberg as the Cubs spilled on to the field. Smith, who had never played in the big leagues before this season -think about all the years Ernie Banks and Billy Williams played for the Cubs and never won anything -also did a little celebration dance on the bases. 
Greg Maddux, 19-12, allowed seven hits in 8 1-3 innings and Mitch Williams got two outs for his 36th save. Maddux is second in the league in victories, one behind Houston's Mike Scott. 
It was the second time this season Maddux and Sandberg had teamed up to win a big game. On Aug. 7, the Cubs took sole possession of first place for good when they beat co-leader Montreal behind time in six games. Ali of their Sandberg's home run and playoff games are sold out as Maddux' seven-hitter. 27 million telephone calls were

Irish look for young players to step in and contribute 
Notre Dame's four turnovers were not the only thing that had Lou Holtz concerned after the 21-13 Irish victory over Michigan State last weekend. 
Depth problems at linebacker and in the offensive backfield have tlw Fighting Irish coach wondering how his team can survive the 12-game regular season. 
"Last year we got better as the season went on," said Iloltz. "One of the reasons was we eould play a lot of different people. Hight now we don't have that depth. 
"Wt~'w got to lind out if (freshmen) are ready to make a contribution to this team. We have no other option or we'll be a bask1~t case by the end of the year." 
Holtz's pre-game pessimism rarely is taken too seriously. In his three-plus years at Notre Dame, Holtz has made a habit of spending the week discussing the weaknesses of his team then watching the Irish fnast on opponents every Saturday. 
This time, Holtz doesn't seem to be blowing smoke. A look at thn Irish depth ehart shows just how prPrarious Notre Dame's situation has beeome

in certain areas, particulary at linebacker and running back. 
Ned Bolcar and Donn Grimm have played nearly every down at linebacker each of the past two games. 
"We can't continue to play two linebackers," said Holtz. "We have to play more people even if it costs us dearly." 
After sophomore Michael Smalls, the reserves at linebacker inelude Karl McGill, Demetrius DuBose, Brian Hatigan, Nick Smith and Handy Scianna -all freshmen. 
In the offensive backfield, Hicky Watters is the only completely healthy running baek with any kind of college experience. 
Hodney Culver missed most of the Michigan State game after suffering a hip pointer during a second­quarter fumble, but he should be ready for the Purdue game. Anthony Johnson has nagging aches that are an inevitable result of playing almost every down at fullback. 
With the early-season loss of Kenny Spears to academies, along with the summer news that Braxston Banks and Tony Brooks would not be available, what seemed to be Notre Dame's strongest area has become inereasingly thin. 
Holtz has indicated that Heggie Brooks, a freshman from Tulsa, Okla., and the younger brother of Tony, will see playing time against Purdue. Sophomores Walter Boyd and Husty Setzer and freshman Dorsey Levens also might appear this weekend. 
"I don't have any doubt (Brooks) is ready to play if he can protect the football," said Holtz. "We'll lind out a lot about Heggie Brooks on Saturday." 
If last year's game (a 52-7 Notre Dame rout) is any indication, Saturday's matchup with Purdue might not present a significant ehallengP to the
