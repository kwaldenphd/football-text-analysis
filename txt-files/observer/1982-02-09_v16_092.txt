Runoffs in the Student Body President-Vice President and two Stu­dent Senate districts, in addition to decisions in the three other Senate districts, resulted from yesterday's student dcctions. 

SSP CAMPAIGN '82

lloyd Burke and Bob Yonchak garnered 47.8 percent of the vote, more than any other SBP-SBVP ticket but not enough for an outright win, as 50 pt·rcent plus one vote is necessary. Patrick Borchers and Maureen Burns finished with 31.S percent, including victories in Pangborn, Dillon, Lewis, Zahm, Holy Cross, and Stanford, and a tie with Burke in Fisher. Earl Rix and Tad Nachcff, the Observer­·endorsed ticket, managed only 20.7 percent, with victories in Mor­rissey and Keenan, the candidates' home dorms. 

The results from Student Senate Districts I and 2 also came out inconclusively. In District 1, Cathy Krause ( 36.1 percent ofthe vote) day as the election resulted in a runoff See story and Chris Tayback ( 28.8 percent) emerged from a field offour with

The detention of Professor Kosimierz Braun in Poland has caused the cancellation of a Shakespeare comedy originally planned as this year's final production of the ND-SMC Theatre. An· alternate presentation is being planned. Braun was scheduled to join the ND-SMC Communications and Theatre Department at the begin­ning of the semester. Department officials have had no communica­tion with Braun since martial law was declared in Poland on Dec. 13. Braun was scheduled as guest director for the Shakespeare comedy. He was also scheduled to teach several classes, which have since been cancelled. Frederick Sybur ;, an associate professor of the department says "an alternate pre1.entation is in the planning stages. What it will include has not been determined. We would like to do something, such as a Polish play, that presents our feeling for what has happened in Poland." -The Observer 
Chinaplans an extensive governmental retrenchment that in­cludes cutting the number of vice premiers from 18 to two or three and scrapping a system that allows most bureaucrats to keep their jobs for life, an authoritative leftist Hong Kong newspaper reported yesterday. It was the most detailed report yet on the Communist leadership's plan to cut down China's monumental bureaucracy, which many senior Chinese officials blame for stalling the country's drive to modernize by the year 2000. The Hong Kong Chinese­language daily newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which reflects the official Communist Party line in Peking, said the program was "revolutionary" and of paramount importance to the "fate of the country and the party." -AP 

Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, wearing handkerchief masks forced passengers off buses in three cities yes­terday and firebombed the vehicles or shot up their tires, police and witnesses said. No one was hurt in the attacks, but at least a dozen people were taken to hospital in hysterics, police said. There were no arrests. Passengers said the guerrillas, all apparently in their teens, wore handkerchiefs across their faces to avoid identification. Police said the guerrillas attacked at least 22 buses between 6.30 a.m. and noon in the capital, and staged similar raids in Santa Ana and San Vicente. -AP 
A Swiss executive jet was hit by Palestinian anti­aircraft fire aimed at Israeli warplanes over Beirut yesterday and made an emergency landing, the state radio reported. Pilot Paul Kel­ler, his co-pilot and four passengers were unharmed after the t~in­engine 36-A learjet, operated by the Geneva firm Aero Leasing, flew into the range ofanti-aircraft cannons while approaching the airport. The left wing and fuselage were hit, Keller said. He estimated damage at S I million. Keller said he had come to Beirut to pick up another passenger for a trip to Turkey, then Geneva. Palestinian gun­ners often fire at Israeli jets that routinely fly reconnaissance mis­sions over the Lebanese capital. Airport officials usually order incoming commercial planes to circle over the Mediterranean Sea until the shooting stops. -AP 
John Hay "Jock" Whitney, of Manhasset, N.Y., a newspaper publisher, movie producer, diplomat and one of the na­tion's wealthiest men, died yesterday at the age of77. Whitney, who excelled at virtually everything he tried, died at North Shore Hospi· tal here. He had been in fragile health for a year. Born to a family that established itself in the New World in 1635, Whitney was worth an estimated S I 00 million. His life centered around his palatial 500­acre Long Island estate, Greentree, which he inherited from his parents. He conducted his business and philanthropic activities from his estate after 1979, when he suffered a setback from a heart ailment that first struck in 1975. Whitney was born Aug. 17, 1904, in El· Isworth, Maine, where his parents were summering. A maternal grandson of former Secretary of State John Hay and a paternal grandson of a former Navy Secretary William C. Whitney, he at· tended Groton, Yale and Oxford. -AP

It's snow use 
A week ago Sunday, Saint Mary's college went into an uproar. It started on the first floor of Lemans Hall and "like a roar of thun­der" swiftly moved up to the fourth floor. Within minutes, the chant of "There are no classes tomorrow!" echoed throughout the 
campus. 

Apparently, some hopeful (and lucky) S~C students·tried to fool other students, secunty, and even the administration into believing there were no classes on the following Mon­day due to poor weather conditions. The SMC prankster, who disguised her voice as Kath­leen Rice, Dean ofStudent Affairs, telephoned all resident hall desks, security, and even local radio stations informing them of the supposed school closing. 
With that news, the entire SMC community went wild with excitement. Finally, after weeks of trecherous South Bend weather, a day offfrom school! 
The dream of an extended weekend, and 
legally sleeping through Monday morning 
classes was shattered quickly after the ad­
ministration realized Why, then, are classes being held on the following day? 


In the unincorporated area of South Bend where many off-campus students live, the streets and driveways have not been cleared. Ice and an unreasonable amount of snow ac­cumulation make it virtually impossible to travel. One Campus View resident stated that it took him nearly an hour and 15 minutes to drive from his apartment to Memorial Library. The administration obviously does not consider off-campus students when deciding on a school closing. 
If, by some stretch of the imagination, the Administration found weather conditions so bad that classes were

following day. 

In another humerous attempt to out-smart the administration, the administration won. It was a darned good try, though. 
When students go to such lenghts to get one snow day off from school, it makes me question the Administration's decisions that warrent a school closing. A recent Obseroer article stated that much careful thought and consideration went into the decision of closing a school or keeping it opened for the day. 
Exo.ctly how much ice and snow must ac­
cumulate on the streets to close a major uni­
versity or college? This semester, South Bend 
has been hit with weather conditions that 
make it dangerous to drive. Almost every 
weekend thus far, the South Bend police 
department has declared driving hazardous. 
In some instances, tickets were issued to 
people who drove their cars on city streets. 

There is a bit of irony to this whole situa­tion. Students get too excited about the thought ofgetting one day off from school. If students wanted a day offfrom classes so bad­ly, all they'd have to do is stay in bed and sleep in. But this is college, remember? You're supposed to want to go to classes. Besides isn't that what you're here for?

Reagan challenges Dem.ocrats ******************** 
~ MARDIGRASDANCERS!! ~ 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President Reagan formally sent Congress his 1983 spending plan yesterday, cha t llenging Democratic critics to substantiate charges that his is a budget for the rich. "It is not true," he insisted. 
The S757.6 billion proposal signed by the president projects record deficits of $98.6 billion this year and S91. 5 billion for the fiscal year that starts Oct. I. 
Reagan said he hasn't given up his now-distant goal of bringing the budget into balance, but this plan, more than his la..~t. encountered bit­tt·r rhetoric from Democrats and open acknowledgement by Republican leaders that it won't get through Congress unscathed. 
House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Reagan's chief Democratic an­tagonist, charged after a short cour­tesy hridlng at the White House that the budget shows the president "has ti.>rgotten his roots (and) associated with that country club style of people." 
"Well," Reagan countered during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, "I've only played golf once since I've been president, and he's an inveterate golfer, and I'm sure he must have to go to a country club to play golf." 
As he signed tht.· first oftwo green­bound copies of the budget book with a ceremonial pen, Reagan quipped, "That will be weekend reading for Tip O'Neill." 
"I'll send the pen with it," Reagan added, "because he may want to make some further cuts in it." 
Senate Democratic leader Robert 

C. Byrd of West Virginia called the deficit projections "shocking" but said the true figures arc much high­cr. 
"This is really a campaign budget," Byrd charged, saying that last year the administration "fed phony numbers into the computer, and they're doing it again." 
Byrd boycotted the White House st·ssion for the bipartisan leadership because "a I5-minutc briefing is no briefing at alL.on a budget of this 80 percenr ofwhat you said."

Two of Prof. Shapiro's former stu­dents who wish to remain anonymous view this "change of scheduling" as the "culmination ofa lot of things." According to these 
students, Prof. Shapiro often used colorful language and expressed religious views which were not in class assignment. One student went to her advisor the next day, Friday, Jan. 1 5 and Emil Hofman, Dean of Freshman Year, the following Mon­day to state complaints. Dean Hof­

mer jobs and where and when to apply. 
According to Shook, there will be approximately 200 positions on campus this summer. The majority of the interviewing and job offers will take place between April 15 and the end ofthe semester. 
"There is usually a demand for summer jobs but because of the economy and low availability ofjobs in other areas, the demand is even . higher," Shook said. "Many students know that if they go back home, chances for jobs will be slim." 
Summer jobs will be given on a priority basis with Notre Dame stu­dents at the top of the list. Offerings include jobs in labs, offices, dining halls, and groundskeeping.

NDcampus to vote on boycott 
The University of Notre Dame's Student Affairs Boycott Committee has announced that a student vote will be taken on Mar. 2, 1982 to determine whether or not to con­tinue the-University-wide boycott of the Nestle Company. 
Following a student vote in 1979, the University has boycotted the Nestle Company and its subsidiaries over the marketing practices of in­fant formula manufacturers and dis· tributors in the Third World. The Nestle Company holds the largest ~:.~d.of the market in the Third 
The boycott on campus was in· itiated by the World Hunger Coali­tion, a student organization. Prior to vote on March 2, educational ses­sions and literature will be made available to all students, highlighted by an on-campus presentation and a debate between Infact and the Nestle Company on Thursday, Feb. 18, at 7:30 pm at the center for Continuing Education.

never been put in that kind of situa­
tion. Buti came out ofit all right." 
Luzinski's post-game eulogy was short, sweet and to the point, and the Irish have not been humiliated since. "I've been on teams that have lost -dead last place," he told the dejected troops. "And I've been on championship teams. And it's a lot easier for the freshmen and sopho­mores to accept this than it would be for a guy like Qohn) Paxson who has been on winning teams, and has had a taste of it. But through playing together and through hard work, they'll come out ofit. And the adver­sity they're experiencing now will make them a better team down the road." 
Spoken like a true Notre Dame

Over DePauw 

Schirz paces SMC victory 
By DAVE WILSON 
Sports Writer 

After last night's 63-44 thrashing of DePauw University, one would think that the Saint Mary's basketball team is more than ready for the post­season tournaments coming up at the end ofthis month. 
The Belles are looking no further 
than the upcoming weekend, 
however, when they will travel 
north to compete in the power­
packed Wisconsin-Green Bay 
Tournament. 

"We're going to face a couple of 
tough teams this weekend," said 
SMC basketball coach Jerry Dalles­
sio. "We'll think about post-season 
when the time comes, but for now we've got to worry about some of those Division II teams in the Wis­consin tournament. 
"We'll have a couple of-good practices Tuesday and Wednesday, and a practice game on Thursday, so the team ought to be ready by the weekend.". 
As ·for last night's contest, the Belles seemingly could do no wrong as they boosted their record to 8-I0 for the year. SMC spotted the Tigers an immediate four-point edge before reeling off five straight field goals to take a 10-4 lead. The Belles then scored I5 ofthe next I7 points to take a 25-6 lead through ten minutes ofaction. 
DePauw, who was committing no less than I5 turnovers in the meantime, pulled no closer than I5 points the remainder of the game. 
"I was very pleased with our first­half performance," commented Dal­lessio. "The defense was absolutely terrific all the way, and I think that in turn inspired our offensive perfor­mance." 
At halftime the Belles were sitting on a remarkable 39-I6 margin, prompting Dallessio to ease off on an effective half-court trap defense. Al­though DePauw matched baskets with Saint Mary's through the second half, Dallessio thought the change ofpace was inevitable and, in 
fact, necessary. 
"We like to win, of course," he said, "but when you get to the point ofreally blowing the opposition out, I think you should ease up and play a relaxed game. 

"We bothered them with our defense, and the key to our offense was in getting the ball to Lisa Schirz for the short shot. Things just really worked well for us tonight." 
Schirz led the Belles' scoring drive with a game-high 15 points, followed by an impressive 14-point effort from frosh Elaine Seuss. Junior center Mary Pat Sitlington threw in nine points, while Mary Bayless and Trish Nolan added eight points apiece to the effort. 
The Wisconsin-Green Bay com­petition will be the third tourna­ment in as many weekends for the Belles, who will attempt to boost their record back up to the .500 mark. The team then will return next week for a couple ofhome con­tests before gearing up for the Dis­trict Tournament at Goshen College on February 26.

National Hockey League All-Star game. 
,. Soxstar 
Luzinski has Domer ties 
By MICHAEL ORTMAN 
Sports Writer 
When Irish trivia buffs think about Notre Dame baseball players in the big leagues, usually one and maybe two names come to mind -Carl Y astrzemski and perhaps Ron Reed. One more former ND star returned to this campus last week -Chicago White Sox slugger Greg Luzinski. 
No, "The Bull" never played on Jake Kline Field, or any other diamond as a collegian. His Notre Dame experience took place at Notre DameHigh School in Niles, Ill. But his ties to South Bend's Notre 
Dame are numerous, and the 3I­year-old Medford, N.J., resident lists them with great pride. 
"I've always been a die-hard Notre Dame fan," the nine-year veteran ad­mitted last week when he, catcher Carlton Fisk, outfielder-first baseman Tom Paciorek and Manager Tony La Russa stopped in South Bend as part of the team's promo­tional caravan through northern In­diana. "I spent the day on campus visiting with some old friends.'' 
Luzinski lists among his Notre Dame contacts people from varied walks of campus life -football ad­ministrative assistant joe Yonto, bas­

-ketball Coach Digger Phelps and Vice-President of Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear. When Luzinski arrived at Notre Dame High as a freshman in I964, it was Van Woivlear: then that school's principal, who saw to it that the young football/ baseball star would be able to stay at Notre Dame. "I got him a job in the school cafeteria to help him pay his way through," Van Wolvlear recalls. "That was when he needed to work," he adds with a, chuckle, considering the half­million dollar-plus salary Luzinski now receives annually. Throughout his high school 
career, "The Bull" was a two-sport standout. As a linebacker and ful­!back in football, be received offers from I 50 colleges, including Notre Dame. Yonto, who had left Notre Dame high school after the I963 season to take the defensive line job here, was among the many in the hunt for the most-sought-after ful­lback in the Midwest in I968. 
So was another member of the current Notre Dame staff. "When I visited campus today (Wednesday) I met (Linebacker coach) George Kel­ly,': Luzinski related. "He remem-

Greg Luzinski 
bered recruiting me when he was on the staff at Nebraska." 
Add to all of this the fact that two of Lozinski's high school coaches, Denny Conway and Alan Laboy, played halfback and linebacker, respectively, for Ara Parseghian during his first two years here. It's little wonder that Gregory Michael Luzinski had "Golden Dome" writ­ten all over him. 
As it was, the multi-talented youngster said "thanks but no thanks" to his football suitors. "I told 

them there was no sense in me sig­
· ning a letter of intent," he recalls, "becasue I felt that I would be a number-one draft choice (of the Philadelphia Phillies) and that would probably be the route I'd pursue." 
He was, and he did. Luzinski moved quickly through the minor leagues, and was called up by the Phillies late in the 1970 season. And it. was during his early years in the City of Brotherly Love that he met another Notre Dame person ­Digger Phelps. ("I got to know him through a sports writer friend of mine.") Phelps, who spent four years as an assistant coach at the Uni­versity of Pennsylvania in Philadel­phia before a year as head man at Fordham and then on to Notre Dame, has been a close friend of Luzinski's ever since. 
During this past football season, Luzinski appeared with Phelps at the Southern Cal pep rally, and stayed in town for the game. Over Christmas break, Luzinski had the opportunity to make a different sort ofpep talk to a Notre Dame group, and he calls that "one of the funniest ex­periences I've had to deal with." 
Luzinski had driven down to Lan­dover, Md., from his suburban Philadelphia home to watch the Irish get humiliated by Ralph Sampson and the Virginia Cavaliers. "Virginia had just blown them out of the gym," he recalls ofNotre Dame's 33-point defeat. "I saw Digger after the game, and he said, 'You gotta do me a favor. I'd like you to go in and give the guys a pep talk. They're real­lydown.' 
"So I walked in there and saw a lot ofhanging heads, one kid (Dan Duff) who'd broken his ankle during the game, a trainer and a priest. It was a weird experience for me because I'd 
see BULL,page 6 

First and foremost will be Gretzky, the 21-year-old millionaire who scored I64 points last season and appears hea _,:-d for a I 00-goal, 200-point campaign. 
But the crowd favorite should be center Dennis Maruk ofthe Capitals, who celebrated his second All-Star selection by registering his IIth career three-goal performance against Quebec Sunday night. He has 41 goals and is third in the NHL scoring race. 
A crowdo~-18,130 is expected to fill the Capital Centre, where only one sellout has been attracted during the current season as the Washington Capitals struggle through their eighth campaign. 
The Wales Conference had won five straight All-Star games under the format adopted for the I974-75 season, with no game in 1979 be­cause of the Challenge Series with the Soviet Union. The Campbells notched their first decision last year. 
Coach AI Arbour of the two-time Stanley Cup-champion New York Is­landers directed the Campbells in their breakthrough. But, under 3 realignment of the conferences, he will be coaching the Wales this time around. 
Adding to the confusion, John Ogrodnick, the Detroit left wing who scored the Wales' only goal last year, and left wing Bill Barber of Philadelphia, the only one of four 
I98I Campbells' scorers coming back, have switched conference teams under realignment. 
Pangborn captures first hockey victory 

Inside Interhall 

. H<?CKEY -Pangborn won its first ga~e in four outi~gs by defeat­
m~ Ft_sher, 4-3. ~ark Corcoran had two goals and Mike Barri got the 
wmmng tally m the close match. The highlight of the game, 
however, was the eight saves by goalie Bill Keenan in the last four 
minutes. The feat had added significance due to the fact that 
Pangborn was playing a man short and Keenan had only one contact 
lense (borrowed from a friend yet!). 
Dillon kept its record perfect by beating Sorin last week, I3-l. 
Larry Drabot had a hat-trick and both captain Mike Duggan and joe 
Longo had two goals apiece. Duggan had this to say about the 
sea;-on~s pro~ess, ·:we played well tonite, but more importantly 
were 1mprovmg with each game." The Big Red will need to con­
tinue its improvement as the team heads into the toughest part ofits 
schedule with Morrissey, and unbeaten Holy Cross and Alumni. 
. MEN'S BASKETBALL -Perennial power Howard picked up its SIXth and seventh victories of the season last week over Holy Cross 42-34, and Alumni, 62-42. ' 
Even though their playing without its most valuable player, Bill Keenehan, Howard prides its team on an abundance of talent in point guard John "South Philly" Leonard. Keenehan has missed the last two games because of a pulled hamstring, but hopes to return before tournament time this week. Leonard is the play-marker for 
the squad that is small but quick. The undefeated team from Howard should be watched closely going into playoffs as a prime candidate for the championship that they have captured the past two years. 
DEADLINES-The NVA will be sponsoring a mixed-doubles rac­quetball tournament for all students. Entries for the elimination tournament must be in to the NVA office (C-2 ACC) or x6IOO by Wednesday, Feb. IO.
