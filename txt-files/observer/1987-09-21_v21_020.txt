Saint Mary's statue destroyed by vandals 
By MIMI TUOHY Staff Reporter 
Saint Mary's Security is con­tinuing its investigation of the destruction of a statue of the Virgin Mary located inside Lemans Hall. 
The statue was destroyed at about 2:30a.m. Thursday mor­ning when it was knocked off its pedestal on the first floor of the hall, said Saint Mary's Se­curity Director Richard Chlebek. 
Although there were no wit­nesses to the incident, three wo­men, whom Chlebek believes are Saint Mary's students, were seen by a desk clerk run­ning up the stairs of the hall. 
Chlebek said these women are suspects in the incident, al­though he said he has no clues as to their identity. 
A notice was sent to all Saint Mary's students Friday asking for "any information leading to the identification of the persons responsible for damaging" the statue. 
Information about the suspects should be directed to either Saint Mary's Security or the Residence Life Office. 
Chlebek said attempts will be made to repair the statue al­though it will be "quite expen­sive," he said. 
The statue "Our Lady of the Blue Mantle" has been in the hall since the early 1920s, ac­cording to the notice. 
Saint Mary's yearbook, The Blue Mantle, was dedicated to the statue in 1926, Chlebek said. · 

Analyst: early primaries decisive 
time Defore the actual elec­

Iowa and New Hampshire 
will have a greater influence 
on determining who be­
comes the next president 
than California and New 
York, said noted political 
humorist Mark Shields in a 
packed Hesburgh Library 
Auditorium Friday. 
A 1959 Notre Dame 
graduate, Mark Shields 
spoke on the contemporary 
American political scene, 
highlighting its often 
humorous aspects. 

Although Shields said he foresees no landslide for either party, he maintained that whoever wins the presidential election will have been determined a long tion. 
Almost a full year prior to the election, the New Hampshire and Iowa prima­ries invariably determine who will be the next presi­dent, Shields said. Since 1952, when the first modern primaries began, all nine presidents have been win­ners of their respective New Hampshire primaries. Cali­fornia, with its primary in June, occurs too late in the process to make any differ­ence, Shields said. 
Shields contended that a field of 7 or 8 candidates is too large for the American people and mass media to cope with. "We only under­stand a race with 2 or 3 can­didates," Shields said. As a result, the candidates who win the first pnmaries, namely New Hampshire and Iowa, receive the most at­tention and are considered most seriously by the popu­lation and media, he said. 
Shields said the impor­tance of this factor has in­creased because "for the first in the history of broad­cast journalism, the budgets of news departments at the networks have been cut down." He stressed that "in in order to have a crew and a caniera and a correspon­dant with you by late February of 1988, you had

Many are talking now about what a terrible blow to Western civilization it would be if Robert Bork got appointed to the Supreme Court. 
His opponents in the senate, like Joseph Biden of Delaware, admit Bork is a "brilliant" scholar and say they don't question whether his views accord with the Constitution. What they object to is Bork's ideology, they say. 
Even one of N.D.'s very own pointed out that Bork, being the extreme advocate of judicial restraint he is, fails to recognize that values of equality and justice exceed in importance either the intent of the Constitution's authors or the text of the Constitution itself. Pure majoritarian democracy must always give way to ethics, this Viewpoint writer said. "The Con­stitution in its original form was not completely democratic," she pointed out. 
Bork's opponents say they cannot allow a man to become Supreme Court justice who believes in adhering simply to the Constitution without any attention to ethics. Moral convictions do belong in politics, they assert, and ideology is a basis for legitimate discrimination. Or as Biden puts it, "Let's stop pussyfooting ardund and get down to what Judge Bork believes.'' 
What fascinates me, however, is that the very party currently denoucing Bork for attempting to keep moral convictions out of politics ap­plauded a man who came to Notre Dame three years ago and proposed essentially the same thing. 
"We are a nation of laws--when we like those laws and when we don't," this man said. He said regardless of how appalling some laws may seem to us personally, we must uphold them, for "the price of seeking to force our beliefs on other is that they might some day force theirs on us.'' 
Did another vile advocate of judicial restraint like Judge Bork say this? No, it was Gov. Mario Cuomo. As a New York public official, he said he was obliged to uphold the Constitution's sanc­tion of abortion, even though deep down inside he personally opposed it because he is such a good Catholic. 
Compare this to Bork's philosophy. "I like the freedoms of the individual as well as most and would be appalled by many statutes that I am compelled to think would be constitutional if enacted," says Bork. "But I am also per­suaded that my generally libertarian commit­ments have nothing to do with behavior proper to the Supreme Court." 
What could sound more like Cuomo? Both Cuomo and Bork say the law and Constitution takes precedence over moral convictions and personal values. I am surprised they are not in the same party. Yet, whereas Newsweek, echoed by the rest of the mass media called Cuomo's speech "most thoughtful," and the 1985 Dome lumped Cuomo together with Hes­burgh and called them "men of conviction," some of the very same people now say Bork is a "dangerous threat." 
DRINKNi AND DRIVING 
CAN Kl1. A FRIEND5HII 


My purpose in writing this is not to defend Bork. Actually, I agree with people like Biden even if, as in so many other cases, what he say~ proves not to be original: one should dis­c~imin~te on the basis of ideology; Moral con­Siderations do belong in politics. I just wish people like Biden would follow through with this idea. 
Why stop with the Supreme Court? The offi­cials in the CIA, the Department of the Trea­s.ury! and .the FBI could certainly affect our hvelihood JUSt as much as officials in the courts. I say, let us erect minimum ideological require­ments for all members of all federal agencies so to support all of values of this great nation. 
Y~t why st~p there? Government-sponsored pubhc education affects the course of national life probably just as much as the Supreme Court, and public teachers are as much public servants as Supreme Court justices. I say, every teacher in a public school should meet basic ideological requirements as well. 
In short, let us abandon this silly 19th century pretense that creed should serve as no basis for discrimination and that moral convictions should be kept separate from politics. "Let's stop pussyfooting around," as Joe Biden would put it, and ensure that all our public servants act in accordance with not only the Constitution, but also and above all an appropriate value system. 
Yet how much would you like to bet that if someone were to propose this to those criticiz­ing Bork, they would all suddenly realize that moral convictions have no place in politics after all?"

"It was a tremendous op­portunity and a once in a lifetime experience," said Rakow. 
While the Pope toured and lectured at the University of South Carolina, Rakow said that he remained within physical reach of the Pope to ensure nothing bad would happen. Rakow said secur­ity measures were very tight--even more so than for a political leader simply be­cause of the vast number of people that were present. The Pope's visit attracted phenomenal crowds at the campus stadium with a full capacitiy crowd of 72,000 people.

Pact rekindles NATO debate 
The Observei1Susan Coene 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The tenta­tive U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles has rekindled debate on whether NATO needs to beef up its conventional forces to match the Kremlin led Warsaw Pact. 
The powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the "real test" of the mis­sile deal will be whether the West can improve its conven­tional forces to cope with what he and other experts call a sig­nificant tilt in favor of the War­saw Pact. 
Nunn did not link a conven­tional force buildup to Senate ratification of the proposed pact on intermediate nuclear forces (INF). 
But he repeated a warning he made last April to North Atlan­tic Treaty Organization offi­cials in Brussels on the need for "a psychological link be­tween completing the withdrawal of all INF missiles from Europe and progress in separate conventional and chemical arms control negotia­tions." 
Nunn, asked Sunday on the  NBC-TV program "Meet the Press" whether he would vote against the arms treaty be­cause of the conventional forces imbalance, said: "well, I'm not going to decide how I'm going to vote on the treaty. I'm saying it's a big problem, and we should have gotten on it a long time ago." 
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, inter­viewed on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley," was more outspoken, calling the arms control agreement "a small step in the wrong direc­tion." 
"Basically it's a small step in the direction of taking out nuclear weapons in Europe while leaving the conventional balance, which heavily favors the Soviet Union, leaving all that in place," Aspin said. 
Secretary of State George Shultz, appearing on the same program, said, "There is a dif­ference between the Warsaw Pact forces and the NATO forces, and so we have had a conventional arms negotiation going on for some time. There will be a new one and we Will work at the business of bring­ing that into more equality, and I think that's important to do." 
In the meantime, however, Shultz said that "Europe will be more safe" because of the agreement on intermedidate­range missiles. 
"How can you say that we become militarily worse off when they eliminate about 2,000 warheads and we elimi­nate about 350?" he asked. "It boggles my mind that anbyody could think that. They don't do arithmetic.'' 
David Abshire, the former 
U.S. ambassador to NATO, warned earlier in the week that recent additions of tanks and helicopters had further tipped the balance in the Soviet favor. 
And Abshire, the chancellor of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Wash­ington, announced a new drive to lobby West European leaders to "push forward rapidly (with) meaningful con­ventional force improve­ments."

In a speech before the Royal Institute of International Af­fairs in London, Carrington urged that the West "not be carried away in a wave of eup­haria at the first sign of an arms agreement." 
Reshaping the Western arse­nal for a post-INF europe, in effect, will be NATO's agenda for at least the next five years and probably for some time after that, he said. 
At thelieart of the contention that NATO is outgunned is the imbalance in troop levels. ­

Opposition paper to be allowed 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua-The Sandinista government will al­low Nicaragua's opposition newspaper La Prensa to reopen, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto and a partner in the paper said Sunday. 
D'Escoto said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press in San Jose, Costa Rica, that the paper, closed June 26, 1986, would be allowed to resume publishing immedi­ately without prior censorship. 
Carlos Holmann, a partner in the paper, did not say in a brief telephone interview when the paper would reopen. 
Holmann said permission to reopen was the result of a meeting Saturday of President Daniel Ortega, Agrarian Reform Minister Jaime Wheelock and La Prensa co­owner Violeta Chamorro. 
Costa Rica's foreign mini­ster, Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, arranged the meeting and also participated in it. The reopen­ing first became known in Costa Rica because of his role. 
Pope fulfills promise to visit Canadian site 
Associated Press 
FORT SIMPSON, Northwest Territories -Welcomed by a drum song and a sacred fire, Pope John Paul II kept a prom­ise Sunday by visiting this sub­arctic outpost, where he spoke in support of native rights and warned Indians not to let "instability" undermine their society. 
A steady drizzle fell as the pope's plane arrived at an airstrip from Edmonton, Al­berta, at the end of his 10 day 
U.S. tour. But the sky brightened and a rainbow ap­peared as he was greeted by Indian and Canadian officials.

D'Escoto said, "Inspite of the fact that there is still a state of emergency, inspite of the fact that the Reagan adminis­tration is still waging war through its mercenaries, we are moving ahead and doing a series fo things, among which is allowing La Prensa to reopen." 
Ortega said earlier that the newspaper would not be al­lowed to publish again until the Reagan administration halted aid to the Contra rebels fighting his leftist government. 
The paper was closed a day after the U.S. House of Repre­sentatives approved $100 mil­lion in aid to the rebels. 
The government closed it temporarily twice and cen­sored it so extensively that it missed publication 35 times. The closure and censorship both came under the state of emergency, first declared in March 1982. 
The permission to reopen was the latest in a series of liberalization moves by the Sandinista government. 
4,000 Dene Indians huddled un­der white plastic raincoats in front of a 55 foot tepee. 
The chair on which the pope sat during the Mass was made from moose antlerstand hide.

P.O. Box Q 
Humor helps all deal with troubles 
Dear Editor: 
I read last week's Scholastic cartoon, "Life in Hell," and I laughed. I took it for what it was--humorous satire. Nevertheless, a group of vociferous prigs would have Scholastic edit even our comic strips because they believe that the spectre of racism lurks behind every door. Enough is enough, if these guardians of social virtue cannot tolerate the funnies, how will they pos­sibly endure the realities of life? There lies the crux of the issue--we all need a sense of humor to travail life's many pitfalls. Humor reflects the tragic more often than the joyful in life. Jonathan Swift, an Irishman who knew a bit about humor and a lot about life, told us that humor was "odd, grotesque, and wild." "Life in Hell" was all those things, but more importantly, it was funny. 
William Joseph Sammon Alumni Hall 
Inauguration an event for everyone 
Dear Editor: 
It will be on every newscast. It will be in every newspaper. It will be on every radio station. And you have the opportunity to be there--the Inaugura­tion of Father Malloy. Never before have there been Inaugural ceremonies to install the president of the University of Notre Dame. We are Notre Dame students at a rare and extremely im­portant time in Notre Dame's history. 
Inauguration day will begin with mass at 10:00 a.m. in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center Arena. Father Malloy will celebrate for all students, faculty and guests. 
The formal installation of Father Malloy as president will begin at 3:00 in the arena of the JACC. At this Aca­demic Convocation, Donald R. Keough, chairman of the University of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees and the pres­ident and CEO of The Coca-Cola Com­pany, and Father Hesburgh will pres­ent Father Malloy with the symbols of office. All students are invited to this special Notre Dame moment. 
Finally, beginning at 5:30 on the 
South Quad, we students will have our 
own reception for Father Malloy. Our 
student picnic will be complete with 
live entertainment and a special 
presentation to Father Malloy. 
We are encouraging all students to 
attend and enjoy the inaugural fes­
tivities on Wednesday, September 23. 
Father Malloy would greatly appreci­
ate the support of the student body at 
this milestone in his life. His concern 
and closeness to the students can only 
be strengthened by student interest and 
participation in the inaugural events. 
This is a rare opportunity to be a part 
of a strategic moment in Notre Dame 
history.

Sexist signs show lack of respect 
Dear Editor: 

For several weeks now, as I have traveled across campus, I have been forced to see a series of quotations posted in a first floor window of Cavanaugh Hall. All of these quotes have focused on one subject--women. For those who have seen the signs, there is no need for me to explain their nature. All of these "quips" have been derogatory and insulting towards wo­men. Ranging from implications about treating women with physical abuse to suggestions about "fencing in" a nearby girls dorm, these remarks have been tasteless, sexist and downright crude. 
Perhaps, these quotations are meant lightly; just as a joke; all in good fun. But since these signs are made avail­able to the public, and their producer is not, we have no idea what his inten­tions are. In light of this, and the nature of the comments, I do not find these quotes very amusing. I would hope that students of Notre Dame have respect for all people, regardless of sex, class, or race. 
Furthermore, it surprises me that nothing has been done about these signs. The Observer should have been overflowing with letters on the subject. We are part of a university that believes in equality for all; we are part of a student body that opposes injustice in all its forms, yet no one has criticized this practice. I am shocked that no other man or woman on this campus has made a public statement regarding these quotes. Equality and respect are usually not given freely; they need to be demanded. On behalf of the women of Notre Dame, and of all persons who 
believe in equality, I am  demanding  
some respect.

Sound judgement must guide choices 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the letter from a Keenan Hall freshman who found his doubts somewhat alleviated by the sight of the Dome. It seems a bit premature to consider transferring to another university because one does not feel the "flame of enlightenment burning within" after the first week of classes. This notwithstanding, any stu­dent who, despite his dislike for the in­stitution remains at a university simply because it has a "really special dome" is very confused. 

I think we can all appreciate the mixed feelings of a freshman entering any college. However, Notre Dame is a great university with a tradition of excellence in academia and in graduat­ing productive, mature adults. The complaints of a petulant 18-year old who (in his visits to 5 to 15 colleges) either never came here and never talked to a student, or himself over­looked the essential factors of parietals and the Alcohol Policy, should not be of serious concern. 
I hope that this student decides to remain at Notre Dame, and that he has a wonderful college experience. In or­der for this to happen, however, he will need to get his priorities straight and to make some clear-headed judge­ments. In the meantime, I am not sure that the campus newspaper should be the forum for his emotionally charged questioning of what the university has to offer.

Cartoon must be taken in context 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to respond to Cheryl Ann Leslie's column titled "Cartoon's Ra­cial Slur Inappropriate" of Sept. 16. I was greatly disturbed by her reaction to Matt Groening's cartoon. Cheryl felt the reference to blacks might as well have been a slap in the face. I am sorry she feels that way, because it seems to be because she did not understand the strip. 
Matt Groening writes about "Life in Hell." His comics are about the absur­dities of life and his sarcastic responses to this world. All of our lives, we are taught how to think, and to behave, by people who really know no more than we do. Mr. Groening depicted the eighth grade teacher as a type of white, middle class woman who became a teacher because she enjoyed the feeling of superiority. She wanted to gain the respect she never received previously in her life. Didn't you have two or three teachers like that growing up? The all­knowing mind-manipulator of our ear­lier years is the type of teacher Matt Groening was trying to relate to us. There were, and still are, some teach­ers in all-white schools who hold prejudices against blacks. The eighth­grader in the comic strip had grown up in the all-white school with authority figures such as his teacher. They in­stinctively induced a fear into the minds of their students. 
Being open-minded might help Cheryl to understand the comic strip. It wasn't meant to offend anyone. I sin­cerely feel that Matt Groening was trying to convey an experience that most of us could relate to. 
Cheryl said she was offended and em­barrassed that the University had al­lowed the strip to be printed. Such hasty interpretations of media can lead to a stifling, not to mention boring, society. This University cannot always protect us from the things we don't like. 
I am not prejudiced, nor was I in­sulted by the comic strip. I consider myself to be reasonably mature, and I found the strip humorous. I hope you can see the point I have tried to make.

Author of 'Red October' depicts 'people in crisis' 
Associated Press 
T
om Clancy was an English major in college, but he earned his living as an insur­ance agent until his first novel, "The Hunt for Red October," became a best seller in 1985. 
That book. which was pub­lished by the Naval Institute Press of Annapolis, Md., has sold more than 300, 000 copies in hardcover and three million in paperback. It was based on newspaper articles in the mid­1970s about a Soviet destroyer whose crew unsuccessfully at­tempted to defect to Sweden. 
Clancy's latest novel, "Patriot Games," was published two weeks after his second novel, "Red Storm Rising," appeared in paperback. 
"Red Storm Rising," based on a scenario for a war game, was published in 1986. It was on the hardcover best-seller lists for nearly a year and has sold more than one million copies. Paperback sales are expected to be in the millions. 
"It is rather amazing that all my books are best sellers," Clancy said in a telephone in­terview. But he insists, "any­one can write a novel," adding that his computer--and "a su­perb editor"--help his work go relatively smoothly. 
Clancy became an insurance agent shortly after graduating from Loyola College in his na­tive Baltimore in 1969. He didn't start writing fiction until 1982, when he decided to write "something I could be proud of." 
He no longer works at the small insurance agency in rural Maryland that he and his wife purchased in 1980, although

his wife, Wanda, still works there. 
These days, Clancy spends much of his time at home, working at his computer. He starts at 8:30 in the morning, putting in four to six hours a day. He is working on his fourth novel, which is sched­uled to be finished at the end of this year. 
The walls of Clancy's office at his suburban home are lined with about 3,000 books, many of which reflect the author's life-ion~ fascination with tech­nology. Clancy has been reading military books since childhood. 
"I mainly like technology, and the military has the nicest toys," he says. However, Clancy adds, contrary to what his fans might think. not all of the books in his study are about weapons. 
Although his novels have been described as being filled with technical details about mil­itary hardware and weaponry, Clancy says "the technology is overstated." He says he would rather describe his books as being about "people in crisis." 
for example, Clancy says one of the points he is trying to make in his latest novel is that "victims of terrorism aren't abstractions." 
Jack Ryan, the hero of "Red October," returns in "Patriot Games" to battle a renegade terrorist group. 
Clancy says the main ques­tions the novel asks are: "What is terrorism? What are the ter­rorists after? What is their methodology? How should we deal with terrorism as a fact of life?" 
Ryan will appear once again 

in Clancy's next novel, which the author says will have some­thing to do with a CIA "mole" in Moscow. 
"People in the military like my characters," Clancy says. "I was in England on vacation not long ago, and the captain of a surface warship in the Royal Navy told me how much he en­joyed my books because Qf how well I understand my characters." 
His novels have a global political-military theme, telling of events that could happen in the current world situation. And "Red Storm Rising" is now being used as a textbook at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., Clancy says. 
However, the author doesn't claim to have a "crystal ball," and says his books should not be viewed as being a prediction of the future. 
With no military, political or: government training--except fOr! two years in the Army ROTC during college--Clancy says he gets his information from tech­nical manuals, conversations with former military officials, books, and periodicals. 
Clancy, who lives with his 

wife and four children in Prince 
frederick. Md., 40 miles from 
Washington, D.C., says the ma­
terial changes brought by 
becoming a best-selling author 
aren't the important things. 
"''m still a good father," Clancy says. "The most impor­tant thing is being a good fa­ther to your kids." 
And what do his children-­

ages 22 months to 14 years-­
think about their best-selling 
father? "They don't pay any 
attention to it. I'm still Dad<i}'."

The stock market and the Dow; Boone ups stock bid a look at what makes them up takeover resisted 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN Business Writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a series of stories about how Notre Dame students can in­vest their money. 
There are numerous oppor­tunities afforded by the stock market for an individual to in­vest and earn money. 
Wall Street in New York City is home to the most famous part of the market: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
It is here that more than 150 million shares of 2000 stocks change hands every business day. 
In addition, stocks are traded daily on the American Ex­change, the Over the Counter market and regional ex­changes, as well as on foreign markets. 
Most investors familiarize themselves with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), a popular guide of the movement of thirty active stocks. The DJIA is determined by the price changes of these stocks and by 
how  often  these  stocks  are  
bought and sold.  
These  thirty  stocks  are  

mostly large, blue-chip com­panies taken from all areas of the economy. 
Blue-chip companies are well known companies which are leaders in their industries. 
McDonalds, Exxon, and 
Woolworths are three of the 
stocks that make up the DJIA. 
Starting in the latter part of 

1982, the market averages and 
indexes, such as the Dow Jones, 
have been rising. This type of 
a market is refered to as a bull 
market. A falling market is 
known as a bear market. 
The Dow commenced a slow 

steady climb from the 1200 
level in 1982, to its present level 
of 2524. There have been set­
backs, such as last year's in­
sider trading scandal and sum­
mer slumps, but a strong 
outlook on the economy and 
relatively low levels of un­
employment, inflation and in­
terest rates have fueled this 

marathon rally. 
Wall Street 
at 

NO Ave. 
1987 has been a good year for 

the Dow Jones Average. The 
Average set a new high in each 
of the first thirteen trading 
days this year, breaking the 
2000 level in the process. 
The Dow closed at 2405.54 on 

April 6, its peak before the 
April-May slump. The DJIA 
slipped below 2220 on May 20 
before embarking on a 500 point 
rise. 
The purpose of this series IS 

to provide a basic understand­ing of the stock market and the investment horizon for that exists for individual investors with limited funds --something to which we can all relate. 
Many potential individual in­vestors are content to let their money earn the standard pas­sbook savings rate of 5 V4 per­cent. 
An informed investor will realize the advantages of placing extra funds in the stock market. It is possible to diver­sify the investments one holds, called a portfolio, even with just a few thousand dollars. 
In addition, unlike certain Certificate of Deposits (CO's), investors can get their money out of the market at any time. This liquidity factor is made possible by the immense num­ber of buyers and sellers in the marketplace. 
Studies have shown that the average long-term return on market investments is approx­imately nine percent. Of course, this is not guaranteed as are savings accounts and CO's, but an investor in the market has to be willing to ac­cept more risk in order to gain more return. 
With the help of a broker, an investor can find the invest­ments with which he is com­fortable. 
The second segment of this series will discuss the selection of a broker and the services provided by a brokerage firm. 
Dow Jones falls 3.26 points;
triple witching hour passes 
By STEVE CLAEYS Business Writer 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 3.26 points to 2524.64 points on Friday. 
Friday's decline contributed to a weekly loss of 84.10 points. 
This was the largest weekly drop since the Dow fell 141.03 points during the week of 9-8 to 912 in 1986. 
Approximately 188.Q7 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Investors were cautious be­cause Friday was 1 of 4 "triple witching hours" during the year. 
Triple witching hours are the day when the quarterly stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks expire. 
COUNSELINE Volunteers WantedI!!

look nice on your resume or application to grad school (listening, psych majors?) 
...then ask for Tim at the University 
Counseling Cenrer or just leave a 
message. 239-7336. 
A future is a type of invest­ment in which an investor at­tempts to predict the value of a stock or the average of a group of stocks at a set expera­tion time. If the investor predicts correctly then he will receive a return for his invest­ment. 
The set experation time for some of these futures is the third Friday of every third month. 
Investors in stock futures on these days at times will buy and sell stocks in order to cause stock and stock average prices to equal the values they predicted. 
This activity may cause the market to fluctuate with prices rising and falling wildly. It is because of these unpredictable price swings on the days when the stock futures expire that in­vestors call them triple witch­ing hours. 
New rules introduced to prevent wide price fluctuations from stock futures have been introduced. Apparently these measures have been effective in light of the market's small drop on Friday. 
Pessimism from the triple witching hour was offset by good news from the Commerce Department. 
The department announced on Friday that the U.S. eco­nomy grew an annual rate of 
2.5 percent in the second quar­ter of the year. 
This growth was stimulated by the manufacturing sector of the economy. 
T. Boone Pickens and his Ivanhoe Partners have upped their offer for Newmont Mining Company to $105 per share from $95 per share for 28 million shares (Business Briefs September 14). Newmont's Board recommended that share­holders reject the initial $95 offer. The new bid helped raise Newmont's share price to Friday's close of $101.125. There is speculation that Pickens may have to raise the bid again if his second bid is not accepted by its expiration date of October 5.

Business Bits 


Liberal Beat: The United Auto Workers union won a 
milestone contract last week, securing job guarantees at 
Ford Motor Corporation. For the next three years, Ford will 
not close any plant~, will not eliminate any positions and will 
replace half of the workers who retire or quit. Ford .lost 
flexibility through the new contract, but the stock remamed 
stable on Wall Street this week. Ford has already adjusted 
its workforce for the next few years to avoid damage to its 
bottom line. The automaker can shrink its workforce again 
when the new contract expires. 
For years, acid rain legislation has been stalled on Capitol Hill. The big business lobby representing the coal industry has contended that the amount of money spent in complying with the regulations would halt research of clean coal facilities, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. Clean coal projects promise to burn coal with less eromisions of ozone damaging chemicals. A new Clean Air Act bill threatens to saddle the coal industry with billions of dollars of capital investments to reduce emmisions immediately. 
Another Japanese first in the auto industry. Honda Motor is planning to build cars in the United States and export them. This move has long-term financial implications. The Japanese auto maker will likely export these vehicles to West­ern European nations. Through builting the cars in America, Honda will get around the import fees that -Europeans have charged for cars made in Japan. In addition, the dollar is weak versus European currency, thus providing another fin­ancial benefit to Honda. However, the actual shipping of U.S.-Honda cars will not take place for at least two years. Honda is betting on the current dollar situation to continue so that this move will be profitable in the long-run. 
The last word: While speaking about impending eco­nomic doom in The Wall Journal, Mr. John B. Neff, a famous investment advisor: "You've got interest rates increasing, you have an economic expansion that's mature, we're going to have a recession at some point, and we may even get a Democratic Administration."

Safety 
continued from page 16 
Montgomery's ensuing free kick only traveled to the Spar­tan 46, but the Michigan State defense stuffed the Irish, forc­ing them to punt. 
Try as they might, however, the Spartan defense could not measure up to Notre Dame's "No Name Defense" which is fast losing its anonymity. 
"They're talking about me winning the Reisman," said Brown of the Irish D, "but I think those guys deserve it." 
A fierce pass rush that regis­tered eight sacks and kept Mic­higan State quarterback Bobby McAllister on the run, held the Spartans to 21 yards in net rushing, and caused four turn­overs was the result of a game plan that surprised the Spar­tans, and some of the Irish defenders. 
"They blitzed more than we had ever seen, and it was a good scheme," said Michigan State coach George Perles. "The sacks really are a motivating factor for the other team and it really doesn't do a whole lot for your team. They really take away a lot." 
"All we worked on all week was cutbacks and draws," said linebacker Darrell 'Flash' Gor­don. "We had no idea we were going to blitz this much but it certainly did work well." 
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the defensive perfor­mance, however, was its abil­ity to keep Reisman hopeful Lorenzo White (51 yards on 19 carries) and McAllister from breaking big plays until the game was out of reach. That containment was an area of concern after Jamie Morris en­really well today,'' said nose tackle Mike Griffin. "We were caught a little out of position a couple times on draws last week, so we were really con­centrated on that aspect in practice this week. We didn't want to over-pursue and we were able to stay and plug things up better.'' 
joyed  some  success  on  draw  
plays last week.  
"We  stayed  in  our  lanes  

Mter Brown's display gave the Irish a 19-0 lead, the defense also got into the scoring column. With the Spartans at their own two-yard line, Ted Fitzgerald and Jeff Kunz hit McAllister and Kunz hung on to score Notre Dame's second safety of the game, and push the lead to 21-0. 
Mter the Irish made it 24-0 with a field goal with eight seconds left in the first half, the defense took over again. Cedric Figaro blindside-shot on McAl­lister caused a fumble that Tom Gorman recovered at the Michigan State 13. 
Anthony Johnson tunneled in from three yards out four plays later to end the Irish scoring on the day. 
A 57-yard touchdown pass from McAllister to Andre Rison with 1:06 left ended Notre Dame's bid for a shutout, but did not dampen the enthusiasm about the performance. 
"We've paid our dues," said co-captain Chuck Lanza. "This isn't luck. We know we're so well-prepared for each game so we have an air of confidence. That's why we feel so good when we step on the field." 
All of which left Holtz with a satisfied smile on his face. 
"This football team has an awful lot of things going for it," he said. 
The Observer 

EXTRA POINTS ... Notre 
Dame's early success hasn't 
gone unnoticed. Pete Williams, 
one of two Orange Bowl repre­
sentatives in the press box for 
Saturday's game said the Irish 
have impressed him. "The 
defense is much better than I 
expected," Williams said. 
"There aren't many teams that 
are 2-0 that have beaten the 
caliber of opponents Notre 
Dame has.'' Williams said rep­
resentatives were also attend­
ing the Clemson-Georgia 
game. . . Brown's two punt 
returns in a game ties an NCAA 
record. Vince McNaly was the 
only other Notre Dame player 
to do it, returning two punts for 
scores against Beloit in 1926. 

Garcia Lane, of Ohio State, was 
the last player to accomplish 
the feat (1983 vs. 
Purdue).

was recovered by Tom Gorman of the Irish. The relentlessness of the defense, even until late into the game when the out­come was decided, was ex­tremely impressive. It isn't of­ten that a team with a bona fide Heisman Trophy candidate like White is held to 51 net yards rushing for-the game. Mter two games, Notre Dame has forced 11 turnovers and given up only one: Andrysiak's meaningless end-of -the-half prayer that was picked off last week at Michigan. Does this sound like the squad that dropped five games by a total of 14 points last year? No, this team knows it can win. This team takes the field expecting to come off with a win, not a close game. This team doesn't wrap its arms around you and spin you down on a sack, it drives through you with the in­tention of knocking the ball loose. Darrell "Flash" Gordon and Figaro left no doubt in McAllister's mind that he was sacked after their brutal sacks. The defense is playing with a vengeance. 
But the one area that was es­

pecially noteworthy was the in­
spired play of the Irish special 
teams. Of course, much will b~ written of Tim Brown's blazing speed and ability to cut on a dime without even thinking about slowing down on his punt returns, and deservedly so. Brown is an incredible athlete, but he had to have at least a little blocking to run two punts back for scores. 
Although kicker Ted Gradel m_issed a second-quarter field goal, his kickoffs were more than adequate for a walk-on with two extra-points of expe­rience before this year. The kickoff team didn't allow a run­back of more than 18 yards. Add Grunhard's downing of a punt on the two and Phelan's surprising 47-yard average (no fluke, either-that average was over eight kicks) and the Irish special teams had a heck of a night. 
"They're a great group of guys," Head Coach Lou Holtz responded when asked if he now thinks Notre Dame is a great team. "We have played two . football games and had some good things happen to us. But I think great teams are classified on January 2." 
They've had some good thing happen to them, but the Irish are starting to make some good things happen for themselves, and those things can only lead to more good results. 
Knock on wood. 
Milwaukee Open all wet 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE-A downpour Sunday delayed the finish of the $600,000 Greater Milwaukee Open until Monday at the ear­liest and raised all kinds of water-related questions for the four co-leaders -not to mention tournament officials. 
Dan Pohl, one of the four gol­fers at 15-under par when play was suspended at 3:05 p.m., spoke of the dreaded "mud­caked" golf ball, when a drive lands and then goes nowhere. 
Bill Kratzert, who had to can­cel a scheduled outing to return Monday, suggested that, "if it keeps raining, the bunkers could be like water hazards." 
Wayne Levi mentioned the "fat, squirter type shot" that golfers have been experiencing on the water-soaked, 7,030­yard, par-72 Tuckaway Country Club course. 
Pohl, Kratzert, Levi and Gary Hallberg were at 15­under-par but all had at least 11 holes to complete when play was scheduled to resume 8: 30 

a.m. Monday. The forecast called for possible showers. 
According to tournament of­ficials, the fact that half the golfers -15 of 29 groups to be exact managed to complete the fourth round meant it had to be completed, if not Monday then some other time in the fu­ture. 
"Continuing play Tuesday is not an option," said PGA spokesman Dave Lancer, ex­plaining that contracts for the tournament do not run through Tuesday. 
Pohl said Sunday's first rain delay, which lasted just under 80 minutes, did not hurt his play. 
"I came out after the first delay and got four birdies," he said. "I sat out on the fourth tee for over an hour."

HOWl ADE 818,000FOR COLLEGE 


BY WORKING WEEKENDS." 


When my friends and I graduated from high school, we all took part-time jobs to pay for college. 
They ended up in car washes and hamburger joints, putting in long hours for little pay. 
Not me. My job takes just one weekend a month and two weeks a year. Yet, I'm earning $18,000 for college. 
Because I joined my local Army National Guard. 
They're the people who help our state during emergencies like hurri­canes and floods. They're also an important part of our country's military defense. 
So, since I'm helping them do such an important job, they're helping me make it through school. 
As soon as I finished Advanced Training, the Guard gave me a cash bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New GI Bill, I'm getting another $5,000 for tuition and books. 
Not to mention my monthly Army Guard paychecks. They'll add up to more than $11,000 over the six years I'm in the Guard. 
And if I take out a college loan, the Guard will help me pay it back-up to $.1,500 a year, plus interest. 
It all adds U{> to $18,000-or more -for college for JUSt a little of my time. And that's a heck of a better deal than any car wash will give you. 
THE GUARD CAN HELP PUT YOU THROUGH COLLEGE, TOO. SEE YOUR LOCAL RECRUITER FOR DETAILS, CALL TOLL-FREE 800-638-7600,* OR MAIL THIS COUPON.
