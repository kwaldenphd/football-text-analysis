The opponents won despite concessions voted Wednesday that would have prohibited all commercial SST flights over U.

There is no organized 
opposition to the new 
Constitution proposed by the 
Krashna administration, 
according to Stay Senators Tom 
Thrasher and Russ Stone, two 
noted adversaries of the new 
constitution. 
"I am not going to engage in 
a formal, poobah oppostion to 
the Constitution. Most students 
are sick of student government; 
sick of student politicians telling 
1thein what to do", stated 
Thrasher. 
Both Thrasher and Stone said 
they would encourage students 
they met and talked with, to 
vote either against the 
Constitution or not to vote at 
all. Thrasher gave two reasons 
for opposing the new 
Constitution. The first was that 
the best way · to increase the 
power and effectiveness of the 
student legislative body, would 
be to keep the Student Senate. 
If this was done, Thrasher felt 
that the ambitious, active 
members of the Senate would 
vote definitive changes into the 
organization that would expand 
its powers and responsibilities. 
Thrasher's second objection 
was that the proposed 
constitution doesn't tackle any 
of the larger problems of the 
Student Government. He 
described the new Constitution 
as basically the same as the old 
one, except that the new 
Constituiton is minus the 
Senate. 
Speaking of the new 
Constitution, Thrasher said, "It 
fails to reform many defects in 
the Constitution we are working 
under now e.g. the confusion 
surrounding the method to carry 
out a referendum".

W'ITH MAX SHULMAN 
(By the author of Rally Round the Fla(J, Boys ... Dobie Gillis ... etc.) 
Economics, and Other Unsolved Crirnes 
As you know of course, economics is often called "the dismal 
science," but not because it's dismal. Oh mercy, no! In fact, it's a laff 
riot! It's called "the dismal science" only because that's the name of 
the Englishman who invented it back in 1681-Walter C. Dismal. 
Mr. Dismal, curiously enough, wasn't trying to invent economics at all. Actually, he was trying to invent plankton, but as you know of course, Max Planck beat him to it. (This later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.) 
And so spunky Mr. Dismal went back to the old drawing board and stayed .there till he invented economics. Then tired but happy, he rushed to Heidelberg University to announce his findings. But, alas, he arrived during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and naturally everybody was yodelling and couldn't hear what Mr. Dismal was say­ing. And so, alas, he slank back home and died, old and embittered at the age of 11. (This later became known as the Black Tom Explosion.) 
Well sir, p.fter ~\1r. Dismal, nothing much happened in Europe un­less you want to count the Dardanelles. Then in 1776 Adam Smith of Scotland got tired of the cough drop business he had started with his brother and published his famous Wealth of Nations (or Moll Flanders as it is generally known as) and the world came to realize what a jolly, uncomplicated subject economics really is. 
It all boils down to this: when there is a great demand for a prod­uct, there is a great supply on the market. When there is a small de­mand, there is a small supply. Take, for example, knee-cymbals. You walk into your average American middle-sized town today and I'll wager you won't see more than eighty or ninety knee-cymbal vendors. That's because the demand is small. 
With Miller High Life Beer, on the other hand, you'll see a great supply because there is a great demand. And of course the demand is great because the beer is great. And, mark you, I'm not asking you to take my word for it. Prove it yourself with this simple test: 
Get a can or bottle of Miller High Life and pour a few ounces into an empty vessel-your roommate, for example. Observe how his jaw unslacks with pleasure, how the torpidity leaves his tiny eyes, how he drops his yo-yo and whimpers for more. Could mere words tell you one-quarter as we!I what a great beer Miller is? Of course not. 
"Great," in fact, is the single adjective that describes Miller Beer best (except possibly "wet"). Indeed some people are so overcome with admiration for Miller's greatness that they can't bear to drink it. They just sit with a glass of Miller in hand and admire it for as long as ten or twelve years on end. The makers of Miller Beer are of course touched by this reverence, except of course for Clyde R. Greedy, the sales manager. 
But I digress. Adam Smith, as you know of course, was followed by David Ricardo. In fact, he was followed everywhere by Mr. Ricardo. He finally got so annoyed that he summoned a booby, as British policemen are called, and had Mr. Ricardo arrested. (This later be­came known as the Humboldt Current.) 
Upon his release from gaol, as British jails are called, Mr. Ricardo married Thomas Robert Malthus and one night over a game of whist they invented the stock exchange, or chutney as it is called in England. 
Next, economics spread to France (carried, some say, by sheep ticks). The French, however, never really got the hang of it. At first they tried using omelettes as the medium of exchange. When this failed, they tried Edith Piaf records. When this too failed, they flew into a fit of pique and dug the Suez Canal. 
Well sir, I guess you know what happened next. Economics came to America, John Kenneth Galbraith fought his famous duel with Aaron Burr, Gresham's Law was repealed, and at last came the happy ending. Today, I am delighted to report, any American boy or girl, no matter how rich, can afford to dress like a pauper.

We at Miller High Life Beer are brewers, not economists. But this much we know about supply and demand: you demand great flavor in your beer; we supply it--Miller, the Champagne of Beers.

Porst announced that for the upcoming Rare Earth concert in Stepan there will be no chairs in order to allow students and pa­trons to bring blankets and there will be ·a better sound system than that at the Pacific Gas and Electric concert. The reaction to this concert by the students will determine the future of next semesters concerts in Stepan. If it is well received we shall see more of such activities. 
As of now all the ~.:ontracts, construction deadlines, raffle packets and groups have been completed for Mardi Gras and the CJ F. Porst will announce the various groups at a later date. There will be three ~.:oncerts in the ACC in the spring. They are on February 5 for Mardi Gras, April 3, and May l. 
The student body president during the first week he is elected chooses the director of the student union administration who then, within a week, picks the heads of the various com­m Jsswns. Each commissioner then picks his staff. To get a position of authority one liter­ally has to work his way up in order to learn all the ropes. There are three ways in which to join the SUSC. One way is the general applications accepted at the beginning of each school year. Openings are made known throughout the year through the Observer and one could get in by the recommendations of an ex­ecutive member. There are approximately l 00 students in­volved in the SUSC.

Pursley declines invitation 
and Missy Un­of the down, the Academic Commis­sion forwarded an invitation to Bishop Pursley and Monsignor James Conroy to present their views to the students directly. About this Metzger commented, "If someone attacks you through the press or mail, you ought to bring that man before those he attacks to explain his position." 

SUAC did not immediately receive a reply, so it followed up the invitation with a teiegram asking for one. The members had offered the bishop a choice of ten speaking dates, and gave him this reason for the invita­tion: "Your comments...reveal a certain concept of the 'Catho­lic University' which we assure you has not ·been sufficiently encouraged here.

BRUCE RIECK, Business Manap 
FOUIDED IIOVEMIER t 1-NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Editor's Desk by Glen S. Corso 
"Quit birdwatching and keep your eye out for sneaky radicals!" 

"The honor and obligation" 
"The press has had great honor and equally great obligation imposed upon it by the Constitution in the interests, of course, of full and accurate public information. It is the high duty ofthis press to deserve that distinction, that sacred trust on all occasions. It is its duty to print the truth, ALL the truth and nothing but the truth as news"---W. R. Hearst, June 13, 1941. 
Noble words from a man whose newspapers were most famous for their frequent violations of that trust which he eloquently expounded. Yet an"y newspaper, in order to maintain respect, must uphold that obligation. 
For a campus newspaper this task is especially difficult. The temptations to distort the truth to gain political ends is keen, especially when student editors realize they have a largely captive audience. If this is done, the publication ceases to be a newspaper, and becomes a propaganda rag. 
In order to be a newspaper, a publication must tell the truth in its news columns. There are unavoidable lapses, more than in a professional paper. Such is the nature· of students. These lapses must be corrected as quickly as possible. They are nothing to be ashamed of, as long as they are unintentional. 
The people running the paper must develop a sense of what is right and what is wrong with the community they serve. They must then strive to focus the harsh glare of publicity on the wrongs and in the editorial pages, call for their correction. 
During the past semester, often with a great deal of difficulty, The ObserJJer has tried to live up to the standards of an accurate and responsible journal. At times there have been lapses, sometimes serious ones. Much of the news has been fair and free of the taint of bias. The editorials have critidzc-d things which we believe do not serve the students, and praised things that do. A wide range of views have been presented in the column slot. Writers who have felt restricted by daily deadlines have been given long range assignments, which have resulted in a number of Obsen,er Insights. 
There is still a great task ahead of us. Some reporters lack an adequate knowledge of the inner workings of various campus and administrative organizations. The number of errors in news stories must be reduced. Long range in-depth examination of several important issues -such as minority students and the quality of academic life at Notre Dame must be explored. 
We feel we possess the capabilities to adequately measure up to the task before us. We must and shall exploit them as best we can.

The quality .of an album stands in inverse proportion to the amount of time spent waiting for it, the amount of historical significance attributed to it before the fact, and the relish with which the package is opened. Now this might be my fault and it might he his, but Stephen Stills has failed to do it. It is what we wanted AI Kooper, Pau.l McCartney and Neil Young to do. Make the kind of music that comes along only once every few years, something that really shakes us up, gives us a charge, reaffirms our faith in the three-chord progression and the sixteen track studio. In other words, gives us the ultimate, but at least every three or four months. So next in line is Stephan Stills, superboy wonder virtuoso, king of the lilting voice and tasteful guitar, and he surely will do it. Just like all the rest of them didn't, and he doesn't, just like all the rest of them did. The album is nice, but hardly up to our expectations, which, at the hasty  soul, but he tries to do it with such overbearing blackness that it stinks. The first hint is in "Love the One You're With", in which the vocal is embellished with soul-chorus backup-type singing. Here it isn't real bad, just a little distract­ing. But in "Church", he crams those "you knows", "oh yeahs", and "you sees" in there, in every possible place where they \von't fit, just like a real soul brother, but, you see, ht: isn't, and it shows. Finally, there are the lyrics. When lyrics are mediocre, you don't notice them much at all. When they are good, you remember them for a long time. When they are bad, they jump right off the turntable at you the tlrst time yoL hear the tune. That happens several times in the Stills album. "You see it's my thing to be a part of someone"; "Round, round, up and down, all along the lonely town", and so on, so that I finally feel justified in my disappointment. Is this, could this be, the same guy who wrote  ..well, I guess he does, I ~ean it says so and all, but God he sounds just like Stills. On the. next cut, Stills does a very nice guitar lead-in, but it soundsiikc Hendrix. Finally, Clapton soles, and removes all doubts that there might be a misprint on the album cover, because he sounds like Clapton-that is to say, repetitious. But here comes the kicker, that is to say, the most intriguing thing about the album, preceeded by a rather poor bit of transition. If you listen to the second tune on side two, you'll ~wear you re listening to...(suspense)....Neil Young! It's all there: the haunting, .steely guitar sound, the vibes and rolling cymbals, the theatrical piano lines, the melody, the voice--amazing! Stilts may not like Young too much (well, they've had a long history of not getting on real well, and besides, the last song, "We Are Not Helpless", seems to be kind of a grabber just in case you don't catch what he's up to in "To a Flame") but man, he sure  Which brings us back rather cleverly (not neatly, just cleverly) to the question of does Stills know what makes Stills go. I'd like to say that any failure in this album comes from the audience, that we seem to be expecting too much from one little tired musician, and that we should be happy with an album that is meant to be a set of nice, listenable tunes. But that would work only if we can be sure that a set of nice tunes was all that Stills was up to here, and, much as I'd like to, I can't believe that that is the case. Because Stills seems to be aware of himself as a rock-art phenomenon (notice how many of his tunes are autobiographical); I think he knows that people are trying to make a legend out of him, and I think he tried, by attempting a display 0 f virtu9si_ty in variety, to accomodate them; the worst thing is that he failed, but the search will continue, and I hear the new Harrison album....

Giamecocks invade N.D 
The Irish Eye 

»:::=:::====~=:::::=:=:=:=:::=:=:=:::=:=:=:::=:=:=:=:::=================:::=:::==============:===========================:NO Cfoss 
On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Notre Dame's campus was rapidly losing its 7,000 plus population to the highways exiting Northern Indiana. The campus was a rather quiet and peaceful place. The usual number of people tromping through the snow on the South Quad were gone. The North Dining Hall looked almost barren. Notre Dame was a rather inactive setting. 
There was one place on campus where things were a hit more vibrant, however. This was the Sports Information Office of Roger Valdiserri located on the second t1oor in the Convocation Center. The SID's office and waiting rrom was packed with reporters and television people from as far away as Chicago. What was the occasion that drew all of these noted scribes to the fields of du Lac? This was the day that the Heisman Trophy winner would be announced. · 
Without a doubt one of Notre Dame's very sons was in Lop contention for this esteemed award. Joe Theismann was quite possibly going to be the man of the hour. It had narrowed down to a three way race for the coveted trophy named in honor of the former LSU coach. Jim Plunhtt, the Mexican-Irishman from Stanford who broke the NCAA career mark for total offense, was definitely in consideration. After all, he had that big magazine article written about him and the tough life that he has had to overcome. 
The too, there was a guy down in the good ol' South whose name was Elisha Archie Manning. Most people felt that the Heisman Trophy was nearly conceded to "Archie Who" after the NCAA pre-game show before Ole Miss. vs. Alabama, which included no less than the Ballad of Archie Who along with a film clip of Archie doing everything but selling the bright red buttons with his name on it. But Archie ran int0 two real tradedies. One, he lost to Southern Mississippi which Heisman Trophy winners aren't supposed to do. Two, he was injured in the seventh game of the season and after this there was little hope of a Heisman statue in the Manning household. 
Then of course there was Notre Dame's own Joe Theismann. He also had a few gimics in his favor. Wasn't his name pronounced with a certain familiarity dealing with the Trophy? Also, he had Roger Valdiserri backing him. Roger is one of the more likeable and more promotion-minded Sl D's in the country. 
So the stage was set for the big announcement. There seemed to be more general concern over the winner of the Heisman this year than any year in the past. Therefore on that cold November afternoon there was a squadron of reporters hoping they would be at the scene of the big announcement. 
The television people were busy setting up the lights they thought would be needed for the important interview and the radio and press men were making sure their mikes and tape recorders were in good order. The planned time of announcement would 1 00 p.m. Ev~ryone in the office was hoping for the all important call from New York. As the hour approached things started to quiet down in anticipation of the call. Shari Brown, Valdiserri's secretary (who also just happens to he Mrs. Joe Theismann as of tomorrow) sat nervously at her desk. 
The phone rang and the blonde answered, nearly dropping the receiver. "Sports Information. No, no we haven't received any word yet. It should be announced soon." A few chuckles went through the room when everyone realized what the call was about. 
During all of this, the quarterback himself was not actually in the office but out stalking around the Convo trying to pretend he wasn't nervous. Joe wasn't nearly as successful faking here as he is on a heper play. 
Finally the call did come. Assistant director Dave Kempton answered this time. "Yes, this is Notre Dame, go ahead. Oh, is that right. Well was it close. I see. Well I'm sure he deserves it. Thank you for letting us know." Everyone realized that Joe was ·not the winner of the Heisman. Someone said "Yeah, Plunkett won it. I think Joe was second." 
There was a few seconds hesitation and then some of the menia people suggested that it might still be a good story to get a few comments from the Irish all time offensive record holder. Joe went through the ordeal with dignity and pride. With his fiance at his side the wiry New Jerseyite replied to the queries. "Yes of course I'm disappointed. I'd be a fool to say I don't really care about the trophy. However, it doesn't mean all that much to me. My chief objective was to be on an undefeated Notre Dame team, not to win the Heisman Trophy. I'm sure Jim Plunkett is a worthy recipient of the award. I've only seen him play once and that was on TV against Arkansas this year. I was impressed. Still I'll be much happier with a National Championship than I would with the trophy." 
His attractive wife-to-be also responded to reporters, "To me he's the greatest football player that ever lived. l don't care what anyone else says." That was it. The reporters and cameramen packed up and were gone in a matter of minutes. The office was a quiet place again. There were only Joe, the two secretaries and a reporter left in the big office. 
It was at this point that Joe Theismann showed the type of stuff that true All-Americans are made of. He got on the phone and called long distance to New York. Jim Plunkett just happened to be in Fun City at this time and Joe wan ted to congratulate his rival. "Yes sir. I'd like to speak to Jim Plunkett. Yes sir, this is Joe Theismann from Notre Dame. (a few minutes pause) Oh, he isn't, well, please pass along my best wishes to him. I can't think of anyone who deserves this great honor more than Jim. He's a fine ball player and a fine man. Thanks for taking the message." Plunkett could not be reached but, as the saying goes, it's the thought that counts. 
Joe Theismann now had one more regular season game to look forward to. It too ended in folly. The heartbreaking loss to USC was innumerable times more disappointing for the Irish great than was the second-place finish in the Heism an voting. Even though Joe gave

He now has one chance left for redemption, and that will come hopefully against the nation's No. I team in the Cotton Bowl. Before that, however, Joe must call signals for one more important goal line situation. Tomorrow the automatic will simply be "I do." 
Best of luck, Joe, to both you and Shari. You are and always will be a credit to Notre Dame. 
IRISH EYE-TEM--This is the last week of the regular season on the collegiate scene. This season I have picked 257 out of 335 games for a percentage of '749. With but two big games on the schedule this week I'll try to get back up to the .750 mark. 
I see: 

Texas over Arkansas: The Razorbacks have the psychological advantage what with the revenge motive and all. The Horns are also absent a few key players. Possibly All-Americans Bill Attessis and Steve Worster will be out for this game with injuries. The Horns are still an overall better ball club. 
~,SU over Mississippi: The Tigers defense is just to tough. It's unhkely that Archie can play and that means Orange Bowl for the Bayou Tigers. · 






Winter sports 
Notre Dame's fencing, wrest­ling and swimming teams will open their seasons this week with the annual Notre Dame Invitational swimming meet the lone home event. 
The swimmers-host six schools at 7:00 p.m. Friday while the wrestlers participate in the two-day New York Tech Tournament over the weekend, the fencers travel to Lafayette, Ind. for a triangular match on Saturday at 6:00p.m. 
Coach Dennis Stark hopes .to push his club over last season's .500 mark and he will have to do so with a largely freshman team. Nine monogram winners were lost. But veteran John Sherk gives Stark good reason to be optimistic. Sherk has set varsity records in the 500 yard freestyle (5:01.2), the 1,000 yard free­style (I 0;39.I) and the I 00 yard butterfly (56.3). Those times are also Rockne Memorial Pool rec­ords. 
Another standout is Gene Krathaus. He holds a varsity r<~cord in the 50 yard freestyle, completing that distance in :22. I seconds, a time that also ties a pool mark. 
This year's captain-elect is James Cooney, a freestyler from Palm Beach, Florida. 
The Notre Dame wrestlers face the same problem as the swimmers--inexperience. Six starters are gone from last year's 6-6 team, inc! uding one of the best wrestlers in Notre Dame histroy, Jim Hansen. 
The Irish figure to shine in the heavyweight division. Junior Phil Gustafson, 260 pounds, returns from a 13-0-3 season to head all contenders. In addition to his obvious wrestling abilities Phil is a member of the Notre Dame football team's offensive line. 
Notre Dame captured the New York Tech Invitational last season finishing first out of six schools. ND is 1-0 this season with a win over St. Joe. 
Fencing Coach Mike DeCicco sized up his team's prospects this way, "We'II be real tough in both foil and epee, but we must improve in sabre if we are to better last season's results." 
Four men were lost from the 
20-2, 1969 team, accounting for 96 of the squad's 402 bout wins. But returning is All-America epeeist Rich Deladrier to bolster the Irish hopes. He joins Doug Daher and John Lyons as this year's tri-captains. 

second of the season for both
