In Brief 
CBS Inc. announced late Wednesday that it has agreed 
to sell its worldwide record division to electronics giant 
Sony Corp. of Japan for about $2 billion. The CBS records 
group has been increasingly profitable in recent years, 
helped by hits from entertainers such as Michael Jackson, 
Bruce Springsteen, Ricky Skaggs and Cyndi Lauper. CBS 
chairman William Paley said that CBS records "has con­
tributed so importantly to the history of music in our times. 
I am pleased to note that Sony has earned a global reputa­

A federal appeals court Wednesday ordered a teacher with AIDS reinstated, ruling for the first time that discrimination against AIDS victims is barred under civil rights laws protecting the handicapped. The 3-0 ruling by a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel came in the case of Vincent Chalk. Chalk, 43, had taught classes for the hearing-impaired in Orange County school for seven years before barred from the classroom by the county this fall because he had been diagnosed with AIDS in February.

Let's hear it for lowered expectations 
In grade school, a teacher once asked me, 
Tim

"What do you call somebody who thinks the entire world is out to get him?" 
O'Keefe
I answered, "A realist." Ever since then, I've had a reputation as a 
Copy editor 

bit of a pessimist. I don't mind that --it's ac­curate enough. But lately, it seems to me, pes­simism has been getting a bit of a bum rap. 

Everywhere I look, I see the virtues of op­timism trumpeted. 
Books with titles like "The Power of Positive Thinking" and "Choose Your Own Greatness" give blithe assurances that if you just have faith in yourself and think that nothing is impossible, then everything is possible. Reach for your dreams with confidence, and you won't fail, they say. 
News programs have inspirational, heart­warming stories about people who struggled against incredible odds and succeeded. When asked about how they did it, they say, "It was hard, but I knew from the start that if I set my mind to it and tried, I would make it." 
If you don't believe me, just go over to the bookstore and look at some of the cheesy posters that have uplifting messages like "You must believe to achieve." All of these things don't inspire me --they disgust and sicken me. 
The biggest problem I have with them is that they simply aren't true. Sure, it's nice to hear about people who tried and succeeded. But there are many people who, no matter how hard they try at something, will miserably fail --look at Gerry Faust. Simply having a positive atti­

tude doesn't guarantee success. 
In fact, a positive attitude is a liability. If people go into an endeavor absolutely con­vinced they will succeed, they will be totally unprepared for failure. Their self-images will be shattered, and their lives turned into meaningless travesties. They will become dis­illusioned and bitter --sort of like me. 
When I make some cynical comment about an "inspirational" human-interest story in the paper, sometimes people say, "That's horrible how could you say that? Would you rather not have the quadruple amputee swim the Atlantic Ocean?? Would you rather have her just give up??" 
This is based upon a misunderstanding of my position. 
Some people think that pessimists have to be glum, dour people who wear black and shuffle along with their shoulders hunched over, mut­tering things like, "Nothing makes any differ­ence. Why should I bother trying at all, since I 
I'm not saying anything like that. I don't think we should all just give up, shrivel up and die with a small whimper of self·pity. We all have the right --even the duty --to try as hard as possible for goals we care about. 
·What we don't have the right to expect, however, is success. Maybe it will come to us, maybe not. Our actions are under our control, but many of the things that determine our lives are totally uncontrollable. 
This recognition of reality has made me a lot less anxious. I know the universe is a pretty messed up place, and it's prone to pull all sorts of nasty little tricks on me. Becauseit's beyond my control, I don't worry about it. If something bad happens, that's what I expected anyway, so I'm not disappointed. And if something good happens, it's a pleasant surprise. 
That's the key to happiness: lowered expec­tations. 
If you've gotten all the way to this final par­agraph, thank you! I didn't think anyone would actually read this column all the way through.

Dissension growing over budget plan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON White House and congressional negotiators struggled Wednes­day to cement a two-year, $75 billion budget deficit-reduction agreement and saw their still­unfinished work coming under attack even from within their own ranks. 
"It's pretty weak. A pretty weak package unless you like taxes," said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who said many of his GOP col­leagues would have trouble voting for it. 
"It is so marginal as to be embarrassing," said Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, who is among the negotiators and is the ranking GOP member of the Senate Finance Commit­tee. 
"It sounds like something less than what most of us had hoped would be accomplished in a summit," said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
The package would reduce the deficit in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, by about $30 bil­lion and cut fiscal 1989 red ink by more than $45 billion. That would more than meet the min­imum goal of the Gramm­Rudman law, which requires $23 billion in fiscal 1988 deficit reduction. 
The law calls for President Reagan to order spending cuts on Friday, half from the mili­tary and half from domestic programs, if the goal is not met. 
The group worked Wednes­
day in an attempt to resolve is­
sues including how to guaran­
tee that the general agreement, 
especially the spending cuts, 
would be translated into law. 
"If it is not enforceable, just 
a hope and a prayer . . . this 
package will not pass," said 
Packwood. 
"We're proceeding to work 
out the details of what we hope 
will be an agreement," said 
House Majority Leader 
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., chair­
man of the negotiators. "I have 
no reason to be pessimistic," 
he said. 
Asked about those calling the 
package inadequate, Foley 
said: ''There are always people 
who want to do more." 
The reaching of a bipartisan agreement would help reas­sure financial markets even if it was limited in scope, Foley said. 
The negotiators rejected, during their nearly four weeks of deliberations, calls for bold action --such as cutting Social Security cost-of-living adjust­ments or raising tax rates. Al­though budget experts often point to those areas as fertile ground for closing the budget gap, action there was consid­ered politically unrealistic. 
A draft agreement obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday included un­specified tax increases of $9 bil­lion, plus $400 million in new fees for government services in fiscal 1988.

Executive praises liberal arts 
By DIANE HAMMEL News Staff 
There is still hope for Arts and Letters majors, said a chief executive officer for First National Bank in Chicago in Hays Healy Center Wednesday night. 
John Madden, a Notre Dame graduate and chief executive officer for First National Bank in Chicago, said that although most businesses still do not recruit liberal arts majors, the picture is not entirely bleak. In­volved in banking since 1962, Madden assured the crowded room of liberal arts students

that their nightmares from job anxiety will disappear. 
Liberal arts majors possess many important attributes for a career in business, according to Madden. Although there is no single foolproof formula for business success, it is always beneficial to be able to com­municate effectively, he said. 
Madden compared the liberal arts major to the com­puter wizard, who he said fre­quently cannot understand people as well as the liberal arts student. The person with the liberal arts degree can envision new possibilities, or­ganize and reorganize and ex­trapolate what is still worthwhile from old ideas, he said. A liberal arts back­ground does more than give a person technical knowledge. It also can have a great impact on you for the rest of your life, said Madden. It enables you to analyze and sensitize to pos­sibly find more value and meaning in your life, he said. 
There is more to be learned about business by reading Shakespeare or Macchiavelli than from successful busines­smen such as Donald Regan or Donald Trump, said Madden. 
Initial jobs may be difficult to find, but not impossible, Madden said. 
Wednesday, saying, "We're not interested in making moun­tains out of molehills." 
But Andy Palmer, the school's counseling director, is keeping a list of students who have been hospitalized. 
"We're in an affluent com­munity. There are higher ex­pectations here," Palmer said Wednesday. "I don't think the answer is to lessen the demands but to teach coping skills to help the kids deal with it."

She said she did not write the bill and has some problems with it herself. She submitted the bill primarily to save the Northeast Neighborhood the "hassle" of trying to submit it themselves, she said. 
"Parts of the plan are not good," Puzzello said, explain­ing that the area cited for re­zoning is too large. The area currently included in the plan 
is roughly bounded between Hill Street and Eddy and Corby and Madison, she said. 
"I felt that there were many problems from the beginning," Puzzello said, adding that the bill would have to undergo changes including reducing the size of the area to be re-zoned. Puzzello said the bill would not be submitted to the city council for a vote before March. 
The bill must be evaluated by 
the Area Planning Commission 
before it can be submitted to 
the city council for a vote, said 
Puzzello. 
The bill met with an unex­
pected amount of opposition at 
the planning commission's 
meeting on Tuesday night, but 
many residents favored the 
bill.

HPC should not be billed for food fight 
When I was ten years old, I was really into the Cub Scouts. One weekend I left home with my fellow cub scouts for the weekend. We had the time of our lives. In fact, winning the pinewood derby just may be the highlight of my sporting career. I was riding high that weekend and couldn't wait to get home to share my joy with my parents, brothers and sisters. Upon arriving home, I bounded triumphantly through the door and was immediately greeted by my dear mot­her. 
George Molinsky 
guest column 

"Go to your room, son, and don't come out until I say so. The other children had a food fight while you were away this weekend and since you also are one of my children, you will pay the same price as the others." 
"But Mom," I said, "why should I pay for what my brothers and sisters did while I was away for the weekend? Does that make any logical sense?" 
"I am your mother... I don't have to make sense. Now go to your room, or I'll throw you pinewood derby trophy into the Little Miami River." 
In all fairness to my mother, this sit­uation did not take place in my family in Dayton, but in my "family" here at Notre Dame. The administration has decided that the 7,200 students not in­volved in the food fight after the Mic­higan game will be responsible for the $1,400 damage caused by 800 idiots back on campus. It is my understanding that each student will be responsible for con­tributing approximately $.25 to this fund. In addition, Dr. Goldrick has se­lected our Hall President's Council to be his little tax collectors. 
The issue at hand is not the $.25, even though that quarter is more of a burden on my bank account than the $1,400 ever will be to this university's. The real issue is: does this university have the right to send me or you, as students here, the bill for a crime committed by someone else? Are we next going to foot the bill for the trampled grass on the quad, or maybe the goal post torn down by a couple hundred students? 
Our representatives in the Hall Pres­ident's Council used a similar argu­ment in as many as six meetings with University officials. Goldrick simply would not budge. Our leaders consid­ered making a stand, but when Goldrick threatened to raise tuition, their seemingly strong spines turned out to be brittle and crumbled to the floor upon Goldrick's first shove. Mr. Goldrick conned our leaders into think­ing they would be acting in our best interest in avoiding the tuition threat. 
I challenge the Hall President's Coun­cil to stand up for the rights of the majority of students at Notre Dame, who they claim to represent. Let Goldrick raise tuition, if he has the au­thority to do so. To be equitable he would have to raise tuition, accounting for the time value of money, about $.27 per student. This solution would relieve the senior class of their burden and place it upon the shoulders of the un­suspecting incoming freshmen. Or maybe he could raise tuition by a mere 

Doonesbury 
$5 and the University could make a net profit of about 38 grand on this thing. Does the Hall President's Council really think that this university is giving them an option to decide what our tuition will be next year. If they want to build in a fund to cover food fights, our paying a measly 1,400 bucks won't prevent that from happening. I think our hall presidents are flattering themselves if they think they command that kind of power. 
Come on, HPC! This is finally an issue where we hold some of the cards, and have sound moral and ethical reasoning to back our position. Not a penny has been collected. It is not too late to make a stand. A stand not for $.25 but for the underlying principle that says we as students will not be bullied, or sweet-talked, into paying for expenses incurred by others. 
And if the HPC decides to fail us on this issue, then let them ask to be placed on the university payroll. If they are not going to function as an independent body, representing the students, they should not submit themselves to slave labor at the hands of the University and at the expense of the student body. 
Food fighting is one of the worst crimes imaginable, especially if you look at the hunger around the globe. But food fights sometimes happen, as was the case on Sept. 12, here at Notre Dame, and, somehow they must be paid for. Had my wise mother made the deci­sion, she would have collected all the 
I.D.'s of the students present while they were all contained in the eating area, and punished the offenders appropri­ately. Obviously, the University blew its chance, and simply intends to spread the bill out over the innocent. I guess our university administration doesn't always live up to family stand­ards. 
Get some guts, HPC and do what is right.

.P.O. Box Q 

Top ten ways to pay for the food fight 
Dear Editor: 

Following the football team's initial victory at Michigan, there were food fights in both dining halls. Much food was wasted and many dishes were bro­ken. The dining hall workers cleaned up the mess, but the 'mess' was just beginning. The dining hall workers wanted to be paid for the extra effort they expended and the broken dinner­ware they replaced. For two months, the question raged: Who would foot the bill? 
By now, everyone realizes the admin­istration is going to force the entire stu­dent body to pay for damage only a select few students were responsible for. Right or wrong (I prefer wrong), we are going to get stuck with the $1,400 tab. How should we pay this bill? 
With all due respect to Student Gov­ernment and their ideas, I suggest they try some of these. 
From the home office in Foxboro, Massachusetts, here is tl"\e TOP TEN list of ways to pay off the $1,400 food 
Garry Trudeau 
fight debt at the University of Notre Dame: 
10. Collect all profits from Heisman Hanky sales. 
9. Steal the weekly "allowance" of any Miami (Fla.) scholarship football player. 
8. Charge Brent Musberger a nickel every time he says, "Here on CBS." 
7. Collect all profits from the new Notre Dame fight song record sales. 
6. Obtain and sell copies of the next Organic Chemistry Exam. 
5. Charge a toll for the use of the library elevators. 
4. Pawn the gold leaf on the Golden Dome. 
3. Collect 140,000 pennies and per­sonally hand them to Mr. Hickey. 
2. Charge a penny for three throws at Dr. Goldrick in a dunking booth. 
And, the number one method of paying off the food fight debt at the University of Notre Dame: 
1. Buy all of our beer in Michigan this weekend, and give Mr. Hickey 28,000 empty beer cans.

''Child'' 
TAMI JENELLE ETTEN accent writer 

Y 
ou know the day is going 
to be hell when there's no 

diet coke for breakfast. Right? 
A Thursday in March started that way for the Bradshaw fam­ily, the far-from-Cosby, full-of­chaos family of Julie Jensen's play "Thursday's Child" which opened last night at St. Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
The family, headed by middle-aged mother, George Ann Bradshaw, played bril­liantly by PLS senior Tracy Fet­ters. is in for a shock when they discover that she is preg­nant. 
Her husband, the passive­aggressive Ken Bradshaw, played by junior Communica­tions and Theatre major, Kevin Kennedy has nothing but con­fusion to add to her condition by stepping in dog mess and being too incompetent to do anything about it (or about his life for that matter). 
To add to the chaos, Marcy (Meghan Farley), their eight year old "experimenter", has put fish in the washing ma­chine, Kenny (Michael Murphy), their fifteen year old, has kicked in the car hood, and their sixteen year old, Kenna Lou (Amy McFadden) has been having sex with her boyfriend who is a greek. Or is he a geek? 
As the day unfolds, George Ann placidly waits for someth­ing to go right. All her over­bearing mother has to offer her, with her image projected largely on a curtain behind the set, is a recipe for Weight 
•


IS comedy smash 

Watchers barbequed chicken. (The secret of which is a can of diet coke--or tab, whichever you prefer.) 
Despite the laughs and • chaos, George Ann is faced with a major decision to make. She no longer has all the choices she did when she was young. She has to gracefully get out of what she cannot change. 
It is playwright and director Julie Jensen's grace which makes this comedy funny, very funny, but not overburdened with laughter that the audience doesn't see the seriousness of what lies ahead for George Ann. 
It offers insight to life, if only 
a release from tension by 
making up your own rules if the ones that are around aren't working. But then its back to reality. 
The play, which was "in the workings for three years" has been reworked and rewritten by the cast and playwright collec­tively. In its completed form, it is scheduled to be performed by the Capital Repertory Com­pany in Albany, New York, next spring. 
The Albany audiences are in for a real treat. A playwright from a small Midwestern col­lege is going to give them something to laugh about. Make sure you beat them to it. 
''Thursday's Child" runs through Sunday, November 22. For ticket information contact the O'Laughlin Box Office at 284-4626. 


Spyro captivates fans 
KIM YURATOVAC Assistant Accent Editor 

S 
pyro Gyra compensated for a half-full Morris Civic Auditorium audience last night by amplifying their unique creation of pop-jazz enough to vibrate within any empty space. 
Playing pieces from their older albums like "Alternating Currents" and their latest al­bum "Stories Without Words," the group proved to any doub­ter that even a a pop band with no vocals can captivate an au­dience for over two hours. 
The show spotlighted each band member as a soloist. Even drummer Richie Morales and Latin percussionist Manalo Badrena revealed particular melodies that could only be derived from skilled percus­sionists. 
Bad rena, who joined the band last year, fashioned a unique Latin rythym that added

a diverse twist to the rest of the jazz. He supplied his own form of vocals, by chanting into the microphone while pounding on his bongo drums, creating a truly Latin mood. 
Guitarist Julio Fernandez per­formed his own "Del Corazon" which began as a mellow Spanish ballad, on a Spanish guitar and progessed into a jazzy orchestration with a Spanish flavor. 
Don Schuman shared his keyboard expertise with a se­ries of intense solos, including an untitled creation just com­pleted. The band left the stage to Schuman. He aroused both intense silence and wild cheers with his rich performance which sounded more like a col­laboration of talented musicians than a solo effort. 
Dave Samuels brought the xylophone from being a a ter­tiary instrument to dazzling center stage. He manuevered two sticks in each hano, creat­ing jazz-style harmonies in solos like "Mardi Gras" from the "Alternating Currents" al­bum. 
But it was Jay Beckenstein, leader of the band, who unified the show. His performance of "Bittersweet" added the mellow touch that was well appreciated after several intense, fast-paced tunes. 
The solos complemented each other well partly because of the smooth transitions that linked them. One piece ended and another began before the audience had a chance to do anything but applaud. 
A performance by Spyro Gyra, in any other city, would have generated a capacity crowd. But to the small dedi­cated group in attendance the intensity of one of America's fastest rising jazz bands filled every inch of empty space with rich inspiration.

Co-educational halls,? 
Compiled by Cara Anthony and Christine Walters Photos by Zoltan Ury 
"Co-ed dorms would promote bet­ter understanding between men and women. I think that's what this university needs a little more of. I think the University will ap­proach the issue in a rational, step-by-step way." 
Trace Murphy Freshman 



"Co-ed dorms are a good idea, but things would be different. I don't see Notre Dame moving in that direction, it's a radical idea for the University." 
Ellen Mauch Junior 
-~illi4 

"I think the idea of co-ed dorms is great. and I wouldn't mind if my own hall went co-ed. You're going to have to learn to live with people of the opposite sex some­time, so why not during college? Notre Dame should have had co­ed halls a long time ago." 
Dave Rosenberg Freshman 



''I'm not sure that co-ed halls would work at a university like this, just because it's always been this way. I wouldn't mind the change, but so many people have gone through this University with separate dorms that it just wouldn't be accepted." 
Matt Langie Sophomore 

"Everybody wants them, but no one wants their own dorm changed. If people have to live with someone of the opposite sex on the next floor, they have to worry about locking the door and wearing their bathrobe to the showers. I don't think the Univer­sity will ever change to co-ed dorms." 
Jim DeMarco Freshman 



"Living in an all-women's dorm is one of the things I like about Notre Dame. There's more privacy and It encourages respect be­tween men and women. Also, if we kept parletals, they would be much harder to enforce." 
Suzi Criqui Freshman 

"I went abroad last year, and lived in a co-ed dorm. There was no problem with privacy, and it worked really well. I don't see why we shouldn't have them here. People would be more relaxed, but not in a promiscuous way. Notre Dame will probablyhave co­ed dorms eventually." 
Maria &heidler Junior 


"I like the dorms the way they are now, that's one ofthe reasons why I came here. I've stayed In co-ed dorms on other campuses and it's a total disaster. Usually the dorms are a mess and people don't respect each other. I don't see Monk Malloy doing anything drastic in his first year as Presi­dent."

Dawson captures National's MVP 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs became the first member of a last-place team to be named Most Valu­able Player when he won the National League award on Wednesday. 
Dawson, a free agent whom no club bid for last winter, led the majors with 137 runs batted in and tied for the homer lead with 49. 
He beat St. Louis shortstop Ozzie Smith by a 269-193 mar­gin in voting by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Jack Clark, Smith's team­mate on the National League East champion St. Louis team that finished 18 l!2 games ahead of Chicago, was third with 186. Montreal's Tim Wallach was fourth and San Francisco's Will Clark was fifth. Cy Young win­ner Steve Bedrosian of Philadelphia finished 16th. 
Dawson and the two Clarks were the only players named on all 24 ballots. Smith was named on 22. Two association members in each of the 12 NL cities were eligible to vote. 
Dawson came to the Cubs this spring, handing a blank contract to then-general manager Dallas Green. The

Cubs, burned by multimillion­dollar free agents contracts in the past, filled in the amount of $500,000, making Dawson the second-lowest paid regular on the team. 
But Dawson, 33, prospered with his best year while the Cubs struggled along at 76-85. Dawson batted .287 and played a strong right field while also surpassing his previous top power numbers of 32 home runs and 113 RBI, both in 1983 with Montreal. 
He earned an additional $150,000 for staying off the dis­abled list and an extra $50,000 for making the All-Star team for the fourth time. He did not have an incentive clause in his contract for winning the MVP. 
Dawson, vowing last winter he would not return to the Ex­pos for a 12th season, rejected salary arbitration and tested the free-agent market. The Ex­pos offered a two-year contract worth $2 million, and no other team topped that figure. 
From the start, Dawson wanted to play at Wrigley Field, where he had hit .346 in his career. At that point, he had averaged one home run for every 16.8 at-bats during the day compared to one per each

Preseason All-Americas 


Rivers makes AP's first team 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Notre Dame point guard David Rivers has battled back from a near-fatal automobile accident in June of 1986 to earn a selection on the 1987-88 Associated Press preseason All-American team. 
He was voted to the squad along with Kansas forward Danny Manning, Syracuse cen­ter Rony Seikaly, North Carolina forward J .R. Reid and Michigan guard Gary Grant by a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. 
Grant says he would trade his selection to the 1987-88 Associ­ated Press preseason All­America team for a Big Ten title and a good showing in the NCAA Tournament. 
"It's an honor to get selected to a preseason All-America team, but right now, I'm just looking forward to the season and I would just like to make sure that the team does well," Grant said Wednesday after the team was announced. 
"I feel that if the team wins a Big Ten championship and does well in postseason play, the individual awards will fol­low," he added. 
Manning was the top vote­getter in the balloting, receiv­ing 60 of a possible 64 votes. Seikaly had 40, Reid got 36, while Rivers and Grant had 33 and 32, respectively. All are seniors but Reid, who is a soph­omore. 
Grant, one of the nation's best two-way players, averaged 22.4 points, 5.4 assists and 2.7 steals a game. He led Michigan, ranked ninth in the AP's preseason poll, into the second round of the NCAA Tournament last spring. 
Manning was the only repeater from last year's ini­tial AP preseason team, which included seniors David Robin­son of Navy, Kenny Smith of North Carolina, and Steve Al­ford of Indiana, each of whom, like Manning, was chosen for the All-American team after the season. 
Louisville's Pervis Ellison was the other player selected to last year's preseason team. Reggie Williams of Geor-

Manning, the Big Eight player of the year, averaged 
23.9 points and 9.5 rebounds per game for the Jayhawks last season while making 62 percent of his field goal attempts. 
Reid, one of the most heralded freshman ever to en­ter Coach Dean Smith's pro­gram, was the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year last season, averaging 14.7 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. 
Seikaly was the center last season as the Orangemen, No.1 in the pre-season, came within a point of the national champi­onship, losing 74-73 to Indiana. The 6-10 native of Greece averaged 15.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.1 blocks last season while shooting 57 per­cent from the field.

Some schools lobby through the media for certain bids, as Jimmy Johnson and Miami did this year in requesting an un­conditional bid to the Orange Bowl. But Notre Dame has maintained a low profile when it comes to that kind of thing. 
"We don't make deals ahead of time," Valdiserri continued. "That's not our style." 
A couple of hours after Sat­urday's game, all the specula­tion will end. And Notre Dame's chances for a bid to the Orange Bowl probably will end as well.

Baker makes last year count 
By BRIAN O'GARA Assistant Sports Editor 
California and volleyball. A marriage made in the sands of Laguna Beach, Mission Beach, and many other hotspots along the Pacific coast. 
Southern California has long been known as a volleyball mecca. Four years ago, senior Kathy Baker left that warm scenario to come to Notre Dame. While her high school friends and teammates were choosing such volleyball powers as Southern Cal, San Diego State and Long Beach State, Baker headed east to play for a team in only its fifth year with a varsity volleyball program. The Irish had only one season above .500 up to that point. 
''All my friends were staying in California," says Baker, "but I wanted to be different. I wanted to get out on my own. I loved volleyball, but I wanted to get a good education too." 
Four years later, Baker and her Notre Dame teammates are 29-9 against a schedule which included six teams ranked in the Top 20.The Irish are big favorites to capture their second consecutive North Star Conference championship this weekend in Chicago. The program has had three winning Dame head coach Art Lam­bert. 

This weekend's NSC champi­onship will be the last time Baker and fellow seniors Jill Suglich, Kathleen Morin and Gretchen Kraus suit up for the Irish. For all four, it marks the end of a four-year career that has seen a mediocre progam turn into a challenger for the NCAA Tournament. 
"This is it," says Baker. "Since my freshman year in high school I've been compet­ing in volleyball. Life will be different without it. We have a good record but we wanted to go to the NCAA's. A lot of the team's we lost to were in five games. If we had won some of those games, it could have been a different story." 
In last year's 33-7 season, Baker saw action in only 34 of Notre Dame's 136 games, second lowest on the team. This fall, as the Irish have compiled a comparable 29-9 record against a much more difficult schedule, Baker has been a consistent starter and played in 89 of the team's 130 games, third highest on the squad. 
Why the big change in playing time? It's not that ex­perience is so important, con­sidering the Irish returned all of last year's starters and two seniors have seen more bench time this year than last. The 
seasons in the past four years, • difference is within the mind of and has been a win or two away Kathy Baker. from an NCAA Tournament bid "Last spring and summer I for two years running. worked out a lot," said the 
"Kathy Baker has been in-senior, "and something clicked strum ental in getting this pro-about being a senior. I took on gram where it is," said Notre a completely different attitude 
--that this was the last time 
through, my last year of Notre 
Dame volleyball. The game of 
volleyball was always impor­
tant to me, but I decided to 
make it one of the most impor­
tant things in my life." 
That new attitude has been apparent to anyone at an Irish volleyball game. No. 2 is no longer cheering from the bench, but drawing cheers from the crowd for her hustle on the court. 
"Kathy Baker's attitude and efforts and drive, in my opinion, are what athletics are all about. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to coach her." 
In last year's North Star Con­ference tournament, Baker earned second-team all­tournament honors with a strong performance. She and the Irish hope to repeat last year's success beginning Sat­urday when they meet Val­paraiso and Marquette at 11 
a.m. and 3 p.m. respectively. The tournament semi-finals will be held Sunday at noon, with the finals slated for 2 p.m. that afternoon. All games will be at DePaul's Alumni Hall. 
"We've beaten those teams once this year,'' said Lambert of his team's status as favorite, "but. that really doesn't mean anything. 


"This will be a chance for us f@}.!l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
to generate some momentum and chemistry to carry over into the spring," continued the head coach. "I really liked some of the things I saw against Western Michigan, despite the loss. It looked like we might be awakening." 

Edwards to stay on as Indians' chief 
... 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Doc Ed­wards, who was promoted from bullpen coach to manager mid­way through the Cleveland In­dians' disastrous 1987 season, was rehired Wednesday to manage the team in 1988. 
Edwards directed the Cleveland to a 30-45 mark after taking over on July 16 when Pat Corrales was fired. The Indians were 31-56 under Corrales. 
Their final 61-101 record was the worst in the majors, and Edwards said he and new team President Hank Peters were prepared to do some dealing to strengthen a pitching staff that had a 5.28 earned run average, also worst in the big leagues. 
"When you finish last, you have to be open to anything," the 50-year-old Edwards said. "You have to listen to any of­fers. I don't think you can say anyone's untouchable at this point." 

..... 
Edwards also said he wanted to improve Cleveland's defense, which committed an American League-high 153 er­rors, by letting a number of players settle into one position. Joe Carter alternated between outfield and first base, and

-
Cory Snyder spent time at shortstop and in the outfield last year. 
"We're going to settle Joe Carter into one position," Ed­wards said, adding that Carter's best position is the out­field. "Cory Snyder, who's trying to harness a cannon of an arm, is going to be our right fielder." 

He  said  he  wants  to  keep  
Brook  Jacoby  at  third  base,  
countering  speculation  that  

Jacoby might be moved to first to make room for Eddie Wil­liams, a promising third base prospect. 
Peters, the former Baltimore Orioles executive hired by the Indians earlier this month, said Edwards signed a one-year contract. Peters indicated that no one else was seriously con­sidered for the job. 
Edwards projects a laid­back attitude that he says he prefers when dealing with players. 
"I would rather just sit in the corner of the dugout like Casey Stengel used to do --write down the names of the first nine guys who show up at the ballpark and let 'em win," Edwards said. "If someone comes to the ballpark and plays hard if you let him alone, I'-ll do that. But if I have to hang on somebody's belt, I'll do that." 
Edwards was in his second full season as the Indians' bul­lpen coach when he was named manager.

Irish go international in pre-season games 
Women top Wales, 70-41 
Special to the Observer 
Mter a slow first half the Notre Dame women's basket­ball used a second-half surge to dump the Wales National Team, 70-41, Wednesday night in LaGrange, Ind. 
Playing at the Prairie Heights High School gym to im­prove community support for the team, the Irish got off to a slow start offensively, and led 27-20 at halftime. 
But after leading only by seven at the half, Notre Dame doubled up on Wales, outscor­ing the opponents 43-21 in the second half to win handily 
Sandy Botham and Heidi Bunek led the offensive surge for Notre Dame in the second half. 
Botham scored 15 points with six rebounds. Bunek, who scored 14 points, led the Irish with nine rebounds. Notre Dame also got results from its backcourt. Fresh­man guard Karen Robinson, who scored 10 points in last weekend's Blue-Gold game scored in double figures again. The Turnersville, N.J., native had 12 points for the Irish. Senior guard Mary Gavin, Notre Dame's career leader in assists, led the team in that cat­egory with 10 on Wednesday. 


Mary Gavin (above) helped lead the Notre Dame women's basketball team to a 70-41 win over the Wales National Team on Wednesday, and AP All-

Men take on Zadar today 
Special to The Observer 

The Notre Dame men's bas­
ketball team will play its final 
exhibition of the season 
Thursday night at 7: 30 against 
the Zadar Club of Yugoslavia. 
Tickets to the game are a part 
of the student season ticket 
package. 

As of late Wednesday after­noon, lower arena seating was available. Tickets sales end Thursday evening with sales to the freshman class and those upperclassmen who have yet to purchase their tickets. The price of the package is $80 for lower arena seats and $64 for bleachers. 
When Zadar pulls into town, it will be making the seventh stop of its nine-game tour. The tour began Nov. 10 at Val­paraiso and ends this Saturday night at DePaul. The Irish coaching staff arranged Zadar's tour, maintaining its ties to Yugoslavian· basketball. The Irish toured Yugoslavia this past summer. 
This will be the last tune-up for the Irish before they travel to Bloomington, Ind., to open the season against the sixth­ranked and defending national champion Hoosiers. Notre Dame opens its horne season against Boston University Dec. 8.

Bowl politics make it the destination Dallas 
The Orange Bowl team-selection committee tried its best to make one, but the only deals to expect in the next few days are deals with airline compan­ies for holiday flights. 
One flight in particular: South Bend to Dallas for New Year's Day. 
It is beginning to look like the Irish are virtually locked into a spot in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1, although members of the Notre Dame Athletic De­partment and the Irish football team are still cling­ing to the slim chance the Irish have for a spot in the Orange Bowl. 
The Orange Bowl committee presented the Cotton Bowl committee with a proposal last week that would have set up a game for the national cham­pionship in the Orange Bowl, committee chairman Pete Williams said Wednesday when contacted at his Miami office. 
The Orange Bowl proposed that the winner of the Nov. 28 Miami-Notre Dame game would play the winner of this Saturday's Oklahoma-Nebraska game for the title. The Cotton Bowl would then take the loser of the Miami-Notre Dame game to face the Southwest Conference champion, Williams said. 
But that deal was never made, and is not being pursued. "We (the Orange Bowl committee) made the pro­posal, and I think that speaks for how highly we 
regarded that possibility," Williams said. "We thought it was a good proposal, but it wasn't ac­cepted." 
The Cotton Bowl, which has been struggling in the network television ratings on Jan. 1 in recent years, obviously is drawn to Notre Dame because

of its national image and the year the seventh­ranked, 8-1 Irish have had. Cotton Bowl represen­tatives in the Notre Dame pressbox during home football games confirmed their interest and seem confident in the prospect of signing Notre Dame when the bids come out Saturday at 6 p.m. The Irish probably would play the winner of the Thanks­giving Day game between Texas and Texas A&M. 
"The Orange Bowl has their business, and we have ours," Cotton Bowl representative Jim Brock said. "We want to do what's in the best interest of the Cotton Bowl. This is a business deal. We have no animosity toward the Orange Bowl, the Univer­sity of Miami and we certainly have no animosity toward Notre Dame." 
The Orange Bowl will not wait for the Notre Dame-Miami result before extending its bid. The selection committee already has announced that it will make its choice Saturday along with the Cotton Bowl. 
The Orange Bowl committee is not at liberty to discuss the particulars of its upcoming choice, Wil­liams said, but had listed its top four last week as Miami (8-0), Syracuse (10-0), Florida State (9-1) and Notre Dame. Syracuse and Florida State will accept bids to the Sugar and Fiesta Bowls, respec­tively. 
That leaves Miami and Notre Dame, and the deci­sion will be made before the two teams square off against one another. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, Miami is the logical choice. The Hurricanes are undefeated while the Irish suffered a 30-22 loss to Pittsburgh. Miami is third in the Associated Press poll while Notre Dame stands seventh. And the Hurricanes will be favored when the Irish travel south a week from Saturday. 
Miami plays 12th-ranked South Carolina after the contest against Notre Dame, and the chance of a loss to both the Irish and the Gamecocks has to
