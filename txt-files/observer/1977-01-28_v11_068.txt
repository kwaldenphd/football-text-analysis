Church opposes women priests 
VATICAN CITY (AP) -The Roman Catholic Church said yes­terday it will not ordain women as priests because Christ ·'was and remains a man"' and his apostles. all men. chose other men as theil successors. 
A declaration issued on orders of Pope Paul VI by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith went directly against the recommendation of another Vatican body and the growing practice among Protestant Christ­ian denominations of ordaining women. 
"The Church. in fidclitv to the example of the Lord. d-oes not con~idcr herself authorized to admit 11·omcn to priestlv ordina­tion ... the document said. Quoting St. Thomas Aquinas. the declara­tion said there must be a "natural resemblance" between Christ and hio., minister'>. Otherwise. it o,aid. "it would be difficult to sec in the minister the image of Christ.·· 
The document was prepared b~· a rnmmission of doctrinal experts appointed on instructions of the Pope in mid-1975. The Vatican also consulted cardinals and bishops around the world and "different women of different continents and countries. of different social condi­tion. lay and religious."' a spokes­man said. 
But the Pontifical Biblical Com­mission. the Vatican· s permanent body of Bible experts. also took up the matter. Its secretary. Bishop Albert Descamps. reported Thurs­dav that the commission voted 12 to 5 fn favor of women priests, with one member abstaining and two absent. 
Bishop Descamps -disclosed the conflict between the Biblical Corn­mission and the Pope during questioning at a news conference called to introduce the new declara­tion. 
The Vatican said the declaration was issued to dispel doubts at a time when other Christian churches. including the Episcopal and Methodist churches in the United States. were opening the door for women to become mini­sters. pastors and priests. 
It referred to recent correspon­dence between Pope Paul and .Dr. Donald Coggan. the archbishop of Canterbury and primate of the Anglican Church. in which the Pope said the acceptance of women 
priests  would  block  progress  
tm1·ard  unitv  among  Christian  
churches.  ·  

Heplying to some theories that Christ's failure to appoint women apostles was more the result of the social intluences of his time than his own or God's feelings. the document said: 
"Jesus Christ did not call any women to become part of the twelve. If he acted in this way, it was not in order to conform to the customs of his time, for his attitude towards women was quite different from that of his milieu. and he deliberately and courageously broke with it."'

Student leaders to hear proposals 
bJ Joe Slovinec 

The Notre Dame Student Con­gress will consider a variety of topics when it meets at 7 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 31. in the Little Theatre of LaFortune Center. Invitations were sent to all mem­bers of the student government, the Student Union. the Hall Presi­dents' Council (HPC). and all class officers. 
The first item on the agenda is a report by the Student Life Council (SLC). Student Body President Mike Gassman said that the SLC may change its discussions to a forum rather than the past format of considering proposals drawn up by committees. Gassman feels it is better if the SLC discusses ideas and then sends them to committee for further action. which would be a reversal of the present policy of only discussing certain proposals given by committees. Gassman said the forum proposal. which will be presented by Student Body Vice-President Mike Casey, will eliminate much of the bureaucracy presently caused by committees. 
Proposals for the renovation of LaFortune Student Center will also be discussed. Gassman said that the HPC will distribute a survey to students asking them what activ­ities they would like to see in LaFortune. Gassman would like to make the student center a more 
open meeting-place" and '·activities center.'' Architecture students will present a portfolio on their ideas for renovating the area around LaFortune Center and Washington Hall. 
Another question on the agenda 
is the proposal for hall parties with 
alcohol. Gassman said that the 
Student Congress will review 
several proposals for precautions 
against any problems that may 
arise out of the parties. Proposed 
precautions include requiring proof of the legal Indiana drinking age of 
21. measures to prevent drunken driving after the parties, and an adequate staff at the party to control anyone who becomes in­toxicated. 
Gassman said the University is concerned about their legal responsibility for the parties which is an area of great question. The University's anxiety partially stems from a 1974 court case in which a 17-year-old became intoxicated at his sister's house and then had an auto accident. Both the 17-year-old and his sister were sued and held legally responsible. 
Gassman cited a university policy stated by University Counsel Philip Faccenda that the University is not responsible for actions of students who are using alcohol and that the University may only be liable if they are aware of the party. Gassman said that if the hall rector consents to a party. that could be construed as meaning that they are aware of the party and may be held responsible. 
This proposal will generate a great deal of discussion. Gassman hopes that if a few hall parties are allowed. it could provide the start of a system to shift to more hall parties if the drinking age is lowered to 18. 
The agenda also includes a discussion on the desirability of departmental examinations at 8 
a.m. A committee of students and faculty are in the process of discussing this policy with Univer­sitv Provost Fr. James T. Burt­chaell. Gassman disclosed that the student government is planning its first official survey of students' opinions on 8 a.m. departmental exams. This survey will pave the way for a later statement of the student government's position on the deparhnentals. 
Jerry Klingenberger. head of the Notre Dame student lobby for lowering the Indiana drinking age to 18. will inform the Student Congress of the prospects for the lobby's success. Gassman said the drinking age bill is currently in an Indiana Senate committee and he estimates committee action will be taken within two weeks. Then the full Indiana Senate will act on the bill. 
Gassman stated the Student Congress will discuss Student Government proposals from the first semester that still require action. University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh approved the installation of a campus laundro­
mat for men. but Gassman said that the tentative location of the 
laundromat  in  Badin  Hall  still  
needs  to  be  cleared  out  and  
prepared  for  the  new  facility.  

Ga~;sman hopes "to facilitate fast implementation of the plan."' 
The cable TV proposal recently rejected by Fr. Hesburgh will be discussed. Gassman disagrees with the administration view that cable TV is too costly and would be used mainly as an entertainment medium by students. He remarked that a proposal should be judged on its merits, and financial concerns should be only secondary. 
Gassman also believes that Notre Dame students' great concern for academics would not be diminished by cable TV and that the educa­tional benefits would far outweigh! the costs. The administration has implied it might consider cable TV in the future. but Gassman said it is important to start the system now since it will take several years to mature. 
Discussions on the effectiveness, of the hall judicial boards will also take place. Bob Bode is co­ordinating efforts to standardize

ND anticipates no fuell shortage 
by Kate Flynn Staff Reporter 

While schools and industries across the country have had their fuel supply curtailed because of the unusually high winter demand, Notre Dame faces no immediate or expected fuel shortage. according to Maintenance Director Edward Lyons. 
'"We have adequate fuel supplies for the winter,'' said Lyons, "but the operating budget has been strained because of the stress on ground crews, equipment repairs and overtime wages, and it will be strained sometime before we're through." 
The nationwide natural gas crisis that has touched parts of Indiana considered by the officers of the will not affect Notre Dame's fuel University and not by the Power consumption, explained Lyons, Plant or maintenance departments. since gas supply to Notre Dame ''A decree to limit heat to the

Prison group to present Godot 
~an Vucntin Drama Workshop, the first prison theatre group. will be premiering its production of Nobel Prize winner Samuel bcckctt's modern classic. "Waiting For Godot." Sunday night at 8 p.m. in o·Laughlin Auditorium. 
Prior to the production. Ruby Cohn, noted Beckett scholar and editor. will conduct a workshop tomorrow at 4 p.m. in the Little Theatre at SMC. Her workshop­discussion will detinc "Waiting For Godot" and Beckett's concepts in relation to the San Quentin Drama Workshop's production of "Godot." 
Cohn is professor of Comparative Drama at the University of Cal­ifornia at Davis. She also-holds the capacity of the U.S. editor of Contemporary Dramatists maga­zine. 
The San Quentin Drama Work­shop was founded by convicts of the prison. Many inmates such as Ken Whalen. Mal Braley, Rick Cluchcv. R.S. Bailey and others were i.nspircd to f~rm a drama group by a production. "Waiting For Godot." performed in "Q" by the San Francisco Actors' Work­shop in 1957. 
Between 1958-1966. the Work­shop began experimenting with Beckett's works. Seven produc­tions of hi'> pla~·s were produced inside Quentin during this period. Since 19htl. the group has toured in other countries. including Scot­land. England. France and Gcr­
nHm~·. 
The San Quentin Drama Work­shop is a performing arts organiza­tion devoted to social and edu­cational theatre. In the past decade the Workshop has performed in over 500 colleges and universities throughout forty-eight states, Canada and nine European countries. Workshop productions have been honored at three inter­national festivals. before heads of state. before the U.S. Congress and in many penal institutions here and abroad. The Workshop has also performed on Broadway, off­Broadway and in many regional 
repertory theatres across the country. 
The. production, "Waiting For Godot." presented by the Work­shop is commemorating its rela­tionship with Samuel Beckett and its second decade of activity. Tickets for the play arc on sale at two dollars for students and three dollars for the general audience.

Cable TV 
The University Officers' rejection of SBP 
Mike Gassman's cable' TV proposal is 
extremely disappointing. The Officers 
have blocked a worthwhile project for what 
generally seem weak reasons. 
The merits of a University cable TV system are considerable. It would allow many educational programs. A student­run, student-oriented TV and improved radio stations would be possible-which would be both educational and entertain­ing. (It would also reduce The Observer's near-monopoly on news coverage, some­thing which would please many adminis­trators.) Improved reception of off-campus stations would provide increased enter­tainment. A closed circuit security system could be created without much added cost. 
The University Officers (the president, provost, executive vice president, vice presidents and associate provost) raise several objections. They fear that educa­tional programs might weaken the Univer­sity's stress on face-to-face education. But the proposal clearly calls for such pro­grams to supplement, not to replace, person-to-person contact. They fear the added entertainment might be too distract­ing. But there is too little entertainment around Notre Dame for a bit more to cause plummeting GPA's. 
Their primary objection is of course the cost--approximately $500,000. The Officers claim that the University simply does not have that much money to spend on the

project and that the expense would place 
too great a burden on the parents who 
would pay for it. The project must wait 
until costs go down and the University has 
enough money. 
The Officers may be entirely right in their assessment that the University lacks the money. But even if they are not it is difficult to argue against them since the administration is so secretive about the details of Notre Dame's financial position. 
Some counter-arguments are obvious, however. The cost of installation will not diminish--like all expenses it will rise in future years. The expense per student ($5 or $10 per year, plus a monthly charge of about $1 per outlet) is less than one percent of the expense parents and students are already paying for a Notre Dame education. It is small even compared to the usual annual rise in educational expenses. 
The cable TV proposal should be given the priority it deserves as a contribution to the education and life at Notre Dame and should not be treated as a mere luxury. 
The plan should not be allowed to die from the Officers' rejection. It is an excellent example of the imagination and research Notre Dame students need from their student government. Student Gov­ernment should improve the case for the plan and the next SBP should present it again, at the Board of Trustees meeting in May.

Windy rhetoric 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii~~~~~~iiiiiiiiii;oe gill 
Th'e Student Life Council's deci­sion to alter its format and become a forum for student discussion is similar to the blind man in Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein who decided to carry a lamp to light his way through the forest. The pro­blem of blindness is still there. 
For over a semester, the SLC has stumbled ineptly from discussion to discussion without resolution. At each and every meeting, the ques­tion of purpose has arisen, and each and every meeting, the ques­tion has gone unanswered. A change in format does nothing more than dodge the real issue of the Council's existence. 
But actually, there's another problem here, something even more important than functional debates, something that holds the SLC eyelids closed so tightly that format changes are mistakenly held up as lamps to light the way. Oddly enough, that "something" is not even open for discussion, because the problem is the discussion itself. 
It is windy rhetoric. 

Sure, there are people speaking back and forth to each other. There are slowly and carefully-formed phrases moving, dragging, back and forth. But there is no one talking with each other. No one seems to be saying exactly what he or she feels. 
For example, early last semester Fr. Burtchaell established a com­mittee for the study of coeducation, chaired by Assistant Provost Sr. John Miriam Jones and composed of notable University personnel. However, the SLC has had exactly the same type of committee for over two years, having conducted extensive studies into this area. The formation of the new commit­tee was an indirect insult to the work of the SLC. 
And yet, when . this fact was brought to light at the SLC's beginning meeting, it was rather ashamedly and hesitantly pushed under the table. Instead of discus­sing the conflicts the new commit­tee presented, or more important­ly, instead of being honest enough 
with each other to be enraged at 
this affront, the members quickly 
adhered to Bro Just Paczesny's 
suggestion that "of course the 
committee will have to work with 
us.'' 
All well and good. But the point is that the SLC members seemingly failed to voice their real opinions on this matter. 
SLC Chairperson Mike Casey recognized this problem when, in a letter to each of the members, he proposed a change in format. saying "if we did this, we could enhance the 'flow of communica­tion' which seems to be the basis for much of our problems." But if the members are not going to say what they feel, a mere change in the meeting's structure will be useless. Something else is needed. 
Some of the members feel intim­idated by the presence of the Observer reporter, fearing the proverbial horror of "bad press." This is nonsense. Open public meetings and heated discussion have been, and are becoming more and more, apart of society's struc­ture. 

Ifthe members disagree with the way the Administration handled itself with regard to WSND, or the cutback in funds for the Scholastic, or the procedures taken in disci­plinary action, then they should voice their disagreement. If they are afraid to say what they feel because of the presence of a Bro Just or a Dean Roemer, or because it might look as if the students or faculty were in conflict with the Administration, they have no busi­ness being a member of the SLC. 
The concept of a body composed of students, faculty and adminis­tration is a good one, for it incorporates the backgrounds, ages, and experiences of three essential shperes of University life. It is and excellent foundation for discussion, but it only works when the members decide to talk. Other­wise, the SLC will continue: to experience the same sort of fate the blind man in YoungFrankenstein did: it will again run intoa tree.

Who Mourn 
Be Comforted 
For a while, it looked as though this winter were a season of grieving for the death of fathers. Since the beginning of December, Bob and Dan Pedtke's father died: Nancy Cox's father died; Mike and Dan Duffy's father died; Rich Geschke's father died; Pat Keating's father died; Nick Reisinger's grandfather died. Then, last Sunday, Terry Gwynn died. and we were reminded of that other list of names (at least a dozen that I can remember) telling us of parents who mourn the death of children. Parents die; students die; we knew that they were fragile. mortal, perishable, subject to the summons of death. We did not know that they would di.e on this day, in this month, at this season. 
More often than not, death takes us by surprise, stunning us and numbing us by its interruption. Death is careless about whom it grieves; it is indifferent, irrever­ent, presumptuous, cruel. It is an enemy to be feared and guarded against. God, if He is for real, ought to do something about death. 
To heal the numbness, we create theologies with images that are closer to poetry than they are to truth; theologies that tell us in the Sweet Bye-and-Bye, we will stand on that beautiful shore. We will gather with the saints at the river,. the beautiful, beautiful river, that flows by the throne of God. For all eternity, with cherubim and seraphim, we'll be casting down -our golden crowns -around the glassy sea. 
We'll exchange our cross for .a starry crown. up where the sun shines ever. ·At His feet we'lllay every burden down, and with Jesus reign forever. 
It is so Never-Never Land. It is so mythically Paradise Regained, so Camelot come back. so Land of Ozish with the wicked witches dead. It is such a Disney­land of the spirit, such aConev Island of the mind. It is so fairy land ·and Arabian nights, so excessively fantastic, so outside the realm of human experience that there seems to be no real truth the heart and mind can cling to, because heaven appears so largely to be a creation of language belonging solely to the department of the imagination.

This Weekend

The Hardy Boys (Sun., 7:00 pm, 28): Dark and handsome Frank Hardy and his younger, equally handsome, but blonde brother Joe, along with the olive-skinned Tony Pronto and their stout, good­natured chum Chet Morton, whose sister lola is sweet on Frank but Frank won't admit it even though he's sweet on her too, solve crimes. Evel Knlevel's Death Defiers us, of course), where we can neither smell it nor see it, nor love it nor pick it. We think to ourselves: it is only the Selfish Giant who puts up walls to keep us from enjoying his garden. Yet I would not lose one line of a Hallmark card, nor one verse from a camp meeting hymn dealing with the mystery of life eternal. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to know what things God has prepared for those who love Him,'' says St. Paul. Yet even he cannot resist writing of the flourish of trumpets when the dead in Christ shall rise to glory, having put off their corruptible bodies to become im­mortal with the grace of the Risen Lord. Who can blame Hallmark, or evangelical preachers, for trying to comment on an experience for which creatures have no language? 
If you live long enough, you learn never to trust appearances. and that life and death are the alternating moods of beings existing on the earth. An infant that is healthy in the morning, may sicken at noonday, and be borne off for requiems in the evening. But who can say that an old man. full of decay, does not fall into a sleep from which he rises to an everlasting morning? Roots do it, seeds do it, bulbs do it, in an annual cycle. Bomb a city, and the day after the ruin. there can be flowers pushing their petals through the ash heaps. Try to defeat the persistence of crab grass. You can root it up, mow it down, smear it with black top, cover it with concrete. A week later, it is back, splitting the sidewalk with its irresistible energies. 
I am not crab grass nor a blitz flower; but I am part of the life stream that flows through the cosmos. When I am laid to rest in a graveyard, the dust that is me has other errands it will be sent on in the next million years. I have leased it from Nature for a little while; but tomorrow it may be needed for the growth of an oak tree, or the capering of a cocker spaniel. But my mind, my soul, my spirit--the part of me that knows and loves; the part of me that needs beauty and is sometimes selfish; that suffers from loneliness, and comforts others. The special part of me that makes me a specific son and brother, begotten from a paternity that stretches clear back to Adam; the part of me that could give uniqueness to sons and daughters begotten from now till the doom of the world. That Self, that Ego, that I --it does not sleep in graveyards, and I cannot believe that nature will lose it to nothingness. I cannot believe that Nature will throw it away, while she clutches like a miser to the merest specks of dust. 
I cannot dream of the adventures that wait me when the requiescats are spoken over the empty shell which was always clumsier and more indolent than the dancer in me could have wished for. Perhaps I will be a tenor soloist in the

Kingdom's choir 1hat sings Handel's Hallelujah at the throne of God. Perhaps I will literally be a g11est at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, where the wine will be a Eucharist drunk from the vintages of Cana. Perhaps. when the roll is called up yonder, I will labor for the Master from the dawn to setting sun, as the old hymn promises, forgetting that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to know. 
One thing I am sure of: on thejourney from the sick bed into the experience that seems like night, I wlll not be following an untravelled road. Lc·ving friends and my grandparents, and a father and a brother, have made the trip bdore me. That means there has to be a homecoming full of tears and laughter. Even if there were no promises of faith, there has to be a homecoming. Thoug:h souls should be as distant as stars twinkling in different galaxies, love would ~ftnd a way to leap the firmaments. 
But there are the promises of faith, consistent with the immortal longings that create theologies. Dying will be like a walk on the road to Emmaus in the company of a seasoned traveller who has been this way before. I will fear no ~,vii. for He is with me as a shepherd tending the lamb, a teacher confirming the hope, a Saviour redeeming the guilt, a brother arranging the home­coming. 
As heaven gathers the gentle people one by one, we need less and less to fear death for leading us to an unfamiliar place full of mystery. Even if Goc. were not present to greet me in that timeless hour, though I most assuredly believe that He will be, still 
REV. ROBERT GRIFFIN 
there are friends and relatives whom I have never stopped loving. who have never stopped loving me. Simply as a reunion of the dearest chaps of earth, heaven has to be an ecstasy beyond utterance. At the heart of the reunion, in the midst of the homecoming, there will be that trans­cendent present that Nicaeans in their creed called the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Whether God will be over us or under us, within us or beside us; in none of these ways, or all of these ways, and many more besides, I am not the least bit tempted to guess. The miracles I have seen: the miracles of birth and death, springtime and winter; the miracle of breathing and eyesight, and the miracle of the night music of the wind; and best of all, the simple miracle of people singing and grieving, dying and being born again. All of it, and all of them, have been too wonderful to allow me to doubt the efficiency of my God in planning surprises in the mansions beyond the rainbow. 
In a winter full of grieving for fathers and for children, neither hymns nor Hallmark helps much. The most believable news I have heard about heaven are the names of the folks who have gone there. The eye has seen them, though not lately. The ear has heard them. The heart has known them, I know through them that God loves me, in heaven as on earth. Compared to them, diadems and starry crowns are worthless trinkets. Their names are all the music I need to hear, though the tunes be sung by angelic choirs.

! Rich Branning -a smooth transition 
b.'-Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 
The transltton from high school to college can prove to be a very tning experience for many Notre Dame freshmen. Leaving behind familY and friends and adopting a nc\\ lifestyle complete with strange pc·oplc and increased academic prcs.,urc arc just a few of the problems facing the rookie at Notre Dame. Add to that the extra prc'"'''rL' of participating in varsity athktic.., and you've prepared quite an "" ,_.~omc challenge. Freshman h:,~k,·;ball pla~·er Rich Branning is nlc'l'ling that challenge head on... .o1-1d th1ing rather well at it. 
Cnming to South Bend from his home in Huntington B<:~ach. Calif.. Hr<tdlling arrived at Notre Dame "irl.111 impressive set of statistics. .\11 11utstanding player in high .,,·lltlnl. a\Traging over 27 points per game with his name on prac·tic-all~· everyone's All-Ameri­can li'>t. Branning was one of the most sought-after high school bas­ketball prosepcts in the countrv. With schools such as Michigan. Aritnna. Sou thnn Cal and UCLA Hing for his talent. he chose Notre Dame bec·ause he felt that the ~dwol "had the fll'"' to offer him both a., a ~tudent ~111cj an athlete." 

··1 wa~ looking f<lr certain things in a -.chool: the mo'->t imporrant being ;!c·adcmic\ bcutu~c I reali~:e that .'·ou can't pia~· ba.,ketball all your life." Branning said. "I wanted the opportunity to get the best educa­tion that I possibl~ could. Notre Dame offered me that opportunity. A!> far as athletic!>. Notre Dame was reall~· appealing primaril~· because I thought I could fit into Coach 

Phelps' style of play and that I could develop a good player-coach relationship with him. I think that's important; after all, if you are going to play for a man for four years you have to be able to relate to him and get along with him. The campus. the great basketball facil­ities and the super fan-support for the team also played a big part in my decision. I was impressed with all the schools I visited, but when I left Notre Dame I knew that I wanted to come here." 
Looking back on the first semes­ter, Branning feels his.decision was a wise one. 
"I think I made the right decision." he savs'. "As far as academics are concerned. I am really impressed with the school. It really challenges you. Also, I've met a lot of great people from all over the countrv. which is one of the advantages-that Notre Dame offers since it is sort of a national institution. If I would have stayed out west. at UCLA for instance. I would have met people primarilv from the same area anrl hack­
ground as mvself. I believe that college should be a growing exper­ience. and I think that Notre Dame provides a person with an excellent opportunity to grow." 
While realizing the importance of hi~ accomplishments on the bas­ketball couTt. Branning places eljuttl empha~i~ on his accomplish­ments as a person. This cmpha..,is stems from his strong Christian faith. A memhcr of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes on campus. he believes that his faith offers him a means of coping with the pres­sures that a person in his position must face. Rich Branning has made the transition from high school to 
"It helps me keep everything in rollege life with ease.

proper perspectiVe," Branning re­lates. "I believe that I was blessed with a talent and it is my job to develop and use that talent to the best of my ability. The only time I get upset is when I don't use the talent that I was given. I realize that I am going to have bad games. everyone does. But if I go out and play the best game I am capable of playing then I can walk out of the lncker room with my head up." 
Like all freshmen. the Irish guard has certain goals in sight for his future both at Notre Dame. and after he graduates. 
"The most important thing to me, athletically. is to be a part of a National Championship team here at Notre Dame." he said. "Person­al accomplishment on the court is secondary. Helping the team win is what's important. Helping the team win a national championship.. well that would be super." 
Academically. Branning is con­cerned with receiving his degree . although at the present time he is unsure as to what field he wishes to enter. 
·'The competition here is really 

stiff." he notes. ''but I want to 
work hard and get my degn:e. 
That·~ something no one can take 
awav from vou." 
While no.t an immediate priority 

of his. he would be interested in the 
opportunitY to play profc%ional 
basketball. 
"Playing pro b~1ll has been a 

dream of mine \ince I was young." 
Branning admih. "but I'm sure 
e\Try guy on the team has that 
same dream. Healisticallv. I am 
aware of the fact that only a small 
percentage of college ball players 
ever realit.es that dream. I'm going 
to give it my best shot because it is 
something I feel I have to do. but. 
no matter what. I'll alwavs have m\· 
degree if the opportunity to pia~· 
pro ball doesn't materialize." 
After a brilliant 7-0 start this 

season, the Irish were beset bv a 
period of four straight losses which 
saw them fall from a number two 
national ranking. out of the top 20. 
Branning is confident that the team 
will get back on the winning track. 
"We have excellent talent and coaching." he observes. "What we have to do nm\· is utilize it like we were at the beginning of the season. If we hang together and execute like we have shown that we arc capable of doing we arc as good 
as any team in the country. We've got to come out ready and play tough from the tip-off to the final buzzer. If we do that. we'll be tough to stop... Displaying a positive attitude both on and off the basketball floor. Rich Branning is already making his mark at Notre Dame. as an athlctc...and a person.
