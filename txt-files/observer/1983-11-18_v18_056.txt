University denies negligence in football injury lawsuit 
ByTIMOTHY GIANOITI 
News Staff 
The University has denied allegations ofnegligence in response to a lawsuit of a Saint Mary's junior seekin g more than $10,000 for injuries she received while being "passed up" at a home football game Oct. 31, 1981. 
Legal representative for the University john E. Doran responded Monday to the lawsuit filed by Anne Moorhouse in South Bend Dis­trict Coun. 
The legal complaint for damages states that Moorhouse was "accosted and grabbed by persons unknown to her and 'passed up' ... without her consent and against her stated desires" at the Notre Dame -Navy football gaJTie. 
Moorhouse was dropped to the ground, sustaining "personal in­juries, humiliation, embarassment, and fright," according to the complaint. It adds that she was in need of medical attention and was unable to continue her studies or her student and personal activities. 
David B. Weisman, Moorhouse's attorney. finds fault with the Uni­versity for Moorhouse's injuries, stating in the complaint that Notre Dame "willfully, wantonly, and recklessly failed" to prevent the pas­sing up of Moorhouse or to warn her of the "possibility of such at­tack." 
Referring to the practice ofpassingup as "unruly, violent, criminal and dangerous," the complaint also states that the University was aware of the danger, or at least should have been, and is therefore legally obligated to take some action for the safety of those people attending its football games. 
In response to the suit, the University denies the allegations accus­ing it ofknowing the general public was in t danger and offailing to warn Moorhouse in particular of this allegedly known danger. 
No date for the hearing has been set, and neither laW}er could be reached for comment. 
bombed, rocket~d and strafed Shiite Moslem guerrillas holed up in a bar­racks and a hotel in the Bekaa Valley yesterday in reprisal for the suicide attacks on French, U.S. and Israeli troops. Lebanese police said at least 39 were killed and 150 wounded in the raids on camps ofthe pro-Iranian extremists. 
The French raids were mounted a day after Israeli jets pounded the same area, leaving 4 3 dead, and mo­ments after a massive funeral proces­sion in the city of Baalbek during which a Shiite Moslem guerrilla leader threatened more suicide at­tacks against the French, Americans and Israelis. 
In Washington, U.S. officials said weren't wiped out there "might well be" a need for the United States to carry out an attack ofits own. 

Meanwhile, the Marines began replacing the U.S. peacekeeping contingent that suffered 239 dead in the suicide blast at Beirut airpon Oct. 23. Fifty-eight French paratroopers died moments later in a second bombing, and 29 Israelis were killed in a third explosion in Tyre Nov. 4. 
In nonhern Tripoli, guerrilla mutineers vowed that if PLO chief arafat did not leave the city they would bomb his hideouts "down to the earth." But Arafat said he would leave only when Tripoli's leaders tell him to go. The Red Cross 
Yesterday's French air raids were the second since French peacekeepers moved into Lebanon 1 5 months ago. On Sept. 22, French warplanes hit gun positions in the

Women unprepared for exec role 
ByJOHN MAITHEWS 
News Staff 
Executive Woman ofthe Eighties: Is she fact or fiction? "The jury is still out," according to Susan Holland, the founder and former president of a Chicago-based firm specializing in finding employment for manage­mentwomen. 
Addressing a small group of stu­dents at Saint Mary's last night, Holland said women "aren't ready" yet to fully capitalize upon the op­portunities aYailable to them in the executive market. "Many women claim, 'We want it' and 'We should. 

get ahead' when discussing the woman's ·modern role in the workplace, but our actions aren't al­ways in accord." 
Holland, who spoke as part of the College's "Women's Opportunity Week," said the modern executive is open to hire the best individual· for the job, rather than being swayed by gender, race or other discriminating factors. 
But, Holland saw the marketplace improving in the opportunities it of­fered to women due to turmoil in the economy. She predicted that hard work would be required by all. 
"The economy has caused a real shake-up as to what works and what doesn't," she said. "It used to be thought that if you get in with the big companies, you're set for life. But there's no O.K. today. The door's ajar (for women) but it's U!) to you to get in and make it hapren." 
Holland emphasized the need of women starting their careers to fit into the fundamentally "asexual" business setting. "To play into the female role is to play into the weak role:We want to play into the power ,role ...to changl· the belief that we (women) need to be taken care of."

That was a common reaction as students read an ar­
ticle in Wednesday's Observer. The story outlined the 
actions taken by the University Commission on the 
Responsible Use of Alcohol. "Eliminating or severely 
restricting the usc of alcohol is a serious possibility," said Father William Beauchamp, chairman of the com· mittec. 
But before students begin crying in their beer mugs, they should realize that eliminating alcohol on campus is only one of the several options that the committee will explore. "There is a whole range of possibilities," said Beauchamp. "I don't think things will stay the way they are now, but I can't make any guesses. The commit­tee hasn't discussed any specific recommendations." 
The committee was formed by Timothy O'Meara, University provost. It is a direct result of the Priorities and Commitments for Excellence (PACE) Report, released in November, 1982. The Report recom­mended that: "the Provost, with the approval of the President, appoint a committee of administrators, faculty, rectors and students, to draw up a public st;;.te­ment on responsible drink­ing; to consider whether present practices and 
policies on alcohol are con­ducive to responsible drink­ing; and to recommend new policies where ap­propriate." 
Besides Beauchamp, the committee consists ofseven other faculty, administrators and staff, plus Student Body President Brian Callaghan and Hall Presidents' Council Chairman Mike Carlin. The committee held its frst meeting last spring.

Beauchamp believes that firm evidence exists which proves that an alcohol problem exists at Notre Dame. "The Notre Dame social scene is highly dependent on alcohol," he said. "This is a dangerous situation." 
"The trend throughout the country is to examine the responsible use of alcohol. It is obvious that the problem must be addressed in some manner," he adaed. 
The matter of University liability is also obviously prompting an intense investigation of alcohol use. Un­der Indiana law, the University is almost always liable for the actions of students who were allowed to drink on campus. As ofyet, parents have refrained from suing the University, but the pos­sibility definitely exists, not to mention the threat oflaw­

suits brought by people injured by the actions of drunken students. 
Beauchamp, however, !>l'es the University's respon· sibility in this area as reach­ing far beyond the legal liability. "Under our present situation," Beauchamp said, "drinking is encouraged, is accepted, and is viewed as the center of soda! life. We must do something to change this." 
lbe committee first decided to suggest the strict enforcement of the existing alcohol rules on campus. "We're far from having consistent enforcement of the existing rules," Beauchamp says. Such restrictions in· elude the "no alcohol in the hallways" rule. 
Since its formation, the committee has approached scvt-ral groups for input. Letters were sent to the parents of 7'>0 students, each rector, and all faculty members. The responses so far have presented a num­ber of views. 
But Beauchamp admits there has been little input from students concerning the issue. "I would expect that concerned students would respond," said Beauc­hamp. Callaghan raised the issue at last Monday's Stu· dent Senate meeting, so perhaps the issue will be discussed further. 
"The primary response f've heard from students so 
far is that they are afraid of having a privilege taken 
away," Beauchamp said. "And there arc many people 
problem on this 

Beauchamp thinks that 
morality definitely enters in­
to the discussion. "While 
drinking per se is not im­moral," he said, "drunkenness is immoral. I don't think students consider drunkenness a moral issue." 
The committee will continue to gather input from different sour ces, especially students. Then a recom­mendation will be made to the provost, who will probably present the recommendation to the Board of Trustees. While no official deadline has be set, Beauc­hamp hopes that at least a preliminary report will be completed by February. 
Chances are there will he major changes made in l lni­vcrsity alcohol policy. The yuestion ofenforcement is a key, for, as Beauchamp states, "a rule that can't be en­forced doesn't mean anything." A "dry campus" poses all sorts of yucstions. For example, how will visiting alumni react to alcohol-less football weekendls? 
Because no plans have been proposed and no deci­

sions have been made, there is still pknty of time for student input. Once tht· dt·cision for a dry campus is made, it may be too late.

Police arrest Greyhound strikers, non-union drivers continue service 
Associated Press 
Greyhound strikers dashed with police from coast 10 coast yesterday as th~· nation's larg~·st bus company n:sumed limitnl st·rvice with non­union drivers. More than 60 arn·sts and half a dozt·n injuries were 
r~·ported. 
Most buses carried only a few pas­sengas, but Greyhound called the turnout "'encouragin~" The AFL­CIO said the rt·sumption of service was an allempt to "'destroy" the uni­on and l·alled for a nati,mwide boycou ofGreyhound. 
Tne most violent outbursts were in San Francisco, where rocks and bottles were hurled at buses and workers as 300 strikers demonstrated in the rain, and in Seattle. where strikers smashed headlights, ripped wipers and mir­rors from moving buses and splat­tered eggs and bashed their placards against the vehides. 
Both the union and the company said they were far apart in negotia­tions, although they clucused at the same hotel in Phoenix, Ariz., across town from company headquarters. 
The union said ye::sterday it had reduced its wage and benetlts demands bv S60 million, but the company did not respond. 
The company, which provided 60 percent of America's intercity bus service before the strike. said it would run buses in only 27 states. 
Most of the arrests were in Bos­ton, where .~0 to SO strikers were haukd in after they stood in front of the familiar I0-ton red, white and blue Americruiser buses. 
One Boston policeman suffered a broken leg. and three or four others were also injured. 
In Philadelphia, hundreds of strikers, reinforced by Teamsters and unionized carpenters, plumbers and local transit workers, sur­rounded the bus terminal, stopping buses from leaving and forcing an in­bound bus to discharge its passen­gers several blocks away. 
At the loading area, the strikers burst through a police line, sur­rounded a bus and refused to let it budge. 
In response to the violence, Greyhound asked judges in Philadel­phia, San Francisco and Atlanta for 
injunctions limiting the number of 
pickets. A judge in Atlanta quickly 
agreed, ordering no more than two 
pickets at each entrance to the 
central bus terminal. 
The buses were the first to roll 
since Greyhound was struck two 
weeks ago by I 2, '00 bus drivers and 
terminal workers. 
The members ofthe Amalgamated 
Transit Union refused company 
demands that they accept big pay 
and benetlt cuts to keep Greyhound 
competitive with cut-rate airlines 
and bus lines. 
The AFL-CIO called on all union 
members and their families to ob· 
serve its boycott and asked ·its af. 
tllitated unions to "assist in every 
way possible" the Greyhound 
strikers. 
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland 
said in a statement that the resump­tion of bus service amounted to "an attempt t o destroy their union." He . accused Greyhound of recruiting "strike breakers from America's army of unemployed," and he said putting inexperienced drivers be­hind the wheel was a "dangerous ad­
venture." 
Congress raises national debt limit 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Congress abandonnl all hope yesterday of major action this year to reverse the tidt: of budgetary red ink, as House and Senate negotiators worked on a plan that would extend thl· govern­mcnt's borrowing authority into next April. 
Final action on the debt limit hill was the last big obstade to<:ongres­sional adjournment for the year today. 
Thl· l·nd of the 198-4 battle to reduct: fnleral budget deficits was signaled Wednesday night when the 'ienate rcfused. 6';-:H. to nmsidt·r an ~~lH billion dt·ficit-reducing package of tax increases and spl·nding cuts proposnl hy Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and l~twton Chiles. D-Fla. 
Tht·n. after midnight. senators ap­proved. S8--l0, to reston· federal borrowing authority by raising the national tleht limit to SI.4S trillion. allowing the gov~·rnment to l'Xtend its nt:tlit hill until February. 
Thl· I Joust· alr~·ady had agreed to President Reagan's request to boost the cl'iling to S 1.61 <; trillion, which administration officials said would meet the government's borrowing needs through the end of the fiscal year next Sept. 30. The current c\·iling is S1.389 trillion. 
Negotiators from both chambers ~'>ught yesterday to compromise on a debt limit between the House and Senate figures. The White House expressed hope of covering credit needs for the full tlscal year, but con­gressional leaders said Reagan would have to settle for less. 
Senate Majority Leader Howard H. baker, R-Tenn., predicted a new debt limit extending into next April. "I think it'll go quickly," he said, and Speaker Thomas O'Neill agreed. 
According to Treasury Depart­ment officials, any delay in raising the credit lt1nir-wf1trtd cause some government checks to start bounc­ing by about Dec. I. 
The government has been operat­ing essentially Nil a cash-on-hand basis since Nov. I, the day after the Senate rejected raising the debt limit as a protest against record budget detlcits expected to hit S200 billion this fiscal year. 
Despite widespread concern about budget deficits, membcrs of Congress are rductant to do much more than talk about them without assurances that Reagan will support politically painful steps to reduce the deficits. 
After the Senate vote dismissing the Domenici-Chiles plan, Domenici said there probably will not be any major deficit-reduction action until after the 1984 elections.

Tension in Western Europe grows as 'Soviet Empire' threat expands 
Assoclatt:d Press 
BERLIN -Just past Checkpoint Charlie, a few feet west ofthe Soviet Empire, the word "Solidarnosc," or Solidarity, is emblazoned on a tall building. Every so often, someone wonders whether Russian tanks will roll across and blast it ofr. 
Few expect an imminent Soviet invasion. But tension over NATO's imminent plans to install Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe focuses attention on how the Kremlin sees the world. 
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov says, as his predecessors did, not only that Moscow promises not to launch a first nuclear strike but also that its conventional forces are maintained for defense alone. 
The danger. Western analysts say, is that Soviet strategists attach a

wide range to what they consider as defense. 
"The Soviets are more than defensively aggressive, but not fool­hardy," said a respected Asian diplomat in Moscow. "They will not embark on something they cannot win -or with too high a cost." 
For example, the Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan on Christmas Eve, 1979, was explained as a response to a plea by a friendly neighboring government. 
"It's on our border," observed a Soviet journalist in conversation. "What do you expect?" 
Perhaps 125,000 Afghan civilians and guerrillas and 5,000 Soviet sol­diers have been killed so far in continuing war and reprisals. Soviet commentary suggests the human and material loss is not considered excessive, and the political cost has been relatively low. 
As elsewhere in the Soviet Empire, journalists' access is restricted. The British weekly observed recently: "The 55 American advisers in El Salvador rate much greater attention than the 105,00() Russian soldiers in Af­ghanistan, largely because the bloodshed in Central America is served up to American television viewers with their breakfast cornflakes." 
Afghanistan is the only country forcibly added to the Soviet sphere since the 1945 Yalta accords, but Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Angola have committed them­selves totally to Moscow. 
South Yemen provides full access to the island of Socotra, essential to the Soviet fleet in the Indian Ocean. 

Syria, Iraq and Libya account for most ofMoscow's $5 billion a year in arms sales. Other Third World states closely embrace the Soviet Union, relying on its military aid and politi­cal support. 
India and qther key non-aligned nations tread carefully to avoid offending Moscow, not only a vital source of arms but also the only counterbalance to a Western c:~pitalism that some leaders dis­trust. 
Moscow spends an estimated s~ billion a year on subsidizing Cuba and Vietnam, according to Western experts who acknowledge such a figure is impossible to determine ac­
curately. 
A recent British Foreign Office survey calculated Soviet non­military aid to the Third World last year at $8.3 billion, only 0.19 per­cent of its gross national product, and 76 percent went to Cuba, Mon­golia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan. 
"They can only do so much," said a ranking State Department official in Was_hington, with wide Third World experience. "Their record for keeping friends without paying has not been great." 
The developing world is studded with Soviet white elephant projects 
built  in  the  name  of  lasting  
friendship  since  aid  was  first  
lavished  on  Kwame  Nkrumah's  
Ghana in the late 19SOs.

However, the new program has not caught on very quickly with the student population, and Hickey would like to sec a significant pick­up in business. He attributes the slow start to the fact that students are unaware of the new service. "People have told us that it is poorly 
he expects that new pizza boxes 
printed with money-saving 
coupons, free soda offers, and in­
creased publicity will boost sales 
and student awareness. 
Competition from individual hall pizza sales is also a reason for the company's limited success, but Hickey asserts that the food service's product uses better ingredients and is generally superior. 
Should business fail to increase, the Leprechaun Pizza C< mpany could eventually be diS<.''Jntinued. but Hickey remains optimistic. "We plan to give it enough time to catch on, and once students realize what a good deal it is, it should become more popular." 
Students can phone pizza orders to either the Huddle or the Oak Room during their regular business hours.

The Observer reported on Oct. 4 that the mainframe would be replaced; however, at that time the l'Xact choice ofsystem had nut been decided. 
The replacement computer will he leasl·d for two years. Richard Spencer, a'isistant provost for com;lllting, said the two-year l<:a'ie will allow a better assessment of long-rangl· computing needs while providing an interim solution for current high demand for computer time.

vances in the microcomputer in­dustry, the need for a campus computer network is critical. 
The savings of the two-year lease, Spencer said, will allow work to begin on the network and give enough flexibility to keep up with technological advancements. 
An alternative to the two-year plan wa~ a five-year option on an IBM 30H I D that would deliver four times the current power, said Spen­cer. In addition to less flexibility be­cause of the longer commitment, Spencer said the 3081 D was not chosen because it would have re­quired a 5220,000 increase in the annual computing budget, an amount that might have jeopardized plans for the development of the campus network.

find out that the desired course closed five minutes earlier. 
However, during this advanced registration I experienced an additional impediment to my course selection when I asked to take a checkmark course in theology, more specifi­cally, Introduction to Asian Religions. Not only did I have to wait in line to get the course, but I was also questioned by a theology professor about which introduction to theol­ogy course I had taken, whether I had at­tended a Catholic high school, and why I wanted to take the course. 
I can understand why he would want to 
know my reasons for taking the course, but if 
attending a Catholic high school is a prerequi­
site to some courses, I would have taken that 
into consideration seven years ago. 
Even though only six credit hours of theol­ogy are required, it seems that the theology department still believes that six credit hours ofCatholic theology should be a requirement at a Catholic university. Trying to enforce their beliefs without stating it as an official university requirement is a definite infringe­menton the students' freedom ofchoice. 
Part of the argument for taking two semes­ters of Catholic theology seems logical. The 
I best place to take one of the courses is at a Catholic university. It would be a shame for a student to leave the uni versity without ex­periencing at least one Catholic theology course. However, Notre Dame is a liberal arts col­lege as well as a Catholic university, which means it should force the students to broaden their experiences. In "The Hesburgh Papers: Higher Values on Higher Education," Father Hesburgh states "The student must come to a basic understanding of the actual world in which he lives today. This means that the intellectual campus ofa Catholic university has "no boundaries and no barriers . " Asian religions are influential in today's world, and restricting the student,s' knowledge of these religions as well as any other aspect of religion would be a definite 

A couple of students were talking about pre-registration the other day. They seemed to be looking for some challenging courses outside their majors. 
"Damnit, I need a theology course, but I 
l\eith Picher­
Profundity's demise_ 

want my schedule to look like Digger Phelps's basketball schedule." 
The other paused a moment. 
"Did you ever think of taking Corporate Conscience?" 
"You mean that's cross-listed as a theology course? What'll they think of next, Upper­middle Income Theology 265'" 
"Well, I don't know. l hear there's an atheist teaching a course cross-listed in theology." 
The two continued to fill in their marksense forms, not having been challenged so much since the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. After a while, the second came across The Nuclear Dilemma in the course listings. Wondering if his friend knew ofthe course, he queried. 
"This nuclear war and peace class looks interesting. Should I take it under theology, philosophy, government and international relations, sociology, peace studies, economics, or communication and theatre?" 
"Those idiots! You mean to tell me they didn't list it under physics, architecture, medieval studies, or physical education? I bet you need to understand English to take the course, why wasn't it cross-listed under that?" 
He decided not to sign up for the class, and began to worry instead about fulfilliing his philosophy requirement. Having slept through Philosophy 201 his sophomore year, boundary or barrier. 
The more knowledge the .youth of today have about the world, the more prepared they will be to make the decisions of tomorrow. The liberal arts goal of broadening the stu­dents' experiences is just as important at Notre Dame as the Catholic experience. Course selection should reflect that fact. 
Another reason for desiring the students to take two semesters ofCatholic theology paral­lels the university's belief that Catholirs should experience spiritual growth while at a Cathoic university. But not all the students at Notre Dame are Catholic and are not looking for spiritual growth. during my checkmark course interview the questioning professor did not even ask me ifl was Catholic. 
On the other hand, Catholics looking for spiritual growth can obtain it in other ways besides taking two college theology courses. The most evident way is through the acces­
sible  Catholic  activities  and  services  on  
campus,  where  actions speak  louder than  
words.  

But another way in which spiritual growth can be attained is through the re-evaluation of one's religion from the completely different standpoint of another religion. I am sure that there are many students besides myself that 

feel confident enough about their own religion to learn about other religions and ·compare to their own. 
There are many devout Catholics who have never had a college theology course, but ex­perience spiritual growth through ecumenism. Restricting the type of required 
. theology course a student could take might end up couteracting the university's goal and instead hinder the student's spiritual growth. 
Basic requirements are anecessity at a uni­versity, and two semesters of theology are a necessity at a liberal arts college. Ifthe univer· sity requires two semesters ofCatholic theol­ogy it should state it officially. The theology department should not become autonomous, d eciding which student can take which class according to the department's unwritten re­quirements. 
If they want the students to take two Cath­olic theology courses, then officially increase the requirements to three semesters of theol­ogy, letting the students take whatever they want for their third semester. 
Under no circumstance should they turn a student away from taking a theology course, even though the prerequisites have been met, because someone in the department feels that that studen! is not ready for the class. 
The compromise of cross-listing 
he was looking for a second class which would be more interesting. 
"You know they could incorporate most of the philosophy department into the pre­professional programs. We've got philosophy oflawfor the lawyers-to-be, medical ethics for future doctors, business ethics, philosophy of science, and technology and society for people double-majoring in computers. Do you think we could come up with a philosophy of football for the football players?" 
"I don't think they could make it easier than Bobik's class; I bet it's been on the athletic deprutment's computer printout since Sorin came to South Bend." 
A scream interrupted their conversation, accompanied by an angry roommate who en­tered the ~om and slammed the cloO£< He was a senior majoring in accounting, economics, computers, philosophy, theology, and public administration.

"Those S)%!( $!,"he said, "I went through all this trouble to get a couple of courses I wanted. Come to find out, the computer people prefer I not t:1ke the PL/I language in the math department, but take it in the com­puter department. 
"And the theology department doesn't want me taking non-Catholic theology courses toward my two-class requirement. I'd like to learn a bit about Asian religions before I graduate." 
"Well, you know they're only looking out for your best interests. Why don't you take some genuine theology course like Corporate Conscience?" 
"No, too much work. They might make me learn something."

that have led their pro squads to Super Bowl 
glory the last two years -are deified to immor­
tality in the Notre Dame pantheon. 
The non-great are damned into undue suffer­ing. In the last I9 years, there have been five such quarterbacks. 
In I965, Bill Zloch was the quarterback be­tween I964 Heisman Trophy winnerJohn Huarte, who led the Irish to a No. 3 ranking, and a sophomore superstar named Terry Hanratty wpo would lead the Irish to No. 1 in 1966. Zloch tearfully broke_down late in the year when he realized that he did not meet the quality ofexcellence set by his predecessors. 
In I971, CliffBrown was the quarterback af­
ter a quarterback whose named rhymed with 
Heisman, and before another quarterback the 
following year, Tom Clements, who would lead 
the Irish to the I973 national championship. 
Not being great was bad enough, but the fact that he was a black man in a traditional white man's role led to one ofthe uglier scenes in Notre Dame athletic annals. The racial insults and overall questions ofhis competence drove Brown to become a defensive and abrasive per­son at times.

Getting even: 

By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
A popularObserver column last year called "The Bot­tom Ten" gave the Patrick Henry "Give me Uberty or give me Garden State, but gl'le mesomething" award to Alabama last year after it lost its third game ofthe year. 
Guess who wins the Patrick Henry award this year? 
Contingent upon defeating the Air Force Academy on Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame will close out its season at Memphis, Tenn., on December 29 in the Liberty Bowl. 
Last year, ofcourse, a victory over Air Force would 

have ensured a Bluebonnet Bowl bid for the Irish. A 
tremendous wishbone attack by the Falcons, however, 
'i<juelched any ofthose hopes last year. Ironically, that 30­
1 7 loss by the Irish came after a heartbreaking loss to 
Penn State the previous week, and also after the Falcon 
team had two week.~ -like thisyear -to preparefor the 
Irish. 
The victory over the Irish was the springboard for the Falcons in regaining national respect in college football under the tremendous guidance ofHead Coach Ken Hat­field Not only were its eight wins last year the second greatest number ofvictories in its 28-year history, but its victory over Vanderbilt in the Hall ofFame Bowl last year marked Air Force's first bowl triumph ever. 
With Air Force holding a 7-2 record, including a cur­rent five-game winning streak, and returning a wealth of 1:xpericnce from last year's talented squad, Notre Dame Head Coach Gerry Faust realizes that he may be in for an­other difficult game. 
"I would hope our players would feel like they have 

something to prove after what Air Force did to us out 
Notre Dame tries to deal with Falcon flexbone so that it can get revenge and be free to go to Liberty Bowl 
there last year," says Faust, "but that isn't going to make it any easier for us. They've had an extra week to prepare for us, just like last year, and that can make a real dif­femce." 
"Air Force has 18 seniors and juniors among its 22 starters and that means they have got an awful lot ofex­perience to call on. They got over the hump by having a winning season and going to a bowl last season, and this year they've just followed through on that success." 
Don't be surprised ifthe game has a similar offensive domination by both teams like last week's Notre Dame­Penn State game did. The Falcons are similar to pro foot­ball's San Diego Chargers. When their offense is on ­which is most ofthe time -they are a tough force to reckon with. Their defense, however, is not that great ofa force. In other words, they'll score on you, but they will also be scored upon. 
Notre Dame's defense, oft-criticized for being too slow, will have a difficult challenge in handling the small but quick Falcon offensive unit. Although the offensive front line has four ofits five starters weighing 240 pounds or less -which gives the Irish about a 25-to 30-pound advantage per man -Air Force will try to compensate with the same quickness that stunned the Irish last year. 
The Air Force backfield is experienced, balanced, and very talented. The rushing attack spredded the Notre Dame defense for 284 yards last year, and is averaging 335 yards a game this year. In the last two weeks the Notre Dame defense has given up more yards rushing to Pitt and Penn State then it has to any other team all year. They could ill-afford to continue this downslide against a ground-oriented team like Air Force. 
Heading the unit is All-American quarterback can­didate Marty Louthan. He ha~ rushed for over 648 yards and I 5 touchdowns this year while averaging more then five yards a carry. ~year he rushed for II 5 yards on I5 carries against the Irish and scored two touchdowns. 

Louthan, though he averages only I I passes a game, has thrown for over 1,000 yards this year while averaging al­
most 20 yards per completion. 
FullbackJohn Kershner is the leading rusher with 713 yards and also averages more than five yards a carry. Al­though starting halfbackjody Simmons has been suspended for the Notre Dame game, Mike Brown is a very capable replacement. Brown has run for 5 3I yards and is averaging an amazing eight yards per carry. 
Wide receiver Mike Kirby is the one-man wrecking crew for the Air Force passing attack as he has caught 32 passes for 738 yards. 
The Falcon defense has great shortcomings. Their seven up-front people in their defense average out to 6-2, 215 pounds. The unit has given up an average f 425 yards a game. Yet, it has also been known to be quite scrappy at times. IfNotre Dame can pick up where it left off last Saturday against Penn State in terms ofoffensive efficiency -the Irish rolled up 526 yards oftotal offense against the Nittany Lions -then Air Force's ground con­trol game will be hard pressed to keep up with Notre Dame whose defense was ranked No. 3 in the nation before last week's game. 
"They're playing with much the same team they had a year ago, and we've just got to adjust to the kind ofgame they play," says Faust. "We didn't do a very good job of that a year ago." 
Another bad job this year will mean death -not 
Liberty -to another Notre Dame football season.

A Farewell Appearance 
Some lesser-known seniors look to life after ND 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports IJ'riter 
b'l·ryhody knows that Blair Kid, Stacey Toran. Rick Naylor: jon Autry and others like them art· playing their final home g~mc Satur­day. But there will he other seniors in uniform Saturday. fhese pl~yns grab few headlines, hut make solid contribution~.

John Mosky is the ll'adu oftht· Notre Dame spl'ciality teams. He wears number -tH. On Saturday afternoons Mosely can he seen leading hb unit downfidd in kamikazce-like pursuit ofopposing ball t·arrkrs. More importantly Mosley is recognized as one ofthis year's tri-t·aptains. . . 
"It's an honor 10 he a l·aptain," he said. "As a leader on spenaltty teams, my job is to make thl· tackle or at least he the first one downlidd." 

I· Mosley started his Notre Dame career as a member ofthe _of ti:nsive unit. lie played both tailback and wingback durmg hts fresh­man and sophomore t·ampaigns. In 19H I ht· started the last six games at winghack. As a member of the offensive unit, Mosley has two 10uchdowns to his credit. Mosdy made thl· transition from offense to defense midway through thl· 19H2 StJringdrills. fie saw action in all II games last fall and colk<.'ted 2-! tackles. This yt·ar, aside from his role on specialty teams, he plays as back­up to Pat Ballagc at weaksidc cornerback. . As Mosdy looks back over his four years, he notes that not all ofhts mt·moril's arc pkasant ones. "It has been an experience," he says. "( )ne day you're sitting high and mighty. The next day, you're working ti>r a spot. Ir has forced me to be more mentally tough. more patient, and more disdplined. Each time I'm in the game, I pretend char it may be my last. so I rake gn:ar pride im my work and in being ready evny timl·." Acn·pting his limited rok as a senior has nor been easy, and as he looks ahl·ad, more emotions are stirred. "As a senior you like to be able to put ir all together and perhaps see what you come out with," he says. "This has been more ofa sincere type ofyear for me. No_ one rt·ally undt·rstands what it is like ro be a senior. As each year wm_ds down and down, you ~et: that it just doesn't stretch out as far as tl sn·ms it could." ( >ne of his more plea~ant memories came against Alabama his freshman year. "W'e were waiting for a kickoff," he recalls. "I. was back with Jim Stone and I told him to rake ir no matter where It went. 1was roo nervous. The hall came right to me, though, so alii could do wa~ catch it. I returnt·d it 20 yards, and suddenly I felt pretty good." After graduation, the economics major from Omaha, Ncb., has in­tcrvit-ws schedult-d with NHC and ABC. He may work at a bank or rake some rime off and go to Europe and relax. "These have been soml' pretty intl·nse years," he says. "I just need some rime to think things out." -~ 
Tom Cushing is a quarterback. Many may nor know this since, ovt-r the last thret· years, his only varsity appearance came in this year's Army game wht·n he played in the last few minutes, and com­pktnl one pa~s. 
( :ushing's role is an important one, though. Aside from keeping stats on thl· siddine, tht· 6-1. I HS-pound acn>Unting major from La (irangc, 111.. kad~ the prep team during practice sessions. Cushing and other prep team members must run the offense ofrhe next Notrt· Dame opponent in ordl·r to prepart· the defense for the game. 
As a quartnhat·k during three ofhis four years in high schoc~l, Cus­hing's teams lost just four games. Three ofthe losses came dunng hts senior year. 

As a freshman at Notre Dame, Cushing played interhall football un­til he suffered an ankle injury. Being away from football influenced him to try out as a walk-on his sophomore year. "I missed the activity and the competition," he explains. "Seeing the atmosphere around Notre Dame towards football made me want to be a part of it." 
Being prep team quarterback is not always easy, hut Cushing en­joys the challenge. "Being able to help the team out and scemg myself improve, makes it worth it," he says. "The beginning of the week is fun because the defense isn't yet familiar with the plays. But if I'm doing well at the end of the week, then something i~ wrong. If they're stopping us, though, personally I don't like it, but I know we've helped them." 
Cushing will take the LSAT in December. Law school or employ­ment near Chicago arc his future considerations at this time. 
Flanker Mike Favorite wa~ recruited by schuols in the BigTen, the Midwest, Arizona, and Vanderbilt. as well as the Ivy League. He chose Notre Dame though. "I always wanted to play ar Notre Dame," he says. "It was always something special whenever I talked to the people here." 
Favorite joined the Irish traveling squad his junior yearand played in five games. Freshman year he played only with the junior varsity. hut sophomore year he moved up and saw action in six games. 
Learning to play both split end and flanker has increased Favorite's chances to play this season. "Playing wide receiver. guys come in and out a lot, so I know I'll play either for joe (Howard) or Milt (Jackson)," he says. "I like rhe feeling ofbeing able to contribute. It's also nice to know that I will have earned my first letter." So far, Favorite has made eight catches for 123 yards. 
His first letter is not all that he has earned this year. Favorite was reccntlv selected as a recipient ofthe National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame Scholarship Athlete Award. The award is given to athletes who have demonstrated excellence in both athletics and academics. It carries with it a $3,000 grant. "When I got the letter. I was surprised to sec the word 'congratulations,'" he recalls. "I wa~ very honored. It reflects on the University and that makes me proud too." 
As of now Favorite is not sure what his future holds. 'Til probably apply to MBA schools,'' he says. "I really haven't decided" 
Kevin Smith was a highly-recruited quarterback from Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. In his career, he threw for 3.557 yards and 29 TO's. When it came time to make his decision, he had narrowed his choices to UCLA, Stanford, Arizona, and Notre D!iime. "To play ar Notre Dame is what I always wanted to do," he says. "I thought they had lost interest, though, when they hadn't called for a while. Suddenly Dan Devine called and said he wanted to talk to me. Then I made my decision. It would be Notre Dame." 
Torn ligaments suffered during his freshman year "dropped me to the bottom going into spring." He has worked as prep team quarter­back until becoming number three quarterback this season. "It's b.e~n frustrating," he says. "I'm always hoping to get the chance to play, so I've wanted ro be ready ifcalled upon." . 
Because he missed his freshman campaign, Smith has a red-shtrt year still available, but is unsure about what will happen. "I have to talk to Coach Faust," he says, "bur so far they haven't expressed inter­est in (my staying)." 
IfSmith doesn't stay ar Notre Dame,lhe will probably go to MBA school. "It's a good possibility," he says. 

Walk-on linebacker Tom Murphy has seen only spot duty over the last three years. His main job has been on the specialty teams, where he earned his letter last year. 
Although highlyrecr~ited by Indiana and Purdue, Murphy chose Notre Dame for family reasons. "We're a Notre Dame family," he ex­plains. "My dad is a law professor. I've been brought up with Notre Dame. It was the only school I was going to go to whether they of­ti:red or not. I alsn wanted a school that offered a good education as 
well as good athletics." 
The accounting major will be in­terviewing for jobs in South Bend and Chicago a~ well as raking the LSAT in December. 

As a walk-on, playing football can he difficult. but Murphy has no regrets. "Looking back. I'm glad I did it," he says. "It wa~ a lor ofwork but it wa~ worth it." 
Since Daane Spielmaker began his career ar Notre Dame. he has played a host of positions in the defensive hack­tleld. He has seen action ar both safety slots as well as helping in the nickel defense. He saw action in eight games last season and wa~ credited with seven stops. So far this season Spidmakcr has made four stops while playing backup ar strong safety. Freshman year he played in the last seven games including the Sugar Howl. 
tie ha~ seen more action of late, and is pleased with the turn ofevents. "It feels good to be considered a part of the team," he says ... After all the years ofhard work, it's good to get in and do some­thing."

Stacey Toran 
Graduating cornerback 
Toran and Brown 
Two instant hits leave ND slightly disappointed 
ByALGNOZA 
Sports Writer 
Two ofthe mainstays ofthe Irish defensive secondary will be playing for the last time in Notre Dame Stadium this Saturday. Chris Brown and Stacey Toran are reaching the twilight oftheir college career, leaving Notre Dame at a time wher: the Irish football outlook is decidedly less than rosy. 
The bleakness that coincides with their departure, however, is ironically parallel to the ray ofhope the two to shed upon the dreary mood that prevailed at the close oftheir rookie season at the Dome. 
It wasJanuary of I 981 and the Irish loyalists were left scratching their heads. The mighty men in green had lost their last two games of the year -to Southern Cal and Georgia -while at the same time dropping from the top spot in the polls to a god-forsaken ninth. Their record that year was a decent 9-2-1. Nothing for Grantland Rice to write about, but loads better than the 7-4 debacle of'79. 
The misgivings ofthe present were overshadowed, however, by the promise ofthe future. Thirty-nine lettermen returned from that Sugar Bowl squad for the 1981 season, along with 16 starters and a defense that could stopa clock just by looking at it. Brown and Toran were prominent members ofthat defense, precocious youngsters who contributed greatly as freshmen and seemed destined to one day return the Irish to the top. 
To the top they went, but only for a short week. Then down they went. The proposed return trip to the top turned out to be a rest stop on a lengthy skid to the depths ofmediocrity. For the past three years the Irish have compiled a cumulative record of 17-14-1, abstaining completely from the final polls. And, as for post-season play, it's give me Liberty in '83 or another Christmas break at home. 
High hopes have died during this drought, giving way to 
widespread discontent and disappointment. It's sort oflike Bill Wal­
ton marrying Nancy Lieberman and having a son grow up to be a 
jockey. Bum Phillips, the wisest philosopher since Casey Stengel, 
said it best. "Potential is just a fancy way for saying you ain't done it 
yet." 
The Irish certainly had the potential. But needless to say, they ain't 
done it. 
"Per-sonally I'm very disappointed because I felt we had the 
talent," Brown says. "We've had a lot ofbad breaks though, and things just haven't gone our way. People didn't expect us to do as well my freshman year. But we surprised them. Then during my sophomore year we ran into an extremely tough schedule. We 

looked past a lot ofteams thinking they would roll over and play dead because we were Notre Dame. But last year teams like Air Force showed us that wasn't to be. They soundly beat us. Period." 
Toran points to adjusting to a new coach as the root ofthe problems. "It hasn't been a disappointing three years fot me because you have to realize that we've all gone through a learning process. It's tough to adjust to a new coach and a.new system." 
Whatever the case may be, the Irish have come under heavy fire. Gerry Faust has been ruthlessly treated like a person who's not supposed to have feelings. So, in fact, have Brown and Toran. It was Brown who was christened as goat after the Purdue game in 1981. Toran also has often been a favorite target for the pointed finger of arm-chair quarterbacks. 
"Everyone has their opinion," says Toran. "That's fine. I don't take 
it as a criticism. I just try to blank it out." 
The 6-4, 206-pound Indianapolis native should be summoned in this spring's NFL or USFL drafts. His quickness and overall athletic ability enable him to bea top-knotch cornerback prospect, and, with a concentrated weight-gaining effort, he could even be considered as a linebacker. "Right now I'm thinking about Air Force," he says. ''I'm still in college so pro ball is not on my mind." 
Brown has also shown himself to be a hot pro prospect. In the wake ofthe team's misfortunes, Brown has maintained a continuous personal development. The goat label has long been dead. "Hard hit­ter" and "tough man-to-man defender." They are the new labels. 
"I think the other guys in the defensive backfield like Stacey, Troy (Wilson), and Joe (Johnson) are quicker than me," he confesses. "But playing underJohn Krimm I learned the mental aspect of the game. He taught me that you don't have to be the greatest athlete to cover a guy one-on-one. Sure, he had a lot oftalent, but he became -great because he applied what he learned. Ifyou apply what the coaches tell you, then you won't make mental mistakes." 
This may be Brown's last college game, unless the Liberty Bowl 
gets its wish. When asked about the prospect ofplaying in the Bowl, 
Toran states exactly what was on his mind. 
"Air Force," he says.

through all the trials. Each had character. 
For Blair Kiel there is no denying that he takes with him a lot ofbitterness. Yes, he will al­ways have fond memories ofall the friends he has made while at Notre Dame. Yes, he is proud ofthe high-quality education he attained, and he is proud that he will receive his marketing degree in time with the rest of his senior class next May. 
But, as for shedding tears ofsentiment in his final home football game this weekend, forget it. Enough tears have been shed in private during his tumultuous four-year quarterback­ing regime at Notre Dame. A person can only take so much of the confusion, so much ofthe mocking, so much ofthe blasting, that he has had to endure as quarterback for Notre Dame. 
Like the aforementioned four quarterbacks, Kiel will be categorized in Notre Dame annals as a non-great quarterback. No Reisman can­didacy, no national championship ring, and doubtful Super Bowl capabilities. 
Notre Dame fans in the New Jersey Meadowlands, apparently very well versed in the art ofkicking someone when he is down, reminded him ofthose failures and unfulfill­ments earlier in the year. Entering the game in a mop-up role against Army, he was greeted with boos, insults, and mocking laughter from many in the crowd. 
Minutes later, the Notre Dame sideline was in 
pandemonium. Kid had just bulled over a 
defender for a touchdown. It wasn't a game­
winning touchdown by any means-actually it 
put the Irish up by 42 points -but the joy that 
his teammates felt for his success could not be 
contained. There was a tremendous respect 
that they held for this man because ofthe 
character he maintained despite being 
relegated permanently to the sidelines after the 
Mian1i game. 
"The team thought enough of me to vote me 
as their otlensive captain," says Kiel. "I felt that I 
owed them at least something in return for their 
vote ofconfidence." .......,., · 
While his teammates and coaches have filled 
pages with quotes admiring the leadership and 
strong character he has continued to display in an adverse situation, one person can put it in better perspective than anyone else. 
"From the moment I arrived, Blair took me under his wing," says freshman quarterback Steve Beuerlein, the man who is beingtagged as the next great Notre Dame quarterback. "Naturally when Ibecame a starterit was a very tough time for him, and he was deeply hurt. But the great thing is that it hasn't affected our relationship at all. He's helped me with my studies and with just anything that makes it easier for me to adjust. There has been absolute­ly no jealousy or anomosity." 
To the brash youngwarrior, Beuerlein, Kiel is the venerable chiefwho has given constant advice and wisdom to Beuerlein -a luxury that Kiel himselfnever had. "He's helped more than anybody ever could, because he knows more than anybody ever could about the quar­terbackingpostion at Notre Dame," says Beuer­Jein. "He's warned me on what things to watch out for and told me about the people who I can trust and not trust and how to properly deal with such situations." 
"I don't want him to have to go through some 
ofthe things I did." says Kiel. 
But the most important thing that Beuerlein 
has learned from Kiel is that respect as a person 
is just as important as respect as a quarterback. 
"That's what's really important. especially at 
a place like Notre Dame where football is not 
everything," says Beuerlein. "Blair is a perfect 
example ofthe class ofpeople Notre Dame 
turns out through his character. He had several 
opportunities to turn against that kind of mold 
because ofall the things he has had to go 
through. but he didn't. Instead he went out of 
his way to contribute in some way for the 
people around him." 
"I respect him as much as anybody in my life. 
He's a great, great, person. and you wouldn't 
find anvone on the team who wouldn't agree." 
Like 'ztoch, Brown. Slager, and Lisch. Blair 
Kiel doesn't leave a legacy ofAll-American 
honors or national championships. That fact 
hurts because, deep down, he feels that he had 
enough talent to accomplish those goals. 
But, like the others, Kid leaves a legacy 
which shows that the mark ofa winner extends 
far beyond what a stadium scoreboard or stat 
sheet says.

athering a lot of media atten­tion, both in political and cinematic circles is The Ladd Com­apany's recent release of"The Right Stuff," an account ofAmerica's first flights into space in the 1940s. 
"The Right Stuff' traces the begin­ning ofAmerica's space age from the first pilot to break the sound barrier to the individual launchings ofthe seven Mercury astronauts into space. It is a story ofthe fears and the fame that the astronauts and their wives experienced during the monumental launchings. It is also a story that is not afraid to show the reality behind the glamour of the Mercury launchings. "The Right Stuff' raises several questions concerning the treatment of the astronauts and their possesion or lack of"the right stuff." 
"The Right Stuff' forms its story around two groups ofastronauts. One group is the "hardcore" group oftest pilots that make their home at Edwards Air Force Base in Arizona. Sam Shepard ("Frances," "'Days of Heaven") plays Chuck Yeager, the first test pilot to break the sound bar­rier. He is constantly being chal­lenged by other pilots that wish to take him off of the flight "pyramid." However. when government offi­cials arrive at the base to select 
sev::n potential Mercury astronauts, 
Yeager does not wish to go, and 
other, less skilled pilots are taken in­
stead. 
What follows after the base scenes 
is a long, detailed selection process 
to see who the first men into space 
will be. Jane Donaker is very funny 
as the nurse administering the tests _ro the astronauts. During these test scenes, the film offers some ofits . best humor. 
When the seven are eventually 
selected, the media intervenes and 
the astronauts get a sweet taste of 
potential fame. It is at this point, 
through the use of the media, that 
the film raises several questions 
about the reality and the image of 
the seven Mercury astronauts. For 
instance, is the public being fooled 
into believing that these astronauts 
are the "all American men" that we 
see drinking heavily and cheatingon 
their wives? Are these pilots real 
heroes or media-manufactured? Is 
Chuck Yeager, who refused the glit­
ter and glamour, the only pilot with 
"the right stuff!" Finally, a subject on 
which the film places a lot ofem­
phasis is the treatment ofthe 
astronauts. Are they really pilots, or · 
are they nothing more then the "test 
animals" which the NASA engineers 
treat them like? 


Two actresses who portray astronauts' wives deserve special praise for fine charcacterizations. Veronica Cartwright plays Betty Grissom, wife ofGus Grissom, whose landing is dampened by a technical malfunction. As a result of his less than perfect flight, Gussom receives not quite as an elaborate reception as previous astronauts had. Cartwright is hurt and feels cheap at her very standard recep­tion. She says that she was looking forward to talking to President Ken­nedy and discussing "things" with Jackie. 
MaryJo Deschanel is also enjoyable as Annie Glenn. Annie is deaf, and therefore, finds herself defenseless against the constant onslaught ofreporters' questions. In a very special moment from "The Right Stuff," Annie refuses an inter­view with the President because of her speech impediment. 
Outstanding among the actor astronauts is Ed Harris in his portrayal ofJohn Glenn. Glenn, maybe because he has more dialogue and screen time than the other astronauts, presents a well formed characterization ofGlenn. Glenn's flight into space is also one ofthe most visually pleasing mo­
ments ofthe film. 
While "The Right Stuff' is im­pressive in the way it treats it's unique subj.ect matter, it is in need ofimprovements. At times the film, which runs over three hours. drags and, to put it bluntly, becomes boring. Also, the film employs a comic book sense ofhumor in dealing with its characters. In other words, some characters are often too simplified to emphasize certain character qualities, therefore sacrificing realism. The film also places its strange band ofhumor in situations where such humor seems out of place. The humor in the con­trol room exemplifies this. 
A recent report in "USA TODAY'' stated that first and second week returns for the film were lower than expected. The producers of"Right Stuff" claim that a movie like this can only keep getting better. They are counting on word of mouth to build up "The Right Stuff' to where it should be. The article also pointed out that the majority oftoday's moviegoers are a much younger, less nostalgic crowd than would usually be attracted to this type of film. 
Today's high admission prices could be another explanation for the unfulfilled financial potential ofthis film. At S4 to S5 a person, a family can hardly afford to go to a family movie such as this one.

or all the bleeding hearts who have ever been rejected by a Screw-Your-Roommate prospect, know that you have not been alone. For all the shafted innocents who didn't get to go with their first choice, know that you are among many. 
For all you didn't do, this one's for you. 
The following is a series ofexcuses, with no comment on their validity, collected from various people I polled. They all wanted only 
one thing -a date for an SYR -but got instead: 
The Immediate Answer. 

"My parents are coming in that weekend." 
"I have a boyfriend/girlfriend back home." 
"I can go but I might have to leave early because I might have to go early to work the next day." 
"I'm washing my hair now -can I call you back?" 
"My grandmother's coming to visit that weekend." 
''I'm gonna be in a wedding that weekend." 
''I'm not in a very good mood. You should go with someone else­you'll have a better time." "I'm going to ISll that weekend." "I really can't -my doctor said my appendix was going to burst any minute. I'm on my way to the hospital now." 
''I'm engaged." 

"I've already turned down three people in your dorm and it would look bad." "I don't know ...call me back tomorrow." "I have a late basketball practice Friday night and an early practice 
Saturday morning." 

"I don't go out on blind dates anymore. Last week I had a bad ex­perience at an SYR with a blind date. and I'll never go on another one again!" 
''I'd love to go but I have a three-page paper, a four-page paper, and a test to study for." 
"I have a friend coming in this weekend." 
"I don't know -that's the night I have to vacuum the lint out ofmy pockets." "I don't know ...my roommate and I might be going to a party. Can I call you back tomorrow?" "I'd love to go but I have eight friends coming in this weekend ­but ifyou can find dates for all ofthem, I'll go." 
''I'd rather die." 

"Someone else asked me and I already said yes" 
''I'm sorry, but our dorm's having an SYR the same night." 
'Til have to ask my boyfriend/girlfriend." 
"I'm waiting for so-and-so to ask me but ifhe/she doesn't, then I might go." "I might have to be in Montana this weekend." "But wait-I didn't even tell you the date yet." "Well, I'm sure I have to be somewhere." 
The Call Back. 
"I just found odf1\1a~e to go home." 

'Til have to think about it -J've never been in this situation 
before." 
"I didn't realize you were a senior." 
"I just found out I have mono." 

"I just saw your picture in the dogbook and you're ugly and I don't want togo." 
"I thought you were someone else." 

"I'm going to a concert in Kalamazoo." 
"(just found out I have a boyfriend/girlfriend." 
"I thought you meant next weekend." 
"I didn't realize you were a freshman." 
"I promised someone I'd go to this play with them downtown and that's the only night they could get tickets for." "I'm going on a retreat instead." 
That Night. 

"I have to leave at midnight because my boyfriend/girlfriend from 
home is gonna call me at 12:30." 

'Til have to leave early because I gotta watch a movie for a class 
tonight." 

"I just remembered my brother's flying in frqm Boise at 11 and I 
have to go pick him up." 

"My leg hurts and I can't dance. Besides, I think I have a real bad 
headache -I should go home." 

"I have to leave early to get my iron lung treatment." 
"I have to leave at I 0 -I'm expectingan important phone call from 
home because my cousin might be in Lebanon." 
"I have to leave early because I have to study for a make-up exam 
I'm taking tomorrow morning." 

"Hi. I'm so-and-so's roommate. So-and-so is sick. Would you like to go with me instead?" "Uh ...okay. Sure, that sounds fine." (An hour ofthe SYR elapses.) "Can I use your phone? I should call my roommate and see how he/she is doing." "Uh ...yeah, sure." (A few minutes elapses.) "I'm sorry. My roommate-so-and-so·_ is really sick. I'd better go." 
The Walk Home. 

"I hope you know I have a boyfriend/girlfriend." 
"Did I tell you I had mono?" 

"Can you walk me to Alumni/Badin? 1 have to meet my 
boyfriend/girlfriend there." 
'Tm engaged, you know." 
"Do you want your flower ba!.:k?" 

"That's okay, I can walk myself It's not that far." 
Ifthere's any I've missed, I'm sure someone will be reminded ofone or two more the next time an SYR rolls around.

Rugby..ends season today 

Cluh sports have been busy -and successful -this fall with one Indiana State championship, an invitation to a national tournament, and two dominating victories in home tournaments. Here is a recap oftheir seasons. 
RUGBY-Perhaps the most successful club this fall was the rughy team. Coming off a third-place finish in last spring's Midwest championships, the club is working to regain the national prominence it enjoyed a decade ago. Last year's high finish was enough to earn it a spot in the final four of the NCAA rugby champion­ships, a chance the team had to forego because of ex­ams. This year's championship is scheduled before finals, though, and the team took its first steps to gain a second invitation with a I 0-4 record this season. 
Included in its victories were three wins in a tcmrna­

ment at Indiana University that earned the team the In­
diana State championship. Notre Dame edged Ball State, 
9-6, destroyed Louisville, 44-0, and shut out host In­
diana, 6-0, In the finals. Their first-place finish assured 
the Irish of an invitation to the NCAA Midwest tourna­
ment and a chance to go on to the national champion­
ships in the spring. 
Notre Dame was led again this year by third-year law student Brian Moynihan. Although Moynihan could not equal last year's feat of scoring or assisting in every game, he continued to play a vital role in the success of the Irish. "He is a combination of knowledge and cx­pcricncc," says dub president Geoff Branigan. "Ifthere is one reason that we've risen to where we arc now it's because of Brian. Ht:'s able to teach us both on and off the field. He taught us to be smart rugby players rather than just athletes." 
Another important factor in the success of the Irish was the timely contributions ofnew players in key posi­tions. Wht·n Steve Schneider went down in the second game ofthe year with a separated shoulder, junior Tom Reidy and st·nior Alan Gianotti stepped in to take over the kicking job. It was Gianotti's foot that made the dif­t'ercnce in the championship game in the Indiana State tournamt·nt as he successfully converted two penalty kicks for the only scores of the game. 
When the team wasn't scoring on kicks, they looked to seniors Sean Madden and John Reid to lead a well­balanced scoring attack of both hacks and scrummies. The development of the serum in last spring's Midwest championships gave Notre Dame a new dimension that put them over the top. "The: good play of the serum allowed a lot of people to score," Branigan explains. "It really made us a much better rugby team." 
In addition to the wins at Bloomington, Notre Dame placed second in a tournamt:nt at Holy Cross over fall break. They also won the refurbished Cantwell Cup from Ohio State and dominated Dayton, 28-12, in the last game ofthe season. 
In a specially added game, the Irish will face Air Force today at 3 p.m. on Stepan field. The Air Force, one ofthe most prestigious rugby teams and the runner-up to Cal­Berkeley in last year's national tournament, added the game after the regular season because of Notre Dame's strong finish and rapidly reentry into the rugby elite. The two teams were scheduled to meet in the first round ofthe national tournament last year before Notre Dame had to withdraw, so the match may be a preview ofthe 1984 championship. 
WATER POLO -While the rugby team was win­ning games at Stepan field, the water polo club was making Its own waves with a respectable 11-9 record. In a conference dominated by varsity programs, includ­ing four out ofthe lOp 19 teams, Notre Dame was able to hold its own and even move up a notch in the rankings. 
The highlight of the season was the team's first home tournament with a field of five good teams. Michigan, the University of Illinois, Kenyon College, Purdue, and Notre Dame took to the Rockne pool and only the Irish stayed afloat with a perfect 4-0 record and an im­pressive victory in its first home tournament. 
The team qualified for the conference champion­ships and finished sixth in the tournament. The good showing moved them from last year's seventh ranking

Club Corner 
to sixth in the conference. This was only the second 
time in the history of the club that it was invited to the 
conference tournament. 
On defense, the Irish were led by all-conference 
goalie Chris Packer. In the finals of the home tourna­
ment aganst IUinois, Packer gave up only eight goals 
(that's outstandingfor water polo) during the first three 
periods. More remarkably, he allowed only one more 
goal throughout the fourth quarter, two overtime 
periods, and one sudden death. At the end ofthe sudden 
death overtime, Packer blocked a one-on-one 
breakaway and then started Notre Dame's own break 
that led to the winning goal. 
Sophomore Mike Roberts led the team with 96 goals 
and was followed by senior captain-coach john Smith 
and sophomore Steve Blaha who contrbuted 40 goals 
each. Senior Mike Erhard, sophomores Tom O'Reilly, 
John Coffey, and Charlie Brady, and freshman standout 
Steve Guenther were also crucial to the Irish attack. 
The water polo club is looking to become a varsity 
sport in the near future. Many ofthe referees and oppos­
ing coaches were amazed at the organization and com­
petitive level of Notre Dame even though there is no 
non-student coach. With the young talent and soon-to­
be-new facilities, the team is aiming to ·reach that goal 
soon. 
CROSS COUNTRY -This fall was a rebuilding season for the women's cross country team as only three runners returned from last year's team. Added to that, senior Rose Marie Luking, the number two runner last year, was hit by a car early in August, sending her down and out and giving her a late start on this year's conditioning. 
Sophomore Anne Attea paced the Irish once again this year and Luking recovered in time to reclaim her number two position on a rapidly-improving team. At­tea established herselfas one ofthe top runners in all of the team's meets. She consistently finished in the top ten of every race and never finished behind another Irish runner. Returning sophomore Susan Wanchow heads a list of runners vying for the other top positons. Rachel Allen, Mary Beth Fiske, Patty Santos, and Katie Ruppe round out the field for Notre Dame. 
The women's track club has already begun to train for the upcoming indoor season. Its first test will be at Purdue on December l 0 for a practice meet before beginning its regular indoor schedule next semester. 
SOCCER -You can't blame the women's soccer team ifit feels a bit frustrated about the fall season. After outplaying six ofits eight opponents, all the team has to show for its efforts is a l-4-3 record. 
The team's lone win was a 12-0 shellacking of Ferris State. Forward Letty Valdez scored three times and Beth Noland and Mary Borkowski both had two goals to lead Notre Dame. Michelle Grace, Helen Locher, Susan Gor­don, Kerry Havercamp, and Angela Eggleston each had one goal to finish the scoring for the team. Goalkeeper Chris Anders turned in her only shutout of the year and combined with sweeper Nancy Hoodecheck to shut down the Ferris State offense. 
Notre Dame could understand how it felt to get beaten up on by a bigger team as it fell 9-0 to Michigan State and 8-0 to Indiana on consecutive days. Both teams have varsity programs and used the chance to flex their muscles against an outmatched Notre Dame. The team fought back though, and outplayed Northwes­tern, St. Mary's, and Wheaton College before settlingfor ties in each game. 
The team will begin the defense of its indoor title in January.

The Observer Friday, November 18, 1983 -page 17 Rouse optimistic 
Belles· open basketball season 

By DAVE WD..SON 
Sports Writer 
Shooting, quickness, and defense. These seem to be the three keys to the success of the 1983-84 Saint Mary's College basketball season. Second-year head coach Michael Rouse looks beyond possible height and depth problems and instead is firmly optimistic about his team's strengths. 
"Our shooting is exceptional," says Rouse. "Teams will tend to un­derestimate us this year because of our height, and they may not an­ticipate our speed nor our shooting capabilities." 
The Belles will sport a ten-player squad this season; unfortunately, juniorforward Carla Sebasty will not be eligible until the spring semester. Rouse will start three returning let­termen: senior forward and co­




A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A 
captain Cyndy Short (9.8 points per game last season), junior center­forward Elaine Suess ( 16.1 ppg last season), and junior guard Mary McQuillan ( 5.4 ppg last season). Rounding out the starters will be sophomore forward Beth Kreher (pending a foot injury) and fresh­man guard Kris Pantelleria. Pan­telleria JOms the Belles with impressive marks. She is an all-state honorable mention player out of Benton Harbor, Michigan, whom Rouse considers to be both "very quick" and "consistently ag­
gressive." 
Of the remaining players, junior forward Teresa McGinnis will hold the first substitute spot ( 10 ppg last season), while freshmen Lori White and Mariclaire Driscoll will back up the guards, and junior Betsy Ebert will serve both the forward and cen­ter positions.

"A small team allows the freshmen to play right away," points out Rouse. "It will be good preparation for future teams." 
Hoping to improve on a 9-13 record oflast season, the Belles must overcome a definite height problem. At 5-8, Kreber and Ebert stand as the team's tallest players, while center Suess measures up at just 5-5. As a result, the team will turn to a full­court press and rely on their strong outside shooting. 
"We plan to play full-court defense right from the start," an­ticipates Rouse. "I have seven dif­ferent defensive patterns from which to choose, and most of these will be a man-to-man situation." 
Perhaps the single category that will make or break the Belles' season is turnovers. 
Rouse declares, "We run a fast­paced offense with a minimum of passing. Add to that a 30-second shooting clock and you have the potential for many turnovers. They were our biggest problem last season." 
An advantage of this year's squad over last year's is experience. Five of seven lettermen return, which is a far cry from last year, when the Belles had lost their top six players 
and  were  working  under  a  new  
coach.  
Judging  the  opponents  this  

season, Rouse anticipates a much more difficult schedule than in his first year. "Eight of nine teams we beat last year will not return this year. On the other hand, just as many teams who did beat us will return on this year's schedule." 
The coach sees Siena Heights, Franklin, Defiance, and Aquinas Col­leges among the more difficult con­tests. The season will also carry the usual Goshen Classic, Hanover Tournament, and SMC Roundball Classic, which, unfortunately, may not be played because one of the entrants, St. Xavier College, withdrew. 
On Sunday the Belles will hold a preseason scrimmage against Lake Michigan College, a top junior col­lege that went to the nationals last year. Then Tuesday night, the team will formally open its home season with a 7 p.m. contest against Siena Heights College in Angela Athletic Facility. 
According to Rouse, "I'm pleased with the preseason, excited about the team, and anxious to play ball." 
After five weeks of intense practice, the Belles are ready to produce.

They will be getting more pressure and must be able to react to it." 
Offensively the Irish have had little trouble turning on the red light. Co-captain Brent Chapman leads the team with eight goals and seven assists. Bob Thebeau is second adding, four goals and nine assists. Benning is third with 12 points on four goals and eight assists. 
"Our first three lines are playing well," said the Irish mentor. "If we can get more stability out of the fourth line, it will be a big help." 
Tim Lukenda, the freshman goal·· tender who collected the first Notre Dame shutout of the year last weekend against Illinois, will be in the nets on Friday. Smith has not yet decided on Sunday's starter. 
Putting all of the positive aspects of the team aside, one thing that has been disappointing for them so far this season is the attendance at the home games. 
Friday's face-off is at 8:00p.m. On Sunday aftern~on, the game gets un­der way at 2:30. Both games are at the ACC. Notre Dame and St. Mary's students are admitted free with their student ID cards.

Inexperienced but talented squad 
Wrestling team begins action 

ByJOE BRUNEm 
Sports Writer 
Prohahly to the surprise of many, 

the Notre Dame wrestling team has 
opened its 1983-84 season. This 
season's first showing for the team 
came last weekend in tht: Michigan 
State tournament in which the Irish 
finished seventh and had two 
wrestlers reach the finals. It also 
marked the heginning of a difficult 
schedule that Notre Dame's inex· 
perienced but talented squad will 
have to face this year. 
Coach Brother Joseph Bruno, C.S.C., heads into his fourth season as tht.· Irish coach with an impressive career record of39-13-1, including a brilliant 18·2 mark last year. This year he faces a big challenge as his latest team lacks some experience at this point ofthe season. Notre Dame is a young squad with only one senior in the starting lineup, but they possess the greatest overall depth of any squad in Notre Dame history. 
Commenting on the inexperience 

of the team, Bruno says, "I don't 
think we will be outclassed by any 
team in terms of conditioning or 
skills. The only thing our opponents 
may outclass us in is experience. We 
lack the mat experience of many 
other teams." 
That lone returning senior in the lineup is Michigan resident Mark Fis· her. In the 126-pound class last season, Fisher posted a 38-13 record which was enough to give him the school record for the most wins in a season. 
Despite the skill and experience 

of l'isher, however, a junior, Phil 
Baty, also plays a major role in the 
team's success hy providing a great 
dt.·al of lt.'adership. Baty, a 4.0 pre· 
mcd studcnt who was elected by his 
teammates to be team captain, holds 
down the 177-pound weight divi­
sion. Baty posted a 32·9·1 mark last 
year, and he won the "Outstanding 
Wrestler Award" for the second 
straight year. 
Bruno had a great recruiting year, hringing to Notre Dame nine fresh­men. Three of his recruits will fill out the I 18-pound clas:; with Carl Hildengcr and Mark Hetrich attempting to edge out Greg Fleming, last year's Michigan Class A 
State Champion. 
Other freshmen also fighting for a starting hid will be Bob Stefan, Scott Biast.·tti, Tom Ryan, and George Logsdon. Stefan and Biao;etti will at­tempt to edge out junior Dan lleintzdman in the 142-pound class. Heintzelman was 24-1 'i last season, and he also holds three school rccords. At 167, Ryan will att<:mpt to heat out John Krug, last year's win­ncr of the Golden Leprechaun

Award. Logsdon and junior Matt Stamm will battle for the starting nod at 190 pounds. 
Two twins from California, Louis and John Carnesale, control rhe starting spots in the I50· and I 58­weight classes. Junior Scott Ben­tivenga will attempt to take John Carnesale's position at I 50. At I 58, senior Pat Jolin is battling with the other Carnesale. Louis. 
Rounding out the last two weight divisions will be Mike Golic and either Glenn Glogas or Man Doug­herty. Once again, Irish football standout Golic will anchor the heavyweight division. Golic posted a brilliant 24-2-1 record in the 1982­
83 season. At 134, two sophomores 
-Glogas, a redshirt, and Dougherty 
-will vie for the starting nod. 
IRISH ITEMS -At lao;t week's Michigan State tournament, the Irish gave their most impressive showing ever in the tourney. Baty and Fisher reached the finals, and Louis Car­nesale placed fourth. Coach Bruno was pleased with the reams perfor­mance and considered the tourna­ment to be "a gauge for the rest of the season." 
The Irish will once again hit the road this weekend, this time travel­ing to Carroll College in Wisconsin to meet rival Drake and four Wiscon­sin schools in a tournament.

St. Thomas presents challenge in hockey 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team will face its first hig challenge of the 198.3-84 season this weekend. The Irish play host to St. Thomas, last year's Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference champions. St. Thomas is a Division II varsity team from St. Paul. 
Notre Dame takes a 5-0 record in­to the series, hut all five victories have come at the expense of sub­stantially less talented opponents. To date, the Irish have outscored their opposition hy an astounding 56-4 margin.
