People on the move 
Collins stresses action 
By DAVID RICKABAUGH 
StaffReporter 
Marva Collins, creator of Chicago's Westside Preparatory School -a sdwol which enrolls children that were considered problem students in other schools -held a lecture last night in the Library Auditorium discrib­ing "people on the move." 
Mrs. Collins stated that people on the move find meaning in life and view success as a lifetime pursuit. 
The Chicago educator said, "the action ofone man is greater than the ideas ofone thousand. Each individual must toil each day like it was their last day on earth. These beliefs combined with a goal, makes the difficult not impos­sible." 
People on the move, according to Mrs. Collins, "must be universal rather than local individuals. The wide base of knowledge will enable them to create future culture and mold the destiny of the future." 
A question and answer session followed the lecture. Mrs. Collins addressed inquiries from the overflow crowd which centered on the aspects of her school. 
The private school, according to Mrs. Collins, focuses on a personal ap­proach to teaching. "We regard the students as individuals, children arc not nuts and bolts, each arc different. "Teachers become actors and actresses, and in the evening they practice for the next show. They fail to actually teach," she said. 
Mrs. Collins explained how she handles problem students, "I simply tell them, we're not going to suspend you, we're not calling your mother, you are either going to learn or die." According to Mrs. Collins, the teachers 
never resort to physical violence. 
While responding to a question dealing with criticism of her program, Mrs. Collins commented, "if you get by '60 Minutes' you should be able to walk into heaven without any problems." 
The life of Marva Collins since her decision to form a school for children who were labeled intellectually disabled, retarded, or slow to learn, is the subject of a television movie "Welcome to Success: The Marva Collins Story." Cicely Tyson, who spoke at Notre Dame last week for the Black Cul­tural Arts Festival, will portray the educator in the film. 
The lecture was one of the events sponsored by the Black Cultural Ans (iestlval which is celebrating the achievements and talents of Black Americans from Feb. 8 to Mar<:h 7 with various events and programs. 

Inflation slows to 9.1 percentrate 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Inflation slowt·d to a 9. I percent rate in .January, the lowest level since last summer, ao; rare declines in food and house prices helped offset new bursts in energy costs, the govern­ment reported yesterday. 
The most unusual development wa~ a 0.4 percent drop in house prices. the first decline in five years and the largest since 1956. 
However, the Reagan administra­tion, in its latest pitch forage of the president's economic program, said a respite from double-digit inflation 
'We're still in a dangerous double­digit inflation environment.' 
would be short-llvtd and consumers can expect steep~r price increases In the months ahead -even for food and housing. 
President Reagan's budget direc­tor, David A. Stockman, said the report "indicates that we're still in a dangerous douhk-digit inflation en­vironment in this country" and un­derscores the need for the "deep budget cuts" the administration is proposing. 
Murray Wcidenbaum, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, said January's figures, "athough welcome, provide little basis for optimism with regard to tht· undt·rlying rate of inflation." 
Meanwhile, the federal reserve moved yesterday to clamp down fur­ther on this nation's money supply, and its chairman warned the Congress would only worsen infla­tion if It whittles away at Reagan's proposed budget cuts. 
Reserve oard chairman Paul Volckcr also cclared that unless in­
tlation  abate  the  central  bank's  
money  polk  will  mean  further  
pressure on th.  economy's a bility to  
expand.  

Part of Reagan's economic program calls for the steps an­nounced yesterday by Volcker, who endorsed the president's proposals. 
The encouraging news for shop­pers in January was that food prices at grocery stores fell 0.4 percent, the first decline in II months, while clothing costs declined 0.2 percent. 
Gasoline prices, however, jumped 
3.8 percent and fuel oil prices were up 7.5 percent last month. 
All sources of energy accounted for one-third of last month's total rise in consumer prices, and further steep increa'ies for energy are due in February as a result of President Reagan's decision on Jan. 28 to lift remaining price controls on domes­tic oil. 
Overall, consumer prices rose 0. 7 percent in January, the smallest in­crease since last July and a noticeable slowdown from the 1 percent increases during each ofthe prior four months. 
As a result of moderating prices, workers' inflation-adjusted weekly earnings rose 0.7 percent in January, the largest monthly increase in four years. But the gain wa'i more than of­fset by a sharp jump in Social Security taxes. Consequently, Reagan last week urged Congress 
workers' buying power declined 0.1 to cut $41.4 billion from the 1982 percent for the month and was budget and pass a three-year, 30 per­down 4 percent sinceJanuary 1980, cent tax cut to bring inflation down the Labor Department said. and revitalze the economy.

The main goal of Patrick Borchers 
and Rosemary Canlno, if elected stu­
dent body president and vice presi­
dent, will be to close the 
communication gap between stu­
dent government and the student 
body. 
"We can not work effectively with 
the Administration unless we ap­
proach them with the backing ofthe 
whole student body," stressed Bor­
chers. Both candidates will work to 
improve the communication lines 
between student government and 
the student body to achieve the 
necessary unity. 
"We feel that existing student 
apathy has been caused by a confus­
ing student government system. We 
want the students to know that the 
Student Senate is the body for them 
to voice their opinions and Ideas. 
Also, to increase student input we 
intend to bring the student govern­
ment to the student." 
Pat Borchers is a member of the 
Student Senate and feels this gives 
him an insight into the workings of 
the Senate. "I see the limitations of 
the senate and its potentials." 
Rosemary Canino is the president of 
Badin Hall. 
The need for greater security has been a concern of both candidates for some time. Borchers was in­strumental in creating the student escon service and hal! had the responsibility of coordinating and running it. Their platform calls for establishing the escort service as a permanent program. They plan to push for increased awareness of dorm crime and fire safety and the creation of an engraver loan service for students to mark their valuables.

Deal in Panama 

Former aide accuses]ordan 
By CHARLES). HANLEY 
Associated Press Writer 
NEW YORK -The former chief aide to the exiled shah of Iran says Hamilton Jordan, chief of staff in the Carter White House, double-crossed the deposed ruler by "making a deal to have the shah arrested in Panama" in an attempt to .win freedom for the American hostages. 
In an inter­

view looking .-.·-·-·-·-·-·-·-·lo:·»:· back over the 
====================·r=ocu·s · 
events of the 
.r -­
hostage crisis, Roben Armao used harsh language to describe U.S. actions during the late Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's three-month stay in Panama. 
The former Pahlavi aide was particularly bitter toward Jordan, who arranged the haven in Panama. Ar­mao said he knew all along that the former presidential assistan "could not be trusted." 
He characterized the shah in the last months ofhis life as a man worried that his family would be scarred and branded by the hostage crisis, vulnerable to Panamanian extortionists and driven into a dangerous legal corner by U.S. officials playing on his imperial pride. 
Armao, 32, a New York public relations consultant associate with the Rockefeller family, began working for the shah in late 1978. When the shah fled Iran in January 1979, Armao joined former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and banker David Rockefeller in fin­ding refuge for Pahlavi In the Bahamas. He later managed day-to-day affairs for the exiled royal family at their temporary homes in Mexico, the United States, Panama and Egypt, where Pahlavi died last July. 
The ex-shah's stay in New York for gallbladder sur­gery led to the seizure ofthe U.S. Embassy and hostages in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979. Six weeks later, Pahlavi left the United States for a resort island off the coast of 

Panama -Armao said Jordan and White House counsel Lloyd Cutler assured the cancer-stricken Pahlavl that "Panama had no diplomatic relations (with Iran), no extradition. He would be safe, comfortable, and they would provide for his medical care," meaning he would have access to American hospitals. But, Armao said, it eventually became clear to him thatJordan later "made a deal to have the shah arrested in Panama." Jordan refused comment Wednesday on Armao's latest assertions, but he has answered previousclaims of a U.S. "deal" to have the cx-.shah arrested by saying the matter was out of U.S. hands because Panamanian law requires the detention of anyone accused of crimes In extradition proceedings. While the shah was in the United States, Iran demanded his return in exchange for the American hostages, hoping to try him for alleged mass murder and corruption. With Pahlavi in Panama, the revolutionary regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini began coun proceedings to have him cxtcadited.

The disappearances of two more black boys prompted police searches in Atlanta neighborhoods yesterday, as prospects dimmed for a huge federal cash outlay to bolster the special inquiry into the cases of 20 dead and missing black children. Public Safety ~om missioner Lee Brown said the cases of the two black boys w.h? ~tsappeared Tuesday were being handled by the missing persons dtvtston and had not been turned over to the special unit set up in the other cases. About I,700 people are reported missing in Atlanta each year. Brow~ said, and 80 percent are found in 24 hours. Reports of misstng chtldrcn -even habitual runaways -have lately been receiving wide attention because ofthe continued unsolved killings of children. Child disappearances are not turned over to the special child deaths task force until it is determined they fit the profile of the 20 cases under investigation. All the dead and missing children inves­tigated by the task force were aged 7 to I5, all were black, and many received little parental supervision. All but two were boys. They were. killed or disappeared over the past 19 months. -AP 
President Reagan's federal hiring freeze is "neither unconstitutional nor contrary to law," according to U.S. Dis­trict Judge Charles R. Richey, meaning that even those promised employment before the ban was invoked on Inauguration Day are out of luck Richey said that the "20,000-odd" persons who received ac­ceptance letters from federal agencies between the election and Jan. .20 were not legally hired, since Reagan's executive order was retroactive to Nov. S. The letters were "mere offers of jobs which did not rise to the level ofappointments," Richey said in a ruling from the bench after oral arguments. Attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union, representing worls:crs . in several government agencies, told the judge the letters constituted appointments. The uni­

lawyer for the challengers, Robert M. Tobias, declared he would ap­

G. Gordon Liddy was there. So were feminist Betty Friedan and poet Allen Ginsberg. National Urban League Presi­dent Vernon Jordan Jr. made an appearance, as did former Treasury Secretary William Simon. These strange bedfellows, or rather par­tygoers, came together to celebrate perhaps the only thing they have · in common: they'd all seen action on William F. Buckley Jr.'s public television show, "Firing Line." Every one of Buckley's former guests was invited to the show's 15th birthday cele~ration at the New York Yacht Club on Tuesday. And, with some exceptions, they were happy to oblige. Buckley said the controversial lawyer William Kunstler had returned his invitation after checking the line that read: "I regret I cannot be present." "And he crossed out the word regret," Buckley 
said. -AP 
Should college athletes be paid? one 
Nebraska state legislator thinks he has the answer. Sen. Ernest Cham­bers (D-Omaha) has proposed putting the entire University of Nebraska football team on the state payroll. Chambers hasn't specified how much the gridders would be paid, but says it could be a minimum wage. Players who excel could then be offered merit pay or bonuses. Chambers believes the football team deserves payment because it at­tracts a great deal of money to the university and the state. He also intends to usc public hearings on his football payment plan to inves­tigate other alleged problems within the football program, including charges of racism. That possible investigation may be one reason Nebraska football coach Tom Osborne isn't impressed by Chambers' generos' :y. After noting that paying the players would violate NCAA regulations, Osborne offered "no comment" on Chambers' plans. ­

The Federal Reserve acted yesterday to further 
tighten the nation's money growth, and its chairman embraced Presi­
dent Reagan's budget-cutting program gram "with all the ardor I can 
bring to bear." Paul Volcker's endorsement of the presidential 
package cast aside concerns that the chief executive and the inde­
pendent central bank might clash over anti-inflation strategy. Instead, 
Volcker told Congress that any attempt to whittle Reagan's proposals 
would only worsen the economy. "The president has made a recom­
mendation for spending cuts that are more massive than anything we 
have seen before," Volcker told the Senate committee. -AP

It's time to shout 
The elections for Student Body President are this Tuesday. For those ofyou still awake, there are only two tickets running (both coed), the fewest number in recent memory. You could blame this on student apathy, or perhaps increased awareness. 

Is this the annual "rag on student government" column? The weekly? No, this is an honest assessment of the organization and capabilityofthe student voice as it stands right now, in relation to the almightyfdministra­tion. 
As it stands, this is the "chain ofcommand:" the Hall Presidents Council receives "input," a buzzword ifever there was one, from students in each dorm, and passes proposals on to the Student Senate. The Student Senate this year replaced the old Board of Commissioners, changing the composition slightly and adding five members specially elected for the Senate. 
Logically, the Student Senate would then pass these proposals on to the University, and Vice President of Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear. That's how present SBP Paul Riehle envisioned things at this time last year in his master plan for centralizing, or simplify­ing if you will, the student voice. Remember that at Notre Dame, student government does not actually govern, It only represents the students' concerns to the University. Sort of like a lobbying group. 
Anyway, the important part of Riehle's plan was to eliminate the Campus Life Council, which was the final step between the Senate and the Administration. The reason for eliminating the CLC was that it had voting members of the Administra--. ..,_..--.._, tion on it, including Fr. Van Wolvlear, whom the proposals wouid go to regardless. Unfortunately, the Board of Trustees told Riehle he could not ter­minate the CLC, even though a student referen­dum showed 96 percent of the student body to favor such a move. 
Riehle was undaunted, consoled only by the fact that the Trustees told him he could rewrite the CLC con­stitution. He organized the Senate anyway, even though it was merely creating another body to deal with. But in revising the CLC constitution, he wrote out all ad­ministrators as voting members, the logical thing to do, and last week the Trustees approved ofthis change. 
That's where it stands. Little has really changed, ex­cept that there should now be no interference from the Administration in the formulation ofproposals. Student government workers will argue that students' attention has now been focused on one viable body, the Senate, and that a consistent, continuous voice can now be expressed. In the meantime, patience has been a key word in following the progress of student government in the past year. 
What's next? Now that there is a unified voice, does that mean the Administration will pay any more atten­tion? No one seems to know, and there obviously is

little reason for optimism. Don Murday, one of the two candidates for SBP, feels the key is persistence, to keep hammering away at the near-sighted until they finally agree to wear glasses. The next problem is getting them to take action on what they see. Ifthey see it. 
Tt.te contrast between the two candidates is not great, despite obvious differences in appearance and demeanor. Murday, an outspoken junior from NewJer­sey, worked closely with Riehle this year, perhaps more closely than Riehle's running mate, Don Ciancio. He perceives the social tension here, the lack ofa practical, casual meeting place, as one of the biggest stumbling blocks to keep Notre Dame from becoming a somewhat normal university. 
Pat Borchers, Murday's opponent, views himself as something of an outsider to student government, "on the fringe" as he put it, having served as a Student Senator, while running mate Rosemary Canino is presi­dent of Badin Hall. He does not believe the student voice is unified yet, and places that as one of his top priorities for next year. Bor­chers also feels that Riehle wasted an entire year by not convening the CLC once, and he said he will use that body extensively ifelected. 
For a time, it appeared the Murday/Kenney ticket would run unopposed when the ticket ofswimmingstar Mike Shepardson andJunior Class President Mike Cassidy fell through due to various misunderstandings. But Canino, searchingfor a running 
mate, found Borchers willing, and the pair was able to enter the race when the deadline for applications was extended. Some have questioned the seriousness ofthis ticket, but both appear sincere and dedicated, and they are ready to challenge Murday. 
Perhaps the quality most desirable from an SBP is per­sistence, a willingness to badger the University tireless­ly until they finally cave in -Murday has great experience here. Borchers also seems willing to be per­sistent, and he brings a few novel ideas to the campaign. But we disagree with Borchers' perception that the stu­dent voice is not yet unified. It is, as much as it ever will be. Now it's time to shout.

Accepts presidency 
Brademas goes to NYU 
By TOMJACKMAN 
Exe,·utire Neuos Jidlf(Jr 
Former Rep. John Bradema.~ (D· Ind.), the Third District congres­sman defeated la.~t NoVt·mher by Republican John Uiler in his I I th hid for ret:ll'l:tion, accc.pted the position of president of New York llniVt·rsity yesterday. 
Brademas hn:ame the university's I :\th president, succee!,lin!( John Sawhill, who lc:ft NY! I in August of I979 to ht·come Oeputy Secretary of Eru·rgy under l'rt·sidcnt Carter. Sawhill had promist·d that he would return at tht· l'llll of Carter's term, hut instead an·eptnl a post as chair­man oftht· U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp. 
Tht· fonm·r !louse majority whip had reportedly been considering presldt·ntial olfers from several uni­vt·rsilles, and wa.~ sekcted for the NYU post over more than 200 ap­plicants. These included Ivan Ben­nett, dean of the NYU medical st·hool and acting prt·sident in the intt·rim, Thoma.~ Ehrlkh, former dean of the Stanford Law School, Barton Gregorian, ex-provost at the University of Pennsylvania, and Maurice Glicksman, provost at Brown University. 
Bennett had been the leading can­Jidate for the position, according to the NYU student newspaper, hut withdrew last week for undisclosed reasons. 
Bradcma~ wa.~ sworn in yesterday in a ceremony in NYU's Bobst Library. He commented in a state· mcnt that "the two principle ob· jectivcs, I believe, of a great university must be tinancial stability and academic excellence. They arc intimately linked, and I am com­mitted to the achievement ofboth." 
Bradcmas, a Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar, taught government at Saint Mary's College before being elected to Congress in 1958. During his House career, he gained recogni· tion as a leader in the field ofeduca­tion, and was active in passing legislation which led to tuition grants and loans to college students.

Leftists decline in El Salvador 
White cautions against U.S. support 
W ASliiNGTON (AP) -The for­mer U.S. amba.~sador to El Salvador said yesterday that the leftist gutrril­la movement Is "broken and declin· lng" and that any attempt to bolster the government through large-scale

Robert White, a career diplomat currently here awaiting rea~sign­ment, said "I believe the right is con­

White said El Salvador's security forces, including so-called death squads, are responsible for most of the killing in the Central American nation and criticized the "weasel words" in a State Department docu­ment that suggested that respon­siblity for I0,000 deaths last year was evenly dvided between leftist and rightist forces. 
He said rightist death squads have committed most of the assassina­tions, as many as 5,000, including "thousands and thousands of young people for mere suspicion of being leftists or being sympathizers of lef­tists." 
He also said he is certain that three Roman Catholic nuns and a fourth churchwoman from the U.S. were killed by rightist elements.

The 1981 Freshman Advisory Council has been active, but still has "a very longway to go," according to Council Chairman Robert Thompson. 
The most recent activity sponsored by the Council was the Freshman Night at the AC(:. Over 200 people attended the event, which included skating, dancing and a movie all for one dollar. 
"This is the kind of low pressure social event that I'd like to see the Council, and the University as a whole, have more of," Thompson said. He added that "the people who stayed had a good time." 
One of the Council's purposes is to act as a vehicle for freshmen com­plaints, according to Thompson. "Freshmen should realize this. They

have not used their representatives to the fullest potential so far." He said that if freshmen have com­plaints, they should take them to their respective dorm representatives. 
Some of the past activities sponsored by the Council were the Thanksgiving Food Drive, which netted $300, and the Class of '84 t­shirt contest. Thompson added that the Council was also responsible, in cooperation with Fr. Greg Green, as­sistant vice president of student af­fairs, for allowing freshmen to bring their cars on campus. The Council also distributes newsletters written by Emil Hofman, dean offreshman. 
The t-shirts, designed by David 
Simon of Fisher Hall, will be

"There's no doubt about it," Phelps admits, "We need the student body for this one. Time is running out for all of those seniors. After Dayton, it's all over. 
"I hope we can at least get the cheerleaders to show up for this one." 
Time and again this season, Phelps has made it clear that there ar.e no longer any easy games in college basketball. But even though he seems to wear the point out, time and again he has been proven right. 
"People took teams like Hofstra, Fordham, LaSalle, and Fairfield for granted," he says. "The team tried to avoid looking ahead, but we weren't always successful. 
"I just can't stress enough how much a good crowd means to us at every game -not just the Indiana's and the UCLA's." 
Tonight the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community gets its next-to­last look at the 1980-8I version of the Fighting Irish basketball team. 
After tonight, the Saint Francis game will be forgotten and gone. Af­ter Saturday, Kelly Tripucka, Or­lando Woolridge, .Tracy Jackson, Gilbert Salinas, and Stan Wilcox will be done with the home season and gone. 
But for Saint Francis, tonight's game could last forever. 
If the Red Flash catch Notre Dame's basketball team and student body off guard, it might.

Both candidates agree that the need for a usable student center is a top priority in improving social life. They also advocate more hall input into party policies and increased in­volvement of the student govern­ment in University building plans. 
Their campaign proposes student services such as an optional laundry service with more coin operated machines and a tool rental service for room improvements. They also intend to increase representation from students living off campus. 
Borchers and Canino believe that to accomplish their goals they must show the Administration a persist­ent approach. "If we keep ringing their phones and knocking on their doors, sooner or later they will dis­cuss the issues with us and come to a compromise."

Trust -Elvis Costello (Columbia) 
T a~t year, F.lvis Costello released forty songs on two 
Lsmglc albums -twenty each on Get Happy!! and 
TakinR Liberties. The songs on the former were good, but their brevity made them st·em like appetizers, tasty hut not satisfying; and after twenty, who could remem­
ber what each tasted like? The latter was a compilation ofcollector's items ( B-sidcs ofsingles, imports, etc.); as a result, it suffered from a lack ofcontinuity and a dearth ofquality material as well as an overabundance ofsongs. This year's model, Trust, has none ofthese flaws. It of­fers fourteen brand-new Costello tunes, superb hacking hy The Attractions, and impeccable production by Nick Lowe. 
Trust docs not have the intense energy ofGet Hap­py!! with the exception of"l.uxembourg" and "l.over's Walk." This record has a more laid-back feel and greater listenability. The ballads, such as "Watch Your Step" and "New Lace Sleeves," are the strength of the album, not its weakness. Costello's voice sounds smoother on the ballads; this enables the listener to m~rc easily decipher his witty lyrics. Some lines jump out and beg for attention -"good manners and bad breath get you nowhere" from "New Lace Sleeves" is a good example -but usually concentration is needed ifone wants to figure out what he's singing about. However, that's half the fun. 
Side one rocks harder, but side two is Elvis at his mel­low best. Anyone who particularly liked"Alison" (from My Aim Is True) will fall in love with it. In one of my favorites, the countryish "Different Finger," Costello adds an ironic touch by using his most sincere tone of voice to sing these lines: "I don't want to hear your whole life story/ Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame/All I want is one night ofglory/! don't even know your second name." Another highlight of this side (and the album, for that matter) is "From a Whisper to a Scream," which features Chris Difford of Squeeze (another British band)duetting with Elvis. Add the poignant "Shot With His Own Gun," "Big Sister's Clothes," and the wife-beating talc of"White Knuckles," plus the excellent sequencing ofsongs, and I'd have to rate this side the better ofthe two. 
There arc no throwaway cuts on Trust. Although not every song could be a hit single, they all work well wit­hin the context of the album. The expression "the whole is greater than the sum ofits parts" certainly applies to this record. It is never an easy task to write an album's worth ofsongs that are neither so similar as to he monotonous nor too diversified as to seem dis­jointed. With Trust, Costello has succeeded in deliver­ingfourteen songs that have variety and continuity, and the performance and production arc equally laudable. 
The only negative aspects ofthis album arc a lack ofa lyric sheet (some words are impossible to comprehend no matter how hard one tries) and a lack ofdanceable tunes (you can't pogo to it). 
Trust is Costello's best record sinceArmed Forces, and I feel it is even better. Every Elvis Costello fan will want it, and for anyone who has never heard any ofhis 

albums, this will be a good place to start. So take the liberty ofgetting Trust, and get happy!!

Quiz XIV: Re-releases 
L
ast week'~ ~uiz was relatively easy. Since most group reunions arc well-pubhc1zed, most of those last week should have bct·n fairly straightforward. As usual, the answers arc found below this week's quiz. 
An interesting phenomenon of rock is the reissue hit. They don't happen very often, but when they do, few people realize it. That is be­cause most re-releases failed the first time around, or were successful in one part ofthe country alone. A good example ofthis is "She's Gone" by Daryl Hall andJohn Oates. Originally re!cased on 45 RPM in 1974, it became a big hit in Philadelphia, but did not get close to the top 40. After Hall and Oates went to RCA in 1976, and hit with "Sara Smile," Atlantic (their old label) reissued the 1974 flop, and it made the top ten. 
Occasionally, a big hit will find its way back ontn the charts. The big­gest case ofthis was Chubby Checker's "The Twist," which hit num­ber one in 1960, and upon reissue in 1961, hit the top again early in 1962. A more recent case which you may remember is "Monster Mash" by Bobby "Boris" Pickett. That record hit number one in 1962, then was rc-released in 1973 and peaked at number ten. These arc the only two reissues to make the top ten twice since 1955. Other big hits to re-enter the top 40 over the years arc "Surfin' USA" by the Beach Boys ( 1963, 1974); "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley and the Comets ( 1955, 1974); and"Wipe Out" by the Surfaris ( 1963, 1966). But this kind ofreissue is the exception rather than the rule. 
This week's quiz deals with the more common case -the original flop which became a reissue success. Here arc ten questions dealing with those strange creatures ofrock history. Unless otherwise noted, name title and artist ofthc songs. 
1. 
This single was originally released on 45 in 1967 and went nowhere on the charts. After a popular disc jockey started to use it as the closing song of his radio show, it started to gain momentum. A nationwide reissue in the summer of 1972 led to a number two ranking for the record, the biggest ever for the group involved. The composer of the song used the pseudonym "Redwavc." 

2. 
Here is a rare occurrence in rock history. This single, cut from its album version to less than three minutes' playing time, failed in 1971; when reissued a year later, in its full seven-minute, ten-second ver­sion, it became a top ten hit. 

3. 
This song was buried on a then-obscure first album by a then­obscure black singer in 1969. Three years later, the song was used in the forgettable movie Play Misty for Me. However, it gained some at­tention; three years after its original release, it soared to number one, ended up the number one song ofthe year, and launched a successful career for the singer involved. 

4. 
This record was originally released in 1946, but no one would play it because it was too risque. Twenty-nine years later, thanks to an oft-repeated commercial for a Dr. Demento radio show on WNBC in New York, it became a number one hit there, and, eventually, a top 40 hit nationwide. 

5. 
When the Beatles hit it big in America early in 1964, there were literally dozens ofBeatles songs on the charts. Surprisingly, ofall those that made the top ten, only two ofthem had been previously released in America on 45 RPM. Name them. 

6. 
This record developed impressive airplay figures in the band's hometown, Chicago, in 1972, but could not crack the upper reaches ofthe charts. In 1975, a reissue of this song (after more impressive airplay figures on WLS ofChicago) made it as high as number six. Today the group is one ofthe most popular in America. 

7. 
Asong which has since become a country-rock classic was a regional hit in 1972 and a top 40 reissue in 1975, just as in question six. However, the story ends differently; this band went through many personnel changes, and could not crack the top 40 again until the sum­merof1980.

This record was released in 1959 and was on the way to becom­ing the biggest hit ever for a then-unknown country singer. Then, just as his song was starting to break, he had the misfortune oflanding in jail. Radio stations would not play his record, and it died a premature death. In 1975, he returned to the music scene with a vengeance. His first release in that year became a number one pop and country hit. The followup made the pop top ten. The followup was a re-recorded version ofthe same song that had almost made it for him sixteen years earlier. 

9. 
Two performers in rock history have had two re-issues, each of which made the top ten. One, previously mentioned, is the Beatles. Can you name the other, plus their two top ten reissues? 

10. 
In the spring of 1976, this record peaked at number 100 on the Billboard Hot I 00. A year later, after the group responsible had a number one single, this was rc-released and made the top 40. Both this song and the number one hit preceding it were written by the same person, ,who was not a member ofthe group.

Future events to be held will be the freshmen formal and the movie "Heaven Can Wait." 
The formal will be held on April 1 1 at an undetermined site on campus. The on-campus location will make the formal accessible to all the freshmen, Thompson said. He blamed last year's poor turnout on the off-campus location. 
All profits from the March 6-7 showings of"Heaven Can Wait" will be turned over to the Council treasury to help sponsor the formal. 
Thompson hopes that the fresh­man class will participate more for the re·mainder of the Council's events. "The key for the remainder nf the year will be class input."

frustration and pain caused by bench-splinters and wondering if he'd ever get his chance. 
"I know what those guys are going 
through," admits Woolridge. "It's 
tough coming from high school 
where you're all-everything to 
Notre Dame where you gotta serve 
your time. Hey, I've played against 
all four of these guys in practice and at the Rock and I know how good they are. They're gonna · be great players at Notre Dame, believe me." 
And Woolridge isn't an exception. Fans remember how they booed a freshman named Toby Knight and laughed at a rookie' named Hanzlik. Both players worked harder and got better and now they laugh all the way to the bank with their fat NBA paychecks.

Irish hockey team 
Loganbelievesin icers 
By TIM LARKIN 
Sports Writer 
The Notrt· Dame h<Kkey team was 
not eliminated from the fight for the 
final WCHA playoff spot despite 
being swept by Colorado College 
)a<;t weekend, and right winger Jeff 
Logan still believes the Irish can ad­
vance to postseason play. 
"We knew it was going down to 
the la<;t weekend," says Logan. "I'm 
pretty optimistic that we're going to 
make the playoffs. We have to win at 
least one against Wisconsin." 
For Logan and the Irish, beating 
second place Wisconsin will be no 
easy ta<;k. Notre Dame had an excel­
lent opportunity to gain ground in 
the playoff race against Colorado 
College, hut failed in 4-3 and S-2 
losses. 
"To he optimistic, I'll say we 
played very .emotional, which is 
~om<:thing we haven't done in a long 
time," rtplies Logan when asked to 
comment on the Colorado series. 
"And everyone gave I00 percent. 
"Friday night we ran into a hot goalie and on Saturday night, I hate to say it, hut the referees had a big impact on the game." The series left the Fighting Irish with a 8-17-1 it'ague record and 12-20-2 overall. "We've had <lur share of problems this year. The key players that we thought were going to come through haven't, especially the up­pt·r dassmen. llowevt·r, lately they have bt·en supplying the leader­ship," says Logan about the tt·am's lat·k ofsuccess. 
Logan is a native bf Grosse Pointe Shores, Mkh., and first startt·d playing h<Kkey when he was t1ve years old. As he grew older, he developed a strong interest and fur­ther~·d his game. 
Logan split his playing time be­tween the junior kagues and high school. In his one year of junior hockey, Logan it'd his league in goals. He then played for University Liggelt High School a<; a senior. That year, he set team records with 52 goals for the season and nine points in one game, and also added 51 as­sists. 
Logan decided to attend Notre Dame becaust· he wanted a school that had more than just a hockey team. "I didn't want to put all my eggs in one basket," says Logan. "I wanted something to fall back on." 
Logan was a rtgular forward when he was a freshman. During his initial season, he· collected I 4 goals and added 16 assists. In the following sea<;on, his statistks were similiar as he tallled I 7 goals and 14 assists, despite missing six games with stomach muscle prohll'ms. 
During his sophomore year, 
Logan had his greatest weekend. In a 
two-game series with Michigan 
Tech, he scorl·d hat tricks on both 
nights, whi(.·h carnc:l.l him lhe WCHA 
Player ofthl· Week honor. 
"I didn't think I played that well. It 
just happem·d that evcrytime I shot 
the puck it went in," says Logan. 
This year Logan has been one of Notre Dame's top performers. After 34 games, ht· ll'ads the Irish in goals scored with 21 and total points with playing for Notre Dame is the 
39. To add to his offensive skills, players on the team. "I've never Logan has rarely put the Irish in been on a team that has been so short-handed situations as close," says Loga111 "We do every­evidenced by his 18 penalty minutes thing together and there isn't any in 1980-81. animosity between us." 
Logan wasn't satisfied with his Jeff Logan, an economics major, play earlier this year. He felt he wao; isn't certain of his plans after gradua­only playing well only about halfthe tion. He still has a great desire lo play time. However, Logan thinks now he hockey after he leaves Notre Dame is playing his best hockey. and also has a strong interest in

And this year's class of diamonds in the rough may find their niches sooner than most. Phelps will say good bye to five seniors at the end of the season and one has to believe that these freshmen fit heavily into next year's plans. 
"They definitely do," emphasizes McLaughlin. "Our system here is tough to learn but we think the freshmen have it down now so next year they're going to be in a position to help us."

Dawning of a new era 
The dawningofa new era sounds a little dramatic, but that's the way a couple ofcoaches are talking about the future of the Notre Dame track and cross country programs. 
Head CoachJoe Piane and his one and only assistant, Ed Kelly, began working together six years ago. Since then Notre Dame has had four all-Americans and a steady improvement in won-l,ost reords. More impor­tantly, the caliber of the entire team has reached the point where it can be considered in the same breath with teams like Indiana and Michigan. Why? 
Work. Work and a better attitude, says Piane. 
"When Ed and I came here you wouldn't have , believed how bad the attitude was," he recalls. :'Everything was negatve. Ed works his tail off and I work pretty hard and the kids see that. lfyou're down at Corby's drinking beers not really caring the kids sense that and say, 'why should we work if he isn't?' We've· done an adequete job ofrecruiting, but we'll have to do better-that's the key." 
So the question is: What's new? Why should things 
start to improve? There is the fact that Van Pearcy, a 9.6 
100-yard dash and 46.8 440-yard sprint man will be 
here next year. But in the past, football players at Notre 
Dame have not readily participated in other sports. 
"Van Pearcy would not be at Notre Dame ifit weren't for Gerry Faust," says Piane. "Gerry Faust has given him a guaraptee that he doesn't have to participate in spring ball. For him (Van Pearcy) track was as important as football. If would have said, 'No, we don't want you in 
track', he wouldn't be coming here. 

"Faust sees that there is value in track, not just for sprinters, but for everyone. He goes out and encourages them. Greg Bell is a freshman (and a football player)and is doing an excellent job. Rob McGarry is another ex­ample." 
''The difference is that previously, the kids weren't as encouraged as they are by Faust. Now, Gerry is saying, 'Yeah, I think it's a great idea. It's good for football, it's good for the program.'" 
This .year's team is the best Piane has fielded since taking over in 1975. Piane, a Peace Corps veteran, is a quiet, self-motivated man and his personality, as it does for all coaches, affects his coaching style. 
"I'm not about to give great fire and brimstone speeches and great pep talks," Piane emphasizes. "I simply can't do that. It's just not me, it's not in me to do that. 
"Track is so much different from most sports. In foot­
ball, you get motivated by hitting someone. In track you 
go out and perform yourself. I think you gravitate 
Sports Writer 

toward the sport that matches.your personality. I enjoy . it because it is so individual. 
"In football your success or failure is contingent upon ten other guys. In track, you can only blame it on yourself. It's all up to you. Also in sports like football, wrestling, or tennis your up against an adversary who is preventing you from your activity. In track, your success or failure is c_ontingent upon you 95 per cent of the time. !like that. 
''I've never had any problems with motivation. Most track kids are pretty self-motivated. The kids we get are really motivated. Ifyou don't want to run, then fine, hit the road. Because for Ed and I this is the most important sport, and that's the way most ofthe kids feel too." 
Piane, the only coach at Notre Dame directing teams in. the fall, winter and spJ;ing seasons has one assistant, Ed Kelly, who is, officially, a part time coach. Kelly teaches at Niles High School and was an outstanding pole vaulter for Notre Dame in tht~ mid-1960's. 
"He is supposed to be part time, but he works full time, all the time," Piane says. "He is the most dedicated coach on campus, bar none. I'll put him up against anybody. I have never seen a coach with more concern for his athletes than Ed Kelly. 
"Today the future looks bright. I think that (Athletic Director) Gene Corrigan is going to push the program. 
. That's my impression. And Gerry Faust is going to help us. I think the track program is going to improve. We're about five class athletes from being one of the top twenty teams in th~ nation." 
Notre Dame has class athletes right now, most notab­ly Chuck Aragon, who may soon achieve the 'Bannisterean' feat ofbreaking the four minute mile. But beinga national contender means more than one or two great runners and a great relay team. Consistency throughout each part ofthe team, as in all sports, is the key. 
A new era may in fact be dawning which could add another national championship to Notre Dame's list. Corrigan, Faust, luck, the student body, and mostly Piane and Kelly will decide ifthe sun will come up.

Certainly there is -evidence to back up McLaughlin's prediction that the freshmen's time will come.

Theirs arc not names the average fan would immediately recognize whenever the subject of Notre Dame basketball arises. They do not receive the playing time, score the points or sign the autographs that a Tripucka or Paxson docs. In fact, against tough opponents in those "big games," they usually don't bot­her to take off their warmups. 
"They" are this year's freshmen ­Joe Kleine, Cecil Rucker, Tom Sluhy and Barry Spencer-and all ofthem have quickly, maybe even painfully, learned that it takes time to crack the lineup ofa major college basket­ball team. 
Discouraging? Perhaps. But Dig­ger Phelps has nothing short of total confidence in his rookie quartet. 
"Those guys have been super for us all year," he points out. "They help us in areas that may not always show up on television or in a boxscore, hut the coaches and players are aware of their contribu­tion." 
Assistant coach Tom McLaughlin elaborates: 
"The freshmen help us get ready for a big game, and in that respect they an: as much a part ofa win like Virginia as the guys who played. Ask 
John Paxson. He'll tell you that playing against Barry Spent·er in practice all wt:ek helped him get ready to guard Jeff Lamp. Or ask Or­lando Woolridge. Working against Joe Kleine before Virginia preparl·d him to play against Ralph Sampson." But Mclaughlin doesn't stop 
thl·re. 

"I can say that those guys arl· a big n·ason why we won the Virginia ganll·," hl· concludes. "No, morl· than that, they are thl· n·ason wl·'re having the kind of Sl'ason Wl''n· having so far. Sure it's tough to sit on the hl·nch. But thdr time willcontl'.

Fans turn on ND for visitors 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 
A year ago Tuesday, the United States hockey team won the Olympic gold medal by defeating Finland 4-2. 
A year ago Sunday, the Olympians defeated the Russian team 4-3. 
For those two weeks in February, this country was united. The group of players who were part ofthe "Miracle on Ice" were a common focal point to which we all turned for some happiness. 
We saw the same thing a month ago, when 52 Americans were released by their Iranian captors. And we saw the same thing on Sunday, when this campus united for a very big contest with the top-ranked Virginia Cavaliers. 
This campus always gets up for big games. There is no equal to a Notre Dame-UCLA showdown at the ACC. Nor is there an equal to what happened Sunday in the Rosemont Horizon. That type of fan support is what this campus is noted for. But it is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. 
Take last Monday, for instance. I was sitting quietly in my seat in Section Three, enjoying what was a surprisingly close game between Notre Dame and Fairfield. 
Sitting next to me was a guy wearing a "Notre Dame Fightin' Irish" jersey and cheering rather boisterously for Fairfield. I didn't think too much ofit at the time. I figured this was some guy who, for some reason, made the journey from Fairfield, Conn. to South Bend, Ind. to watch his team play the Irish, and, while here, paid a visit to the infamous Notre Dame Bookstore. 
Then I noticed the guy sitting next to him. He was wearing a green and gold Alumni Hall t-shirt, and cheering just as loudly for Fairfield. The reason­ing I had used to explain why the first guy was cheering for Fairfield wasn't valid for this second guy -they don't sell Alumni Hall t-shirts in the Bookstore. Now, I sensed the mutiny. 
Recently, it seems that more and more people have begun to write about the state of the Notre Dame fan. In the Fairfield write-up in last Tuesday's Chicago Tribune, BillJauss commented that Notre Dame students apparent­ly only get up for the UCLA's, the DePaul's and the Virginia's now-a-days. He's a little late in realizing that -things have been that way in all the years I've been here. That's not really important, however. With the schedule we play, the TEAM can't even be expected to get up for the Fairfield's, the Boston's and the Saint Mary's ofCalifornia's. 
There is, however, a definite problem when your fans start cheering for the OTHER team. Why was this happening? I mean, by game's end, 50-60 percent of the student body in attendance was rooting for Fairfield. Why? 
Some expressed negative feelings toward Digger and his coaching philosophies. Some said we played so horribly that we didn't deserve to win. Some said they simply wanted to see a close ball game. (I stopped believing this last excuse when I saw people walking out ofthe ACC genuinely disap­pointed that the Stags missed their last chance to tie.) 
I have no legitimate excuses for the reaction of the student body. Their actions cannot be justified. I can conceive not going to the game. The academic pressures ofthis university, coupled with the lack ofquality teams on this season's home schedule, make that a believeable excuse. 
I can also accept attending the game, but not taking an active role in the 
cheering. As stated before, it is impossible for the team, as well as the fans, to 
be up for every game. 
But I can in no way justify this "rooting for the other team" business. If 
people are going to do that, then why bother attending the game in the first 
place? 
There's no question Notre Dame fans are spoiled. They're too used to 
winning. After sitting through that Monday night's game, I now also believe 
that Notre Dame fans are hypocrites. Sure, they root like crazy before nation­
al TV audiences, trying to live up to the MVP award they received from NBC 
three years ago. But then they turn around and do things like this. 
Two weeks ago, my 16-year-old cousin attended the UCLA game. She left that weekend, anxious to get home and tell everyone about the "Notre Dame spirit." 
"I c.ouldn't believe that place," she told me after the game. "It was so loud. You guys sure got lots a spirit." I'm glad she wasn't in the audience Monday night. I wouldn't want to ruin her impression of this place. 
It's a good thing the Fairfield game wasn't on national television either. That would have meant that fans all over the country would have found out what Notre Dame fans are really like. 
Another of those "just give me the win" teams comes into the ACC tonight. I would hope that the kind ofthing that happened last Monday won't happen again tonight. And just to make sure it doesn't, I'll let those few ofyou who are planning to make the trip over to the ACC in on a little secret: Notre Dame will be the team wearing white. 
The 16-8 record that the Red Flash .brings into tonight's contest puts them in the thick of the race in their conference, the ECAC South. They are currently in second place behind Old Dominion, the team that upset DePaul. 
"Last Saturday, they upset Cleveland State, a probable tourna­ment team," says Phelps. "They get up for the big games -and that worries me. 
"Saint Francis is the kind of team that always plays tough. They never get blown out of a game, and those teams bother me." 
Senior center Jim Schoen (6-9, 230 pounds) leads a team that returns five starters from last season. The leading rebounder in the East last year, Schoen is pulling balls off the glass at a rate of 11 per game this year. 
·· Point guard Bob Convey will run the offensive show for the Red Flash. The six-foot guard is the team's leading scorer, averaging just under 1 5 points a game. 
Two more seniors will work in the 
front court for third-year coach 
Dave Magarity. Charlie Kates and 
Bob Powell are consistent scorers 
and good shooters. Combined, they 
average 24 points and over 14 
rebounds in every Saint Francis 
game. 
The only junior among the start· 
ing five, swingman Anthony Wash­

ington, utilizes a good outside shot · 
to average nearly 11 points per 
game. 
"Saint Francis is a good scoring 
team," says Phelps. "They have five 
players who score consistently in 
double-figures, so you have to con­
centrate on playing good defense 
against all of them. They can all put 
the ball in the hoop." 
Kates and Schoen became l ,000

Jenny Klauke 

The savior is here 
At first glance, Jenny Klauke hardly looks like a bas­ketball savior. Standing 5-9 1/2, she doesn't tower above her teammates on the Notre Dame women's bas­ketball squad. 
But when the Irish decided to leapfrog from AlAW Division III to Division I in a single season, and lured one of the top coaches in the nation to Notre Dame, somebody had to be the knight on the white horse. And as one of the first two women ever to receive athletic grants-in-aid at Notre Dame, Klauke was a prime suspect. 
When teammate MaryJoan Forbes, the other scholar­ship athlete, dislocated her knee before the season opened, the burden fell squarely on Klauke. 
It wasn't quite the Second Coming. 
Whether or not she could walk on water wasn't the issue -the hardwood of the basketball court posed enough ofa challenge. Klauke passed when she should have shot, shot when she should have passed, and in general resembled a business major trying to pass a mechanics exam. 
She got about the same results. After opening the season alongside Maggie Lally in the starting backcourt, Klauke soon found herself occupying the best seat in the house at tip-off. 
Her wide-open, freewheeling style of play only confused her teammates and frus .trated her coaches. More often than not, when she tried to put the ball be­hind her back, it wound up behind the third row. Watching Klauke operate in the midst of Notre Dame coach Mary DiStanislao's structured offense was akin to listening to Springsteen played on a tuba. 
A Christmas bout with tonsilitis did little to speed her 
adjustment to the system, and when Klauke did return 
to the lineup, it was at a different position. When Coach 
Mary DiStanislao's frontline was decimated, she moved 
her savior to forward. 

At first, any change was barely noticeable. Klauke still seem.ed to think that a one-on-four fastbreak was a good scoring opportunity, much to the chagrin of DiStanis­

lao. Defense was still something other people did. 
Thank God for Goshen. 
The Maple Leafs, a non-descript Division III school, 
happened to wander into the Athletic and Convocation Center just after South Carolina blew out with its 124­48 prize. Goshen staggered out of the ACC with an 86­44 loss, and 22 ofthose points toJenny Klauke. 
Goshen is hardly among the nation's elite in women's basketball, but it had taken Klauke a long time to learn that you have to walk before you can run. The Maple Leafs happened to remind her just how fast she could run. 
Since then, Klauke has run through some pretty fair 
opposition. In its last four games, Notre Dame has lost to 
Ball State, St.Joseph's, Michigan and Virginia. Klauke has 
been the leading Irish scorer in each of those games, 
averaging 20.5 points and 7.5 rebounds while playing 
just under 25 minutes per contest. 
"Jenny has begun to play up to her capabilities," says 
DiStanislao. "At the beginning ofthe season, people had 
very high expectations of her. as if she could come in 
and turn the program around by herself. As a result, she 
tried to do too many things. Now, though, she's playing 
intelligently, and the results have been fantastic." 
Probably the most encouraging aspect of Klauke's surge is that her strong play has come against top-notch competition, not Division II and III patsies. 
As Notre Dame's 9-13 record attests, Jenny Klauke 
isn't ready to walk on water. But nobody has to throw 
her a life preserver, either.
