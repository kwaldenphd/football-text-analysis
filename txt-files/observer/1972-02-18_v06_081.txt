Vol. VI, No. 81 February 18, 1972 
Higgins, Seyn1our declare bloc 
by T.C. Treanor Observer Assistant Editor 
Notre Dame Hall Life Commissioner Bob Higgins 
and St. Mary's Student Affairs Commissioner Jean 
Seymour last night announced their joint can­
didacies for the offices of Notre Dame and St. 
Mary's Student bodies respectively. 
Higgins, a former Badin Hall Vice-President, will 
run with former Alumni Hall President Ron Pgge. 
Seymour's running mate will be Sue Welte, St. 
Mary's Judicial Board Coordinator. 
Under current election rules, ·the Higgins­
Seymour partnership is not legally binding. Each 
candidate will run on his own campus in separate 
elections. 
In a statement of joint candidacy Miss Seymour 
read to supporters and press at their Alumni Hall 
headquarters, the pair condended that "The unity 
we need to face next year's crucial issues must 
begin with the unity of our student bodies. Our joint 
candidacy is established on this basis." 
According to Higgins, both candidates are 
"committed to a merged student government," no matterwho wins. However, he cited last year's election, in which Kathy Barlow won at St. Mary's but her Notre Dame counterpart, Don Mooney, lost and said that, "it would be more difficult" to merge 
if a similar thing happened this year. 
"One of the most glaring weaknesses of this 
year's student governments was their inability to 
work together," Higgins and Seymour contended in 
their joint statement. "We can and we will. 
Structurally we will merge all positions in which 
duplicity is not necessary in order to deal with the 
two administrations." 
Although neither candidate would cite positions 
headed for merger, Higgins did forsee some other 
structural changes in student government_ Ac­
cording to the Hall Life Commissioner, his ad­
ministration would press for at-large positions on 
the Student Life Council for Notre Dame women and 
Freshmen. To do this he would have only one SLC 
member electd from the North and South quads. 
Currently the SLC elects two from each. 
The pair also sounded an optimistic note about the 
potential merger of the two schools. 
''Together we will push the administrations 
toward merger," Miss Seymour said, "An im­
portant part of this push will be student and faculty 
representation on all negotiating teams. Only when 
we pierce the inner sanctums of the decision-
Pogge, Welte, Higgins, Seymour: announced ioint candidacy last night 
making process can we gain the information necessary for effective utilization of studnet power.'' 
The pair promised to "work to extend our student power base" by forming a "faculty -student coalition." 
"By use of our representation of the faculty Senate and SLC," Higgins said, "we will seek to develop and extend the kind of cooperation that exists between students and faculty at St. Mary's." 
"Effective student power," Miss Seymour said, "which comes only when students unite to achieve a common objective, has never reached its potential here. We cannot promise to develop effective student power, for that can only come from an aroused student body. However, we can promise the vocal and productive leadership that will facilitate such a development." 
The pair pleged to "use our influence in the University Governmental structures to its limits." The also pledged to improve "communication" between students and student government. 
"If we succeed," the statement siad, "we will tell the students why. If we fail, the students will also know why. This sort of communication has been lacking in past student governments." 
"If the students think our goals are worthwhile and want to become involved, then we can develop effective student power. If not, we will continue to use our influence to its limits, and we will inform the students of every development." 


Higgins pledged to "double" last year's $10,000.00 Hall Life Committee fund. The Hall Life Com­missioner said that he was "confident that this(the doubling> could be done." 
Seymour suggested that a similar fund be set up at St. Mary's. "The fund can be instituted through the allocation of the surplus in the student govern­ment budget," Miss Seymour contended. 
Higgins turned down SBP Candidate's Chuck Luken's offer to debate the issues. "Thereare four candidates in the race already," he said, "and two or three will announce soon." According to the Hall Life Commissioner, such a debate would be "un­wieldly.'' 
Higgins, a 20-year-old Junior from the Chicago area, majors in government. He won election as Badin Hall Vice-President as a Freshman in 1970 and was re-elected without an opponent last year: He did not stand for re-election this year. 
Seymour won election as Student Affairs Com­missioner in February of last year. She is a Philosophy major and a Junior from Pittsburgh. 
Pogge, a junior from Council Bluffs, Iowa, is a General Program Major. He was elected Hall Presdient last year and surrendered the post only yesterday to Butch Ward. 
Miss Welte was Sophmore Class President and ran unsuccessfully with Jean Sheehy for Student Body Vice-President last year. She is a Sociologymajor from Pittsburgh. 

Calls for 'initiatory democracy' 
Nader-blasts bureaUcracy; praises PIRGs 
by Ed Ellis Observer Associate Editor 
Premier consumer protection advocate Ralph Nader last night called for development of "initiatory democracy," saying that the only solution of the problem of irresponsible corporate behavior was to provide the victims-the public--with legal power to fight their oppressors. 
In a two-hour speech before a crowd of 2000 in Stepan Center, Nader said that the growing perception level of people around the country had led to the recognition of a legal right for citizens to be protected from pollution and other manifestations of corporate irresponsibility. 
Nader praised the Public Interest Research Groups, such as In PRIG, petitioning at Notre Dame this week, saying that those groups were exploding certain myths and stereotypes about college students. He said the student movements of the late 1960's led to the improvement of the perception level of the general public, and that this was vital in the reassertion of the principles of democracy. 
Nader began his speech with an analysis of the economic system in America today. "Economic wealth does not solve problems," he said, "it ignores them and is creating new ones." 
He ~listed poverty, housing shortage, mass transit difficulties, medical care problems, and several others as problems that the traditional success criteria do not involve or aid. Pollution, he said, increases faster than economic growth. Noise and related psychological problems are never touched by the growth of the American Gross National Product. 
Nader said that the psychological problems of both blue and white-collar workers were greater than the statistical growth of the U.S. economy. 
"We ought to take all the economics textbooks and slowly disintegrate them," he said. "We need to take a combined quantitative and qualitiative analysis of this economy.'' 
He then examined the nature and con­sequences of bureaucracy, contending that bureaucracy led to a "fluid paralysis of mind," in which people were insulated from accepting personal responsibility for anything. Nader said that red tape often impedes teh information flow between te people, the government and corporate decision-makers. 
Too many bureaucrats, Nader argued, justify their actions on the grounds that

-wader _hits ~uto industry -again at press conference 

b~· Maria Gallagher 
At a press conference following his Stepan Center address. Ralph Nader outlined points he felt were of primary concern to the consumer, and discussed accomplishments of his crusade. 
Nader began by listing areas that he believed needed im­mediate research and action. These were the food and auto industies pollution, housing, and governmental pr.ocesses which are immune to public suggestion. 
Nader then explained the advantages of PIRGs, or student operated-campus based research teams. 
''Working in PIRGs will not only enrich their education, but also teach them the priceless techniques of citizen action which will later prove invaluable to the bringing about of a more responsive government." He 
encourage other group­s<especially retired citizens) to initate action. 
Workers may earn academic credit for research in their respective areas, he added. Nader added that so afar PIRGs have taken root in 10 states and he hopes eventually to extend them to all 50. 
''The auto industry has definitely become more responsive. More cars are being recalled, and the recommended safety features have become standard on practically all models." 
However, Nader emphasized that the auto industry must still go far in order to insure adequate passenger protection. He hailed the development of the collap­sable steering column and air bag as "tremendous steps for­ward, although the industries may not agree," and cited an automatic collision avoidance device as the ultimate safety goal of the industry. Such devices, 
Law School to sponsor lecture by Ear1 Warren 
Earl Warren, former chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, will speak here April 4, 5, and 6 as the first speaker in a new major lecture series sponsored by the Notre Dame Law School. 
The series will be an annual event, featuring speakers from government and other fields. Efforts will be made to obtain well-known persons rather than professors from other univer­sities. 
The role of the courts and other government agencies in civil rights, and projections for the future will be the topic discussed this year, according to Law Professor Francis Beytagh, who chairs the series. 
Since leaving the court, the SO­year-old Warren has made few public appearances but agreed to open the series· here because of his personal admiration for the accomplishments of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and its chairman university President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh. Besides the night-time addresses, Warre_!l__will be available during

Nader: auto industry more 
responsive 
Nader said, are already used in 
space. and he expects their in­
stallation in passenger cars by 
the early 1980's. 
"When this reaches the general 
public, it'll be the greatest life­
saving feature instituted in this 
century." 
Nader concluded questionmg 
on the auto industry by conceding 
that the new warranty attached 
American Motors cars is "a step 
in the right direction, as long as it 
fulfills its promises." 
The mobile home industry was 
next hit by Nader. "It's a 
booming business, but the 
number of complaints of shoddy 
construction are increasing as 
well." He said that a research 
team was presently working on 
the problems, and that a report 
would be forthcoming in the near 
future. 
On the subject of nursing 
homes, Nader credited the 
results of his fact-finding teams 
for the institution and passage of 
the Nixon administration's 
recent reforms in that area. 
In conclusion, Nader said he 
felt that the average consumer 
was not passive, but really 
concerned about the quality of his . world. 
"The average consumer will wake up and respond when he feels he is being jeopardized," !';ader said. "The industries must be made aware of just whom they are serving. Industries can be t£'rmed responsive only so far as they are open to study and eriticism."

"Blow the whistle," the man said. Bureaucratic American institutions have become criminally insensitive to their collective public respon­sibility, criminally insensitive to the long range risks of the products they develop, criminally insensitive to the fraud they perpetuate by habit, and criminally insensitive to the individual ethics of the people they employ. Ralph Nader was here last night. In his loose, flippant style he reminded us that a thoroughly organized, knowledgeable and dedicated man can penetrate the insensitivity. But, he added firmly, "Bureaucracy will not be responsible until it becomes individually responsible." 
Even if prosecuting the presidents of three-fourths of Fortune's top 500 companies would go a long way towards forcing the issue of corporate responsibility, the major burden of re-establishing the publicinterest still clearly lies with us. It is the individual fully excercising his expanded legal rights(e.g. citizen anti-pollution suits) that will bring the system back into balance. 
Nader offered many concrete examples. The greatest challenge he suggested was making the University deal substantively with con­temporary social problems. 
No college curriculum offers auto safety engineering as a con­centration, nor are food additives, behavioral modifica ton effects of advertising and a whole host of other areas where the enthusiasm of college students and the expertise of social and natural science faculties could be used. These are areas of concern for students. 
These suggestions deserve further consideration. Nader is not ad­vocating the classical approach that might be found in advertising or engineering majors. He is suggesting a problem-oriented approach to real problems that would allow students as undergraduates to combine disciplines to investigate the GM or Lockheed, or FDA of their choice. 
We believe that his ideas must be discussed more thoroughly. The Senior Fellow Program offers a perfect opportunity--seniors should nominate and select Ralph Nader. They could then ask him to discuss specific curriculum additions and revisions which would best implement his ideas.

spnng tratntng: 


The acknowledged favorite, chief generalissimo, and head honcho of hall life is officially in the race, and we can now see precisely how the campaigns are jelling. At least three other people will mount cam­paigns for ND SBP, and their are at least two others as yet -unan­nounced pretenders to the SMC throne. But for purposes of analysis, the picture over here looks complete -the three candidates yet to announce may fool around with percentages; will probably throw things into a runoff; but of themsleves will not present serious sustained drives. 
Let's take a look at the four candidates-alphabetically, of course: 
Paul Dziedzic has a foot in both the Mooney and Barkett camps-and he may not get support from either. Barkett will support him in event of a runoff with Kezele, but as long as both he and Higgins are in the race, Barkett will keep scrupulously mum. 
Dziedzic has done two things which have shored up his organization and indicated that his candidacy is indeed serious. Late last night he picked up an endorsement from Keenan Hall President Dave Loring, who was split between him and Higgins. Loring has supported two successive losers -Tom Thrasher adn Don Mooney -but he posesses a eertain amount of dynamic persuasiveness which has won him some considerable success for himself and a sustantive amount of respect in his own hall. 
The second thing he's been able to do is to maneuver St. Ed's president Marty Seimion out of an active role in the race. Siemion will wear a Higgins button and in all ways make himself known to be a fervent supporter of the Hall Life Commissioner, but Higgins headquarters had counted on him to be a North Quad captain. Siemon's relatively minor role is the result of Dziedzic's doings. 
In turn. Dziedzic lacks a tight organization. He has more in­formation leaks than Henry Kissinger -and not just to me; to the Higgins and Kezele organizations as well. If the runoff is between Higgins and Dziedzic, he stands to pick up some ex-candidate's en­dorsements, including, as it stands now, Floyd Kezele's. 
Floyd Kf'zele is the man the Higgins people fear most now. His announcement was impressive; his contacts with the Mooney people look good. He pic~ed up an important endorsement from Bob Welley, Flanner Hall's popular president, who was torn between him and Higgins. Both he and Dziedzic live in Grace; his running mate, Milt Jones lives in Flanner and Dziedzic's running mate, Mike Sherrod lives in Grace, but Kezele has far more of a home-halladvantage. He'~ been an SLC Towers representative for two years; first time around he beat Sherrod by approximately two to one; last year he won by 289 ­
29. Dziedzic has never won an elective office at Notre Dame and has only lived in Grace for a year. 
Kezele's announcement was impressive and his organization is small but tight. He has had troubles getting hall or quad captains. 
If it's a Kezele -Higgins runoff, Kezele stands a good chance of ge~ti~g ~ll the ex-candidate's endorsements, and additionally, brmgmg m a lot of Mooney's old campaigners to say i-told-you-so at the last minute. A Kexele-Higgins runoff would likewise bring Barkett full fury into the frey -on the side of Higgins. The antipathy between Kezele and Barkett defies serious description. 
Rob Higgins is clearly the favorite, with good reason. His organization is five quantum leaps ahead of everybody else's · he has hall captains for three-quarters of the halls. He doesn't have B~rkett's direct endorsement but has picked up a large share of his organization anyway; lanky Fred Giuffrida will manage his campaign. A lot of people talked favorably of Giuffrida as an SBP candidate himself and in fact Giuffrida considered taking up the bid. 
Other important endorsements: HPC Chairman Ed Motto, Fisher Hall President Carmen Maciarello, Farley Hall President Joe Markosak. If Higgins is to be beaten, it will be because (a) he won't come across in public and (b) all his opposition-all his opposition ever 
can unite against him in the runoff. 
Chuck Luken has no campaign manager, little organization, and not an eye-bugging amount of support. The only thing he has going for him is himself-and his running mate. His announcement was the most impressive of the four; there are some things he doesn't know about student government but if he straightens himself out he may pick up 8­10 per cent of the vote. However, unless he becomes a lot more visable than he has been in the past, you can scratch him as a serious con­
t(nder. Ry Monday night we ought to have another contender at St. Mary's and twomore here. They all present their· own little bizzare twists to the story; but more on that later.

Bureaucracy, i~dustry targets in Nader speech 
(Continued from page 1) 
they were taking 
orders or simply ignore the 
responsibility, prefering to pass 
the' buck. 
He contended that 
"bureaucracy will never be 
responsible until bureaucrats are 
held personally responsible." 
This, Nader claimed happens 
only when the victims of the 
bureaucrats are represented in th 
decision-making process. 
Related to this, Nader 
discussed the subject of "on-the­
job-citizenship," saying that this 
is the best form of citizen 
representation in the government 
because it involved experienced 
people who could exert heavy
internal pressure on the of­
fending bureaucracies. 
Everyone who works for a large company or bureaucracy will at some time be faced with the decision of "when individual conscience will take precedence to allegiance to the organization," according to Nader.

Nader then charged many vital sectors of American society as being undemocratic. He cited the need for a micro-analysis of many of these areas, including corporations and large labor unions. Once the essential totalitarian control of many as~ects of American life is realized, Nader said that "initiatory democracy," the most undeveloped and the most basic form of democracy, must be used to correct the situation.

Many V.P. applicants 
by Noli Kane 
To date, seventeen people have 
applied for the Vice President of 
Student Affairs job, according to 
Fr. James McGrath, head of the 
V.P. search committee. 
But at least thirty or forty people must be screened before the committee recommends any names to Univers1ty President Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh or Provost Fr. James T. Burtchaell, he said. He refused to release any of the applicants' names. 
The committee met for the first time, Monday, to discuss ap­plicants for the post which Fr. Thomas E. Blantz will vacate this May. The committee wil recommend three to six people to the Trustees for the job "by the end of March.. .if all goes well," McGrath said. 
When asked what type of person the committee was searching for, McGrath said, " ...a strong person who can take the job as it exists now and restructure it." 
The V.P. deals with too many staff and should be "free for more face to face meetings with students."

The New St. Mar~

Shades of the Gooj 
by Ann Therese Darin 
Within the first week you will meet our neighbors, tht Notre Dame men from across the Dixie. Social life at Saint Mary's includes on-campus activities as well as N.D. pep rallies and football games, Victory Dances, and proms 
... Your social whirl will begin with a lively Freshman week and its round of get-acquainted activities... You will attend many activities at Notre Dame -concerts and plays, open house parties in the Student Center, Mardi Gras, class dances. and formals held by the different schools, such as the Science and Law Balls ... 
When there is no dance, you may see amovie or go to dinner in town. The Volcano is a favorite spot, followed by Rosie's and the Philadelphia. On a spring or fall afternoon, it is fun to walk to Roseland for a snack, or just for fresh air. There are lots of things to do on our campus to. When the weather is nice. you can go canoeing on Lake Marian. On Friday nights there are first run movies at St. Angela's. You will be able to entertain your guests in Holy Cross parlors or outside on the large and beautiful campus. 
Lake Geneva in the autumn? A swinging singles weekend in the Adirondacks? The Notre Dame in the first ex-· erpt from the Freshman Orientation Manual for the 1957 -1958 St. Mary's Freshman Class gives it away. So, this was the western campus (or has in chameleoned back to being St. Mary's College for Women?) in the 1950's. 
Saint Mary's gives us may other opportunities to develop the whole woman. Noted speakers and artists are presented in convocations throughout the year, in addition to the special programs held in O'Laughlin. Students with scholastic averages of 2.2 OR ABOVE are distinguished at the semi­annual Honors Convocation. 
Your chapel veil will be an important part of your war­drobe. It will be with you at your first Missa Recitata and Full Participation Mass, and at that last visit to the Christ Child be/ore Christmas vacation; at the Holy Hour; on First Friday; at Sunday Benediction; and most often, we hope at frequent visits to Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. These Things will contribute more than anything else, to your development into the St. Mary's ideal-the whole woman. Let your chapel veil be a symbol ofthe finest course Saint Mary's offers -"Growing Up To God." 
Nostalgia is in vogue. But, when nostalgia of St. Mary's 
past seems to be converging with the administration forecast 
for St. Mary's future ... 
Last week the St. Mary's Admissions Office, subsisting 
underground this year in their cubbyhole in the Golden 
Dome, issued what promises to be the most widely read 
campus scandal-sheet since the Park-Mayhew Nihilty. The 
booklet is entitled "Facts for Freshmen Entering September, 
1972" or perhaps a more apt title: "Everything You've Had 
Nightmares About Since Un-Merger, But Been Afraid to 
Believe." 
Produced by the Admission Department, overlorded by Sr. 
M. Raphaelita, a 50-odd year veteran in the Holy Cross or­der's battalion and for the last ten years patroling Stalag Admissions Office, the statement was censored by Sr. M. Alma. acting president. and her attache, Jason D. Lindower, director of financial management. The statement projects a 
St. Mary's College as exciting as the grotto on a rainy day, as timely as the shuttle busses this semester (especially the 
10:48 Tuesday-Thursday express from St. Mary's which has yet to make an appearance); and as informative as Sr. Alma greeting our esteemed editorial writer the -"Goodbye, Sr. Alma~" editorial. 
LC'Mans is the residence of the sophomores, juniors, and seniors and many of your clases will be held there. The dining hall and snack bar (the Oriole) are also in LeMans. 
The Chapel of Loretto, which we hope you will want to visit daily. is a replica of the house ofthe Holy Family at Nazareth and the most beloved of the seven chapels on campus. Saint Angela's is the site ofthe annual sports tournaments. 
A picture for the wall, and statues of Christ, Our Lady, or favorite saints can be rented from the art studio. Something "green and growing" adds a cheerful note. Of course these are some things which are positively essential: a clock, desk lamp and dresser scarf. Shoe bags and a drying rack will come in very handy too. 
But, then again, perhaps the "good nuns" (a term which I have yet to find the origin for) really ~id mean well and wanting to get into the spirit of President Nixon's trip to China this week, decided to take "the giant leap" (back­ward!). 
In academics, next year's freshmen class, according to the circular will be retrogressing. They will not be allowed to major in American Studies, Business Administration, Physics, Engineering, Political Science, Psychology, Ar­chitecture, German , Italian, modern languages, Black Studies, or European Studies. 
Presently there are approximately 30 SMC government majors. Without a government major, how can anyone figure out the bureaucratic map, the lobbying of the habits versus the Hobbits, the fine art of ramming through legislation restructuring the college through the amnesia­prone tri-partite committees and executive Board ofTrustees sessions who don't even remember discussing the proposals? 
Not to mention a more trivial reason: that an increasing number of SMC seniors are applying to law schools, which both want and need women. A government major is a fine launch for their plans. Or what about the Nader Raiders? How can they aid the consumer, if the college can't even teach them in political science courses the caches of American democracy to raid. 
True, there are only two faculty members in the political science department at present with filled-to-capacity or near-to-capacity classes. Will they experience the same Christian community which has axed professors, ad­ministrators, and even exiled one ex.SMC-president to South America after the present government majors have graduated'? 
Yet. the philosophy department, which is operating with no department chairman since Dr. Richard Hutchison quit last May, one or two instructors, and only four majors, is counted among the chosen. Do the Sisters have a sudden harvest of hemlocks'? Have they developed an ultra-new philosophy to form the department on "Reflection on Self" <Or how one treasurer of a religious order found peace of mind by resigning from the i7 different Boards of Trustees she sits on!)

s THE OBSERVER 

Mao's poetry published 
<c> 1972 New York Times New York, Feb. 17-Members of the Chinese mission to the United Nations received a new English translation of Chairman 
Mao Tse-Tung's poetry today, even as President Nixon's plane was leaving for their homeland, 
and they expressed the hope that the interchange of President and poetry might herald a new era for the two nations. 
The work was presented to two senior members of the mission by a poetry editor at Harper & Row, while other officials were following the President's departure on a television set in an adjoining room. 
Although several English editions of Chairman Mao's peotry have been printed, the Harper & Row book is believed to be the first bilingual edition. 
Mao's peoms, which reflect the Chinese fondness for vivid descriptions of nature, span four decades, from 1925 to 1963. The last poem is a tribute to Kuo Mo­Jo, one of China's most distinguished writers, which They buzz, moan, moon,

Pranksters: 'Keep Him' 
An unidentified source from among the ranks of the Merry Pranksters announced today that the organization was sending a telegram to Chinese Foreign Minister Chou En Lai. The telegram's message was succinct, concise, and only two words: 
"KEEP HIM" it read. It was believed that the telegram referred to this week's visit to Peking by President Nixon. 
The source from the Pranksters suggested that students also send telegrams in order to create a flood of opinion on behalf of the President's con­tinued residence in China. Telegrams can be charged to a student's campus phone billing number. The phone number for Western Union is 233-6101. Telegrams can be sent to Chou in care of the United Nations, Embassy of the People's Republic of China, New York, New York.

Schools of Engineering and Law make proiect proposals 
Proposals which could reduce 
the time between arrest and trial 
from the over 200-day average in 
two major Indiana counties to 
less than 90 days are results of an 
IS-month study conducted by the 
. University of Notre Dame's 
Law School and College of 
Engineering. 
The study was funded through 
a $191,917 grant to Notre Dame 
from the National Institute of 
Law Enforcement and Criminal 
Justice, the research and 
development wing of the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Ad­
ministration of the U.S. 
Department of Justice. The 
report focused on the criminal 
court systems of St. Joseph and 
Marion counties in Indiana. South 
Bend is the principal city in St. 
Joseph and Indianapolis in 
Marion. Leslie G. Froschio, 
assistant dean of the Law School 
and Dr. James Daschbach, 
associate professor of aerospace 
and mechanical engineering 
were co-directors of the project 
which included seven 
engineering and three law faculty 
members. Noted legal scholars 
Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel 
of the Universi~y of Chicago 
served as consultants for the -project. 
of the University of Chicago 
served as consultants for the 
project. 
The study's recommendations 
should be applicable to other 
court systems both within and 
outside of Indiana, Foschio and 
Daschbach explained. They 
added that the report represents 
the project's conclusions solely, 
and not the opinions of the LEA. 
Examples of the four-volume 
report's specific recom­
mendations include: 
That no continuances be 
allowed before the defendant is 
charged. If a grand jury in­
dictment can be eliminated, the 
accused should be charged and 
arraigned within a maximum of 
three days. At present, sub­
stantial prearraignment delay 
exists in Marion County because 
of heavy use of the slower grand 
jury procedure. 
-That all cases where the 
defendant pleads guilty to a 
reduced charge be decided within 
four to six weeks after 
arraignment. Presently, Foschio 
explained, these mainly routine 
cases take as much time as the 
more complex trial situation, 
clogging up the court system and 
making accurate scheduling 
difficult. 
-That all routine cases come to trial within two months of arraignment. Foschio pointed out that this recommendation may prove controversial, ex­pecially to defense attorneys who claim that delay aids their clients or is important to their rights. He contends, however, that most routme cases can easily be handled in this period, expecially if the attorney is granted ex­panded access to witnesses' statements and to evidence. In addition, he said, the study showed no correlation between post-arraignment delay and acquittal of the defendant. 
-That no more than two con­tinuances be granted before trial, and those only when the attorney can prove witnesses are not available , his client is ill and unable to appear, or the case is unusually complex. The Notre Dame study discovered that cases with three or more con­tinuances took twice as long as cases with fewer than three. Other pre-trial motions-in­eluding motions to quash the charge, admissibility of evidence and other motions important to 

the constitutional rights of the 
client, were found not to con­
tribute significantly to delay. 
-That the appellate courts set 
an example by speedy handling 
of appeals cases. The study 
shows that appeals to the Indiana 
Supreme Court accounted for 76 
percent of the total time from 
arrest to decision on appeal. 
Time for appeal itself was 22 
months, over four times the five 
month maximum recommended 
by the President's Crime Com­
mission Report. Foschio believes 
changes recommended by the 
study would reduce the appeal 
time to seven months. 
-That an administrative judge 
be appointed to oversee each 
local trial court system with 
more than one judge, with an eye 
to efficient scheduling of cases 
and pre-trial motions. He could 
also hear the easily-decided 
cases where the defendant pleads 
guilty to a reduced charge. 
-That each member of the 
Indiana Supreme Court be 
responsible for the quality and 
efficiency of the administtration 
of criminal justice in designated 
regions of the state. 
These recommendations stem 
from case data collected by 10 
Indianapolis law students in the 
largely urban Indianapolis area 
and 6 Notre Dame law students in 
the less-populous St. Joseph 
County area. From the data on 
over 2,500 felony cases, Notre 
D:tme engineering faculty 
devised a computer model of the 
courts which uaschbach expects 
to be applicable to many other 
court systems, as well as 
hospitals and other service 
agencies. 
"Our model is unusually simple and accurate and can be run on a fairly small computer," Dasch­bach explained. One of the main advantages of the model is its ability to provide concrete an­swers to hypothetical questions­for instance, what would the delay be if all cases plead guilty? The model calculated that even if all defendants pleaded guilty, there still would b~ delay defined as any unnecessary time beyone the maximum stnadards of the 1967 President's Crime Com­mission Report. 
The model also showed con­clusively that the criminal justice system in these counties suffered from a lack of overall control. Daschbach explained that the various parts of the system ap­pear to operate independently, and efficiency in one area does not carry over to efficiency in the 
whole. Such a situation, he ex­
plained, indicates a system 
unresponsive to any centralized 
coordination. 

Foschio and Daschbach added 
that an essential assumption to 
their recommendations is that 
both counties have the per­sonnel and facilities to reduce delay with somewhat more ef­ficient management. The data of the project tends to support th1s assumption. Although this condition may not be true in larger jurisdictions, the ob­servations of the project suggest that even if a somewhat greater number of criminal trials should arise, the present system, if properly managed, could deal with them. 
The report concluded that Indiana could become a model state for efficient handling of criminal cases if judges and prosecutors will work more directly toward this goal by implementing the necessary reform.

$700,000 deficit for '71-72 

by Mike Baum 
( 

The University may be in for rough economic times, according to Provost Fr. James T. Burt­chaell, but the administrator said that Notre Dame would survive 
I and probably be stronger than 
) 
I ever. 
( 
The University is expecting a 700 thousand dollar defcit this
t 
fiscal year, in contrast to a 70 thousand dollar surplus last year. "The University has been con­fronted with a set of financial burdens which may not only absorb all the increased income we could reasonably summon up, but could engulf and overwhelm our economic ability to survive," Fr. Burtchaell said in a report to the faculty dated February 8. 
The Provost went on to express his belief in Notre Dame's basic fiscal soundness. 
"We shall suvive. Indeed, we shall thrive; we shall use this season to strengthen our relative position among universities." 
Fr. Burchaell admitted that faculty are underpaid "at Notre Dame as elsewhere". Graphing statistics to show that while salaries here are higher than an overall average, but "somewhat less than our peer schools" with an "average lag" of about one year, he stated that "the ad­ministration is persistently committed to ever constant improvements in faculty com­pensation." 
Fr. Burtchaell cited the need to achieve a better than adequate program of faculty com­pensation, together with reasonable student fees, while coping with "the close of one of the University's great building eras." He outlined in broad long range plans for endowments, and a proposed short range program of adjustments in faculty work loads. 
The article, which appeared in the current Notre Dame Report, quoted as major economic fac­tors: the costs of the newly in­stalled IBM 370-155, rises in fuel costs, building and maintanence costs (aggravated by the Galvin Life Sciences Building), in­creased insurance rates, and several federal cuts in higher education underwriting. In­creased costs for unemployment compensation, costs involved in the transition to co-education, and science development were also noted as major cost in­creases. 
Considering long range plans, Fr. Burtchaell observed that gifts, a major source of funds, "continue to be constant and abundant." While these funds have generally gone into new buildings, he explained, this will be changed. "We are nearing the close of one of University's great building eras, and intend hen­ceforth to dedicate the large part of our fund-raising potential to endowment." 
Listing endowments which will "receive prime attention", Fr. Burtchaell mentioned: the Faculty Development Fund, to meet annually increasing faculty compensation; Endowed Chairs, "to attract and support the quality of scholar required by an, ambitious and influential graduate program"; Library Endowment; Scholarship funds; and a Computer fund. 


Under Scholarship funds, the Provost noted, "To this end, the University will shortly be an­nouncing the establishment of a special endowment of three millions of dollars to provide scholarships for minority students." 
In the major part of the faculty­oriented report, Burtchaell discussed general aspects of a short range economizing plan, which he hopes will be adopted after faculty consultation. Citing unequal divisions of teaching loads among departments and even within departments (68 faculty members teach only 3 credit hours per semester" as opposed to 152 teaching's hours), he suggested, "we must develop and ennuciate a policy on faculty teaching loads." However, "it must be no crude 'productive 
index'.'' 

In this program of ''economic self-discipline", Burtchaell advocated a "statutory academic load". This would hopefully be strong enough to even out the distribution of class hours, while at the same time being flexible enough to handle cases of department heads, and faculty engaged in scholarly projects, who need the extra time. 
In addition, he recommended a student credit hour load to balance often disproportionately large or small classes. Also taken into consideration was faculty size. 
The conclusion of the report discussed faculty fringe benefits. These include Disability In­surance, Unemployment Com­pensation, Maternity Leave, Health Insurance, and Faculty Child Educational Benefits.

Problems of homosexuals 
by John Comiskey 

The homosexual in our time has become more than a distant concern, he is a social and political reality. Homosexuals are banding together as a political force, to overcome social and employment discrimination. However, the problems confronting the homosexual on a college campus would center almost exclusively on the former.

A study by Bieber has shown that other therapists, such as Hatterer, have ~chieved mixed results by motivating their patients to work diligently on altering concious cheices. This method, however, assumes that the homosexual orientation is based on these concious choices. Until recently, the most successful method of therapy has been psychoanalysis. This is a long drawn out process, and the results were often unsatisfactory. 
Recently, behavior th~rapis.ts have developed .ar' technique for treatment mvolvmg the use of electnc shock to train the patient to avoid the undesired 
sexual preference. Feldman and MuCullough have reported encouraging success with. this technique, and it is being experimented with aroung the country, especially on the west coast. However,

Many therapists involved in the treatment of this and other problems assist the patient in coping with the conflicts intendent upon the homosexua.l. The patient must decide between suppressiOn or gratification of his desires, and in either case he will encounter many difficulties and constant stress. 
The therapist attempts to assist the patient in resolving doubts, making the best decision for himself, and delaying the inevitable anxiety and depression. Often, through continued help, the patient developes greater self confidence and courage and is less dependent on others. Once self­esteem i~ truly enhanced, the homose~ual f~ls free to make choices previously thought 1mposs1ble. 
Fr. Dunn stated, "The saddest thing about gay life is that it is not really gay; it is bitter and despairing. Only bravado and exuberance make it bearable." At Notre Dame's Psychological Ser­vices Center the therapists try to assist in over­coming fear, ~nxiety, and dependenc;e.
