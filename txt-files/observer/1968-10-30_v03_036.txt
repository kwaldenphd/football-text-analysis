Rossie Wins 74% of Vote 
And Carries Every Hall 

Student Body President J. 'Richard Rossie achieved an overwhelming victory in the first ·;tude nt president ia 1 recall election in the history of the University. 
Rossie received 2648 votes, 
74.1 per cent of the total in swamping three opponents. He easily carried every hall on campus and off campus as well. The total number of students voting was 3575 compared with 4197 in last February's election. 
Sophomore Paul Dillenburger finished a distant second, garnering 522 votes, approximately 14.6 per cent of the vote. The Afro-American Society candidate, Don Wycliff, was thi1d with 321 votes and 8.9 per cent of the vote. 
Ed Roickle of the Students 
for a Democratic Society was 
last with 2.4 per cent of the vote 
with 84 ballots cast for him. 
Rossie carried every hall including Stanford, the resident hall of Dillenburger. He achieved his smallest majority there with 55 per cent of the students favoring him. 
RMsie achieved his highest 
margin of victory in Moreau and 
Morrissey llalls, with 93 and 92 
per cer.t respectively. 
Rossie dominated Morrissey with 259 votes of 292 students voting. He received 28 of 31 in Moreau. 
Dillenburger was strongest in his own hall with 89 votes and 41 per cent of the vote. He was expected to be strongest on the North Quad. He received 22 per cent in Breen~Phillips, 19 in Cavanaugh, and 16 in Keenan. 
Wycliff was strongest in Lyons, Fisher, Sorin and Off-Campus. They were the only halls in which he received more than 10 per cent of the vote. 
Roickle was blanked in both Moreau and Zahm and his strongest support came from Fisher and Holy Cross, where he achieved 8 per cent of the student vote. 
Of his tremendous victory, Rossie said, "I think it indicates that the students simply want to give me the opportunity to finish my administration." 
Rossie added that he would have "seriously considered" resigning if he had not received 50 per cent of the vote. He attributed the 20 per cent rise in support for him to the fact that p!ople arc simply reluctant to remove an official from office Juring his tenure. 
Wycliff said, "I did better than I expected. I really didn't expect to get 321 votes on this campus." 
Wycliff indicated that the blacks would certainly become more active politically. "To be perfectly frank, this campaign is just the beginning." Although he declined to speak for the Afro-American Society he did say, "Where there's a chance to gain power we"ll be there to get it." 
Roickle and Dillenburger were not available for comment. 
SMC Smoking OK 
The Committee on Residence Halls last night approved a bill permitting McCandless Hall residents to smoke in their rooms. The only stipulation the committee made was that the students were to have regulation ashtrays in their rooms. The rule went into effect last night at 12:00. 
The Committee also passed a bill allowing up to 164 guests over and above the number of residents in the hall. This is in line with building safety codes as stipulated by the State of Indiana.

James Bond has nothing on Saint Mary's. Students for the past three years have escaped from a dungeon far more challenging than those lan Fleming conceived of. Intrigue was so much fun. But the fuc is all over. 
Future Saint Mary's students will erect monuments to those comageous women, the Bolters. Their saga will be related over the smoke and names of late night cigarettes shared in the students's rooms. A twentieth century Saint Mary's will look back with pride on its pioneer days, two years past. It was in that year, 196 7, in the dead of winter, that a female folk-hero was reported missing at 3 
a.m. Vigilantes tracked her down. Unaware of the search, our heroine was having a riot off campus. A phone caller tipped her off, and she realized the necessity of returning to campus and foiling the villains who wanted to find her missing. Traveling a river route, she was able to break in through a chapel window. Frozen half to death, she confronted the search party and announced that for the past four hours she had been star gazing from the LeMans bell-tower. Mission Incredible. She was convicted. 
A careful search of the residence halls may reveal the tools used to accomplish these schemes. Flashlights used to study in the closets when freshmen had lights-out. Suitcases disguised as typewriter cases. Beer cans disguised as pencil holders. Brandy glasses disguised as Homecoming favors. This memoribilia should be preserved in a showcase before the remnants of Saint Mary's frontier days have completely faded out. 
There will no longer be an opportunity for the kind of creative thinking elicited by sign-out regulations. Students will have to put their minds to work on something besides bolting. If progress continues, Saint Mary's students will have nothing to talk about but education. And th;:n they're in trouble. Nobody likes a broad that thinks. 
Before its too late, students must begin an underground movement to reinstate sign-out. Protest by returning to the dormat 2 a.m. voluntarily. Give yourself late minutes. Let late minutes accumulate and then campus yourselves. and then, when you have proved your sincerity, sign-out will be legislated. Ai last you will bring back the bolt.

N D Students Face Divers Issues 
Issues including the Wallace campaign, Black Power, and the state of the Notre Dame community came in for lively examination in a three-hour Issues Day forum in Stepan Center yesterday afternoon. Figures including a U.S. Senator, a Congressman, a University President, an Alabama Mayor, and an Afro-American student leader were on hand during the course of the discussion, and crowds of up to 800 witnessed the exchanges. 
Debate on the Presidency 
highlighted early parts of the 
Stepan forum as candidates 
Hubert Humphrey and George 
Wall ace came in for heavy 
criticism from student 
questionners. Defending his 
candidate, Patrick Fleming, 
Appalachian Poverty Program 
director and Humphrey 
spokesman, contended that the 
Vice President was "appalled 
and shocked" by the violence 
during the Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago. Fleming 
stated "Hubert Humphrey is not · 
a man who condones or supports 
violence. He was not in a 
position to turn off the 
violence." 
Two major political figures addressed the forum, with Congressman John Brademas of South Bend strongly endorsing the idea of participation in politics. Brademas gained prolonged applause as he maintained "The question of people having a sayso in their lives is one heard more and more. It is quite appropriate for Black parents to ask what kind of education their children are receiving because that education determines what sort of lives those children shall lead." 
Indiana's U.S. Senator Vance 
Hartke stressed the importance 
of the 1968 elections in a fifteen 
minute talk which touched on 
the Vietnam War. Concerning 
1968, Hartke contended "This is 
a crisis year, 1968. This year 
determines which way our 
country is to go, whether it 
will go down the road to 
repression." 
After the conclusion of the political discussion, university officials headed by Fr. Hesburgh sat surrounded by students answering student inquiries. Hesburgh and Admissions Catholic enrollment of Notre Dame is intentional. Hesburgh replied to repeated questions 
concerning admission of Black asserted "In undergraduateStudents.

SMC Does It Too 
A student inspired free for all in the SMC Cafeteria climaxed the school's first Time Out Day. Yesterday student leaders and just folks alike took to the mike to express grievances against the establishment, the faculty, and in the words of one senior, "all the deadheads in this school." 
The heated discussion began when NSA ccr-ordinator Carolyn Gatz took the student body to task for their lack of attendance at the various teach-ins. Miss Gatz ~;ommented upon the sparse crowd at the wind up discussion at the Coffee House and said: "There were only 50 people that cared enough to discuss what they thought could be done with this school and they were awfully upset that there were only 49 other people to listen to them." 
Senior Mary Rita Schmitz proposed that students take over their classes Monday and 
Tuesday and demand that th teachers listen to studen

opinion on how their classes should be run. Miss Schmitz sail: 
"If they don't agree then we. should quit going to the classes. We've got to do something, even if it means sacrificing our precious little grade-points." Senior class vice-president Kathy Davidson concurred with Miss Schmitz saying: "You kids seem to get all up in arms about things like smoking in your rooms and liberal signout rules. Don't you think that just maybe your academic life here is something to get excited about ?"

No Amateurs 
MEXICO CITY (UPI)-I've just come back from a fool's errand. 
I was out looking for a pure amateur in the Olympic Village and I wasn't particular, either. 
Any pure amateur would do. It could be a young one or old one, male or frmale, gold medalist or also ran, a member of the United States team or not. 
I put in more than three hour.s looking and I can report my findings in three words: Forget it, Charlie. There ain't no s..1ch animal. That goes whether the International Olympic Committee likes it or not. 
Before trying to hunt up my amateur, I dropped over to the U.S. team's headqparters and spoke with an official of the Olympic committee. Speaking with him reminded me of the time I was a kid and stumbled into a huge, dark cave. After awhile I called out "hello." Back came the echo at me, "hello."-exactly the way I had spelled it. 
"Do you feel U.S. athletes are being subsidized in any way?" I 
asked the U.S. official. 
"We've made a statement on that already," said the official. 
"Another U.S. official said he considered that a pretty weak 
statement?" 
"Well, whether it is or not, that's our statement." 
"What about another statement attributed to your committee, 
that the U.S. would return any gold medals found to have been won by subsidized athletes?" "What about "Did a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee make that statement." "I don't know." "Well, how many members are there in the U.S. Olympic 
Committee?" 
"About 400." 
"And you wouldn't know if your committee made a statement 
regarding the return of any gold medals even, though you're a member of the committee?" 
"Thafs right." 
"Tremendously efficient system your people have here." 
"I agree. Regrettably." · 
I was looking for a pure amateur athlete, not a pure amateur 
official, so I left the U.S. compound and spoke with athletes from 
other countries. 
When I tried to determine whether they were pure amateurs, some 
said they didn't know what I meant although I had the feeling they 
did; others said it wasn't a subject they particularly wished to talk 
about and still others said it depended on the definition of the word. 
What I tr.ied to do then was think of a typically ameteur sport and check the competitors in that one. I hit on cycling because even a five year old can ride a bike, but after speaking with a number of ·cyclists from different countries I discovered they were given their bikes by various manufacturers. These competitors are expected to see that the name of the manufacturer, imprinted on their bikes, is 
plainly evident any time a photographer takes a picture of them. 
That didn't sound purely amateurish to me. 
"We got bikes from a manufacturer for the 1964 Olympics, but 
not this time," said one U.S. cyclist, who said please, the one thing 
he didn't need was his name in the paper. 
"Our team r~ceived $3,000 worth of equipment from a 
manufacturer this time," he went on. "Like tires. tools and so on. 
What's so wrong about. it? I certainly couldn't afford it out of my 
pocket. II I had to pay for all those things I wouldn't be riding. My 
name isn't Vanderbilt." 
He and a fellow cyclist were standing near one of the soft drink 
stands set up for Olympic athletes. The soft drinks, marketed by a 
U.S. concern, are free but by one of those coincidences, they also are advertised on TV during the showing of these Games to audiences in the United States. 
"All the athletes stop by that stand for free drinks, don't theyF' I 
asked the U.S. cyclist. 
"Certainly," he said. "Why shouldn't they? I know if I were a 
Russian cyclist and I were thirsty I would." 
There was no athlete who really knew the exact definition of the 
world amateur. In the local library, they said a pure amateur was a 
devotee or admirer. 
I think George Foreman, the U.S. heavyweight boxer from 
Houston, said it a lot better than that, though. 
George is a dropout from junior high school and doesn't have 
much formal education but he can tell a lot of more learned 
egg-heads about the meaning of the word amateur. 
"For my first fight that I won," he says, "I got a little trophy in 
the form of a boxing glove. It's no more than three inches all 
around, gold-plated and couldn't cost more than five dollars. You 
couldn't give me five million for it. I wouldn't take it. That wouldn't 
buy half the satisfaction it gives me." 
Come to think of it, maybe that wasn't such a fool's errand after all.

Heisman Stock Up 
Terry Hanratty's Heisman Trophy stock has risen quite a few points in the past two weeks. 
It started against Illinois when he broke The Gipper's total offense record and was named Back-of-the-Week by both wire services. Then last weekend, a fine individual performance on television and Duffy Daugherty's comments aided the T.H.H. cause. 
In his taped telephone interview last Wednesday, Duffy said, "Hanratty is the finest quarterback in college football today and he's better than a lot of the pros who are playing now." 
At a Friday night press party in East Lansing, Duffy added, "He certainly deserves the Heisman Trophy. His total offense is much greater than the other two top candidates." 
Monday afternoon, reflecting on Hanratty's Saturday afternoon performance, Duffy said flatly, "I've never seen a better college quarterback." 
Terry is on the verge of reaching the all-time 
NCAA Top Ten in both total offense and forward 
passing. 
He needs just 337 yards rushing and throwing to surpass Charlie "Choo Chou" Justice of North Carolina and rank tenth on the all-time list. The top four places seem out of Hanratty's reach. But 756 yards in the last four games would leave him No. 5 in total offense. 
The passers are ranked according to number of completions. Hanratty now has 290 for his career, compared to 331 for Kentucky grad Babe Parilli, who holds down the No. I0 position. Hanratty is likely to finish his career seventh or eighth in this department. 
Terry's completion percentage is better than half the passers in the Top Ten and his throwing yardage for three years likely will be fifth behind 
Billy Stevens (U. of Texas at El Paso), Jerry Rhome (Tulsa), Zeke Bratkowski (Georgia) and Steve Spurrier (Florida). 

With those statistics, Terry probably would have the Heisman award locked up in a lot of other years. Indeed, he has smashed the records of four former NO quarterbacks who won the New York Athletic Club's coveted honor-Paul Hornung, John Huarte, Johnny Lujack and Angelo Bertelli. 
But this yea, there is ~ Great Debate from 
Lafayette to LJ)s A113eles over the respective 
abilities of Leroy and O.J. That confrontation 
leaves Hanratty third on tlte list of Heisman 
favorites. 
However, there is still a fine chance for him to win. Contradictory, you say? Watch this. 
Votes will be r: wiled Nov. I 2 to the some I ,200 men who select t:w ~:eisrn:n '.'tinJcr. Eaclr fellow picks his top three candi-latr~s, wit 1 tI r1x• noints going to his top man, two to 'lis sc-.:<,1 d choice and one to his third pick. Total point:; deter ·1ines the victor. 
Hanratty certainly will garner some first-place votes, simply because there are those writers and broadcasters who think he's the finest player in the land. 
Now, with the Simpson-Keyes battle raging, there are those men who feel so committed to one candidate that they will shun his major foe. For instance, some of the Los Angeles Times boys may vote thus: I. Simpson, 2. Hanratty, 3. Hendricks. Midwesterners may go: I. Keyes, 2. Hanratty, 3. 
.Phipps. 
On those two ballots, Terry would have a one-vote margin over both Leroy and O.J. Expand the idea and you realize that Notre Dame could have its seventh Heisman Trophy winner this 
season.
