Not all seniors are as lucky as Ross and Radostits. For these seniors the job search continues post-graduation. According to Manier, an addi­tional 50 percent of Saint Mary's graduates will find jobs by September. "Saint Mary's graduates definitely do well in the job market," said Manier. 
"They are bright, motivated, and posses good interactive and communication skills." 
Many jobless seniors main­tain a positive attitude and a sense of humor about their situation. 
''I'm not worried about find­ing a job," joked Kelly Kilmer. ''I'm buying lots of lottery tickets. And I can go to Senior Bar and use all my rejection letters to buy drinks." Manier advises seniors to take advantage of the resources on campus before they leave. 
"Register with the career office, line up faculty and staff references, and use the Alumni Resource Network to get a list of contacts," she said. "And remember, net­work, network, network." 

Transition

pact. 
Clasp wrote in his paper that Argentina and Peru would make a transition by revolu­tion. 
This hypothesis was dis­proved also because Argentina and Peru instead used a "real mixed mode of transition." 
Clasp's fourth hypothesis, a transition to democracy by im­position, relates to the situa­tions in Brazil and Chile. 
Clasp's remaining five hy­potheses addressed how the mode of transition and incorporation of labor can effect a democracy. Clasp said that one should "expect a large role for legislatures (partisan powers) where there has been a history of a centrist majority bloc." 
Venezuela and Uruguay are examples of this according to Clasp. Clasp also stated that countries such as Brazil and Chile "where authoritarians dominate the mode of transi­tion, power is likely to be con­centrated in the executive in the resulting democracy." 
According to Clasp, fully un­derstanding the theoretical stages of democracy is neces­sary to comprehend the demo­cratic political system. Further, the different forms of transi­tion a country must undergo relate the different political and social trends in each coun­try.

quickly. We feel it is prudent to wind things up," he said. 
Sixteen Notre Dame students have been studying in Jerusalem this semester through the Notre Dame pro­gram. 
Their housing is located at the Bethlehem checkpoint on the border between Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
According to Tracy Tiemeier, one of the students, the major­ity of the group feels it is un­necessary to leave Israel early and was initially upset at the manner in which the situation was handled. 
"We're very upset, and un­derstand that the University is looking out for our best inter­ests, but we feel we're safe," she said. "We feel the vio­lence, and it's scary, but we're at a place where we're pro­tected." 
When the decision was made to shorten the semester, the students were on a trip in the Negev desert. They were in­formed of the decision on their return to Jerusalem, and in re­sponse, 14 of the 16 signed a letter to the University 
administration which ques­tioned the reasoning behind the decision. 
The students were also dis­turbed by the fact that they were not consulted when the decision was made. According to Tiemeier, the students' par­ents were informed of the sit­uation first. 
"The administration didn't contact us directly but contact­ed our parents ...They [the University] decided Thursday night, and we found out Sunday night," she said. 
Harold Pace, the father of one of the students in Jerusalem, was informed of the situation over last week­end. · 
While he was disappointed that his daughter Leann could not complete the semester, he expressed support for the University's action. 
"I think the University really had a lot of good sources for the information, not only from within the University but also through the . director in Jerusalem and from within Is­rael," he said. 
In a letter responding to the students concerns, 'rom Bo­genschild, director of the inter­national study programs, stat­ed, "I had hoped to alert you to these concerns before you left for your field trip to the Negev, but was told that you had just left. 
In the meantime, we felt sufficiently alarmed to take decisive action as quickly as possible ... The decision was not taken lightly, and was reached after full deliberation and con­sultation with a wide range of 'informed people."' 
Classes for the students were initially scheduled to end on May 5, after which the stu­dents would have been given five additional days for travel­ing. 
Since the students' return from the Negev, they have been restricted in their actions for the duration of their stay in Jerusalem. 
"This week we're confined, and we haven't heard about our flight. It's supposed to leave between April 29 and May 1, but the travel agency is still trying to reschedule it," Tiemeier said. 

"A lot of us had traveling plans through Europe and Greece so it's been pretty rough. Now we're trying to make the most of our last week." 
Although the semester is ending early, the students will not lose credits as a result, said Moore. 
"They're winding things down so it shouldn't affect the outcome of the term. It's not an evacuation, simply a short­ening of the semester," he said. 
Students are now completing their papers and taking finals in preparation for the nearing end of the semester, according to Tiemeier. 
While they understand the concern, the group still main­tains that they would prefer to complete the original length term. "We see intellectually what they're saying, but we still don't see why they have to send us home early," she said.

Dole wins Pennsylvania primary amid GOP doubt 
By JOHN KING 
Associatt•d Press 
Bob Dole won Pennsylvania's presidential primary Tuesday but it was of little solace to a campaign trying to cure an in­ternal Hepublican funk that has exposed doubts about the nominee and the GOP's broad­er eleetion strategy. 
Dole clinchnd the GOP nomi­nation by winning 25 consecu­tive primaries in March, leav­ing little drama for Pennsylvania -or the 11 presidential contests still to eome. 
Any chance for fireworks in Pennsylvania ended with Pat Buchanan's decision not to campaign there, even though· he remains an active candi­date. 
Pennsylvania's 73 GOP con­vention delegates officially run uncommitted to any candidate, but many were Dole backers and most, if not all, were ex­pected to back him at the August GOP convention. Dole entered the day with 1,202 delegates, well beyond the 996 needed to clinch nomination. 
Early returns showed Dole handily beating Buchanan. President Clinton, who long ago clinched renomination, had no major opposition and coasted in the Democratic pri­mary. 
So predictable were the re­sults that Dole didn't even stage a primary night celebra­tion, instead thanking Pennsylvania Republicans in a statement that ignored recent turmoil in the Republican ranks over Dole's skills as a candidate and the party's strategy for dealing with aggressive congressional Democrats. 
"You showed that the Republican Party is unified, it is focused and it is ready to take its message of positive, conservative change directly to

the American people," Dole said. 
That upbeat assessment ran counter to this evaluation of the Republican mood from a senior Dole adviser: "It's ugly out there." 
Indeed, it was House Speaker Newt Gingrich who went so far as to use the term "funk" -a word President Clinton offered not too long ago when he was trying to explain his own political trou­bles. 
"We are going through a Republican period of being in a funk," Gingrich said Monday night. 
But Gingrich reminded his audience that if big early leads always held up, the 1988 elec­tion would have produced President Dukakis. 
Still, there is no disputing that Dole and his party have had a rough stretch. 
For starters, Dole's early clinching of the Republican nomination hasn't translated into momentum: Recent na­tional polls show Clinton with as much as an 18-point lead over Dole in a head-to-head matchup, and a comfortable lead in a three-way race with 
Michiana 

Ross Perot. 
Surveys also show persistent doubts about the Republican Congress and high negative ratings for Gingrich, whom Democrats try to link to Dole at every opportunity. 
And Dole's plan to use his post as Senate majority leader to make his case against Clinton has had more snarls than successes so far, as Democrats have put Dole and fellow Republicans on the defensive by demanding a vote on raising the minimum wage. 
That is just one example of GOP struggles in developing a coherent election-year legisla­tive strategy. Nervous about the pounding the party took from Clinton in last year's bud­
get fight, some Rep ublieans '------'---------______lAP 


are decidedly more cautious this year. 
Dole, for example, com­plained over the weekend of being "blindsided" by the de­cision of some 20 House Republicans to back a mini­mum wage increase. 
The GOP blunders on the minimum wage, and problems developing a broader legisla­tive strategy, have renewed debate within the party over

whether Dole should step down as majority leader, or at least turn over day-to-day management of the Senate to Republican Whip Trent Lott. Dole has steadfastly resisted such advice. 
On Monday, William Bennett, the author and former educa­tion secretary, said Dole's Senate post was "a trap" and that within the party, "there's very little enthusiasm about Bob Dole." 
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed attributed the criti­cism to "some inside the Beltway people trying to get their names in the paper." He said that for the most part, the party was coalescing around Dole. 
But many state GOP leaders share Bennett's concerns about Dole's skills as a candi­date and communicator, though they are reluctant to be 
so blunt publicly.

Popular with the public, a proposfld constitutional amendment to place term lim­its on members of Congress was blocked Tuesday by a Senate Democratic filibuster. Hepublicans sought political advantagfl in the aftermath. 
On a 58-42 vote, two short of thfl 60 needed, lawmakers re­fusfld to stop debate. 
That left the bill in limbo, and aides and lawmakers alike said Majority Leader Bob Dole would soon pull it from the noor. 
"We'll bring it up again next year if need be," Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said shortly before the vote. Elected to the Senate in i994, Thomp­son led the fight for the mea­sure, which enjoys support in the 70 percent range in public opinion polls. 

All 53 Republicans and five Democrats voted to curtail de­bate on the proposal. All the votes against were cast by Democrats. 
Term limits advocates out­side Congress had long wanted a vote, the better to target candidates for the next few election cycles. 
Said Paul Jacob, head of U.S. Term Limits, "I think those people who voted no ... are go­ing to find that if they're up for election this year, this was not a very good vote for them." 
The measure would have limited senators to two six­year terms and House mem­bers to six two-year terms, effective on the amendment's ratification by the required three-fourths of the state legis­latures. 
The Constitution does not limit the length of congres­sional service. Lawmakers generally accumulate power through seniority, gradually rising through the years to chairmanships of subcommit­tees and full committees. Those posts confer enormous power over federal money and programs. 
The term limits proposal was part of the House Republicans' Contract With America that helped fuel the GOP election successes of 1994. Even so, the GOP-controlled House rejected it last year on a 227-204 vote, well shy of the two-thirds ma­jority needed.

Insurance coverage 
By DIANE DUSTON 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Senate unanimously passed legislation Tuesday to protect millions of workers from losing health insurance when they change or lose jobs. Late addi­tions also would create tax breaks 
for the .···. ·· chronically 
Dole
ill. 

The mea­sure now goes to a House­Senate conference committee to work out substantial differ­ences with the House. But the rare 100-0 vote puts the full force of the Senate behind its version as negotiators begin the blending process. 
And one controversial Senate provision -requiring insur­ance companies to treat men­tal illness the same as physical illness -apparently won't be a problem. Senate sponsors from both parties said it would have to come out. 
The bill's success contrasts sharply with the failure two years ago of a wide-ranging proposal by President Clinton to overhaul the nation's health care system. 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole worked with Finance Chairman William Roth to ex­pand the bill with new deduc­tions for the self-employed and for terminally or chronically ill people. 
The core purpose of the legislation, sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass, is to assure that people who lose or change their jobs con­tinue to be able to purchase health insurance, even if they have an existing medical prob­lem. 
The bill does not regulate the cost of that insurance, but would stop companies from refusing to sell policies to workers with health problems. The practice has prevented millions of people changing employers or striking out on their own. 
Dole said he regretted the Senate turned back his effort to include a House provision setting up tax-exempt medical savings accounts, but indicated he would continue to push for them.

Egyptian police shoot two massacre suspects 
Associated Press 
ASSlUT 

In an hours-long gunbattle amid sugar-cane fields, police Tuesday killed two men they believe participated in the massacre of 18 Greek tourists near the pyramids. 
Four policemen died and 14 others were wounded. 
It was the bloodiest day since assailants opened fire on the tourists outside the Europa Hotel in Cairo last Thursday, a savage reminder that Egypt's struggle to halt Muslim mili­tants' violent campaign contin­ues. 
Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, claimed re­sponsibility for the attack, say­ing it meant to kill Israeli tourists to avenge the Israeli bombing of Lebanon. The Is­lamic Group is the largest mili­tant organization in Egypt. 
Since the attack, the govern­ment has sent thousands of po­lice into fields and towns in southern Egypt to search for the assailants. Police have ar­rested hundreds of suspects. 
Militants opened fire Tuesday as security forces closed in on their hideouts in sugar-cane fields near the tense town of Malawi, about 50 miles north of Assiut, police said. The shooting erupted before noon and lasted several hours. 
Two gunmen were killed, and the Interior Ministry said both were believed "to have participated in the recent attack on the tourists." A min­istry official. speaking on con­dition of anonymity, later said they may have been among the four assailants or helped arrange the attack by provid­ing arms or transportation. 
In Tuesday's fighting, four policemen were also killed, including Maj. Gen. Gamal Fayeq, head of police forces in the south, and his brother. Lt. Col. Magdi Fayeq, the ministry said. 


Twelve of the policemen were wounded, some of them seriously, when militants am­bushed a truck carrying seven police in the same area of Malawi. The truck overturned and another truck carrying five policemen collided with it, police said. 
Officials in Malawi blamed the high number of police casualties on the militants' knowledge of the sugar cane fields, which they often use as hideouts. 
Militants with the Islamic Group have fought the gov­ernment since~1992, seeking to install strict Islamic rule. More than 930 people have been killed, most of them police or extremists. 
Despite the Interior Ministry's announcement, the Egyptian government on Tuesday banned reporting on the killing of the Greek tourists and the investigation. Officials said it was to prevent the pub­lication of information that might aid the militants. 
Radioactive dust flies through air at disaster site 
By ANGElA CHARLTON 

Associated Press 
KIEV 
Fire raced through deserted villages around the Chernobyl nuclear plant Tuesday, sending wind-whipped radioactive par­ticles skyward 10 years to the week after the world's worst nuclear accident. 
Monitors flown in helicopters over the area of the fire record­ed only a slight radiation increase, said Nikolai Komshensky, a spokesman for Ukraine's nuclear regulatory agency. 
"We see no reason to be con­cerned now," he said. 
Plant officials said the fire posed no danger to the Cher­nobyl plant, still in operation a decade after a reactor exploded, killing at least 30 people out­right. Another 5 million people were exposed to radioactive fall­out, mostly in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. 
No injuries were reported in the fire, which burned several acres before being put out after about 7 1/2 hours. It was not clear how much damage was done to the villages, officially off limits since the plant disaster. 
Firefighters said the blaze was probably started by a cigaretts dropped by one of the families visiting graves near the village of tovsty Lis. about six miles northwest of the plant. 
Old women sobbed and tried to shield grandchildren from the smoke as flames engulfed homes they were forced to abandon to radioactive contamination from the April26, 1986, disaster. 
The fire spread quickly through five villages in the 18­




Fires blaze around Chernobyl 
mile exclusion zone around the plant, carried by strong winds blowing toward Kiev and its 2.6 million residents. It burned pines and buildings in one of the areas most heavily contam­inated with radioactive cesium. 
The West has long pushed for Ukraine to close Chernobyl, but the energy-starved former So­viet republic says it needs the electricity and jobs the plant provides. 
Dr. Fred Mettler, a University of New Mexico professor who led a 1990 study into the health hazards of the Chernobyl disas­ter, said the risks from radiation were minimal. 
The cesium contamination from the 1986 accident mostly is in the soil, and not likely to be carried by smoke from burning buildings, Mettler said by tele­phone. 
"I would be surprised if any­body would get enough of a lungful to significantly change their normal cancer risk," he said. The environmental group Greenpeace, however, said fires can carry radioactive material to previously uncontaminated areas. 
"This is clearly a danger to the health of people, and not only in Ukraine," spokesman Antony 2 the fire broke out at noon. 

Small forest fires are not un­common in the exclusion zone around the plant. But Vasily Melnik, chief of the Kiev re­gional fire service, called Tues­day's blaze the "most signifi­cant" since the 1986 accident. 
The Group of Seven indus­trialized nations has pledged $3.1 billion to help close the plant by 2000, but the Western democracies set no date for de­livering the aid at their summit last weekend despite an appeal from Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. 
In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, 19 activists from around the world were arrested Tuesday at a demonstration demanding the plant's immediate closure.

• DESIDERATA 
Top ten: Suggestions for avoiding 'the real world' 
Wnll it's my last column of the year, and to k!Hlp the trend, I suppose I should give it a lillie sense of finality and farnwell. Aflllr all, I do have friends graduating from lhtl Law School this year. and I may not gel to see them all hllfore they depart, so I guess this will be my way of saying, "See ya later." 
Kirsten Dunne 

This is llw first sehool year at Notre Dame in srwen years that's eome to a dosn without rnn. I still miss it terribly. I also fnnl inspirnd in a way. As you may wnll bn aware. I'm not big on working in the "real world" -in faet, I'd say it sueks. But lwy. I've survived so far, and the longer I can do so the sooner I'll hav11 my bills paid off and be able to do what I nnjoy. 
I imagine that many of you who are graduating are venturing out into the "real world." My sympathies are with you. But there's probably also a deeenl pereentage of you who've figured out a way to avoid this fate, and you therefore still have a eerlain amount of freedom. 
And what. precisely, are you going to do with that freedom'? You don't know'? Never fear! Constantly reminiscing about my own freedom and pondering tlw things I am preeluded, by my job, from doing, I've eome up with some sug­gBslions for you. llere they are: 
10. Write Top Ten Lists. Dave l.ellerrnan's idea has become a craze nationwide, but did you know you eould ereale thnse lists all on your own and glean just as much satisfaetion? My dear frimul Angola and I figured this out in law sehool. and lnl mn tnll you, wn had fun! When classes became boring, we'd think of ten things we'd rather be doing, sometimes throwing in a rhyme seheme. When a professor had a good double entendre theme running through a lec­ture, we made a list of the best phrases. And we never failed to bring a pen and paper out to the bars, often making sev­nral new friends with our crazy lists. Of eourse, one can carry this hobby too far, and Angela and I probably did just that!, but it IS lots of fun. Try it! 
9. Follow your favorite group. Why should touring with one's favorite band bfl strictly a Deadhead thing? I received offers to see Ministry in Detroit and Indianapolis, and if it weren't for that job of mine, I'd have been there in a heartbeat. If you've ever seen your own favorite artist in concert . you know the magic it entails. At the recent Ministry shows here in Chicago. I met some neat people -people unlike the upright, anal retentive sort I see every day in my pro­fession. I got invites to a couple of par­ties. And best of all, I got to see the beautiful, mysterious AI Jorgensen in person, and his presence took my breath away. Now, while you may not love this dynamic duo as I do, I imagine there's some band out there that affects you like Ministry affects me. If you are unem­ployed, and have some money saved up, tour with them! 
8. Try to locate vampires Word has it that a governmental ageney in my very own state of residence has been set up to uncover the approximately 50 vam­pires believed to be living here. This might be tricky to follow up on but if I had nothing else to do I'd certainly take the time to check it out. Maybe I'd lind the key to immortality! Maybe I'd meet Lestat! Maybe I'm nuts? True, but I wouldn't care if I were also immortaL 
7. Compile wacky. useless statistics. If 
your an NBA fan like me, you've proba­bly noticed little squibs thrown in here and there during games by the commen­tators. These little facts get so obscure that they are ridiculous. But when I hear them I always think it's cool that some­one actually KNOWS that stuff. Such an endeavor would take time -TOO much time if you're working -but how neat would it be to be so knowledgeable and impress everyone to no end? And just think -most of the "work" involved would be watching games! There's one job I wouldn't have a gripe with. 
6. Get in touch with old friends. 
'I'm not big on working in the "real world" -in fact, I'd say it sucks. But hey, I've survived so far.' 
Sometimes you can rekindle friendships with long lost pals thereby enriching your happiness and your social life. My experience has shown that, more often, two people have grown so far apart that there's no basis for a friendship any­more. Never fear! It can still be a rewarding experience. Your friend might have gained a lot of weight. Perhaps he's managed to get himself hitehed, or has a dead-end, boring job. In these scenarios, you may not have a good friend any more, but at least you'll have a good laugh. And an improved self image to boot. 
5. Have fun with your hair. I suspect most of us would like to try cool things with our hair, but fear that it would interfere with our jobs. But hey, if you don't have a job, there's no interference to speak of. so get funky. 
4. Take walks. For me.• anyway, walks are a great way to unwind. When it's sunny, and the temperature's around 50 or 60 degrees, I can't think of any thing better than putting on my walkman and treading all over creation. 
Okay if you don't have to work, you don't really have to unwind either, true? Not necessarily. Tracking down vam­pires can be taxing. 
3. Start a 1-900 number. The bad side to not working is obvious: NO MONEY! 
GARRY TRUDEAU
• 000NESBURY 

So make some, but do it the easy way, and get the added satisfaction that you're making fools out of others. You don't have to be all that creative to start a 900 number; nor do you incur huge startup eosts. You just need a little ini­tiative, and you're set. !ley if your really lucky, you may NEVER have to work. Now that's what I call 1-900-WAY-COOL! 
2. Sleep. "You can sleep all you want when you're dead," the early-morning people in my life have told me. Even if that's true (which I debate), what's the point to waking up at 6:30 a.m. when you have no energy to do anything but yawn? I'd much rather rise at noon and feel rested, so I could spend the rest of the day enjoyably. I love sleeping, and if I wasn't working, I'd do it A LOT. If you're unemployed, make it a priority to catch up on Zs. 
1. Lighten up! There's nothing like a job -especially an office job -to make you mix up your priorities big-time. You constantly kiss up to the boss, or to clients you despise. You cancel doctors' appointments because they interfere with meetings. You deeline friends' invi­tations to socialize in order to shmooze up to politicians. Cimme a break! You should do what YOU want to do. Don't let others determine every detail of your life for you. While this can be difficult if you're at the boss' mercy for your income, the unemployed have no excuse for caving in to others' expectations of them. In the words of my soulmate AI Jorgensen, "Be your own person." In my experience, to do otherwise is disas­trous. 
Well, there you have it, folks. Even if you're not leaving ND/SMC, you won't be hearing from me for a few months now. To those who are leaving -especially my friends ~ I wish you the best of luck. And I wish each and every one of you a pleasant and completely unproductive summer. Later, guys!

f the question is, "Do girls make passes at guys who wear glasses," the answer is a definite "yes." "I think it's the Clark Kent syndrome," explained Saint Mary's sophomore Delilah Welch. "You're mildly attracted to the clumsy, eyeglass­wearing type of man." 
But Clark Kent isn't the only one catching more than a few glances these days; Ethan Hawke, Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas and E.R's Anthony Edwards have all been tagged for their eyewear. 
"Sylvester Stallone is the perfect example," said senior Ana Elmufdi. "He used to be Rambo-rough. After 'Tango and Cash' he started wearing suits and glasses . . . He looked all clean-cut, good looking, and that's all because of the glasses." 
Maybe there is something to a good pair of glasses. Banderas made his debut to many American audiences as a stutter­ing, eyeglass-wearing young man in the movie

he sun starts to shine. Faded Levi's turn into baggy khaki shorts as roller blades replace muddy b ing boots. People focus once again on staying cool and avoiding the summer squint. Nothing, al all, is worse than going for a run, a drive or a read in the sun and feeling like your suddenly turn 
into the before picture hanging on a plastic surgeon's wall. 
So avoid the possibility of wrinkles and weakened vision. Put on your shades, your blue blockers or your wanna-be Chanels and be prepared to greet the sun in comfort and style. People have, after all, managed to turn the basic, necessary pair of sunglasses into art for the eyes. 
In the SO's, Marilyn Monroe sported her cat eye specs. Women in flowing dresses and full cut bathing suits complete with matching caps wore them, too, fulfilling the Hollywood image of the complete, sun geared bathing beauty. Jackie Kennedy's oval shades filled the early 60's with the sleek, sophisticated look that was fitting for those Peter Pan collar 
·days. The 70's saw mirrored sunglasses appropriate for the bright lights of the disco while looking ever so groovy with a slick leisure suit. 
And then came the baby boomer years ... the decade of punk and pink and green whales and jelly bracelets. Sunglasses became large. Big. They were a germatolo­gists dream, protecting not only the eyes, but the nose, cheeks and often even the lips and neck. They were worn by virtually every suburban mother driving a sta­tion wagon and looked terrific with the fashionable frosted hair representative of a greater portion of the 80's. 
Punk shades played a pretty big role in early 80's fashion, too, as spiked hair and leather anything and everything took over the United States and Europe alike. Dwayne Wayne wore the practical flip up shades and Tom Cruise sported the aviator glasses, taking their popularity to a whole new level. 
Oakleys became the ultimate in eyewear in the 80's, too. They defined beach blockers; the volleyball shade of choice. 
But sunglasses had not reached the blinding level they have reached today. Brands like Revo and Bolle have made sun glasses into status sym­bols for the seemingly non-materialistic-comfort-anything-goes-where-is­my-flannel?-90's. 
J. Crew continues to sell their popular tortoise shell sunglasses while coming up with new styles like their square shades with an aluminum rim.

This summer, Hay-Ban has crafted several new shade styles. The Sidestreet Diner sunglasses, adver­tised as, "that quintessential Hollywood Accessory," sell for one-hundred and three dollars. With their smaller framed, oval shape, they mirror a more streamlined, lightweight 
pair of the famous Jackie Kennedy glasses. 
Hay-Ban Inertia sun glasses, selling for one-hundred and sixty-seven dollars take you back to the 80's flip-shade look with their sturdy bar across the upper rim. The black lenses and silver rims create a good look, whether you

But if you are one of the more daring blockers, try Ray-Ban's futuristic Verge sunglasses. Talk about sleek. These shades would make George Jetson want to make a quick trip to the Sunglass llut despite their one­

Of course, department stores li~e Macy's or Nordstrom will always have a good selection, too, although they often seem to lack in the sportier brands and styles, like Revo and Ray Ban, opt­ing for the stylish and often over priced Armanis and Ralph Laurens instead. 
For those concerned with quality and durability at a reason­able priee, Eddie Bauer has several pairs to choose from. Priced to wear and not to worry about, they look great and won't break

As you pack your bags to head for your favoritt• summer destinations, don't forget your shades.

Glasses and sunglasses are traditionally viewed as merely a functional accessory. A quick assessment of popular styles on campus is testament to the uniformity of styles here. This lack of consideration in ehoosing frames undermines the powerful potential they possess. Consider Bono's transfonnation from deeply tortured crooner to his flashy rock star alter-ego "The Fly" with little more than a pair of black -lensed wrap-arounds. 
Clark Kent's sensible and durable frames conceal his identity as a dashing superhero and lend him a more nondescript persona. Like no other accessory, glasses create a temporary identity and the fashion world is tak­ing notice. From showy and obnoxious to refined and Intellectual, the new fashion season has provided con­sumers an opportunity to don an entirely new attitude for the coming summer. 
Four eyes can only be better than two, so chuck those contacts and get glasses instead! Virtually every upscale clothing designer from Calvin Klein to Armani has extended its eye wear line in recent years. Designer frames make a personality statement, and if you chose to put prescription lenses in the frames there is always that added bonus of improved vision. 
For women, wire-rimmed oval frames lend a stylish twist to a sophisticated classic. They also offer a very feminine alternative to the conservative and unisex cir­cular-shaped specs that have dominated recently. Plastic tortoise shell frames are striking on both sexes. generally more durable than wire framed glasses and less expensive. 
If you turn into a homely Mr. McGoo when you try the conservative look, there are other options. For a look that steers clear of the preppy and collegiate, many of the art boutiques in section like Soho in New York and Chicago's Clark Street offer some more futuristic eye wear possibilities. Metal-working artists from coast to coast are experimenting with funky geometric shapes and brilliant airbrushed colors. They tend not to be very practical but they are a unique change of pace. 
The retro look never dies, and the order of the day Is 1950's nerd-wear. Thick. black frames a Ia Buddy Holly are slowly moving from the ''alternative" market to the main stream. Thrift shops are a gold mine of vintage eyewear at bargain prices. A hefty cost can come with their restoration, but if you can find a pair in decent condition they are well worth it. Pliir some rhinestone· tipped used bifocals with a silver chain and break the monotony of the merely practical. There is, however, a fine line between retro chic and the revival of styles that should remain dead, namely the oversized f'rames of the seventies. They were pretty scary on Barbara Walters, and they were truly hideous on Neil Diamond. Be wary, we don't want to stir up that trend again. 
Nothing says it's springtime like remembering to replace those shades lost in the sand or stolen at the pool. But don't be a bitter beach babe. Fate has grant­ed you the opportunity to take advantage of this sum­mer's hot styles. 
And unless you want to fake it with prescriptionless lenses (don't laugh, people actually do it) sunglasses are the only way for our 20/20 friends to express themselves through their eyewear. If you are willing to shell out the cash, you cannot go wrong with a pair of Ray-Bans. For over a decade they have set the standurd for eyewear internationally and the new wrap-around design will find their gold-rimmed Aviator and driving models in the canon of classics. And for you urban ski bunnies, the color tinted mirror-lensed Oakley shades are a must. 
An important advantage to investing in a more costly pair is the UV ray protection they provide. However if you chose to throw caution to the wind and spend under ten dollars, their is no need to sacrifice chic for cheap. The Fast Break convenient store in LaFortune has added a rack of knock-ofT styles each selling for little more than a late night snack. Remember those little struwberry shortcake and Batman numbers you had when you were just a beach baby? Try out the adult versions of drugstore shades in an obnoxious pink or baby blue for a funky statement. 
Whether you want to draw attention or remain anony­mous, the appropriate glasses can provide the look you want. A pair of shades can bring you from intellectual to rock star instaptly and without the hassle of actually changing your lifestyle.

• CREW 



Crew fares well in Knoxville 
By JOE CAVATO 
Spons Writer 
0Vflr this past weekend, the Notre Dame Howing Club an­nounced their presence to the very competitive Southern Intercollegiate Bowing Association. The crew traveled to Knoxville, Tennessee to com­pete in that league's champi­onships. and they competed very well. 
Thunderstorms and driving rain postponed Saturday racing for close to four hours. llowever, the Irish proved that they eould prevail in such con­ditions, even against high eal­iber eompetition. In faet, men's and women's teams placed near the top of the field. 
Tlw biggest race for the Irish was the men's heavyweight four. Led by David "Hobby" Hobinson the squad eaptured the gold, beating teams such as Florida's Jacksonville University, Midwest power­house Ohio State, and the University of Miami. 
In the most dramatic race of the day, another medal was taken home, this time by the men's lightweight 8. Stroked by Dino Cusumano, the team won the silver just four-tenths of a second behind the top boat. Yet another good showing was turned in by the freshman women's 8 as they placed in the petit tinals. 
The Notre Dame Bowing Club finished well despite giving up an advantage to some SlRA crews who have the opportu­nity to practice year round. The less than beautiful South Bend weather kept the team off the river in the winter. 
"Throughout the winter we did a lot of training and condi­tioning," the vice president of the club, the admiral David Hobinson said. "We did a lot of weight lifting and an endless number of hours were spent on the stairs in the engineering building." 
Much of the unexpected sue­cess of the Domers can be at­tributed to the outstanding leadership of coaches Mark Manglesdorf and Bing Cheng. 
"This is a banner year for the crew. This level of success has not been seen by Notre Dame for over live years," expressed Robinson. "Some of our suc­cess is a testament to the coaches. They are both really dedicated, and since we are a club, we have to rely on volun­teers." 
The Rowing Club hopes their success continues to grow as they will be competing again this weekend. This time, the Irish will travel north to Madison, Wisconsin for the Midwest Sprints. This champi­onship race for their own league provides the Irish with the chance to race in the National Championships in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
The top two finishers from each race will make the trip to Massachusetts. The team's best chance looks to be the men's lightweight 8 with the likes of Dino Cusumano, Jim Swartz, Andy Murray, and oth­ers looking to improve on their silver medal performance in the Southern Championships. 
Manglesdorf and Cheng are hoping their rowers can rise up to the occasion and the compe­tition as participating in the National Championships would be a big thrill for the entire club. 
o,_ -ing Their Best 
Many veteran players are hav1ng career years for the 31-12 Notre Dame baseball squad, and 1t1e1r success coupled with the emergence of several freshmen has led to the team's success this season. Here's a look at some of these performers for the Irish (Career highs are in bold).

Parker was named the Big East Pitcher of the Week yes­terday, becoming the first Notre Dame player to win the Big East's weekly honor. 
Parker didn't allow a single base runner through the first 4 1/3 innings of Sunday's win, his sixth of the season. Parker had a no-hitter going until the sixth inning, and two of the three hits he surrendered on the after­noon were bunt singles. Parker also struck out 11 Hoya batters on the afternoon, seven of which accounted for the final nine outs.

Irish split with Northern Illinois 
Notre Dame bats come to life in second contest 
Observer Staff Report 
Notre Dame's softball team suffered its first shutout loss of the season in game one 2-0 but rolled to an 8-2 win in the sec­ond game of a doubleheader against Northern Illinois. 
With the split, the Irish now stand at 41-12, while Northern Illinois is 24-14. Head coach Liz Miller was denied her 700th career win and instead stands at 699-206 (.772) in her 21­plus seasons of coaching. Miller will get another chance to win her 700th career win on Thursday when Notre Dame travels to Northwestern for a doubleheader. 
Notre Dame squandered early scoring opportunities in the first game as the Irish stranded runners at third in the first two innings and a runner at second in the fourth. These were the only chances Notre Dame would have to score in the game. 
Northern Illinois was more opportunistic as their first two hits resulted in runs. Angela Porcelli led off the fourth inning with a single and scored when her single got past center field­er Jenn Giampaolo for a three base error. 
It would be the only run the
,_ Huskies would need in the game, but they added an insur­ance run in the fifth when Tammy Pytel singled, advance to second on a sacrifice bunt by Barbara Fredrickson and to third on a wild pitch. She then beat out a suicide squeeze for the second run of the game. 
Angie Zuspann (11-4) pitched a complete-game shutout for Northern Illinois. Angela Bessolo (14-5) suffered the loss for Notre Dame as she also went the distance. 
In game two, Notre Dame pounded out 12 hits on the way to an 8-2 win. Jenna Knudson highlighted the offensive output for the Irish as she stroked a three-run double in the fourth inning to break open a 3-1 game. Katie Marten went 4-4 and scored two runs and Meghan Murray was 2-4 with two runs scored and a two-run single in the first inning which she scored Marten and Kara McMahon. 
Kelly Nichols (5-1) pitched a complete game in her first start of the season. She scattered 11 hits by Northern Illinois and allowed the Huskies just two runs. Kim Waite (4-3) pitched a complete game in the loss for Northern Illinois.

Women's Bookstore heats up 
By MEGAN MONOHAN 
Sports Writer 
Women's Bookstore Basketball is a great opportunity for women who love the game of basketball, who play for the competition, and who just want to have a good time. 
Women's Bookstore Basketball has often been re­ferred to as Bookstore's "Little Sister." Lookout for the Manhole Cover , the book all about Bookstore Basketball, provides the small history of the women's division. The women's division began in 1978, which was also the first year for Notre Dame Division III Women's Basketball. 
Typically, there are 30 to 35 teams that play in the tourna­ment, taking place the week of AnTostal, and of the finals of the main Bookstore Basketball Tournament. This year there are 40 teams, and this number should reach 100 in the near future. The same rules that apply in Bookstore Basketball also apply in the women's divi­sion. 
Only one player who has dressed for an NCAA Division I basketball team within the last 15 years is eligible per team; the athlete must have no NCAA eligibility left to compete in the event. Also, like the rule that limits the number of football players per team in Bookstore, the same rule applies to volley­ball players in the women's di­vision. 
Unfortunately, the rules have been changed around in the past because the tournament is small and has been unorga­nized. It is important that Women's Bookstore runs along­side the Bookstore Basketball Tournament, so that it may con­tinue the tradition and bring in more teams. So far, the 1996 Women's Bookstore Tournament has proved to be an improvement compared to past years, but the women's league still has a long road ahead of them. 
Shelley DeMott, a member of the '95 Women's Bookstore champion team "The Top 5 Reasons to Play Bookstore Basketball," says that she's looking forward to this year's tournament. 
DeMott also expressed her dis­appointment in past years because of the lacking coverage of Women's Bookstore and be­cause there are more female athletes at St. Mary's and Notre Dame who play basketball who do not participate in the tour­nament. 
Even though there are only 40 teams, basketball players like Stacy Fields and Carey Poor, along with a talented team of law students, will be competing in Women's Bookstore. Be sure to watch this week's games, especially the championship game on Sunday before the main Bookstore Championship.

Unseeded Sexual frustration Hechannelled gave fourth­ranktJd Showtime their biggest tnst yet despite losing 21-17. The lnad shiftnd many times in tlw heatnd match-up, eventually tilting toward Showtime. 
"This was one of the best games of the tournament," Jeff Enns of the all-senior Showtime said. "We said at the beginning of the game that we were gonna stic:k together no matter what, and that's what we did." 
Showtime's experience was exhibited in their rythmic of­fense, as four years of playing together gave them the edge over the young Sexual Frustration team. 
"They have a great team dwmistry," freshman Brian Stud of Sexual Frustration commented. 
"Thn fact that they played to­gnthnr for four years helped tlwm," teammated Dan Frigo added. "But they were still a great team."

"Their athleticism caught up 
with us and was too much for us 
to handle," Salata commented of 
the game. "But I think we 
gained a little respect tonight." 
Swoosh was content to walk 
away with the victory. 
"We managed to pull together

• WOMEN'S TENNIS 

Irish tune up for NCAA tournament 


By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Sports Writer 
Well, the season of firsts have come to a close. This is the first time ever that the Irish have won the Big East. The first time that the Irish have had a player named player of the year, and the first time that the Irish have had a coach named Big East coach of the year. There is still one first that the Irish are looking to capture. The· Irish want to win the NCAA tournament. 
The women's tennis team put an end to their regular season yesterday. The Irish hosted Western Michigan, just a day after capturing the Big East championship. Western Michigan did not prove to be much of a test for the Irish, as they easily prevailed, 8-1. The Irish now have extended their record to 22-6. 
This past match was the last regular season match for the team before the NCAAs. The Irish are looking to ride their winning streak into the NCAA tournament which is scheduled to start May 18. This meet was the seniors final home match, so all of the seniors suited up for the match. 
The doubles line-up took on some new faces for this meet. Junior Erin Gowen and sopho­more Kelley Olson started at the No. 1 doubles seed. Gowen and Olson coasted to an 8-4 victory. Freshman Jennifer Hall and senior Meredith Siegfried also managed an easy victory, 8-3. 
The only loss for the Irish came at the third spot in the doubles competition. Sophomores Molly Gavin and Darcie Sweet fell to Western Michigan's Sommer Stier and

Luck runs out on 'Monk,' 'Zealots' revail 
ByBETSYBAKER --~--~--~~~--~--~-----, 

Sports Writer 
Many seeded teams have fi­nally been tested in Bookstore XXV and some of them have failed. 
The most prominent team to fall yesterday was that of University President Father Edward "Monk" Malloy's All the President's Men, in a 21-16 loss to Crazy Dave and the Zealots. The No. 27 All the President's Men couldn't stop the Zealots' offensive barrage and near automatic shooting from the perimeter. 
"We came in all freshmen, so we were hoping to surprise some people," Mike Reed of the Zealots said. "We weren't too intimated playing Monk's team. We scouted them before, and we were hoping that the age factor would work in our favor." 
Father Malloy wasn't too disappointed with the loss. 
"It's better to win than to lose, but nobody got hurt so that's okay," he said. 
Three times was not a charm for No. 21 Zeus, Apollo, and Three Others Who Appear to be Mere Mortals, who lost 25-23 to commented on the loss.

Illinois crushes listless Irish 
Irish squander early lead, lose momentum 
By DYLAN BARMMER Assistant Sports Editor 
---Baseball games can be very long. The Irish found this out the hard way yesterday, taking a 3­0 lead into the fourth inning be­fore being lambasted by host Illinois, who scored at least one run in the next five innings to run away with a 13-3 victory. "We squandered more scor­ing opportunities early on, which kept them in the game," commented head coach Paul Mainieri following the game. The Illini not only stayed in the game but came back with a vengeanee. Such a comeback is nothing new to the 27-16 lllini this season, as the win marked the fifteenth time they have come from behind to win a game this season. After Bob Lisanti's double and 
J.J. Brock's saerifice Oy brought in two runs in the top of the 



at a 

third, the Irish were sitting pretty with a 3-0 cushion. 
But the Illini pulled the cush­ion out from under the Irish in the fifth, mounting a five run attack which was keyed by a three-run homerun by Illini first baseman Brett Laurvick, who tagged Irish pitching for four hits and four RBI on the afternoon. 
The Illini's big inning shook up Irish starter Gregg Henebry, who was yanked in the fifth af­ter surrendering seven runs, three of which were unearned. Reliever Brad Lidge would fare no better, however, as he was rocked for six runs on five hits in just over three innings of re­lief work, putting the game out of reach for the Irish. 
"They have a real good team," commented Mainieri of the Illini, who entered the game with a composite .335 batting average. "We had some bad luck in the middle of the game, and it got a little out of hand." 
The Irish's fielding was also a little out of hand, as they com­mitted five errors on the after­noon. 
"What can you say, we made a few errors," commented

Mainieri of his team's fielding, which has given him plenty of headaches this season. 
The loss dropped the Irish to 31-12 on the season, and ob­scured a 4-5 performance at the plate from the sizzling Randall Brooks, who entere-d the game batting a blistering .41 O·. Brooks personally ac­counted for almost half of the Irish's nine hits on the after­noon. 
"We just have to bounce back," said Mainieri, whose Irish will play their final 13 games in the friendly confines of Frank Eck stadium. 
The Irish will get that chance to bounce back when they tan­gle with Division III St. Norbet in a doubleheader this after­noon at 4:00. 
. Notes: Notre Dame sopho­more pitcher Christian Parker turned in his best performance in an Irish uniform in last Sunday's win over Big East National rival Georgetown, tossing a three hit complete game shutout. 
Yesterday, Parker was justly rewarded for his effort.
