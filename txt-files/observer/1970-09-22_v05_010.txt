HUSSEIN PROBES US AID 
(UPI) The Jordanian army ·claimed Monday to have halted an invading Syrian armed force coming to aid Palestinian guerrillas in the fifth day of civil war. U.S. paratroopers were put on alert for possible action to rescue stranded Americans in Jordan. 
King Hussein of Jordan ordered his troops in the capital of Amman to stop shooting Monday night in a move to .end the widening conflict, but the guerrillas said they would continue to fight. 
'Our revolutionaries are de .ermined to continue the fi &-'lt until they force the traitorous butchers to stop the massacre,"said a guerrilla broadcast from the Syrian capital of Damascus.

housing. Kathy Barlow, the student 'responsible for pre­senting the proposal to the Student Assembly, presented the proposed policy statement to the Committee. 
A question arose as to the reason the college should ap­prove off-campus housing. It was the con census of the Committee that approval of facilities should be made, as 
off-campus housing policy, by the student and her parents. 
Dr. Thomas Conway, a fac­ulty member of the com­mittee, pointed up one of the problems students should con­sider when formulating their criteria for approval of hous­ing. He referred the Com­mittee to the present housing crisis in Boston, and reminded them of the fact that in that area, students will pay a greater rent for inferior hous­ing, and are therefore directly competing with the poor of Boston who are also in need of housing. 
Sr. Immaculata agreed that this is a real problem, and said that she believed that as far as a code of acceptability in the area of off-campus housing was concerned, "This should be student approved ­it would have great educa­tional value for the student concerned about these issues." 
The next problem dealt with was that of "empty beds" would moving off­campus become so popular that the College would be faced with dorms not filled to capacity? 
It was found that St. Mary's intends to accept roughly 170 more freshmen for the I971-'72 school year, and has plans to rennovate their existing dormitory space to provide for 160 additional beds. This would obviously create a problem for the Col­
lege  if  too  many  juniors  and  
seniors  decided  to  move  off­ 
campus.  

The relative merits of going through with this rennovation before accurate figures on the number of girls planning on living off-campus were com­piled was then discussed. As Miss Josephine Barallat, another faculty member pointed out, "There are many things to be considered. If there are more students, there will be a greater need for classrooms and offices." 
Sister Immaculata then pointed out trat, according to the Heald-l'obson study done on space a tlocation last year, until St. Mary's enrollment reaches 1700, there will not be full utilization of existing 
classroom space. The point was made that girls still need areas for study and relaxation and student representatives 
expressed  the  fear  that  with  
the  new  rennovation  plans,  
this  space  would  not  be  avail­ 

able. 
Sister answered by saying, "You'll have to convince the Board (of Trustees) then, that your needs are more than just a bed, that space has been al­located properly, and that no beds over and above the num­ber allocated will be left un­
filled." 
The last point debated con­cerned the stipulation in the proposal that when a student moves off-campus "the school relinquishes its role of 'in loco parentis'". It was pointed out that the terminology used was inappropriate the school rio longer considers it­self "in loco parentis" for any student, on or off cam-
vote was postponed on this proposal until it could be changed or re-written, incor­porating some of the Com­mittee's suggestions. 
Barkett made HPC chairman 
Junior John Barkett, Presi­dent of Morrissey Hall, was elected chairman of the Hall Presidents' Council in a meet­ing yesterday. Barkett ran unopposed. 
The council also discussed plans for this year's Home­coming, and decided not to limit the decorations to one specific theme.

Sport Shorts 
My roommates and I had a fine weekend. We had journeye~ 
to Evanston to watch Ara 's lads romp to a season opening 
triumph and had celebrated the win at a mixer at Barat 
College. We returned to our hall at 5 a.m. (I still feel bad 
about waking up the security guard) and managed to catch a 
few hours sleep before tuning. in "The NFL Today" and three 
consecutive games. When the Football Scoreboard faded from 
the screen and there wasn't even a roller derby match to be 
found on the tube we were at a loss for things to do. 
Certainly studying was not an appropriate course of action an~ 
we were left to discussing the weekend in the world of 
sports. Out of this discussion came the following astute (?) observations. 
Several "armchair quarterbacks" seemed to think Theismann 
called Gatewood's number too often Saturday. When your top 
receiver is open, why throw elsewhere? 
Although Gatewood had just recovered from the flu, he 
made the Northwestern defenders look mighty sick. 
Denny Gutowski won't forget the first play of his varsity 
career. The first time the powerful back from Hobart, Ind., 
carried the ball for the Irish he was injured and had to be 
carried from the field on a stretcher. 
Ponder this -Ever notice that the Vikings always wear 
horns? 

I wish someone would explain to me why the Big. Ten 
ruled that the Northwestern game, which wasn't sold out and 
drew just · over 50,000 people. was· televised, whiie we will 
haw to go to the Convo to watch the Michigan State Game 
which is sold out and will draw 90-plus thousand. 
Those of you watching on TV Saturday afternoon missed a 
fine defensive show by Clarence Ellis. The Irish All-American 
candidate handled touted Wildcat receiver Barry Pearson with 
ease. r 
You also didn't get to see new cheerleaders Carol Cullen 
and Rooney Frailey. They made a routine second )lalf much 
more pleasant. 

Any doubts Irish fans may have had about the abilities of 
the offensive line should be erased after Saturday's fine show­
ing. Newcomers Dan Novakov, Mike Martin, John Dampeer and 
Mike Creaney and veteran Gary Kos looked sharp. 
Larry DiNardo's in a class by himself. He opened some 
holes in the Wildcat defense that the shuttle bus could have 
driven through. 

I've seen Theismann look better in the passing department 
than he did against Northwestern, but any quarterback who 
directs his team on touchdown marches of 75, 75, 71, and 70 
yards is certainly getting his job done. 
On the eve of the first home game one of the big questions 
being asked on campus is "Who's going to replace Tom Allen 
as the Stripper?" Now that boy had great moves. 
I may be wrong but 1 think an awful lot of people are 
going to want a fieldhouse rally Friday night. And anyone 
who thinks the large block of stone in the building is going 
to stop things has never seen a fieldhou<;e rally. 
Will the Vikings carve Ara's likeness into the hunk of rock? 
It looks like Purdue's "quarterback well'' has finally run 
dry. Chuck Piebes had just 55 yards passing against TCU, 
hardly in the Griese-Phipps tradition. 
I'd take the vengeful Irish by three touchdowns in the 
home opener against the Boilermakers. NOBODY beats Notre 
D~tme four straight times. 

In the pro circuit, the weekend saw one of the truly odd 
occurences of our time. Both the Patriots and the Bears won. 
The Pack is back -back to the days of 1958 and humilia­
tion on the field. 

The Amazing Mets seem to have run out of miracles, after 
dropping 3. of 4 to the Pirates last weekend. 
The Cubs are staying close -wouidn't it be great to sec 
Ernie Banks in a World Series? 
I really don't see why there's such a big fuss over the NL 
East race though. Does it really make that much difference 
which team is crushed by the Big Red Machine?
