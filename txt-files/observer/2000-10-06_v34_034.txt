OUT FOR A WHIRL 


Students react to study day situation 
By lAURA ROMPF 
Assistant News Edicor 

For the past two years, junior Patrick Brennan has enjoyed having four consecutive study days before a five-day week of stressful finals. Brennan said he was able to prepare himself thoroughly for his tests and also had time to spend with friends before leaving for Christmas break. 
"Finals are the most stressful time of the year," Brennan said. "I feel we need enough time to pre­pare." 
However, for the 2001 fall semester, students may no longer have four consecutive study days. Because of a rule set by the Academic Council, the school year cannot start before Aug. 22. If a normal final schedule were used for the 2001 cal­endar, finals would not be completed until Dec. 
21. Because this date is so close to Christmas, the Academic-Council has suggested a new finals week schedule. Classes would end on Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2001 and two study days would follow on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday and Saturday would be finals days followed by another study day on Sunday and then three consecutive days of finals. 
Several students agree with Brennan, saying they need a transition time between the end of classes and finals and thus do not like the pro­posed schedule. 
"I will miss four consecutive study days," said junior HJ Roberts. 'Tm sure a lot of engineers use all four days to study. I'm going to miss the tran­sition day to relax. Last year the night before study days was one of the most fun nights because I didn't have to worry about studying just

Pax Christi hits crunpus to promote 01ilitary spending cut 
By TIM LOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 
A young woman dressed as a clean-shaven Uncle Sam looks up at a 27 -foot inflatable bar graph representing United · States defense spending. 
And while Uncle Sam boasts about American military supe­riority, her counterpart, Shawna Farabaugh, describes our nation's less impressive rankings in categories like infant mortality and education. 
This was the scene Thursday afternoon in O'Shaughnessy's Great Hall, where Pax Christi held a demonstration calling for those positions to be brought a little closer together. 
"We can't have national secu­rity without quality education and health cam for all our citi­zens," Farabaugh said. 
The event was part of the Pax Christi "Bread Not Stones" bus tour, a 30-city journey across the country to raise awareness of military spending and pro­pose a 15 percent cut in our nation's defense budget. 

Thursday, the bus came to Notre Dame. 
The group gave two presenta­tions and an acoustic concert, in O'Shaughnessy's Great Hall. After the presentations, the bus riders, along with Notre Dame Pax Christi members and inter­ested onlookers, held a talk on Catholic Social Teaching and 
U.S. military spending. 

The event illustrated the $271 billion that the government spends on defense each year with a big ini1atable bar graph. in scale with the defense bud­gets of China, Russia and our other "potential adversaries" ­North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Syria. Cuba, Iran and Iraq. According to figures from the General Accounting Office, U. S. military expenditures double what all of those countries spend, combined. 
This, according to Farabaugh, gives good insight into our pri­orities as a society. 
"It's like the national check­book," she said. "You can tell a lot about a person by looking at their checkbook. They spend money on things that are important to him. What we choose to prioritize in our fund­ing says a lot about what we value as a nation." 
The group wants America to change its spending priorities, cutting 15 percent of our defense budget and putting the money into programs for edu­cation an<l health care. They said that money could provide health coverage for all 11 mil­lion uninsured children in this country, completely fund Head Start and hire 200,00.0 new teachers nationwide. 
"What we're trying to do is get people to recognize what's possible with only a 15 percent cut in military spending," Farabaugh said. 
The cuts would not signifi­cantly diminish our military capabilities, the group said, pointing to waste that could easily be prevented. 
"We'll still have the strongest military in the world," said Eric LeCompte, leader of the bus group.

INSIDE COLUMN 



Put yourself on the line 
There's no day but today. 

That's one of the refrains in the musical "Hent." Throughout the show, the characters search for that which eludes them -happiness. Ycl they're afraid lo lake the actions that might deliver happiness. 
Roger. for example, is des­
perately in love with Mimi, 
but because his previous 
girlfriend committed suicide, 
he doesn't want to risk going 
through the pain of another 
broken relationship. So he 
mopes along, wishing he 
could be with Mimi, too 
frightened to tell her his true 
feelings. 
Too often, I think most of 
us follow Roger's lead. 
We say all we want out ol' 
life is to be happy, but then 
let cold feet prevent us from 
going af'ter that goal. It's so 
much safer to settle for a state or semi-content­

ment rather than risk whatever fragile peace we 
might have by aiming for something a little bet­
ter. 
Ii' lhings am going well. why should I risk los­
ing that by putting myself on the line'? Sure, I 
might wind up being the happiest person in the · world. But what if I fail? 

I've always thought I would love to do a year or 
two of service before moving inlo the 
"real world" and getting a job working for a 
newspaper. But now that I'm actually a senior, 

it's scary. Maybe I won't be able to find a job as a 
sports reporter after taking a year off or writing. 
I mean, I might suddenly forget how to form a 
sentence. I might not remember that a basketball 
team plays five people at once or that a touch­

down equals six points. Maybe editors will throw 
my application out the window when they don't 
see any articles published within the past year. 

Maybe I would be better off just taking the first 
newspaper job that comes along. At least I'll be 
assured of a paycheck coming in. 
Or maybe I'm just paranoid. 

Down the road, I know I'll regret not taking the 
chance to volunteer or travel when I was young. 
I won't be able to pick up and move across the 
country or around the world when I'm 40 years 
old with a husband, kids and a stable job. 

It's not just seniors either. In one way or anoth­
er, we're all afraid to put ourselves on the line. 
We're too timid to let our true feelings be 

known. Telling someone that you see him or her 
as more than a pal might result in a great rela­

tionship, but it also might strain the friendship if 
the feelings aren't mutual. So we wait in silence 
for Cupid to come along and create a romance. 
We're too comfortable to venture outside our 
circle of friends and meet someone new, espe­
cially a person of another race. ft could be the 
chance to get familiar with a different culture 
and learn about experiences different than our 
own, but making the first move is too awkward. 
So we complain that race relations are strained 
at Notre Dame, meanwhile continuing to sit at 
our segregated dining hall tables. 

By looking at the potential downfalls instead of 
the upsides, our anxieties cripple us. Just 
because life isn't terrible doesn't mean we 
shouldn't try to make it better. Perfect bliss 
might be out of reach, but it's a worthy goal. 
Take a chance. 
There's no day but today.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA 
Hospitals ban rape contraception 
PHILADELPHIA 
Many Catholic hospitals across the nation are not discussing contraceptive options with rape victims brought into their emergency rooms, according to a recently published University of Pennsylvania study. Despite the nationwide standard of mentioning contra­ceptive options when discussing treatment with these patients, the results of a Penn pilot study -published in the September issue of the American Journal of Public Health -showed that some Catholic medical centers prohibit the discussion, prescription and distri­bution of emergency contraception in the treatment of rape victims. Women treated at these hospitals "think they have gotten all the standard medical care and in fact they have not," said Jon Merz, a faculty member at Penn's Center for Bioethics and senior author of the study. "Women who have been traumatized cannot make an inquiry, and failure to tell them [about differ­ent options] is abandonment." Catholic theology upholds birth control as equivalent to abortion.

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
Top labor leader bashes NYU 
NEW YORK 
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Wednesday that New York University has been arrogant in its dealings with local labor organizations and may be breaking the law in its fight against graduate assistant unionization. "NYU is saying it's OK to treat some employees one way and other employees another way," Sweeney said at a rally of more than 500 union supporters at Judson Memorial Church. "NYU is saying it's OK to break the law when it is convenient for them." The statement about breaking the law alludes to grievances the United Auto Workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] against NYU. The union contends the University's use of e-mail to inform the community about the GA union was against the law. Sweeney's comments come as NYU's clerical workers union negotiates a new contract with the University. The union, Local 3882, is demanding an 8 to 10 percent wage increase, new health and safety grievance procedures and a "closed" union shop.

Author, aluIDnus relllinisces at 'flag raisers' book signing 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
James Bradl'ey's book "Flags of Our Fathers," a Ne,-v York Times Best Seller grabbed not only the attention of the Notre Dame community at Tuesday's book talk and signing, but also of Steven Spielberg who recently bought the movie rights. 
Bradley, the son of one of the "nag raisers" at Jwo .Jima, reflected on the experiences he discovered while researching and writing his book. 
"[My Dad I was a good man, he loved his fam­ily and was .devoted to the Church, [but] we didn't see him as a hero," hP said. 
Although Bradley and his family knew that his father was part of the famous lwo Jima "flag raising" photo -the most reproduced image in photography -Bradley, Sr., rarely rel1ected on his World War II experiences. 
"l just saw some guys struggling with a pole and l jumped in to give them a hand," Bradley l'requently recalled his father saying. 
llowever after his death, Bradley discovered tlrnr£' was more to the story than his father led him to believe. 
"[These events) became more alive for me after my Dad's death. I was allowed to think about them." he said. 
After the funeral. Bradley discovered three cardboard boxes in his father's office. "We were surprised to find that Dad had saved 50 years of memories of Iwo Jimo [within those boxes)," he said. 

From these documents, Bradlev learned that 
his father  was awarded the Navy Cross for  
lleroism.  
"My nad  was  able to keep it a  secret from  

his wife and family for half a century," Bradley said. 
This discovery led him to hegin contacting surviving marines and their families present at Iwo Jimo during the 36 day battle. 
As he n1searched, Bradley was surprised to find how little was known of the nag raisers. 
"Nobody knows who these guys are. You can walk around the monument [at Arlington National Cemetery] all day and not find their names," Bradley said. 
The nag raising marked the beginning of the vvorst battle in the history of the U.S. l\farines. The Marines battled 22,000 Japanese troops entrenched ln 16 miles of underground tunnels on a five mile island. 
Bradley's father's company suffered 84 per­cent casualties. 
"l\ly Dad probably held, in his arms, 200 guys who died at lwo Jima.... It's something you want to forget," he said. 
However Bradley was quick to point out the good produced from the battle and the flag raising photo it produced. . 
"The beauty of this photo has become that these guys .. , are us, ordinary Americans.just doing their duty," he said. 
"We have a chance to be ordinary heroes to our families 1 friends and community too," Bradlev said to the audience. 
Bradiey, who attended Notre Dame, holds a degree in Eastern Asian history. 

TONY FLOYD /The Observer James Bradley spoke to an audience at Hammes' Bookstore about his father's experience In lwo Jima before signing the book he authored.

Dalloway's new clubhouse opens 
like the feel of it." 
The Oubhouse will have limited hours today from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and will serve a portion of what the normal menu will be. 
"This week is a 'soft opening'," Kirwan said. "We'll have limited offerings until we get everyone up on schedule and trained." 
"The mentality of this weekend is to give you a chance to come in and peek," Kirwan said. "We're trying to get it open and let folks come in and see it." 
The Oubhouse was built in con­junction with the new Welcome Center that has been operational since late in September..The new structure was added to the Master Plan when concerns about the location and structural stabili­ty of the old Dalloway's Coffeehouse arose. One of the goals of the project was to main­tain the look and feel of the old building while making the neces­sary improvements. 
"The important thing people ask is if it sticks with the theme and mission of the old club­house," Shaffer said. "It does." 
When fully operational, the Clubhouse will serve mainly as a coffeehouse for students and staff. Both Shaffer and Kirwan explained that. the design of the building and planning of the menu were focused on a coffee shop atmosphere. 
In addition to that function, however, the building will be available for use by student groups. Shaffer explained that when students are on campus, the building may only be reserved by students for use. 
"It is a student building," Shaffer said. "It's to be used for students only. Only on breaks can other groups reserve the build­ing." 
A grand opening ceremony is scheduled for Nov. 10 during the fall meeting of the College's Board of Trustees. There is also a cere­mony scheduled for the opening of the Welcome Center during that meeting. 
Normal business hours of 11 
a.m. to 11 p.m. will begin on Monday, but the full menu may not be available for about a week. 
By MOLLYMcVOY Saint Mary's Editor 
Another step in the Master Plan announces its completion today when the new Dalloway's Clubhouse opens its doors for the first time. 
"Everyone is always excited 
about a new place," said Teresa Shaffer, assistant director of stu­dent activities. "In addition to the students, I hope there is also a lot of faculty and staff that come over to eat and hang out." 
'Tm excited," said Kevin Kirwan, the director of dining ser­vices. "(Dalloway's] has a neat look to it, and I think people will

Bobcrts also said he isn't looking forward to taking finals on a Saturday. 
"I can't imagine taking a test during the weekend." he said. 
Tiffney Colon. a junior, said she doesn't want finals week to last longer than it has to. 
"I think people need time to relax and take a break before the completely strossful week of finals," she said. 

Orientation committee and RA's already have to come back so early and pushing the date back would hurt them," Hauch said. 
"We need compelling rea­son why students want a fourth study day. We need good arguments to tell the Academic Council." she added.

said she would rather start school earlier because she likes having four consec­utive study days that leave some time for relaxing. 
"I wouldn't like the new schedule. Personally I like the way it is now," Gale said. 
Although some have said school should start before Aug. 22 to avoid the new schedule, student senator Melissa Hauch said there are reasons why the specific date is set.

students more time to prepare. 
"Over the past two years, I've learned that the math tests are usually at the end of the week, so it might actually give us in engineering more time to study," Roberts said. 
But overall, most students say they prefer the current finals schedule over the pro­posed one. 
"I think it's good to have transition time," Brennan said. "I don't like that. I think it's better when all the study days are in a row, because then you have more time to study your notes and read­ings thoroughly."

movement was inspired by a statement released by U.S. Catholic bishops in Mareh call­ing on the government to redi­rect our national spending pri­orities away from defense and towards education and health care. The bus tour began in Los Angeles in early September and will wind up in Burlington. Vt., on Nov. 2, the week before Election Day. Organizers hope to raise awareness of' the issue across the country. 
LeCompte encouraged the audience to work for a more equitable distribution of resources. 
"We believe that support for this massive Pentagon spending on weapons is a mile wide but only 1/2 inch deep," he said. "The challenge for all of us here, no matter where we came from, is to break the hold that the military industrial complex has on Washington, D. C." 
Attendance at the event var­ied throughout the event, which was originally to be held on South Quad but was driven inside by the rain. It was most crowded at its 4:45 p.m. start, when students leaving dass stopped to watch. Fewer people were present later, but organiz­ers said the event was success­ful, and they hope to build on its momentum. 
"What was most significant for us was to have this national Pax Christi event on campus and have people walk by and think about it," said Rachel Soltis, a leader of the club. "I hope it started people thinking and Pax Christi plans to contin­ue getting people to think."

dents and members of the community. 
"[Criminal acts] are going to happen. They are inevitable. We want to make it less likely that they will happen," said cor­poral Eldon Bradley. 
The first step to crime prevention is to be preparation, according to Bradley. Students should constantly be aware of the ever-changing environ­ment they are in. 
Bradley advised students to look behind them and not step off a porch before checking surroundings for sus­picious individuals. 
Additionally, neighborhood watch programs are in effect in most South Bend neighborhoods. 
"Neighborhood watch is one of the most successful means of preventing crimes in your neighborhood," said corporal Patty Byrd. 
"All of you can be on neighborhood watch. All we ask is for you to call the police when you see someone suspi­cious," said corporal Bill Schmidt. 
The watch systems involve a block captain who signs up to be aware or suspicious behavior in the neighbor­hood. 
Captains receive automated phone messages of felony arrests. assaults and burglaries in the area and are required to relay the information to 
neighbors.

"Do not walk the streets at 2 o'clock in the morning. You might as well put a sign on your head that says, 'I am a Notre Dame student. Beat me. Take my money,"' Bradley said.

Special to The Observer 
Juan Mendez, professor of law and director of the Center for Civil and Human Rights at Notre Dame, is featured in a new book that profiles figures from around the world who have stood up to oppression in the nonviolent pursuit of human rights. A PBS special airing at 7 p.m. Oct. 8 will dramatize the stories of these activists. 
"Truth to Power," by Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, describes the lives of 51 human rights activists, including Mendez, who was imprisoned and tor­tured in Argentina. The PBS program, "Human Rights Defenders," was taped at a recent Kennedy Center event that featured Chilean play­wright Ariel Dorl'man's dramatizations from the book. The program stars actors including Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver, Edward 
James  Olmos  and  Alfre  
Woodard.  
A  native  of  Lomas  de  

Zamora, Argentina, Mendez has dedicated his legal career to the defense of human rights and has a long and distin­guished record of human­rights advocacy throughout the Americas. As a result of his representation of political prisoners, he was arrested, tortured and subjected to administrative detention for 18 months by the Argentinean military dictatorship.

Cheney, Lieberinan spar over lllilitary, taxes and surplus 
Associated Press 
DANVILLE, Ky. 

Hepublican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joseph Lieberman disagreed firmly but polilcly Thursday nighL about military readiness, tax cuts and the future of Social Security in a 
gentlemanly debate or campaign under­studies. 
Sitting a few l'cct aparl around a small table, the vice prosidcntiaf candi­dates agreed that Prnsident Slobodan 


Milosevic should Lieberman give up power in Yugo::.la.via after an election loss, but both opposed the use of American troops to force him out. 
In a debate that ranged broadly over numerous issues, Lieberman, a two-term Connecticut senator, said Republicans want to "raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for their tax cuts." 
Hut Cheney said there was more than enough money to go around, and it is "totally reasonable" to give relief to all taxpayers. 
The argument that "somehow ... all of it is going to tax cuts isn't true," Cheney said of the huge surpluses forecast over the next decade. 
The two men sparred as they sat 

Bush, Gore say Milosevic must go 
Associ:1ted Press 
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa 

Presidential candidates George W. Hush and Al Gore agreed Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must relinquish power. 
Milosevic "needs to go" Bush said as he campaigned in the Midwest. Gore, campaigning in the same region. declared: "One way or the other, he is going to leave." 
Their running mates echoed ..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
those views in their televised 
debate Thursday night and 
both said they welcomed late 
reports that Milosevic's govern­
ment had collapsed. 
"We want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure," said GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney. 
His Democratic rival, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, said the demise of Milosevic's rule would be "a very happy ending to a terrible story ... the end of a reign of terror." 
In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, pro­testers took control of the par­liament Thursday, angry that Milosevic would not accept 
electoral defeat. Key Belgrade L:iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii;;;;;;;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii..iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii;;;;;;;iiiiiiiii;;;;;;.;;;;;;;;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii--;;;:J 
siln:; were left in shambles and Miloscvic's 13-year rule appeared to be at an end. 
Bush, deviating from an edu­cation speech at a public school near Detroit, said it was "clear the people have spoken. It is Lime for Mr. Milosevic to go." 
Later, he told a Wisconsin audience that Milosevic "needs l() go." Bush. the Republican candidate, said the protesters were acting out of frustration and "took matters into their own hands." 
"Our country must work closely with our allies in Europe, Lhe international com­

munity including Hussia, to pressure Mr. Milosevic to leave office," Hush said. "The world will bn a better place when he hears the word of his people and leavos his office." 
Gore, the Democratic candi­date, said he felt "in some ways joyful" at the sight of revolu­tionaries in Yugoslavia, but said the joy was tempered by the "volatile situation" in Belgrade. 
"It is obviously time for Milosevic to get out of power. One way or another he is going to leave power because what we have seen is the power of people who vote to express themselves in a decisive way," r;ore said in Grand Rapids,

together for their only debate of the fall campaign. The atmosphere on a special­ly constructed stage at Centre College seemed more relaxed than Tuesdav night when presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush met in Boston for the first of their three scheduled encounlers. 
Each man pledged to avoid personal attacks. Cheney took that one step fur­ther. "I promise not to bring up your singing," he said to Lieberman. 
That drew laugh­ter and a swift rebuttal. "And I promise not to sing," 
The two men debatr,d in a White House race that is as dose as any in the past four decades. Bush and Gore are sepa­rated by only a point or two in most polls, pointing to a suspenseful final month of the campaign. 
Asked by moderator Bernard Shaw about a public uprising in Yugoslavia designed to force out Milosevic, Lieberman and Cheney both said they hoped he would surrender power, but ruled out the use of American troops. Lieberman said a U.S.-led bombing cam-· paign last year had halted Milosevic's aggression. 
Cheney hearkened back to Tuesday 

Mich. 

The upheaval also became a topic at the vice presidential debate in Kentucky. 
"We want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve commit­ting U.S. troops," said Cheney. a former defense secretary. "I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort under way to get the Russians involved." 
night's debate. "There appears to be underway an effort to get the Russians involved," the former defense secretary said. "Governor Bush suggested exactly that ... and Al Gore pooh-poohed it," he added. "But now it's been reported in the press that in fact that is exactly what we're doing, that Governor Hush was correct in his assessment and his recom­mendation." 
Cheney added the situation was an opportunity to test President Vladimir Putin of Russia. 
"We ought to find out whether he is indeed· committed to democracy, whether he is committed to support the forces of freedom and democracy." 
The running mates reviinved well­worn campaign disagreements over Social Security. 
Lieberman said he and Gore have a proposal that would guarantee benefits to current recipients through at least 2054. 
He conceded that he had recently 
· investigated suggestions that individuals be allowed to invest some of their own funds. "Sometimes you have to dig deep to find out if there's oil in the well. I drilled into that, and the deeper I got, the drier the well became," he said. Bush has called for allowing younger workers to take control over investment of 2 percent of their own Social Security payroll taxes, a step he says would increase their total investment returns. 
Cheney endorsed that, and said Gore's proposal contained no overall reform to safeguard the future of the retirement program. 
When it came to defense readiness, Cheney said there has been an erosion during the eight years of the Clinton administration, and the Pentagon was "overcommitted and under-resourced." 
"With all due respect, this administra­tion has a bad track record," he said, cit­ing reports that some units were only permitted lo conduct live firing exercises twice a year. 
Lieberman replied that the United States was "ready to meet any cornmit­ment that might arise," and scolded Cheney for his comments in the midst of a political campaign. 
The two men reprised comments made Tuesday night by the presidential candi­datfls when the topic turned to HU-486, an abortion pill recently approved by the government for use in the United StatBs. 
Cheney said the FDA had already acted, and the only issue was whethnr the drug was safo. lie said he and Bush are "pro-life," and the Texas governor would look for ways to "reach across the divide to reduce abortion." 
Lieberman signaled his support for the FDA decision, and said there were fun­damental differences between the two tickets on abortion. 
"Al Gore and I will respect a woman's right to choose. And our opponents will not," he said.

Medicare to· pay for transplants 
. Intestinal transplants will now be covered in life threatening situations 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Medicare wiH now pay the cost of intestinal transplants, an operation that offers the only hope of survival for some patients, a federal agency announced Thursday. 
In a notice posted on its Web site, the Health Care f-oinancing Administration said Medicare would pay for transplanting new intestines into some patients with intestine failure, but only at hospital centers with a record of success in the procedure. 
The notice said it would apply only to patients with intestine failure who also have failed total parenteral nutrition. or TPN, a technique for feeding patients whose digestive sys­tems are unable to absorb nutrients. 
Only centers that perform at least 10 intestinal transplants a year and have a 65 percent one-year patient survival rate will be eligible for the Medicare payments, the notice said. 
Dr. Kareem Abu-Eimagd, a transplant surgeon at the UnivPrsity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a state­ment that the federal decision is an important victory for transplant patients. 
"Without the financial burden and associatod hassles, patients can now concentrate on getting well with transplants," said Abu-Elmagd. 
. In a February 1999 presenta­tion to HCPA, the University of Pittsburgh had requcsted that intestinal transplant be includ­ed in Medicare. 
The medical center had argued that survival rates for intestinal transplants were now comparable to rates for other types of organ transplants. 
Medicare already pays for most of the costs associated with many transplants of the heart, kidney, lung and liver. 
Lisa Rossi, a spokeswoman at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said that her center and 'at least two others, the University of Miami and the University of Nebrnska, Omaha, will meet the HCFA standard to qualify for Medicare payment for intestinal transplants opera­tions. 
Under the new rules, Medicare will pay for the trans­plant costs for patients with failed intestines who also have experienced complications from 

TPN. 

TPN is the only way patients with failed intestines~can be nourished. 
The technique involves sup­plying sugars. fats, vitamins and carbohydrates to the patient in a fluid that is dripped into a blood vessel. 
Ro·ssi said there are about 
40.000 patients in the U.S. being sustained with TPN and that about 13,000 of these patients eventually will develop life-threatening complications. A transplant is the only hope for survival for such patients. 
Because liver failure often follows intestinal failure, many patients rereive transplants of both organs at the same time. 
TPN complications include liver failure, blood clots and severe infections. 
All of these adverse events would make a TPN patient eli­gible for Medicare-supported intestinal transplants. 
Intestinal transplant opera­tions costs vary from patient to patient, but arc generally are a.bout $400,000 or more. 
For the rest of their lives, the transplant patients also must take an immune suppression drug that costs about $10,000 a year. 
Medicare may not cover all of the lifetime costs of the drug, Rossi said.

MIAMI, Fla. 
Thousands of people remained without power and hundreds of stalled vehicles sat on still-flooded roadways Thursday as South Florida began drying out after a two­day storm dumped more than 18 inches of rain. 
Most schools were open, but 15 stayed shut with flooded grounds or no power. 
The state of emergency imposed by Gov . .Jeb Bush remained in effect. 
President Clinton declared four counties disaster areas. eligible for federal help. James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is to visit the region Friday. 
Miami-Dade County officials reported more than 93,000 homes and an unknown num­ber of businesses stood in flooded neighborhoods and two people were killed by the Department. 
State agriculture officials said Miami-Dade farmers suf­fc red $500 million in crop losses. 
The governor released $100,000 in state funds to assist farmworkers, suddenly out of work because of flood­ing. 
About 2,600 homes and businesses remained without power, Florida Power and Light reported. 
Spokesman Bill Swank said many of those were served by buried lines and restoring all power might take days. 
At its worst, the flooding left about 92,000 customers with­out service. 
The storm moved well into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday where it strengthened and became Tropical Storm Leslie as sustained winds reached 39 mph. 
Forecasters say it could reach Bermuda this weekend but is not expected to become a hurricane.

SRI LANKA 
Suspected rebel kills himself, 12 others in explosion 
Associated Press 
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 

One day after Sri Lanka ended a peace ini­tiative to Tamil rebels, a suicide bomber set off an explosion near an election rally Thursday, killing himselfand 12 others. 
Police said 45 people were wounded, some of them critically, in the attack in Medawachchiya, a town 120 miles northeast of Colombo. 
Tissa Kraliyatha, a deputy minister, was campaigning for President Chandrika Kumaratunga's Peoples' Alliance at the time, but he arrived late for the rally and escaped the attack. 
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but a police officer in Colombo said it bore the hallmark of the Tamil Tiger rebels.

Editorial 
The primary poll con­ducted by MTV and the I lenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows increased apathy with only 50 percent of voters under 25 registered and only 46 percent of those registered planning to vote. 
Despite this apathy, the same poll showed that young voters have strong opinions on the election issues. With predictions of voter indifference directed at the college students' age bracket, it becomes even more imperative for Notre arc of value to stu­
dents' futures. 

Many of these campaign issues are fre­quent topics in campus discussions. Abortion rights, gun-control. student financial aid and Social Security have all gained a growing audience on these campuses because of the Catholic nature of the colleges and recent national events. 
Financing education is a tremendous expense to parents and to students, and the candidates' approaches to loans, savings plans and tax deductions are important. A percentage of student pay­checks goes to Social Security. Though students are paying now, there are no guarantees that the funds will be around when students retire many years down the road. 
There are numerous proponents of a woman's right to choose on both cam­puses. however. many more foel that abortion is wrong and should not be legally practiced. If students truly feel passionate about this issufi, they must speak out in the voting booth. 
The need for students to voice their opinions of today's issues and choose a candidate rellecting their belief's is important. But beyond that, a strong turnout at the polls by this age group is important for the future. If candidates sec that younger voters represent a large block of votes, they will more likely address issues relatod to younger voters in the future. 
Evaluating the first debate 
It ended in a tie. Each side declared vic­tory after the first presidential debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush. It was as though each candidate had kissed his sisters -this time without one being more passionate than the other. 
What some had touted as the clash of the titans turned out to be more like a conflict in the class­room. The class nerd who strains to answer every ques­tion had been rated equal to the !'rat boy whose academic deficiencies are masked by his class­room pranks and personality. It was as though both had eaten paste from the art supply -one because he liked it, the other because it fit his reputation of being mischievous. 
Obviously, each contender scored plus­es while accomplishing specific goals, but both were also awarded demerits for mis­stating facts, stumbling on presentation and exhibiting uneasiness and poor body language. The vice president demonstrat­ed that he is a detailed policy wonk who passionately puts his heart and soul into the debate process. On the other hand, the governor proved that he could hold his own on the stage despite some weak­nesses in details and his inability to con­vey humor. 
As usual, the debate simply reinforced notions the majority of viewers held about the two candidates prior to the event. In a post-debate poll, 96 percent had not changed their minds while only 3 percent admitted that the debate had changed their votes. Most of the undecid­ed voters needed to view another debate for more information or to further evalu­ate th'e candidates. 


Gore could have done better by limiting his expressions and reactions when Bush was speaking. Gore was under the impression that one of the ground rules of the debate had indicated that the non­speaking candidate would be off camera when the other spoke. Anyone accept the theory that another campaign mole selected the camera angles? 
Gore could have taken advantage of at least two situations much more effective­ly. First, when Bush said a "governor" does certain things during a crisis, Gore could have begun by saying, "Well, a president does these certain things dur­ing a crisis." 
Secondly, when Bush kept harping on Gore's eight-year failure of leadership to secure prescription drug coverage and other accomplishments, Gore should have said, "Let me tell you what we have accomplished by extending across the isle and working with Republicans. We bal­anced the budget, reformed welfare, passed the Brady gun control legislation and major crime prevention legislation." 
Bush too could have better taken advantage of certain moments in the debate. 
He should drop references to Gore's "invention of the calculator," fuzzy math and Gore's personal credibility, especially since Gore has effectively portrayed those as personal attacks. Polls in Michigan have indicated that 48 percent of voters believe Bush is more negative compared to only 28 percent who call Gore's cam­paign negative. Undecided voters despise negativity, regardless of whether or not the perception is justified. 
The governor also needed to better defend his tax cuts in response to Gore. 
He let Gore pound the "highest one per­cent receives 43 percent of the tax cut" phrase no less than seven times through­out the evening without passionately countering the point. And at times, Bush failed to string sentences together to coherently articulate his views. 
While all polls showed Gore winning the debate in the minds of the public, Bush adequately survived the debate and exceeded expectations. Since Bush's expectations were so low coming into the first debate, polls show that he favorably surprised at least a third of' the viewing public. However, the downside for him now is that he has proven he can stand on the stage, and a future gaffe will be more devastating for him compared to one in the first debate when tlw public exp,iCted him ·10 do worse thari hi~;" perfor~ mance. 
The bottom line for Bush is that his task is more di!licult as the challenger. In order to convince voters to "kick the scoundrels out," he must articulate com­plicated issues more corrnctly and more effectively while avoiding a backlash from the voters. l le cannot suggest that the Russians help negotiate when they hold difforing goals than we do. Most impor­tantly, he cannot continue to tie in the debates, which is an advantage to Gore. 
While the next two debate formats are less formal and theoretically favor Bush. substance will play an important role during those events. Women who favor Gore's positions have provided the advan­tage thus far. Gore's direct appeal to them in the first debate positions him to pull away in the polls alter the second debate. Like it or not, the class nerd is currently leading the frat boy in a presi­dential contest where substance is presently outpacing personality.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Taking steps to further race relations on campus 
Earlier today while studying, I couldn't help but overhear an interesting conver­sation a couple tables over concerning one Notre Dame student's 'ethnic heritage and the obstacles she faces to gain acceptance in the white-dominated culture of the U.S. and particularly on the Notre Dame campus. 
I realize that I am in the cultural and social majority here at the University. I'm your average white guy. So while I can't relate first hand with social issues that a minority at Notre Dame may need to deal with, I'd like to think that I'm at least appreciative of a minority's struggles on such a white dominated campus, and I acknowledge the difficulties of such a student here at ND. 
However. after listening to parts of the conversation I was dismayed at the stereotypes and generalizatioris the student was making about white Notre Dame students. Throughout the conversation, the student commented that the white stu­dents here are not as appreciative of their education as minorities are, that white students are not as morally strong as the minorities, and that white students are lazy. 
Furthermore, she said that white Notre Dame students are arrogant and ignorant and that they always seek the easy way out instead of striving for personal growth. 
I am sure that students of this description exist on this campus, in fact [ know some myself, but for this woman to make such a generalization is ridiculous and completely counterproductive. It is insulting to me for her to question my moral fiber or my motivation, and it is insulting to claim that I take my education for granted simply because of the color of my skin. 
The purpose of this letter is not to start a controversy, but rather to point out (to myself first and foremost) just how much work race relations need here on cam­pus. It saddens me to think that such remarks could come from a young women who is the president of her ethnic organization. 
To this person, please realize how counterproductive it is to hold such stereo­types when seeking to dispell your own racialstereotypes and gain acceptance for who you are. How can you ask others to drop racial stereotypes if you are not will­ing to do so yourself? 
And to the rest of us, the fact that students at Notre Dame do hold these opinions means that maybe it's time we took race relations into our own hands. We all should seek to learn about and gain acceptance of other ethnicities than our own. So the next time you hear about a student cultural festival going on, I sincerely ask you to consider attending. 
Without such effort, race relations aren't likely to improve.

der of yore. Indiana Daily ls He speaking Student through prophets? No! Writing on stone tablets? Of course not. These davs, God chooses to commu­nicate with.his children via billboard. The Almighty apparently is also a fan of mouse pads, magnet.c;, hooked rugs, welcome mats, screen savers and (gulp} bumper stickers. I guess God's PR team thought he needed to get with the times and adopt a new "millennium" image. That whole omniscient thing just wasn't cutting it anymore. Accordingly, God has jazzed up his delivery since Biblical times. This time around, God has developed a taste for sarcasm, veiled threats and tongue-in­cheek humor when dealing with his creation. Here I am, a lifelong Christian, pas­sionate about my faith -can it be that I've been misguided about my God all along? Did I miss the God boat? I thought he was wise, compassionate, loving, peaceful and kind -and now He turns out to be annoyingly trite? I am sadly disappointed: Apparently, God has gone back on that whole "free will" thing. He's not into personal rela­tionships anymore. Nowadays, he's into shoving his sarcastic message down our disenchanted throats. It's a sad day for humanity when God is glib. Either God has changed a lot in the past five years or so, or someone else is using his name. Maybe I shouJd have done some investigative reporting before writing this column. I could call up the ad agencies mass producing his "mes­sages" and the billboard companies plastering his name all over town. Perhaps he did stroll into a bumper sticker company and order the mass­production of cute phrases such as "Don't make me come down there." As if he's not down here already! "Your body is a temple ... right?" ­God. "See you Sunday." -God. Maybe God really does take time out of his busy schedule to put up big signs stating "Is that your final answer?" Because I'm sure he watches "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" to break up the monotony of being an omnipotent 
being who created the universe and loves everyone. 
Or maybe I'm right, and God's new smart aleck ad campaign is really the work of humans. I'm not saying that spreading God's message is bad -I'm just saying perhaps it's not wise to put words into God's mouth. 
Really, is it fair to sign God's name to anything? IfI plastered a billboard up in town that said "Hey, Coach Knight ... r;orne back! -Myles Brand," I'm sure I'd get into all kinds of trouble. Just because you slap someone's name on a catch phrase doesn't mean it's true. We're talking legal issues here, people. I think it's high time God sued for libel. 
There are many ways to communi­cate God's message of peace and salva­tion without stooping to zingy one-lin­ers on bumper stickers. 
Perhaps friendship, fellowship and investing personal time are better ways to spread God's love. While some might think these God ad campaign messages are thought provoking or funny, others are turned off by sarcastic comments about one's spiritual life or lack there­of. 
rdon't want anyone to turn away from God because they view him as domineering or threaten­ing. As a Christian, I think such ads misrep­resent my views: God does not pander to popular cul­ture, at least in my expe­rience. 
He is some­times subtle, sometimes unmistakable, but ~n every way effective without resorting to being glib an pushy. 
If God has something to tell mankind, I'm sure he will find a way to do so.

University's endowment doesn't need to be increased 
In my opinion, the article of the crisis in Notre Dame's finances announced by Father Malloy gives rise to some serious questions. 
First, how much of an endowment will satisfy Father Malloy'? The figure of 3 billion in the endowment fund leads one to think that Notre Dame will not be satisfied until it reaches the amount of the federal debt. 
Does father Malloy wish to be the wealthiest university in all the world? Or does he expect the alumni to give eternally to Notre Dame? As it once was said, "what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose its soul?" Just wondering.

Most of us have seen him -the infamous man at the edge of the road. We have all pondered his purpose at this point in his life. What is it, exactly, that possesses an elderly man to sit on the side of a highway, sur­rounded by flags, waving to passersby? 
If you're anything like I am, your initial reaction to this sight was extreme amusement, followed by intense curiosity. And perhaps there was a sneaking suspicion of some sort of lunacy lurking beneath those flags. 
Vpon realizing that this pillar of the South Bend community was a permanent fixture -weather per­mitting -on the east side of State Route 933, I set out to uncover the mystery of the man known affectionate­ly by students flanking both sides of his post as "The Flag Guy." 
Who is this valiant man who, day after day, year after year, sits watching the world go by? Just what compels him to do so? This patron saint of north-and southbound traffic is none other than Brother Edward Courtney-a retired Holy Cross Brother. a World War II veteran. ex-salesman and sage who readily espouses the knowledge his 82 years of living have afforded him. 
One pursuit, however, extracts perhaps the most time and energy from Edward's life -his vigil held on the side of the road. For 11 years. he has staked his nags and his folding chair in that same spot and waved al the traf­fic passing by. He does this in honor of the American nag, "Old Glory," . the same nag for which he and others fought in WWII. This tradition began in 1989 in response to a decision handed down by the U.S. Supreme court regarding the burning of the American f1ag. 
In 1984. a man by the name of Greg Johnson burned the l1ag at the Republican National Convention in Dallas. Texas. The burning was in protest of the United States· lack of support for the indigent and poor of the world. Johnson was arrested and charged, and the Texas Court of appeals opened the case of Texas vs. Johnson -a case so controversial it made its way to the Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, it was ruled that the desecration of the American flag was in keeping with the free speech clause of the first amend­ment and was beyond prosecution. 
What the court called a "symbolic action" on Johnson's part, along with the decision of the court, did not sit well with Edward, a man who had not only served his own country in war. but in ministerial efforts towards helping other countries. 
Following the ruling, Edward bought his first flag to show his displeasure and to bring the people together. In the same way that Johnson originally used the American flag as a "symbolic action," Edward has used the flag as his own symbol. a testament to the power and influence one person may possess. 
The history and progression of Edward's life and fair-weather, peaceful protest fill a glass case within the sitting room of Columba Hall. Among the tattered leaves and browning envelopes lie pictures of a young Edward Courtney at bat, standing with his brother, his senior yearbook picture, too. Here you can find letters. awards, discharge papers, Army bars, honorary citi-­zenships -even a note handwritten on gold-stamped Air Force One letterhead from President George Bush. 
"In 11 years. the enthusiasm hasn't changed," he says. There are bound volumes of letter he has received voicing people's support, and many more are delivered each year. 
Overwhelmingly, the positive responses to Edward's subtle statement woven in the cloth of his flags have been emphatic. "Some people bring me food and something to drink," he. says. "Lots of people stop just to talk to me. They can all solve their own problems; they just need to find some­one to listen." "And one time, when I fell asleep in my 
chair, someone called security," he adds. "I woke up to ND security shaking me and asking me if I was alive. Then, next thing I knew, there were ambulances and sheriff's cars around me. All I did was fall asleep!" 
The negative responses Edward has received tend to come in the form of obscenities shouted by young men hanging out of passing vehicles. "I just wave and giye them the thumbs up just the same," Edward explains. "If there's one thing f learned as an umpire, it's that you never respond in kind. Plenty of people will be rude to you. You just have to turn it around on them." 
No matter what the instance, Edward keeps an opti­misti.c outlook. Once, when he forgot to bring his flags and chair home at night, he returned in the morning to find them gone. 
"I don't really mind," he says, "as long as whoever took them got good use out of them." 
Though some may not agree with his beliefs, none can argue that Edward brings smiles to the faces of South Bend travelers each day he is there with his flags. This alone is enough for him. "You don't have to be a big d·eal; you don't tiave to have a Ph.D. or an 
LL. B. or be the president to be able to influence peo-

The sight of Edward and photohis flags has come to rep­resent more than just his AMA beliefs to many people. For Edward, it is no longer a sole crusade for Old Glory that he leads; it is a min­istry for the people who stop to speak with him. request his prayers and elicit his counsel, and serves to back his strongest belief -not that we shouldn't allow the desecration of the flag, but that we should never underestimate the power of one individual. 
"People see the flag and it's going tu influence them. When they see the lone figure sitting there. it's going to influence people for the good," he says. 
Edward never expected to be the public figure he is today. But he tries to use his appearances on televi­sion and covers in various media to continue to influ­ence people positively. 
As Edward passes the hours in his well broken-in chair. he fights fatigue with smiles, and boredom with the comfort of honks and waves returned. He lives his

Edward if he were beginning to show the first signs of wear after all he has accomplished. 
Back in 1941. Edward was a young man with a high school degree and a job as umpire for a semi-profes­sional baseball team in Portland, Ore. Come October of that year, a draft notice whisked Edward away to the European theater of WWII. After four years of service, Edward received an honorable discharge and returned home with eight medals and live bronze stars. 
When asked what then prompted him to enter the seminary, Edward's first response was "I don't know." After a moment's contemplation, however, he went on to explain that he always wanted to work with youth and that he felt the "good God" had directed his life thusly. 
"I just seemed to be set this way. going this way in my life, towards this kind of a life," he added. 
Edward, the third oldest of nine children in a Catholic 
family, had always known religion as a comfort. 
However, the assuredness with which he now 
regards his admission into the Junior Rate Academy 
seminary in Watertown, Wisc. was not always so 
clear. After three weeks in the school, Edward decid­
ed he could no longer take the life of a man of the 
cloth. As he ascended the stairs to retrieve his trunk 
full of belongings, he was stopped by a professor who 
had never before spoken to Edward. He felt it was "a 
providential occurrence" that found the Brother 
imploring Edward to stay another six months. He 
knew then that "God had something for me to do in 
this sort of a life, something no one else could do." 
Edward did stay; he took his final vows in 1947 and 
now celebrates 53 years as a professed brother. 
Edward spent several years at the novitiate in 
Rolling Prairie, Ind., before making his first move to 
South Bend. Edward knew he was not interested in 
teaching, so when an opportunity opened for a door­
to-door salesman for Ave Maria Press out of Notre 
Dame, he followed. 

After 20 years, he left this position to take on the 
task of commissioner at the all-male boarding school, 
LeMans Academy, in Ind. Ten years later, he made 
his final return to Notre Dame and joined the 
Brothers at Columba Hall. 

''I've had my ups and downs like anybody else, but 
it's been a very rewarding life," he reflects. "I was meant to go this way, to dedicate myself to the reli­gious life. It can be hard, though. When you make a commitment, it pinches sometimes. Married people experience that after the first few years; things begin to pinch. We Brothers understand. We all make com­mitments -married people, Brothers, Sisters. But once you make a commitment, there is no backing off" 
Now retired, Edward's days are filled with swim­ming, bicycling, stamp collecting and spending time with people. While he is sure the Brotherhood is his calling, he does not consider himself a highly religious man. 
"I don't know if I'm much of a Monk or anything," he says laughing, "but I belong with the people because my life is dedicated to the people; wherever they are, I am always available." 
In our conversations, Edward regaled tales of stu­dents, University employees and fellow veterans with whom he has maintained contact over the years. He even told of the one brush with romance he had with a younger girl before he was drafted. 
"She was a wonderful girl and we had a beautiful relationship," he reminisces. "But she hardly said any­thing. I never knew what she felt. Then I went away for the war, and she found someone else she liked bet­ter, I guess. That was the one little bit of romance I had. Boy, she was beautiful. I think I'll try to find her when I go back to Portland next." 
"See? I just like to keep up with people, you know. I care for them," Edward added. For Edward, people are his livelihood. 
As I sat speaking with him and the other Brothers at Columba Hall over dinner the other evening, I was not so much impressed by Edward's 11 year vigil for Old Glory. What impressed me more was the intelligence and easygoing nature of this man with whom I kept company. The meeting with Edward was far from what I had expected. I thought I would be speaking briefly to a man regarding that which he is most rec­ognized for -the flags. 
Instead, I found myself discussing life, politics, love and religion with a man who spoke assuredly from experience far greater than I have encountered before. Now, in retrospect, what strikes me the most from our talks is not the decorations and accomplish­ments of Edward as a veteran, not ihe service as a Holy Cross Brother but the advice he gave as a human. 
"We concentrate too much on the negative things we do," he feels. "But you're influencing people's lives and doing more good than you really know. Don't ever think you're not doing anything worthwhile."

MEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Kangaroos look to pounce on Dawgs for playoff spot 
..... 
By JAMES VERALDJ, TODD NIETO and MATT HARRIGAN 
Spom W ri1crs 
Playoffs or bust? 
That is the question racing the Alumni Dawgs and the Keough Kangaroos when they meet Sunday. Both teams are approaching this as a must win game, a win they need in order to continue their season after fall break. 
The Dawgs are coming off a 13-0 loss to Keenan. while the Kangaroos were trounced by Dillon, 22-0. The losses left the Dawgs in a tie for sec­ond place, and the Kangaroos in fourth. 
Although Keough still holds the fourth and final playoff spot, it is just a half game up on Stanford and one game up on two other teams meaning a loss here could end its sea­son sooner then expected. 
"It is a must win for us," saitl Keough captain Ryan Yorkey. "We can't take the teams below us for granted. We need a win." 
In order to get that win, Keough needs to return to the combination of quarterback Andy !less and wide out Brian Adams. which has accounted for all of the Kangaroos points th1.1s far this season. 
Alumni will counter this offense with a strong, hard hitting defense that was sur­prisingly hit for two scores last week against Keenan 
Offensively, the Dawgs need to get back on track before it is too late. 
"We had a good practice on Monday. We got back to not complicating things," said Alumni quarterback Chris Cottingham. "We all came together and worked as a unit. We have the individual skills to compete, we just need to come together so we can dominate with our backs 
and receivers against Keough." 
Defensively, the Kangaroos are led by defensive end John Barber. They will be looking for a good performance from their secondary, as Alumni will try and take advantage of a solid receiving core. 
The key to victory for the Kangaroos is intensity, some­thing they lacked last week against the Big Red. 
"It will take intensily to win," said Yorkey. "We did not have it against Dillon; we got beat in every aspect. We will be successful if we have intensity. The mental aspects must come first. If our men­tality is set, then the physical will come." 
DIiion vs. Morrissey 
On Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Stepan fields. Dillon Hall faces Morrissey Manor in a match-up that will prove to be both exciting and enter­taining. Dillon llall comes into Sunday's game with a 3-0 record while Morrissey is still looking for its first win. 
Dillon's hopes of winning its fourth game of the season appear promising as wide receiver Pat Esper returns after he was sidelined with a hamstring injury. At 6-2 and 200 pounds, Esper is a threat to Morrissey's defense. 
Hunningback Jason Visner and quarterback Tayt Odom are also key offensive players for Dillon Hall. 
"This week, we will be focusing on the running game," said Dillon captain Joe Parker. 
Morrissey will prove to be a challenge to Dillon Hall despite its 0-2 record. Quarterback Mark Berndt and tailback Edward Hernandez

WOMEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Lyons faces Pangborn in must-win contest 
By BRIAN KRONK, LIA MIL­HOAN and JOE LICANDRO 
Sports Wrirers 
Lyons faces Pangborn in a do­or-die playoff situation Sunday at 1 pm at McGlinn fields. 
In order to qualify for the playoffs. Lyons must win, com­bined with either a Cavanaugh defeat of Lewis or a Pasquerilla East win against Howard on Sunday. 
Lyons faces an interesting challenge: if it holds Pangborn scoreless Sunday, it will enter the playoff picture with all three victories and all three defeats coming via the shutout. 
Whatever the outcome Sunday, Lyons is excited about its playoff hopes. 
"This team is definitely excited about a chance to win our last th~ec games," said Lyons coach Michael Barranda. "We are cer­tainly excited about our chances, as this is definitely a different team than before." 
Meanwhile, Pangborn enters Sunday with a disappointing record of0-5. 
Captain Erin Piroutek express­es some hope after Thursday's loss lo Lewis. 
"We played the best game of

Lewis vs. Cavanaugh 
Matt Lovecchio is not the only 
Notre Dame freshman quarter­
back who has a big game this 
weekend. The playoff hopes of

With a 2-3 record, Lewis' only 
chan?e of !Ilaking the playoffs is 
to wm this weekend against 
Cavanaugh at 2 p.m. at McGlinn

Nasrallah certainly has her 
work cut out for her because 
Cavanaugh boasts a strong 4-1 
record. Cavanaugh's only loss is 
at the hands of defending cham­

While Lewis is fighting to make the playoffs, Cavanaugh h~s already achieved a playoff b;1fth after Thursday night's 18-0 vtctory against Pasquerilla East. 
Cavanaugh is eagerly looking to make a strong run in the play­offs, but understands the impor­ta~ce of this week's game. 
We want to win this weekend to continue our momentum going into the playofls," captain Amy Szestak said. "If we win this Sunday, we will have Cavanaugh's best record in the history of our dorm." 
Szestak attributesher team's success to strong coaching and great team depth. . "We have a very good coach­mg staIT. We work really well together, and everyone con­tributes. Our defense has been str?ng all season only giving up pomts to Welsh," she said.

Both Off-campus and 
Pasquerilla West have had 
productive seasons. although 
m alternating fashion. 
Off-Campus started the sea­
son with a win and two ties 
and it enters Sunday's gam~ 
fresh off two wins against 
Farley and McGlinn. After a 
quick start to the season. PW's 
last two games have been 
scoreless ties, leaving them at 
2·0-3. 

"Entering the playoffs with 
three wins would be nice " 
said PW co-captain Amanda 
Gallen. "Our defense has been 
great all season, and the 
offense just needs a little 
spark." 

Gallen has been a staple on both sides of the field for the Purple Weasels. Joining her on offense are freshman quarter­back Leslie Scmhidt and tight end Kori Yelle. Yelle has allud­ed opposing defenses all sea­son for PW. 
Junior Kelly Dries has helped to make the PW defense something to be feared. Coach Tony Haldea has been happy with the team's effort. 
"Our defense has been phe­nomenal all year, reminiscent of the Minnesota Vikings' 'Purple People Eaters' of the 1970's. We're working on fine tuning the offense for the play­offs," he said. 
Beating Off-campus will be a formidable task for PW. Usually, 13 is an unlucky num­ber, but not when it's the total amount of points the Crime has allowed all season 
"We'.re taking this g~me just as serious as the others," said captain Marita Keane. "We've put together some good drives in ,the past few games, and we re looking to do the same thing here." 
The Crime offense is led by quarterback Jamie Stouffer and running back Francesca Delayo. 
Although Off-Campus doesn't boast the largest roster it remains effective because dr a number of ironwomen. 
"We have a solid core of

Badin vs. McGlinn 

The Badin Bullfrogs and the McGlinn Shamrocks will battle it out in· the last game of the regular season Sunday at 4 
p.m. on McGlinn field. . The contest will_ be extremely important to Badm, as it must win to retain a chance of advancing to the playoff round. In addition to a big win, the Bullfrogs will need to get some help from BP. 
If Badin wins. and BP loses 
against Walsh, the Bullfrogs 
will secure the fourth and final 
spot in the playoffs. However 
if the Banshees win, they wili 
advance no matter what Badin 
does against McGlinn. In the 
event that BP plays to a tic, the 
team that has scored the most 
points during the season will 
advance, because Badin and 
BP tied each other earlier in 
the year. 

"We know we should have won Sunday, but a key play at the end of the game killed us " 
B~di~. ca~tain Tiffany Colo0 n 
said. We II just have to play our best this week and hope things work out for us." 
McGlinn, meanwhile will be playing purely fo; pride Sunday afternoon. 
Mathematically eliminated from· the playoffs, the S~amrocks would like to get a wm to have something to build on for next year. 
"We'd just like to get a win to m~tch last year's record," cap­!.am Jamie Glosser said. 
Although we haven't won any g~mes this year, we are happy with the way our season has gone. We've got a lot of young players, and we've made some solid improvements through the year. If we can end the season with a win, it could really build some momentum for next year." 
Breen-Phllllps vs. Walsh 

Breen-Phillips and Walsh will face off this Sunday in a 
game that could make or 
break the Banshees' chances 
for a playoff berth. 
"We're not really sure where 
we stand right now in terms of 
the playoffs," said Breen­
Phillips quarterback Katie 
McFarland. "There's been 
some speculation as to how 
teams will be chosen, because 
so many of us have such simi­
lar records. Right now, we're 
assuming that if we lose. we're 
out." 
Walsh. on the other hand 
will take a nothing-to-lose atti~ 
tude. 
"We don't need the win to 
make Ithe playoffs]." said 
Walsh receiver Kay Scanlan. 
"But we've tied in the past cou­
~le of g~mes, so we'd really 
hke a wm to help keep us in 
high spirits headed into the 
playoffs." 
The regular season play of 
both the Banshees (1-1-3), and 
the Wild Women(2-0-3), has 
been characterized by 
extremely strong defensive 
squads. 
Walsh. however, has seen their relatively young offense mature into oneof formidable strength. and it plans to con­tinue to rely on the plays the Wild Women have been run­ning well into the playoffs. 
"I don't think we'll be mak­ing any major offensive changes," said Scanlan. 
The Banshees. on the other h_and. were switching up offen­sive strategics as recently as their last game. McFarland believes they will continue to do so. 
"We're going into the game with a different focus, a couple new plays," she said. "We'll try to focus on our strengths." 
Though the Banshees need the win more so than their opponents, they aren't running scared. 
"We'll expect Walsh to be on the same level as us, especially as far as defense is con­cerned," McFarland said. 
The Wild Women, too, are ready for battle. "We'd really like to finish strong," Scanlan said. The game will take place at 3 
p.m. on McGlinn Field.

MEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 
Ramblers battle Rabid Bats in regular season finale 
-
By JOHNNIE LEITNER, 
KATIE DEMENT and COLIN 
BOYLAN 
Sports Writers 
For the Zahm and Siegfried inlcrball squads. this season has thus far been both the b1ist and worst of times. Both the Habid Bats and the Hamblers opened their years with explo­sive offenses and stifling defen­sive play. 
With the regular s1\ason near­ing a conclusion, though, both teams find thernsPlvcs in a vir­tual must-win situation. 
For Zahm. the year began on a grnat note, as the Bats posted a 45-0 victory. Aflcr a defeat al the hands of Fisher Ila!!, Zahm recorded their s,11.:ond win courtesy of' a f'orl'cit. i\s a result team captain Brian Zant said his unit is still cager to rr.deem itself after watching Fisher conw from behind. 
"We still haven't played to the best of our ability," Zant said. "We want to assert ourselves as a hard-hitting team and show some character." 
For Zahm, its duel with Siegfried will be the last regu­lar season game of the year. With a victory, the Rabid Bats would improve to 3-1, ensuring them a spot in the playoffs. 
"We take it one game at a lime. We don't want to look ahead and falter !against Si'egfriedJ," said Zant. 
From Siegfried's perspective, victory this Sunday is also criti­cal. The Ramblers slipped to 1­1 after losing to Knott last week, and must win to control their own playoff destiny. 
"We were too predictable against Knott." said Travis Smith, running back and cap­tain for Siegfried. "We want to catch Zahm olT guard." 
Smith, who attributed last week's defeat to an early deficit, hopes that his team will return to early-season form, which featured Smith's versa­tile running attack. 
"We'll be a lot better," Smith said. "Not the same team that showed up last Sunday." 
Both Zahm and Siegfried 
view their game as the continu­
ation of a fierce rivalry. 
"Our games are always tight. 
and Zahm plays their best 
against us," said Smith. 
According to Zant, this year's seniors have seen some heated battles between these two teams. Three years ago. Zahm pulled out a win. In the follow­ing season, Siegfried was victo­rious against Zahm in the regu­lar season. only to be eliminat­ed in the playoffs by its north­quad nemesis. 
ln this crucial clash of two interhall he avywc igh ts, Siegfried expects to open strong and play inspired foot­ball. 
"This team has a lot of char­acter," Smith said. "We need to show it against Zahm." 
On the opposing sideline, Zant sees the keys to victory to be maintaining intensity and finishing strong. · 
"We need to get down to business and play like we know we can," he said. 
Sorin vs. Carroll 
After the 0-0 tie between Sorin and Fisher last weekend, the Otters may face some diffi­culty when it comes down to the playo!T standings. 
With one more win, however, Sorin has a chance to make it to the playoffs once again. 
"I can't see why we would not win the rest of our games," said Sorin captain Mike Crowe. 
The beasts of Sorin (1-0-1) and Carroll (0-3) go head to head on Sunday's last regular season game before the play­offs. 
"We are planing to take this game seriously," said Crowe. 
Regardless of the final score Sunday, the Vermin can't make the playoffs because of a forfeit last Sunday against Zahm. The Vermin didn't have enough players after several injuries and scheduling connicts. 
"We are just glad we had a team this year, and I am confi­dent in next year's team," said Carroll captain Gregg Polk. 
In the near future Polk said the offense is getting ready for Sunday. 

-
"We know Sorin likes to pass the ball, we are expecting that.and are prepared," he said. 
The Vermin offense is what 
Polk plans to work 011. 
"This weekend I just hope tho offense will come around and we are working to turn things around this game," hr. said. 
Fisher vs. St. Edwards 
When Fisher Hall takes the field against St. Edward's this Sunday at 1 p.rn .. the Wave will have one thing on their mind: earning a playoff berth. 
"If we win this one, I think we'll definitely make the play­offs," said Wave defensive line­man Dahx Marrs. 
A win against a struggling St. Ed's team would improve Fisher's record to 1-1-1, and place them among the many contenders vying for a top spot in the Gold league standings. 
St. Ed's, on the other hand, is looking to gain their first win of the season and holds onto only slim-at-best playoff hopes. 
"We're trying to improve every week and hopefully get a win this season," said St. Ed's quarterback Tim Greene. 
With an extra bye week to prepare for their upcoming opponent, St. Ed's feels more confident in their defensive prospects. 
"We heard that Fisher likes to run the ball, so we've been working on filling some of the gaps in our defensive line," said defensive back Chris Muhich. 
Running the ball is exactly what Fisher hopes to do. And despite a lack of offensive suc­cess, so far this year. they still pin their hopes on the success of running back Zach Allen. 
"We want to run it down their throats and crush them into the ground," said Marrs.

NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISONAL SERIES 
Franco's save leads Mets past Giants, 5-4 
Associated Press 
SAN FHANCISCO 

John Franco knew there was a reason he came back to the New York Mets' bullpen fur another season, a mason he kept playing the game after turning 40 last month. 
This was why. 
Franco, the last hero in a game l'ull of them, got the first playoff save of his 16­ycar career by striking out Barry Bonds to end the 10th inning nf New York's 5-4 vic­tory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday night. 
Arter .Jay Payton's go-ahead single in the top half, Franco did what Armando Benitez couldn't: Franco closed it out as the Mets survived J .T. Snow's game-tying, three-run homer in th11 ninth and cvPncd their best-of-five NL playoff series at 1-1. 
Franco has 420 earner reg­ula r-se ason saves but not much common ground with his teammates any more. Ile has a rnc!iner in front of his locker instead of a stool, and he's quick to change the club­house st<'reo when the youngsters put rap on the system. 
But his experience gives him a late-season poise on the mound that Benitez ­already scarred by numerous 
postseason mistakes 
doesn't have. 
Moments al'ter striking out Bonds looking with a delicate curveball and pumpii1g his fist in joy, Franco said his only concern was for his shaken teammate. 
"lle's our closer. The guy's a human being," Franco said. "He's going to make mistakes like we all do .... 11 was a team effort. that's all. Jay got the big hit, I got the big out. Saturday, it could be some­body else. 
"One of the reasons I came back was because I felt this team could win." 
Edgardo Alfonzo's two-run homC'f in the ninth off Felix Rodriguez had created a 4-1 lead. 
Al Leiter. who held the Giants to four in the first eight innings, gave up a lead­off dou!Jlc to Bonds in the bottom half. and Mets man­ager Bobby Valentine went to the bullpen for 13enitez. Jeff Kent reached on an infield single and, one out later, Snow launched the first pinch-hit homer of his career. The ball hit the facing of the walkway over right lield al Pacific Bell Park and landed mavbc two feet to the lel't of the.foul pole. 
"When I hit it. l just hoped it stayed fair.' Snow said. "Of course. none of that matters right now."

Belles play in Adrian College Tournament 

By KATIE MILLER 
Spnrr Writer 
Saint Mary's golf team will play at a tournament hosted by Adrian College Saturday. 
The Relics are currently third in the MIAA conference. AfLer finishing third overall last sea­son. the Belles hope to take sec­ond place in their conference at their upcoming tournament. 
"We are only live shots out of second place, just behind Hope," said golf coach Theresa Pekarek. 
Pekarek was pleased with the team's score last Saturday at the tournament hosted by Hope. 
"\Ve finished third with an overall low score of 350, our lowest ever," she said. 
The Belles are confident that their performance on Saturday will reflect their strengths. 
"We are a consistent team," said senior Natalie Cook. "Last week, a lot of the teams played really well because of the good weather. This Saturday, the weather is supposed to be terri­ble, but we are steady no matter what the weather." 
"We have a deep team. Kyle Veltri and Natalie Cook will lead the team, but we will rely on everyone," said Pekarek. "We've established a good team. We can rise to the occasion and get ahead of Hope in the conference standing." 
Players hope to play well despite the poor weather. 
'TU start the course with a play safo philosophy," said Cook. "I plan on playing smart golf despite the weather conditions." 
"Despite the bad weather pre­dictions, we have good team momentum going," said Pekarek. 
In the MIAA conference, Albion currently has first place.

NL DIVISION SERIES 
Cards go up 2-1 on Braves 
Associated Press  
ST. LOUIS  
Another of the Atlanta  
Braves' golden arms left  
Busch Stadium badly tar­ 
nished, putting the St. Louis  
Cardinals within one win of  
the NL championship  
series.  
Tom Glavine was pound­ 
ed for seven runs and six  
hits in 2 1/3 innings -his  
shortest outing in seven  
years -and the Cardinals  
beat the Braves 10-4  
Thursday to take a 2-0 lead  
in their best-of-five NL  
playoff series.  
"It came at a bad time,"  
Glavine said. "I needed to  
go out there and give us an  
opportunity to win. and I  
didn't do that."  
Will Clark overcame a 2­ 
0, first-inning deficit with a  
three-run homer, and Mark  
McGwire. limited to one at­ 
bat per game because of  
knee pain, limped out of the  
Cardinals dugout in the  
eighth to hit a pinch homer  
off Mike Remlinger.  
"What we were trying to  
do was go out there and get  
a good pitch to hit, basically  
the same thing that we did  
with Maddux," Clark said.  
"These guys are awesome  
pitchers. They're 20-game  
winners for a reason."  
Darryl Kile limited  
Atlanta to two runs and  
four hits in seven innings,  
striking out six and walking  
two.  
The reeling Braves are in  
danger of failing to make  
the NL championship series  
for the first time since  
1990. They head home hop­

HOCKEY 

Poulin's team reaches goals 
By MATT ORENCHUK 
Sports Writer 

When Dave Poulin became head coach of the Notre Dame hockey team five years ago, he set goals for the team. One by one. season by season, those goals have been ticked ofT. The Irish have made it to the CCHA tournament and they have played in Joe Louis Arena in the CCHJ\ semifinals. 
The biggest goal, however. is to win a national championship. To do that, Notre Dame will have to make the NCAA hockey tournament next April -some­thing the Irish have never done. The focus of the 20th-ranked Irish hockey team will be to build on the momentum of last season's trip to Joe Louis Arena in Detroit for the CCHA semifi­
naLi,. 

"We have been to the Joe [Joe Louis Arena!, we have had home ice [in the CCHA tournament). but bar none the NCAA's is where we want to go this year." said senior left wing Chad Chipchase. 
Standing in the way of the lrish's NCAA bid is a tough slate of early season opponents. Notre Dame begins its season this Saturday when they take on the 11th-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minn. 
"It's a big thing to be able to go up there and show [Minnesota] what Irish hockev is all about. We have put in the work over the last three weeks and we are going to be ready to play this weekend," junior center David Inman said. 
On October 13 and 14. the Irish will participate in the Nebraska Omaha Shootout, where they play fourth-ranked Boston College, and could possi­
blv meet 13th-ranked Nebra.'ika­
Omaha. And if that wasn't 
enough, Notre Dame has a home 
series . with fifth-ranked 
Michigan State and away series 
with 14th-ranked Lake Superior 
State and Nebraska-Omaha all 
before Christmas. 

With only one automatic bid from each conference, the rest of the teams make it as at-large bids determined by a selection committee. Notre Dame must make themselves look as good as possible. Poulin likes the chal­lenge of the early schedule. 
"With only one automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, we have the schedule which will enable us to do it (make the NCAA's]." Poulin said. 
In order to win, there will be several key questions that the Irish have to answer. Offensively they need to become more con­sistfmt. Poulin ls looking for that consistency to come from Dan Carlson. 
The senior left wing led the Irish last season with 35 points. Carlson is quietly making an impact in the CCI-IA, where he is ranked sixth in goals among active players. 
"Talk about someone who stepped it up, and took it to the next level, Dan Carlson did that last year. " Poulin said. Also important to the Irish offense will be captain Ryan Dolder. sophomore Connor Dunlop and Inman. Inman showed some flashes of talent last year and could impress some people, according to Poulin. 
"[Inman! could take it to a level that would make this team a very different hockey team," Poulin said. 
Defensively, the Irish will look to continue their tough defense of the past few seasons. To do that Notre Dame will have to rely on some talented but inex­perienccd players. as the top three defcnsemen from last year's team have graduated. 
Looking to Iii! those shoes will be senior Ryan Clark. junior Sam Cornelius and sophomore Evan Nielsen. The Irish will also look to some freshmen to step up and play major rolls, accord­ing to Poulin. 
"Even Nielsen and Hyan Clark have to be real good for us defensively. Sam Cornelius did not play a lot last year after play­ing a lot his freshmen year. And then we have the three kids. Komadoski. Lcbda and Galvin. and they arc going to get major rolls right out of the gate.'' said Poulin about his defense. 
The defcnsemen won't have to do it alone, as they will have sophomore goalie Tony Zasowski between the pipes. 
Zasowski played in 31 games last y{1ar, posting a 13-9-6 record. When asked how Zasowski would play this year without the benefit of veteran defenscmen, Poulin responded "Tony is a control guy. Last year was a nice transition for him having (four senior defenscmenl in front of him. but he is certain­ly ready to play." 
With the experience that Zasowski gained playing much of last season, he will provide a calm presence which should allow some of the freshmen to mature into solid defenders. 
At the start of this hockey sea­son all the cards are on the table. The Notre Dame hockey team knows exactly what it needs to do to reach their goal. With the depth of Irish, com­bined with the tough early sea­son schedule, it won't take long to ligure out if Notre Dame will be able to cross off another goal this April or if they will be sitting at home, wondering what might have been.

WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Irish travel to take on Hoyas,Wildcats this weekend 
By KEVIN BERCHOU 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team will be without one of its brightest stars this weekend when it travels to Georgetown and Villanova for successive Big East Conference battles. 
Freshman scoring-sensation Amy Warner. still recovering from a knee injury last week­end. will not make the trip east. ll looks as though Warner will miss the next several weeks with the injury. but Irish head coach Randy Waldrum is hopeful she'll return for the playoffs. 
"At this point, WC think she'11 be back for the postsea­son," Waldrum said. "We'll know more when the doctor looks at her again." 
Despite the mediocre records of both the Hoyas and the Wildcats, Waldrum is leery of' an upset.. 
"We try to prepare the girls for that possibility every game, every time we step on to the field," Waldrum said. "The way the soccer has been going this year, there have been a ton of upsets. It's something we have to be leery of." 
· With such a disparity in the 
talent level between the Irish 
and their weekend opponents, 
Waldrum is well aware of the 
style Georgetown and 
Villanova will play. 
"They're going to lay back," Waldrum said. "I think both teams are much improved from last vear. but I still don't think they'll take any chances. We just have to do a better job getting behind the defense." 
If Georgetown is able to penetrate ihe strong Notre Dame back line, they have scorers with the capability of convening. Senior midfielder Liz Delgado is one of the con­ference's top scorers, notch­ing seven goals th is season. 
Last year the Irish embar­rassed the Hoyas at Alumni FiCld, whipping them 10-0. Waldrum expects a tougher test this time around. 
"I think they're much improved, they're competing much better,'' he said. "Last year they really didn't have the talent to compete." 
The Hoyas do enter the game playing their best soc­cer of the season. Georgetown improved to 6-4-2 on the cur­rent season with an impres­sive 2-0 victory over Seton Hall, running their Big East record to 1-0-1. 
In a game that showcased their defensive strengths, the Hovas limited the Pirates to a single shot on goal in the game's first half. 
After tonight's game in Washington. the lrish will head to the City of Brotherly Love with high hopes of tam­ing the Wildcats Sunday. 
Villanova has struggled all season, but is coming off a 4­0 shutout victory against Rutgers, which improved its overall mark to 7-6-0. The Wildcats are, however, just 1­3 in Big East play. 

Kristin Dunst will lead a Jess than potent Wildcat attack. which has had diffi­culties finding the net all year. Dunst. the lone bright spot. has but four goals. 
After what Waldrum called a good week of training, and a productive team meeting, the Irish coach feels his team will enter the weekend refreshed and with renewed focus. 
"We're going to try to get back to some of the things we did well at the beginning of the season in big games," he said. "We want to play every game like it's our biggest one. I think now we're all on the same page." 
In order to compensate for the loss of Warner, Waldrum will play a frontline of Ali Lovelace, Amanda Guertin and Meotis Erikson all of whom have the ability to score. Waldrum anticip.ates no real drop off. 
"I think if Amy were healthy, we could start any three of those four and keep up the same pace," Waldrum said. "Without Amy, we do lose speed though." 
Waldrum is hopeful that in playing opponents of lesser caliber he will be able to work in some of his reserves.

VOLLEYBALL 
No. 20 Irish head east to take on Panthers, Mountaineers 
By RACHAEL PROTZMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame volleyball team will travel to Pittsburgh and West Virginia this weekend in its first conference games on the road. 
"I think this weekend is a chance for us to prove our domi­nance in the Big East," said sophomore Kearn Coughlin. "It's an opportunity for the team to show its character and our abili­ty to control the level of play on our side of the net." 
The No. 20 Irish, 11-4 and 2-0 in the conference, are coming off wins against Big East opponents Villanova and Georgetown. 
Notre Dame will face West Virginia for the eighth time. with the Irish leading the series at 5­
2. Nikki Hardy, who leads West Virginia this year with 185 kills, will pose a threat to the Irish. 
The Irish are looking for revenge following the 1998 loss in West Virginia, one of just two of Notre Dame's conference loss­es on the road since 1995. 

"We're going into West Virginia match remembering what happened two years ago and with the goal of silencing the Mountaineer crowd on their own court," said Coughlin. 
The Irish will look for their 14th win against Pittsburgh in the 17th time the teams will face each other. The Panthers are now 15-5 overall and 1-1 in the Big East. 
In its Big East season opener, Notre Dame defeated Villanova 15-5, 15-2, 15-9. Christi Girton led the Irish with eight kills while freshman Kristen Kinder added 16 assisl'> and five digs. 
Notre Dame finished off the weekend with a sweep of Georgetown (15-8, 15-6, 15-8). Girton led the Irish again with 16 kills, nine digs and four blocks. 
Girton was named Co-Big East player of the week for the sec­ond week in a row following the wins. 
.Junior Kristy Kreher leads Notre Dame on the season with 190 kills while classmate Malinda Goralski will provide a defensive threat with 56 blocks in 2000. 
"I think we'll be able to run a very quh.:k olTense. We'll be able to concentrate on the execution 
of  our  blocking  schemes,"  
Coughlin said.  
Notre  Dame  will  face  

Pittsburgh on Saturday before traveling to West Virginia on Sunday.

38. Like the score, the attitude of the competition changed, too. 
"The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's meet is basically a fun meet for us," said Tim Welsh, the 1986 Notre Dame swim coach, and current men's coach. 
Both schools used the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's dual meet to rotate swimmers into different events or concentrate OB quali­fying a few swimmers for the national competition. 
This trend was evident in other sports, as well. Although Saint Mary's usually won the early meetings between the two teams, as the Notre Dame women's programs developed, the Irish turned these once­close games into blowouts. 
Sport by sport. the Irish dropped the Belles from their schedules in favor of teams of Division I caliber. 
"We've put a whole lot or our resources into women's sports," said John Heisler, tht\ Notre Dame Director of Sports Information. "As long as we're going to compete in them, we might as well be good in them." 
Widening the gap 
The era of competition between the Irish and the Belles began when Notre Dame first admitted women in 1972. Because of Title IX and gender equity issues, coupled with the athletic department's desire to op al Notre Dame. While they were officially recognized as clubs, they still played other collegiate teams. 
The first time varsity pro­grams from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's competed against each other occurred in 1 Y76, when the Belles defeated the Irish 6-3 in the final tennis meet of the season for both teams. Saint Mary's won the first three meetings between the two schools, but the Irish earned their first victory in 1979. Notre Dame never lost to Saint Mary's after that date, winning 13 straight meets and. from 1981 to 1986, the last time the tennis programs competed, the Irish won every meet 9-0. 
l:lasketball saw much of the same domination bv the Irish. In four years of competition, the Irish held a 10-0 record against the Belles. However. in 1979, the Irish and the Belles faced each other in the semi-finals of the Northern Indiana District Tournament in what may have been the most significant meet· ing between the two schools. Notre Dame won 61-49 and eliminated Saint Mary's from postseason play. the first and onlv time the two schools have pla.yed P-ach other in a game with postseason implications in any sport. 
Volleyball remains the only sport in which Saint Mary's leads the all-time series. The two teams met for the first time in 1980, when the Belles won in straight sets. Saint Mary's won the first four meetings between the two teams. Notre Dame 

matches before competition between the two schools ended in 1983. 
Battles for excellence 
The closest games of the Irish-Belles rivalry occurred in soccer. In 1985, Saint Mary's soccer team became the first college program in Indiana to rise to varsity status. 
In their first game as a varsity squad, the Belles losL to the Irish 3-1. 
"I think we were too fired up for the game," said Katy Boldt, who scored the first goal for Saint Mary's varsity team. "There's always a lot of rivalry when we play Notre Dame, and we were too psyched up for lhe match." 
Saint Mary's got its revenge 22 days later when they beat Notre Dame 2-0 to record their first win as a varsity team. 
Considerable hype surround­ed the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community when the Irish soc­cer program reached varsity status in 1988. The area was captivated by the possibilities the rivalry could hold. The Observer reported in 1988 that the soccer games between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's "would determine Michiana supremacy in soccer." The first game lived up to the tremen­dous buildup as Notre Dame rallied from a 2-0 halftime deficit to win 4-2. Over the next three years, the Irish clawed their way to a 3-0-1 record over the Belles. 
The competition between the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame in 1989, Saint Mary's dominat­ed most games between the two schools. 
The highlight for the Belles came in 1985 when they defeat­ed the Irish 10-3 on their way to the championship at the Notre Dame Invitational. At first it was typical to see the Belles win by scores of 11-1. But when Notre Dame's program reached varsity status in 1989, the situa­tion reversed. The Irish won all four games played that year by an average of nine runs, In 1990, in one of the most memo­rable games or the Notre Dame­Saint Mary's rivalry, Irish pitch­er Missy Linn pitched a perfect game as Notre Dame won 1-0 in the final head-to-head meeting between any Saint Mary's and Notre Dame athletic program. 
Unbalanced rivals 

So why don't the two teams play each other any more? Several factors have con­tributed to the virtual disap­pearance of the rivalry. 
Scholarships have created an imbalance in the talent pool in both schools. As Notre Dame athletic programs grew in stature and national promi­nence, they could use athletic scholarships to lure lop high school athletes to Notre Dame. Saint Mary's, on the other hand, is a Division III school and therefore does not have any athletic scholarships available. 
Thus, as the Irish athletic pro­grams developed, Notre Dame would usually have more talent than their Saint Mary's counter­parts simply because athletes turn into lopsided affairs that the lrish would win time after time, as they did in 1981 when Notre Dame's basketball beat Saint Mary's 92-29 in what became the final basketball game played between the two schools. 
Another issue involves com­peting for national recognition. Heisler said the coaches arc responsible for scheduling deci­sions, and they usually schedule tough teams to impress high­profile high school athletes. 
"Recruiting is like an arms race," Heisler said. "Your sup­port systems are being mea­sured against other schools. If you want to show how good you are. you have to play high-cal­iber Division I teams." 
As the Irish women's sports programs continue to grow in athletic prominence, the chances of seeing a revitaliza­tion of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's rivalry arc shrinking. 
"There's a big commitment you have to make if you want to stay at the top of the pack," Heisler said "And if that means abandoning rivalries, that's what has to be done." 
So, when the 17th Notre Dame Relays kicks off this weekend, pay special attention the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's swimming teams. The two teams might de-emphasize the annual meeting, but both will secretly acknowledge that the rivalry still exists. As the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's rival­ry enters the new millennium, one thing is clear -the rivalry, though diminished, will not die.

MEN'S SOCCER 
Irish head to Rhode Island for key Big East match-up 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Ass1stan1 Sports Editor 
Carrying the burden of a 1-4 Big East record that currently has the team ranked 11th out of the 12 teams in the conference, the Irish mm1's soccer team faces a must-win game on Sunday when it travels to Rhode Island to take on Providence. 
The ganrn has important implica­tions for Big East tournament play. Only the top eight of the 12 teams in the Big East compete in the tourna­rrwnt, while the others am forced to sit at home. An Irish win would move them into competition for the final spot and give the team momen­tum heading into a stretch where each of the squad's next five games is against a Big hast opponent. 
"For us to get back on track. back into the swing of things with the Big East we rPally need to go to Providence and buve u big win," said senior captain Dustin Pridmore. "We need to keep momentum going so we can carry it through the rest of the season." 
The Friars will be looking to avenge a crushing loss to the Irish last year. In the game, Pridmore and then-freshman Erich Braun each scored two goals to lead Notre Dame to a 4-0 victory. 
At season's end, the Friars and Irish were tied for eighth in the con­ference standings with 10 points apiece. The Irish. however. made the Big East tourney because of their head-to-head win against the Friars. Pridmore feels that this will give Providence an added incentive on Sunday. 
"For us to get back on track, back into the swing or things with the Big East we really need to go to Providence and have a big win." said Pridmore. "We need to keep momentum going so we can carry it through the rest of the season." 
Providence is coming off of 4-1 loss Wednesday to second-ranked Connecticut. 
Junior forward Tom Blesso scored the lone goal for the Friars. Hlesso leads the team with six points this season, already matching his total from 1999. The Irish come in confi­dent following a 2-1 win over Northwestern on Tuesday. During the game -which was marked by a 40-minute delav in the second half when the power went out in Alumni Field -the Irish took 25 shots, including two goals by freshman Justin Detter. 
In addition to Dcttrr's strong play, Braun has been able to overcome a nagging hamstring injury to create quality shots in recent games. Junior Matt Rosso was ini;erted into the starting lineup for the Sept. 29 contest against Pittsburgh and has responded with strong play from the flanker position in the last two games. 
In addition. senior Griffin Howard has exhibited strong offensive skills as a starter. giving Irish head coach Chris Apple a multitude of scoring weapons heading into Sunday's important game. 
"I feel great, conlidcnt, the guys are playing well," said Irish head coach Chris Apple. "We have to get a win on the road. We're a better team, we have to prove it on the field."

CROSS COUNTRY 
Belles to 
ring in 
Goshen 
By KATIE McVOY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
This weekend's meet at Goshen College may turn out to be a battle of the freshmen. 
The young Saint Mary's cross-country team will face off against a very young Goshen team when they compete at the Goshen College Invitational. 
But head coach Dave Barstis expects some great things from his women this weekend. 
"I think [the womenl are feeling great," he said. "Practices have been strong and we are injury free. l expect some personal records at this meet." 
The young Saint Mary's team. that opened this sea­son with four sophomores and four freshmen, has had a difficult start. 
They finished s'eventh out of seven teams at their only home meet of the season two weeks ago. However, this week's flat course may prove to be a chance to start again. 
"This is a flat, fast course so I'd like everyone to have their best time of the sea­son," Barstis said. 
Goshen is also fielding a young team. With only two upper classmen running for Goshen, the Belles may have a chance to finish the race in a good place. 
"Last year we didn't have anyone in the top ten but . our pack running enabled us to get a 4th place finish," Barstis said. "We surprised a lot of teams." 
Although it's uncertain what teams will be compet­ing besides Goshen and Saint Mary's, it is probable that the same teams will return from last year. 
Bethel College, Adrian 
College. Hillsdale College, 
Grace College, Manchester 
College. Tri-State

''For a team in its third year, I think we're fairly competitive," said Stone. "We should be the top Big East team."

Kiernicki is confident for the weekend. "It's a first step toward putting Notre Dame rowing on the map," she said. "We're building ourselves as a threat."

ll has not always been this way. 
When the Irish were developing their women's athletic programs. they consistently played the Belles every season. 
However, as Notre Dame grew in athletic prominence and moved to the Division I level, it stopped competing against Saint Mary's. 
That does not mean that a rival­ry does not exist. Ever since the Irish women's swimming team reached varsity status in 1981, both schools looked forward to the annual Notre Dame-Saint Mary's swimming meeting. 
"There has always been a huge rivalry between the two teams in swimming," said Gail Casey, who swam for Saint Mary's in 1983.

making a championship by the host school unlikely. 
"It's a great competition," Notre Dame women's cross country coach Tim Connelly said. "Our biggest goal is to see how good we are. I think we're pretty solid, and what we need to do is see how we stack up against some of the best teams in the country." 
The Notre Dame women's squad captured the top spot a year ago, while the men fin­ished third. However. the level of competition is up a notch this year, while Notre Dame's teams were depleted by gradu­ation. 
"My goal would be to be in the top five or six," Connelly said. " We're not a team with a whole lot of margin for error. We're going to need our 'A' races." 
No. 1 Stanford heads the list of opposing women's teams, followed by No. 5 North Carolina State, No. 13 Michigan, No. 15 Arizona, No. 24 Duke and No. 25 Ball State. A total of 31 teams will com­pete in the varsity race. 

"It's by far the biggest meet we've ever had," Connelly said. "In fact, it's a little bit bigger than I would have liked." 
Top runner Jen Handley returns to action for the Irish after missing the National Catholic Invitational because of a sore foot. 
"I know it's going to be real­
ly tough competition," said 
Handley, a sophomore. " Last 
year, l was sixth in the race, 
but the competition is better 
this year. I just want to stay up 
there at the front of the race 
and hang in there as long as I 
can." 

Aside from Handley, the 
Irish will run their seven varsi­
ty runners from the National 
Catholic meet as well as senior

Hornets 
. Metzger makes 2nd start in net for Saint Mary's 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Sports Writer 
Saturday will be a battle of rookie goalkeepers as the Saint Mary's Belles travel to Kalamazoo to take on the Hornets for the second time this season. 
"(Goalkeeper] Laura [Metzger] has improved drastically throughout the season," said Tia Kapphahn, junior goalkeeper and for­ward. "We're much more sure of ourselves with her in the goal." 
Metzger will make her sec­ond career start in goal against Kalamazoo after her first solo appearance in the loss to II ope on Tuesday. Hornets goalie Adrienne Bellar cemented the 5-0 shutout victory over the Belles earlier this season. and will be looking for her second win against Saint Mary's as Metzger looks to redeem her team and earn her first collegiate win. 
"Everyone on the team has confidence in her," Adrian Kirby, junior midfielder, said. "Having her in goal lets Tia [Kapphahn, the Belles goalie at the start of the season] play in the field which benefits the whole team." 
Kapphahn stepped into the goalie slot for the 2000 sea­son after Brie Gerschick transferred after a solid sea­son in the net for the Belles. 
Kapphahn played forward for the majority of the 1999 season after spending her freshman year as the backup to the starting goalie. 
Kapphahn sees Metzger's netminding to be an advan­tage to the Belles in their second match against Kalamazoo. 
"I think when we first played Kalamazoo we came out really flat," the tri-cap­tain said. "A lot of the [play­ers] were psyched out. But this time we have Laura on one end of the field. which will help."

LoVecchio takes helm of Irish offense 
By KATIE McVOY Assistant Sports Editor 
The key word for the Irish 
this weekend is offense. 
Coming off of a disappoint­ing loss to Michigan State two weeks ago and a break last week, the offense will have to find new strategies to notch a win against Stanford. 
"As we move forward, we .all realize that w<>, have to open things up," head coach Bub Davie said at a press conference on Tuesday. ··we have to become a little more creative." 
t<ollowing three games in which his offense netted less than 250 yards each outing, Oavie wants to see a more potent running game. 
"rWe need] more productiv­ity on the ground," he said. "Not so much running it more, but being more pro­ductive." 
The rest of the calls may depend on quarterback per­formance. 
With Arnaz Battle out indefinit-,Jy, Davie· pegged freshman Matt LoVecchio as the Notre Dame starter and sophomore Gary Godsey as the backup. 
"I LuVecchio] gives us the best opportunity," Davie said. ''I'm anxious to see him play and I know kevin (Rogers] feels the same way." 
Despite the inexperience of both Lovecchio and Godsey, Davie believes that that past two weeks have provided some much needed experi­ence, allowing the young sig­nal callPrs to mature. 

"Those young players, all of the sudden, because we've had this situation for a cou­ple of weeks, are no longer young players," said Davie. 
With Lovecchio at the helm of the Irish offense, Notre Dame will be will be able to run the option. However, should Godsey have to fill in during the game, fans can expect to see the ball in the air more often.

in there," he said. "But cer­tainly the option part of it is missing." 
With a still unproven offense, Davie will be relying on a strong defensive unit to keep his team in the game against Stanford. Players who were unable to play last year have added the needed depth to the defense. 
"We've got some players back that we did not have last year," Davie said. "We've got corner Brock Williams fand] free safety Tony Oriver. 
I think we're able to do a few more things def'ensiVf'ly." 
Although the blitz was very cffectivl~ for Arizona last week against Stanford, Davie is not going to count on that as his main defensive strate­gy. 
"I don't think it is in our best intorest to go in and just blitz then every down," he said. "They have seen a bunch of that stuff before, and they do a great job of throwing those jailbreak screens."

Against Michigan State, defensive end Anthony Weaver intercepted a Jeff Smoker pass and return,~d it to the 2-yard line, setting up a Notre Dame touchdown. Weaver has tallied 26 tackles on the season, including three sacks. Nose guard Lance Legree sits just behind Weaver with 22 tack­les.

EYE ON THE ENEMY 
2-2 Cardinal aims to rebound against Irish 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Sports Editor 
The Cardinal comes into Saturday's gam( like a fire­cracker -whether it will go off like a sparkler or a big~ time explosion is the ques­tion. 
Stanford's season has spiked up and down, with losses to San Jose State and Arizona, but victories over Washington State and No. 11 Texas. 
The Cardinal (2-2) does best against tougher foes, which could be dangerous for the Irish on Saturday. 
The Stanford defense limit­ed the Longhorns to 13 yards rushing. pick<'d up five sacks and 10 tackles for loss and tallied two interceptions. 
ThA Cardinal defense is on the rise, having improved in run defonse, pass defense, scoring dofonsc and total defense since last year. 
"It is a good football team that, you know, is capable of beating anyone," Notre Dame head coach Bob Davie said. 
"I'm sure they will rebound this week and play their best football gam<' of the year, and that's what we're counting on them to do. And that's why \Ve know that we have to raise our level of play in every area." 
Senior defensive lineman Willie Howard provides thP strongest front for the Cardinal. Howard was a first team All-PAC 10 selection a year ago. 
Another key cog in Stanford's success is wide receiver and kickoff/punt returner DeRonnie Pitts. 
The 5~foot-11 senior ranks in the top 10 i.n school history in receptions, yards and touchdowns. 
He already has four touch­downs this year, with 20 receptions for 247 yards. 
The Stanford rushing game, however, is a problem. It ranks even behind Notre Dame's at 89th in the nation. 
Like the Irish. the Cardinal faces major uncertainties at the quarterback position. Starter Randy Fasani under­went knee injury following

Stanford's victory against Texas Sept. 16. 
Since then. sophomore Chris Lewis is the go-to guy, but Notre Dame marks his first road game. 
Backing up Lewis is fresh­man Teyo Johnson, who also plays basketball. 
Notrn Dame tried to recruit Lewis and Johnson, but lost out in the hunt to Stanford. 
"T think it's verv similar," Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham said of the quar­terback situation. "I think he [Davie] is starting a quarter­back there for the first time, too, and he has to have all the right answers and do the right things with his quarter­back. It's very much the same." 
Willingham piloted the Cardinal into the Hose Bowl a season ago. 
He's not quite on pace for a repeat in 2000. 
·while the Irish just toiled through four straight games against top 25 teams, Notre Dame marks the first of five ranked opponents· for Stanford. 
. 
Notre Dame's early-season schedule ranks as the toughest in the nation, while Stanford's is No. 2.

Stanford's band is prohibited from playing on Notre Dame's campus after poking fun at the Irish in 1997.

12) during the Seminoles' 59-7 routing of the Terrapins Sept. 28. The Seminoles are 5-0 on the season. 
By PEYTON BERG Sports Writer 
Vinny Testaverde, Deion Sanders, Charlie Ward, Warren Sapp, Gino Toretta, Peter Warrick, and Wide Right I and II. The annual Seminoles­Hurricanes clash conjures up some of the biggest names and tightest moments in college foot­ball, not to mention guar­anteed National Championship implications.
