Authorities nab bank scam suspect 
Police in Fullerton, Calif., find 18 fraudulent NDFCU debit cards in man's vehicle 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
Authorities in Fullerton, Calif., arrested an individual Tuesday in connection with the e-mail scam that prompted more than 60 Notre Dame Federal Credit Union (NDFCU) members to give their credit card numbers and passwords to a swindler mas­querading as the credit union. 
Sgt. Tom Conklin from the Fullerton Police Department said a man was arrested Tuesday at 1 a.m. after the 
highway patrol pulled over the car he was in and found 18 fraudulent NDFCU debit cards inside. The man was driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen in Chicago. 
Conklin did not release the suspect's name, but he con­firmed the man is directly con­nected to the NDFCU scam that began Friday when users received a series of e-mails that redirected them to a mock-up of the credit union's Web site. Users were asked to enter their account numbers, passwords and security codes. 
NDFCU President Leo Ditchcreek said Tuesday more than 60 customers clicked on the fraudulent link to review their account information after an e-mail told them there were "one or more unsuccessful attempts to log in to your Online Banking Account ... from a for­eign IP address." 
Ditchcreek said at least five accounts were credited charges and withdrawals that added up to over $2,000. 
The credit union's technology staff tracked the origin of the e­mails and the illegitimate NDFCU Web site to a service provider in the Netherlands. The withdrawals, however, were traced back to the areas around Westminster, Calif. 
"The Web site was set up through a service provider in the Netherlands, but whether or not somebody in the Netherlands was involved in the scam is still unclear," Ditchcreek said. "The suspect was able to use the account numbers and security codes our members entered into the fake

PILLARS stops giving out BAC cards 
Campus group officials feared charts were misinterpreted as licenses to drink alcohol

Lawrence is an advisor to Peers Inspiring Listening, Learning and Responsible Socializing (PILLARS), a student organization that works to limit abusive drinking. The group decid­ed this year not to promote their "Green Zone" cam­

The  BAC  cards,  which  

were issued to freshmen in previous years, included a gender-and weight-specific chart that estimated a per­son's BAC based on the number of drinks consumed and the number of hours spent drinking.

Trasvifia addresses inunigration 
Speaker likens controversy to 'schizophrenia' in the United States 
By CLAUDIA 
BRAGA-HENERBY 
News Writer 
America's "schizophrenia" concerning immigration was a main theme in Wednesday's lecture by guest speaker John Trasviiia, an influential voice in the continuing debate over Latino immigration. 
Focusing largely on United States history and the continu­ing vacillation on immigration issues, Trasviiia's speech was a lesson in politics, history and acceptance. 
A piece of Trasviiia's schizo­phrenia theme concentrated on the welcoming of migrants into America. 
"Sometimes [immigrants] are welcome, and sometimes 
they're not, depending on their country of origin and the time period," he said. He cited Indianapolis as an example of a city that welcomes and helps immigrants. 
Trasviiia mentioned the city's high naturalization rate and the positive repercussions that has for a community. 
Trasviiia also focused on America's history regarding immigration policies and sen­timent-from the 1800s on -touching on various influx­es of certain immigrant groups. 
"The debate [on immigra­tion] needs to be elevated from a debate where we sim­ply scream at each other, into a national conversation about immigration," Trasviiia said. 
To the average Notre Dame student, immigration should be an issue to get involved with, Trasviiia said. 
"Immigration has far-reach­ing implications for every business, family and commu­nity . . . students will be enter­ing into a workforce of a more interdependent world." 
A native of San Francisco, Trasviiia graduated from Harvard University and went on to study at Stanford Law School. He has held many prestigious political and non­political positions, and is cur­rently the presi~ent and gen­eral counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).

to do so), I suggested we stil:k with a GP.

So, when time eomes lin· you to limnu­late your own (;p, you might rncall some of the following things Ilnarned (or wish I had known before) along the way. 
Inter-European travel: Student hostels and low-nJst transportation services makes securing the weekend getaway mw:h simpler with less planning time and tighter budgel<>. Ilowever, do your research beliJrn booking a seat on a sketchy-sounding airline like "Compania (.ow-Cost." Many discount t:arriers like EasyJet lly to unheard of "alternative" airporl<> for major cities that may be 50 milns away from the actual city. Double cheek to make sure that the $10 seat you bought isn't a cardboard box, either. Always carry your passport even for a domestic flight (!learned that the hard way). 
Nightlife: Admission into dubs is expensive, but drink f(Jes are exorbi­tant. Since most clubs don't get packed until around 2 a.m., stick to bars before and you'll still have money in the bank. If you are in big groups, enter by stag­gering; otherwise bouncers won't let you in because of overcrowding. 
Post-party: You may return to your inexpensive hostel at 7 a.m. and kiek yourself upon discovering that some do not provide towel<> or bed sheets free of charge. Some also have eurfews, so if. you call it an "early night," at 4 a.m. and miss the deadline, you'll be banging oul<>ide the door and be mistaken for the drunken village idiot. 
My best advice ean be heeded before departure. Gather everything you plan to take with you, unpaek half, and leave it at home. Airlines are no longer gen­erous with baggage allowances. Leaving room in your bag prevents you from worrying about paying extra bag­gage lees for all of the sweet schwag you bought for your friends on your inward journey. Plus you'll be too broke to pay them anyways.

POCATELLO, Idaho ­Anita Ovard moved to her small home in this town in the western foothills of the Rocky Mountains because she wanted to see more wildlife. But the view got a little too close when a moose decided to make itself at home in her front room. 
Ovard spotted two baby moose in her yard when she pulled into the drive­way Tuesday. She immedi­ately started looking for the mother moose, spotting the massive animal just before it plowed through her storm door and front door. 
"There's a big gouge, and you can see where the whole front of the [moose's] body went right through it. It broke the wood frame," Ovard told the Idaho State Journal. 'Try telling that to an insurance company." 
Shoppers browse unstaffed Colorado store 
NORTHGLENN, Colo. ­They could have left the tree completely bare. But some honest shoppers at an unstaffed Dollar Tree store must have decided that honesty was the best policy while searching for bargains on Labor Day. 
About 15 shoppers walked through the front doors of a closed Dollar Tree store Monday after a lock on the doors mal­functioned. 
They also didn't see, or ignored, a sign on the doors indicating the store was closed for the holi­day. 
Northglenn Police spokesman Ian Lopez says one woman became suspi­cious when there was no one at the register to ring up her purchase, so she called authorities.

Jessop presented a PowerPoint presentation on "Senate 101" for the new senators. "The real power is at the Academic Council, not the Senate," he explained, "but the Senate has the capacity to lobby on issues that concern the faculty."

The meeting opened with cama­raderie, as professors exchanged repeated cordial greetings. An open­ing prayer followed, in which Jessop asked God to "grant us grace and humility in our discussions."

Nevv book calls for an active response to global terroris111 
Special to The Observer 
The two Notre Dame scholars whose research demonstrated -before the Iraq war-that it was highc ly unlikely there were weapons of mass destruc­tion in Iraq are co-editors of a new book on counterter­rorism.

the position that brought me to Notre Dame." 
The specific responsibili­ties associated with being acting dean, however, are yet unknown. The position did not exist until recently when the University split the Office of Research from the Graduate School, Holland said. 
"We took one position and divided it into two," Burish might. 

"The punish-and-destroy model is not the answer," Lopez said. "Despite six years of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, terrorist attacks and suicide bombings are on the rise. Diplomatic strategies can and do work effectively, but they have been overshad­owed by the constant drum­beat of war." 
"Uniting Against Terror" examines diplomatic and economic responses that have worked since the ter­rorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, especially those of the United Nations, the Financial Action Task Force, the European Union, and a wide array of multilateral 
said. The two positions cre­ated by the split are the vice president for research and the dean of the Graduate School. The current vice president for research is Professor Robert Bernhard. 
During his time as acting dean, Holland hopes to improve conditions for graduate students living, studying and working at Notre Dame in the hopes of "attracting better and better graduate students," he said. 
The next step is to find someone to fill the position permanently.

The book includes a fore­word by former U.S. Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, co-chair of the 9/11 Commission that studied in-depth the rise of al-Qaida. More recently, Hamilton co-chaired the Iraq Study Group. 
"Lopez and Cortright have done a huge service to all those interested in pursuing the pros and cons of an activist foreign policy, short of the recourse to war," said 
A. Peter Burleigh, former 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
"We are now going to do a national search for the dean of the Graduate School," Burish said. 
In the coming weeks, the Graduate Faculty Council will elect a search commit­tee to fill the position. The hope is that the new Dean will benamed in July 2008, Burish said. As for whether Holland will be a candidate for the permanent position is "totally up to him," Burish said.

"The individual that was arrestnd [Tuesday in Fullerton[ had in his possession 18 difl'er­ent cards with some of our mem­bers' debit card numbers," Ditchcreek said. 
Conklin did not say whether the man was still in custody, nor what charges were or could be brought against him. Conklin also said he did not know if the suspect had any accomplices. 

And though the man was directly tied to the NDFCU scam, Ditchcreek said the police didn't know yet if he was responsible for sending the e-mails or setting up the illegitimate Web site. 
The e-mails that went out were directed to a combination of students and the general pub­lic, NFCU members and non­members alike, Ditchcreek said. The origin of the e-mail list that was used is still unknown, he said.

Israel accepts Darfur refugees 
JERUSALEM -Israel will grant citizenship to some of the hundreds of Muslim refugees from Sudan's violence-ridden Darfur region who have already arrived, Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit said Wednesday. 
Sheetrit said he would work with the United Nations to set a quota of refugees who would be naturalized. While he estimated 300 Darfur refugees have come, other government offi­cials and refugee advocates put the number at between 400 and 500. 
The arrival of the Darfurians has touched off hot debate over whether the Jewish state, founded after the Nazi genocide, has a duty to take in people fleeing persecution. Fighting between pro -government militias and rebels in the western Sudanese region of Darfur has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 2.5 million since 2003. 
lbree Muslims arrested for bomb plot 
BERLIN -It was just a vacation cottage sitting in a small town. the quiet hometown of 900 peo­ple. 
But inside, prosecutors said Wednesday, three men were readying a nefarious plot-an "immi­nent" bombing aimed at Americans in Germany. 
The cottage didn't provide the refuge that the trio expected, authorities said. They had been watched constantly for six months in a mammoth surveillance operation involving 300 security offi­cers. before an elite anti-terror unit swooped down on them at the cottage Tuesday. 
The men -two German converts to Islam and a Turkish citizen who prosecutors said shared a "profound hatred of U.S. citizens." -allegedly obtained military-style detonators and enough chemicals to make bombs more powerful than those that killed 191 commuters in Madrid in 2004 and 52 in London in 2005.

U.S. Magistrate Christopher A. Nuechterlein said Tuesday that Kevin Rieder, 38, poses a dan­ger to the community and does not seem to be a good candidate for release based on his record of not complying with prior court orders. 
Rieder faces a federal charge of illegal possession of ammunition in violation of an earlier restraining order taken out by an ex­girlfriend.

Hurricane tolls rise in Latin America 
Central America deals with impacts from Felix, Mexico prepares for Henrietta's second landfall 
Associated Press 
PUERTO CABEZAS, Nicaragua -Doctors threw together a makeshift clinic Wednesday to tend to the injured after powerful Hurricane Felix flooded their hospital and wrecked villages on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. Remnants of the storm drenched Central America in rain and the death toll rose to nine, with at least 11 peo­ple missing. 
Far to the northwest, Hurricane Henriette took aim at Mexico for the second time in two days, moving toward the port city of Guaymas with top sustained winds of 7 5 mph. Seven deaths were reported from the Pacific storm, which hit Baja California on Tuesday. 
Nicaragua was flying food and other emergency sup­plies to the regional capital of Puerto Cabezas, but said help had not yet reached villages cut off when Felix roared ashore Tuesday .as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph. 
The dead included a man who drowned when his boat capsized, a woman killed when a tree fell on her house and a newborn who died shortly after birth because her mother couldn't get med­ical attention. 
Among the missing were four fishermen whose small sailboat sank as Felix's cen­ter passed overhead. A sur­vivor, Fernando Pereira, 24, said he clung to a piece of wood for 12 hours, despite a dislocated shoulder, and washed ashore at the village of Sandy Bay only hours after Felix made landfall there. He hadn't seen his friends since. 
"I felt horrible," he said. "I was drinking salt water, and I thought I was going to die." 
Others were caught in the sea as well. Jelivaro Climax, 22, said he had to swim through enormous waves to reach shore. 
"Lightning flashed through a pitch black sky," he said. "I don't know how I survived. I swam with everything I had, and I was sure the sea would

take me." 
Felix swept over the Miskito Coast, an impover­ished region where about 150,000 people live in jungle settlements. Their hamlets of wooden shacks and coconut groves are remote even in good weather, reachable only by air or flat -bottom boats. 
The Miskitos, descendants of Indians, European settlers and African slaves, live semi­autonomously, much like people on Indian reserva­tions in the U.S. 
There wasn't enough fuel after the storm for boats to make long trips, and Felix snapped steel cables that guided a small ferry carrying people and cars from Puerto Cabezas to the village of Wawahum.

Wrestler's injuries may explain killings 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Pro wrestler Chris Benoit suffered head trauma from his years in the ring that could help explain why he killed his wife, son and himself, a doctor who studied his brain said Wednesday. 
The analysis by doctors affiliated with the Sports Legacy Institute sug­gests that repeated concussions could have contributed to the killings at Benoit's suburban Atlanta home, though there was no way to know for sure. 
"Whether it is the sole factor, I believe, is speculation, and I will not go there," said Dr. Robert Cantu, a member of the Waltham, Mass.­based institute, which researches the long-term effects of concussions. 
The level of brain damage Benoit had could have caused depression and irrational behavior, said Cantu, who also is chief of neurosurgery service at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. 
The wrestler's father, Michael Benoit, said Wednesday he agreed to the testing of his son's brain because murder-suicide was so out of character. He said his son com­plained about suffering concussions, but that he knows of no medical records or records kept by the wrestling league to support the diagnosis. 
Steroid use also has lingered as a theory behind the killing~. since anabolic steroids were found in 

Chris Benoit's home and tests con­ducted by authorities showed Benoit had roughly 10 times the normal level of testosterone in his system when he died. 
Some experts believe that use of testosterone can contribute to para­noia, depression and violent out­bursts known as "roid rage." 
Dr. Wendy Wright, an intensive care neurologist at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta who was not involved in the study of Benoit's brain, said multiple concussions could cause long-term brain injuries, but the symptoms were unclear. 
"This isn't something you would expect to see turn on one day and have someone fly into a vicious rage," she said.

IN BRIEF 
FAA orders inspection of new 737 jets 
WASHINGTON -Federal regulators ordered inspections of the wing slats on all newer Boeing 737 jetliners based on find­ings about the fire that destroyed a China Airlines 737 in Japan last week. 
The orders apply to the owners and oper­ators of 783 U.S. airplanes but will likely be imposed by other countries on the entire worldwide fleet of 2,287 newer 737s, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Les Dorr said Monday. 
Dorr said the move was prompted by the fire in Japan and one other incident. 
The FAA's emergency airworthiness direc­tive, issued Saturday, applies to all 737­600, -700, -800, -900 and -900ER series planes, the first of which entered service in January 1998 with Southwest Airlines, which flies only 737s. In the United States, the planes also are used by Alaska, American, Continental, Delta and other car­riers. 
Business owners returning to school 
NEW YORK -As the fall semester begins at colleges and universities across the coun­try, thousands of small business owners will be among the students. Many people who run their own companies realize they need to learn more about finance, marketing and managing, and so they decide to squeeze courses into their already tight schedules. 
Peter Figueredo, CEO of NETexponent, a New York-based advertising agency, had run the company for three years when he real­ized he needed to learn more about operat­ing a business. 
"I know the actual type of advertising and marketing we do extremely well," Figueredo said. But "how to manage people, set up an infrastructure, finances, human resources was still something very new to me." 
So in 2004, he began a three-year pro­gram on entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Besides classroom learning that led to his being granted a certificate from MIT, he came away with a network of other small business owners who he still turns to when he needs help or advice.

U.S. mortgage crunch expanding 
Declining home prices and rising interest rates creating national nightmare for homeowners 
Associated Press 
OCALA, Fla -The walls are bare, the closets are empty, and Connie and Timothy Pent and their two teenage children are living out of boxes as they wait for a dreaded knock at the door of their three-bed­room house in Ocala, Fla. 
They've fallen behind in payments on their home loan, and their lender told them in July that foreclo­sure was imminent. 
"We thought we were fine," said Connie regret­fully. "You never know." 
An increasing number of homeowners and prospec­tive homeowners are get­ting caught up in the fast­spreading mortgage crisis that is claiming victims from all income levels and demographic groups. Like the Pents, many are trying desperately to get their loan terms reworked but are finding it's difficult in a tightened market. 
For five years, the hous­ing boom put money in the pockets of lenders, brokers, realtors and investors and granted easy mortgages to homeowners with both good and blemished credit. But as home prices decline and interest rates climb, the cracks in the housing market's foundation are widening.

Panel refuses to disrrriss co111plaint against Craig 
Senator launches campaign to stay in office 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -To the dis­may of fellow Republicans, Sen. Larry Craig launched a deter­mined drive to save his seat on Wednesday, vowing to stay in oiTice if allowed to withdraw his guilty plea in a men's room sex sting. 
Craig's campaign suffered ~n instant setback, however, when the ethics committee refused to set aside a complaint lodged against him. "Pending Sen. Craig's resignation, the commit­tee will continue to review this matter," the committee's senior senators wrote. 
The decision to deploy his legal team marked a reversal of his pledge to resign on Sept. 30, and

rnct decision. thn dif'licult but 1:orrnct decision to resign" over tlw wnekend. said Senate Hnpublican Leader Mitch McConnpll of Kentucky after he and Craig spoke by telephone. "That would still be my view today." 
Craig made no public state­nwnts during the day, although he met privately in Boise with Idaho Gov. C.L. Otter, who has the authority to lill any vacancy in the state's Senate delegation. 
"We are proceeding based on the assumption that there is going to be a transition at the end of the month," said Jon Jlanian, Otter's spokesman. "The senator's staff is going to work with ours to that end." 
But McConnell heard some­thing different when he talked with his longtime Senate col­league. lie said Craig had told him he now intended to remain in Congress if he is permitted to withdraw his guilty plea by Sept. 
30. "II' he is unable to have that disposed of prior to Sept. 30, it is his intention to resign from the Senate as he expressed last Saturday," he said. 
The GOP leader spoke hours after Craig's attorney, Stanley Brand, asked the ethics commit­tee not to investigate a complaint because events were "wholly unrelated" to official duties. 
Committee action eventually would lead the Senate down a path of dealing with "a host of minor misdemeanors and trans­gressions," Brand added in a let­ter that was hand-delivered. 
In a written reply several hours later, the panel's chairman and senior Republican wrote that Senate rules give the com­mittee authority to investigate lawmakers who engage in "improper conduct, which may reflect upon the Senate." 
"The committee has reached no conclusions regarding the matter," wrote Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and John Cornyn, H-Texas. "Pending Sen. Craig's resignation, the committee will continue to review this matter." 
A second attorney for Craig, Tom Kelly, was in Minnesota, evidently preparing to file papers seeking to have the senator's guilty plea withdrawn. 
Lawyers not involved in the case have said Craig faces a diffi­cult challenge, pointing to Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure requiring that a defendant show a "manifest injustice" to withdraw a guilty plea. 
In Craig's case, he voluntarily signed a plea agreement that included a provision stating that the court would not accept such a confession of guilt from anyone who believed himself innocent. 
The legal fine points aside, Craig's turnabout was the sub­ject of a lengthy closed-door dis­cussion among Senate Republicans during the day. One participant said McConnell's con­certed effort to prod Craig to 
haste, added 
this lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. 
There was other evidence of the discomfort his case has caused fellow conservatives. 
A dozen conservative activists attending a press conference on one of President Bush's judicial nominees declined to answer questions about Craig, including whether they wished to see him resign or remain in office. 
They included Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council; David Keene, president of The American Conservative Union; Grover Norquist, presi­dent of Americans for Tax Reform; and Wendy Wright, president of Concerned Women for America. 
For his part, McConnell turned away questions about Craig's sit­uation. Asked whether fellow Republicans could embrace Craig if he disposed of the case and returned to Washington, the GOP leader said he would not answer hypothetical questions. 
Asked if Craig had been disin­genuous when he told him on Friday he intended to resign, McConnell declined to say. 
And when asked whether Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., had been helpful in resolving the contro­versy, McConnell said, "You'll have to talk to Sen. Specter about his views." 
Specter said Sunday he would like to see Craig "seek to with­draw the guilty plea, and fight the case." Specter, a former prosecutor, said he believes the Idaho lawmaker could be vindi­cated. 
He declined to elaborate fur­ther when asked during the day. 
Craig drew one expression of support, from fellow Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo. 
"I support whatever Larry does," said Crapo. "Everybody has a right to try to vindicate themselves." 
Several officials have said Crapo played a key role in last week's events, serving as an intermediary of sorts between his home state colleague and Republicans in Washington eager to see Craig resign.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student activis111 discussion continues 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Recent Letters to the Editor have dis­cussed the ability of the Notre Dame stu­dent body to rise up against injustice. I feel it is my civic duty to point out that recent events have proven we are not up to the challenge. 
Last year, at the end of second semes­ter, South Dining Hall took away our Cocoa Puffs, replacing them with the generic brand, but we did not speak out. Now, they have taken away even the generic version, and yet there is still no protest. 
I must admit that I am ignorant as to the reason for this outrageous act. Perhaps a survey of the student body on cereal preferences was poorly run, and thus led to the incorrect result that 
Fight for your Cocoa Puffs 
Cocoa Puffs is not a favored brand. I do 
not know. What I do know is that in American history, when­ever evil dictators have tried to take away the things we hold most precious, there has been a revolutionary force present to provide resistance. The British were repelled when Alexander · Hamilton unleashed his sword and drove them back to their gloomy island. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was slain by polio, which 
admittedly may not have been American. Regardless, the point is that Americans will not stand and watch while their free­
dom is taken away. Now, we must follow this example. We 
must find the person or people in charge of cereal choices for South Dining Hall, and we shall 
fight them in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. 

For they have taken away our Cocoa Puffs. No longer can I find glory in a bowl after I fail a test. No longer can I wake up on a weekend morning to be greeted by the scent and taste of love, crunchiness and chocolate. 
Instead, South Dining Hall would have me seek comfort in a bowl of Cookie Crisp. But I will not be sated by little cookies in milk. I demand my puffs of cocoa, and you should too. Rise, Notre Dame student body, and fight for what is right and good in this world.

Fighting for our right to party 
I would like to applaud Tom Martin's intrepid defense of the anti-South Bend Ordinance Movement ("Keep fighting ordinance," Sept. 4). He makes an excel­lent correlation between people who protest unjust laws and those affected by those laws themselves, and I echo his admiration for the Darfur dining hall activists (who are, assured­ly, all from Darfur them­selves). 
Andrea Laidman's injunc­tion to care about events and laws so far removed from our bubble is patently unreasonable ("You gotta fight for your right," Sept. 3). However, we must keep in mind that even the ter­rorist liberals are part of our great Notre Dame fami­ly, and it falls upon us to help them reevaluate their priorities. 
Perhaps we should take Martin's commentary to the next logical step. Thanks to the ingenious wire-tapping laws that Laidman men­tioned in her fulsome anti­freedom treatise, we can lis­ten in on their devious schemes and easily deter­mine likely candidates for reeducation. 
It would be simple to get their names from the revo­lutionary hotbeds of the Progressive Student Alliance listserv, or the names of the students who have attended peace march­es or pro-choice demonstra­tions. And of course, every owner of a Michael Moore movie has got to go. Jail the terrorist students, and when they have spent weeks with­out beer or 25-person par­ties, maybe they will appre­ciate the struggle of we patriotic youths, fighting for truth, justice and our right to party. 
Jacqueline Collins

Pasquerilla East Hall Sept. 4 
Criticism downplays important issues 
As a close, personal friend of Andrea Laidman's ("You gotta fight for your right," Sept. 3), I can con­firm Tom Martin's accusations ("Keep fighting the ordinance," Sept. 4) that she is a terrorist and a misguided youth are entirely true. Not only is she a political science and peace studies major, like Osama bin Laden (terrorist), Jane Fonda (misguid­ed youth) and Hugo Chavez (apparently a combina­tion of the two), but she is the co-founder of a group called Notre Dame Students Against State Killing (ND-ASK), an organization that is attempt­ing to remove the American death penalty in favor of a more vigilante-like system of killing people for the atrocities they may or may not have commit­ted. 
I would like to take this time to point out some of the high points of Martin's argument, which, unlike Laidman's mostly made up argument, appears to have come directly from God (thanks JC!). First, Martin hits an early peak by contrasting Laidman's opinion that Notre Dame students are not active enough by pointing out those people in SOH that made him sign a Darfur banner. See Laidman, Martin unwillingly signed a piece of paper protest­ing genocide and that's pure noble activism. What do you want him to do, read a book on the subject and write his senator? Good luck, grandma. 
Secondly, Martin points out what college is really about, not protesting or even learning, but good old-fashioned partying. And like he says, this is college, a place not where we are to be young and idealistic and actually care about humanitarian crises or the systematic rolling back of civil rights and liberties in the U.S., but rather where we can have more than 25 of our close personal friends over, drink booze, sweat and maybe make out with some guy or girl we have never met-go college! 
Finally, I want to high-five him on that last line: Defending America from terrorists, wherever they may-lie. See, it's a pun-not only is he insinuating that the terrorists are lying down (which is proba­bly why we still cannot find Osama), but he is also insinuating that Laidman is telling a lie. Or more than one, for that matter. And h·e is right, Laidman's column is filled with falsities -there are no Americans held at Guantanamo Bay without charge, there are terrorists. Hurricane Katrina didn't reveal inadequate federal response, it was just a big hurricane man, what do you think, we can predict the weather? 
I think I've made my point. So thank you, Martin, for protecting us from the delusions brought on by the liberal media. I'm glad to know that the next time we are in need of someone to defend this helpless body of predominantly upper-middle class white males, Martin will be there chanting U.S.A. and pouring chocolate milk all over his face (see old facebook profile pictures).

A reflection guide accompany­ing thn film can be tiJUnd through the Notre Dame website and Hev. Groody will be at the showing lilr discussion. 

"Romantico," Sept. 6, 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
"Homantico" is a documentary portrait of Carmel Muniz, a 60-year-old Mexican mariachi player who is returning to his family after living in San Francisco for years. Colored by the music Mufiiz plays, the film vividly depicts the unhappy choice of many immigrants between supporting their family and actually being with them, as well as the changing nature of crossing the border between the United States and Mexico. "Homantico" was nominated for best picture at both the Sundance and Indepnndent Spirit film festivals. 
"The Namesake," Sept. 20, 7 p.m. and 10p.m. 
"The Namesake," directed by Mira Nair and based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, follows two generations of the Ganguli fam­ily, beginning with the immigration of A-;hima and Ashoke Ganguli from India to the United States. Eventually, their children Gogo! and Sonia are born. Unlike their par­ents, the two siblings have little connection with India and struggle with many of their parent's traditions. Gogo! in particular feels hindered by his name, which he feels sepa­rates him from the Western society he wants to belong to. As the mm progresses, Gogo! learns the sig-nificance of his name and begins to find a balance between his home and his heritage. "The Namesake" is in English, Bengali, Hindi, and French with English subtitles. 
"EI Norte," Sept. 27,7 p.m. and 10 p.m.

"El Norte" is in Spanish and Mayan with English subtitles. 
"In America," Oct. 14, 4 p.m. 
"In America," directed by Jim Sheridan, describes the trials of immigration through the eyes of children as it tells the story of Christy and Ariel, two young girls emigrat­ing with their parents from Ireland to New York. While their parents are struck with the difliculties and struggles of immigrat­ing, the girls see the magic and adventure their new country has to offer. Sheridan based the film on his own experiences, writing the screenplay with his two daugh­ters. "In America" was nominated for many awards, including three Oscars, and received 15 wins. 

"The Golden Door (Nuovomondo)," Jan. 17, 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
Set at the beginning of the 20th century, "The Golden Door" illustrates a more his­torical view of immigration. Italian widow­er Salvatore Mancuso set'i out to move his entire family to the United States. The film fO<:uses on the difliculties of reaching the United States at the time, highlighting the determination of immigrant'> to reach their destination.

Thern an~ few act-; who have the ability to capturn a listener's attention immediate­ly and not let go until the last note of the album slowly fades to silence. Antony and tho .Johnsons' "I Am a Bird Now" is one of those albums. 
From Uw first song, Antony's voice flows in an expression of loneliness, an articula­tion of evnry lhding wn've ever wished we could convey and found ourselves cursed without tho ability to lind the right words. .Just as Antony finds the words, he also finds the music, and the result is exhilarat­ing, despairing and haunting. 
"I am a Bird Now" is a eomplex record and fulfills a host of meanings. It's a soul record, which means that it does not fulfill a strict definition of the genre and so can­not be classified as such. Yet the music is strong. It's disturbing, it's searing, it's pained, and it's elegantly raw. It is soulful as any enduring soul record should ever be. 

One of the disc's strengths is its insis­tence on moving bnyond the realm of sim­ple music. Much more than a series of 11 separate tracks, Antony brilliantly guides the listener into a wholly new sphere of melodious storytelling. Quite akin to the confusing nature of David Lynch films such as "Mulholland Drive" and "Blue Velvet," the music is at once confession and accusa­tion, a note of lasting return and final departure. 
Most songs on the
I am a Bird Now 

record are a reflection of the gender-bending expe­

the dillieulties faced by Antony are at times excruciating, the album emerges as a tes­tament to hope and perseverance. 
A particularly moving song is the album's bridge song "Fistful of Love." Featuring Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground, the song has one of the more upbeat tempos of the album. 
Its lyrical message, however, conveys a deep understanding of the cruelty some­times found in the search for love. While he is an owner of a wounded perception of love, Antony nonetheless sings honestly of his personal struggle for acceptance from a distanced lover. So different from much of today's musical offering, the song's lasting power is in its assurance that the words are sung from the mouth of a real person. 

Adding to the appeal of the album is the stellar lineup of guest appearances, includ­ing Devendra Banhart, Hufus Wainwright and Hob Moose of Suijan Stevens. Lending their talent<> to the Johnsons, the record is arranged with each song continuing the story of Antony until the moment comes when tl1e record ends, and it is dear that he has finally shed the burdens of life ­free as a bird, free at last.

CoMPilED FROM THE OBSERVERS WIRE SERVICES 
U.S. OPEN 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-For bet­ter or worse, Nikolay Davydenko is back in the semifinals at the U.S. Open. 
Smack in the middle of tennis' gambling scandal, the fourth-seeded Davydenko once again looked untouchable Wednesday, beating No. 10 Tommy Haas 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 
Davydenko is the only man who has not lost a set in the tournament. 
The Russian expects to meet soon with investiga­tors. A British online gambling company tracked bettors putting 10 times the usual amount of money on a match he played in August, most of it backing his 87th­ranked opponent; Davydenko quit in the deciding set with a foot injury. 

Next up, Davydenko was to play the winner of Wednesday night's matchup between No. 1 Roger Federer and No. 5 Andy Roddick. Davydenko has never beaten either one -he's 0-9 against Federer and 0-4 vs. Roddick. 
Also at night, two-time Open champ Venus Williams was to play No. 3-seeded Jelena Jankovic in the quarterfinals. 

Davydenko beat Haas in the quarters at Flushing Meadows for the second straight year. This was a frustrating defeat for the German, who flung his racket into the net, hit a ball into the stands and chastised the chair umpire. 
Davydenko joined a pair of Russian women in the semifinals. 
Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced that far for the first time since winning the 2004 title, beating unseeded Agnes Szavay 6­1, 6-4. 
"It's my favorite tourna· ment. I love New York," said the No. 4-seeded Kuznetsova, who's been 
IN BRIEF 
Manning opens children's 
hospital 
INDIANAPOLIS Peyton Manning has a collection of MVP trophies and starred in numerous commercials. Now, the Colts quar­terback has a children's hospital named after him. 
The St. Vincent Children's Hospital was renamed Wednesday as Peyton Manning Children's Hospital at St. Vincent. 
Manning has had a strong public and private relationship with the hospitals since he joined the Colts in 1998. He said he was honored to be so closely associated with the children's hospital, which St. Vincent opened in 2003 to care for critically ill and injured children. 
"In the NFL, the name on the back of the jersey is emblematic of a player's commitment to con­tribute in any way he can to the success of that team," Manning said. 
Matsuzaka's ERA takes hit in 
past few starts 
BOSTON-The $103 million man has a 7. 61 ERA in his last four starts. 
Daisuke Matsuzaka is struggling at a bad time for the Boston Red Sox. They have baseball's best record and want to build momentum as the pennant race heats up. Lately, he's been a momentum stopper. 
Before winning his first game in more than a month on Monday he allowed seven runs in that one the right-hander had lost his three pre­vious starts. And those losses ended a pair of two-game winning streaks and one four-game surge. 
That's not quite what the Red Sox hoped for when they paid $51.11 million for the right to negotiate with his Japanese team, and then gave the celebrated rookie a $52 million, six-year contract before throwing a single pitch in the majors.

She'll face fellow coun­trywoman Anna Chakvetadze, who swept the last six games to elim­inate No. 18 Shahar Peer 6-4, 6-1. 
It will be the sixth-seed­ed Chakvetadze's first Grand Slam semifinal. Kuznetsova can count on an edge in experience, having made it to the 2006 French Open final, in addition to claiming her only major champi­onship at Flushing Meadows three years ago. 

K.ahne gains momentum 
toward end of season 
DOVER, Del. -Kasey Kahne entered last year's race at Richmond on the brink of qualifying for the Chase for the championship. 
With all the pressure on the baby­faced star, Kahne finished third in the race and qualified in the 1Oth and final spot. The result seemed almost expected from a driver who won a series-best six races in 2006, and maneuvered his way up to eighth in the final points standings. 
When the green flag drops there this week in the final race before the 10-race Chase begins, Kahne's only pursuit will be for his first victory. 
''I'd much rather have the pressure of having to be in the top 12, or hav­ing to win a race to get in, then not having any pressure or not having a chance," Kahne said Wednesday. 
Kahne's startlingly gloomy season which had him deep in the points standings around spring training.

Braves oust division-rival Phillies in wild finish 
Piniella's managerial changes help produce offense for the Cubs, as they remain in first place by a half game 
AP 

Associated Press 
The BnlV!~s will have a hard time making the playoffs, despite their most remarkable eomebaek of the season. So they went ahead and celebrat­ed as though this one was for a championship. 
Matt Diaz capped an improb­able rally with a two-out, three-run double in the ninth inning, giving Atlanta a CJ-8 vic­tory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday. 
The Phillies squandered leads of 5-0 and 8-2, giving up four runs in the eighth and watching in disbelief as Diaz's liner skid­ded off the tip of Chris Hobertson 's glove with the bases loaded. 
''I'm not believing that," said Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel, whose team remained five games behind the NL East­leading New York Mets. "I totally can't believe that. I've never seen that -ever. It's mind-boggling." 
The Braves' chances looked slim when Brett Myers (3-6) retired the first two hitters in the ninth with an 8-6 lead. But Jeff Francoeur and Martin Prado hustled to beat out infield hits, and Yunel Escobar walked to load the bases. 
That brought up Diaz, who entered the game as a pinch-
hitter in the seventh. He went the opposite way with a liner that eluded Hoberson's lunging attempt and stuck at the base of the wall. 
Roberson hit the relay man, but the throw home was up the first-base line. Escobar slid across with the winning run, thrusting his right index finger toward the stands. Diaz, who had just rounded second. pumped his fists and was mobbed by his teammates in a wild pile beside the pitcher's. mound. 
"When I got it in the air, I thought I got too much," Diaz said. "I didn't realize how shal­low he was playing." 


Braves outfielder Matt Diaz is surrounded by his teammates after he hit a game-winning, three-run double in the bottom of the ninth of Atlanta's 9-8 victory Wednesday.

Plus there's live music on weekends, overstuffed leather chairs to cozy up by the fireplace and lots ofbig screen TVs to watch all thegames. And we're open seven nights a week, too. 
(Waterfurd Estates Lodge has hotel roomsatreasonablerates fur up<.:oming NDiUotball weekends.) 
Manuel remained on the top step of the dugout for at least a minute, watching the celebra­tion and subtly shaking his head. Finally, he headed for the clubhouse. 
"It didn't look good," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "But we did it." 
The Braves still must face reality. They won for just the second time in six games on a crucial homestand against their top two rivals in the NL East, having been swept by the Mets last weekend. 
Atlanta is 7 112 games behind New York, which lost 7-0 to Cincinnati. 
"Whatever happens, we're going to play till the end," Francoeur said. "That was the most exciting game of the year for me." 
Braves starter Tim Hudson allowed five runs in the first two innings, and the Phillies added three more in the sev­enth off Oscar Villareal for an 8-2 lead. Rafael Soriano (3-3) got the win with a scoreless ninth. 
Atlanta sent 10 hitters to the plate in the eighth, scoring four runs off Tom Gordon. But it looked like another frustrating finish for the Braves when Kelly Johnson popped out on a 2-0 pitch from Myers with the bases loaded, then Chipper Jones hit a lazy fly to left for the third out, slamming his bat in disgust. 
Gordon blamed himself for letting the Braves back in the game. 
"It's devastating," he said. "We need to win those kind of games. I take responsibility for it." 
Myers struck out Mark Teixeira to start the ninth, and Brayan Pcna grounded out to first. Francoeur hit a grounder past third that shortstop Jimmy Hollins fielded in the outfield grass, giving him no chance to throw out the runner. Prado followed with a high hopper off the plate, just beating Myers' throw to first, which pulled Ryan Howard off the bag any­way. 
"When Prado got that base hit off home plate, I thought, 'Uh oh, something's going to happen here,"' Atlanta's Willie Harris said. 
He was right. Diaz came through with the biggest hit of all, giving the Braves a glimmer of hope in the playoff race. The team that won 14 straight divi­sion titles from 1991-2005 has only 22 games left to avoid missing the playoffs for the sec­ond year in a row. 
"It happened so fast," Myers said. "The game got out of con­trol: cheap hits, balls falling in." 
Hudson gave up 11 hits in five innings. The remarkable comeback kept him from his third straight loss and kept the Braves (71-69) above .500. 
"This is the kind of win we've been needing for a long time," Hudson said. 
Pat Burrell hit his 25th homer in the second, a two-out drive over the center-field wall that put Philadelphia ahead 5­0. 
Kyle Kendrick breezed through the first five innings, allowing just three hits. The Braves finally broke through in the sixth, knocking out the rookie with three straight hits that included Harris' leadoff homer. 

The Phillies Hscaped with a 5­2 lead wlwn Aaron Howand raced over from center to make a sliding catch on Francoeur's blooper toward left, then Andruw Jones struck out against Kane Davis. 
But there were more come­backs to come. 
"We had no business winning this game as lousy as we played the first few innings," Chipper Jones said. "We got lucky." 
Cubs 8, Dodgers 2 
Ted Lilly got his first win in nearly a month and Aramis Ramirez homered to help the Chicago Cubs beat the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday night. 
The Cubs remained a half game ahead of Milwaukee in the NL .Central. The Dodgers started the night in third place in the NL West, three games behind San Diego and Arizona. 
Lilly (14-7) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2-3 solid innings to win for the first time since Aug. 9 and tie Carlos Zambrano for the team lead in wins. 
Ramirez hit his 20th homer, a two-run shot in the third for a 3-0 lead against lefty Eric Stults. 
Stults (1-3), recalled Tuesday from the minors for the fourth time this season, got the start because David Wells is serving a seven-game suspension. In his sixth major league start, he gave up eight hits and four runs -three earned -in 4 1­3 innings. 
Lilly left leading 4-1 after giv­ing up a two-out walk to Mike Lieberthal in the seventh and Carlos Marmo! relieved. Pinch­hitter Olmedo Saenz hit a liner to center and when Chicago's Felix Pie slipped, the ball rolled all the way to the wall, allowing Liberthal to score and giving Saenz an RBI double. Pie had just entered the game in the sixth as a defensive replace­ment. 
Liberthal's double, a single by Stults and sacrifice fly by Rafael Furcal got the Dodgers their first run in the fifth. 
But the Cubs got it right back when Mark DeRosa doubled, Derrek Lee singled and Dodgers' right fielder Matt Kemp fielded the ball and threw it over catcher Liberthal's head for an error. The ball bounced off a brick wall and DeRosa took off for the plate to put Chicago ahead 
4-1. 
Trying to shake up his offense, Cubs manager Piniella made some changes in his line­up, inserting Craig Monroe in center, Honny Cedeno at short and Pacific Coast League Player of the Year Geovany Soto behind the plate to start the game. 
Monroe doubled in the sec­ond and scored on Soto's RBI single. And when the Dodgers had a runner at third with two outs in the third, Cedeno made an alert play, grabbing Juan Pierre's hard liner after it deflected off third baseman Ramirez's glove. 
The Cubs tacked on four in the eighth on an HBI double by pinch-hitter Hyan Theriot and run-scoring single from Jacque Jones, two regulars who didn't start the game. DeRosa then hit a two-run single through a drawn-in infield to make it 8-2.

Federer triumphs in tight match over Roddick 
Swissman advances to semifinals; 2 victories away from his fourth consecutive U.S. Open title 
Associated Press 
To Andy Roddick's credit, he played nearly flawlessly against Roger Federer, serving bril­liantly, returning well, too, and giving tennis' top player a tough time. 
To Roddick's dismay, it all added up to yet another loss. 
In a match as tight as could be for 2 1/2 sets Wednesday night, Federer was barely bet­ter on the most important points and emerged to edge Roddick 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the quart!~rfinals, moving two victories away from a fourth consecutive U.S. Open title. 
'Tm not walking otl' with any questions in my head this time. I'm not walking with my head down." 2003 !~hampion Hoddick said after falling to 1-14 against 
Federer. "It was a very was far more

ball cap. and extend his own 
second tiebreaker. At 4-4, Roddick unleashed a 140 mph serve, and Federer conjured up a backhand return that put the ball right at the opposite base­line. Roddick couldn't handle it, and two points later, Federer's 128 mph service winner put him ahead by two sets -and sent many in the partisan crowd streaming for the exits. 
How different things could have been. 
As Federer noted, matter-of­factly: "I could have been down two sets to none." 
Federer earned his first break point all evening at 3-2 in ·the third set. Roddick erased the first with the help of a for­tuitous net-cord bounce, and he laughed a bit at his luck while trudging back to the baseline. Seconds later, his expression 
Federer his trademark ban­danna. The outfits matched and so did the level of play, right down until late in the third set, when Federer finally earned his first break points. 
This rematch of last year's 
U.S. Open final was hardly the mismatch one might have expected. 
"It was a very high-standard match. I was very pleased with my performance," Federer said. "I thought actually Andy also played very well." 
That's for sure. 
Banging serves consistently at 140 mph, Roddick hit 14 aces and didn't have a single double-fault. Then again, Federer came up with 15 aces, also never double-faulted, and erased the only break point he faced, in the second set. 
Both played remarkably cleanly, combining for 90 win­ners (48 for Federer) and only 42 unforced errors (18 for Federer). 
It was riveting stuff, even if the score showed it ended in straight sets, and was the sec­ond half of a double feature in Arthur Ashe Stadium that began with Venus Williams coming back from a set and a break down to beat No. 3 Jelena Jankovic 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4). That put two-time U.S. Open champion Williams in her first semifinal at Flushing Meadows since 2002, and she now meets No. 1 Justine Henin, the player who eliminated Serena Williams. 
In the other women's semifi­nal Friday, 2004 U.S. Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova will face No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze. 
No. 1 Federer vs. No. 5 Roddick came down to those two tiebreakers. 
With Federer ahead 5-4 in the first one, Hoddick smacked a 130 mph serve that Federer got back. Hoddick charged the net behind a good approach shot, but Federer flicked a cross-court backhand passing winner, leaving the American cursing. 
At 6-5, Federer hit a 122 mph ace and slowly punched the air to celebrate while Roddick muttered to himself. 
It was almost the same in the 
record by get­
ting to a 14th consecutive Grand Slam semifi­nal. That's where he will meet No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko ­against whom Federer is 9-0. 
"I've got a pretty good record against him. Never lost," Federer said. "But let's not get ahead of ourselves." 
Well, let's, if only for a moment. Should he defeat Davydenko on Saturday, Federer would add to another of his own records by making a 1Oth straight major final. And a victory Sunday would not only make Federer the first man since the 1920s to win the American Grand Slam four years running, it would give him 12 Grand Slam titles over­all -only Pete Sampras, with 14, won more. 
Does Roddick feel a bit sorry for himself, given that he hap­pened to be born almost exact­ly a year after the man who may very well go down as the greatest tennis player in histo­ry? 
"No," he said. "I get to play in atmospheres like that." Well, does Roddick think he can beat Federer? "Yeah," he said. "If I didn't, I wouldn't be out here." 
He looked good early. In the match's fourth game, Roddick turned it up a notch, pounding an ace at 140 mph, a service winner at 142 mph and deliver­ing another serve at 146 mph. Remarkably, Federer put that last one in play, an indication of just how talented a returner he is. 
Roddick serve-and-volleyed at times, even on a second serve, and covered the net well, early, winning the point on six of his first eight trips forward. 
All the while, his coach, five­time U.S. Open winner Jimmy Connors, sat in the front row of a guest box in a jacket and blue tie, occasionally offering encouraging yells or claps, at other times gnawing on his fin­gernails. · 
Roddick got plenty of support from a partisan sellout crowd of 23,733, a celebrity-specked audience that included Andre Agassi, the eight-time major champion who returned to the scene for the first time since retiring after last year's Open.

The lnague went 2-5 in bowl games, with its two highest-pro­lile teams getting c:reamed. The Buckeyes were humiliated 41­14 in the BCS national champi­onship game a few days after the Wolverines took a 32-18 bnatdown from Southern California in the Hose Bowl. 
Asked if the Big Ten's strcmgth has wilted. Penn State's .Joe Paterno said to reporters, "I don't know. You guys need to writ11 something. You got to cre­ate sonw headlines. At one time last year we thought we (confer­ence teams) wen\ the greatest thing that evPr happennd in our lives and wn got in a couple bowl games and Big Ten didn't do quite as well." 
Those Wl\re the salad days compared to last Saturday, whnn Big Ten favorite Michigan, ranked No. 5 in the nation, was upended 34-32 by Appalachian State -the first time a ranked team has ever lost to a team from the Championship Subdivision (formerly 1-AA). 
The Wolverines subsequently spiraled out of the Top 25, the greatest fall ever. 
Buckeyes coach Jim Tressel was asked if Michigan's loss was just another black eye for the conference. 
"We don't spend any time looking in the mirror at those black eyes," he said. "That was September 1st. What's most important, black eyes heal well before Novnmber. The Big Ten's going to bn a good confnrencc." 
Reconstituted Juice 
Illinois QB .Juice Williams left Saturday's 40-34 loss to Missouri in the sm~ond quartnr after taking a shot to the head. But coach Hon Zook says Williams. who had blurred vision after the hit, is expected to start on Saturday against Western Illinois. 
Backup Eddie McGee threw for 257 yards and a touchdown whiln leading the Illini back from a 24-point defieit. But he also lost two fumbles and threw two intnrccptions.

Thnrn's a popular bumper

sticker in the Buckeye state that reads, "I root for two teams: Ohio State and whoever is play­ing Michigan." 
So it was only a matter of time before Ohio State fans adopted Appalachian State. 
Not long after the Wolverines' loss to the Mountaineers, at least one enterprising street vendor was doing brisk business selling Appalachian State T­shirts near the Ohio State cam­pus. Columbus stores say they're overwhelmed with requests for similar items com­memorating the upset. 
"If I had a dollar for every time someone's asked, I could retire," said a manager of one store. 
Slippery Fingers 
Iowa QB Jake Christensen, making his second career start, was just 12 of 29 for 133 yards in a 16-3 win over Northern Illinois. 
But Christensen was victim­
ized by  a  number of drops,  
including  several  by  Andy  
Brode!!.  

Brodell is expected to be the llawkeyes' top reeeiver follow­ing the suspension of Dominique Douglas. 
"They're not trying to drop the ball." Christenson said in defm1se of his receivers. "You can't get mad at them." 
MAC Attack 
Bowling Green travels to Miehigan State, hoping to become only the second Mid­American Conference team to beat two Big Ten squads in the same season. 
Bowling Green beat Minnesota 32-31 in overtime last week. 
In the 2003 season, the Falcons beat Purdue 27-26 in the regular season, then han­dled Northwestern 28-24 in the Motor City Bowl. 
Getting Physical 
When James Hardy worked out this summer, he was already preparing for defend­ers who wanted to play press coverage. 
So when Indiana's 6-foot-7 receiver got knocked around a couple of times against Indiana State, he simply got back up and beat the Sycamores secondary for three catches, 153 yards and two touchdowns while draw­ing two more pass interfer­ence penalties. 
''I'd rather them play me like that rather than playing off me because that's what I've been working on the

whole offseason," he said. 
Red Menace 
With a QB competition, a top­10 ranking and lofty confer­ence expectations, Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema had plenty to dwell on before the opener against Washington State. 
!lis last thoughts kept drift­ing back to a fashion state­ment. 
Shunning the traditional red jerseys and white pants, Wisconsin came out wearing all red and went on to beat the Cougars 42-21. 
"For like three weeks, that was my last thought every night before I went to bed," he said. "I threw it out to my staff and they unanimously pretty much said, 'No, don't do it."' 
Bielema said he got the idea from his players and decided to go with the fashion-forward look without the knowledge of former coach and AD Barry Alvarez. who wasn't sold on the change and said so on national television. 
Bielema said he got a mixed reaction overall, but felt it helped establish a team identi­ty.

"Our outside attackers really wreaked havoc with Adrian's defense," Schroeder-Biek said. "They did a fantastic job of finding holes in Adrian's block and on their floor. Marisa Gross played with unbeliev­able intensity on defense." 
Schroeder-Biek said the 17 digs by Gross were even more impressive because they came from the defensive specialist position. 
"That's a number you usual­ly see a libero with, rather than a defensive specialist," Schroeder-Biek said. 
Although Schroeder-Biek hopes the defensive play con­tinues against the Flying Dutch, the third-game melt­down is something she'd like to avoid having to see again. 
"I definitely saw a lot of 

good things out there [Tuesday], but I also saw a lot of things that we need to fix," she said. "The fact that we deflated in the third game when we had shown such competitive spirit in the first two games of the match is something that we can never allow to happen again if we want to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves." 
Despite the disappointment of the loss, Schroeder-Biek said Saint Mary's can recover and have a good season ­starting tonight against Hope. 
"I have confidence that we will fix those things and that we will learn from this ... it was our first conference match of the season against a tough team," she said. "We will get it all together and have an exciting year of vol­leyball ahead of us."

"[MillerI is a seasoned vet­eran when it eomes to games, and a lot of guys respect him for that," Cahill said. "People turn to him whenever we're about to faee a good team, and he's always going to be poised because he's been there a few times before."

SMC, Flying Dutch combined for 107 digs in previous matches 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD Sports Wrirer 
After a frustrating loss to open the MIAA season Tuesday, Saint Mary's will need to play with more consis­tency again !lope tonight in Holland, Mich. 
The Flying Dutch (3-1) are coming off a 3-0 win against Olivet. Hope is a strong defen­sive squad -they nearly dou­bled the Comets in digs, 55­38. 
The Belle~ began league 

play Tuesday with a loss to Adrian. The three-game defeat (25-30, 28-30, 11-30) dropped their record to 1-3 on the sea­son and 0-1 in the MIAA . 
The first two games were hard fought, but the Belles came apart in the final game. 
"We had some struggles with offensive connections," Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "If I could ignore the third game of the match, I would say that we played a very competitive match." 
The Belles did have incredi­bly strong defensive play, which was lead by senior defensive specialist Marisa Gross' her 17 digs. As a team, Saint Mary's had 62 digs.
