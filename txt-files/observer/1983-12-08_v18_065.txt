Thomas Merton: synthesizer of the sacred and the secular 
Saturday marks the I5th anniversary ofThomas Mer­
ten's death. 
The prolific monk, who wrote about almost every 
conceivable subject, profoundly affected the Catholic 
Church of the 1950s and 1960s because he was able to 
synthesize the sacred and secular worlcls. 
During those years, the institutional Church was 
facing its greatest crisis: Should it follow its members 
and enter the modern world? 
That crisis, however, is unknown to many of us stu­dents here because we have been indoctrinated in post­Vatican II theology -a theology which openly condemns the arms race and which questions the humanity ofcapitalism. 
The Church, in the 18 years since Vatican II, has an­nounced itself a conscience of the temporal order. Merton, a convert, fell in love with the Church ofour parents. He was not blinded by love, however. 
He saw an institution which was attemptingto live on its past glories of which we .E students catch a glimpse in ~ the Latin Mass. 
While he reveled in the

come. 
He urged the Church to make its own "leap of faith" into the world of nuclear arms, racism, and poverty. 
But what created this prophet? Why did Merton become a bridge-builder of the transitional Church? 
Born in France of a New Zealander Episcopalian father and an American 
Thomas Merton 

Quaker mother -neither of books and articles about 


yearning for the priesthood and ultimately the monastic 
life. And after much deliberation and three semesters as 
an English professor at Saint Bonaventure University, he 
entered the Trappist's Abbey of Gethsemani, near 
Bardstown, Ky., on Dec. 10, 1941. What Merton found there was a community of men struggling to live out the Benedictine Rule while the world around them was caught up in World War II. 
Yet Merton did not escape the horror ofwar. The loss 
of his brother ended any ties to an immediate family. It was then he adopted his new family, the Church. And as a good brother, Merton was quick to offer encouragement to his fellow Christians, yet firm in his dis­pleasure when one of his siblings failed. Never a holier-than-thou writer, Merton, much like Saint Augustine, began his public writing career with a confession, The Seven Storey Mountain in 1948. While remaining furiously active in the day-to-day life of the monastery, serving as master of scholastics and then as master of the choir novices, Merton wrote 
whom were devoutly religious -Merton came into the world amid the turmoil ofWorld War I. He left the world at the height of the Vietnam War, electrocuted by a frayed fan wire in Bangkok, Thailand. The years in between saw one of the greatest life stories ofthe 20th century. Having traveled throughout Europe and the eastern 
U.S. before he was 18, Merton entered Cambridge Uni­versity in England. 
After a disastrous academic year, during which he studied little and drank heavily, he sailed for New York where he entered Columbia University. 
A voracious reader and diligent researcher, Merton easily completed a B.A. and M.A. in English. 
His years at Columbia, however, gave him time to consider more than books -he became committed to social reform. More importantly, he became enraptured by the Church. 
Baptized in the fall of 1938, Merton found himself contemplation, prayer, Eastern religions, liturgy and poetry. 
The 1960s, much as they affected the lives ofthose in the city, also spurred Merton, who had become a her­mit, to deliver his most decisive indictment of modern culture. 
He decried nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War and racism as symptoms ofa sick society which "developed too fast and too far for the psychic capacities ofits mem­bers." 

But Merton never lost hope in the world. For the Church, Merton believed though a community of sin­ners, was ultimately guided by a God who could unify the monastery and the city. 
And perhaps it is time we, too, take heart.

The diocese "began exploring the possibility last fall," as a result of the inquiries, said Place. 
It was during a visit to the Col· lege's campus in October that McManus announced weddings could be performed at the church beginning Dec. I. 
But Saint Mary's Campus Ministry office contacted the Bishop's office soon after the announcement to say the Dec.

The program, which is beinr developed by Campus Ministry, is composed of three areas. First, Church Jaw requires a liturgical program to be set up. Loretto did not have one because ofits standing as a campus chapel belonging to the sis­ters of the Holy Cross and not to the College. The second involves procedures, rules and regulations surrounding marriage ceremonies which must be planned. Finally, a pre-nuptial preparation program with the couples is being organized. Loretto also will be affiliatt~d with a local parish which, for record keeping purposes, has yet to be chosen. Only students and alumnae would be given permission to marry in the Church of Loretto, Place said. It would not be open to 
South Bend area residents or others wishing to be married at Loretto, he added .

matters and is chairman of the British Security Industry Associa­tion. 
David Powis, a deputy assistant police commissioner, said there are numerous "no questions asked" markets for gold around the world. But he refused to give any further in­formation for fear of tipping the direction ofthe police investigation. 
Asked at a news conference whether it would be hard to dispose ofthe gold, Powis said, "It would not be difficult knowing the amount of gold smuggled on the international >cene." 
A source with one of the insurers, who insisted on anonymity, said, "It will be difficult to get rid of gold in that quantity, but the most likely market is the backstreet jewelry market around the world." 
It would have to be melted down and would take some time to dis­perse, the source said, indicating that the insurers "believe the thieves still have it."

Will students protest Billy Joel visit ? 
It's time for another campus protest. 
This year has seen protests on Cap'n Crunch, Christie Hefner's visit, Grenada and European missiles. Non-activists have charged that such meetings arc "full ofsound and fury, signifying nothing." Undaunted by the allcga· lions, a few less enlightened activists have 
Keith Picher 

Profundity's demise 
gon...: ahead with plans to form a "Save the Fieldhouse" campaign. 
But the latest protest involves Billy Joel's l't·b. 2 visit to the Athletic and Convocation Center. Evidently, a group of students who call themselves W.B.D.I.T.G.T.G.A.W.T. (We'll be: damned if they're going to get away with this) has met secretly at the headquarters of the local Reactionary Society. A friend placed an electronic bug in the office, hence the following conversation: 
"What kinda muck we got on this Billy Joel 
character? Any Satanic lyrics? He ever beat up 
his mother?" the coordinator asked. 
The assistant spoke up. "Well, when we played one of his songs backwards, we kept hearing the phrase 'evol, evol,' but none of us were sure what it meant. It did sound a bit Satanic, though." 
"We'll have someone look into it. What about when you played his records forwards?" 
"Heck, I never thought of that." 
The coordinator paused a moment, looking for his notebook. 
"I got some info on thisJoel guy in the latest issue ofScum About Singers. They say he's an ardent anti-Catholic, and God knows we'd rather die than have a non-Catholic offer views at this great bastion we call Notre Dame, right?" 
A chorus of_voices chimed in, "Right" and 
proceeded to sing a few verses of "Onward 
Christian Soldiers" before returning to the 
matter at hand. 
The coordinator began to read verses from 
Joel's "Only the· Good Die Young" and 
"Sometimes a Fantasy" to strengthen his posi· 
tion. 
"One of Joel's hits begins: Come out Vir­ginia. Don't let me wait./You Catholic girls start much too late. What do you suppose he's talking about?" 
A hesitant voice spoke up. "Either he means we don't baptize our children as soon as we should or, God forbid, perhaps he's thinking of that 's'-word." "Oh, you mean sex?" an ingenue piped in. "Shhhhhh! You're not supposed to say that word." 
Thoroughly upset, they turn~d to another of his songs. "What do you think of these lyrics?" the coordinator continued. "/ didn't want to do itbut/got too lonely/!bad to call you up in the middle ofthe night// know ifs 
awful bard to try to make love long dis· tance/But I really needed stimula· tion/Tbougb it was only my imagination." 
"Whatever happened to the good old days 
at Notre Dame? You mean they're actually 
going to permit someone to come here and 
sing about autoscxuality?" 
"Shhhhhh! You're not supposed to say that word. I say we hold a rally? Anyone who cares about this University will attend. Where and when should we hold it?" 
After a short discussion, they agreed on a time -Thursday evening, Feb. 2. The Univer· sity suggested that the best place for such a gathering was in the coal field behind the Credit Union. 
Perhaps you won't be able to attend the ral· ly. You may even wonder, like me, why a more organized effort hasn't been arranged by those who complained when Hans Kung and Christie Hefuer spoke on campus.

Snowball fight 
J)ear Hditor: 

This kttn is to those studc:nts who sc:nt 
icc:halls and jaggc:d glass flying through a 
Christmas display and 40 fc:c:t into the sc:cond· 
floor hallway of Alumni Hall on the night of 
Ike. 6, during the: campus snow-fight. No less 
than six panc:s wc:rc: smashc:d in the: wake: of 
your vandalism, and that's just in the: observa· 
lion window ncar my room. Whoc:v~:r you ar~:. 
this was thoughtkss, cowardly, and totally in· 
c:xcusahk. 

Luckily, no one: ncar the: window was 
seriously injurc:d, although at least two fric:nds 
suffc:rc:d minor facial cuts from the flying glas~ 
slivc:rs, not to m(·mion all the cut fc:et from 
walking on the: glass-strewn carpet. 

Maybe it didn't occur to you that someone could have gottc:n seriously hurt. possibly sustaining an t:yt· injury. Maybe: you didn't think about the repair cost (more than S I "iO) which eventually comes out of your wallets. Maylx· you're just plain stupid· I don't know. 
Were you also tht· ones who threw iceballs at the new stained-glass windows in Alumni's chapel, donated by the men of the hall? For· tunately, we wt:re spared a tragedy there. Dil· lon wasn't so lucky, as three of their chapel windows were broken. 
Pt·rhaps you wt·n· the ont·s who firc:d bottle rockds and threw firecrackers into the crowd that night. This was probably the most mind­less thing you d~d. just ask a former Kcc:nan r<.·sident who was partially blinded by such a prank three years ago. 
The annual North-South snowball battle is a great tradition and lots offun, hut it in no way gives you a lict:nse to vandalize the campus and t•ndanger tht· lives of fellow students. Think about that the next time you slush­ht·ads arc about to throw. 
Greg Hatfield 
Unfair abuse 
/)ear Editor: 

Aftt·r tht· latt·st of numt·rous letters to the 
editor, I decided that I was a little tired of 
hdng attacked without reason. Or perhaps 
"raped" would bt· a more fitting word. During 
tht· past kw months there have been 
numerous artidcs and letters criticizing me 
and Student Govt·rnment, which I sincerely 
would not mind ifthey were based on fat·t. 
On quite a fc:w occasions I have been 
abust·d for things I did not say, quotes taken 
out of context, or simply due to uninformed sources. The Observer should strive to have its reporters quote speakers correctly and within the proper context -they owe that to their credibility as the campus daily, as well as to the student body. Approaching speakers after meetings for some direct quotes usually works out the best for all concerned. 
As far as readers criticizing an individual or organization publicly in the paper, they should do so only after they know as many of the facts as possible. If anyone has any com· plaints or comments for Student Government, our number is in the phone book. At least give us ti-Je hencfit of the doubt and hear more of the dt:tails before deciding to vent your wrath elsewhere. 
If the student who wrote the article: condemning preferential tickets for the Billy Joc:l concert had gotten his facts straight before writing his letter, chances are he wouldn't have seen the need to write a lc:tter at all. If he did, he would have found that his criticisms should have been directed else­where. and not at Studc:nt Government offi· cials. 
TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN 
SOlDlER 


I ran for this position to work for the Student Body and their concerns and needs, and I think we've made some progress so far this year. So if you have a gripe with some­thing we're doing, use the phone and give us a call first, before taking out the poison pen. A reputation is a terrible thing to unnecessarily ruin.

ACCicerink 
Dear Editor: 
Early this fall the ACC ice rink once again opened its doors to allow students the privilege of gliding over its glistening surfuce for a total of three whole hours every week! Naturally, the use of this cooled facility was 
denied to those attending the summer session (one of the hotte~t in memory) because, after all, the hockey school comes first. 
The fact that the ice was probably unoc­cupied during lunch-hour every day and available for use was, no doubt, a well-kept secret. After all, the potential beneficiaries

were just the students. 
Current counterclockwise (and clockwise -thanks to the personable young gentleman who takes it upon himself at the end of that first precious half-hour to reverse the traffic flow) skaters are having an increasingly haz­ardous time maneuvering their way through the growing number ofparticipants 
That "glistening surface" referred to above has, however, usually lost its luster by noon on Monday, Wednesday and Friday -having been well skated upon during the previous hour. But, not to worry. The next users are, after all, just the students.

Editor's note: The headline of Guillermo O'Donnell's Dec. 5 letter to the editor (Kellogg response) may have mistakenly implied that his opinion represented that of the Institute. The letter and the original ar­ticle (Kellogg members condemn Grenada action, Nov. 15) are personal statements of the individuals involved, not official 
statements of the Kellogg Institute.

Stonnio' Gonnan 1bomas was traded by the 
Cleveland Indians with infielder Jack Perconte to the Seattle Mariners for second baseman Tony Bemazard Thomas played the first 46 games of the season with Milwaukee before being traded to the Indians for center fielder Rick Manning. He hit .183 with five homers before going to the Indians, with whom he hit .221 with 17 homers and 51 RBI. He finished the season with 69 RBI. Bemazard, likewise, was traded during the 1983 season, from the Chicago White Sox to the Mariners for Julio Cruz, who became a free agent after the season. Bernazard, a slick-fielding second baseman, hit .262 with the White Sox and .267 with the Mariners. He wound up with 23 stolen bases on the season and 56 RBI. The Indians had been dangling Thomas in a possible trade since he demanded to be traded.

With Northwestern holding a 56­44 lead, Notre Dame began a come­back bid that proved to be too little, too late. Schueth, who led the Irish with 17 points and 12 rebounds, 
teamed with laura Dougherty ( 14 points offthe bench), to bring Notre Dame to within two points, 76-74, with 39 seconds left. However, Smith's basket ended the rally. 
The loss drops Notre Dame's record to 3-3 and also represents the narrowest margin of defeat for the Irish in three years. They will try to rebound tomorrow night when Michigan visits the ACC at 7:30.

When Lukenda's mind was fairly set on Notre Oame he learned ofthe demise of hockey's varsity status. "I didn't find out until january. At first I didn't know what 'club' meant. I wa'> kind of disappointed. It was a let down," he said. 
Although attendance at hockey games is not great, the freshman has no complaints. ''I'm impressed with the fan suppon. The numbers aren't that bad. The ones that arc there are hockey fans. They helped a lot in the comeback against St. Thomas." 
Along with his hope to gain more experience at the college level, l.ukenda would like to see Notre· Dame return to varsity hockey. "I feel lucky. If this had been a varsity team I might not have had as good a chance," he said. "I'm looking for­ward to returning to varsity, but I wouldn't transfer if we didn't.

Search for commissioner 
Baseball winter meetings heated 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -White House Chief of StaffJames A. Baker III emerged yesterday as the leading candidate to replace Bowie Kuhn as baseball commissioner.

Two Irish wrestlers, Louis Car­nesale and Matt Stamm, gave their best performances in their Notre Dame careers at the tri-meet. 
"Louis wrestled the best I have seen him wrestle in three years," praised Bruno. "The same is true of Matt. That was his best performance in two years. Both wrestled really well technically." 
The Irish will travel to Kankakee, Ill., this weekend to compete in the Olivet Nazarene Invitational. They will carry a perfect 6-0 record into the tournament, but not a full team. Once again, Bruno plans to leave

signed free agent Dave Parker. 
News that Baker might switch 
jobs was ridiculed by a White House 
spokesman and President Reagan 
said he was surprised by the reports. 
The possibility ofthe chiefofstaff 
succeeding Kuhn first came to light 
Tuesday when it was learned that 
the group delegated to find a succes­
sor to Kuhn was looking for a man in 
the nation's capital. 
Yesterday, a source with contacts 
both in baseball and in Washington, 
said Baker had emerged as the top 
candidate for the job. 
"Apparently, he was the fifth or 
sixth choice (of the search commit­
tee)," said the source, who asked not 
to be identified. "And it looks like 
that's how far down they have 
gone." 
"They (the search committee) 
haven't been very popular," the 
source said. 
After several candidates higher on 
the committee's list had declined 
the job, the source said, the commit­
tee began to look for the Washing­
ton connection. 
"Their main concern there was 
the exemption from antitrust 
(laws)," the source said. "Also, there 
was the fear ofa strike in 1985." 
The source said outgoing American League President Lee MacPhail was "everyone's first choice." But, not only did MacPhail ask out, some owners also began to 
feel he was more important in his other role ofbaseball's labor chief. 
As acting head of the owners' Player Relations Committee, Mac­Phail would direct management's end of labor negotiations next year. Management's concern over player relations was further exacerbated when union head Ken Moffett, per­ceived as a moderate, was fired and replaced by Marvin Miller, the for­mer union boss who is considered a tougher negotiator. 
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and for­mer Treasury Secretary William Simon, now head ofthe U.S. Olympic Committee, both declined the job, the sourc~aid.

On own terms 

Larry Holmes to continue fighting 
A.'lsoclated Press 
PHILLIPSBURG, N.J. (AP)-Larry 
Holmes said yesterday t he will con­
tinue to fight -but only on his 
terms. 
"I'm not going to quit and I'm not 
going to be forced to quit by any or­
ganization or by any promoter," said 
the 34-year-old unbeaten World 
Boxing Council champion. 
"I will not honor my contract for Greg Pagt" unless tht"y increast" the purse," Holmes said at a news con­ference at his hotel here. The agree­ment with promoter Don King calls 
for a S2.55 million purse for a Page fight. 

Cincinnati Reds sign slugger Dave Parker 
A.'I80Ciated Press 
NASHVII..l..E, Tenn. (AP) -The Cin­cinnati Reds signed free agent out­fielder Dave Parker, a two-time National league batting champion, yesterday. 
Parker, the National league's most valuable player in 1978 when he batted .334 for Pittsburgh, is the second veteran slugger the Reds have acquired at baseball's winter meetings. Cincinnati obtained 41­
year-old Tony Perez from Philadel-· phia on Monday. 
Parker won his first batting title in 1977 when he hit .338 with 21 homers and 88 runs batted in. A year later, he enjoyed his finest major league season, drilling 30 homers and driving in 1 1 7 runs to go with 

Holmes has a contract with King to make a mandatory defense against Page, the WBC's No. 1-ranked con­tender, in February or March. If he doesn't, he certainly will be stripped of title recognition by the WBC. 
But while challenging the WBC and King, Holmes also said he would go to las Vegas today and confer with Jose Sulaiman, WBC president, and King at the WBC convention at Caesars Palace. 
Holmes, who last week said he might announce his retirement at yesterday's news conference, is angry about WBC pressure to meet the Page commitment, noting that he has until March to fulfill tha con­tract. 
his second hitting title. 
He signed a five-year contract, 
averagin,g 1925,000 a year and then 
batted .310 the next season as the 
Pirates won the world champion­
ship. It marked fifth straight .300 
year. 
Injuries then cut into his produc­tivity for the next three years. He returned as a fulltime player last season when he batted .279 with 12 home runs and 69 RBI for the Pirates. 
Parker, 32, has often been the sub­ject ofcontroversy in Pittsburgh and the signing with Cincinnati returns him to his hometown. 
Parker will receive an estimated 1800,000 for each of the reported two years in his contract with the Reds.

The champion, 45-0 with 32 
knockouts, said early in the news 
conference that Murad Muhammad 
would be his exclusive promoter. 
But later he sa.td Muhammad would 
serve as his agent. "If you deal with 
me, you have to deal with Murad," 
said Holmes. 
He also said, ''I'm promoting my 
own fights. I'm Don King with a hair-
CUt." 
The fight Holmes seems to want 
most is one with South African 
Gerrie Coetzee, the World Boxing 
Association champion. But yester­
day he said that because of press 
criticism he would now fight Coet­
zee only in the United States. 
Holmes also talked about possible 
fights with John Tate, the former 
WBA champion, and unbeaten 
Pinklon Thomas. 
He mentioned a S4 million purse for a fight against Tate and S100 mil­lion for a Coetzee fight. Many boxing people consider both figures to be much too high. 
Holmes was introduced at the 
news conference as "the 
heavyweight champion ofthe worid 
and also a businessman." The cham­
pion then made it clear bo.xing was, 
for him, strictly business fom now 
on. 
"I feel I should fight one year for larry Holmes," he said. "1 remember fighting nine times one year ( 1975, three years before he won the title) for a total of $18,000. I really paid my dues." 
Holmes has earned an estimated S25 million in the ring and has made. 1 7 defenses of the WBC champion­ship.
