Up in smoke 
Saint Marys students respond to a proposal to make campus smoke-free 

By NICOLE HADDAD News Writer 
By the summer of 2000, Saint Mary's is hoping to kick some real butt -ciga­rette butts, that is. 
A task force. headed by the department of Health Services and the Administrative Counsel of the College, is working to make Saint Mary's a smoke­free campus. 
The task force is expected to draft a proposal by January 2000, and enact it by summer of 2000. 
"Tobacco companies are advertising for young women," said Karen Ristau, vice president and dean of faculty. "It's for our own health." 
Since the formation of the task force, the committee has collected information regarding the use of nico­tine and smoking. After attending seminars geared toward a smoke-free Indiana, it is hoping to make Saint Mary's students "take a healthy initiative to promote a healthy campus," according to Linda Timm, vice president of student affairs. 
"It's how we do this, not whether we do this," said Judy Kenney, director of Health Services. 
The committee received between 20 and 25 e-mail responses which have all been positive, however, more responses from stu­dent smokers is needed. 
Junior Christine Draper, a smoker, disagrees with the proposal.

Other students said that an all-campus no-policy would be infringing on their rights.

Senate debates ND Video funds 
By FINN PRESSLY A.sistam News Editor 
The purpose of yesterday's Student Senate was to approve the nomination for the NO Video manager. However, the routine mneting developed into a heated dnbatn concerning, among other things. the finan­cial feasibility of Nil Video. 
"ls there any plan ... to improve thfl busirwss?" asked Knott senator Ed Foy, citing the low number of' students that use ND Video. 
Student body trnasurer .lanws .Jesse nxplainud that tlw cost of' supplying new rnlmises is of'Lnn prohibitively high for such a small operation. rnn!{­ing sommvlwrn around $180 l'or rental. 
"We'rn just looking lo gel the name out.'~ he said. "[Stud1mlc;I 
don't  have  tu  drive  to  
Blockbuster to find  an  old

In addition, Jesse said that the management board of ND Video is looking into the possi­bility of a video delivery service and weekly specials for differ­ent residence halls. 
"It's a good educational opportunity. which is the prime· concern of the Business Board," said .fosse. 
Student body president Micah Murphy questioned whether tho benefit of experi­trn lial education was worth funding a froquently unprof­itable business. 
"Student Senate was the only organization to finish over budget last year. . . . Their loss­es were only a quarter of what Student Senate ran us," Jesse said, reminding the Senate that th<~ prime reason for the mc(~ting was not to qucsl.ion the foasibility of ND Video, but rather to approve the nomina­tion for the managerial posi­Lion. 
Student body vice president Michael Palumbo suggested that the managers of the Business Board attend a future meeting of the Senate to answer questions of that nature. 

Meanwhile, Jesse pointed out that the Senate maintains two representatives to the Financial Management Board, and that it might be more effi­cient to funnel any questions through those representatives. He also extended invitations to the rest of the senators if they would rather deliver their questions in person to the FMB. 
"Do you want all 28 senators to go to your meetings and having it take twice as long?" asked Welsh senator Candy Marcum. "We're not asking them to give some formal pre­sentation. just spend five min­utes answering some ques­tions."

Proposal Blandford of litiga­tion is a result of what GALA chairman John Blandford called an "pathetic ... and unsatisfacto­ry" response from University president Father Edward Malloy to provide evidence justifying the University's advertising policy, "We are seeing what our

INSIDE COLUMN 

Students in helniets 
My vale of ignorance has been lifted. No longer do I walk in darkness. 
My new found knowledge is due to a most enlightening letter to the editor which appeared in Wednesday's Observer. Iwould like to thank that author for revealing to us his great wisdom and knowledge. 
Before I read that letter I was under the impression that Irish cornerback Clifford Jefferson was sitting a few rows over from me in my philosophy class every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Now I know that it is not Jefferson that sits near me, but instead, some sort of cyborg constructed by the administration to trick me into thinking that Jefferson is in my philosophy class. 
How have I come to this conclusion'? Well. thanks to that all-knowing member of the class of 1995, I now know that all football players are too busy "living off campus. partying, playing video games and being sexually promiscuous" to attend classes. How could I have been so stupid as to think that football players made a contribution to this campus on days other than football week­ends'? 
I would like to thank that authoi: for showing me that all football players am "professional underqualif'ied jocks who never study." Because before I read your intelligent discourse, I had been under the faulty assumption that tight end Jabari Holloway was a great guy who got amaz­ing grades in a nearly impossible major. 
According to my new found logic, his 3.2 GPA in computer engineering is most certainly a lie. Because without studying and working hard, he never could have achieved those grades. 
And when I speak to Bobby Brown, I must be hearing someone thro¼ing his voice so that it appears that Brown is speaking. Because when I hear his words. I don't hear an ignorant, under­qualified fornicator but instead I hear an intelli­gent, articulate leader. 
ft is certainly a clever ploy by the administra­tion that Brown's true nature is so hidden that I cannot discover it. But no more will I be fooled, thanks to that well-thought letter. 
But the cover-up extends further than just to an sports writer for The Observer. Even Parade magazine was fooled into thinking that football players are more than big guys who hit each other. They once did a cover story on Chris Zorich and his incredible social work with inner-city kids. 
Perhaps Parade needs to be told that all football pfayers are worthless people with no redeeming values. I mean Chris Zorich is certainly not the kind of person that we want people to envision of when they think of Notre Dame. Why would Our Lady's University possibly want to be associated with a man from the inner-city of Chicago who earned a degree, played in the National Football League, started his own charity organization that has helped hundreds of people and is now going to law school? Those sure sound like the actions of an undcrqualified slacker. 
Or perhaps I was wrong to accept the views 
stated in that letter. Maybe the author should 
have opened his eyes to the wonderful people that 
don the blue and gold for the Irish every 
Saturday? Holloway, Brown and Zorich are just a 
few of the many players who are making positive 
contributions to the Notre Dame community and 
beyond. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

Arkansas student tours sweatshops 
FAYETTEVILLE. Ark. 

Though Russell denies having sweatshops in El Salvador, a University of Arkansas student who has visited the country disagrees. Cynthia Kendall, a mem­ber of Campus Democracy Cellective, visited El Salvador this summer and spoke with a female worker who said she made clothing for Bussell in sweatshop conditions. "l handed about three shirts to her with the Russell label on them, and she said she made them," Kendall said. "She said Korean managers [in the factory] would hit workers in the head, and they would count the minutes it took them to go to the bathroom. ":fhey only had hot water to drink, and the only way the Korean managers could communicate with them was by screaming insults at them like 'brute animal' and 'shameless cat face.' They would fire some of the Workers for pleasure." The Koreans moved to EI Salvador when they had trouble with businesses at home, and most of them are unhappy being in a foreign land, Kendall said. Kendall said the worker she spoke to had been fired from her job.· and was refused severance pay. \_

Karle expressed interest in discussing this issue further with Malloy and assistant to the president Chandra Johnson, who serves as spokesman for the office of the president on Observer­related issues. 
Johnson could not be reached for comment last night. 
Malloy also wrote to Blandford, "The current con­troversy surrounding this issue is not based upon a new policy but rather a longstand­ing one, despite the fact that advertisements have occa­sionally appeared without authorization over the course of the past several years." 
Observer Editor in Chief Michelle Krupa said the policy was presented to the indepen­dent, student newspaper in an Aug. 23 letter from Malloy's office. Before that date, there was no documented policy restricting advertising from groups whose missions do not support Church teaching.

O'Higgins: Ireland advances economically 
By MARIBEL MOREY 
News Writer 
Ireland has shown the most accelerated evolution in the shortest amount of time during the past two decades com­pared to the rest of the European nations, said Kathleen O'Higgins, speaker for the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, Ireland. 
O'Higgins lecture, "Irish Social Policy: Safety Net and Mechanism for Change," focused on Ireland's economic advancement in relation to other European countries. 
"The increase in population of working age and the increase in women's labor force participation; the invest­ment aid from the European Union and the closer integra­tion with the international economy all worked to stimu­late the evolution of this once farm-based economy," she added. 
O'Higgins explained that the change in the social realm is due to an increase in skilled jobs and a decreas·e in unskilled jobs. This has pro­moted Ireland's eagerness to become a "knowledge-intense industry." 
·Technology also caused change. Ireland currently pro­vides of 60 percent of the soft­ware in Europe. With these changes, poverty has consis­tently decreased since 1987 from 16.9 percent to 6.4 per­cent in 1999. 
Th<' inain factor of the change into an urbanized and Europeanized Ireland is from the "rational, effective social

policy" O'Higgins said. 
Internal and external changes 
in social policy "help to shape 
the character and equity of 
social relations." 
Known mainly as a "Catholic corporate welfare state," the separation of church and state in Ireland is surprising, O'Higgins said. -The Homan Catholic Church has little interest in govern­mental structure, but some­times an underlying principle 
is shown. 
In 1992, a referenda for 
restricted abortion was voted 
against by 65 percent of the 
population in Ireland and a 
marginal 50.3 percent was in 
favor of the legalization of 
divorce in the referenda of 
1995. 
The external factors include 
Ireland's entry to the 
European Community in 1972 
along with the Single 
European Act of 1987 and the 
unification of currency in 
1992 with the Maastricht 
Treaty. 
For the success of the 
international integration of 
Ireland, social partnership is 
essential, O'Higgins said. The 
government provides the 
arena for the partnerships of 
employers such as the farm­
ing and business organiza­
tions and these groups collabo­
rated to ensure the .success of 
the economic system. 
The other key element for Ireland's success is the use of European money to invest as its aggressive policy of bring­ing in foreign investment has been heightened by its "eco­nomic openness."

Rescue teams streamed into Taiwan today ­including a U.S. crew that pulled a man from his col­1apsed apartm,rnt -as three strong aftershocks to the country's devastating earthquake forced terror­stricken residents into the streets. 
Hescue efforts wern com­plicated by today's after­shocks, which triggered mudslides, cracked one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs and forced eva,·uations. The aftershocks, with magnitudes of 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0, were the strongest of more than 2,000 that have rocked the island. 
The death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,003 people, with 4,400 injured, officials said.

A bipartisan group of House members is crafting compromise legislation lo combine a minimum wage increase with billions of dol­lars in tax breaks for some businesses and the self­employed, officials said Wednesday.

An increase of that size would be less than the White House and many Democrats want, but more than the GOP leadership says it would like. 
The tax breaks likely to be included would make the cost of health care fully deductible for the self­employcd; offset part of the cost of hiring certain low­wage earners; and increase the deductibility of meals as business expenses for small businesses and the self­employed. 
Also likely to be added is pension-related legislation the House passed earlier, including an increase in allowable contributions to 401{k) and similar plans.

Witnesses told The Associated Press the shots came from Indonesian army troops firing into the air in two passing trucks. But Lt. CoL Peter Welch, an Australian battalion com­mander, said the shooting apparently was an attempt by pro-Jakarta militia gunmen to be seen and heard. 
More shooting was heard near Oil's harbor, a vital link for the peacekeepers to unload men and supplies to sustain the 7,500-man force due to take position in East Timor. 
The army, which was accused of participating in the orgy of killing and looting after East Timor voted overwhelmingly to separate from Indonesia, is evacuating the half-island and handing over control to the Australia-led peace force.

The commander of the force, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, linked the death of Sander· Thoenes, a 30-year-old reporter for Britain's Financial Times and for the Christian Science Monitor, to resistance by the pro-Jakarta militias to the deployment of his force. 
"It would appear that the militia have attempted to step up some activities as a show that all is not yet secure. Well, I would agree with that," Cosgrove said.

Militiamen have vowed to kill Westerners, whom they accuse of helping East Timor break free ofIndonesian occupation. 
The International Federation of Journalists expressed outrage Wednesday over Thoenes' death, calling it a blatant attempt to stop journalists from reporting from East Timor.

DILi 

As international peacekeepers worked' to restore order to East Timur, a Dutch journalist was killed and two other Western reporters escaped an armed attack without injury. 
The attackers in both inci­dents remained unidentified Wednesday, although they appeared to be linked to pro­Indonesian militias that began rampaging across the territory after East Timorese voted over­whelmingly for independence in an Aug. 30 reforendum. 
Sander Thoenes, 30. a corre­spondent for the London-based Financial Times, had been in Dili less than two hours Tuesday when he hired motorcvcle driver Florindo Araujo for a tour of the area.

Funk: Meet God through prayer 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI News Writer 
Prayer is the language ol' expe­ri'ncing Cod, according to Sister Mary Margarnt Funk. 
Funk's lcclurn "Contemplative Meditation" dealt primarily with Lhe practice of various forms of prayer to bcicome doser to Cod. 
Funk emphasized that human existence is largely defined by liiarning methods of prayer. 
"We're horn to know wlrnn to practice," Funk said. "If it's a highnr form of prayer to give up the practice, do iL" 
Funk drnw on stwnral difl'nrrnt methods of prayer to illustrate examples of how prayer should he us1~d in daily lifo. 
One particular method was 
used by St. Theresa of the Little flower, who called it her "Little Way." 
"[ For Saint Theresa] practice was the daily life," Funk said. 
Similaritirs between tlrn medi­tation practices of' Buddhism and Christianity were also dis­cussed, showing how prayer can be used in different cultures. 
"From the eastern religions. the training of the mind is medi­tation," Funk said. 
Funk is the Executive Director of' Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, with which she has traveled to India. Tibet, and Nepal to experience eastern spiritualitv firsthand. While traveling, she was able to learn more about Buddhism and Hinduism. 
"One thing I've learned: Never speak for other religions," she said. "It's awful hard for other religions to interpret yours cor­rectly." 

She was formerly the Prioress of the sisters of Saint Benedict of Beech Grove, Ind. She resides there at their Sacred Heart Monastery. 
Funk is also the author of a commentary on the Institutes of John Cassian, titled "Thoughts Matter.'·' 
Funk will facilitate a retreat at Mary's Solitude for those interested in discussing the topic in greater depth. 
"Contemplative Meditation" was sponsored by the Center for Spirituality, Mary's Solitude, the Thomas Merton Society of Michiana and Little Flower Catholic Church.

. Gundlach talks about 'slotting fees' with Small Business Committee 
By KATE NAGENGAST 
News Writer 
Gregory Gundlach, associ­ate professor of marketing, 
testified  before  the  
Committee  on  Small  
Business  

o  n Capitol IIill last Tuesday about t h e practice slotting fees has 
on cus-Gundlach turners. 
"(I worked J with a com­mittee of senators to develop the protocol of the hearing, but the testimony was pri­marily my own," said Gundlach. 
He discussed the contro­versial practice of slotting fees, in which retailers and wholesalers requiring a pay­ment from their manufac­turers before agreeing to allocate shelf or warehouse space to their products. 
Testifying with Gundlach was a panel of eight other professionals, including anti-trust lawyers, .trade association representatives and editors of various trade publications. Gundlach was the only academic represen­tative on the panel. 
Gundlach credits this opportunity to his long-term involvement in research and Notre Dame's program. "Here at Notre Dame we are in a position to look at the legal and social implications of business practices objec­tively," he said. "While most universities just focus on the businesses themselves we research a much broader realm ... because our univer­sity mission is to be society oriented and ethically virtu­ous," he said. 
The practice of "slotting fees," although most com­mon in the grocery industry, continues to expand into other business. The pay­ments are usually negotiated and decided in secrecy, and 
Professor testifies 
to Senate group 
the terms are never dis­closed to the public. 
Although proponents claim these fees lead to lower prices by aiding with distrib­ution and signal product quality by showing manufac­turer's support, Gundlach still stated a warning. 
"Slotting fees, though yielding some distribution efficiencies, do raise serious concerns for small business and consumers," he said. 
According to Gundlach the hearing is just tho beginning to the research of slotting fees. 
"[Slotting fees] account for as much as $9 billion in annual promotion expendi­tures, so it is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. This hearing [represented] an important step ... but to fully under­stand the implications of slotting fees more research is needed," he said. 
Gundlach sees Notre Dame playing a large part in that research. 
"This was not a one-shot deal," he said. "Notre Dame has long-term involvement in this research and my sense is that this will be a continuing process. If, as a university, we are going to be involved at the level we want, we need to take a stance on what's legal and ethical in various business practices." 
Gundlach works to convey that message to students in his strategic marketing management class intended to be a senior's last course to complete his or her major. The course consists of 10 weeks of business sim­ulations that force students to apply the skills they have learned in earlier classes with real-life scenarios. 
"We've talked briefly in class about my experience [in Senate]. This is exem­plary of how the process should work," he said. 
The experience shows his students the value of uncer­tainty. 
"It really shows the stu­dents that there are issues out there of which we still don't know the effects," he said. "The world isn't carved in stone. As future business people they need to understand that the deci­sions they make could have these kind of implications."

hide," Dole said. 
The Republican presidential candidate detailed her educa­tion platform at Melrose High School outside Boston where she was a student teacher in the 1959-60 academic year. 
She said 
parents should be able to choose from a "rich smorgas­bord of educational choices" in 

d e c i d i n g Dole where to send their children to school 
Dole proposed a new tax credit to encourage private support for public and private schools and also recycled pro­posals from the Bepublican Congress for "education sav­ings accounts" aml for freeing up federal education funds from federal mandates. 
"Take a look at this unwieldy stack of paper," Dole said, painting to· a more than 600-page copy of tho "Clinton­Gore" Elementary and Secondary Education reautho­rization bill. 
"This would be a joke if our system were working, but it's no joke," Dole told about 150 students, school officials and senior citizens in the school library. 
Later in her speech, she 
underscored her point, saying: 
"The federal government has 
become a truly intrusive regu­
latory presence sapping state 
authority, local control and 
parental ·responsibility. Every 
hour spent on complying with 
regulations is time not spent 
helping teachers and stu­
dents." 
Dole said that if she is elect­
ed president, she would let 
states and local school districts choose how most federal money is spent, as long as stu­dents' performance is mea­sured and attained. 
Unlike her rival for the GOP nomination, Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush. Dole did not spell out exactly how she would lever­age federal dollars against fail­ing schools. Bush, earlier this month, detailed a formula for measuring student perfor­mance, rewarding good schools,' and stripping bad schools of' federal support. 
Dole also wants to rninforce 
parents' control of their chil­
dren's education and suggested 
that school-by-school results 
be posted on the Internet. 
"We should allow competi­tion to foster a rich smorgas­bord of educational choices," Dole said. "Whether it's oppor­tunity scholarships f'or students in failing schools, or charter schools or home-schooling, we should empower parents to make choices as long as their choices get results." 
Dole said schools must be 
made safe for students and 
kept drug-free. To attain that, 
she called for parent-approved 
locker and backpack searches 
and drug testing. 
"The lives and bright futures 
of all students depend on our 
watchful care, at home and at 
school," she said. 
Students warmly welcomed 
Dole to their school, where she 
was an 11th grade history stu­
dent teacher while earning a 
master's degree at Harvard 
University. They gave her a key 
to the city, a "We are Melrose" 
button and a football jersey 
saying "President Dole." 
"J was always looking for­ward to seeing the first female president," said Liz Perkins, a 15-year-old sophomore who has high hopes for Dole.

We should not fear population growth 
Renowned economist Jeffrev Sachs recently suggested something· very sim­ple in "The Economist": People from developing countries, especially sub­Saharan Africa, should have ready access to cures for malaria, tuberculo­Gabriel sis and AIDS. Sachs 
Martinez
suggested that if people are sick and

nations cannot

become prosper­ous. If children are malnourished, they cannot become responsible and productive global citi­zens. It is an idea that makes sense: People should be plentiful and strong because we are an essential ingredient to the production of nearly everything. 
On the other hand, people are con­sumers. Malthusians instill in us the horrible fear of running out of things because we cannot make them as fast as we breed. If there are too many of us, then teachers, doctors, transporta­tion and energy will be insufficient. 
Our current technologies will fall short of our needs. And every improve­ment in health and agriculture makes things worse because healthier and better nourished people become more numerous. 
This fear has been proven unfound­ed, decade after decade. Each time that we appeared to be close to running out of something, we came up with some­thing else. This is just what Julian Simon told us: Simply put, necessity is the mother of invention (See his book, "The Ultimate Resource.") Technology, instead of being something mysterious and out of our control, is the result of forces within society. Supply and demand: If more people demand acer­tain technology, there are incentives for scientists and the people who fund them to supply it. 
Think of a baby boom as a large increase in demand. If so, it makes sense that somebody, somewhere, stands to make a buck by supplying new ways of making food, new ways of curing diseases. more cost-effective ways of building roads and producing energy. 
Of course, improvements in technolo­gy are not instantaneous, but they take time, money and effort. More impor­tantly. they take human resources: Scientists, assistants, research sub­jects. They take a whole intellectual community. In general, adding another scientist to a department does not make it less productive, but more. Therefore, more populous countries not only have a larger need of new technologies but they also have a larg­er ability to supply the solutions. 
In summary: Having a higher popula­tion density on the one hand makes countries poorer by putting more strain on their resources. On the other hand, having more people makes countries richer by increasing the demand for technology and the ability to supply it (and everything else). 
Telling the direction of causality is trickier than it looks. For example, note that Congo, with a sixth of Nigeria's population density, has a third of its income per person. The rea­son is not the number of people, but political and economic instability. The United States has about the same pop­ulation density as Tanzania, but about 250 times as much income per capita. The reasons are probably historical and institutional. Ideology aside, popu­lation does not appear to be well corre­lated with wealth. 
· OK then, but why are Nigerians so . 
poor? Why don't they come up with 
better ways of producing food and other necessities? 
The answer: Because too many Nigerian scientists work in first-world laboratories. Asians, Latin Americans and Africans study and stay in the United States and in Europe because back home people are too poor to pay for their talents. Indian and Chinese geniuses produce the medicines for developed-world diseases because they feel they would not earn the fruits of their efforts if they worked on develop­ing-world diseases. 
And here is where Sachs' proposals come in. First-world development poli­cy and financial aid should be directed at creating a market for the technolo­gies that the Third World needs. 
We need pharmaceuticals to produce cures for malaria; biotechnology firms to produce better tropical crops; Silicon Valley to produce poor people-friendly information technology. Sachs suggests that rich-country governments can offer to pay the R&D costs, while the goods are sold at producti.on cost. It will happen only if it makes financial sense to do so because a loss-making firm is one that goes broke. 
In short: Don't be afraid of people. Don't fear population growth. Somewhere in the world, there is enough for everybody. Just make sure it is well distributed.

got myself in. I relax<~d. No more bragging about what a stellar chick I was, no more uxplaining away that criminal record I had an1uir1~d. Naturally, being the naive and innocent freshwoman that 
I was, I thought that the ordeal was over. Never again would 1have 
to expostulate on my commitment to The World. Well, at least until 
I IA',lS ready to join the rat race. 
Poor, na!vo, ignorant moi. 
I huvn. over the past four years, pontificated on my best and worst qualities a total of 482 times. The qualities were different each time I expostulated on them. (You would think that after the first dozen times, I would have just sat down and memorized my best and worst qualities. You would think. But I'm just not gifted in the area of foresight.) 
Unfortunately, if you want to join any club, do anything on student government or hold any campus job, you will be roped into talking about the stellar person that you are. It doesn't matter WHAT you want to do on campus, thoso are the three questions they will ask you. 
You: Look, I just want to get into the DI I to get some breakfast. -·nrnm: Why do you think yuu are unique for this position? What gifts can you bring to it? 
You: I'm human, and I sort of need to eat. Them: What's the biggest challenge you've ever faced. and how did you handlA it'! 
You: The biggest challenge I've ever faced is answering this inane question, and the way I'm going to handle it is by perishing away on the sidewalk from lack of food. 
It dons not matter what you need: scholarships. jobs, toilet paper -tlrny will ask you what challenges you have faced in the past and how you dealt with them. They want your life history and 77 refer­ences before they even want to think about you, let alone hire you. 
But the thing they H.EALLY want to know is this: What are your worst qualities? _ 
Oh, come now. llow many of you have really, honestly told even your mother what your worst qualities arc? (And she's the person who alrnady knows all of' them anyway!} Ilow many of you even admit what your worst qualities are to yourself? 
And they expect us to tell total strangers who we want to hire us to tl'll them our worst qualities? Are they trying to get us to lie, or do they think we'll actually tell them about our criminal record? 
It defies reality. What ustrnl!y ends up happening is that we say sonrnihing like, "Uh, my worst quality is my dedication and concern for the human race, which sometimes keeps me from excelling in my acadmnic work." Yeah. we're really going to bare all to a poten­tial employer or scholarship-committee. We'll twist around some GHEt\T quality and make it seem oh-so-bad. I mean, come on: Is Joe Schmoe or Jann Schmann going to tell someone that they're sccrnt nose-pickers who commune with Eleanor Roosevelt? No. They are going to say that sometimes they take on too many tasks. Or that they am perfectionists. They will never, EVER tell the truth. 
Evur. 
So, pretty much, we have become experts at the art of bragging. Or rather, the art of exaggerating. We list all of our accomplish­ments for the past 20 years with ease and aplomb. But give me a brnak: We've only been on earth for less than a quarter-century, and half of that time we weren't even sentient beings capable of forming together sentences. That gives the best of us 10 years to work with (and as for the rest of us ... well, I JUST accomplished something last week.) 
Thcsn interview questions are pointless because they get at noth­ing. They ask us to brag about ourselves and almost force us to lie about our other qualities. It would he much better Lo use recom­mendation forms or trial periods than trying to ask people to praise themsolves. The only things these questions do is turn out people who consistently over-inllate their qualities and understate their weaknesses. And when you say something enough, yon start believ­ing what you'rn saying.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
ND students act like spoiled, arrogant adolescents 
To the current student body: 
When people are under great emotional pressure, their true self' emerges. I sat in section 35, row 16 on Saturday, and I did not like what I saw. Especially in the stands. Especially in sections 35, 34, 33 etc. Although I was not surprised. 
Seated so close, it was hard to misinterpret the salute you gave during the 1812 Overture -and I'm pretty sure it was not directed toward the composer. And your ability to absorb a defeat and leave before the alma mater (about 85 percent of you) did not surprise me either. Such behavior is expected from a basically pampered, spoiled, self-indulgent cluster or arrogant adoles­cents. 
As an Notre Dame graduate, a parent of some recent grads and a Chicagoan who is thankful to be able to live close enough to attend four to six games a year, I can tell you with no uncertainty, that you who left early and/or saluted the coach do not deserve the $100,000-plus "education" you are costing someone. You are most typical of many in today's America. who think first about your­selves and usually never about who you may disappoint or embarrass. 
When your alma mater and the kids that bust their rear ends end up on the short end of a battle, your reaction is to (1) feel cheat­ed, and (2) abandon the fight. Do your par­ents a favor and transfer to the local state school and leave a spot for someone who can appreciate how wonderful Notre Dame is ­with or without a BCS berth. 
To those who conducted themselves as loyal sons and daughters of Notre Dame: Hang in there. It will get better. Even if it doesn't, you'll never be sorry about acting with class. dignity and devotion. The rest of you should just leave -for good.

We need to amend societal ills in order to end abortion 
This letter is in response to Katherine Hoppe's letter printed on Sept. 15th. 
Specifically, I am addressing Ms. Hoppe's statements to the effect that any life is better than to be denied life via abortion. While she obliquely addresses the issue of quality of life, Ms. Hoppe's statement concerning life is so simplistic as to cruelly disregard the adversity that hundreds of thousands of children face in our country today. 
Could Ms. Hoppe actually say to a child who has faced physical or mental abuse, 
poverty and suffering that they should be grateful for the opportunity to face such conditions? Sadly, most anti-choice activists put the cart before the horse in addressing abortion without first tack­ling the more per­
vasive social ills of ~ 
our society. Sadly, every child is not a wanted child. To end aburtion, we · must alter social institutions to change ~ this reality. 
My personal experience is admittedly anecdotal, but l hope that it makes some of the stu­dents on this campus aware of the complexi­ties which face children caught between the rock of abortion and the hard place of begrudged life. As an adoptee -someone who was not aborted -I feel uniquely quali­fied to address some of the shortcomings of the adoption and social service systems, the very institutions that non-aborted children are likely to encounter. The vast majority of states have closed adoption laws. This means that the adoptee will not have access to identifying information about their genetic families. What the unadopted take for granted -knowing how many siblings you have, which side of the family you take after, if your family has a his­tory or illness you should be aware of are unknown to the adoptee. 
The result is a limbo. You are not wholly of the family who raises you. but you are unaware of the family from which you came. This reality is reiterated throughout life by benign factors such as elementary school fam­ily tree projects and genetic trait typing dis­cussion in high school biology classes and more cruelly in the stamp of "illegitimate" that most states put on the birth certificates of the children who are born of unwed mothers -even if you are adopted. by a married cou­ple. 
Fortunately, most children are adopted by loving people, but this itself is often a matter of luck. Prospective parents self-report on their behavior, reasons for wanting a child and family history. They provide their own references, and the sad fact is that the over­worked state social services departments do 
not have the time to provide extensive background checks for all but the most blatant problems. Often, 
prospective parents are visited only once or twice before the placement of a child, and 
once oF twice after, unless a social worker discovers serious problems. 
In my case however, both a private adoption agency and state social 
workers failed to discover 
that iny adoptive family had a history of mental ill­ness, alcoh\>I abuse, physical 
abuse, verbal abuse and med­ical illness. The result was a childhood of routine beatings, ver­bal abuse and hunger that was miti­

gated only when my parents abandoned me for hours or days at a time. Ironically, I came to treasure such moments because it meant I wouldn't be hit. I worked illegally from age 12 to earn money for food and school clothes. Every day of my life was a liv­ing hell until I finally left home at 17 and put myself through college. Seven years after leaving, I am still trying to heal my wounds, 
This letter is not in support of abortion, but a plea for people to work as vigorously to amend societal ills with as much vigor as they protest abortion. Ms. Hoppe is correct in urg­ing people to become mentors,and counselors for children, but so much more is needed. To end abortion without ensuring that children have safe environments in which to grow is a hollow victory for the children who will grow up in situations such as the one I faced. 
I apologize for not signing this letter, but with anonymity, I can give myself a kind of protection which was never extended to me as a child.

One of the main faults of the movie is 

lackluster fashion by 
Luke Wilson ("Home

and is the classic naive, bumbling rookie 
cop that Judge Reinhold perfected more 
than 15 years ago. It's not Wilson's fault 
he cannot match up. He and the movie 
should have never invited the compari­
son in the first place. 

Besides slavish imitation of the high­
est-grossing R-rated film ever, "Blue 
Streak" also has problems with pacing. 
After the breakneck -literally -pace 
of the opening scene, the film struggles 
through the next half hour. It is slow, it is 
painful and ultimately it should have 
been cut from the movie or drastically 
rewritten. Example: Extended two 
minute shots of Martin Lawrence danc­

jumpsuit with fake buck teeth. 
But the film is entertaining over all, in 
large part from the comic chemistry between Logan and his hapless friend Tulley, played by David Chappelle ("You've Got Mail," "Half Baked").

VtDEO PICK OF THE WEEK 

An ode to Meg Ryan: She's so lovely 
By JEFFREY Q. IRISH Scene Movie Critic 
Doesn't everyone love Meg Ryan'? She is America's sweetheart; a luminous angel who floats on air. She is so cute that even women stare at her. In "French Kiss," we are blesaed with her acting in the role the dear Lord envisioned for her -the world's mosl adorable female. 
As always, Ryan
"French Kiss" plays the role of 
her darling little self, but in this film Director: Lawrence Kasdan she is referred to as Kate. Kate is

Starring: Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, self-diagnosed as a Timolhy Hutton anti Jean Reno "kind, bold woman, lacking in pretention. with jusl a hint of sophistication." She hates all dairy prod­ucts and belinves thn French are rude. Kate also believes she is living the perfect love story with her dull tiand~ Charlie !Timothy Hutton) Rut in the opening scene. Charlie leaves Kate to travel to a medical convention in Paris: two nights later he calls her and abruptly l'nrls their rnlationship becausn hP has fallen in love with a chic French "goddess." In disbelief that her perfect life is over, Kate cfocides to travel to Paris in an effort UJ somehow win her love back. On the flight she meets her antithesis, the ardent Frenchman 
Luc Tessyier (Kevin Kline). 
Luc is in the process of smuggling a diamond neck­lace so that he can sell it and buy a vineyard in the French countryside. But to get the necklace across the border, he must hide it in Kate's bag while she is asleep on the plane. At customs there is some confu­sion, and Luc and Kate are separated. Luc is then forced to travel across half of France searching for Kate who is unaware that she has the necklace. 
The story is quite similar to any other romantic com edy, but for some reason the film just clicks. Maybe it is the mystique of Paris, or the great rapport between Ryan and Kline, but whatever it is, it's uncommon in most of today's romantic comedies. 
Between the magnificently beautiful streets of Paris and the picturesque French countryside, there couldn't be a better setting for a love story, 
Kline plays a convincing Frenchman (Luc) through­out the film. Luc is sort of au oddball/buffoon, but his passion for wine and love make him a winner. As stat­ed earlier, the role of the vulnerable Kate is oh-so'.per­fect for Rvan to show off all the nuances that made America fall in love with her. 
It is bard to believe someone could possibly consider dumping her, even in a movie. But luckily, there is Lut, and he has his head on straight. He adores Kate, and throughout the film viewers are treated to him pointing out all of the subtleties that mako Ryan so wonderful ­"your walk, it is like a little girl, yet it is also like a woman._" This is where thfl romanre comes in.

Meg Ryan plays Kate to perfection in "French Kiss." 
In the end, there are many things to like about Ryan and about "French Kiss." It is interesting, humorous and enjoyable to all varieties of people. It makes a great movie to share with a special someone on a weekend, or on any other night to _get away from the monotony of homework and alcohol.

Surgery sidelines 
Ripken for season 
ARLINGTON, Texas 

Cal Ripken will undergo back surgery Thursday and miss the rest of the season, leaving him nJne hits shy of 3,000 for his career. 
"He is in a lot of discomfort and felt that it was time to get it done," Baltimore Orioles general manager J-irank Wren said Wednesday night. 
Ripken traveled to Cleveland on Wednesday to visit spedal­is t Dr. Henry Bohlman after experiencing back spasms overnight. 
He will have surgery there to relieve pressure on a nerve that has been causing him dis­comfort. 
Ripken played in 2,632 straight games before volun­tarily endi.ng the streak last September. 
This season. however, he twice was placed on the dis­abled list because of back pain, the first two trips to the DL over a sensational career that began in 1981. 
The 39-year-old Ripken went on the disabled list on April 20 because of a bad back, missing three weeks, and returned to DL shortly after experiencing back pain Aug. 1: 
"To have it reoccur was dis­appointing and frustrating. I was down for a long time," he said recently. 
Ripken returned on Sept. 1 and hi.t his 400th career homer the following day. He has since been on a binge al the plate, upping his batting average to a career-high .340. 
He appeared on his way to joining Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs as the newest members of the 3,000-hi.t club. It would have been the first time three players reached the milestone in the same season. 
Getting there in 1999 was not a priority for Ripken, who has always put personal accomplishments behind team goals. 
"If 3,000 hits happen. it happens. But it hasn't been a goal to do it in a certain period of time and it hasn't been a goal to do it in a certain year," he said the night he hit his 400th homer. 
"You just play, and things happen when they happen." 
But because the Orioles long ago dropped out of contention, Ripken didn't have much to play for except personal goals -although Baltimore won its 13th straight Wednesday by 
beating Texas·7-4. 
"The true satisfaction out of the game of baseball is to win," Ripken said earlier this month. "It's a whole lot more fun playing on a winner and having a chance to go to the playoffs. It's been a frustrating season in that regard." 
Probably not nearly as frus­trating as the time he's missed because of back pain.

Alabama athletic director resigns 
By DOUG 'WILLIAMSON 
U-Wire 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 

After a day of speculation, University of Alabama Prnsident Andrew Sorensen put an end to the rumors. 
Having served three years as the University's athletic direc­tor, Bob Bockrath. whose stay at the Capstone had often been shaky and controversial, was expected to resign as soon as Monday. On Tuesday, it became official. 
Just eight days after forming an oversight committee for ath­letics within the three-campus Alabama system, members of the University's Board of Trustees validated rumors Mondav that Bockrath and University president Andrew Sorensen had decided on Bockrath's resignation. Sorensen and Bockrath made the arrangements over the weekend. 
Several trustees confirmed that neither they nor the prior establishment of an oversight committee influenced the deci­sion. 
"Bob's accomplishments in his three years at the University of Alabama are reflected in a solid facilities development plan, due dili­gence with regard to NCAA compliance issues and improvements in the academic and competitive performance of several of our men's and women's athletics teams," Sorensen said. "But we both 
7 accept the University's decision to make an administrative change in leadership in its athletic program." 
Bob Bockrath Former Alabama 
athletic director 
agreed that, from an adminis­trative and a leadershlp stand­point, a change was needed." 
Bockrath will be assigned other duties until June 30, 2000. He is expected to take sick leave during a portion of that period due to injuries stemming from a motorcycle accident. 
Bockrath was not present to comment, but he released this statement: ·1 accept the University's decision to make an administrative change in leadership in its athletics pro­gram. I appreciate the opportu­nity I had to serve as its athlet­ics director and wish tho ath­letes, coaches and athletics staff the very best in the future." 
Finus Gaston, senior associ­ate athletics director, will step in as interim director until the spot is filled permanently. Gaston, 48, has worked in cen­tral administration for 22 years. His relationship with the University began as the head manager for Bear Bryant's 1971-1973 football teams. Most recently, before joining the ath­letic department jn 1996, Gaston was assistant vice presi­dent for financial affairs. 
Gaston said Sorensen approached him on Sunday about taking the throne as 
athletic director. 
"I am grateful to Finus for his willingness to serve the University during this critical period," Sorensen said. "He holds three degrees from the University of Alabama, and his loyalty and support of the insti­tution is second to none. I know he will continue to provide effective leadership during th,~ interim period." 
Gaston said he would inherit all decision-making duties that the athletic director's job con­sists of, including the hiring and firing of personnel. 
"It's an awful lot of responsi­bility," Gaston said. "But opera­tions have to go on, plans have to be made and issues have to be addressed." 
Concerning the future status of one employee, Alabama head football coach Mike DuBose, Gaston said he is still behind the coach. 
"Mike DuBose is our head coach," Gaston said. "I support Mike even though we had a disappointing loss. They are working hard, and we will have a successful year." 
DuBose was uncertain if the dismissal of Bocki;ath would lead to rernoval_.if his job, .which has recently lacked any security due to an attempt to cover up his relationship with a female employee and his 13-13 head coaching record at Alabama.

NFL 
Giants work to get back on track against Pats 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
Jim Fassel didn't have to do anything special to get the New York Giants' attention in practice on Wednesday. 
After an embarrassing 29­poinl loss to the Washington Redskins on Sundav, the Giants (1-1) are a much more serious team heading into Sunday night's game against the New England Patriots (2­0). 
Usually in a two-hour prac­tice, players will crack jokes or say something to loosen Pveryone up. There wasn't much of that Wednesday. 
"We're going to see how we respond to adversity," All Pro defensive end Michael Strahan said. Mlt's easy when you are doing well and you beat a team like Tampa for everything to go great. But when you lose, and you lose by 29 points. that next week will show what you are made 
f .. 
o. 
While the Giants' offense has yet to show the big-play potential it exhibited in the preseason. New York's defense is the un.it on the spot this week. 
It's been the backbone of the Giants for almost two decades. If it does not play well, New York's chances of making thp, playoffs are slim. 
Washington had its way with the defense on Sunday, scoring relatively easy touch­downs on its first three pos­sessions in a 50-21 win. 
"More important than get­ting a win or loss, we have to go out and play Giants foot­ball," safety Sam Garnes said. "That's the No. 1 thing. As a defense. we want to cut down on the mistakes and go out and play well. You don't want to have two bad games in a row." 
Stopping Patriots quarrnr­back Drew Bledsoe is not 

.. 
going to he easy. He has passed for an NFL-high 639 yards and five touchdowns in rallying New England to victo­ry twice. 
For his part, Bledsoe is sus­picious of the Giants' perfor­mance last week. 
"I think they are going to come out and play inspired football to prove that last week was not the real Giants," Bledsoe said. "That was just a fluke, a one-time thing." 
If there is a key for New York this week, it will be get­ting pressure on Bledsoe. The front seven didn't do that to Brad Johnson, and the Redskins' quarterback hit his first eight passes in opening a 21-0 first-quarter lead. 
"They could have done any­thing," defensive line coach Denny Marcin said. "It was one of those things. We've been through them before, everyone has. They are not fun. You just have to roll up your sleeves, go to work and shake it out of your head." 
The good news for the Giants is that Jason Sehorn seems to be ready to play for the first time in 13 months. The right cornerback missed last season with a knee injury and had to sit out this entire prcseason and the first two games with a hamstring injury. 
"Don't look to me as a sav­
ior," Sehorn said after work­
ing out with the first team on 
Wednesday. "Look to me as a 
piece in the wheel. Don't look 
to me as the person who is 
going to come in and all of a 
sudden turn this ship 
around." 
Sehorn might not do that, 
but he is a lot better than 
Jeremy Lincoln, who had to 
be replaced on Sunday 
because he played so poorly. 
Playing a nationally tele­
vised game on Sunday night 
also has gotten the Giants 
more excited .

What Are We Building Here? 
Jim Lies, C.S.C. 

Even if you aren't planning to go on a service trip this corning break, this article is about you. It's about each and every one of you. You'll only know how or why after wandering your way through the ponderings of a wayward traveller. I leave you, therefore, with only one option: to read on. 
During fall break three years ago, I was able to travel to Appalachia as part of a joint effort to bring students an9 alumni together for a work project, sponsored jointly by the Center for Social Concerns and the Office of Alumni Community Service. There were a few things that we knew about the under­taking when we began, but there was much that we didn't know. We knew that we would be working together, nearly twenty of us in all; we knew that we would be working with an organization called the Christian Appalachian Project (CAP); and we knew that we would be doing some type of construc­tion work (however unprepared we knew ourselves to be for such tasks). What we didn't know, and what we didn't know we didn't know, was how much this trip, this veritable adventure, would mean to us as a community and as Christians. 
There is something in all of us that wants to do something noble, something beyond the ordinary. Especially as Christians, we know ourselves to be called beyond ourselves to act with justice, to lift up the poor, to shelter the homeless. Over time, we have been prodded, called, and sometimes even guilted (if I may create a verb) into service. No matter how, most of us have come to a place in our lives where we know that there is something in us that cannot be contented with living only for ourselves. It is just such a longing that often compels one to make the choice to spend a week of one's fall break somewhere other than at home or some other place where we can be virtually assured of a good time. On the surface there is a definite risk in choosing to spend a week with relative strangers in an unfamiliar land help­ing people whom we have yet to meet. There is something courageous and noble about it, too. 
It is selfish, too. There is a degree to which such work provides an opportunity for us to satisfy that within ourselves which needs satisfaction, that space or place within us that needs to feel good about me. In the end, however, the experience, and the grace that comes with it, does not allow us to stop there. Our world is inevitably reoriented, our focus redirected and our hearts broken open. Whatever our reasons for going, in the end there is an inevitable movement toward the recognition of ourselves as builders of something far greater than houses. 
On the way we met many whose lives of committed service humbled us in the face of our own feeble commitment. We met many who found con­tentment in a life with far fewer of the "necessities" of life. And we met each other. At the outset, we were two groups, alumni and students, brought together by Notre Dame, intending to do our part to save the world. In the end we were forced to recognize the commonality of us all. Not only among our group of alumni and students, but with the people of the region as well. They were poor, but in so many ways, so were we; we were rich, but in so many ways, so were they. We were forced to assess the measures we use to calibrate wealth, and to consider what it is that will bring happiness. In the end, our hopes of saving the world could only be fully realized by the recog­nition that our salvation was wrapped up with theirs. We, too, were being saved, by the wisdom of a people, the beauty of a landscape, and by the grace that brought us all together. I am reminded of the words of an Aborigine woman who said: "If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together." 
So, what does all this have to do with you? That's something y'all'll have to work out. I have to believe that all of us feel called to something more. It may not be to build houses in Appalachia, but it is to build the Kingdom right here on this campus, right now. How each of us goes about doing that isn't always clear; sometimes it seems downright impossible to figure out. The fact remains that we're not in this alone, and if Campus Ministry or the Center for Social Concerns or the Office of Alumni Community Service can be of any help at all, as you make your way through Notre Dame and beyond, then let us do that for you. Come build with us.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Hokies take on Tigers in national spotlight 

Associaced Press 
BLACKSBURG, Va. 

The national spotlight is something Virginia Tech has openly craved during its rise intu almost weekly resilience in thr top 25. 
With non-conference sched­ules that have included the likes of Akron, Alabama­Birmingham and Arkansas State in recent years, and play­ing in a eonfernnce that has been declining in stature, expo­sure has often been hard to come hy. 
That all changes Thursdav night when Lane Stadium will be the site of thP Hokks' gam(i against tradition-rich C:lemson. ESPN will televise nationally. 
No disrespect to Clemson (l­1). but the Hokies come in ranked No. 8, the highest in school history, and don't expect to waste the opportunity to show the country that Virginia Tech football is a burgeoning phenomenon. 
"I think it's going to be prob­ably the greatest atmosphere we've ever had at Virginia Tech," coach Frank Beamer, in his 12th season, said Tuesday. 
"If you don't want to play in front of a big crowd and a national audience, you shouldn't be playing college football," linebacker Jamel Smith added. "You've got to get excited for this." 
The Hokies (2-0) have had 10 days to watch tapes of how the Tigers picked apart Virginia two weeks ago, beating them 33-14 in Death Valley as Brandon Streeter enjoyed a career day with 343 passing yards and two touchdowns. 
But they also have sweet memories of a year ago. Last September at Clemson, the Hokies rattled Streeter early and romped to a stunning 37-0 virtorv. 
Defensive end Corey Moore said Tuesday he knows Clemson was fpeJing pretty good after routing the Cavaliers, but the Virginia Tech defense that interceptPd fom· passes off Streeter in 1998 won't be any kinder this time. 
'Tm glad that those guys are feeling confident, but they haven't seen anybody play defense or swarm to the ball likA we're going to," Moore said Tuesday. 
The Tigers under first-year coach Tommy Bowdfm sur­prised Virginia with a no-hud­dle, pass-oriented attack and kept them on their heels throughout. 
After losing 13-10 at home to Marshall in their opener, the victory over Virginia was a big step for the Tigers, Bowden said. But it's nothing compared to what the program could gain for its rise back to prominence Thursday night. 


OLYMPICS 

Source: Welch wants to cut deal 
Associated Press 
SJ\LT LAKE CITY 
Salt Lake's top Olympic bid­der is unlikely to get immunity from federal prosecutors in exchange for testimonv against International Olympi~~ Committee members. 
A source close to Tom Welch, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday the former head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee would consider trading his tes­timony against TOC officials for immunity. 
The source said Welch would cut the deal for his own protection, not because he would admit to any crimes. 
Wrich and his lawyer, Tom Schaffer. have not pitched an immunity deal to the Justil:e Department, nor have they been contacted by federal prosecutors or the FBl during the 10-month investigation. 
A Justice DP-partm()nt source, also speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity. said department officials have no intention of giving immunity to Welch, who is considered the chief target of a federal grand jury probe. 

Schaffer was traveling and didn't return phonfl messages relayed by his secretary. 
Welch was prepared to give Richard Wicdis. the Justice Department lawyer leading the Olympic investigation, infor­mation he gave an ethics panel for the SLOC. 
That panel detailed $1.2 mil­lion in girts and favors Welch and others lavished on voting members of the lOC and their relatives. 
Welch has insisted the inducements were normal for Olympic bidding and fall short of criminal bribery. 
Welch figures in charges already filed against two oth­ers accused of shadowy Olympic dealings. 
Ile is the unidentified Salt Lake hid committee officer in an indictment handed up earli­er this month against the son of IOC executive board mem­ber Kim Un-yong. 
John Kim was indicted on 17 felony charges of fraudulently obtaining a permanent U.S. visa or green card and using it to travel frequently to the United States. Kim, who had returned to South Korea before he was indicted, keeps a house on New York's Long Island. · 
Salt Lake businessman David Simmons acknowledged setting up a phony job in New York for Kim, using money funneled from the bid commit­tee. 
Simmons pleaded guilty in August to tax fraud for deduct­ing Kim's salary from his taxes as a business expense. 
Simmons said he hired Kim as a favor to Welch, who was then the president of the bid­committee and later the SLOC until he was forced to resign in 1997 amid spouse-abuse charges. 
Welch's name is on some of the checks to Simmons' fonnflr company, Keystone Communications, for Kim's salary.

Sanders' pro future uncertain 
. Father of former Lions running back wants son to break rushing record 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 

The father of Harry Sanders says his son should return to the Detroit Lions long enough to break Walter Payton's :'JFL rushing record. 
He plans to make the pitch this weekend. 
William Sanders also said Wednesday he understands the Lions' reluctance to trade his son. 
"If I were the Lions, l wouldn't trade Barry Sanders, either," hfl said from his home in Wichita, Kan. 
The elder Sanders said his son is supposed to visit this weekend. 
"He's in for a father-and-son talk," William Sanders said. 'Tm going to advise him to go back to Detroit. No situation is so bad you can't go back." 
.As far as the Lions are con­cerned, Sanders has retired ­and that's it. 
While watching practice Wednesday at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Lions owner William Clav Ford Sr. said he had more pressing concerns than the Sanders situation. 
"Nobody's heard from him, so we don't know what he real­ly thinks," Ford told radio sta­tion WWJ. "It's just pure specu­lation. 
'Tm going by what he said -his desire 1o not play is stronger than his desire to play. ... But he's history as far as we're concerned now." 
The 31-year-old running back was 1,458 yards short of breaking Payton's career record when he retired July 28. Since then, the Lions have demanded that he repay $5.6 million of the $11 million sign­ing bonus he got when he signed a six-year, $36 million contract in 1997.

Varnell takes assistant position for Irish squad 
Special to The O berver 
Christy Yarnell, the top goalkeeper in the history of the University of Richmond, has been named Irish assis­tant women's lacrosse coach at the University of Notre Dame, Irish head coach Tracy Coyne announced on Wednesday. 
Yarnell replaces Kathleen Ostar. who served as assis­tant coach for the 1999 sea­son, and will work closely with the Notre Dame goal­keepers. 
"We are very excited to have Christy as a member of our staff," said Coyne, who begins her fourth year as head coach of the program she started in 1996. "She has a very sound, fundamental knowledge of goalkeeping and is really going to help fine tune our goalkeepers. Her personality will be a nice addition to our staff, and she will be able to relate well to our players." 
Yarnell graduated from Richmond in 19()9 with a degree in studio art and a 
minor in education. 
She started every game in her career and broke almost every Spider goalkeeping record during her career, including career saves (678). single-season saves (252), career save percentage (.559) and single-season save per­centage (.582). 
The Boothwyn, Pa., native, captained the team her senior year and played 707 of 840 total minutes in '99, saving 188 shots for a .536 save per­centage. 
Yarnell, who has staffed the Point Blank Goalkeeping Camp since 1996, played with the United States under-19 national team at the 1995 World Championships. 
She served as a member of the Richmond Student-Athlete Advisory Committee from 1997-99 and was president of the organization during her senior year. 
Yarnell also was a four­year starting goalkeeper on the Spider field hockey tellms and was a two-time Colonial Athletic Association all-con­ference field hockey selec-. tion.

and Lamont Smith, say their client must be tradod or grant­ed free agency before any money is returned. The club· says it will not give up its rights to Sanders. 
Sanders will have to decide on his own wh,ithcr to end his retirement, his father said. 
"He's a man," the elder Sandors said. "If he was 15, I would tell him." 
The dispute has gone to arbi­tration. 
William Sanders told The Detroit News he would advise his son to "return the money and go about his business" if he chooses to remain retired. 
Ware said Tuesday he was familiar with reports of William Sanders' plans to try to talk with his son about rejoining the Lions. But Ware said Sanders still has not said anything about returning to football. 
William Sanders said he would advise his son that he return to the Lions on the con­dition that he be traded after breaking Payton's record. 
PGA 
Duval, Wood team up for Ryder practice 
Associated I'ress 
BROOKLINE. Mass. 
David Duval and Tiger Woods have spent a lot of time with each other this week at The Country Club -in their press conference, but more significant­ly inside the ropes. 
Woods and Duval have been in the same foursome for two straight days of practice for the Ryder Cup, and captain Ben Crenshaw has been toying with the idea of sending out the top two players in the world as a formidable team. 
"It's certainly a possibility," he said. "I don't know that you're going to see that pairing in the first round. But it's very safe to say that both of them are going to play a lot." · 

Woods only smiled and said, "We'll see," when asked he might be paired with Duval. 
One school of thought is that a Woods-Duval team might send a message that the United States wants to come out with both guns. blazing. Then again, it could backfire, since there are no greater scalps than the top two players in the world . 
European captain Mark James doesn't subscribe to either. 
"If two of our guys beat them, that's a fantastic win," he said. "But I don't think it's going to be affecting the end result of the matches. If a pair wins or loses one match, I don't think it will reduce one team to tears." 
The teams must submit pair­ings Thursday afternoon for the first round of alternate-shot matches.

Sosa grounded into a double play, then walked twice off Garrett Stephenson (6-21, bringing more boos from a crowd that came to see a home run, not a bases on balls. 
Mark Grace hit a go-ahead two-run triple in the fifth, an inning that began with Trachsel's single after Cardinals catcher l\larcus Jensen dropped his foul popup for an error. 
Two outs later, Sosa walked and Grace hit a liner to right that eluded Howard and went to the wall. putting the Cubs ahead 4-2. Howard hit his sixth homer in the sixth, making it a one-run game, but Chicago's Jeff Blauser hit a solo homer in the seventh to restore the two-run lead.

Vladimir Nunez (6-10) went 7 2/3 innings, allowing four runs and four hits. 
After striking out Chris Widger and Geoff Blum to open the third, Nunez gave up singles to Batista and Rondell Wbite. Mert:ed followed with a double into the left-field corner.

Pirates 3, Astros 2 

Todd Hitchie outpitched 20-game winnrr Josr Lima and the Pittsburgh Pirates turned two unusual double plays in as many innings to slow Houston's run at a third straight divi­sion title, beating the Astros. 
The Pirates, playing without 39­homPr hitter Brian Giles, who will miss the rest of the 
season with a broken finger, took two of three from the NL Central-lead­ing Astros. They began their final homestand of the season by winning two of three from second-place Cincinnati. 
The Astros, still not able to pull away from the Reds in the division race, lost their fifth in seven games. They began the night with a 3 1/2-game lead over Cincinnati, which played later at San Diego. 
Lima (20-9) lost his second start in a row since becoming the fifth 20-game winner in Astros' history despite hold­ing the Pirates to three runs and five hits and striking out 10 in eight innings. He was coming off his worst start of the season, an 11-8 loss to St. Louis in which he lasted 3 2/3 innings. 
Ritchie (14-9), in the minors when the season began and never a starter before this year, won his team-high 14th decision by limiting the Astros to two runs and six hits and striking out 10 in his second complete game. He has won four of his last five decisions. 
Ritchie was helped by some good defense and some bad Houston baserunning that halted a pair of Astros threats. 
With the score tied at 2 in the sixth, Stan .Javier and Carl Everett singled around Jeff Bagwell's strikeout. Ken Caminiti walked. Javier then broke for the plate on Daryle Ward's slow-hit grounder to first baseman Kevin Young and was called out on a close play. 
Rather than holding at third, Everett came nearly halfway down the line and was tagged out by catcher Joe Oliver to complete the double play. 
An inning later, Ricky Gutierrez sin­gled with one out and Lima attempted to bunt him up. 
But Oliver gambled by throwing to second rather than taking the sure out at first and his ·throw just beat Gutierrez. With Lima running at less than full speed up the line, shortstop 
Abraham Nunez's throw to first beat him by more than a step. 
Diamondbacks 11, Rockies 3 
\laH Williams homered and drove in four runs and Andy Benes pitched eight strong innings and had three RBIs as the Arizona Diamondbacks 
· drew closer to clinching the NL West division title with a victory over the Colorado Rockies. . Arizona, in just its second season. lowered its magic number for clinch­ing the NL West to two. Tlrn Diamondbacks b11gan the day with a nino7gamo lead over second­place San Francisco. Williams, who is 23-for-61 with four home runs and 14 RBJs in his last 14 games, hit a three-run homer, his 
35th, and has a r.areer-high 137 HBis. 
Jay Bell and Steve Pinley added two 
hits each for the Diamondbat:ks, win­
ners of 13 of their last 17 games. 
Benes (12-12) gave up three runs 
and seven hits, struck out four and 
walked one. He hit a two-run single in 
the fifth and walked with the bases 
loaded in tbe seventh. 
Bon Petrick drove in three runs with 
a pair of home runs. Colorado manag­
er Jim Leyland rested Uante Bichette, 
Vinny Castilla and NL-batting leader 
Larry Walker. 
The Diamondbacks scored four runs 
in the first inning against Luther

Edgard Clemente led off the third 
inning with a single to center and 
Petrick follo,ved with a home run to 
left. The Diamondbacks increased 
their lead to 7-2 in the fifth inning on 
Benes' single. 
Petrick hit his second home run of 
the game in the fifth, for his fourth 
homer and first career multihomer 
game. Arizona used three walks and a 
single to score twice in the seventh 
inning. Mike Porzio walked Erubiel 
Durazo, gave up a single to Finley and 
walked Kelly Stinnett to load bases. 
Dave Wainhouse replaced Porzio and walked Benes and gave up a sacrifice fly. Williams and Stinnett had RBI dou­bles in the eighth inning. 
Braves 5, Mets 2 
For a team involved in its first 
September pennant race since 1993, ... 
the Atlanta Braves look right at home. 
Chipper Jones homered again, pinch­hrtter Keith Lockhart broke a seventh­inning tie with a sacrifice fly and the Braves extended their NL East lead to three games over New York, beating the Mets. 
Tom Glavine (12-11) worked seven strong innings, his performance tar­nished onlv bv Mike Piazza's two-run homer in .the fourth. The 1998 Cy Young winner won for the only second time in his last eight starts. 
The Braves began the three-game series with a slender one-game over New York, but they've taken a major step toward extending their unprece­dented streak of seven straight divi­sion titles. The Mets still have hope: the teams meet again next week in a three-game series at Shea Stadium. 
New York had a 3 1/2-game lead in the wild-card race over Cincinnati, which played later at San Diego. 
The Braves haven't played such a meaningful game at this time of year since 19 93, when .they beat San Francisco by one game in the NL West. Since the strike-shortened '94 season, Atlanta has won four straight East titles by an average margin of 14 games. 
Jones was serenaded with chants of "MVP! MVP! MVP" after his 44th homer, a two-run shot in the first that gave the Braves a quick lead. It was his third homer in two days against the Mets, following up a pair of solo shots in the series opener that accounted for both Atlanta runs in a 2­1 victorv. 
After ·Piazza's homer tied the game at 2, the Braves squeezed out the go­ahead run in tho seventh against Orel Hershiser (13-11). With ono out, Andruw Jones and Eddie Perez hit consecutivo sing!es.before Lockhart, batting for Walt Weiss, sent a low liner to center. 
Darryl Hamilton made a sliding catch, but had no chance of gAtting the speedy Jones at the plate. 
The Braves escaped a major jam during a wild eighth. The Mets loaded the bases with one out, but Terry IV!ulholland -the fourth Atlanta pitch­er of the inning -struck out Bnbby Bonilla and retired Todd Pratt on a grounder to second.

however, isn't winning. 
What is a cliche when a team is winning becomes as preva­lent as Jarious Jackson bounced option pitches when a team is losing. It seems that whenever a team begins to lose. certain people conduct McCarthy-like witch hunts for fair-weather fans, searching for one ounce of disloyalty. 
These so-called diehards search campus hoping to find a negative comment about their team. \Vb.en one is found they immediately meet with the other members of the fair­weather fan Gestapo and for­mulate plans to deal wit these traitors. 
Sometimes a nasty e-mail does the trick. 
Sometimes they must write into the newspapers chastising others for their skepticism or lack of faith. 
Sometimes they make grand displays at public events of their undying love and hope for their team. 
They accuse others of selling out and giving up. They also consider themselves better than others to the point of fix­ing an imaginary red "F" to your breast labeling you as a ­brace yourself -fair-weather fan. 
I invite you to join me. Join the hundreds of other fair­weather fans on campus. But you better hurry because the blacklist is filling up. In fact, the blacklist consists of almost everyone on campus at one

Why, you ask? How can thousands of the best fans in the world desert their team and become fair-weather fans? 
The simple answer to this question is that many of the accusers, in reality, have no idea what a fair-weather fan is. They simply mislabel anyone with whom they disagree, with­out regard to the difference between fair-weather fans and real fans.

Turnovers plague Irish offensive line 

By BRIAN KESSLER 
Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's football team had a dillicult time handling the last three losses, but it has also had some trouble handling the ball. 
"Stop the turnovers, that's the biggest thing right now," senior quarterback Jarious Jackson said. ''I've had a few turnovers myself and so have some other people, but at the same time I'm concerned about mine. I need to stop turnovers myself because I'm the quarterback and hopefully that will help us out as well." 
Jackson had difficulty pitch­ing the ball against Michigan and Purdue, but showed some improvement in last Saturday's game against Michigan Stjtte. 
He does, however, have six interceptwns, equaling his total all last season. 
"We have to make some bet­ter decisions," offensive coordi­nator Kevin Rogers said. "We had some underthrown balls that resulted in interceptions the other day. A lot of [turnovers] have been due to interceptions and fumbles by the quarterback, but obviously we are trying to rectify the situ­ation." 
With nearly a 2-1 turnover ratio in favor of Irish oppo­nents. the team begins to ques­tion how aggressive it can be. 
The Irish didn't run the option as much against Michigan State and was tenta­tive throwing the ball deep down the field. 
"Sure you get a little bit gun shy when you turn the ball over," Rogers said. "You tend to get a little more conservative _and not try things as much." 
Rogers and the rest of the coaching staff stressed protect­ing the ball in practice. 
JOHN DAILY/The Observer 

Michigan State free safety Amp Campbell intercepts Jarious Jackson's pass intended for Bobby Brown in the end zone during last weekend's loss to the Spartans. 
"We're trying to make more of an emphasis on ball security everyday with all the skill play­ers," Rogers said. "[You work on] blatant ball security, just making sure you isolate the football and take care of it. I'm not sure we've had one fumble this year that was the result of a big hit or anything like that, but fumbles you can't excuse anyway. We're trying to make a concerted effort to cut back." 
So far, the Irish are showing signs of improvement. 
"The ball is on the ground less in practice, but you really can't say you are making progress until you do it in the game," Rogers said. "It's inex­cusable what we've been doing." 
The real test for Notre Dame will come against Oklahoma. After four games, the Irish haven't come close to playing error-free football and if they hope to turn the season around, they will have to start against the Sooners. For now, the Irish have an extra week to work on taking care of the ball. 
"You like to think [the bye week will help]," Rogers said. "I think with a young group of guys, you afford the extra opportunity to prepare and practice and go through assign­ments. Hopefully, we'll be a lit­tle more mistake free. We're sitting here at 1-3 but I think we're getting better."

Welsh breezes past PW in season opener 
By STEVE KEPPEL Sports Writer 
A young and rejuvenated Welsh team defeated Pasquerilla West 16-0 Tuesday. 
After an unsuccessful sea­son last year, Welsh looked to start off this season on the right track. 
And that's exactly what it did. Midway through the first half, Welsh quarterback Stef Eden had a long run down to about the 20-yard line. 

On the very next play, she fired a strike to her running back for Welsh's first score. The two-point conversion put them up 8-0. 
Before the end of the half, the PW offense started dri­ving down the field. 
Welsh's strong defense put pressure on quarterback Andi Will forcing her lo 
throw an interception with no time remaining, ending their hopes of a score. 
Welsh's defense came out tough in the second half by once again picking off an errant Will pass. 
The Welsh offense contin­ued to move the ball with Eden's passing and running, but had two touchdowns called back because of penal­ties. 
Eden slarted off her team's 
fourth quarter drive with a long pass over the middle. After a few incomplete pass­es, she again hit the running back out of thfl backfield for a 15-yard score. The two­point conversion put Welsh up 16-0. 
On the nP-xt series, Will ended PW's hopes of a come­back by throwing her third intercPption of the night with
