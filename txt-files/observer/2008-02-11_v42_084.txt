Basketball fans camp out in 'Breytopia' 
Leprechaun Legion members spend Thursday, Friday before game outside Joyce Center 
By CHRIS HINE News Writer 
They called it Breytopia. 
Named for Notre Dame's men's basketball coach Mike Brny, Breytopia was the camp­site set up by members of the Leprechaun Legion on Thursday night near Gate 11 of the Joyce Center. Approximately 50 students camped out in anticipation of Notre Dame's game against Marquette on Saturday. 
Senior Kyle Miller, who helped organize Breytopia, said he and 15 other fans start­ed camping out Thursday and were joined by more on Friday. 
Brey said most Breytopians are dedicated fans who having been following the team for years.

By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
The fundraising committee for the third annual Saint Mary's Dance Marathon will host Charity Denim, a California-based company that sells discounted jeans to raise money, today in the basement of the Student Center from 2 to 8 p.m. 
The money raised through the event will benefit the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. 
According to fundraising chair Maura Clougherty, jeans that are normally sold for $70-$200 will be available for 40-70 percent off the regular price. Charity Denim accepts cash and credit cards and offers jeans from a number of brands, including 7 For All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, True Religion, Antik, Blue Cult, Joe's Jeans, Miss Sixty and Yanuk, Clougherty said. 
The Dance Marathon com­mittee will charge a $1 entrance fee in addition to receiving 10 percent of the profits of today's sales. The total amount raised in this and other events will not be revealed until the Dance Marathon on April 4.

The media has latched onto Barack 
Obama's presidential campaign as the 
potential "first black president." It makes 
for a great story-the skinny kid with 
the funny name, coming from a single 
parent household to rise above race and 
racism to take America's greatest oflice. 
In fact, it more than makes for a great 
story -it writes itself. I Iowever, the real­
ity of the situation is that the media's 
black-and-white portrayal of the candi­
date doesn't paint the entire picture. 
Barack Obama, like myself and many other people in this country, is a multi­racial person. Obama spent much of his ~~arly life living in Hawaii before attend­ing Columbia University and Harvard law school. He's not exactly another brother from the street. 
While I understand that the story of Barack's rise to imminent superstardom makes f(>r a great story, the fact is, he has as much a claim to becoming our nation's 43rd white president as her first black president. 
Regardless of your personal opinions on his politics, there can be no denying that Barack Obama is a political super­star and a media phenomenon. Everywhere he goes, people turn out to hear him speak in record numbers. He has a smile made for camera flashbulbs and a voice made for the microphone. Ever since delivering the keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Barack has burst onto the scene, to the point where four years later he is in deadlocked contention for the Democratic presidential nomination. Obama is a brilliant orator who has inspired and moved a large part of the nation with his infectious message of bringing change to Washington. 
My point is not to comment on Baraek's politics one way or another, but rather to comment on how the national media have made this presidential race about race. 
By characteri7lng Barack as America's first black president, the media have set up a convenient and simple showdown in the Democratic primary between Obama and Hillary Clinton. Man vs. woman. Black vs. white. 
There's just one problem. It's not as simple as that.

PETA opposes tribute to fried chicken 
FRANKFORT, Ky. Animals rights advocates are squawking at a meas­ure that would make fried chicken Kentucky's official picnic food. 
State Rep. Charles Siler is sponsoring legislation to assign the designation to KFC's "finger lickin' good" chicken, first served by Colonel Harland Sanders in 1940. 
The late colonel's fried chicken deserves the title because of the worldwide attention and economic benefit it has brought to the state, Siler said. KFC, a subsidiary of Louisville­based Yum Brands Inc., has 11,000 restaurants in more than 80 countries. 

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals bris­tles at the idea. The animal rights group claims that the chickens KFC serves are abused, even tortured. 
Woman takes plea deal In lousy lawn case 
OREM, Utah -When 70­year-old Betty Perry was accused of neglecting her lawn, she became defiant. 
Perry was arrested, handcuffed and briefly 
jailed in July for declining a ticket for failing to water her lawn. 
She agreed on Friday to resolve her case by plead­ing guilty to a disorderly conduct charge and paying a $100 fine. She also faces six months of probation. 
Perry was scheduled to go to trial Monday on a more serious charge of resisting arrest for refusing to give her name, accept a citation or allow herself to be handcuffed on her front steps.

Station lacks student audience 
WSND 88.9 adds indie music, promotions to appeal to ND population 
By BRIAN MCKENZIE News Writer 
WSND 88.9, Notre Dame's classical radio station, targets students in its programming, but the students aren't tuning in. 
"It's a constant struggle to get students aware," station manager Stephanie Yoshida said. "To have something like this here and to have students not know about it really astounds me." 
WSND 88.9 focuses on clas­sical music and also airs jazz, Celtic and Broadway music as well as news and a Harley­Davidson-sponsored astrono­my program, said Ed Jaroszewski, a radio techni­cian that's worked for the sta­tion for 35 years. 
Recently the station has also begun playing college rock and indie after midnight "to appeal to as broad an audi­ence as possible," Yoshida said. 
Yoshida said that while much of the current audience is made up of people in the South Bend community, the station has begun offering promotional products, such as concert tickets to performanc­es by the Notre Dame Symphony, in order to target the Notre Dame student popu­lation. 
"Most of the callers to my show are members of the broader South Bend commu­nity rather than Notre Dame students," she said. "Our advertisements mostly target students, though, because they're easier to reach and may not have lived in the area long enough to know which radio stations are available." 
However, according to Yoshida, one of the major obstacles the station faces is the sheer lack of radios on campus. Moreover, the station is not allowed to broadcast online. 
"I wish that we could broad­cast online, but because of FCC regulations, we can't," Yoshida said. 
Jaroszewski said the station has also been affected by edu­cational budget cuts to musi­cal programs. 
"The arts have taken a beating and I've noticed that, having worked at the local symphony, that younger peo­ple aren't attending the con­certs," he said. 
Yoshida said one selling point of the station was its accessibility, allowing stu­dents to request nearly half of the songs played during the weekend on-air hours. 
"It is unusual for classical stations to have a request hour. For the few that do, it's usually confined to a few hours," she said. "We'd like to think of ourselves as very democratic." 
When asked, several stu­
dents said they really had no knowledge of WSND, some­thing the group hopes to counter with its advertising. 
Nicholas Dan, a sophomore, said he listens only to online stations because he doesn't have a radio. 
"Besides, I'm not really sure what WSND plays," he said. 
"I've heard of the station, but I can't remember listen­ing to it," said John Fahy, a Stanford assistant rector and graduate student in theology. "I wouldn't say that I'm unin­terested in classical music, but I just don't listen to much radio. I'm not very familiar with its programming, either." 
Nonetheless, Yoshida, who is also a classically-trained violinist, said she hopes stu­dents will be enticed by the station's marketing and begin listening to WSND 88.9 in order to develop a greater appreciation of classical music. 
"For me, classical music has really tapped into my imagi­nation. It lets me experience something utterly indescrib­able, something wonderful and opens a window into a world of sheer beauty and possibilities," Yoshida said. "If we're able to introduce this to just one more person, then I think we'll have made progress."

NAACP hosts talk on relationship issues 
By DENNIS SLATER News Writer 
The North American Association of Colored Persons (NAACP) campus group invited students and faculty members to meet for a discussion on relatione ships over dinner Stmday evening in the South Dining Hall Hospitality Room. 
The participants came to dis­cuss careers, families and rela­tionships between males and females as well as between peo­ple of the same sex, said Mallory Jacobs, the vice president of Notre Dame's NAACP chapter. 
"There is normally a retreat every two years," Jacobs said. "But this year we wanted to do something for the students on a smaller scale." 
Students said the prospect of hearing a variety of viewpoints on gender relations piqued their curiosity. 
"I came to this dinner because it seemed to be a very interesting topic I wanted to find out more about," freshman Amanda Wilson said. "Gender relations at Notre Dame is a very interesting subject to students and that aspect of this event intrigued me." 
The intimate setting fostered close discussion about the rela­tionships people encounter and how to deal with them. Conversations were not public, in order to encourage people to speak freely, but Jacobs said before the dinner the focus would be "to talk about how to balance working careers while maintain­ing relationships." 

Video clips from Tyler Perry's movie "Why Did I Get Married" were shown to stimulate conver­sation about relationships involv­ing communication and trust. The discussion was meant to be all­encompassing and covered not only heterosexual marriage but also homosexual relationships. 
Faculty and staff members in attendance included assistant vice president in the Office of General Counsel Lois Jackson, assistant director at Mendoza College of Business Connie Porter, and director of the Educational Talent Search Warren Outlaw. 
Each faculty member led a dis­cussion where he or she offered insights about relationships dur­ing and after college by recount­ing personal experiences. Students had the opportunity to describe a few of their own expe­riences and receive feedback. 
Several questions were posed as conversation starters, includ­ing "What does it mean to be happy?" and "What is love in a relationship and is it enough?" 
"This event is important because relationships are some­thing we all have in common," freshman Isabel Chirase said. "We all deal with them during and after college and it is a com­mon bond between all of our stu­dents."

Bishops 
continued from page 1 

Among those bishops is Father John D'Arcy, bishop of the Catholic diocese of Fort Wayno-South Bend, who has made annual statements against the "Monologues" and the play's presence at Notre Damn. The play, which has been performed on campus six of the past seven years, "reduces sexuality to a partic­ular organ of a woman's body separate from the person of the woman, from her soul and her spirit," D'Arcy said in 2006. 
Arter somfl of the bishops found out from the University the "Monologues" was likely to be performed on campus in March. there was some "give and take" between thfl semi­nar's organizers and members of the administration, Cavadini said. But the bishops did not attempt to force or pressure the 
University or Cavadini said.

Assistant Vice President for News and Information Dennis Brown said in a statement Friday that thfl University understood and respected the bishops' concerns. 

"We understand that not all are in full agreement about the propriety of allowing per­formances of this play on a Catholic campus," he said. 
According to Brown, the 
University worked "collab­oratively" with the bishops to move the semi­nar off campus out of respect for everyone involved. 
The seminar -entitled "The Eloquence of Teaching" and hosted by the USCCB'S 

Committee on Doctrine and the University's Institute. for Church Life -is specifically geared toward docent bishops and is thus not open to the public. Therefore, the decision to move the seminar off cam­pus was also not meant to become a highly publicized one,

Cavadini, who is a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine, stressed that the bishops' actions were not meant to be a public form of protest against the University's decision to conditionally allow the "Monologues."

After initiating a 10-week­long campus-wide discussion about academic freedom and Catholic character, Jenkins announced in 2006 he would not ban the sexually explicit play if it were performed for strictly academic -and not fundraising purposes. Organizers also had to seek spon­

online posts on the Web site ndnation.com. 
Some members of the Web site, along with Sbarro and Brey himself, brought food and drinks for the campers. Brey visited with the Breytopians on Friday and said he hopes the bug that is running through his team right now didn't affect the campers. 
"I got them some pizza, hung out with them. I saw that line outside of my off'ice," Brey said. "The camp-out guys are awe­some. I hope they don't have the flu from being out there so long." 
During the game, many campers painted their chest black with green lettering that spelled out "Go Irish Breytopia." 
Freshman Blair Rasmus was the person who dubbed the campsite "Breytopia." 
"It's just a good feeling that we're overcome with, this feeling of Breytopia," Rasmus said. 
But the term Breytopia is something that both Brey and his wife, Tish, are very familiar with. 
"That's funny because Tish says living with me is like that," Brey said. "She said it's been twenty-four years of Breytopia." 
The Breytopians watched Notre Dame defeat Marquette 86-83 on Saturday and improve to 8­2 in the Big East, one half game behind conference leader Georgetown.

Proposal 
continued from page 1 
Proposal, ask academic depart­ments to ensure that "multiple viewpoints and voices on con­troversial topics can be heard, an appropriatn balance among viewpoints is maintainnd, and, when a significant issue in the Catholic tradition is touched upon, that tradition should bn presentnd." 
If approved, tho "Monologuns" would run for three nights in late March, according to co-organizer Lisa Hauh. An academic panel dis­cussion would follow each per­formance, examining the play from theological. sociological and psychological perspectives. The sexually-explicit play would be pnrformed in a classroom sntting and would not charge for ticknts. in accordance with the Common Proposal. 
The play's organizers are working to finalize which facul­ty members will speak on the academie panels. This informa­tion is an important part of the proposal for Hoche, Hauh said. 

Whon asked what events rnquire a collr.ge dean to approvn a department's spon­sorship, Hoche said: "That rnquires prudential judgment. Ono can not say prneisoly.... Orw can't stipulate critoria that would darily nvnry possible sit­uation." 
In this caso, Hoehn said, the "Monologuns" has benn per­fornwd on campus six of the last snvnn yoars and has been publicly criticized by South Bend-Fort Wayne Bishop John D'Arcy. D'Arcy issued a nine­page statement in the spring of 2006 where he criticized Jenkins' decision to permit the play and his rationale for doing so. 
'The Bishop is. of course, the lirst teacher of faith and morals in the diocese and we are a Catholic university in his dio­cese," Roche said, noting that thflse circumstances help quali­fy the production as a contro­versial one that warrants a eloser look by the college dean. 
"It doesn't mean we agree with D'Arcy but it does mean we would respect those kinds of views and try to give it a broad­er context so students under­stand the way in which the play ... causes concern for someone from a Catholic perspective." 
If Hoche approves the "Monologues" proposal, the play will move forward. If he does not, he will explain his rationale for doing do to the department chairs, Roche said. Should the chairs disagree with Hoche's reasoning, then the issue will be discussed with the Arts and Letters College Council, which is advisory to Hoehe. 
If disagreement persists, the play would be reviewed by an ad-hoc advisory committee, gathP.red by the University provost. 
But. Roche said, "This is not a situation where I anticipate a huge conflict."

12,000 Darfur refugees enter Chad 
GENEVA-Up to 12,000 refugees fled Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad over the weekend following air strikes by the Sudanese military and thousands more may be coming, the U.N. refugee agency said Sunday. 
The agency was bringing emergency assis­tance to the Chad border where the Darfur refugees were giving detailed descriptions of air attacks Friday on three West Darfur towns. 
The refugees are "destitute and terrified," said Helene Caux, spokeswoman for the U.N. I Iigh Commissioner for Refugees headquartered in Geneva. "They told of their villages being looted and burned, and encircled by militia." Most of the new refugees in Chad are men and they told the U.N. that thousands of women and children are on their way, Caux added.

On Friday, shortly after Allen Superior Court Judge Kenneth Scheibenberger denied Kelty's attorneys' motion to dismiss the indictments, defense attorney Larry Mackey said he intend­ed to seek an emergency hearing before the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
If Scheibenberger grants that request, it may delay Kelty's Aug. 18 trial date. 
During Friday's hearing, Scheibenberger granted Sigler's request to amend Kelty's indictments to include the phrase "knowingly and intentionally."

Gates: Iraqi leaders face hard choices 
Defense secretary cites passage of amnesty law as example of political progress 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Hard choices face Iraq's political leaders on how to stabilize the country despite promising new signs of progress toward reconcilia­tion, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday. 
"They seem to have become energized over the last few weeks," Gates said. The Pentagon chief told reporters who traveled with him from a conference in Germany that he wants to "see what the prospects are for further suc­cess in the next couple of months." 
In an interview on the trip to Iraq, Gates cited the recent passage of an amnesty law as an example of political progress. lie said he would ask Iraqi leaders to assess the prospects for other important steps such as passing a law that would spell out power­sharing between the provinces and the national government. 
He compared the struggle over that idea to the U.S. founding fathers' quest to find a constitutional compromise on how to share power in Congress between big and small states.

Caucus results questioned 
Huckabee's campaign to investigate McCain's Washington victory 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Hepublican presidential can­didate Mike Huckabee is cry­ing foul after John McCain's 
apparent  victory  in  the  
Washington  caucuses  on  
Saturday.  

Huckabee's campaign released a statement Sunday saying it will be exploring all available legal options regarding the "dubious final results."Arizona Sen. McCain was announced as the victor in the caucuses with 26 per­cent of the vote to Huckabee's 24 percent. 
But Huckabee's campaign chairman, Ed Hollins, said Luke Esser, Washington's Hepubliean Party chairman, chose to eall the race too quickly for MeCain. 
Hollins said Huckabee was losing by 242 votes with 87 percent of' the vote counted. lie said tlHHe were another 1,500 or so votes that were apparently not counted. 
"That is an outrage," Hollins said. 
Hollins said the Huckabee campaign's lawyers will be on the ground in Washington soon to see why the count took so long, and why thn vote-counting was stopped prnmatmely. 
"It would be a disservice to nvery voter in Washington state to not pursue a full accounting of all votes cast," Hollins said. " ... As I said, we are prepared to go to court, and we arc also prepared to take our case all the way to the Hepubliean National Convention in September." 
Esser said Sunday evening that MeCain's lead had nar­rowed, but only slightly. With just more than 93 pereent of results in, Esser said McCain had 3,621 prneinct delegates 
(25.4 percent) to Huckabee's 3,39R (23.R percent)-a dif­ferenee of 223 out of 14,253 elected at that point. 
Latn Saturday night, MeCain had 3,46R precinct delegates to Huckabee's 3,226 -a dif­ference of 242. 

Esser said despite at a state convention next Huckabee closing the margin, weekend. he is still confident with his He has pledged to stay in declaration that McCain is the the race until a candidate winner. earns the 1,191 delegates

However, he badly trails McCain, the likely nominee, in the ovnrall race for delegates. Some say he should even step aside as a way to help the GOP maintain resources for the general election. 
Huckabee described such talk as "total nonsense." 
"The Democrats haven't settled their nominee either, so for us to suddenly act like we have to all step aside and have a coronation instead of an election, that's the antithe­sis of everything Hepublicans are supposed to believe," he said on "Meet the Press" on NBC. "We believe competition breeds excellence and the lack of it breeds mediocrity." 
Huckabee said even he was surprised by Saturday's results. Huckabee won Kansas' delegates, but fell short of 50 percent in Louisiana, the threshold needed to claim the 20 dele­gates that were available. Instead, they will be awarded

He continued to dellect talk of interest in being McCain's choice for vice president. 
''I'm not going to be asked. I think it's pretty evident that there would be a whole lot of people on the list long, long before me, and one of them would say 'yes,"' Huckabee said. 
Told that McCain was heavi­ly favored to win the primar­ies in Maryland and Virginia on Tuesday, Huckabee said he would do better than expect­ed. 
"I think we'll get a nice lit­tle bump out of what hap­pened in Kansas," Huckabee said. 
Huckabee spent part of Sunday at services at the late Rev. Jerry Falwell's church in Lynchburg, Va. The candidate steered clear of politics, but was welcomed as a "dear friend" by the Hev. Jonathan Falwell, who became pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church after his father died last year. 

Oba111a beats Clinton in Maine's caucuses 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA -Barack Obama defeated Hillary Rodham Clinton in Maine presidential caucuses Sunday, grabbing a majority of delegates as the state's Democrats overlooked the snowy weather and turned out in heavy numbers for municipal gatherings. 
Democrats in 420 Maine towns and cities were deciding how the state's 24 delegates will be allotted at the party's national convention in August. Despite the weather, turnout was "incredible," party execu­tive director Arden Manning said. 
With 99 percent of the partic­ipating precincts reporting, Obama led in state delegates elected over Clinton, 2,079 to 1,396, with 18 uncommitted. 
Obama exulted in his recent victories in Maine and else­where, telling a crowd of 18,000 Sunday evening in Virginia Beach, Va., that "we have won on the Atlantic Coast, we have won on the Gulf Coast, we have won on the Pacific Coast" and places in between. 
Obama won 15 of Maine's delegates to the national con­vention and Clinton won nine. In the overall race for the nom­ination, Clinton leads with 1,136, including separately chosen party and elected offi­cials known as superdelegates. Obama has 1,108. 
The voting came a day aftnr Obama and Clinton made per­sonal appeals here, and after Obama picked up wins in Louisiana, Nebraska and Washington. 
Organizers had expected heavy participation at the cau­cuses, but snow was falling and gusting winds hit as many of the gatherings were scheduled. 
The weather didn't appear to have hurt turnout. Caucuses started late in Bangor and sev­eral other locations across the state because so many people showed up that they were lined up outside the doors. 
In Maine's largest city, Democrats carrying "Obama" and "Hillary" signs waited to get into the citywide caucus at

rate lines that snaked nearly 
three city blocks in opposite 
directions. 
Colin Johnson, an Obama supporter in Portland, said the Illinois senator is not a typical politician. "I'm convinced he's a once-in-a-generation leader," he said. 
"He's young and energetic and Washington and the White !louse could benefit from some fresh air," said Joe Lewis, another Obama supportnr. 
But Tony Donovan said Obama can use some more sea­soning. Donovan was support­ing Clinton because she, like him, was a baby boomer who shared similar values and because she has the experience and the team to lead in Washington. 
"Obama's a great guy. He'll be great in eight years," Donovan said. "lie doesn't have the experience in the Senate. lie doesn't have the experience in Washington. lie's not ready." 
A line waited to get into Augusta's caucus as Gov. John Baldacei, a Clinton supporter, addressed the crowd of a cou­ple hundred at the city's Cony High School. Asked why he decided to wait in line to par­ticipate, John Brandt said, "Getting rid of Hepublicans, once and for all." 
Though Maine's national del­egate count is small, Clinton and Obama, along with surro­gates, came to the state Saturday as their campaigns drew tighter after Super Tuesday. 
Thousands of people packed the Bangor Auditorium to hear Obama on Saturday and hun­dreds more who weren't allowed inside greeted him as he arrived. People also were stopped at the door as Clinton held a town hall-style gathering nearby at the University of Maine at Orono. She later stopped in Lewiston. 
Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, and husband, Bill, also visited, while Obama supporter Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts campaigned in two cities in the days before the vote.

money goes towards Hiley's (Hospital for Children(. I think it will be successful," Clougherty said. 
Common interest in chil­dren's issues was one of the major reasons why Clougherty thought a partner­ship with Charity Denim would be appropriate. 
"They work a lot with Children's Miracle Network, since Hiley is a part of that they're willing to come to Saint Mary's to do it," she said. 

Clougherty originally discov­ered Charity Denim through Facebook and said the group is known for working with sororities. 
After contacting the organi­zation, both Clougherty and Charity Denim agreed that Saint Mary's would be the perfect place to hold a fundraiser, "since we're all women," Clougherty said. "But we're opening this up to Notre Dame and Holy Cross as well." 
Although Clougherty said they had no specillc monetary goal, they have been advertis­ing the event as much as pos­sible. 
"We have been advertising it through e-mail, signs, on Facebook and just through word of mouth," she said. 
Charity Denim is one of many events the Dance Marathon committee has organized this year. The com­mittee has raised funds by selling "Sigma Mu Chi" appar­el and through the Spring Break Haffle, which is raffling off tanning and hair design packages. 
In addition, there are two events still in the planning stages, she said. One is a penny war between the Saint Mary's dorms, which will either occur the week before Dance Marathon, or at the actual event, she said. The other event being planned is a SK run/walk to be held the weekend before Dance Marathon, she said.

IN BRIEF 
No additional job cuts for Chrysler 
SAN FRANCISCO -The vice chairman of Chrysler LLC said Saturday he sees no further employment cuts as the automaker continues to restructure into a more customer-focused com­pany offering fewer models and better quality. 
Chrysler, which is restructuring after a majori­ty stake in the automaker was sold last summer to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, announced in November it planned to cut up to 11,000 jobs, including 8,000 to 10,000 hourly and 1,000 salaried positions. 
"We hope that's going to be the extent of it," Vice Chairman Jim Press told reporters during a round-table discussion at the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention. "You never know what the market is going to throw at us, but yes, the answer is that we have made the appropriate decisions." 
The cuts announced in November were in addition to a reduction of 13,000 jobs that Chrysler announced last February, including 11 ,000 hourly and 2,000 salaried workers in the 
U.S. and Canada. 
Stimulus plan may not stop downturn 
WASHINGTON -Despite remarkably quick passage, the economic aid plan and its cash rebates may come too late to prevent a recession this year. For many experts, however, the $168 billion boost to the lagging economy may mean the difference between a short downturn and something much more serious. 
The measure that President Bush plans to sign this coming week will send government pay­ments to more than 130 million people. Checks that will start showing up in mailboxes in May range from $300 to $1,200; households with children get an additional $300 per child. Businesses benefit. too, through tax breaks to increase investment spending on plants and equipment. 
The tax relief is intended to jump-start the economy. Politicians, worried about a recession in an election year, put aside their normal bick­ering to speed the proposal through Congress. 
Nonetheless, there is debate over how effective it will be. Critics say debt-burdened consumers will use the money to pay bills rather than spending the checks and spurring growth.

Yahoo rejects Microsoft takeover bid 
Board turns down $44.6 billion offer, concludes it undervalues the internet company 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc.'s board wilr reject Microsoft Corp.'s $44.6 billion takeover bid after concluding the unso­licited offer undervalues the slumping Internet pio­neer, a person familiar with the situation said Saturday. 
The decision could pro­voke a showdown between two of the world's most prominent technology com­panies with Internet search leader Google Inc. looming in the background. Leery of Microsoft expanding its turf on the Internet, Google already has offered to help Yahoo avert a takeover and urged antitrust regulators to take a hard look at the proposed deal. 
If the world's largest soft­ware maker wants Yahoo badly enough, Microsoft could try to override Yahoo's board by taking its offer -originally valued at $31 per share-directly to the shareholders. Pursuing that risky route probably will require Microsoft to attempt to oust Yahoo's current 10-member board. 

Alternatively, Microsoft could sweeten its bid.

Obama gains in delegate count 

Superdelegates to play critical role in Democratic primary elections

Of tlw 796 lawmakers, gover­

Clinton had 243 and Obama had 
156. That edge was responsible li1r Clinton's overall advantage in tho pursuit of delegates to secure tho party's nomination for pmsi­dent. A'~eording to the AP's latest tally, Clinton has 1.127 total dele­gatos and Obama has 1,093, ho;tding into Sunday's Dmnocratic caucuses in Maine. A candidato must get 2.205 deln­gatos to capturn the nomination. 
The nurnbors illustrate not only the rnmarkable proximity bntwenn the two candidates, but also the extraordinary influence superdnlngates could wield in determining who becomes the nominnn. Both campaigns are aggressivnly pursuing supnrdele­gatns, trumpeting their endorse­ments the moment they are secured. 
"I told my wife I'm probably going to bn pretty popular for a couplo months," chuckled Hichard Hay, a superdelegate and pmsident of the Gnorgia ehapter of the AFL-CIO. Hay said he will remain undecided because the labor federation has made no end o rsmmm t. 
"If they endorse, then I will, too," Hay said. 
The national party has named about 720 of the 796 supnrdele­gatos. The rnmainder will be cho­snn at state party eonventions in the spring and summer. AP rnporters have interviewed 95 percent of the named delegates, with thn most recent round of interviews taking place last week, after Supor Tuesday. 
For tlw first time since tho AP b'~gan contacting supordelegates last fall, more than half of them -399 -have endorsed a eandi­dal!l. Tlw remaining 320 or so dnlf1gatos said they are either undndded or uncommitted, mak­ing tlwrn tlw subjflct of intnnse lobbying by both campaigns.

"My strong belief is that if we end up with the most states and the most pledged delegates, and the most voters in the country, then it would be problematic for political insiders to overturn the judgment of the voters," he said. "I think that should be the guid­ing approach to determining who will be the nominee." 
Clinton, speaking to reporters on Saturday, argued that superdelegates should make up their own minds and pointedly noted that Obama has the endorsements of superdelegates John Kflrry and Edward Kennedy, both senators from Massachusetts, a state whose pri­mary Clinton won. 
"Superdfllegates are by design supposed to exercise independent judgment," she said. "If Senator Obama and his campaign contin­ue to push this position, which is to the contrary of what the defmi­tion of superdelngates has histori­cally been, I will look forward to receiving the support of Senator Kerry and Senator Kennedy." 

Unlike pledged delegates secured through a primary or a caucus, superdelegates can vote for whomever they choose, and they are not required to vote for the candidate they endorse. Indeed, some superdelegates who had endorsed other Democratic candidates have already switehed to Clinton or Obama or are recon­sidering their earlier choices. 
Democratic superdelegate Christine "Roz" Samuels of Montclair, N.J., said she backed off her preference for Clinton after hearing former President Bill Clinton scoff at Obama's stance on the Iraq war. 
''I'm disappointfld in a few things that were said a few weeks ago by President Clinton," she said. ''I'm going to have to revisit what I'm going to do betwefln now and when we vote."

POHT WENTWORTH-. 
Search crews found no trace 
Sunday of three workers 
still missing in the smolder­
ing remnants of a sugar 
refinery explosion last week 
that left five people dead 
and injured dozens more. 

Officials called off the 
search at sunset, but had 
not yet searched a part of 
the Imperial Sugar plant 
that was still burning and 
where the buildings were 
dangerously unstable. 

Sugar still burning in two of the refinery's three badly damaged, 100-foot storage silos threatened to weaken the towering structures to the point of collapsing if the fire wasn't extinguished soon, Fire Chief Greg Long said. 
He said firefighters hoped to smother the silo fires Monday by using construc­tion cranes to dump sand into silos. One of the silos blew up late Thursday, pos­sibly after combustible sugar dust ignited. 
Long said search crews had covered 95 percent of the massive refinery. While more bodies were not recov­ered, Long said it was unlikely eompany officials were wrong to believe three more workers remained inside. 
"They have used dilligence in getting me the exact number of people," said Long, who knows the miss­ing workers personally. "They're confident in it. Unfortunately, I need to be confident in it." 
Long said the areas that had not yet been searched were on the first floor of a building near the explosion, including a break room, where upper floors had col­lapsed. 
After shoring up the build­ing, crews would have to squeeze into tight spaces among the rubble to search them. 
Mounds of sugary sludge pouring out of the silos 
Sunday was solidifying, crfl­
ating another obstacle to 
the recovery efforts. A t1rn­
t1ghter said his search team 
had to usfl power tools to 
tear down a door glued shut 
by sticky sludge. 
"As you've got sugar that's 
crystalizing and running 
down the chutes, it's like 
concrete," Savannah­
Chatham County police Sgt. 
Mike Wilson said. 
Strong wind coming off the Savannah River made conditions even more haz­ardous for crews trying to prevent the silos and plant buildings from collapsing, Savannah Fire Capt. Mike Stanlfly said. 
"We have a very windy day and a very weak struc­ture," Stanley said. 
Meanwhile, none of the five recovered bodies have been positively idflntified, said Savannah-Chatham County police Detective Josh Hunt. 
Hunt said investigators have asked families for medical and dental records and any information about speeifie medical conditions, broken bones or surgeries the workers may have had to help identify the bodifls. 
"Unfortunately, due to the severity of this disaster, it's going to be a difficult con­clusion to reach," he said. 
Seventeen workers remained hospitalized Sunday in critical condition with severe burns. Three others were released Sunday, said Beth Frits of the Joseph M. Burn Center in Augusta. 
One of the critically injured, 49-year-old Gene Daniel Bryan Jr., moved his head Sunday in respons1~ to relatives, flven though he was in a medieally induced coma, said his sister, Penny Daley.

AFGHANISTAN 
Norway closes embassy 
Terror threats, past attacks prompt evacuation from Afghan capital 
Associated Press 
OSLO -Norway closed its embassy in the Afghan capital because of terror threats Sunday, nearly a month after a Norwegian journalist was among eight people killed in a suicide attack on a luxury hotel in Kabul. 
The Nordic nation, which recently said it would send more troops to the NATO force in Afghanistan. has been sin­gled out at least twice as a potential target by al-Qaida. 
"The embassy has been closed down today due to terror threats," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Kristin Melsom said. She would not describe the threats and said it was too early to say how long the embassy would be closed. 
A reporter for the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet was among those killed when mili­tants with suicide vests, grenades and AK-47 rifles attacked the Serena hotel in Kabul on Jan. 15. Norway's for­eign minister was in the hotel at the time, but he was unhurt and later said he did not think the attack was aimed at him. 
Nevertheless, the attack likely led Norway to review the threat level against its interests in Afghanistan, said Arne Strand, an Afghanistan expert at the Christian Michelsen Institute in Bergen, Norway's second biggest city. 
"The fact that the embassy has been closed indicates that the threat this time has been 
aimed  more  directly  at  
Norway,"  he  told  The  
Associated Press.  

In a security document dated Jan. 20, Afghanistan's Interior Ministry listed 15 locations ­including Norway's embassy ­that could be targeted by mili­tants. 
"According to detective reports, the enemies plan to launch a series of suicide attacks, explosions and harmful activities in Kabul city," said the report obtained by The Associated Press. "The enemies' first plan is to target some more vulnerable infrastructures of Kabul city." 
The embassies of Sweden, Belgium, India, Turkey, Finland and Indonesia were also listed. 
Government offices and three well-known Kabul hotels, including the Serena, were also said to be possible targets. 
Al-Qaida has singled out Norway at least twice in past years among nations that should be targeted because of its participation in the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan and a previous deployment in Iraq. 
The founder of the al-Qaida­linked Iraqi extremist group Ansar al-Islam, Kurdish leader Mullah Krekar, is a refugee in Norway but was declared a threat to national security in 2005 and ordered deported. He has not yet been expelled. 
Norway was also among the Western countries threatened by extremists during the uproar over Danish caricature of Islam's Prophet Muhammad in early 2006 because a Norwegian newspaper reprint­ed the drawings. 
On Friday, Norwegian Defense Minister Anne-Grete Stram-Erichsen said Norway will add 200 extra troops to its 500 soldiers in Afghanistan with the deployment of special forces and helicopters in March. 

RUSSIA 
Kosovo's split from Serbia raises tensions 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Russia may not come to outright blows with the West over Kosovo, but independence for the province seems sure to deep­en the Cold War-style chill settling over Europe. 
Detaching Kosovo from Serbia will likely aggravate disputes over a host of sensi­tive security issues ranging from missile defense to NATO membership for the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine. 
"There are several differ­ent issues coming together -that's what makes it so dangerous," said Anatol Lieven, a Russia expert who is a professor at King's College London and a senior fellow of the New America Foundation in Washington. 
Kosovo is sacred to Serbs, who call it the cradle of their statehood and religion. The province also strikes a chord in the President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin -for rea­sons beyond the roots Russia shares with Slavic, Orthodox Christian Serbia. 
Kosovo stands as a symbol of Russia's weakness in the post-Soviet era. Despite its fury over the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia denounced by Boris Yeltsin as a return to the "Stone Age" -Moscow recognized a peace deal that put the mostly ethnic Albanian province under the control of the U.N. and the Western alliance. 
Putin has built his popular­ity on restoring Russian pride, pushing to recapture its global clout and showing increasing assertiveness toward the West. That means acquiescence is off the table. 
"The issue is not so much Kosovo itself but Russia's grandeur," said Yevgeny Volk, head of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow office. 
Speculation that Russia would strike a compromise with the West was shattered last August when Moscow torpedoed a plan for super­vised independence by threatening a U.N. Security Council veto.

On Feb. 9, 11 people were shot and killed in three separate incidents across Milwaukee's north side-all within a 90-minute time span. 
A casual eye on the news or an inter­net search for recent shootings reveals that gun violence in the U.S. is out of control. 
The tragedies above are unfortunate­ly representative of repeated storylines in crime reports of shootings: Innocent victims are caught in the line of fire. A member of a community who perceives himself as disenfranchised picks up a gun as his supposed last re"sort. Young people both pull the trigger and are tar­gets of bullets, transformed into killers or cheated of their lives in one terrify­ing moment. 
On March 18, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a ease that 

determines whether the much-debatnd 
Second Amendment right to bear arms 
applins to the individual. Hampant gun violence as illustrated by the stories 
above-just a sampling ofthe shoot­ings that occurred in the U.S. this month -will serve only as a backdrop to this question of constitutional inter­pretation. 
But even without serious considera­tion of the violnnee tied to legally­owned guns across the nation (a state­ment that could characterize the speeches of Republican primary fron­trunners as well as the arguments in the pending Supreme Court ease). a look at historieal precedent shows that the issue of gun ownership rights is much more complex than the NHA would have us think. 
At issue in tho case is Washington, D.C.'s legislation restricting dtizens from lngally owning handguns -a ban that has been in place for over 30 years in the district. 
Following legal challenges from resi­dents that began in 2003, a fpderal appeals court last year found the hand­gun ban unconstitutional, eiting the Second Amendment. 
But the city's officials respond that lifting the ban will only make violence worse. Washington, D.C., Mayor Adrian Fenty held a rally this fall with the mes­sage that more handguns mnan more crime. Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier agreed: "The weakening of the district's gun law will inevitably lead to an increase in injury, and worse, death." 
The district's legal argument in the upcoming case before the Supreme Court takes the position adopted by a majority of the nation's appeals courts that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms only as a collective, civic right related to military serviee. 
Precedent is on their side. Not one law regulating the sale or possession of guns was struck down on the basis of the Second Amendment for two cen­turies following its ratification. 
Throughout the 19th century, states not only regulated sales and ownership 
of guns, but many enforced legislation 
that prohibited carrying concealed 
firearms. 
The Courts eonsistently upheld these laws against Second Amendment chal­lenges. 
Even the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1931 ease indicated that the right to possess firearms was written in rngards to maintaining the "well-rngulatnd Militia" of' the Second Amendment. The dneision held that the Second Amendmnnt "must bn intnrpreted and applied" with the view of maintaining a militia. 
The 1931 dedsion has been eitnd with littln exception by all the United States Circuit Courts dedsions that have rejected lngal challenges to federal firearm regulations over the last six deeadns. 
On Friday, Dick Chenny exereised his title of Prnsident of tlw Senate, and added his signature to an amicus brief signed by 55 senators and 250 repre­sentatives, which urgns the justiees to oppose the ban and uphold the individ­ual-basnd interprntation of the Second Amendment. 
These lawmaknrs need to boar in mind the violence that occurred across the country last wnek, and that which will surely follow-similar incidents, many involving legally-owned guns, in the weeks to comA. But lawmakers, like the justices, must also look to two cen­turies of precedent related to common sense and pragmatic gun regulation. Until they do, lists of tragedies like the one at the start of this piece will be eas­ily compiled.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Big donations come in small packages 
The article "NO gives little cash to hopefuls" (Feb. 8) asserted that Notre Dame students and professors have contributed signif­icantly less money in donations to U.S. presidential campaigns than their counterparts at other universities. This statement is misleading. The article's claim was based on federal campaign finance records. These records, however, only include data on contributions exceeding $200. Accordingly, they are a faulty met­ric for campaign donations, especially the donations of students, who are likely to have limited financial resources and thus con­tribute less than $200. Smaller donations are not uncommon and can have a significant impact on presidential campaigns. The claim that only 15 Notre Dame students and professors donated to presidential campaigns is inaccurate and may significantly underestimate the campus' involvement in the presidential race.

Reconsider 1Suck it' cheer 
I've been going to Notre Dame basketball games since I was seven years old and have been a season ticket holder almost since I grad­uated. There's nothing I like more than seeing a raucous crowd at the Joyce Center and there's no doubt in my mind that the crowd­especially the students-helped Notre Dame to their big win over Marquette on Saturday that kept the big home win streak alive. 
That said, I saw on Saturday what seems to be a recent tradition in the student body. I've seen it at a couple football games as well (including the Navy game this past fall) and it's one I wish they'd reconsider. I refer to the addi­tion of the "Suck it, [opponent]:' phrase to the "Go Irish Go" cheer. Besides being unoriginal and not very clever, it's the kind of crassness we usually expect to see from some of our opponents' student bodies. "!@#$the Irish" is a routine chant leveled at us at road games and I've never met a Notre Dame fan yet who finds that in any way interesting or believes it reflects well on those students. 
This relatively new cheer puts us on that slip­pery slope. I was embarrassed for the man sit­ting behind me at the game who had brought his four-year-old son to the game and had to listen to that. It's not a question of being "tough" or trying to sound intimidating, and it's also not a question of this being something "young people do." It's a question of acting like the men and women Notre Dame students are supposed to be. It's possible to create an intimi­dating environment to support the team through your noise without resorting to the crass, juvenile behavior that is supposed to be beneath us. 
Folks, let's reconsider this one. Notre Dame students are among the best out there. There's got to be something more clever you can come up with.

Under the boardwalk 

There is a group of ex-convict sex offenders living under an overpass in Miami that feels they are being unfairly treated (I know, right?) because, well, they're homeless. And they're talking to the press about it. The two men -Alejandro Ruiz and Kevin Morales ­that were quoted in the article "Nowhere to go, Miami sex offenders live under bridge" on Reuters both swear they aren't monsters. They have graffitied this battle cry on the con­crete columns surrounding the camp (announcing their whereabouts effectively). 
The ex-cons lament the fact that no one wants to be around them (surprise?), and are disheartened that people "treat [them] like shit." If they had been allowed a house or apartment and been made to put a sign in their Michele King yard, would they have protested? Why should I feel bad for them? They are only victims of their depravity. One of these two men was University of convicted of lewd and lascivious conduct with a 15-year-old relative Northern and the other, a 6 7 -year-old man, was convicted of the same thing Alabama with a minor (but not a relative ... whew). Flor-Ala 
On average, there are 13 men living in this camp in tents, under tarps, in an atmosphere the writer sympathetically describes as "dismal" and that "reeks of human waste and garbage". The really hilarious part of all of this is that they are being told to live here by parole officers because it's one of the few places that fit the require­ment in Dade County of being far enough away from schools and playgrounds, but at the same time are being told by other officials to clear off, though it's technically not illegal to camp under overpasses. They have a curfew, which is enforced nearly every day, and some even have "Under the Julia Tuttle Causeway" listed as their official residence on their driver's license. 
I imagine it's pretty difficult to get a job when you live under an overpass, so who's feed­ing these guys and the 37 other homeless predators across the state? Also, just because they can't officially live close to places where there may be children doesn't mean they can't visit these places to get their rocks off. And, from what I hear, sex offenders are gen­erally the first to be made into the cell-block bitch, so what exactly did they expect upon release? To be welcomed back into society, into their family's homes, with wide-open arms and smiles and sunshine? It's not quite fair, I suppose, to expect them to assimilate into normal society when they can't even get an apartment. But do sexual deviants ever really fit into and become productive members of society? Or do they eventually all turn into Jeffrey Dahmer? Ifso, at least now they have nowhere to lure people. Then again, 15 to 30 convicted sex offenders hanging out together may not be a great idea.

Associated Press 
ASHBURN,Va. Always the energetic left­bander, Jim Zorn had an upbeat but nervous start to his coming-out event with the Washington Redskins. 
The new coach got the team colors wrong. He paid tribute to an assis­tant the team recently fired. He lacked the pol­ish of his predecessor, Joe Gibbs, who sat watching from the second row dur­ing the news conference Sunday in the Redskins Park auditorium. 
Not too surprising, real­ly, given that Zorn himself said it was nothing short of "miraculous" that he was standing where he was: a few feet behind the team's three Super Bowl trophies, essentially mak­ing the jump from quar­terbacks coach to head coach because none of the candidates on owner Dan Snyder's initial list worked out. The 54-year­old Zorn was taking the first step in finding out what it really means to take a such a big job in a Redskins-crazy town. 

"I look at these three trophies," Zorn said, "and it's quite intimidating." 
Zorn signed a five-year contract Saturday, ending a monthlong coaching search in which he was originally supposed to be an interesting sidebar. The Redskins hired him as an offensive coordina­tor two weeks ago, luring him away from the Seattle Seahawks, then decided late last week to interview him for the head coaching job after New York Giants defen­sive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo withdrew from consideration. 
Snyder also interviewed Jim Mora, Jim Passel, Steve Mariucci, Ron Meeks, Pete Carroll, Jim Schwartz, Redskins assis­tant Gregg Williams and others. Some had pulled out of the running, and, rather than choose from

IN BRIEF British athletes sigl! contract 
to not make politica:I remarks 
LONDON -British Olympic athletes must sign a new clause in their con­tracts prohibiting politically sensitive remarks or gestures during the Beijing Games. 
"The reality is, given the level of political scrutiny of the world's media on these games and the way China will handle them, the BOA felt it was sensible and proper to flag that rule to our athletes," British Olympic Association communications director Graham Mewson said Sunday. 
The International Olympic Committee already has a rule that states that "no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propa­ganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas." 
In January, Belgian athletes were told they would be prohibited from raising human rights or other politi­cal issues at Olympic venues. 

Swede breaks 60-meter hur­
dles indoor record 
KARLSRUHE,Germany -Susanna Kallur broke the 18-year-old world record in the women's 60-meter indoor hurdles Sunday, finishing in 
7.68 seconds to lower the mark by 
0.01 seconds at the Karlsruhe International. 
The 26-year old Swede broke the record set Feb. 4, 1990, by Russia's Ludmila Narozhilenko -who later changed her name to Ludmila Engquist. Kallur, the European out­doors champion just missed the mark with a 7.72 effort a week ago in Stuttgart. 
"The record is unbelievable. I'm speechless," Kallur said. "I don't know how I will celebrate. I don't know how much money I will earn for the record either." 
She established herself as the favorite for the indoor world cham­pionship, set for March 7-9 in Valencia, Spain. 
the rest, Snyder decided to give Zorn a shot because the owner said he had been impressed during Zorn's interview for the offensive coordi­nator position. 
Zorn, called away from Redskins Park to Snyder's house for lunch on Thursday, said he gasped when the owner asked him if he was interested in the head coaching job. 
"I was a bit taken back, if you will," Zorn said. "I wasn't speechless, because my first words were: 'Certainly, I'd like to do that.' It was a bit shocking. After that I got my game face on and tried to get after it."

PEBBLE BEACH -Steve Lowery had gone more than seven years and 199 tournaments without win­ning, a drought that would have continued Sunday at Pebble Beach if not for a stunning collapse by Vijay Singh. 
Three shots behind when he stood on the 15th tee, Lowery made up quick ground when Singh made three straight bogeys, then won on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff with a 7-foot birdie. At 4 7, he became the oldest winner in the 71-year history of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
Lowery closed with a 4-under 68 and won for the third time in his career, all of them in playoffs. 
Singh recovered from his three bogeys with a wedge that stopped 2 feet away for birdie on the final hole for a 71 to force the playoff. Both players finished at 10-under 278. 
NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL -BIG EAST 
Louisville tops G'Town, shakes up standings 
Villanova, St. John's get much-needed wins in thrilling contests 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. Louisville coach Hick Pitino started sweating through his <ill-white suit while paeing the sidelines during the l'irst half against No. 6 Georgetown on Saturday. lie dncidnd at the half it was time to get back to basics. 
So, apparently, did his team. 
Clad in a morn traditional black suit in the sncond half, Pitino watched the Cardinals return to the fundamentals that have k!~yed their rise through the Big East. Louisville shut down the lloyas over the final 20 minutes for a convincing 59-51 victory to shake up a con­forenee race that for weeks 
appeared to be "This is the best win with 37 seconds a foregone con­I've ever experienced to go. But after 
clusion. a loose ball was
as a player. '' 
David Padgett touched by sev­scored 18 eral players, points, Jerry David Padgett Reynolds 
Smith added 16 Louisville forward passed to 
corner to give Villanova a much-needed victory over Seton Hall on Saturday. 
Dantfl Cunningham tied his carfler high with 21 points, and Anderson and Scottie Reynolds had 13 each for Villanova ( 14-8, 4-6 Big East), which snapped a five-game losing streak, it's longest since th11 2003-04 season. 
Jamar Nutter had 18 points and Brian Laing had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Pirates (15-9, 5-6), who lost at Villanova for the 1Oth straight timfl. 
In a second half that saw 10 lead changes and neither team gaining mor11 than a four-point IPad. the Wildcats moved ahead 68-66 with 3:48 to play. Laing's two free throws tied the score 68-68. before Cunningham made one of two foul shots. 
A tough driving layup by 
Eugene Harvey 
gave the Pirates 
a 70-69 edge 
and the 
Cardinals ( 18-6,

held Georgetown (19-3, 9-2) to 
20 points in the second half, 
snapping the lloyas' six-game 
winning streak by playing the 
kind of clampdown defense 
that has become Georgetown's 
trademark. 
"This is the best win I've ever experienced as a player," Padgett said. "It all starts with defense. We started the game, I think we might have been a little nervous. In the second half we played defense the way we're all capable of." 
The Cardinals held the lloyas to just 35 percent shoot­ing in the second half, keeping Georgetown without a field goal for a decisive eight­minute stretch in which Louisville took command. 
Austin Freeman and Roy Hibbert led the lloyas with 14 points apiece, but Georgetown fell apart during an uncharac­teristically sloppy second half. 
Louisville harried Georgetown with its press, forcing the normally deliber­ate Jloyas into 15 turnovers. When the lloyas did manage to gnt into their offensive sets, they rushed shots and hardly played with the eflieiency that has carri1~d them all season. 
"I think (Louisville) just exe­cuted extremely well," said Georgetown coach John Thompson Ill. "It's the simple things. It's a simple game. They exflcutPd and we didn't." 
The lloyas appeared to be in total control at the half, bully­ing th11ir way to an eight-point lead that grew to 33-23 moments into the second on a hook shot by Hibbert. 
Louisville, which had stum­bled through an erratic l'irst half in which it had more turnovers (10) than field goals (sPven), sudd11nly righted its11lf as Pitino urged th11m not to panie.

Junior Dwayne Anderson, making his l'irst earner start, hit a 3-point shot from the left 
Anderson for 
the game-win­
ning shot. 
Villanova jumped out to a 29-20 lead when Corey Fisher hit a 3-point shot with 9:55 left in the first half. Larry Davis then made a 3-point play, sparking a 14-2 run and the Pirates moved ahead 34-31. 
Villanova responded with 12 unanswered points while the Pirates missed eight consecu­tive shots to take a 43-34 lead. Seton Hall scored the final seven points of the half to close within 43-41 at the break. 
St. John's 64, Providence 62 
Larry Wright scored 16 points, including two free throws in the final 19 seconds, and St. John's beat Providence on Saturday, the Red Storm's third straight win after a six­game losing streak. 
Weyinmi Efejuku had a chance to tie the game for Providence with one tenth of a second left, but missed the first of two free throws and then bounced the second off the rim intentionally. 
It was the second time this season Efejuku, a 70 percent free throw shooter, couldn't bring the Friars into a tie with free throws with less than a second to play. He made one of two from the line with two­tenths left in Providence's 68­67 loss to South Carolina on Dec. 8. 
Sean Evans had 12 points and nine rebounds for the Red Storm {10-12, 4-7 Big East), who won again without lead­ing scorer Anthony Mason Jr. 
(13.5 points). He injured his ankle in the win over South Florida and also missed the victory at Rutgers on Wednesday. 
St. John's took the lead for good at 59-57 on a layup by Justin Burrell with 2:09 left.

Orange top Eagles, 70-67 
McCoughtry's 41 points lead 'Ville over DePaul; UConn blasts SHU 
Associated Press 

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -Eight days after its first-ever loss as a ranked team, Syracuse desperately needed a victory to keep its magical season intact, and Erica Morrow delivered. 
The freshman guard scored a season-high 24 points, Fantasia Goodwin had nine points and 14 rebounds and the 23rd-ranked Orange held off Marquette 70-67 on Sunday. 
"Coming off of a loss, you always want to come back," said Morrow, who also had four assists and two steals. "We lost to the last-place team (at the time) in the con­ference, so I'm sure we had our doubters. 
Just to come back at home and show everyone we're still one of the top teams in the country, that was a sign for all of us to play harder and get the win." 
Syracuse (18-4, 6-3 Big East), coming off a loss at Georgetown, overcame a sloppy start and held off a late challenge by Marquette (13-10, 5-5) to go to 10-1 at home. The victory kept the Orange tied for fifth in the conference with No. 16 Notre Dame, which handed No. 15 Pitt only its second confer­ence loss of the season on Sunday. 
The Orange, in the rankings for the first time in the pro­gram's 37-year history, are seeking just their fourth NCAA tournament berth. 

Louisville 79, DePaul 68 
Angel McCoughtry had 41 points and nine rebounds, leading Louisville to a victory over No. 25 DePaul on Sunday. 
Candyce Bingham had 16 points for Louisville (16-7, 5-5 Big East). 
It was a back and forth game for DePaul (16-7, 5-5) and Louisville with the lead changing three times and a tie score seven times. 
Louisville led by as many as 11 points in the second half after leading 38-34 at the break. DePaul led by as many as eight points in the first half. 
Connecticut 82, Seton Hall 36 

After a rare loss, top-ranked Connecticut showed why its still one of the best teams in the country. 
Maya Moore had 28 points and 14 rebounds, and the Huskies routed Seton Hall to bounce back from their first loss of the season. 
Moore, coming off her sev­enth Big East Freshman of the Week award, moved into fifth place on the all-time freshman scoring list with 399 points, passing Nykesha Sales.

ND drops two in ITA N at'l Indoors 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Aftnr dropping its first-round match of the ITA Women's National Indoor Team Championships Thursday against No. 6 Georgia, No. 19 Notrll Dame wanted to make the most of its remaining time at the tournament in Madison, Wise. 
The Irish ended up splitting thcir weekend matches. 
Notre Dame 4, William and Mary3 
In a tight contest with No. 13 William and Mary Friday, Notre Dame held a 3-1 advantage bnfore the Tribe battled back to even the dual match at 3-3. It all came down to junior Kelcy Tefft, who needed three sets to dis­pose of Tribe sophomore Hagini Aeharya 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 and give Notrn Dame the victory. 
William and Mary took the doubles point by winning two of the three matches and defeating the No. 3 doubles tandem in the nation, senior Brook Buck and Telll. The Tribe also topped the tag team of sophomore Cosmina Ciobanu and freshman Kristen Rafanl. 
After falling in the doubles portion of the match, the Irish quickly won the first three sin­gles matches to build their lead. 
No. 89 sophomore Kali Krisik convincingly ousted sophomore Carmen Pop in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 to even the match and improve her overall record to 14-3 and 5-1 in dual match play on the season. 

Keeping the Irish momentum rolling, No, 88 sophomore Colleen Rielley won a three-set victory 6-2, 2-6, 6-1. Hielley shook off her loss from the pre­vious day against Georgia to improve her record to 9-5 over­all and 3-2 in dual match action. 
Buck, who also lost a three-set match against the Bulldogs, came away with a three-set vic­tory of her own. After dropping the first set, Buck fought back and took down junior Katarina Zoricic 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. 
The Tribe sensed the match slipping away and fought back to take two straight singles wins, thanks to senior Megan Moulton-Levy and sophomore Lauren Sabacinski. With the match now in a deadlock, Tefft made sure the Irish would not drop back-to-hack matches in consecutive days. 
Baylor 5, Notre Dame 1 

After pulling out the victory against William and Mary in dramatic fashion, Notre Dame concluded its tournament play against No. 11 Baylor Saturday. 
The Baylor Bears nearly upset top-seeded Stanford in the first round, and continued to play consistent and solid tennis Saturday, defeating the Irish 5­1. 
Notre Dame dropped the first match of doubles play, but then came out on top for the second as sophomore teammates Ciobanu and Hielley defeated 
file photo Irish junior Kelcy Tefft stretches for a return in Notre Dame's 5-2 win over North Carolina on Feb. 16, 2007. 
freshman pair Taylor Ormond and Jelena Stanivuk 9-8, 7-3. 
The Bears secured the point in the third doubles match to put the store at 1-0 in their favor. The final match paired two of the top doubles teams in the nation as Tefft and Buck lost to No. 4 sophomore Lenka Broosova and senior Zuzana Zemenova. 
The Irish dropped their first chance at a singles point after Zcmenova defeated Buck in straight sets 6-0, 6-2. 
With the score at 2-0, Notre Dame needed to produce some victories to stay in the match. Unfortunately for the Irish, they picked up just one point on the day, sealing the Baylor victory. 
Tefft, playing in her third­straight three-set match of the tournament, overcame an 
Ormond onslaught in the second set and eventually defeated the sophomore in the deciding frame 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. 
Baylor ran the rest of the table and secured its third victory of the season. 
Although the Irish did not fin­ish as they had intended, one of their upperclassmen took home some hardware recognizing her athletic skill and sportsmanship. Brook Buck claimed the ITA Sportsmanship Award, which is chosen by the 16 participating coaches of the tournament. 
Buck is the third Irish player to receive the recognition, join­ing 1999 winner Jennifer Hall and 1994 winner Wendy Crabtree.

Kessler sets mark, Belles fall 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Sports Writer 
Senior guard Alison Kessler set the school record for 3-pointers in a career, but Saint Mary's fell to Albion 78-70 Saturday at the Angela Athletic Center in the two teams' second meeting this sea­son. 
The loss was the second straight at home for the Belles. 
Saint Mary's (9-12, 5-8 MIAA) dropped to No. 7 in the MIAA while Albion (17-4, 10-3 MIAA) 17-4 overall) stays in second. 
The Belles started quickly. After two free throws from for­ward Erin Newson put the first points on the board for either team, junior Megan Conanty made a steal and coast-to-coast layup to give Saint Mary's a 4-0 lead. 
Saint Mary's didn't keep Albion scoreless for long. The Britons first got on the board at 3:09, managing to score 19 points in the next seven minutes. With seven minutes to go in the half, Saint Mary's found itself down 25-20. 
Freshman Liz Wade started the Belles' comeback with a layup with 6:50 to go, which was quickly followed by a 3-pointer and jump shot by Alison Kessler, bringing the game to a tie at 27 with 4:55 left in the half. A jump shot from Erin Newsom and another 3-pointer from Kessler gave the Belles back the lead. 
However, they weren't able to hold it for long, trailing 39-35 at the half. 
The Belles have started the second half strong in recent games, but this was not the case on Saturday. Saint Mary's did not score until almost four minutes into second half when Newsom made another two free throws while Albion went on a nonstop scoring run, never giving back the lead. 
The Belles weren't able to keep up with the Britons on rebounds, an area Saint Mary's has been continuously working to improve. They were outre­bounded 35-28, as well as out-shot, going 44.2 percent from the floor to Albion's 49.2 percent. 
Saturday's game wasn't a com­plete loss for Kessler, who set the new record for most 3-point shots during a career with 133, three more than Bridget Boy'ce's 130 from 2002-06. 
This season, Kessler also set the school records for most points scored in a game (41) and most free throws in a season (128 so far this year). Previously, she has set the record for most free throws in a game with 15. Kessler also scored the game high for both teams with 28 points, bringing her season point total to 415. 
The Belles take a week off from games, going up against conference foe Kalamazoo on Feb. 16 at home. Last-place Kalamazoo will hopefully give Saint Mary's the win it needs to get back on track before the MIAA tournament at the end of the month.

junior Santiago Montoya and freshman Tyler Davis over sopho­mores Marek Michalicka and Michael Muskievicz. 
"Montoya has become more sta­ble on his returns and has always been good at net," Bayliss said. "He is playing with freshman Tyler Davis who competes like a lion." 
Senior Sheeva Parbhu and jun­ior Brett Helgeson pulled off the other doubles win over senior Nolan Polley and sophomore Moritz Baumann 9-7. 
The Irish dropped the No. 2 doubles match when senior Andrew Roth and freshman Stephen Havens lost 8-6 to senior Jeremy Sonkin and sophomore Luke Rassow-Kantor. Sonkin and Rassow-Kontor are ranked No. 26 in the nation. 
In singles action, the Irish had quite a battle against the Badgers. 
At No. 4 singles, freshman Stephen Havens dropped his match to Michalicka 6-2, 6-4 to knot the match at 1-1. 
"Havens has great timing," Bayliss said. "He also has great shot making ability, but he needs to play with more discipline." 
The Irish pulled into the lead again when freshman Daniel Stahl pulled out a 7-6, 6-3 win at No. 6 singles against Rassow-Kantor. 
The Badgers tied the match at two when Sonkin defeated Roth 3­6, 6-2, 6-4 at the No. 3 singles position. 
National No. 11 Helgeson faced No. 39 Baumann again at No. 1 singles. Baumann won the first set 6-3 and was up 4-2 in the second when Helgeson made his come­back. Helgeson took two of the next five games to pull out the set. The third set was back and forth until Helgeson tied the set at 3-3 and bounced back to win it 6-3. 
Irish freshman David Anderson fell in a tight match to Badgers sophomore Michael Dieberger 5­7,7-5,6-2. 
With the match tied 3-3 overall, the deciding match was in the hands of Parbhu against Polley at No. 2 singles. Parbhu came from behind again to earn the hard fought win. 
Parbhu got a slight lead after breaking Polley's serve at 3-3. However Polley broke right back to tie the score at 4-4. 
Both players held their serve the last four games to push the final match to a tiebreaker. Parbhu came out on top as did the Irish with the final score being 6-7 (1­7), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). The win improved Parbhu's record for the year to 16-6. 
Next weekend, the Irish travel to Seattle for the National Team Indoors.

FENCING 
Montoya, Irish roll to svveep in ND Duals 
Junior epeeist goes undefeated for weekend 
By KEN FOWLER 
SportS Writer 
The Irish threw on the cruise control and coasted to an easy sweep in the Notre Dame Duals this weekend. 
Junior epeeist Kim Montoya led the Irish effort with an unbeaten performance. Montoya finished 27-0 and earned her 150th career win after her opponent withdrew before her final bout. Montoya, though, wasn't focusing on her 150h victory. 
''I'm just happy that I went undefeated," she said. 
Montoya's wins came in the Joyce Center against fencers from Indiana, Michigan, Michigan State and Florida, among others. The junior fin­ished 26-0, including a win over 2007 NCAA finalist Justyna Konczalska, of Wayne State. 
"That was the biggest achievement of Montoya ­that she beat someone of a bigger name and show that name doesn't matter," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. "And it builds confidence for the others." 
Montoya, sophomore walk­on Vanessa Rosa and senior walk-on Nikki Lubold were Notre Dame's only women epeeists for the event because sophomore Kelley Hurley and freshman Ewa Nelip competed in Europe. 
That meant the trio had no substitutes for its nine dual matches. For Lubold, who saw her first NCAA action, and the limited-in-experience Hosa, endurance was the big issue. 
They held up just fine. 
Besides Montoya's perfect afternoon, Lubold went 14-13 in bouts against varsity teams, and Rosa went 13-14. 
"It was a pleasure to see them bouting," Bednarski said. 
The Irish women and men each beat all nine of their opponents, with the women's foil squad leading the charge. 
Senior Rachel Cota, junior Adi Nott, junior Emilie Prot and freshman Hayley Reese combined for a 78-3 bout record. 
On the men's side, senior foilist Jakub Jedrkowiak went 8-0 and in the process earned career victory No. 150. Meanwhile, freshman epeeist Chris Pfarr went 15-1 and epee classmate Andy Seroff finished 15-2. 
"We expected to do this, but the expectations aren't alwayshold on what the results are," Bednarski said. 
The event was Notre Dame's final true regular season event. Members of the squad will travel to Charlotte, N.C., next weekend for the Junior Olympics. After that, the Irish host the Midwest Fencing Conference Championships from Feb. 23­24. 
Bednarski likes the trajec­tory his team is on. 
"I think it was a good meet for 'them preparing for the Midwest Championships and the end of the season," Bednarski said.

Pitt 
continued from page 24 
earlier this season. Irish coach Muffet McGraw, who has been critical of her team's ability to defend shots, was pleased with the way the Irish defense has improved. 
"I was finally happy with our defense," she said. "The zone was tremendous. Overall, I was really pleased with the way we played defensively. A lot of pressure, we got aggressive with it." 
Playing off the boards was the only area of Notre Dame's defense that looked a little rough around the edges -the Panthers pulled down 30 offen­sive rebounds to Notre Dame's 
10. Pittsburgh out-rebounded the Irish 56-42 overall. 
"If we could have just rebounded that would have been the best defensive game we played all year," McGraw said. "But overall I was really, really pleased." 
Almost 14 minutes into the second half, there was a scary moment for the Irish when Peters went down with an apparent knee injury. The 6­foot-2 freshman grabbed an offensive rebound and then fell to the ground, clutching her left leg. Peters returned to the bench two minutes later on crutches with a leg brace and is set for an MRI today to deter­mine the severity of the injury. 
Instead of folding after she went down, however, the Irish rallied and a well-balanced offense continued to shine, despite the loss of Peters. 
The Irish left the court with the 29-25 lead at halftime due to the fact that all nine players who saw the court also put points up on the board. Guard Charel Allen, who averages 
14.2 points per game, went only 3-for-10 from the field in the game. Guard Ashley Barlow, who averages 12.9 points per game could only manage six against the Panthers. But where those two fell short against Pittsburgh, the rest of the Irish offense picked up. 
"[It's great] to know that we can win a game with Ashley and Charel not having a great game," McGraw said. "We have different people stepping up off the bench, that's the kind of production we need coming off the bench and they've been doing it all year long." 


Sophomore guard Melissa Lechlitner agreed. 
"That's what's so great about this team is we're so balanced," she said. "Any given night any­one can score." 
Lechlitner came in for the Irish off the bench and had what McGraw called a "career game." The sophomore went 5­for-7 from the field and 2-for-2 at the line, totaling 12 points. 
The win over Pittsburgh also gave freshman Becca Bruszewski the opportunity to increase her minutes. With Peters out due to injury, Bruszewski had the chance to play the post, and she didn't disappoint. 
"I think my teammates found me more," Bruszewski said. "I was screening and rolling and the guards saw me cutting in the lane and I got easy layups." 
Bruszewski, who scored 10 points for the Irish, was one of five Notre Dame players to post double figures. Joining Bruszewski were guard Lindsey Schrader (12), Lechlitner (12). Gaines (13) and Peters (11). 
Pittsburgh center Marcedes 
Walker led the Panthers with 18 points and 14 rebounds. The senior, who missed last Wednesday's 64-44 victory over Seton Hall due to ankle injury, did not seem in any pain. 
"[My ankle] didn't really limit me," Walker said. "I didn't think about it out there, I knew that coming back it was going to be a struggle, but I just want­ed to play my game and really help my teammates out." 
Walker's efforts weren't enough to combat Notre Dame's balanced offense and solid defense. The Irish realized it is their defense that will help them win games over ranked opponents like Pittsburgh. 
"That's what's gonna win us games, is defense," Schrader said. "We know we can score, if we've got the defense, we're gonna make it far, I think." 
Note: 
+McGraw will donate $420 to breast cancer research because of her team's 42 rebounds against the Panthers as part of Notre Dame's "Think Pink" campaign. The money will be evenly split between the Kay Yow/Women's Basketball Coaches Association Cancer Fund and the Susan G. Komen For The Cure foundation.

case. Weis announced Jan. 31 that he had hired former Georgia Tech defensive coordi­nator Jon Tenuta to be the assistant head coach/defense after Bill Lewis -who held that position the last three seasons -retired due to a hip surgery. Weis said on Friday that Tenuta will be an "idea guy" for defen­sive coordinator Corwin Brown to lean on. 
"With Jon, obviously we get an experienced coach that Corwin can lean on as an idea guy that can really help as our defense evolves and can really help our defense," Weis said. 
Starting this spring, Tenuta will coach the linebackers and Brown will coach the secondary. 
Brian Polian, who had coached special teams and out­side linebackers last season, will become solely the special teams coach -a move Weis said came after the disappoint­ing Irish kicking game last sea­son. 
In 2007, the Irish lacked a true special teams coach. Instead, the unit was coached on a committee-basis. 
"Brian will be the special teams coach, it'll be his deal, 

but I'll be his assistant," Weis said. "And I think when the head coach makes himself an assistant to an assistant coach, I think it might create a little sense of urgency with us on special teams." 
Weis, who announced last fall that he would meet with his for­mer colleagues of the New England Patriots to fix some of last season's problems, also plans to meet with Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer to talk about how to improve Notre Dame's special teams. 
Notes: 
+Notre Dame will be without two players this spring -tight end Will Yeatman and nose tackle Pat Kuntz. The South Bend Tribune reported on Jan. 28 that Yeatman was pulled over last week for DWI on Holy Cross Drive by NDSP and was suspended indefinitely by both the lacrosse and football teams. 
Kuntz left the University at the beginning of the semester, but plans to return by the fall. 
Federal privacy laws limited what Weis could say about the two players. The coach said he was "hopeful" that both players would be back by the fall. 
+Two Irish players' careers were ended by injuries this win­ter. 
Defensive end Darrell Hand and offensive tackle Bartley Webb were declared medically unable to compete and are no longer on the football roster. Both will keep their scholar­ships, but they will not count against the football team's total number. 
As part of the medical schol­arship, both players will have to find a campus job. Weis said Webb -who one day wishes to be a football coach -will work closely with the team. 
+The American Football Coaches' Association, led by new president and former Irish coach Tyrone Willingham, decided during its convention last month that head coaches will no longer be able to travel on recruiting visits during the spring. Weis said Notre Dame will have a second junior day on campus in late March as a result. The Irish had already plannedfor a junior day on Feb. 24. 
Weis said he plans to spend the added time with Notre Dame's current players and his family. He also plans to visit this year's 11 award-winning Notre Dame Alumni Clubs across the country.

their frne throws during that span as they held on for the victory -their 34th straight at home. 
"This is a team win for us," Irish point guard Tory Jackson said. "There were no individual slats that really stood out. It was a lot of things we did as a team; free throws were big for us today." 
Notre Dame led S0-70 with 
3:22 remaining in the game but Marquette put together a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to another turnover but did not take advantage of it as guard Wesley Matthews threw an errant pass. 
Harangody eventually came up with the ball and was fouled. The sophomore made two free throws to again put the lead at three. 
James made two more easy layups but the Irish got pairs of free throws from llarangody and guard Jonathan Peoples to main­tain the team's three-point lead with 8.1 seconds to play. "We can absorb [two-point baskets! at that point in the game because I feel we're gonna come back and make free throws, which we did," Brey

defense 
clamped down and forced James to throw up a desperation 3­point attempt. The shot did not even hit the rim after Jackson and junior forward Ryan Ayers harassed James, who could not turn his game­high 23 points into 26 and force overtime. 
"Tory did a good job of picking him up so the clock started and zigzagging him a little bit, so they're really only gonna get one shot," Brny said. "Ryan, at his size, came out ... and that was a very difficult shot to shoot over a 6-8 guy with length." 
Four starters and reserve forward Luke Zeller each posted double-digit scoring totals for the Irish. 
Zollnr came off the bench to hit two 3-pointers and one monstrous dunk on his way to a season-high 11 points. 
With 2:58 to play in the first half, Zeller received a pass from McAlarney just in front of the 3-point line and drove hard to the basket before finishing with a left­handed slam that ignited the crowd. 
"We're seeing with Luke Zeller, the light bulb is on," Brey said. "It's great; it's awesome to see." 
Zeller's dunk gave the Irish a 37-34 lead and highlighted a 13-2 Irish run to end the half. Harangody converted a dunk of his own just before the halftime buzzer, and the home squad took a 46-36 lead into the locker room. 
Harangody led the Irish with 18 points and 11 rebounds but said Marquette did a "hell of a job" on him defensively. He was held to 4-of-12 shooting from the field. 
"I think they did a good job on him," Brey said. "But the man still had a double-dou­ble." 
McAlarney had 12 points on 5-of-11 shooting and drilled two 3-pointers from the same spot early in the second half. He made the treys in a 30-second span to help the Irish open up a 54­42 lead. Jackson finished with 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds. 
Note: 
+Irish senior forward Hob Kurz had a stomach virus and didn't practice Friday. Against Marquette, Kurz fin­ished with five points and live rebounds in 24 minutes. Brey said Harangody and forward Zach Hillesland were also sick during Saturday's contest.

still hung on to win their fifth straight game and their 34th straight at the Joyce Center. 
How? The lost art of free throw shooting. 

For years, fans have moaned and groaned about poor free­throw shooting in big time bas­ketball. It's never on the high­light reels. Young players spend too much time working on their tomahawk jams and not enough time on the fundamentals. 
Apparently that's not true of the Irish (unless you count for­ward Luke Zeller, who's clearly been working on his tomahawk jams judging by Saturday's thunderous throw-down in the first half.) 
Against the Golden Eagles, Notre Dame buried 77 percent of its free-throw attempts-24 in 31 attempts. During its crunch-time field-goal-less stretch, Notre Dame wnnt 10­for-10 from the line. 
One possession after the last Irish field goal (a spinning lay­up by point guard Tory Jackson), guard Jonathan Peoples began the free throw parade, stepping to the line and calmly draining two -one with a little help from the back­board. 
The free throws didn't seem crucial at the time, but they were the first Peoples had attempted since the win over Cincinnati Jan. 15, and they gave him needed confidence for later in the game. 
Peoples' free throws put Notre Dame up 78-67-but Marquette was about to make a run. 
With less than a minute remaining, the Irish found themselves up by just one at 82­
81. Notre Dame had to inbouod. and the Golden Eagles had to foul. With free throw sharp­shooters Kyle McAlarney and 
Luke 1-Iarangody tightly guard­
ed, Peoples took the throw in. 
The crowd held its breath as the inexperienced reserve headed to the line. 
Peoples calmly swished both. 
After a layup by Marquette guard Dominic James cut the lead to one again with eight seconds left, it was time for a more likely Irish hero -Harangody -to head to the line. 
Notre Dame's Big East player of the year candidate had already hit eight free throws on the day-including four during the field-goal-less streak-but what really gave the Joyce Center crowd confidence was that this was not the first time Harangody had been at the line in a pressure situation. 
Just a little over a week ago, on Jan. 31, the sophomore for­ward had stepped to the line with his team down two and just seconds remaining against Providence. Harangody hit both then and he hit both against Marquette to provide the final margin. 
Obviously, Notre Dame's field­goal drought is disturbing. The Irish were running a good team out of the gym for 34 minutes, and then they suddenly stopped being aggressive and couldn't hit shots. This kind of passivity has already cost them games against Baylor and Georgia Tech this year, and if they're not careful it will cause them to drop games again. 
But with dead-eye free-throw shooting like they had Saturday, the Irish have the ability to close teams out late in tight games. 
They just have to make sure they finish on· the games that shouldn't be close as well.

Eric Condra brought the Irish back within one after his pass from behind the net bounced off a Ferris State player and in. 
Notre Dame would be unable to tie the score, though, and Justin Lewandowski sealed it for the Bulldogs whnn he scored with just undH two minutes loft. 
"We started playing wnll in the third, but it was too late," Deeth said. "We've got to stop kicking ourselves in the butt and waiting until the third period to play." 
Deoth received a ten-minute misconduct at the end of the gamo for unsportsmanliko eon­duct toward a referee and .Jackson benched him for Saturday night's game as pun­ishment. 
"That's the most ridiculous call I've ever had against me," Deeth said. "But you've got to tak1~ them as thoy come." 
Notre Dame 2, Ferris State 2 
Notre Dame once again scornd early on a power play Saturday night. Irish defense­man Ian Cole moved up from his position at the point to the right eircle and slammed a cross-iee pass from Mark Van Guilder into the net before O'Koefe could get across. 
"I took a peek before the pass came and it was open. I got pretty excited." Cole said. 

"All I had to do was shoot in the open net." 
With two goals, the power play appeared to be one bright spot from an otherwise disap­pointing weekend. Jackson said the unit looks to have recovered from a 0-!'or-38 slump that lasted from early December to late January. 
"Obviously if you get one power play goal a night it'll help you," Jackson said. ''I'm just glad that we're getting some success on the power play." 
The Irish looked to add to their power play scoring when they had a 5-on-3 advantage halfway through the first peri­od. But after Bulldog defense­man Zach Redmond intercept­ed a pass, he skated the length of the ice and fired a low wris­ter over Pearce's stick and in. Jackson called the shorthand­Hd goal given up "the most dis­appointing thing of the night." 
Both teams scored in the sec­ond period, making the game 2-2 heading into the third, but both failed to convert on any chances during the final period and overtime. 
The Irish struggled in both games with Ferris State's trap­ping defense. 
"It's really difficult to get pucks to the net," Jackson said. ''I'm not a big fan of that sys­tem. You might as well have live goaltenders out there." 
Despite the poor results, the team is still confident about it's postseason chances. 
"I wouldn't say there's any frustration," Cole said. "There's no panic. We're a pretty com-plete team." 

Notre Dame has a long week ahead, leaving for two games at Alaska next weekend. The Irish must get back on traek if they hope to secure a first round bye in the CCHA playoffs. Nebraska­Omaha is only four points behind them, though Notre Dame has two games at hand. 
"We have seven games lef't and we need to pull together," junior Christian Hanson said. "We keep on saying 'It's going to come, it's going to come', but we need to stop talking and just go out and do it."

Weis to give up playcalling duties to coordinator Hayvvood 
Tenuta will coach linebackers, Brown moves to secondary; Polian becomes full-time special tearns coach 
By JAY FITZPATRICK A'socia1e Sports Edimr 
For the first time since he came to Notre Dame in 2005, Charlie Weis will not be calling the o!l'!msive plays. 
Weis announced Friday that he will relinquish offensive play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Mike Haywood in 2008 -a decision the head coach said was very difficult to make. 
''I'm going to try to cut the proverbial -the figurative ­umbilical cord and try to move myself a little bit away from being the sole primary guy on the offensive staff," he said. "That means Mike will write the scripts and set it up on offense, and that means that all the offensive coaches now won't have to worry about the ever presence of the head coach breathing down their neck all the time." 

Weis said even though he will not be calling every play, he reserves the right to "interject" his opinion when he sees fit. But Weis said he knew he had to take a step back on offense in order to help his coaches fulfill their potential. 
"I think that sometimes when you have a number of good coaches, sometimes they get stymied or stil'led a little bit when you have a very domi­neering presence when the head coach is also involved in the offense," Weis said. 
Even though he will step back from offensive play-calling, Weis said he will continue coaching the No. 1 quarterback next season. 
"I always feel that my greatest strength as a football coach is developing quarterbacks, so I think that for Jimmy ]Clausen] and Evan ]Sharpley] and now the new guy [freshman Dayne Crist], for all those guys, l think that that's part of what I do." 
Weis added that every offen­sive coach maintains the same position he held last season, just with added responsibilities. 
Defensively, that is not the

HOCKEY 
Woes continue in loss, tie against Ferris State 

-
By SAM WERNER Spor!S Wriler 
Notre Dame may not have broken out of its Christmas slump just quite yet. 
After 6-l and 4-1 wins over Bowling Green two woeks ago, all appeared to hn well with the Irish. But after a 5-3 loss and 2-2 tie to Ferris State this wnek­end, coach Jnl'f' Jackson's squad finds itself in a per­ilous position for the CCIIA playoffs. 
"That may be on ll of th1~ worst ganws we played all season long," Jackson said al'tor Friday night's loss. "They wore thn better eoached tnam, they wnre the better preparnd team." 
Ferris State 5, Notre Dame 3 
The Irish got on the board early in the first game, when Kevin Deeth netted a power play goal 11:56 into the first period. Erik Condra passed the puck from the point to Hyan Thang in front of the net. Thang slid the puck across the crease to Deeth, who calmly slid the puck past Ferris State goalie Mitch O'Keefe, who made 28 saves on the night.
