G r e g Greg Crawford 
Crawford is an extraordinary scien­tist, an award-winning teacher, a prolific researcher, and a gifted administrator," University Provost Thomas Burish said. "In addition to being internationally recognized for his innovative research on liquid-crystal displays, he has leveraged his knowledge of basic science to develop several medical devices that impact the detection of infectious dis­eases, treatment of rare diseases and the interac­tion of medications with muscular tissue." 
Burish said Crawford's enthusiasm, as well as his attraction to the University's Catholic mis­sion, makes him a good fit 
for the Notre Dame com­munity. 
"Greg brings exceptional energy and an entrepre­neurial VISion to the College of Science," he said. "Greg is particularly attracted to the Catholic mission and academic ambition of Notre Dame." 
Before assuming the deans position at Brown in 2006, Crawford was a researcher for the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, as well as for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Crawford also co-founded two biotech companies and holds of 15 U.S. patents. 
According to Burish, under Crawford's leader­
ship, the College of Science will see an increase in its connections with the other colleges on campus, as well as with the South Bend community. 
"Greg loves to build bridges with other academ­ic units, so he is already thinking about establishing mutually beneficial collab­orations with the Colleges of Engineering, Arts and Letters, and Business as well as Innovation Park an.d the Indiana University School of Medicine South Bend," said Burish.

Experts discuss eating disorders at ND 
By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 
As part of the weeklong "Live as You Are" Health and Body Image Conference, two Notre Dame specialists discussed eat­ing disorders and body image on campus in the University Counseling Center's portion of the sympusium Thursday in McKenna Hall. 
Valerie Staples, a counselor and coordinator for Eating Disorder Services at the University Counseling Center (UCC), and Mindy Wallpy, a doctoral intern at the UCC, addressed campus body issue issues as well as services that the UCC provides to help stu­dents. 
"What situations here have contributed to your view of food, weight and body image?" 
asked Staples, who has worked at the UCC for about seven years. 
The audience, organized into small groups, brainstormed a number of body image issues, from over exercising at Rolfs Sports Recreation Center to jokes about the characteristi­cally "unattractive" Notre Dame women to the perfec­tionism environment on cam­pus -all of which shed light on the body image issues, both in general and specific to Notre Dame. 
Such situations, Staples said, are oftentimes hard to pin­point, since activities such as eating healthily and exercising seem commonplace on such an intellectual university campus. 
"I think in general, people just want to be healthy," fresh-

Student learns nevv Inedicines 
Serazin compiles guide to traditional remedies 
By KATE McCLELLAND News Writer 
Inspired by an International Summer Service Learning Program (ISSLP) two summers ago, senior Nathan Serazin returned to Ecuador this past summer to conduct research and compile a handbook detailing the simi­larities between traditional remedies and modern medi­cines. 
"It grew out of my own interest in medical anthro­pology and biochemistry, but what really inspired me was the first hand experi­ence that I received from talking to people in the community,'1 Serazin said. 
During his time in the ISSLP, Serazin had worked at a village's local hospital where patients often requested traditional reme­dies as a part of their care. 
Unfortunately, the doctors' limited knowledge resulted in them only prescribing more typical modern solu­tions for the patient's health concerns. 
Serazin's goal for the fol­lowing summer was to com­pile a handbook for doctors that would describe the plants used in traditional remedies and how those same plants are used in modern medicines. 
His return trip to Ecuador was funded by a grant from

SMC students recount trials of itntnigrants 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Saint Mary's Hispanic­American society, La Fuerza, examined the plight of illegal immigrants 
. through recounting personal testimonies in its first Immigrant Monologues Thursday as part of its Week of Action. La Fuerza co-president junior Chrissy Romo and senior Jeanne Choquehuanca each read from a book of immigrant stories entitled "Stranger in Ones Land" and Romo recounted her grandpar­ents' trials when coming to 
America 
The passage read by Romo, which translated is means "Here No One Speaks Spanish," told of the Mexican-American's prob­lems pertaining to the lan­guage barrier they face. 
She read about how Spanish is considered a "dirty language," and one student was told, "if you .~ant to be an American you have to speak English." 
Choquehuanca presented the story of the Mexican immigrant, Chavez. · 
"Mexico and its poverty loom over him like an omi­nous cloud," she said.

B-Macfor President 
The Indiana primaries are fast 
upon us and, as you know, the 
country is' facing very seriously 
grave problems. This is why 
America needs you to vote B. Mac 
for president. 

My rivals have suggested that I 
am not fit to be president. I will 
admit that I am not a typical can­
didate, what with my morality, 
humility and stunning good looks. 
Indeed, as class president in the 
fifth grade, I have accumulated 
more executive experience than my 
three rivals combined. But enough 
about my experience and on to the 
gravely serious problems we face. 
Like Senator 

Obama, I will Brian McKenzie 
agree uncondi­
tionally to meet 

News Wire 
with the leaders 

Editor
of states like 
Iran and Syria. 
Furthermore, I 

pledge that I will end every sen­
tence with them with "or else." 
Like Senator McCain, I have a 
bold national security strategy that 
will fully integrate each branch of 
our armed services. What would 
the role of a fully integrated Air 
Force look like, you ask? Please 
see my attached map of Iran for 
more details. 

Like Senator Clinton, I vow to 
offer mandated universal health­
care to every American. And my 
healthcare plan is this: Get a job. 
If any Americans are delinquent in 
meeting their mandate, l promise 
to understand that this is not 
because they are unwilling or 
unable to work but because of the 
tender mercies of a cold, heartless 
NAFTA treaty that I might theoreti­
cally have once supported. 
Accordingly, I will offer these 
oppressed Americans an involun­
tary position on American 
Gladiators. 

As Americans, we believe in free­
dom. As Americans, we believe in 
the fundamental dignity of human 
beings (Except terrorists, obvious­
ly). 

As Americans, we believe that my 
opponents are a disheveled bunch 
of KKK crack addicts that are 
wholly unqualified to run anything 
more complicated than a food 
processor. 

My opponents are pawns of spe­
cial interests. Big Oil, Big Labor, 
Big Media and Big Toilet Paper 
(not to be confused with Big Media) 
are so incestuously close to my 
opponents that even describing 
their relationship is illegal in 
twenty states. 

I will stand up to these somehow 
legal groups and defend every 
American's right to toilet paper 
that makes Notre Dame's huddle in 
the corner and cry. 

In cpncl usion, vote for me (or 
else!) If you require any other 
information, please see my cam­

DANBURY, Conn. Danbury officials have been notified they are being sued by a student who was awakened in class by a teacher who made a loud noise.

Park energy project funded 
Undergrads will research energy use, pollution in the Dunes parks 
Special to The Observer 
The University-National Park Energy Partnership Program (UNPEPP) has fund­ed a joint project between the Notre Dame Energy Center and the National Park Service at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore to pro­vide energy related consult­ing services to the park dur­ing this coming summer. 
During the course of the project, three undergraduate students from the University will work with park officials, conducting onsite research that will result in specific recommendations for capital improvement at the Indiana Dunes facilities. 
According to Joan F. Brennecke, Keating­Crawford Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Notre Dame Energy Center, the students' work will focus on energy conser­vation and savings. 
"This is a wonderful oppor­
tunity for the stu­dents to put their training i n t o practice in a real­w or I d setting t h a t encom­passes project manage-m e n t skills, use of resources." 
As part of the project, stu­dents will be required to track and quantify the cost savings -and projected pay­back in terms of resources, such as energy use reduction and lower greenhouse gas emissions -relating to their 
recommenda­tions. 
Participants in the 10-week project are Tom Furlong, a junior study­ing aerospace and mechani­cal engineer­ing; Brian Klein, a senior political sci­ence major; and Jackie Mirando! a

Pointing to University

Staples said that other food situations are morn obvious on campus, such as eating con­cerns addressed by previously interviewnd anonymous stu­dents, mentioning that some avoid eating dessert at the din­ing halls and avoid tailgates and dorms evnnts that are bound to provide food. 
"These kinds of events make 
students already concerned 
with body image even more 
nervous about food," Staples 
said. 

Wallpy discussed body image, which, she said, is not how a person really looks but rather how he or she pnrceives his or hnr own body. According to Wallpy, eating disorders dis­tort this image as she deseribed thn three most com­mon disorders -anoroxia, bulimia nervosa and binge eat­ing. 
Wallaby emphasized the importance of focusing on posi­tive body image when influ­ences such as the media per­petuate negative body image stereotypes. 
"When you're getting ready, instead of saying, 'Does this make me look fat?' try 'How great do I look in this?"' 
The two presenters pointed to s tatis tics that verify the sweeping eating disorder epi-· demic among college students. 
"When I started working at the UCC lin 2001) I saw a few students with minor concfJrns about eating," Staples said. "Ovnr the years we have been seeing more and more students come in with such concerns." 
Staples said that the percent­age of students coming to the UCC with eating concerns, however, has remained more or less constant -around 12 percent for the past two years. The percentage of s.tudents who come into the UCC for interpersonal concerns is about double this number, at around 23 percent. 
Staples pointed to a number of rnasons for students begin­ning college to come into the open about their eating con­cerns. 
"It is diflicult for students to adapt to new challenges at col­lege," Staples said. 
She mentioned a number of new challenges that also exac­erbate food issues for students, such us balancing social life and academics as well as learning to live with new eat­ing habits and the large variety of food choices available at dining halls.

Iranian hardliners predict sweep 
QOM-Ali Farahani smiles as he talks about Iran's parliament elections Friday. The young cleric in this spiritual center of the Islamic revolu­tion says the vote will sweep the country closer to hard-liners' ideal of the Islamic state. 
In Tehran, computer technician Hadi Rezaei, a backer of democratic reforms, sees little hope ­and no reason to vote. 
Conservatives, particularly allies of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are expected to maintain the domination of parliament they have had since 2004. If they do so by a strong margin, it would demonstrate the Islamic leader­ship's ability to ward off a comeback by reformist'>. 
Ahead of the vote, the Guardian Council -an unelected body of clerics and jurists -disquali­fied around 1,700 candidates, mostly reformists. Those barred from running were judged insuffi­ciently loyal to Islam or the revolution.

House approves $683 billion tax hike 
WASIIINGTON -The Seriate on Thursday rejected the idea of renewing many of President Bush's tax cuts as all three major presidential candidates interrupted their campaigns to cast their votes. The House approved a budget blueprint that would raise taxes by $683 billion over the next five years. 
The Senate did embrace Bush reductions aimed at low-income workers, married cou­ples and people with children. 
The House budget plan would provide gen­erous incre~ses to domestic federal programs but still is designed to bring the government's budget back into the black by letting all of Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. That plan passed the House on. a 212-207 vote with Hepublicans unanimously opposing it. 
The Senate voted 99-1 to extend the cuts for some workers as well as couples and parents. Senators voted 52-47 to reject a move to extend tax cuts for middle-and higher­ineome taxpayers, investors and people inher­iting businesses and big estates.

Troops seal violent western region 
Thirteen civilians die in fighting aiming to "correct historical injustices" by redistributing land 
Associated Press 
NAMANGOFULO, Kenya -The military sealed off a region of western Kenya where land disputes have flared into violence, and witnesses said helieopter gunships were strafing the area Thursday to try to drive gunmen from forests and eaves. 
"Always in this country, people are fighting over land," said Luey Okello, head nurse at · Kitale District Hospital, where four girls were being treat­ed for severe burns after their village was attacked, allegedly by the Sabaot Land Defense Force, a militia fighting for the redistribution of land.

Chinese gadgets may contain viruses 
From iPods to navigation systems, some of today's hottest gadgets are landing on store shelves with some unwanted extras from the factory -pre-installed viruses that steal pass­words, open doors for hackers and make com­puters spew spam. 
Computer users have been warned for years about virus threats from downloading Internet porn and opening suspicious e-mail attach­ments. Now they run the risk of picking up a digital infection just by plugging a new gizmo into their PCs. 
Recent cases reviewed by The Associated Press include some of the most widely used tech devices: Apple iPods, digital·picture frames sold by Target and Best Buy stores and TomTom navigation gear. 
In most cases, Chinese factories -where many companies have turned to keep prices low -are the source. 

Bush backs tighter mortgage rules 
WASHINGTON -Economic policymakers on Thursday recommended stricter regulation of mortgage lenders as part of a broad effort to prevent a repeat of a credit crisis threatening to drive the country into recession. 
With problems in the credit and housing mar­kets worsening, the Bush administration now seems to favor a larger role for government ­an approach for which Republicans generally have had little appetite. 
Hecommendations from a presidential adviso­ry group on financial markets cover mortgage lenders and other institutions, as well as investors, credit ratings agencies and regula­tors. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who leads that group. said the efl'ort is not about "finding excuses and scapegoats." The suggested actions, hn said, are intended to avoid another meltdown in the credit and housing markets. 
'The objective here is to get the balance right. Hegulation needs to catch up with innovation and hnlp restore investor confidence but not go so far as to create new problems, make our markets less nflicient or cut off credit to those who need it," Paulson said.

Katrina victitns still avvaiting checks 

Homeowners unhappy about lack of government compensation 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS-Two and a half years after Hurricane Katrina, tens of thousands of miserable homeowners are still waiting for their government rebuilding checks, and many complain they can't even get their calls returned. But the com­pany that holds the big contract to distribute the aid is doing quite well for itself. 
ICF International of Fairfax, Va., has posted strong profits, gone public, landed additional multimillion-dollar government contracts, and, it was learned this week, secured a potentially big raise recently from the state of Louisiana. - 
In the waning days of Gov. Kathleen Blanco's administra­tion, state oflicials increased the management contract ceiling from $756 million to $912 mil­lion -this, after the Legislature wanted to fire ICF over its han­dling of the homeowner recovery program, called Road Home. 
''I'm flabbergasted that this company could be so ineflicient and could mess up so consistent­ly and for so long," said Bill Yurt, 57, who has been living in a FEMA trailer for 2 years. 
He said ICF hasn't sent an appraiser to determine the grant amount that will resurrect his gutted house in Gentilly. And his calls to an ICF caseworker have gone unreturned for a month. 
Hoad Home was created in June 2006 as a state-run, feder­ally funded plan to compsmsate homeowners for the breach of New Orleans' government-run levees. Homeowners can apply for grants to repair their homes, or obtain buyouts if they don't want to fix things up. 
Yet, 56,000 applicants -near­ly 40 percent of the qualified total -had yet to receive a cent as of last month. Plagued by cost overruns and delays, Road Home is expected to cost the taxpayers $10 billion in federal money and has become another glaring symbol of frustration and red tape in post-Katrina New Orleans. 

"Supposedly they had the expertise, but what we've learned ever since is it's been on­the-job training," said Frank Silvestri, co-chairman of the Citizens Road Home Action Team, or CHAT, a community group that was formed in anger over ICF. 
ICF spokeswoman Gentry Brann blamed the state's ever­changing rules and political meddling by officials and com­munity groups for many of Road Home's difficulties. 
She complained that Road Home has come to be regarded as an entitlement program, and said the company must carefully evaluate 157,000 applications to guard against fraud. 
'The state essentially redefined the goal of the program from rebuilding to relief in mid­stream," Brann said. 
She said the $912 million that the company could earn is to cover the costs of the program and was approved by public ofli­cials. 
"It's very important to note this is not a 'pay increase.' It's not actually even 'pay' to ICF. Rather it is an increase in the contract ceiling to cover the additional unit price costs incurred by our subcontractors," Brann said. 
The state got tough with ICF last year, threatening to termi­nate its contract, an.d but ulti­mately set benchmarks to force it to "close," or decide, cases more quickly. 
However, ICF now stands accused of inflating its closing figures by deliberately using red tape, confusion and delays to get applicants to settle for low grant amounts. 


Convicting N.Y. Governer unlikely 
Legal experts believe that charges against Spitzer will be minimal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -As Gov. Eliot Spitzer prepares to leave office, the disgraced politi­cian races a tangled battle with prosecutors that will send lawyers into murky legal territory. 
A law enforcement official said Spitzer's high-powered defense team was believed to be negotiating a plea deal with prosecutors over his connection to a high-end prostitution ring, but attor­neys were not commenting Thursday about the discus­sions. 
The legal battle occurred as Lt. Gov. David Paterson pre­pared to take over the state following Spitzer's spectacu­lar fall from power. Paterson said he spoke to Spitzer on Thursday and "told him how sorry I was this happened." 
"I promised the governor yesterday that I would com­mit myself to the people of this great state. that we would have stability and con­tinue in thesn challenges that lie ahead," Paterson said. "Now we have to get New York back on track." 
Paterson takes over on Monday, and will become New York's l"irst black gover­nor and the nation's first legally blind chief executive. 
Spitzer, a married father of three teenage girls, faces a much more dubious future after he was accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars on prostitutes ­including a tryst with a 22­year-old call girl in Washington the night before Valentine's Day. Officials said Spitzer initially drew the attention of authorities with suspicious money transfers that will be a key part of any possible criminal case. 
Among the possible charges that could be brought against Spitzer: soliciting and paying for sex; violating the Mann Act, the 1910 federal law that makes it a crime to induce someone to cross state lines for immoral purposes; and illegally arranging cash transactions to conceal their purpose. 
But legal experts said bringing charges and getting a conviction would be unusu­al, considering federal authorities rarely charge the customers in illegal sex or drug cases. A likely outcome could be what is called a "deferred prosecution agree­ment," which could leave Spitzer on probation with charges dropped if he did not get into any more trouble. 
Gerald Lefcourt, past presi­dent of the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, said crim­
ina! charges against Spitzer would be "stretching federal statutes to a place they've never been." 
Edward J .M. Little, who worked in the public corrup­tion unit of the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office for eight years in the 1980s, said it would be "piling on" to bring charges now. 
"I think it would be outra­geous 'if they went after him any further on this," he said. "Solicitation cases are typi­cally pled down to minor charges and just because he was governor doesn't mean he should be treated any more harshly unless they impacted his duties as gover­nor." 
He added: "Even though I personally think it's repre­hensible, it doesn't mean it's criminal. He's resigned which is probably the ultimate penalty in this case so we should let it be." 
The most likely· charge Spitzer could face is structur­ing -breaking sums of money down into smaller amounts to hide the true pur­
pose of the funds  - but it is  
rarely brought  as a stand­ 
alone charge.  

Lawyers said they are usu­ally brought in money-laun­dering cases or as part of some larger criminal activity such as drug dealing. 
PAKISTAN 


Civilians killed in U.S.-led attacks 
Associated Press 
TANGRAI U.S.-Ied forces in Afghanistan fired across the border into Pakistan in a strike target­ing Taliban militants, and the Pakistani army said Thursday that civilians were killed. 
The attack illustrates Washington's concern the Taliban and al-Qaida are using Pakistan's lawless frontier as a base for attacks in Afghanistan. 
But anger at civilian deaths could lead to a review by the incoming Pakistani government of the country's counterter­rorism strategy and its U.S.-backed policy of using military force to root out militants. 
A spokesman for the U.S.­led coaliti,on in Afghanistan said troops used "precision­guided munitions" to strike 
a  compound about  a  mile  
inside  Pakistan  on  
Wednesday.  

Maj. Chris Belcher said the troops were responding to an "imminent threat" and that the coalition informed Pakistani authori­ties after the strike. 
"We received reliable intelligence indicating sen­ior Haqqani network mem­bers were in the compound at the time of the strike," Belcher said Thursday in Kabul. 
Siraj Haqqani is a promi­nent Afghan militant. On Wednesday, a coalition statement accused him of organizing a suicide attack that killed two NATO sol­diers at an Afghan govern­ment office on March 3. It said Haqqani "has become the most dangerous Taliban leader in Afghanistan." 
In Tangrai, a village of about 40 houses surround­ed by fields and mountains, residents led an Associated Press reporter to the rubble of the house hit in the attack. Only one of its four walls was-standing amid a tangle of mud bricks, bed­ding and cooking pots. 
"We are innocent, we have nothing to do with such things," said Noor Khan, a greengrocer who said the house was his fam­ily home. 
He said six of his relatives -four women and two boys -died in the attack. 
"We are poor people just trying to earn a living," he said. 
The Pakistani army said four civilians -two women and two children -died. There was no way to resolve the discrepancy between the numbers. 
It was not clear whether the coalition forces fired from the ground or the air or what weapons were used. Belcher said he could not detail the threat and had no information on casualties. 
Pakistan's army, which has received billions of dol­lars from Washington to fight al-Qaida and the Taliban, initially said the incident was an accident. 
Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, 
an army spokesman, said five artillery shells fired by coalition forces strayed into Pakistan's North Waziristan region. One shell hit a home in the village, killing two women and two chil­dren, he said. 
Asked later about the coalition statement that the compound had been hit deliberately, Abbas said the government summoned a coalition representative to explain. 
"We have called for an explanation of whatever statement they have given," Abbas said. Firing across the border "is a violation and second, civilians were killed," he said. 
Asked whether militants were present, Abbas said: "We have asked them to explain how the civilian casualties occurred.'' 
Pakistan has deployed approximately 90,000 troops to hunt down mili­tants in its border regions. President Pervez Musharraf has sought to convince Pakistanis that they are fighting to protect their own country, not just for America's sake. 
But with violence escalat­ing in Afghanistan and Pakistan, many here hope the anti-Musharraf parties who triumphed in parlia­mentary elections last month will scale back mili­tary activities and seek dia­logue with militant groups, whose influence has been growing. 
Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for the party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said the new parlia­ment would review its counterterrorism strategy. 
"Pakistap.'s integrity and territorial sovereignty should be respected," Iqbal told the AP. "Killing of innocent people is highly deplorable and there should not be any repeat." 
There have been several incidents in the past of coalition fire landing in Pakistani territory. 
Some may be due to the poor demarcation of the long, rugged border. In June last year, a rocket fired during a battle between U.S.-led NATO forces and insurgents in Afghanistan struck a home in North Waziristan, killing 10 civilians. 
But there have also been several cases where unmanned U.S. drones have fired missiles at suspected militant hideouts in Pakistan's border regions, including a strike in January that killed a senior al-Qaida commander. 
U.S. military officials and soldiers have said on sever­al occasions that they already have authority to pursue or fire on militants a short distanee inside Pakistan. 
Pakistani officials usually deny such incidents or voice complaints with no obvious consequences, leading many to believe that cross-border strikes are carried out with Islamabad's tacit blessing.

NDSP inconsistent with 'Breytopia' 
When NDSP ordered the students camping outside the Joyce Center before Notre Dame's game against Syracuse on Feb. 22, they cited the "safety and security" of the students as the reason for asking students to leave. 
Even though this is a legitimate concern of any university, there was apparently no concern for the safety of these stu­dents until this one game. Students participating in what has become dubbed "Breytopia" had already camped out prior to several games in this and them camp out on multiple occasions only to shut them down later. 

The safety and security issues havo been proven wrong on other large campuses, notably DukP and Penn State. The most well-known exampln is "Krzyzcwskiville" for Duke University men's basketball. Thern have been no major inei­dents reported, and Krzyzewskivilln is much larger than 
Breytopia. 

Thfl reason is simple: Duke understands that

Moreover, this abrupt change in policy has and works with thB students to make this enthu­yet to be addressed directly by any University siasm possible. It is regulated by Duke and the

Editorial
of'ficial. In fact, NDSP director Phil Johnson student government there, not harassed by cam-
and associate viee president for Hesidence Life Bill Kirk both said they did not know why the students were not asked to move earlier in the season. 
Students who have camped out prior to the Syracuse game also said that NDSP stopped by Breytopia and did not shut them down then. 
NDSP changed the enforcement of its policies for this one game, and doing so it was unfair to the students. 
But the rule itself is rtawed. Outdoor gatherings are allowed for other events, including sleeping in cardboard boxos Jor Habitat for Humanity. Kirk said that students can apply for permission to camp out, but that Breytopia will not likely be granted approval in the future. 
It is ono thing to say that since the fans didn't apply for and get a p<wmit, they must be removed. It is another to let pus cops. 

Notre Dame should look to this as an nxample. This is not an issue to take a hard stance on; this is an issue that can be reconciled with a littln work by both sides. 
Give Duke a call. Sen how they handle the thousands of fans that camp outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. If Duke can keep the many Blun Devil fans safe, Notre Dame can work with the students and NDSP to protect a few dozen Breytopians. 
Since University offic:ials do not know why the sudden enforcement began, thny should find out. When thny do, they should work with students to get them back by the JoycP Center, supporting the team, in a University-supportnd way. No reason to abridge fan support during such a successful year to suddenly enforce a rule.

Reflecting on the ~aster season 
For Christians, the upcoming week cul­minates a period of preparation with a celebration of what defines the soul of Christianity-eight days of remem­brance reenacting the jubilance of Palm Sunday, the inti­macy of the last supper, the devas­tation of Good Friday capped by the calm and rebirth of Easter Sunday. It is the most certain time of the liturgical year, the rock upon which Catholics Capitol base their faith. Yet, Comments despite such a stur­dy foundation, faith only derives one per­son at a time. 
While attending the Latin mass before I entered elementary school, I noticed the smallest details of my surroundings. I knew phrases like "dominus vobiscum," but had no idea what that meant. Rather, I noticed how long my father prayed while kneeling alone before mass. I won­dered why nobody prayed as long as him, sometimes until the priest entered in pro­cession. It took years before I realized that he had lost both of his parents while still in his twenties and that he probably had much to say. Moreover, I could not begin to imagine the prayets he must have said in relation to his World War II service. 

Vatican II welcomed Catholics to a new faith by allowing us to speak in our native tongues at mass, thus understanding it. Prior to Pope John XXIII directing the Church into more friendly waters, our parents taught us the basic prayers like the Our Father and Hail Mary. I learned a special prayer after I noticed that my father tipped his hat when we drove past a Catholic church. Mter asking him what he was doing, my dad taught me to pay reverence to God in front of the church by bowing my head and saying, "Jesus my Lord and my God." 
I vividly recall that nuns seldom taught me prayers. They seemed to be more focused on the process by preparing us for the sacraments. I can still hear Sister Roberta who would severely punish any­one who dare call her Sister "Bobby." She drilled into us confessional content while pounding her knuckles on the desk. In unison t{) the beat of her thumping we loudly repeated together, "I kept impure thoughts in my mind. I did impure things." Mter learning how to swear like a sailor at Notre Dame, today I still am confused about what impure means. 
In 2000, when my father passed away, I again thought of his long prayer sessions prior to mass. One Easter week I decided to pray for his past intentions even though I did not know their content. Surely God would remember those prayers, but would they be heard? Did my father recite a set of traditional prayers or simply speak to his parents? Did my grandparents greet him during his quiet passing after surgery? Eventually I real­ized that for a religion so grounded in a series of fixed events during Easter week, answers also come one person at a time. 
My personal answers evolved through creating my own prayers...sort of like when my dad taught me that special prayer to say when passing by the church. My prayers center around the consecration of bread and wine during mass. As the priest holds the host, I say, "Jesus, my Lord, my God, forgive me of my sins." When the priest then hoists the chalice of wine, I utter, "Lord, come five in my heart and keep a place for me in your sacred heart." Those small, quiet gestures focus on my need to fill a void of ersatz faith where the church has failed me. 
For all of the surety of Christiallity, no one fully prepares us for life's uncertain­ties. Notre Dame students were not pre­pared to face the deaths of two fellow stu­dents last month. None of us fully recov­ers from the passing of our loved ones whether they be close family relatives or even dear pets. We begin the remainder of our lives with an ache .in our hearts and a yearning for one more moment together. Nobody learns how to cope prior to a loss, so our personal faiths evolve as time passes. 
I sustain myself with the thought that we are only here for as long as we need to be. I learned that by losing my parents. Yet, I did not lose them as early in life as my father lost his, nor have I ever faced the horrors of death that he did in World War II. My only hope can be that he greets me on my deathbed and shares his pre-mass litany. At that time I expect to begin again because of my singular faith.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Reconsider financial aid 
In December, Harvard announced that students from families earning less than $60,000 would no longer be required to pay for any educational expenses. Other members of the educational elite including Yale, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania and Stanford have all followed suit with similar fmancial aid policies. With some of the most prestigious universities already on board why is Notre Dame waiting on the sidelines? 
The procrastination is not due to a lack of funds. As of June 30, Notre Dame had an endow­ment of approximately $6.5 billion and had earned an annual return on its endowment of $1.4 billion. Not bad, but isn't Notre Dame sup­posed to be a not-for-profit educational institu­tion? 
With an endowment fund in the billions and educational costs prohibitive for middle and low income families, the University has yet to recog­nize that educational expenses have far outpaced family incomes. Notre Dame continues to require its students to fund their education with student loans while the educational elite have opened their coffers to fully aid needy families. The schools following Harvard's lead have proven that their students are their first priority. 
Notre Dame is currently engaged in a fundrais­ing effort called the Spirit of Notre Dame. One purpose of the fundraiser is to increase the funds available for financial aid. A university with a $6.5 billion endowment has to engage in a fundraising campaign to increase the funds avail­able for fmancial aid? More generous financial aid packages should be built into the budget and should not be dependent on additional fundrais­ing campaigns. 
Due solely to their economic background, stu­dents are unfairly asked to make educational decisions based on cost. Rather than growing an already bloated endowment, I propose that Notre Dame use those funds to adopt a comprehensive fmancial aid policy on par with the example set by Harvard. The size and growth of the University's endowment seems to be more of a priority than economic diversity and the needs of its students. Someone should remind the University's administration that endowment size really doesn't matter; what matters is how you use it.

Obama's message more than words 
Throughout this year's presidential primary, Barack Obama has traveled around the country, consistently filling stadiums and auditoriums with people who want to hear his message. Yet Obama's message has drawn attacks from the other candidates, who charac­terize his "words" as more sound byte than substance. Though, I confess at the outset, I am a supporter of Barack Obama because I believe he possesses the intelligence, judgment and tact to lead our country, this letter is honestly not a call for reader's votes. It is a call to our generation -be you a McCain, Clinton or Nader supporter-to vote for who you wish, but to not tear down Obama's message of hope in the process. 
Obama's message of hope doesn't merely call us to "Rock the Vote." No, that's already been done. Obama is calling us to do more. Indeed, casting our votes and canvassing for our candidates are the grassroots of his message of hope for our democracy, but such activities can only happen once every two or four years. His message to us is that democracy doesn't take a break in between elections, so why should we. We must find ways to participate in our country, be it by volunteering, working for the government or, yes, maybe even running the government. 
I recently received a phone call from a close college friend who informed me that he had decided to run for a State House of Representatives seat in Missouri, and it dawned on me just then, that is how big Obama's message of hope can inspire us to think. I know there are great stories out there of people in our generation pursuing their public service ambitions, but my fear is that there are far too many in dorm rooms at universities, or in cubicles (offices if we're lucky) at first-jobs, that have already dismissed the possibility of a future public service· career -not because of a lack of desire to serve the country, but because of a lack of inspiration from the current state of our politics. 

It takes a special kind of person to run for public office of any sort, no doubt, but honestly, I hope it doesn't require us to be that special. I hope a solid education, hard worth ethic, love of this country and the desire to serve others is enough to allow a person to make a run at it. Obama's "words" inspire us to think that is enough. More than mere sound bytes and feel-good rhetoric, Obama's words and his candidacy are a call to us to engage in our democracy today, and not put it off for a future generation. We must each find our own way of participating in our democracy, be it running for the White House, or writing one's first ever letter. Maybe my city council or mayoral campaign isn't that far off.

'Skirt day' can wait 
During my four years at Notre Dame, I have always wanted to write a letter for the Viewpoint section of The Observer. I've considered weighing in on whether or not to change the Fight Song (which, for the record, I'm against). I've also thought about joining in the oh-so­heated debate regarding the Vagina Monologues. But, until today, no issue has truly motivated me to offer my opinion. Finally, however, I've seen something on this campus that has inspired me to write: the premature appearance of shorts and skirts on my female counter­parts at this fine University. 
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy "Skirt Day" (the.somehow­official day that all females decide to don their cutest skirts and bare their legs in celebration of Spring) as much as the next guy or girl. Shaved legs, sandals, pedi­cures, freedom from the tyranny of pants and even long­johns -I'm all for it. I love it. However, I'm disturbed by a recent trend by my fellow students to try to actualize this day too soon. 

Yes, a sunny day and a high of 45 is enough to tempt any self-respecting female (or male-there's no dis­crimination here) into a pair of shorts. But my friends, last time I checked, goose-pimpled legs due to cold tem­peratures is not attractive. 
Let's fully respect "Skirt Day" and give it our all. Therefore, I encourage all women (and again, men too) to wait a week or so more for the perfect spring day and then, and only then, to display our legs in all their post­spring-break glory.

The fourth season of Bravo's hit show, Project Runway, did more than crown a winner with its con­clusion last week. The finale, with 5.2 million total viewers, set a viewership record for the channel in 
. the 18 to 49 year-old demographic, with an average of 3.75 million viewers, up 9 percent from last sea­son's finale. This number put Bravo ahead of two of the three broadcast networks (ABC and CBS) at the 10 p.m. time slot that night. 
Many celebrities attended the finale, which showed three finalists' collections in a runway show in Bryant Park during New York Fashion Week. Supermodel and host of the show, Heidi Klum, designer Michael Kors and Elle fashion director Nina Garda sat front row to observe and critique the new creations, and Victoria "Posh Spice" Beckham joined them as a guest judge for the final episode. 
Beckham has begun her own fashion line, DVB, 
Next down the runway were the Joan of Arc­inspired pieces created by Rami Kashou, a 31-year­old born in Jerusalem. Kashou beat out Chris March's human hair decorated eolleetion in a design-off to make it to the final show in Bryant Park. His final eollection was· punctuated with bold eolors against black pieces and intricate details in his folding, pleating, weaving and draping. 
The last two looks that Kashou showed were ele­gant gowns, one in a eream colored tiered vintage lace and the other in a textured and layered blaek. However, the judges objeeted to many of Kashou's design decisions. Kors said that the colors were not chic enough for the elothes and referred to them as "Brady Bunch colors." He did however, praise the designer's showcasing every category of attire. Garcia's thought Kashou had the strongest point of view of all the designers, and his main strength lay in eveningwear. 
Finally, the youngest finalist had his turn to show off his work. Christian Siriano, 21, moved to London right after high sehool to study and work with famous British designers Alexander MeQueen and

Siriano's mostly black eollee­tion contrasted hard and soft looks, with full, feathered coats and voluminous neckpieces paired with skinny pants. Kors praised the collection, saying that it was "cohesive, powerful­looking" and had "chie drama." Even Beekham was pleased, "You really made me smile, and I'm not easy to make smile." 
Siriano was declared the win­ner, due to the eonsistently styl­ish look of all his pieees. and 
who presented at fashion week was also something that stood out. Garcia was especially impressed with the amateur colleetions. "This is the last day of New York Fashion Week, and I've seen a lot of it, and it eould fit right in there," she said. 
The first d<~signs to hit the runway were those of .lillian Lewis, a 26-year-old former designer and illustrator for American design ieon Ralph Lauren. Lewis' designs were inspired by Master of the Argonauts, a 15th-century. Florentine work of art. She discovered this painting during the last chal­lenge of the season, in whieh designers took a field trip to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lewis was praised by the judges for the knitwear she sent down the runway, whieh stood out amid the subtle fall colors and bold eoat silhouettes in the 
of her collection.

Siriano had previously been named the season's Fan Favorite, as voted on by viewers, with 43 per­eent of the vote. He told The Washington Post that the first thing he was going to do with the $10,000 prize was to purchase a bed to sleep on. "That's no joke, because I really need it. I still don't have one,"

Couples takes lead in 1st round at Bay Hill 
Associated Press 
OHLANDO, Fla. -Fred Couples made four birdies in his opening six holes, shot S­under 65, and golf finally felt fun. Tiger Woods couldn't hit tiHl green with a wedge, struggled to shoot even par, and he finally looked human. 
The Arnold Palmer Invitational delivered a few surprises Thursday, none big­ger than the 48-year-old Couples booming tee shots, taking only 23 putts and fin­ishing atop the leaderboard with J.J. Henry. 
"This doesn't make me the guy to beat;" Couples said. "If I ean play like that, it makes it a lot easier. When you birdie four out of the first six holes, there's not much that can bother you." 
In three previous trips to Bay Hill, Henry had never done better than 71. He played under warm sunshine without a bogey, making four birdie putts outside 15 feet. 
"I feel like l(ve been close," he said. "And today, finally, everything clicked." 
They were a stroke ahead of defending champion Vijay Singh, Lee Westwood, Tom Lehman and Lucas Glover, who got a pep talk from friends to quit being so hard on himself. Despite consecu­tive bogeys, Glover kept his cool and ended a streak of eight consecutive rounds without breaking 70. 
For Couples, it was his best score at Bay Hill since a 63 in 1992, the year he won this tournament and was No. 1 in the world. 

Woods is the world's No. 1 player now, having won every tournament he has played since September. It sure didn't look that way after a birdie on the opening hole. He missed one green with a pitching wedge, another green with a sand wedge, and settled for a 70 that left him five shots behind, but not in awful shape.

Bargar leads ND into S.C. 
By CHRIS DOYEN 
Sports Writer 

Coming off' a 3-2 weekend in Long Beach, Calif., which led to junior pitcher Brittany Bargar being named Big East Pitcher of' the Week, the Irish ( 1 0-8) head to Charleston, S.C., to take part in the Charleston Southern University Lowcountry Softball Invitational. 
Bargar made five appear­ances for the Irish last week, pitching 25.1 innings and recording a miniscule ERA of' 
0.55. In that same period, Bargar struck out 21 com­pared to only three walks, and allowed only two earned runs. 
On the season, Bargar has an 8-5 record and a 1.00 ERA, second among Big East pitchers. Of the 23 runs scored against her on the season, only 11 of' them have been earned. 
Despite the stellar pitching, the Irish could not register wins against No. 6 UCLA and Long Beach State due to a lack of' run support. The offense did show signs of' life in a victory over Cal State Northridge last weekend, where freshman Sadie Pitzenberger's two-run dou­ble was all the support that Bargar needed. 
The Irish will face Towson (11-7) and Charleston Southern (10-17) on Friday before taking on Campbell (17-8) and a to-be-deter­mined opponent on Saturday. 
Towson is coming off of a split with Georgetown in a doubleheader on Wednesday. Towson's victory in the first game gave them a four-game winning streak that was built mainly on the strength of senior Nina Navarro's bat. The Towson offense stalled in the nightcap as the Tigers suffered a 2-0 defeat at the hands of the Hoyas. 
Following the early morn­ing game with Towson, the Irish will take on a Charleston Southern team that had a tough series last weekend in the Bulldog 
Classic in Starkville, Miss. That tournament capped a brutal stretch that included 18 games in only 11 days. 
The Buccaneers were able to pull out two victories over Austin Peay, one of which went eight innings, but they also were soundly defeated four times, twice against Mississippi State and twice against Louisiana Tech. 
Saturday's match against Campbell could prove to be a tough test for the Irish, as the Camels emerge from a solid performance in the Stanford University Classic in which they posted victories over Texas Tech, College of Charleston and North Dakota State. Their only losses came in two games against No. 7 Stanford, the first of which was a 2-1 loss. 
The Irish begin action at 
8:30 Friday morning at Buccaneer Field on the Charleston Southern Campus.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK-One year has made a remarkable dif­ference for Joe Alexander and West Virginia. 
Last March, Alexander didn't score a point as the Mountaineers beat Clemson in the NIT cham­pionship game. 
On Thursday, the 6-foot-8 junior forward scored a career-high 34 points on the same Madison Square Garden court as West Virginia beat No. 15 Connecticut, 78-72, in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. 
The fifth-seeded Mountaineers (25-7) will play top-seeded and ninth-ranked Georgetown in the semifinals Friday night. It will be West Virginia's sec­ond appearance in the tournament's final four as it lost in the 2005 champi­onship game. 
Alexander is averaging 
29.8 points over his last five games, a streak that start­ed with a then-career high 32 points in a 79-71 loss to Connecticut on March 1. He had 22 points in the Mountaineers' opening­round win over Providence. 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun found it hard to believe Alexander torched his team for the second time in less than two weeks. 
"Alexander is a terrific 
IN BRIEF LeBron, Gisele to appear
together on Vogue cover CLEVELAND -LeBron James is striking a pose. 
· The Cleveland Cavaliers' superstar will appear on the April cover of Vogue, joining actors Richard Gore and George Clooney as the only men to do so in the influential fashion magazine's 116-year history. 
Wearing a tank top, shorts and sneakers from his own Nike clothing line, James appears on the cover dribbling a basketball and scream­ing as if in game mode while throw­ing one arm around supermodel Gisele Bundchen with Tom Brady nowhere to be found. 
The James-Bundchen duo is one of several athlete-model pairings featured in the issue. Others include swimmer Michael Phelps with Caroline Trentini. snowboarder Shaun White with Daria Werbowy; and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno with Doutzen Kroes.

A.J. Price had 22 points for the Huskies (24-8), who have lost their last four games in the Big East tour­nament, a streak that start­ed with a loss in the semifi­nals in 2005. 
Alexander was 12-for-22 from the field and 1 0-for­12 from the free throw line as West Virginia led throughout the second half. The Mountaineers' biggest lead was 13 points, the last time at 61-48 with 9:18 left, and they held ofT a run that had the Huskies as close as 70-65 on a driving layup by Price with 2:02 to play. 
Butler had 17 points and nine rebounds to lead West Virginia's impressive show­ing on the boards. The Mountaineers finished with a 42-26 advantage, includ­ing 14-5 on the offensive end. 
"Some games are very

Miller._,,yonn on track for 
U.S. world Cup sweep 
BORMIO, Italy -Bode Miller clinched his second overall World Cup title, then promptly retreated behind the tinted windows of his personal bus. 
Lindsey Vonn was all smiles after moving so close to securing the women's crown that her only competi­tor still in the runriing conceded defeat. 
Miller and Vonn are on the verge of the first American sweep of the overall titles since Phil Mahre and Tamara McKinney did it 25 years ago. 
Miller was livid after Wednesday's downhill was canceled due to warm weather, handing the downhill title to Cuche with a five-point lead over Miller. 
Vonn finished second Thursday in the season's final Super-G behind Fabienne Suter of Switzerland, her best result in the disciplim~ all season. She holds a 197 -point lead over Maria Riesch of Gerrriany with two races remaining and 200 points at stakP. 
Billy: Crystal strikes out as 
Yankees leadoff hitter 
TAMPA, Fla. -Billy Crystal whacked himself in the helmet with his back­swing, found his shoelaces and socks sabotaged and watehed his team lose. 
Oh, and tl1e New York Yankees rook­ie struck out in his one and only at-bat as a big leaguer. 
A day before his 60th birthday, the comedian, actor and Oscar host enjoyed every moment of tl1e day he'd hoped for his entire life. 
Technically, Crystal still is under con­tract to the Yankees. He signed a stan­dard minor league deal Wednesday that commissioner Bud Selig approved; as long as the Yankees officially release him before opening day, tl1ey don't owe him any money. 
Crystal got this opportunity after a chance meeting with Jeter in Costa Rica over the holidays. Crystal said he wasn't too happy about turning 60, and the Yankees captain wondered what would make him happy.

Championships, 

the Irish divers claimed five of the top eight spots in the 1-meter board. Bulfin took second place, while Lex took third. Stoner finished second in the 3­meter board, and Bulfin took third place. 
Stoner and the rest of the divers are exhibiting a sig­nificant amount of confi­dence heading into the weekend. 
"The top eighteen finish­ers in prelims advance to the finals, and everyone is

capable and hoping to accomplish this," Stoner said. "We have worked hard all year for this. Everyone is confident about their dives. We are just going to go out there, relax and go big." 
The Irish have proved successful in previous years at the NCAA Zone C meet. In 2007, Stoner claimed the seventh spot on the 1-meter board. Bulfin came in one spot behind him, and also took fifth place in the 3­meter board. As a freshman in 2006, Bulfin advanced to the NCAA Championship and claimed a remarkable top-20 finish in the 3-meter. Bulfin's 2008 regular sea­son was full of highlights that showcased his talent and potential. On January 18th, he set a Notre Dame record on the 3-meter dive. That record lasted less than 24 hours, however, as Bulfin turned around and broke his own record the next day. 
The Irish men will com­mence diving today at 1 p.m with the 3-meter board. The 1-meter board competition will take place Saturday at 1 p.m, with the platform diving competition will be held Sunday at 11.

MLB 
Man set to auction off Bonds' record HR ball 
Associated Press 
DENVER -After snaring the 
baseball Barry Bonds hit for. 
career homer No. 762, Jameson 
Sutton stored it in the safest 
place he could think of -deep 
inside his closet. 
"I didn't tell anyone," he said. 
The 24-year-old from Boulder 
quickly moved the baseball into 
a safety deposit box after the 
season was llnished. realizing 
its potential worth. And with 
Bonds still looking for a place to 
play this season, Sutton decided 
to come forward with the ball. 
Sutton has hired SCP Auctions 
to run an online auction that 
starts March 31 and could fetch 
as much as $1 million. 
"I thought it would be cool to 
give it to my grandkids, but it's 
too important of a ball for me to 
have it in my house laying 
around," Sutton said Thursday. 
Sutton grabbed Bonds' final 
homer of last season on Sept. 5 
at Coors Field when he extend­
ed his arm· over the fence. He 
thought he had it cleanly and 
then was crunched by two other 
fans. 
"I did what was a weird splits, 
and saw the ball rolling in front 
of me," he said. 
Sutton already had a batting­.practice baseball in his hand that he was given by a member of the Hockies' maintenance crew before the game. He let go of that one and snatched the home run ball. 
Robert Harmon, who was tak­ing pictures at the time and was close to Sutton, saw a ball rolling and quiekly scooped it up. Turns out, he grabbed the batting practice ball. 
"When I went back to my seat, l got a phone call from a friend who thought I had the ball," Harmon said. "This kid camp, up and said, 'My friend got the baseball.' I was like, 'No, I've got it.' l looked at it and was like, 'Oh (expletive).' I've seen enough baseballs to know what a game ball is and what a practice ball is. He's got the ball. I've got a nice sou­venir." 
Harmon isn't bitter about los­ing the pricey baseball to Sutton. Being a partial season ticket holder, Harmon has got­ten to know Sutton's mom and dad, David and Debbie, who've been ticket holders since the team's inception. 
Harmon knows how much the ball can help the family. David Sutton is back in the hospital as he battles cancer. 
"For them, it's a fairy tale come true," Harmon said.

Irish earn win over Illini 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Beginning a two-game home stand with a match against lllinois Thursday, No. 23 Notre Dame used clutch performances from its doubles teams to build an early lead and cruise to vic­tory. 
Today, the Irish face Western Michigan in an attempt to claim their 1Oth win of the season and sweep the pair of home match­es before embarking on a two­match road trip. The first serve is set for 4 p.m. at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Against the Illini, Notre Dame stuck to what has worked so far this season -dominating of the doubles point. Although Illinois didn't go quietly, the Irish even­tually took all three of the dou­bles matches, securing the point. 
The No. 3 tandem of sopho­mores Cosmina Ciobanu and Colleen Rielley improved to 10­1 on the year with their 8-5 vic­tory to begin the match. And after freshman Kristen Rafael and sophomorH Kali Krisik cap­tured the second match to secure the point, the No. 1 duo in the nation was on display. 
Senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft won their second match as the nationally top­ranked pair with their 8-6 win over the Illini. Notre Dame took the 1-0 lead heading into sin­gles play, but never looked back. allowing Illinois to only pick up one single point along the way. 

Irish head coach Jay Louderback was impressed with his squad's play against Illinois, specifically their singles play. 
"It was good to start the home stand off with a win," Louderback said. "We came out a little slow in doubles, but stepped it up and won all three matches. But our singles play impressed me the most. We came out strong after our dou­bles and took five out of a possi­ble six." 
Junior Katie Potts quickly dis­posed of her opponent, winning 6-4, 6-0, improving her mark to 14-8 overall on the season. 
Notre Dame came out firing on all cylinders in the rest of the singles matches winning all six first sets. 
After the Potts victory, Ciobanu, Krisk, Tefft and Buck all won their matches to secure the Irish victory. 
With the win, Notre Dame improved to 5-1 at home this season, and· Louderback can sense the excitement in his players over the home success. 
"They love playing here," he said. "Last season it seemed like we barely had any home games so these little home stands are nice. After the Broncos we go away for a couple of games but then we're back for a big por­tion of the rest of March so we're looking forward to com­peting at home." 
Although the Irish are coming off of an emotional and chal­lenging match against Illinois, Louderback doesn't feel as though fatigue will be a factor against Western Michigan. 
"I don't think it will be a fac­tor at all," he said. "We've been playing tough matches all year, and we prepared for stretches like this in the fall so our play­ers will be ready." 
Looking ahead to the Broncos, the one player that sticks out is junior Kerstin Pahl, who is com­ing off of a solid week, in which she won Mid-American Conference Player of the Week. She joined senior Noriko Saruta as the second Western Michigan player to win the award all sea­son. 
"They always play really good doubles," Louderback said of the Broncos. ''I'm expecting a match a lot like Illinois, in which they came out strong so we have to be ready for them. They're really well coached so you know they're going to be prepared for us. 
"They actually beat Illinois 4­3 earlier in the year so it's going to be interesting to watch them come in here and play us. We're just going to have to be ready for them when they come out firing."

Junior Calli Davison pitches in last season's matchup against Albion. Davison will start the first game Saturday for the Belles. 
By LAURA MYERS Sports Writer 
The Belles scheduled double­header against Manchester at home Thursday was postponed due to poor field conditions. 
This was the second time the game has been postponed. It was originally to be played on March 11, but was moved to Thursday. So far, no make-up date has been set. 
The Belles (8-2) will now begin their home season with a double­header against Rockford on Saturday. 
Junior Calli Davison will start the first game Saturday for the Belles. Davison '(5-2) has given up three earned runs in five starts this season-all wins. 
"[Calli's] confidence shows on the mound," head coach Erin Sullivan said. "Our team has stepped up their defense behind her." 
Senior McKenna Corrigan (3-0) will start the second game of the double-header. 
Sophomores Ashley Peterson and Maureen Healy, junior Ashley Fusaro, Davison and Corrigan will lead the offense, which has over­powered nearly every team the Belles played in Florida during spring break. 
Rockford also played at Ft. Myers, Fla., over spring break. However, Saint Mary's and Rockford did not meet.

necessarily changing what we 
do too much, but just tweaking 
it a little bit so we ean be a little 
bit more eiTective." 
The Irish offense has strug­gled to find consistent scorers in the second half of the season, failing to put home more than three goals in a game since 6-1 and 4-1 victories at Bowling Green on Jan. 25-26. 
That fact, along with the Bulldogs' propensity to keep several skaters deep in its own defensive zone, look to con­tribute to what might be a low­scoring weekend -a style that just might serve the Irish well, coach Jell' Jackson said. 
"It'll be a dillieult series·, and I'd be surprised if there's big scorers, but anything's possi­ble," said Jackson. who holds an ineredible 28-4 career record in CCIIA tournament games. "They're one of the bet­ter ddensivc teams, and their goalie's one of the top goalies ­hut you know what. so is ours." 
A change, at least from the way hn played tiH~ last time these two teams met, is just what Irish goalie Jordan Pearce is looking for. The junior holds a conference-best 1.80 goals­against averagP in CCIIA gamos, but he'll need to avenge Feb. 8's rare poor performance in which ho gave up a season­worst live goals. 
"There were a couple times lin that game when] Ferris SJlllek into some spots that guys fell asleep in, and tlwy were able to gennratn sonw good shots." Pearce said. "They love just throwing tlw puck at the net from any angle in any situa­tion to crash the net and get 
n~bounds." 
Notrn Dame hasn't played in nearly two weeks, knocking off CCIIA bottom-feeder Western Michigan 3-1 in its last action on March l, so the Irish will look to shake the cobwebs quickly and get off to a fast start against the Bulldogs, who swnpt those samn Broncos in two games last weekend. 
"It's not if you get off to a slow start, battle back; you've got to come out right away fly­ing bn<:ause basically we nither put it together this weekend or we're done," Van Guilder said. " ... It's about setting the tone on the ice; we've bJ~en preach­ing all along in the locker room. espeeially in the second half Jof the season!. but what guys real­ly see is when guys do what we've been talking abnut." 
Jackson agreed that scoring first will be a major objective. But that, he said, is no different from any other game. 
"Hegardless of if you get the first goal, you get the lead, or whatever, you're going to have to play three good periods of hockey," Jackson said. "Either team is eapable of coming from 
behind, but it's good to get that 
lead. though. It always is." 
More crucial to the Irish 
attack will be the way it plays 
throughout the game, not just 
in the first few minutes. 
"We have to be efficient on 
special teams, we have to make 
sure that we're solid otT of face­
offs, and we have to make sure 
that we can get more pucks 
through to the net," Jackson 
said. "Those are probably the 
biggest issues, and some of 
those things you can work on, 
but you've got to understand 
that that's how Ferris plays." 
Though the immediate focus is solely on the Bulldogs, Notre Dame knows it must play itself back into NCAA Tournament consideration after its 6-8-4 performance since Christmas. Over the same stretch the Irish have fallen from No. 6 to No. 12 in the polls, leaving its plaee in the 16-team NCAA field very much in doubt. 
In fact, USCIIO.com's March 11 edition of "Bracketology" left Notre Dame out of the Tournament -though the Irish are "on the cusp," analyst Jason Moy wrote in the artide. 
That could change with a sue­eessful trip to Detroit, but Notre Dame must first take care of the Bulldogs as the seniors bid farewell to the Joyce Center ­but hopefully not Irish hockey altogether. 

"It's going to be tough [leav­ing! just because of the progress we've made in this building, from where we came to what it is now," Van Guilder said. "We have a lot of pride in what we've lwlped build here, and its going to be tough skat­ing ofT for the last time. But as long as were doing it with a win, I think I'll be just line." 
Notes 
+Sophomore defenseman Kyle Lawson was the lone Irish player to receive all-CCHA recognition as he earned an Honorable Mention earlier this week. Lawson has three goals and 16 assists this season and is considered one of the confer­ence's top defenders. 
+Van Guilder is now Notre Dame's all-time "Iron Man", as he has now played in a school­record 154 consecutive games. lie has played in every game of his Irish hoekey career and is closing in on Dan Carlson's (1997 -2001) all-time record of 158 games played. 
+The CCIIA tournament's other quarterfinal series fea­ture No. 1 Michigan and Nebraska-Omaha, No. 4 Miami (Ohio) and Bowling Green, and No. 6 Michigan State and Northern Michigan. The four quarterfinal winners will travel to Joe Louis Arena in Detroit next weekend. Both the semifi­nals (Friday) and finals (Saturday) are single-game match-ups.

Maurice Acker provided the dagger that killed Notre Dame's hope of reaching the semifinals, nailing two straight 3-pointers to give his team a 76-66 lead. 
"It is frustrating," said Irish guard Kyle McAlarney, who led the team with 20 points. "At that point, it kinda looks like they're throwing in every­thing.... Hats off to them; they're a great team." 
The Irish built a 44-36 lead early in the second half but Marquette came back with a vengeance as guard Jerel McNeal scored 10 points dur­ing a 14-6 Golden Eagles run. 
The day after he dropped 21 points in a win over Seton Hall, McNeal poured in a career-high 28 points Thursday. 
"McNeal was fabulous," Brey said. "And he's been fab­ulous these two nights in New York." 
After McNeal's hot streak erased the Irish lead, Marquette manufactured a sizable edge of its own, pulling ahead 66-57 with 7:42 remaining in the contest. 
With the Golden Eagles lead­ing 59-57, Marquette guard Dominic James hit a pullup jumper. After the Irish came up empty on their next posses­sion, James drilled a 3-pointer to give the Golden Eagles a 64­57 lead. 

Acker then hit a long jumper 
from  the  wing  to  give  
Marquette  the  nine- point  
edge.  

"They got on a roll hitting some jump shots in the second half," Brey said. "When they make jump shots like that-a bunch in a row -it kinda broke our back a little bit." 
Brey said the difference in the game was Notre Dame's inability to stop the Marquette attack. 
"I thought offensively we played well enough to win the game but we never got them unchlr control at the defensive end of the floor," Brey said. · 
Notre Dame took control early in the game as four Irish players got on the scoreboard in the first five minutes for a 12-6 lead. 
Marquette responded with a 9-2 run to take a 15-14 edge, culminating in a Dwight Burke transition layup. 
Notre Dame regained the lead o_n a pull-up jumper by junior forward Zach Hillesland with 11:21 left in the first half. The Irish were able to put more distance between them­selves and Marquette even though forward Luke Harangody was forced to sit for the remainder of the half after picking up his second foul with 10:35 left. 
Luke Zeller hit a 3-pointer from the wing to give the Irish a 23-22 lead with 8:11 to play in the period. McAlarney then converted on a runner in the lane and senior forward Rob Kurz knocked down a baseline jumper to gave Notre Dame a 27-22 lead. 
Marq~wtte cut the Irish lead to 31-30 but NO had a 7-2 spurt to end the half with a 38-32 lead. After Marquette guard Wesley Matthews con­verted a breakaway dunk, Rob Kurz nailed a 3-pointer with three seconds left in the half to give the Irish a six-point cushion. 
Harangody finished with 13 points and five minutes in just 25 minutes of playing time. 
Brey said the pain from the loss is eased by the fact that the Irish will likely receive an NCAA Tournament bid this Sunday. 
"I told [the plfiyers] we're excited we get to play next week," Brey said. " ... There are some things that we can work on before we go into the NCAA Tournament."

for the Irish. Sophomore Gina Scioscia picked up five assists, tallying five points for the sec­ond straight game and setting a school-record for most assists in a home game. 
Byers, who has scored at least three goals in each game this season, now leads the nation in both goals (33) and points (38) -and she's not done yet, Coyne said. 
"She's worked really hard on stick skills, placement, shot selection, release point, variety -every single aspect that makes her the finisher she is," Coyne said of Byers, a presea­son All-American. "It hasn't been by accident because she's put a lot of time and energy into it, and she's still getting better. What you've seen from her is phenomenal and she's having a great season, but there's still areas of her game she can work on, and she's not satisfied." 
Most encouraging about Notre Dame's last two victories, though, has been the emer­gence of new contributors, such as Ferguson, Sciosia and junior Jane Stoeckert, who had four goals and an assist in an 18-8 Irish win over California on March 8. 
"In order for us to win, we need multiple people to step up. McKinney and Byers are great players, but we can't just win on the back of one person," Coyne said. "We're getting real­ly balanced scoring, and it's really difficult to stop a team that has multiple weapons. That's what's exciting about the Cal game and today: we're hav­ing other people find their place and get more comfortable in their role." 
The Irish fired a season-high 42 shots and dominated the turnover battle by a 13-4 mar­gin, continuing the tempo-con­trol style of play that has been instrumental in winning their last two games. 
"The response we showed [heading into the California game with consecutive losses] carried over until today," Coyne said. "We came out doing what I said to them in the pre-game: [showing] unparalleled intensity and that attitude of going out, making plays and putting our­selves in a position to win." 
Notre Dame opens Big East play against No. 6 Syracuse on Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Loftus Center. Syracuse won last year's meeting, outscoring the Irish 4­0 in the final 18 minutes for a 16-13 victory.

NO WOMEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING 
Divers allnto qualify for NCAA Championships 
By JARED JEDICK Sports Writer 
The Irish will attempt to earn a spot in the NCAA Diving Championship this weekend as they participate in the NCAA Zone C Diving meet. The Irish will send three divers to the meet, includ­ing senior Tara Hyer, sophomore Natalie Stitt, and freshman Heidi Grossman. 
The girls will be going against an impressive field of 90 divers from 24 schools across the Midwest at Ohio State's McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion in Columbus, Ohio. The Zone C meet is one of five across the country where divers will be able to compete to earn a spot at the 2008 NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships held on March 20 to 22, again at the McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion. 
"I believe our women will have a good chance of making the NCAA Championships," head div­ing coach Caiming Xie said. "They its twelfth consecutive Women's Swimming and Diving Big East title in New York Feb. 20-23. 

Stitt took first place in the 3­meter event and third in the 1­meter event at the Big East Championship. This will be Stitt's second consecutive trip to the NCAA Zone C meet, as she took 17th off the 1-meter board in last year's meet. 
"Natalie [Stitt] is strong," Xie said. "She should have won the 1­meter and the 3-meter at the Big East. She probably has the best chance of qualifying for the NCAA Championships." 
Hyer claimed third place in the 3-meter event and fifth in the 1­meter event in the Big East Championship. 
Grossman finished fifth off the 3-meter board and eighth off the 1-meter board in the Big East Championship. 
The rest of the team that quali­fied for the NCAA Championships will be back in action on March 20th when the final weekend of the season begins.

Irish ready for Big Green 
No. 7 squad looks to avenge last year's loss against Darthmouth 
By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 

Coming off a narrow first loss to No. 4 North Carolina last Saturday, the No. 7 Irish will head to Atlanta, Ga. to face 
'Dartmouth. 
With a 4-1 start on the sea­son, Notre Dame will face the Big Green for the seventh time in the team's histo­ry. The Irish cur­rently hold a 4-2 edge in the series. 
Despite Notre 
Dame's two-game series lead, each meeting has been closely contested. In fact, four of the seven games have been decided by one goal. Last season, the Big Green edged out the Irish 7-6. 
The Irish have had early suc­cess this season, marking just come easily, causing the Irish to drop in the ranks from the No. 5 to the No. 7 team. 

"We were disappointed because there were things we could have done to change the outcome of the game," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "We

didn't get those things done and North Carolina's goalie had an outstanding day." 
The Irish are lead by anum­ber of upper­classman. Junior attack Ryan Hoff is 

first on the team with thirteen goals and 14 total points, while junior attack Duncan Swezey has already tallied a career high of 10 goals this season. Senior attack Alex Wharton holds the team lead in assists 
(8) in addition to his five goals. The Irish currently average 
The tough defense is largely attributed to goalie Joey Kemp. The 5-foot-11 senior, who is a two-time all American honoree, has made 56 saves on the sea­son, and has guarded the goal for 289.33 of 300 possible min­utes of play. He was also recently named to the 51-man watch list for the Tewaaraton award, which is presented annually to the nation's top player. 
The Big Green are coming off a 7-4 victory against Vermont. With a 2-1 record,-Dartmouth is lead by sophomore attack Ari Sussan, who has eight goals and two assists on the season. 
"[Dartmouth] is probably the most deliberate and disciplined team we'll play this season," Corrigan said. "They're very structured in the way they play offense and that's not the way we play because we don't see it on a daily basis." 

-
The game will kick off at 2 
p.m. this Sunday at the Lovett School in Atlanta.

Notre Dame has a lot of potential for the NCMs. As a four or live seed, their lirst round opponent won't be near­ly as athletic as Marquette. Corning in with a chip on their shoulder. the Irish should win.

Notre Dame coach Dave Schrage said lw is looking for more stability both at bat and on the mound over the weekend. 
"The frustration comns when we can't play eonsistent baseball and see results on eonsecutive days," Schrage said. 
Phelps has struggled to find consistency on the mound this season. The righty had a rough start in the season-opening loss to Liberty, but reeovered with seven shutout innings in his next start against Mount St. Mary's on March 1. Phelps, who posted a l.SS ERA last season, is 1-2 with a 5.09 ERA after four starts.

It's all about work ethic with senior captain Pat Hyan, who finds almost nothing more rewarding than the time he's put into Bengal Bouts over the past four years building rela­tionships, imparting his knowl­edge on others and helping those in need. 
"I have so much fun doing this," Hyan said. "I love going to work every day, working hard, and there is nothing I would rather be doing." 
Especially important to Hyan are thn relationships he has formed with those who have accompanied him along the way. 
"An amazing thing is just the team camaraderie aspect of it all." Hyan said. "You get used to being around these guys everyday, and you form some pretty strong friendships." 
Ever humble, Ryan never thought that he would be able to rise up through the ranks and become a Bengal Bouts captain. Fate stwmed to be on Hyan's side, however, as his 

... older brother, Peter Ryan, was a four-time champion. 
"Watching my brother do all the stufl' he did for Bengal Bouts helped inspire me a little bit," Hyan said. "I got to see the whole thing, and I thought it was really cool." 

-
Also working in Hyan's favor was his extensive background in sports. Hyan was a three-

sport high school athlete, play­ing basketball, football and ten­nis. 
"My athletic nature really inclined me towards Bengal Bouts from the start," Hyan said. "I was used to being around athletic people, and I liked the friendships that I formed there." 
Nonetheless, when the call came from last year's captains that they wanted him to help lead the program, Hyan was in shock. 
"I never really considered being a captain, so I was sur­prised when they selected me," he said. "But if I had to give one reason why they selected me, I would have to say that it is my work ethic." 
It is a strong work ethic that has been with Hyan since the very beginning. 
"Going in, I had no idea what to expect," Ryan said. "But when I got there on day one, I said to myself, 'I can do this'." 
Since that day freshman year, Hyan has never skipped out on a practice. 
Hyan said the presence of his teammates inspires him day in and day out. 
"The great thing about Bengal Bouts is that it is such a seiness activity," Hyan said. "These kids come here because they are willing to work hard every day and develop a skill and form friendships. Plus, they get to really help the needy in Bangladesh." 
This year's captains have meshed well together, Ryan 
said. 
''I'm really proud of what we have been able to do this year as a group of captains," he said. "This is really a great group of guys." 
Transitioning from being just another one of the guys in the Bouts into being a captain and having the responsibility of teaching others wasn't easy for Hyan. 
"You just really need to break it down for them, and then drill it into them," Ryan said. 
Seeing those he has taught put their talents to good use in the ring is inspiring for Hyan. 
"It is weird seeing two guys in the ring and wanting them both to win because you have seen how hard both of them have worked," Ryan said. "Whoever wins, we just really love to see them do it." 
Another important aspect for Hyan is the difference he believes the Bouts are making for the impoverished of Bangladesh in conjunction with the Holy Cross missions. 
"What we do here will help them so much," Ryan said. "With the money we can raise, we can provide food and an education for so many. I believe we are really making a differ­ence, and hopefully with the program growing, we will be able to make an even greater difference in the future." 
Beyond Bangladesh, the Bouts makes a difference in the lives of all those who participate in it. It's that mission that Hyan wants others to remember. 
"I don't want to be the focus," Ryan said. "What I really want people to know is that we are trying to make a difference in people's lives."

By BILL B~INK Sports· Writer· 
In. sports where matches are decided bas~ld on weight, horror stories abound. Athletes use star­vation, running in place in the shower wrapped in plastic bags, obsessive workout techniques and dehydration to secure every com­petitive edge possible. 
With Bengal Bouts athletes, however, this doesn't seem to be the case. 
While boxers lay otT the pasta and take an extra lap around the JACC beforE:) weigh-ins, drastic cutting of weight is not common practice among boxers. 
Freshman Pat O'Brien, who fought in the 130-pound weight class, said he ate lighter foods, such as vegetables and egg-white omelets, and ni.n more to prepare for weigh-ins. He said he only had to drop around five pounds to get in the weight class he wanted and that the drop didn't affect his fights. 
"When I was cutting, I wasn't hungry. I was just physically exhausted," O'Brien said. "But it was only for a few days. It didn't affect me at all in the actual ring." 
Sophomore Bobby Hicks, who fought in the 189-pound weight class, didn't eat for a day and a half and increased his cardiovas­cular workouts the week before weigh-ins. 
Senior Ben O'Brien took a simi­lar approach. 
"As soon as we got back from break, I tried to eat healthier food," Ben O'Brien said. 

·The idea behind cutting weight, according to senior captain Pat O'Brien, is to gain a height advan­tage. Shorter fighters, he said, will try to cut weight to fight other boxers similar in height. But O'Brien said that cutting weight is harmful and discouraged by the captains and coaches. 
"We tell the novices, 'If you're trying to cut weight now !early in the season], it's not a bright idea,"' he said. "If you don't eat and drink, you won't be able to com­plete the first two or three weeks." 
He also said eating helps increase metabolism and will help boxers lose weight the natural way. 
Hunter Land, the president of the boxing chili, said the club does not condone cutting weight and that cutting weight may not give boxers the advantage they hope for. 
"Weight brackets are not deter­mined until after weigh-ins, so it doesn't make sense for boxers to shoot for that magic number because there is no magic num­ber," Land said. 
Junior Kris Perez said cutting weight does not provide an extra leg up. 
"I don't see any advantages in cutting weight," he said. "The real advantages come from good con­ditioning and perfecting boxing technique and form. The hard work in the gym is what pays off." 
Ben O'Brien said most of the boxers will work out before weighing in. 
"You can probably lose six pounds of water weight during a tough practice," he said. 
Despite the preponderance of moderation in regards to cutting weight, some people took more drastic measures. Senior Pat O'Brien said a fighter during his freshman year ate such small amounts at meals that he caused problems with his digestive tract. 
Sophomore Kevin Martin fol­lowed a similar pattern to other fighters, swearing off soda and desserts, but he also added harsh­er dietary restrictions. He ate no carbohydrates for four days prior to weigh-ins, he said, and lost 15 pounds of water. On the day of the weigh-in, he ate nothing. 
"If you stop eating carbs, your body naturally gets rid of water," Martin said. "It was awful, though -the most awful diet I've ever been on." 
Confidence in one's ability, sen­ior Pat O'Brien said, will help peo­ple keep from cutting weight. Insecurity, on the other hand, can cause a boxer to cut. 
"If the kids feel like they're not here to kill each other, they're here to learn how to box, they'll be less likely to cut weight," he said. "But if they're scared, they'll be more likely to cut weight." 
Some boxers, on the contrary, want to gain weight. Perez, who won the 140-pound weight class last year, is fighting in the 149­pound weight class thi<> year. 
"Basically, I just felt like moving up in weight class would be a good challenge and, because I'm a competitive guy, I wanted to see if I could still compete," Perez said. 
Even when gaining weight, health must still be observed, he said. 
"I didn't go to Burger King every day and order a bacon cheese­burger," Perez said. "I did a high protein and high carb diet which <;onsisted of pasta, chicken, egg whites and peanut butter. I ate lots ~f vegetables and fruits as well.
