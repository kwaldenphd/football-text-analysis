Fr. Reihle replied that the new D3 lot would not satisfy sophomore needs because the lot is now used by a large number of faculty members and this usage will increase when the new biology building is opened. As for putting a gravel surface behLnd the present C2 lot,· Rieule said this would amount to putting a gravel surface in the outfield of the baseball diamond. 
He explained that even if there were areas that could be surfaced with gravel it is too late to begin the project because the worst months for weather are beginning to arrive. There would be problems with mud and snow because the gravel would not be well packed and is difficult to plow when covered with snow. 
After further discussion stu­dent representative Tom Schoaf asked the committee to produce one proposal, hopefully before the semester's end, as to the feasibility of sophomore car privileges. The proposal was amended to include consultation with Fr. Burtchaell and Fr. Wilson.

Texas' close call tightens poll race 
(UPI) -Stanford has its bowl 

of roses but Texas' drive toward 
the Cotton Bowl and a national 
title met near disaster. 
The No. 5 Stanford Indians 

clinched their first trip to the 
Rose Bowl with a 29-22 victory 

over Washington Saturday that 
featured Jim Plunkett's four 
touchdown passes. 

Texas ranked No. I, is seeking a double slam as collegiate champion and the Southwest Conference Cotton Bowl repre­sentative this season. 
Third ranked ·Ohio State moved closer to a Rose Bowl bid by creaming Wisconsin 24-7 and No. 2 Notre Dame took a giant step toward a Cotton or Orange Bowl invitation with a 46-14 demolition job on Pittsburgh. 
Fourth ranked Nebraska, the Big Eight Conference's potential Orange Bowl entry, mauled Iowa State 54-29. 
Only one of the top I 0 ranked teams met defeat Satur­day -seventh rated AirForce, losing to Oregon 46-35. Sixth ranked Michigan beat Illinois 42-0. No. 8 Arkansas trampled Rice 38-14. No. 9 Auburn swamped Mississippi State 56-0 and tenth rated Tennessee edged South Carolina 20-18. 
Individual performances counting toward the Heisman Trophy were in evidence among 
the  nation's  All-America candi­ 
dates,  but  Mississippi's  bowl  
dreams  and  Archie  Manning's  

trophy ambitions were both chilled when the Ole Miss quarterback broke his left fore­arm during a 24-13 win over Houston. Manning threw two scoring strikes before his injury. 
Plunkett established his right to individual honors with the touchdown pass barrage for Stanford. The fourth TD toss overcame Washington's 22-21 lead in the final period and brought Stanford the Pacific Eight Conference title and the first trip to Pasadena in 19 years. 
Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann guided the Fighting Irish to their seventh straight win as he threw three TD passes 

Sports Shorts 
And now it's a two-man race for the Heisman Trophy. A race between Jim Plunkett, who fills the air with footballs at Stanford, and that wee lad, Joe Theismann, who quarterbacks the Fighting Irish. 
Early season contenders Jimmy Jones of USC, Rex Kern of Ohio State, and Archie Manning of Mississippi have fallen by the wayside. Jones' Trojan club has lost three games and tied another and he is, for this season, a torgotten man. Kern's Buckeyes are unbeaten but Rex isn't performing as well as had been expected. Manning, who received such a great pre-season buildup, largely lived up to his reputation but his broken arm, suffered last Saturday, will hamper his chances of receiving college football's top individual award. 
That leaves Plunkett and little Joe. 
Plunkett is probably the best passer in the college ranks this season. He has accounted for more total offensive yards than any other player in major college history. He should be the first quarterback selected in the professional football draft. Those are just a few of his most impressive credentials. 
But I'd like to do a little tub-thumping for Theismann. 
The Irish have had some great quarterbacks through the years. Paul Hornung, John Lujack, Angelo Bertelli, Ralph Guglielmi, John Huarte, and Terry Hanratty have starred at QB for Notre Dame. All were first team All-Americans at least once and four, Hornung, Lujack, Bertelli, and Huarte, won the Heisman Trophy. And Theismann is better than all of them. At least the record book says so. 
Last Saturday agajnst Pitt the South River Roadrunner displaced HanrattY as the all-time Notre Dame. leader in total offensive yards and moved· ahead of the immortal George Gipp in total performance yards. If Theismann can maintain his current season and career completion percentages he will set records in those categories. 
His three touchdown tosses against the Panthers boosted Joe s career total to 29, more than any other passer in Notre Dame history. Theismann needs but three more TD passes this season to set a single season record for touchdown passes. 
In addition to his outs.tanding statistics, Theismann ll..as earned praises for his proficiency as a quarterback from the coaches of Notre Dame and the seven clubs he and the Fighting Irish have demolished this season. 
Carl DePasqua of Pitt said, "He's the best I've seen in a long, long time and that takes in 17 years of coaching." · 
Rick Forzano of Navy -"Any great team like Notre Dame has to have one super player that makes it go. It's obvious that...Theismann is the man that does this." 
Mizzou coach Dan Devine claimed Theismann was "the best quarterback I've seen in a long time. He can throw from any position and he is a good leader." 
And Joe is a winner. Since taking over the quarterbacking chores from Hanratty in the next-to-last game of the '68 season Theismann has directed the Irish to a 16-2-2 record. 
At a luncheon in Chicago the week after Notre Dame"stvictory over the Missouri Tigers Theismann was quoted as saying, "It's a nice dream and what kid wouldn't want to win the Heisman Trophy? But right now I just want to win five more games for Notre Dame." 
He and his mates have won two of those five games and, now that they are ranked No. 1 in the country the pressure will really be on them to win their last Nl.ree games. But Theismann thrives on pressure and, at season's end, Moose Krause could very well add two trophies to the glittering cotl.ection in the Convo -the national championship trophy courtesy of Ara's Fighting Irish, and the Heisman Trophy, courtesy of Joe Theis mann. 
and ran up 381 yards in total offense. Theismann's perfor­mance gave him a varsity career total of 4,853 yards, a school . record that surpassed the marks of Terry Hanratty and the leg­
endary George Gipp. 
Texas compressed its scoring 

into three second period touch­
downs against Baylor with full­
back Steve Worster going over from the one twice and quarter­back Eddie Phillips scoring on a five yard keeper. 
Full back John Brockington scored all three Ohio State touchdowns on runs of II, 4 and 1 yard and Fred Schram booted a 23 yard field goal for Ohio State as the Buckeyes re­mained unbeaten and untied through seven games. State has an easy opponent in Purdue this Saturday and then meets tough Michigan in its Big Ten finale. 
In other top games Arizor;a State beat San Jose State 46-10; LSU topped Alabama 1~-9; San Diego State nipped Pacific 14-13; Dartmouth drubbed Columbia 55-0; and Toledo beat Northern Illinois 45-7. Tampa, the small college leader, defeated Southwest Louisiana 59-38. 


Ruggers raise record 
by J. W. Findling Observer Sportswriter 
The Notre Dame Rugby Club added another victory to its fine fall season by pasting John Carroll 20-1 I on Saturday morn­ing behind Stepan Center. It was a see-saw battle, and the Irish ruggers, who now have a 5-l season record, did not pull away until the second half. 
John Carroll, who were 6-1 coming into the game, opened quickly with a try and a conver­sion to secure a 5-0 lead. But Notre Dame wiped out the Blue Streak lead with two tries--one a blazing >40-yard dash by Herb Giorgio, the other a powerful run by Charley Blum. Both Irish conversions were missed, and a penalty . kick by John Carroll gave the Blue Streaks an apparent 8-6 halftime lead. Then little Bill Berry, who is certainly one of the finest halfbacks in the Midwest, exploded on a brilliant 30-yard run into the end zone. It was Berry's first score of the sea­son, and after Charley JBlum's conversion, the Irish led at half­time 11-8. 
In the second half John Carroll tied the game early with another penalty kick. The winn­ing Irish points came after a high kick by Blum. Tom Herlihy caught it and lateraled it to Berry. Berry tossed the ball to Giorgio who ran in for the try. Pete Hartney and Mark Rubinelli both added tries later in the half to complete the scoring. 
Once again the game was high­lighted by the fine defense and kicking of Jim Hagen barth. Phil Krause and John Zukaitis did a fine job of controlling the line­outs for the Irisli. 
The Notre Dame "B" team suffered their second loss in a real heartbreaker 8-6. The Blue Streaks scored a try just before the game ended for the victocy. The "B" team is now 4-2. 

The Irish ruggers play their last home game next Saturday morning behind Stepan against the Chicago Lyons Rugby Club. The Lyons team is considered as one of the three best in the Mid­west (along with the Irish). "8" game starts at 9:00am followed by the "A" game. It should be a great game. So, if you're giving up your ticket to the Georgia Tech game and you still want"to see some good hitting on Satur­day, the rugby game will sub­stitute nicely. It won't be on TV. 
Booters fop West. Illinois 
The Notre Dame soccer club turned in one of their best per­formances this season last Satur­day as they handed a highly touted Western Illinois team a 

5-3  setback  behind the  Stepan  
Center.  
The  Irish  hooters built up  a  

4-0 lead early in the third quarter of play but Western Illinois struck back for three tallies in the third stanza to keep the pressure on. The Irish did not fall apart, however, and Rick Coleman put the game out of reach of West. Illinois by head­ing in a 15 foot shot in the fourth quarter for Notre Dame's final goal. 
Hugh Schoemaker notched the game's first marker, left­footing a short shot into the lower right-hand corner of the net midway through the first quarter. 
Jack Goldkamp chipped a 25 yard shot into the net in the second quarter, kicking the ball just under the crossbar and over 


UP/Poll 
The results of Yesterdays poll of football coaches were a little close to say the least. Texas the defending champion and on-rushing Notre Dame have tied for the Number One position. Each posted 13 first place votes and a combined 310 points.

The Notre Dame hooters appeared to have the game wrapped up when they added two quick scores early in the third stanza and built up a 4-0 lead. Chris Hanlon took a pass from Mike Macken, who had a free kick, and drilled the ball into the net from short range for Notre Dame's third tally and G a ry Troy netted a short shot for the fourth marker. 
Western Illinois suddenly came alive, however, striking back for three goals~fore the end of the third quarter to cut the Irish lead to 4-3. 
Coleman's fourth qUarter goal provided the clincher for Notre Dame however. 

The Irish hooters now boast a 54-2 record this year. They are in action again· this weekend. traveling to Washington U. in St. Louis for a Sunday encounter. 
Archie is hospitalized 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (UPI) ­Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning was admitted to the Campbell Clinic section of Bap­tist Hospital Sunday in prepara­tion for surgery on his broken left arm which apparently has ended his collegiate football career. 
Manning, accompanred by his mother and fiancee, was checked quietly into the hospital and placed in an eighth floor room to await surgery planned for this morning. 
Manning said doctors had assured him his injured arm would be as "good as new" after surgery. 
Obviously downhearted he said he would help Ole Miss in any way he could from the. side­lines for the rest of the season. 
The red-haird senior broke the arin in the third period ·of the Houston-Mississippi game Satur­day as he was trying to pass. Earlier, he. had thrown two t<Jlchdown passes to start the R)bels on a 24-13 vi.ct~y over the Cougars. 
"Archie said 'Coach I've hurt my arm. I can't stay in'" interim Coach Frank Kinard said. 
Two hours later X·rays at Lafayette County Hospital showed a fracture of the radius, the large bone in the left fore­arm just above the wrist. 
It was an abrupt halt to a spectacular three year college football career that .many believed would culminate this season in a Southeastern Confer­ence championship for the Rebels, a 14th consecutive major bowl appearance, and the Heis­man Trophy for Manning. 
Dillon, Keenan reach ployoHs 
Interhall football playoffs will begin Sunday with Keenan meet­ing Breen-Philips at l: 30 for the North Quad championship, and Dillon ·facing Morrissey at 2:45 for South Quad honors. 
Dillon eked out aJil 8-6 victory over Alumni Sunday to win their division title. Alumni was stopped on the one yard line on the final play of · the game, following a pass interference play that began on the Dillon eight yard line. The ball was placed on the one, abut Dillon held and preserved tHeir victory. Dillon had scored on a three yard run and made a two point conversion on a broken play. Alumni scored on a 10 yard pass that was dipp"ed by a Dillon defender. 
In a rugged defensive battle, Keenan edged Grace 6-0 and won. their conference title.

The impact of communica· tions on the future will be "over­whelming" said Clarke. Just as the railroad and the telegraph made possible the United States of the past, so now will the jet plane and communication satel­lites make ready the future. 
This universal .communication system may bring about the use of only one language. Clarke rna de the analogy of the communication satellites with the ill-fated tower of Babel of biblical times. Of course this system would bring about many problems of time, said Clarke, but we would have to sychronize our watches the world over so everyone would ~et up and go to 
work at the same time. Since some people would get the raw end of the deal two possibilities were hypothesized by Clarke. T~ey were: (I) to abolish 
Thefts and assaults reported

A large number of violations were reported to campus securi­ty this weekend. None were very serious, but many fell into the increasingly recurrent pattern of weekend vandalism. 
There were smaller thefts -a jacket and a car license plate; vending machine vandalism -a cigarette machine in St. Ed's and

Ano'ther major point of importance with this machine, said Clarke, is that man would never have to leave home to go to work. Variations of this device could permit even a brain surgeon perform an operation at home on a patient somewhere across the nation wi!h accurate remote control arms, lOaid Clarke. 
Another effect would be the death of the city. To be sure, said Clarke, by the year 200 l we will have larger cities but like the dinosaur of prehistoric times they will cease to exist and all that will remain are the steel and brick skeletons of a past era. 
Clarke said that it would take 
a candy machine in the engineer· ing building; and larger thefts ­a sofa from the second floor of the South Dining Hall and five wallets stolen from members of a visiting soccer team. Two groups of ND students were ap­prehended for stealing barricades and signs from nearby campuses and apartments. Three false fire alarms occurred on Saturday: in Holy Cross, O'Shaugnessy and 
Flanner Halls. 

There were also incidents of a malicious nature. A security force car was sprayed with material from a fire extinguisher out of Morrissey Hall or one of its neighbors, and acid reactions caused some damage to the paint job. Black paint was found sprayed on sidewalks near the

In addition, there was another incidence of personal assault re­ported to the security office. Two students were attacked near Alumni Hall Saturday night. The two assailants fled when other students came to the aid of the victims. 
Reports of a bombin.,; at the ROTC building proved false. Campus Security Chief Arthur Pears declared definitely, "There was no bombing attempt at the ROTC." Enquiries at ROTC headquarters brought a similar 
response·. 

a long time to reach stability once these changes are enacted. We will have robots for slaves and they will operate in ways as diverse as washing machines or miniature H.A.L. computers of 2001 fame. We will eliminate 99% of all human activity and will have universal leisure with no un-employ,uent. 
The greatest industry in the world will br education, said Clarke, and second to that will he entertainment. "Only the educated will survive because the uneducated will die of bore­dom," concluded Clark. 
With the conclusion of his speech, Clarke left Washington Hall and spoke with students and faculty in the Rathskellar of the LaFortune Student Center. This was the first in a series of lectures sponsored by the Arthur 
J. Schmit Foundation of Chicago.
