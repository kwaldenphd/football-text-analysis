Saint Mary's Ediwr 
Escorted by minivans bursting with dorm essentials. 438 first-year students 
arrived on campus Thursday ready to construct their lofts and their futures. 
The first-year students will also be constructing the future of the College as the largest class to be admitted since 1989. Like several women's colleges nationwide, Saint Mary's experienced a boost in admissions because of an increased popularity in women ·s col­leges this fall. The incoming class is the largest class to be admitted in recent history at the College, according to Mary Pat Nolan. director of Admissions. 
"Women's colleges, on the whole, are

Carting boxes, suitcases and pieces of furniture, the class of 2004 moved into Notre Dame·s residence halls this week. Along with their personal belongings, these students brought impressive resumes to the University. 
The class of 2004 has a mean SAT score of 1341 and mean ACT score of 30. The average student gradu­ated in the top 6 percent of his or her high school class. 
Academics are not the only area in which these students excelled during their years in high school. Seventy-two percent let­tered in at least one varsity sport, while another 37 per­cent captained at least one sports team. Forty-four per­cent were involved in art, dance, music or drama. Six percent were student body or senior class presidents and 12 percent were editors of their high school's stu­dent newspaper. An impres­sive 88 percent were involved in community ser­vice. 
Members of the class of 2004 come from all 50 states, with the largest por­tion -40 percent -com­ing from the midwest. Ethnic minorities are 1 7

Freshmen to participate in first ever 'Domer Fest' 
By ERIN LaRUFFA Assistant News Editor 
In past years, freshmen in white T-shirts carrying magic markers flocked to Stepan Center on the Saturday night of Freshman Orientation. 
This year, however, no mark­ers are allowed, The traditional Graffiti Dance has been trans­formed into the Domer Fest. 
"We've changed the ice-break­ing activity, but there's still a dance," said Peggy Hnatusko, assistant director of programs for the Office of Student Activities. 
At the Graffiti Dance, first-year students wore ,vhite T-shirts and \-Wote their names and telephone numbers on the shirts of other freshmen, priinarily those of the opposite sex. Few students actu­ally danced. 
At the new event, freshmen will receive booklets to obtain signatures for a contest to see who can get the most vdthin a certain time period. Organizers have also planned door prizes and a Notre Dame trivia contest. A better sound system and a video screen will improve the quality of the dance itself, said 
"We had received numerous\ complaints about the Graffiti Dance." 
David Moss Notre Dame assistant vice president of Student Affairs 
Hnatusko. 
For students who do not want to dance or participate in ice­breakers, there will be alterna­tive activities such as carnival­style games. All of the activities, which take place in beginning at 10 p.m. Saturday in Stepan Center, are free of charge. 

There were several reasons administrators canceled the Graffiti Dance. Some students expressed concern that men and women were being put on dis­play. Others felt that having peo­ple sign their shirts was a form of sexual harassment, and females in particular felt that males were signing their shirts in inappropriate places. 
Student<; also complained that some freshmen used what Hnatusko called "a double stan­dard of markers,n asking people they liked to sign in one color marker and people they did not like to sign in a different color. Other students were writing fake names or phone numbers on other people's shirts. In addition, some freshmen felt excluded because of their physical appear­ance. 
"We had received numerous complaints about the Graffiti Dance. From the feedback we received from students, [we real­ized] there wasn't good relation­ship-building there," said David Moss, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

When I stcppncl on to campus two years ago, 

I only had two questions I wantnd answnred: IJ \'Vlwn and wlrnre do we get /'oothall tick­ets? 
2) Why dons it smell like baking bread all tho timn? 
Throughout my freshman orif'ntalion, I knpt asking tlwse samn t.wo questions all the time but no one had a good answnr for nm. So as a st'rvic!~ to all thos1i frnshnwn who hav!i tlrn sanw two f!Ll!'stions that I did. I will try to answer 


them. 
Fvery student is entillPd Mike Connolly to one packnt of' season tkk1its for tlw football sea­

If you want to know what Plhanol is. go ask a clrnm­istry profossor.

In addition to increased divnrsity, the r.lass of 2004 has strong academic numbors and involvnment in many extra-r.urricular activities. This class stands out in thoir r.ommitment to service, according to Nolan. 
''A common thread in this class is community service," she said. "They am involved in the J\merican Cancer Society Helay for Life and Ilabitat for llumanity projects. They're working in homeless shelters and visiting the convales­r.enl." 
Nolan sees thes,~ studP.nts continuing that commitment to service in their college years.

Evnryonc will also want to know your nanw. dorm, honrn-town and major. Now, you should know tht· first thrcc1 of tlrnsc prl'tty dciinitivdy. lf'you don't, you should probably start worrying. 
llownvnr. you probably aren't sum of' your major. This is linP. Wlwnc,vcr vou talk LO a non-student, such as a prol'!'ss1Jr or paren.t. you should lie and make• up a major. OtlwrwisP you am likely to get 9,534,873 kind­lwartPd l(•rtu rPs a.bout how it is really okay not to be sum about yotll' major and how you have plenty of LimP So prPtPnd you know your major. When you linally ligur<\ it out. you can just pretnnd that you am "changing" your major. Sinc:n you will really do that l'ivr• or six timns in tlrn nnxt four yc\ars. no one will kno,v tlw dilfornncn. 
Now. SllllH' of' you will be homesick. II' you ..n'. a honwsid; pr•rson. [here will be times wlwn yo11 will look at th,~ ncx! year and think that it is going to last l'orc•wr. And it will. It will also last approximawly a week and a half While you are living through it, some­times the year seems to take forever. But at the end of the year, you will look back and think, "That was a nice couple of weeks," and probably refuse to believe that it was actually an entire school year. 
But I jump ahead of myself. Many things will happen before the end of the year that l should share insight about. Perhaps most importantly. there will be the football games which you have to go to. Sometimes on football weekends, you almost get the feeling that God Himself will be annoyed at you if you don't go to the game. and that it may affer,t your chances of getting inlo Heaven. Which it may. I suspect Hr. is a pretty ha.rd-r,ore l\iotre Dame fan. 
However. the nrnl reason you have to go to the football games is because whennvr,r you leave South ncnd and peoplP find out you go to Notre Dame. they will 
expect a thrr.e-to-f'ivA minute oral report on the f'ootball season. 
ttThis should inrludc a th<'ory on why thr, season went the way it did, infor­mation on one-to-three players that you particular­ly liked. and at least one per­sonal story about a game. So start thinking about this soon -October break is only two months away. 
There arc also a lot of' parties around here. When you ramr to visit r,ampus la.st year {or thrAe years ago, ii' your parents knew even then where you would be goingl. the tour guide probably attempted to reassure your parents that Notre Damp wasn't really a big drinking school. Well, the tour guide lied. You will most crrtainly not be deprived of that aspect of the col­
!ege experience. Even the state schools have nothing on us when it comes to parties, except possibly sheer frequency. (Some nights we have to study.I 
We also have those wonderful rules called parietals. No insightful Freshman Orientation column would be complete without something about those. Parietals are the administration's way of keeping Notre Dame guys, who, as we all know, become rapists and murderers at 
12:00 a..m. on weekdays and 2:00 a.m. on weekends, away from the poor defenseless little girls. Really, parietals are the administration's attempt to make themselves and our parents believe they are doing something strong to stop sexual activity on campus. Despitp, their ineffectiveness on that front. the adminis­tration certainly does mean what they say about parietals. and it is best not to get caught brnaking 
them. A lengthy meeting with HesLife a.bout the 
rest of your four years of college is not tlH~ best way to start your freshman vear. 
Let's seP. What else is thern around hArn? Oh. yes. Between foot­ball games, parties, parietals, and wclcom­ing sessions. you will artually be asked to attend classes. Which vou should certainly do. After all, whcrn you call home you can't really tell your parnnt.s about the par­
ties. so you'll need some classes to discuss. 
I'll hand out one last insight before I stop, and it is simply this. Don't worry. Notre Dame is a good placP to be. You'll have fun. I promise.

THE 
BSERVER 
Like any other incoming college freshman, I unpacked nol only dorm supplies on my first day ol' college. Alongside my boxes. I delicately unpacked foar, high school memories and jit­tery expectations for the future. 
My mom graduated from Saint Mary's in 1976; my dad from l\otre Dame that same year. Following thnir gradu­ation. we would have six other family members grad­uate from both in.stitutions. From the time I was five I received Saint Mary's T­shirts as Christmas girts and became accustomed to . my dad saying llait Marys in front of tclevisPd football games on Saturday al'tnr­noons. NePdless to say, my collnge destiny had me mapped straight for South Bend, Ind. I had certainly heard nnough about this storied place to ease any uncomfortable feeling that may have settled in the pit of my stomach, but regardless of any legacies. the buttPrnies remained. 
Perhaps it was the legacy itself that made me ncrvnus. Every time I turned a corner on cam­pus. I had the haunting feeling that my family had been there before me. It was almost like part or my discovery process of college had been violat,•d, and nothing was my nwn. 
Whal I didn't n1alize was that in the coming months, I would make my Saint l\1ary's experi­ence more of' my ow1J than I had ever imagined. WhilP I was walking in my parents' footstpps, I

was using my own shops -and leaving som1\ largo footprints. As I muddlnd my way through my first semestPr of class(1s. my first dorm par­ties. SYRs and working f'or The Observer, I sud­denly realized at the Pnd of it that I was calling this place in South Bend home..And magically the butterflies disappmtrnd. 
Over tlrn ,rnxt fnw months you will receivn countless pieces of advice. Som1\ you will find invaluabln. some you will discard. Ilowcwer you decide to proceml with thn n11xt four y1!ars of' your lifn, remember that it is your own. You, the class of 2004, aro about to join a rich 1S(i­yrar old tradition that has be,m forgPd by many bnforn you. But you will comn in and make this placn your own, with your spirit. your drive, and your willingness to Pmbrace your Saint Mary's experiPnCI'. 
Within my quest to separatn mysP!f' f'rom my family, I found myself falling into the unique tradition that had charactnriznd tlwm for so many years. While I still remain bound and determined to forgc1 my own path, som1\wlrnrn along the way I rnaliznd that I wasn't following my family's path, but adding to it. And with that addition, my colh1ge expnrinncn was my own -and 'I had constructnd it myself'.

Money can't buy 
happiness, but 
quarters help 
I sat staring at this computer scrcfm for hours, fran­tically searching for Llrn pcrfoct advice for this year's int'oming freshmen. \1y soard1 seemed endless and howlless. as the upcoming weeks will be filled with clirh<\s. tips and rult's from every fac-ct of' campus ­
what could I possibly add to the wis­

dom? 
I took a brf'ak from my quest and instead mad tho paper anrl talked with some friends. It was then that a friend of mine told me a story that opened my eyes. ignited my temper and all of a sudden, my creative juices began to now. 
llere's tlrn scenario: bright, young 
Christine Kraly sophomore strolls enthusiastically 
into office (which will go unnamed, 
yet helps liberal arts students with 
Assistant financial problems) and asks for 
:Wanaging helµ in changing his major. Spirit ol' 
Editor bright, young liberal arts student is 
consequently broken when smirking 
woman behind desk replies: "You brttcr get a scholarship because you won't be making any money when you graduate." Somehow. just then, l knew what I had to write about: happiness. 
.\tluch of any normal college student's life is spent b11ing poor. This is a warning: you will be poor. College is a limo to loam independence, financially and spiri­tually, f'rnm your parents and home life. It's a time spent scroun"gfog around for extra beer money and rifling through couch cushions for laundry change. During these times, economically speaking, you will be the bottom of the totem pole. 
But you'll b!' having fun. You'll be the lowest of the low, and voti'll love iL You'll discover that thern's no grPater f',;pling than finding an extra roll of laundry quarters your mom stornd away. And no chocolate is sweeter than that of cam package chocolate chip cook­ies. 
And all this time, tlrn fear of paying tuition or school loans shouldn't enter vour mind. 
It took mn a long ti,~!' to realize that monPy does not, will not and should not 1wer equal happiness. llappiness should stem from the very simplest things in lifn: lati'·night talks. gdting mail. evPn a few extra quarters. 
l.ifo. nspecially college life, should be lived reckless­ly. passionately and with little lo no rcgnit. I encour­age; n'gular class attendanci., of course, and dndication to Pach and evnry one of your assignments. 'What I emphatically frown upon. though, is figuring out how mud1 each class costs your parents wheirnver you miss a philosophy krture or a papPr deadline -it's not worth it. 'Worlds do not collide and pocketbooks do not empty whnn you sleep through your l'reshman seminar 01w dav. 
Most-importantly. 1rnv,ir let anyone make you doubt your choicPs, espncially because of monetary masons. Sonw of you may leavn school and beconw instant mil­lionaries. And your friends may graduate and make morP money in tlrnir l'irsl two yc1ars than all your work­ing yPars t·ombiIH'd. What's most important is that your yrars in school am spflnt living and not living for rno1Hly. Bn picky. r.losP your eyes anrl point; but makt1 sun· your choir.t)S makt) you happy. 
I st.ill have lo rpminrl mysell' somBlimPs why I study what I study and why I spend hours lockrd up in a din­ing hall basemmlt writing columns like these. It's b1ieausP it's what rnak1is mri happy. It's what makPs nm me. ,\ml if' I had to giv,i anyonP -from llHi mosl S('arP<l f'rnshman to tlw CEO of a major corporation ­onP piece of advice. that would be it. Do what makes you happy, and you'll b1-1 the riclrnst pPrson in the world.

The ND/SMC survival guide 
Advice is a funny thing, delved out at every turn in our lives. Doubtless, you have already received a myriad ofguidance from parents, friends and relatives on how to make your college years the best they can be. You have heard wisdom on the best cure for homesickness, how to 
study for a college final and how to wash dishes in a two-by-two sink. While all these tidbits are useful. we'd like to offer some thoughts that are slightly more applicable to colle~e life here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's -advice that knows what words like "parietals' and "SYR" mean. Straight from the mouths of those who have successfully survived the first year on these campuses, we bring you the undisputed champion of college-life authority,

Tlrnre was only onn problem: rncognizing who was Jessica and who was Kristrn. 
"Thf'V had dil'f'nrnnt num­bers," l~rown said. "ThaL's how I told th,im apart." 
Brown still does not always gel their names right but shn has continued to noticP tlH' twins' lalt•nt.

The lonn graduating starter was Mary Lcf'fors. the 1999 !3ig East Player of tlrn Year. 
"Last year was a bit disap­pointing." Boylan said of her team who qualified for their eight straight NCAA tourna­ment. "We had some good momrnts but that loss (to Ohio Slatf') was tough." 
Though they have yet to wear tht1 Blun and Gold, the fresh­men are no strangers to high­levf'I volleyball.

WOMEN'S SOCCER 

Milligan needs freshman class to compete in MIAA 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Spmrs Wrircr 
Saint Mary's soccer is in full swing as the freshmen arrive on campus, rnady to nrnet the goals they set just a week ago when practice began. 
"Division Ill soc'.cer offers women an idl'al environment to participatn in highly competitive and l"ultilling athletic and acade­mic programs," said .Jason 
Milligan, second-year head coar.h. "We are committed to tlw development of student alh­lrtes who accept nothing but the host and always strivn for 
improvnnwnt." 
Tim lr.adr\rship of the team falls on s1!nior Laura Paulen's shoulch\rs. The lonP senior on tlw tr.am. l'aulr.n fills thr. shons ol' last s1\ason's sPn ior lri-cap­tains: lnading sr.orf'r and nwm­b1\r ol' the Mli\A First Team Katy llargPr. dPfonsivf' l!•ader Badwl liggi:r. and Erin l\lcC:abP. 
l'aulPn will dPpnnd upon juniors Tia l\apphahn, Adrian Kirby, .lPssirn Klink, Katy Hobirisoa and Kristi'n Prignac t;, sl!'p up and lnnd tlwir strong !1~adPrship skills to Llw team.

But ii is thP f'rPshnwn to 
High bloodpressure feels like nothing at all 
SAME GOES FOR THE CONSEl2UENCES, 
whom Milligan looks to cement thn team's basr, of skill and dntermination and build a pow­c r h ousr. in the MIA/\. The returning members of the lP-am echo this philosophy. 
"We'rn excited because we have freshmen coming in with gnod talent," Paulen said. "We're counting on them to step up and fill the spares that we have. With the returning players and the frpshmen r,oming in wr. have a solid base to build l'rom there." 
Muth said the freshmen were already a part of the team after only a few days of practice. 
"They are fitting right into the team," Muth said. "They filled all the gaps that Wf\ have." 
The individuality each fresh­man brings to the tr.am has b,Hm important, according to Taylor. 
"Thr,y bring not only tlrnir skill but their personality to the team," Taylor said. 
5 
So while Barger, Egger, McCabe, and the rest of' the players who did not return will be sorely missed. the remaining players and their new team­mates are fully prepared to make the 2000 season a suc­cess. 
"We'rn really excited about this year," Muth said. 
Milligan's expanded effort'> to recruit nationally has brought freshmr.n from Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Texas. New York, Michigan, Florida. and /\labama. 
"The majority of our team played for Division [ and Division II clubs f'rorn all over the U.S., and about half havr, experif'nce al the state and regional levels of the Olympic Development Team," Milligan said. "Watch thcse women in action and you will understand that this is a dynamic group of women whose enthusiasm is unmatched." 

Milligan hopes to build a tr.am that will be even morn sur.cess­ful than last year's 9-6-2 record and fifth place finish in the Ml/\/\. 
"/\ positive attitude, diligent work ethic, and an unyielding desire to br. successful are the cornerstones that will ensure a bright future l'or Saint Mary's

hire a new staff. hit tho recruit­ing trail, make plans for the upcoming season and move his family out to Indiana. Brey hopes to fulfill the predictions of µreseason polls that have Notre Dame ranked among the top 20 Learns in the nation. 
"They lthe playf:rs] took a step last year, but they really didn't get where they wanted to get. and that was the NCAA Tournament," Brey said. "Our goal has to be to be high-living on Sdection Sunday. I told them that I think I can help with that. This program has not been in the NCAA Tournament since 1990 and that's an amazingly 
dr.r spell. , . 
Theres exper,tat10ns now, and we've got to hack that up." Brey continued. "I think this 
group's ready to do that. They weren't last vear. but with the leadership this year. I think ...... they're ready, cspf',cially Martin !lngelsbyl and Troy [Murphy]. the team's captains. It's their team." 
In lhc past month. Brey has filled out the rest of his coaching staff. 
Sean Kearney, 13rey's top assistant at Delaware, followed Brey to Notre Dame, and will serve as associat11 coach. Anthony Solomon comes to Notre Dame as an assistant coach following two yr,ars as assistant athletic dirr.ctor for basketball operations at Clemson. Assistant coach Lewis Preston hails from Coastal Carolina University. where he was an assistant coach. Rod Balanis will be the new director of basketball operations. coming to Notre Dame after being an assistant coach at Colgate. 
The biggr,st question for Brey is whether the team can recap­ture last year's camaraderie. 
"With some talented new faces. but with a lot of guys back from last year, are we still going to be an unselfish group that can throw itself in for the team goals?" asked Brey. "I think this group can be. with the leader­ship from Murphy and lngelsby." 
"There is a long history of where the [basketball) program has been and it will take some time to r'.hange that." Kachmarik said. "Having a full-time coach. however, will be the first step in changing that history." 
Smith comes from DePauw University where she was the graduate assistant for basketball and volleyball. While at DePauw, Smith helped r.oar,h the women's basketball team to a two-year record of 42-10, back to hack Southern Collegiate Athletic Conferenr,e Championships, and a trip to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament in 1999. 
"Suzanne brings a wealth of knowledge with her," Kachmarik said. "The [players] can relate to her at their level. She's going to enP.rgize them <tnd bring new enthusiasm to the program." 
Joining Smith on the coaching staff is assistant coach Sherry Donnelly. Donnelly will work with the post players, help rer,ruit. and encourage commu­nity relations. Where Smith brings knowledge as a collcge­1evc I coach. Donnelly brings experience as a player. She recently participated in a WNBA tryout with the Orl~ndo MirarlA. 
"!Donnelly] brings maturity, humor. and expertise as a coaf'.h and a player," said athletic direetor Lynn Kachmarik. "!Donnelly a.nd Smith] an'. going to bring this program to a new lrvf:I. This vnar the wornr,n arc going to get what they deserve," Kaf'.hmarik said.

Brey takes over as Irish basketball coach 
• Doherty leaves for alma mater North Carolina 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN A,sociare Sport~ Editor 
When Notre Dame hired bas­ketball coach Matt Dohertv in March 199<J, littl!'\ did r-;.ns know it would bf' a shorl lovP affair with tht1 popular nt1w coach. 
DohHrty li;d the Fighting Irish to thP-finals of thfl National Invitation Tournamenl and a 22-15 rN:ord. also bringing swarms of fans back to the Joyce C1rnter. But in July, Doherty lfod the blue and gold of Notre Dame in favor of the blue and white of his alma mater North Carolina, bringing his 16-month stint at the helm of the Fighting Irish mE'n's bas­ketball program to an end. 
"I nevH thought that this would come about so soon in my career," Doherty said. "I was mwer Sl't in my mind that I was going to leavP. I was the most conf'usc>d I'd ever been in my life bncause I didn't know what l wanted to do. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make." 
That openPd up the possibility for DelawarP head coach Mike Brey to take a second shot at his dream job. Notre Dame passed Brey over in '99, but new athletic director Kevin White jumped at the chance to hire Brey this time around. The new Notre Dame head basket­ball coach hopes to usher in a Jong-term era of success and stability. 
'Tm here to stay. They're going to have to kick me out," Brey said. "A year ago it was an opportunity and I came up short. I always thought it was a good flt for me with how I've been trained. But I never thought the Notre Dame job would come up again so soon." 

Brey had an idea the Notre Dame position might come open before Dohertv's name was even mentioned in· conjunction with the North Carolina spot. TarHeels coach Bill Guthridge resigned June 30, and once for­mer North Carolina assistant coach Roy Williams announced his decision to stay at Kansas on July 6, Brey knew Doherty might make the short list of pos­sible Carolina successors. 
"As soon as I saw that Roy Williams did not go to Kansas, I knew that Matt Doherty would

Smith to lead Belles' hoops 
By KATIE McVOY 
Assisranr Sports Editor 
Suzanne Smith will join the hundreds of new frnshrnen unpacking their bags in South Bend this week as she arrives on campus to take the reins for the Belles basketball program. 
But that 
won't b1~ 
an easy 
task. 
Walking into a fledgling program that struggll"d under former head coach Dave Roeder, Smith has the challenge of turning around last season's 4-22 losing rncord and restor­ing Pnerio' and confidence to the program. 
Roeder left last season after four years and four consecu­tive losing seasons. 
"This year my main goal is to get the confidence back in the program and have some fun," Smith said. "There is a ton of talent here. I need to get them to work together and trust each other." 
Smith will be joining the· athletic staff full-time as the sports information director. In addition to coaching and recruiting for the basketball team, Smith will be the hub of information about all Saint

FOOTBALL 
Hoping for some new heroes beneath the Golden Dome 
By TIM CASEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The eighteen freshmen foot­ball players arrived for their first practice on August 7, all with impressive resumes and high expectations. 
Within a few days, they real­ized the difficult transition from high school hero to Notre Dame newcomer. 
"That's natural," said coach Bob Davie of the freshmen, who are not allowed to speak with 
I .. 
the media until after the Sept. 2 opening game against Texas A&M. "We just tell them to take it one day at a time." 
For Davie, in the fourth year of his highly­publicized (and critical) tenure, get­ting that cliche mes­sage across to the Class of 2004, may seem 

Davie
like the least of his worries. But he remains focused on maintaining the con­fidence of impressionable fresh­men. 
Included in the class arc three quarterbacks -Carlyle Holiday, Matt Lovecchio and Jared Clark -who are competing with junior starter Arnaz Battle and sophomore Gary Godsey for playing time. 
In preparation for the college game, Davie sent the new quar­terbacks play books and video­tapes during the summer. But, complying with NCAA rules, the coaches could not spend exten­sive time teaching them. When the trio came here, that all changed. 
Battle and Godsey have helped make the transition easier, counseling the freshmen on the physical and mental aspects of the position while the coaching staff can now work with them in person. 
"There's a lot to learn: schemes, reading defenses and picking up blitzes," Godsey said. ''It'll take time." 
Less than two we1>ks into prac­tice, the results are unclear. On Wednesday, Holiday, LoVecchio and Clark each took snaps for the first time against the defense. As of now, Davie said the freshmen are behind the upperclassmen on the depth chart. The three freshmen may even be grouped together for the season instead of naming a sin­gle third quarterback. 
"We want to be fair to them." Davie said. "We want to give them enough reps under pres-
