Carter's economic program 
'77 Tax rebate envisioned 
WASHINGTON AP -President Carter's $31 billion economic pro­gram may include a $50 cash payment for nearly every Ameri­can. including the non-taxpayit~g poor, Bert Lance, Carter's budget director, said yesterday. 
Lance said the payments would be in the form of a tax rebate for each personal exemption claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would be a cash payment for persons receiving Social Security benefits and for low-income per­sons who do not pay taxes. 
Lance said Carter has also deci­ded to ask Congress to encourage business investment by raising the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. 
However, some liberal Demo­crats and the AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said they would try to shift the focus of the legislative package to job creation and minimize the tax relief. 
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at the White House quoted the President as saying that his is "the best way" to stimulate the economy. Rep. John Brade­mas, the House majority whip, said Carter pledged ''to meet Congress more than half way" in the quest for action on his programs. 
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to provide payments ot all the poor, expecially, those with incomes below $4,000, because it could cost nearly as much in administrative costs to reach them as the amount of the payments themselves. 
"We will try to reach all we can. Unfortunately there may be some we can't reach," he said at a briefing. 
The way Lance outlined the rebate plan, a family of four with income of $10,000 would receive a total tax rebate of about $200. For a family of three, the rebate would total $150. 
But Lance said final details remain to be worked out, and it is not yet possible to say with certainty how much a family at a given income level would receive. Upper-income Americans probably will receive rebates, but the 
Gassman discusses plans for semester with HPC 
byTomByme Senior Staff Reporter 

Student Body President Mike Gassman attended the semester's first meeting of the Hall Presidents Council last night and outlined the projects his administration will undertake during the remainder of his term. 
Gassman also distributed a Stu­dent Government survey on the LaFortune Student Center, design­ed to sample student opinion on the facility as a basis for possible renovation. Included in the four­page handout is an explanation of disciplinary process at the hall and University levels, provided by Stu­dent Government Judicial Coordin­ator Bob Bode. 
Student Government will assign high priority to resolving the problem of the lack of social space on campus, according to Gassman, who added that funds would be sought in the upcoming months from the board of trustes and major contributing alumni. He said that the money would be used to help correct some of the deficiencies of the student center. 
"Some of the rooms could be more practically used,'' remarked Gassman. "I'd like to see the basement developed also, since some of the rooms down there are hardly used.'' He also expressed the hope that a dining area could be added to the Huddle area. 
Gassman disclosed that the in­stallation of washing machines on campus, recently approved by the administration, will be delayed until a suitable location can be found. 
"There seems to be a chance that we might get the machines in by mid-semester break,'' said Gassman, noting that the site will probably be on the south quad. 
He also informed the council that his proposal to install cable televi­sion on campus has been stalled by University officials. "There seems to be a disagreement on the part of the University about fostering something like TV that might not be conducive to study," explained Gassman. 
"A reply will be written and we'll do a little more homework financially." 
In a letter to Gassman, Univer­sity President Theodore Hesburgh indicated that the idea was "open for future consideration." 
Gassman also briefed the hall presidents on the progress of the. student lobby working to lower the drinking age to 18, led by Jerry Klingenberger. While the Indiana House of Representatives has "turned more conservative," ac­cording to the Student Body Presi­dent, the measure will be first considered by the Senate, where chances of passage are more favorable. 
In other business, the HPC Executive Coordinator Keefe Montgomery urged the presidents to assist in the organization of An Tostal, the annual three-day festi­val scheduled to begin on April 21. 
"This year, we're going to try to stress the hall presidents becoming more involved in the organizational 
aspect," said Montgomery, who is co-chairman for the event which is sponsored by the HPC. He solicited ideas and pledged to report to the council on the progress of An Tostal preparations. 
HPC Chairman J.P. Russell ur­
ged the council members to "get 
more involved in An Tostal," 
adding that many students were 
probably unaware that the festival 
was sponsored by the HPC,

Continued on page 6 amount hasn't been finally deci­ded, he added. 

Lance said he hopes some parts of the program can be approved by Congress by April, but declined to estimate when payments may actu­ally be in the mail. 
The total amount of the rebates and cash payments would be about $11 billion this year, Lance said. Carter earlier had estimated the rebates would be between $7 billion and $11 billion. 
Carter's total income stimulus program, which must be approved by Congress before bec_omes effec­tive, would be about $31 billion, slightly larger than first proposed. About $15.8 billion would be for 1977, and $15.5 billion for 1978, Lance said. 
In addition to tax rebates and help for business, Lance said the package will include the jobs programs and permanent tax re­ductions Carter proposed earlier. 
Carter is expected to disclose additional details in a message to Congress within the next two weeks. 

Weather delays completion of SMC Athletic Center 
by Marti Hogan St. Mary's Editor 

A wave of sub-zero weather and heavy snow has pushed back the completion date of Saint Mary's Athletic Center, according to Stevie Wernig, assistant dean of Student Affairs. The completion date, which was previously scheduled for March 23, has now been set for July 1. 
The construction workers were prohibited by state law to work under the severe weather con­ditions for safety reasons. "When snow freezes on the steel, it gets slippery and is unsafe to work with," Wernig explained. 
The outside walls of the building will be made of translucent fiber glass, which must be formed to curve at the top before it can be installed. "Until it gets a little warmer, they can't form it proper­ly," she said. 
However, construction resumed last week on the center as the workers are now working inside on the lower level. "They still think they can make up a lot of the lost time," Wernig said, "but you must can't count on the weather in Northern Indiana. If it snows from now until March, it's a different story.'' 
Wernig stated that the building will definately be ready for student use when school starts in August. "It's almost better to wait to make sure the building is totally finished, she said. She referred to the previously scheduled completion date saying, ''The basic construc­tion might have been finished, but would the light bulbs have been installed or the floor markings in?" 
The building's dedication has also been moved back to Septem­ber, but no date has been set. A plaque is being prepared in honor of the class of 1977 and will be affixed to the building. 
"The class of '77 was the first class to contribute money for the center, and the leaders of that class influenced the other classes to contribute to it," Wernig said. "That's why I really wanted the center to be completed for them." 
Interior design 

The design for the middle of the floor, an "interlocking SMC on a diagonal slant," has been complet­ed. "It's in royal blue," Wernig explained adding that the center will be "an extremely colorful building." 
"It has an exposed ceiling." she continued, "and all the pipes will be painted different colors." The inside walls will be off-white cinder block whilf the outside is trans­lucent fiber glass. 
"Even on cloudy days in South Bend we won't need to have the lights on," she said. "It'~ an extremely energy-conscious build­ing. That's why it was built into the ground instead of above. It won't even look like a gym," Wernig added. 
The main equipment, such as basketball hoops and tennis and Vollevball nets, is included in the cost of the building. However, St. Mary's has already purchased add­itional equipment over the past two years. "For the past two years we've known that we'd have the building,'" she explained, "so we had money in the budget since then to buy the equipment." 
Equipment will be available for students who wish to play but do not own their own equipment. "If a kid wants to try racquetball but doesn't want to make the initial investment, she will be able to go down to the issue room and sign out a racquet and ball," Wernig said. 
She emphasized that students should not be afraid to use the center or participate in a sport because they may have never played before. "We hope everyone will use the building," she said. 


ND housing shortage relieved 
by Rosemary Mills 
The housing shortage that greeted many new students last semester is now alleviated, says Father John Mulcahy, Director of Student Housing.There is no longer crowding of students into the Farley Motel, R.A.'s rooms, and other available space. 
Mary Craig, a readmitted stu­dent, resident of South Bend, is presently the only woman living in the Farley Motel. While there are no open accomodations in the women's dormitories, five spaces are available to men. These spaces were opened by the graduation of 53 seniors in December, the move­ment of 20 students to off-campus housing, and other students who did not return. 
According to Mulcahy, there is no waiting list for male on-campus housing. Approximately 90 stu­dents were on this list at the end of last semester. There are still three of 33 women waiting to move on campus. 
Mulcahy stressed that Notre Dame does not have an over­crowding problem. he explained that most room shortages occurred with transfer and readmitted stu­dents. These students are not guaranteed housing. They elect to wait for an open room. 
An Observer article on Sept. 2 quoted direptor of Admissions John 
T. Goldrick as saying "We're already proposing that 400 fewer students be accepted next year and instead be put on the waiting list.'' The same article mentioned a revision of admissions policy in the near future. 
According to Goldrick's state­ment yesterday, however, the pol­icy is to " ...accept the best students first.'' Neither this policy nor the admissions quota will 
chan_ge from last year. While Goldrick stated that the quota was 1,625 students, Mul­cahy, a member of the Admissions Quota Committee, stated that next year's quota has not yet been determined. Mulcahy did say that the quota would be between 1,625 and 1,650 students. He sees no reason to accept fewer students. One of the reasons behind Mul­cahy's statement is that 1,022 seniors now reside on campus as compared to last year's 753. June graduation would thus provide more openings for those entering in the fall. Mulcahy sees no possibility of a lottery for housing. He explained that the problem this year was caused by 73 more students con­firming acceptance than the Uni­versity expected. Mulcahy stresses that, in his four years as housing director, the admissions office had never had this problem before.

Bars receive heavy fines for admitting minors 

by Dave O'Keefe Staff Reporter 

Two local bars have recently received stiff penalties for viola­tions of a state liquor ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. The actions were the results of separate raids conducted by excise agents of the· Indiana Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) late last year. 
As a result of the actions taken, at least one area bar will no longer accept the Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student identification card as legitimate proof of age. 
Fat Wally's was forced to close its doors on Jan. 9 after a state judge in Indianapolis revoked the bar's liquor license for a one-week period. 
The ruling came on the heels of a raid conducted last November by agents of the ABC that resulted in the arrests of three minors. none of whom was a Notre Dame of Saint Mary's student. 
In a similar case, Nick Bilello, owner of Nickie's Restaurant, ap­peared before the same judge last Monday and was ordered to pay a $300 fine for serving alcohol to patrons under the age of 21. 
At the same time, the judge recommended that the bartender's license of Nickie's employee Larry J urkens be revoked for his part in the incident. The action against Jurkens is still pending. 
As in the case of Fat Wally's, the 
action  against  Bilello  stemmed  
from  raids  conducted  by  ABC  
agents.  

In a seemingly unrelated inci­dent, a number of area bars reported having been visited by vice officers of the South Bend Police Department last Friday night. 
Fat Wally's manager Gary Pioch was the only proprietor to report that the officers actually confronted patrons and asked for age identifi­cation. 
One man was arrested in Fat Wally's for refusing to produce identification, although it was later learned that he was not a minor. He was charged, however, with interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duties. 
As a result of the action taken against his establichment, Pioch says that Fat Wally's will no longer accept a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student identification card as legitimate proof of age. 
"We've caught a lot of flak from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students," Pioch commented, "but I've been told that a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's l.D. is not acceptable because it is not issued by a state-administered agency.'' 
Library owner Rick Kanzer ad­mits that the student l.D. card is not technically a legal form of identification in Indiana. "But we have used them in the past,''

SLC changes format to forum strjucture 
by Joe Gill Staff Reporter 
The Student Life Council decided yesterday to change its format and become a ''forum for the discussion of student life." Acting on a suggestion by SLC Chairman Mike Casey, the SLC moved to designate the next meeting for discussion of a specific topic, such as alcohol policy, faculty hiring, social space, or disciplinary procedure. 
In a letter sent last week to SLC members, Casey expressed his disappointment that the ''SLE is not living up to its potential." he labeled as mistaken the idea the the SLC must turn out a ''legislated product" at the expense of real dialogue, while noting that "deli­beration and some real discussion can be much more beneficial." 
Once the specified topic is dis­cussed, further study will be con­ducted by a special ad hoc commit­tee in the weeks following. The committee will then make a final decision, proposal, or recommen­dation concerning that particular area. 
Much of the meeting was spent discussing the function of the SLC* in regards to Casey's letter. Student Body President Mike Gass­man said he feels there are ''a lot of issues we (the SLC) should sit here and discuss. We've got Bro. Just (Vice-.President of Student Affairs), Dean (of students) Roemer, stu­dents, faculty--everything we need." 
The council also discussed topics for a consideration of future meet­ings. Sr. jane Pitz, C.S.C., sug~!stea the quality of life at

Notre Dame. A few members felt this concept was "too nebulous," and Roemer suggested that the S.C inskad review and evaluate the services available on campus for students. 
After further discussion Biles asked the members to "write down three areas you feel need discuss­ing." The suggestions were then handed over to the Executive committee, which will decide what the SLC will discuss at the next meeting.

Fat Wally's manager Pioch feels that the consistent raids have hurt his business. Pioch described what he felt to be the prevailing attitude among the students. ''the general feeling is, why should we go to Fat Wally's and get hassled when we can go to Nia.kie's or Corby's or The Library and not worry about some­one beating on the door," Pioch said.

gogmg. Brook protested and asked for an apology. Bayh said he had made the remark inadvertently "in the heat of passion." 
Bell, 58, served on the 5th U.S. Circui.t Court of Appeals for nearly 15 years by appointment of Presi­dent John F. Kennedy and has been described by Carter as the best qualified person he could find to head the Justice Department. 
But at hearings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee his nomination drew strong opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo­
ple, the Congressional Black Cau­

visit SMC 
cus, Americans for Democratic Action and other civil rights and liberal organizations. 
Brooke, the Senate's only black, called the six days of hearings held by the Judiciary panel "pro forma and perfunctory" and said addi­tional witnesses should have been summoned in an effort to get all the facts about Bell's record. 
Bayh, who took the lead in the Senate debate in urging Bell's confirmation, said Brooke's indict­ment of the committee was unfair. 
He said its questioning of Bell, 
lasting some 13 hours, had been 
probing and detailed. 

The committee voted ten to three to recommend Senate confirma­tion, with all the dissenting votes cast by Republicans. 
Sen. Charles Mathias (R--Md.), one of the committee members who voted against the nomination, told the Senate that Bell's confirmation "would raise grave doubts about whether the people could look to the Justice Department in the future as a citadel of equality and justice." 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Se­nate yesterday confirmed President Carter's nomination of Griffin B. Bell, an Atlanta lawyer and former federal judge, to be Attorney General. The vote was 75 to 21. 
Carter's selection to head the Justice Department stirred more controversy than any of Carter's other Cabinet appointments and the Senate vote was preseded by more than six hours of at times acrimonious debate. 
Republican opponents contended the Democratic majority was not applying the same standards to Bell that thev would have had he been the ~ominee of a GOP president. Some of them also raised questions of "cronyism" because of Carter's long-time friendship with Bell. 
But most of the debate over Bell centered around his civil rights record. an issue emphasized by blacks and liberal organizations who opposed his nomination. Carter has called Bell's civil rights record "superb." 
Sen. Edward W. Brooke (R-­Mass.) said six days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee left "great gaps" in the record. He moved to send the nomination back to the committee for further hear­ings. The Senate rejected his motion by a vote of 70 to 25. 
Earlier Brooke had clashed 

sharply with Sen. Birch Bayh (D--Ind.) who led the floor fight for Bell's confirmation. The two liberal senators usually are allied on civil rights issues but this time were on opposite sides. 
Brooke was among Republican senators who suggested that if Bell were the nominee of a GOP president, he would be rejected by the heavily Democratic Senate. 
Bayh denied Democrats were "rubber-stamping" the Atlanta lawyer because he was the nominee of a Democratic President and at one .point accused Brooke of dema-

In their never-ending quest to instill a modicum of sophistication and artistic appreciation in the great unwashed of Notre Dame, the inema '77 people are again offering a series of excellent films this semester. With one eye on the screen and the other on the cashbox, series chairman Sean Coleman kicks things off next Tuesday night at 7:30 in the Engineering Auditorium with Taxi Driver. Below is a listing of what to expect, published as a public service by us, your friends at The Observer. 
Taxi Driver (Feb 1.2): By now you've probably heard about all the neat little brutalities that Robert DeNiro inflicts on people in this movie. But Martin Scorsese's film features incredible depth and tact in handling the story of a cabbie who simultaneously Jives in and fights off the New York City nights, only to lose magnificently. It is a powerful study made all the more potent by DeNiro's calculated performance and some fine assists by Peter Boyle and Jody Foster. 
King Kong (Feb. 20,21): You may have never heard of Merian C. Cooper, but the monster movie he made 44 years ago remains today as a masterpiece of cellu­loid. Dino de Laurentis may have the million-dollar monkey and Jessica Lange and all the modern tricks, but Cooper had something that makes his film ultimately and undisputedly superior: it was his idea. 
Beauty and the Beast (Feb. 22, 23): Jean Cocteau's. lyric film adaptation of the famous fairy tale is an enchanting work of art that has come from the early days of film. Despite the obvious drawbacks tht confront a general audience (the ftlm is shot in black and white and is subtitled in English), the simplistic beauty ofthe visual film is matched by similarly innocent beauty of the story as Cocteau tells it. 
Slngln' in the Rain (March 8,9): This 19~2 MGM muscial has rightly earned 1ts reputation as one of the most inventive a~d enthusiastic musicals ever made. While the love story involving Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds as a pair of Hollywood types is hardly noteworthy, it nevertheless provides an adequate vehicle for a vast array of songs and dance scenes on which rest the film's splendid reputation. 
Stanley Kubrick Festival (March 28-31): This semester's week-long festival looks at the works of one of the most important filmmakers of today. The festival begins appropriately with Paths of Glory (March 28), the film that first brought Kubrick to the attention of the general public. It is a searing condemnation of the dehumanizing effects of war as they are visited upon Kirk Douglas, a pacifist who nevertheless becomes a soldier, only to be subjected to the orders of a crazed commander. While Paths of Glory is intensely powerful because of its bluntness, the festival's second movie, Dr. Strangelove (March 29), is even more so because of it's splendid satire. Peter Sellers and George C. Scott are characteristically excellent in this Orwellian vision of a nuclear nightmare that manages to be both outrageously funny and terrifying at the same time. In 1968, Kubrick made a film that is by all accounts the best science-fiction movie ever. 2001: A Space Odyssey (March 30) serves not so much to tell a story as it does to present a collage of intense images tied toether by the tail of two astronauts orbiting the earth in a space-lab guided by HAL, a frighteningly sophisticated com­puter. The movie transcends the usual 
man-versus-machine and man-versus-man conflicts to describe with alarming accur­acy the story of man himself. The festival doses with A Oockwork 01'1Uljle (March 31), Kubrick's fine ~daptation of Anthony Burgess's novel about a violent young

Smith cites reasons for icers' play 
by John Stenson Sports Writer 
As Digger Phelps and his troops 
try to shake the memories of the 
last weeks, his hockey counterpart 
can only hope that the future will 
be as pleasing as what has already 
been accomplished. Lefty Smith 
and his squad has turned the tables 
on the collegiate powerhouses, 
(Michigan being the latest victim) 
and as they approach this week­
ends series at Colorado College, 
only six points separate them from 
Wisconsin and the top spot in the 
W.C.H.A. 
Smith attributes much of the 
recent success to the physical 
condition of the squad. "At the 
beginning of the season we thought 
we hand an excellent hockey team 
but after the Michigan State series 
where we lost five of our six 
defensemen due to injuries, we 
where really caught short and this 
set the tone for a slow start," he 
said. As predicted, when the Irish 
did get back to full speed their 
fortunes began to change. "If 
there was a turning point so far in 
this season," Smith noted, "it 
would have to be the overtime win 
against Michigan at Ann Arbor. 
This was the first time that we had 
the whole club back together and 
from there everything seemed to 
fall into place.'· 
For things to fall into place as well as they have recently for the Irish. winning eight of their last 11 and being ranked third in the nation, there must be more than o ne reason and Smith gives credit where credit is due. "I told the club at the beginning of the year that we not only needed excellent leadership out of Jack Brownshidle and Brian Walsh but from all the seniors and I think that each has done an excellent job as far as this is concerned." 
One senior cited for special recognition was winger Allan Kar­

snia who doesn't always get his 
share of ink.  'Allan is a very fine 
skater and has been voted our best 
defensive forward the last two 
years. Its a shame he doesn't 
always get the press but the team 
recognizes his value both on and off 
the ice." 
Another man who has avoided 
much of the limelight is junior 
defenseman Dick Howe whose 
improvement has been steady from 
the start of the season. "When you 
play along side a player like 
Brownshidle as Dick now does it's 
bound to give you some added 
confidence and in this way Dick has 
benefittedfrom Jack's experience," 
Smith observes. "Dick has gone 
out and worked all summer on his 
shot and his upper body strength 
which he now heavily relies. 
Combine this with the fact that 
Dick is a very intelligent hockey 
player with excellent hockey in­
stinct provides him with the ability 
that has been so helpful to us." 
As far as his co-captain Brian Walsh is concerned, Smith has noticed a definite change which allows "Dukie" to be a true leader as a senior. "Brian has shown us a great deal of maturity in his last two years. He's got great instinct and this along with his ability as a leader more than make up for what he lacks physically. His maturity and dedication have been the keys to his success and it is these qualities that make him so valuable to us." 
The goalie situation has been a hot item around the team for some time now with the Irish coach believing that he's got two of the best and along each to show there talents on alternating nights. "The goalie situation is odd in this respect. Lenny (Moher) had the best camp and we decided to go with him in the first series. Then when we went East we wanted to play both Len and John (Peterson) and both did a fine job for us on the holiday swing and I felt that they
