DLA claims responsibility for ACC bombs 
Mike Lewis Absurder Staff 

The Notre Dame Athletic and Convocation Center 
was completely destroyed yesterday when six bombs 
exploded simultaneously in various locations in the 
building. The Dillon Liberation Army, responsible 
for the kidnapping of the Grace Hall President last 
fall. claimed re~ponsibility for the bombing. 

No one was injured in the blasts, however. 
University President Fr. Teddy Hesburgh called 
from Paris to say the building was a total loss. 
"It'll take possibly 40 or SO cents to rebuild it," he 
said. indicating that a fund drive was already in 
progress. He also stated that he felt the alumni 
would be "generous in their contributions" and the 
money could be raised "hopefully by 1984." 
An unnamed spokesman for the DLA said the 
bombing was to protest University regulations 
banning lofts or other flammable constructions in 
the residence halls. 

Head basketball Richard "Dugger" Fipls said "I 
really hate to see the old building go," referring to 
the many spirited victories teams have earned in the 
ACC. "However, I think the old fieldhouse will 
more than meet the needs of both the basketball 
team and other sports programs at NO." 

God to speak at Commencement 

Michael Berberich Absurder Staff 
University President, the Rever· endTheodoreHesburgh. announced early today that God will be the featured speaker at the grad~ation ceremonies af ·thi" year's senior class. Hesburgh stated that God would be making what he termed a "major policy speech." For securi­ty reasons, the graduation will be held in the Fr. Edmund Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center. 
Additionally, so that large do­nors to the University can be in attendence, this year's seniors will be limited to one graduation ticket per person. "Seniors needn't worrv," stated one official, "we have" already reserved the best section of the bleachers for the parents. They have made sacrifi­ces for the last four years, and this is the least we can do for them." 
Hesburgh pointed out that will be the first ever appearance by God at a major American university. He added, "because of his advan­ced age, God doesn't travel as much as he used to, so we are really thrilled that he would take the time from his busy schedule to be here in honor of the class of '78." 

Many seniors expressed disap­pointment with the choice. Bill Alban, chairperson of the commit­tee to choose a graduation ~peaker, stated "We are really disappointed that Father Ted did not bother to consult the committee. He just went right over our heads without even telling us." Alban added, "The committee has put in many weeks of hard work. We had hoped to have either Howard Cosell, Doctor J. or Jane Fonda as a speaker." 
Charles "JoJo" Dressman has organized a petition and scheduled a demonstration on the steps of the Administration building for tomor­row at noon to protest the selection by the university. "We would have preferred a more contemporary speaker," he said. "However, because we would rather have all our families here. we can live with the selection if only the university will switch the location to the football stadium. l'm sure that our speaker could arrange good weath­er. Otherwise, we demand a new speaker." 
When confronted with the dis­pleasure of the seniors, one high ranking administrator who wished to remain anonymous responded, "Just who do they think is running this place? If the seniors-thought 
Fischer intruder escapes 
by Ray Rafter Novice Absurder Staff 
Yesterday, Fisher Hall resident Jim Shoo reported that a "per­verted" girl entered his unlocked third floor single room and awoke him. 
Shoo, who was unable to ad­equately describe the intruder, said that he contacted ND security immediately after the girl had left his room. Notre Dame Security Officers responded quickly and encountered an unidentified female leaving the area fitting the de­scription given by Shoo. The three Security men halted the fleeing

The intruder was described as a female Caucasian, 18-20 yars of age, and about five feet, three inches with shoulder-length brown hair. At the time she was wearing a green parka and afaded blue jeans and black boots. She appeared to have a whip slung over her shoulder. 
In reference to the recent assault in El Paso, James Rover, dean of students, said, "Even though the description of the intruder fits that of the woman rapist in El Paso, there is not enough to indicate a they-had a say in the matter, they Lastly, one official stated that were deceiving themselves.

Student government dissolved 
by Jean Powley Absurder Staff 

Saint Mary's Student Body Pre­
sident Merry "Royale" Rock-the­
Boat last night announced a total 
dissolvement of SMC student gov­
ernment, with the exception of the 
position of SBP. as the last official 
act of her reign, which ends 
Monday. 
"Student Assembly, The Hall 
President's Council, The Board of 
Governance and all the various 
committees of student government 
have all tried to exercise too much 
power this year," she proclaimed 
before a hushed dining hall (absurd 
in itself). 
"Therefore, I have decided to 
dissolve all of these student 
government organizations. From 
this time on, the government will 
consist only of a SBP and a close 
company of advisers, with advisory 
power only, " Rock-the-Boat an­
nounced, arms upraised in a sacred 
manner. 
"In addition, I have decided that Reidinger House will henceforth be the SBP's official residence and the 21 Club her official receiving Hall. Students will take turns cooking and cleaning for the president, much in the way parietal duty is, at present, assigned. No complaints should be heard because such duty is an honor and an obligation. 
"After all, it would be absurd to

SAGA with everyone else!!" she commanded. 
"Students with cars will have the added honor of chauffeuring the president around campus and the city. But remember, these vehicles must be kept perfectly clean and in good running order in order for the owner to become one of my chauffeurs," Rock-the-Boat conti­nued. 
"Oh, I almost forgot," Rock-the­boat said. "My residence will be the only building on campus with electrical power. Novena candles will be provided to all other students," she promised. 
Her final proclamation of the dinner hour was the fact that any student wishing to meet with her for any reason must schedule an "audience" with either her secre­

After graduation exercises, God will meet with Hesburgh, the Trustees, and a. large contributor to appeal for substantial donations to the Campaign for Notre Dame. Hesburgh stated, "We need more money if we are to keep Notre Dame from becoming a school accessible only to the wealthy." 
tary, Merry Lavatory, or her ser­geant-at-arms, John Dug-A-Coal­Mine, at least three days in advance. 
Rock-The-Boat then turned slow­ly, being careful not to trip over her newly-donned full-length powder blue, SMC insignia-ed cape, and paraded out followed by her advisers. 
The last girl in line carried a basket full of slips of paper which she threw out much like a flower girl strews flowers in a wedding procession. On each of the slips was written, "I thank God and the Saint Mary's student body for acknowledging my divine right to royal treatment for at least three days of my year in office. It makes the other 362 days seem worth­while!"

Ptooey eclipses longest 
mass record in Sacred Heart 
by Gregory Solman Absunler Stall 
It took hundreds of years of grooming/ Notre Dame priests for the task ... decades of preparation and training. And it took Father William Ptooey to make the dream a reality. which he did last Sunday, when he set the modern day record for the longest mass in history. 
It was a beautiful. crisp. cool, clear day within Sacred Heart Church last Sunday when a hearty and vociferous crowd showed up in force to watch Ptooey try to execute the mass in the slowest time yet st·cn. With a heartstopping and r('cord breaking three hour, thirty­tive minute mass, Ptooey dev­a~tated the old record, set way back on Easter Sunday, 1773, by Pope Clement XIV at the Vatican. 
fension exploded into noisy cheering as Ptooey made his ap­pearance at the back of the church, nodding appreciatively to the crowd being fomented into a fervor by the sounds of the Notre Dame Fight Song being played resplend­ently on Sacred Heart's new organ. 
''This is one of the main reasons we bought the organ," commented choir director and cheerleader Se­cond-Seeded Martin, who arranged the flowers brilliantly to slow down Ptooey's entrance into the church. 
After Father Ptooey had leisurely strolled to the foot of the altar, stopping along the way to shake hands with his adoring fans, Bro­ther Just Parcheesi, who was timing Ptooey's opening "split" in a nearby pew, signaled to Ptooey that he was running too fast. 
"He was a full two minutes earlier than Hesburgher was in '73," commented a concerned Parcheesi, "and you know how that one ended up," Parcheesi started to break down in emotion, "I had to slow him down. We had trained so hard for this. We spent weeks on the homily alone!" 
Ptooey was still at a critically fast pace at the end of the Liturgy of the Mass, but bravely, he went straight on into the Liturgy ofthe Eucharist. 
Ptooey came back in all of his ecclesiastical glory, however, dur­ing the consecration of the euchar­
.. 
ist. He was running a full four and one half minutes ahead of the Pope's record when he got to the phrase, "do this in memory of 
me.'' 
All breaths were collectively taken in when Ptooey lifted the chalice aloft, arms stretched way above his head. Minutes passed. Rivulets of sweat cut paths in Ptooey's brow. After five minutes, the crowd broke out into applause and cheering. By ten minutes, the crowd was on its feet, cheering on 
the brave priest, the strain of 
holding the chalice now showing in 
his pain-racked face. 
Fifteen minutes later the chalice 
came down. The crowd responded 
with tumultous applause--a display 
of chalice raising not seen since the 
days of Johnnie Zahm. Flashbulbs 
began to pop all over the chLirch, 
resplendantly reflecting off the 
stain glass windows. It was evident 
that there was no stopping Ptooey 
now. 
"That's where the weightlifting 
really came in handy," reflected 
the proud coach Robert Griffer, 
who, in his prime days, could spin 
out a nastily long sermon himself. 
''who could complain about the 
nautilus now?" 
"I knew--and Dahby knew," com­
mented Griff, "That there was only 
one critical stage left. The handing 
back of the water and wine bottles. 
Had Ptooey dropped either one-­
disqualification." 
Yes, the dreaded handoff, bring­ing back memories of Father Gonyers on Easter Sunday in 1972, Hesburgheton the Feast of the Immaculate Conception in 1964 and Badin on the second Sunday of Advent in 1864. Would Pt;JOey follow in their fumbling footstt~ps? 
But the handoff went smoothlv, as Ptooey took it behind his back \vith the precision of a sprinter receiving a baton in a relay. Having seen the critical stage pass, the crowd settled back, and braced them­selves for the finish. 
Adoring fans now surged toward the altar awaiting the final blessing when they would explode tradition­ally onto the altar area to pry souvenir pieces from the Bernini Altar. 
The crowd got so boisterous and large, that WSND's Wally Robin­son was forced by the madding crowd, to the top of Father Zahm's crypt to see the action for his radio audience. 
"Ptooey looks in tremendous f,lrm today,'' he cried, hoarse from the excitement, "and these perky post­pascal pew people are really enjoy­ing this mass' execution." 
There were, as always, skeptics in the crowd. Father Tom Bland, who had researched the event for the Notre Dame archives, commented on the breaking of the old pa:pal record. "There are advantages that Ptooey had that we must take into consideration. Besides the Ifact that he has had modern training methods, you have to remember that in the days of Clement XIV. the robes were heavier and hotter, bad for an endurance mass of this nature. Plus, where as Ptoo~::y's record was timed with a Dellllxe Gruen Stopwatch, Clement's re­cord was timed with a sand dial." 

Dug-A-Coal-Mine dies from electrification 
"But, Jet's face it," admitted Bland. pointing to Coach Griffer, "He won for the old Griffer. And besides...there are modern pro­blems that Ptooey had to en­counter. For instance, today's hosts are much lighter and easier to distribute ... that can speed up a mass tremendously, and ruin a good time." "And then there's the change from Latin to English," concluded Father Bland, "Which is a ·dis­advantage to Ptooey. You see, the old priests could add portions in Latin. thus extending the mass, and only other priests would know the difference.'' "In all." concluded Bland, "It was an adequate performance. But it won't be long before it's bro­ken Father Ptooey, basking in his win, had something to say about that. "Well.

Dom Headsman Surgery Six-Pinter -( ~1 you thought ~ou were through with reading this boring pre-game column which really said nothmg about upcommg Notre Dame athletic contests. Well. you were wrong. Just because there are no important games on the horizon doesn't mena I can't churn out some jock jibberish about Notre Dame games and players of the recent past. The first game I'd like to mutter about is Notre Dame's loss to Duke (I bet you never thought anyone from Sports Information would ever bring up a game in which we actually lost.) Everyone knows that we (Ooop~ ....l forgot I'm ~upposed to be objective) should have won that game; unfortunately, Coach Dugger Flips took a vacation m the fir~t half of the ~arne. He just sat there on the bench soaking inthe fact that he had finally reached the Fmal Four whtle the Blue Devils (that's Duke's nickname in case you didn't know) raced to a big lead. When Dugger woke from his first half dream he found himself 14 point~ down .. Dugger did a fair job of getting the team psyched for the final stanza (hey, I'm getting almost hterate m my old age) but he stayed with two of h is stalt'ters too long. Colli Thepuker, a normally poise~ frosh. lost m~st of ~is co_ol during this game and he was not very effective. Maybe he has b~en spendmg too much hme wtth hts cheerleader friend, you know, Bucky Beaver. After all, his shootmg percentage has fallen below the 60 percent mark once this relation flourished. The other starter, Dave "The Twirler" Baton, wasn't very effective either. But his performance was at least excusable, Duke coach Foste Lager told his troops to stop Baton even if it meant breaking the rules. Great strategy, huh. · The: second game I would like to talk about is the only Joss which our national champion football team suffered last seaso?·. Mississippi really was not as good a team as they showed on that sweltering S~t~rday afternoon.· m Jackson. Ifthey had been then their Coach Darn Stupid never would have lost hts J~b at the end of the season. How did our (Ooops ... I did it again) superteam ever lose to this group of stiffs? Co~ch Hank Heavenly commented, "Well, er, I just think that our boys gave their best." Not one to gtve ex..: uses. Heavenly continued, "But the thing which really beat us was the heat." Well. next year maybe we should only play games north of the Mason-Dixon line. Finally. I would like to present some well deserved awards to certain basketball personalities. Here they are: Best defensive position on a basketball court-Doug "Dirt" Williamson. Williamson invented thenow famous "Look Out" defense in his freshman year and has proceeded to develop many variations of it. His "!ost recent nuance of this defense is entitled "Ole" and has Williamson doing his impression of a Spamsh Bullfig_hter on _the hardcourt. He performed this defense frequently during any game when he faced a relattvely qmck opponent. This Washington D.C. native will long rembered for his defensiv prowess. Best mime job on ~ basketball court -Dugger Filps. Never one to criticize his players during the co~rs~ of a game, Flips never says a word. One of his players Butcher Fleuers says, "I just love brmgmg my parents to our games because even when I make a mistake I stay in the game and Filps never yells at me. The fact that he never yells has built my confidence tremendously." Fewest appearances at Clnabar's during the season -Jacksonville "Tea" Bullridge. Never on the discos premises during the off-season, this good ole southern boy always hits the sack early before home games. ~e':fest appearances at Corby's -Dill 'Biackshoes' Lamebrain. He is another class-going, bar avotdmg basketball player. A great example for serious-minded students Well those are just a few of my thoughts on the subject of Notre Dame sports of the past; next year should even better.

Instead, the poll showed that 97 percent of the Notre Dame community felt that T~sty Key was the most representative body on campus. Key, taking over for the stricken Bustle, also announced resources due to Bustle's weekly deluge of handouts. 
In the final order of busyness, Aunt Ostal Chairman, John Loonie, fh, announced that Tasty would open up the Rainy Thursday festiv­ities by being in the dunking booth clad only in a small Aunt OstaJ T-shirt. Loonie pointed out that this decision was part of his goal to make Aunt Ostal "bigger and bette th' "
