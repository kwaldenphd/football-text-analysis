"I think Congres~ will he very sup­portive," said House Democratic Leader Jim Wright ofTexas. 

Asked why he thought the Soviets shot the plane down, Under­secretary of State Lawrl'nce Eagleburger said yesterday, "You have to understand the character of the Soviet Union. There is this massive concern for security, there is massive paranoia, and I think this act was simply an expression of those concerns, that excessive con­cern for security." 
Eagleburger, appearing on ABC. TV's "This Week with David Brinkley," dismissed suggestions that the Soviets may have been mis­taken and thought they were shoot­ing at the RC-135.

zoning ordinance that prohibits th~ 
expansion of controlled-use 
businesses that exist within 1000 
feet of a similar establishment. 
South Bend Mayor Roger Parent admitted the permit was a "serious mistake" on the part of the city. Markle resigned his post, con­struction was halted Aug. 11, and the Bauers were ordered to demolish the addition. 
Patrick Bauer has refused to tear down the structure and threatened to sue the city. 

"The city gave us both permits, the foundation permit and the building permit. We were even ap­proved by the board of zoning ap­peals," says Patrick Bauer. 
"This whole thing is very bizarre. I've hired attorneys. Our game plan is, if they can't negotiate equitably, we have nothing else to do but sue the city," he said. 
Richard Heyde, republican nominee for 4th District coun­
"Since Wl' know, for l'xample, that the Sovil't aircraft that shot the planl' down came within two kilometers ofit, that it tkw around it," he said, "I tlnd it very diftkult to bdicve that that pilot could not have known and did not know that it was a civilian aircraft, a 7 4 7 ... 
"If they didn't, there is massive in­competence." 
Emerging from Jhe White House, Wright said a translation of one tape described the Korean airliner as an RC-1.35. But Wright said the chair· man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Vessey, had explained that in the 2 hours the plane was tracked by the Soviet Union as it approached and then entered Soviet airspace, the Soviet pilot should have been able to identify it as a passenRt:r aircraft. 




Bridget's 
cilman, and others, including Slatt, 
have suggested that Patrick Bauer 
may have pulled political strings 
with the Parent administration to 
get the building permit issued. 
"How he got the permit, nobody 
knows," says Slatt. "When we com­
plained, they (the city) did nothing 
for six weeks." 
"When I wrote that letter, 
didn't know they were going to use 
it like that. They said they had all 
kinds of parking. They used it as a 
basis to get the permit," he said. 
Slatt used the survey stakes on the neighboring land of J. Larry Neff to conduct his own property sutdy. Neff, president of Goodwill Industries of Michiana, is planning to occupy a former grocery store located north of the Bauer proper­ty. 

Teresa Bauer says it is "quite possible" that the addition conflict will lead to a suit. Both she and her grother believe the addition conflict will either be resolved or lead to a suit within a few weeks.

Speculation centered on restric­tions to Soviet air travel · such as a two-month suspension on landing rights and on !lights to the Soviet Union. 
The Soviet air line Aerotlot has not been permitted to land in the United States on regularly scheduled tlights for nearly two years, hut other na­tions could limit these rights and Reagan could cut oft· the special Soviet tlights to New York and Wash­ington that have been allowed. 
The president huddled for more than two hours with six congres­sional leaders, along with top foreign policy .md national security advisers. 
Hinting that Reagan would seek steps involving other nations, House Speaker Tlwmas P. O'Neill said: "this isn't the United States versus Russia. This is the world opposed to Russia." 
Others at the meeting, including Baker, R-Tenn., and Senate '\1inority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., used nearly identical language. 
"There was a broad consensus of what could be done. The president hasn't come to any conclusions," O'Neill said. "We've got to get the cooperation of the free nations of

Student Activities Night 

119 groups display their stuff tonight 
By SCOTT HARDEK 
Senior StaffReporter 
"Activities Night is not just for freshmen anymore" might be con­sidered the motto for tonight's an­nual display of campus clubs and organizations. 
Over 100 groups will be represented at the Stepan Center from 7-10 p.m. at this year's Ac­tivities Night. Organizers stress that upperclassmen interested in getting information about any campus organization should attend, along with all interested freshmen. 
Students from Saint Mary's are welcome to attend if interested,
