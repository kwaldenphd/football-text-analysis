Off-campus students can apply for aid 

by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame students living off-campus may be eligible for food stamps provided they meet normal federal requirements. 
Arthur Kopec, director of the food stamp program for St. Joseph County, pointed out that students of limited means and income can apply to the food stamp division in South Bend for financial help to pay for food. 
"We treat the student no differently from anybody else, " Kopec said. "They meet the same criteria as anyone else." 
To qualify for the program a household of students must possess assets not ex­ceeding $1500. The income of the household must not exceed the monthly limit set by the federal government for a given number of individuals in the household. For example, the maximum monthly income for a household of two is $240. The limit for a household of four is $387. 
Kopec warned that students must be able to verify their ned for the funds. Once the students have certified their financial need with one of Kopec's eight case workers, the food stamp agency contacts the parents of the students. The parents are asked about their contriubtion to the tuition and living expenses of the student. If this notarized parental statement verifies the need of the student, the household is eligible for food stamps. 
Kopec , a 1957 Notre Dame graduate, noted that already this year seven or eight students have .been denied food stamps because parents have either failed to verify the studetns' assets or agreed to supplement their income. He warned that applicants face prosecution if they falsely report their funds. 
"We would like the students to be honest," said Kopec. " This is a federal program. If they don't give us correct information, they can be prosecuted for fraud by the local prosecutor." 
Kopec emphasized that only off-campus students could be eligible for food stamps. Individuals residing in dormitories, boarding -houses, or hotels do not qualify. 
Last year Kopec estimates that about 125 Notre Dame students were certified to receive food stamps. Figures for this year wtre not available. 
When asked if he thought students should be prohibited from receiving food stamps, Kopec declined to comment. He did wish to see the program limited to married students only. 
Fr. James Shilts, director of off-campus residence, expresses similar sentiments. However, he believes that if the student truly needs food stamps, he should have them. 
"Married students are frequently in need of food stamp support and there may be some unmarried students, I don't know," said Shilts. "If there are some unmarried students, they must truly qualify as indigent to qualify for the program." 


Whereabouts of Barnard still unknown 
by Zenon Bidzinski Staff Reporter 
FBI officials and Mishawaka Police have been unable, as of last night, to discover any new leads concerning the whereabouts of Thomas J. Barnard, the supposedly abducted Notre Dame graduate student. According to Mishawaka Police, FBI officials have taken over the case, but they are being aided by the Mishawaka force in this area. 
Barnard, 23, of 536'-h W. Mishawaka Ave., disap­peared Tuesday morning after an apparent burglary of his home. His wife, Nancy, reported the burglary at 
2:40p.m., claiming that three pieces of jewelry were taken. A note apparently from Barnard was found at O'Hare Airport later that night. 
Signed in Barnard's name, the note read: "I was taken from my apartment this morning and forced to rent a car to O'Hare. He is six feet, dark, slender, short dark hair. He has escaped from somewhere. He is making me charge two tickets. I don't know where yet." 
The ND brand of 
security: what's 
Chicago Police said Barnard purchased two tickets to Colorado Springs on Continental flight No. 39. Barnard, however, may have never gone to Colorado Springs. An FBI official in Denver told the Observer that, contrary to earlier reports, there has been no indication yet that Barnard landed at Peterson Field in Colorado Springs or that he even flew through the state. 
An FBI spokesman in Indianapolis stated ~·we don't know where he's at yet. There were two plane tickets purchased, but we don't know if Barnard was on the plane. That's what we're in the process of in­vestigating right now." 
The Indianapolis branch of the FBI, according to the spokesman, is the controlling office in this in­vestigation. The offices in South Bend, Chicago, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Los Angeles are also carrying out investigations, another FBI source said. 
None of these offices, however, would reveal any 
detail information. FBI policy forbids the release of 
information concerning an investigation while the 
investigation is still pending. 
According to a UPI release, officials indicated that 
there was some chance the kidnapping wa a hoax, but 
they were proceeding on the assumption that it was 
real. It also stated that Barnard apparently had no 
personal or school problems and that officials are 
wondering how he found time to write the note. 
FBI officials said they have not received any com­
munication from or about Barnard but refused to 
comment on whether his wife or family had been 
notified. 
Barnard's wife, Nancy, 23, refused to comment on 
her husband's apparent abduction. She is residing at 

Barnard 

as a graduate in the MBA program. For the last month he has been assisting Professor John Beverly and Professor Yeandel with their computerwork. 
Both professors have a high opinion of him. Beverly stated, "Tom is a very bright, friendly, outgoing youngster. He is energetic and extremely capable. He is also quite well adjusted and always seemed happy," he added. "I like him very much and all those who know him like him." 
Yeandel described Tom as an extremely competent student with a "very good head and a keen, sharp

New Orleans-District Attorney Jim Garrison and two amusement company executives were found innocent Thursday of taking bribes to protect the city's pinball industry. Garrison said later the trial was only the beginning of Justice Department harrassment against him due to his criticism of the federal government and contention that former President John F. Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy. 
Washington-The House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation Thursday granting President Nixon broad powers to negotiate new trade agreements, but tying his hands in dealing with Communist countries until they liberalize their emigration policies. 
Washington-The administration's military program had its second close call in as many days Thursday as the Senate defeated an effort to slow down the Trident submarine project by a mere two votes. Still another test was on tap--a new effort to reduce U.S. troop strength overseas. 
Chicago--Teacher arrests in Highland, Ind., and defiance of a court order in Detroit Thursday marked continued wrangling over contracts between teachers and schools that kept about 350,000 children out of school across the nation.

Security  comparable to SIZe 
by Gary Allietta Staff Reporter 
Third of three parts 
How does Notre Dame security stack up against that of other schools? 
Compared with the other colleges surveyed, ND ranks as a small school, but is staffed and equipped comparably to schools twice our size. 
For instance, Ball State, with a total enrollment of 18,000, has a force of 34 people including radio dispatchers. Notre Dame has about 8500 students and a security department of 32, including dispatchers and gate guards. 
Western Michigan has a seven vehicle motor squad to patrol their 20,000 student campus. This ratio is comparable to our three car unit, 8500 student campus. However, Western's campus is open and in the heart of Kalamazoo while Notre Dame has a closed, out-of-town campus.

Abortion: Topic of two-day conference

Notre Dame Law Professor Charles Rice called abortion "killing for convenience." San Francisco Attorney Florync~ Kennedy said, "It was for a woman to decide if she wanted to have an ll bQrtion." 
These differing views came at a session of the two-day conference, "Government, the Family and Abortion" which is being held at the Center for Continuing Education, Wednesday and Thursday. The participants in Wednesday night's session at­torneys, were Charles Rice, professor at Notre Dame Law School, Florynce Kennedy, f>lack: feminist from San Francisco, and Roger Ducomb, ranking member of the Indiana HouseCommittee on Human Affairs.

Parsons, 27, formerly of "The Byrds" and "Flying Burrito Brothers" rock groups, died last week, apparently of a heart attack. Two men driving a hearse tricked airline freight personnel into handing over the coffin containing his body. It was found aflame the next morning by campers at Joshua Tree National Monument in the desert. 
Police speculated that the unorthodox cremation was a funeral ritual or an attempt to destroy evidence. 
Martin and Parsons' road manager, Philip Kaufman, 38, who was arrested at his Van Nuys home Wednesday, were charged with grand theft.

Hundreds of St. Louis service station operators closed up shop Thursday to protest the freeze on retail gasoline prices, triggering traffic jams at pumps still open. Other station owners across the country threatened similar mass shutdowns. 
About half of the more than 1,500 gas stations in St. Louis City and County stopped pumping gas at midnight Thursday and said the action would last six days. Extra police were called out to handle traffic tieups as motorists jammed open stations during the early hours of the shutdown.

The Black Student Convention convened at 9:00a.m., September 15, in the LaFortune Student Center. Approximately 60 black students attended the ali-day convention. 
The design of the convention allowed for small group sessions, that were led by students who met and discussed each catalytic paper that was presented. The con­vention was a working convention that allowed recommendations and needs reflective of the com­munity to evolve out of the small group. Some of the recom­mendations were: more extra­curricular activities for minority students, a list of community resources to bedeveloped, black student directory, monthly activity calendar , greater com­munications, life planning workshops, and an evaluative 
system of courses by seniors. 
Perhaps one of the most salient 
issues to evolve out of the con­
vention was the concern over 
campus security. The question 
was raised "do any officers wear 
weapons?" If so, what action can 
be taken to have any officer 
disarmed on this campus. 
Some concerns centered around 
poor campus security-black 
student relationships. One 
recommendation was that all 
campus security be required to 
engage in some human relations 
training to learn how to better 
communicate with minority 
students and students in general. 
Hopefully, such training would 
increase the sensitivity of the 
campus security and improve 
campus security-black student 
relationships. The general mode of 
the group was that while the 
majority of the security guards do 
a good job, there is that minority

The SMC sponsored program was initiated in September, 1970. Since then 220 students from the two campuses participating, Sister 
Alma regards the program as 
being "highly successful." 
Although it was primarily organized for students from the SMC-ND community, other schools including St. Peter's college in Jersey City, New Jersey and Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama have enrolled guest students in the program.

Dpinian The Dangling Conversation 
richmarl:in 
While at a north quad party last weekend, I overheard the following conversation between, what seemed a typical male student and, what seemed a typical co-ed. Because the party also seemed typical, the thought occurred to me that I would be doing the freshmen and transfer students of our community a great service copying down what I overheard. What seemed even a better idea was to delete key names and phrases to allow students to add whatever would be ap­propriate to themselves. So, without further adieu, I present the following as a public service to the student body of Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
Fill in the blanks with appropriate answer. 
GUY-Hi! How are you? CHIC-Pretty good. GUY-My name is (na~e). CHIC-Ohl My name is (name). GUY-What's your major? CHIC-(major). Guy-That's cool. I almost went into that. I'm in (major).

How about (name of another chic)? CHIC-Yeah l She lives down the hall from me. GUY-That's really cool. So (name of another chic, above) lives 
down the hall from you. CHIC-Yep. So, what year are you? GUY-(year at school). (If not older than chic, expect conversation 
to end quickly.) 
SILENCE 

GUY-Where are you from? CHIC-(name of state or large, major city). GUY-Hey! I know someone from (name of state or large, major 
city. See above.) Do you know (name)? CHIC-No. 
SILENCE 

GUY-Can I get you something to drink? CHIC-Do they have (name of soft drink, i.e. Coke)? GUY-I'll go check. (Later.) I got you a (name of beer, i.e. Bud) . 
They didn't have any (name of soft drink, i.e. Coke). CHIC-Thanks, but I don't drink beer.

Let:t:ers Ta A Lanely Ciad 
the sacrament of being a child 
rever~md rabert t;~riffin 


Sunday morning at eleven o'clock is the hour when the urchins come to worship, and everywhere in the Keenan chapel, there are tiny tots confronting the ancient mysteries of an aging God with hymns they are invited to dance to. There is not an urchin in the crowd who knows there is an Incarnation to be dealt with, nor is there the slightest evidence of a moppet's concern over the Trinitarian dilemma of being One God in Three Divine Persons. Being un­touched in their tottiness by dogma, they will accept any creed you teach them; and if you tell them God is everywhere, they will shake their heads in agreement, as though they had just noticed Him playing tennis with Tinker Bell on their way to Mass. 
A church like ours is a regular old Jonah's whale of an institution, eager to swallow up the hearts and minds of children in the love feasts of belief; whereafter, amidst, the safety of sacraments, the tots can live in the security of faith, like minnows swimming around in that fish's tum. In reality, of course, children play the make-believes of faith; they are like the lunches poised on the monster's teeth, resisting by their in­nocence the crunch of jaws that would assimilate them into the faith of the com­munion of saints. 
Our faith is such a complexity of rituals and creeds ; of birth and re-birth; of the various kinds of sin: original, venial, and mortal; of redemption and atonement; and of graces, actual and sanctifying and prevenient. Our faith is such a bloody dogmatic mess, hovering between Pelagian optimism and Calvinistic gloom, that we adults know faith is not a child's game at all. 
We can make children say they believe in the faith that is received from apostles and taught by bishops. With great politeness, they will recite the catechism lessons, and assure us that they believe those lessons, and be sure themselves, in fact, that they really do. But in honesty, they can't believe whatthey don't understand; and in truth we shouldn't want them to. 
touching the heart of children 
Nevertheless, God does touch the heart of children, although the mystery to me is the depth at which He touches them. Among the urchins I have loved, I think of tiny Christina, aged four, weeping at the foot of the altar_ because the priest had not given her the Jesus-bread. I do not know the depth of Eucharistic insight that were revealed in that moppet's tears, and I don't think she herself could have told me the source of her longing to receive the bread of Christ. But her grief seemed too sharp, her need too real, to dismiss it as a tykish wish to imitate the ritual of grownups. 
I think of Frankie, at age six the demon of the neighborhood who could make strong policemen tremble, telling me why he liked to receive Holy Communion. "It's like when you're hungry," he said, "and you go to communion; and afterwards, you're just not hungry any more." I could disbelieve this child who told me of the feeding of hunger that seemed almost mystical; but if I really accept the reality of the feast of glory, I don't really know why !should. 
Yet,just when one is ready to believe that all children are mystics of the Eucharist, he hears a story of misdeeds at the Urchins' Mass; and on the floor of the chapel, a communion is found, its edges turned up from the dampness of a child's tongue. Apparently that child, hoping for a 
flavor of sweetness as in a cookie, found only a taste like paper on his tongue, and spit it out, in ignorance of the Lord of sweetness to whom the bread belonged. 
It is impossible for an old-fashioned cleric like myself to hear of irreverence towards the Blessed Sacrament, no matter how innocently it happens, without being horrified. The responsibility of caring for the Blessed Sacrament was entrusted to me at ordination; and if I sometimes share that responsibility with parents, they must love the Eucharist enough to guard it against the innocent ignorance of urchins who accept faith, without understanding why, from their fathers and mothers. 
Of course, part of the poignancy of one's faith in the Eucharist is the very fragility of the bread that is the sign of the Lord's presence. It breaks and flakes at one's fingertips; and crumbs of it are forever falling off on the floor or the altar cloth, and getting lost. It would seem that the Lord should be wise enough to wrap His sacrament in plastics that could dissolve in the mouth. But, the theologians tell us, the accidents of the bread itself -its taste, color, and wheaten odor and taste -are only the elements bearing witness to the Lord's gift. If the bread crumbles, it is these elemental accidents, and not the Lord's glory, that lie in flakes on the chapel floor. 
sacramental accidents 
At last Sunday's Mass, there were sacramental accidents when we used, in place of the conventional hosts, altar breads made according to recipes received from the Benedictines. Afterwards, one anxious parent went around the chapel gathering up crumbs that the urchins had allowed to topple. "I've received communion three times," he said, "from the Eucharist !found on the floor." I felt torn apart with shame at the news, because if all my efforts at children's liturgies are going to result in a lost reverence for the Blessed Sacrament, then I have cheated urchins of their Catholic heritage. I remembered Dorothy Day, after a Mass said by Father Berigan at the Catholic Worker, on her aging knees, gathering up the Eucharistic crumbs that had fallen from the altar of sacrifice. Her faith was the faith of an old-fashioned Catholic; and when it comes to the Eucharist, God spare me the burden of a progressive faith. 
So this Sunday, with the help of a few dinner rolls and a few tins of sardines, we at the urchin'sMass will donthe lesson of the loaves and the fishes. We shall especially remember how, at theend of that picnic, all the fragments were gathered up in baskets, so that nothing at that feast was lost. 
I am not sure how much I can teach the urchins about the reality of s&craments. I am not certain how deeply God touches their hearts in these recondite matters. of faith. I am not sure how much the urchins ever understand any of the mysteries they assent to with politeness, and sometimes, cheering. 
But I think they can understand the im­portance of gathering up fragments, so that nothing ... absolutely nothing at all ... will ever be lost. 
I think that my urchins, come to worship, care enough about Jesus so that they will keep His sacrament from being lost. I think Jesus depends upon urchins living at all ages in the childhood of faith to see to it that there are no lost sacraments, just as there are no lost urchins.

Chicago Stadium concerts 

By the way, tickets for the Moody Blues concert October 30 and 31 went on sale for $6.50, $5.50, and $4.50 last Saturday. The only problem is that you have to go to Chicago Stadium box office to get them. At last report, the first show and two-thirds of the second arealready sold out, but perhaps a few fleet-footed Blues freaks will be able to pick up the leftovers. Also, the next Monday night Traffic will be in the Chicago also. Tickets should be still available.

We have been stereotyped in our image just as long as you have and the battle out of our super masculine ivory towers is a difficult task. Here at Notre Dame the first to allow women into the tradition of an all male university is hard on everyone for there is much to be destroyed before we build up again. Above all, be positive in all your actions, but be firm. Now that we are breaking down the stupid, thoughtless castes of male and female, let us replace it with something good and distinctively Christian. Notre Dame, one of the all time bastions of male chauvinism, has the potential to be one of the leaders in the new society of equality. Where there exists such

Sailing is Notre Dame's unknown collegiate sport 
(continued from page 3) 
Sailing would be heard of. Notre Dame--one of the charter members of the now 42 school Midwest Collegiate Sailing Association -is a respected team in competition all over the country. 
Its history isn't really known even to its members--who keeps records of a sport called sailing? Recent history is all that is left. 
Start with the end of one era, 1970. The name-Richie Doyle, Notre Dame's unknown All­American. Believe it or not, sailing does have All-Americans, National Rankings, and National Championships. Only 14 sailors throughout the country are selected each year as all ­Americans. Doyle made it in 1968, 1969 and in 1970. For 3 years he was racing team captain at Notre Dame. In 1968 he was commodore of the Midwest Collegiate Sailing Association. He led Notre Dame to the number one seed in the Mid­west. Notre Dame was ranked 4th in the nation in 1970, though few realized it. Most notably, Doyle was named "Collegiate Sailor of the Year" for the country in 1970, from a school that doesn't seem to know that sailing even exists. 
1970 also saw Notre Dame as the Midwest representative in the Kennedy Cup, held in 44' yawls at Annapolis. Tim Flood skippered the Notre Dame team. 
1971-A repeat by Flood in the Kennedy Cup. He was also elected as commodore of the MCSA. Notre Dame Football had its 4 Horsemen, the sailing team saw the begining of 3 sophomores who were to become known as the Big 3­-Will Donelan, George Gaw, and Kevin Hoyt. Hoyt and Gaw became racing team captain in successive years. All 3 eventually won the Notre Dme Yachtsman of the Year Award. 
Spring, 1972--Notre Dame just missed the chance to go to the Nationals. 
Fall,1972--The last year for the Big 3-the end of another era. Notre Dame goes to California for the Douglas Cup, a collegiate 
~ 
. match racing championship. Notre Dame shows team depth, and no longer ·is a team which hitches to regattas because of a lack of members or cars. 
Spring, 1973--the past--a good 

year. Notre Dame placed in the 
top 3 in all regattas except the big 
one--Midwest Champs. Notre 
Dame sends a women's team to 
Womens Midwest Champs. 
They weren't first,but what other 
sport at Notre Dame 
lets girls compete im­

tercollegiately both on the regular 
team and as a women's team. 
Fall, 1973--the present--same commodore, same captain, same lake, same team, same obscurity. 
Hopefully, it will be a past which can be remembered-one in which people will say they knew about the Notre Dame Sailing Team. 
a new awareness 

Just what is the Notre Dame Sailing Team? Actually it is a club and a team. Its purpose is to spread the sport of sailing to the Notre Dame and St. Mary's students. It "is not just for ex­perienced sailors and racers. Its captain never raced a sailboat until 3 years ago. Its commodore was in the club only a semester before being elected to that office. 
The Notre Dame Sailing Team does not have a coach, a public relations man or unlimited club funds. The ·team captain's position is not one of glory. The captain must run practices, determir~ who will sail in the regattas, and motivate the ream. He has to keep in touch with other schools, and try to have the best team possible to represent Notre Dame. The commodore has many of the same problems. He has to make sure things run smoothly within the club. 
Students can't understand why the sailors are willing to give up going to home football games in order to sail. They don't realize they would rather be one of 4 to 10 Notre Dame sailors at a regatta rather than one of 60,00 Notre Dame fans packed in the stadium on a Saturday afternoon, sup­posedly upholding Notre Dame's athletic tradition to the highest degree. 

Students don't understand why they give free lessons to their members who don't know how sail. 
You don't have to be big and strong to sail. The captain of th Notre Dame Sailing Team probably looks the least like a person involved in a sport on this campus. At 5'4" and 140 lbs., that isn't the conception most people have of Notre Dame athletes.

SANTIAGO (UPI) -Chile's tough military junta executed a former mayor by firing squad Thursday and ordered another opponent put to death in crackdowns against supporters of ousted Marxist President Salvador Allende. 
The newspaper La Segunda, in a report approved by military censors, said German Castro, former mayor of the city of Talca during Allende's government, was executed for shooting at a policeman. 
The newspaper said Castro was put to death' in Talca, 150 miles south of Santiago, by an army firing squad. 
A military court in Quillota, 80 miles north of Santiago, Thursday ordered a firing squad death for Teobaldo Saldivar on charges of attack­ing a police post Sept. 17. The court did not say when he would be put to death. 
The four-man junta, which ousted President Salvador Al­lende in a military coup Sept. 11, has warned snipers they would be executed if caught.

SMC President urges passage of amendment 

by Melissa Byrne Staff Reporter 

"I urge the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment in Indiana because it would be a good sym­bolic gesture and good educational therapy for men and women," said Dr. Edward L. Henry, President of St. Mary's College in SMC's Carroll Hall Thursday evening, September 27. 
Henry was one of four par­ticipants in a panel discussion entitled "From the Voting Rights Amendment to the Equal Rights Amendment." The other panelists included Sandra Hojnacki, Janet Allen, and Sally Beard. 
Henry views a change in social attitudes toward women as most important in the fight for Equal Rights. He emphasized the vital 
Navy secretary dismisses charges 
by Edward K. DeLong Washington UPI 

Navy Secretary John W. Warner 
Thursday  dismissed  charges  of  
mutiny,  aiding  the  enemy  and  
other  prison  camp  misconduct  

against two high-ranking former prisoners of war despite evidence he said was strong enough to warrant legal proceedings. 
Instead Warner publicly cen­sured the two men claiming they failed to meet the standards ex­pected of officers" during their imprisonment in North Vietnam and ordered them retired "in the best interests of the naval ser­vice." 
Military sources said Warner made his decision reluctantly to avoid "a long, ugly court fight" he feared would hurt all returned POWs. Some military men said privately they objected to the action because it robbed the Code of Conduct of legal a1.1thority. 
Warner said through a Pentagon spokesman he had received suf­ficient evidence to warrant action

Senate votes to return troops 
By WARREN L. NELSON 
WASHINGTON (UPJ) -In an at times raucus nighttime session, the Senate Thursday voted to order the administra­tion to bring 110,000 U.S. troops 
home  from  abroad  within 2 lh  
years.  
The vote  was  48 to  36.  
Just  30  hours  earlier  the  

Senate had voted against a proposal to order 200,000 troops brought home although six hours before that it had voted to bring the 200,000 home. 
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D­Minn., sponsor of Thursday's successful amendment, said it was aimed at troops "primarily and entirely in the Pacific and scattered areas" rather than Europe, and thus would not tie the hands of the Administration as It enters talks on mutual troop cutbacks in Europe with the Soviet Union. 
However, Congressional ob­servers said the Humphrey amendment would undoubtedly be killed in a conference committee with the House and would never enter the law. 
Earlier the Senate, near the halfway pofnT in--consideration of a $21.9 billion military procurement authorization bill, role schools can play in changing these attitudes. 
Asked what SMC can do to change cultural attitudes, Henry replied, "We can provide op­portunities for women to know themselves." He continued, "In this formative period of their lives some girls do not care to be in competition with boys." 
"Equality is not achieved simply by the existence of proper laws and executive orders. It is now a matter of changing cultural at­titudes so that sanctions do not have to be relied on to achieve equal treatment," asserted Henry. 
Henry acknowledged the possible d~feat of the Equal Rights Amendment. "But the day of salvation is at hand despite the possible defeat.. .One should not overlook the steady erosion in 
against Marine Lt. Col. Edison W. Miller, 41, of Tustin, Calif., and Navy Capt. Walter E. Wilber,43,of Columbia Crossroads, Pa. 
But he said he decided against presenting the evidence to the military equivalent of a grand jury because any benefits of legal ac­tion would be "more than offset" by the resulting exposure of other POWs to interrogation about their lives in captivity. 
Warner's action left prison camp misconduct charges pending against four enlisted men, but Pentagon sources said it appeared unlikely the charges would be pursued. 
Miller and Wilber the only two ex-POW officers accused of prison camp misconduct--were fighter pilots who expressedantiwar views in captivity. Wilber said in April he made statements against the war for the North Vietnamese without undergoing torture.

Opponents of the Humphrey amendment hammered at the Minnesotan with ridicule and succeeded in flustering him while creating something of a carnival atmosphere. Hum­phrey often wrongly quoted his own proposal. 
When Humphrey explained that under his amendment Guam, the American possession in the West Pacific, was considered home territory and troops could be pulled back to that island, Sen. Russell Long, D-La., brought laughter to the packed chamber by shouting,

discrimmatory practices that is now occurring." 
Henry sees milestones for women's rights evident in em­ployment practices, divorce and marriage laws, and in equality of education. He noted a correlation between rising educational levels of women and their self-assurance in politics. 
He quoted a 1972 Newman Committee study which reviewed the role of women in higher education. "Discrimination against women is the only socially acceptable form of discrimination left in America," concluded Henry. 
"There has been a wide gulf between theory and practice in American democracy. The movement toward equality in this country has been a torturous and long one for women." 
Sandra Hojnacki, a panelist representing the League of Women Voters, also advocates the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. She cited Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, and Sissy Farenthold, President of the National Women's Political Caucas, as examples of women utilizing rights already achieved. Chisholm and Farenthold were both recent speakers on the campuses of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. 
Janet Allen, another panelist and South Bend city councilman-at­large, disagreed with Henry Hojnacki. "The solution .to the problem of equal rights for women is not another law." 
Allen believes personal con­victions are more beneficial in achieving equal rights than an unenforced law. "A woman's place is wherever she wants to be." 
She urges young women in­terested in political careers to start early, fill one or two terms in one office, and continue upward. "Now is the time to let the men know you want to work with them, not against them," Allen declared. 
Sally Beard, another panelist, representing the Daughters of the American Revolution, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. "We often look to the Federal Govern­ment to solve problems we can solve ourselves," Beard suggested. 
She cited possible implications of all-women schools for the past 7 the Equal Rights Amendment. "If years, I find myself with the this amendment is passed, our disadvantage of a false sense of daughters will be drafted as our security. At school your rights are

Gov. Evans elected 
Chairman 
By JACK WILKINSON 
POINT CLEAR, Ala. <UPI) -Gov. Melvin H. Evans of the Virgin Islands became the first black to serve as chairman of the Southern Governors Confer­ence Wednesday when he was named to succeed Alabama Gov. George Wallace. 
Evans' unanimous elevation from vice chairman came in the closing minutes of the 39th annual conference in which the Southern governors demanded that the Nixon administration include the states in any national plan to ease the energy shortage. 
Gov. Reubin Askew of Flori­da, widely mentioned as a possible Democratic presiden­tial candidate in 1976, was elected vice chairman and automatically will move up to the chairmanship next year. He was unopposed after Texas Gov. Dolph Briscoe pulled out. 
of SGC 
Evans said he anticipated no problems as the first black to head the Southern governors "I have been the first black in so many things before I suppose the novelty has worn off." 
In their energy policy resolu­tion, the governors decided priorities in the event of any kind of fuel rationing. They also pictured improved technology as "our only hope for meeting the long term energy crisis, mitigating environmental ef­fects and maintaining our strategic international post­ure." 
The governors also approved resolutions condemning the practice of federal fund im­poundments, calling for in­creased offshore deepwater port exploration and a more equitable policy of disbursing water pollution control funds.

Ara. Agase renew past rivalry 
by Vic Dorr Sports Editor 

Only once during the past 10 vears has Alex Agase gotten a orofessional break from Ara 
'arseghian, his coaching com­natriot. 
That one instance came in 1964, when Parseghian gave up the head .:oaching job at Northwestern and moved 100 miles down the toll road ~o South Bend. Ara's departure for .IJotre Dame ieft a vacancy in the .:oaching ranks at Evanston, and 
\gase was named to fill the empty position. 
Since then, the two have had an <>n-the-field relationship that has oeen heavily weighted in Notre Dame's favor. The two have been 11n opposing sidelines in Notre Dame-Northwestern games seven !imes since the '64 shuffle, and Notre Dame's record in those seven games is 7-o. . 
-
Saturday, Alex Agase and Ara Parseghian will again face each 
other from opposing sidelines, but 
this time each will have a clean 
slate. 
Agase has inherited the head coaching reins of Purdue's Boilermakers, and Parseghian's Irish will clash with the Boilers tomorrow at 12:50 p.m., in a nationally televised contest from West Lafayette. 
But after the first two weeks of the '73 season, this Agase­Parseghian reunion has been given the overtones of years past. Agase's Boilers will bri!!g a 1-1 record into the game. The loss came last week: a 24-19 upset at the hands of Miami of Ohio, and the victory came the week before: a 14-3 decision over Wisconsin at Madison. 
The Irish, on the other hand, come into the game 1-0, after an impressive 44-0 home opener against Northwestern. Par­seghian 's squad is also the healthier of the two. The Irish escaped their run-in with Nor­thwestern with no serious injuries, and will start the same 22 players in Saturday's confrontation with Purdue. The Boilers, though, haven't been so fortunate. 
Wide receiver (and Olympic sprinter) Larry Burton sprained his right shoulder during last week's loss to Miami, and is ex­

And Agase, who has seen his best Northwestern teams terrorized by Irish squads of p<.ist ye~rs, is taking a dim view of Notre Dame's statistical and medical ad­vantages. 
"Each player is different and 
· each case is different," observed the veteran coach, "but injuries and the lack of them will deter­mine quite a bit of the success we hve or don't have. 
"Against Notre Dame, now, we'll be facing a team with the same power they've always had, but with the speed to go with it in <Eric) Penick and (Art) Best. (Tom) Clements is now an established quarterback and he really understands their offense. He throws well on the run and is a good runner. This gives them the opportunity to use those option plays where Clements can either run or pass. He can hurt you both ways. 
"They are," Agase concluded, "one of the top teams in college football." 
But despite their own 1-1 record, Agase's Boilermakers aren't exactly cellar-dwellers. Purdue was hit hard by graduation last spring, but returns several blue­chip ball-players on offense and defense. 
Capri a <6-3, 181) if healthy, linebacker Rick Schavietello (6-1, 
213) and sophomore end Ken Novak (6-7, 263) will anchor the Boilermaker defense,and a core of returnees are the nucleus of the Purdue attack. 
Senior quarterback Bo Bobrowski (6-2, 199), and junior halfback Skip Peterson salvaged some Boilermaker pride in last year's meeting between the two clubs by scoring a pair of second half touchdowns after ND had built a 35-o lead. They'll be joined tomorrow by junior tight end Barry Santini (6-4, 222) and senior wide receiver Danny Roman (5-11, 182). 
"Our defense played well again for the second week in a row," said Agase after the Miami upset. "But we taxed them once too often because of mistakes. I still say this is a good football team. We must try to regroup now and get ready for Notre Dame. 
"But we've got to cut down on

Notre Dame 44-Northwestern {). Wow,Mom, wow! What a way to start an Irish drive to the 1973 national championship. 
Ever since September 2nd of this year I've been on the sidelines wat­ching the offense and defense develop into one of the most explosive teams in the country. The personality of this Irish football team is much different than that of past years. This team is young and hungry for victory and has the ultimate goal of being rated number one at the end of the college season. 
The team seems to be maturing week by week, and in doing so has developed a confidence which is only felt by champions. The youth is tremendous for a Notre Dame team, but it is blended very smoothly with the experience of some of the top ball-players in the country. I would like to share with you my personal experience with two of these players: Tom Clements and Mike Fanning. 
Tom Clements, who received the offensive award from the coaches, and Mike Fanning, who won the defensive award: both awards were for outstanding play in the Northwestern game. 
_ Tom Clements is from McKee's Rocks, Pa. A very quiet person in public; however, very colorfulamong family and friends. He is reserved, polite, and always courteous to everyone. He is very well-liked by the coaches andplayerson the team, and is a very easy person to get along with. Tom has a very unique talent of being able to lead a team in a quiet way. Apart from his great running and passing, his mere presence makes the team go. It seems that whenever the team needs a big play we all look to Tom to come up with the necessary yeardage. 
I'm sure this point was brought out very clearly against Northwestern when he passed for one TD and scored two himself. In describing Tom, one must also mention his toughness to combat life and accept its short­comings and successes. Tom Clements is truly a Notre Dame man. 
...and looking forward to the upcoming games of this season, Tom, along with the rest of the offensive unit, will be tough to stop. 
On defense we look at Mike Fanning, a 6-6, 258 pound defensive tackle from Tulsa, Okla. To some people off the field he is knowwn as the "gentle giant." lie, too, is a quiet person,and hehas a great con try-western sense of humor. He is an independent person and many people look up to hime for his independence and ability to make his own decisons. 
Mike has had some ups and downs in his college career. However, he has taken his misfortunes and turned them into successes. He has tremendous dedicationto workingout-and being prepared for the football season. Mike likes to run and work during the off-season with the new Nautilus weight machine, and he does so very religiously. 
This dedication has finally paid off and was rewarded last Saturday, when Mike spent the afternoon in the back pocket of Mr. Mitch Anderson, Northwestern's QB. Mike has clearly, by his personality of in­dependence, become a leader. And by his great desire and determination he has become one of he best at his position . 
Mike feels that the defensive team is the most well-rounded unit since 1970 and promises many more Saturdays like last Saturday. Congratulations, Mike, and keep up the good work. 
A young, but experienced team--with players like Tom Clements and Mike Fanning~ Notre Dame's opponents should beware, for a silent giant is ready to take hold and become one of the national football powers of the 1973 season.
