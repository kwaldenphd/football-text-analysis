ND responds to calls for sustainability 
New office, clubs promote the University's effort to conserve energy

News Writers 
Editor's Note: This is the first installment of a multi-part series examining sustainabiiity at Notre Dame. 
Sustainability -a word that's here to stay at Notre Dame. 
The University launched an entire office dedicated to the mat­ter in January, a new "green" issues student organization gained approval as an official club this summer, and today's Notre Dame Forum is devoted to sus­tainable energy. 
University President Father John Jenkins told faculty mem­bers in his annual Faculty Address Sept. 16 that he is "eager to give special attention to this problem" through the Forum, academics and other initiatives on campus. 
"We must strive, as a communi­ty, to make a practical response to the energy challenge in our lives and on our campus," Jenkins said. 
Indeed, making a response to calls for sustainability is a grow­ing theme at many universities. A variety of publications, including The Princeton Review, have recently begun to evaluate sus­tainability on college campuses, further evidence of the issue's growing importance not just in the classroom, but also on the campuses themselves. 
"For better or for worse, sus­tainability is a mainstream thing now," said the Director of the University's new Office of Sustainability, Jim Mazurek. 
Formalizing initiatives, centralizing efforts 
With various groups emphasiz­ing sustainability -both within the University community and outside -Notre Dame's recent actions reflect recognition of that recent shift. 
But the creation of the Office of Sustainability last January was also in part a response to a need that has grown over the past decade, Mazurek explained. 
"Frankly, what the University lacked ... was a centralized administrative focus on sustain­ability. Many departments have been doing individual actions and initiatives but the University was missing the structure, focus and coordination," Mazurek said. 
University Vice President for Operations Jim Lyphout added: "A number of the units throughout the University have been involved in conservation and sustainability efforts throughout the years," Lyphout said, citing recycling efforts that began almost 15 years ago. 
But, he also said "the effort lacked coordination and commu­nication." 
see FORUM/page 6 


What is sustainability anyway? 
The need for sustainable energy is an issue that "isn't going to go away," according to GreeNO presi­dent Lourdes Long. But what does the term "sustainable energy" mean? 
According to Forum co-chair­man Frank Incropera, sustainable energy, on a global level, means "to get into a pattern of energy uti­lization this is sustainable for hun­dreds ifnot thousands of years." 
Getting into this pattern of sus­tainability is important for its envi­ronmental consequences. 
"If you accept the fact that cli­mate change is real, then using fossil fuels in the way we've been using them will have conse­quences to the environment that don't bode well for sustainability," Incropera said. 
Achieving sustainability on a universal scale isn't something that's going to happen overnight, he said. 
"The goal is to get to your grand­children to a point that allows for them economic development opportunity with a more benign economic impact," Incropera said. 
Within the Notre Dame commu­nity, sustainability is all about bal­ancing priorities, according to Jim Mazurek, the Director of the Office of Sustainability. 
"We define sustainability as con­sidering the present and future needs of the University, balancing both environmental and economic considerations," Mazurek said. "At Notre Dame, this means weav­ing sustainability principles into all we do -our institutional decision­making, operational practices, and built environment."

INSIDE COLUMN 

On pictures and statuses 
Darling Facebookers. 

As I said last week. our problems on Facebook are numerous and varied. I have returned this week to address a difl'erent set of problems. I hope that you have cur­
tailed your wall  Kaltlyn Conway  
malpractices  
since then, and  Scene Writer  
that you are  
ready to learn  

about a nnw set of problems. 
This week, we shall address the issues inherent in status updates and profile pictures. 

Oh, the status update. The epitome of letting your closest friends and the people who don't even know you in on the details of your life. But some­times, people just take it too far. Kids, I don't want to see the details of your messy breakup on my status feed. I don't need to know what you're doing every five seconds. There arc fine lines here between acceptable and unacceptable. 
For example: if you must angst in your status, use song lyrics. It's aeceptable if the song is stuck in your head, especially if it describes how you FEEL. What's even bettnr is if it's obscure song lyrics that make me perhaps wonder what exactly it is you have been doing to make a moment a crime. If you truly feel the need to express your angst, keep it general ­your dose friends ean ask about it, and th1~ rest of us apathetic folks can just keep on going on with our days without wondering why random so­and-so is all upset. 
Now, I know we discussed what to not to do on a wall when orw is ... h mm ... not in one's best state of mind. It is, however. perf'eetly accept­able to update your status in this stallL We all like seeing your random choiee of grammar and your mean­ingless words that can be blended into awesome nicknames. It's amus­ing. We, the pnople, like to be amused. 
That being said, the most accept­able form of status -other than something you're actually doing that isn't updated every hour with the same thing or a slight variation-is something witty. Make me laugh, peo­ple. Say something completely ridicu­lous, or something clever, or some­thing thoughtful. Keep the masses entertairwd. 
That said. there are other f'aetors of your profile that also nm~d to be kept dassy. Like your profile picture. 
Folks, WilY. in the name of all that is good and holy, would you want a picture of you in a bikini or you, well, not in the right state of mind, on your profile? This trend baflles me. It is a bane to Facebook. Keep it to pictures of' you and your friends -maybe your pet, or even your car. But at least keep it dassy-and keep it real. There are all sorts of creepers out there-don't encourage them! What is the appeal of a non-classy picture, anyhow? Do you want every­one to think of you as swimsuit-clad or drunk out of your mind, and that bn the only faent of you they know? I didn't think so. 
So keep your statuses entertaining, and your pictures classy. Use this wis­dom to create a better tomorrow... on

asked the audience to think about the staunch differences between John McCain and Barack Obama. 
"The candidates have opposing philosophies and policy recommen­dations on the economy, health care, and national security," she said. 
Bennion explained how Obama wants to increase taxes on people that make over $600,000 per year while McCain wants to cut taxes for the same people. 
"As women, the abortion issue obviously effects us but deeper than that there is the Equal Pay Act that gives women the opportunity to receive the same pay as men," Bennion said. "Obama supports it, McCain does not." 
Bennion said she wanted to dis­courage people from thinking their vote wouldn't count because they are just one person. 
"Voting is a right that many citi­zens throw away and take for grant­ed without thinking of all the people who fought for their right to vote," she said. 
She also stated that wearing an "I

Every Tuesday through Election Day, Saint Mary's will host events aimed to inform students about the issues of the election.

Clitheroe's new position is important because freshmen serving on class council are always in need of some guidance, according to Sophomore Class President Cynthia Weber. 
"Freshman Class Council has been assembled, but peo­ple don't really know what they're doing," she said. 
Weber said that in her own experiences as a member of Freshman Class Council last year, the former sophomore advisor, Jeff Lakusta, helped to keep the group focused. 
"In a friendly way, he shot down some of our dumber 

ble goals,

Following Clitheroe's confir­mation, the council discussed the new "What's the Deal with... ?" question series that will be conducted by the stu­dent outreach committee. The series is designed to "dispel some myths about the bigger mysteries of the University that really don't need to be bigger mysteries, but it's just that no one has ever explained them," student body president Bob Reish said. 
Reish proposed topics including how the commence­ment speaker is chosen, what the actual rules regarding Breytopia are and how DART times are chosen for the series. 
Reish said that the plan for the series is "to ask whoever's in charge of [a particular issue] and summarize it in layman's terms." 
Junior class president Kim Kyroac said that she liked the question series idea, but that she didn't know how students are going to hear the answers. Reish suggested several options to disseminate the information, including buying an advertisement in The Observer and sending weekly e-mails to students. 
Reish said that he doesn't anticipate problems getting cooperation from the University on this project. "University officials don't mind informing students about this stuff," he said. "Informing students and being transparent is what [Student Body Vice President] Grant [Schmidt] and I are all about."

Teenage Finnish gunman kills I 0 
KAUIIAJOKI, Finland -A chilling YouTube video with a young man firing a pistol and warn­ing "You will die next" caught the eye of police, who questioned him but then let him go, saying they didn't have enough evidence to take away his weapon. 
On Tuesday, he walked into a vocational col­lege, the School of Hospitality, and opened fire, killing 10 people and burning their bodies with fimbombs before shooting himself fatally in the head. At least two other people were wounded. 
The rampage bore eerie similarities to another school massacre in Finland last year in which an 18-year-old gunman killed eight people and himself. Both gunmen posted violent clips on YouTube prior to the shootings, both were fasci­nated by the 1999 Columbine school shootings in Colorado. both attacked their own schools and both died after shooting themselves in the head. 
China's milk supply contaminated 
BEIJING -The note posted in July on the Web site of China's food safety inspection agency came from a doctor: There had been a sudden rise in infants turning up at his hospital with kidney stones after drinking the same brand of formula. 
The warning, which urged an investiga­tion, went unheeded. In the two weeks since China began piecemeal reporting about con­tamination of the milk supply, a picture has emerged of official indifference, greed and government dysfunction. 
Among the startling details: the practice of adulterating milk was widely known in the industry, and one dairy knew since late last year that its formula was sickening children. 
The revelations have dismayed a broad segment of the public -parents -who feel the government has breached their trust.

Protesters had arrived by the busload to protest the execution, carrying signs with slogans like "Justice for Troy Davis" and wearing blue T-shirts embla­zoned with "I am Troy Davis."

Palin 111eets her first foreign leaders 


Vice presidential candidate met with Afghan and Colombian Presidents 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -It was a tightly controlled crash course on foreign policy for the Republican vice presi­dential candidate, the mayor-turned-governor who has been outside North America just once. 
Palin sat down with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. The conversations were private, the pictures public, meant to build her resume for voters concerned about her lack of experience in world affairs. 
"I found her quite a capa­ble woman," Karzai said later. "She asked the right questions on Afghanistan." 
The self-described "hock­ey mom" also asked former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for insights on Georgia, Russia, China and Iran, and she'll see more leaders Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings. 

It was shuttle diplomacy, New York-style. At several points, Palin's motorcade got stuck in traffic and New Yorkers, unimpressed with the flashing lights, sirens and police officers in her group, simply walked between the vehicles to get across the street.

The nnw ollieo will serve to pro­
vide necessary structure and 
accountability for the University, 
Mazurek said. 
While sustainability reporl<; may 
have played somn role in his 
Off'iee's formation, Mazurek 
downplayed their importanee. 
"I consider those ratings more 
noise than anything," he said, but 
added that lw recognizes the 
importance of these ratings to 
otlwrs, especially when the grade 
is a D-, the grade given to Notre 
Dame by the Sustainable 
Endowment<; Institute in 2007. 
Aller the University announced thn formation of the Office of Sustainability in January, Marzurek. a Notre Dame gradu­ate, was selected as the Office's din~ctor in May and given an ini­tial $2 million green loan lund to help jumpstart improvements on campus. 
Since his appointment in May, Mazurek assembled a team that indudes two additional full-time stall' members and four student interns, hn said. 
Engineering Professor Frank lneropera, who serves as the 200S Notre Dame Forum eo-chair, said the University was delayed in taking substantive administrative action on sustainability, but its current actions have shown progress. 
"!The University! was slow to idnntily this as an important issue one for which an institutional commitment has to be made," lneropnra said. "But it's been very quick to develop signilieant pro­grams to be good dtizens." 
This late response to the sus­tainability issue is what makes the University's actions all the more import<mt, according to GreeND president Lourdes Long. 
"Notn~ Dame is behind on thi<;," she said. "The Office lof Sustainability) knows that we havn a lot of work to do." 
But Long, a senior, said the University will do a good job in addressing sustainability. 
"When Notre Damn decides to do something, it does it right," she said. 
She also eited the high level of involvement of the trustees and the upper leveL'> of administrative off'icers as a sign that the University is genuine about its eommitment to sustainability. 
Students for Environmental Action (SEA) eo-president Tracy .Jennings, a junior, said the involvement of alumni is critical to the new enthusiasm on campus for sustainability. 
"I would like to think that the University would have always liked to be sustainable and that the ID-1 report card drew a lot of support from the alumni," she said. "It put thi<; issue at the fore­front more than it created the impetus to !take action]." 

Student involvement in sustain­ability 
Student involvement in sustain­
ability and environmental issues 
comes mostly through the groups 
GreeND and SEA, which are 
linked to each other. 
"All these groups work togeth­
er," Long said. "We're in constant 
communication and share leader­
ship." 
But while the 1-,rroups are fight­
ing on the same side, they 
approach the battle with a dilfer­
ent perspective. 
"The thing for GreeND is that 
we really pull together all the 
interests," Long said, citing issues 
such as energy policy, energy 
technology, and recycling that the 
group addresses. 
"GreeND is the University's 
response to make::· campus a

also a GreeND member, said. 
SEA, on the other hand, is a 
social action dub organized out of 
the Center li1r Social Concerns. Its 
focus is more on the environment 
outside the Notre Dame campus' 
bubble. 
"We do community outreach 
like tree planting, river cleanups 
on St. Joseph's River, and dilliwent 
activities outdoors," Jennings 
said. "We need to remember that 
we're part of a bigger communi­
ty." 

"We focus on providing services 
to the greater South Bend com­
munity and on lulfilling the CSC's 
mission for social justice," she 
said. 

SEA also distinguishes itself by focusing on many environmental issues, not just energy, according to Jennings. "SEA has always been more concerned with the holistic view of the environment," she said. 
While SEA has been active at 
Notre Dame for many years, 
GreeNO is a more recent develop­
ment. The group was formed in 
Nov. 2007 and achieved oflicial 
club status in July of this year, 
according to the GreeNO Web site. 
GreeNO is elosely linked with the Office of Sustainability, both by its missions and its work, aecording to Long, who also serves as a student intern at the Ofl'ice. Each group needs the other group to cause any real change. 
"If you think about all these dif­ferent things popping up across (:ampus, a lot of this cqmes from student initiatives," she said. "The administration was right there with us, and that's what made it a success."

IN BRIEF 
Medirnre payed billions in su;pect claims 
WASHINGTON -The government paid more than $1 billion in questionable Medicare claims for medical supplies that showed little relation to a patient's condition, including blood glucose strips for sexual impotence and special diabetic shoes for leg amputees, con­gressional investigators say. 
Billions more in taxpayer dollars may have been wasted over the last decade because the government-run health program for the elder­ly and disabled paid out claims with blank or invalid diagnosis codes, such as a "?" or "zzzzz." Medicare officials say even smiley­face icons could have been accepted. 
The report by Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security investigations subcommit­tee, obtained by The Associated Press, is the latest to detail lax oversight in the $400 billion program that has been cited by government auditors as a high-risk for fraud and waste for nearly 20 years. 
The panel's review of millions of claims sub­mitted by sellers of wheelchairs, drugs and other medical supplies on behalf of Medicare patients from 2001 to 2006 found at least $1 billion in which the listed diagnosis code appeared to have little, if any, connection to the reimbursed medical item. 

Dems to let offshore drilling ban expire 
WASHINGTON -Democrats have decided to allow a quarter-century ban on drilling for oil off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to expire next week, conceding defeat in a months-long battle with the White House and Republicans set off by $4 a gallon gasoline prices this summer. 
House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that a provision continu­ing the moratorium will be dropped this year from a stopgap spending bill to keep the government running after Congress recesses for the election. 
Republicans have made lifting the ban a key campaign issue after gasoline prices spiked this summer and public opinion turned in favor of more drilling. President Bush lifted an executive ban on offshore drilling in July.

How do you sign people's yearbooks? 
Some leave a generic message: "I can't bolieve we made it through a whole year! It's been awesome getting to know you bettor. I hope you keep in touch." 
Others detest the imporsonality of such a message. These protesters domand a higher quality from the yearbook message as an entity and only write in the yoarbooks of thoso for whom they can write a poignant and meaningful note. Yot though the recipient may appreciate this type of message in the end there are costs: pri­marily the cost of the author having to turn people away when they ask, "Hey! Joe! Sign my yearbook!" As the "no" leaves the lips of the yearbook-idealist, Joe will immediately become the big jerk face who sucks (the lesson being that those who think they should take the message high ground are actually just big jerk faces who suck). 
Finally, there aro those among us who choose neither the personal nor the impersonal route to the message. The pressure to write in so many books builds and builds to feverish levels. Constant hounding and cajoling wear down the souls of these poor saps, still holding out on putting pen to paper, until finally they have no choice but to take every book they're handed and write the most superfluous and vacuous four-letter acronym in existence: hags. 
So where do we go from here? Let me reformulate my initial statement. Instead of asking you how you sign people's yearbooks, let me tell you how I sign people's yearbooks. And to do so, I'll employ the best kind of evidence ­anecdotal evidence. 

In late May of my freshman year of high school, as the yearbooks were released, I decided I didn't want my friends to remembnr me as the dull guy, the sentimental guy, or the generically complacent guy. I wanted them to remember me as the funny guy -the guy whose message on which they could look back years from now and say, "Gosh darn it! That Andrew Miller sure was one funny son of a gun!" 
But how to be the funny guy? How could I write such messages so that a majority of my friends (the total number of my friends at that time being no more than ten, just as a point of reference) would recognize the power of my rapier wit'? I realized the only way I could bring about such a reaction would be by mak­ing a reference so clever, so hilarious, they would be hard-pressed not to remember me. 
So then the issue became what is the perfect rderence? It had to be something vaguely recognizable yet obscure enough to be unique. Something outlandishly funny yet with a hint of poignancy. Something ironic yet heart-warming. 
I started thinking about end-of-year themed episodes of various programs and I remembered one that I always admired: the two-part Boy Meets World episode that contains the Mr. Feeney retirement flash-forward ("The War/Seven the Hard Way"). In this hour­long episode, the seven principles allow a prank war to escalate to the point where none of them wants to have any­thing to do with any of the others. During the flash-forward it's revealed that since the prank war, the only two who have remained in contact are the married Corey and Topanga (and they're in cou­ples therapy). Eric shows up as his new personality, the reclusive Plays With Squirrels, and shares with everyone his life's work, a compendium of all his knowledge: Lose one friend, Lose all friends, Lose yourself. 
Suddenly it hit me. Thenl it was. Those three lines. That would be my yearbook message. And I wrote those three linP-s in every singJp, yearbook I sigrwd to friP-nd and foe alike. Lose one friend, Lose all friends, Lose yourself. 
Now many people will diseount this reference as unimportant and too obscure. The nay-sayers will come at me with comments like: "Boy Meets World stopped being good after everyone start­ed attending college. Those arnn 't the classic episodes. Nobody earns about those refernnces." I fervently disagreo. The show became infinitely funnier as the writers allowed the characters to be more absurd, exploring the limits of what could reasonably sustain a show once driven by Ben Savage's quickly waning cuteness factor. I had the refer­ence and I had the justification. 
The owners of some of the yearbooks I signed didn't get it; to them I explained myself. Others didn't earn. But they probably wouldn't have carnd even if I tried to write a personalizPd message because they probably had no intention of ever reading the messages they received. But there were a select few who appreciated and admirPd my comedic sensibility. And in the end, what is the point of a yearbook message if not to glorify and accentuate the ego of the composer. 
Since that year I have always tried to employ this method of yearbook signing. Find the reference and all else will fall in place. Avoid the campy, avoid the trite, avoid the real. Go straight for Plays With Squirrels and all problems will be solved. 
And that's how I sign people's year­books.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Energy conservation begins vvith us 
One of the events offered as part of ener­gy week is a tour of the Notre Dame Power Plant. 
My roommate and I decided to take the tour, hoping it would be a bit more than a way to avoid studying for our linear alge­bra test. I was expecting mostly under­graduate students on the tour, but was surprised to find a few professors, a priest, and several adults in business casual out­fits. 
The tour was much more than an overview of how energy was produced from fuel and shuttled to campus-not to say that isn't interesting, just maybe not to the average reader-but also a real idea of what effects my energy usage has on my community. 
With the Forum this week, energy sources and usage is getting a lot of atten­tion. But besides the fact that its the new hip thing to be green, it's important to realize that the effects of our energy con­science are everywhere. 
For example, I learned later in the tour that the well-dressed adults were from accounting, and were on the tour to see what sort of accountability there was for energy usage in specific buildings. One of the students was there to learn about why our power plant uses coal rather than cleaner fuels. One of the professors was asking about the power usage of the research facilities he accessed on campus. Some people at the plant were thinking about the environment, others about money and some (me and my roommate) about if our engineering degrees would require us to read such complicated dis­plays. 
But all joking aside, it wasn't exactly an uplifting message. The fact is, a lot of the energy that the plant is forced to produce is wasted. Some TVs use up to 60 percent of the power when they are in standby as when they are on. Our school used enough hot water to supply 20,000 homes. 
So go to the Forum, read the energy poli­cies of the presidential candidates, but whatever you do, don't forget that the biggest difference you can make is the act of moving your arm two feet to turn off a light, or stepping on the power strip that connects all of your appliances. 
Our tour guide has been working at the plant for seven years, and he says his kids have always complained because he turns off the TV at night rather than keep it on standby, which causes the TV to take a minute to turn on in the morning. 
Well he not only pays the bills for his energy use, he puts in the hours for ours. Even though we don't have to send a check for our energy use, someone does. Who knows, maybe that gets added onto fees as well. 
So next time you are about to walk out the door with your laptop on sleep mode, think to yourself, "Well, maybe if I turn off my computer, football tickets will be cheaper next year." It could be true.

Accepting consequences 
In his Letter to the Editor concerning the University's supposedly inconsistent concern for student well-being ("Mixed messages," Sep. 23), Brian Strickland suggests the University should convert its present policy of coopera­tion and encouragement of law enforcement to one wherein the authorities are asked to divert their attention from university students. 
I propose that if the University does opt for this course of action, it also ought to station nannies in University restrooms to wipe the wayward infant behind it has taken under its protection. 
Strickland's use of scare quotes in describing "criminal" records for underage drinking causes one wonder whether he is as yet unaware that minor consumption is illegal not only virtually but in a very real sense. 
References to institutional pride, top employ­ers, and good academic and disciplinary standing all evoke our assumption that Notre Dame students are some of the best and the brightest, which seems to carry with it the concomitant assumption that they are intelli­gent enough to know precisely what risks they undertake in violating a well-known statute ­especially when given express warning that said statute will be strictly enforced. 
Students caught drinking are fully aware of the illegality and consequences of their actions, and should be allowed to reap what they have sown. Rather than side track the discussion by invoking the common occur­rence of underage drinking (as if we employ a crude moral calculus in which ubiquity covers a multitude of sins), Strickland ought to face up to the fact that it is not the arrests or uni­versity collusion that "tarnish the good reputa­tions that these young adults carry as Notre Dame students" but their own conscious deci­sions to risk a criminal record for the sake of a buzz. 
Could it not be the case that the university is indeed advancing student well-being by allow­ing these irresponsible individuals to learn that, without mommy and daddy there to clean up their messes, they will be held accountable for their choices? 
If. Strickland is not satisfied with this level of involvement, the university could escalate its efforts by requiring a class on why the Catholic tradition does not consider "all my friends are doing it" to be serious moral analysis.

Catnpaigns need to refocus 
Christie Pesavento's recent viewpoint column ("Joe Biden: a gaffe a minute," Sept. 23) discussing Senator Biden's 'gaffes' is a perfect example of why the political system in the United States is in poor shape. 
People like Pesavento would rather discuss a candidate's possible linguistic mistakes and the media's role in how much exposure each blunder receives then focus on important issues affecting millions of Americans. 
It is truly a shame that our current culture rewards sensationalist reporting and that issues like "Did Obama call Palin a pig?", "Is Obama a Muslim?", and "What animals has Palin shot?" are the biggest news stories. 
I would hope that the people of the University of Notre Dame would rise above such drivel. I pray that voters look at each candidate's position on the most important issues and make informed decisions that reflect their conscience. 
I urge everyone as American citizens and as intelligent human beings to research and discuss candidates' past and present stances on war, the economy, respect for human life, foreign policy, etc. It is my fear that our country will be lost if we allow petty issues and moronic drivel to decide the fate of this election.

Rearranging priorities 
I hate to hammer home the same point over and over, but I guess the Indiana State Police either 
a) 
don't read The Observer or 

b) 
have no common sense. 


Sure underage drinking is a problem as it is in any college town, but the excessive vandalism and other crime found in South Bend is not. 
Just a thought, but maybe they should spend taxpayers money in ways that decrease serious crimes, such as say felonies, and when that is fixed worry about underage drinking which, in case anyone forgot, is a misdemeanor. 
Last I checked a few kids drinking is not as bad as someone getting robbed, shot, or killed. South Bend is worse than the national average in the following categories: overall crime, murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries, larceny/theft, vehicle theft and arson. 
Lets rearrange our priorities.

Read to the end 
In Sarah Mervosh's column, "Sex and Free Will," (Sept. 22) she asks, "After all, wasn't it Jesus who said that he who is without sin may cast 'the first stone?" Indeed, in John 8, with those words, Jesus stopped a crowd that was ready to stone a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery. After the crowd dropped their stones and left, without anyone to come forward to condemn the adulterous woman, Jesus told her to "go and sin no more." (John 8:11; KJV). 
That last part is so often overlooked.

SpurtofBlood: An experienceintheater itself 
. By MICHELLE FORDICE . Assistant Scene Editor 
; 

l When most pt~ople read Antonin Artuad's surrealist lplay "Spurt of Blood" they consider it an academic iexerdse. For all the influenee Artuad has had on mod­iern theater, this play is considered to be unstageable land unproduceable. But not all people work that way.! Two years ago now-senior Jaekie Dineen diseovered "Spurt of Blood" during Dr. Mark Pilkinton's Theater, ·I Iistory and Sudety class. She remarked in an e-mail­:interview that. "he had us read the play out loud in -~ dass as an academic exercise and briefly mentioned 
how it has always been considered unstageable due to many of the surrealist and absurd characteristics of tim show. I immediately became interested in what it would take to faithfully translate Artaud's vision onto ·the stage." This week, under her guidance as dra­maturge, hnr interest has come to full realization as the Film, Television. and Theater department take on one of theater's most diflicult works. The show is part of her honors thesis for the department, which will focus first on the practieal aspects of translating 
l'heatnr of C:nwlty, an ovnrarching tlwme of Artuad's work, to a modern stage and audience and second on Peter Brooks, the first person to bring the play to the stage. 
I 
Taking "Spurt of Blood," whid1 is a very short play , rilled with surrealist imagery, and turning it into a ; physkal performance is not an easy task, both eoneep­:; tually and physkally. The audienee is not given mueh tnxt and no plot to react to and there are events that arn difficult to express within the limits of a stage: , stars eollide. the hand of God reaches down, and ~·}( things turn transparent. Dineen remarked, "once you 
read the play you immediately realize how incredibly challenging it is to translate to a modern audience. It has so many surrealist and absurd characteristics like objects falling with a 'despairing slowness' or charac­ters catching on tire. The brevity of the play also tends to leave the reader a little shocked and feeling like nothing was explained." In his introduction to the play, director Dr. Mark Pilkinton wrote, '"Spurt of Blood' challenges the traditional Aristotelian concept of the­atre." 
The cast and crew worked hard to make "Spurt of Blood" a reality, especially under a short three week produetion schedule. In an e-mail interview, Kathleen Hession, the assistant director and one of the actress­es remarked, "being completed entirely by Theatre Majors, this production highlights the immense talent that exists on this campus. I just wish people could have seen the insane amount of work that was put into the three weeks that preceded this performance." Dineen remarked, "the first few days of rehearsal took a lot of patitmce just in deciding what ideas we could use and what we couldn't. Everyone helped in all areas of the show like acting, designing, and staging which really added to the mentality that this is a Company produetion." Of course, while the eompany did their bnst to remain true to the spirit of the play, not every one of Artuad's directions was able to be fol­lowed. Dineen explained, "it was important that we tried to stay as true to Artaud's eoncept as possible, but some things will always have to be changed based on the resources you have." 
The question on most people's lips is, of course, what is this play about? Before audience members walk in, they need to recognize that there isn't a plot or a theme in the way we have come to expect them. Dineen said the play, " .. .is about the concept and the method of production not necessarily the story," and expanded, "the play doesn't have a traditional plot line or your typical characters that audience members relate to, but it does show exaetly what Artaud thought theater should be." She said, "it's important that everyone try to sec what Artaud believes is bro­ken in our typieal theatre performanees. The surreal­ism that runs throughout the show is there to tell the audience that there are more important things in the-I atre than just the spoken word. Theatre of Cruelty ( isn't about violence; it's about focusing on what makes ! us human, which is more than just talking." ! 
With "Spurt of Blood" Artuad is challenging the { audience to drop their preconceptions and approach f theater anew. Hession remarked, "when you enter the f theatre and the show begins focus more on the style of f the production and less on the text. Allow yourself to 1 
be taken over by the production and just have fun with t it. Not everything has to be explained ... surrender to i the madness!" She explained that the show is in a way i attempting to turn a passive audience into an active one, startling their senses so that they eannot just sit back and absorb. This was not only a challenge for the audience, but the actors as well. llession explained that the actors had to remember that, "the text is not what should be placed at the eenter of this production. Rather it is the style of the play that we try to high­light." She continued, "once you convince yourself that you can let go of that stress the entire process becomes much easier and you focus more on simply i being constantly present." . 
Attendees of fTT's produetion of "Spurt of Blood" are certain to be exposed to a new theater experience. __ _

1 Ju longera passive audience 
By STEPHANIE DePREZ 1Assistam Scene Editor 
"Spurt of Blood" is absolutely ridiculous in 
the most fantastic way. It was easily the most 
fun I have had in the theatre in quite a while. 
Upon entrance, one expects to be handed a 
program and seated around the stage for a 
passive, albeit emotional or maybe hysterical 
evening of entertainment. This is what an 
audience member expects -to be enter­
tained. We want to have other people get up 
and act out our greatest tragedies and tri­
umphs, and to feel something in the process. 
We expect them to question our values and 
give us a glimpse of society. But we always 
know that no matter what, they're on the stage and we're in the chairs. This is accepted. This is expected. It's The Theatre after all. 
This is precisely what Artaud was attempting to abolish. And I'm here to tell you, if that's the intent of this production, it succeeds. I can't begin to describe the plot, which, though present, is altogether unimportant. This expe­rience is not about telling a story, but instead about using the idea of theatre to bring emo­tions and thoughts to an audience without one. If theatre is about experience, then this should be its calling card. 
Beyond the set (fluid) costumes (bizarre) and text (nice ... really) stand the actors, who are the pillar of this show. They are so committed that, as the absurdity rises, you somehow trust them to keep it all in control. This is a show that could easily get lost, become a farce or leave the viewer stranded in a sea of confu­sion, but they never falter. As an audience member, I felt safe letting them guide me across the stage (at moments literally) as the show raged on. 
It ran about 38 minutes, start to finish. I laughed, gasped, and I let myself be open to this archetype of "theatre of the cruelty." But I am pretty sure that through the entire show, I · was smiling. Bottom line, you don't have to be a theatre aficionado to understand the show. It's not about being understood. And you should go.

Jets' Favre expected to play this w-eekend 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -Don't fret, Jets fans. Brett Favre's play­ing streak appears safe. 
The New York quarterback rolled his left ankle during the third quarter of the Jets' 48-29 loss at San Diego on Monday night, but coach Erie Mangini wasn't overly con­cerned about Favre's injury. 
"Brett usually plays," Mangini said Tuesday, "and I would anticipate the same." 
Favre was limping notice­ably after the injury and in the Joe ke r room after the game, but has started an NFL-record 256 there's going to be some times where when you put the ball up in volume, you're going to have turnovers. Brett's made a lot of great plays, sort of ad­lib type plays and the receivers are getting more and more used to that and I think he's getting more and more used to the receivers. As you go along and get the addi­tional reps, that tends to nat­urally improve." 
Mangini bemoaned a few other turnovers, including a fumble by running back Thomas Jones. that turned the momentum in the 
Chargers' 
favor.

Jets head coach
understanding him and I think we have a good plan in place whenever guys get injured, so I feel pretty comfortable with the process," Mangini said. "And I know that if there's any way that he can play, he'll definitely play." 
Mangini said Favre received some treatment on the ankle when the team arrived home early Tuesday morning, and the quarterback was sched­uled for more later in the evening. 
The nature of the lllJury wasn't immediately known, but Favre said after the game that X-rays came out OK ­meaning there was no break. The players had the day off from speaking with the media. and Favre is scheduled for his weekly news confer­ence Wednesday morning. 
Favre was lifted for Kellen Clemens before the Jets' final offensive possession, but it was more because the game was out of hand at that point. 
Favre was inconsistent against the Chargers, going 30-of-42 for 271 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one returned 52 yards for a score by defensive back Antonio Cromartie. He and some of his receivers appeared out of sync at times, something Favre has warned would take some time to per­feet after playing in Green Bay's offensive system for the past 16 seasons. 
"I think there's been progress each week," Mangini said. "We threw the ball quite a bit (Monday) night and 
turnover for a 
touchdown," 
Mangini said. 

"That was the case in the first half, some positive drives punctuated by the turnovers. Whenever you have that happen, it's not going to have a good result." 
After New York cut the deficit to 17-14 on Laveranues Coles' 3-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter, the Jets tried to catch the Chargers off guard by trying an on-side kick. After a perfectly placed bounce by kicker Jay Feely, special teams standout Wallace Wright got his hands on the ball but lost it and San Diego recovered. Five plays later, the Chargers made it a 10-point game and Mangini was roundly criticized for the call after the game. 
"In that situation, I would definitely do it again if it was the same situation," Mangini said. "We didn't execute as well as we should've." 
The Jets also clearly missed the presence of run-stopping nose tackle Kris Jenkins, who left in the first quarter with a back injury. San Diego fin­ished with 107 yards on the ground and were able to con­vert on third down numerous times late in the game. 
"There were times (Monday) night where we thought Kris could come back in," Mangini said. "It just didn't get to the point where we were ready to do that. He was close, defi­nitely, throughout the course of the game, so I'm hoping with time and treatment, that 'II move along pretty well." 
MLB 
Twins and Sox ready to go 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -Neither 

the Chicago White Sox nor the 
Minnesota Twins have been 
playing like contenders over 
the past month. They're 
determined to change that 
during the final week of the 
regular season. 
The White Sox will bring a 2 1/2-game lead in the AL Central over the Twins to a packed-and-loud Metrodome Tuesday for the start of a three-game series that should, finally, define this slow-devel­oping race. 
"We're in first place, so we need to act like a first-place team and go play like one," said Chicago lefty Mark Buehrle, who will take the mound on Wednesday. 
Minnesota is glad to be back, after playing 24 of the previous 30 games on the road and going 9-15 in that stretch. The Twins are 49-26 at the Metrodome this year, with a 3.25 staff ERA under the bubble compared to 5.14 on the road. 
"We're ready for it. We're going to go home and play hard," said Twins left-bander Francisco Liriano, who won't pitch in the series after allow­ing one run in seven innings of a victory Sunday at Tampa Bay. 
These rivals have been no further apart in the standings than the current margin since July 27. Chicago has been in front for 144 days and all but nine since May 17, but hasn't led by any more than 3 1/2 games since June 19. 
"It's like you're fighting for 12 rounds and you know you're winning, but a lucky punch gets you last round and you're done and you lose the title. That's that way I feel right now," White Sox manag­er Ozzie Guillen said. 
Indeed, though his team can clinch with a sweep, three wins the other way would put Minnesota in first place. 
"That's what we're here for. We're close, and we have them at home," first baseman Justin Morneau said. 
The magic number is down to five for the leaders, mean­ing any combination of White Sox wins and Twins losses adding up to that will give Chicago the title. After this series, the White Sox host Cleveland and the Twins host Kansas City. 
The White Sox have an extra game to play next Monday against Detroit if the teams are within a half-game of each other on Sunday, due to a rainout earlier this month. 
If they're tied after that, the Twins must travel to the South Side for a playoff on Tuesday to determine the winner of a division the Twins have won four times in the previous six years. Over 13 postseasons since the AL Central was cre­ated, the White Sox have qualified as the champion twice. Cleveland is the leader with seven. 

In 2005, the White Sox won the World Series, but Guillen said this year's team should be more proud than that one. He also metaphorically pre­dicted a collapse this week would feel like a low-budget movie with a confusing con­clusion. 
"The only thing we have left and the only thing that can complement that is to win," Guillen said. "If not, it will be a tough summer with a bad ending." 
This has been a strange sea­son in the Upper Midwest. The Tigers were supposed to be the favorites after their winter spending spree, but their age showed this summer and they had more holes than most analysts probably real­ized. The Indians were in position to contend, too, with a young core that came within one victory of advancing to the World Series last fall. 
But it was the White Sox with their homer-happy heart of the order and Guillen­inspired spunk who emerged, and the Twins have stayed right on their heels -enjoy­ing 23 days in first place, mostly in May -with a speedy lineup and better­than-expected starting pitch­ing from an untested group of prospects. 
Lately, the rotation has fal­tered. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday against the Rays, the starters gave Minnesota a total of only 6 1-3 innings. 
"They say they're not tired. They don't feel tired. It's about making pitches. We have to get innings out of these young men. It's still about giving us a chance. We can't continue going into the bullpen for six innings," man­ager Ron Gardenhire said. 
Kansas City will have played the Twins and White Sox a total of 18 times in August and September by week's end, so the Royals have as good of a perspective on this series as any. 
Two weeks ago, when Chicago's lead was one game, manager Trey Hillman was asked to rate the race. After praising the power of the White Sox and giving their starting pitching an edge for a greater ability to dominate a given outing, he spoke rever­ently about the Twins, their lack of walks issued, their offensive and defensive funda­mentals, and their speed on the bases and in the outfield. 
"It's a tough call for me.-I really feel like it's tougher for us playing against these guys," Hillman said, referring to Minnesota before the game on Sept. 11. "Maybe it's because we're here right now playing against them in this dome, where they have a good record. I just feel like these guys might have the edge a little bit, even though the White Sox at times can pitch a little bit better." 
At this point, though, analy­sis doesn't matter. The White Sox have the lead, and it's up to them to maintain it. 
"We are where we are for a reason," said John Danks, who will start Thursday. "We know it's a big series, and we know there is a lot at stake. We want to have as much lee­way as we can."

No. 1 USC at Oregon State 9 p.m., ESPN 

Associated Press 

COLUMBUS, Ohio ­Tailback Chris "Beanie" Wells is likely to return for No. 14 Ohio State against Minnesota on Saturday. 
"It adds to our arse­nal," coach Jim Tressel said Tuesday, shortly after announcing that Wells was probable for Saturday's game. 
Wells has been out of action since injuring his right foot early in the second half of the open­ing victory over Youngstown State. Dan Herron has been the tail­back in victories over Ohio and Troy and a lop­sided defeat at top­ranked Southern California. 
Ohio State could use the boost. Even though freshman Terrelle Pryor threw four touchdown passes last week in his debut as a starter against Troy, the offense has been erratic since Wells left. 
His teammates were happy to see him doing all the drills at Tuesday night's practice. 
Asked how Wells looked, offensive lineman Alex Boone said, "Fast. Very fast. He was run­ning all over the place. He looked physical and fast. He looked like noth­

ing had happened to him." 
Against Troy, the Buckeyes led just 14-10 heading into the fourth quarter before punts downed deep inside the 20 helped Ohio State set up two short touchdown 
drives to  pull away 28­ 
10.  
Pryor  gives  the  

Buckeyes a mobile quar­terback who can avoid a collapsing pocket and transform a potential loss into a gain. He escaped from severe pressure on several occa­sions to frustrate Troy defenders and perpetu­ate drives. 
The Buckeyes also 
experimented up front with several other fresh faces on the offensive line. Jim Cordle, who had started the past 16 games at center, moved to left guard to fill in for the injured Steve Rehring. Another true 
freshman,  Mike  
Brewster,  then  took  
Cordle's spot.  

Brewster wasn't the only youngster in the rotation up front. True freshman J.B. Shugarts and sophomore Andrew Miller also saw action. 
Suddenly, the huddle that Wells returns to doesn't bear much resemblance to the one he left. 

IN BRIEF Paterno hopes to return 
to sideline at Penn State 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -Joe Paterno didn't list himself on the injury report, but Penn State's coach designated himself "hope­ful" to be back on the sideline for the 12th-ranked Nittany Lions' game Saturday night against Illinois. 
Slowed by a sore right leg, the Hall of Farner moved to the press box after halftime of last week's rout of Temple -not that the 81­year-old Paterno says he couldn't have stayed on the field the whole time. 
"Yeah, I hope to be," Paterno said Tuesday when asked if he intends to pace the Beaver Stadium sideline for the Big Ten opener versus the No. 22 Illini. "I could have been out in the second half Saturday if I wanted to, but ... I figured we got a lot of football ahead of us. Let's maybe take it a little bit easier upstairs. 
Green set to replace Bulger 
at QB for floundering Rams 
ST. LOUIS -Marc Bulger is out as the St. Louis Rams starting quarter­back after throwing only two touch­down passes in three games and will be replaced by 38-year-old Trent Green for Sunday's game against Buffalo. 
The benching of the Rams' highest­paid player, announced by coach Scott Linehan in a terse, two-para­graph release on Tuesday, signals just how desperate times have become for the sagging franchise. Linehan is 11-24 in his third season, including 0-3 this year with none of the games competitive. 
Last week, Linehan was told by new owner Chip Rosenbloom that improvements need to be made or that changes would be forthcoming. This is Linehan's first head coaching job at any level, earned off success as an offensive coordinator with the Dolphins and Vikings. He was a quarterback in college at Idaho. 
Texans pitch in to help 
out struggling community 
HOUSTON -Duane Brown's home still doesn't have electricity more than 10 days after Hurricane Ike plowed into southeast Texas. 
That didn't stop the Houston Texans' first-round draft pick from spending his day off Tuesday at the Houston Food Bank, filling boxes with food to be distributed to families who need help in the wake of the storm. 
"I was very fortunate in the sense that I didn't have any property damage or anything like that," he said. ''I'm around a lot of people who are able to help me out and I know a lot of people don't have that.

NFL 
QBQuinn could start 
for Browns 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Maybe it was fitting that Derek Anderson spent his day off at an adoption center for cats and dogs. Cleveland's starting quarterback is on a short leash. 
With his team off to a disturb­ing 0-3 start, Browns coach Romeo Crennel is considering personnel changes and may bench Anderson for popular backup Brady Quinn. 
Anderson,' who made the Pro Bowl last season while leading Cleveland to 10 wins, has thrown just two touchdown passes and five interceptions in Cleveland's losses to Dallas, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. He enters this week's game at Cincinnati with a 43.5 quarter­back rating -only Kansas City's Tyler Thigpen's 38.3 is worse. 
Anderson expects to start against the Bengals. However, if he struggles, he won't fmish. 
He has run out of time. 
"I can play better. I know that," Anderson said Tuesday outside the Cleveland Animal Protective League. "It's been frustrating because I've put a lot into it and it's not gone perfect. I'm not making excuses, but it hasn't been what we've all expected it to be. You watch film and it's a few things here and there: a missed throw, a dropped pass. 
"It's never going to be perfect, but we thought we would have won at least one or two games so far. I understand it, and I'm just going to continue to keep working, knowing that we're still in this and we just have to fmd a way to get going." 
Wearing a protective sleeve wrap over a bruised right arm, Anderson didn't appear to be nervous about losing his job. He was typically laid-back and approachable as he toured the facility and mingled with volun­teers and people adopting ani­mals. At one point, he dropped down on the floor to play with a pair of adorable brown Labradors before they were taken home by delighted new owners. 
On Monday, Crennel informed 
the Browns that he was evaluat­
ing every position and that 
changes could be forthcoming. 
Anderson didn't need to be told. 
Pressing to make big plays, he 
has made poor throws and bad 
decisions for an injury-riddled 
offense that has scored a 
league-low 26 points. 
And if Anderson doesn't 
improve quickly, Crennel will 
have no choice but to turn 
things over to Quinn, who will 
get more repetitions in practice 
this week with the first-team 
offense. 
"Regardless of the situation, I 
always put a lot of pressure on 
myself," said Anderson, who 
went 14-of-37 for 125 yards 
with three interceptions on 
Sunday. "I take it as he (Quinn) 
is trying to take my job every 
week. Maybe it's too much pres­
sure I put on myself, but that's 
just kind of the way I've always 
thought about it, even in college 
when I knew I was going to play. 
"Anytime you get comfortable, 
you have to remind yourself that 
that guy's chasing you."

"We did what we came out here to do," Bishop said. 
Bishop, who played quarterback for the Ducks (1-1), attributed her team's oflfmsive success to a lot of short passes that helped them spread out the Pyros (0-1) defense. 
"We didn't just go for the big plays, we tried to work the entire field," Bishop said. 
Though Bishop threw for three touchdown passes, she was just as efl"ective running the ball, creating multiple opportunities for the offense by throwing on the run or by tucking in the ball and taking it up the field herself. 

Howard's defense was equally impressive, sacking Pyros quarter­back Caitlin Robinson four times and intercepting her once. By gen­erating a consistent pass rush, they did not allow the sophomore signal-caller to get into a good rhythm. 
On the other sideline, Pasquerilla East now has a good idea of how it can improve for next week. 
Though the Pyros got on the board with an early touchdown, they just couldn't keep up with Howard. The Pyros defense stayed on the field for most of the game, as short offensive drives gave them little time to rest. Captain Tara Pillai said the team was dis­appointed, but that it was only their first game and the squad should be better prepared next week. 
"We need more consistency on offense and with our defensive pass coverage," Pailai said. 
Pillai stood out in an otherwise unimpressive Pyros offense. As Robinson's favorite target, Pillai kept multiple Pasquerilla East drives alive on third and fourth downs. 
Cavanaugh 0, Pasquerilla West 0 
Neither the Purple Weasels nor the Chaos could emerge victorious from a defensive showdown as the teams battled to a tie Tuesday night. 
Both offenses struggled as nei­ther team could move the ball down the field effectively or sus­tain a drive. 
Cavanaugh (1-0-1) came the closest to breaking the deadlock. After a punt return deep into Purple Weasels (0-0-1) territory, Chaos captain Katie Dunn con­nected with freshman receiver Brittni Alexander in the corner of the end zone, but Alexander was ruled out of bounds. 
Du1111 disagreed with the call. 
"I don't see how a ref could miss a call that badly," DUI111 said. "She clearly dragged her feet in the end zone."

first three games [and[ we've had more success throwing the ball than running the ball," he said. "But you can't make a liv­ing -you can't make a living just being one-dimensional in football." 
Given tim option of continuing with that balance despite recent struggles of the running game or converting to a more pass-heavy offense, Weis said the rushing offense takes pressure ofT the quarterback and prevents defenses from keying on the passing game. 
"I always believe that it makes things a hoek of a lot easier on the quarterback if you can run the ball. It makes it a lot easier," thfl eoaeh said. "When defensive linemen ean just pin their ears ba1:k and know you were throw­ing on every down, you're usual-

That drive aside, the game was dominatnd by both defensns. 
The Chaos Sflcondary was out­standing from start to finish, inter­cepting three passes and swatting down balls all night. 
"We played signature Cavanaugh defense tonight," defensive linemen Jessica Mahon said.

ly putting yourself at risk." 
When askBd whether it would be easier to run the ball with one solid baek rather than three, Weis drew his answer from the NFL game between the Jets and the Chargers Monday night. Chargers running baek LaDanian Tomlinson, he said, was the best, but their change-of-paee baek, Darren Sproles, posed a threat every time he got in the game. 
"When they give him the ball, it's not like giving it to LaDainian," he said. "LaDainian is one of the best but when that little b'UY gets in there you better look out because every time he touches it, he may be taking it to the house." 
Note: 
+Weis said wide receiver David Grimes will play this weekend. Grimes has missed time because of a sore baek.

"The defense really saved us," Davies said. "They bailed us out of ~vel?,' jam, especially the defensive lme. 
Despite the tie, both teams were still optimistic about their season outlooks. 
"This is hands down the most potential I've seen on any Cavanaugh team," Dunn said. "Onee we develop our red zone oflimse, we'll bejustfine." 
Pasquerilla West coach Adam Brainard is also hopeful that his team will pull it together in time for next week's game. 
"After tonight we have a better idea of how our offensive players fit into positions," Brainard said. "With our outstanding defense, I expect a shutout every game."

Yeatntan will not suit up 
Junior tight end will sit out until 'matter is resolved' 
By BILL BRINK Sports EJitor 
.Junior tight end Will Yeatman will not play this weekend against Purdue and will not suit up until his "matter is resolved," Irish eoaeh Charlie Weis said in his weekly press conference. 
Yeatman and freshman center Mike (;o!ic Jr. were arrested this weekend at an off-campus party on Colfax Ave. Police charged Yeatman with minor consump­tion of alcohol, false informing and resisting arrest, and charged Golic with minor consumption of alcohol. 
"Any other action as it relates to team rules, including the situ­ation with Mike Colic, will be handled by me," Weis said. 
Weis said both players will par­ticipate in practice. 
The situation's delicacy, Weis said, requires him to act with some degree of compassion. 
"I think I try to treat these kids similar to if I were talking to Charlie fWeis, Jr.]." Weis said. "As you go through growing pains, you know, you just try to educate and teach and let them know that you weren't perfect when you were going through the..~rowing experience your­selL 
Weis said it is not his role to judge the players' actions but rather to provide support. 
"I think the most important thing is to just look out for the interest of the kids and the team and the University," Weis said. 
At the tight end position, Weis said Joseph Fauria's playing time will increase due to the loss of Yeatman. 
"As a matter of fact, today, instead of practicing on the scout team he'll be practicing up with the big boys," Weis said. 
Freshman Kyle Hudolph cur­rently tops the depth chart at tight end.

Belles head to Michigan 
Team will try to gain ground in league standings at third jamboree 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will look to close the gap in the MIAA sea­son standings Wednesday when the team heads to Thornapple Pointe in Grand Hapids, Mich., to compete in the third of four fall season jamborees. 
The Belles find themselves onn stroke behind second­place llope and 37 behind lirst-place Olivet. 
Saint Mary's coach Mark Hamilton said he is looking for steady improvement each week from his team. 
"Hight now, we are really struggling to get four good scores. Our top three are usu­ally pretty solid, but we aren't getting consistency from our fourth and firth spots," Hamilton said. "We are a ways behind Olivet and they are the team we are trying to beat. We just need to focus on gaining ground on the teams ahead of' 
us." 
Belles freshman Natalie Matuszak has been on a tear in her rookie season at Saint Mary's and will look to lead the team back into league con­tention. 
"[Matuszak] is developing into a great college player," Hamilton said. "She is the best freshman I've coached in my seven years at Saint Mary's." 
Hamilton has not given up on his team's chances to linish atop the conference. 
"If we can get healthy, we have a shot to make up some ground," Hamilton said. "Our goal is still to win the confer­ence this fall and have momentum heading into the spring." 
The tmun at the top of stand­ings after the fall season is declared the MlAA champion but the automatic NCAA tour­nament berth will not be determined until the spring snason.
