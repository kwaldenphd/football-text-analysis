BONN. West Germany -Soviet President Yuri V. Andropov sent a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a spokesman for Kohl said yesterday, the eve of a debate on the deploy­ment of NATO nuclear missiles in West Germany. 
Meanwhile, police reinforced security in the government district to discourage violence by anti­missile activists, and said they will ring the Parliament building today during the debate on an issue that pected tomorrow is not necessary.

Change in party roles considered successful 
By ERIK HICKEY 
News Staff 
Several hall presidents have expressed satisfaction with the results of the new Hall Presidents Council policy to charge women $1 at parties in men's dorms. 
The dollar fee is intended to im­prove the usually sparse fare of snacks and non-alchoholic beverages provided at dorm parties. The resolution also ensures the privacy of parties by requiring all men to be on a guest list and every person admitted to show a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's II:'. 
Since the passage ofthe resolution both Zahm and Keenan Halls have held in-hall parties and enforced the $1 charge. Keenan Hall Social Com­missioner Mark Greenwood es­timated approximately $120 was collected from women at the last Keenan party. Greenwood said the money will be used to reduce men's expenses and to insure an ample supply of soft drinks and snacks at future Keenan parties. 
According to Bob Johnson, Zahm Hall president, resolution guidelines were followed "to the letter" at the

Walsh Hall President Karen Kos­tecky would disagree. While she herself is in favor of the resolution. she said many girls only want to talk to a few friends and don't actually drink while at parties. "I wouldn't want to pay a dollar for every party (if attending more than one)," she said, adding that a dollar is only a minor factor in deciding whether or not to attend more than one party.

Reflections on service in Arizona

service an added dimension often lacking in secular volunteer programs, that of spirituality. 
Community living and a simple lifestyle form an important part of the experience. Each HCA group is fortunate to have in its area a local Holy Cross religious community that helps provide the group with a sense of sup­port, assistance and guidance. 
The challenge that awaits a Holy Cross as­sociate is the challenge to grow in the knowledge of oneself and of others. It is the challenge to seek in one's life the realizaton of the Christian ideal within a culture full of violence and injustice. It is the challenge to join, in such a world, our ideas with action, in order to reconcile the rich with the poor, the. Church wth the world, and faith with reason. 
The call is a difficult one, for it is an ongoing struggle to make our Christian faith a real part ofour daily lives, and yet to be true witnesses to the message of Christ, it is something that we must strive to do. 
Awareness is a key to the struggle; until I came out to Arizona with the program I never really gave much thought to what life was like as a migrant farmworker or what it was like trying to support a family at a wage far below the poverty level. 
I had never seen transients or street people before, and now I am working with them every day at an emergency shelter in downtown Phoenix. I never knew what life was like for the poorest of the poor. 
The homeless people that I am working with at the shelter are each wounded in some way; the spiritual, physical and mental scars run deep. These people have been systemati­cally and catagorically oppressed throughout their lives by the extant social structure, and their souls are filled with anger and hate, with fear, and a deep, deep lonliness. They are the helpless, crying out for help, and getting no answers. 
Notre Dame and home seem so far away in the face of such experiential learning. I am being challenged each day to try to under­stand what all this means with respect to my faith and how I will live my life as a doctor, .ny intended career. 
It has been almost three months now that I have been out here, and the adjustment process has at times been full of very difficult educational experiences, however there have been many pleasant·-and enjoyable ex­periences also. 
We have the household chores-cleaning, cooking, shopping and repair and main­tenance -divided up with reasonable equity. After four years of revelling in the squalor of empty-beer-can-laiden floors in Dillon, I guess that it is part ofmy responsibility as a graduate to start picking up after myself. 
We have a house meeting once a week to discuss community business, to air out any problems we have been having, and to discuss any other topics that might affect the com­munity. Every Tuesday night we have Father Bill Dorwart over to the house for dinner and Mass. It is a good time for us to get together in a structured way so we might strengthen our bonds as a community and get to know each other better. 
We al5o usually have a discussion on a previously agreed upon subject. The topics generally are about social concerns or thoughts on the readings at Mass, or maybe just on how work has been going and things we have been dealing with. 
The experience of this year will change me in many ways. I will not be the same person I was before the year. I will have new perspectives and a new and more critical way of looidng at things. I will be tested and strengthened by experience, and with firm trust in God, I will be able to integrate them into my lifestyle and my profession.

Miss Manners 
The proper letter after an 18-year visit 
by Judith Martin 
K
nowing what Miss Mannns thinks ofpeople who can spend a weekend in someone else·~ house and not write a letter there af­
terward, youl.·an imagine what she thinks ofthose who spend I 7 or 
I H years in the same house and then go off to college and never 
write. 

Although the offense is greater, the penalty is less because the stu­dent is going to be invited back. Parents can be as offended as anyone with a display of bad manners but they lack the recourse ofsaying, "You can tdl what kind ofpeople he must come from." 
Miss Manners is not suggesting mat a thank you note is needed for tht· simpk task ofchild-rearing. Nor is she suggesting that it is neces­sary to St'nd one's parents a running commemary ofeverything that happt·ns to a teen-ager away from home -they deserve better than that. 
But no d1ild ~hould bt: allowed to tkpart his nativt: city for school without an mukrstanding with his parents about how often they cx­pt"Ct bulktins. Mi~s Manners recommends that a sizable percentage of tht·se he in tht· form of ktters, rather than collect calls, not only h~.:cause of the expcnst· hut to give the parents a chance to see if the nlucation is taking. (It is not, howevt:r, up to tht·m to issue grades. Part·nts who rt·turn kllcrs with spdling mistakes circled do not deservt· 10 gt·t any.) 
Evt·ry once in a while, each child is expectnl to write a letter that contains no mention of money or services ht· would like to receive from home. And tht· ones that do must n~.:ver open with these re­qut·sts. 
It is not nect:ssary 10 trouble parents with the new eating habits and hours a child tries out on his first extended sojourn away from homt·. llowevn. if there arc natural consequences, the child is obligatt·d to notifY the parents before the college infirmary does. 
Miss Manners is sympathetic with the wish ofevery devoted son and daughtt·r 10 hdp parents live happily in a fool's paradise. Nt·vt·rthdcs~. unconccalablc trouble is best stated first by the stu­dent -with the opening of"Don't worry, but ..."that stops every parnll's heart -before the dean, their friends who have children in tht· samt· class, or the evening news tells them what the matter is. 
Surprisingly. there arc also students who neglect to inform their parents ofthe approach ofprizes and honors. Th:u is not only incon­sideratt·. but it sct·ms 10 contradict the very achicvt"ment involved. Nobody with any brains would neglect to report succt"SS where it is most appreciated. 
A stmknt is required to invite parents to all ceremonies or parents' days, and it is no good saying that tht· student has made the tkcision not to attend. Tht· choice is the parents'. A student Whir rt·ally wants to avoid this writes, ''I'll feel terrible ifyou don't stay with me. I'll arrange to borrow sleeping bags for you, and I hope the noist· won't hothn you." 
School holidays arc presumed to be ti>r the expressed purpose of visiting homt·. That doesn't mean that one always has to go home, of n>urst· -only that failure to do so must be properly and regretfully eXCU!'>l'tl. 
A modd kiter from a child who is not going home is: "I've been looking t<>rwanlto stTing you so much that I hate to have to wait un· til Christmas. But it does st-em silly to have you spend all that money fi>r juM timr days, when most of it would be used-up traveling, anyway. So I thought. since l'vt· bt-cn studying so much that I have rwglt-cted gelling any exncist·, I'd just do a little skiing near here, ami then gt·t hack to work. I certainly will miss having Thanksgiving dinner-which I would have missed, anyway, since Ican't gt"t away until Thur!->day-and I'll be thinking of you then." 
Dear Miss Manners -Pkasc advise on tht: propt:r way to pay for a 
lunch or show gratitudt· when one asks his boss to lunch. Super­
visors ht·rc usually pay for lunch no matter who invites. 
Gentle Reader-Heach ti>r the check saying, "No, no, thb is pure­
ly social -I juM thought it would he fun to have lunch with you. 
Tht· boss will he so startled aft_er that, that it doesn't matter who final­
ly ends up with the chn:k. 
Dear Miss Manners -I am 7 ft-ct tall. This is the source ofsome dif­
finrlty. as t·very·when: I go Iam accosted by imbeciles demanding to 
know how tall I am. 

Perti:ct strangers then name t'Vt:f)' near or distant relative or ac­
quaintance whom they consider tall: "I've got an uncle who is6 fi>ot 
2, and I thought be was ta:t' But you're really tall." 
Genth Reader-The bd1avior ofpeopk who kd compelled to comment on olwiou~ physical characteristics is, as you say, imbe­cilic, and Miss Manners trusts that you scrupulously refrain from making such observations when you meet twins, redheads, very short pt·opk -and, indeed, anyont: at all. 
You may not he rudt· in response hut Miss Manners will allow you 
to say, "I rt·ally don't know -I haven't measurt"d myselffor some

Thanksgiving adventures 
---------------------------------·-----------­
b~~ Chris Fraser 
jE~atures columnist 
A
s I'm sure you all know, Thursday is Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is known as a time for food, a time for football, and most especially, a time for family. However, due to logistical problems, many Notre Dame stu­dents are forced to spend this holiday at someplace other than home (or even Grandma's house)­St"niors like myself have long since adjusted to this inconve][lience. For many freshmen, on the other hand, this first Thanksgiving spent in foreign surroundings can be a traumatic occasion. 
On this topic I speak from ex­perience. I remember my first Thanksgiving away from home not because it proved to be at particular­ly depressing or momt"ntous happening but because it tumt"d in­to somt"thing ofa wacky advt"nture. Allow mt" to explain. 
Sinct" none of us would bt" able to make it home, I and three of my friends, jot", John and Ka1rl, con­sidered ourselves fortunate because we would bt" able to escape the clutches ofSouth Bend ti:>r a few days. That's becauseJoe's aunt in In­dianapolis wa~ kind enough to invite us all down to share their turkey and trimmings. Surely, Wt" needed a few last days ofrelaxation before that dreadful first set offinals about which we were all being warnt"d. 
All we needed, then, wao; a mode oftransportation to get us down to Indy. Four ofus, we figured, would never be able to get a rid1r together so we came up with the idea ofren­ting a car. We were, after all, I 8 year old adults who could travd around the country in adult ways. Unfor­tunately, that line of reasoning did not sit well with the major rental car companies all ofwhom wanted 2 I yt"a.r olds with major credit cards. But just as Wt" began to ponder dining hall turkey, we stumbled upon a company that would rent us a car. Pacific Rent-a-Car w~k'i its name and Wt" found it through an ad in The Observer. It seemed a little strange that they had a long distalllce phone number, but they said to call collt"ct. So Wt" did. Joe wao; given the job to make the call. 
"We'd like to rent a car for Wed­nesday through Friday,"Joe said in his deepest, most mature voice. 
"Ask ifwe need a credit card," said L 
"Ask ifwe have to be 2I," joined in KarL SoJoe asked ar.d much to our surprise, we needed neither. All we did need was 5 I 8 a day plus a hundred dollardeposit for which Wt" could write a Check. Certainly, that was no problem. As freshman we loved to writt" checks. 
"Wht"rt" caJll we pick up the car?" 
askedJoe. 
"The airport," they told him. We 
were all st"t and I must admit we 
Wt"rc quite t"Xcited about this, out 
first college roadtrip. 
When Wednesday rolled around, we scrounged up a ride to the air­port and offwt" wt"nt. We pulled up to Michiana !tegional and sentJoe in to get the car. Out ht" came in five minutes but with no kt"ys. 
"No one knows whert" Pacific 
Rent-a-Car is," ht" said." 
"It's got to be around here some­
where," l rc.l.~oned. 
"Maybe it's just not in the tt"r­
minal," suggested john. 
"Wait, I've still got the ad hert"," said Karl,"Give'em a call." So we thrt"wJoe the ad and a dime. Can't hl" do anything right we thought. An­other five minutes and back came 
Joe. 
"They said it was right next to Dollar Rent-a-Car and that cop said Dollar Rent-a-Car is down in those buildings over there. So we drove down a few hundred yards to a small cluster ofstructures surrounded by a bunch ofprivate planes. There, we found Dollar Rent-a-Car. 
"It must be in thert", go check it 
outJoe," one ofus ordert"d.Joc 
frowned but went. He was stuck 
with the legwork bt"cause he had 
made the rest"rvations. This time, he 
emerged in but a minute, again with 
no keys. 
"They've never even heard of 
Pacific Rent-a-Car," he moaned. We 
wt"re beginning to get a bit nervous 
but Wt" were g.-own college students 
and we were not about to panic ­
just yet. 
"Call them up again," suggested 

Karl. Having lost some confidence in Joe, we all gathered around tht" phone and watched him makt" the collect calL He proceedt"d to iden­tify himself in a less than pleasant tone and he explained our wandt"r­
ings through the airport. I could jus 
imagine us all a~ dupes in a lkrtz 
commt"rcial wildly running around 

while 0.). Simpson cautioned,"Dol"s 
this happen to you when you rent a 
car?" Anyway, Wt" ht:ardJoe getting 
the Sanlc directions from thest" 
Pacific clowns and we were 
thoroughly confust"d. 
"Wait," saidJohn, "maybe we're at tht" wrong airpt>rt." Obviously, none ofus were familiar with the South Bend area 
"What airpt>rt are you at anyway?" inquired Joe who was beginning to lose his patknce. W{· wt"re all hunched around the phone and heard the response. 
"LAX." they said. Ah, we were at 
the wrong airport but we remained 
unenlightened. 
"LA.X., hmmm ...well, we're at 
Michiana Regional, where is LAX.?" 
questionedJoe. Finally, this whole 
affair would be resolved. 
"L.A.X.!" they cried, "you know, 
L.A. as in Los Angeles, Los Angeles In­tt"rnational Airport!" 
"Oh ...urn, I'd like to cancel that reservation," Joe muttered. 
We were all in something ofa state ofshock but soon Wt" were able to sort out the pieces and put tht" puzzle together. Clearly, this t"X­plained the long distanct" phone call and I knew I'd recognizt"d that 2 I 3 art"a code from somewhere. Why would tht"y advertise in The Ob­server? Wdl, because the USC-Notre Dame game was to he played out tht"re ofcourse. We double-checked the ad and it said nothing specifically about picking the car· up in Los An­geles. I suppose they thought it wa~ pretty obvious what with Pacific Rent-a-car and that 2 I 3 area code. But remember, we were only fresh­
men. 
As an epilogue, I should note that we were resourceful enough to get a last minute car through Ug~y DucklingRent-a-Car. Wearrivedin Indianapolis, weary and shell­shocked, aboutfive hours late. The turkey, by the way, was delicious.

I also went to the march to protest te actions ofthe lJ.S. in Grt"nada and El Salvador. I agree with the Catholic Bishops when they state that, "the human person is the clearest reflec­tion ofGod's presence in the world." This statement refers to every per­son-indudingthe ones that live in Cuba, Grenada, Russila, El Salvador and Nicaragua. I do not believe in condoning the killing ofGod's people. Moreover, our killings of 
persons in Grenada, E1 Salvador and other countries are a breeding ground for nudear suicide. 
Pe.haps it was the avoidance of violence between ouf group and a protesting rally ofVict Nam veterans wht"n members ofour march placed themselves betwt"en the opposing groups and held hands in a non­violent way. Perhaps it wa~ the joking between some: polict" and protestors about polict" overtime pay. Regardless ofthe rt"ason, while the impact ofthis first-of-its-kind protest on public opinion cannot yet be assessed, its impact on in­dividuals wa~ evidt"nlt. 
D
riving along the Ohio Tumpikt" at 4 am., listening to The Clash, it wao; as though we were returning to Notre Dame from mid­semt"ster break. However, Mike Brennan,John Murphy, Bridget Sul­livan and myselfwere noll coming back from break, we were rt"tuming from the Nov. 12 march in Wa'ihing­ton D.C The purpt>St" ofthe march was primarily to prott"St the nuclear arms buildup and the intervention of the U.S. in Grenada and EI Salvador. 
Why did I drive 24 hours in one weekend to walk all day \vith '50,000 other people? Iwent for the purpt>se ofprotesting the existence of nuclear Wt"apons. I agrn: with tht" Catholic Bishops' recent pastoral letter which statt"s that, "nuclear war threatens the existence ofour planet." One can readily ~;ee the Catholic Bishops are justified in this view. 
Tht" Pershing II missiks that are soon to be placed in West Germany 
(the 1962 Cuban missik crisis in rt"Vt"rse) can reach the Soviet Union within six minutes after deploy­ment. It takes longer than six minutes to discover computer launching errors. There were I 5'5 such errors·in 1982. The Russians currt"ntly thrt"att"n to put their missiks on a launch-on warning sys­tem. This would then leave our fate, in the event of an error, to Russian computers. It has been statt"d that the Russian computt"rs arc not con­sistently reliable. 
For myself, the existence of nuclear weapons is sinful. The Tri­dent submarine can crt"att" an in­ft"rno many times more destructive than the OVt"ns ofAuschwitz. Should a nudear war begin, "I do not want to agonize, "it is now too late." Jesus said, ."Blessed are the peacemakers," not the peact"/overs. Soldiers have risked much in war. What are we willing to risk for peace?

The age of the dinosaurs returns at the Moreau Galleries 
by Margaret McCabe 
features staff writer 
W
ho says dinosaurs are extinct? Obviously, they haven't been to Moreau Hall at Saint Mary's lately to see how Keevie McCarthy has managed to bring back a little bit of The Mesozoic Era 
According to Keevie, a senior art major, she woke up one February morning and, "wanted to do some­thing really big." Well, six months, 50 yards ofchicken wire, and 60 pounds offlour later, big is exactly what Keevie had. "Bruno," named by those around who watched him come to life, is a 1 5 foot long and seven foot tall papier-mache 
dinosaur. 
Some ofyou may have seen Bruno displayed in the lobby ofO'Laughlin Auditorium during the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre's production of"The Skin ofOur Teeth." 
Besides her hopes ofcreating something big, Keevie wanted her work ofart to "generate enthusiasm in people and spark interests and ideas." Bruno clearly demonstrates Keevie's determination to do just thaL The dinosaur was not made as an art class project, but was an inde­pendent undertaking. Thus, besides consuming a great deal ofher spare time, Bruno consumed ap­proximately $1 00 ofKeevie's spare money. 

This sum covered the costofwire, flour, lacquer sanding sealer, and a gold dust powder that gives Bruno his color. The paper that was used is the brown type found on rolls in public bathrooms. This was the only material used that didn't require funds as it was graciously supplied by the Ladies' room at Moreau. 
Keevie did not refer to books or pictures in making Bruno, only her imagination. She started her project in a dark, damp, quiet crawl space in Moreau. According to Keevie, "The atmosphere was conducive to creat­ing a creature from the past." 
In favorable weather, Keevie worked on Bruno outside and soon discovered that there may be a market for papier-mache dinosaurs. One passer-by wanted to put Bruno on top ofhis house for a graduation party. Another wanted to mount the dinosaur on top ofhis car. (It could be fun at tailgaters.) 
With many new projects under way now and graduate school in her future, Keevie is looking for a home for Bruno. There is a possibility he will be donated to a local park. In this case, Keevie would add a coat of plastic sealer to make Bruno weather resistant. Ifnot, Keevie may sell herdinosaur, as is, to anyone out there who is looking for a little, or rather, a big conversation piece for his or her dorm room. 




'Made in Italy' 
shownatSMC 
Special to The Observer 
'T"'he works ofGiuseppe Gattuso 
.l l..omonte, professor ofprintmak­ing at the Academy ofFine Arts in Florence, Italy, and the director of the Santa Reparata Graphic Arts Cen­ter in Florence, are on display in the Hammes Gallery at Saint Mary's Col­lege from now until Dec. I 5. 
Tht· exhibit, entitled "Giuseppe Gattuso Lomonte: Made in Italy," will include etchings and lit­hographs and some studies, drawings and photographs ofhis present work in sculpture. 
A native ofToretta in Sicily, Gat­tuso Lomonte has exhibited steadily throughout Italy, Europe and the United States since 1960. His im­agery deals with primeval clements ofchildho<:.d myths and is ap­proached with the same childlike simplicity. 
Agraduate ofthe Academy ofFine Arts in Florence, Gattuso Lomonte received a prize from the West Ger­man government at the III Biennial InternationalofGraphic Art at Palaz­zo Strozzi in Florence and was awarded first prize for the best sculpture at the XI Rassegna Arti Visive at Campi Bixenzio. 
The Saint Mary's galleries are open from 9:30a.m. to noon and I to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. The galleries are closed on Saturday, but are open from I to 3 p.m. on Sunday. There is no admission charge. 
Since 1970, Gattuso Lomonte has concentrated on sculpture. He has worked with clay, plaster, wood and metal. He often ha~ directly painted, drawn orscratched on the sculpture to conform to his imagery. His ap­proach in printmaking has the same directness. 

A gift of history 
Professor A.L. Gabriel, director emeritus of the University's Medieval Institilte, holds the first of10 incunabula he is donating to the Notre Dame Memorial Library. Incunabula are books published before /500, and Gabriel's initial gift volume contains the Sunday sermons on the Gospels preached by Dinkesbuhl, a teacher at the University of Vienna, published in /496 in Strassburg, France. A collector ofrare books, Gabriel has been instrumental in building up Library's holdings in medieval studies.

Dillon hall won its 2tst consecutive game and their third straight intcrhall championship with a 21-6 victory over Stan­ford hall yesterday. A game story by Tom Antonini will be in tomor­row's paper. -The Observer forget is the last 13 minutes of the game in which it saw its 12-point lead quickly disappear as the defense, which had been very ef­fective for three quarters, started to collapse. The key play was a dropped interception by Chris Brown that fell into the hands offal­con wide receiver Mike Kirby. 
Following the touchdown and a missed extra point by Air Force kick­er Sean Pavlich, Irish kick returner Alonzo Jefferson returned the kick­off 91 yards for the score. However, the exciting run was called back be­cause ofa clipping penalty. 
The Falcons began what proved to be the winning drive with 6:52 left on the clock and the end.zone 74 yards away. On the second play of the drive, Brown took the handoff, went up the middle, cut to the left sideline, broke a tackle, caused one cornerback to slip, and pick~d up 42 ofhis 148 yards. 
The run got Air Force to the Notre 
Dame 34-yard line. From there, the 
Falcons hulled the ball up the 
middle of a suddenly porous Irish 
defensive line. Finally, John 
Kershner broke a tackle and fell into 
the endzone for a one-yard touch· 
down with 1:35left. 
Kiel, who deserved a better en­ding than he received, promptly led the Irish downfield. Starting from the 29, Kiel hit Pinkett with two passes to get the Irish into Falcon territory. Two runs by Chris Smith and another pass to Pinkett set up Johnston's field goal try. 
"I felt like I hit it solid," said Johnston. "I still had my head down when I heard it hit. I didn't see the line break down but Coach told me that somebody just blew an assign­
ment." 
"We felt their kicker was a low 
kicker and it was a slick fi-eld that 
would also cause a kick to go lower,"

explained Hatfield. "We told our guys not to come in low like they usually do, but ~tand up and stay high." 
The strategy worked as lineman Chris Funk, who had already blocked a 50-yard Johnston attempt, got his left hand up and deflected the kick. 
"We showed what could be ac­
complished when the players 
believe in each other and the ad­
ministration and God," said Hatfield. 
"They pulled together. It was a 
tremendous game, and I couldn't be 
prouder ofour team. 
"It shows its fun to play the game offootball and it shows that anything can be accomplished in life. The team is bigger than the individual." 
It is good to sec that somebody is having fun right now, because the Irish sure are not. Maybe the Liberty Bowl could changt: all that.

McCandless victorious in flag football final 
ByJEAN CRUTCHER 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's intramural flag football season came to a close yes­terday afternoon with McCandless defeating Off-cantpus 21-6. Earlier this season when the two teams met, McCandless won by a much closer score of6-0. 
On a cold and windy afternoon when passing wa~ near impossible, running plays became the key to vic­tory. 
· Sophomore Jenny McCauley scored the first of her three touch­downs for McCandless early in the first half. With a successful attempt at the extra point, McCandless led 7 · 0. 
Second half action saw McCauley score her second touchdown on a long rardage running play. McCand­less converted the extra point and 
led 14-0. 
Off-campus finally got on the board in the second half when senior Mary Schneeman carried the ball into the endzone for the touch­down. After the extra point failed, off-campus trailed 6-14. 
The final touchdown of the after­noon came as McCauley scored for the third and final time on a short yardage play with less than one minute remaining in the game. On a pitch out McCauley successfully scored the extra point and the cham­pionship for 1983 went to McC~nd­less. 
Final standings for the season have McCandless on top with an 8-1 record, OffCampus in second with a 5 and 4 record followed by Holy Cross ( 4-4 ), and Regina and LeMans tied at the bottom with 2 and 6 records.

UCLA-Illinois in Rose Bowl 

Associated Press 
For the second straight year, the University of Washington Huskies have come away with the best con· solation prize in sports. 
Hoping to avenge a 1982 loss to 
Washington State that knocked 
them out of the Rose Bowl and into 
the Aloha Bowl, the Huskies found 
that lightning does indeed strike 
twice. Saturday's 17-6 loss to Wash· 
ington State, coupled with UCLA's 
27-17 victory over Southern Califor· 
nia, rerouted the 15th-ranked 
Huskies out of the Rose Bowl and 
onto the beach at W aikiki for their 
second straight appearance in the 
Aloha Bowl, this time against Penn 
State. 
But there was jubilation in Los An.. geles, where UCLA, which recovered nicely from an 0·3·1 start, defeated Southern Cal and made it to the Rose Bowl for the second straight year, a first 
Ironically, the Rose Bowl is UCLA's home field. Fifth-ranked Miami also will be performing before the home folks on jan. 2. The Hurricanes, who completed a 10·1 regular season a week ago, accepted a bid to meet No. I Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
The bowl bids were all an· nounced Saturday with only one recalcitrant from the reported pairings ofa week ago. Notre Dame, which wound up a 6-5 campaign by losing to Air Force 23..22, had second thoughts about its Liberty Bowl commitment to meet No. 18 Boston College. 
The rest of the bowl lineup looks like this: Cotton -no. 2 Texas vs. No. 7 Georgia Sugar -no. 3 Auburn vs. No. 8 Michigan. Rose -no. 4 n.. linois vs. UCLA. Sun -no. 6 South· ern Methodist vs. No. 16 Alabama Holiday -no. 9 Brigham Young vs. No. 19 Missouri. Fiesta -No. 10 Ohio State vs. No. 17 Pitt. Gator ­no.

Dolphins thrash Baltimore, 37-0 

Associated Press 
The Miami Dolphins opened some daylight for themselves in the tight Ainerican Conference East race with a 37·0 thrashing of the Bal· timore Colts on an embarrassing day for many National Football League teams. 
Along with the Colts' whitewash· ing, no less than three other teams were shut out on a day marked by lopsided games, as the Cleveland Browns whipped the New England Patriots 30-0, the Chicago Bears beat the Tampa Bay Bucs 27·0 and the New York Giants blanked the Philadelphia Eagles 23·0. 
Dan Marino's 85-yard pass to Mark Duper and Mark Clayto t n's 60-yard punt return for Miami touchdowns only 42 seconds apart in the second quarter triggered the Colts rout. The victory gave the Dolphins an 8-4 record and a one-game lead in the AFC east over the Buffalo Bills, 27-24 losers to the Los Angeles Raiders. 
In other early afternoon games, the Minnesota Vikings upset the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-14; the Detroit Uons defeated the Green Bay Packers 23-20 in overtime; the St. Louis Cardinals bombed the San Diego Chargers 44-I4 and the Cin· cinnati Bengals crushed the Hous· ton Oilers 38·1 0. 
In late afternoon action, the Washington·Redskins routed the Los Angeles Rams 42-20; the Atlanta Fal­cons edged the San Francisco 49ers 28-24; the Dallas Cowboys whipped the Kansas City Chiefs 41-21 and the 
Denver Broncos outscoreo the 
Seattle Seahawks 38-27. 
Tonight, the New York jets play 
the New Orleans Saints in the Su· 
perdome. 
john Riggins smasbed into the end 
zone on three short touchdown runs 
as the Redskins overpowered the 
Rams. The win kept the Redskins in a 
first-place tie with Dallas in the NFC 
east with a 10·2 record. The Rams, 
now 7·5, remain tied for first place in 
the NFC west with San Francisco. 
Riggins' three touchdowns ran his 1983 total to 19 and tied him for the league lead in TDs with Rams rookie Eric Dickerson and also equaled an NFL mark for touchdowns rushing in a single season, shared by three other players. The Redskin defen· ders intercepted Rams quarterback Vince Ferragamo four times and held Dickerson, the NFL's leading rusher, to just 3 7 yards on I2 carries -the fewest yards in his brief pro career. 
Steve Bartkowski fired a despera­tion pass of4 7 yards to BillyJohnson on the final play of the game to lead Atlanta over San Francisco. Bartkowski threw the ball into a crowd of players inside the 5-yard line and it was tipped out to the 7 to Johnson, who squirmed into the end 
zone. 
The game-winning play capped a 73-yard drive that started with I :04­remaining, six seconds after Joe Montana had given the 49ers a 24-21 lead by scrambling II yards for a touchdown to cap a 51-yard drive. 
Tony Dorsett, who had branded 
the Dallas running game "disgraceful," scored two touch· downs and became the ninth player in NFL history to gain more than 8,000 yards, carrying the Cowboys over the Chiefs. 
Dorsett dashed 28 and 32 yards for touchdowns as he went over the I ,000-yard mark for the sixth time in seven seasons. 
Denver rookie quarterback Gary 
Kubiak, who had never before taken 
a snap in an NFL game, passed for 
one touchdown and ran for another, 
and Rich Karlis booted five field 
goals as the Broncos defeated the 
Seahawks, who lost eight turnovers. 
Kubiak was forced into a starting 
role when rookie John Elway c;une 
down with the flu yesterday morn­
ing. 
Duper's scoring catch, just one yard shy ofMiami's longest pass play ever, boosted the Dolphins' lead to 17·0 with 1:42 to go in the first half and they were on their way. 
Marino said Duper "came up, I looked at him and he took off and I just threw it as fur as I could. It was a great play by Mark." 
"He's the one that made the play," Duper said of Marino. "He held the ball until I could get across the field." 
After Miami's defense held, Clayton took Rohn Stark's punt on one bounce, scooted past one Colt, sliced to his left and scampered be­hind a wall ofblockers for his TD.

Yugoslavian stars signs to play Irish basketball 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Writer 

Nineteen-yt:ar-old Drazon Petrovic, a 6-4 guard for the Yugos­lavian National basketball team, has signed a national letter of intent to attend Notre Dame, Irish head coach Diggn Phelps announced late Friday morning. 
"He signed the papers the other night," said Phelps. "Thrrgives us, I think, another solid class hehind this class." 
Petrovic, whose 24 points led all scorers in last Wednesday night's 7';-7.3 Notre Dame victory over the Yugo~lavians, first caught the eye of lrbh fans last Nov. 21 when l).e scored 1.-\ points in the Yugoslavian team's visit to South Bend. 
Petrovic also plays for Club Sihenka in Yugoslavia and is a mem­hn of the Yugoslavian Army, in which he still has six months ofduty to serve. He will continue to be busy right up until the time he returns to campus next fall as a freshman. 
"He still plays on the National team and in the Olympics," said Phelps. "After the Olympics, he'll be here as a freshman. That's his plan now. He is signed to do that. If he comes to the United States to play college basketball, he's coming to play at Notre Dame. Between now and then, hopefully he shows up." 
Phelps later quipped, "We signed him. But watch the Russians start a war and we'll lose him." 
Petrovic is the fourth player to commit to Notre Dame for next season. Already signed are Dave Rivers, a 6-0 guard from Jersey City, N.J., Matt Beeuwsaert, a 6-6 forward from Santa Ana, Calif., and Gary Voce, a 6-9 forward from the Bronx in New York City. 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar The Notre Dame hockey team faced its toughest competition ofthe season as they sweptSt. Thomas 3-2 and 7-5 this weekend, J.eeping their record perfect at
scores 3,OOOth point 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -For 
more than 14 seasons, Kareem 
Ahdui-Jahhar has played his finesse 
game against the bruising centers of 
the National Basketball Association. 
"I've played well a long time," the 
7-foot-2 veteran of tht· Los Angeles 
!.akers said. "It don't come easy." 
Perhaps the points didn't come 
t·asy, hut they did come. Saturday 
night, Abdul-Jahbar became the 
second player in NBA history to 
score 50.000 points in hi~ career. 
"This is really something more for 
the basketball fans to talk about," 
Ahdui-Jabbar said after reaching the 
milestone. 

Now, it appears likely that the 
soft-spoken, .36-year-old, with a new 
two-year contract, will break the all­
time scoring record o£31,419 points set in 14 seasons by Wilt Chamber­lain. The record is not an all­consuming goal for Abdul-Jabbar. 
"If I get it, I'll get it," he said. 
"I hope he gets it this year," said 
!.akers' Coach Pat Riley, adding with 
a smile, "Maybe I'd like to hold him 
hack and get him motivated for next 
year." 

No other player is close to 
challenging Chamberlain's record. 
Elvin Hayes of the Houston Rockets, 
who is in the twilight ofhis career, is 
third on tht· all-time list with 26.975 
points. 

Playing in his 1,10 Ist NBA game Saturday night, Abdul-Jabbar scored 20 points in a I I7-I I0 Los Angeles victory over Portland, giving him .30,007 career points. 
"lie's been consistent for 14 years," Riley said. 
"It's remarkable that a player can have the offensive production he's had year after year," said Portland Coach Jack Ramsay. "To average 27 points a game like he has is tremen­dous." 
Hamsay said it was poimless to ask who was a better player -Cham­berlain or Abdui-Jabbar. 
"They're just different players," Ramsay said. "Wilt was a power player and Kareem is a finesse player." 
Ramsay also said that the addition this Sl·ason of backup center Swen Natn will help add to Abdui-Jabhar's longevity as a player. 
"This year he doesn't have to play !)ig minutes," Ramsay said. "It looks likt· he'll he ahlc: to play 30 minutes or so per game." 
Abdui-Jabbar needed 13 points against Portland to reach the 30,000-point plateau. He scored I I points in the first quarter. 
"I wanted him to get it in the first quarter and get it over with," Riley said. 
But he missed his only shot in the second quarter and didn't get his next two points until he was fouled by Portland guard Darnell Valentine 
with 5:07 left in the half 

Down the stretch, Abdui-Jabbar 
helped thwart a Portland rally with 
seven points, including an important 
three-point play in the closing 
seconds. 

Portland's Mychal Thompson 
marve!ed at Abdui-Jabbar's achieve­
ment. 

"That is the epitome of consis­
tency for him to be that good," he 
said.
