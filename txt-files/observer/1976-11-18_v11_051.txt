NBC accepts restrictions 


\\-aSHINGTON AP--The govern­ment agreed yesterday to settle an antitrust suit against the National Broadcasting Co. after NBC accept­ed a broad range of restrictions on the production of entertainment programs. 
Similar suits against the CBS and ABC television networks arc still pending. 
Under terms of the settlement. NBC must limit the amount of entertainment programming it pro­duces. This would force the network to purchase more pro­
grams from independent produc­ers. This restriction would continue for I 0 years.

"Nobody denies that the asset or resource most valuable to a busi­ness organization is the human resource.·· Dr. Ken Milani , C.P.A.* told a small group of students and faculty in HayesHealy yesterday afternoon. "but typical management actions in most busi­nesses today show little under­standing of that importance." 
Milani. an assistant accounting professor at Notre Dame. made his remarks in a talk entitled "It Doesn't 'Add' Up: The Role of Human Resource Accounting in Effecting Work Humanization." The Lecture, which was the last in a series dealing with the design of humanistk work environments. was sponsored by Notre Dame's College of Business Administra­tion. 
Interspersing his talk with com­parisons and anecdotes from pro­fessional accounting. the process of evaluating an employees lllonetarv worth. has had a positive effect on work humanization efforts. 
The concept. said Milani. has been hindered by disagreement about how it should be developed and utilized. Advocates of human resource accounting he continued. "feel that inturmatwn about an organization's human resources is a necessarv element of well­managed an-d a humanistic organi­zation.·· 
But there is dispute. according to Milani, over such basic questions as whether an employee can be defined as an asset or resource. and if so. how can a worker's value be measured. "Machines don't walk out on you." said Milani, "people do." 
None of the present models for a human resource accounting system have gained wide acceptance, Mi­lani pointed out. and opponents charge that the idea is both too costly and too "subjective." "The uniqueness of each person makes it hard to place a value on them," he 
quoted one critic. 
Milani also explained the posi­tion which argues that to effectively evaluate an employee, it would be necessary to gather personal in­formation pertaining to the wor­ker's home life and other related variables which could conceivably affect job performance. Employ­ers. he emphasized. are afraid that such "evaluations" might leak out among personnel. 
Summing .up. Milani said, 
"We've now had almost a decade of research. debate, and academic and practical applications and it seems unlikely ~o me that human resource accounting is going to be a panacea for the work humanization field." 
"Right now it doesn't add up." he commented. "Human resource accounting is not playing a key role in effecting work humanization at this time.'' In fact, he noted. many efforts have been concerned only with gauging performance and have ignored the original purpose. 
Looking at the future, Milani reemphasized that "the reason we ~llnt to develop·a·human resource a~unting system is . to ~ncourage greater work humamzatton. What

IUD's cause deaths 
BOSTON [API Fifteen of every 
100.000 women who continue to wl:'ar intrauterine devices -IUD's ­after becoming pregnant die from infected spontaneous abortions. a federal studv says. 
That death rate is SO times higher than among women who do not usc: the IUD birth control method. the studv said. 
The researchers siad that, be­cause of the danger. women should have their IlJDs removed at the first sign of '1regnancy. 
IUDs are plastic shields. loops or coils inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. However. about two percent of the time they fail. and women become pregnant anyway. 
The study says that if these women fail to have their IUDs removed, they run a risk of dying form infected. or septic. abortions that occur spontaneously. unlike those induced by doctors. 
The research was conducted bv 
the federal Center for Disease 
Control in Atlanta. It was sche­
duled to be published in today's 
issue of the New England Journal 
of Medicine. 
The study is the latest in a series 
of reports that raise questions 
about the effects of IUDs on 
pregnancy. The researchers said 
theirs is the first study to deter­
mine the death rate among women 
who continue to wear the birth 
control device while pregnant. 
·'This was menat to be the final 
nail in the coffin with regard to 
IUDs involved. in septic spontane­ous abortion." Dr. Willard Cates Jr.. who directed the study. said in an interview. 
The doctors reached their con­clusions after surveying all abor­tion-related deaths in the United States between 1972 and 1974. During that time. there were 33 deaths. and thcv estimated that 
115.000 pregnant women were 
wearing IUDs and 11.9 million were not. 
Thcv found there were about IS deaths among every 100.000 wo­men who kept wearing their IUDs while pregnant. Among women who did not have IUDs. there was only a fral'!ion of one death per I 00.000. 
"We conclude that the risk of death from spontaneous abortion in the United States is over SO times greater in women continuing a pregnancy with IUDs than in those without IUDs in place." the re­
searchers wrote.  
Until  about  two  years  ago.  
doctors left IUDs in  place during  
pregnancy.  bacausc  they  feared  

removal would cause an abortton. However. in 1974. the Food and Drug Administration urged doctors to remove the devices. if possible. during pregnancy because of mounting evidence that they caused complications. 
Since then. the number of abor­tion-related deaths among women with IUDs has declined. 
The greatest threat of IUDs now. Cates said. is to women in the earlv stages of pregnancy. ­

One of Swaebe's tirst moves was to hold a huge and widely advcr­ti-.,cd sale of lod merchandise at, hiur of the New YOrk -based chain's largest stores. He cut back warehouse space and dropped low­priced or fad merchandise which the store could not sell at a profit. 
As the old merchandise went out. in came the new look -which actually was a return to the retailer's original approach.

According to Swaebe. the store docs brisk business in shearling­lined suede and leather coat~ for men and women -starting at $550. Other lines he hopes will mean success arc outdoor clothing. wo­men'-, sportswear and expensive gifts from around the world. 
"See for yourself why there's no other store yuite like us," Aber­crombie proclaimed in newspaper advertisements. "You might say that we're more than a store. we're a life-stvle." 
A major problem Swaevc faced when he took over was how to convince suppliers that the chian ­which reportedly lost $1.5 million in the last two years -was a good credit risk. 
"Wc were very fortunate to obtain interim financing from the First National Bank of Chicago." Swacbe said. While he would not disclose the amount of financing, the head of the chain that was $6 million in debt this summer said. "it's sufficient to do our job. 
·'I think you have a problem if you try to sell from an empty wagon," he said. "We're cur­rently in the position where we have sufficient goods arriving daily to be able to tell the public that 
we're in business."

The U.S. exhibit director. Frank 
Ursino. angrily asked Soviet offi­
L'ials whv it took more than three 
hoiurs fo-r a bomb detection team to 
arrive to make certain the pavillion 
was safe to reopen the exhibit. The 
officials apoligized profusely. say­
ing they had difficulty tinding an 
expert in plastic explosives. 

Ouring the evacuation, Kuzmen­
ko, the Soviet official who took the 
warning call. remained in his office 
on the telephone and showed no 
fear uf being a bomb victim. 

American officials said they also 
found it curious that minutes 
before the warning call a city 
ambulance pulled up to the build­
ing for no apparent reason. After 
the building was evacuated. the 
ambulance left without any pas­
sengers. 

"I think it was suspicious," said 
one American official who refused 
to be quoted by name. "You can't 
prove it. of course." said another, 
"but it smells fishy." 

The incident rcmainded Ameri­can residents of two bomb scares at the U.S. Embassy last March. Embassy officials were convinced the thre-ats were officially inspired in retaliation for harassment of Soviet diplomats by Jewish extre­mists in New York.

Malaleuca tree threatens Florida with nonstop growth 
MIAMI AP--The ml'lalcuca tree, once con~idcred valuable because of its fast growth. now threatens Ill choke Florida CO!l!>Crvation areas. And scientists sav thev don't know quite how to stop-it. · 
"You can envision a stretch of trees all the wav acro!>s the state the wa\· it's going." said Tyler Alcxanoc1, a UniversitY of M1am1 biology professor. "We haven't really seen anything to compete with it.·· 
"Its abililty to take over is an 
extreme threat to the natural 
areas," added Dr. Ronald Hofstett­
er. an ecological biologist at the 
university. .. rwcnty-tive percent 
of South Florida could be solid 
forest bv the end of the century." -Standing alone. the scr~ggly 
mclaleuea hardlv seems sinister. It 
was brought to ~outhern Florida 75 
year~ ago to help dry swampy 
areas. Later on it caught on as an 
ornamental plant. 
Also known as the punk tree.. it was once valued bv landscapers for its deep green leaves and pulpy white bark and used widely be­cause of its fast growth. Many communities have since banned the tree. 
Now. biologists studying the member of the eucalyptus family say the plant is invading Florida's interior and threatening conserva­tion areas. Some warn that heavy stands arc alrcad~· choking swamp­land. 
Biologists say the tree is draining valued wetlands and can with~tand adverse conditions ranging from drought to flood. 
"The mclalcuca is probably the most serious long-term threat to the Everglades. considering its potential to come in here." he says. 
Killing a mclalcuca is a risky business. The trees can release up to 20 million seeds at death. Biologists say if the tree is cut. it can sprout a stump or send several additional shoots up from the root system. 
Botanists sav the onlv wav to destroy the tree is to cut .it. cart it awav before the seeds arc released and.trcat the stump with herbicide.

Direction of mankind described 
by Donna Berndt Staff Reporter 
"The Student as King, an Epistemological Reversal'' was.the subject of a talk, by Robert Barry last night before acapacity crowd in Carroll Hall. The Professor of Philosophy from Loyola University in Chicago discussed "epistemolo­gical reversal as a knowledge reversal whereby the shift of education is from teaching to learning." 
Barry began by defining the direction of mankind as "the shift from monarchv to democracy." He explained that the movement has resulted in the liberation of all institutiOns. particularly the educa-

. Apathy ts a highly contagtous dtscasc dccpl~· infecting the Amct ican pcuple. Frustration. t·auscd b1 the feeling that one voice eann~t po-;.,ibly be heard in a sea of 217 million. is largl'l~· responsible for the present disinterest that per­vades soeiL·tv. W c often have the 
• ham·e to v'nice our opinion but rarclv utilitl' it. 
With the Pn_•sidential cll'ction~ b·~hind us. the natinnwirlc "Orfer­ing of Letlcrs" to pu~h U11itcd State~ parti,·ipatior: in a world :'0od reserve program is mr·\· unde1 "·ay. Last ~Tar's "Offering or. Letters" gencratl'd more than 240.000 let­ters (500 of which came from the Notre Dame-St. M:~rv's commun­it~·) to members of· Congress of behalf of the Right to Food resolu­tion. passed September. 1476. The passage of such a resolution is a statement to the fan that the riPilt of e1crvonc to a nutrition;'llv adcquat~· diet must be a bo.~sic part of U.S. P')lil'V. 
Now Wl' need lctlcrs asking the Prc...idcnt·elcct and the nc\dV elected Congress for an action that would begin to implement the right to food: U.S. participation in a world food reserve program. A food reserve program i<; essential in our efforts to reduce hunger. The major points of this proposed world fc;od reserve arc as follows: 
I . A food resene program could prevent countless deaths and wide­spread suffering. At the 1974 U.N. World Food Conference the United States-along with other nations­committed itself to an international food reserve program, with grain stocks held nationally. Famines were raging in many lands, food was scarce and prices had skyroc­keted for hundreds of millions of the world's poorest and hungriest people. The nccd'fur a food reserve system was recognized. and agreed upon. by all the nations at that conference. But we have yet to act. 
2. 
The U.S. response is crucial. Last year the United States sold more than half of all grain traded internationally, and this fact alone makes its actions decisive. Clearly. we have a responsibility-and a unique ability-to participate in development of a reserve that assures sufficient grain supplies for humanitarian food needs in bad years. Our country will largely determine whether the world establishes a food reserve· or in­vites catastrophe. Time is slipping by.

3. 
A food reserve program can and should be fair to farmers. A reserve policy can be developed which protects farmers' incomes, 


while sheltering both farmer and consumer from the disruptivl' 
effects of boom-and-bust cycles. 
4. A food resen·e should be part of a national food and nutrition polin that effectiveh· addresses nutrftional neerls · both within the United States and abroad. At ptTscnt the Univ:d States has a patchwork of food policies made by 26 cxccuti\T branch agencies. Decisions tend to he short-range and often work at cross purpose:;. 
S. A food reser\C would be ~ne important wa)· of saying, "We affirm the right of e,·er) person to a nutritional!)· adequate diet." 
h. A unique opportunity lies before us. The Prcsidcnt-eleet and the newly-elected Congress need to hear an appeal from us for a food reserve. We have reason to make ·.uch an appeal. Do we not have a gracious Father whl' has been kind :.~nd forgiving to u~ in Christ'! A ·~od who loves others no less than i L' loves us'! And who has called us to "let justice roll down like the w;•tcrs"'! 
The Notre Dame-Saint Man·'s World Hinger Coalition is sponsor­ing its second annual Thanksgiving "Offering of Letters" drive to support this World Food Reserve resolution. Letters should be stamped and addressed t•> a par­ticular congressman or senator. prcfcrablv those from your home ~tate .. ln. writing the · Prcsidcnt­clcet. also stress the importance of his appointing a new Secretary of .·\griculturc who is in support of the <rbjcctivcs of the Right to Food resolution and rcadv to endorse 
U.S. participation ln an inter­national reserve system. The let­ters can be submitted at the Umvcrsity Thanksgiving Mass this Monday night. November 22. at 10 
p.m. in Sacred Heart Church or to any Coalition member. 
The time for action is at hand. Ll't'~ call upon Congress and our President-elect to support a new vision of justice regarding our hungry brothers and sisters. whose right to food points the wav. And let's ask the new Congress to express that right by establishing our part of a world food reserve.

Where does 
Notre Dame 
Get Her 





Money? 
b~ Drew J. Bauer 
Part one. 
It will probably not surprise you that tuition does not bring in all of the $63.849,709 needed to balance this year'·s budget. But what might surprise you is the variety of sources from which NO gets the rest of the money it needs. The sources range from the m~ney it collects when you pay your laundry bill to the money the little old lady in Pasadena spends on her annual ND·USC ticket. 
The basic statistics on NO's income can be found in the "financial statements" of Jne 30. 1976, a 12-page compiliation of the University's financial status. Repeated attempts 'to obtain more detailed informa­tion were met by repeated "no-com­ments." 
For instance. when The Observer tried.to find out how much each of the auxiliarv enterprises such as the bookstore and the ACC made last year. and in each case the managers of these operations refused to comment. saying that Joyce was the only one with the authority to talk. 
"We have not made that information public since 1973." Joyce said when asked how much the Bookstore made last year. "We used to give out that informati~n in the past. but we have changed our minds about it because we feel that it's meaning­less." 
·'There has never been any pressure for that information. There has not been any suggestion either that the report (the 1976 Financial report) should be broadened or more details be given," he said. 
Joyce was also asked that since he is a 
C.P.A. wouldn't he need the profit and loss figures of these operations to prepare the university. Joyce said that he did have the figures in his desk draweres but that it was no longer the policy of the university to give out specific figures for the auxiliary enterprises. He said that this was because they gave out the 'raw figures' without depreciation and overhead figured in with

them. people were running around campus talking about how one was making so muc money while the others were losing so much. 
Tuition 
About 38 percent of the annual budget's revenues comes from student tuition. Last year $24.942.902 was collected from the student bodv. and increase of $800.000 from the vea'r before. 
Both iovce and Thomas J. Manson. Vice-president for Business Affairs expect that tuition will rise next year. "Tuition is really the last variable we can look at when we a~e trying to balance our budget.'' said Manson. "So when it comes down to a point when it looks like we are going to have a deficit. and there is no other source for the needed money. we are going to have to raise tuition." 
Joyce noted that there is a projected $450,000 deficit in this year's budget. The university, however. did not raise tuition even more last year because he thinks that they can economize enough to break even by the end of the year. 
Manson said that he is not worried even if the deficit is still present by the end of the year. "We like to look at things in a three year cycle. We have a deficit projected in this year's budget. but last year we had a surplus that will negate this years deficit, so everything should balance. However. one can not continue to run a deficit budget every year without jeopard­izing the operation. You must look at the three year cycle and hope that everything will balance out. or you will continue to 

Manson would like the students to tie any incre~se in the tu~tion to the i~flation rate, saytng that pnces are gotng up everwhere, not just in education. But Manson warns. "Even if prices would stay the same and there would not be any inflation for awhile, we still might have to increase tuition because our faculty is saying that they are underpaid and we agree with them," 
"We do not have a magical pot of gold to draw on like the public institutions." said Manson. "Revenue from students is the heart of our operation." 
Auxiliary Enterprises 
Thenumerous busint•ssesthat operate on campus also contribute directly to the general budget. These auxiliary enter­prises include the bookstore. dining halls, residence halls, varsitY athletics. the Athletic and Convocation center and the Morris Inn. 
In the latest financial statement. thc~e enterprises earned revenues of $19.JH 1.­191 against expenditures of $17 .H9J .. 
974. These figures do not include either depreciation or overhead costs. 
The fiscal vear June 1972-Junc 1973. the last year in ~·hich the auxiliarv enterprise~ reve.nues and expenses wc~e somewhat broken down, showed that the Morris Inn. the ACC and the bookstore together had revenue of $o.I92.0HI against cosh of $6,072.445. Again these figures do not include depreciation or overhead. 
"The bookstore is primarily a service to the universitY." said Jon·c, "and fortu­nately because of the great popularitv of Notre Dame and the creal crowd~ that come here for football and alumni \\l'ek­cnds it is a profitable business. The students should be thankful of that because it keeps the tuition down." 
Speaking of the profit the bookstore~ makes. Brother Conan Moran, manager nf the store said "that it's a fair amount. But our profit is lower than other retail sh>re~ in the area." 
"We are not any different from other schools in the count~y." he added." except that some other sch~ols charge 20 percent more for the same things that we sell. Our prices arc low when you look around." 
Moran explained that contrary to the popular belief. prices arc not set high just because of the mobs that attacks the store before every football gan1c. He al~o said that the store could not afford to give the students a discourll or rebate like some other colleges acniSs the country. "We are a service to the students and facultv and no matter who ran the service. it will.still co~t moncv. Moran refused to elaborate further on the store's figures. except to note that the store had no set profit pcccntagc to meet. 
Dining and Residence Halls 
Adding the $H.oon.ooo annual room and 
board fee~ to the tuition mean~ that 
students pav about 53 percent of the 
budget. 

"We just try and break even in these 
operations." Joyce said. "We arc blcs~ed 
with the fact that the size of our dining 
halls is vcrv economical. Other school-, 
have tried to put a dining hall in each of 
their residence halls and this costs them a 
lot of moncv.' · 

"We arc-also blessed with the present 
situation of our halls. in that the co~t wa~ 
low at construction and we do not have a 
mortgage to pay on most of the halls." 
Jovcc said. 

The financial records The Obsener were 
able to obtain showed the dining and 
resident halls with $200.000-$500.000 loss 
each of the last six vcars. In 1970. the 
operation made abo~t a $60,000 "ra" 
profit.·· 

The ACC 
The ACC tries to strike a happy balance 
between events for the students· usc and

British to deport former CIA agent 
UINllON !API -In a rare move, the Briti"h gmL·rnment ~aid ycs­ll"rda\ it plan" to deport Philip

The spokesman also said Agee "has been and continues to be involved in disseminating informa­tion harmful to the secrutiy of the llnited Kingdom." as well as helping other~ to obtain such information for publication. 
Agee. 41. responded that the allegatiou~ arc totally false." He contended the move was prompted In the United States and aimed to block him from publishing a second hook revealing CIA secreh. 
The rarity of the deportation step was hl'lie\ed to rdlcrt the serious­ness with which the government views the cases of Agee and Mark Hosenball. an American reporter for the London Evening Standard. The move to oust Hosenball on similar grounds was disclosed Tuesday. 

The Home Office spoksman des­cribed as "total and complete nonsense" Agee's contention that the almost unprecedented move resulted from CIA or U.S. govern­ment pressure. 
After his service with the spy agency. primarily in Latin America, Agee wrote a book, "!side the

Congreo,~ional approval for the pn)gram came late last o,cssion as part of a public work'> hill. Spcciti­,·alh. the hill authorized the U.S. Anm Corps of Engineers. in cooperation with the state of Illinois and the Chicago Metropolitan San­itan Distriet. to increase the div~-rsion of Lake Michigan water frnm the current allowable amount of 3.200 cubic feet per second. 

The measure was intended to lower water levels in some of the Great Lakes where property owners have complained of erosion dam­age due to high water. A state official also has said it would improve the water qualit:v of Illinois rt\ei'S. 
But Marlin. who lives in Urbana. 

said the additional diversion "isn't going to do a thing to control erosion. I t would lower the water level in Lake Michigan by less than 
half an inch. and it would take ten vcars to stabilize at that level." . Furthermore. the increased diversion would worsen drainage problems of levee districts along the Illinois River. Marlin said, resulting in higher pumping costs for the districts. 
i\nd because the water table is high anywa:-.· in farm fields ncar ril'l'rs. he said. the increased divcr~ion could impair farm pro­ductivity by making the land too wet to work during planting sea­son. 
"A nother problem is there·s no provision in the bill to compensate the farmer if this diversion does destroy his crops. The govern­ment's under no obligation and the farmer's left holding the bag." Marlin said.

Company: CIA Diary," published two years ago. It described agency operations in detail and disclosed names of agents. He is · now working on the secnd book. 
The cases of Agee· and Hosen­ball, 25, were believed t6 be connected, but the Home Office spoksman refused to comment officially on this or to give any further details of the charges against the two men. 
The spoksman saicl -both Agee and Hosenball have two. weeks to" make representations" to an inde­pendent tribual of three w~ll­known public figures which advises the Home Office on security mat­ters. 
Hosenball said the deportation order against him· "undoubtedly hinges on some story I did ln my capacity as a journalist for Time· Out magazine," an unorthodox guide for young people. He said the story concerned the British govern­ment's communications headquar­ters. 
Agee said he could not tell whether his case and Hosenball's were linked. He added, "I have worked with Mark and many other journalists on the question of the CIA presence in many different countries.'' Hosenball said he had talked with Agee but never worked directly with him. 
It is believed the provision under whihc the government is seeking to deport Agee and Hosenball has been invoked on security grounds only once before -a 1974 case of a man accused of links with Marxist revolutionaries. The deportation order in that case was subsequently revoked.

The indictments result from al­

said. 

The station,citing unidentified

WOWO siad Shava owns control­

John R. Wilks, U.S. Attormey for northern Indiana, declined to con­firm the report. but scheduled a new conference for 9 a.m. Thurs­day. 
Flanagan, an Indianapolis Dem­crat. was defeated earlier this month in a try for the state Senate. 
WOWO, again citing unidenti­tied sources. reported that Flana­gan is alleged to have received $800 Chem-Tech stock while a member of a Blue Cross-Blue Shield committee that passed on payment requests. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Indiana is the contract agent for Medicare.

US tuna industry fights to continue purse-seining 
by Scott Thurber Pacmc News Service 
November IS ­
The American tuna industry is gearing up for an intense congres­sional battle in January. But porpoises -not tuna -will be on the center stage. 
Porpoises hit the news in early r;ovember when two federal courts in California suddenly halted mass­scale tuna fishing practices that accidentally killed up to 300,000 porpoi~es annually, ruling that the industry had already killed its quota of 78,000 porpoises in 1976. 
But the tuna industry's real problem is an earlier federal court ruling that as of January 1 will permanently ban the controversial tishing methods -known as "purse sellling" -unless the industry complies with a 1972 law designed 
to  save  porpoises  from  eventual  
extinction.  
That  law.  the  marine  mammal  

protection aet. mandated that the industry improve its technology so as to reduce the incidental porpoi­se "take" during tuna fishing to .. insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate." 
"We'll make every effort possi­ble this coming year to see that the law is changed." says Manuel Silva, president of the American Tunaboat Association (ATA), a San Diego-based group that repre­sents most of the more than 140 big boats involved in the controversy. 
Silva contends that strict adher­ence to the court order would be

"catastrophic" financially and pre­dicts that it would mean the end of the Southern California-based tuna fleet. 
The tuna industry will urge Congress to amend the 1972 act to allow porpoise kills at the ·'lowest possible level consistent with cur­rent technology." 
"Fishing on Porpoise" 

The court-halted fishing techni­que involved the use of sophisti­cated multi-million dollar "purse­seining" vessels to catch yellowfin tuna that follow schools of porpoi­ses and feed on their leftovers. 
Yellowfin tuna are caught mostly in the eastern pacific, off South America, and marketed here as "light meat tuna." The yellowfin comprise 60 percent of the annual United States catch caught by purse-seiners. 
The most common alternative to purse-seining is the "long-line" ­an extremely long fishing line to which a large number of baited subsidiarv lines are attached. 
This technique. used by the Japanese and by small. indepen­dent United States tuna fishermen who cannot afford expensive purse­seine vessels. does not harm the porpoise. But the giant tuna companies contend bait fishing is not as efficient as purse-seining. 
In testimony at recent legislative oversight hearings. a top Ford administration official conceded that several species of porpoise may now be threated with extinc­tion because of purse-seine tuna fishing.

'Same look' in Rose Bowl 
· New York AP-If the Big Ten and the Pacific-8 played this week's games i<t the first week of the season. it would save the Rose Bowl peopk a lot of aggravation. 
After all. the winners of the Ohio State-Michigan and the Southern California-UCLA gaines almost al­wa~·s decide the makeup of the big bowl game in Pasadena. Calif. So wouldn't it be nice if everything became crvstal ciear early? 
Everv vear. these two conferen­
ces predict loads of competition. 
and nearlv everv vear. the season 
turns into·a long.intruduetion to the final week. which then tells the whole storv. 
Since t9o8. either Michigan or Ohio State has gone west for New Year's Dav. And everv vear since 1965 -ex~Tpt for I97I ·and I 972 when Stanfrod crashed this exclu­sive party either UCLA or Southi.•rn California has commuted to Pasadena. 
But the two big conferences like to keep football interest untii the last whistle. so again college football gets to play its annual Rose Bowl Preps.

Hot Texas weather. according to all reports on conditions in the Lone Star state, will not be a problem. as the winter chills of November have been felt there even more than here. 
The course shouldn't pose a problem for Reinhart either. as it is supposedly "as flat as running on a table... a course very much to the taste of Reinhart.

Race in NFL still unpredictable 
by Bruce wwitt AP Sports Writer 

Time has just about run out for several former National Football League powerhouse teams-and it's rapidly running out ,m the Pitts­burgh Stcclers. too. 
The Stel'lers. two-time Super Bowl champions have come on like gangbustcrs Iatel~·. winning five straight games without permitting a touchdown in anv of them. 
But their bid to .tllakc it into the playoffs-and perhaps get a shot at an unprecedented third st• :~ight Super Bowl title-is. fading fast. 
With four weeks of regular-sea­son plav remaining. th'e playoff picture i~ still cloudy in both tht• American and National confcrcn ce~. 
In onlv two di,·ision~ is the situation clearly predictable. In the AFC West. Oakland. 9-1. is one victory away from clinching a tifth straight division title. And i:1 the NFC Central. Minne~ota. 8-: -I. is equally close to locking up ii s eighth cro\\"11 in the past nine ~Tar~. Beyond that. though. who knowo.;'! 
In the AFC. Baltimore looked like a sure winner in teh East on\ a week ago. Then the Colts. '1-2. were upset by second-place New England. 7-3. The Patriots tigue to stay right there. unless they're upset by the New York Jl't'i. And the Colts have an opportunity Monday night to tinish off Miami's chances. THe Dolphin!> are 5-5. 
Cincinnati. 8-2. still lead• Pitts­burgh and Cleveland. each 6-4. by two games in the AFC Central. Every game is a big one for the Bengals-but the biggest is Nov. 21'! when thev host the Steclers. who beat thet;l 2.1-o earlier. If the Steelers win again and the division ends with the two teams tied. the 
title goes tn Pittsburgh hy virtue of the two-game sweep. 
In the NFC West. Los Angeles. o-.1-1. b rlinging to a one-half game lead over San Francisco. o-4. The t\Hl teams play Sunda~· in San Francisco. If the Rar.1s can reverse th .'Tar's earlier outcome. when the 4~ers won lo-0. they'll open things up a bit. If the 49ers make it a t\\o-game sweep. though. the<lt he back on top h~ half a game.

ana said. "If it's true that I'm 
being avoided, I've accepted it. It 
makes you feel good to know that 
people have respect for you." 

He noted that a cornerback 
cover~ different players than a 
safety. "A strong safety usually 
covers the tight ends and in a zone 
defense. he covers the flat area. As 
a cornerback. you cover passes, but 
a strong scfcty covers the run 
more." Bradley explained. 

"But the main change for me has 
been my confidence." he contin­
ued. "Last year. I was still adjust­
ing tocnrnerback. This year. i have 
all the confidence I ne~d. I'm now

In track. he holds ~chool records in the I 00 (9. 7 seconds). 220 and 440-vard dashes. 
And when he arriv~d at Cartier Field fresh out of high school in August of 1973, he immediately became a starter in the Irish defensive secondarv. In one of his most outstanding games that sca­-.on against USC, he intercepted two pa~.ses. recovered a fumble and caused another. Bradlev calb it "the highlight of his career" so far.

The Irish went on to win the 
national championship, and Brad­
Icy intercepted six passes that 
season to lead the team as a 
freshman. 
Against Purdue last season, most fans can remember his 99­yard interception that prevented Purdue from threatening a Notre Dame victory. "We needed an interception to stop their drive," Bradley remembered. "I was for­tunate to stop it. It's also quite enjoyable to run 99 yards for a touchdown untouched." 
And Bradley was equally happy about last week's victory over Alabama in which he made a ~pcctacular one-handed intercep­tion over Crimson Tide wide receiv­er Ozzic Newsome. "I was very happy about the game," Bradley ...aid. "It was exciting from the '>pcctator's point of view, but on the field it was tense. No one knew who was going to win until the last '-JUartcr when Jimmy Browner made the interception." 
Success after success from sea­son to season has to make anyone wonder what is the cause behind Bradley's consistent pcrfomance. He immediately attributed his ~kills to defensive secondary coach Paul Shoults. "He knows every aspect of the game," Bradley told. 
"He's a very articulate person." Bradley continued. "I've been coached bv him for three years. and I've learned a lot. If we (defensive backs) react how he tells us to react. then we'll perform well every weekend." 
Yet Bradley wants to improve his tackling while at Notre Dame, hoping to tackle as well as most of the defensive players on his squad. 
Bradley, a finance major, would hopefully like to go to graduate wanted one of the Bradley children school to obtain an MBA degree. to attend their alma mater, South But he has hopes of playing Carolina State.

Reinhart awaits nationals 
b~ Gregory Solmlll' Sports Writer 
''I'm pretty pleased, bdh be­
cause this is the first time I've ever 
qualified for the nationals."said a 
chuckling Jim Reinhart," and be­
cause it was the best race of my 
life." 
And the captain had a right to be 
pleased, for he had just done what 
a captain is supposed to do. He 
had led by example as well as in 
~pirit. Jim Reinhart (Reino) had 
just qualified for the NCAA nation­
als to be held in Denton, Texas. 
November 22. 
There were others who were 
.:qually as happy about the situa­
tion. like Coach Joe Piane for 
instance. 
In qualifying for the NCAA's, 
Reinhart became the first runner to 
do so in two vear'i, the last runners 
to do it being Jim Hurt and Joe 
Ycats. both of them now gradu­
ated. The task was not an easy one 
at that, because, as Joe Piane 
pointed out, Reinhart is basically a 
half-mile :niler type of runner 
The four runners m the district 
who qualified ahead of Reinhart 
were all primarily distance run­
ners, with their expertise devel­
oped in such events as cross country 
and steeplechase. To place in the 
country meet took a lot of fore­
thought, and Jim Reinhart did just 
that. 
"I went out and Old just what I had planned to do," said Reinhart, commenting on theeighteenthplace finish that earned him a berth in the Nationals. "I had planned on hitting certain SVltS at certain times, and I hit those spots just right, passed the right people at the right time, and finished fairly strongly.·· 
Reinhart's time was 30.25 very good considering that the course is 
1.2 miles longer than the five mile course that Jim has been used to running. According to Coach Piane, this was again a definite advantage for those runners skilled and hewn for three to six mile courses, 
"You would think that it would hurt a half-miter more than it would a distance runner, so he responded quite well to the situation," Piane commented. 

Meanwhile, Reinhart's four te~mmates running in the race ran into various problems along the hills and dales, and neither of them were able to squeeze into the qualifying situation. One that was expected to, and perhaps would have had lady luck not frowned upon him, was Dennis Vander­Kraats. 
"Dennis could easily have quali­fied, but he just had one of those days," commented Reinhart, "He was in as good a shape as I was, but he just felt tight throughout the race and didn't run his besl." 
Other harriers for Notre Dame also had their porblems. The Freshmen didn't get as good a start as they would have liked. Dan Horgan lost his shoe in the first half-mile of the race and later developed a cramp, so it was up to "Reino" to represent Notre Dame at Texas, and he responded to tha< pressure. All that is left for Jim now is the biggest race of his life, and Reinhart will prepare for it with caution. 
"Until the race, I will be alterna­ting days of speed work and 
,.. 
distance work. There is not much you can do at this point to put you into better shape, so a runner just has to put in enough work so he can stay as he is." 
Even if Reinhart stays in shape. he is at a definite disadvantage because he has never run in a· race ofthis calibre before. The compiti­tion should be such that Reinhart will have to pull an extremely strong performance to win or place high in the meet. 
Not only will there be young and perhaps unheard of talent lining up to await the sounding of the gun, but last year's champion, Craig Virgin of Illinois will also compete. Reinhart, however, is confident that he can do well. 
"Because I haven't run in a national race before, I will try to run basicaly the smae race as I ran in the districts. I'll try to start out not too fast so I don't burn myself out, and run at a fairly fast pace throughout the race, and end with a pretty good kick. I'll simply try to run my own race and try not to over-react to the fact that I'm in a
