Iranian crisis deepens 

Council reacts to trial threat 

said it could be assumed "I -don't mean cooperation just ... in routine matters.'' 
The warning of an upcoming trial of the hostages as "spies" came from Iran's acting foreign minister, Sadegh Ghorbzadeh. 
Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had said previously that the hostages would be tried as spies if the United States does not return the exiled Shah Mohhammad Reza Pahlavi for trial. But Ghotbzadeh was quoted by Iranian state televi­sion yesterday as saying "the hostages will be tried for sure. '' 
Whether the hostages will be punished according to the ver­dict -they could be sentenced to death -would depend on Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who could overrule the sentence "if the United States extradites the shah," Ghotbzadeh reportedly said. 
The Iranian account of the interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro differed slightly from the version pub­lished by Le Figaro. In that, Ghotbzadeh says such halfway measures as an international investigation of ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reg~me would not settle the 
Cf!SlS. 
''Thus the hostages will be tried?" he was asked. 
"Yes." 
It was evident from the minister's remarks as reported by Iranian television, which closely follows the official line, that Ghotbzadeh meant the hostages would be tried in any event. 
Previously, Iran threatented

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -The month-old U.S. Embassy crisis turned grimmer yesterday as Iran's foreign minister declared the American hostages would be put on trial and their Moslem militant captors were reported to have threatened to execute them if they did not ''cooperate. '' 
At the emergency U.N. Se­curity Council session in New York, members finally agreed on an urgent resolution calling on Iran to release the 50 hostages and urging both the United States and Iran to ''exercise the utmost re­straint.'' 
Pentagon officials said, meanwhile, that a six-ship Navy force led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk has reached the Arabian Sea area, joining another U.S. carrier force. This put the ships, carrying more tha 135 planes, within reach of the entrance of the Persian Gulf. 
President Carter has warned Iran of "extremely grave" con­sequences if the hostages are harmed, and U.S. officials say a trial of the diplomats would be an even more grievous violation of international law than the hostage seizure itself. 
The report of threats to shoot hostages came from a White House official in Washington. 
The official, who asked not to be identified, said the hostages ''have been threatened with execution if they fail to cooper-· ate with their captors." He 

llirm fire raises doubts, questio,ns of safety 
by Mary Kay Ley don StaffReporter 
The response of Saint Mary's Security and students to a fire Friday evening in Holy Cross Hall has raised questions about the efficiency of the College's emergency procedures. 
The fire began at 5:15 p.m. on the fourth floor of the dorm, according to Susan Tamborini, the hall director. Kim Kearney the only resident of the room at the time. tried to extinguish the fire while other students report­ed the blaze to Chris Morris, who was on duty at the hall's front desk. 
Morris called Saint Mary's Security, while Joan McCarthy pulled the fire alarm, alerting the Notre Dame Fire Depart­ment. Security called the South Bend Fire Department at 5:21. 
The city responded with four emergency vehicks. Notre Dame sent one truck. The vehicles arrived at 5:35. 
Estelle Geyer, president of the hall and a resident of the room, said the fire started in a wicker waste paper basket, "probably as a result of a cigarer b~~t thrown into the trash can. 
A woman in the section complained that Security arriv­ed at Holy Cross "fifteen to twenty minutes after having been notified." They proceed­ed up the elevator to the fire, which Kearney had extinguish­ed. 
Security said in their report that their attempt to clear the dorm of the residents was 'Slow due to the lack of co-operation hy the students. 
Most students responded to the alarm in a "manner con­trary to safe fire procedure,'' a resident commented. ''A girl with a hearing problem was asleep, and no one hothered to check and make sure that she had gotten out,'' another stu­dent complained. 
According to the report made by security, "most · residents thought it (the alarm) was a joke and refused to leave the building." Some students even gathered around the open door and watched the fire be extin­guished, the report said. 
Security reported the cause of the fire to be a "lit cigar­ette.' ' Damage was minimal and required only scraping and painting. The report lists damages as scorching of the wall, ceiling and floor; smoke damage, and damage caused by powder from the fire extin­guisher used. 
Anthony Kovatch, director of security, had no comment.

Carlerannouncescandidacy 
WASHINGTON (AP) -President Carter, form­ally launching his fight for another term in the White House, said yesterday night the crisis with Iran that delayed his campaign plans ''may not be resolved easily or quickly.'' 
In a five-minute paid political broadcast on CBS television, Carter said the fate of 50 American hostages in Tehran could hang in the balance so long that "our patience and sense of uni~y may waver as frustration builds up among us. 
The broadcast followed a muted declaration of candidacy that Carter made yesterday afternoon in the East Room of the White House. 
Saying then that his stewardship of the nation's affairs has resulted in scars, which he carries ··with pride,'' Carter spoke of ''a somber time'' when hostages held by "a mob and a gover~~enr that have become one and the same. 
In the broadcast. Carter referred to his postponement of campaign plans and said, ''While the crisis continues, I must be present to define and to lead our response to an ever-changing situation of the greatest sensitivi­ty and importance." 
White House press secretary Jody Powell said the television appearance was keyed to 2,800 Carter fund-raisers. many held in private homes around the country. Had there not been this connection, he said, the broadcast would have been canceled. 
At the brief East Room ceremony eariier yesterday, Carter said he ''would have preferred to postpone this announcement until another time." But he said election laws in some states forced him to act now. 
"Therefore," he said, "I declare that I am a candidate for re-election as president ;)f the United States of America." 
Carter also asked fellow Democrats to renomi­nate Walter F. Mondale, "the most effective vice president in American history." 
The president, who spoke for less than ei~ht minutes in the East Room, appeared before relatives, staff aides and a delegation from campaign headquarters. Mondale was with him. The low-key event contrasted sharply with Carter's original plans. 
Before events in Iran intervened, the president had intended to invite prominent supporters from across the nation to the White House and to spend the evening at a fund-raising gala at a Washington hotel. Then he was going to em hark on four days ofcampaigning in six stares from Maine to Texas. 
Although the fund-raiser was on Caner's announced schedule for the day, chief spokes­man J ody Powell said the President would not anend because he "simply felt his presence there would not be appropriate under the circumstances." a reference to the· Iranian

and inventor of the geodesic dome, outlined his personal philosophies and impressions of the future last night in the Librat y Auditorium. The 84­year-old professor emphatically concluded his speech saying he placed faith in "today's youth, who are in love with love.'' 
Fuller described himself as an "average, healthy human being" who has "made an experiment of himself'' by attempting to do something "for all of humanity." Seated throughout the initial part of the program, he outlined histor­ically why the struggle for habitable areas has lead to the development of nations and corporations, who are primarily concerned oniy for themselves. 
''No one was doing anything for the total 'spaceship earth,' so I decided to try," Fuller explained. 
Drawing from scientifi._ his­tory and personal experiences, Fuller showed how he tried to decipher the riddle of human existence. "All other organ­isms have special equipment, but humans do not," he ex­plained. "Humans, however, do have minds," which he described as ''a capability to find relationships existing be­tween special cases.'' 
Fuller concluded that man's exisrance must be important, because ''the mind can com pre· hend to some extent the design of the universe, and nothing else can do this." 
Born in 1895, Fuller said, ''I found myself growing into a

Inflation, dissent 



Carter's black vote 
ATLANTA (AP)-] immy Carter's spectacular political star seemed suddenly dim that spring of 1976 as blacks· re­coiled from his use of the term ''ethnic purity'' in a statement on open housmg 
But when the aging bull of the movement-the Reverend Martin Luther King Sr.-em­braced Carter on a platform in downtown Atlanta, much of the shock and fury disappeared. Carter, elected with the help of the black vote, termed King's endorsement the turning point of his campaign. 
Carter still holds the bles­sings of the King family as he faces the 1980 election, but there is doubt the King endorsement will be enough to deliver the black vote again to the Deep South's first president since Reconstruction. 
Today there is dissension and frustratior. among black voters over issues unlikely to be quickly resolved or to fade far from memory: the resignation of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young, strained relations between blacks and Jews, the impact on blacks of inflation and unem­ployment. 
And there is the candidacy of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose family woo the affections of many blacks during the early days of the civil rights move­ment.

HEW announces plan to cu'rh college sports bias 
WASHINGTON (AP) .: The government formally announc­ed new guidelines for ending sex bias in college athletics, including a provision that sports scholarship money be distributed in proportion to the number of male and female athletes enrolled. 
The guidelines announced yesterday mean that unless schools find new sources of income, they may have to shift funds from expensive, all-male football programs to provide per capita scholarship aid to women athletes. 
For example, if 40 percent of a school's athletes are women, female athletes must receive 40 percent of the money a college allots for scholarships. 
The guidelines, which super­sede a tentative policy state­ment issued a year ago, immed­iately were attacked by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. But the assoc:a­tion's spokesman, Bill Kramer, said no decision had been made on what action to take. 
The government also will evaluate such specific factors as the provision of equipment. coaching assignments and the provi!:iJUil of locker rooms and other facilities to determine if an institution is discriminating against women athletes. 
"It is important to note that

guidelines.  

"We will, however, compare programs to determine whether policies and practices provide equilalent opportunities throughout men's and women's sports programs. 
Mrs. Harris said the guide­lines would ''give colleges  and universities maximum tlexibil­ity in developing and main­taif_ling their. at~ktic ero""ams 
while estabhshmg dear· tan­dards for insuring that their programs are free from sex discrimination.'' 
The NCAA's Kramer dis­agreed. 
"We think they ought to be doing an assessment of the total athletic program instead of applying an arbitrary financial standard," he said. 
The scholarship provision is the one the NCAA strongly opposes, Kramer said. He described it as a ''financial quota.'' . 
"We're opposed to it," he said. "Exactly what we'll do, I don't know." 
The guidelines are an inter­pretation requested by colleges and universities of Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, which bars sex discrimination in fed­erally assisted programs. Fed­eral money generally does-not go to college athletic programs. But the government takes the view that any institution receiv­

Carter 50 percent to 3 5 percent among black voters in Georgia, the president's home state. With all voters included in the 57-townsampling of 500 voters, the poll indicated Carter would still carry his home state in Georgia's March 11 Primary. Those percentages were 60 percent for Carter and 27 percent for Kennedy. 
But much would be made over the symbolism if Carter could not hold the black vote at home. 
"Ifthere is dissention among the black voters at home, that's going to multiply across the nation,'' said Georgia state Rep. Hosea Williams, former executive director of the Sou­thern Christian Leadership Conference,. 
''Part of the problem of the president may be that he estab­lished expectations which the administration simply cannot fulfill whether it wanted to or ' not," said Suitts.

Song gets mixed reviews 
by Mary Fran Callahan StaffReporter 
In an effort to reduce the mounting tension of the Iranian situation, four Notre Dame students wrote and recorded a song entitled ''Iranian in My Heart'' which is now generat­ing mixed reactions. 
Pat Byrnes, a junior who authored the lyrics, said yes­terday that students and WSND personnel have been comment­ing favorably on his song. 
WSND has been playing the song since the beginning of this week. However, AM News Director Kathy Murray was unaware of the song. After listening w the recording yes­terday, she commented, "I think it's frightful that students at Notre Dame are so revenge­
ful  and  speaking  in  such  re­ 
vengeful terms.''  
Excerpts from  the  song  in­ 
clude:  

Cancer's enough to krll a man But not ifhe is from Iran. So let them barmers burn They won't send us no more 
oil ... 
They call us the ''Satan'' nou 
I think we could vapon'ze Tehran and them theocrats 'Cause we could blow them into the sky Nuke them suckers so damned hi h TCey 'd need a reserved ticket to come down. We could stop their burnin ' the flag Stuff their ashes in a Hefty bag ... 
After hearing the first verse of the recording, a WSND disc jockey, playing the tape yester­day, called the song "in poor taste.'' 
Byrnes completed the lyrics a week before Thanksgiving and 
said he thought it was humor­ous and would be all the more humorous if set to music. 
He then approached three of his friends and eventually re­corded ''Iranian'' with juniors Kevin McCarthy on lead guitar, Greg Butler and Jim Lanz on yocals and Byrnes on harmon­tea. 
Murray said although Ameri­cans' natural reaction is anger, a forgiving Christian attitude 
But  jimmy  ought  to  shou  toward  Iran  is  more  appro­ 
them how  priate.  
They can all go to Hell ...  Referring  to  the  tone  of the  

HPC discusses College Bowl, alcohol surveys, visitations 
byjana Schutt 

The Hall President's Council (HPC) held its final meeting of the semester last evening to tie up loose ends before Christmas break. Discussions included the College Bowl, alcohol sur­veys, and high school visitation. 
Ed Bylina, representative of the students in charge of the College Bowl, explained that the interhall games began last Sunday. The $100 allotted to the group was used to purchase the packets of questions neces­sary for competition. 
A roll call of the dorms solicited $120 more in funding for the Bowl. These were all donations given as a service by the dorms. 
Bylina said that this is the second year that we have been conducting the College Bowl. We are trying to make it an activity taken care of through Student Activities in the near future, which wouJd alleviate the need for additional funds. 
The alcohol surveys con­ducted by Psychological Ser­vices through hall councils were returned with over 50 percent participation. 
An announcement was made 
that any membersof the Notre Dame Undergraduate Schools Committee interesLed in visit­ing high schools in their area over Christmas break should contact Don Bishop in the Admissions Office between Dec. 10 and 20. Any questions may be directed to Terri Ware­ham (7883) or Tom Kozloski (6981). 
Kate McGuire sent a thank­you message to the Council for the participation in the clothing drive sponsored by the Volun­teer Services office for Vietna­mese families in South Bend.

Byrnes said the purpose of the song was not to arouse political activism. He said he found the entire Iranian situation "ab­surd" and began researching 
it. 

"The more I looked into it, the sillier the whole thing looked," Byrnes explained. He said he thought his lyric was topical and "funny." 
''I thought we could have fun with it. Ifanything--it's a break in the tension," he said. 
According to Byrne, WSND called to compliment him on his efforts over the weekend and students have also been react­ing positively to the song. 
WSND-AM Program Director Mike Tanner was unavailble for comment.

Flesh and Spirit 
Elizabeth Christman 


William Morrow and Co., Inc. 
1979 

''She wondered as she had a hundred times, whether it was plea­sing to God or displeasing, this urge she had to give up her own comfort, desires, vocation, her own sefness, even, to lessen another person's suffering." · 
This thought passes through the mind of Sister Brigid, and illustrates r he central tension of the novel Flesh and Spirit The nun's problem IS how to grve herself in a way that is pleasing to God. Sister Brigid works rn the campus ministry office of a university. She is an idealist and 
wants to live a life that is Christ-like 
in all respects. Father Porter Woods 
is her co-worker and tries to get 
Brigid to realize that one need not be 
completely self-sacrificing in order to 
please God. He insists that God 
wants his people to enjoy the gifts 
that he has bestowed upon them. 
''God gave you your attractive looks. 
It's and insult to him not to use 
them.'' 

Sister Brigid' s conflict between 
desires of the flesh and of the spirit 
climax in her relationship with Larry 
Dineen. This aspect of her life is a 
highly moving and compassionate 
story of love. Sister BrigiJ must 
discern whether she would be more 
beneficial to the world by loving one 
individual completely or by loving all 
humanity freely. Brigid must iden­
tify the line that exists between 
choosing to suffer unnecessarily and 
simply following Christ. 

Sister Brigid' s problem is one that all devout Christians must face and resolve in their lives. Brigid wants to give up her life, but to do it in the way that God wants her to. The key is to discover how much God expects and wants. 
"We are all in this state of uncertainty. I do not think Sister Brigid's problems are any more a nun's problems than .they are any Christian's problems," says Miss Elizabeth Christman, author of Flesh and Spirit. 
A Nice Italian Girl, Christman's first novel, was published in 1976 by Dodd Mead. It is the story of a young Catholic girl who after finding herself pregnant and abandoned by her lover, -falls victim to adoption racketeers. The story was trans­formed into an ABC television adap­tion entitled "Black Market Baby" which was aired October 7, 1977. In addition to her two novels, Christman has also publish~d many articles and 
short stories for a wide variety of 
publications which include: ''The 
Reporter", "The Sign", "The Cath­
olic World", and "The Saturday 
Evening Post". 
Flesh and Spirit is Christman's 
second novel. It was published this 
year by William Morrow and Com­
pany. It will soon appear as an Avon 
paperback, and this fall it will come 
out in a Reader's Digest book 
volume. The story will probably 
never be a movie because the 
tensions of the novel exist within the 
mind of the young nun-she is the 
victim of interior conflicts which are 
very difficult to capture in a film. 
Elizabeth Christman, the oldest of 
seven children, grew up in Webster 
Groves, Mis~ourri--a suburb of St. 
Louis. In 1935 she graduated from 
Webster College--a Catholic 
women's college--with a degree in 
English. For a period of almost ten 
years, Christman tried her hand at 
writing, and served in various tem­
porary jobs. She remained at the last 
of these temporary jobs for twenty­
three years. The job was with Harold 
Ober Associates, one of the oldest 
and most respected literary agencies 
in Manhattan. 

Christman progressed through 
many jobs at the Ober agency. She 
began as a secretary, then served as 
a reader, then finally as a literary 
agent. She dealt with major pub­
lishers, magazine editors, and movie 
producers--the literary circle is truly 
a glamorous world. Christman 
personally handled the work of J.D. 
Salin~er (her copy of Catcher in the 
Rye IS a first edition signed by the author), Pearl S. Buck, William Faulkner, and Agatha Christie. In addition to the glamour of her profession, Christman loved working with new, talented, young writers. This aspect of her job sparked her to desire to become a college professor.

Every Tun.day, deep within the 
gloomy catacombs, thf' Dungeon 
Master casts his spell of magic. 
Every Tuesday night his disciples 
answer the call, drawn from their 
lighted rooms down into LaFortune 
basement. And every Tuesday night 
a common force compels them to play 
Dungeon" and Dragons. 
It's a game, not like Monopoly or 
Ri-;k-those are for kids. D and D is 
on a level of complf'xity with serious 
chess, or more accurately, the legion 
of simulated board games that are 
grnwing 111 popularity every day. 
It's a fantasy. Each player 
assume·.-. a persona, the Dungeon 
Mastn-;r ~llj)('l ior player-creates the 
scenarios in which the personas live 
and all. Bur the action is all in the 
mrnd. lc-!1 111 the player's imagi­
narlon . 
.Joe \Vhcatnn is Dungeon Master for the wc('klv game in LaFortune. He design-. a world that exists from 7 to I0 evnr Tucsda~· and peoples it with everything from Ogres to Heroes, 300 entities in all. The settings of the game range from Deserts ro Raintoresrs, and the rules are drawn from the pages of rhe three official D and D handbooks. 
Ioe explains D and D as ''A role playing fantasy based in rrealitv. The roles are quantified by throwing dice. Each quantification determines a trait for the persona a player rakes on. These traits run through a full spectrum depending solely on the outcome of the die."' They also decide whether you meet a dragon or a pnncess. 
The player puts himself in Joe's world and Joe favors his trust by 

Sal Granata 

providing the story plot. ''The Dungeon Master has to stay a few steps ahead of the players and the plot ~~n get .pretty complex at umes. 
The game will go on till the end of the school year. Dand D came to Notre Dame about 
five years ago. Back then, Pete Ryder ran a game with two other students. Today there are at least 50 D and D garners on campus. This particular group got started after Joe advertised for Dand D players in the Observer. Garners Anonymous, an information service, registered 29 
man began working towards ad­
vanced degrees at New York Univer­
sity night school. She obtained both 
her Masters and Doctorate degrees 
from this University. Christman 
began her teaching career in 1968 at 
St. Peter's College in Jersey City, 
then left the New York area for 
Indiana, where she has remained 
ever since. After teaching at DePauw 
University for seven years, Elizabeth 
Christman joined the faculty of Notre 
Dame. 

Christman teaches four classes for the American Studies Department: Book Publishing, Writing for Publi­cation, Fiction Writing, and Modern American Fiction. Students at Notre Dame love Miss Christman--her classes are among the most sought after in the American Studies Depart­ment. Jana Schun, one of Christ­man's B-ook Publishing students com­mented, "I think she is the most personable teacher I have had here at Notre Dame. She is always willing to help in whatever way she can." 
Christman is constantly urging her students to write lean prost>, to be specific, use derails, and to employ concrete examples. She is espeCJally conscious of her valuable advice while sitting at her own typewriter. "Teaching writing has helped me to improve my own writing." 
Miss Christman has led a full life and her students can not escape benefitting by the vast experiences of her history that she brings with her into the classroom. As a student of Miss Christman's Writing for Publi­cation class, I can attest to the fact that she is not only a fine reacher, but a warm person who truly cares about her students. After reading Flesh and Spirit, I can also say that Miss Elizabeth Christman is an excellent writer. The book is lively, memor­able, and remarkable--just like the author.

Ken Peckowski, '71, of Griffon 
Rook Store in South Bend report" "a 
dramatic rise in sales of Dungeons 
and Dragons ser... over the past 
twelve months. We started carrying 
it when we opened in 1<)7), now we 
are easily selling a game a day." 
The Griffon is a local Headquarter-. 
for the board game crowd. The store 
deals in all types of D and D resource 
material, die and supplementary 
rules, as well as Avalon Hill and 
Simulations Publications war games. 
"We have games running in our 
back room every Wednesday, Thurs­
day, and Friday night as well as on 
Saturdays,'' Peckowski said. The 
games average about 15 player::;. 
The players represent a fairly 
broad cross-section. Ages vary from 
High School Club to a lor of college 
and posr-collegt· people to a rare one 
over thirty. Women are the rarest of 
all Terry Linehan plays D and D on 

Tuesday nights. She is one of the few 
women who takes her game 
seriously. "It's an escape, a way to 
play someone else without thinking 
too hard about it." 

She thinks D and D isn't as popular with women as with men because "you have to be indoctrinated. A lor of people come over to D and D from other board games and guys are ,. usr more prone to play those rhan gir s.'' 
Mat Finnegan was introduced to D and D while at High School, he's been playing ever since. He has also been a Dungeon Master. "Dungeons and Dragons is a lot of fun. It's like any other game, you play it because you enjoy H." 
It's a weird sight-to walk into LaFortune and see a bunch of young adults, huddled over notepads and dice, popcorn, cokes, and peanuts, reading off chance encounters with necromancers and firebrearhing lizards. But, if you could read their minds, what a tale their thoughts could tell.

for "art" in the seventies.

S:S a whole-_-were merely the reflec­tion ofa society grown neurotic in the approach of that most ominous of years, 1984. But that won't be easily proved.

modern technologists beginning at vt>ar zero. If that is the case, we are headed for another introspective per­iod in a few short years, and the seventies can be dismissed as "gl:t­ting it all out of our system." 
Fat chance. But at least it is something to think about.

Sociology Club offers Mini-Urban Plunge 
by Mary Leavitt 
' 

The Sociology Club will spon­sor a Mini-Urban Plunge pro­gram this week in cooperation with the Justice of Peace Cen­ter in South Bend, according to ] oan Driscoll, co-chairman of the organizational committee for the plunge. "We want students to become aware of the social services offered in the community,'' Driscoll said. 
The plunge is open to all Saint Mary's students and will take place today, tomorrow and Saturday afternoons from 1 to 5 
p.m. Students may sign up to attend on any of the giVen afternoons. They will be given a tour of various social service centers in South Bend, such as the Urban Renewal office and an alternative school system. 
The cost for the tour is $1. 
Driscoll explained that the idea for the mini-urban plunge originated with Mary Kay Cohan, a member of the So­ciology Club and co-chairman of the organizational committee. The program was given a test run at the beginning of the year with only members of the Sociology Club being allowed to participate. The mini-plunge proved to be successful and consequently, is now open to all students. 
Lucy McVay, a member of the organizational committee, thinks the plunge will be a valuable experience for stu­dents. 
"I think everyone participat­ing will see a different side of South Bend," she said .

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) ­Earle Bruce is delighted that Ohio State is where it is today ­ranked No. 1 by the Associated Press and headed for the Rose Bowl -but says cautiously that he'II wait for that showdown with Southern California before celebrating.

''But you know we still have a big game in the Rose against USC. I don't put stock in it until the final poll." 

Doug Donley, the Buckeyes' crack junior receiver, said the latest vote should provide extra incentive in the Rose Bowl against the third-ranked Trojans. "It's going to lift the team up. It's a great feeling. I'm pretty excited. Everybody wasn't expecting much out of

The final poll decidins. the national championship will be taken after the bowl games on New Year's Day. ' 
Ohio State was unranked in the preseason poll and did not reach the Top Ten until after its fourth victory. The 48-year-old Bruce seemed almost dismayed by the vote that lifted the Buckeyes from third to first even though No. 2 Alabama,

The news failed to ruffle 
Alabama Coach Bear Bryant, 
but Crimson Tide faithful 
showed their wrath by tele­
phoning AP bureaus in 
Alabama and the AP sports 
desk in New York, where the 
poll is tabulated. 
In Selma, Ala., Bryant said, 
"No, I'm not upset. It's not 
going to change our game plan 
for the Sugar Bowl.'' 
Hollis Behel, a retired die 
setter from Florence, Ala., 
said, ''Alabama has the longest 
winning streak in the country 
and the bt:st defensive record in 
the country. I don't know what 
the voters' reasoning was. I 
just don't agree with them." 
A nationwide panel of 67 
sports writers and broadcasters 
accorded Ohio State 1,267 
points, Alabama 1,265 112 and 
Southern Cal 1, 257. Ironically, 
both the Tide and Trojans had 
more first-place votes, 29 and 
19, than the Buckeyes' 16. 
Ohio State and Alabama each 
are 11-0 while Southern Cal is 
10-0-l. 

It was the second-place ballots that proved the differ­ence. Ohio State's Big Ten champions were mentioned by 33 voters for second place. But eight voters left Alabama out of the top three. Only three ballots listed Ohio State lower than No. 3. 
Alabama will play sixth­ranked Arkan<;as in the Sugar Bowl. Fourth· .tnked Flonda State and No. 5 Oklahoma will meet in the Orange Bowl while No. 7 Nebraska tangles with No. 8 Houston in the Cotton Bowl.

Defense helps Irish defeat Belles 
by Kelly Sullivan Sports Wn'ter 
lnrense defensive play and consistent ball shooring by Notre Dame helped the Irish' women's basketball ream hand­ily defeat Saint Mary's 81-45 last night at Angela Athletic Facilitv. It was Notre Dame's third ~in in as many tries. 
The Belles grabbed the early le<Jd in the game only to have the Irish knot it up at 10-10. 
Jane Politiski's jump shot gave the Irish a 12-10 lead that they never relinquished. Midway through the first half, Notre Dame outscored their oppo­nents 18-5 and built a 36-17 halftime lead that was never challenged by the Belles. 

Shari Matvey, a freshman from Youngstown, Ohio, led all scorers with a 22 point effort for the Irish. Freshman Anne Armstrong paced the Belles with 13 points. 
Notre Dame's superior height was an obvious factor in the game. The Irish outrebounded the Belles 41-3 3. Sharon Petro, Irish head c·oach, also felt that turnovers would play a decisive role. "We've had problems with turnovers, but we kept them down tonight. We were com.erned about their full court pressure but we handled it very well." 
Petro was pleased with the play of freshmen, Matvey and Jan Crowe, who scored 10 points for the Irish. Other

Students resurrect ski club 
Happiness is a blizzard leaving a four-foot blanket of sRow ... if you're a member of the Ski Club. The new Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Ski Club (not to be confused with the ski team) has been defunct for several years, but a group of students are trying to miriate a resurrectiOn. 
The Ski Club will offer group transportation to nearby ski resorts with group discount rates in lift ticket, rental equip­ment, and group lessons. Future plans include weekend trips to different resorts, but the early emphasis will be on day-long trips. 
The first meeting of the 1979-80 Ski Club will be this Thursday, Dec. 6, at 7 p.m. in the little theatre in LaFortune Student Center. All interested students are encouraged to attend. Limited seatmg on future trips is available on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

Memberships fees of $5 will

Notre Dame players finishing in double figures were Maggie Lally with 15 points, and Polit­iski and Mollv Cashman with 10 points each. ' 
' 'I set two goals for each game," explained Petro. "The first one is to win. The second is to play everyone. Tonight, we did both." 
Saint Mary's coach Jerry Dal­lessio felt that Notre Dame's defense was responsible for the Belles' loss. ''Normally we shoot much better. But shoor­ing is dicrated by the defense, 
and  their  defense  did  a  real  
good job."  
"They  didn't  do  anything  I  

didn't expect. They are well coached. We played much better than the score indicated. I'm pleased with our team's effort -everyone gave 100 percent. But when you're playing against that kind of height,. you have to shoot the ball well. They were hot and we were cold," explained the sec­ond year mentor . 
Notre Dame's next opponent is Michigan. The game is scheduled for 2:00PM Saturday in the ACC. Saine Mary's plays Franklin College in the Goshen Roundball Classic Friday at 8:00PM.

AP writers se_lect All-America squad 
(AP) -Charles White of Southern California, who led the nation in rushing and all-purpose rushing en route to becoming the second leading ground-gainer in college foot­ball history, was named to the: Associated Press All-America team for the second year in a row Tuesday along with six other repeaters from 1978.

Roadsplits satisfy ailing Irish 
Splits ... 

Bowlers hate them, cheerleaders avoid them bur I'II eat a hundred "f them--heavy on the bananas. please. 
See, it all depends on who you talk to and what kind of split you're talking about. Hockey players, for instance. Now they're not supposed w say this, but a split on the road (that's winning one and losing one) makes everyone 
happy. . h . . . . w· .
Espeually w en you re VISiting 1sconsm. · Now, I must admit, I've never had the pleasure (?) of seeing downtown Madison, but I understand the climate is none too friendly for invading WCHA teams. Take Notre Dame, for instance. They've played in the Badgers' Dane Counry Coliseum 24 times and have a 4-20 record to show for their efforts. 
Bllt last Saturday, when they needed a win after lo'>tng, 5-2, to the Badgers the night before. Last Saturday when the Irish roster read like· a shooting script for The Ben Casey Show wah center Dave Poulin, and wingers Kevin Humphreys and Dan Collard (to name but a few) ,jddinul wirh injuries. Last Saturday the Notre Dame hockey team put it all together and beat Wisconsin 4-3 at Wisconsin to 'split' the series. 
The almightly split. .. Sweep at horne, split on the road--that's what every college hockey team pravs for (hut they won't admit that either). 
The funny thing though. about this hockey rc-arn I'> that they win more on the road than they do at home. The punch line? They're 5-l on the road and 3-4 at home. Why isn't Lefty laughing? 
Will1he man who coined the rerm "home ice

advantage'' please stand up? I thought so ... he's afra1d someone's gonna throw a puck at him. 
There just isn't any home ice advantage for this team," states Greg Meridith who serves as captain for this year's squad. "It seems that on the road we come together as a team. We take a lot of abuse from hostile crowds and that makes everyone pull together." 
But at home, Greg? What about home sweet home? 
"I don't know for sure but I think a lot of guys get nervous before a home game," .he conjec­tures. "Everyone wants to do well m front of friends and family and that causes tension." 
And tension causes mistakes. Mistakes this hockey team isn't supposed to be making. But Meridith claims the situation is actually brighter that their fifth place standing in the WCHA leads one to believe. 
"I know it sounds like an excuse," Meridith smiles slyly, " bur we have been hampered very seriously by injuries co key people. You just don· t lose a player 'like Dave Poulin (last season· s leading scorer) and not get hurt by it.
