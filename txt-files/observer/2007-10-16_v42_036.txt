Group increases election awareness 
NDVotes '08, a new nonpartisan campus campaign, plans to encourage student voter registration 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
With the first presidential primaries only three months away, campus groups have begun to address rates of stu­dent voter registration. Newly formed campus initiative NDVotes'08, a nonpartisan educational campaign spon­sored by the Center for Social Concerns, is spearheading the efforts. 
Senior Mike McKenna, CSC coordinator and NDVotes'08 member, described the coali­tion as "a localized extension" of the Rock the Vote Campaign, a national nonprof­it organization developed to increase political advocacy, especially among young vot­ers. 
The coalition "developed as a task force this fall to give [the voting initiative] more ownership campus-wide," he said. 
NDVotes'08 consists of vari­ous political groups on cam­pus, including College Democrats, College Republicans, ND Right to Life, NAACP and other groups, McKenna said. 
While NDVotes'08 is not affiliated with the national Rock the Vote organization, it shares similar objectives. 
"Our goals are streamlined with Rock the Vote," McKenna said. "We stress education, registration and awareness." 
Political groups on campus have recently jumped onboard with NDVotes'08, but their roles and duties have not yet been specified, said Spencer Howard, co-president of College Democrats. 
The president of College Republicans, Sarah Way, sees the affiliation for NDVotes'08 as an extended effort to regis­ter as many students as possi­ble. 
"This is really a bipartisan effort to get people to care 
enough to vote," she said. "Every vote does count. We, as young Americans, need to start showing concern about our future." 
NDVotes'08 will name dorm commissioners shortly after fall break to maximize the spread of their goals, McKenna said. 
One of the key elements of NDVotes'08 is the voter con­tact card, which will enable the group to compile informa­tion of registered students as well as notify them about voter deadlines, absentee ballot information and local elec­

that's key." 
While the change was institut­ed in the spring of 2006, word of the late-night midterms hours is still spreading. 
Senior Kaitlin Ramsey said she hadn't known the library was open 24 hours a day during midterms week. Although Ramsey said she is a "night per­son," she was doubtful she would use the library after 2 a.m. 
Parker Ladwig, interim head of Library User Services, said the library has been open 24 hours during midterms for the past three semesters. During that period, he said library atten­dance averaged 120 users at 3 
a.m. 
and around 50 users at 5 

a.m. 
By comparison, library attendance during finals week averaged around 160 users at 3

Mendoza recognized for ethics 
MBA program ranks 5th for stewardship 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The MBA program at Mendoza College of Business ranks fifth in a biennial international study of stewardship in graduate business schools, according to results announced Oct. 10. 
The Aspen Institute, an inter­national, non-profit organization that seeks to promote "enlight­ened leadership and open-mind­ed dialogue," conducted the study. 
The study ranked business schools not only on the starting salaries of its students and other typical ranking criteria, but also according to the courses taught and research interests of faculty. 
Notre Dame's Catholic charac­ter plays a role in the high rank­ing of the Mendoza MBA pro­gram, said Mary Hamann, direc­tor of communications for Mendoza. 
"There's certainly an acknowl­edgement of the need to look deeply at the impact business decisions have in the world," she said. "At a faith-based institution, we are very comfortable explor­ing these issues." 
In addition to requiring courses that help teach students how to conduct business in a way that promotes social responsibility, Mendoza fosters research that furthers the goals of stewardship throughout the business educa­tion community, she said.

Irish official says integration an issue 
ByJENN METZ Assistant News Editor 
John llaskins, the senior Irish government official responsible for immigration policy, opened Monday's panel on the ellects of a changing population in Ireland by quoting Irish author George Bernard Shaw. 
"'We are made wise not by the recollection of our past but by the responsibility of our future,"' I Iaskins said at the panel, which took place in the McKenna Hall auditorium. 
More than 100 years after the height of immigration to America through Ellis Island, some of the problems of integration remain the 
same in the new Ireland, Haskins said. "These are new lives, but thi<; is a historic issue," he said. 
Most of today's immigrants to Ireland originate from Eastern European countries such as Poland and Lithuania, Haskins said. There are also large numbers from China and Africa. 
The overall population of Ireland increased by 10 percent since 2002, as reported by the 2006 cen­sus, Haskins said. The population of non-nationals increased by 90 percent and now includes one in 10 residents, an estimate Haskins called conservative. 
Between 1945 and 1973, Europe underwent a guest worker phase,

To help students prepare for midterms, Hesburgh Library opened Sunday morning and will not close until Friday night. Though late-night usage so far has not been significant, a library security guard said that could change as people grow aware of the extended hours. 
Security monitor Terry Harper said after-hours library use would peak at "a couple hun­dred" people, particularly early today and Wednesday morning. However, his records indicated that there were only 40 people on Monday morning at 3 a.m. and 23 at 5 a.m.

Stress levels are ridiculously high, and no matter who you talk to, they're more than ready to go home or wher­ever they're going. Students are just hoping they manage to finish that last paper and pass that crazy midterm test so that they can finally try and relax a little. Until then. however. we all have some exciting stuff to look for­ward to. 
Few people escape midterm we11k without pulling at least one all-nightnr, and to eombinll slenp deprivation with crazy stress hwnls is just cruel. It's almost impossible to avoid staring at a computer snenn from 6 p.m. until 4 or 5 a.m. while desperately trying to come up with the next sentnnCf) for a paper that is still two pages short of the requirement. Nothing is worse than a 5 a.m. writer's block or finding out at 2 a.m. the night befor() the test that your dass notns read like a first­grader wrote them. 
All this stress just makns evnryone irritable and downright grumpy. People arn snapping and griping at each other for no appar()nt reason. 
Tm1sions are so high that huge scroaming matches can result out of ridiculously petty disagreements­especially between girls. The high stress levels amplify girls' natural cat­tinoss and make guys more likely to snap at other people. 
And if it isn't bad enough that every­one is stressed out and grumpy, they're all getting sick. Colds and fevers are in abundance everywhere. It's impossible to go into a class where at least half the room is snil'lling, sneezing, cough­ing or shaking from fever. 
or course all this sickness is incredi­bly distracting, not to mention kind of gross, especially if you're the one who's snil'lling, sneezing, coughing and/or shaking from fever. 
It's terrible, you're feeling stressed out and irritable, then you can't breathe and all you want to do is go to sleep and wake up on Saturday morn­ing for the USC game. All that anyone wants to do is fly through this week and conw out on the other end rela­tively unscathed. 
To sum it all up, it sucks. It never ceases to amaze me how much work professors can cram into one week. Papers. tests, quizzes -you name it, they add it to the wBek. It's insanity and it's the worst part of going away to collnge. You get to become incredibly stressed, be crabby, pull all-nighters, get siek, and try to pull ofT papers and big tnsts all in one week. Definitely something to look forward to, right'!

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Task forces address campus changes 
Energy Week, Honor Code, taxi regulations among discussion topics 
ByJENN METZ Assistant News Editor 
Task force reports at Monday's meeting of the Campus Life Council addressed the campus energy summit, treatment of honor codes at peer universities, guidelines for community relations and the rules limit­ing the waiting time of cabs at Main Circle. 
Lauren Sharkey, Hall Presidents Council co-chair, congratulated Student Body Chief Executive Assistant Sheena Plamoottil on the suc­cess of the Oct. 3 energy summit. 
Plamoottil, who was not present at this week's meet­ing, is the chair of the Task Force on Campus Environment. Student body presidrmt Liz Brown present­ed a brief report in her place. 
The Task Force on Campus Environment will assess the effectiveness of the energy summit, the first of three planned summits to take plaee this year, Brown said.

SAND calendar to coordinate service 
By KRISTEN EDELEN 
News Writer 
With the launch of an online calendar that charts upcoming service events, the many social service groups at Notre Dame have a new resource for collaborating their event planning and gen­eral dialogue. 
This resource, which is now up and running, was created by the newly formed Social Action Notre Dame (SAND) network and can be found on the bottom right corner of the Center for Social Concerns' home page. The calendar shows events through mid­November. 
Gary Nijak and Chris Esber, both juniors, founded the group. 
"The main purpose of this group is to start conversation between all the different organizations that focus on social action and social serv­ice to avoid groups planning events at the same time, and to allow groups to work together on issues," Nijak said. 
Service groups can submit their events to an online cal­endar for the public to view, said Esber, who works in the CSC office. The sharing of information will help organi­zations plan so that service events can be scheduled at times that do not conflict with other events, he said. 
Esber will maintain the cal­endar with the help of juniors Katie Day and Maggie Condit. 
"We seek to bring together groups which previously had no formal conversation," Nijack said. "We can then stimulate conversation and promote efficient and produc­tive events on campus." 
One such collaborative event occurred Sunday, when groups from Notre Dame came together with the Michiana community to sup­port those affected by conflict in Uganda through the Gulu Walk. 
"The Walk is only one example, but it is a good dis­play of what SAND can do," Esber said. 
The idea behind SAND resulted both from Nijak's participation in a national summer leadership program and an idea of Rosie McDowell, the student out­reach coordinator for the CSC. McDowell sought to cre­ate an efficient scheduling network for the many events that occur on and off campus. 
Nijak said many other cam­puses already had systems similar to SAND.

"There's a conference that we do each year asking some ques­tions from an ethical perspective that mainstream business researchers should explore," Hamann said. 
Stanford University was the highest-ranked program, fol­lowed by the University of Michigan, York University in Canada, the University of California-Berkley and Notre Dame. Columbia University, Cornell University, Duquesne University, Yale University and the Instituto de Empresa in Spain rounded out the top 10 schools in the ranking. 
The Institute lauded Stanford's courses with an environmental focus. 
The study seeks to discover how the "issues of social impact and social responsibility are men­tioned throughout ilie curriculum, as opposed to being limited to a few select courses," Hamann said. 
The Aspen Institute alc;;o ranked the Notre Dame MBA program fifth in its previous stewardship ranking, released in 2005. 
The rankings are based on "how well prepared [graduates] are to guide a company through the complex relationship of busi­ness and society, where issues relating to the environment or the well-being of a community can inlpact a company's performance and reputation," the Institute said in a statement. 
Although the Aspen Institute does not expect stewardship con­cerns to replace those of post­graduation financial success, it does express a desire for a bal­ance between the two. 
"While graduate business schools are finding the ability to deal wiili such issues an increas­ingly important part of the train­ing for successful business lead­ers, there is still room for innova­tion and inlprovement," the state­ment said.

Medtronic difibrillator wires faulty 
MINNEAPOLIS -Medtronic Inc. is stopping distribution of wires that connect some of its delibrillators to patients' hearts after learning they may have contributed to five deaths. 
Medtronic shares dropped more than 12 per­cent by midday Monday after the disclosure. 
A defibrillator monitors a patient's heart­beat; if it senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electronic shock to reset the heart to a normal beat. A delibrillation system con­sists of a device implanted near the shoulder with one or more leads connecting the device to the heart. 
Medtronic said it discovered a "small chance of fractures in particular locations" on Sprint Fidelis models 6930, 6931, 6948 and 6949. The company is asking doctors to stop implant­ing the leads and return unused leads to Medtronic.

New dinosaur species uncovered 
Skeleton of monstrous vegetarian that roamed earth 88 million years ago discovered 
Associated Press 
RIO DE JANEIHO -The skeleton of what is believed to be a new dinosaur species-a 105-foot plant­eater that is among the largest dinosaurs ever found -has been uncov­ered in Argentina, scien­tists said Monday. 
Scientists from Argentina and Brazil said the Patagonian dinosaur appears to represent a pre­viously unknown species of Titanosaur because of the unique structure of its neck. They named it Futalognkosaurus dukei after the Mapuche Indian words for "giant" and "chief," and for Duke Energy Argentina, which helped fund the skeleton's excavation. 
"This is one of the biggest in the world and one of the most complete of these giants that exist," said Jorge Calvo, director of the paleontology center at the National University of Comahue, Argentina. He was lead author of a study on the dinosaur published in the peer-reviewed Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.

IN BRIEF Social Security to be put to the test 
WASIIINGTON -The baby boomers' stam­pede for Social Security benefits has begun. 
The nation's "first" baby boomer, a retired teacher from New Jersey, applied for Social Security benefits Monday, signaling the start of an expected avalanche of applications from the post World War II generation. 
Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue called it "America's silver tsunami." 
Kathleen Casey-Kirschling applied for ben­efits over the Internet at an event hosted by Astrue. Casey-Kirschling was born one sec­ond after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, gaining her rP.cognition as thP. first baby boomer -a generation of nearly 80 million born from 1946 to 1964. Astrue said. 
"She's leading the way for her generation." Astrue told reporters. 

Bacon painting sells for $16.4 million 
LONDON -A Francis Bacon painting the artist donated to an art college in lieu of rent decades ago has sold for $16.4 million at an auction where solid but unspectacular results suggest global financial turmoil may be unsettling the art market. 
"Study from the Human Body, Man Turning on the Light" was bought late Sunday by an anonymous bidder at Christie's auction house. The painting was giv11n by Bacon to the Hoyal College of Art in 1969 as payment for renting a studio, and th11 collegp, sold it Sunday to fund a new campus in south London. 
This month's London auctions are being closely watched for signs that after sever­al years of rising prices, the red-hot art market may be cooling. 
The price paid for the Bacon painting, which includes a buyer's premium, was in the middle of Christie's pre-sale estimate of $14 million to $18 million. 
Fine-art insurer Hiscox says the value of contemporary art sold at auction rose by 55 pnrcent during the first six months of the year. But many fear the weak dollar and fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis will hit prices.

Airbus releases world's largest jet 
Almost two years late, the A380 superjumbo premieres on Singapore Airlines 
Associated Press 
TOULOUSE -Nearly two years late, Airbus finally delivered its first A380 superjumbo on Monday, a revolutionary behemoth that includes luxury suites equipped with comfy double beds. 
Customer Singapore Airlines says the passen­ger jet, the world's largest, was worth the wait, and the delivery marks a badly needed morale-boosting mile­stone for Airbus. 
Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Chew Choon Seng said his airline was inconvenienced by the late delivery, but added, "We are glad that Airbus took the time to make sure that the plane is fully tested and developed before it enters commer­cial service." 
For Airbus, big chal­lenges with the problem­ridden plane still lie ahead-not least produc­ing enough of them.

Back when I wasn't so pessimistic and grouchy, I was very interested in getting married. I'd only marry a Catholic, since it didn't make sense to fmter into a sacrament with someone who didn't under-

Domer 
never get it from me. 
I'm not ashamed that one reason I picked Notre Dame was to find a wife -with so many Catholie girls, there was sure to be one stupid enough to like me. I know some girls at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's get ridiculed for being extra-eager to find a hus­band-the "M.R.S. degree." This makes no sense to me. !low is it in any way shameful to be more interested in finding a spouse than getting a diplo­ma? Which, ultimately, is more impor­tant? 
So it saddfms me that there aren't more graduation-weddings. It's a prob­lem that people wait so long to marry these days in general. For one thing, the Church has traditionally under­stood the primary end of marriage to be the protection of chastity, This is dear in St. Paul's writings (e.g., 1 Cor 
7) and later in St. Thomas Aquinas. Most people, men especially, can't achieve celibate chastity and couldn't even if they were at all inclined to try. Besides lots of grace, it takes strenu­ous effort of the soul, constant vigi­lance, discipline, and a determination to keep getting back up no matter how many times you fall. These are very manly qualities, yet somehow much of our society considers it manlier to be a slave to pleasure (which always is emasculating) and one's desires than to disdain them. So anyway, if people wait until they're 30 to marry, that usually means they spend their twen­ties habitually sinning against chastity. Bad enough in itself, and certainly not good preparation for marriage. 
Well, I was sort of new to 

Catholicism when I came to Notre 
Dame, and somewhat naive. I assumed 
Catholic meant Catholic. Now, one 
potential major problnm (obviously) in 
marriages between Catholics and non­
Catholics, or between Catholics with 
different understandings or being 
Catholic. is the issue of contraception. 
Since getting attached to someone you wouldn't marry is foolish, I had to get girls' opinions before potentially becoming interested in them. I figured out pretty quick that not all -not even most, I'd say-self-described Catholic girls at Notre Dame agree with the Church's teaching on contra­ception. I knew about as many who supported it as were categorically opposed to it, though that probably reflected the kind of people I was around. 
My point isn't that contraception is wrong. See Paul VI and Janet Smith for that. Nor am I saying shame on Notre Dame kids for supporting or using it. We all must form and follow our consciences ourselves. No, what I'd like to explain is how dumb it is to say you're Catholic and yet support contraception. 
The Church, particularly in the per­son of the pope, makes outrageous claims about itself. The bishops in solemn assembly, or the pope ex cathe­dra, say they're infallible about faith and morals. That means never wrong. That means not even capable of being wrong. If you believe the Church is in error in its formal announcements about contraception, you can't very well at the same time agree that it's infallible. So why swear any allegiance to a church which doesn't know-or worse, knows but won't admit-the truth about itself? If it can't be believed about itself, how can it be believed when it proclaims other out­rageous doctrines, like the Atonement, Real Presence, or the Trinity? The Church claims to speak with the voice of its Founder. If it does, it deserves full assent. If it doesn't, it's a great big blasphemous fraud that deserves noth­ing but hatred and opposition. 
If you recognize this argumnnt as liko C.S. Lewis about Christ, good eyn. But I thought of it myself. when all I knnw about Lewis was Narnia. I say this not to brag but to show that any­one could think of it. Obviously, the argument holds for any issue, but I apply it to contraeeption beeause dis­sent on that matter is particularly widespread and vehement. 
I'm not telling anyone to leave the Church any more than I was telling anyone to leave Notre Dame before. But if I was puzzled about people opposed to Catholie doctrine staying at Notre Dame, I'm dolinitely confusml about such people staying in the Church. And so what if you're a priest or teach Catholic theology. 
Am I saying a Catholic has to believe whatever the Church teaches authori­tatively? Pretty much, yeah. Does a Catholic have to aetually live whatnvnr the Church tPaches? Hardly-if that were the case, there would bn no Catholics. Failing to live up to our faith is part of being Catholic, but we must try to change our lives to lit our beliefs, not the othnr way around. 
About 85 pnrcent of Notre Dame stu­dents consider themselves Catholic. Just about all who are admitted are very intelligent. And I'd bet almost as many think the Church is wrong about one thing or another. These three dots can't be connected logieally. I know I have no right to tell others whether they should be Catholic or not, but I'd seriously like to know -if you dis­agree with the Church, why not just leave it? I know I would.

The Observer claims to serve Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. But, how well can it serve Saint Mary's when its contributors, up to and including Rich Protiva and Andy Spangler of "Tastes Like Failure," continually disparage the women who attend Saint Mary's? 
I am a graduate of Notre Dame who has worked at Saint Mary's for more than a decade. During my time on both sides of Route 933, I have seen and heard Saint Mary's women put down and abused by their Notre Dame neighbors. You think you're being clever or self righteous, but I have to tell you, the comments just get more bitter and vile as the years go by. And they get old. Your hate speech reveals not only a lack of maturity and good taste, but often outright misogyny. It includes not only the cartoons, but also letters 
to the editor that begrudge Saint Mary's par­ticipation in the "Notre Dame community." Obviously, the editors of the Observer either: 
1) are unwilling or unable to control the degrading content in the paper; or 2) condone the anti-Saint Mary's content. Either way, I am ashamed to see this is still happening 20 years after I graduated. You belittle your­selves and our university's reputation by con­tinuing to resurrect these offensive stereo­types and misconceptions. Enough is enough. It's time to grow up, Notre Dame, and show some class.

TV ti111e-outs a disruption 
Notre Dame's exclusive television contract with NBC is a testament to the strength and national following of the football program. While the University should continue the relationship with NBC, it needs to be restructured, specifically with regard to the excessive amount of time­outs that destroy momentwn and quiet the stadium. During the Boston College game I attended, it was quite remarkable to hear the amount of boos whenever an NBC time-out was called. I am sure that Notre Dame and NBC can find a middle ground that includes fewer time-outs for less money.

Albu111 goes back to roots 

In reading the Scene review of Dashboard Confessional's new album, "The Shade of Poison Trees" (Oct. 11), was disappointed to see that Miss Shaffer had failed to do her homework on the band's intentions for the album. 
Though the album is, admittedly, not one of Chris Carrabba's best efforts, the idea that his band takes a smaller role in this disc was well documented during the recording process by Carrabba him­self. It had long been planned that he would return to the roots that he began his career with in his albums "The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most" and "Swiss Army Romance." In fact, he was so adamant about the album not being a smash that he admit­ted, "I think it would be a stretch for any of these [songs] to get played on radio. We just announced it with such little fanfare and as directly as we could to my exact audience. It's a gift to [Billboard] for waiting so long for some­thing like this." 
Carrabba did not make "Shade" for the masses, for radio, or for the teenage girls who have already saturated the indie market, but for those who know his music best and understand the roots of what has become Dashboard Confessional. In the Billboard article in which this statement is made, he goes on to say that he already has 14 tracks written for the band's next album, though he has no idea when they will record next. Before claiming that Carrabba has sabotaged the concept of "the band," you must first understand what Dashboard Confessional started as -one man and an acoustic guitar and a few drums. Sure, there aren't any instrumental breakdowns, no drum solo's, but that was the plan for an acoustic album pitted in the origins of the Dashboard Confessional concept. This album was not a digression, but simply a reversion to a more conserva­tive style. 
If you are new to the Dashboard scene, then it is understandable that you might be disappointed, but frankly, with all of the changes bands in the music industry make to market themselves more effec­tively, it is refreshing to see Carrabba's head on straight. There may not be any jaw-dropping, ear-exploding, make-me­want-to-go-out-tonight-and-profess-my­love-for-her-outside-her-dorm-room­window songs on "Shade," but not every musical effort can be an artist's best. And let's be honest, David Bowie and Ziggy Stardust did just fine.

Focus on a-wareness 
To respond to Matt Gore's edito­rial ("Climate control not best use of funds," Oct. 10), which used Energy Week as an inspiration to criticize funding to research cli­mate change, I would first like to inform him that Notre Dame's first annual Energy Week was not about climate change, but about awareness. The week's events tried to educate the community about our individual energy use, the possibilities of renewable energy sources, and the measures our University is taking on energy issues. But since Mr. Gore brought up climate change: 
Uncertainty about what the actual temperature change will be does not translate into uncertainty that climate change is happening. There is no debate in the scientific community that global warming is happening, and the consensus is that it's happening because of humans burning fossil fuels and destroying forests. Unless we change our habits fast and limit the amount of greenhouse gases we emit, there will be significant changes to our planet and dire consequences for the humans that inhabit it. The worldwide effects of a change of 1 degree Celsius are severe; 5 degrees, unthink­able. 
Mr. Gore brings up HIV and malaria prevention programs as alternatives to invest in for humanity, and I believe these issues certainly deserve our atten­tion. But money for mosquito nets is not going to be enough. Global warming will only increase the geographic range and number of people at risk for transmission of malaria and other infectious dis­eases. Local environmental and socioeconomic condition.s, includ­ing access to energy, will largely determine the actual occurrence of diseases, making the popula­tions Mr. Gore is concerned about most vulnerable to the human effects of climate change. 
If we truly desire to help human­ity, we cannot be so short-sighted as to look only at the immediate problems we face today. We must also look to the future, to the gen­erations that will inherit our world and ask ourselves what kind of world we are creating for them.

For average Joe, rock-stardotn is just a guitar store away 
Anybody can be a rock star. All it takes is a beat-up amp and an electric guitar. Or so tlw thousands of pElople who have taught themselves how to rock like .Jirnrni llnndrix would have you believe. Lnarning to play the guitar has hoeonw an increas­ingly easy task. With the resources of the Internet and the surplus of madi­ly available instru­ments, guitar-godli­ness is just a strum or two away. 
Naturally, learn­ing the guitar starts with obtaining the instrument, and there are sevenll ways to go about this. Start by checking with family members. You might 

Chris McGrady 
Assistant Scene Editor 
be surprised to lind your dad has a 1972 Fender Strat tucked away in the attic, proving to you that his college afro hair­cut wasn't just for show. If you're not so lucky to have a clad who is more rock 'n' roll than rocking chair, then your next best bet is a used-instrument store. Many places carry reasonably priced {think $75 -$125) guitars that will more than fulfill the needs of the fledgling guitarist. When, and more importantly if, you start to out­play your equipment, then you can spend the big bucks on a thousand dollar guitar and amp combo. 
Whether you go acoustic or electric is up to you and your specific needs and musical preferences: Try acoustic for John Mayer-esque quad concerts for a lucky lady and electric for spine-tingling solos. 
Now the next step: choosing lessons or the do-it-yourself approach. Lessons are always a pricey endeavor. Other problems include getting burnt out by not learning the music you really want to play and having to work around a difficult sched­ule. Often, teaching yourself is the best route for the new guitarist. Save lessons for when you are trying to get over a par­ticular big plateau in your playing abili­ties that is preventing you from becoming the next Clapton or Satriani. 

Find yourself an approach that suits your learning style. The best place to do this is, not surprisingly, the Internet. Some sites advocate finding a diflkult piece and working with it until you can play it. This approach will only work for those people with a decent amount of musical talent and the patience of a saint. 
Other sites say to start with the basics -finger position, simple chords, and scales -and work with them until they've been mastered. Then work your way onto easy songs like "Free Falling" by Tom Petty, "Take It Easy" by The 
Eagles, or any other work following a simple chord progression. The next step is the longest-and the most trying. I'm talking 'bout practice. 
Practice, practice, practice . 
When you're done practicing, practice some more. Learning the guitar is a time­consuming and frustrating task, but the fruits of your labor will be great. All gui­tar enthusiasts get annoyed by dillicult pieces and chorrls they can't quite play, but conquering that struggle will be immensely satisfying. Stick with it through the dillieult times, and soon you'll be on your way to roek-star status. 
Now, if only you can find those leather pants.

Regina Spektor 
By JAMES COSTA Assistant Scene Ediwr 
An intPgral element of' growing up is undPrstancling the beautiful and chal­lenging complexities of life. Hegina Spnktor's rww album, "Begin to Hope," is an extraordinary insight into one p1wson 's perspective on the curious bal­ance bntwem1 hop!~ and despair, youth and maturity. 
Spektor has had quite the life already, a Hussian immi­grant to the U.S. with years of dassieal train­
extraordinary talents. 
"Begin to II ope" achieves its most pro­found el'f'eet when given a thorough lis­ten. Sure, certain tracks stand out. Some have the beat and the rhythm to earn instant appeal. But as the listener moves through the album as a whole and each song individually, what Spektor is looking to accomplish beconws remarkably elear. She is a woman who's seen the world and the many lovels to the worlds she's shared 

Begin To Hope 
Regina Spektor Released by: Sire 
Recommended Tracks: ''On The Radio," "Samson's" and "Fidelity" 

Spektor treats the lis­tener to "On The Hadio." To truly under­stand and appreciatn the song, check out the video on Spektor's Web site. It's a rather stunning few minutes, with elever lyrics accentuated by penetrat­ing and imaginative music. She twice references the epic Guns N' Roses song "November Hain" as she sings, "On the radio I We heard November Hain I The solo's real long I But it's a pretty song" and "And on the radio I You hear 
''Begin to Hope'' 
with others and within herself. 
The opening track, "Fidelity," is sim­ply amazing. Employing a Dr. Dre-like beat, it's impossible not to smile at the cleverness of Spektor in creating a song with a hip-hop feel and lyrics more akin to an act like Jewel or Ashlee Simpson. And I'm not saying Regina is at all like Ashlee Simpson, because she's not. 
Spektor is pure and unadulterated talent. She's smart, and she uses her talents to tell stories that are real. pow­erful, and often beauti­fully raw. It's music for those who share her 
November Rain I That solo's awful long I But it's a good refrain" 
It's tough to tell whether song is a recounting of a single memory, or a dream, or a collection of many differ­ent experiences and moments in one striking offering. 
This difficulty is part of its wonderful appeal and carries over most of the rest of the album. It can be said that listener never truly knows for

sure where Spektor is and so it's con­stant game of figuring out and catching up. enjoying the game immensely all the while. 
Much in the fashion of artists such as Ryan Adams or Ray LaMontagne, Spektor is excellent at using her voice in virtually every fashion imaginable. Whether it's a near inaudible whisper of painful remembrance in "That Time's" or a rousing call in "Samson's" {"Oh we couldn't bring the columns down I Yeah we couldn't destroy a sin­gle one I And this history books forgot about us I And the bible didn't mention us I Not even once"), Spektor has mas­tered her understanding and employ­ment of the subtle complexities of the voice to most accurately convey the ideas she's decided to sing about.

'Kings of the Kilburn High Road' to open in the DPAC 
By TAE ANDREWS 
Scene Ediwr 
The play "Kings of the Kilburn lligh Hoad" opens on the Deeio Mainstage Theatre in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center tonight. 
"Kings of the Kilburn High Hoacl" wcrs inked by playwright .Jimmy Murphy, a Dublin native, whose othnr work includes "Brothers of the Brush," "A Picture of Paradise" and "The Muesli Belt." lie is a former member of the Abbey Theatre's advisory council and was a writer in residence at NUl Maynooth. lie has won multiple awards, including The Stewart Parker Award for best lirst play in 1994 and three Bursaries in Literature from the Arts Council of Ireland. 
The play's plot revolves around the experiences of a group of enterprising young men who leave their homes in lrnland, hop in a boat and literally set sail for England in the hopes of improving their rnspeetive lots in life and returning home rich. 
Unfortunately, one member of the group, Jackie Flavin, dies and his body is sent home for a wake. 
Told from an after-the-fact perspec­tive, "The Kings of thn Kilburn lligh Hoad" follows the action after the rest of the bunch regroups in Ireland to recoup and recount their adventures and experiences in life. 
Though Murphy's original play deals with the subject matter of the hopes and dreams of Irish immigrants in London during the 1970s, tonight's show featurns an all-African east. 
In the same way that Irish people left their native shores in search of a better life in other countries, today immi­grants to Ireland indude Africans and Eastern Europeans. In this way, "Kings of the Kilburn lligb Hoad" ofl'ers a par­allel structure contrasting the immi­grant experience or today against the immigrant experience of the past.

NFL 


Giants cruise over Falcons 
Manning leads New York to easy win over struggling Atlanta 
Associated Press 
J\TI.J\NTJ\ -Tlw New York 

Ciants are on another roll. 
Now, they've got to sustain it. 
nti Manning passed for 30:{ 

yards and two touchdowns, 
leading the (;iants to their 
fourth straight win, 31-10 over 
tho hapless Atlanta Falcons on 
Monday night. 
The Giants (4-21 took control after a wild first quarter in which the tnarns eombinnd for 24 points. Nnw York scored the final 24 points to send the Michael Vick-lnss Falcons tum­bling to thnir fifth loss in six games. 
"I felt good throwing the ball," said Manning, who eom­pleted 12 straight at one point in the first half. "I was getting opportunities in a timely fash­ion. I was spreading the ball around to all receivers." 
The Giants have bounced back after starting the season with losses to Dallas and Green Bay, but they must be mindful of the collapse that knocked them out of the playoffs a year ago. 
J\ live-game winning streak had the Giants at 6-2 midway through the 2006 season, but thny managed just two more wins the rnst of the way. 
Maybe that's why coach Tom Coughlin didn't sound all that enthused. 
"I thought sometimes we did play well offensively, and then sometimes we did not," he said. 'There were some issues." 
Manning threw a pair of touchdown passes and set up another New York TD with three straight completions, which lessened the damage of two intereeptions and losing a fumble when John Abraham knocked the ball loose just before the quarterback's arm went forward. 
It also helped to be playing the Falcons, who are averaging just 13.2 poinl'i a game. 
"They are a good defensive football team," Coughlin said. "They have some problems, obviously, on the offensive side of thn ball." 
Manning was 27 -of-39 and put up his highest total sinee a 312-yard pnrformanee against the Cowboys in Week 1. 
lie hooked up with Amani Toomer on a 5-yard scoring pass in the back-and-forth opening period. Before the half was done, Manning went deep for a 43-yard touchdown to Plaxico Burress that gave the Giants a 21-10 lead; Burress turned to the crowd and bowed after getting wide open down the middle. 

The Faleons have little reason to take a bow. Their offense is dreadful, a striking contrast to the high-scoring teams that Bobby Petrino coached in col­lege. 
Playing behind a patched-up line, Joey Harrington was sacked four times, had several passes dellected at the line and did plenty of scrambling to avoid New York's fearsome pass rush, which had tied a league record with 12 sacks of Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb two weeks earlier. 
The Falcons. who were start­ing two nnw tackles because of injuries, actually did a better­than-expected job keeping Osi Umenyiora, Michael Strahan & Co. away from Harrington. That was largely because llarrington went with quick drops and short passes, not leaving much time to open up the passing game. 
"Eventually, they started to dominate the line of scrim­mage," Petrino said. "We could­n't sustain the run and execute the passing game." 
After yanking Harrington the previous week in favor of Byron Leftwich, the Falcons didn't have a baekup plan against the Giants. Leftwich, who signed with Atlanta after Week 2, was designated as the third quarter­back because of a sore ankle, and backup Chris Redman has not played in a game since 2003. 
"Byron probably could have gone in there and played," Petrino said. "But missing two days of practice when he's only been here a month, that would have been hard to do. We decided to stick with Joey and see what he could do." 
Not much. Harrington was 18-of-39 for 209 yards, putting him in danger of losing another starting job after he was already deposed in Detroit and Miami. The Falcons were total­ly inept after their quick start, managing 159 yards and nine first downs over the final three quarters, most of them coming after the Giants already had put the game away. 
"When they pop in that film," Strahan said, "I don't want them to say the defensive line didn't give it everything we had." 
Redman did start warming up at one point late in the first half after Harrington was shak­en up on a sack by Antonio Pierce, but the starter was able to stay in the game, much to the chagrin of Atlanta fans who still miss Vick. 
When another Falcons pos­session fizzled with about 10 minutes remaining, the red­clad fans at the Georgia Dome delivered one last round of boos and headed for the exits, leav­ing a healthy contingent of New York fans to cheer on their team the rest of the way. 

Even at 43, Testaverde still has what it takes 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-Vinny 
Testaverde was excited and 
nervous. 
When he signed last 
Wednesday with the Carolina 
Panthers, the 43-year-old 
thought he could still play. But 
he wasn't sure he'd gain the 
respect of his teammates. 
"Not having the support of the 
players was a worry of mine," 
Testaverde said Monday. 
"Dealing with me being 43 years 
old and the players looking at 
me and saying, 'Hey, how is this 
guy going to help us? lie's 43. 
He's not going to be able to do 
it."' 
"I wanted to show them 
through practice and certainly 
through the game that I was 
capable of holding up my end of 
the bargain." 
He has nothing to worry about anymore. Except perhaps being involved in a quarterback con­troversy. 
The man nicknamed "Dad" by his teammates led the Panthers to a 25-10 win at Arizona on Sunday despite not knowing all his teammates' names. An emergency fill-in with Jake Delhomme out for the season with an elbow injury and David Carr nursing a sore back, Testaverde learned enough of the offense in four days to become the third-oldest quarter­back to start an NFL game and the oldest to win one. 
A guy who spent the previous Sunday at home watching games on TV completed 20 of 33 passes for 206 yards, including the go­ahead 65-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith in the fourth quarter. Testaverde, who hadn't thrown a ball in more than five weeks until Wednesday's prac­tice, didn't throw an interception as the Panthers moved to 4-2 heading into their bye week. 
"It's a pretty good feeling to be called upon on short notice, not really knowing your personnel, what players are capable of doing, and going out and win­ning the football game," Testaverde said. 
The old body held up pretty well, too. Testaverde said he felt "not too bad" as he lifted weights and did some light run­ning Monday. 
Meanwhile, Vinnymania had gripped the Carolinas. Fans were calling into radio shows Monday urging that Testaverde, who turns 44 next month, start ahead of Carr on Oct. 28 against Indianapolis. 
Coach John Fox wasn't avail­able to reporters Monday, and Testaverde isn't sure of his role. 
"I have no clue. There has 
been no conversation with me," 
Testaverde said. "Whatever the 
decision is, I'm here to help in 
any way I can." 
Entering his 21st season, the 
No. 1 overall pick in the 1987 
draft was cut by Nnw England 
before the season. lie returned 
home to Long Island and 
thought he'd get a call from the 
Patriots to rejoin them later in 
the season as insurance. 
But then there was a rash of 
quarterbaek injuries around the 
league, and general manager 
Marty Hurney acknowledged 
Monday signing Testaverde 
involved some luek. 
Hurney was scrambling to lind a QB after it was learned Delhomme would undergo sea­son-ending elbow surgery and Carr was questionable with a back injury. 
Hurney looked at the thin list of available QBs and thought Testa verde was the best option. 
"If anybody could come in on Wednesday and be effective on Sunday, certainly it would be him," Hurney said. 
But then llurney learned Testaverde was going to sign with Arizona, and crossed him off the list. 
A day later, Panthers strength and conditioning coach Jerry Simmons, a friend of Testa verde from their days together in Cleveland in the 1990s, called to congratulate him on going to the Cardinals. Testaverde told Simmons he'd changed his mind because of the distance he'd be from his family in New York. 
Simmons relayed the informa­tion to Hurney. He immediately called Testaverde, who said he'd be interested in coming to Carolina because it was on the East Coast. 
Testaverde flew to Charlotte early Wednesday, took his physi­cal, signed his one-year contract and was taken on a golf cart to the practice field just as the workout began. 
Testaverde had some familiar­ity with the offense because coordinator Jeff Davidson once worked under Bill Belichick in New England. But learning the system in four days was a monu­mental task. 
He returned few phone calls and missed the Testaverde old man jokes from Jay Leno and others on TV to study the play­book and watch film. 
"Our players noticed he had DVDs and was watching cutups on the flight out to Arizona, preparing," Hurney said. "Our players just got the opportunity to see how a guy prepares men­tally and physically that's been in the league as long as Vinny has."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Associated Press 
LINCOLN, Neb. Nebraska athletic direc­tor Steve Pederson was fired Monday, two days after the school's once­mighty football team was rocked with its worst home loss in nearly a half-century. 
Pederson, along with coach Bill Callahan, has been heavily criticized after a series of one­sided losses this season. The most recent was a 45-14 loss to Oklahoma State on Saturday with former Cornhuskers coach Tom Osborne and his 1997 national title team in attendance. 
Callahan's job is appar-ently safe for now. Chancellor Harvey Perlman said the next athletic director would decide the fate of the football staff. 


Over the past two weeks, the Huskers (4~3) have lost by a combined score of 86-20, -dropping a 41-6 decision at Missouri two weeks ago. 
"There is no joy in my heart for having to do this," Perlman said. He said it would cost at least 
$2.2  million  to  buy  
Pederson out of  his  con­ 
tract.  

At the end of the July, Pederson's contract was ren~wed for five years, but this season has been a nightmare for the most part. Even in victory -a 41-40 nail-biter against Ball State the Huskers' defense was far from the force it used to be. 
For the first time in their 118-year history, the Cornhuskers have allowed at least 40 points four times in a season. 
"You make the best decision you can with the information you have," Perlman said. 
The chancellor also said since July he's noticed a decline in morale and growing con­cern about keeping key personnel in the athletic department. Paul Meyers, a key fundraiser, was among several peo-
IN BRIEF Pereiro gets yellowjersey
from Lan(lis for 2006 Tour 
MADRID, Spain -Oscar Pereiro finally got his hands on the winner's yellow jersey from the 2006 Tour de France on Monday. 
"Finally, we have a winner and it's Oscar," Tour direetor Christian Prudhomme said. "Oscar, you have won the Tour out on the road." 
The Spaniard moved up from sec­ond to first after the disqualification of Floyd Landis for doping. 
"I have the feeling of arriving at the end of a thriller, after having spent 14 months thinking about it and not being able to concentrate as I should have on my job," Pereiro said. "It is essentially a kind of release." 
The International Cycling Union formally declared Pereiro the winner on Sept. 21, one day after a U.S. arbi­tration panel voted 2-1 to remove the title from Landis for using synthetic testosterone during the Tour. 

Injured Bulger to start for 
wmlessRams 
ST. LOUIS -Watching the win­less St. Louis Rams lose two more games while he nursed two bro­ken ribs was long enough on the sidelines for Marc Bulger. It'll be months before those injuries heal, but his beat-up team needs him. 
Bulger said Monday he plans to return to the lineup this week, and coach Scott Linehan said the quarterback would be cleared to play at Seattle. 
"Yeah, I'm playing," Bulger said. ''I'm ready now after stand­ing around for two weeks. They definitely feel a little better, but I haven't been hit." 
Bulger said he couldn't worry about compounding those injuries. 
"I don't think we have an option right now," he said. "It doesn't matter if it's smart, I think I have to."

pie who departed. 
Several people came forward with concerns about Pederson's man­agement style and his connection with staff, donors and athletes, Perlman said. 
"Every one of you thinks this is because of a football game that was played last Saturday," Pederson said. "It may well be that the vulnera­bility of the football pro­gram encouraged people to come forward when prior to that they had not." 
A search for an interim athletic director has begun, with the next step to find a permanent replacement. 

Bryant sits out of second 
straight preseason practice 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -Kobe Bryant sat out practice for the sec­ond straight day Monday because of a sore knee, and said he didn't know if he'd play in the Los Angeles Lakers' next exhibition game. 
The Lakers face the Seattle SuperSonics on Thursday night in Bakersfield -the first of six exhibi­tion games in niJw days. 
Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson said Bryant asked to rest his legs, adding that treatment included ice and massage. Bryant wasn't avail­able to the media afterward, but before leaving the Lakers' practice facility, he expressed uncertainty concerning Thursday night, saying he would continue treatment. 
Bryant has said very little to reporters since team owner Jerry Buss said last week in Honolulu that he "would certainly listen" to trade offers for the Lakers' star.

NHL Ward slims down, shines for 1 Canes 
Associated Press 
HALEIGII, N.C. -Cam Ward lost about 20 pounds. What he hasn't lost lately are many games. 
A winner of four straight starts, Carolina's slimmed­down goalie has yet to lose in regulation and has emerged as a big reason for the first-plaee llurrieanes' quick start this season. 
Six months ago, the Hurricanes became just the third team in the modern era to drop from Stanley Cup champions to playoff no­shows. Now, with a revit<tl­ized, lighter Ward in net, they lead the Southeast Division and are out to prevent their postseason fate from being determined in the season's final weeks. 
"You'd hate to look baek at your season and wish in the narly s1mson that you had a bnttnr game here or there, or I eould havn gotten a win here or there." Ward said Monday. "Every gamn is huge. It's not just about the seeond half or the last wnnk. trying to gnt into the playoffs. It's what you do throughout tlw entire sea­son that really matters." 
So far, all of Ward's numbers this season are better than last year's totals -including his weight. 
Arter playing the past two seasons -and winning the 2006 Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP -at around 200 pounds, Ward said he most recently weighed in at 
177. 
Sleeker and quicker, Ward has allowed just nine goals on the 156 shots he has faced through five games, and his save percentage of .942 ranks fifth in the league. His goals­against average of 1. 79 is more than a goal better than it was last season, and ranks second among goalies who have played at least four games. 
lie's one of three goalies with at least four wins so far, with his lone blemish a sea­son-opening overtime loss to Montreal. Only Ottawa's Martin Gorber (192) has more saves than Ward's 147. 
And, lw was the backbone of the Hurricanes' three-game swing through eastern Canada last week, helping Carolina swenp Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal by a combined score of 15-5 -a performance that led the NII L to name him its No. I star of the week.

Titans' Young day to day after MRI on leg 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -The Tennessee Titans are hoping quarterback Vincn Young is a fast lwalnr. 
Young had an MHI exam· Monday to eheek out his strained right quadriceps mus­cle. The results of the test weren't immediately available, and eoach JP!l" Fisher said Young would be considerml day to day. 
Tight ond Ho Scaife saw the quarterback walking around Monday and thought Young looked like he was fine. Onn hn<lling fac:tor could eomn from thn sehPduln. The Titans (3-2) visit Young's hometown Sunday and the team, the Texans (3-31, that. passed him ovnr in the 200h drall. 
"lie lovos it down thorn. and llwy lovo him down llwro," said Seaifo, Young's college~ team­malo at Tnxas. "I think there's nothing morn for him to be able to play. I'm surn lw's going to do cwc~rything lw ean to try to son that it happens." 
Fisher said the test was to dntorminn tlw hnst c:ourse or trnatmcmt for the 2006 Ollimsivn Hookin of tlw Year who was injured at the nnd of a 2-yard run to the sidnlirw midway through tlw third quartnr of Sunday's 13-10 loss to Tarn pa Bay. 
"lie could not practico today," Fisher said. "If we had practice today, lw'd bo soro. But it's not as bad as we thought. So he'll bo day to day, and our treatment path will bo to try to gc~t him baek on the practice field as fast as we ean." 
The Titans will be without recnivnr Brandon Jones on Sunday. Fisher said the third­year receiver had arthroscopic surgery on his knee Monday and will bn out a week or two. Jones hurt his right knee on Oct. 7 in a 20-13 win against Atlanta. 
But thn Titans have a handful of hnalthy reenivers led by Eric Moulds, Hoyd11ll Williams and .Justin Gage. The health of the quarterback who has led Tennessnn to nine victories in its last 12 games is what matters most. 
"No question we're definitely eoncornnd about our leader on offenso," linebacker David Thornton said. "We need him. lin's a guy who's going to make plays and continue to make plays. Wn hope thn MRI shows it's not a situation where he's going to bn out for an extended poriod oftime." 
The injury has the Titans con­sidering some roster moves with Knrry Collins the only other quarterback. Tim Hattay was in training eamp, but was released Sept. I and signnd with Arizona, whnrn hn played much of Sunday's loss to Carolina. Ingle Martin, a Nashville native and (;renn Bay's firth-round draft pick in 2006, is on the practice squad. 
l'untnr .Josh Miller could be cut to make room for a third quarterback because Craig Hentrid1 has punted the two wneks since a sore back kept him out of a gamn Sc1pt. 24.

ALCS 
Strong pitching leads Indians over Red Sox 


Westbrook stars as Tribe wins at home, takes 2-1 series lead 
Associated Press 
CLEVElAND-Not their best. 
Not even second best. Jake 
Westbrook, right at home in the 
Jake, was exactly what the 
Cleveland Indians needed. 
Westbrook, an often over­looked third wheel in the rota­tion, kept Boston grounded for nearly seven innings Monday ·night, leading the Indians to a 4­2 win over the Red Sox and a 2­1 lead in the AL championship 
series. 
The laid-back right-hander, 
who missed a big chunk of the 
season with an injury, doesn't 
possess the overpowering stuff 
of either C. C. Sabathia or Fausto 
Carmona -Cleveland's two 
aces who flopped badly in 
Games 1 and 2 at Fenway Park 
-or their stellar reputations. 
But Westbrook does have a 
devastating sinkerball, and oh 
my, how it sunk the Red Sox. 
Backed by an early homer 
from old pro Kenny Lofton, 
Westbrook took a shutout into 
the seventh inning. 
Game 4 on Tuesday night will 
feature two soft tossers: 
Cleveland's Paul Byrd, with his 
old-school windup, and Boston's 
Tim Wakefield, the 41-year-old 
knuckleballing master. 
Boston grounded into three 
double plays, two of them by 
October's scariest twosome ­
David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez. 
They combined for something 
more unusual -Ramirez's 
grounder nailed Big Papi in the 
leg on the basepaths for an out 
that helped Westbrook. 
In all, Westbrook got 14 of 19 
outs on balls the Red Sox pound­
ed weakly into the manicured 
grass and infield dirt at Jacobs 
Field, which hosted its first ALCS 
game since 1998. Back then, 
Westbrook was in Montreal's 
minor league system perfecting 
a pitch that drops, dips and 
darts as it approaches home 
plate. 
The Red Sox couldn't do any­
thing with it until the seventh, 
when Jason Varitek hit a two­
run homer. 
Jensen Lewis relieved with a 
runner on and struck out rookie 
Dustin Pedroia to end the inning. 
Rafael Betancourt worked a per­
fect eighth and Joe Borowski, 
the AL saves leader, pitched a 
rare 1-2-3 ninth. 
Lofton, with a baseball pass­port stamped by 11 teams over 17 seasons, handed Westbrook an early lead with a two-run homer in the second inning off Daisuke Matsuzaka. Cleveland added two more runs in the fifth against the high-priced Japanese import, whom the Red Sox invested more than $100 million in to pitch in games like this. 
By comparison, Westbrook was a bargain at $33 million for the Indians, who locked him up in April for three more years before he had a chance to test the free-agent market after this season. 
Westbrook then spent seven weeks on the disabled list with a side injury and didn't find his groove until August, when he went 4-1 with a 1.90 ERA. But even then, Westbrook, who lost to the Red Sox on July 23, was­n't expected to shut down Boston. 
Westbrook was in complete control until J.D. Drew grounded a one-out single to center in the seventh. Varitek followed with a homer to center, bringing the Red Sox to 4-2. 
The homer ended Boston's 13­inning scoreless streak, a drought that began in the sixth inning of Game 2 on Saturday night. 
Westbrook struck out Coco Crisp but when Julio Lugo beat out an infield single, manager Eric Wedge pulled his gutty starter, who received a thunder­ous ovation from the towel-wav­ing crowd of 44,402 as he jogged to the dugout. 
Lofton, a 40-year-old who could still pass as a twentysome­thing, gave the Indians a 2-0 lead in the second with his sev­enth career postseason homer. 
Ryan Garko singled with one out, and with two down, Lofton, traded back for his third stint with the Indians in July, turned on Matsuzaka's first pitch and sent it on a low trajectory and barely over the right-field waH. 
After high-fiving delirious teammates, L9fton, whose every move has been cheered since he returned to Cleveland, carne out and tipped his helmet to the adoring crowd. 
The Red Sox ran themselves out of a potential scoring oppor­tunity in the fourth. 
Ortiz ended an 0-for-8 drought vs. Westbrook with an opposite­field double off the wall in left, but then was struck on the leg when he inexplicably broke for !hird on a hard-hit grounder.

Pair of co-defendants accept deals in O.J. case 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Two men who cut plna deals Monday in a Las Vegas twist that authori­ties say O.J. Simpson master­minded could hamper the f'or­nwr football star's dnfense, but the nw n 's dubious back­grounds could givn prosec:u­tors prohll'tns.

Jackson and Hobert Blako in eases that turned on witness credibility, said the move by co-defendants to plead out and testify to save themsolves shows the prosecution's motive is to get Simpson. 
"This might feed into the idea of a setup," he said. "They set him up in the hotel room and tape recorded it and no.w tlwy're setting him up in court." 
Simpson's celebrity and the fact that many feel he was wrongly acquittml in 1995 of murdering his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her frifmd, Honald Goldman, could weigh heavily against him and may emerge as the dominant tlwme in the case.

six-game winning streak, the Irish have averaged 3.7 goals per game. Twice they have scored at least five times, and only once have they scored less than three. 
Part of the offensive produc­tion is due to junior forward Brittany Bock, who has a five­game goal streak and nine total goals during those games. But with Cinalli out and Weissenhofer seeing limited playing time, freshman forward Rose Augustin shoulders a larger burden. 
Augustin has started four games this season, against Stanford, DePaul, Penn State and Cincinnati, averaging between 30 and 40 minutes off the bench when not starting. She had a goal against both Cincinnati and Syracuse, but did not score until Notre Dame's 5-0 victory over Villanova Sunday. Although Augustin played only 38 minutes off the bench against the Wildcats, she scored two goals and had an assist. 
Irish coach Randy Waldrum said Augustin wasn't ready for the rigors of college play when she first arrived on campus. 
"She was used to sitting in the box and waiting for the ball to come to her," Waldrum said. "We needed her to get more touches, and if they weren't there, to ere-ate more touches." 
The coaches talked to her about finding ways to get the ball and create scoring opportunities, Waldrum said, and she has since become a much better player. 
Waldrum said Augustin's improvement in attacking the ball was the main reason her role increased in the absence of Cinalli and Weissenbofer. 
"She's really done a good job of attacking the ball," Waldrum said. 
The "very low-maintenance" Augustin was even-keeled when forced to accept a new role, he said. 
Eventually, Weissenhofer and Cinalli will return, but Waldrum said having too many good play­ers is a dilemma he is used to and prefers. 
"I've coached both sides, and I'd much rather have too many good players than too few," he said. "It's a good coaching prob­lem to have." 
Waldrum said Cinalli and Weissenhofer will play when they return, but they must per­form well. 
"When Weissenhofer comes back, she will play, but she'll have to challenge Augustin," he said. "You have to go with the player who's hot." 
After she notched five points against the Wildcats, it is clear Augustin is just that.

players, including sophomore midfielder Sammi Goudreau, have improved significantly and should help the team for the remainder of the season. 
"Her last couple games have been tremendous and her contributions immeasurable," MacKenzie said of Goudreau. 
In wins over strong confer­ence rivals Kalamazoo and Adrian, the Belles showed they could compete against some of the top MIAA squads. MacKenzie hopes the Belles continue to add to some of their early-season success.

Riders head to Purdue show; field hockey team loses 3-2 
Special to The Observer 

Equestrian 

The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's equestrian club opened IHSA competition this weekend in a show host­ed by Purdue. Kelley Daniels was the reserve high point rider. Despite featuring many new members this year, the club managed a fifth-place finish at the show. 
Lauren Desrosiers placed third in open fences, the best showing for the club in the advanced competition. Daniels won in novice fences, with teammates Katie Pietrucha, Heather LaDue and Jen Gilardi fin­ishing third, fourth and fifth, respectively. Daniels also earned first place in novice flat. Laura Hale took second, LaDue was third, Andrea Kochert finished fifth and Maria Cardoso and Gilardi tied for sixth in that event. 
Krista Jones gave the Irish their best performance in intermediate flat, riding to fourth place. Laura Divel finished sixth in advanced walk-trot-canter and Katrina Stewart also took sixth in walk-trot. In beginning walk-trot-canter, Catherine Germer and Tiffany Olier took second and third, respectively, to complete the Irish scoring. 
The club will next compete Nov.10-11 at Saint Mary's of the Woods College. 
Field hockey 
A shorthanded Irish fell 3­2 to Miami (Ohio) this Sunday at Riehle field. With only one substitute available at the beginning of the game, an injury early in the second half left the squad with little relief. The Irish scored the only two goals of the first half, by Danielle Fedele and freshman Suzie 
Carlsen.  Both  scores  were  
unassisted.  
But  in  the  second  half,  

fatigue showed as the Red Hawks sent wave after wave of fresh players onto the field. Miami scored all three of its goals in the last six minutes of the game. The game-winner came with about a minute left. 
Catherine Duffy was in goal for the Irish and fin­ished with nine saves. 

MEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
O'Neill tames Dawgs for first win 
By GRIFFIN DASSATTI and 
ANDY ZICCARELLI 
Sports Writers 

O'Neill got its first win of the season in dramatic fashion Sunday, beating Alumni 7-6. 
Both teams came into the game winless -Alumni at 0-2 and O'Neill at 0-3 -but the energy on both sidelines was high. 
O'Neill's offense had trouble holding onto the ball early on. After driving 25 yards in its first eight plays, the Mob's opening drive was cut short when Alumni junior line­backer Matt Tehrani inter­cepted senior quarterback Chris Stroh's first pass attempt. 
After forcing the Dawgs offense to an opening-drive three-and-out, the Mob com­mitted its second turnover. This time, Stroh was sacked as he tried to roll out of the pock­et and fumbled. The loose ball out with the win," he said. "O'Neill is a team better than their record would show and we didn't want to give them a chance." 
As the second half began, Conley noticed something dif­ferent from previous weeks ­an attitude that could create the chance Alumni was hoping to prevent. 
"The whole mood for the second half was that people were having fun," he said. "I don't know what it was but today there was definitely a different sense on the field. When people have fun, good things happen." 
After holding the Dawgs to two three-and-outs on their first two drives of the half, O'Neill rode to the end zone ­and the lead -on the backs of Powers and senior running back Braden Turner. The two rushers combined for all 44 yards the Mob gained on the opening drive of the fourth quarter, with Powers running for 23 and Turner gaining 21. 
The seven-play drive culmi­nated in a 10-yard scamper by Powers into the end zone. The subsequent extra point put the Mob up for good. 

Morrissey 20, Dillon 20 
Extra points were the decid­ing factor in Sunday's 20-20 tie between Dillon and Morrissey. Each team scored three touchdowns, but the out­comes of point-after attempts left neither victorious. 
Morrissey attempted a two­point conversion after all three touchdowns, converting once, and Dillon attempted a traditional point-after after each of its three touchdowns, converting on twice. 
Morrissey took the opening drive 65 yards in 10 plays and scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by senior captain Nick Bencomo. 
But Dillon answered on the next drive when sophomore quarterback Joe Garigliano connected on three of four passes on the drive for 50 yards, including a 12-yard scoring strike to sophomore wide receiver Chris Cugliari. The extra point gave the Big Red a 7-6 lead. 
"It has just been a matter of 
time before the offense broke 
out like this," Dillon captain 
Alex Duffy said. "Cugliari 
drew it up like this, and we 
have been practicing it. It was 
only a matter of time before 
we ran it error-free." 
But the Dillon lead was 
short-lived. The Manorites 
scored on the ensuing drive on 
a 31-yard halfback pass by 
running back Danny Deveny. 
Another failed two-point 
attempt knpt the Morrissey 
lead at 12-7. 
Going into halftime, Duffy 
knew his team needed to slow 
down the high-powered 
Morrissey attack. 
"We definitely made some 
adjustments on the line and 
some in the secondary as 
well," Duffy said. 

After taking a 14-12 lead on . a 5-yard run from Garigliano, 
the Big Hed defense shut down 
the next Morrissey drive, forc­
ing a fumble. 
But Dillon fumbled three 
plays later, this time with Morrissey recovering the ball on the 1-yard line. Manorites junior quaterback Joe McBrayer sneaked it across the goal line for the score. The ensuing two-point attempt was successful, giving Morrissey a 20-14 lead with seven minutes remaining. 
After marching down to the Morrissey 4-yard line, Dillon faced a critical fourth-and-one with one minute left. Duffy· called a timeout to strategize with his team. 
"We were deciding whether we wanted to do a quarter­back sneak or hand it off to me," Duffy said. "I said that we should give it to me. I would get it." 
Duffy did just that, plowing forward for the fourth down conversion. He scored on the next play, a 3-yard run that tied the game at 20-20. 
Going for the win, Dillon attempted an extra point, but it was blocked by the Morrissey defensive line, _ keeping the score tied at 20­20.

was picked up and returned for a touchdown, giving Alumni the 6-0 lead. 
"Coming out quickly and get­ting that score was big for us," Alumni senior defensive end Jason Nagle said. "However, we knew we couldn't just sit back on a six-point lead." 
Stroh also sustained an injury to his left (non-throw­ing) shoulder on the play, forc­ing the Mob to play freshman Bobby Powers. Normally, switching quarterbacks mid­game is something to be avoided. But, as O'Neill senior captain Pat Conley explained later, this was something the Mob is used to. 
"Throughout the season we've been able to play with both quarterbacks," Conley said. "Our team has not been quarterback-based, and we know they can both run the offense effectively." 
After the switch, the teams traded possessions for the remainder of the first half. 
But Nagle said he noticed optimism in his team at half­time. 
"There was a feeling of con­fidence on the sideline at half; however we knew we had to keep up the intensity to come

Sorin 24, Carroll 0 

Sorin kept its slim playoff hopes alive Sunday with a 24-0 victory over Carroll. 
The Otters, now 1-2, need a win Wednesday night against Zahm and help from several other teams in order to reach the playoffs. 
"We had our backs against the wall and we came out with a real sense of urgency," Sorin captain Hyan Bove said. "We had no turnovers or penalties, and that had been killing us this season." 
Against the Vermin, Sorin relied on a power running attack led by sophomore Joe Vittoria, who had 13 carries for 57 yards, and sophomore Rob Gallic, who had 7 5 yards on 8 rushes. 
Bove credited the successful rushing attack to great play by the offensive line.

Siegfried beats St. Ed's as Green Wave sweeps Juggerknotts away 
By JARED )EDICK, SAM WERNER, MIKE GOTIMER and MATT GAMBER Sports Writers 
In its l'irst three games, all victories, St. Ed's did not allow freshman quarterback Matt /\boling to be sacked once. 
That streak is over. 

i\beling was sacked three times and hurried phmty of oth­ers in a 1:~-12 loss to Siegfried Sunday. 
"We knew they were going to como out throwing. so we just wont after them hard all day," said senior defensive lineman Tom Martin, who recorded a pair of sacks for the Hamblers. "We hadn't gotten as much prnssure up front as we would have liked the last few games, but today we got the job done." 
Juniors Tom Scrace, who claimed the other Siegfried sack, and Tom Owens, who intereepted an errant /\boling throw, led a defense that shut down a St. Ed's oiTense that had looked dominant the past three wenks. 
Ramblin' men 
"We're really happy with our dnftmse," Martin said. "We gave up a couple of big plays, but that's all they got. We held them in pretty much all day." 
The defensive effort, com­bined with the dock-controlling running of junior Mare us Young (14 carries, 70 yards) and a pair of touehdown eatches from senior Kevin Kelly. gave the Stndsmnn all they could handle. 
"Thoy're smaller than us, and we felt like we could beat them up and just run it down their throats," Young said. "They only had a few guys in the box, so that's what we stuck to all day." 
The Hamblers established their efficient passing game early, as freshman quarterback Mike Garda hit Kelly for a 43­yard completion on Siegfried's second play from scrimmage. Four plays later, freshman full­back Dan Scime took an outside toss then dropped back and threw a strike to Kelly for an 11-yard touchdown. 
After a St. Ed's punt pinned the Hamblers back at their own 5-yard line, Siegfried went three-and-out. A mishandled snap on the punt attempt allowed St. Ed's to block the punt, and Stedsmen junior

Squad prepares to face vvinless Tri-State 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's looks to move above .500 in the MIAA today when the Belles head to Angola, Ind., to play last-place Tri-State. 
Saint Mary's (6-3-4, 2-2-2 MIAA) is in fifth place, while Tri-State (0-12-2, 0-5) is look­ing for its first victory of the season. 
"Tri-State has had a very dif­ficult season." Belles coach Caryn MacKenzie said. "They have no wins in our conference and have been outscored by their opponents significantly." 
Saint Mary's is coming ofT a 2-0 loss Saturday to first-place Calvin, in which the Belles had only three shots. That total was their second lowest of the sea­son. 
Against Calvin. the Belles struggled in front of the goal, one of their major problems this season. But MacKenzie said her team is better than it showed on Saturday 
"[Our goal is to) start the game on the whistle tomorrow, not after our opponents sccm~s on us in the first two minutes," MacKenzie said. "We must be prepared to play at a high level from the outset."
