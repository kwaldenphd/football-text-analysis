NCATE 
to rate 

ND-SMC 

By Ann Therese Darin One week from today the National Coucnil for Accredita­tion of Teacher Education will 
begin  a  comprehensive  evalua­ 
tion  of  St.  Mary's  and  Notre  
Dame.  

This evaluation, according Dr. Eugene A Campanale, newly ap­pointed chairman of St. Mary's education department, may re­sult in a ten-year unqualified teaching accreditation for Notre Dame. St. Mary's may also profit from the critique of the IO-man NCATE team by receiving a ten­year unqualified accreditation for its secondary education de­partment. 
"Notre Dame is not accre­

dited now, " revealed Dr. Cam­panale. "Although over 200 Notre Dame students come to take classes at St. Mary's in the education department which is 'accredited, they take the rest of their requirements for a degree 
at Notre Dame which has not 
yet been accredited," he said. 
SMC merited initial NCATE accreditation in 1958. At this time, the elementary education program received and "un­qualified recommendation" for 10 years. The secondary educa­tion department, however, only received a three-year accredita­tion pending further working re.­lationship of the coexchange program. 
Since the NCATE team last evaluated the educational system here, Dr. Campanale and his department have worked to rec­tify the problems. For example, at the time of the last evalua­tion, there was no record kept of the Notre Dame students major­ing in education at St. Mary's. Today, not only are records maintained in the SMC office of education, but Dr. Campanale also made sure that both Notre Dame and St. Mary's students receive equal treatment in the department by having the same requirements. 
Another problem present when the team last evaluated the department was the counseling 
program for education majors·. In the past, the Notre Dame student had no advisor from the St. Mary's education depart­ment. "Now we have 5 advisors to counsel 650 plus students," disclosed Dr. Campanale. "I feel that this is one of our principal jobs." 
When the NCATE educators come in two weeks, they will be presented with a 438 page report of education on this campus. The result of a summer vacation or' work by Dr. Campanale and his staff, the report is an in­depth analysis of the Institute of Education at St. Mary's and

Niemeyer: future politics 

By Bro. Jim Snedlock 

International political rela­tions in a world beyond commu­nism was the topic of Professor Gerhart Niemeyer's lecture in the library Auditorium last Thurs­day night. Dr. Niemeyer, at Notre Dame since 1955, presented his lecture from an article to be published in December. by Pacific Community a Japanese-based publication. 
The lecture centered on how 
international relations will go in a post-Communist world. The decline and end of Communism as an ideology, the development of four industrial world centers and the development of a politi­cal order based on East-West 
cultures were future develop­ments forseen by Dr. Niemeyer. The idea of political order, he said, would develop from cul­tures containing the principles of 
contemplation and meditation, and the nature of man's being in rel<>tion to other men. 
Dr. Neimeyer said Commu­nism was based on the historical view that man's destiny is a classless society. This is the motivation of Communism to­day, Niemeyer said. This motiva­tion is propounded with devo­tion and toleration, even the toleration of the inadequacies of the Communist Party. 
Communist expansion is centered on ideology and not in boundary or territorial acquisi­tions, said Dr. Niemeyer. Expan~on by Communism proceeds by the domination of peoples with complete allegiance to the Com­munist Party. Dr. Niemeyer pointed out that the primary aim of Communism in countries like Korea and South Vietnam is control of the government machinery. This, he said, is necessary to coerce the people toward Party allegiance.

Notre Dame. This Institute, "a unique conglomerate of cognate educational enterprises of the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College," includes the Office for Educational Research, the Counseling Center, the Of­fice of Teacher Preparation, St. Mary's department of education, and the department of graduate studies in education. 
The report also outlines the evaluators' major areas of inter­est: the placement of qualified faculty in their particular fields, the quality of students in the department, and an evaluation of the physical plants of both schools. 
Besides listing the Institute of Education as it exists today, the study also forecasts some long and short term objectives for the teacher education program. 
These goals include: (1) the use of teaching assistants from Notre Dame by the St. Mary's College education faculty, (2) an increased two-way exchange of faculty between the graduate de­partment of Notre Dame and the undergraduate department of St. Mary's and (3) counseling of students by the entire staff rather than by one or two indi­viduals. 
Other stated objectives in­clude the participation of staff members in the supervision of

student teachers and the intro­duction of a Montessori class for students to acquaint them with the Montessori approach. 
The report is also signifi­cant as a predictor of the future of the two institutions. "There is rapidly taking place a union, not a merger, of the two institu­tions," the report states. Ac­cording to the report, the SMC education department has suc­cessfully fused with Notre Dame's department to become a genuine asset to the university community. 
"Given the resources of a na­tional university like Notre Dame and a prestigious women's college like St. Mary's College, we arc convinced that we can assist importantly in meeting the educational challenges of the seventies with our innovative structure," the report read. 
"Even as the basic St. Mary's­Notre Dame relationship is itself innovative, distinctive, and 
mutually  enriching,  so  is  the  
Institute  a  structure  which  
unites  the  educational  enter­ 

prises of the two institutions," continued the text. "Granted that there are aspects of our institutional structure which are bold departures from the ac­cepted, we deliberately want to -break out of the patterns of the past to better prepare our young people to assume the serious responsibility for the quality of 
human life." 

By receiving NCATE accredi­tation, a student who graduates from the St. Mary's department of education will automatically receive certification in at least 28 states. Many other states, according to Dr. Campanale, will also recognize the accreditation, but not officially. 
One other NCATE advantage is that it provides students with the opportunity of working for a teaching license while in Indiana. 
Although this is Dr. Cam­panale's first major task as chair­1aan of the St. Mary's education department, he is no stranger to the campus educational system. He received his B.A. and M.A. from Notre Dame and was formerly dean of the graduate department of education at St. Mary's ( 1965) and worked in Notre Dame's Office for Educa­tional Research ( 1968) and Of­fice of Teacher Preparation. 
Last year, he participated in one of the NCATE evaluations of Fordham University, New York, in preparation for up­coming evaluation of Notre Dame.

The trouble with beating Navy IS 
by Terry Shields 
Observer Sports Editor 
Last Thursday, Notre Dame's right guard Gary Kos explained the problem that a nationally ranked team like Notre Dame faces when it plays a once victor­ious team like the Naval Academy. "I really hate to play in one of these games. There is nothing you can do to impress people. If you win big then they say you're piling on the score and if it's close then some may say that we don't have that much." 
On Saturday Kos and his teammates took the first approach to the problem and the undefeated Irish pummeled the Navy by the convincing score of 56-7. It was a typical ND rout. The statistics were totally dominated by the Domers and the second team once again saw as ~uch action as the first. 
Irish Score First 

The contest was enjoyable for a neutral football for only one quarter then only Irish eyes could be found smiling. The Irish took the opening kickoff and marched relentlessly for 80 yards and a touchdown. Joe Theismann, who put on another brilliant dispaly of how to play quarterback, threw only one pass in this drive and that was a 17 yard beauty to Tom Gate­wood, the nation's leading re­ceiver going into the contest. 
Darryll Dewan, substituting for a shaken-up Ed Gulyas, carried six times in the drive for over 30 yarrfs including a three yard burst for the touchdown. 
Navy surprisir.gly came right back and caught ~he vaunted Notre Dame defense napping. Middie qb Ade Dillon fired two passes to end Clul Schwelm for a total of 57 yards and this set up the five yard keeper play by which the Midshipmen scored. 
Gatewood Nears Record 
The score remained knotted at seven for the remainder of the period and then the Irish broke loose for their most productive stanza of the season. Taking 
advantage of good field position ND marched over the Navy goal line four times. Bill Barz, who didn't have a particularly good day, managed two dirt dives and Theismann found the "Swinging Gate" (Gatewood) with two six­point passes. The second brings the junior receiver close to Jim Seymour for most TD passes caught in a career (16), Gate­wood has 15. 
The first team sat out the final three minutes of the half and returned to action for one final drive in the third quarter. Denny Allan completed the 75 back, who was the leading rusher of the afternoon with 133 yards

Pat Steenberge led the hungry shocktroops in quite a few drives but most of these drives faded without any results on the score­board. John "Cisco" Cieszkow­ski did dent the score sheet and probably a few Navy Helmets on a 30 yard sprint without any zigs or zags, just straight through the Navy team. 
Bob Minnix scampered his right end from five yards away to close the scoring for ND late in the game. 
Hempel 8 for 8 

Scott ~mpel kept kicking away at the record books as he booted 8 successful placements. 
After the game both coaches had praise for the man that usually wins praise, Joe Theis­
mann. The Roadrunner had 1700 folks down from his home town of South River, N.J. to cheer him on and he obligefl by completing ten of 13 passes for 161 yards plus ground gains of 49 yards in only six attempts. Joe has completed 80 'of .126 passes for a phenomenal 63.5%. Rick Forzano, Navy coach, said that if "there was any team better than Notre Dame he would have to see them." He also said that any great team "has to have that one super 
player that makes it go. It's obvious that on this awesome Notre Dame team Theismann is the man that does this. 
Irish coach Parseghian agreed whole-heartedly as he praised Theismann and Gatewood again as if it were a reconfing of previous post-game conferences. Ara would not commit himself on questions concerning bowl activity for his third ranked ball club. "We still have four impor­tant games left. If we get through those alright then we'll start thinking bowl." 
Defense Outstanding 
The defense once again played an outstanding game, that first drive by Navy notwithstanding. In particular, linebackers Rich Thomann, Jim Wright, and Tim Kelly along with defensive back Ralph Stepaniak were all very sharp for this game. 
Next on the menu,...er, ah schedule for Parseghian's crew is the University of Pittsburgh. The Panthers, who were ranked first in the East, were dropped back to earth by Syracuse, 43-13. This means that the Irish will have to win that much bigger to impress the pollsters. Bets from this desk say they should do that with no problem.

Although the fourth period was less than a minute old at this point, Tennes­see still appeared to have a com­fortable lead. But moments later, when the Irish defense forced the Vols to punt from midfield, the jinx which had seen Tennessee drop two pre­vious decisions to late-game rallies became a reality. 
Starting from his 'own seven, Brown hit Gary Diminick with successive passes, the second of which moved the ball to the 46. Again aided' by ·an interference penalty, Notre Dame advanced to the Vol 11. John Dwyer struggled to the six, and Dimi­nick threaded his way into the end zone on the next play. Brown's kick made it 20-14. Tennessee was unable to gener­ate any type of offense, and with less than five minutes re­maining, again punted to the Irish. Brown, who seems most effective in comeback situations, set the ND attack in motion. Faced with fourth down from his own 40, the Notre Dame quarterback chose to go --to. Algery Frazier for the crucial yardage. Frazier, who was the leading reciever of the game with six catches for 92 yards, took Brown's pass and was downed at the Tennessee 28. The play covered 3 2 yards. Brown ran the keeper to the 20, and with slightly more than two minutes remaining, Dunn dove for first down yardage at the 17. On the following play, Dunn sprinted into the end zone and broke for the left flag. Brown's pass was perfect, and Dunn's reception tied the score at 20-20. The kick 
·was good, and with 2:07 remain­ing, Notre Dame led 21-20. The Vols mounted a desperation drive, but a sparkling defensive effort by cornerback Mike Townsend, and an interception by guard Gary Potempa on the last play of the game wrapped up the win for the Irish frosh. 
For Tennessee, it was an un­believable and disheartening way to lose. But for Notre Dame, this game was a tonic, and will give them new life when they face the Michigan yearlings next
