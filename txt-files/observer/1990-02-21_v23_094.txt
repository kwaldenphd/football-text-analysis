Leftist demonstrators clash with riot police during a rally outside the gates of Clark Air Force Base at this city, 50 miles north of Manila Monday. Scores were hurt during the clash which happened on the eve of U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney's tour of the U.S. facility. Story on Cheney's Asian trip, page 3. 
EAST BERLIN (AP) -East German Premier Hans Modrow, pressed by mass emigration and a crumbling economy, ap­pealed Tuesday for immediate reunification talks under a formula worked out with the Allied victors of World War II. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the West German chancellor, urged Modrow's government to create a social security system as generous as West Germany's as a means of stopping the flight. 
More than 400,000 people have left the East for West Germany in the past year, most of them skilled workers, after giving up hope of significant 
Seven drown in icy rescue effort 
MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. (APJ -Boats and helicopters crisscrossed Convict Lake on Tuesday, searching for the bodies of three teen-agers and four would-be rescuers who fell through thin ice during an out­ing for a group of young of­fenders. 
Some of the victims struggled to stay afloat in the icy water for 15 minutes before disap­pearing Monday, witnesses said. 
"We could see them bobbing around," said volunteer fire­fighter Jim Lambert. One pleaded, "Throw me a rope!" but they were too far from shore. 
The hole they fell through froze over within hours. Divers recovered the body of 
U.S. Forest Service ranger Clayton Cutter, 31, on Tuesday, said Mono County sheriff's spokeswoman Gail Merritt. 
Two divers at a time, able to withstand the 32-degree water for only 1 0-minute spans, were dropped from helicopters into the water where the victims were last seen. Marker buoys bobbed near holes in the ice on the remote lake on the east side of the Sierra Nevada. 
Although sunny, the tempera­irnprovernent in living condi­tions at horne. 
Kohl met with West German industrial leaders Tuesday to draft plans for "solidarity with East Germany," and told jour­nalists his government would help finance unemployment benefits and pensions for East Germans. 
He was vague about the de­gree to which West Germany would underwrite the costs of East Germany's transition to capitalism, however, saying only that Bonn could provide "start-up financing" for the benefits. 
His references to German

ture was near zero when the recovery operation began. Cut­ter's friends stood on shore as divers pulled his body, the first to be found, out of the water 200 yards away. 
"We go ice skating out there all the time. It's gonna be hard to go out there now," said fel­low ranger Rick Misner. 
The recovery could be ham­pered because in the extreme cold the bodies may sink to the bottom of Convict Lake, which is 140 feet deep at its deepest point, said Mono County Sher­iff-Coroner M.A. Strelneck. 
The 30-member recovery team included divers from Washoe County, Nev., military personnel and helicopters from "social unity" reflected a growing realization among West Germans that they must pay for reunification. Kohl's government has been reluetant to make firm deals with Mod­row, a reform-minded Com­munist whose interim Cabinet will govern only until free elec­tions March 18. 
East Germany's parliament passed a constitutional amendment and legislation Tuesday setting rules for the elections. 
The new parliament will have 400 seats, 100 fewer than the current People's Chamber, and no minimum percentage of the 
hina Lake and Sacramento, and an air boat able to travel on ice from the Truckee Fire Department. 
The teen-age boys, aged 13 to 15, from nearby Camp O'Neal for youthful offenders were part of a group on an outing when they fell through thin ice around noon Monday, Strelneck said. Most of the group had stayed on land. 
"It was horrifying," said Pierre LaBossiere, a reporter for the Mono County Review Herald who watched three of the rescuers go into the water. 
The youths were playing or walking on the ice about 200 yards from shore when the sur­face gave way. Arriving soon after the boys fell through, La­Bossiere said he saw one youth bobbing on the surface in an ice hole. 
As he and dozens of others on shore watched helplessly, two other adult rescuers plunged into the lake in failed attempts to reach the teen-ager still floundering in the icy water. 
The accident happened in the center of the lake, which is a mile long and a quarter-mile wide, said Forest Service

Bush lauds Havel, stays firm on arms 
WASHINGTON (API -Presi­dent Bush gave investment and trade rewards to Czechoslo­vakia Tuesday for overthrowing communist rule but told President Vaclav Havel the United States wouldn't retreat from a precautionary "strong military presence" in Europe. 
Bush gave a warm welcome to the first of Eastern Europe's new reform leaders to visit the White House. 
He called Havel, a onetime dissident playwright who went from prison to the presidency in a year's time, "a man of tremendous moral courage, one of the heroes of the revolution of '89." 
The two leaders talked for 2 1/2 hours, in the Oval Office and over lunch. 
Afterward, Havel said the talks had been "very warm, very open, very friendly," and he invited Bush to visit Prague.

HPC unanimously redistricts Senate 
By PATRICK HEALY 
News Writer 
The Hall Presidents Council in Tuesday's meeting unanimously approved a resolution which will redistrict the Student Senate by quad. 
The resolution, which was passed unanimously by the Senate on Monday, estab­lished the new districts ac­cording to the location of dorms on the different quads around campus. The first district contains Alumni, Badin, Carroll, Dillon, Fisher, Howard, Lyons, Morrissey, and Pangborn; the second district is Lewis, Old College, 
Sorin,  St.  Edward's, and  
Walsh.  
On  the  east  side  of  

campus, the third district will include Breen-Phillips, Cavanaugh, Farley, Keenan, Stanford, and Zahm; the fourth, Grace, Planner, Knott, Pasquerillas East and West, and Siegfried. Off­campus constitutes the fifth district the Jackson-Vanik amendment that restricts trade relations with communist nations that inhibit Jewish emigration. 
The waiver clears the way for negotiation of a trade agree­ment and the eventual award of most-favored nation trading status, which would provide Czechoslovakia the most liberal access possible to American markets. In return, the Czechoslovak Parliament would have to enact a law ending the former communist govern­ment's restrictive emigration policies. 
Bush also authorized the Ex­port-Import Bank to operate in Prague and said he would sup­port readmission of Czechoslo­vakia to the International Mon­etary Fund and World Bank. Bush authorized sending Peace Corps volunteers to Czechoslo­

devastation I 
experienced the next day. 
Marcy Mitchell showed up with a Straw­berry Shortcake lunchbox and a matching vinyl lunch mat. Another fad had passed me by, and I never really caught up. I'm a slave to fashion. 
Puberty for me was a painful blur of strange fashion crazes. I bought the (Official) Preppie Handbook and mono­grammed my socks. I wore miniskirts and said, "Oh my God, fer sure," like Moon Unit Zappa. I saw "Flashdance" twice and wore sweatshirts with missing shoulders. 
Oh, sure. I took a stand -I refused to wear lime while everyone else was having a neon phase. I only bought one pair of knick­ers. I honestly thought the way Madonna wore her underwear outside her clothes was tacky. But deep down, I secretly wanted to be an arbiter of fashion, even if it meant compromising my values and wearing striped leg-warmers. 
I guess the guys had it worse, though. They had to wear parachute pants and learn to moonwalk. 
My best friend and I had "friendship" everything. To prove our undying loyalty to each other, we bought matching rings, matching earrings and those little charms that look like a heart broken in half and say "BE--FHJ-" on one and "-ST -ENDS" on the other. And remember all those beaded safety pins everyone had? The more you had, the more incrPdibly popular you were. I could swear Marcy Mitdwll cheated and made some herself. 
A lady I work with informed me that you never outgrow fads. They haunt you. even in adulthood. She decorated her entire home aecording to the latest craze, never dream­ing that appliances in a dull shade of avo­cado would go out of style. And how many times have your parents had late-night, rowdy Trivial Pursuit parties? They don't really enjoy it; it's pure fad. They have peer pressure, too. 
I'm learning to live with my disease. I go to bimonthly meetings, where I stand up in front of strangers and say, "My name is Paige X. and I am a faddist." 
Their voices swell reassuringly, "We love you, Paige!" 
llaltingly, I begin my testimony: ''I'm a wreck. I don't know what to do about my manicure... 'Vogue' says I should file square, but 'Elle' says oval is in." 
That's not even the worst part. Last week I saw Marcy Mitchell. She had "Alf' decals on her nails.

Financial Aid Office warns of false funds 
By JANICE O'LEARY Assistant News Editor 
The Financial Aid office at Notre Dame would like the student body to be aware of some recent developments in the case of a possible schol­arship fraud. 
In mid-November, students on campus received a letter from a scholarship search service that goes by the title of either the Academic Coun­cil on Financial Assistance or the National Scholarship Resources Administration, Inc. 
The letter claimed that it could provide sources of potential scholarship money of up to $300 if the student would send $50. 
Unfortunately, some stu­dents have submitted the money and have received no response to date. 
"To my knowledge, no stu­dent has yet to receive a dime." stated Joe Husso, di­rector of Financial Aid. 
He also said that a large number of institutions have received the same letter or a variation of it. including Ball State and Western Michigan University. Some of the let­ters have changed the dead­line for the submission of the fee, and the amount has been raised to $60. 
The post office and Fed­eral Trade Commission have become involved in the in­vestigation of the scholar­ship organization. 
The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administration (NASFAA) has been bombarded with calls concerning the legiti­macy of the Academic Coun­cil on Financial Assistance, said Russo. 
According to a recent NASFAA newsletter, the post office has "filed suit against 
this organization for  false  
representation.  No  
judicial  order  has  been  
issued," however.  
Russo  stressed  that  

anyone "who has invested $50 and is still waiting to hear should provide their name to the Notre Dame security department." 
'Til be so shocked if some­one comes in with $300 as a result of this organization," he said.

Cheney seeks 'sizable increase' in funding from Japan for U.S. troops stationed there 
TOKYO (AP) -Defense Sec­retary Dick Cheney arrived Tuesday from the Philippines seeking what the United States hopes will be a "sizable in­crease" in Japan's $2.4 billion annual support for American troops stationed here. 
Cheney's visit came as Philip­pine President Corazon Aquino signaled a willingness to work out differences over U.S. bases there, despite her refusal to meet with Cheney during his stay in Manila the previous three days. 
The defense secretary had a warmer reception in Tokyo. 
"The Japanese are very un­derstanding and are very will­ing to help us as much as they can," said a senior Pentagon official traveling with Cheney. 
And even though it was known that Cheney intended to explore with Japanese officials possible 10 percent to 12 per­cent cuts in U.S. troop levels in

Asia, Japanese government spokesman Taizo Watanabe said officials were not worried by such a development. 
The positive tone set by both sides at the opening of Cheney's visit was in marked contrast to the scenes he has encountered at the other major stops on his two-week Asian tour. 
In Manila, the defense secre­tary was burned in effigy by demonstrators who protested 
U.S. military bases in their country. In Seoul, Cheney met with South Korean officials who were described as "horrified" by his cost-cutting messages and projections of possible troop reductions. 
Despite the coolness of his Manila stopover, Aquino said Tuesday, "I welcome the state­ment of support for this gov­ernment and Philippine democ­racy made by Secretary Cheney on behalf of the United States. 
"I also welcome his reitera-

tion that the United States will make its best efforts to meet its pledge for foreign assistance," she said, referring to a $96 million reduction in money for the use of six military bases this year. 
The military sessions in Tokyo appear free of the tense wrangling that scars the two nations' economic relations, given that the United States looks to Japan as the anchor of its Asian military strategy, and the Japanese prosper under the protective U.S. military wing. 
"The Japanese are the linch­pin of our military strategy in Asia," the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "They're very sup­portive of our presence." 
Cheney was expected to tell the Japanese what he already has told the South Koreans ­that he is under congressional pressure to get them to double over the next three years their financial support for basing 
U.S. troops in their countries. 
The official traveling with Ch­eney said the defense secretary did not intend to press the Japanese to put forward an ex­act amount at this juncture. Each year, the Japanese pro­vide around $2.4 billion of the $7 billion it costs America to base the 50,000 troops here and in Okinawa. 
"We do not have any num­bers.... We're confident they understand our requirements," the official said, adding, "We're hopeful that over the years we'll see a sizable increase in Japanese support for U.S. forces here." 
The U.S. official said Wash­ington had received indications of such increased support from Japanese officials during pre­liminary talks leading up to the Cheney visit. 
Pentagon sources have said they are studying plans by which at least 10,000 to 12,000 troops could be withdrawn from the 120,000 based in the Pacific Rim nations. That would mean a reduction of 5,000 troops in Japan. 
The study is part of a re­assessment of the U.S. military role in the Pacific that Cheney must send to Capitol Hill by April 1. Some lawmakers are demanding cuts in overseas forces in light of reduced su­perpower tensions.

Speaker foresees autonomy for Lithuania 
By BETSY PUNSALAN 
News Writer 
Nothing less than indepen­dence is acceptable to Lithuani­ans, said Victor Nakas, Branch Manager of the Lithuanian In­formation Center in Washing­ton, D.C., in a lecture Tuesday. 
Nakas' lecture, "Lithuania: Is Independence Possible?". was part of a series titled "Democracy in Eastern Europe Week" sponsored by Student Government. 
"For Lithuanians, the issue is not one of establishing inde­pendence, but rather of restor­ing il," Nakas said, noting that the country has been plagued intermittently with Soviet occu­pation since the eighteenth cen­tury. "It is not secession that is called for, but for the with­drawal of an illegitimate mili­tary and political force." 
The current revolution in Eastern Europe has heightened Lithuania's urgency towards democracy, but Nakas pointed out that the Lithuanians first showed the Germans and the Czechs the impact that peaceful mass demonstrations could have. "[Lithuania) was the mentor, not the pupil." 
Nakas stressed two main

reasons why Lithuanians aspire to democracy. First, "they see daily reminders that their cen­tralized economic system is a miserable failure," Nakas said. "Lithuania retains a living col­lective memory among its older citizens of the independent, market oriented, pre-Commu­nist period which feeds the con­viction that there is a viable al­ternative to the current Soviet system." 
Second, Nakas stated that "by far, the most important component is the overwhelming sense among the people of Lithuania that the political and economic system that they de­sire to throw over was imposed upon them by a foreign power." 
Soviet President Mikhail Gor­bachev and the Lithuanian peo­ple have different understand­ings of perestroika, Nakas said. Gorbachev introduced the concept as "a series of cen­trally directed political reforms designed to make the economic system of the Communists work." 
In contrast, perestroika in Lithuania "has evolved into a grass roots movement designed to bury what is perceived among Lithuanians to be the 
of NATO, along with the War­saw Pact, the Soviet-led alliance to which Czechoslovakia be­longs. 
In his public comments, Bush said. "I know I can speak for all Western leaders when I say that the Atlantic Alliance will continue to play a vital role in assuring stability and security in Europe at this great and his­toric moment. 
Bush said NATO perhaps should have a broader role than at present.

corpse of communism and in its place to resurrect an indepen­dent nation-state," he said. 
Lithuania's economic inde­pendence from the Soviet Union would be difficult, but not im­possible, Nakas stated. While Lithuanians desire to be "masters of their own destiny, politically and economically," they will remain linked to the Soviet economy for some time. 
Lithuania's Supreme Soviet election on February 24 will in­volve two main parties: the Sajudis independence movement and the Lithuanian Communist party. Nakas predicted a Sajudis majority, noting that "a Sajudis victory in the February elections will guarantee imple­mentation of concrete parlia­mentary measures laying the basis for independence." 
"It is reasonable to expect a formal decision by Lithuania's parliament before summer re­asserting the country's political independence." 
Lithuania is a small country northeast of Poland and is the largest of the three Baltic states.

As of the end of this semester Holy Cross Hall will no longer house male Notre Dame stu­dents as it will officially close its doors after more than one hundred years. 
According to William Kirk, rector of Holy Cross, the hall currently houses 200 students out of a maximum occupancy of 
212. After the closing of the dorm was announced at the end of last year, the Office of Stu­dent Residences decided not to house freshmen in the dorm this year. 
Kirk said the residents, "have known about it for a while and are taking it pretty well. The Housing Office has done a good job at finding a wide range of spots for them."

The "Hogs" of Holy Cross will be transferred into open spaces in almost every male dorm on campus. Father Gerald Lard­ner, rector of Grace Hall, has allotted the greatest number of spaces for the transfers. Forty residents will be placed in sec­tions of two floors in Grace. Kirk said this will help keep some of the old Holy Cross sec­tions intact. Other dorms will be able to let roommates stay together in their old arrange­ments. 
Kirk said, "Holy Cross had been scheduled for closing in years past but a housing crunch on campus kept it open for a few more years." Kirk suggested that there are sev­eral causes for the closing of the hall. 
One reason for the closing is that it will help the effort to 
States --are Marga Clark, Benedict Fernandez, Marco Kalisch, Adal Alberto Maldon­ado, George Malave, Becky Mayer, Tony Mendoza, Marcelo Montecino, Emilio Rodriguez-Vasquez, Geno Rodriquez, Se­bastiao Salgado Jr., Ricardo Sanchez and Andres Serrano. Their works represent the vari­ety of ideas and imagery pro­duced by contemporary His­panic photographers. 
The exhibition reveals the high caliber of the artists and their broad range of tech­niques, viewpoints and subject matter. Some work as photo­journalists, portraying contem­porary society with documen­tary realism. Others create even the ratio of male to female students on campus since ad­missions of women have in­creased greatly in the past few years. 
Another reason Kirk offered was that the property itself is not owned by the University. It is the property of the Holy Cross Brothers. 
Plans for using the dorm for alternate uses are "still up in the air" according to Kirk. The building itself is also very old and is deteriorating both inside and out. The cost of these re­pairs would be too great, ac­cording to Kirk. 
After the Easter Holiday the Holy Cross Hall Council will hold a "Hog Week" to celebrate the history of the hall. There will be dances and activities in celebration of the dorm's last year.

An illustrated 76-page, bilin­gual catalogue is currently in publication and will be avail­able from the museum shop for $9.95. A full-color poster will also be available. 
In conjunction with the ex­hibit, South Bend photographer and teacher Steve Moriarty will present a noon talk on the thir­teen Hispanic photographers March 27 in O'Shaughnessy Galleries. The public is invited. The exhibition is made possi­ble by a grant from American Express Co. The American Ex­

Many of the republics of the Soviet Union which border other countries have ethnic cul­tures so different from the Hussians that inborn animosity is bound to exist. Hepublics on the southern border of the So­viet Union have large Muslim

As a history freak, I may be the sole reader of the Observer who turns to the "Almanac" feature before perusing any­thing else in the paper. The February 15 "Almanac" moves me to compliment its editor, both for a fine sense of historical ambiguity and a nice way with words.

Irresponsible solutions only hinder movement to end apartheid 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the column written by Mr. Paul Peralez in the Feb. 8 Observer entitled "U.S. Racism Condones Apartheid." This column, under the guise of "Free South Africa," is solely an assault on the United States and objective persons. Mr. Peralez's attempt at criticism falls short of its goal. Moreover. the movements designed to end apartheid can only be hampered by this irre­sponsible and biased column. I have divided the column into three main parts: The attack on the United States, Post­apartheid South Africa, and remarks which are outrageous. 
Mr. Peralez attacks the United States and its lack of effective response to the problem of apartheid. The result is not only ~ a scathing commentary, but also empty rhetoric. Peralez asks, "Why didn't Ronald Reagan invade South Africa in defense of freedom just as readily as he invaded Grenada in defense of the same? Why doesn't George Bush provide arms for the South African re­sistance as readily as he de­ployed soldiers to overthrow a dictator in Panama?" The an­swers to these questions are, of course, painfully obvious to Mr. Peralez-The United States is racist. 
Fortunately, a better answer, is found only two paragraphs later. Mr. Peralez states that, "I truly do not advocate the use of violence to overthrow the racist, theologically heretical regime.... " Violence is not the panacea for all the world's problems. Thus, the questions are irrelevant to the topic of apartheid. They only serve to attack the U.S. Perhaps, Mr. Peralez intended to raise our collective conscience and when we were enlightened, South Africa's problems would vanish. 
Mr. Peralez also paints a pic­ture of post-apartheid South Africa which is somewhat dis­turbing. His new government will be "black" and black only. Is not his proposed new gov­ernment the same as the first? The only difference is now any atrocity against an individual's humanity will be committed by blacks. It seems that the poten­tial democracy, which he uses to describe post-apartheid rule is no longer a democracy but a system similar to apartheid with the roles reversed. Imagine this new government, the twenty six million blacks will rule with absolutely. no re­sponsibility to the five million whites. Great democracy. 


Lastly, certain statements made in the column were un­believable. The one major statement reads as follows: "Indeed, there aren't enough white people to kill to make up for the hundreds of thousands of black men, women, and chil­dren who have been slaugh­tered." Here, the potential deaths of five million white men, women, and children are meaningless. It seems as though Mr. Peralez implies that the hundreds of thousands of black lives outweigh the five million white lives. Any discus­sion with equality at its center does not come down to this ab­surd comparison. 

I do not claim to have all the answers, or even some of them. I do not know what should be done about South Africa. What I do know is that apartheid is an atrocity and the problem should be fixed. A new government needs to be formed: a govern­ment in which the people, black and white, will rule. Nothing is accomplished by vehemently preaching sensationalism. Perhaps, the first step is for people, regardless of color, to view the situation objectively. 
H. R. Schmitt 
Dillon Hall Feb. 8, 1990 

Complete divestment allows South African government to increase its power 
Dear Editor: 
The hypotheses made by Paul Peralez in his Feb. 8 column,"U.S. Racism Condones Apartheid," should be discount­ed for three reasons: 1.) Mr. Peralez made a number of mis­takes concerning logic, 2.) Mr. Peralez ignored the ·use of eco­nomic analysis, and 3.) Mr. Peralez neglected the value of a 
U.S. presence in South Africa. 
Mr. Peralez admitted his re­marks were "abusive" but clari­fied his position by stating, "I truly do not advocate the use of violence to overthrow (South Africa)." Yet, in the same breath, Mr. Peralez said he did not advocate violence because "there aren't enough white peo­ple to kill to make up for the hundreds of thousands of black men, women, and children who have been slaughtered." This reasoning could only lead the reader to believe that if there were enough white people, he would fully support wholesale murder of all whites. With this, Mr. Peralez charged that two wrongs make a right. 
The author also wrote that 
the black leadership of South Africa should delete the word "white" and replace it with the word "black" when they revise their constitution. His line of reasoning dictates that black South Africans should institute a regime equally as oppressive and racist as that already in place. He wants South African blacks to become the exact thing which they fight to over­throw: racists. Mr. Peralez' words show he is guilty of the same crimes with which he charged the United States: racism and the use of violence in defense of freedom. 
In addition to the above er­rors in logic, Mr. Peralez charged that U.S. policy con­cerning South Africa was based totally upon white racism. In­deed, he stated, "Only when white people have something to lose does the United States be­come conscious of its commit­ment to freedom ..." 
Perhaps there are some racists at the policy making level, but U.S. foreign policy is not based upon racism alone. Such a generalization is analo­gous to the charge that fresh­men aren't smart enough to have opinions. Some are, some are not. Mr. Peralez simply does not know, or he has not made an effort to gather all of the fac­tors which concern this policy decision. His views represent poor logic and a fanatical approach to problem solving which must be discounted for the lack of rational thought they show. 
In an effort to show Mr. Peralez what some of the "liar(s) and fool(s)" in Wash­ington might have considered before making a policy decision, I would like to look at the eco­nomic side of sanctions. South Africa controls its own mineral reserves and many of those in surrounding countries. It con­trols 86 percent of the platinum reserves and 40 percent of the world's gold. Both of these are vital to our nation's defense and technology industries. 
In addition, over 80 percent of the world's chrome and 48 percent of the world's man­ganese-both essential in the steel-making process-are con­trolled by South Africa. Neither of these minerals are found in the U.S., and the second great­est world supplier is the Soviet Union. Perhaps we might hope to increase trade with the So­viet Union, but would Mr. Peralez like us to get these two important minerals from an­other well-known violator of human rights? I think not. In light of these facts, it can be said that there is a little more going into policy decisions than Mr. Peralez' charge of white racism. Economic analysis is not a tool for "liar(s) and fool(s)" therefore to be ignored, as Mr. Peralez insinuated, but a tool for people who which to make informed decisions. 

Finally, Mr. Peralez ignored the value of a U.S. presence in South Africa. Economic sanc­tions call for all U.S. companies to cease business with South Africa. If a company were to do this, the owners would have to unload their factory and all other goods. Since few people wish to venture into South Africa, the going price for a fac­tory would be much lower than usual. South African en­trepreneurs would have the chance to snap up some of the means of production (already at a low cost) with a currency that has little value outside its own nation. 
If all foreigners were to pack up and leave, this would hand the South African government a dandy opportunity to consoli­date all ownership in the hands of the ruling minority. With this, the U.S. would lose any direct chance of making life better for blacks in South Africa because it would lack the foundation from which to launch any kind of initiative. With a U.S. indus­trial presence in South Africa, a direct impact could be made on the lives of South African blacks. Working for a manage­ment which supports freedo~ would undoubtedly be more beneficial than working for one's oppressors.

Syracuse rebounds from NO upset to trounce BC 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) ­Derrick Coleman scored 21 points and Syracuse used an 11-1 run at the start of the second half and held Boston College to just one field goal for 7 1/2 minutes, as the Orangemen ended their two-game losing streak with a 105­69 Big East victory over the Eagles on Tuesday. 
The Orangemen (19-5 and 9­
4) ended up outscoring Boston College 23-5 during the 7 1/2­minute span as they kept a half-game behind Georgetown and a game behind front-run­ning Connecticut in the Big East race. 
Billy Owens added 17 points and LeRon Ellis 16 for Syracuse while Boston College (7-16 and 1-12) was led by freshman David Hinton's 18 points. 
Syracuse squeezed out a 43­39 halftime lead after failing to shake the Eagles in the first half minutes. 
Guard Michael Hopkins started an eight-point run with a pair of free throws and when Tony Scott sank a 3-pointer at the 5:37 mark it gave the Orangemen a 34-24lead. 
But Boston College answered with a 15-6 spurt sparked by David Hinton's six points and pulled to within 40-39, with 
1:12 to remaining before Scott hit another 3-pointer to give Syracuse its four point cushion. 
Ellis scored six of his first-half high 13 points during Boston College's run. 
Syracuse shot out with an 11­1 run to start the second and had built a 56-42 lead when Hinton scored Boston College's first field goal of the half at the 
16:01 mark. It was 12:31 when Bobby Moran hit a jumper for the Eagle's next basket. By that time Syracuse had built a 66-46 lead. 
It was the first time since Dec. 19, a span of 15 games, that Syracuse broke the 100­point mark. 
Memphis State 82,
Louisville 68 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) Ernest Smith scored 18 points Tuesday night to lead Memphis State to an easy 82-68 Metro Conference victory over 16th­ranked Louisville. 
Memphis State (16-9, 7 -5) used a balanced attack to over­come the Cardinals. The Tigers led by as many as 18 points with 23 seconds left as Louisville (20-6, 9-2) went cold from the field and Memphis State guard Elliot Perry, who finished with 15, connected on eight consecutive free throws in the final1:32. 

The score was tied 38-38 at the 19:08 mark of the second half when Memphis State went on an 11-1 run culminating with a free throw by Smith with 
15:40 remaining. Louisville got no closer than seven after that. 
Memphis State led 36-34 after a fast-paced first half. The Tigers scored the first six points of the game, but Louisville answered with a seven-point run. 
Memphis State, on a 15­footer by reserve Russell Young, regained the lead 14-8 at the 12:25 mark. 
Louisville's led again when Everick Sullivan connected on a 3-pointer from the wing for a 30-26 advantage with 4:10 left in the half. 
But Memphis State used the outside shooting of reserve Jewell Burton and Cheyenne Gibson for the halftime lead. 
Young added 12 points for Memphis State and Cheyenne Gibson had 10. 
Felton Spencer led Louisville with 19 points, Keith Williams had 18 and Sullivan finished with 16, including five 3-point baskets.

Lack of progress in baseball talks may endanger season 
By BARBARA MORAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team had a rough last weekend in the inhospitable Lone Star State, battling through a cancelled plane flight and harsh weather conditions, only to drop two out of three matches and lower their record to 1-3. 
The Irish lost 9-0 to the University of Texas on Friday, after arriving in Texas only hours before the match due to a flight cancellation in Chicago. 
The defeat was followed by an 8-1 loss to neighboring Texas A&M on a bitter and breezy 
outdoor court. The weekend ended on a high note, however, with a strong 5-0 defeat of Texas San Antonio despite rainy weather which caused the match to be called during the flifth game. 
"I was a little disappointed with the weekend," said Irish coach Jay Louderback. "Texas and Texas A&M are both good teams, but we could have played a little better than we did. I don't know what it was, maybe the rough trip, but we just didn't compete as well as we could have." 
Junior Kim Pacella was the bright spot for the Irish last weekend, scoring the only point for Notre Dame against Texas A&M, and contributing tough play in the Texas loss. 
"She was really into it against Texas," said Louderback. "She's a fighter: she doesn't like to lose and she hangs in there. She played tough all weekend." 
Despite their 1-3 record, Louderback is pleased with the 

play of his young team. The top eight players for the Irish in­clude only one junior and one senior, and Louderback expects his team to improve as they gain experience. 
However, Louderback realizes 
the importance of chalking up some wins on the Irish score­board, and hopes to do so this weekend, when the Irish take on Illinois, Kansas State, Drake and Miami of Ohio at home. 
"We lost a close match to Northwestern, and they'll probably end up second in the region. Those are the matches that we've got to win -we have to play better against ranked teams. 
"We have a good chance of winning all four [this weekend. They're big matches for us ­Illinois and Miami are the teams to beat because they're in our region. We've played such good schools so far, we want to make sure we win these."

Wednesday, the seventh day of owners' spring-training lock­out. 
Chuck O'Connor, chief nego­tiator for the owners, said management would make a new proposal on Wednesday in an attempt to break the stalemate. The union wants players with two ears in the ma·or lea ues to be eligible for arbitration, as they were before the 1985 agreement. Owners want the threshold to remain at three years. 
"Let's see if we can deal with this problem in other ways," O'Connor said. "We are looking for ways." 
Management has proposed minimums of $75,000 for first­year players, $125,000 for players with 1 to 2 years of service and $200,000 for play­ers with 2 to 3 years of service. O'Connor said owners were looking at methods other than arbitration that would funnel money to younger players. 
"There are things you could do with minimum salary, rosters and waiver rules," O'Connor said. "That's what we're looking at."

Donald Fehr, executive direc­tor of the players association, said talks would break after Thursday because the union staff needs to travel and update players on the situation. 
"They're scattered over the country and it's going to take time," Fehr said. "I don't know whether it's 10 days, two weeks, 12 days, 16 days. 
"This is not new," he said later. "They've known for 10 or 14 days that we would have to do this." 
Fehr, who said talks probably would not resume until March 5 at the earliest, said the Thursday deadline was set be­cause it was the last possible date an agreement could be reached that would get players to spring training by Feb. 28, the mandatory reporting date._ 
"At that point it's apparent you're not going to have any­body there next Wednesday," Fehr said. 
Both sides say at least three weeks of spring training are needed for players to get in shape. Fehr said some players need as much as five days to get to camp and that "the clubs say it's going to take five days to get the equipment there." 
With those constrictions, there would not be much time for an agreement if talks take a prolonged recess. When O'Connor was asked if a break would endanger a start of the season on April 2, he said: "We may be. We may be." 
Fehr and O'Connor said a break would be needed anyway because it was unnecessary to meet only to disagree over arbi­tration. 
"There isn't much sense in meeting with the other side if there's no purpose to that," O'Connor said. 
At a side meeting Tuesday, negotiators discussed schedul­ing, meal money and termina­tion pay and came closer to agreement on those issues. 
However, arbitration eligibil­ity has become the issue that's holding up and agreement. 
"It doesn't mean that's the only issue left," O'Connor said, "but that's the centerpiece."

Ashe finds no racial bias Prop 42

coach Digger Phelps said. "With three seconds to go, there's still time to tip it and that's why Howard was able to tip it. It's never over till it's over. It's just part of the game." 
Said DePaul coach Joey Meyer, "We didn't diagram that one because we had no timeouts left. In the end there's something to be said for not coaching too much." 
Howard, named this week to the All-District V GTE All­America team, kept the Blue Demons from an insurmount­able deficit in the first half. With the Irish keying on high­scoring David Booth (17 .5 points per game), Howard saw the chance to take over inside. 
He scored 16 of DePaul's 24 
first-half points, including 7 in 
an 11-4 run that brought the 
Blue Demons within 10 to 34­
24 at halftime. 
"He got some open shots," Notre Dame forward LaPhonso Ellis said. "When I did go after the block, he was able to lift the ball up a little higher." 
Howard's play in the first half opened the way for his teammates in the second stanza. but his ten points came at key times. 
He silenced a five-point Irish run with 16:16 left and then capped a seven-point Blue Demon streak to cut the margin to 50-45. His rebound basket with 3:30 remaining made it a one-point game at 55-54 before his game-winner at the buzzer. 
Howard hopes this game will lead to more consistent per­formances in the remaining five contests. DePaul will need to be impressive in those games, in­cluding the regular-season fi­nale with Notre Dame, to gain attention from the tourney se­lection committee. 
Like the Blue Demons, Howard has had an up-and­down year. He scored in double figures six of the first seven games, but scored eight, six and five points in a three-game 
stretch with North Carolina, Dayton and Marquette. Howard averages 13.7 points per game and 8.1 rebounds. 
"We needed this win on the road," Howard said. "I think we did a good job in getting it. I just hope that now we can be more consistent." 

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) ­Former top-ranked black pro­fessional tennis player Arthur Ashe says the NCAA's Proposition 42 requirements aren't culturaily biased and ac­tually set acceptable academic standards for athletes too low. 
"Either you can read and write, walk and chew gum. or you can't," he said during ap­pearances Tuesday at Wichita State University as part of Black History Month. 
Cultural bias doesn't have anything to do with a black athlete falling short when the NCAA sets the Scholastic Aptitude Test minimum score requirement at 700 and the overall grade point average re­quirement at 2.0, levels that a third-rate student can achieve, Ashe said. 
LOSS 
continued from page 16 
Notre Dame's non-starters combined for three points and three turnovers during the game. 
"When you go to the bench, you want to get positives, and we didn't get them," Phelps said. "That got DePaul going, and it was that way for the next 30 minutes." 

DePaul still could not close the gap too much in the first half, mainly because the Blue Demons were not getting any kind of outside shooting. The Demons shot just 9-of-37 (24%) in the first half, including a perfect 0-for-8 from three­point range. 
"Notre Dame was playing a good zone, and we're not a good team against zones," Meyer said. "For a while, we couldn't put in anything." 
The Irish led 34-24 at half­time, and Howard had kept DePaul in the game almost sin­glehandedly with his 16 points. 
In the second half, Howard started to get a little help. David Booth and Melvon Foster began the half with baskets to cut the Irish lead to 34-28, be­fore Keith Robinson connected with 17:28 left, scoring Notre Dame's first basket since the Ellery shot. 
Notre Dame built the lead to 

41-30,  then  two  baskets  by  
Kevin  Holland  and  one  by  
Howard made it 41-36.  

The Irish continued to answer every challenge, however, and Fredrick's three-pointer with 
10:31 left put the Irish up 50­

Ashe said blacks make up 6.5 percent of the student bodies at the approximately 290 NCAA Division I schools, but total 58 percent of the basketball play­ers and 38 percent of the foot­ball players there. 
Only one in five of the 10.000 black athletes at Division I sehools will graduate, whieh, at $1 0,000 a year for five-year scholarships, means the col­leges are spending $250,000 in scholarship money for each graduate, Ashe said.

38 and made it appear as though Notre Dame was back in control. 
Notre Dame did not score another basket for almost five minutes of playing time. 
"I think it was a lapse of con­centration on our part," said Bennett. "I think we should have run more transition in the second half because that's what got us in the lead." 
DePaul set up the last-minute heroics by going on a 16-5 spurt after Fredrick's three­pointer. The Demons relied on their inside game to get back into it, as forward Kevin Holland and centers Howard and James Hamby combined to score 11 of those 16 points. 
"We're a strong team, and we'll recover from this," Bennett said. "It's just that they're a major independent like us, they came into our home court and we let them win when we could have shut them out of the NCAAs." 
IRISH ITEMS: Fredrick scored his 1.000th career point midway through the first half... The Irish were decked out in black Reebok shoes for the con­test...

Saturday's game with Georgia Tech is sold out, as is the March 3 encounter with top-care about us as students. You care about us as athletes to fill your stadiums and arenas." 
Aslw said the emphasis on academics needs to start in high school. 
If a student gets an SAT score below a 700, then. Ashe says, a high school counselor or coach needs to say: "You're going to stop running footballs or ~ho.1!ting hoops and study awhile. 
At the prep level, Ashe said all televising of basketball and football games should be banned except for all-star con­tests. lie said television is just "creating a lot of little Notre Dames" and passing the prob­lem down through the system.

Freshman Coleman sparks men's tennis successes 
Irish hope last weekend's performance witl earn them a spot in national collegiate polls 
Special to The Observer 
Skip Holtz, wide receiver coach in 1989 on Earle Bruee's Colorado State foot­ball coaching staff, has been named wide receiver coach at the University of Notre Dame. 
The announcement was made today by Irish head coach Lou Holtz, who hap­pens to be Skip's father. 
Skip's presence will enable vetflran Irish assistant Pete Cordelli to work exclusively with the Notre Dame quar­terbacks beginning this spring. That figures to be particularly important to the Irish in 1990-due to the graduation of all-star sig­nal-caller Tony Hice and the relative inexperience of freshmen Rick Mirer and Jake Kelchner, the only two

Although this is a fictitious exchange, I won't dare to callit a joke. The illusory concept may become a concrete fact in the near future. Of course, the Irish have not verbally ex­pressed their desire to enter the Top 25. Rather, they have let their actions speak for them­selves. On Sunday afternoon, the Notre Dame men's tennis team hit the door of the Top 25 with a resounding blow by knocking off regional foe Ball State 5-4 at the Eck Pavilion. That win will make it hard for the pollsters to exclude the Irish from the next poll and

ns stun ND with last second shot 
Desperation last shot keys 63-62 Blue Demon victory 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 

When you live by the sword, you die by the sword. 
The Notre Dame men's bas­ketball team learned that painful lesson Tuesday night, breaking the hearts of the Joyce ACC crowd of 10,803 and corning dangerously close to bursting the NCAA Tournament bubble in which they reside. 
Just three days after upset­ting Syracuse on an Elmer Bennett buzzer-beater, the Irish got knifed in the back by DePaul's Stephen Howard, who tipped in a Chuckie Murphy air ball with no time on the clock to defeat the Irish 63-62 in the first battle this season between the nation's two major inde­pendents. 
"That's all part of the college game," said Irish coach Digger Phelps, whose team blew an 18­point lead. "It's never over until it's over. It's just part of the game." 
Howard's tip-in carne after Bennett hit both ends of a one­and-one with five seconds left to give the Irish a 62-61 advan­tage. DePaul's leading scorer David Booth, who was held to nine points Tuesday, had con­verted a three-point play with 12 seconds remaining to give

points and pulled down seven 
improved Notre Dame's record to a surprising 10-1, including a perfect 8-0 at home. 
One reason that the Irish are knocking down the door of the Top 25 is a spirited and tal­ented freshman-Chuck Coleman. Coleman, a native of Lake Wylie, South Carolina, has raced down enough tennis balls and hit enough critical shots to earn the No. 2 singles spot on a most talented Irish squad. Sporting a 8-1 singles record, Coleman also fills one-half of Notre Dame's No. 2 doubles team. 
"Chuck has been a tremen­dous asset to our team," said head coach Bob Bayliss. "He has provided consistency for us and stepped up and has played higher than we perceived he would have. He moves as well 

Chuck Coleman 

as anyone in tennis and that is not just college tennis. Chuck is going to a mean a lot to Notre Dame tennis for a long time and has the potential to be an All-American." 
All this from a true freshman who only had the intention of getting a chance to play any­where in the lineup. 
«I didn't know what to expect 
the Blue Demons their first lead 
since the game's opening bas­
ket. 

"I couldn't be prouder of a 
basketball team," said DePaul 
coach Joey Meyer, whose team 
would have been virtually elimi­
nated from NCAA consideration 
with a loss Tuesday. "We carne 
in here with everyone thinking 
we didn't have a chance after 
Notre Dame's big win over 
Syracuse. But we proved we 
ain't dead yet." 

Notre Dame (14-9) did a good job of stabbing itself sev­eral times before the game's dramatic conclusion. The Irish led by 18 in the first half and held a 12-point advantage with 
10:30 left in the game, but a pair of scoring droughts al­lowed DePaul to claw back into the game. 
"When you're up by 17 with the ball, you shouldn't have to pull it out at the buzzer," said Irish guard and eo-captain Joe Fredrick, whose 18 points had him sharing team-high scoring honors with Bennett. 
Keith Robinson added 10 points for the Irish, and he also pulled down a team-high 14 re­bounds. LaPhonso Ellis had 14 rebounds and nine points. Howard scored a game-high 26 points and was joined in double figures by DePaul teammate 

when I carne to Notre Dame," said Coleman. "I just wanted to come in and play. I didn't set any goals as far as wins go. I just wanted to improve." 
Coleman's contribution to the 1990 men's squad is somewhat fitting considering the youth of Bayliss's squad. Six singles spots are filled by four fresh­man. In addition, two-thirds of the doubles teams are com­prised ·or frosh. 
Coleman's success hinges on his aggressive, even brash ap­proach to the game and his cat­like quickness. Some would say Coleman is a toned-down Andre Agassi. While Coleman does not possess the arrogance of the Las Vegas native, he shares both a powerful forehand that explodes off the racket and ag­gressive mental attitude to­wards the game. 
Stephan Howard 
rebounds. 

But it was the tip-in that will stand out in this game -remi­niscent of the 1983 NCAA Championship when North Carolina State's Lorenzo Charles tipped in a Dereck Whittenburg shot to give the Wolfpack the national title. 
After Elmer Bennett hit two free throws to put Notre Dame ahead 62-61, the Blue Demons pushed the ball upcourt and Murphy had a jumper at the top of the key with three seconds left. But Murphy's shot fell short and Howard was all alone under the basket to put it in. 
"I knew it was short," Howard said. "I had beaten ev­erybody down the court. It just fell into my hands and I caught it. 
"I didn't know if there was enough time left. I just looked and saw everybody jumping around." 
The Irish did have one player back in Keith Robinson, but he moved out to challenge Murphy's shot. He forced Murphy to hurry, but that also left Howard alone under the basket. 
"He (Robinson) left Howard to check the shot," Notre Dame 
see HOWARD I page 14 
"Chuck has big weapons off both wings and is fast as any­one around," exudes Bayliss. "He posses the ability to hit the 
critical shot at any time which is very difficult to coach. Chuck is an attacking baseliner who is very solid and looks for every opportunity to attack the net." 
Why has Coleman bnen so successful in the infantile stages of his collegiate tennis career? 
"I think it is because I liave had someone good to practice against day after day," said Coleman. "Also, Coach Bayliss has been great, not to mention Brian Kalbas and Billy Mountford who have been su­perb. During the matches, I just try to run down all the balls and make my opponent error on the point. I try to wear them down and frustrate them." 
Terry Davis, who had 11. 
The Irish committed a sea­son-high 25 turnovers in the contest, with 15 of them corning in the second half. 
"Turnovers killed us," said Phelps. "You can't have a big lead like that. then start turn­ing the ball over and missing shots." 
Notre Dame raced to a 22-6 lead midway through the first half with a 13-0 run. Ellis and Monty Williams each seorPd four points during that stn~tch. 
DePaul ( 15-12) followed with five straight points of its own, but the Irish came back to score the next sewm points and gain a 29-11 lead, their biggest of the game. 
"For a while there, it was get­ting ridiculous with NotrP Dame pulling ahead," said DePaul coach Joey Meyer. "Hut then I think Notre Dame rP­laxed and we kept fighting and playing defense." 
Mwr grabbing its big lead, the Irish started making substi­tutions and stoppPd scoring points. K1win Ellery's jumper with 7:59 left in the half put Notre Dame ahead 27-11, but the Irish did not scorP another basket for more than 10 min­utes.
