10 killed" in Grand Canyon pla!!~w~!!~~"d 
Assoc1ated Press 
TUSAYAN, Ariz.-A sightsee­ing plane crashed into a wooded hill near the Grand Canyon Airport on Wednesday, killing 10 people and injuring the other 11 people aboard. 
The aircraft's wings were sheared off by tall Ponderosa pines, but some passengers survived because the fuselage of the de Havilland Twin Otter remained largely intact, said Sheriff Joe Richards. The two crew members were killed, he said. 
National Park Service Ranger Paul Crawford, who was among the first to reach the wreckage, said some of the passengers were walking around when he arrived at the scene on a small ridge about 300 yards east of a runway. 

"They were shellshocked. They had that empty, dazed look," he said. 
Canyon Airlines plane went down at 9:49 a.m., said FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke. Brekke said the plane hit trees, flipped over and crashed after veering on its landing ap­proach. Elizabeth Seibold, co­owner of Grand Canyon Air­lines, said from Las Vegas that the plane was on a sightseeing flight and was coming in for a landing. Seibold said all those aboard were Americans. The airport is located about five miles south of the Grand Canyon. The injured were being taken by ambulance, airplane and helicopter to the Flaggstaff Medical Center about 75 miles away. 

Hospital spokeswoman Lau­rin Bosse said the condition of the injured who had arrived ranged from serious to critical,

Bush urges educational reforms 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.­President Bush urged governors at an education summit Wednesday to forge fundamen­tal changes to rescue the na­tion's troubled schools, but was told in return the federal gov­ernment must spend more if that goal is to be reached. 
"We've got to challenge the education system if we're to meet the challenge of educa­tional excellence," Bush told the governors in a pep talk that opened the nation's first educa­tional conference between a president and the states' execu­tives. 
All agreed that help is needed for a national school system wracked by drugs, high dropout rates and mediocrity. 
But behind closed doors Bush and members of his Cabinet heard what they did not want to hear: that the federal gov­ernment's commitment has to grow. 
"If they would give us a 5­year-old that· is healthy and alert, the system would be much more productive," said Republican Gov. Garrey Car­ruthers of New Mexico. 
The summit scene was the historic campus of the Univer­sity of Virginia, whose estab­lishment was the proudest ac­complishment of Thomas Jef­ferson -America's first "education president." The uni­versity is still called "Mr. Jef­ferson's school" and Bush re­ferred to it that way, too. 
Bush dined with the gover­nor at Jefferson's famous home, Monticello, atop a nearby mountain. A fife and drum corps played and soldiers in colonial costume bearing the flags of the states lined the walkway to the main entrance, where Bush and his wife, Bar­bara, stood in a receiving line that passed the diners through the building into the back yard. 
An Army band played swing tunes for the guests at rose­and orchid-bedecked tables be­neath a large tent. 
Governors circulated a memo outlining their own goals. Their plan called for eliminating illit­eracy, curtailing the dropout rate and making American stu­dents the equal of their coun­terparts anywhere in the world,

Panelists voice opinion on the ordination of women 
By CHRISTINE WALSH 
Assistant News Editor 

To a packed crowd, panelists from the newly formed Committee on Notre Dame's Position on the Ordination of Women discussed the exclusion of women from public positions within the Church and the need for the University to make a stand on this issue, Wednesday. 
The three panelists in the dis­cussion were Teresa Godwin Phelps, associate professor of law, Father Thomas O'Meara, Warren professor of theology, and Sister Regina Coli, director of field education in the de­partment of theology. 
"Notre Dame has to, as an institution, recognize that we have a justice issue here. We've got to say that there is injustice against our women... a discriminatory practice," said Professor John Houck, co-chair of the committee. 
In a letter to University offi­cials, the committee stated its objectives as threefold: 1.) to express the committee's soli­darity with the women of the university who are being dis­criminated against with regard to this issue, 2.) provide public forums to explore what Notre Dame and other Catholic insti­tutions can do about the ban, and 3.) to work through cam­pus and administrative organi­zations to express the Univer­sity's position on the discrimi­natory policies of the Catholic Church on the ordination of women. 
"The Church systematically discriminates against women," said Phelps, a self-professed 'Catholic feminist.' 
"It's an issue of fairness," said Phelps, and "women are fully legitimate and participa­tory beings." 
"No one has a right to be or­dained... we only ask that the Church consider our position," Phelps added.

WORLD BRIEFS 
Customs agents arrested two West German Civilian Ser­vice workers trying to smuggle LSD-soaked stickers bearing the image of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev into Dusseldorf, au­thorities said Wednesday. The stamps were similar to previous drug-smuggling attempts in which pictures of Batman, Goofy and 
E.T. have been used to disguise LSD doses. 
Up to 33 fishermen and traders died when their boat, be­lieved by authorities to be overloaded, capsized Tuesday in Lake Victoria, Kenya. It was the second major accident on Lake Victo­ria this month. On Sept. 12, 12 people drowned when their canoe capsized while traveling from Uganda to Kenya. 
Luck wasn't on track for The Norwegian State Railroad this week. When workers rolled out fire hoses to extinguish a fire whieh was accidently set by their own bonfire, they found a defec­tive coupling had cut water pressure. The blazing structure then collapsed onto the tracks,warping the rails. The fire left about 1,000 passengers stranded for hours in the mountains outside Bergen until they were finally put onto buses. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Ten people were poisoned accidentally at a Topeka, Kan. nightspot Saturday when a cleaning solution was inadvertently served in place of liquor, police said. The victims all ordered a drink containing schnapps, but do to the similarity of the contain­ers, were served some type of dishwashing liquid. 
A mistrial was declared when a juror realized she already had helped convict the defendant in an earlier trial. The Wichita, Kan. trial of James Johnson, 38, charged with aggravated bur­glary and aggravated battery, ended Wednesday after a juror rec-. ognized the defendent as the same man she had helped send to prison in 1982. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 
In John Dillinger's image, Robert Gregory pulled a fake pistol which he had carved from a bar of blackened soap to escape from the Lake County Government Center last February. Tuesday, Gregory was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the two counts of robbery and escape. 
Outlaw John Dillinger carved a gun out of a piece of wood and blackened it with shoe polish to escape from the Crown Point Jail in 1934. 
State health officials declared a measles emergency Wednesday at three Clay County schools after an elementary school student was diagnosed as having "old-fashioned" measles.The alert was the fourth measles emergency declared this year in Indiana. Porter County, the University of Notre Dame and Ball State University were covered by previous alerts. 
CAMPUS BRIEFS 
Fred Sharkey has been moved up to fair condition and out of intensive care according to a spokesperson from St. Joseph's Medical Center. The Stanford freshman fell out of a window in Pangborn Hall last Friday night.

Pessimism is the key that opens the door of happiness 
In grade school, a teacher once asked me, "What do you call 1>omebody who thinks the entire world is out to get him?" 
I answered, "A realist." 
Ever since then, I've had a reputation as a bit of a pessimist. I don't mind that; it's accurate enough. But lately, it seems to me, pessimism has been getting a bit of a bum rap. 
Everywhere I look, I see the virtues of optimism trumpeted. 
Books with titles like "The Power of Positive Thinking" and "Choose Your Own Greatness" give blithe assurances that if you just have faith in yourself and think that nothing is impossible, then everything is possible. Reach for your dreams with confidence, and you won't fail, they say. 
News programs have inspirational, heart­warming stories about people who struggled against incredible odds and succeeded. When asked about how they did it, they say, "It was hard, but I knew from the start that if I set my mind to it and tried, I would make it." 
If you don't believe me, just go over to the bookstore and look at some of the cheesy posters that have uplifting messages like "You must believe to achieve." All of these things don't inspire me-they disgust and sicken me. 
The biggest problem I have with them is that they simply aren't true. Sure, it's nice to hear about people who tried and succeeded. But there are many people who, no matter how hard they try at something, will miserably fail. Look at Gerry Faust. Simply having a positive attitude doesn't guarantee success. 
In fact, a positive attitude is a liability. If people go into an endeavor absolutely convinced they will succeed, they will be totally unprepared for failure. Their self-images will be shattered, and their lives turned into travesties. They will become disillusioned and bitter, sort of like me. 
When I make some cynical comment about an "inspirational" human-interest story in the paper, sometime people say, "That's horrible. How could you say that? Would you rather not 
have the quadruple amputee swim the Atlantic Ocean? Would you rather have her just give up?" 
People who say these things misunderstand my position. Some people think that pessimists have to be glum, dour people who wear black and shuffle

'That's the key to happiness: lowered expectations.· 
Tim O'Keefe Assistant News Editor 
along with their shoulders hunched over, muttering things like, "Nothing makes any difference. Why should I bother trying at all, since I will inevitably fail? Soon enough, the indifferent hand of Fate will come down and smash me into oblivion anyway." 
I'm not saying anything like that. I don't think we should all just give up, shrivel up and die with a small whimper of self-pity. We all have the right, even the duty, to try as hard as possible for goals we care about. 
What we don't have the right to expect, however, is success. Maybe it will come to us, maybe not. Our actions are under our control, but maqy of the things that determine our lives are totally uncontrollable. 
This recognition of reality has made me a lot less anxious. I know the universe is a pretty messed up place, and it's liable to pull all sorts of nasty little tricks on me. But because it's beyond my control, I don't worry about it. If something bad happens, that's what I expected anyway, so I'm not disappointed. And if something good happens, it's a pleasant surprise. 
That's the key to happiness: lowered expectations.

42 law schools attend Notre Dame gathering 

ByDAN DWYER Staff Reporter 

Representatives of 42 law schools discussed their schools with Notre Dame students and distributed applications and other information Wednesday at the seventh annual Law School Caravan in the Monogram Room of the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Cen­ter. 
"This was an opportunity for any Notre Dame student inter­ested in law school to come and meet representatives from schools across the country." said Barry Schulock, president of the Pre-Law Society, one ot the sponsors of the event. 
"The purpose of this gather­ing is to make prospective law students aware of the many dif­ferent schools and what they offer," said Schulock. 
The Caravan was attended by many of the 250 members of the Pre-Law Society, in addition to students from the South Bend area. Advertisements in the South Bend Tribune were purchased by the Pre-Law Soci­ety.

She said that the publication should include news in sports, academics, student govern­ment. and residence halls. She also suggested that professors and other students submit arti­cles for publication. 
Other board members said that it should be more of an in­formational newsletter than a newspaper that could be pub­lished more frequently than the current newsletter, but cover more information. Student Body President Lisa Catenacci emphasized that the publication would not be a break from The Observer, but an additional publication for SMC students. 
Suggestions for security were also discussed and a possible Security Awareness Week was proposed.

MANILA, Philippines-Police hurled tear gas Wednesday to disperse 2,000 leftists demon­strating against Vice President Dan Quayle and American mili­tary bases here, while President Corazon Aquino aceepted a U.S. offer to discuss the bases' fu­turo. 
Quayle called the ambush­slayings of two American civil­ians on Tuesday "cowardly murders" and said a majority of Filipinos want the bases to remain. 
"Let me be direct: terrorists will not drive Americans from the Philippines," he told U.S. troops and dependents at Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base, the largest of the six American installations here.

Not only are women inade­quately represented by not al­lowing them to enter public of­fice, but men and women alike are inadequately represented because of the Church's dis­crimination against women, said Phelps. There are approx­imately 19,000 Catholic parishes in this country, and roughly 1100 of those are to­day without priests, said Coli. 
"If the Church must commit injustice... it must have convineing reasons," Phelps said. "The supply of priests is running low," and many Catholics will not have priests

Opposition to the bases is in­creasing among Filipinos, who sec the facilities as an in­fringement on national sovereignty.

in the coming decades, said Phelps. 
From the theological per­spective, O'Meara said, "The Catholic approach is one of re­alism and one of reasons." O'Meara explained the concept of the Kingdom of God, in rela­tion to the Church's attitude toward the position of women. 
The Church must come to grips with new issues, said O'Meara. "When half of the human race is excluded from the public role, the Church re­verts back to tribal religion ... We are reestablishing elite groups (of men)" he said. 
The Kingdom of God is about human beings, and not just men, said O'Meara. 
"We can't expect to find to-written 2,000 years ago," said Coli. 

Scripture doesn't explicitly exclude women from public po­sitions, and "Christ's intention wouldn't be transgressed if women were ordained," Coli added. 
"This is a justice issue ... If they {women) don't have this option, why are they being edu­cated," said Ann Seckinger, an­other committee member. 
"The University has got to make a statement that this (discrimination) is wrong," said Houck. Notre Dame should band together with other Catholic institutions and take the case to the American Catholic Bishops, he said.

there are five major regional gatherings of law schools in key cities around the country, there is an advantage to this smaller convention. "Seniors can pick up information and applications from a school that he or she thinks is best suited to his needs," said Schulock. 
The Caravan, also sponsored by the Offices of Career Place­ment and the College of Arts and Letters, drew members of' the law school's admissions of­fices and graduate students as representatives. 
"In the early 1980s, applica­tions to law schools were de­clining at a rapid paee. We then saw the need for these gather­ings where we ean get information out to the students," said a repre­sentative, who asked to remain anonymous.

Pandora's fights illiteracy in youth 
By JOHN ZALLER Staff Reporter 
Pandora's Books, a book­seller in South Bend, joined with other booksellers and publishers across the country this week to begin the Year of the Young Reader campaign. 
The campaign is designed to fight illiteracy in youth by en­couraging children to pick up books and read. 
Pandora's Books will be giv­ing away books for 1 cent to all local school children through grade 12. Any interested reader may select a book of their choice for a penny, and the youth then has the option to keep the book selected or to re­turn the book for another. 
"It seems fitting to us that during National Banned Book Week we should announce our program to give any student the book of their choice," said Mandy Arnold, manager of the neighborhood bookstore. 
National Banned Book Week (September 23-30) is sponsored by the American Booksellers Association to alert the reading public that censorship still ex­ists. 
Many books are banned by school districts, libraries, par­ent associations, and towns. Most of theses books are well known. John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" (profanity) and Stephen King's "Shining" (ridicule of Christianity) are among those banned in certain areas of the country. 
Arnold believes that while those who ban books act with what they consider to be the

According to Arnold and other booksellers, the banning of books in this country is con­trary to the First Amendment. 

"Our recent experience with the 'Satanic Verses' has caused us to become much more active in defending our right to read what we chose," Arnold added, referring to the bombings of four bookstores in England last week as paperback versions of the controversial Muslim novel were released. 
The goal of the program, according to Arnold, is to turn the negative implications of censorship into a seed of curiosity in the minds of the young people in the community.

A National Transportation Safety Board investigation team was not expected to reach the airport until late Wednes­day. Richards said the plane "possibly had a power failure or may have struck a power line." 
There was a small brushfire caused by a downed power line but it was not known it the plane hit the line as it crashed.

Sony gobbles up Columbia 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Sony Corp. struck a $3.4 billion deal Wednesday to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., producer of such movies as "Ghostbusters" and TV hits like "Who's The Boss." 
The deal comes 21 months after the huge Japanese video and audio equipment maker bought CBS Hecords for $2 billion. It marks the biggest step of Sony's push into the software side of the entertainment business that will provide products such as movies and records to complement its stereos, televisions and videocassette recorders. 
The agreement also extends 
Sony's $27 a share offer should provide a big payday for Coca-Cola Co., which stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from selling its 49 percent stake in Columbia. Coca-Cola signed an option agreement with Sony to tender its nearly 54 million shares of Columbia stock, subject to approval by Coca-Cola's board, which is expeced to meet Monday. 
Coca-Cola declined comment on what it intends to do with the cash. 
In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia rose 37 1/2 cents a share to $26.62 1/2 while Coca­Cola gained 50 cents a share to $64.62 1/2. 
Sony reportedly had been looking for a movie studio for more than a year in an effort to extend its reach into new areas of the entertainment business that it already serves as a dominant maker of consumer electronics. 

 Michael Schulhof, vice 
chairman  of  Sony  Corp.  of  
America,  said  he  had  held  
informal  discusssions  with  

Columbia executives for about a year but that the talks turned serious only in the past week. He said Sony decided on a proposal over the weekend and presented it on Monday. 
Columbia Chairman Donald Keough, who also is president of Coca-Cola, said Sony was "an ideal buyer." 
,,I" Chicken war calls for new tactics 
, 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO. Texas ­While the colonel's troops are leading in the fried chieken war, newly merged Church's and Popeyes are banking on marketing and franchising tactics to gain ground in the $9 billion industry. 
Church's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeyes famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits -second and third before the merger among chicken chains behind Kentucky Fried Chicken -will keep their names. 
But Church's old business plan -small restaurants catering to inner city clientele -is undergoing a change as flashier decor, new menu items and some price increases are in store for customers accustomed to small orange and green buildings offering basic, inexpensive chicken. 
The merger was completed Sept. 20 with a shareholders meeting in Metarie, La., ending a process begun last year when AI Copeland, owner of New Orleans-based Popeyes, launched an unsolicited tender offer for San Antonio-based Church's. 

Under a February agreement, Copeland bought 86 percent of Church's stock for $331 million, with fees and other expenses estimated at $150 million. Church's and Popeyes will operate under AI Copeland Enterprises with offices in New Orleans and San Antonio. 
In an attempt to wipe away some of Church's red ink, the company plans to emphasize franchised stores rather than company-owned stores within the Church's division.

Keane added that the busi­ness school was interested in the international business prospective. "Who among you could do your job in a vacuum.

BIZARRE LOVE SQUARE 
DAN RUSSELL 
accent writer 
A
fter critically acclaimed debuts in major cities across America, the film sex, lies, and videotape finally made its way to South Bend, opening last Friday at the General Cinema at Univer­sity Park East. 
Written and directed by new­comer Steven Soderbergh, the film tells the story of four peo­ple whose lives become over­whelmed by the sexual mis­deeds surrounding them. It features some of the best writ­ing and acting in any movie this year. 

Frustrated with his wife's lack of sexual enthusiasm, John Milani (Peter Gallagher) begins an affair with her sister, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo). Ann (Andie Macdowell), his wife, is receiving therapy for her problem. 
Now, enter Graham(James Spader), an old friend of John from high school. Grahamhas spent the past nine years of his life roaming the country to vid­eotape interviews with women about the sexual aspects of their lives. These tapes, as well as daily masturbation, serve as an attempt to elimi­nate his need for female com­panionship because of the pain he continues to endure through the loss of a high school love. 
Ann and Grahambecome close friends and grow to know each other's problems well 
while the physical relationship 
of John and Cynthia continues. 
Conflict occurs when Ann 
discovers her husband's affair 
and responds by having Gra­
ham interview her. Indeed, it 
is during this interview that 
they discover that the solution to their problems can only be reached through the unique love they have for each other. 
Intuition should tell you the rest of the story. 
The use of videotape is em­ployed very originally and effectively throughout the film. In the movie's most powerful moment, John watches the taped interview of his wife. Throughout the scene, the camera alternates between videotaped footage and normal cinematic film, so the audience experiences both the drama be­tween Grahamand Ann and the reactions of John as he watch­es the videotaped scene. 
The film captivates by focus­ing on sex and relationships. Only five sets are used through­out the entire movie. The set­ting is never known. Its focus is not on action or plot or setting, but rather on what these peo­ple have to say to one another. This is a film based on dialogue and the human feelings it por­trays. Creating this type of film is risk for a film maker, but it has resulted in such innovative pieces as The Breakfast Club, The Big Chill, and now, sex, lies, and videotape.

·' 
Andie MacDowell is one of the stars in newcomer Steve Soderbergh's first feature-length film, 'sex, lies, and videotape.' 
Particularly fine perfor­mances are turned in by James Spader and Andie Macdowell. They create a conflicting and yet beautiful relationship as a man trying to live without sex and a woman trying to live with it. 
sex, lies, and videotape is provocative and honest in its dealings with sex and relation­ships. This is a movie you'll find yourself talking about be­yond the car ride home. It is a movie you should see when you're in the mood for more than entertainment.

The Cubs clinched the National League East divi­sion with a 3-2 victory over the Montreal Expos Tuesday night. They re­mained in Canada to finish the series, but they were in the hearts of the 5,000 cheering fans at home.

SMC soccer downs Hope, gets upset by St. Joseph's 
By COLLEEN KRENZER 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's soccer saw it's undefeated streak come to an end last week. as the Belles posted a 1-2 record for the week. 
The Belles headed to St. Joseph College last Monday, expecting a win. Instead of a victory, the Belles found themselves bringing home a 4­0 upset. 
The team squeaked out a 1­0 victory at home against llope College on Wednesday. .Junior Trish Troester came through with the lone goal for Saint Mary's in a game that was much closer than the Belles thought it would be. 
Saturday's game against the University of Wisconsin­Milwaukee was another close match, only this time the Belles failed to come up with the victory. Saint Mary's de­fense held UWM to only one goal. but it was one goal too many, as the Belles offense was unable to produce, allow­ing UMW to come away with the 1-0 victory. 
The Belles are looking to re­bound this weekend with two big games at home. Marquette University comes to town on Saturday, hoping to avenge last year's 3-1 loss to Saint Mary's, Marquette's only loss of the season. 
University of Michigan, although only a club team, de­feated Notre Dame 3-0 earlier in the season and should be a formidable opponent, on Sunday at one o'clock.

Tettleton, in a 1-for-17 slump, hit his 26th home run in the fifth off Jerry Reuss, 9-9. Cal Ripken added an RBI single in the ninth. 
Phillies 5, Mets 3 
Just a few minutes after Keith Hernandez and Gary Carter said their goodbyes to the fans at Shea Stadium, Roger McDowell and Gregg Jefferies had something far less pleasant to say to each other. 
In an emotional, brawl­marred home finale, the Mets lost to the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 Wednesday night as McDowell and Jefferies fought in the ninth inning. 
McDowell, who was traded by the Mets in June, relieved Jeff Parrett to face Jefferies with two outs in the ninth and got Jefferies to ground out to sec­ond to end the game. 
As the out was being made, McDowell said something to Jefferies and the rookie charged the reliever and wres­tled him to the ground. Players from both benches then ran out on the field and some punches were thrown before order was restored. 
Cubs 7, Expos 2 

Chicago, fresh off clinching the NL East title, kept its mo­mentum going by beating Montreal despite hitting into a triple play for the second time this season. 
Mike Bielecki, 18-7, pitched five innings and allowed five hits for the victory. Jeff Pico finished for his second second save, yielding five hits. 
The Expos turned the sixth triple play in club history in the second inning when Domingo Ramos lined out to shortstop with runners at first and sec­ond. 
The Cubs won their second NL East title on Tuesday night when they beat the Expos 4-3 in 10 innings. 
Rookie Greg Smith and McClendon each drove in two runs for the Cubs.

Turner led a balanced Irish attack with 18 kills, and Fiebelkorn followed with 13. Senior Kathy Cunningham con­tinued her consistent play with 12 kills and a .391 hitting per­centage. As a squad, Notre Dame had a .223 hitting per­centage, compared to .135 for Purdue. 
This type of effort might let Lambert find the fountain of youth, even if he just gained one more year to his life.

Spartans eyeing the Hurricanes 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
After last weekend's 21-13 loss to top-ranked Notrn Dame, Michigan State defensive back Ilarlon Barnett gave a little pep talk to his teammates. 
"I just told them, 'Forget about this game. We're going to win the rest of them,' " Barnett said. 
Bring on second-ranked Miami. 
The Spartans will try to bring Hurricane season to an early finish Saturday at Spartan Stadium. Under the Erickson gang, coach Dennis and quar­terback Craig, Miami has opem~d the year with a 51-3 win over Wisconsin, a 31-3 victory over Cal and a 38-7 triumph over Missouri. 
"They're as well-rounded a team as you'd want," said Michigan State coach George Perles. "Their passing game and running game produce high draft choices every year, but what tht> coaches all know is that they play equally well on defense." 
Miami's schedule is a lot like tapioca pudding. There are a few bumps here and then1, but it's mostly one large helping of empty calories. Michigan State will provide the Hurricanes with their first test of the year. 
Perles sees this game as an­other big test for his team heading into Big Ten competi­tion. Michigan State has a his­tory of starting slowly because of a tough non-conference schedule, then coming on strong in conference play. 
"Somebody asked me after we played Miami (Ohio) if I'd learned anything," Perles said, referring to his team's 49-0 season-opening victory. "I took the question with a grain of salt but couldn't point out many things. After Notre Dame, we learned a lot about ourselves and our team -posi­tive stuff that should help us this week." 
Michigan State will be without star tailback Blake Ezor, injured with an articular ster­num last weekend. Ilylan Hickson, from Fort Lauderdale 
Holtz 
continued from page 16 
"We play the run well, but we can't play the pass particularly well, so their strengths match up with what seem to be our biggest weaknesses." 
Purdue has allowed an aver­age of 229 passing yards and 143 rushing yards per game. 
Think of your best friend. 
Now, think of your best friend dead. 
Doo't drive drunk. 
Reader's Digest 
(Fla.) Dillard High Sehool (former MSU star Lorenzo White's alma mater) gained 86 yards replacing Ezor last week­end. 
"llylan's very anxious to play, and I expeet him to play well," said Perles. "llylan has big thighs and does a pretty good job of hurdling people and run­ning over people." 
College Football 

The game that attracts the most national attention this weekend may be Colorado's in­tersectional contest with Washington, and not because both teams arc ranked in the Associated Press Top 25. 
Colorado, undefeated and fifth in the nation, will be play­ing its first game since former quarterback Sal Auncse died following a lengthy battle with stomach cancer. 
Washington coach Don James, whose 21st-ranked Huskies are coming off a 20-17 loss to No. 17 Arizona, is wor­ried enough about Colorado's talent, let alone emotion. 
''I've never seen a team that has more big plays in my life," said James. "In their three games, you look at their pass receiving, their rushing, their line -it's unbelievable." 
Auburn fans have seen their national-championship dreams laid to rest the last two times the Tigers visited the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium. 
In the 1985 "Tennessee 
Waltz," the Volunteers trashed 
a top-ranked Auburn team that 
featured eventual llcisman 
Trophy winner Bo Jackson. 
That band of Tigers never re­
covered, finishing 8-4 and out 
of the Top 20. 
When Auburn returned in 
1987, the Vols again surprised 
the Tigers with a tic. That 
game, along with a loss to 
Florida State and the infamous Sugar Bowl tie with Syracuse, were the only blemishes on Auburn's record that year. 

Led by Heggie Slack, perhaps the most underrated quarter­baek in the country, fourth­ranked Auburn makes another visit to Tennessee with national title aspirations this weekend. 
Now that Oklahoma has gone on probation, Houston is taking the Sooners' place as the team that makes a habit of running up huge scores on extremely weak opponents. 
With quarterback Andre Ware directing a run-and-shoot offense, the Cougars have opened this season with a 69-0 pasting of Nevada-Las Vegas and a 36-7 whipping of Arizona State. 
Last season's 9-3 campaign included a 60-0 win over Louisiana Tech, an 82-28 wax­ing of Tulsa and a 66-15 anni­hilation of Texas. 
The beat ligures to go on this Saturday when the Cougars face the Temple Owls. who just might be the worst team in Division 1A footbal this year. 
So far, Temple has lost 31-24 to Western Michigan, 43-3 to Syracuse, 42-3 to a struggling Penn State team and 23-0 to Virginia Tech.
