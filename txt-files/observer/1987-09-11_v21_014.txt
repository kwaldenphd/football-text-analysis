J-Council discusses '87 role 
By ERIC BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
The Judicial Council held an 
organizational meeting for the 
1987-88 school year Thursday 
night. 
Judicial Coordinator Bren­
dan Judge explained that the 
role of the Judicial Council was 
to help students understand 
University rules and to run stu­
dent and class elections in the 
spring. 
The Council is composed of 
each hall's judicial board 
chairperson and an off-campus 
representative. 
The Judicial Council, through the Undergraduate Student Council, also provides legal counsel to students who are ac­cused of university offenses. The Council also represents the accused in proceedings. 
Judge stressed the impor­tance of hall Judicial Boards in hearing cases of students ac­cused of hall offenses by "a jury of their peers." 
Council members were asked to take papers which out­lined the judicial board pPoce­dure. 
Judge encouraged members to inform students charged with off-campus offenses to use the pre-trial diversion program offered by the St. Joseph's County Prosecutor's Office. 

The Council will also dis­tribute Student's Rights Manuals to all students, Judge said. The manual describes student rights pertaining to hall and university offenses, car rights, room rights, and dishonesty. 
Judge requested that each hall representative pick up the manuals from the Council's of­fice this week. 
Council representatives were also asked to sign up for five committees: publicity, Du Lac review, rector relations, stu­dent's rights, and judicial review board selection.

Mister Rogers,host of one of the longest-running children's televsion shows, says he's departing his neighborhood for Mos­cow so he and a Soviet counterpart "can build a little bridge in behalf of children." Fred Rogers is scheduled to leave Sept. 13 for a 12-day visit in Russia to appear on "Good Night, Little Ones." "Children all over the world need to know they can be loved just as they are," Rogers said in Pittsburgh, where his daily program is entering its 20th season on the Public Broadcasting System. 
Ed McMahon must go on trial in a civil lawsuit alleging he was part of a multimillion­dollar-land fraud scheme when he acted as a spokesman for the developers. McMahon, a Los Angeles resident who is best known as Johnny Carson's sidekick on NBC-TV's "Tonight" show, had argued that investors in the project had signed agreements not to sue him. Among other charges, the lawsuit claims that the company and officials mis­represented the actual value of the property.

What if townies turned tables on the students ? 
"Hey, toss me another &*1ng bottle of wine," someone yells. 
It's 3 a.m. and you're in your dormroom trying to fall asleep. But you can1t. 
Ever since those townies moved in next door to your room, sleeping has been nearly impossible. 
Ithappens almost every weekday night. The townies invite their off-campus friends to their dorm parties. At least 100 show up every night. They play lo_ud music-Big Band music, for God's sake. 
"Notre Dame is such a $£%&-hole," one townie says to another. "I can't wait to get out of here." 
You never·do get to sleep that night. 
The next morning, you get up and go out­side. There are dozens of wine and cham­pagne bottles scattered around. You smell a horrible stench -yup, they've thrown up and urinated outside your room again. 
You go to class, where other students are complaining about the townies, too. Like you, they were kept up all night by the parties. 
You take a quiz and get a "D" on it because you're so tired. You vow that this will never happen again. 
That night there's another party, with the accompanying loud music and drunken townies. "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," you say. You call Notre Dame Security. 
About a dozen Security officers show up and the townies scatter. Some are ticketed for dis­orderly conduct; others are handcuffed and taken away. All the townies complain that they're being mistreated by the officers. 
As the party is broken up, you lie in bed thinking about the townie problem. It's not that you hate all the townies. Some of them are kind of nice; they even come on campus and tutor some disadvantaged students. 
And you don't mind an occasional party. But when the parties get out of hand, you feel you have to call Security. You need your sleep. And you hate having to clean up after the parties. 
You think back to better times when you liked living in your dorm. It was quiet. And it still would be -if it weren't for the townies. 
But the townies are getting their just desserts. Fellow Notre Dame students are breaking into the townies' rooms. 
Some students have stolen VCRs and stereos from the townies. Others make it a habit of throwing objects through the the townies' windows. And two students even beat up and robbed a townie. 

"We just live off those guys," you remem­ber one student saying. 
Of course, you don't condone the students' actions. Still, you don't feel sorry for the townies. They can afford to lose a VCR or two. And in a way, they deserve to get a brick thrown through their window. 
The townies, after all, really don't do anyth­ing for the dorm. They just tear it up and make a lot of noise. Then they complain about the area crime or the party busts. 
You'd like to move out of the dorm. But you can't afford another place. Besides, you were here before the townies. It's them who should move out. Not you. 
The next night arrives, and another townie party begins. More noise. More obscenities. More drunks. 
You don't see an end to these parties. When one set of townies leaves, another takes its · place. You're miserable .... 
"Hey, get up," your roommate says. "It's almost time to go." 
You slowly wake up, realizing the whole thing was just a dream,. There are no townies next door; just students. 
"Where are we going?" you ask. "An off-campus party," your roommate replies. "It ought to be £$*ing great."

WASHINGTON -Secretary of State George Shultz, arguing that the alternative is a "com­munist victory" in Nicaragua, said Thursday the administra­tion will ask Congress for $270 million in aid to the Contra rebels for an 18-month period. 
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shultz said additional aid to the Contras is the best insurance that Nicaragua will comply with terms of the Central American peace agreement it signed last month in Guatemala. 
The announcement drew im­mediate criticism from a num­ber of congressional Democrats and is certain to produce another round of

heated debate on Capitol Hill over the administration's Central America policy. 
Shultz said, "If the Guatemalan agreement is to be implemented in a way that secures a negotiated cease­fire, a democratic opening in Nicaragua, and accommoda­tion of basic national security interests... the United States must continue to furnish sup­port to the freedom fighters." 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the aid request will "keep pressure on the Sandi­nistas as we go through the peace process and let them 
know the president is serious 
in his commitment not to desert the resistance." The Guatemala agreement, among other steps, calls on the 

Sandinista government to ar­range a cease fire and imple­ment democratic reform measures by Nov. 7, about five weeks after the current Contra aid allotment expires. It also calls on the United States to cease funding the Contras. 
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has played an in­creasingly influential role in the Central America issue, said it was inappropriate for the ad­ministration to make a request for more Contra money while the peace process was under way.

watch is a "great idea" and said the police would help in any way to get the group started. 
The police not only have to protect the students living in the neighborhood, but also the permanent residents as well. 
But breaking up parties keeps the police from doing their job, Cottrell noted. 
 "Policemen can't be at two places at the same time," he said. 
If students were to calm down parties, Cottrell said, the , police would have more time to 
patrol and fight crime. 

Cottrell also disputed that of­ficers use unethical tactics during party and bar raids. 
When the -police carry out a raid, they have everyone file out and check the person's ID card, Cottrell explained. If the student is over 21, the police cannot arrest the person. But if the person is drunk or "act­ing goofy" the police will be compelled to arrest the stu­dent.

One example of the decline in science knowledge is that more than eight out of 10 U.S. 5th graders and nine out of 10 9th graders in 1970 correctly answered a multiple choice question on how long it takes to travel to the moon. But in 1986, only 47 percent of the 5th graders and 55 percent of the 9th graders chose the correct answer "a few days." 
According to a questionnaire completed by students taking part in the study, 1986 pupils were spending one to two hours less on homework than their 1970 counterparts.

I grew up in the state of Michigan. It is a great state. I would not want to live in too many other places besides Mic­higan. The state really has a lot to offer including great weather and fantastic people. However, it does have one nag­ging fault. 
Brian Broderick 
sincerely yours 
You see, my sister, Colleen, graduated from the University of Mic­higan and many of my cousins and friends have either graduated or are currently attending the University in Ann Arbor. Despite my vehement protests and avid dislike for anything maize and blue, I have lived most of my life in the shadow of Michigan foot­ball. 
Things have not improved much since I have been at Notre Dame, a traditional Michigan rival. My sopho­more year the team traveled to Mic­higan, as did I, only to see us lose a 

reacts to 
close game 20-12. Then last year we beat Michigan in every phase of the game, except the final score 24-23. Needless to say football has not been my favorite subject when at home. Now is my last chance for revenge. 
Allow me to be straightforward, I do not like the University of Michigan or its football team. It is not a typical dis­like, such as one's dis-satisfaction with Tofu vegetables. No it is much more. It is a passionate hate for the school that represents all that is evil in the world. 
Hearing about Bo, his faithful wife Millie and their All-American son Glenn drives one to immediate distrac­tion. I mean who really cares what Bo has for breakfast (by the way it's quiche), and do really have to know how well little Glennie is doing in high school? Ok. Ok. I realize that it is not that bad compared to other states such as Texas or Alabama, where I hear football is a state religion. But if I hear that stupid Hail to the Victors song too many times on Saturday, well I just

won't be able to show my face in the Great Lake State again. 
Wolverines, Wolverines, Wolverines, that is all you ever see or hear. You would think that the school in East Lan­sing was actually located on Mars. Every Sunday morning you wake up to read in the papers of how the 'Wolves' plastered Northwestern 52-0 or how · they demolished Wisconsin 42-0. This happens for about ten straight weeks. Then on January 2, you wake up to see that Bo's boys have choked again (I had to get that in). However, one gleaming moment over the holidays does not make up for the agony of the fall. 
Well this is my last chance. A last gasp at beating the tormentors of the north. Sure I know that it is irrational to get so wrapped up in one college foot­ball game. I know that life will go on no matter what the outcome of Satur­day's game. But, God wouldn't it be fantastic if we trounced the Wolves this weekend and set off the season right? Sure there would still be crime, pes­

tilence and the Ayatollah, but what the hell, we would have at least beaten Mic­higan. 
The stadium holds approximately 106,000 fans. At least 95,000 will be rabid maize (what a corny color) and blue fans. This is not some junior high plea for fan support. It is not a cheer of "let's get rowdy". Instead it is a quest to the north so good will overcome evil. It is a journey to where they have artificial turf so the cheerleaders won't graze. Make it known that Notre Dame is in Ann Arbor Friday night. Let the players know you are there on gameday. On Sunday, wave goodbye knowing that yoll have witnessed an­other stunning upset by the Fighting Irish. Be sure to send your volleys and wake up your echoes, go ahead and even cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame, but most important of all-SHAKE DOWN THE THUNDER! Final Score: Notre Dame 27 Michigan 19.

P.O. Box Q 
Holding class day denies justice 
Dear Editor: 
I find it remarkable that the majority of Notre Dame administrative offices were closed on Labor Day, yet the stu­dents and faculty were required to at­tend classes. What has become of jus­tice? 
Michael A. Schadek Grace Hall 
Generalizations do not match reality 
Dear Editor: 
Regarding the Viewpoint column by Paul Newett in the Sept. 3 edition of The Observer, Mr. Newett makes a lot of unfounded judgements about the Notre Dame student body. I'd like to know where he gets off typifying as "in­corrigible conformists" who are "morally...appallingly alike." And in what crystal ball has this prosaic pes­simist seen us all inevitably sacrificed upon "the altar of commerce?" 
I resent these generalizations, and am insulted by his labeling Notre Dame as "a finishing school for automatons." As for his bleak prediction that the new minority students will either be victims of racism or be "sadly assimilated into the decadence of our generation," (Is our generation more decadent than pre­vious ones?), I hope that if any minority freshmen read that stuff they will dis­miss it as the dreary whine of a dull and uninformed windbag. 
Take a sociology class, Mr. Newett, even though you think electives are "ul­timately pointless." And take a look at the people around you. I honestly think you'll find that your assessment of the student body is unfair, and that we're not all automatons who are being molded by "neofacist professors" to go out and start "stepping on people five days a week." Your article was nothing more than a string of verbose moaning, inspired by your own brand of hypoth­esis: "I wonder who's responsible for 

admitting jerks like him to this univer­
sity."  Stop  calling  us  names,  Mr.  
Newett.

SUB recognizes ticket mistake 
Dear Editor: 
The Student Union Board extends its sincere apologies to the student body, especially those individuals who partic­ipated in the football ticket lottery. We now recognize that an error in judge­ment occurred when preferential treat­ment was received by certain individ­uals. 
We were wrong. 
Though it has been our policy in the past to give special consideration to commissioners' requests for tickets for SUB sponsored and co-sponsored events, we realize we made a mistake in considering football ticket distribu­tion a SUB co-sponsored event. We overstepped our bounds. 
In an attempt to make equitable res­titution to the student body, the tickets that were misallocated will be redistributed. The tickets in question were either left unclaimed yesterday at the Ticket Office and sold to those waiting or were recollected for distri­bution today. Starting at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon the tickets will be redistributed on a first-come, first­serve basis at the Ticket Stub in the basement of LaFortune located next to the Irish Gardens. 
In an effort to prevent this problem fr?m reoccurring, t~e SUB ticket policy wlll be re-exammed and definite measures will be taken to ensure fair ticket distribution in the future. 
It is our hopes that you, the student body, will forgive our poor judgement in this matter. We hope that all of our efforts t~ recti~y this situation will up­hold the mtegnty of the Student Union Board as an organization that is sin­~erely dedicated to enhancing student life by providing social, intellectual, and cultural opportunities.

anchors the Irish line, but his  vides a foundat ion for the e ntire  
87 Co-captains  


Holding down the line 
By ROSE PIETRZAK Sports Writer 
Chuck Lanza and Byron Spruell have heard the same questions over and over again. So often, in fact, they repeat each other's responses. Lanza and Spruell have become quite accustomed to being a pair, as the two are the co-captains for the 1987 season and will lead Notre Dame's offensive line as well as the rest of the team. The fifth-year starters, Lanza at center and Spruell at tackle, are hoping for a successful season and a chance to play in a January 1 bowl. 
The similarities, however, end there. Defining himself as the "silent leader," Spruell quickly points out the differ­ences between the two. 
''Chuck is more outspoken and physical than I am, but the guys know that I am there for them," Spruell says. "This leadership position is a very re­sponsible one. We have to rep­resent the team well and add that extra motivation. I think that we are both reliable, decent players who can get the job done." 
The road to the top, though, was challenging and full of doubts. The valedictorian of his high school class, Spruell struggled through his fresh­men engineering courses and found the transition year very difficult. "I came to Notre Dame because it offered the best of academics and athletics at the highest possible level. It was the best choice I could have made." 
A May '87 graduate, Spruell has several options to consider. 
"I would like to go into pro football, but I am going to pursue my MBA, and I have some opportunities lined up in manufacturing management." 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz says that Spruell is the epitomy of the Notre Dame student ath­lete. 
"Spruell is an excellent player," says Holtz. "He's solid, he's got above a 3.0 average in engineering -just everything you want in a young man. If there has ever been a young man who depicted what Notre Dame football is all about, it's Byron Spruell." 
Coming a long way on the same rough road, Lanza suf­fered through an injury-ridden freshman year and returned to the playing field as a third­string center behind all­American Mike Kelley and Ron Plantz. The sociology major found no relief in his school­work and was frustrated in his athletic endeavors. But with harder times behind him, Lanza is dedicating his final season to his late mother, Dolores. With tremendous sup­port from his family and hard work, Lanza was able to attain his position. 
"Playing behind Mike Kelley and Ron Plantz only made me more appreciative of where I am today," says Lanza. "I learned a lot from them on my way to becoming a starter, and it's definitely made me a better player. I think every player should pay his dues before walking onto the field as a starter. I was a prep team

Foundations of the legend 
Editor's Note -This is the first of a series looking at some of the highlights, and lowlights, of the 100 years of football at Notre Dame. The series will run in each issue of Irish Extra. 
Notre Dame football. To many sports fans,. Notre Dame football is the essence of college athletics. In­credible success, intense rivalries, miraculous com­ebacks and some of the game's flashiest, most prolific performers have made the Fighting Irish synonymous with great foot­ball tradition. 
100 Years of Irish Football 
PETE SKIKO 

One hundred years ago, on November 23, 1887, that tradition got off to a seemingly rocky start when a group of students from Michigan University took a train to South Bend, toured the campus, shut out the Irish, 8-0, and headed back to Ann Arbor. Who would have thought back then that Notre Dame, with that loss, would begin the most suc­cessful college football pro­gram for the next hundred years? 
Throughout those last hundred years, that tradi­tion has been molded, of course, by the Notre Dame students, whose heroics on Saturday afternoons have captivated the nation. The tradition has been shaped by coaches  from the immortal Knute Rockne to the enig­matic Lou Holtz, the coaches of Notre Dame have been as successful and, in some cases, as legendary as any in the country. 
But the tradition has also largely been formed around the fans, who have been clamoring for tickets to see the Irish in action since the turn of the century. Quickly,

college football supporters came to appreciate Notre Dame's gritty, all-out style and their ability to get up for the big games, characteris­tics that hold true today. 
The success of the football team, combined with the na­tional attention it it has ac­quired through its upsets of top-ranked teams, has made the Irish Guard, the "Touch­down Jesus", the Leprec­haun, and the Notre Dame Victory March familiar to even the most casual college grid fan. What may not be familiar to even the most staunch follower of the Irish, however, is just how many individual and team NCAA records Notre Dame holds. 

est winning percentage of any college football team (.755) with a 651-198-40 record. The Irish have won more national champion­ships, seven, than any other school. No other school boasts more Heisman Trophy winners than Notre Dame, which has six. The Irish have fielded 23 unani­mous first-team All­Americans, more than any other school, and the all­time winning percentages of Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy remain the two high­est in college football his­tory. Notre Dame's gradua­tion rateis better than 98 percent among its football players. The national marks go on and on. 
But the Founding Fathers of Notre Dame football had to make sacrifices in order to get the tradition rolling. During the days of no hel­mets, limited transportation funds, and ridiculously lop­sided contests, Irish oppo­nents didn't face many of the top-ranked teams of the day. During the years 1887-1900, the Irish would play

player for two years. I've paid the price. I've earned my position." Holtz says that having Lanza as an '87 co-captain was a good choice. 
"I think Chuck Lanza is an excellent player at center," says Holtz. "I'm al­ways encouraged any time offensive lineman, such as Lanza and Spruell, are voted captains. Your linemen are

By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -This time, there are no surprises. 
One year ago, Irish head coach Lou Holtz showed the Michigan Wolverines what they did not want to see in the 1986 season opener. Holtz' Notre Dame football squad was flashy, unpredicta­ble and, most importantly, able to move the ball against its nationally-ranked foes. 
And even though Michigan sqeaked out a 24-23 victory at Notre Dame Stadium, Holtz showed the nation that the Irish were back. In fact, his un­ranked squad moved into the 20th spot in the Associated Press poll following the loss. 
This Saturday afternoon at Michigan Stadium (3:30 EDT, 2:30 South Bend time), the Wolverines know what to ex­pect. 
"We will have no surprise this time," Holtz said. "Our offense is one geared at utilizing the talents that individuals have, and we have many of the same people back from last year. 
"If you're a good football team, I don't think surprise is really that im­portant with offense. We were success­ful last year because we were able to do things on a consistent basis to dis­rupt the University of Michigan." 
But in the end, it was a controversial call in the end zone and a missed field goal in the game's waning seconds that eventually disrupted Notre Dame. And the loss was the first of five suffered by the Irish in close games last season. 
This year, Holtz is cautious in promis­ing a good start. 
"I just want to emphasize how im­portant this game is for us," he said. "It's probably more important to us than it is to Michigan because we're not in a conference. But I'm not real sure how we're going to respond on the road, on artificial turf and in a game situation. I think we'll respond well, but there's just no way I can say until Sat­urday. 
"We're just going to look forward to it, go up there and do the best we can. I'm really anxious to see how our team responds." 
And after all the hype, all the specula­tion and all the waiting, Holtz is not the only one anxious for tomorrow after­noon. 
Notre Dame offense vs. Michigan defense 
If Michigan knows what to expect from the Irish, it also should know who to fear when Notre Dame has the ball -senior flanker Tim Brown. 
Michigan's offensive line averages al­most 280 pounds per man. Sporting News called It the biggest In the nation.

"When Tim is in the backfield, Mic­higan knows he's not back there to block," Holtz said of his Reisman Trophy candidate. "And when he's at flanker, they're probably going to double-cover him. We're going to try to get the ball into Timmy's hands as much as we can, and we should be able to use the fact that they'll key on him to free up some of our other people." 
To do that, senior quarterback Terry Andrysiak will have to pick apart a traditionally-strong Wolverine defense. Holtz said he is pleased with the prog­ress his starter has made over the past two weeks, and hopes Andrysiak handles himself as well tomorrow as he has in recent practices. 
Notre Dame co-captain and starting center Chuck Lanza might miss the en­tire game with a sprained shoulder, but the rest of the trenches seem to favor the Irish (at least in terms of size) against a smaller Michigan defensive line. That should mean a few holes for the Irish tailbacks and fullbacks, and with the talent in the Notre Dame back­field, expect a lot of shuffling at those positions. 
Defensively, Michigan coach Bo Schembechler says his linemen and linebackers are the strengths of his unit. 
One of the Big Ten's top linemen, senior tackle Mark Messner, returns this season, with junior Brent White back at the other tackle position. Causing Notre Dame's questionable center position trouble at middle guard will be sophomore Mike Teeter. 
The Wolverines' second-leading tack­ler in 1986, senior inside linebacker Andree Mcintyre, and sophomore out­side linebacker Tim Williams return to spark an impressive corps of 'backers. 
The secondary is relatively inexper­ienced, but Schembechler and the Wol­verine coaching staff have worked hard all fall in that area.

improved tremendously. She's not the same player I first saw. She's also in there vying for a position on the team." 
Of course, Gelfman is also happy with the freshmen, which she hopes are a sign of things to come in Notre Dame recruiting. 

"We've gotten progressively better in recruiting, and I feel all the recruits I've brought in the last two years have helped," said Gelfman. "Cahill's an obvious plus for the program. It shows that even though the academic standards are high, we can recruit the top players." 
Another newcomer to the wo­men's tennis program is assis­tant coach Mike Owens, a gen­eral manager and pro at Elkhart Racquet Club. An as­sistant coach will be needed as the roster this year has ex­panded to 13 players. 
The starting lineup for Satur­day's season-opening match with North Star Conference rival Northern Illinois includes Cahill at the top seed, followed by Tolstedt, senior Michelle Dasso, Lohrer, Pacella, and Kelly. The doubles teams, with seeds not yet definite, will be Lohrer and Dasso, Tolstedt and Cahill, and Pacella and Illig. The 2 p.m. match will be held at Courtney Courts. Inclimate weather will send the dual match indoors to the newly­constructed Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
The Irish have cut back their fall schedule to include two dual meets and three tourna­ments. The short fall season marks a contrast to the ex­tended spring slate, which will start in late January and in­clude dates with Ivy League teams and Western schools. 
"I wanted tne mcommg freshmen to get well adjusted, so when we move into the second semester, they'll be ready and know what to ex­pect," said Gelfman.

Sternberg is the leader at midfield for the Irish, known for his steady, mistake-free play. But it was against In­diana last season when he made one of those rare mis­takes. He gave up the ball in his own penalty area to In­diana's Chris Keenan, who passed it to John Johnson for a goal. 
This year will be different, Sternberg predicts. ''This time we have the tal­ent," h~ says. "We're playing

with a lot of confidence. I don't think we're going to back down this time." 
Johnson, Keenan and Rod Castro, the three top scorers for Indiana last season, all have graduated. Nonetheless the Hoosiers are looking as tough as ever. Indiana "suf­fered" through a 9-6-4 record in 1986, far below the standard of past Yeagely teams, so Yeagely has recruited a very talented freshman class which includes four high school all­Americans. 
Junior forward Pete Stoyanovich is the top return­ing scorer, collecting six goals in 14 games. Stoyanovich also happens to be the placekicker for the Indiana football squad. 
With four starters graduated from the midfield and back pos­itions, Yeagley has shuffled his lineup around and has started three freshmen. Freshman Ken Snow connected for both goals in the Hoosiers 2-1 victory over sixth-ranked Southern Methodist in the Ad-
Associated Press 
didasMetropolitan Life Classic 
at Bloomington. 
Depending on the results of tonight's Indiana-Michigan State match at Bloomington, the Hoosiers will come to South Bend with either a winning or losing record. Indiana lost to second-ranked South Carolina in the first game of the tourn­ament, 3-1, before edging the Mustangs. 
Thanks to the Labor Day holiday, no poll was taken for the Great Lakes region, meaning Indiana remains the fourth-ranked team in the region behind Akron, Evansville and Marquette. The Irish are ranked lOth. 
Although the Hoosiers ap­pear to be back on the winning track, they gradually have been changing their attitude toward Notre Dame. The coaches have been very inter­ested in Notre Dame's progress this season, noting such things · as the scoring outburst by for­ward Randy Morris and the· general progress of the team.

The Indiana coaches can't 
like what they've heard. The 
Irish ran their record to 4-0 
with two victories over Detroit 
and Western Michigan. The 7-1 
shelacking of Titans was espe­
cially satisfying for the team. 
"We were coming off the first two games where they could have easily been losses," said Grace. "We just took it out on them. We could have very easily scored in double digits ­we missed more scoring chances than we scored." 
Despite shutting out the Broncos in Wednesday's 2-0 victory, Grace was not happy with the team's performance and takes the blame himself. 
"Western Michigan had the better of us for a while," said Grace. "We just weren't prepared for the artificial turf. I thought we were going to play on grass, so I didn't get the team ready. I'll take the blame for that." 
The turf also helped to create a boring game as the ball kept rolling out of bounds. Only six shots were taken the entire game by both teams. 
So once again the Irish enter the Indiana match with a spot­less record. A big match this early in the season can dictate the rest of the year. But can the Irish also change the course of the series with Indiana? Grace is optimistic. 
"I expect to give IU every­thing they can handle," said Grace. "I feel good about Sun-­day. IU will play well, and we will too. But I'll tell you, the kids really have a lot of confi­dence."

Edberg 1n sem1s 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Second-seeded 

Stefan Edberg used a blistering 
serve-and-volley attack to 
overpower unseeded Rarnesh 
Krishnan 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 Thursday 
and move into the semifinals of 
the U.S. Open tennis champion­
ships for the second straight 
year. 
Krishnan's finesse game was 

no match for Edberg's assault. 
"Right from the beginning, 

he was all over me," said 
Krishnan, the last unseeded 
player left in singles play. 
"We were always fighting it 

out on my serve. I thought I 
was very well prepared. I 
played the way I wanted to, but 
I thought he was a little bit 
quicker on the court." 
Edberg needed five sets to 

beat Krishnan in the third 
round at last year's Open. 
"I think I've improved as a 

player since then," the 21-year­
old Swede said. "I started off 
Guignon 
continued from page 16 
freshman year. And by the 
time he graduates, I am confi­
dent that he will be one of the 
best players in the country." 
Guignon assumed the role of 

stopper his sophomore season, 
starting all 22 games and corn­
piling 15 points on five goals 
and five assists. He was also a 
leader on the defense which al­
lowed only 1.14 goals a game. 
"The team really responds 

when Johnny has something to 
say," added Grace. "He's a 
good soccer player and has a 
good soccer mind. But I think 
that his work ethic, attitude 
and his character are his 
greatest points.'' 
Guignon enjoys his position 

as junior captain this season, 
but he is quick to add that the 
team as a whole is more im­
portant than any individual.

The highlight of the match was the 24-rninute, 38-point third game of the second set. Krishnan had seven game points, but Edberg ended up winning the game to take a 3-0 lead, 
Krishnan, ranked 42nd in the world, said he was pleased with his showing in the tournament.

Strike won't stop season 

TI advanced scientifics have all the right engineering and science functions to help you function better in school. When we set out to make our most 
advanced scientific calculators, we gave a lot of thought to what your 
see us is a good sign," said Dan Rooney, president of the Pit­tsburgh Steelers and another executive committee member. "I believe that Gene doesn't want a strike." 
Donlan said that 19 of the 28 teams had already signed players for use in the event of a strike. And while he said he wasn't preoccupied with that issue -"I want to find a settle­ment," he said-he felt the union had forced the owners' hand. 
Some teams gave players who were cut a $1,000 retainer to be available should they be needed in the event of a strike. 
A small number of roster players have said they prob­ably would play even if their teammates struck-among them San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil. 
Associated Press 
SCHAUMBURG, 11.-NFL owners voted unanimously Thursday to continue the season even if the players strike, using already discarded free agents and "whatever players are available to play." 
At the same time, however, Jack Donlan, executive direc­tor of the Managment Council, announced that negotiations with the NFL players Associa­tion will resume Saturday at a site still to be determined. 
He also disclosed that Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, had met Wednes­day night with Commissioner Pete Rozelle and flew to Chicago Thursday morning to meet with the Management Council's executive commmit­tee. 
The two sides have met for just 4 l!2 hours since Aug. 14. Talks on Sept. 2 were broken off over the issue of protection for player representatives. The contract expired Aug. 31 and the players have voted to strike Sept. 22, after the second week of the season, unless substan­
tial progress is made toward resolution of the dispute. The major issue remains free agency. 
The players are seeking a system that would allow players to move from team to team without any kind of com­pensation or right of first refusal. 
The owners are willing only to liberalize the current sys­tem, which requires a team sig­ning a free agent to provide compensation. Just one player in 10 years has changed teams under that system. 
None of the owners present would characterize the meeting with Upshaw or dis­cuss Upshaw's meeting with Rozelle, who was not present at Thursday's session. 
But Hugh Culverhouse, owner of the Tampa Bay Buc­caneers and the chairman of the Management Council's ex­ecutive committee, termed Up­shaw's presence "worthwhile." 
"I'm the eternal optimist," he added. "I think the fact that Gene took the time to come here and

Maturity key for ND runners 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team travels to Wash­ington, D.C., for a dual meet against Georgetown on Satur­day. 
The 1986 season was a little disappointing for coach Joe Piane and his harriers. They had great potential yet never seemed to consistently live up to it. The highlights were a third-place finish in the Indiana 
Intercollegiates  and  a  fifth­ 
place  finish  in  the  National  
Catholic Meet.  

Maturity will be the big dif­ference this year. Piane will have all his top runners back along with a new crop of fresh­man. If the team can avoid in­juries and remain consistent, 1987 could be a banner year for the Irish. 
But that won't be easy. 

The Irish runners face one of their toughest schedules in years. After opening at Geor­getown, they return home for the National Catholic Meet and the Notre Dame Invitational. Then it's off to the Indiana In­tercollegiates, the NCAA Dis­trict IV Meet and possibly the NCAA Championships in Char­lottesville, Va. 
The Irish also have a dual meet against USC slated on the Burke Memorial Course. 
Besides overcoming this tough schedule, the Irish must also avoid the nagging injuries that plagued them all through last year. 
"Last year we had a lot of runners come into school with injuries," Piane said. "This year I think we've avoided that. Mike O'Connor is as healthy as ever. Mike Rogan is looking solid, and Ron Markezich is in the best condition of his life." 
O'Connor was the top Irish runner last year. Last season the sophomore placed first for the Irish in all but one race last season. 
''Georgetown will be a tough meet," O'Connor said. "I'm from New York and know a lot of people on the Georgetown team. If we avoid injuries we can win and go on to a great year." 
''I don't think O'Connor will be the first ND runner to finish all the meets this year," Piane said. "At least, I hope he's not. The key to a well-balanced team is to have six or seven different guys coming in as number one for the Irish in dif­ferent meets. That can make us a great team." 
The Irish captain this year is senior Dan Garrett. Garrett has been injury free and active all year. Piane and his harriers will look for help from the in­coming freshman, led by the promising Pat Kearns. 
Georgetown has one of the top Catholic cross country squads in the country. It won the Big East last year and set a world record in the distance medley relay. Piane knows the Irish face a tough foe. 
"Right now the two words to describe Georgetown are very good," Piane said." They have one of the top 800-meter teams in the country. Most of the run­ners fron Notre Dame were recruited by Georgetown, so there is a rivalry."
