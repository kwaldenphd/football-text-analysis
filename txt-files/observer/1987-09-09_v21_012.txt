I'm a Seuss fan, and I'm willing to admit it. 
When I showed up at Notre Dame and started preaching Seuss, people thought I was a bit off the wall. Undaunted, I continued, at parties, at dances, in the privacy of my own room, to show the world, or at least my unsuspecting room­mates, that Seuss goes "On Beyond Zebra," past Mulberry Street, and down into Whoville for a reason. 
Seuss's mission is to educate children before they become obsolete, i.e. adults. 
First of all, Seuss calls for children to imag­ine, to use those little heads that are now blocked by the Smurfs and the Laser Tag Academy on Saturday morning cartoons. 
Even the alphabet is not limited for Seuss. In "On Beyond Zebra," Seuss writes of "Conrad Cornelius O'Donald O'Dell I My very young friend who is learning to spell." At first, Little Conrad is convinced that the alphabet ends with the traditional z. He later uses his imagination to learn of a world beyond "zebra," to words like Yuzz-a-ma-tuzz, and "two brothers called VROOMS!Who strangely enough, are built sort of like brooms." The second of Seuss' focal points is the idea that children can, and must, save the world from the disasters that adults create. In three of my favorite books, Dr. Seuss addresses the issues of prejudice, abortion, and the arms race. 
In the short story "Sneetches," Seuss writes of the problems between the Star-bellied Sneetches and the plain-bellied Sneetches. The stars are minor in size, but major in sig­nificance. It is socially unacceptable to have a plain belly. The plain-bellied Sneetches concoct a method for putting stars on their stomachs so that they too will be accepted. The Star­bellied Sneetches promptly remove their stars and declare plain bellies as the way of life. This cycle continues until they all realize just how ridiculous the controversy has been. 
In the since-televised "Horton Hears a Who," Seuss addresses the issue of abortion. Horton, the friendly elephant, hears voices inside a dust speck he has picked up. Horton vows to protect the people inside the dust speck because, "A person's a person, no matter how small." Hor­ton has to battle the evil Wickersham brothers, who threaten to "boil that dust speck" because they don't see any people in it. In the end, the people in the dust spect call for help just loud enough, and the Wickersham brothers to leave the dust speck alone. 
In his most recent children's book, "The But­ter Battle Book," Seuss talks of avoiding the 
Jim Winkler 
Day Chief 

nuclear arms race. In the end, Seuss leaves the ultimate salvation up to the children. 
In "The Butter Battle Book," Seuss tells the tale of the Zooks and the Yooks, lifelong enemies. Their feud is based on the fact that they differ on which side of bread to butter. This has escalated into a cold war of sorts, com­plete with an arms race that ends up ultimately with the Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo, which, like our nuclear warheads, has the ability to destroy the entire opposition. Of course, both sides pos­sess one. The story ends with a young boy (again) waiting to see whether his grandpa or the enemy Vanltch will drop the Boomeroo first. Grandpa responds, in Seuss' voice, "We will see. We will see ..." 
Dr. Seuss has always been a favorite of children, ever since he removed the boring "See Dick run" from children's literature. His cre­ative rhyme schemes entertainingly carry the messages that he preaches. 
Next time you watch the Grinch "steal" materialism from Christmas, remember that Seuss is more than Cindy Lou Who and Max the dog. It is a lesson for children, and the rest of us, which lasts forever.

Even though the dogbook could have eventually been completed, the earliest possi­ble date would have been some­time in December. Fitzgibbon decided to cancel the contract because of the redundancy of having the class's junior dog­book come out in December fol­photographer's fee. Even though the money intended for the ill-fated dogbooks was kept in an account, the senior class made it clear that they received no interest on the funds because the account is controlled by the administra­tion.

Dense smoke hinders firefighters progress 
Associated Press 
Firefighters made slow but steady progress Tuesday against huge forest fires still burning out of control in the West, but a "gray murk" of smoke sickened some of them, kept trucks from hauling their gear and grounded aircraft. 
About 1,000 people were still unable to return to their homes in California because of fire danger. Army infantrymen traded rifles for hoes and shovels to mop up fires in Oregon. 
More than 1,000 square miles of brush and timber have burned in eight Western states since lightning began setting hundreds of fires on Aug. 28. 
"We've always been thankful we don't have hurricanes, tor­nadoes or stuff like that," said Jim Baxter, a timber sales ad­m1mstrator for national forests at Weaverville, Calif. "But now we got our own homegrown nat­ural disaster." 
More than 1,000 fires had burned over 519,000 acres in northern California, and nearly 111,000 acres were blackened in southern Oregon. 
Combined with 30,000 acres charred in Idaho, and smaller fires in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming, fires had blazed across 670,700 acres, or 1,048 square miles. 
In addition to the Western fires, 10,000 acres of grass and trees had burned on the island of Hawaii in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Some firefighters from California were sent to help halt that fire. 
Sunbelt 
prepares for pope 
AssocdPss 

The Sunbelt cities that will greet Pope John Paul II bustled with activity Tues­day, as Miami's archbishop blessed a rosary dangling from a skyscraper, workers spruced up the streets of Co­lumbia, S.C., and crews decorated a huge outdoor al­tar in San Antonio, Texas. 
Everywhere along the pontiff's route, plans were being completed for the tightest possible security. Police, National Guardsmen and Secret Service agents were arranging to divert rush-hour traffic, weld man­holes shut, station sharpshooters on roofs and even make airliners change course. 
"This will certainly be the biggest combined law en­forcment effort: in South Florida's history," said Jack Kippenberger, special agent in charge of Miami's Secret Service office. 
The pope arrives in Miami on Thursday afternoon for a 10-day tour of nine cities. From Miami, he flies to Co­lumbia, then New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, Ariz., Los Angeles, Monterey, Calif., and San Francisco. His final U.S. stop is-in Detroit, but before heading back to Rome, he will visit Fort Simpson in Canada's Northwest Territories on Sept. 20. 
In Miami on Tuesday, Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy blessed the rosary draping The Falls, a downtown office building just north of the route the pope's bulletproof car will follow Thursday. 
Earlier in the day, Cuban exile activists delivered a parchment petition with replicas of 70,000 signatures to the archdiocese. Roberto Pimental of Cubanos Dester­rados (Cubans without a home) said the petition urges the pope to lash out at Cuban President Fidel Castro's persecution of the Roman Catholic Church. 
In Columbia, city workers have trimmed trees, .cut grass and repaved streets along the pope's motorcade route from the airport to the University of South Carolina football stadium.

Fourteen new faculty mem­bers join the staffs of thirteen different departments at St. Mary's College this semester. 
"The number (of new faculty members) was not unusually high," according to Charlotte West, a spokesperson from the office of the Dean of Faculty at St. Mary's. 
"About one-third of the new faculty is temporarily replac­ing permanent professors who are on sabatical or maternity leave. One-fourth of those hired fill empty positions in different departments," said West. She added, "The balance is just the normal amount of turnover, from teachers coming and going." 
The Department of Govern­ment has two new faculty members, Garry-Eoghin Jen­nings and Robert Ladrech. 
Jennings, an instructor, is a graduate of the University of Maryland, where he has taught for the past five years.

Gulf quiet, diplomats busy 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -War enemies Iran and Iraq ob­served an informal cease-fire in the Persian Gulf for a third day Tuesday after both sides attacked nearly two dozen ships in one of the fiercest weeks in the tanker war. 
Diplomats said the lull was directly tied to the peace initia­tive of U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar. They

Associated Press 
MARACAY, Venezuela -Ci­vilian volunteers joined troops and civil defense units Tuesday in the search for survivors of a 10-foot-deep tide of mud that swept hundreds of cars off a mountain road. 
No official casualty figures have been released. Unofficial reports said there were 150 known dead in the mudslide and floods, 250 missing, 1,000 people injured and 20,000 home­less. 
The mudslide roared down the mountain Sunday after tor­rential rains, wiping out three miles of the road. 
Col. Hector Vargas, who was involved with the army rescue effort, pointed into the moun­tains in the direction of the road and said: "It is a very ugly dis­aster. There must be plenty of dead still up there." 
Army helicopters carried food and medical supplies to the stricken area. 
Families were caught re­turning home from outings when tons of mud, boulders and uprooted trees swept across the highway that runs through the mountains between Maracay and the beach resort of Ocumare de Ia Costa on Venezuela's central coast. 
Luis Mora, a survivor, said a crowded bus was swept over the edge as people tried to sqirm through its windows, and a woman he was trying to save was torn from his grasp. 
"I saw arms sticking out of the mud from some of the buried cars," he said. An esti­mated 200 cars and several buses were buried or trapped by the mudslide. 
Giuseppe Morelda said: "Trees started falling, and you could see the mud arriving. I saw dead people all over." 
Carlos Tablante, who is a member of the national congress and survived the slide, said long lines of vehicles had been created by the col­lapse of a bridge. 
During heavy rain at about 4 p.m., he said, the earth shook and "a slide of clay and rocks rushed down from the top of the 
Correction 
The time of the reception for Father Edward Malloy's in­auguration was incorrectly reported in Tuesday's paper. The reception will be held Sept. 23 at 5:30 p.m. on South Quad, according to the inauguration committee. 
The diplomats insisted on anonymity. 
A dispute between Iran and Kuwait escalated, meanwhile, with claims by Iran that offi­cials in Kuwait were harassing Iranian immigrants there and had ordered the expulsion of a sixth Iranian diplomat. 
In the gulf, shipping sources said there appeared to be more vessel movements than usual 
as companies took advantage
of the pause in the 3-year-old raids on commercial shipping. 
Iraq, at war with Iran since September 1980, strikes at ships carrying Iranian oil to hurt Iran economically and force it to the peace table. Iran strikes at other shipping, saying if the gulf is not safe for its vessels it will not be safe for anybody's ships. 
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Premier Nikoai Ryzhkov urged an im­mediate end to the gulf war and criticized the U.S. presence there during meetings Tuesday

Police raids bind the Constitution 
For about the last eight months, the South Bend Police in connection with the Indiana State Police and Indiana Excise Police have been participating in the annoying practice of raiding off­campus parties. These raids are con­ducted under the premise that minors are illegally consuming alcohol and thus threatening public safety. It is true that there were two fatal traffic acci­dents last fall involving both Notre Dame students and alcohol, but is this grounds to infringe upon the constitu­tional rights of all Notre Dame stu­dents? 
Ray Markovich 
guest column 
On Oct. 31, 1986 at approximately 11 p.m., a party at 617 North St. Peter Street in South Bend, Indiana was raided by the South Bend Police, In­diana State Police, and Indiana State Excise Police. It was a Halloween cos­tume party with about 100 guests. A resident of the house was collecting two dollars at the door to help finance the cost of the party. At about 10:30 p.m., an undercover Excise Officer entered the party dressed as a student and was promptly charged two dollars for a cup. He was uninvited and only allowed to enter the house because the resident who had been collecting money had gone to the washroom. A friend had taken over the task and sold the cop a cup. 
At about 11 p.m., eight squad cars and a paddywagon pulled up in front of the house and sealed off all exit routes. They then called a resident of the house to the door and told him that everyone would have to leave and that they would be checking ID's at the door. Many stu­dents jumped out of windows or ran out the back door to avoid the police check point. I, being a resident, stayed in the house figuring that there was no way that I'd be issued a ticket in my own home. I was wrong. Whatever hap­pened to the old adage "A man's home is his castle?" The cops made me come out of the house, asked me my age, and finding that I was only 20 years old, they told me to take a breathalyzer. I refused the test and told them that I would take the ticket and see them in court. 
Research was done and the following was found regarding my position: Amendment IV (1791) -The right of 
Doonesbury 
HOtii?AY? 
the people to be secure in their persons, houses and effects, against unreasona­ble searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 
Amendment V (1791) -No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of War or -ublic danger; nor shall any person be _.tbject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 
Amendment VI (1791) -In all cri­minal prosec4tions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be con­fronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtain­ing witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. 
Amendment X (1791) -The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 
I went to court at eight on a Monday morning. There were many cases that day so I had to check in and wait my turn. In front of me were cases dealing with drunk driving and speeding. My particular case seemed rather insig­nificant in light of these other crimes. I was fairly well-prepared to face the judge and waited anxiously. Realizing my Fifth Amendment right allowing me to avoid self-incrimination through personal testimony, I was prepared to decline taking the witness stand. As I saw it, the police officer did not see me drinking and I had not failed a breat­halyzer test so there was no concrete evidence to prove my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. With only the arrest­ing officer as a witness, I believed that my crime lacked sufficient evidence for conviction. I am not saying that I was innocent because I was in fact drinking, but only that the state could not prove my guilt. A plea of not guilty does not mean that you are innocent. It means that you do not believe that the state can prove your guilt. My turn to appear before the judge finally came. I ap­proached the bench and was asked to verify my age, name, and address. I handed the judge my sheet explaining by rights and signed to acknowledge my plea of not guilty. He then asked me if I understood the English language and if I understood that I had pleaded not guilty. I said yes and was given a trial date in late March. 
I arrived at court on March 30, 1987 at 10 a.m. Once again, I checked in and took a seat. I heard a few cases before me and waited anxiously for my turn. I didn't see the arresting officer in the crowd. The Sixth Amendment guaran­tees one the right to be confronted by witnesses against him. So if the police officer does not appear in court, the prosecution will be compelled to drop the case. I was called to the bench and told that because the officer did not ap­pear, the prosecution would drop the charges against me. I had won. I had saved myself a $50 fine and approxi­mately $20 in court costs. 
The primary question in this case is the availability of concrete evidence. Without this, no man may be convicted. 
Since most off-campus parties are raided in this manner, it seems that definite evidence is usually lacking. This would lead one to conclude that :many students currently being con­victed of underage drinking could avoid conviction by pursuing a formal trial. If many students pleaded not guilty, the courts would become overloaded and judicial pressure probably would 
reduce police raids.  From  this,  one  
should  reason  that  all  students  not  
caught red-handed should  plead  not  

guilty. Who knows, maybe their cop won't show either. 
The overall question is whether or not these raids are constitutional. It places the Fourth and lOth Amendments in conflict. The Fourth Amendment protects one against unreasonable searches. The lOth Amendment gives States the right to control that which is 
not monitored by the federal govern­ment. Which is more important, privacy or public safety? That question probably depends upon which side of the fence you are on. Those not having the parties would shy toward the public safety. Those having the parties would favor privacy. From this, I conclude that the whole concept of police raids is a touchy subject that a higher court must address.

P.O. Box Q 
Homogeneity need not be a liability 
Dear Editor: 
In his September 3 Viewpoint article, Paul Newett condemns the homogeneity of the Notre Dame campus. I agree 100 percent that one can learn a great deal from a fellow student who is coming from a different background. However, homogeneity is not necessarily bad in all respects. If all Notre Dame students held the selfish attitudes which Mr. Newett contends we do, this would be a sorry place indeed, but in fact the similarities which this student body does possess gives Notre Dame a strength of char­acter unparallelled at any place I know. 
Newett's final point is a quote from Pascal: "It is a monstrous thing to see 
Trudeau 
one and the same heart at once so sensi­tive to minor things and so strangely insensitive to the greatest." Students here do tackle the "greatest" issues, and Notre Dame has and will continue to produce truly great men and women. But for most of us, the final analysis and true worth of our education is not in trying to make a living, but in trying to make our own lives worth living. We do not have to save the world. That was done 2000 years ago. It is the "minor" things like helping a classmate, serving food in a soup kitchen and raising a good family which truly matter. If there is homogeneity at Notre Dame, it is the common bond of service to one another and to the world in which we live. This is a homogeneity of which I am immensely proud.

A new fight song? 

THERESA LOOMIS accent writer 
P
aula and Peter Abowd, a sophomore and a senior respectively, came up with a creative way In which to celebrate this year's IOOth an­niversary of Notre Dame foot­ball. By the time this article comes to print, the tribute song they recorded, "I 00 Years," should be available in the bookstore. 
They were not alone in their endeavor; their father, an uncle, and eight brothers and sisters all have graduated from Notre Dame. During the past summer both Paula and Peter, Michigan natives, were working for their brother Anthony at his company, A+ Music, in North Carolina. Peter has been a foot­bail trainer for four years and had been thinking of writing a song ever since Lou Holtz be­came coach. Near the end of July his idea took shape, and Anthony produced the song. Recording was done in Gas­tonia, North Carolina where David, another brother, has a studio at his store, Music City. The Abowds then took the tape to Reflections In Charlotte, North Carolina to mix the tracks and create a master tape. 
Sine~ the Abowds wanted the records available for the first football game, they had to have It produced and pressed within one month. Instead of sending the record to an outlet which would complete the process but take a long time, they personally went to each place to have their record mas­tered, laquered, and test pressed. By watching each step themselves, the Abowds sped up the process significantly. 
Peter, who has been writing songs for seven years and has performed on campus during the last three years, is major­ing in electrical engineering with a computer option. He has also been conducting research on technical applications In­volving sending messages from a computer to a synthesizer and has definitely put his back­ground to use on this project. 
Peter explained that the in­strumentation was produced with computer driven samplers and synthesizers in col1]unctlon with live guitar. He describes the song as "a contemporary pop tune aimed at catching the flavor of modern music," something a bit newer to com-
Calvin and Hobbes 
plement the more traditional and established school marches. "It's a pseudo fight song --catchy enough for people to hum and sing." 
Paula, whose title was pro­duction assistant, also got a good deal of experience for her math, computing, and commu­nications interests. She worked with the public relations aspect as well and did a lot of phone calling. She says, "The network affiliates have copies and are very much interested." 
Paula regards her brother, who has already copyrighted an album's worth of material, as an accomplished musician. "''m probably his biggest fan," she admits. Sophomores Kristie Bunty and Sue Hatch agree. "Peter is a very talented songwriter, and his record cap­tures the spirit of this year's football season." 
Looking toward the future, Paula says, "I wouldn't hesitate to record another record. It would probably be a lot easier. We had many late nights and can sing It in our sleep. The experience was a nice opportu­nity, since ND has been a big part of our lives." 
The rest of the Abowd family, stretching from coast to coast, is continuing their involvement by promoting the record which the Alumni Association has en­dorsed as a scholarship fund­raiser. The profit the clubs make from sales will be put into their respective scholar­ship funds. 
On campus, St. Ed's and Walsh Halls will be selling the record with help from student government. Profits will be used by those dorms for their own interests and also to pro­vide campus activities that will boost spirit and enthusiasm. As Paula points out, "Not everyone gets to go to Notre Dame when it's the team's I OOth anniver­sary." Other dorms that are Interested in selling the records as fund-raisers are encouraged to become Involved too. 
As of now, pressing of the blue vinyl "45" with Its gold label has not stopped. Al­though the song might not en­dure as long as some of the more traditional ones, Peter hopes it will "hit strong and carry through this season. Our honest Intention Is to generate school spirit." Adds Paula, "I hope that students will support this since it's for them. The song pays tribute to Notre Dame and its glory. We're part of that glory." 
'too 
Years' 

From the parking lot, to the 
stadium 
From the ACC to Sacred Heart, 
We come in trailers, bringing 
all we got 
Praying to Mary, for one last 
shot. 
For victory and dignity, 
For a couple ofgames, like 73. 
When our teams were tough 
and the turf was hot 
But our guys still gave all they 
got. 
CHORUS 
Shaking down the thunder, waking up the echoes, Tearing up the turf, for one hundred years. Marching loyal sons, beating all the odds, Ooing a hu~red yards, tor one hundred years. 
As the underdogs, we play our· best. And despite reviews, we'll beat the rest. When other teams put us to the test  There's never a doubt, they'll get upset. ·cause when golden helmets hit the football field, We'll come from behind, like In '29. A hundred years of football glory .(Vtd each new .game is a dif­ferent story. 
CHORUS 
Many legends have run down Rockne's field. Uke the Horsemen, Mules, all loyal sons. 
Like Leahy did, and Ara did, 
And other men: like Moose and Dan. . .·;p For'bne hundred years we've heard the band. And through ltalt th~.~tudents
stand. ······· 
Yes, there's nothing like a foot­ball game 
Played for the glory of Notre Dame.

Road trippin' 
MATT SITZER AND KIM YURATOVAC assistant accent editors 
I 
t was weird. Kind of like that dt<}a uu feeling that always accompanies something this strange. We had dreamed the same dream -the ultimate roadtrip -and it began something like this . .. 
Our voyage has lasted almost four hours. We have plodded over the cruel Michigan landscape at a speed well above the current limit. Matt's Ford Tempo, the lead vessel, cuts a swath through the wind as Kim controls operations at the helm of her Buick Electra strategically placed at the rear of the convoy. 
Our destination is the strange and distant city of Ann Arbor, in the country Inhabited by the Michigan Wolverines. 
Sitzer and Yuratovac 




Domed 

Echos of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" rise over the Ann Arbor city limits as we pull into Wolverine country. Waitt There's Meg Tilly and William Hurt prancing joyfully through the streets, as Glenn Close and Jeff Goldblum sing the Michigan flght song to the tune of the Irish Victory March. We are chilled in a big way. 
As we Notre Dame pilgrims disembark from our roadtrlpping vehicles, hoardes of admiring Michigan students meet us with looks of wonder and strange anxiety on their cherubic, native faces. We have reached the shores of the new land, and we are all pretty darned excited about it. 
As Matt and his compatriots gaze out Into the sea of Michigan faces, they are thrilled to see thousands, no, millions of female faces clearly enthralled with these strange vlstors. Kim and her fellow explorers, however, seem to take lmmecUate notice of the huge contingent of Michigan men, eager for Just one conversation with an intelligent woman. 
We are whisked off to meet their leader, some guy named Bo Schmedbukeler, who immediatedly bestows upon us the key to their city. With this golden key, we unlock the doors of all the Ann Arbor taverns --and, hey,1 everyone is Invited. 
We are busy converting the natives and having a great time when who should show up but the Ann Arbor pollcel We Darners freeze instantly. In response to this apparent catastrophe, the Michiganites give us a bewildered look as they open a cage in the rear, releasing a pack of ferocious dogs. The pollee run in terror as the hungry beasts chase them down the street. "No problem," say the natives. 
After that bit of excitement we are all a little more confldent and ready for a change of pace. Therefore, we readily accept the Invitation to attend a type of ceremonial gathering to be held In our honor at the dwelling of one of the more "elite" of the Michigan social classes --the infamous Fraternity tribe ritual. 
We enter the house amid resounding chants of "Damn glad ta meet ya"s, and are Introduced to a strange greenish-red concoction poured liberally from a steaming cast-Iron cauldron. The women in our group are a bit apprehensive about tasting this strange brew but the guys dive right in. 
After what seems like only minutes, there is turmoil at the front of the house. It's the cops again, and It looks like another raid. No trouble, they finally explain. It seems that we have not met the minimum decibel requirements and they ask if we would please try to make some more noise. They laugh off the earlier dog-Incident saying they were just kidding around anyway. 
It Is late, now. We realize that, In our ardor to reach Ann Arbor, we had neglected to make the proper sleeping arrangements. Matt expresses the group's collective concern. Pandemonium erupts. "I get the one with the glasses!" pleads a frothy-mouthed co-ed. "I get the tall one with the Cardinals hatl" screams another riotous student. It is bedlam. There is pushing and shoving and screaming and .... At that point, Kim brought the rabid crowd to a hush with a reminder about duLac(do what?) 
By some strange coincidence we both awoke from the dream at exactly the same point There are a lot of questions left un­answered. One of which Is, who won the game? We don't really know how the dream ended, but Matt's asleep right now trying to find out.

Irish jump to 16th in AP footba II poll 
Associated Press 

Despite a week that saw it take the field only in practices, the Notre Dame football team jumped from 18th to 16th in the Associated Press Top 20 Poll released Tuesday. The Irish open the season Saturday against Michigan, which fell two places, from 7th to 9th, al­though they were also idle. 
Oklahoma, Nebraska and UCLA remained the top three teams in the second poll of the year -and the first during the season -while Auburn moved 
Green hires L.ucchesi for season 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Frank Lucchesi was named interim manager of the Chicago Cubs Tuesday, replacing Gene Michael, who resigned after almost 1 12 years. 
General Manager Dallas Green announced Lucchesi's appointment and said, "Frank understands that it is for 25 games and no longer." 
Green said the move will "give us time to gather our thoughts and give us time re­garding the managerial deci­sion. We'd like to make the decision in October or November, hopefully before the winter meetings. But we won't make a decision until we're completely satisfied."

into the fourth spot after its 31-3 victory over Texas. 
The Sooners, who started off their season with a 69-14 drub­bing of North Texas State, were named No. 1 on 54 of 5H tlaHots cast by a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Oklahoma received 1,154 points to 1,054 for Nebraska, which got three first-place votes after a 56-12 victory over Utah State. The other first­place vote went to No.3 UCLA, a 47-14 victor over San Diego State in its opener, with 947 points. 
Third base coach John Vukovich has been considered a prime candidate for the job from which Michael figured to be fired at the end of the season. 
"It would be unfair to put someone like Vuke under the 
--gun for the final 25 games," Green _said. "The pressure would be terrific." Vukovich said Green called him Monday night after he had learned of Michael's resigna­tion. "He explained it to me, and I understand completely," said Vukovich. "Certainly I want the job, who wouldn't?" Lucchesi, 59, managed in the minor leagues for 17 years before taking over the Philadelphia Phillies from 
Those three teams occupied the same spots in the AP's preseason poll. 
The only movement in the Top Five came when Auburn and Ohio State flip-flopped. Auburn moved up one spot to fourth with 937 points, while Ohio State, which has not opened its season yet, fell one spot with 857. 
The rest of the Top Ten was: Louisiana State, 821; Miami, Fla., 792; Florida State, 744; Michigan, 723, and Clemson, 
674. Last week, it was LSU, 
1970-72. He replaced Billy Mar­tin as manager of the Texas Rangers in 1975 and managed them until he was fired in 1977. His managerial record in the major leagues was 341-429. 
Probably the most memorable part of Lucchesi's managerial career came before the 1977 season. In 
spring training, Lucchesi relieved second baseman Lenny Randle of his starting job, and Randle, angered by the demotion, punched Luc­chesi. Lucchesi wound up in the hospital. 
Green said he would consider a list of candidates and the naming of a black manager "is a possibility. Billy Williams would be a good candidate." 
Michigan, Florida State, Clem­son and Miami, Fla. 
The Second Ten consisted of Penn State, Washington, Arkansas, Tennessee, Arizona State, Notre Dame, Michigan State, Pittsburgh, Alabama and Georgia. 
Last week's Second Ten was Penn State, Arkansas, Wash­ington, Arizona State, Texas A&M, Iowa, Tennessee, Notre Dame, Southern Cal and a tie between Florida and Georgia for 20th. 
Michigan State, Pitt and Al­abama were the newcomers to

O'Gara reviews 1OOth Irish season 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
In three days, Notre Dame fans will sit themselves down in Michigan Stadium or in front of a TV to witness season number 100 of Irish football and season number two of Lou Holtz' tenure as head football coach under the Dome. 
With less than 75 hours and counting until the first kick­off, this is a good time to take a final pre-season look at the 11 opponents that hopefully pave the road to a bowl bid: 
Michigan is the first and perhaps most important chal­lenge of the season. The Wolverines have not lost a home opener since Bo Schembechler took over as head coach, which means for the past 18 years. Michigan returns seven starters on both sides of the line, including a huge offensive line that intends to clear the way for 5'7" tailback Jamie Morris. A Heisman hopeful entering the '87 campaign, Morris has rushed for 1,000 yards in two consecutive seasons. 
Sophomore red-shirt Demetrius Brown will likely be Bo's choice to replace all-Big Ten QB Jim Harbaugh and start on Saturday, but no official announcement has been made.. 
Michigan State will be Notre Dame's first test at home. The Spartans should boast an improved squad from last year's 6-5 season. Four of those losses came by a total of 12 points, a statistic with a familiar ring to the Irish. Michigan State returns eight offensive starters, including another Heisman candidate, Lorenzo White. White rushed for 1,908 yards his sophomore year before falling victim

to knee and ankle injuries last fall. Replacing '86 quarter­back Dave Yarema will be junior Bobby McAllister, who has the good legs to run the option. The Spartans' defense lost only two starters from last year's team. 
Purdue will be showing several new faces when the Irish head to West Lafayette on September 26. Former Texas mentor Fred Akers takes on the head coaching task for the Boilermakers, replacing Leon Burnett. Also gone from last year's 3-8 squad is quarterback Jeff George, who signed with Miami and then Illinois because he feared Akers would bring in a run-dominated offense. 
Senior Doug Downing will get the nod to start at quar­terback. The Boilermaker secondary will feel the loss of All-American cornerback Rod Woodson, and should be vulnerable to the pass. 
Pittsburgh is once again rebuilding after several mediocre seasons in the 1980's. The Panthers should be used to second-year Head Coach Mike Gottfried and will return sixteen starters, eight on offense and eight on defense. This experience should help Pitt improve last fall's 5-5-1 record, while a much-heralded freshman class will be called on to give the team some depth. 
The Panthers received a blow last month when tailback Charles Gladman was declared ineligible for refusing to cooperate with NCAA and University investigations into possible illegal deals and cash payments with agent Norby Waters. 
Air Force and Head Coach Fisher DeBerry finished last season 6-5 and now find the cupboard looking a bit bare, thanks to the graduation of nine defensive starters and an injury-filled spring. Sophomore Steve Letnich appears to be the top candidate at quarterback and will run the wish­bone offense. 
The Falcons don't have a top rusher, but that's OK be­cause they don't have a very good offensive line either. Holding down the fort on defense will be All-America can­didate Chad Hennings, who powerlifts 1300 pounds. 
Southern Cal has been called a big question mark in 1987 by many, even more so after Monday's 27-13 loss to Michigan State in which they looked anything but Top 20ish. Larry Smith has come from Arizona to take over at the helm for the Trojans, replacing Ted Tollner who we all know was fired because he couldn't beat Notre Dame. Junior Rodney Peete will return to lead the USC offense at quarterback, while Smith has installed the Power-I formation in search of reviving the glory days of Southern Cal tailbacks. 
Outside linebacker Marcus Cotton returns to anchor the defense. Cotton made 149 tackles last fall and is a leading
