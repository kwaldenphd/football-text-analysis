ND settles suit with Umbrella Graphics 
By KENDRA MORRILL 
Senior Staff Reporter 
Umbrella Graphics can no longer use Notre Dame trademarks without the Uni­versity's written permission, according to a settlement agreement reached by Umbrella Graphics and the University last Thursday. 
The University filed a law­suit against the South Bend screen printing company in January alleging Umbrella Graphics infringed upon Notre Dame's federal, state and com­mon law trademarks and en­gaged in unfair competition un­der Indiana and federal law. 
A court order had allowed the seizure of goods bearing Notre Dame trademarks from the Umbrella Graphics store at 2925 Mishawaka A venue on Jan. 12. 
The University is satisfied with the outcome of the lawsuit, according to Carol Kaesebier, assistant general counsel. "As in any lawsuit these things take time," Kaesebier said, "but it went smoothly and was re­solved satisfactorily." 
Kaesebier would not com­ment on whether Umbrella Graphics was satisfied with the settlement. "They agreed to it," she said. 
Todd Garrison, a spokesman for Umbrella Graphics, said he could not comment on the case according to the terms of the agreement. 
The settlement states: "Umbrella Grap­hics...agrees to refrain from

Zang leaves position of Investment Officer 
By MICHAEL WELLS 
Staff Reporter 
Father Richard Zang has left his position as the University's Investment Officer, effective this week. 
Scott Malpass, the assistant investment officer, has been named acting Investment Offi­cer until a replacement for Fa­ther Zang can be named. 
Zang, who received his B.B.A., A.B. in Philosophy, and 
M.B.A. from Notre Dame, ad­ministered University invest­ments for 18 years. According to the University's Office of Public Relations, Zang also acted as rector in student residence halls for 11 of the years he was here. 
"We are grateful for the stewardship of Father Zang during a period of unprece­dented growth in the Univer­sity's endowment, and we wish him well," said Father William Beauchamp, vice president of the University. 
Zang refused comment on his departure. 
The Investment Office administers the University's endowment, those funds donated by alumni and friends of Notre Dame. During the time Zang held the position of Investment Officer, the endow­ment has grown to a little under half a billion dollars, said Malpass. 
Malpass, a 1984 Notre Dame graduate, came to the office in August from his job as a portfolio manager with the Wall Street firm of Irving Trust Company. 
He said he believes that as the endowment grows, the of-

WORLD BRIEFS 
Rolls of toilet paper were the prizes for the winners of a a lottery in the Ukrainian city of Stakhanov. The rolls didn't top the $115 million jackpot offered last week in Pennsylvania, but the winners seemed happy with their prizes. The newspaper Literary Gazette on Wednesday told the story of Ira, a girl who bought three tickets and walked away with several rolls of toilet paper, a towel and a small bowl. The lottery tickets cost 50 kopeks--about 81 cents--more than the actual price of many of the prizes. "But, don't forget that there are great shortages," Literary Gazette said. "In the city of Stakhanov, except for the lottery, one cannot get these goods." 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The desperate Oral Roberts struggles to raise more than $4 million by Saturday to save Oral Roberts ministry, his religious empire of television evangelism. Roberts said in late March he had five weeks to raise $11 million to pay past-due bills or creditors would "start dismantling" the ministry. Richard Roberts, the evangelist's son, said more than $4 million still is needed by Saturday, when Oral Roberts University graduates nearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students. Roberts announced Tuesday he was pulling the university's athletic teams out of NCAA compe­tition and applying for admission in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics to save money. 
CAMPUS BRIEFS 
Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis has forwarded its first installment of a $100,000 commitment to the University of Notre Dame to establish a junior faculty fellows program in the College of Engineering's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. "We are grateful to the Emerson Electric Co. for its timely and significant contribution to the work of a very important department in the University," said Father Edward Malloy, University President. Funds from the Emerson Electric Junior Faculty Fellows Program will be used to support the research of the department's young faculty members and also to underwrite fellowships for graduate as­sistants. 
The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation's Selection Committee has selected 198 artists, scholars and scientists from among 3144 applicants for Fellowship awards totaling $5,251,000. Notre Dame Faculty members receiving the award include Kent Emery, assistant professor, Program of Liberal Studies, for his work on the life and works of Denys Ryckel, and Thomas Kselman, associate professor of history for his work on death and the afterlife in 19th-century France. Emery was also awarded a $65,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a project entitled, "A Cri­tical Edition of Henry of Ghent's 'Quodlibet III."' 
Father Richard McBrien, Crowley-O'Brien-Walter professor and chairman of the University of Notre Dame's Department of Theology will receive an honorary doctorate of letters from Quincy College in Illinois on May 14. McBrien, a native of Hartford, Conn., was ordained a priest for that city's archdiocese in 1962. Mter receiving his doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1967, he taught at Boston College and was a visiting professor at several Catholic colleges, universities and seminaries. He has been a member of Notre Dame's faculty and chairman of its theology department since 1980. Author of a syndicated column in the Catholic Press and a frequent commentator on ecclesial affairs, he is author of several articles and books on ecclesiology including the bestselling "Catholicism."

Cold fusion is a lofty illusion 
The recent claim by two scientists who said they achieved cold nuclear fusion has blown the fuses of their angry colleagues. 
B. Stanley Pons, a chemistry professor at the University of utah, and chemist Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton, England, said Mar. 23 that they achieved nu­clear fusion in a jar of water at room temper­ature. 
If true, their experiment could tap an un­limited source of cheap energy, or worse, the Congressional checkbook. That could mean an end to the energy crisis, inexpensive material for advanced nuclear weapons or research megabucks. 
That's power one doesn't trifle with. 
But physicists at a two-day conference of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Md. fused together to show evidence debunking the claim. 
Dozens of attempts to reproduce the Pons­Fleischmann experiment have failed. Physicists at Caltech, MIT and other research institutions say Pons and Fleischmann's con­clusions were wrong. Some have even ques­tioned their colleagues' competence, making sarcastic remarks. 
One physicist was ingenuous enough to recite verse: Tens of millions of dollars at stake, Dear Bro­ther;/ Because some scientist put a ther­mometer/ At one place and not another. 
What are Pons and Fleischmann talking about? How can they be right and so many others wrong? Has science gone mad? 
But the only talking either scientist is doing is to the U.S. Congress, after the University of utah requested $25 million for further research. 
Small wonder. Mssrs. Pons and Fleischmann could get a lot of taxpayer dollars if they con­vince Congress that cold fusion research is worthwhile. 
Some things in this world are worth $25 mil­lion, but watching a jar of water for tempera­ture fluctuations isn't. 
Of course, if cold fusion can be achieved, the payback in energy savings might be worth it.

Yeah, yeah, without researching it, we'll never know. But without proof that cold fusion is possible, Congress shouldn't give out cold cash. 
Fusion, the opposite of atom-splitting, occurs when atoms join together, producing heat and neutrons. This usually happens at very high temperature, like 10 million-plus degrees Fah­renheit. 
Cold fusion, however, can be produced at room temperature with deuterium, a form of hydrogen, and palladium. At least that's what Pons and Fleischmann say. 
The effect of fusion is tremendous power, like the feeling military leaders got when it was developed for hydrogen bombs. 
Think what life could be a century from now, when tabletop fusion apparatus is available for fourth grade science projects. Everything elec­trical could be run on the marriage of two atoms. 
Cities could be powered for years without relying on Saudi Arabia. Who knows, in 2089 maybe the Middle East will have been obliterated by cold fusion bombs. 
Fusion could give a whole new meaning to "crude oil." Disinherited Saudis might need to buy our oil. OPEC would join the dinosaurs. Jazz would never be the same. 
And to think, it would all have started with two chemists keeping vigil over a jar of water.

lnnsbruck celebrates 25th 
By SARA MARLEY Senior Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame Foreign Study Program in In­nsbruck, Austria, recently marked its 25th anniver­sary. 
The 27 students currently on the program celebrated with representatives from Notre Dame and the Univer­sity of Innsbruck. 
The program was started in 1964 and a friendship agreement between Notre Dame and the University of Innsbruck was signed in 1982. 
Sr. John Miriam Jones, as· sociate provost, represented Notre Dame at the anniver­sary celebration, said Isabel Charles, associate provost and director of the Foreign Study Programs.

Shuttle for Venus to launch on Thursday 
Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.­The countdown marched smoothly Wednesday toward a second attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis with a crew of five and a space probe destined for Venus. NASA's only worry was a worsening weather forecast. 
"All in all, things look good for a 1:48 p.m. launch tomor­row (Thursday) and the start of our trip to Venus," launch test director Albert Sofge said of shuttle preparations. 
The weather outlook, however, was not the greatest, with forecasters saying Wed­nesday afternoon there was a 40 percent chance that either rain or high winds would prevent a launch during the available 64-minute launch period. That was up from 30 percent in the morning and 20 percent two days ago. 
The first launch attempt last Friday was aborted just 31 seconds before the planned lif­toff because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. NASA said the delay cost about $300,000. 
The mission to take the 
Magellan spacecraft into orbit . 
and a reception with the stu­dents were held on March 24. 
Each year between twenty and thirty students partici­pate in the program, al­though nearly sixty have participated at one point. They are joined by a profes­sor who serves as director. 
The current Austrian co­ordinator of the program is Helga Horak and the current director is Brian Pavlac. Past directors still at Notre Dame include Klaus Lanzinger, professor of modern languages, Albert Wimmer, assistant profes­sor of modern languages, David Schindler, associate professor in the Program of Liberal Studies, Norlin Rueschhoff, professor of ac­countancy, and Alexander Hahn, professor of mathe­matics. 
The Innsbruck Program is the oldest of Notre Dame's 
mant since the launch of Pioneer-Venus in 1978. 
"Mter an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anx­ious to get started," said John Gerpheide, project manager for Magellan. 
Shuttle chief Richard Truly opened an afternoon news con­ference with, "Here we are again, and we're ready to fly again. We've fixed our prob­lems. 
"The weather is not going to be as good as it was last Friday, but it appears it will be good." 
Air Force Capt. Thomas Strange, the shuttle meteorologist, said ''there is a 40 percent chance of a violation of weather constraints." 
He said the forecast called 
for a chance of rain showers. 
But of more concern, he said, 
was the possibility of cros­
swinds of more than 14 mph 
that could be dangerous if the 
shuttle had to make an emer­
gency landing on a runway 
near the launch pad. 
On Thursday, the shuttle 
must be launched by 2:52p.m., 
the end of a 64-minute "launch 
window," in order to have 
Magellan in the right position 
for a flight to Venus. If it isn't Foreign Studies Programs. Students may study in In­nsbruck; Angers, France; Tokyo; Mexico City; Cairo or Jerusalem. A summer program is also held in Tiajin, China. 

Two students are studying in Toledo, Spain, currently and eight will be next year as a part of an experimental program, according to Claudia Kselman, assistant director of Foreign Study Programs. 
Both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students may participate in the programs, and Notre Dame students are eligible for the Saint Mary's programs in Rome and Maynooth, Ireland. 
The Arts and Letters Lon­don Program and the Rome architecture program are run independently of the Foreign Study Office. 
before Earth and Venus are in the right position again. 
Technicians working around the clock replaced the fuel pump and a suspect fuel line in half the time expected, en­abling NASA to reschedule the launch for Thursday, at least a day earlier than officials thought was possible. 
Engineers had thought there was a leak in the fuel line that was replaced, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the line, thought at first to be gas, was trapped water vapor. 
Sofge reported both new parts had been checked and certified for flight and that the engine compartment had been closed up. The launch team prepared to pump 528,000 gal­lons of liquid hydrogen and liq­uid oxygen into Atlantis' exter­nal fuel tank early Thursday. 
The five astronauts reviewed flight plans and honed their flying efficiency over central Florida in T-38 jet planes. 
"This time we're going to see if we can get it right," said David Walker, who will com­mand the mission. "We're ex­tremely pleased the folks here at the Cape were able to do such

Thousands of students march at Beijing Univ. 
Associated Press 
BEIJING-With a burst of 

firecrackers and the bang of a 
gong, thousands of Chinese stu­
dents marched for democracy 
and freedom Thursday on the 
70th anniversary of the first 
student movement in China. 
Students at Beijing Univer­

sity, China's most prestigious 
college, poured out of the 
campus gate at 8:30a.m. 
Ten minutes later at nearby 
People's University, several 
thousand students rolled out 
onto the streets, carrying doz­
ens of red and white banners 
calling for a free press and 
democratic reforms. One man 
wore a red headband that read: 
"mom, I'm not wrong." 
The marchers were cheered 
on by thousands of people along 
the way, much like last week 
when 150,000 students and sup­
porters staged a 20-mile march 
through the capital. 
The students said Tuesday they would march unless the government recognized their independent student organiza­tion. On Wednesday, the government refused. 
More than 40 universities 
around Beijing were expected 
to join in the march to Tianan­
men Square, China's symbolic 
seat of power, student leaders 
said. 
Most moved southward from the main university area in northwest Beijing, and thousands more from at least eight universities began a sep­arate march toward Tianan­men from the northeast section of the city. 
Since April 15, when the cur­rent demonstrations · began, students have successfully marched to the square on five different occasions. 
They also have boycotted classes the past two weeks in the largest protest Chinese Communist authorities have faced in their 40 years of rule. 
Police closed off the central square early Thursday, clear­ing all pedestrians off the vast

100-acre plaza. Police were sta­
tioned about 15 feet apart 
around the perimeter to keep 
people off. 
About 2,000 international 
finance officials and bankers 
were to gather at the Great 
Hall of the People, on the west­
ern side of the square, 
Thursday morning for the 
opening of the annual meeting 
of Asian Development Bank. 
"They tried to close it (the square) on April 22, and look what happened then," Beijing Normal University student leader Wu'er Kaixi said Wed­nesday.Onthatday,morethan 150,000 students and supporters occupied the square in defiance of a police order. 
"Our protest tomorrow will show that Chinese democracy has arrived at a new stage," he said. "It will be a historic march." 
Several hundred police gath­ered at an intersection just south of Beijing Normal Uni­versity, a center for the pro­democracy student activism that has rocked the Chinese government since it began on April15. 
Police presence has been heavy at previous demonstra­tions, but police are unarmed and have made only minimal efforts to stop the marchers. 
Marches also were repor­tedly planned in Shanghai, Tianjin and other cities Thursday, the 70th anniversary of the May 4th Movement, China's first student appeal for democracy. 
About 60 journalists from state-run newspapers who signed a petition Wednesday for greater press freedom also said they planned a rally Thursday outside the gates of the official Xinhua News Agency. 
The tightly controlled press has barely covered the demonstrations and has ex­pressed the government line that the independent student unions formed by the activists are illegal.

WASHINGTON-Spending on education is up but progress is at a standstill, Education Sec­retary Lauro Cavazos said Wednesday in releasing a report card that rates the na­tion's students as "merely average." 
"The good news is that the schools are not worse ; the bad news is that we are not making progress," Cavazos said as he stood before his department's sixth annual State Education Performance Chart. 
"We are standing still, and the problem is that it's been this way for three years in a row. Frankly, the situation scares me," he said. 
The figures show a decline this year in the national high school graduation rate and fal­ling scores on college entrance exams in half the states. 
In reaction, the Council of Chief State School Officers, while acknowledging that "the task ahead is gigantic," noted that 44 of the 50 states have made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 38 states have improved their high school completion rates since then. 
But Cavazos called the longer-term gains minimal. He said "scores on college en­trance exams are still substan­tially lower than they were in the 1960s" while the graduation rate has gone up less than two points. 
"As a nation our educational performance is merely average," Cavazos said. "People are still willing, ap­parently, to accept that we're not doing well and can't com­pete." 
If educational progress has stagnated, the Education De­partment's chart shows the same cannot be said of per­pupil spending. The national

average was $3,977 per student in 1988, up from $3,165 in 1982--a 26 percent hike. 
"We are already spending more money per student than our major foreign competitors, Japan and Germany. And yet our students consistently fall behind the competition in com­petitive testing," Cavazos said. "Money alone is not the answer to our education deficit."

South Korea to stop protestors 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea-Presi­dent Roh Tae-woo on Wednes­day threatened to invoke emer­gency powers, which could mean martial law, if students and workers continue the kind of violent protest in which six riot policemen were killed. 
He said his government was determined to stop the wave of radical protest that has bat­tered South Korea in recent weeks, but he did not outline specific action in a televised speech to the nation. 
"If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future of the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as empowered by the constitution," he said. 
South Korea's constitution permits the president to rule by decree or impose martial law in cases of emergency. 
Rob's warning responded to the killing of six riot troopers early Wednesday at Dongui University in Pusan, a south­ern stronghold of the opposi­tion. 
People seldom are killed in South Korean protests. Riot of­ficers wear protective helmets and shields, along with fireproof fatigues, and nor­mally are armed only with tear gas and batons. 
The six who died were set afire when they broke into a room on the seventh floor of the university library to free five comrades held hostage. They were the first policemen killed since a riot officer died in June 1987. 
Authorities said students seized the hostages Tuesday after a violent demonstration against the firing of warning shots · by police on Monday when protesters menaced a police station. 
Students hurled firebombs and set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it. Some officers wrapped in flames jumped out of win­dows and others were burned to death or asphyxiated, police said. 
Ten officers were in critical condition and police said they expected more to die. Officials said about 10 other policemen and students suffered minor in­juries. 
About 700 police raided the school, firing tear gas. Eighty­eight arrests were reported and the hostages later were freed unharmed. 
Jo Jong-suk, chief of the na· tional police, resigned after about 150 officers in Pusan con­ducted a sit-down protest .

Infants die 1n dirty hospital 

Associated Press 
MOSCOW-Thirteen infants died in a two-week period in an Armenian hospital where cock­roaches scuttled around the cabinets and doctors set mousetraps under the operat­ing table, a newspaper revealed. 
In a blistering attack that ac­cused officials of indifference, incompetence and a coverup, the Armenian newspaper Kom­munist said 25 children born at the Krupskaya Scientific­Research Institute in the capi­tal of Yerevan had died this year, including 13 alone in the first two weeks of March. 
In another Yerevan mater­nity -hospital, three children died because they were given overdoses of medicine, accor­ding to the April 29 edition of the newspaper that reached Moscow on Wednesday. 
A government commission established that many of the in­fants died of infections caused by unsanitary conditions "on the operating table, in the birth area, in areas for premature babies, on nipples, oxygen niasks, breathing tubes, and even on medical lamps." 
Tenure

average person looks for a bal­ance between the two," said Fuchs. 
While almost everyone seems to agree that research isn't the only thing, many agree it is vital nonetheless. 
O'Meara and Martin both said that quality research and quality teaching are intricately related. 
"Better researchers become better teachers," said Martin, who said that she talks to her students about her research. O'Meara added, "Scholarship is one way to keep the mind alert, provided it is not abused." 
"You'll find that the better teachers are also the better re­searchers," said Mary Jane Clancy, assistant professor of biological sciences. 
Clancy, the only member of the biological sciences depart­ment up for tenure last year, was denied tenure. 
Clancy said she didn't feel hindered by pressure to do re­search. "There is pressure to research, but one in my posi­tion wants to do research. As a scholar, I'm always trying to learn more," she said. 
Next year, Clancy will be a member of the faculty at the University of New Orleans. She said, "I'm glad to be leaving here," but refused to comment further on her reasons. 
According to O'Meara, his ef­forts to improve the University through tougher standards for tenure have worked. 

"We turned down far more people at tenure time ten years ago than we do now, which shows that our standards are being met," he said. 
"We're having to compete with faculty in other univer­sities who do nothing but re­search," said Martin. "Being able to keep up with them and still have a full teaching load says a lot for the quality of the faculty here." 
Thus, through an emphasis on tougher qualifications and on a balance between teaching ability and scholarship, O'Meara is trying to build a highly respected and well-paid faculty. 
Those faculty members who don't receive tenure must con­tinue their scholarly work else­where. Those who do, however, will be set for life.

making public statements to reporters for newsapers, magazines or television or radio stations regarding this case, this settlement or the Jan­uary 12, 1989, seizures which are inconsistent with the state­ments, acknowledgements and representations made in this agreement." 
"That's the best way of ex­plaining my position," said Garrison. 
"Whatever is in the agree­ment is what can be pub­lished," said Arvil Howe, Umbrella Graphics' attorney. "Notre Dame doesn't say anything; we don't say anyth­ing." 
Under other terms of the settlement, Umbrella Graph­ics: 
acknowledged 
it had in­fringed upon Notre Dame's trademarks, engaged in unfair competition and, in at least one instance, had filled an order for approximately $15,000 in illegal products 

waived 
all claims that its goods were improperly seized last January 


"Mothers say: cockroaches scuttle around the cabinets and under the operating table there is a mousetrap," Kommunist reported. 
The commission determined that about half of the 13 children who died in March were among the highest-risk group of newborns, but that"at least five or six of these children did not have to die," the newspaper said. 
It said nothing about the 12 other children born at the in­stitute who have died this year. 
The paper said the institute was closed, its director, G.G. Okoev, was fired, and other senior personnel were demoted. 
In an earlier interview, the paper said Okoev had blamed the high death rate on the high­risk nature of its patients and a flu epidemic among the mot­hers. 
Citing the case of the three other children who were given overdoses of medicine, the newspaper demanded: "is this coincidence, or is it the sys­tem? A deeper and more serious discussion is needed here." 

Mter many years of not publishing such statistics, the official press said a year ago the infant mortality rate was about 25 per 1,000 live births. In some areas of Central Asia, it is as high as 70 per 1,000. The infant mortality rate in the United States in 1986 was 10.3 per 1,000. 
The report came after other reports of abuse and neglect in recent months at maternity hospitals that shocked Soviets. 
Officials said in March that 49 mothers and babies had been infected with the AIDS virus at a hospital in Elista by nurses who used unsterile syringes 
Soviet officials acknowledge the free system of health care often is poor, and they are put­ting more money aside to im­prove it. The Tass news agency Wednesday quoted Health Min­ister Yevgeny Chazov as saying that much of that money would be targeted at care for mothers and children. 
"Considering the lag of mot­her and child care centers, it has been decided to spend 40 percent of public health's cap­ital investments for the devel­opment of these institutions," Tass said. 
agreed not to honor orders which include University trademarks unless the cus­tomer has written authoriza­tion from the University's director of student activities 
The agreement conforms with Notre Dame's policy re­quiring all students or student groups to obtain authorization from the Office of Student Ac­tivities before using any of the University's trademarks. 

Non-students also must ob­tain a license or consent from the University before using any of its trademarks. 
Umbrella Graphics deals primarily with students, said Garrison. "Our intention all along has been to provide a cre­ative outlet for students," he said.

LAKEVILLE, Ind.-As mourners crowded into a tiny rural church to pay their last respects Wednesday to the minister and three members of his family found shot to death, investigators continued to search the parsonage and countryside nearby, looking for clues. 
About 250 mourners filed into the Olive Branch Church of the United Brethren in Christ for the memorial service for the Rev. Robert L. Pelley, 38; his wife, Dawn, 32; and daughters, Janel, 8, and Jolene, 6. 
The Pelleys were shot to death in their home across the gravel parking lot from the church on Saturday. Their bodies were discovered Sunday morning by a church trustee. 
The Pelleys' three surviving children also attended the memorial service. 
In the eulogy, the Rev. Alfred 
G. Price, a regional superin­tendent of the church, read from the Bible's book of Isaiah: "the righteous are taken away

to be spared from evil." 
"Though his ministry at Olive Branch was a short one-­two and a half years to be exact--it was a very successful one," Price said. "We, like all who know the Pelley family, are going to miss them greatly." 
C. Ray Miller, a bishop of the church, said the family had served Jesus Christ in a team ministry. 
"They are now in the actual presence of Jesus. Isn't that tre­mendous?" Miller said. 
The mourners sang ''Amaz­ing Grace," which was Mrs. Pelley's favorite hymn, and "What A friend We Have In Jesus," then filed quietly out of the church. 
Miller had urged the mourn­ers to keep the spirit of the memorial service and not talk about the deaths to each other or to the media. 
Many of the mourners drove the few miles to Southlawn Cemetery in South Bend, where the caskets had been taken di­

At the cemetary, two larger bronze caskets rested beside two smaller silver caskets, all surrounded by sprays of roses, chrysanthemums, gladiolas and carnations. 
"We commit their bodies to the grave, and their spirits to God, who gave them," said Mil­ler in the brief graveside eul­ogy. 
Many of the mourners wept openly during the graveside service and embraced mem­bers of the victims' families who had traveled from Mic­higan and Kentucky. 
Robert "Jeff" Pelley, the couple's 17 year-old son, remained at the graveside for about 20 minutes after the ser­vices, accepting condolences from high school friends who surrounded him. 
Hours before the memorial service, police divers resumed their search for a weapon in farm ponds near the par­sonage, while a sheriff's horse patrol searched wooded areas nearby for additional evidence.

EDITORIAL LETTERS 
Faculty Senate reforms needed 
Recently some members of the faculty have been disgruntled at what they perceive as an inability of the Faculty Senate to have substantive influence in the decisions of the administration. They believe that faculty recommendations are either ignored or acted upon lethargically. 
Sadly, there is a large degree of truth in these per­ceptions. The University listens, even acknowledges to the faculty that their ideas have merit, then some­how loses sight of those ideas when University policy is implemented. 
One need not question the sincerity of some Uni­versity officials in their desire to improve conditions for the faculty to believe that faculty input has been brushed aside. Some individual members of the ad­ministration have shown a genuine willingness to hear input from the faculty. Instead, the source of the prob­lem is that the faculty voice is not heard when the actual decisions are being made. 
This situation is not unique to Notre Dame. At many peer institutions faculty members are upset over their lack of input in administrative matters. 
Most of these schools, however, do not see faculty unions as the solution to the problem. Similarly, any proposal to unionize the faculty at Notre Dame is misguided. The ultimate threat of a union lies in its ability to strike, an option inconsistent with a teaching mission and anathema to most faculty members. Dis­banding the Senate out of frustration is also not the answer to the problem. 
The solution lies in allowing the faculty some mea­sure of shared governance while leaving final author­ity in the hands of the administration. The emphasis should be on electing rather than appointing faculty members to positions of authority. Direct faculty elec­tion of an associate provost, for example, could give the faculty an important voice in the administration building while leaving ultimate authority unchanged. 
The need for improving the faculty voice is clear, but radical solutions such as unionization or the dis­banding of the senate are not the answer.

Drunk driving: A senseless risk of life 
By R. Craig Spann 
Last Fall, I was looking for­ward to October Break with great anticipation. The day fi­nally arrived when I made the grueling trip to O'Hare for my flight home to San Antonio. Life was a little more "awesome" than usual then. Our football team had just beaten that un­speakable team from Florida, and we had a week off from classes. The week flew by too fast, as breaks always do, but I had experienced one of the best breaks in recent memory. 
Most of my friends were off at school, except the two who went to school in town. The three of us lived it up, for they didn't have all that much to do for school that particular week. Forgive the cliche, but we were were having the time of our lives without a care in the world. Well, Sunday came, and so did the trip back to the won­derful South Bend climate. Break was over; I said my goodbyes to friends and family, and off I went. 
Sounds like a pretty good time, huh? Well it was. School was back in session, and our football team had just become the most highly ranked team in the land. A few weeks had passed. I received a letter from one of those two friends with whom I spent my October Break, Tim. It was a typical letter from a friend. He told me the low down on some of our friends from high school, as well as the general happenings. Well I wasted no time writing him back (mail doesn't come my way all that often). 
Tim never got my letter. Not because of our wonderfully reliable mail delivery, but rather because of the choice of another individual. Seems funny how other people can have such a pronounced effect on us sometimes. Tim was on a county road travelling home one Friday night early in No­vember. The story goes that he was approaching a road onto which he was going to make a left hand turn. As he waited for the oncoming car, it began to swerve into Tim's lane. There was nothing he could do but sit there and accept what was going to happen. I'm not so sure 

Death is really hard to accept. In a way it's perpetual suffering, because it can never be resolved . ... It was really hard to accept the fact that I would never talk to him again. 
he even knew what happened. The truck which was headed toward him did in fact hit Tim head on. Tim died instantly at the age of 20. The driver of the other vehicle escaped with minor injuries. 
Death is really hard to ac­cept. In a way, it's perpetual suffering because it can never be resolved. I can't begin to describe the suffering and pain I went through after Tim died. It was really hard to accept the fact I would never talk to him again.

Holtz's coach said that we should let people know how much they mean to us before it's too late. I never got a chance to say goodbye to Tim. I never got a chance to tell him how great a person and 
a friend he was. For this I will be forever sorry. 
Sometimes I really become angry when I recall what hap­pened. Tim's death, my suffer­ing and the suffering of his fam­ily and friends could have been avoided. The man who was driving the truck was driving under the influence of alcohol. Nothing in life should be so tough, but sometimes we make things tougher than they ought to be. We lose perspective. This man lost his perspective of how he should have behaved in the situation. And now his life has become much tougher than it should be. 
I share this story with you for one very specific reason. We live in a society in which we are free to drink to have some fun, and that can be good. We live in a society in which we are also free to get behind the wheel of a car after we have had our drink, and that is bad. I want you all to do me a favor. Summer is coming up soon and the rest of our lives after that. Please, if you are faced with this decision to drink and drive, or a friend is thinking about driving drunk, don't lose your perspective. It's not that tough to find a friend who isn't under the influence, or even to find a cab. You may think you're all right to drive, but why take that risk? Is it worth just that one little mistake that could change your life, and the lives of those around you, forever? If only that man who killed Tim had the chance to make a choice like you all have. 
Craig Spann is a junior electri­cal engineering major.

Montreal earns shutout, knots series with Flyers 
After dropping Game 1 , Canadians resume quest for Stanley Cup with 3-0 win over Philly 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL--Patrick Roy stopped 24 shots for his second career playoff shutout and Montreal's sputtering power play accounted for two goals as the Canadiens defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3-0 Wed­nesday night, evening the Wales Conference finals at one win each. 
Roy, whose 34-game un­beaten streak at the Forum was ended in the opener. earned his first playoff shutout since a 3-0 victory over Calgary in Game 4 of the 1986 finals. 
The Canadiens, who entered the game 6-for-36 during the playoffs on the power play, got a first-period goal from Step­bane Richer during a 5-on-3 ad­vantage and added another from rookie defenseman Eric Desjardins in the second. 

Only the play of goaltender Ken Wregget, the hero of the Flyers' 3-1 opening-game vic­tory, kept the score down. Wregget made 36 saves as the Flyers were outshot 39-24. The series resumes Friday night in Philadelphia. 
Montreal, which has allowed only two power-play goals in 11 playoff games, shut down the Flyers' league-leading unit, holding Philadelphia scoreless on four attempts. The Flyers are 0-for-9 with the man­advantage in the first two games. 
Roy earned an assist on Ric­her's goal, which gave the Canadiens their first lead of the series. 
Richer took a pass from Roy, skated the length of the ice and fired a slap shot from 45 feet. Wregget made the save but Richer raced in and took the rebound away as Wregget tried to pull it under his pads with his stick. The Montreal for­ward flipped the puck into the open net at 5: 31.

Kline 
continued from page 20 
Dame fanatic. "He's a true legend in Notre Dame baseball. I just hope I can touch half as many people as Jake has." 
Kline posted a lifetime coaching record of 558-449-5 at Notre Dame. His former players include future Hall of Fame inductee Carl Yastrzemski, Notre Dame Ath­letic Director Richard Rosen­thal, South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan and Montreal Expos President John McHale. 
All those former players learned a song about Kline that the Irish teams passed on from year to year. It dealt with a 1917 game against Michigan in which third baseman Kline hit three home runs. 
"We beat Michigan 14-6 that day," said Kline, who still has that afternoon's game ball in his South Bend apartment. "The kids used to sing 'Coach hit three home runs...and the fourth was foul by inches.' " 
Kline captained that 1917 team and also earned monograms in 1915 and 1916. The Williamsport, Pa., native posted a career average of around .350. 
That impressed the Pit­tsburgh Pirates enough to draft Kline, but he passed up the of­fer to go to France and serve with the 23rd Engineers in World War I. 
"I had small hands, but I could hit and had a good arm," said Kline, who also played In­terhall baseball against Knute Rockne. "I might have had a chance (in the pros) . " 
Notre Dame named Kline the Director of Athletics and of­fered him a teaching job in the math department when he came home. 
The Notre Dame job did not prevent Kline from doing some moonlighting in semipro leagues. 
"I managed baseball in Cal­ifornia, I won a pennant in the Southern Minnesota League, I played in Nova Scotia," said Kline. "I was a baseball bum." 
When the Notre Dame Ath­letic Department finally handed Kline a full-time job, however, it came in football. 

"When Rockne was killed in '31, Jess Harper met me on campus and asked me what I was doing," said Kline. "I told him I was teaching math. He asked if I would come out and coach freshman football." 
It did not take long before Kline got the opportunity to co­ach in the sport he enjoyed the most. The 39-year old Kline replaced George Keogan, who left in 1934 to concentrate on his job as basketball coach. 
Kline also continued jobs as freshman football coach and math professor, but his teams managed to win. After an 8-11 campaign in his debut season, the Irish assembled six con­secutive winning seasons. Notre Dame went on to earn its first berth to the NCAA playoffs in 1949. 
Kline's connections with the football team helped him put together strong teams with a limited amount of scholar­ships. 
One of the best players to take the field for Kline--Joe Theismann--earned more ac­claim as quarterback for Notre Dame and the Washington Redskins. 
"We made a southern trip, and the scouts there said, 'Jake, the kid with the best potential is that third baseman, Theis­mann,' " said Kline. "He hap­pened to be a quarterback, and when we got back, Ara said, 'Jake, I gotta have him.' " 
Notre Dame never played many more than 20 games per season in those days. The Uni­versity would not allow Kline to expand that schedule. 
"I played most of the Big Ten schools,'' said Kline. "With the schedule down to 20 games, you didn't have the chance to play anyone else.'' 
Because the University of­fered the baseball program as few as one or two scholarships, Kline also had to rely on inside contacts to draw athletes. 
Former Notre Dame player John McHale became one such inside contact. After ending his major league career, McHale started a career working on teams' staffs.

"I knew Jake very well, and we've remained friends a long time," said McHale, who worked as farm director for the Detroit Tigers and as general manager with the Mil­waukee·Atlanta Braves before arriving at Montreal. "He told us about the people he liked. He was a very good judge of talent, and he saw a lot of good players because he was playing Big Ten teams." 
According to McHale, this practice also worked the other way around. McHale claims re­sponsibility for bringing Carl Yastrzemski to Notre Dame. 
"I encouraged Carl Yastrzemski to go to school there," said McHale, who worked with the Detroit Tigers at the time. "We had a bonus rule in the major leagues then which limited how much you could pay a person. We thought they'd repeal the bonus rule, which they did." 
Yastrzemski only stayed at Notre Dame for his first year, and freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports at the time. He still managed to leave a lasting impression on Kline. 
''He came out on his own, and I told him that freshmen weren't eligible, but I let him walk on the freshman team,'' Kline said of Yastrzemski, who will enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in August. "When I saw his arm and the way he could hit, I told him I'd give him a scholarship for the next year. · 
"In his sophomore year, his family came to my office and told me he was getting profes­sional offers," Kline said. "I told him he'd better go see a lawyer. He signed with the Bos­ton Red Sox for $110,000. They certainly weren't the poor potato farmers they made themselves out to be." 
Yastrzemski, the only Amer­ican League player to have more than 400 career home runs and 3,000 career hits, never played for the Notre Dame varsity team or for McHale's team. 
"I called (McHale) and told him he ought to get this kid,'' said Kline. "He said he could get him $60,000. I told him, 'John, forget it.' " 


Jake Kline's sports interests are not limited to baseball alone. At top, he is pictured in 1954 with Irish captain Hal Reilly (right). Below, Kline (third from left) poses with the other members of the 1933 freshman football coaching staff.

ally competitive team. Coming off a .414 batting average in his sophomore campaign, people had high expectations for him this year. 
He was a preseason All­America choice by the Copper­tone-Collegiate Baseball poll, and had the third-highest bat­ting average among all return­ing Division I baseball out­fielders. He also was named an Academic All-American, with a 3.4 GPA and a major in Ac­counting. 
With all of these expecta­tions, Peltier hasn't missed a beat. He leads the team with

an amazing .458 batting average, and is also the team leader in home runs (9), doubles (20) RBI (57), hits (82), on-base percentage (.523), and slugging average (.754). 
And who says hard work and dedication don't pay off? Pel­tier has just been selected to be one of 40 players who will try out for the 25-member Team USA, a club that plays teams from around the world, including Mexico, Japan, Canada, Korea and Cuba. If he makes the team, Peltier will play 32 games from June through August, travelling to 11 different states and two foreign countries. 
"Dan Peltier leads the team with the bat," says Murphy. "Every game he's out there to play, and we can expect one or two hits a game from him. He's a fantastic, first class worker who has been a major con­tributor to our recent success in baseball." 

Murphy has ingrained an at­titude of winning into his team, and Peltier is no exception. 
"When I go to the plate," says the 6-1, 205-pound junior, "I have the attitude that I'm not going to get out. That's the attitude you've got to have, and that's what Coach Murphy has taught us to do. He's honestly the best coach I've ever had in any sport." 
Peltier has had his share of coaches, playing both baseball and football at Shenendehowa High School in New York. In baseball, he set a school record .554 batting average in his junior year, and was named MVP on the baseball team in his junior and senior years. 
Besides the honors in baseball, Peltier played quar­terback and led his high school team to a 10-0 record and state championship in his senior year. He was recognized for his contribution by being named to the New York All-State team. 
All of these accomplishments behind him, Peltier now has to look ahead to the possibility of pursuing a professional career in baseball. Professional teams have shown a great deal of in­terest in him, and Peltier has a tough decision ahead of him whether to turn pro this year or wait until he has graduated.

"It's all going to come down to whether it's right for me," says Peltier. "Obviously money is important, and the or­ganization has a lot to do with it. I'm going to have to weigh it (turning pro one year early) against finishing my educa­tion. 
"Whatever decision I make I know it will be the one that's right. If it's right, then I'll do it." 
His coach knows he has the talent to go to the professionals now, and only hopes Peltier throroughly considers his op­tions.

hit in the pros. He could be put in double-A ball right now," continues Murphy. "He's the best college baseball hitter right now, that I've seen." 
Peltier should not be a high risk for professional scouts, be­cause he has maintained excel­lent performance against the best pitchers in the country, in­cluding a 4-for-4 effort last season against Andy Benes, the number one pick in last year's professional draft. Benes cur­rently has four wins and a 0.44 ERA at Wichita (San Diego's class AA affiliate). 
Peltier's dedication in the classroom makes it all the harder to leave prior to achiev­ing a degree. "They (baseball and educa­tion) are both important," says Peltier, "but this year I think my priorities have switched be­cause my baseball future is more definite, but in no way am I neglecting studies. "The bottom line is that if I'm well prepared, then I know

The weather is unpredictable, the courts have fault lines and your first-round opponent could range from the defend­ing champions to five guys wearing tutus. 
About the only thing you can count on is that it takes 21 points to win. 
Until Sunday. 
While the Stepan crowd celebrated an apparent upset by Malicious Prostitution over Adworks All-Stars, one very important thing was overlooked. The game was not over. The score still stands Prostitution 20, Adworks 19. 
Brian O'Gara Marty Strasen 
Sports Writers 

Both WVFI radio and The Observer had 11-9 scores, and at least three known videotapes of the game verify a two­point Adworks halftime lead. 
The rest of the story is well-known. Prostitution rallied and won the game despite actually scoring only 20 points. 
"It's too bad that the tournament had to end that way," said Manning. "We had a conflict in the score, and we had to go with the official scorecard. We thought it was right. As it turned out, it was wrong." 
It was an honest mistake. It was unintentional. We're not trying to throw stones at the Bookstore officials or scorekeepers, and we're certainly not trying to diminish the accomplishments of Malicious Prostitution. They played like champions. 
But we want more Bookstore. 
One way to settle this is to pick up the game at 20-19 Prostitution. But the mistake was made much earlier, and it would be silly to send everyone back to Stepan for one or two points. 
We could start over at halftime, but we want to see more basketball than that. 
Let's play a best-of-five series, starting Monday. Next week is perfect. There are no classes, it couldn't possibly snow, and there would be no problem with biased coverage because The Observer is taking the week off. 
We could use the electronic scoring scanner from Pop-A­Shot, which automatically registers points when the ball falls through the net. 
Maybe Father Hesburgh could ref. How could you possibly give that guy a hassle? 
OK, perhaps this is a little far-fetched. All it would really take is for the two teams to get together with two hoops and a basketball--first to 21 wins. 
What do you say, guys? 
We'll keep score.

Tyson 
continued from page 20 
University. The school 
(hereafter referred to as CSU) 
awarded Tyson an honorary 
doctorate of humane letters 
during commencement 
ceremonies. 
After Tyson was given his 
doctorate, he showed why he 
never has and never will earn 
any kind of degree on his own. 
"I don't know what kind of 
doctor I am," he said. "But 
watching all these beautiful 
sisters here. . .I'm debating 
whether I should be a 
gynecologist." 
The school, which shrugged 
off the comment, said it gave 
Tyson the degree "because of 
the circumstances he over­
came." What about all of the 
ones he has created? 
Tyson's new degree did not improve his common sense much. The next night, Albany, N.Y., police awarded Tyson a speeding ticket after his 1989 · Lamborghini was clocked at 71 
mph in a 30 mph zone.' 
Tyson was apparently drag­
ging a Chevrolet Blazer. Like 
most of his fights, Tyson really 
picked some tough competition 
in that race. If he was going to 
get a ticket, he should have at 
least dragged Jose Canseco in 
Jose's infamous Jaguar. 
The degree makes Tyson's 
resume that much more im­
pressive. Along with this pres~ 
tigious degree, Tyson can also 
boast of soundly beating under­
matched and helpless oppo­
nents, wives and mother-in­
laws. 
CSU continues to support its 
decision to give Tyson the 
degree. In fact, the school has 
already listed its candidates 
for honorary degrees in the 
coming years. 

Here's the list, to be finalized soon: 
Jay Edwards: CSU says it can sympathize with Edwards be­cause of all the people trying to set him up. And besides, CSU tried to lure Bobby Knight to coach its basketball team but he refused, if it even has a bas­ketball team. I doubt that it does because Digger would have had them on his schedule by now. 
Pete Rose: This degree depends on Rose being found guilty of betting on Cincinnati Reds baseball games. CSU says it admires a millionaire who wants to make more money, even if it means being banished from the game he dominated for years. If Rose is innocent, Art Schlichter is waiting in the wings. 
Ben Johnson: The school feels this will increase its com­mitment to foreign exchange students. No matter how many times you show those Olympic replays, Johnson always beats American Carl Lewis. 
Jimmy Johnson, Dennis Erick­son and Larry Brown: They get 
a joint doctorate for commit­ment to football and basket­ball. CSU says the commitment doesn't need to be with one school, just with the same sport within the same continent. 
Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom: The above athletes and coaches need someone to rep­resent them. The degree may have to wait awhile, in case the two are serving time in a federal prison.

Irish set for Wildcat attack 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
The Irish take their 37-12 record into Evanston, Ill., for their second game with the Northwestern Wildcats this season. 
The last time the two teams met, the Irish defeated the Wildcats on their home field on April19. In that game, the Irish overcame a mediocre perfor­mance and relied on help from underclassmen to win 10-8. 

Notre Dame possesses a 49-47 all-time record against the Wildcats. 
"Northwestern is an excel­lent Big 10 baseball team," said Irish coach Pat Murphy. "Baseball is the best sport they have on campus. (Northwestern coach) Paul Stevens does an excellent job with that program." 
Northwestern currently owns a 19-25 record, 10-10 in the Big 10. On Wednesday, the Wildcats beat Valparaiso 5-2, a team that Notre Dame struggled to beat earlier in the week. 
The Irish will be trying to regain a little of the confidence that they had early in the season. In the last 13 games, the Irish are 8-4 and have dropped out of the Top 25. 
The Irish will also be limping into the contest, with starters Ed Lund (foot) and Mike Mos­hier (ankle) out with injuries. When they will return is uncer­tain, and the MCC tournament is ri~ht around the corner, May 17-20. 

Jake Kline an ND sports legend 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two-part series profiling Jake Kline, who coached the Notre Dame baseball team from 1934 to 1975. 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
Former University of Notre Dame Professor of Mathema­tics Clarence "Jake" Kline likes to play a numbers game whenever anyone asks his age. 
"I've only got six more years till I turn 100, but if you reverse the digits," I'm only 49," said Kline, who is better known for his 41 years as the Irish baseball coach. "I'll be only 59 next year." 
Kline used a similar trick in 1972, when sportswriters and peers wondered how a 77-year old could continue to coach ef­fectively. 
"I'm not 77," said Kline, born Feb. 18, 1895 (the same day as George Gipp). "You just mul­tiply seven times seven, and it comes out 49." 
Anywone who watched Kline coach at the time might have fallen for that line. Until he retired in 1975 at the age of 80, Kline still was hitting fungoes at infield practice and produc­ing winning teams. 
"I got goosebumps meeting him, "said current Irish coach Pat Murphy, a lifelong Notre

Tyson's behavior not worthy of doctorate I think it was Freud, or some other guy with a lot of time on his hands to do nothing, who said dreams are only fan­tasies that cannot come true. I hope Freud was right because the dream I had the other night turned into a nightmare. It was May 1989 at graduation ceremonies when Father Malloy began to distribute the honorary degrees. The first  
Greg Guffey Assistant Sports Editor  
names seemed deserving--President George Bush and former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Then Malloy paused for the kicker. "It gives me great honor to award this diploma to heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson," Malloy said. Mike Tyson, the man involved in more fights outside the ring than in it? Mike Tyson, the man who probably could not even complete the application to get in here? While hopefully this could never happen at Notre Dame, it did unfortunately occur last week at Ohio's Central State see TYSON I page 18  

Obserrver Staff Report 
Quarterback Kent Graham has announced he is leaving Notre Dame and transfering to another school to continue his football career. 
Graham has narrowed his choices down to Ohio State and South Carolina. He has visited both schools in the past week. He will be required to sit out one season but will have two years of elegibility remaining. 
"My main reason for leaving is the offense going away from a passing style," Graham, a junior from Wheaton, Ill. said. "It's not because of the other quarterbacks coming in. I want to go to another offense and give it a shot. I just want to find an offense that's more suitable for my talents and abilities. 
"It was a hard decision. I love Notre Dame, and I love the players and the coaches.

Peltier brings meaning to term student-athlete 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Sports Writer 
Most people do not realize the kind of hitter Notre Dame has in Dan Peltier. 
"I don't think the players on the team realize that they're playing with one of the best hitters in the game," says Head Coach Pat Murphy. "Sometimes even I don't realize what a gem I've got." 
This statement may come as a surprise to someone not familiar with the junior centerfielder. After all, being called one of the "best hitters in the game" is no small compliment. But just ask his teammates. 
"People should come out and see for themselves," says leadoff hitter Pat Pesavento. "I love to watch him hit, and I like to get on base because I know he's going to knock me in." 
Indeed, the junior from Clifton Park, N.Y., has been com­ing through with the bat this season. He leads the team in seven offensive categories, and is second on the team in three more. 
"I like the feeling that people have faith in me," says Pe_ltier. "If people have confidence in my abilities, I'm gomg to perform better. You can't let the pressure build on you because if you do, you're not going to play as well." 
Thus far Peltier has dodged the pressure associated with being a star hitter on a nationally competitive team. Coming see PELTIER I page 17 
Graham leaving Notre Dame 
Quarterback seeks offense best fitting his passing style 
The education you get here is awesome." 
Graham was the No.2 quar­terback for Notre Dame's na­tional championship team, playing behind junior starter Tony Rice. He played in 17 
' t. 
Kent Graham 
games for the Irish, starting once, against Boston College in 1987. He completed 33 of 50 passes over the two seasons good for 402 yards. 
"Tony Rice has done such an awesome job," Graham said. "Coach (Lou) Holtz has been really cool about the whole thing. He helped me any way he could to come to a decision. 
"Only a couple of close friends on the team knew," he said. "I tried to hide it. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. The guys helped me think about it. They understood where I was coming from." 
Graham said he wanted to have his transfer decision made as soon as possible, having other things on his mind. He's getting married May 20 to Courtney Krieg­baum, a student at Wheaton College. 
"I want to emphasize that I really love Notre Dame, and it is a really tough decision to leave. I'm still looking around, trying to find the best possibil­ity."
