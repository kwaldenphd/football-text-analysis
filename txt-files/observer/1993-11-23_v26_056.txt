INSIDE COLUMN NATION AT AGLANCE 

This is a horse -worth beating 
Just so all of you know, I intend to beat the living daylights out of this horse no matter how dead it might be. So, even though I swore never to write a col­umn about football here goes. 
Granted, Boston College is no Florida State when it 
comes to football. Saturday's meeting against the Eagles was hardly touted as "The 
Game of the Century." Heck, it wasn't even the game of the hour. 
No, everyone around the nation thought the Irish would de-plume the Eagles. We took the Irish for granted. We, the fans, entered the sta­dium envisioning National Championship bowl game road trips. We could not see past the "No. 1's" that filled our eyes. That was our biggest mistake. 
NBC's commentators mentioned our mistake several times during its telecast of the game. And Sunday's New York Times went as far as to label the mistake as a "sense of lethargy." 
I've always heard about the "Twelfth Man" in football. Until Saturday, I never realized its importance. 
Where were the Irish fans? I know the students were in their seats, I saw them. But, I assure you, nobody heard them. 
For the first three quarters of the game I stood among the most apathetic --no, make that pathetic -Notre Dame fans I've ever encountered. Yes, the majority of students in the stands turned their backs to the Irish before the team ever took the field. 
An old saying states that offense is played with intellect while defense is played with emo­tion. I am not saying that the Irish defense lacked emotion. I am saying that the Irish fans did nothing to heighten and sustain that emo­tion throughout the game. 
Against Florida State, when the Irish charged onto the grass, we yelled, cheered, sang and 'umped. When Irish players would turn to the students lifting their arms demanding noise we responded with a deafening volume. 
Against Boston College, when the offense and defense took the field, many Notre Dame fans chatted with friends, checked their watches and ·ust stood there. When Notre Dame's Charles Stafford lifted his arms for the fan's vocal cry o support a low murmur barely reached the field. 
We awakened no echoes. We raised no volley cheers. We shook no thunder from the sky. 
So much for mystique. 
I hate to say this, but maybe we do not deserve a national championship this year. With all my heart, I believe the Notre Dame football team deserves the championship. But the Notre Dame fans who deserted the team and filled the stadium with an appalling "sense of lethargy" do not deserve any championship at all. 
At the end of the game, I was hurt when the senior players walked off the field without rais­ing their helmets in a final salute to the senior class. I felt denied of tradition. 
In retrospect, I imagine I felt the same way the football team must have felt when their fans took the team for granted and couldn't seem to "Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame."

Sky diver collides with plane 
NORTHAMPTON, Mass. 
A sky diver struck another plane on the way down, damaging it so severely that it went into a spin and crashed. The four people on the plane were killed. The parachutist, Alfred Peters, 51, survived after hitting the tail of the single-engine Piper on Sunday. Authorities said he was free-falling, hit the plane at about 7,500 feet and then deployed his parachute. It was not immediately clear why the plane was in the sky-diving area, said Mary Culver, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. "It damaged it so severely that it went into a tailspin and never pulled out, just struck the ground," Culver said. Peters was in stable condition with a broken ankle at Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, said his wife, Joyce. "All he keeps talking about is seeing that plane coming at him," she said. "He said he had just jumped and all of a sudden there it was." She said her husband had been sky diving about four months. 
Citadel tries to keep out women 
CHARLESTON, S.C. 
Trustees of The Citadel voted Monday to ask a full fed­
eral appeals court to reconsider a ruling that a woman 
may attend day classes at the all-male, state military col­
lege. The Citadel will ask the entire 13-judge 4th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals to take up last week's decision 
by a three-judge panel that Shannon Faulkner may 
attend while her lawsuit proceeds. Citadel attorney 
Dawes Cooke would not discuss specifics of The Citadel's 
motion for a rehearing until it is filed. U.S. District Judge 
Weston Houck ruled in August that Faulkner could attend 
classes but not participate in military programs until her 
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the school's 
all-male admissions policy is decided. The 151-year-old 
school allows women in night and summer classes. 
London doctor says Jackson is improving 
LOS ANGELES 
Michael Jackson has improved after detoxification for 
painkiller addiction but needs up to two more months of 
treatment, his London doctor said Monday. "A detox­
ification program was completed today," Dr. Beauchamp 
Colclough wrote in a statement dated Saturday and 
released Monday. "After an initial 36 hours, Mr. Jackson 
started an intensive program of group therapy and one­
to-one therapy with myself." Colclough said up to two 
months of "treatment solely for his dependency to 
painkiller medication" was necessary. The statement was 
released by Jackson publicist Lee Solters. Jackson, sued 
by a 13-year-old boy who claims the entertainer molested 
him, abruptly canceled his concert tour Nov. 12 and flew 
to Europe, saying he needed treatment for addiction to 
painkillers prescribed after recent scalp surgeries. 
Customer killed in bar/truck crash 
OMAHA, Neb. 
A pickup truck crashed through the wall of a bar, killing a man who was seated at his regular bar stool. Joseph McColley, 38, of Omaha, was thrown across the bar and up against the jukebox, police said. "He'd been sitting there at the end of the bar-that was Joe's spot," said Neva Longstreth, who owns Fires Out Pub with her husband, Carl. The pickup jumped a curb, hit a no park­ing sign, veered across the road, jumped the opposite curb and ran through the bar, police said. "Just as Joe asked my husband what it was, that truck came ramrod­ding through," Longstreth said. Six other people, includ­ing the driver of the pickup, were injured in the accident early Sunday. The driver, whose license had been sus­pended for failure to pay tickets involving moving viola­tions, was ticketed on suspicion of drunken driving.

Adoptive parents indicted for abuse 
BEND, Ore. 
A couple hailed for adopting dozens of unwanted youngsters from around the world have been indicted on criminal charges in the deaths of three children and alleged mistreatment of other children. A 27 -count in­dictment made public today charges Diane and Dennis Nason with three counts of manslaughter, 15 counts of criminal mistreatment, seven counts of forgery of guardianship papers, and racketeering. The racketeering count alleges a criminal enterprise to mistreat children. The indictment was handed up Friday and released today the Deschutes County district attorney's office. The Nasons, of Sisters, haven't seen the indictment but are likely to plead innocent, said Larna Dale, their attorney. The Nasons became known around Oregon and the nation as the "Celebration Family." They adopted 76 children over the last 14 years, most of them mentally or physically disabled, and were once profiled on the CBS television program "60 Minutes." 
Sorry, Perry no longer available 
LOS ANGELES 
"Beverly Hills, 90210" hunk Luke Perry is no longer up for grabs. Perry, who plays brooding Dylan McKay on the Fox television show, exchanged marriage vows with his 24-year-old girlfriend, Minnie Sharp. "They were mar­ried in a small, private ceremony Saturday night with family and close, personal friends present," publicist Paul Bloch said Monday. It was the first marriage for Perry, 27, and his bride. The couple was honeymooning at an undisclosed location. They will live in Perry's home in the suburban San Fernando Valley. His motion picture cred­its include "Buffy, The Vampire Slayer," "Terminal Bliss" and "Scorchers." 
The Brady Bunch and birth control? 
LOS ANGELES 
Hemember that episode of "The Brady Bunch" where Marcia Brady talked about birth control with her mom, Carol? Of course not. The topic would have been unimag­inable on the 1970s sitcom. Twenty years later, Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia, is a mother herself and has been speaking at birth-control seminars at colleges across the country. "I have some friends whose lives have been really deeply affected by getting the wrong information and being afraid (as teen-agers) to talk to doctors," McCormick said. "I really feel there's a real need for something like this." McCormick, 37, has partic­ipated in five seminars sponsored by Upjohn Co. The seminars resume in Chicago in January.

GOP: Spending key to '94 race Democrats circulate video 
By JOHN KING 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX 
Conservative stands on crime, spending and taxes add up to the best formula for 1994 victo­ries, Hepublicans said Monday. They accused President Clinton of trying to co-opt those issues for Democrats but 
failing to follow~ 
words with action. The rosy GOP outlook came at a I~ e p u b I i c a n Bill Clinton 
(,overnors Association meeting, where predictions of major 1994 gains were fueled by the historical trends of midterm elections and the presence of the Republican winners of this year's state­house contests. 
As Republicans welcomed Christie Whitman of New Jersey and George Allen of Virginia into the fold, the meet­ing's tone suggested recent talk of bipartisanship from both the White House and GOP congres­sional leaders might be short­lived. 
"This is the Elmer Gantry presidency," said Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. "Bill Clinton will stand up in the bully pulpit and say anything you want to hear. lie always sounds great but the problem is what he says usually has nothing to do with what he does. We're tired of government by news confer­ence." 
Barbour said Clinton had reneged on his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut, retreated from his promise to support deep new spending cuts this fall and failed to deliv­er on a pledge to submit a crime bill to Congress. 
Barbour said Clinton promised to support spending cuts to win votes for his budget package but now was waging "a charade, a sham, a shell game" to defeat proposals in Congress calling for substantial cuts. 
In contrast, he said Republican governors had delivered on campaign promis­es to reduce taxes, hold the line on spending and streamline government bureaucracy, a contrast he urged GOP candi­dates to draw next year. 
"The tax-and-pretend Democrats need to realize the public is not stupid," Barbour said. 
Republicans will hold just 19 of the 50 governors' posts after Whitman and Allen take office in January. Both said the keys to their wins were specific promises -a 30 percent tax cut in Whitman's case and in Allen's a tough anti-crime plank that included abolishing parole for most violent offend­ers. 
"We did show in this election that you can win on ideas," said Whitman, who pledged to erase voter skepticism by deliv­ering the tax cut -a promise even many Republican leaders in her legislature have said will be tough to keep. 
She also is still trying to put to rest the storm over a top adviser's claim -quickly recanted -that her campaign paid black ministers and Democratic campaign workers to suppress black votes. 
On Monday, she said that since strategist Ed Rollins had sworn he fabricated the story, and since no one had come for­ward with evidence of any wrongdoing, she had thought the controversy "would die a faster death than it has." She said Democrats "can beat the horse for a long time" but the New Jersey public "wants to move on." 
Allen urged his GOP col­leagues to campaign as "Jeffersonian conservatives" stressing that government's role was to protect citizens from crime "but otherwise leave them free." 
Crime and taxes traditionally have been issues on which Republicans have the edge over Democrats, although the mar­gins have narrowed in recent years. 
Still, Republicans said voter focus on those issues, and what they said was Clinton's failure to follow through on his promises, should make 1994 a fertile year for GOP candidates. 
"We have a good envi­ronment and what we need to do is take advantage of that environment," declared Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, who said Republicans needed to prove the party had recovered from 1992. 
"History will not only note the 1994 election as a performance milestone on the Clinton presi­dency but it will also serve as a checkup on the health of our party," Voinovich said. "We want to make sure that what happened to our president doesn't happen to our gov­ernors." 
Voinovich noted Republicans posted gains of eight and six governorships in the last two midterm elections with Democratic presidents -1966 and 1978 -and predicted the party would gain at least seven next year. That would give them a majority. 
But the talk of optimism was tempered by a warning that the voter anger at government that helped Allen and Whitman to victory could work against GOP incumbents next year.

pitch for health reforms 
By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 
The Democratic National Committee unveiled a video­taped sales pitch for President Clinton's health reform plan Monday while a consumer group predicted that without health system changes the average family's medical bill could double by the end of the decade. 
Richard Celeste, the chair­man of the Democrats' National Health Care Campaign, said the party has made 10,000 copies of the videotape and is mailing them to the news media, groups backing health reform and grassroots organizers. 
The president himself nar­rates the sales pitch, produced at a cost of more than $125,000 by the same political team that did the "Man from Hope" video biography of Clinton at last year's Democratic National Convention. 
The Families USA Foundation, meanwhile, re­leased a study based on federal data that indicates the health bill for the average American family this year is $7,739. 
The group, which is closely aligned with the White House on health reform, estimated that bill could jump to $14,517 in the year 2000 if nothing is done to change the health care system. 
The figures include what families and businesses spend directly for health care and what they spend indirectly in taxes that pay for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. 
Families pay $5,190, or two­thirds of the $7,739 average family health bill. Businesses pay the rest, $2,549. These lig­ures cover everything: doctor bills, insurance premiums, aspirin, bandages and all other kinds of health expenditures. 
Health care now consumes 13 percent of families' pre-tax income, up from 9 percent in 1980 when $2,590 per family was spent on health care. 
Health expenditures per fam­ily ranged from a high of $9,352 in Massachusetts to a low of $5,941 in Idaho this year. 
The new Democratic video­tape includes scenes of people complaining about their inabili­ty to get insurance and its high cost. Clinton outlines his pro­posal for guaranteeing cov­erage for all Americans by 1998. "It's really pretty sim­ple," he says. 
Clinton says his bill would make it "illegal for your insurer to raise your premiums as much as they want or to drop you ... if you get sick or change jobs or lose your job." 
Celeste, the former Ohio gov­ernor who is chairman of the Democrats' reform drive, said the videotape offers an alterna­tive view to that in the health insurance industry's $10 mil­lion ad campaign attacking Clinton's proposals. 
He expressed the hope it would be aired at town meet­ings and Kiwanis Clubs to spark debates.

Foreigners fear death deadline 
By ELAINE GANLEY 
Associated Press 
ALGIERS, Algeria 
Tens of thousands of for­eigners and hundreds of Algerian journalists are waiting in fear of Dec. 1, when funda­mentalists have vowed to step up their murderous campaign against them. 
Some are living under army protection while others are regrouping in hotels. Thousands have fled the coun­try, taking a death threat by Islamic extremists seriously. 
"Terrorists dominate you even if they aren't there," said Said Mekbel, executive editor of the daily French-language newspaper Le Matin and a daily target of the threats. 
After French consular official Michele Thevenot was held hostage for a week, she was freed on Nov. 1 with an unsigned note aimed at the 70,000 foreigners living here: 
"Leave the country. You are given one month to do so. Anyone staying longer is responsible for his own sudden death ..." 
More than 2,000 people have been killed by insurgents and security forces since Islamic extremists took up arms to avenge the cancellation of parliamentary elections in January 1992, which Muslim fundamentalists were certain of winning. 
A collective leadership, hand­picked by the army, has since ruled with a heavy hand, imposing a state of emergency, carrying out raids against sus­pected Muslim militants and setting up secret courts to try alleged subversives. 
The fundamentalists' re­taliation turned from police and soldiers to intellectuals and journalists earlier this year, taking the lives of nearly two dozen. Next came foreigners, nine of whom have been killed since Sept. 21. 
Renewed terrorism against foreigners could deal a mortal blow to the crippled economy, compelling outside investors to flee. The foreign community plays a crucial role in the econ­omy, bringing in technology that helps Algeria export is petroleum and natural gas. 
Journalists, judges and intel­lectuals who are considered vulnerable are being housed under army guard at a seaside resort west of the capital. 
Mekbel receives death threats almost daily, by mail, phone or fax. He lives like a condemned man, spending sleepless nights plotting his days and donning · disguises in what he believes is a vain effort to outwit fate. . 
While there are few open signs of panic among the for­eigners, the expatriate commu­nity has braced itself in the final week of the November countdown. Some personnel from foreign companies are taking shelter at well-guarded Algiers hotels. 
The French Embassy has reduced its staff. Other diplo­matic missions have evacuated dependents. The U.S. govern­ment no longer allows children of embassy personnel to live in Algeria. 
"Our intention is to be unpre­dictable," said an official of an American company, asking not to be further identified. He said 
.

workers try to fool their would­be attackers by coming and going at odd hours, changing routes to work and sleeping at different locations. 
Algerian authorities publicly play down the threat, saying they've done everything they can to protect foreigners and their own. 
Bold talk by the government is backed up by a fierce offen­sive. Dozens of paratroopers, supported by tanks and a sur­veillance helicopter, descend on Algiers neighborhoods in daily operations to rout suspects from their hideouts. 
But there are those who doubt that strong-arm tactics can crush an increasingly elu­sive enemy. Newly formed armed groups and common bandits have latched on to the "jihad," or holy war, declared after the election debacle, creating anarchy within the Islamic ranks. 
Observers say the Islamic Salvation Front, the winning party that was banned and forced underground, has lost control of its rank-and-file. 
Rabah Kebir, spokesman for the Salvation Front's exiled unit, said in a telephone inter­view that his movement neither supports nor controls the Armed Islamic Group, consid­ered responsible for the kid­nappings. 
"It is not our policy to hurt foreigners," he said. 
But the Salvation Front's clandestine leadership inside Algeria last week warned nations supporting the regime that "their nationals (could be) struck down and their interests destroyed."

Congress ends first session with debate on Brady bill 
By DAVID ESPO 
Associated Press 
WASJIINGTON 
After a year marked by swings from confrontation to cooperation, Congress strug­gled to find common ground on a handgun control bill Monday and wrap up its business for 1993. 
Compromise legislation to extend jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed also was up for final passage, as was a bill to provide a final $18 billion to clean up the savings and loan fiasco. 
And, acting on what leaders hoped would be the final day of work for the year, the House approved a plan to remake the campaign finance Jaws, a key item on President Clinton's agenda. The 255-175 vote set up what are likely to be con­tentious negotiations with the Senate, which approved its own bill earlier in the year. 
But it was the Brady bill, pro­viding for a five-day wait for handgun purchases, that held center stage in the final hours of the year's session. 
"I think we're moving very well," Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the bill's chief Senate sponsor, said early in what promised to be a long day -and possibly night -of negotiations with the House. 
President Clinton prodded lawmakers to deliver the bill for his signature as a "Thanksgiving Day present" to a crime-weary public. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell suggested Sunday he'd favor returning after the holi­day if the bill wasn't finished. 
Whatever the outcome, the first session of the 103rd Congress -the year of 114 House freshmen and record numbers of women -was nearly over. Its main accom­plishments included enactment of Clinton's package of tax hikes and spending cuts over unanimous Hepublican opposi­tion and last week's approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, in which Hepublicans provided more votes than Democrats in both the House and Senate. 
It was clear that many law­makers were ready for the end.

Hep. Bob Livingston, R-La., briefly donned a clown's hat and a plastic red nose to poke fun at the Democrats' campaign finance bill. "It's goofy, it's complex, it's unbelievable," he said. 
The Senate was all but done for the year, although a session was set for late in the day so leaders could clear any last­minute bills, the handgun mea­sure included. 
In contrast, House leaders worked through an ambitious final-day agenda that ranged from the campaign overhaul bill to a $90 billion package of spending cuts to less weighty concerns. Among them was a bill to expand the Harry Truman Historic Site in Independence, Mo., by the addition of the Truman Farm Home, located in Grandview. 
There were these devel­opments: 
-The campaign finance bill was approved despite the reservations of many Democrats. The measure would place a $600,000 voluntary spending limit on congressional races and motivate candidates to comply by promising gov­ernment "vouchers" to defray television advertising and postage costs. It also would bar candidates from taking more than $200,000 in contributions from political action commit­tees. 
Republicans complained the bill contained no provision to pay for the vouchers, and they also wanted a flat ban on PAC contributions. 
-The House debated a mea­sure crafted by conservatives to cut spending by $90 billion over five years, largely by trimming Medicare. The White House and Democratic leaders op­posed the plan, saying the cuts should wait until next year and be part of Clinton's health care plan. 
The Senate Ethics Committee, investigating alle­gations of sexual misconduct against Sen. Bob Packwood, filed suit to enforce its subpoe­na for the Oregon Republican's diaries from 1989 through this past July. Packwood has until Dec. 6 to reply. 
-The unemployment legisla­tion, cleared Saturday by the Senate, would provide up to 13 weeks of extra benefits for one

million workers who have exhausted their basic 26 weeks of jobless help. The bill would cover those whose basic bene­fits expired between Oct. 2 and next Feb. 5. 
-The savings and loan mea­sure, also approved by the Senate over the weekend, is designed to conclude the cleanup. If all the money is spent, it will bring the total tax­payer cost of the S&L bailout to more than $150 billion since 1987. 
On handguns, the Brady bill had been seven years in the debating, and never had pas­sage seemed so close. Both the House and Senate versions require a five-business-day waiting period and a back­ground check by law enforce­ment on would-be handgun purchasers. The waiting period would end as states developed a system for an instant comput­erized check of those trying to make handgun purchases. 
One of the points of con­tention was how quickly to phase out the waiting period. 
The House bill provides for the waiting period to expire after five years. A Senate com­promise struck Saturday night to end a Republican filibuster sets the termination at four years, with the attorney general authorized to extend it for a fifth. 
House Democrats also object­ed to a Senate-passed provision permitting gun dealers to sell to other dealers from out of state. Dealers are now permitted to sell only in the states in which they are licensed. 
The measure is named for James Brady, who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Brady and his wife Sarah have been tireless advocates for the measure.

Lobbyist regulation postponed until 1994 
ByJIM DRINKARD A.5sociated Press 
WASHINGTON 
A bill to force greater dis­closure of lobbyists' activities and ban their gift-giving to members of Congress will have to wait until next year, a vic­tim of some lawmakers' wor­ries that it might curb some traditional entertainment out­ings. 
Rep. John Bryant. the main House sponsor of the bill, promised on Monday that he would revive the measure after.. Congress returns next year from its holiday break. His Judiciary subcommittee unanimously endorsed the bill late Monday. 
"I want to make clear to everybody that we're serious about it," said the Texas Democrat. 
But failure to bring the bill to the full House meant Speaker Thomas Foley, D· Wash., had fallen short of his public commitment to pass it . before adjournment. 
Foley had pledged to reform­minded freshmen that he would schedule action on the bill which would close lobby registration exemptions and ban most gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers -including meals, theater tickets and rounds ofgolf. 
Foley had argued such gifts were not a real problem. He said as recently as Sunday that the gift han would help correct a public perception that law­makers are influenced by lob­byists who ply them with meals, drinks and other bene· fits. "Many members of Congress want to make it clear that they are willing to have all these gifts prohibited," he said. 
The hill approved by Bryant's subcommittee would allow lawmakers to continue to participate in expense-paid charity golf, ski and tennis events and to receive travel expenses for fact-fmding trips. Such events still would have to be reported on their annual fi­nancial disclosure forms. 
Another gap remained: lob­byists could still take a mem­ber of Congress to dinner if their client -a corporate executive, for example -were present. 
The Senate passed its ver­sion of the disclosure bill in May, designed to replace a web of conflicting, exemption­riddled lobbying laws with a single statute aimed at more fully disclosing how special interests seek to influence gov­ernment policy. 
But the House version stalled after it became entangled with the gifts issue. Some House members of both parties ­dubbed by some leadership aides "the golf caucus" -qui­etly leaned on their leaders to leave untouched the current rules. which allow lawmakers to accept favors like meals, golf outings, and theater and sports tickets. 
President Clinton supports the bill as part of a package of government reform measures that includes changes in the fi­nancing of political campaigns and slowing the so-called "revolving door" between gov­ernment and business.

Doctor dies at Kevorkian's hom.e U.N. team reports no 

By DAVID GOODMAN 
Associated Press 
ROYAL OAK, Mich. 
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was pre­sent today when a fellow physi­cian died by inhaling car­bon monox­
ide, less than a month after Kevorkian was freed on bail on a charge of ille­gally assisting 

a suicide. Dr. Jack 
It was the Kevorkian second death attended by Kevorkian in an apartment next to his Oakland County home in a month and the 20th he has attended since 1990, his lawyer's office said. 
Lawyer Michael Schwartz issued a statement saying Kevorkian was present when Dr. Ali Khalili "mercifully ended his life in the face of con­stant and unremitting pain caused by the cancer known as multiple myeloma." 
A spokeswoman for Schwartz who refused to give a name said Khalili, whose cancer affected his bones and marrow, had inhaled carbon monoxide. 
Kevorkian, 65, already faces two charges of illegally assist­ing a suicide, a felony, in Wayne County. He is free on bail in those cases and is chal­lenging the constitutionality of the law. 
Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair urged Oakland authorities to arrest Kevorkian and "see that he is basically detained in the Oakland County Jail until his date of trial." 
Police Lt. Don Novak said offi­cers were called shortly before 
8:30 a.m. by an unidentified male reporting a "medicide," Kevorkian's term for doctor­assisted suicide. He said the body of the 61-year-old man was found on a couch in the apartment. 
Kevorkian spent about two hours at police headquarters, leaving without comment. Novak said Kevorkian appar­ently refused to answer detec­tives' questions. 
Khalili was a practicing doc­tor who also taught part time at Northwestern University, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, university spokesman Chuck Loebbaka said. He lived in Oak Brook, another suburb. 
His cancer had progressed to the point where his bones were fracturing, and he had a mor­phine pump to control his pain, Schwartz's statement said. 
Novak said Khalili's body was in an apartment Kevorkian leases but does not use as his home. Kevorkian lives in the apartment next door. 
On Oct. 22. Merian Frederick, a 72-year-old Ann Arbor woman suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, inhaled car­bon monoxide in Kevorkian's presence at the same apart­ment where Khalili was found. 
An autopsy declared her death a homicide and police gave their report to Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson. Thompson's office did not return a phone call this morning.

enacted earlier this year specif­ically to stop him. The retired pathologist faces separate trials next year in the deaths of can­cer patient Donald O'Keefe and Lou Gehrig's disease patient Thomas Hyde. 
Kevorkian says the law is an unconstitutional invasion of pri­vacy. Wayne County Circuit Judge Cynthia Stephens struck down the law in May, but the Michigan Court of Appeals stayed her ruling while it reviews the case. Meanwhile, the law remains in effect. 
Kevorkian was jailed earlier this month when his bail was raised to $20,000 following Frederick's death. Kevorkian, who had vowed to starve him­self to death in jail, refused solid food, accepting only juice, water and vitamins, during his stay. But he was freed after three days when he was bailed out by a lawyer who said he was tired of Kevorkian's head­line-grabbing. 
Schwartz said Kevorkian would resume his modified hunger strike if jailed again. The lawyer claimed the image of his client "starving to death" while the prosecutor is feasting at Thanksgiving "would not sit well with the public." 
proof of chemical attack 
By NABILA MEGALLI 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain 
U.N. experts found no clear­cut evidence that Iraq attacked dissident Shiite Muslims with poison gas, but a final conclu­sion will require lengthy labo­ratory tests, a U.N. statement said Monday. 
"No immediate evidence of the use of chemical weapons was obtained," said a written statement by the U.N. commis­sion that monitors Iraq's defense industries under the Gulf War cease-fire accords. 
The statement was issued after the U.N. team visited Iraq's southern marshes Friday and Saturday. It came as Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz began lobbying at U.N. headquarters in hopes of get­ting the U.N. oil embargo lifted. 
A conclusion that Iraq did use chemical weapons would be a powerful setback to Iraq's efforts to get economic sanc­tions eased and the oil embargo lifted. 
Iraq, which is known to have used chemical weapons on sev­eral occasions in the 1980s, has denied reports its soldiers at­tacked Shiite villagers in the marshes about six weeks ago with poison gas. 
The U.N. commission first investigated on the Iranian side of the border, interviewing peo­ple and taking samples of soil, water, plants and animals. It then investigated inside Iraq, taking similar kinds of samples. 
The samples are being sent to various laboratories in Europe. 
Roger Hill, a chemical weapons expert who headed the nine-member team, said results might be inconclusive because traces of the chemicals could have disappeared in the weeks following the alleged at­tacks. 
"Chemicals have a habit of dissipating very quickly in the environment," he said. "The results are not that easy to determine after such a period of time." 
Hill said no marsh inhabi­tants in Iraq were interviewed, even though the team was not prevented from doing so by Iraqi officials. 
"It was realistic not to," he said, alluding to the possible threat of retribution to the inhabitants by authorities. 
Nation, economy slips with aging ruler 
By MICHELLE FAUL 
Associated Press 
ABIDJAN, IvoryCost 
A sliding economy, ethnic bloodshed, strikes by utility workers. An aging leader who returns from abr()ad on a stretcher. 
Ivory Coast, West Africa's island of stability, suddenly seems as fragile as the health of President Felix Houphouet­Boigny, the man who has shaped and defined this nation for 33 years. 
Ivorians are openly asking: What happens when the "Old Man," as he likes to be called, finally dies? 
'"'Thanks to Houphouet we have never been at war. But there are sure to be problems, ethnic problems, if he dies," said shopkeeper Claude Kouakou Kouassi. 
Houphouet-Boigny came home last week after a six­month stay in France and Switzerland, where he received the continent and accepted it for his own country in 1960. 
His official age is 88, but peo­ple here say his birthdays don't keep up with the calendar. 
His declining health coincides with an unusual period of tur­bulence for this country of 12 million people. 
Thousands of government workers have not been paid since September. Electricity and gas company workers cut services to half the country on Monday. Upaid doctors said they would begin striking on Wednesday. 
Earlier this month, Ivorians burned alive and hacked or beat to death scores of Ghanaians after Ghana defeat­ed Ivory Coast in a soccer match. More than 4,000 Ghanaians living here have returned home. 
The attacks were a sign of brewing resentment against foreigners, who make up one­third of the population, as times get harder in this once-pros­
At the elite International School, children practiced an emergency drill and were told the school could shelter and feed them for two days. 
The government newspaper Fraternite Matin said most Ivorians were praying for the president "because the country, confronted by enormous socio­economic difficulties, still needs his experience and lucidity." 
Houphouet-Boigny shares the blame for the nation's trepida­tion because he has dominated every facet of national life. He also has repeatedly changed the rules of succession and choice of successor, settling most recently on Henri Konan Bedie, president of the House of Assembly. 
Under a constitutional amendment, Bedie would gov­ern until elections sch.eduled for 1995 if the president no longer can.

Gordon unveils theories on JFK assassination 
By ELIZABETH MARTIN News Writer 
John Gordon. EdD, revealed his theory on the John F. Kennedy assassination on the 30th year anniversary of JFK's death. Still. Gordon believes, the controversy may never be settled. 
Gordon, a consultant to ABC, NBC, and PBS. and an advisor to the California State Archives, gave his ninth JFK lecture at Saint Mary's College last night. Though he unveiled several conspirator theories in his two hour lec­ture, he personally believes that three conspirators were involved in the assassination of.JFK. 
Anti-Castro Cubans, the CIA. and people involved in orga­nized crime teamed up to assassinate the President, in Gordon's estimation. Gordon contests that anti-Castro Cubans felt sold out by Kennedy, the mafia felt threatened by the recent crackdown on organized crime, and that several CIA agents, who were fired after the Bay of Pigs investigation, were angry. 
Gordon believes that all

autopsy reports, Gordon found a number of inconsistencies. The famous out-take of Kennedy's head and body recoiling back and to the left was augmented by footage of ballistics tests, which under­lined the fact that only a shot from Kennedy's front right would cause him to react in the precise way that he did. 
Interviews at the time of the shooting found that over two­thirds of the eyewitnesses thought the shots came from in front of Kennedy. 
Enhanced sections of pho­tographs taken at the time of the shooting were displayed by Gordon that actually corrobo­rate ~mold's much-maligned account and make the case for a gunman firing from in front of Kennedy. 
While allowing that Oswald three groups had an over­whelming interest to partici­pate in a joint assassination attempt on Kennedy. The three groups, according to Gordon, came together for the assassination and, "set (Lee Harvey) Oswald up as the patsy.n 
Gordon does not subscribe to the single bullet theory, nor does he simply think three bullets were shot. Gordon proposes that there were up to six bullets used on Nov. 22, 1963, in an attempt to kill Kennedy. 
"I believe that shots came from the front and behind," said Gordon. 
Three of these bullets, according to him, directly bit Kennedy. One bullet was taken by Governor Connally, one ricocheted off the wind­shield, and one bullet hit a bystander. 
Gordon admits his theory is speculative. and holds that the mystery will probably never be solved because so many of the people involved in this tragically historic event are now deceased. However, thirty years later, conspiracy theories are still being unveiled. 
may have been implicated in the plot, Gordon asserted that the worst he could have been was "a patsy." 
Interviews with Dallas police officers painted a very different picture of Oswald than what has been shown to the public. Instead of the ideologically­minded Marxist killer who wanted everyone to "know his name" after the shooting, he was shown as a scared and embarrassed young man. 
Gordon also produced pic­tures of the arrangement of Oswald's sniper perch in the Book Depository taken the day after the assassination that are nothing like those found in the Warren Report. 
These photos showed that Oswald could not have shot through the half-open corner window, as the Warren Report stated. Instead Gordon pointed out eyewitness accounts of a man with a rifle in another sixth floor window, this one wide open and possessing a clearer view of the street. 
Neo-fascists successful in election 
By VICTOR L SIMPSON Associated Press 
ROME 
Instead of black shirts, the wear business suits and design­er clothes. They write off vio­lent skinheads as "empty heads" yet march through cen­tral Home giving the stiff-armed Fascist salute. 
They also proclaim them­selves the heirs of Benito Mussolini and his Fascist move­ment. 
After years out in the cold, considered pariahs by many on Italy's political scene, support­ers of the Italian Social Movement achieved their biggest electoral success Sunday. 
In local elections that pro­duced sharp setbacks to dis­credited mainstream parties, the Italian Social Movement was the top vote-getter in Home and Naples. Its candidates will be in mayoral runoff elections in both cities. Other MSI can­didates did well elsewhere in the country. 
Alessandra Mussolini, the dic­tator's 30-year-old grand­daughter, won about 30 per­cent of the Naples vote to force a runoff with a leftist candi­date, according to projections and partial returns. 
The race in Rome was even closer, with the party's national leader, Gianfranco Fini, report­ed just a few percentage points behind another leftist-backed candidate. 
Mussolini, a former actress, has not denied that identifica­tion with her grandfather brought her votes. 
Speaking to reporters after Sunday's election, she empha­sized that point, saying the name "represents immortal values that cannot be can­celed." 
The MSI has 50 seats in Parliament and consistently gathered about 6 percent of the national vote. However, it has long been shunned by the tradi­tional parties. 
Italy's postwar constitution bans the revival of the Fascist Party. But the city of Home has allowed some Mussolini-era buildings to remain and an obelisk bearing the name "Duce," his title as dictator. 
Mussolini ruled from 1922 until he was ousted from power in 1943 and slain. 
The MSI platform stresses the need for public order. controls on immigration and the death penalty, outlawed since World War II, for certain crimes. 
Alessandra Mussolini often pays tribute to her grandfather, praising him for restoring pride in Italians. However, she has taken issue with his racial laws that foreshadowed the deporta­tion of Jews to Nazi concentra­tion camps. 
In the Rome race, Fini worked hard at a mainstream approach and attributed much of his success to his showing in poorer areas of the capital, pre­viously leftist strongholds. Campaign posters depicted him with a jacket slung over his shoulder in what newspapers described as an attempt at a "yuppie look." 
Lebanon commemorates independence 
By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon 
The army paraded its modest military might Monday in cele­bration of Lebanon's 50 years of independence, but grim re­minders of the country's shaki­ness were not hard to find. 
Shortly before the parade got under way in Beirut, Iranian­backed guerrillas fired mortars at Israeli troops in Israeli-con­trolled southern Lebanon. No casualties were reported from the clash at Tallousah, security sources said on condition of anonymity. 
Later, a pair of Israeli jets shattered the sound barrier overhead as President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Hafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri received foreign diplomats and well-wishers at the presidential palace in sub­urban Baabda. • 
The sonic booms alarmed no one, since Israel has patrolled Lebanon's air space for years without serious challenge. 
But the hostilities under­scored the government's inabil­ity to maintain law and order in Lebanon, where troops from foreign armies are still vying for control after two civil wars, two Israeli invasions and strong Syrian intervention. 
The parade was held under tight security at a crossing that was no-man's land during the 1975-90 civil war. Thousands of people were killed by sniper fire or shelling from Christian and Muslim militias on the crossing dividing east and west Beirut. 
The civil war left the country in shambles, with 70 percent of its territory under Syrian con­trol and 10 percent under Israeli occupation. 
A force of 5,600 U.N. peace­keepers from 10 countries polices part of south Lebanon, an area that overlaps with Israel's security zone. 
On Monday. all approaches to the parade route were sealed off by troops and police. People watched on balconies from a distance, or on television. Jet­fighters built in the 1950s swooped overhead, and columns of tanks and armored personnel carriers rumbled past. 
"The army is the people's defender against the morons from all faiths who have 
destroyed our country." said Al1med Natour, a Shiite Muslim vegetable vendor, as he watched the display. 
"Without them, peace and reconstruction cannot be safe­guarded," said Samira Yazbeck, a 26-year-old Maronite Catholic school­teacher. 
Since the end of the civil war, army commander Gen. Emile Lahoud has restructured the army on a non-sectarian basis and boosted its number from 37,000 to 45,000, including 12 mixed combat brigades made up of 2,500 Muslim and Christian soldiers each. 
In the Israeli-occupied strip in south Lebanon, students marched Monday in the streets of Hasbaya, Bint Jbeil and Marjayoun, provincial capital of the zone, waving Lebanese flags and shouting inde­pendence slogans. 
Similar parades were held in the northern port of Tripoli and the southern port city of Sidon. 
Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire until World War I. It came under French mandate in 1920 and gained independence in 1943.

President's nudge helps American Airlines settle dispute 
By SUSAN HIGHTOWER 
Associated Press 
The American Airlines strike is over, President Clinton announced today. 
With a nudge from Clinton, the two sides agreed to accept binding arbitration to end their increasingly bitter dispute. Union members agreed to go back to work and the airline agreed not to lire them. 
The walkout, which began Thursday, was costing the air­line more than $10 million a day, disrupting travel for thou­sands and threatening to bring chaos to airports during the upcoming Thanksgiving week­end. 
"I have spoken with both par­ties involved. Both have agreed in principle to end the strike and return to the bargaining table immediately," Clinton said at a White House news conference. 
At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, a big cheer went through a long line of pickets as they heard the news on the radio, huddled together, fists raised, chanting "Unity Now." 
Clinton encouraged both sides "to now return to work togeth­er without any bitterness and

Indiana passengers breathe sigh of relief

INDIANAPOLIS 
Passengers at Indianapolis International Airport hoping to get home for the holidays said Monday they were relieved the American Airlines strike was over, though flight schedules might not return to normal until the weekend. 
Union members agreed to go back to work and the airline agreed not to fire them. Flight attendants who had been pick­eting outside the Indianapolis airport since Thursday were gone Monday.

Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines, one of the nation's largest, had no imme­diate comment but scheduled a news conference. The tele­phone at the union, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, was busy. 
Clinton, who announced the settlement at midafternoon EST, said the two sides agreed that the flight attendants would return without any loss of jobs. 
dent who was on his way to Dallas to see his family for Thanksgiving, said he thought he would have to fly another airline to get home. 
"I had been worrying about it the past two days,'' Stone said. "It's nice not to have to worry about it anymore. 
"I think it was a pretty effec­tive way to get their point across," he added. 
The union walked out Thursday in a contract dispute over pay, medical benefits, staffing and work rules. The strike was to extend through Sunday, the end of the busy holiday travel period. 
Donna Maddux said she 
American had threatened to fire the strikers. The union rep­resents 21,000 American employees. 
He praised both sides, who were "willing to be brought to this point. I have to give them a large share of the credit. They were willing to have us work toward this. It all fell into place about an hour ago. I feel quite good about it." 
Said striker Loren Pastirik: "Yes, there was a real risk of thought the flight attendants had done the right thing, but others were not so sure. 
"It certainly was a lack of responsibility for them to strike during the holidays," said Harold Broo, of Kokomo. "Travel affects a helluva lot more people than the one who (are) traveling. I think these people need to exercise some sort of responsibility toward their customers."

losing our jobs. I think it's going to take a while for passengers to trust American again, but it's a great feeling right now.... We wanted to work. We did what we needed to do. We wanted respect from the company." 
The union walked out Thursday in a contract dispute over pay, medical benefits, staffing and work rules. The strike was to extend through Sunday, the end of the busy holiday travel period. 
"I think it's a pretty selfish thing to do at this time of year," said Elizabeth Moser, 23, whose flight from Los Angeles to a honeymoon in Hawaii was delayed Sunday. 
It was the first walkout by flight attendants at American and the biggest against a U.S. airline since 1989. 
Many of American's flights have flown without passengers since the strike began because they have not had the federally required number of flight atten­dants. 
American Chairman Robert L. Crandall had estimated between a half and two-thirds of the flights would not carry passengers this week. He said the airline's losses were "cer­tainly more than $10 million a day. They may be substantially more than that." 
He had rejected the sugges­tion by Denise Hedges, presi­dent of the flight attendants' union, that he join her in asking the National Mediation Board to recommend that Clinton create a presidential emergency board to referee the dispute. A presi­dential emergency board involving an airline has not been created since the mid­1960s. 
Long distance calling may pass through cable wire 
By DIANE DUSTON 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
MCI Communications Corp. and a leading cable television company announced an experi­ment Monday that will allow consumers to use their cable TV wire for long-distance call­ing. 
Although the telephone com­panies have been moving quick­ly to establish relationships with cable companies that will lead to interactive television services, the trial by MCI and Jones Lightwave, Inc. is the first time a cable TV company will offer phone service. 
The announcement coincided with the introduction of a House bill that would break up monopoly control of local tele­phone markets and repeal rules against phone companies offer­ing television services in their own service areas. 
Both lawmakers and telecom­munications company execu­tives say consumers eventually should be able choose from sev­eral competing companies for cable TV and local telephone service. 
The first MCI-Jones trial, scheduled for March in Alexandria, Va., will allow resi­dential users to bypass the Bell Atlantic local phone company to make long-distance calls. 
Later, another test will be set up in a Chicago suburb that will allow both local and long-dis­tance calling over the cable TV wire, bypassing Ameritech. The suburb hasn't been named yet, but it will be one.. currently hooked to the Jones Intercable Inc., the nation's eighth largest cable system, officials said. 
The approximately 50 users in the first test will be employ­ees of either MCI or Jones, which serves Alexandria. Jones Lightwave is an affiliate of Jones Intercable. A third part­ner in the trial is Scientific­Atlantic Inc., a leading elec­tronics supplier. 
Alexandria also is the site of a Bell Atlantic trial among some of its employees of interactive television services. 
Jones and MCI officials said at a news conference that con­sumers will get superior phone service over cable TV wiring because it has greater capacity. 
The bill relieves many of the restrictions corporate America has been pushing against, but preserves universal access to phone service by requiring companies that get into the phone business to subsidize phone service to areas that are not financially lucrative. This currently is required of the monopoly phone companies. 
Clinton pressured to complete global trade deal 
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
President Clinton has less than a month to strike a global free-trade agreement while coping with demands from angry French farmers, upset Brazilian citrus growers and furious textile workers just about everywhere. 
The president and others in the administration are profess­ing optimism they can over­come all these obstacles and complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks by a Dec. 15 dead­line. Those negotiations, involv­ing 110 nations, are being held under the auspices of the 
Geneva-based  General  
Agreement  on Tariffs  and  
Trade.  

The United States and the 12­nation European Community hoped to resolve differences on a range of issues separating them during the talks Monday and Tuesday. They include 
BUSINESS BRIEFS 
farm subsidies and tariffs on textiles and other manufac­tured goods and European bar­riers to American-made films and television shows. 
Economists say the stakes for the Uruguay Round are enor­mous -holding out the possi­bility of increasing global out­put by $270 billion over the next decade. But neither the United States nor the EC showed any willingness to com­promise as this week's talks began. 
The United States insisted it will never yield to a French demand that it renegotiate pro­visions of a deal reached a year ago to reduce the use of farm subsidies. 
The Clinton administration insists that its come-from­behind victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating a free­trade zone linking the United States, Mexico and Canada, will give it the momentum needed to wrap up the global talks.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Keenan Review intended to be some "good-natured satire" 
Dear Editor: 
We are compelled to respond to the allegations made against the Keenan Revue in the article "Keenan Revue Location Discussed" printed on Tuesday, Nov. 16, 1993. Understanding the concerns expressed by the women of Saint Mary's, we would like to correct several untruths and inaccuracies in the article. 
Few people understand the process by which skits are se­lected for the Hevue. During the initial stage, a two-fold screen­ing process occurs: those skits which are not funny are cut, and those which are deemed too offensive are eliminated. After our self-screening process, the skits must pass a review-board which eonsists of our own reetor, as well as the rectors of several women's halls. 
Given these faets, it is highly unlikely that any skits making fun of sensitive personal issues such as rape, eating disorders and alcoholism would be al­lowed in the Revue. In fact, the claim that Keenan residents would even consider these hor­rible things humorous offends us grnatly. 
Hevue skits have in the past 
DOONESBURY 
satirized all aspects of campus life. But the Revue has been just that -satire. We never in­tend to assault any individual or anyone's character; rather, we joke about the oddities of life under the Dome. 
Everything from our own ath­letic stars to national politicians to the administration is likely to be satirized in the Revue. Whether from Saint Mary's or Notre Dame, women are equal recipients of the satire. Moreover, women on either campus are not portrayed as victims of rape, having eating disorders or being alcoholics. 
There is a fine line between good-natured satire and mali­cious humor. It is a line which we in Keenan Hall are ex­tremely careful not to cross.

THE ULTIMATE "FALL FROM GRACE" 
Notre Dame bonded by compassion 
Dear Editor: 
We would like to begin by first coming right out and say­ing what the purpose for this letter is. We want to express our immeasurable gratitude to the entire University, both stu­dents and faculty, for their sup­port through this tragic ordeal. 
Losing a loved one is unfor­tunately, an experience many have to endure, but to lose one in such a tragedy as this past FSU weekend, it makes it near impossible to fully recover. We left for Virginia with dim hopes of continuing our education at this University, feeling that we could not handle the pressures, as well as the reminders. 
Although Mara was here for only 2 months, she left lasting memories of her presence ev­erywhere she went. We were unsure of what to expect when we arrived back in South Bend, . especially being right after the 

big FSU weekend. 
What we found when we re­
turned from Mara's funeral, 
was a school filled with open 
arms and bonded by compas­
sion. The support we have re­
ceived through letters, mes­
sages, and flowers was beyond 
any expectation we could have 
imagined. The memorial mass. 
this past Tuesday (Nov. 16) 
evening, was not just a beauti­sign of the love and support shared by this Notre Dame community. 
When Mara's parents asked us to never forget her, we knew we never would, but now through all you have done for us, Mara's family, and Mara, we are sure Mara's memory will forever be a part of our Notre Dame family. Thank you once again for all the prayers and the support.

poor taste and lack of respect 

Dear Editor: 
Lack of respect, poor taste, and bad timing all describe David Hungeling's Inside Column, "Champs? We're Not Worthy" (The Observer, Nov. 15). If Hungeling's intention was one of humor and sarcasm, he failed miserably in the tim­ing of his article. 
The over-consumption of al­cohol, one of the suggestions for celebrating the victory over FSU, took the life of a beautiful young lady right here in our Notre Dame family. Mara Fox's life was tragically ended due to one person's irresponsible use of alcohol. Does it take a pre­cious life for us to realize that the abuse of alcohol does not determine whether one is cele­brating or not? Fox's death has affected the lives of many who knew and loved her, changing them forever. The Women of Lyons Hall, including myself, have struggled with the tragic

events of Friday night. 
Hungeling's article revealed a lack of sensitivity and respect to those mourning this devastating loss. Mara Fox's sudden and tragic death puts things into perspective, the celebration of life must take precedence over the celebra­tion of a football victory.

VIEWPOINT 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Advertisement fairly questions 'whole truth' 
Dear Editor: 
The debate over whether or not to publish the ad (The Observer, Nov. 18) by the CODOH (which "was founded to promote a free exchange of ideas about the Holocaust story") interests me greatly. As students. we can learn impor­tant lessons by examining the treatment given to this ad by both The Observer and Father Edward Malloy in his letter to the editor. 
I strongly feel that both The Observer and Malloy have dis­played anti-intellectual inclina­tions which are a much more dangerous anathema to a learning institution than any open debate proposed by the CODOII ad. 
First. Malloy states as his pol­icy, "Bigotry and hate, whether expressed in print or in deed ... are anathema to everything this University stand(s) for and will not be tolerated." This is indeed an enlightened policy, for to encourage (or ignore) hate and bigotry would serve to snuff out all intellectual growth and free­dom so dear to the University climate. 
However. we must judge whether his policy is relevant to the CODOH ad. The college newspapers of Ohio State University, the University of Michigan. and Duke University chose to publish the CODOH ad (as noted by The Observer). Is Malloy ready to indict these newspapers (and the colleges which they serve) for promoting hate, bigotry, or the principles of the CODOH itselr? Maybe he is, but this would involve an unfortunate mischar­acterization of those institu­tions, of the meaning of free 
Decision to print ad threatens credibility of The Observer 
Dear Editor: 
When I first saw the adver­tisement from the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH) in The Observer (Nov. 18), I skipped over it because I had a pretty good idea what was going to be written in it. My curiosity, how­ever. got the best of me, and I decided to read the "info-ad." As I expected, Smith's "revi­sionist's view" is more along the lines of an exclusionist's view of the Holocaust. 
I do not understand why peo­ple are unwilling to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust. CODOH does not believe that six million Jews and millions of non-Jews were killed in the Holocaust. What happened to these people then? That many human beings do not just dis­appear. 
Smith attacks the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for not providing "proof' that the gas chambers existed at the German concentration camps. Maybe he should visit one of the camps. 
This past summer. I had the opportunity to visit Dachau. one of the smaller concentration camps. The ovens and the gas chambers are there for all to see. An air of death lingers over the camp to this day. Pictures of the techniques used there and at other camps fill the Museum on the site. It was one of the saddest things I've ever seen and I felt sick to my stom­ach the entire time I was at speech, and of the CODOH ad. For does the ad really promote hate or bigotry in print or In deed? 
Even if. as in the most ex­treme case scenario, the CODOH holds the belief that the Holocaust never happened (which is not explicit in the ad), the organization does favor open debate of the issue. Nowhere in the ad is it sug­gested to take action against Jewish people or any other peo­ple explicitly or in deed. Hate or bigotry is not even implied by the words of the ad, and to read hatred and/or bigotry into the ad smacks of political agenda pushing. 
In fact, the attempt of Malloy to label the CODOH ad as hate­ful or as promoting bigotry plays into the hands of the CODOH ad as explained in paragraph seven of the ad un­der the section, "What are the facts?" Again the CODOH has been labeled as being utterly hateful (anti-Semitic), simply for having questioned the ve­racity of all that is proposed by those who set up the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
Malloy's condemnation of the CODOH ad as being hateful and his refusal to promote open de­bate of the issue only function to prolong any false ideas held by Notre Dame students about the Holocaust. Why is Malloy afraid of open debate on the legitimacy of all the facts? Possibly he thinks that the ob­jections to the museum raised by the CODOH are so unbeliev­able as to not merit the effort it would require to refute them. 
However. as the Roper poll in the ad suggests, 22 percents of people have doubts about the 
Dachau. 
Smith also suggests that the inmates that died from disease were not victims of the Holocaust. It is true that many people in the concentration camps died from diseases that spread because of the poor liv­ing conditions. But, they prob­ably never would have died from these diseases if they hadn't been imprisoned by the Nazis. The Nazis are as morally responsible for these deaths as for any deaths caused by more direct means. 
Finally, I am extremely dis­appointed with the staff of The Observer. I firmly believe in the First Amendment guarantee for a free press. Nevertheless, I cannot agree with your deci­sion to accept this advertise­ment. If you had refused to run the ad, you would have been guilty of nothing. Censorship is not an issue here. Your staffs lack of judgment is. 
Time and again during the last four years, The Observer has made some very poor deci­sions. This is just the latest ex­ample. It may be time to get a moderator for the paper who has some professional journal­istic experience. When will you realize that the paper's credi­bility is threatened every single time you make an error of judgment?

orthodox Holocaust story. The truth or fiction of this statistic is debatable, but the burden of proving it false lies with the ob­jector. For Malloy to disregard the opinions of 22 percent of America is a slight to them. Surely he would not support that a 22 percent data error is acceptable in a scientific exper­iment, so why is it acceptable for him to brush the 22 percent disagreement aside as unwor­thy of his attention? Even if the statistic is wrong, and really only 0.0 percent of people doubt the orthodox Holocaust story, I still can see no harm in 
an open debate of the facts. 
Malloy has thus shown him­self to be anti-intellectual, against open debate, and even worse -for the proliferatfon of misconceptions and ignorance of the students at this University. Would it were not so for such a respected man among so many students here. 
The Observer has shown con­siderably more level-head­edness in its treatment of the issue. By convening The Observer's General Board and hosting an internal debate over the best way to handle the ad, the staff of The Observer should be applauded. Though I would see no harm in simply running the ad (rather, I see benefit) as it was on 18 Nov .. perhaps to attach a disclaimer below the ad as is done with the "Inside Column," for example, would be appropriate so that it is clear that the CODOH views are not those of The Observer. 
Unfortunately, this is where The Observer's reason stops and its less reasonable instincts take over. They are guilty of reading into the ad at the cost 
Observer doesn't realize its mistake 
of preserving the truth of the ad. For David Kinney (Editor­in-ChieO to state that, "The un­derlying premise of the adver­tisement was that the Holocaust never actually happened," is presumptuous and not provable from the text of the ad. 
The essence of the ad is that certain deceptions are being made with regard to the Holocaust (especially the gas chambers) as presented at the museum. Some supporting ev­idence is given in the ad for that statement. Kinney also writes that the ad argues that there is no proof of the gassing of Jews by Germans. This state­ment of his is indeed rendered false after a closer reading of the ad. The ad does not main­tain that there is no proof, only that there is no proof offered by the museum and that the proof being offered is questionable. 
The ad does not exclude the possibility of gassing, even though it notes certain missing evidence of the Holocaust. only that it has not yet been suffi­ciently proven. Everyone should recognize that there is a differ­ence between tearing down existing evidence and maintain­ing as true the claim that some­thing didn't happen. The for­mer is done in the ad, but the latter is just not. 
Granted, it is easy, given a healthy dose of cynicism and a dash of separate agenda, to draw hasty and false conclu­sions from this ad -especially considering the sometimes in­flammatory language used. Both The Observer and Malloy have drawn such conclusions. I challenge them both to prove me wrong, for I really don't want to think that such a blun­der can be made by such cred­ible entities. 
The lesson for the students that can be learned from so ex­amining the treatment of this ad by both The Observer and Malloy is that one must be care­ful to not read too much into text. Please do not condemn the text or the creators of the text for what is not in the text. I would hope that we can all agree that anti-Semitism is wrong, but I would also hope that we can have the insight to see when it is not anti-Semitism that is being discussed. Let us think back to historical assump­tions that have been altered or proven to be skew through scholarly inquest. .. the "dis­covery of the new world" by Columbus, the claim that all American soldiers were gone from Vietnam when announced, the assassination of JFK by Oswald, that smoking doesn't cause cancer, the Ptolomaic view that the earth is the center of the solar system, etc. There was a time in Spanish history when Columbus was given no recognition for his work in bringing Spanish culture to the western hemisphere. 
It was only through question­ing of and debate over the ac­cepted truth which brought his name the proper recognition for his accomplishments. It would seem strange that Malloy is all for the "full airing" of this incident while he seems so closed to the "airing" of the whole truth of the Holocaust ­whatever it may be.

serve their reading community. These editors do not allow just anyone to be in their papers. 
The anti-Semitic ad printed on Thursday does not serve our Catholic community. I pray that everyone here at ND/SMC who read the ad was as of­fended as I was. Furthermore, because individuals in our com­munity are forced to indirectly support The Observer, we can­not even boycott it. 
Sadly. The Observer learned nothing from last year's expe­rience with an anti-Semitic ar­ticle. It the duty of the greatest Catholic university in the world to fight hate, not provide a fo­rum for it. The motto of the New York Times is "All the News That's Fit for Print". Kinney is under no Constitutional obligation to give a forum to every crackpot's message in our newspaper. 
I shudder to think The Observer would give a forum to Nazis, the KKK, or other hate­ful groups without thinking about the potential implications to our community. The Constitution gives journalists everywhere in America the choice to do right or wrong ev­eryday. Unfortunately, the staff of our newspaper chose to do ... wrong. Jesus Christ taught us that we can never do wrong when we act out of love for our community. I hope the next time is faced with running a hateful message the staff will choose to love our community instead of blatantly ignoring its needs.

Dear Editor: 
When I read CODOH's adver­tisement in The Observer (Nov. 18), I felt I had an obligation to write to The Observer for the first time. I was temporarily calmed when I read "Observer apologizes" written across the top of Friday's paper (Nov. 19). However, as I read David Kinney's explanation, my hope that The Observer had realized its tragic mistake was quickly squashed. 
Kinney fails to realize the dif­ference between his liberty to print such an advertisement, .and his moral obligation not to give forum to such a hateful advertisement in our communi­ty's paper. Unlike other publi­cations that students can choose to support or not sup­port through purchase, the Editor-in-Chief of The Observer has a special obligation to rep­resent our ND/SMC community 
because  we  cannot  decide  
whether  or  not to buy The  
Observer.  

Anyone can read our news­paper, however we students support The Observer indirectly when we choose to come here and ultimately be represented by it. Furthermore, Kinney fails to take full responsibility for what is printed. 
Kinney writes in his explana­tion that "Our decision was not based on whether it [the adver­tisement] was hateful or harm­ful to members of the commu­nity." It saddens me to believe that the newspaper editing staff at a school as important as ours could display such a lack of ethics. 
Whether or not the ad was hateful or harmful to our com­munity should be the primary factor in deciding whether this particular ad should come to print. Kinney fails to realize that although he has the legal liberty to print such an ad, it was morally wrong for him to do so. I hope such a hateful and anti-Semitic ad could never serve our community, regard­less of the ad's historical accu­racy. . 
Major newspapers such as The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune are faced with the choice of printing hateful advertisements everyday. The editors of such papers decide whether certain ads have the privilege (not right) to appear in their paper on the basis of

Search is over through the help of the Muze 
By THOMAS KANE 
Accent Writer 
You go into the first record store and ask the clerk if they have the new album out by "Madder Rose." The puzzled clerk in his 20s wonders if this is some offshoot formed from a disgruntled member of the heavy metal group "Guns & Roses"-the ones who wrote the hit song about going home to Panama City ? "No." you reply, '"Madder Rose' is a pro­gressive group from the 90s. Everyone knows that." 
However. Muze, a musical database available at 100 loca­tions nationwide including the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, is making it easier for audiophiles to become unit­ed with the music of their choice, replacing what Rolling Stone Magazine terms "the dicey prospect of human inter­action." 
"The average manager in a Musicland chain is 24. No mat­ter how much of a music lover they are, its literally impossible for someone like that to have a full knowledge of rock his­tory ... There's so much coming out-how can they keep track?," said Frank Zullow. founder of the Muze, Inc. sys­tem. 
"The main thing that Muze does is identify the product when you only have one piece of information," Zullow said. All that is needed to enter the data base -which contains 80,000 items spanning every­thing from Wagner to Van Halen-is a key word in the title, the name of the group, or another pertinent clue. Once inside the base, you are provid­ed with everything you ever wanted to know about the group and more. 

In calling up an album on the ATM-like machine, a customer will see song titles, record com­pany information, length, spars codes, guest artist, producer, release date, sound quality in­formation and the opinion of magazines such as Rolling Stone, Downbeat and Q. If this doesn't seem enough, how about a full color image of the album cover right their on the screen! 
"T~e more the customer knows, the more he will buy," according Zullo, who founded the system with the help of Trev Huxley, grandson of visionary author Aldous Huxley. The system was an outgrowth of Digital Radio Network, a telephone service founded in 1986 to inform callers if an album is out on CD yet. 
If inquiring about a song enti­tled "Territorial Pissings" makes you a little squeamish, Muze is the machine for you. "People will ask a machine questions they may not ask a person," according to Zullo. "Muze is very user friendly...people are apprehen­sive [to ask for help] or to feel like an idiot. Muze is the tool for them to use," said Tim Faith, music buyer. 
Muze is not only user friend­ly, it is owner friendly. Every 'lost' album that is found by Muze means more profit for store owners. Muze can give the sales pitch that even the most knowledgeable clerk might miss. This is the hope of store owners who invest in this expensive system. 
While this service was provid­ed to the Notre Dame bookstore free by the music supplier, other record outlets must pay as much as $6000 for the machine, as well as $150 a month for updates to the data­base. However, for the cus­tomer. the service is free. 
Across the nation, the re­sponse of store owners who have implemented the system has been positive. Some retail­ers, such as Tower Records' of New York manager Steve Harmon would like more machines. "People are on them almost constantly. We wish we had more of them," Harmon said. 
Similar positive results have been obtained in Ann Arbor's Tower Records, the only Michigan store to utilize a Muze Machine. "It's gone over very well ... People use it constantly. It's a great tool," said manager Tom Rule. 
Other chains that have start­ed using Muze in some capacity include Musicland/Sam Goody, Ware-house, and Camelot Music. 
Muze has also won success locally-right here at Notre Dame. 
"There has been a good reac­tion of students to the system...lt has helped in library stock-in blues and classical areas," according to a book­store employee. 
One student who is pleased with the system is Joe Russo. a senior English and Pre-med major. " I was looking for music by Chris Cavanaugh ... and tried three stores [before locat­ing it on the Muze system at Notre Dame]," said Russo. 
"The machine printed out a receipt with important informa­tion such as the order name and phone number," said Russo, who plays keyboard in his spare time for the local group XYZ Affair." Anyone who knows [the obscurity on Chris Cavanaugh knows that it is a real test of the system," said Russo. 
Reily Collection displays a glimpse 
of the 18th-Century 
By LYNN BAUWENS 
Accent Writer 
Not every museum can boast of an extensive collection of works on paper from one of the most fascinating and diverse eras in the history of art. Through the support of bene­factors including John D. Reilly, class of 1963, and over a decade of development, the Snite Museum of Art has brag­ging rights to an exhibition of some 40 European drawings from the 18th century. 
The current exhibition spans the Baroque. Rococo, and the age of Neo-classicism and fea­tures works by sQme of the great masters from Italy, France and Great Britain and other lesser known artists. 
"At least one-fourth of the show has never been on view, and the majority of the draw­ings are from the John D. Heilly collection," according to Mary Frisk Coffman. assistant to the chief curator. 
While works on paper are sel­dom one of the central locations in galleries, the Snite has main­tained a dedication to acquire high quality pieces that provide a deeper understanding of the diverse aspects of the 18th-cen­tury artistic periods. These

The exhibit will be open until Sunday, January 9, 1994, and is located in the Snite's Print Gallery on the second floor. Admission to the Snite is free and open to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays 10:00 a.m.-4:00p.m., Thursday until 8:00 p.m., when classes are in session and Sundays from 1:00 p.m.-4:00 p.m. 
works include a range of preparatory studies as well as highly detailed drawings meant to be seen as finished works of art in themselves. 
Drawings and prints repre­sent some of the world's most important works of art. They reveal both the technical skill and imagination of the draftsc man while providing insight into the artist's inspiration. 
While not all by pre-eminent masters such as Van Gogh or Picasso, the works currently on exhibit are high quality draw­ings. Included in this showing are works by Greuze, Fragonard, Boucher, Watteau, Gandolfi, Tiepolo, and Romney. They show a glimpse of the per­manent 18th-century Reilly Collection. 
Robert R. Coleman, Assistant Professor, Department of Art, Art History and Design, will be presenting a Noon Talk on the 18th-Century European Drawings on Tuesday. November 30, in the gallery.

Take care as 
cold season 
approaches 
by Ryan J. Grabow N.R.E.M.T. 
Now that the cold weather has come to South Bend, most of us will be spending much more time indoors. Due to the close confines, lack of good ventilation. and dry air in our dorms, we are all facing a greater risk of catching that most common of ailments: The Cold. 
As with most viruses the pri· mary entry sites for the cold virus are the nose and eyes. In addition to direct contact with the cold virus, through breath­ing in water droplets expelled through the sneeze of a cold suffer, it is also very common for one to catch a cold from simply touching a door knob or other object contaminated with the virus and then rub­bing one's eyes or nose. Contrary to popular belief you cannot catch a cold from sit­ting in a draft, walking around with wet hair in cold weather, or being improperly dressed for the cold. Without being exposed to the virus you can­not catch a cold. 
Once a person is infected with the cold virus she may begin to experience a variety of symptoms one to four days after being infected. In addi­tion to sneezing, the presence of the cold virus causes the immune system to release inflammatory chemicals called kinins which cause increased blood flow to the nasal pas­sages. The results of this increased blood flow are a runny nose (due to increased mucous production), conges­tion (due to swelling of the nasal blood vessels), and pos­sibly a sinus headache (due to increased pressure in the sinus cavities). A mild sore throat is also usually experi­enced due to irritation of the throat lining caused by exces­sive mucous drainage into the throat. 
Since the cold is caused by a virus, antibiotics have no effect at an· on the viruses that cause a cold. Bed rest, hot liq­uids, vaporizers, antihista­mines, decongestants, and aspirin have no effect on the duration of a cold; however, they may help to relieve some of the symptoms while the cold runs its course. 
The common cold is not a very dangerous virus in and of itself. A cold will usually last 7-10 days from the onset of first symptoms to the relief of all nasal congestion. The real danger in having a cold is that it can expose one to more seri­ous infections. Since the immune system is weakened while fighting a cold, a person is more susceptible to many "secondary infections." Jf in the course of lighting a cold, you experience a fever, extreme fatigue, ear ache, or mucous-laden cough (sec­ondary infection symptoms) see a doctor immediately.

Lack of ticket sales reflects bad times for L.A. 
-
By BETH HARRIS Associated Press 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. Times have changed for the Los Angeles Lakers, once the super­star team in a town resplendent with stars. 
They're losers, and in L.A., losers don't sell. 
One of the toughest tickets in town when Magic Johnson was conducting "Showtime," and GQ cover boy Pat Riley was pacing the sidelines during the NBA championship seasons of the 1980s, Laker seats are easy to come by these days. Fans can walk up to the ticket win­dow before most games. 
The star quality that once drew sellout crowds of 17,505 to the Forum is gone. 
"Magic isn't here anymore," fan Carolann Jenkins said. "It's a real different team." 
Jenkins and other fans are left checking their programs for unfamiliar names: Elden Campbell, Doug Christie, Vlade Divac, Anthony Peeler and Nick Van Exel comprise the NBA's youngest starting lineup, with an average age of 23.4 years. 
A first name used to be enough to identify the Lakers' lineup. Magic, Kareem Abdul­Jabbar, A.C. Green, James Worthy, Michael Cooper, Byron Scott and Kurt Rambis helped make the Forum the in-spot night after night. 
At 32, Worthy is the lone re­maining link to those heady days. Last year's 39-43 record was the team's first losing sea­son in 17 years, and the Lakers opened this season 3-7. 
Before a game against the Chicago Bulls last weekend, Mike Ellis, 36, ticked off some of the reasons the Lakers have lost their lustre. 
"Kareem's gone, Worthy's aging, Magic's gone, Riley's gone," he said. "When you say the magic's gone, that encom­passes the man and the team." The Lakers' average home at­tendance-12,976 in their first six dates -was the fourth-low­est in the NBA. Across town, 

rassed about his waning inter­est in the Lakers. He owns sea­son tickets to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and goes to several Raiders NFL games. 
"I'd like to be a true Laker fan," he said, "(but) I've gone to twice as many Clippers games because Magic's left." 
Actually, Johnson is at most of the games. But the only ball he touched on a recent night was one that landed at his seat adjacent to the Laker bench. 
During the Lakers' run of five NBA championships in the 1980s, Riley was as popular as his players. Pfund shares Ri­ley's fondness for stylish suits and slicked-back hair, but fans know the difference. 
"Randy Pfund doesn't have the crowd appeal that a Pat Ri­ley did," Ellis said. 
Pfund was elevated from as­sistant to coach in May 1992. Later that year, Johnson retired and the team has yet to find a dominant replacement. 
"I don't think there's any doubt that we're a little differ­ent team than we were in the '80s in terms of marquee-type players," Pfund said. 
Season ticket sales are down about 1,500 from last season, to 10,000. That's about the same as in 1985-86, when the Lakers drew an average 16,826. 
Pfund said other Los Angeles pro teams experience the same type of varying fan interest. 
"I went to a Dodger game this summer. I could have picked about one of 30,000 seats," he said. "I don't think it's a Laker problem. I think economy can get involved in it, too." 
But the Forum's other tenant is doing big business. The Kings hockey team has sold out 81 of its last 91 games dating back to the beginning of the 1991-92 season. 
Reaching the Stanley Cup final last season, the presence of superstar Wayne Gretzky and hockey's newfound popularity in Southern California help draw capacity crowds. 
AP tile photo With the loss of superstars such as Magic and Jordan, some profes­sional basketball teams have seen ticket sales decline. 
Police suspect over-selling 
the Clippers were third-lowest at 11,199, while Philadelphia was drawing 11,155 and Atlanta 9,491. 
''I'm used to it," Lakers coach Randy Pfund said. "It's been that way here for the last three years." 
If the trend continues, the Lakers could finish with their worst attendance since 1978­79, when they averaged 11,771. From 1988-92, they averaged more than 17,000. 
Ticket prices range from $2 to $100. 
Last week, several fans at­tended on tickets they received from friends employers. 
"Even when we get offered tickets. we're not as inter­ested," Ray Jenkins said. 
Los Angeles has a national reputation for fans arriving late and leaving early. Against the Bulls, at least 25 courtside seats remained empty 10 min­utes into the game. Plenty of seats in the Forum's upper reaches were bare that long, too. 
"Los Angeles fans are less patient than other fans," said Bill, a 4 7 -year-old movie direc­tor who declined to give his last name. "Maybe because there are so many distractions here. In most NBA cities, there aren't quite as many choices." 
So far this season, there have been no advance sellouts. The lone capacity crowd opening night; the second-best crowd was 15,512 against the Bulls. 
While the on-court stars are gone, the Lakers still draw some of Hollywood's biggest names to the courtside seats. 
Jack Nicholson can eavesdrop on opponents from his location, while Dyan Cannon is two seats away from Johnson on the south end of the court. 
Garry Shandling, Louis Gos­sett Jr., Chevy Chase, Anthony Kiedis and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mike Piazza of the Dodgers pop in some­times. 
Ellis, the fan from Orange County, said he felt embar-

University of Wisconsin police are investigating whether the school sold too many tickets to a football game at which dozens were injured when stu­dents surged on the field. 
Thousands ran from the Camp Randall Stadium stands after Wisconsin beat Michigan on Oct. 30, trampling dozens underfoot. At least 69 people were injured, seven critically. 
Documents showed police received two telephone calls from informants who referred to overselling of tickets. The calls were received at the secu­rity command center set up at the game. 
"Regardless of the in­formants, we would be doing something to determine whether there was an over­
selling of tickets," Lt. Gary Johnson said Monday. 
Johnson said one detective and two auditors were looking into ticket sales for the game. 
Tim Van Alstine, ticket sales director for the university, said: "I don't think there is any con­cern of overselling." 
Athletic department officials said earlier an internal audit found the school didn't sell too many tickets. 
Documents showed police seized 14,404 paper tickets from the school's ticket office Nov. 5, the day before the game against Ohio State. Police also seized 2,383 unsold student season passes from the ticket office. 
Police said the seizure was not related to the investigation. 
The paper tickets were to be exchanged on game day for student passes.

John Rushin and the Irish take on Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, and Alaska-fairbanks in Face-Off. 
Notre Dame out to prove worth in CCHA 
By TIM SHERMAN 
SportS Writer 
Coach Hie Schafer, you and your Irish hockey team just defeated the nation's third­ranked team on the road for one of Notre Dame's biggest hockey victories. What are you going to do now? 
No, the answer is not "I'm go­ing to Disney World." 
The team must now endure a 14-hour plane trip to Alaska and face those same Lakers from Lake Superior State, as well as eleventh-ranked Michi­gan Tech and Alaska-Fairbanks in the Great Alaska Face-Off. 
The tourney should provide the team with the opportunity to legitimize their claim that they are a team to be watched in the CCIIA. 
"Now we're getting used to it (CCIIA)." said freshman Tim Harberts, who has scored a couple of key goals in the past two weekends. "We're earning some respect in the league, as well as conlidence." 
"They should believe in them­selves," agreed Schafer. "We can be a very good team." 
Heading into Alaska, the team carries a 4-4-1 record, including a 3-4-1 mark in con­ference play. That record is good enough for fifth place. The Irish definitely want to maintain, if not improve that standing, as one of their goals is to gain home-ice advantage in the first-round of the CCfiA playoffs (first five teams). 
In order to do so, Notre Dame must continue to play with the same intensity and confidence that they displayed against LSSU on Friday, especially on offense. That performance was definitely encouraging, as the Irish scored more goals against

a strong Laker squad than against any one else. In addi­tion, the scoring was balanced, as seven different skaters tal­lied points. 
The production of sophomore Jamie Ling has been consistent all year long. Now, the task is to get solid efforts from mo.re people on a regular basis. The potential is there, especially with the likes of Harberts, Jamie Morshead, and Ben Nelsen. 
While the offense showed signs of improvement, the de­fense slacked somewhat. In the two games, the Irish allowed as many goals as they had in the previous for games. However, Schafer is confident that Matt Osiecki and the others will regain their stingy ways and continue to give Notre Dame consistent chances to win games. 
The Irish start the tourney on Thursday night against Michi­gan Tech. The Huskies, who are among the the top teams in the WCHA, are deep. Six dif­ferent players have notched at least eight points. 
"They're bug and strong," observed Schafer. "In addition, they have a premier goalie in Jamie Ram (.917 GAA)." 
On Friday night, Notre Dame continues against Alaska-Fair­banks, a program Schafer started ten years ago. The Nanooks (that's right, Nanooks) also boast an abundance of of­fensive talent. Winger Jason Eckel leads his team with 21 points, while center Dean Fe­dorchuk has found the back of the net 14 times. 
However, UAF is suspect de­fensively. They have allowed over six goals per game this season. The Irish offense should be able to post some big numbers. 
Notre Dame saves the best for last, as on Saturday night they again face Lake Superior State to conclude the trio of games. Obviously, the Irish have the ability to defeat the Lakers, but it will take another determined and focused effort. Lake State has the potential to get on a roll, especially given the chance to fine-tune their game with two consecutive games. 
The Irish should be ready for them. Schafer is planning on taking four extra skaters on the trip. He also intends to play goalies Brent Lothrop and Wade Salzman, as well as num­ber one netminder Greg Louder. 
"Our task now is to take it (our level of play) a step fur­ther," said an optimistic Schafer.

Aikman returns; Smith out with bruised thigh 
By DENNE H. FREEMAN 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas 
Troy Aikman's back in the Dallas Cowboys starting lineup but Emmitt Smith apparently is out. 
Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson gave Aikman the green light to start Thanksgiving Day against the Miami Dolphins, saying "we'll give Troy all the snaps this week and start him on Thursday. It's still to be de­termined how limited he will be." 
Aikman missed the last two weeks with a pulled hamstring. 
Smith could barely walk let alone run at Valley Ranch on Monday. 
"The flexibility is not there," said Smith of his severely bruised right thigh. "But I don't have the pain I did yesterday." Smith's thigh was heavily bandaged after he received ice treatments for the blood which had filled the damaged muscle. 
Smith was injured in Sunday's 27-14 loss to the Atlanta Falcons and Johnson said "Emmitt is doubtful. He won't practice this week. I've got hope but I truly don't expect him to play. After what I saw this morning I wouldn't expect him to play." 
Johnson said Derrick Lassie and Lincoln Coleman will get all the snaps in practice this week although Johnson added "I won't rule Emmitt out until a few minutes before kickoff. He's one of those players who don't have to practice to play." Aikman said his pulled ham­string was still "a little tender." 
But he added ''I'm confident I can go without worrying about it tearing or anything. I'm not confident I can take off in a scramble and outrun people. I have to be smart about it. 
"Of course, for me to say I'm not going to scramble is easy to say. I just hope I have it in mind not to do it during the game." 
Aikman said he believes the hamstring which pulled in the third quarter of a 31-9 victory over the New York Giants is related to his back problems. He underwent surgery in June to repair a herniated disc. 
"I think it has something to do with the back and I'm going to have the back checked out," Aikman said. 
Bernie Kosar and Jason Gar­rett have quarterbacked the Cowboys in Aikman's absence. 
"It's been frustrating just sit­ting around," Aikman said. ''I'm anxious to get back out there. This is what you work hard all year for, to play in the games." 
Johnson said the Cowboys were totally flat against the Falcons. 
"We've struggled lately be­cause of injuries and because we had the attitude that as­sumed we were going to win," Johnson said. "When you have success you have a natural ten­dency to pull back and let things slide. We won seven in a row and that attitude crept in." 
Johnson added "when you have no Troy and no Emmitt you can become average in a hurry." 
Johnson was so irritated by the loss he didn't watch Sunday night's game like he usually does.

Irish win conference championship 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Coming off one of the most successful weekends in pro­gram history, the No. 16 Notre Dame volleyball team faced the cruel realities of NCAA logic, dropping to No. 3 in the Mideast region despite handily sweeping the Midwestern Col­legiate Conference tournament and running their current win­ning streak to eight matches, seven of which were 3-0 victo­ries. 
The Irish pounded Xavier 15­8, 15-9, 15-6 in the quarterfi­nals and knocked off a tena­cious Butler squad 15-12, 15­12, 15-13 for their third con­secutive championship, earning an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. 
Notre Dame (25-5) also com­pleted a sweep of the confer­ence awards presented before the tournament, as junior Christy Peters was named MCC player of the year, freshman Jenny Birkner Newcomer of the year, and coach Debbie Brown MCC coach of the year. 
In addition to these major awards, Peters led three Irish players on the MCC first team, joined by seniors Molly Stark and Janelle Karlan, while se­nior Julie Harris was a second team selection. Freshman Kristina Ervin joined Birkner on the all-Newcomer team. 
To cap off the weekend, Pe­ters was selected as the MVP of the conference tournament, while junior Nicole Coates was also named to the team. 
Following this unprecedented success, the Irish were shocked to hear that they had dropped in the regional polls, which may jeapordize their NCAA tourna­ment seeding and opportunity to host a home match. 

This unprecedented drop makes Notre Dame's perfor­mance in next weekend's Banker's Classic in Stockton, Ca. all the more crucial, as the Irish will face No. 11 Pacific and either No. 1 UCLA or No. 4 BYU. A strong showing against these top ranked squads could vault the team back into a high­er regional standing. 
The controversy in the re­gional poll overshadowed the Irish dominance of the MCC tournament. Notre Dame was clearly the favorite going in, but key injuries looked to disrupt the Irish lineup. Notre Dame was without two members in its starting rotation, as Harris was sidelined with a broken finger and sophomore defensive spe­cialist Brett Hensel turned her ankle the day before the tour­nament, missing her first game since coming to Notre Dame. 
However, as has been the case all year for the Irish, re­serve players stepped in with no letdown in efficiency. In this case, freshmen Laura Reck­meyer and Jen Briggs replaced Harris and Hensel with solid, error-free play. 
With the two freshmen com­
plimenting the lineup, the Irish 
received their seemingly stan­
dard great performances from 
the upperclassmen. Peters es­
pecially was dominant through­
out the tournament, as her 17 
kills and 12 digs against Xavier 
solidified her claim as the best 
player in the conference. 
''I'm very honored by the 
award, but the major contribut­
ing factor is that the team is 
doing so well," noted Peters, who has been MVP of all but one tournament the Irish have participated in all season. "I have to attribute my success to that." 
"It's great all the individuals get honors, but no individual 
· gets any awards without great team support," added Brown, who has been named coach of the year each of her three sea­sons in the league. The Irish proved in the cham­pionship match that they were indeed deserving of the awards, as the team held off a deter­mined Butler squad to win for the third time in as many years. Again Peters was the domi­nant force, hitting a match-high 20 kills to go along with 14 digs. Notre Dame also got pro­duction from its other outside hitter, as Coates balanced the attack with nine kills and three service aces. However, the Irish were un­able to shake the Bulldogs, who stayed close throughout. Butler was led by all-tournament per­formers Stephanie Wesley and Laura Haire, who each had double figure kills. "Butler played very tough. They served very aggressively, which made it difficult for us of­fensively," praised Schlick. Notre Dame rallied from a 9­7 deficit in the first game thanks to a 7-1 run ignited by Peters and Stark. The Irish then withstood a Bulldog rally that closed the score to 13-12 in game two before kills by Birkner and Stark ended the game. The final game again saw Notre Dame use a 7-1 run to turn a 12-7 deficit into a lead behind the serving of Coates. Fittingly, Stark, who many saw

as another potential candidate for tournament MVP based on her double digit kill perfor­mances in both games, scored the final side out, followed by Peters championship-clinching final kill. 
"We're very pleased to win the conference championship for a third year in a row," an­nounced Schlick. 
The Irish will have little time to bask in the glow of victory, since the upcoming Banker's Classic has now become crucial in terms of their potential tour­nament success. An Irish upset would solidify Notre Dame's bid for hosting one of the NCAA games. 
Notre Dame hegins with the unenviable task of defeating No. 11 Pacific on its home floor. Pacific is 19-8 overall, 12-6 in the competitive Big West Con­ference. They are led by the tandem of Dominique Benton­Bozman (331 kills, .280 per­centage) and Charlotte Johans­son (348 kills, .347 percentage). 
Depending on their success, the Irish will face either No. 1 UCLA (26-1) or No. 4 BYU (25­
1). 
The Irish will find out their region and seeding for the NCAA tournament Sunday evening November 28.

Freshmen looked upon to play key roles 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Heturning all but one player from last season's 9-18 squad, the Notre Dame men's basket­ball team is looking for im­provement in many areas. 
However. as the season be­gins, one of the most promising contributions looks to be made by newcomers, as the four freshmen who will suit up for the Irish hope to bolster the depth and talent of the team. 
One of the strengths Irish coach .John MacLeod brought to the Irish basketabll program was his a hili ty to sign top­ranked reeruits. 
This season's recruits, center Matt Gotsch, center-forward Marcus Hughes, and point guard Admore White all come to Notre Dame with the hopes of returning the program to national prominance. 
Joined by walk-on Pete Miller, this group should have an immediate impact on the fortunes of the '93-'94 squad. 
"We will play the freshmen until they start to play like freshmen," stated MacLeod. "We want them to play a key role on this team, but we won't play them if they are obviously having a bad night, because we have experience ofT the bench." 
Playing time has already come to this young corps, as White and Hughes have both earned spots in the starting lineup. 
White enters the season with most of the pressure on the freshmen squarely on his shoul­

ders. Coming out of high school, White averaged 22 points per game to go along with 11 assists and three steals. Combining extraordinary physi­cal skills with a solid knowledge of the game, he has taken over the floor leadership of the team despite his inexperience. 
"Admore is very consistent and intelligent," said MacLeod. "lie wants to learn, but is still making freshmen mistakes. It's a lot to ask of him to step in and run the team." 
White was unfazed. "I was expecting to be eased in, but if I stick to the fundamentals I

should be okay," he noted. "My goal is to play hard and listen to coach MacLeod." 
Hoping to solidify a frontcourt that is weak in rebounding and offensive production, MacLeod has looked to Hughes as an answer and the freshman from Detroit has responded well. 
Averaging 12 points and 9.5 rebounds per game in high school on a state championship squad, Hughes also provides solid defense and shot-blocking capacities, making the lane a more dangerous place for Irish opponents than it has been in recent years.

from that kind of attention and just stayed to myself." 
The fact is that his heart-hidden behind a sleek, sculpted physique-is imperfect. 
A rare thickening of the walls called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) forced him to miss two seasons. 
There were tears and prayers. Prayers that were answered when doc­tors discovered that his condition was not serious enough to keep him from playing. 
Not that it kept him off the court before he got the doctors' approval. Williams spent his afternoons in the sweaty gym at the Hockne Memorial, running with the runts. 
But it wasn't the same game that sus­tained him. It was too easy. He craved the competition that he couldn't find on that creaky old hardwood. 
For two years he went through the motions, scoring at will and dazzling everyone who peeked through the gym

doors. 
Those were difficult years for Williams, but he learned some valuable lessons that will make it easier for him when he has to walk away from the bas­ketball court forever. 
"It will be easier (to walk away from basketball) now, because I learned to put basketball in perspective," he said. "I can't let basketball use me. I have to use basketball to propel me to more important things in life. 
"I've learned to enjoy the finer things-spending time with my family, washing my truck-all the things people take for granted." 
Now he wants people to take him for granted. He doesn't want to be the American Heart Association poster child. He just wants to play basketball. 
"Hopefully, people will see me now as a basketball player and not just some kid who came back after missing two seasons," Williams said. "I am in good health.'' 
Good enough to spend the summer traveling to South America and Europe with the USA Basketball Under-22 Na­tional Team. 
Williams played in all eight champi­
"I think all the pressure is on Monty (Williams), and it's a plus if the freshmen are able to contribute," Hughes noted. "My goal is to take some of the pressure off of him in the post, to help rebound, and to be there if he has to dish it out of the double team." 
Hughes should receive some help in relieving Monty from classmate Gotsch, who was the Texas 4-A player of the year af­ter averaging 25.1 points, 14 rebounds, and nine blocked shots as a senior. .Gotsch has good mobility and range for a big man, but needs to add weight in order to withstand the punishment of big time col­lege basketball. 
"The coaches are looking for me to come in and get good quality minutes off the bench, but along the way I'm looking for more than that," he stated. ''I'm willing to accept whatever role is given to me. The team is real optomistic, and I think we're moving along at a good pace. We've improved a lot from the beginning of practice." 
The freshmen class is round­ed out by walk-on Pete Miller, a local product from St. Joseph's High who averaged 14 points per game last year. Although not counted on to contribute at the beginning of practice, Miller has been impressive with his work ethic and hard nosed defense that should earn him a spot in the rotation. 
''I'm playing as hard as I can, especially in practice," he com­mented. "My goal is to make the team better."

"Playing against the competition I faced this summer, my confidence is real high,". he said. "I also gained 10 pounds, and I'm feeling quicker and stronger.': 
Ten pounds heavier, but a little lighter around the shoulders, where the Notre Dame basketball team used to rest. 
Williams will be the focus of Notre Dame's offense again this season, but with freshman Admore White growing into his point guard position and class­mate Marcus Hughes becoming a force in the middle, stopping Williams won't be enough to stop the Irish. 
He scored 18.5 points and grabbed nearly 10 rebounds per game a year ago, and also led the team in volatile speeches. urging his teammates not to be satislied with losing. 
"Monty Williams is the reason we are a team and not just a group of individu­als," junior guard Jason Williams said. "For all of his individual accolades, he is a team player first and foremost."

By JASON KELLY 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame men's bas­ketball team geL'> its linal trial run tonight at 7:30 at the .IACC against Athletes in Action. 
After a lackluster 85-78 win over Samara Hussia last week, the Irish are searching for solutions to their turnovers and poor shooting. 
"We have to minimi;r.e our turnovers and shoot a high (percentage) if we hope to reach the goal that we set for ourselves-to make the NCAA tournament," Irish coach John MacLeod said. "We didn't play well offensively against the Russians and we played into the hands of a team that really wasn't very good defensively." 
Notre Dame faces a more formidable opponent tonight. 
Athletes in Action is current­ly 7-5 on its collegiate tour, with close losses to Florida State, Ohio State, Kentucky and Louisville. 
They are a team made up primarily of former CBA and college players. 
Notre Dame will have to im­prove on its 15 turnovers and 39 percent shooting perfor­mance against Samara if it hopes to be successful against tonight's talented opponent. 
Point guard Admore White will miss the game for personal reasons and guard Jason Williams will sit out with a bruised thigh. 
That will force senior Brooks Boyer to start at point guard and sophomore Ryan Hoover will have to carry most of the load at shooting guard. 
"We have to put a premium on the amount of mistakes we make," MacLeod said. "We have to understand the concept of team play and adhere to it." 
The regular season opens Sunday against Valparaiso. 
"They came in last year and shot the living daylights out o us," MacLeod said of' the Cru­saders. "They have some big­time scorers." 
Dave Hodmon and Casey Schmidt are their main threats from three-point range and Notre Dame's defense will have to exploit Valpo's lack of size. 
"They aren't as big as we are, but that means they're quicker," MacLeod said. "Our people will have to handle their quickness." 
after this season, but he doesn't expect to use it. Instead, he wants to see Notre Dame basketball return to its competi­tive past this season. 
An experienced, although marginally talented, senior class that includes twins Jon and Joe Ross, Brooks Boyer and Carl Cozen will provide the leadership necessary for the Irish to succeed. 
And a blend of younger players like sophomore shooting guards Hyan Hoover and Keith Kurowski can add some scoring punch oiT the bench. 
With more depth and probably more talent than they've had in at least two years, the biggest problem for the Irish this season is getting everyone to under­stand and accept their job. 
Williams will make sure that they do. 
''I'm seeing people, unlike last year, who want to accept their roles," he said. "The team concept is very important to us. A lot of people say we're a one man squad, but that is the farthest thing from the truth." 
That's good news for Monty Williams and the Irish. 
Someone with a heart condition shouldn't be carrying a basketball team on his shoulders.

-Women finish 15th in first ever NCAA championships 
By AMY GRIFFIN 
Spons Writor 
In their first appearance ever at the NCAA championships, the women's cross country stepped up and proved they eould run with the very best. 
The team finished 15th, with Sarah Hiley once again leading the Irish with a career-best time of 17:20.1 and a 33rd­plaee finish. 
Emily Hood, who finished right behind Hiley to place 34th, had the third best time for a freshman at 17:21.3. Junior Kristi Kramer ran a career-best time to finish 94th overall in 17:59.6, while junior Emily Husted recorded her second best time of the season at 
18:27.5 to place 134th. 
Also posting the fastest time of her career was junior Mau­reen Kelly, placing 137th with a time of 18:33.7. Carolyn Long finished a spot behind Kelly in 18:34.4 to earn the 24th best time for the freshmen and sophomore Amy Siegel had her third best time of the season to come in 178th place in 19:46.7. 
Going into their first champi­onship race, the Irish were ranked 17th. They didn't let their inexperienee show, as most of the team ran the best races of their lives. The team scored a total of 331 points to guide them to their 15th place finish. 
Villanova captured the women's title with a team total of 66 points. They had the two fastest runners, with Carole Sa­jac placing first with a time of 
16:40.3. Teammate Jennifer Rhines finished seeond overall in 16:44.4. 
Arkansas finished second and Georgetown took third with team totals of 71 points and 199 points, respectively.

Swimmers drop close meet to Ball State 
By KELLY CORNELl$ 
SportsWriter 
The men's and women's swim teams continued to struggle this weekend, with both teams los­ing to visiting Ball State University. The Irish women dropped a close meet, 153-147, while the men were outscored 137-106. 
Losses in the diving, breast­stroke, backstroke, and medley relay events, took away scoring opportunities for the men. The Cardinal swimmers also domi· nated the relays. 
Irish captain Dave Nathe won both the 50 and 100 free, and Ry Beville was also a double­winner, capturing first place in the 200 fly and the 200 free. Sophomore Dave Doherty also swam well, winning the 200 in­dividual medley in 1:59.56. 
"We haven't done that well in the dual meets so far, but we're confident about performing well in the championship meet in a few weeks," said sopho­more Brian Mulhern. "Our times are still improving, and with rest I know we can swim better." 
The Irish women faced many of the same obstacles to victory as the men. Ball State won both relay events, and Cardinal diver Kelly Price placed first in both diving boards. The Cardinals also compiled many points by placing first and second in the 100 fly, the 200 fly, and the 50 free. 
Sophomore Jesslyn Peterson continued to dominate in her individual races, winning the 100 free and the 400 individual medley. Freshman Erin Brooks excelled in the 200 back, finish· ing rll'st in a time of 2:08.32. 
Notre Dame breaststrokers Joy Michnowicz and Amy Bethem placed first and second respectively in the 200. 
Both the men and women will have a break until the National Catholic championship meet which will be held in early De­cember. Hopefully with rest the Irish can recover and get back on track for tbe remainder of the fall season.

Mike McWilliams finished 18th at Monday's NCAA Championships. 
By DYLAN BARMMER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team finished their sea­son yesterday by coming in fifth at the NCAA Cross Country Championships at Lehigh Uni­versity in Bethlehem, Pennsyl­vania. 
The 22-team meet was domi­nated by Arkansas, who ran away with their fifth straight NCAA title by finishing with an incredibly low score of 31 points. BYU was the Razor­back's closest competitor, fin­ishing a distant second by amassing a total of 153 points. 
Iowa State finished third with 156 points, Colorado came in fourth with a total of 1 7 2 points, and the Irish rounded out the top five with an even 200 points. 
Individually, the race was won by Washington State se­nior Josephat Kapkory, who finished with a time of 29:32.4. The Irish's best finisher was senior captain Mike McWilliams, who came in 18th with a time of 30:12.8 on the 10,000 meter course. 
This finish by the Irish cap­tain enabled him to become the first ever Notre Dame cross country runner to be named a four time All-American, helping him solidify a claim as one of the finest athlete's in Notre Dame's storied sports history. McWilliams, who improved on last year's 24th place time of 31:34.1, exceeded Troy Mal­oney's record of three All­America titles in 1940, '41, and '43. 
The Irish team also improved from last year, going from sixth to fifth place finishers, thn school's best finish since plac · ing third in 1990. 
Junior Nate Ruder finished second for the Irish and 50th overall with a career-best 10,000 meter time of 30:54.3. Sophomore Derek Seiling also had a career day, as he placed third for the Irish and 57tlt overall with a time of 31:00.0 Matt Althoff was the meet'~; fifth-best freshman, finishin~:
