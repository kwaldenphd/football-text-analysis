Playinga dangerous gamewas the tone ofacom­
mentary that appeared in yesterday's government-controlled Soviet press that criticized the new U.S. administration. The commentary, taken with press criticisms ofthe previous two days, appeared W sig­nal a substantially harsher Soviet stance toward the Republican ad­ministration. "The kid gloves are definitely off," observed one Western diplomat here. The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda said administration charges ofSoviet involvement in terrorism amount to "a campaign oflies and hypocrisy." The party daily also said 
U.S. policies are "dangerous to peace," and repeated an earlier Soviet charge that President Reagan has "deliberately distorted" Soviet foreign policy goals. Pravda said the administration's comments on terrorism may be part ofan "attempt to strike at processes ofinterna­tional detente, to justify the negative American stand toward limita­tion ofstrategic armaments and other measures aimed at relaxation of international tension." Soviet leaders refrained from any criticism of the new president or his advisers after Reagan's election in November, even though Reagan had been sharply critical of the Soviet Union during the presidential campaign and the Soviets had characterized him earlier as a "knight ofthe Cold War." -AP 
EightSaintMary'S studentsand a bartender were 
arrested in Corby's Tavern Friday eveningfor violations ofliquor laws. 
South Bend Police Special Operations officers entered the bar at 1026 
Corby Street and arrested the eight students for possession of an al­
coholic beverage by a minor. Corby's bartender Kurt Bottjer was 
charged with sale ofan alcoholic beverage to a minor. The nine were 
released on bail and are scheduled to appear in Circuit Court later this 
month. Arresting officers were quoted as saying the students did not 
present any identification upon entering the bar. Those students con­
tacted refused to comment. -Observer 
Punxsutawney Phil, the famous woodchuck from Gobbler's Knob, has been forecasting the length ofwinter for 94 years on evidence as thin as a shadow. "He's never been wrong," said Charles Erhard, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. "He's the Seer ofSeers, the one and only." Erhard, dressed in tails and a silk top hat, will rap on the door of a heated burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at dawn today and ask Phil for his prediction. The groundhog, according to tradition rooted in Pennsylvania Dutch legend and the Christian feast of Candlemas, will scurry back into the burrow and hibernate for six more weeks if he spots his shadow while peeping into the sunlight. That means, so the legend goes, six more weeks of winter weather. No shadow means an early spring. "A mortal man can readily miss the shadow, but Phil never misses it," said Erhard. "He'll 
whisper into my ear. He doesn't lie. He tells me the exact truth." The groundhog made his first official prediction in Punxsutawney, a town of about 10,000 people, in 1886. Last year, by Erhard's count, some 1500 spectators turned out on Groundhog Day. -AP 
InmateS are Still killing each other at the New 
Mexico State Penitentiary, one:,rear after 33 prisoners died in one of 
the most brutal uprisings in U.S. penal history. Millions have been 
spent to repair the prison, inv~tigate the riot, prepare prosecution 
and defense ofprisoners chargeO with riot crimes and pay for studies 
on how to improve the system. Yet prisoners say that except for a 
reduction in the population -from 1,1 56 at the time of the Feb. 2-3 
riot to the current 544 -little has been done to address the 
grievances that sparked the violence. These include harassment and 
brutality by guards, lack ofeducational or recreational opportunities, 
and poor quality food. And attacks by inmates on one another have not 
abated, either. On Sept. 18, George Saavedra was found in his cell 
stabbed to death. About a month later, Apolinar Paul Moraga was 
knifed to death in front of witnesses in a recreation yard. On Dec. 17, 
Theodore John Quintana was found dead in his cell from a cocaine 
overdose. His death is not being treated as murder. but Santa Fe Dis­
trict Attorney Eloy Matinez said his office is "not satisfied" that the 
overdose was voluntarily injected. Four days before Christmas, 
Ricardo Tafoya was found dead in his cell. Evidence indicated that he 
had been strangled, a prosecutor said. And on Jan. 24, the prison was 
locked down after stabbings and other disturbances had left one 
prisoner critically wounded. -AP 
SouthAfrica is gearingupfor what is expected to 
be its roughest national election in years. But there is virtually no 
doubt that the National Party, which has been in power for more than 
three decades, will win it. The tiny, fractionalized opposition has 
dubbed the April 29 balloting the "phony election" because the real 
contest will come before the votes are cast in the National Party 
caucuses that will nominate candidates for the House of Assembly's 
165 seats. The outcome ofthat intra-party fight between Prime Minis­
ter P.W. Botha's moderate wing and his ultra-rightist opponents will 
decide whether South Africa continues its cautious steps toward some 
sort of accommodation between the 4. S million whites and the 20 
million blacks or takes a sharp right turn. Though Botha has made 
clear he would never advocate a political system based on one man, 
one vote, he has been telling whites since he became prime minister 
Sept. 28, 1978, that they must ease the lot of the blacks or face a 
perilous future. But hardline Nationals, led by Andries P. Treurnicht, 
minister of state administration and statistics, wants no tampering 
with the rigid policies ofracial segregation imposed when the Nation­
al Party first took power in 1948. Most South African blacks view the 
upcoming election as irrelevant because they don't have the right to 
vote. They tend to see Botha's reforms as window-dressing for the 
outside world and say they won't be satisfied until the whole edifice of 
apartheid is dismantled. -AP·

On SMC student government 


Student elections are once again upon us. The Saint Mary's student body will go to the polls in a few weeks to elect their class and student governemt officers. Sig­nificantly, the elections are being held earlier this year. The present student government learned the hard way how difficult it is to pull together a Board and begin planning this year's activities right at the end of the academic year. As a result, they've pushed the elections up to give more time for a transition. According to Stu­dent Government President Kathleen Sweeney, the present officers will finish their ongoing semester ac­
tivities, so as not to overload the new officers with un­
finished business. The new government will take office 
on April 1, leaving most of Febuary and all of March for 
the transition. 
Unfortunately, the selection of student government officers is only as important as the students think it should be. Each year most of the candidates are very serious and earnest about wanting to contribute their know-how and skills to keep the student government functioning efficiently. Every year brings new people to the offices with their own ideas on how student govern­ment should be run. The present officers have strengthened the Board ofGovernance efficiently sion will be based on how well the Board of Gover­nance managed to govern without the assembly. Supposedly, the system of section reps, hall councils, and weekly Board meetings effectively replace the As­sembly as a a direct student voice. This, however, has yet to be proven. 
Kathleen believes the Board has been very effective this year, particularly in its ability to create a balance between its social and academic duties. The Board has proved itself to be as much concerned with student acedemic life as with providing entertainment. The foremost accomplishments in that area have been The Liberator, the noon-time luncheon speakers, and the Graduate Information Handbook (which should go into print this week). 
Kathleen feels the Board does much more than "just 

run organization through a sponsor programs. The stuff self-study and newly­we work on doesn't make created activities -in both headlines because Saint

position was by its nature a At yesterday's Board bureaucratic waste, han­meeting, the possibility of dling only the co-ex dining converting the old library 

hall tickets and the shuttle schedule. "We didn't think those limited duties warranted a commissioner," explained Kathleeen. "Those duties have just been picked up by the Student Activities office -which makes more sense. The position could be reinstated if we find there is a greater. need for it than to just handle 
the co-ex dining hall tickets." 
The Board has begun some work which probably will not be completed during this term. One of these is the idea for a position called a Technical Commissioner. "This would probably involve training six to ten stu­dents who would learn how to run all the technical equipment on this campus that student government is involved in," said Kathleen. "Then there would be a central board that everyone could use and then that knowledge could be passed on each year." 
Within the next week or two, a commission will 
finalize the fate of the Student Assembly -which has 
been in limbo since its suspension last spring. The deci­building into a student center was discussed and recommendations from the board will be presented to the Administration's commission which will decide the building's fate. Kathleen stressed the need for a student center as a single place for students to gather. 
The present board has been able to build upon the work ofpast Boards. There is always room for improve­ment, but that improvement will be left to the future Student Government officers elected in two weeks. It's an important consideration, that students should not take lightly when they decide who they want to lead them next year. We can't always accomplish everything that we would like to, but with the right people in place 
-people who will be dedicated to continuing the 
worR ofimproving both social and academic life -the 
Board will continue to function as a voice and an ef­
fective vehicle ofstudent opinions and needs.

There's constant turnover -deans, coaches, department chairmen. That's a very normal thing. And r put my leaving into a different category than some ofthe others. 
Q: What was your initial reac· tion to the hostage situation and, in particular, tha torture they under­went? 
A: I haven't seen much on the ac­tual torture, except for the psychological problems -being in solitary confinement, not being allowed out, not being allowed to exercise, having their shoes taken away, and things like this. Actually, it would be comparable to the kind of torture that prisoners underwent in the Korean War and in the Viet­namese War where many of them 
died, or even the kind oftorture that the secret police in Iran gave to the people that they captured. 
Q: 1 read something about a Res­
· burgh Letter that you sent to Congress. just what does itsay? 
A: I am presently preparing a final report for the President and Congress on the whole American policy on immigration and refugees. That will be available on March 1. The Hesburgh Letter is really the preface to my semi-annual report. This commission has been going on for 2 years, and every 6 months I make a report to the Congress, and I assume they're referring to the preface to the last report. 
Q: Do you look forward to Reagan's administration, and would you accept a role in it, if asked? 
A: I always look forward to a new administration, because I think that new people may bring new ideas. It could be good for the country ifthey bring the right ideas. If they bring the wrong ideas, it could be dis­astrous, but that's the risk you run with every new administration. As far as being a:;ked, I think I've served 40 or 50 days a year for the federal government during the time I've been president, beginning when I went on the National Science Board in 1954. I served on that for 12 years, 
and I served on the U.S. Commission on Human Rights for 15 years. I've served on about 10 other commis­sions. Now whether I'll be asked or 
...Hesburgh 
not by this administration, I just don't know. I've been open to service when I can do it, and it was in an area where I thought I could make a contribution as a priest or as 
one involved in education. 
Q: Were you pleased wtth the Council on jerusalem that was recently completed? 
A: I was very pleased. That was a good meeting, and we came out with a ~ood statement. It was called the Notre Dame statement. It will probably be carried in theNew York Times and Washington Post. It will certainly be carried in thejerusalem Post. 
Q: Do you think that Notre Dame has a drinking problem? 
A: I think every school in America has a drinking problem today. These youngsters are drinking in high school, and that's a very bad habit to bring to college. 
Q: Can the administration do anything to relieve the problem? 
A: I think we've got to be con­scious of it. We have a full-time per­son to counsel with people who have a problem. It's a destructive habit to have in one's life. I don't know any successful father or mot­her or businessman who is an al­coholic; it just ruins their life completely. It's bad to get into that habit early in life, because you're not going to be successful in school, nor in later life.

One of the largest crowds ever to 

attend an indoor track meet at Notre 
Dame cheered the Irish track squad 
to its first win of the season Friday 
night. 
"The amount of people there definitely helped us run better," said an exuberant head coachJoe Piane. 
The final tally for Friday's meet read Notre Dame 95; Bradley 77; University of Illinois-Chicago Circle 49; Loyala 29; Valparaiso 16. 
Piane's squad again ran strongly in all events, but the middle and long distance runners led the way. Senior star Chuck Aragon won the mile for the second meet in a row with a time of 4: 11. Carl Bicicchi and Andy Dil­lon also turned strong performances in the mile. 
Rick Rogers and Steve Dziabis dominated the half mile, finishing first and second, respectively. In what Piane called an "excellent" performan<:e,in,the 1000-yard run, Tim McCauley and Jim Moyar turned the same trick, with McCauley taking first place. 
Jacques Eady and Ron Hyde combined to give Notre Dame a third 1-2 finish in the 600 yard run with Eady winning. Eady also grabbed a second place finish in the high jump with a leap of6'8. 
Tim Novak turned in a very strong perfomance while finishing third in the the two-mile run. Dan Walsh was also able to nab a third place finish in the three-mile with a time of 14:52. 
Dave Bernards blew by Bradley 
star Ed Foreman and won the high 
hurdles in one of the more im· 
pressive perfomances of the night. 
Jim Christian helped the team cause 
by finishing third in the 300 yard 
run. 
Irish running back Greg Bell ran a 
6.5 .sixty-yard dash to lead Irish sprinters. 
In other field events John Kuzan finished third and Frank Riely fourth in the shot put. Steve Chronert finished second in the pole vault with a jump of 14 feet sixinches and Brian Mccauliffe skipped his way to third place finish in the triple jump. 
The mile relay team of Aragon, Eady, Dziabis, and anchorman Hyde tallied the sixth Irish first place finish with a time of 3:25. Hyde crossed the line a full eight seconds ahead ofthe second place team. 

The next meet for the Irish track squad is scheduled for Friday night at 6:30p.m. at the ACC. Notre Dame will take on the Fightin' Falcons of Bowling Green State University.

Irish rip Gamecocks 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
AssociateSports Editor 
After Saturday night's game with South Carolina, Digger Phelps reaf· firmed what he's been saying all year. "If Tripucka, Woolridge, and jackson play well we're a good team. But when Paxson plays well, it's an added bonus and we're that much better -it gives us four great players." 
John Paxson gave Phelps and his 
teammates one of his best perfor­
mances ofthe season Saturday night. 
Resting on the bench right before 
halftime, Phelps whisked the sop­
homore guard back on the floor with 
three seconds left to set up a final 
shot. 
The script couldn't have been written any better. Paxson sank a 19 foot jumper at the buzzer giving the Irish a 9 point halftime lead and the all-important momentum that carried them to a 94-84 victory over the Gamecocks. The win was Notre Dame's sixth straigh since losing to Marquette jan. I 0. 
"Yeah, I think that shot did a lot for us," said Paxson. "We hadn't played as well as we should have been up to that point, but it gave us a lift. Anytime you get to go out on a shot like that it's bound to do some­thing for the team." 
What it did was ignite the Irish of­fense, keeping their record at home unblemished this season, and giving Phelp's club a I 4-3 mark heading in­to tonight's clash with St. Mary's (Calif.). South Carolina drops to 12­8. 
"I like Notre Dame," Carolina coach Bill Foster taughed. "They're a good team. I hope that none of our players get pneumonia from the way they blew by us a couple oftimes." 
Paxson added Foster's team to his list of big-game heroics. The Dayton native, whose previous scoring sprees include 21 points at UCLA, 18 versus Indiana, and 22 in the win against San Francisco, shot a blister­ing 9-for 12 from the floor and finished the evening with 20 points. 
"John has to be a scoring threat for us," stated Phelps. "I think the last 

SC pummels Notre Dame with awesome offense

Mary DiStanistao, head coach of the Notre Dame women's basketball team, was, to put it mildly, slightly depressed Saturday afternoon. 
Her team had just been annih­
ilated by the 13th-ranked Lady 
Gamecocks of South Carolina by a 
score of 124-48. ­
Ouch. 
"They have an outsanding team," said DiStanislao."We just couldn't keep up with them physically." 
Size was obviously the main problem for the Irish in Saturday's contest. Ofeight team members, six 
of the lady Gamecocks are 5-10 or taller (including a 6-6 freshman). The size problem was most evident when Notre Dame's 5-1 playmaker, Maggie Lally, tried to run the offense while being guarded by 5-10 Evelyn Johnson (sister of NBA star Magic). "Maggie couldn't see over Evelyn," DiStanislao said. As a result, Lally had to sit out most of the game, and was never a factor. 
How could Notre Dame expect to defeat a team as awesome as the Lady Gamecocks? "We didn't expect to beat them,"said DiStanislao, "but I thought we would do a better job

two games he's been taking charge and scoring the way we'd like him to." 
"I really don't know why that's happened," answered Paxson when asked the reason his best scoring outputs come against Digger's "power" opponents. "I've just said all along that some games my shots would be there and some games they wouldn't. Lately, I've been lucky, and my shots have been going in." 
Kelly Tripucka paced Notre Dame's 62 percent shooting effort overall with 26 points of his own. Tracy Jackson pumped in 20 and grabbed a team high 9 rebounds, while Orlando Woolridge's 18 point show pushed him over the 1000­career mark. Although battling a touch of the flu, the Tree's perfor­mance brought the capacity crowd to its feet several times with his spectacular slams, including a behind-the-head dunk in the first 
half 
"I think our players were a bit in awe of Notre Dame," explained Fos­ter, who is trying to turn things 

around at Carolina, "but we tried our darndest. The last 40 seconds of the first half and the first four minutes ofthe second-that't when the game got away from us." 
Hot-handed guard Zam Fredrick poured in a game high 34 points for the visitors. That came on the heels of a 39 point effort last Wednesday against Hofstra. The 6-2 senior was ranked seventh among the nation's scoring leaders last week, but will probably move up a few notches. The fact that Fredrick had no assists Saturday night didn't bother his coach.

leers splitwith Minn.-Duluth 

By BRIAN BEGLANE

DULUTH, Minn -The Notre Dame hockey team was about as suc­cessful at narrowing the gap be­tween it and eligibility for the Western Collegiate Hockey Associa­tion playoffs this weekend as were car travelers attempting to climb hil­ly city streets here Saturday night af­ter a five-inch snowfall. 
Initially, the Irish made some headway with an 8-4 victory Friday night over Minnesota-Duluth. But the Bulldogs stopped Notre Dame Saturday with a 6-4 trimph and the Irish slid back down to five points out of eighth place, the last qualify­ing position for the playoffs. Four weeks remain ofthe regular season. 
The ninth place Irish take a 6-13-1 WCHA record ( 10-16-2 overall) in­to this week's showdown at Michigan, one of three teams five points ahead ofNotre Dame. Duluth, also five points ahead of the Irish (Colorado College is the third), is 9­11-0 in the league and 14-14-1 over­all. 
"Friday I thought we got a solid effort from everyone," said Irish Coach Lefty Smith. "We moved the puck well, especially on the power play, and didn't waste any oppor­tunities. And Dave laurion (Irish goalie) helped a lot. He had a good 
night." 
Laurion stopped 25 shots, but the game's hero was senior left wing Kevin Humphreys, who sparked the victory with his second career hat trick. junior Dave Poulin, Humphrey's center, contributed a goal and three assists Friday while right wing jeff Logan had a goal and an assist. 

For the weekend, that line produced I 5 points: Humphreys with four goals and two assists; Poulin with a goal and four assists; and Logan with three goals and an assist. 
"They came through with about as good a weekend as any line has for us all year," said Smith. 
Logan and Humphreys gave the Irish a 2-0 lead in the first six minutes Friday with goals at :24 and on the power play at 5:33. UMD's Dean Ekman made it 2·1 after one period with his first goal of the year at 10:38. 
Humphreys and Poulin then capitalzied on two straight power plays in the second period, at :36 and 8:50, for a 4-1 lead. Don Gerarden and Gary DeGrio pulled the Bull­dogs within one, 4-3, with two goals in a span of3:19. 
Senior defenseman Don Lucia 
scored what proved to be the game­
winner at 17:41 for a 5-3 lead after 
two periods. His 30-foot slapshot 
went in off the right pad of UMD 
goalie Ron Erickson, who was forced 
to play both nights with top net­
minder Bill Perk! out with a 
fractured skull. 

Kurt Bjork and Humphreys put 
the game out of reach early in the 
third period. Bjork scored his first of 
two goals for the weekend at 2:52 
and Humphreys collected his hat 
trick at 5: I 9. 

"I was just out doing what I always 
try to do," said Humphreys, who was 
born in Duluth and Jived here about 
a year. "I don't know what it was. I guess it was sort ofa lucky streak." Rex Bellomy added salt to the wound with a shorthanded goal at 
14:50 and UMD's beGrio dosed the scoring on a power play at 16:42. It was Notre Dame's seventh straight win over the Bulldogs at the Duluth Arena. It also broke a five-game win­less streak for the Irish_ 
Duluth's Scott Carlst-m and DeGrio helped snap that streak Saturday. Carlston collected a hat trick and DeGrio added two con­secutive third period goals for the victory. Four of the Bulldog goals came on the power play. 
Three Irish defensemen were skating while hurt Saturday. Jim Brown, Lucia andjeffBrownschidle, who had five assists in the series, played despite being injured. 
"We were hurt on defense," said Smith, "and we had a hard time regrouping five-on-five with so 
many  penalites."  The  Irish  were  
whistled for 13 infractions.  
Notre  Dame  had  fought  back  

twice from two-goal deficits and Humphreys' fourth goal ofthe series at 6:39 of the third period made the score 4-3 in favor. of UMD. But DeGrio capped a four-goal weekend with two in a row, at 12:44 and 
14:11, to cushion the Bulldogs' ad­vantage to 6-3. 
Logan got his second goal of the game at I 4:44 to make the score 6-4. Laurion, who totaled 33 saves, was pulled with a minute to go but Notre Dame could not score. Erickson made 29 saves.
