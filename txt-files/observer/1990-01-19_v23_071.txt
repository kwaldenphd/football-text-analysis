Defendants acquitted of child molestation in landmark trial 
LOS ANGELES (AP) Preschool operators Raymond Buckey and. his mother were acquitted Thursday of 52 child molestation charges in the na­tion's longest and. costliest criminal trial, inciting outrage among parents of youngsters in the case. 
Jurors deadlocked on 12 sex abuse counts against Buckey and a single conspiracy count against him and his 63-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey. Superior Court Judge William Pounders declared a mistrial on those counts and dismissed the deadlocked con­spiracy charge against Mrs. 
Buckey. He set a Jan. 31 hear­ing to determine whether the 13 unresolved counts will be dis­missed against Buckey. 
Announcement of the inno­cent verdicts brought gasps and sobs in the packed court­room. 
Buckey, 31, who spent nearly five years in jail because of the charges, and his mother, who was jailed for almost two years, cried as the verdicts were read. 
"I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything," Mrs. Buckey said outside court. "My concern was for my son and what they've done to him ... 
because my son would never harm a child.'' 
"I feel wonderful," said Charles Buckey, father of Ray­mond and husband of Mrs. Buckey. Raymond Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer. 
About an hour after the ver­dicts were announced, parent Jackie McGauley said: ''I'm still in shock.... When I first heard it, I didn't believe it. I thought someone had made a mistake." 
Parent Mary Mae Cioffi added: "I am really disap­pointed. The anger is beginning to rise. We have programs all 
Kurt's wish to play with ND band granted 
BY DEBBIE CHARLESWORTH accent writer  
Dreams really do true. Kurt Weiss, a school sophomore  come high from  

Pittsburgh, Pa., who has osteogenic sarcoma, bone cancer, received his wish to play with the Notre Dame marching band at the Orange Bowl from the Western Pennslyvania chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Kurt wished to play with the Notre Dame marching band with a new saxophone and to meet Monk Malloy. 
Kurt chose this wish for several reasons. His goal is to attend Notre Dame and play in the band after graduating from high school. Kurt knows Notre Dame well. His older sister, Gretchen, is a 1988 graduate and played the clarinet in the marching band.

that our justice system needs a revamp for kids." 
"I know my children were molested. I had my daughter sleep between my husband and I for a whole year because she was so afraid somebody would come and get her, that they would kill her, because she told," she said. 
The investigation of alleged mass molestation at the subur­ban McMartin Pre-School ig­nited a nationwide wave of worry about child abuse when it came to light in 1983. It pro­duced widespread fear among working parents that their children might be at risk at school. 
The trial lasted nearly three years and cost $15 million, making it the longest and most expensive criminal proceeding in U.S. history. 
"I was not surprised by the verdicts," the judge said at a news conference afterward. "I would not have been surprised at any decision the jury made.''

N D professor named Chile's finance minister 
By LIZ PANZICA 
Business Editor 
A professor of economics at Notre Dame, Alejandro Foxley, has been named finance minister in Chile's new civilian government. 
Foxley was selected for the position by Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin. Aylwin won the presidency in elections on December 14. His government is expected to be sworn in during mid-March. 
Foxley will be responsible for decisions concerning Chile's economy, as finance minister is the main economic position in the new Chilean government. 
According to Manuel Gar­reton, a senior fellow at the Institute For International Peace Studies and a visiting professor of sociology, the biggest challenge Foxley will face is managing the 1990 budget which already will have been passed into law by Pinochet before the new gov­ernment takes office. 
"The crucial point is to make adjustments in the budget law," Garreton said. He said Pinochet, "made the budget for 1990 law. Their hands are tied; it gives very little leverage to the new government." 
Garreton said that Foxley does not face an economic crisis in Chile and that the new government, "will not be forced to have an emergency economic plan." 
Pinochet surrendered the presidency he has held for the last 16 years, but still controls the nation's army. Other branches of the military are not in his control. Aylwin has asked for Pinochet's resignation along with that of the commander of the marine forces. He has not called for the resignations of all military

Arrival of baby marks end of uncle's reign 
Ah, the miracle of birth. No, Mom, I don't have any surprises for you, I'm just expressing won­der at the birth of my John O'Brien 
first niece, Ashley. Assistant News Editor 
The pregnancy was a hot topic around the O'Brien household almost from the mo­ment of conception. 
For the past nine months, our family conversations centered around such pressmg questions as, "Is Diane showing yet?" or "How much do you wanna bet that Vince pukes in the delivery room?" 
Everybody in the family seemed to lind this baby thing exciting, except, of course, me. 
The prospect of having a little blob run­ning around the house during family dinners signified only one thing to me: the end of my reign as "baby of the family."

Via Associated Press Graph1csNet 
Yesterday's high: 43 Yesterday's low: 38 
Forecast: 

High today in the 30s or lower 40s. Snow likely tonight possibly becom­ing mixed with freezing rain and sleet. Low tonight ranging from 30 to 
40. Rain or freezing rain expected Saturday will change to all rain by late morning. High Saturday will range from the 40s to lower 50s . 
Even though I'm a college sophomore and a big time journalist at The Observer. my mom insists on introducing me as her "baby." This is generally embarrassing because most people equate "baby of the family" with "spoiled brat" which is exactly correct. Any little brat who becomes the baby of the O'Brien family will steal my thunder. 
So, while I awaited the coming of this little demon with anguish, I was a little caught up in the excitement. I even partici­pated in the baby pool my dad started. Put in two bucks and predict the date of birth and sex of the little tyke and you might win $15. 
Not even the entrance of a new life into the world was unstained by gambling, but then again 15 bucks is 15 bucks. I became alarmed wlwn my brother entered the pool. Sounds like Pete Hose bPtting on his own games, huh? 
Finally, the day came. 

My sister-in-law was nine days late when my mom woke me at 4 a.m. to call me Uncle John. She was really excited, but I was more concPrned with why, if the kid was already nine days late, couldn't it wait until say, noon, aftPr I had showered and eaten breakfast? 
Then came time to go to the hospital and see the little bugger. They said she was a beautiful baby, but they say that about every baby, most of which look like potatoes. 
But Ashley turned out pretty well. She was pretty cute for a 10-pound, 7-ounce potato. My sister-in-law called the labor "easy." Somehow, spending four hours trying to pass something the size of watermelon sounds neither easy nor fun to me. I pity my future wili1. 
In the end, my new niece didn't turn out so had and I guess it was about time that I passed .on the reign of baby of the family to her. 
So, Ashley, welcome to the family. You've got a tough act to follow, but stick with Unde John and you'll do all right.

Arson not cause of fire at St. Michael's 
By BRADLEY GALKO News Writer 
Arson has been ruled out as a possible cause of the Saint Michael's Laundry fire that oc­curred in the early morning hours of November 16. 
Assistant Vice-President for Business Affairs James Lyphout said that fire investigators have also ruled out any electrical cause of the blaze. 
"They're still looking at some chemicals," said Lyphout, "they think the cause is some kind of chemical reaction or spontaneous combustion." 
l.yphout said he was "a little surprised" at the length of time required to determine the cause of the fire, but he said that the dday could be caused in part by the possibility of an indeter­minable cause. "It is possible," he said, "there may never be a definitive cause."

The number of machines on campus is not the only thing that has increased since the Saint Michael's fire, so has the price of doing laundry. A single wash cycle used to cost 85 cents and a dryer cycle 35 cents. They now cost one dollar and 50 cents, respectively. 
Lyphout said this price in­crease is not a result of the in­creased demand for the ma­chines caused by the fire. "That's just a price increase that would have happened any­way," he said. 
Robert Watkins, director of materials and management purchasing, was unable to be reached for comment on the price increase.

Romanians wait for meat to arrive at a general store in central Bucharest. Food supplies have improved, but due to hoarding of available goods, authorities have expressed concern that essential items would run out. 
Former Bulgarian leader arrested 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) ­Former leader Todor Zhivkov was put under house arrest and charged with abuse of power and fomenting ethnic unrest during his 34-year reign, the government-run news agency BTA reported Thursday. 
The state agency also said opposition talks with the ruling Communists broke down Thursday over access to Bul­garia's broadcasting networks. 
The prosecutor-general's of­fice issued a warrant for the deposed dictator, who was top­pled in a November uprising, charging Zhivkov with malfea­sance in office, inciting ethnic hostility and misuse of state property. 
The 78-year-old Stalinist was not jailed, according to BTA. but was instead put under guard at an l)ndisclosed loca­tion. 
That makes him the second East Bloc leader now under of­ficial investigation for abuses disclosed by the upheavals that have convulsed Eastern Europe. Former East German party leader Erich Honecker, now hospitalized, faces a charge of high treason. 
The charges against Zhivkov indicate he is being personally blamed by his reformist Com­munist successors for the na­tion's severe ethnic and eco­nomic problems. 
Zhivkov was the author of so­called "Bulgarization," the per­secution and forced assimila­tion of the nation's 1.5 million ethnic Turks and other native Bulgarian Muslims, known as Pomaks. 
After his ouster, Zhivkov was accused of corruption when it was revealed he had maintained at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats throughout this poor Balkan nation. 
Zhivkov's often-violent forced assimilation policy banned Moslem religious practices and required ethnic Turks and Moslems to forsake their own names and take Bulgarian ones. 
More than 300,000 ethnic Turks emigrated to Turkey to escape the harsh Bulgarization campaign, but about 80,000 later returned, citing lack of jobs and housing in Turkey. 
The talks with the reformist government of party chief Petar Mladenov have foundered over the government's refusal to al­low the opposition to use the electronic media to spread its

"We are left with the impres­sion that the delegation of the official authorities has no in­tention to carry (out) serious negotiations," said the Union of Democratic Forces, the um­brella grouping of opposition organizations, according to a statement carried by BTA

Earlier this week, the Com­munist Party agreed to allow the opposition to publish its own newspaper and promised it office space. 
Faced with the plummeting fortunes of the Communist Party in other Eastern Euro­pean states, Bulgaria's Com­munists appear to be trying to preserve as much power as possible, and their total control of radio and television is key to that power. 
The government-run media continues to attack opposition leaders in a clear attempt to discredit them with any poten­tial electorate.

"We are now busy trying to halt this process, to prevent it from going deeper and getting more acute," Gorbachev said in comments broadcast on state radio. "We have resorted to the use of force against criminals, against this vandalism." 

It was not clear whether the Kremlin intended to impose the curfew in Baku and other parts of Azerbaijan, or if Yazov ex­pected the Azerbaijani authori~ ties to do it. 
Members of the Azerbaijani People's Front said Thursday 

they had warned Moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on Baku they would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center. 
On Wednesday. the 29,000 troops already in Azerbaijan and the republic of Armenia were authorized to shoot if necessary to stop the bitter fighting in the hills around the disputed territory of Nagorno­Karabakh, according to Soviet media. 
Foreign reporters were 
barred from travel to the re­publics. 

In Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enelave inside Azerbaijan, officials expanded an existing curfew by two hours Thursday, said Tass, the oiTicial Soviet news agency. 
The military commandant in Nagorno-Karabakh also ordered unregistered organiza­tions dissolved, Tass said. 
Ycvgeny Primakov, a top­ranking Soviet legislator, con­fronted a mass anti-govern­ment d1~monstration outside the Azerbaijani Communist Party headquarters in Baku and said the riots had to stop. The demonstrators called for th1~ liquidation of Soviet power in Azerbaijan and the resignation of the Azerbaijani leadership, reported lnterfax, a news ser­vicn of Hadio Moscow. 
Soviet authorities sent 5,000 

army troops into Azerbaijan Tuesday. lnterfax said Thurs­day there are also 24,000 Inte­rior Ministry troops in the two southern republics 1.250 miles southeast of Moscow.

Yerevan, tlw Armenian capi­tal. was n~ported to be running out of fuel because of thn Azer­baijani blockade. Armenians countered with a blockade of Nakhichevan. an Azerbaijani 1mclave inside Armenia. Inter­fax said. 
Yazov said more troops were needed because the area was so large and "the people in liter­ally all towns and all populated areas have been roused by these events," according to Ha­dio Moscow. 
Yazov did not specify how 
The Observer 

many reserve soldiers had been called up. He said men were be­ing called up from "neighboring regions," but did not specify. Tass said the men had recently completed their compulsory military service. 
Yazov said he understood re­servists ·would be unhappy about his move but emphasized that they are not going with "the task of killing, shooting, going onto some offensive. It is principally to protect public order." 
He said the reservist call-up was needed in part because re­eent cuts under Gorbachev's plan .to slash the nation's armed forces by 500,000 men have depleted the forces that can be moved to the Caucasus. 
Extremists besieged the Inte­rior Ministry department in the town of Masali for two hours, lnterfax reported. 
"Hundreds of trucks with Armenian militants patrol the border" with the Lachin and Kubaltin regions of Azerbaijan, lnterfax said, and troops have been reinforced. 
lnterfax also said thousands also rallied in Nakhichevan on Wednesday to protest plans to rebuild border defenses and string barbed wire along the middle of the Araks Hiver, the border with Iran. 
Hundreds of Azerbaijanis have crossed the river illegally in recent weeks to visit relatives and demand removal of the border barriers.

commanders, Garreton said. 

Pinochet's power will be greatly reduced even if he does not resign, "because of the democratic legitimacy of the new government," Garreton added. 
Pinochet originally gained power in 1973 by overthrowing Salvad6r Allende Gossens, a socialist, in a U.S. military­sponsored coup. 
Aylwin's new government is an alliance with 16 other parties, including the large socialist party. Garreton said the alliance should remain strong , "because of the strain put on it by the law to force it to unify." The hope of retaining power will be an incentive to stay unified, Garreton said. 
Previously Foxley served as vice president of the Christian Democratic Party, and has been a member of the faculty since 1982. According to a press release, Foxley frequently traveled between South Bend and Santiago and kept in close contact with the country. Foxley taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley, and Oxford University before coming to Notre Dame. Currently he serves as an executive committee member of the International Economi~ Association and as the president of the Corporation for Latin American Research.

Off-field media antics steal spotlight from on-field action 
You can't win for winning. 

After the 1989 season, Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz became a man under a magnifying glass, and no more so than at the Orange Bowl, where the media and the fans hung on to his every word. 
And I do mean every word. 

The media became a role player, as opposed to spectator and reporter, when KCNC television of Denver taped a Holtz pep talk to the team and broadcast selected segments, but only those derogatory to Colorado. 
"Let me tell you what," Holtz said to the team, "they've been living a lie. They've been living a lie all year. 
" ... They're used to scoring a lot of points. They ain't playing any Kansas State. We got to be patient on defense, just play our football game. On offense, we want to control the football ... Frustration will set in on Colorado's offense. By the middle of the third quarter, they will leave the game plan com­pletely and start grab-bagging. Remember me telling you that. They are not patient." 
The broadcast and subsequent print reports of Holtz' comments created more commotion than Chubby Checker's halftime show. Holtz was the bad guy again, this time for trying to pump up his team. 

Theresa Kelly Sports Editor 
What is a coach supposed to say to his team if he can't tell them how they're going to win? 
As it turned out, of course, Holtz' words were al­most psychically prophetic. The Buffaloes did wear down and become confused in the third quarter when the Irish took command. Holtz, who is criti­cized for downplaying the Irish and building up the opposition, was trashed in the media when he tried to instill confidence in his team. 
The pep talk wouldn't have been necessary, except for other media attention: Irish player comments were being twisted and contorted into Buffalo­bashing. Irish quarterback Tony Rice was quoted as saying that Notre Dame "would bring home a 'W.' " Colorado defensive tackle Okland Salavea, in re­sponse, said he didn't "think much of Tony Rice as a person." 
This is the same Salavea who said, "They ain't going to win. We are. It's a promise." This was re­ported as a touching tribute to the late Colorado quarterback, Sal Aunese. Rice was not heard ques­tioning Salavea's character after that remark. 
Aunese's death was tragic for the Colorado team, and their emotion made great news copy for most of the season. Colorado's grief was there for the public to see every time the Buffs stepped on the field. The sorrow was understandable, and their dedication to Aunese was admirable. But the story was told and retold, embellished and finally exploited by the me­dia. Even if the team had wanted to grieve privately, the story was just too good to pass up. 
The Irish could not win with the press: Holtz was criticized for housing the team at the Airport Hilton instead of at the beach. He was lambasted for wor­rying about Raghib Ismail's injured shoulder. His sensitivity was questioned when he called the Colorado coach "Dick" McCartney instead of "Bill." He spent most of the post-game press conference explicitly saying that he had nothing against the Miami football team, because he was wary of the Miami press twisting his remarks into anti-Miami, not pro-Notre Dame, sentiment. He even was criti­

Notre Dame 36, Virginia 13 Kickoff Classic 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -Lou Holtz, who often uses boxing analo­gies in team speeches, watched his team turn in a Mike Tyson-type per­formance Thursday night at Giants Stadium. 
Scoring touchdowns on each of its first five possessions, Notre Dame opened its national championship de­fense with a 36-13 Kickoff Classic win over Virginia. 
"I don't know if we can play much better than we did in the first 25 minutes," said Holtz. 
The Irish dealt their first blow when Todd Lyght intercepted Vir­ginia quarterback Shawn Mpore's pass on the third play from scrim­mage. Six plays later, Ricket Watters skirted two yards into the end zone

Notre Dame 24, Michigan 19 
ANN AHBOH, Mich. -"Thank God for Hocket Ismail." "lie may be the most dangerous player around, with the ball." 
Irish tri-captain Ned Bolcar and Michigan head coach Bo Schembech­ler pretty much summed up the game as the Notre Dame football team defeated the Wolverines 24-19 Sat­urday afternoon, riding the wings of the Hocket Man. 
The game, played on a soggy, dark afternoon, lived up to its billing as the top-ranked Irish battled the No.2 Wolverines to a close finish. 
Ismail's two kickoff returns for touchdowns in the second half were the best offense for the Irish, who played an extremely conservative game on offense. For his efforts, Is­mail was awarded the game ball by Irish head eoach Lou lloltz. 
"I told him I wish he could find it 
somehow in the budget to give a game ball to everybody who was on the kickofT return team," Ismail said, "because it would really be unfair for one person to receive the ball when there's actually 11 guys that made it all happen."

The top-ranked Notre Dame foot­ball team won Saturday's game against Michigan State. 
The unfamiliar, mistake-prone, pressumd Irish mado tho game doso, as it took a fourth-quarter drive to settle the game at 21-13. 
"I think our guys will grow from this week," Notre Dame head coach Lou lloltz said. "They faced adversity wlwn things woren't going well. 
We played badly and kind of got frustrated and tried to do things that aren't built into the system. There were a lot of mistakes made during the course of the football gamo. We have an awful lot for work to do, we're just going to have to go forward." 
Wait a minute. who won this game? 
Give some credit to the Spartans, though. Playing without their leading ground-gainer, the Spartans turned to a passing attack to put a scare into the Notre Dame team that was an 18-point favorite. 
Notre Dame 40, Purdue 7 
WEST LAFAYETTE Notre 
Dame's top-ranked Fighting Irish 
spent a week hearing people question 
their abilities after last weekend's 
near-upset loss to Michigan State. 
Then they went out and answered just about every one of them in a 40­7 rout of a pitiful Purdue team that committed eight turnovers Saturday at Ross-Ade Stadium. 
In a game similar to last year's 51­7 rout of Purdue, the Irish jumped out to a 34-0 halftime lead, outgain­ing the Boilermakers 344-93, before letting their reserves get some game experience in the final 30 minutes. 
"They're the most talented group I've seen put together in a long time, maybe the best ever," said Purdue coach Fred Akers, who has been a head coach since 1975. "They are clearly the number-one team in the country." 
Notre Dame 27, Stanford 17 
PALO ALTO, Calif.-No one told Notre Dame about the change in the schedule Saturday. The Irish ex­pected Stanford. What they got was an air force. 
Notre Dame won the thriller 27-17, but Stanford quarterback Steve Smith gave the Irish fits, never let­ting up on an aerial attack that in­cluded 39 completions in 68 attempts for 282 yards. 
"We knew they were a passing team," said Irish free 56fety Pat Ter­rell, "but this was something we couldn't predict. In the secondary, you just have to hit them as soon as you can and let them know who hit them." 
Notre Dame 41, Air Force 27 
COLORADO SPHINGS, Colo. -The 
question finally was answered here 
Saturday night at Falcon Stadium. 
Air Force is good, but not good 
enough. 

A bigger and more talented Notre 
Dame team delivered that message 
via a 41-27 victory over the Falcons 
before a record crowd of 53, 533. 
In a game of big plays, the Irish 
turned in the bigger ones to move to 
6-0. It was the 18th consecutive win 
for Notre Dame and ended Air 
Force's dream of an unbeaten 
season and a possible national title. 
"Our team is very hurt and disap­
pointed," Air Force coach Fisher De­
Berry said. "We felt the stage was 
set for us to win, but we didn't play 
well enough to beat the national 
champions. I'm disappointed with 
the outcome, but proud of the 
effort." 

Notre Dame 28, USC 24 
For all the excitement Notre Dame and Southern California created on the field in a 28-24 Irish victory, the postgame talk centered on two inci­dents outside the tunnel leading to the locker rooms. 
The tryst everybody will remember came before the Oct. 21 contest, when a fight ensued as Southern California players tried to enter the tunnel as the Irish were running punting drills in the end zone. The episode had Irish coach Lou Holtz saying he would quit if such an event occurred again. 
"I sincerely apologize to Southern Cal," said Holtz. "I promise this will never happen again at Notre Dame regardless of who was at fault." 
But the Trojans also made a big mistake in that fateful Notre Dame Stadium tunnel, while both teams were exiting"" the field at halftime. And that error might have been what propelled the Irish to their seventh consecutive victory over Southern Cal. 
Notre Dame 45, Pitt 7 
The Notre Dame football team, after battling the media all week in the wake of the tunnel incident against USC, battled back on the field in defeating the seventh-ranked Pitt Panthers 45-7, in a game that was far easier for the Irish than had been predicted. "Pitt is a fine football team,"said Holtz,holding to form. "This is the first time we played a complete game as a complete team.! thought our football team played well and they played together. It was just one of our days.Pitt had an extra week to get ready for us but we did have an advantage the week we had seemed like a good month." 
Barring the first six minutes of the game where the Panthers, utilizing a no-huddle offense, marched down 68 yards to draw first blood in this bat­tle. But as far as Pittsburgh is con­cerned their highlight camera might as well be turned off at this time. It was all Irish after this point in the contest.The game was so one sided that Panther coach Mike Gottfried was so horrified by the loss he sug­gested that his team totally reevalu­ate itself. 
Notre Dame 41, Navy 0 
Five Navy football coaches, six 
U.S. Presidents and 26 years have come and gone since the Midshipmen last found a way to defeat Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame has played a school­
record 21 consecutive football games 
without finding a way to lose to any­
one. 

The beat went on for both of those 
streaks Saturday at Notre Dame 
Stadium, as Ricky Watters' 134 
yards led a 424-yard team rushing 
performance that drove the top­
ranked Fighting Irish, 9-0, to a 41-0 
shutout of the Middies. 
"I don't have anything to do with that; powers beyond me determine it," Uzelac said about Navy's willing­ness to continue a series in which it has lost the last 26 meetings. "When you win, you see some things very positive in the game. When you lose, no matter what happens, you don't really get much out of it." 
Notre Dame 59, SMU 6 

The Good. The Bad. And the Ugly. 
Notre Dame defeated Southern Methodist 59-6 Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium, as the Irish found a passing game and the Mustangs found they weren't quite ready to fact the No.1 team in the nation. 
The Good on Saturday was Notre Dame. The Bad was SMU. The Ugly was not only the final score, but the Irish efforts to keep themselves in check and not embarrass the Mus­tangs by scoring even more. 
That the Irish took four delay of game penalties to keep themselves from scoring was obvious enough, but Rusty Setzer's run out of bounds when he had a clear shot at the end­zone made Notre Dame's intentions all too clear. 
Notre Dame 34, Penn St. 23 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -Penn State was eager Saturday to demon­strate a couple of reasons why Notre Dame had never won before at Beaver Stadium. 
The pregame weather forecast showed 15 to 20 mile per hour winds with a zero-degree wind chill (33-de­gree temperature). Blair Thomas, who had frozen Irish national championship hopes in 1987 with a career-best 214-yard rushing day, led Penn State to scores on its first two possessions and an early lead. 
But while Penn State had managed to win its four previous meetings here with Notre Dame, the Lions never had hosted an Irish team quite like this one. By the time the snow arrived in the second half, it fell on a Penn State offense watching on the sidelines as the Irish running game was burning the Lions' top-ranked scoring defense for a 34-23 victory. 
Miami 27, Notre Dame 1o 
On paper, it was a good football game. 
But they didn't play the game on paper. They played it in the Orange Bowl, and that made all the differ­ence in Miami's 27-10 win over Notre Dame, which knocked the Irish out of the top ranking, stopped a 23­game winning streak and gave the Hurricanes (1 0-1) the revenge they 
wanted from last season's Notre Dame win. 
"I tell you what, I've never been around a game like this," said Miami head coach Dennis Erickson. "It's the greatest win I've ever been associated with. You've got to give our football team a lot of credit, they gave a lot. We did some unbelievable things out there." 
"I really hate to lose," said a de­spondent Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz, "but if we had to lose, I'm glad it was to an outstanding foot­ball team." 
But three big plays, in which Miami executed and Notre Dame didn't, set the tone for the game, and the sharp, emotional Hurricanes dominated the Irish the second half.

cized for letting the Irish players go home for Christmas. 
At the day-after press conference, lloltz pondered changing the way he deals with the press. Prior to the game, a reporter suggested that Colorado's de­fensive backs might be quicker that Miami's. Holtz said he didn't think any team could have defensive backs quicker than Miami's. 
"I pick up the paper the next day," Holtz said, "and I see the headline 'Holtz doubts Buffs' quick­ness.' " 
There is nothing wrong with the scramble for a better story, or an enticing headline. But the twist­ing and contorting, the dirty tricks and hanging on to every word in order to find something to exploit negatively, don't help the game. This isn't an accu­rate representation of the football teams and the football game, and it's a sad day when the perfor­mances of the media outshine the performances on the field.

Waiting for the return of ~~~~~~~~-in~meaningfulrela­
mate for the month, if you 
wish. 
But if you insist on searching 
through the raindrops for your 
own true love, then make the 
rainy season work for you by 
taking this advice: don't give 
any potential love partners 
more than a second look until 
you find out what they look like 
after they've been left out in the 
rain. A rain-soaked face gives 
up its secrets like a guilty 
conscience on judgement day. 
If the rainy season tries your soul in winter, the obvious an­tidote is to find love that is stronger than death. Where can you find a love for all seasons in this single season of sunless days when the earth's crust has turned soggy, sullen, and spongy from the inconvenient puddles of January? 
"At lovers' perjuries/ They say, Jove laughs," wrote Shakespeare. You should hope that Jove is tender in his regard for the lovers' perjury that promises love that is stronger than death, which seems well­nigh impossible, unless ·you happen to have a heart like Jove's. 
Hemingway's English nurse tells her lieutenant: ''I'll love you in the rain and in the snow and in the hail. I'll love you no matter how it is." He asks: "Why are you afraid of the rain?" She says: "Sometimes I see you dead in it." Frederic Henry tells us: "She was crying. I comforted her and she stopped crying. But outside it kept on raining." 
"A Farewel1 to Arms" ends with Catherine's death in child­birth. Frederic Henry's final words are: "It was like saying goodbye to a statue. After a while, I left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain." 
Give not your hearts away in winter, when lovers' souls should grow lean with fasting, like hibernating bears. The win­ter rain is full of ghosts that haunt us in the shape of unre­membered loves that have come 
and gone like birds vanished from a lonely tree where once the summer sang. 
Yet laughing Jove is gracious. In the heart of the winter of our discontent, he sends lovers their feast day and their presid­ing saint, who keeps our hearts of flesh from turning to ice again after they have thawed once in the floods. February 14, St. Valentine's, should be pre­pared for with prayer and good works, so that that day of great grace will not find us un­prepared, as Easter does in a year when we have overlooked Lent. 
There are a diminishing num­bers shopping days left before young lovers and older lovers trade their hearts in a game like musical chairs. That's why I'm offering you this pastorai hint. If you're in the doldrums, trying to survive, read Donne's sonnet, "Death, Be Not Proud," and then visit Hallmark for the card of your choice for the sweetheart you'd like most to take home on a slow boat to China. 
You can tell me, if you like, "Terence, this is stupid stuff." But as they say in the land of the midnight sun, it keeps the lead in your pencil while you're waiting for the return of the days of wine and roses, when the soft summer rain falls in our lives as gently as the poetry of an Irish blessing. 
days of wine and roses 
The rain in winter may start feeding each other the pieces of you thinking of death and dy­a script. But I swear that this is ing, so please consider yourself the line the girls used to hand pastorally warned.

courting the girls, it was an idea that was apt to turn up on a date. At lunch, or on a moonlight stroll, the lass might tell you, ''I've always been afraid of the rain." 
Your answer was, "I like it." The other would reply, "I like to walk in it," and you would say, "You're not really afraid of the rain, are you?" 

Her great speech would be: ''I'm afraid of the rain, because sometimes I see me dead in it." The intensity of the announce­ment would be diminished by your awareness .that it was to­tally insincere. How could it not be insincere, since it was lifted word for word from Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms?': 
In my day, everyone had read the book, or seen the movie, and couples used to play-act at being Lieutenant Henry, an American ambulance driver on the Italian front in World War I, and Catherine Barkley, his beautiful English nurse­though perhaps not con­sciously, as though they were 
stealing lines from a great war 
novel. You couldn't be sure 
what she thought she was doing 
when she told you, "I can see 
myself dead in the rain." 
Your role was to assure her, 
"I can keep you safe. I know I 
can." 
She would try to accept your 
offer, saying, ''I'm not afraid of 
the rain. I'm not afraid of the 
rain. Oh, God, I wish I wasn't." 
This fine display of pseudo­
emotion was a cue for you to 
comfort her in a manly way like 
the bravest soldier in a danger­
ous world. 
Just to let you see what the movies have come to, one of the women dated by the schlemiel­character whom Woody Allen always plays tells him, ''I'm afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it." He accuses her on the spot of trying to turn him on with pur­loined pathos from Hemingway's "Farewell." He thereby exposes her phoniness as though it were a mortal sin, totally opposed to the new sin­cerity and unblinking honesty Sexual mtlmacy, apparently, 
requires total openness as its 
cornerstone, since the dating 
game is now serious business. 
Whenever it's a drizzly November in his soul, Ishmael tells us in "Moby Dick," he sets out to sea as a substitute for suicide, for, he says, "Water and meditation are forever wedded." Death and rain are also physically intimate. That's why Hollywood loves to show  us those graveyard shots, where the mourners and next­of-kin are hovered together, under a roof of black umbrellas that hang together like an omi­nous cloud. 
As I write this, the Notre Dame weather has been rainy and gray for the past several days. The gloom doesn't do much for the climate of your soul, where the doldrums may have set in for the month of January. In London, where I spent Christmas, the radio sta­tions try to cheer up with a weather song, to help you sur­vive an overcast sky: "The sun had got its hat on. It's coming out to play...," but such silly symphonies don't keep away the thoughts of death and dy­ing. 
My own good advice is that you make your peace with the foul weather as though it were a fair-weather friend. Search the sidewalks to see if the earthworms are out ahead of the early birds that harbinger the spring. Or grab an umbrella and put on a raincoat, and go singin' and dancin', Gene Kelly­style, in the rain. 
But don't, whatever else you do, fall in love during the rainy season. Have dates. Meet new people. Find yourself a play­

ND tennis to meet Georgia, SMU 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
For the most elite collegiate tennis teams, the early part of the season is comprised of "warm-up" matches and tune­ups for conference play. For the Notre Dame men's tennis team, the first weekend on the schedule is anything but a for­mality. 
The Irish open their 1990 spring season today in Chicago's Midtown Tennis .Club for the American Airlines Classic. Notre Dame faces the second-ranked Georgia Bulldogs today at 1 p.m. and the very talented Mustangs of Southern Methodist University at 2 p.m. Saturday. 
"These two matches in the American Airlines Classic give us a great opportunity to play national teams and not have to travel far from school," said Irish coach Bob Bayliss. "Georgia and SMU are two of the five schools that dominated collegiate tennis during the 1980's." 
In the early part of the the 1988-89 season, the Irish trav­eled to the West Virginia Quadrangular and knocked off traditionally strong North Carolina. This victory cata­pulted Notre Dame tennis to new heights and established them at the national level. Bayliss and company are hoping this weekend will take the program one step further.

Aspirations are high for the 1990 Notre Dame tennis team. Notre Dame is ranked fourth in the Midwest region, ahead of perennial Midwestern powers Michigan and Northwestern. To add fuel to the fire, 11th­ranked Southern California barely got past the Irish 5-4 in Notre Dame's only fall dual match. 
The Irish go up against the top collegiate singles player in the nation this weekend ­Georgia's AI Parker. Georgia returns four of its top seven players from last year's NCAA tournament team. 
"Georgia is not going to daz­zle you," said Bayliss. "But they are solid and do not have any holes in their lineup. They are pretty even all the way down their lineup. I think we have reached the point that if we play great, then we can win. It will take nothing less than great play on our part to win against Georgia." 
The matchup of the No. 1 se~ds -DiLucia vs. Parker-is an interesting battle between two different types of players. DiLucia, ranked 44th in the na­tion, is a serve-and-volley player, while Parker is renowned for his excellent groundstrokes and passing 1 shots. 
"Parker is a formidable op­ponent for David, but (DiLucia) should not be afraid of him, " says Bayliss. "They played to­gether on the national team, so they know each .other pretty well." 
SMU is not as strong as in years past, but the Mustangs still provide an excellent test for the youthful Irish squad. SMU's record includes a vic­tory over the 25th-ranked Kansas Jayhawks. 
The Mustangs will be without the. services of top-seeded player Tim Tregirro. Tregirro is awaiting the NCAA's decision regarding his eligibility status. The NCAA is investigating whether or not he accepted prize money from a summer tournament. 
"This should be a close match," said Bayliss. "The strength of SMU's lineup lies in their top four positions. They are weaker at five and six. To beat SMU would be a major step for Notre Dame. Beating a traditional power just like North Carolina might signal a changing of the guard. Coming out this weekend with a split would be a big accomplish­ment." 
Hornets get first road win 

DENVER (AP) The 
Charlotte Hornets, getting four 
of Kelly Tripuka's 28 points to 
hang on in the final minute, 
won their first road game in 17 
tries this season. The Hornets, 
the last NBA team to win on the 
road, also ended their six-game 
losing streak. 

Denver rallied from a seven­
point deficit in the last 2:05 to 
tie the game. A 3-pointer by Fat 
Lever, a drive-in by Michael 
Adams and two free throws by 
Todd Lichti made it 104-104 
with 57 seconds remaining. 

Dell Curry, who had 20 points 
for the Hornets, broke the tie 
with a pair of free throws with 
49 seconds left. Tripuka hit a 
16-footer from the left baseline 
with 22 seconds remaining, but 
Bill Hanzlik pulled Denver to 
108-107 on a 3-pointer with 19 
seconds left. 

A backcourt violation by the Hornets with nine seconds remaining gave Denver another chance.

NO hockey goes 4-4 during injury-plagued road stretch 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team weathered both insult and in­jury to post a 4-4 record on a midwinter road swing over Christmas break. 
The insult, courtesy of an overzealous goal judge at Cadet Ice Arena, gave Air Foree a 4-3 overtime victory over the Irish on Jan. 3. The goal judge 11ashed the red light to signal a goal and sudden death for the Irish even though it appeared that goalie Lance Madson had smothered a shot by Mike Veneri of the Falcons before it reached the goal line. 
Heferee Mark Handolph con­curred with the goal judge, and although Notre Dame coach Ric Schafer and his players stormed the ice to protest, the game was over, and the Falcons had earned a split of their two-game series with the Irish. Notre Dame had won the previous night by a 4-2 score, but the second game was the one which concerned Schafer. 
"The videotape clearly shows that (Veneri's shot) was not a goal," argued a disappointed 

Schafer, "It W{lS just very  un­ 
fortunate  that  we  lost  like  
that."  

The injuries also are most unfortunate. First, freshman defenseman Eric Gregoire suf­fered a collapsed lung in a game against Minnesota­Duluth. Gregoire is out for the season. 
Then, forwards Bruce Guay and Dan Marvin injured their 

Sterling Black 

shoulders. Guay got hurt in the controversial loss to Air Force and missed four games. Marvin was sidelined during a 3-2 vic­tory over Kent State. 
In their absence, freshman left wing Tom Miniscalco has. picked up the slack. Miniscalco scored three goals in a two­game sweep of Arizona, as the track just two days after the Air Force disaster. Schafer's squad smashed the Wildcats 8­2 on Jan. 5 and 8-6 on Jan. 6 
"Tom Miniscalco has worked hard for us," praised Schafer, "Since Marvin, Guay and Gregoire are out of the lineup, players (like Miniscalco) who have been on the periphery for us are getting a chance to play now." 
In the second game against the Wildcats, freshman Sterling Black set a Notre Dame record for the quickest goal at the start of a period when he· scored just 13 seconds into the game. He struck again 12 sec­onds later, and the rout which ensued was not nearly as close as the final score. 
The Irish opened their trip with a 9-3 loss to the second­ranked Wisconsin Badgers in the Milwaukee Tournament. Notre Dame was simply out of its league, as the Badgers pep­pered Madson with 38 shots in front of the largest crowd (13,380) ever to witness a Notre Dame hockey game. 
Madson and company had an equally difficult task the follow­ing night, as they faced WCIIA power Minnesota-Duluth. The only consolation for the Irish in

Swimmers adjust after Florida trip 
By JANICE ARCHER Sports Writer 
Tlw Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams returned from an intense training trip in Florida to mixed results in meets last week against Northwestern and Ball State. 
Notre Dame now begins a challenging stretch in its schedule with a meet today at Northern Illinois. 
The ten-day trip took the teams to tlw prestigious International Fitness Center in Orlando and to Mission Bay in Boca Baton. Notre Dame was one of 66 college teams from across the country at work in these state-of-th1~-art outdoor facilities. providing an atmosphere of constant train­ing. 
"We gained so much from being together all the time," said Irish coach Tim Welsh.

Northwestern on Jan. 12 for a 
tri-meet against their hosts and 
Creighton University. The 
men's team won· their meet, 
with a victory in the 400-yard 
medley relay by the talented 
team of Tom Whowell. Tom 
Penn, Ed Broderick and Bill 
Jackoboiee. The women came 
out with a split decision by de­
feating Creighton and falling to 
Northwestern. 

"I'm very pleased with the 
way we swam," said Welsh. 
"This meet was a test to see if 
we could get back into the rac­
ing frame after such a long, in­
tensive period of training. The 
meet against Northwestern is a 
great one for our schedule. and 
I hope to keep the series going." 
The difficulties in making the 
transition from a training 
period to a racing one he1:ame more apparent in the next day's meets with Ball State. The men suffered their first loss of the season, falling 138-105. The women fared no better, losing 182-111, but seeing excellent performances from talented freshman Tanya Williams. 
victories in the 200-yard indi­vidual medley and the 200-yard butterfly, setting a new pool record. 
"The wheels fell of the cart for that day," said Welsh. "To their credit, Ball State was very well prepared for us, and it was clear that our swimmers were fatigued after the long trip." 
The Irish have been emphasizing fundamentals such as technique and turns during this week of transition. Beginning today with an away meet in Northern Illinois, the teams face a grueling schedule against strong opponents. 
Because final exams ended late this year, there were no al­ternatives to ending the season with many meets scheduled closely together. Upcoming op­ponents include Cleveland State and St. Bonaventure. 
Guay's goal with 8:32 left in the game, which prevented Duluth goalie Chris Erickson from recording a shutout.

Second-period goals by Black,
