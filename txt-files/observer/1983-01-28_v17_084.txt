The Notre Dame Student Government 
is spon~oring a s~udent exchange with Saint Michael's Campus at the University ofToronto. Notre Dame will be hosting Toronto students next weekend, and Notre Dame students will be visiting the Toronto campus Feb. 2-f-27. Each Notre Dame student will be paired up with and host a Toronto student during the exchange. In return, that stu­dent will be hosted by his Toronto partner during the visit to Toronto at the end of February. -The Observer 
Golf cart transportation will be available Mon­
day for temporarily handicapped students, according to Sister Evelyn Booms of Handicapped Student Affairs. Volunteer drivers, stationed at the new Center for Social Concerns building, will drive mjured students to and from their classes, but Booms said a few more drivers are still needed. Students wishing such transportation can call 2:39-7200, beginning Monday. -The Obsen•er 
you own three pairs of athletic shoes and seldom watch much television. The typical college student does, according to a survey completed recently by Belden Associates for CASS Stu­dent Advertising, a national ad representative for college newspapers. The purpose ofthe scientifically conducted study of2S campuses was to evaluate the college market and buying habits of college students. Eighty-three percent read a college paper, while 64 percent read a daily city paper. Time, Newsu•eek, Playboy, Cos­mopolitan, Glamour and Rolling Stone, in that order, are the most popular. Thirty-six percent said they hadn't watch any television the previous day, while 38 percent had viewed one to three hours. An amazing 98 percent own athletic shoes, with the average at three. Moving up the transportation scale, S9 percent own a car, and 13 percent plan to buy a car within the next year. Almost 90 percent had checking accounts, 64 percent had savings accounts, and 19 percent had a Visa credit card. -The Observer 
NORML plans a new push to capitalize on the 
paraquat issue and rebuild its support on college campuses for legalized marijuana. The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws will rely heavily on that campus support to renew the efforts. according to national director George Franham. Florida students have oppcsed government usc of paraquat, a herbicide, on illegal marijuana t1elds in that state. Paraquat contaminated marijuana can still be sold to unsuspecting users, and can cause lung damage or death, say those who oppose it. NORM!. has been crippled in recent years by waning interest, and a reduced bu~get. Franham says a stalemate now exists, preventing more states from passing decriminalization legislation. -The Obsen;er 
From movies to the classrootn? E.T., the 
extra-terrestrial, has apparently joined the faculty of Notre Dame's Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering department, according to the engineering faculty list in the foyer of Cushing Hall. Secretaries in the Aerospace office said jokingly that E.T. was selected for his expertise in telecommunications. One faculty member said E.T. will definitely have a phone on his new desk. -The Observer 
A mysterious worm-like parasite dis­
covered by chance may be the cause ofa potentially deadly disease which strikes up to I 0 percent of pregnant women and kills thousands of infants, researchers say. The organism has been linked to toxemia of pregnancy, a condition which causes retardation or death of the fetus, said Dr. Silvio Aladjem, chairman of the Depart­ment of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Loyola University's Stritch School of Medicine. Toxemia in pregnant women can cause high blood pressure, swelling, and in the most severe cases, convulsions, he said Wednesday. Between I2,000 and 24,000 infants and fetuses die annually in the United States because of the condition, Aladjem estimated, and the t1gures represent mostly infants. Even with treat­ment, U.S. toxemia patients have an eight percent mortality rate, he said. An average of more than 100 pregnant women died of the con­dition each year between 1968 and I975, according to figures from the National Center for Health Statistics in Bethesda, Md. No cure for toxemia is known, and doctors now are forced to treat the symptoms by trying to reduce blood pressure, giving anti-convulsive drugs, or inducing early labor to remove the fetus from danger, Aladjem said.

HPC's Quiet Riot 
Been to a good riot lately? 

Pep rallies don't count. I mean the spontaneous, passion-filled marches for a cause which were at the t()refront of newscasts throughout the late '60s and ear­ly '70s. 
If you arc the average modern student, you have not even considered throwing a rock through a window, for rioting on campus has passed as an appropriate form of social expression. Rioting never even got started here, for Father Hesburgh dipped the wings ofcampus radi­cals with his "Fifteen minutes or else" letter to the stu­dent body. 
The letter, dated Feb. I 7, 1969, stated that "anyone or any group that substitutes force tor rational persua­sion...will be given t1fteen minutes to cease and desist" before being immediately suspended. 
The lack of violent activism, however, has not been limited to Notre Dame. An article in this week's US. News & World Report explains "Why It's Quiet on the 
~~~~t~s :;):t." t()!:~ ~\'-1\\(~~-~~ ;r,: 
hotbeds Columbia, Kent ~~\\\\.\ 0 State and Berkeley, the ar-n~~ ~~ . I 
1 
tide documents how the \.\)·~~\~~\~.\\y'1i , 
pressures of inflation and \\\\ 
recession "have turned stu­dents' attention from world politics to personal t1nance." 

Says Jerald (;. Bachman of the University of Michigan, the "hopes and plans of stu­dents t1t pretty well the con­ventional view of the 'American dream.' " One can mourn the loss of mass displays of concern and la­ment the apathetic, al­ledgedly self-centered personality of the modern college campus, but "Get In­volved" editorials and sermons will not prod students to do what they have no interest in doing. 
Individual students will do what they wish, and they have remained active. But with the plethora of issues, causes and organizations, their interests have changed. ln the U.S. News article, H.ogcr Howard, associate dean of students at the University of Wisconsin, reports: "These issues aren't resulting in thousands of students marching with candles and bricks. Students want the most effective tactics possible." 
Effectiveness -one of those key words you hear around the College of Business Administration -has become the goal of campus causes. Riots are nice, and they provide excellent video tor local television sta­tions, but effective they are not. 
The Hall Presidents' CounCil has realized this, and demonstrated the right approach in its recent tight to re-establish happy hours in hall party rooms. 
Without resorting to mud-slinging or imoassioned calls for defiance of Father Van Wolvlear's ban, the

Inside Friday 

Council agreed to invite the Vice President of Student Affairs to its next meeting. 
At the Dec. .., meeting, Van Volvlear.explained that happy hours were taking place because of a loophole in the party room guidelines. In his letter to rectors, Van Wolvlear clarified the policy, and effectively killed hap­py hours. 
The hall presidents responded by defending the con­
cept of happy hour~;, downplaying the role of alcohol, and emphasizing the social aspect of the gatherings. Van Wolvlear, who admitted that he did not know what exact­ly occurs at a hall happy hour, later said he had 
received much insight at the meeting. He indicated he would allow happv hours if the rectors appro\·cd of the idea. ''I'm not bullheaded," he said. The rectors did approve. Hall happy hours have now returned in the same fashion as they were before, except this time with the blessing, t1guratively speaking, of Van Wolvlear. The HPC reacted calmly to a situation which might have caused chaos ten years ago and the problem was solved effectively, albeit undramatically. Still, some members of the community prefer drama. Lloyd Burke and the Student Senate launched the ill­fated "Save the Buses" campaign last November in a symbolic attempt to raise S82S to repair Transpo buses. The drive came across as an irresponsible action in response to a situation which Burke himself should have handled with Van Wolvlear. Hi~ campaign alienated Van Wolvkar and ended up being quite inef­fective. Students have indeed changed. We are not prone to rant and to rave abol!t every issue, and in that sense we have matured. We expect our student governments to handle problems rationally and effectively, and we want to know what effective measures can be taken. Sending in twelve cents does not qualify as effective. Notre Dame studc:nts are not apathetic. We show concern, but in a rational way, and we expect the same from those who represent us.

A crowd gathered outside the Digital Equip­

ton Wednesday, raising fists and holding signs to 
Niki Scott 

The third storm in a chain blamed for nine deaths this week pounded California with hurricane-force 
winds,  driving  rains  and  :\0-foot  
waves  again  yesterday,roppling  
houses  into  the  sea,  washing  out  

roads and forcing hundreds to flee flooded homes. 
"I knew it was all over when I saw the hot tub sail by into the ocean," said Becky Hagan, who fled from her Malibu home just before it broke up in the boiling high tide. 
At least I00,000 homes lost power as the storm. which first hit the coast Wednesday, pushed across the Golden Gate state to the Rockies. 
The pounding surf destroved beachfront buildings, collap-sed piers and wrecked b6ats from the Oregon border to Mexico. Water was waist deep in many homes. Mudslides tumbled off hills and rivers rose out of their hanks.

Speakerclaims success harder for women 
By MARGARET FOSMOE 
Saint .11ar)''s Executit•e Editor 

Niki Scott says she started college because ":vty mother thought I should learn Latin and my father thought I should find a husband." 
Today, nearly 20 years later, Scott is a divorced mother of two and a nationallv syndicated columnist who says she has le'arned that "success is often harder than failure" f(>r working women. 
Scott. whose column "Working Women" is sydicated in more than ing. and had her column accepted fc:>r svndication hy l'nited Press Syd­icate. 
The columnist described reader response to her column as "astonishing." l 1ntil she started writing the column. Scott "did not know how lonely a great manY women out there are." 
From readers' letters. Scott says, she has learned that "women of all ages aren't sure it's all right to he successfuL TheY are ofter~-mo-re afraid ofsuccess than fa-fltrre."

Scott blame~ much ofthe isolation women fed upon the media. Reading monthlv women·~ magazines "gives women good reason to feel isolated." She charged that many of the articles in these magazines are irrelevant when compared to the lifestyles of most working women. Articles concern­ing how to tire a housekeeper or 
how to act in the hoardroom "simplv don't relate to the average woman," Scott said. 
The columnist also said that men are "getting a lot of mixed messages and they are having a rough time" because "they don't know what we need." 
"We ~igh and slam the cupbo~trd door when (our husb;mds) don't do the dishes .. .'W·e aren't clear what we want from them," she said.

Abramshopes to change Chautauqua 's direCtion 
By KELLY RYAN 
News Staff 
Andy Abrams, managn of Chautauqua, feels that the "Chance­To-Dance" events are the kind ofen­tertainment that "the majority wants,'' and plans to hold several more this semester. 
Student support for the dances in Chautauqua has been very strong, with attendance reaching almost 600 f<>r last week's dance. 
When asked why previous Chautauqua events, including tllms and live hands, have not attracted large crowds, Abrams said that "students do not want to watch people perform, they want to be per­f<>rmers themselves." 
Chautauqua, orginally a coffee house. has not fullfilled this role. Al­though live hands are usually the primarv attractions at coffee houses, they·have not been well-received by the Notre Dame community, according to Abrams. Because ofthis lack ofsupport, Chautauqua will try to sponsor events which the stu­dents will attend. As a result, Notre Dame will not attract the high quality live talent that is featured at surrounding colleges. 
The atmosphere in the ballroom presents additional problems. Be­cause the placement bureau uses Chautauqua for interviewing. equip­ment must constantlv he removed, and the tloor plan rearranged. 
Several improvements have been proposed. including the purchase of a bar and a large screen television, but Abrams feels that these invest­ments are not economically feasible until the placement bureau is rel­ocated, thus alleviating the traffic tlow through the room during the day.

Hockey's biggest sellout A large poster hanging in the hockey team's locker room proclaims. "You can kill us. hut we'll never die." The Notre Dame hockey plavers are still alive. hut the l'niversity dealt its death blow to the Notre Dame hockey program yesterday when Athletic Directo~ Gen: Corrigan announced that hockey would he rdegated to club sport status after 1-, years at the varsity level. · The announce-ment two weeks ago that the hockey team's future _was threatened came as a surprise to everyone except the higher echelons ot the athletic department and l'niversity administration. With corporate secrec:. and eftlciency, the {'niversity publicly acknowledged and then resolved the problem within a matter oftwo weeks, hardly enough time to investigate any kind of reasonable rescue plans. l'nlike three years ago. wh~n the students rushed to hockev's rescue like the cavalry in a John \X'ayne mone, this time the team was left stranded and defenseless, left to the savage budget slashers ofthe l'niversitv. Ironies abound in thi.s tragic situation. One of the major reasons offered_ f(?r scrapping hockey is economic; last year the program ra~ up a 52';0,000 dehctt. But where is the much publicized athletic endowment fund. started 111 19H I to henet1t hockev and the minor sports. the same fund that now amounts to over S I 0 million? A swi'mming pool certainly doesn't cost S I 0 million., . . If hockey is to be disbanded for incurring sucha large cleftctt, then why ts no mention ~acle of toning clown the intlated women's basketball program, even within the guidelines of Title IX? H~re is a program which curr~ntly has eight scholarship players and a budget of S125,000, and yet ~t any gtven game the number of people on the court usually outnumbers those 111 the stand~. . Lack of student support is the second reason given by the {1ntverstty for eliminating hockey. But the University has done absolutely nothing to promote hockey this year (or women's basketball, for that matter), no doubt a maJor factor in the relatively low attendance figures ( l ,600 per game). Had students been informed that tickets cost only S I or if a marketing campaign similar to "Breaking Away" of two vears ago had been attempted, the arena would have been packed--often. But these words are meaningless now. The axe has fallen, and Notre Dame •hockey lies mortally wounded. But there is one last thing we ca~ do for Coach Lefty Smith and his players. We can all be at the ACC tomorrow ntght at 7:30 for americathe game against Western Michigan, and again for, th~ fin_al four ~orne _games Feb. 11, 12, 25, and 26. If hockey is on its way out, lets gtve It the tnbute 1t deserves, with a genuine Notre Dame student body farewell, with packed stands and screaming fans. It's the least we can do.  by Jeb Cashin

Roper Review 
In the early !9-0's. when the Louisiana State Board of Education attempted to in­tegrate the state's puhlic colleges, many educators ohjected that the dissemination of students of inferior academic standing would onlY hampn an already plagued system.

Bilingual reports and sakty notices line the walls of employment offices throughout the nation.

Empire perspective reconsidered 
"I'm so bored of the l'SA." -The Clash, 
J•r­
Bc:tore embarking upon my semester-long trip to London, I had asked a close friend who had just recently returned from England about h1s impressions of the English attitude towards America. He made rcft:renct: to tht: aboH· quote. with a qualitkation; he equated the usc of the word "bored" with the word "Jealous" or "envious." The English. he felt, 

Robert Lloyd Snyder Over there 
wen: not really "bored" bv the supposed dull· ness or boring nature ofthe l'nitecl States itself -hut rather, the English were tired of hearing of the l nited States, of being led hy the l nitc:d States, and ultimatelY. having their vc:n· lives intluenccd daily bv decisions made in the good ol' l'.S. of A. 
In a sense, Ican easily understand this point. We often forget that while England has been little more than a secondary world actor during our lifetimes, tht: English empire ofthe I Hth and 19th centuries was tht: greates, power that the world has ever seen. \1uch ado is made about the catch-phrase, "the sun ncvcr set upon the British empire;" yet, sadly, this is obviouslY an empirt: in rapid decline. 
for Americans of our generation, it is very difilcult to conceive a world which was not dominated by political events which occur in :'>Jew York. Washington, and :\1oscow. London is generally thought of as a quaint and histori­cal English city rather than the seat of the l(>remost nation on earth. Today. it would be almost impossihle to recreate in our minds the importance that political decisions and events her<: once had t(>r the world. 
A visitor to England today sees a country racked hy labor unrest and verbal class war. The post-war youth movements which w<:re l(>rmerly little more than music-based turned political in the late 19""0's, resulting in the nihilistic "Punk" and anarchistic "Skinhead" cults which arc intluential and noisy minority group" among England's youth. The van· dalism that I have witnessed in London makes :\iew York's vandals seem like schoolboys. Tht: drop of Sterling against tht: dollar has made England m;>rt: accessible to foreign invest· ment, but the high labor costs and intlation that runs rampant in the English economy db· suade many potentioal investors from taking a risk on the l .K. (Remember John Dc:l.orean') 
The English often criticize the l nitcd States t(>r the American lack of "true" historical perspective; tht:y note that while the term "rc:ccnt trends in ti>rcign policy" may only date to the Kennedy years in America's view. the sam<: tt:rm in the English historical legacy may date back to the early 19th century. lfwc accept this notion as true, then the rapid disin­tegration of the British empire from 191-1 on­wards must be a truly traumatic event in the English consciousness. 
It is then undt:rstandable how an English­man could be bored with the l nitt:d ~tates. He st:es that the new fads in British youth fashion are "dressing American" -those old letter jackets in your closets will go t<>r about SH0­90 here in England. Watching T\' news on the BBC is little more than an update on what Howard Baker said in the St:nate yesterday. The British papers are tilled by storie~ whose bylines read Hollywood, "'ew York, Washing­ton and Chicago. There are always American televisio~ programs on British T\': J-R. Ewing is still a big deal in England. 
What does this all mean? Docs this havt: any rekvancc for the Lnited States? 
Perhaps something can be learned from the British pt:rspective of the L;nitt:d States. The British seem to view us as being uncultured and less intellectual when compared to the whole of the British nation. Americans arc violence-prone -here in England. muggings are front-page stories. Ah1ericans arc a nation of people who somehow stumbled into the world forefront followmg the British decline of World \\'ar II; a nation who arc now ruling an empire without the historical insight necessary t<>r leadership. without the con· .~tancy in its positions to bt: considered "reliable" and "unerratic" to its allit:s. Americ1 b the "child-king" who ascended to the throne of world leadership ht:f(>re 1t was mature, ami the last )0 vc:ar~ of world historY has proved the incon.stant nature of th;t leadership. 
Britain is bored by the I-~A. Britain, the t1r-.t "industrial" (and now t1rst "post·industnal") country, sees the L:nited States through tinted (if somewhat persuasive) lenst:s; a country in decline. criticizing a country at perhaps the height of world power. While we cannot be completely taken over by the Britbh argu· ments, we must realize that British nations were in a comparable position to the current CS postion less than half a century ago. The L:nited States, which recognizes its close and inherent tit:s with England as the "Mother Country." perhaps should give more notice to the British position and British words.

The voters. if they ~urvived the hla~t. might he pleased with the change. 
!\lew York has obvious advantages as the city where Armageddon could be staged. The Neu· York Times would notice if the Chrysler building and the World Trade Center came toppling down, tying up traftlc worse than the cabs at rush hour. The major television net-

works would have the camera crew~ at work, filming the George Washington Bridge drooping in the Hudson like overcooked spag­hetti. People magazine could get immediate interviews with 
celebrities like Shelly Winters and Truman Capote on "What I Was Doing When The World Blew Up," or "Love Among The Ruins."Late Night With David Letterman could upstage Six~v Minutes in inves­tigative reporting: "Is There Still Pizza After The Mushroom Cloud?" 
New Yorkers. l suspect, have been expecting the Big Bang !(>r some time. San franciscans live dangerously with the San Andreas fault, hut they don't really expect major earthquakes to happen. In New York, as a poet once said, "It's not so much a matter ofone damn thing after another as it is the same damn thing over and over again." On the nights when the lights go out, they play it cool. Nine months later. the census bureau finds out how they spent the time. for all New Yorkers know, the darkness may he midnight of the world's last night. Instead ofsleeping, they use the hours to insure they will have survivors. 
New Yorkers, if they knew the date, from following events in the Doomsday Book, would play it like a holiday. Ocean liners, going down, ask the orchestra to play "Nearer My God To Thee". New Yorkers, as members ofa pluralistic society, would probably choose "September Song" as their closing anthem. The Stock Exchange wouldn't open, but the Stage Deli would undoubtedly make fresh potato salad. The Rockettes, dancig for the last time at the Musi..: Hall, would m;ngle with the show-goers in the lobby, instead of disappearing backstage like cloistered nuns. The hookers on Eighth 
I Avenue would go to confession. Cardinal Cooke and Mayor Koch r! t would go together to Central Park and ride the carousel with thr children. 
F. A. 0. Schwarz's toy store would send buses to Spanish Harlem to bring ghetto kids to its open house. Steuben's would offer pastors their glass treasures as prizes for the parish bingo. The Metropolitan Museum would set up its masterpiece religious paintings along Fifth Avenue so that believers could visit them like stations of the cross. On the steps between the lions of the Public Library,John Gielgud would recite Prospero's speech as an exorcism to the horror: 
"You do look, my son, in a mov'd sort, As ifyou were dismay'd: he cheerful, sir. Our revels are now ended. These our actors, As I t<>retold you, were all spirits and Are melted into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolved. And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little lift: Is rounded with a sleep." All day long, from the Bronx to the Battery. the subways would 
run free. Muggers would put money into the pockets of the poor. Manhattanites, overt1owing the streets and parks, would be th(>ught­ful with one another, showing each other love instead of fear and fright, as a torm of mutual protection. 
At nightfall, !\lew Yorkers would gather in the places where they chose to wait for the bomb blast, with a million or so in Times Square. as on New Year's eve. The skyscraper bars and restaurants would he jammed. Evangelists preaching the <iospel would have a field day, haranguing pedestrians. Half the city would visit St. Patrick's on their knees. The largest number of all would go to the Statue of Liberty or Battery Park, to sing the "Battle Hymn," the na­tional anthem, "God Bless America", and "Auld LangSyne", as on the fourth ofJuly of the bicentennial year. Leonard Bernstein would he there to lead the Philarmonic in the Eroica, to remind the world of another sad day when President Kennedy was killed in Dallas. 
"Burst some eighty-five hundred feet above the Empire State Building a one-megaton bomb would gut or tlatten almost every building between Battery Park and !25th street .... The physical collapse of the city would certainly kill millions of people. The streets of New York are narrow ravines running between the high walls of the city's buildings. In a nuclear •mack. the walls would fall and the ravines would fill up. The people in the buildings would fall to the strert with the debris of the buildings, and the pe·Jple in the street would be crushed hy this avalanche .... Winds would reach -tOO miles an hour .. .in the meanwhile, the fireball would be growing ..." (Schell) 
This is the way the world ends, not with a whimper. Death, be not proud. God will not forgive us, ifwe let it happen.

The United States Olympic Committee's deci­
sion to reinstate banned American hurdler Renaldo Nehemiah has 
created a "serious situation" that has been called to the attention of 
the Olympic executive body, the president of the International 
Amateur Athletic federation said yesterday. "The USOC had no right 
to rule on Nehemiah in the first place," Primo Nebiolo said in a 
telephone interview. ''The eligibility of an athlete rests with his in­
ternational federation, and our rules say clearly that Nehemiah will 
not he allowed to compete in the Los Angeles Olympics (in I91:1-1 ). 
"The l"SOC has created a serious situation with its unbelievable 
decision, and we have called it to the attention of the International 
Olvmpic Committee. The case of a national Olympic body ignoring 
the Olympic rules becomes even more delicate when you are talking 
of the countrv that will host the next Olympics." Nebiolo said the 
IAAF was "making no threats, but we must hack our own rules and 
lav.s, tlrmly and responsibly, otherwise we will face chaos and 
anarchy." Nehemiah, the world record-holder in the IIO-meter high 
hurdles and owner of numerous world indoor bests in the high 
hurdles, signed a lucrative contract last year with the San Francisco 
-t9ers of the National Football League. He had applied to compete as 
an amateur in track again, and, after the recent USOC ruling, was 
entered in tonight's ,\1illrose Games at .'1-fadison Square Garden in 
~ew York. But his entry was withdrawn after the IAAF overturned 
the l SOC's ruling.

However, since their "Crush" title (which they won with an upset win over Georgia). the Bruin women have stalled in the midsection of the nation's Second Ten. 
"We've been up and down all season," admits t:CLA coach Billie :\toore. "The night before we blew out Arizona State. we could only beat Arizona hv one." Arizona had lost 30 consecutive games in the Western Collegiate Athletic Associa-

tion. the Bruin< conference. 
The team·~ erratic plav has com­pelled \loore to juggle the lineup in an attempt to find a consistent com­bination. 
The juggling act is done around one plaver. '\;ecie Thompson. who has heen the kevstone ofthe team all \Tar long. The junior center was the main reason that the Bruins man­handled the Irish as she poured in I H points and pulled down I-t hoards in their :'-Jo\Tmhcr encounter. She leads l CLA with I'; points and 12 rebounds per game. 
Thompson is not without a lot of help on the front line. however. as she is joined bv Debra Thurston and Jackie Joyner. 
Thurston. a junior, moved into a starting forward slot as a result of \lome's reshuftling. Combined witli classmate Joiner. she completes a line that can be deadlv on the boards. 
In fact, the large rebounding ad­vantage ( !9·3-) that they held over the Irish in the prior game proved quite damaging. 
"They're very strong on the boards," says Irish coach :\tary DiS­tanislao. "Their frontliners are jum­ping jacb. they beat you to positions." 
Before the western swing, DiS­tanislao and her staffwere reasonab­ly sure that the Irish rebounding game had progressed to the point where Mary Beth Schueth and Ruth Kaiser could be expected to play the national powers like UCLA even on the boards. Agood job on the hoards against :\taryland seemed to be an in­dication of this. However, last night's t1asco at Tempe (the Irish were outrebounded by 20) has to 
give Mary D. something to  think  
about.  
Freshman  speedster  Michelle  

:\tcCoy, who ran roughshod over the Irish in the first meeting, will abo give DiStanislao a lot to think about as she will be back to quarterback the t:CI.A offense. 
:\tcCov, who averages eight points 
, 

an outing. will he teamed with oft·. guard Ann Dean. Dean. a ';-I 0 fresh­man. b a zone-buster whose ~harp-,hooting is reminiscent of '\D's Laura Doughertv and Lynn Eb­ben. 
As the :'-Jovemher game indicated. the Bruins are not an easv target for :-.Jotre Dame's jump to the national scene. Their speed gave the much slower Irish tlh hack then and the story should he much the same on Sundav. Arizona State. a slower team than l CLA. burned :'-Jotre Dame with its speed last night. 
But it remains hard to t1gure the Irish. Against \1arvland, the third­ranked team in the nation and the on!\· major undefeated team. the Irish were t<)ugh oft· the hoards and had little trouble with a press. They also made earlv second-half runs against \larvland and Arizona State. onlv to lose their momentum and anv chance t(>r a win. 
Di~tanislao knows that, in order for ht·r team to have a chance against l'CLA. it is going to have-to neutralize the Bruin speed. The way to do this is to gain the rebounding advantage. eliminating a quick l'CI.A transition game. Some accurate shooting would also help. 
It seems that the closer to the top the Irish are, the farther away it seems. The l'CI.A game represents the latest attempt to get over that last obstacle.

very, very similar teams," she said. "l!Cl.A will press us for 40 minutes and will go man-to-man. And their guards are even quicker than Arizona State's. 
"I just don't want my team to get accustomed to losing (big games). Quickness is our problem, and we have to work to make ourselves quicker. So far we haven't done it."

of ideas coming from the coachs 
office, though. 
"It's to early to think about the 

future," Smith said. "I have other 
priorities that must come first." 
At the top of rhe lis£ is rhe playoff 

situation. The Irish must win their 
remaining games to be one of the 
eight CCHA reams involved in post­
sea<;On play. 
"I lhink that now. worse than ever 

we need to make the playoffs," said 
Smith. 
Smith's second concern is the dif­

ficult decision that many of the 
players will be forced to make. He 
wants to make sure that those 
players who want to transfer will be 
able to go to schools where they will 
both play hockey and get a com­
parable education. 
"After the season is over and the kids are taken care of, I'll sit down and think about me," Smith said. "Until then we have to concentrate on this sea~on." 
The team doesn't seem to be reacting as calmly as Smith is. Yester­day's practice became a release of emotion and a display of opinions rather than a solid work out session. 
The team began practice with a mock introduction of all the mem­bers over the PA system. Players were supposed to be transferring to places such as "Russia," the "unemployment lines," and "No­man's land." 
Each of the team members had a message, a pointed phrase spelled out in tape on his jersey usually directed at the athletic administra­tion. An example was one jersey that said. "Thanks ti>r the 52 million ­father." 
The jokes were one way ti>r the team to alleviate the realitv of Cor· rigan's annoncement. 
"It's reallv disappointing." junior Joe Bowie said. "'I reallv feel had for the sophomorl·~ and freshmen. I'd hate to be in their position."" 
Brent Chapman. is onc of those sophomores. 'Tvc been playing hockey since I was six." he said. "And now I feel like someone just cut my legs oft:" 
The disbelkfwas common among the younger players as many ofthem still believed that there was a chance of sa\·ing the program until Cor­rigan's announcement. 
"We all had glimmers of hope still shining in our· minds,'" said sgpho­more Sean Regan. "It still hasn't hit me and I don't know when it will." 
freshman Steve Bianchi was in shock. 
"It's so hard to believe," he said. "I really was optimistic because I wanted the program to continue here and then they just pull the plug like that." 
One of the captains of this years ·squad, :\1ark Doman. summed up the reaction in the locker room to the 
·news. 
"No one believes that they (the athletic administration) put their full effort into saving this program." Doman said. "Evervone feels 
. cheated, as if they weren't treated fairly." The team must learn how to handle all ofits emotions as there is a 
• log road to the end of the season. There are five more home games and an equal number to be played on the road. ''I'm looking forward to the rest of the season,"' Bowie said. "I think we are all pumped up for the end." The decision may provide strong motivation for the Irish. "I think it'll put a little fire in our _ eyes," Bianchi said. "We can only look better." For Chapman, i-t goes deeper than appearances. "We're not quitters," he stated. "Now its a matter ofpersonal pride." As captain John Higgins put it, "Everyone is a senior now." And everyone will be playing as if this is their last semester. their last perfor­mances at Notre Dame. The bitterness, the anger and the disappointment are understandable and acceptable. :vlost striking, however, is the sadness of players such as freshman :\1ark Benning. 
"You lose faith in the l'niversity," Benning said. "I really love this place and I'm really upset it all had to end this way." 
... Broncos

easy ti>r Notre Dame. 
"They may have lost, hut they were plaving the top four teams in the league," Smith said. "This is a critical series for them. too." 
Smith's primary concern is the Broncos sophomore goalie, Glenn Healy. who has a 6-I-t record and a -t. I 0 goals-against mark. 
·:Healy is a tine goaltender," Smith said. "I would go as far to say that he is the premier goalie in the league." 
Smith is confident though that the bright spots he saw in last weekend's series against ferris State will also sho\\; up tonight.

Sun Devils flame Irish women 

By CHRIS NEEDLES 
.\ports Editor 
TEMPE, Ariz. -In the world of women's basketball, it'~ usually been the smalL quick player~ -likt; \laney Lieberman and Ann \leyers -that have stood out most. 
That argument wa~ strengthened even mort· here yesterday. as Arizona State's Cassandra Lander 'ingk-handc.:dh· sp~rknl the '.un Dn·tl~-ranked '\;o. 1-1 in the nation 
-to an easv l-12-';-11ctorv o1 er :'l:otre Dame at the l n11 er~itv .-\c­ti\ ny Center. 
Lander is only ';-6 -small even in the womt·n·, game.: -.md she's a 'enior from h ans\ille. Ind. Yestt-r­day. she drove the Irish naL\ with 2·! points. I5 rebounds (remember. .,he's ';-6 ). six steab and four assists 

~ -;.ll team highs. In other words, she was eYerywhere. And t(>r the Irish. whose mo~t renowned and damag­ing weakness is its lack of footspeed. there was nothing they could do to stop her. "\X't· J.;new Lander was a great driver and offensin· rehounder." said \lotre Dame coach \larv Di'.­tanislao, whose team tell to 12-';. "Hut we thought we had a team defense that cmlld have handled her. \X'e had to plav good position defense that would shut off hn quickness, but we didn't do it. .. Things started olf had and got progressively worse for the Irish. Hd(>re they could even set up for their tlrst real possession. their t1rst real scoring opportunity, it was al· ready 11-0, thanks to a few ;\10 tur­novers and. according to DiStanislao, a loss of composure. "They're press wasn't awesome," she said. "Sure. Lander forced the turnover~. but if we had done.: what we wanted to do -that is. make Lander play two people instead of one -then they're pre~s wouldn't 
' 
have been effective." 
Despite the immediate 1!-point deficit. Notre Dame hung tou;.:h in the tlrst half de~pite being taken out of its ~lowdown, inside game plan. The Irish played the Devils evenly for the remainder of the half. hitting several long-range jumpers. and trailed by just 15. 59-26, at the.: inter­
mi~sion. 
Their momentum continued into 
the second half as the Irish. thanks to 
a coupll: of steals of their own. cut l 
the A"l atll·antage to 'even points 
with 16 minutes lett. But then it tell 
apart. 
The shots wouldn't fall 
just 55 percent in the 'econd hall­
and the.: turnon-rs piled up. and 
before you knew it. the.: Devib were.: 
back up bv l-. The Irish never 
recovered. 
"\X'hat makes me.: mad." said DiS­tanislao, "is that we don't get fired up until we're tn ing to avoid a .~0­point c.:mharra~sment. \\'e cut it 
from a I 5-point to a seven-pomt ddkit, and then rested and let it go 
to I~." 
In all, it was a depressing ex­perit:nce till· Di.'>t;mislao ami her ~tall, who, had high hopes of march­ing into the \alln· of the "un and pulling otl the upset. But mstead. .\lary D. saw ASl take her team total­ly out of it~ strategv. 
.\Iary Beth Schu,·th, ~otrc Danu··~ leading scorer and rdmundt·r. and a major l(>rce in,ide. had just two points and lil'l· reboumh (she an·rages 15 cmd 10, re.,pel'liiTII ). II it weren't tor sophomore Laura Doughertv's 1-points -l "i in the second half-and the '.un Dn il,· 25 !llrllO\Trs. Lord know' what the final margin would haH· been.

Irish at Pauley 
Notre Dame men seek revenge on UCLA· 
By RICH O'CONNOR 
Sports Wrilt>r 
For the ~econd consecutive week. a Notre Dame basketball team ac­customed to being on center stage may have to play ~econd fiddle. La~t week. the NFC championship game, where the \X'ashington Kedskins defeated the Dallas Cowboys, was being played at the.: same time as the \laryland game just nine mile~ away. Sunday, a~ the Irish take on l;Cl.A at Pauley Pavilion. the Super Bowl is just an hour down the freeway in Pasadena. ' 
It was just two months ago that :'l:otre Dame played host to the Hruins during "The Week." Facing 

,. 

their second real taste of maj•·-r col· legiate competition, an Irish squad that ~tartc.:d three fresh111an gave l CLA all it could ctsk t<>r, losing on a buaer linger roll by RalphJ;1cbon. 
The second game of what was billed a~ the Triple Crown of \lotre Dame basketball ( Kentuck1 •n" In­
diana also beat the.: lrbh th:11 Wt't·k) saw the Irish rallv from an eight point dc.:tkit early in the second half to l(>rce ties at -1-, ';I, '; -~-';';. and '; ~. but the lead eluded Notre D.tmc un­til a John Paxson jumper ga1-e the lrbh a 62-61 advantage with I :51 to play. 
With liCIA's Kenny Fields and Paxson both converting a pair of crucial one-and-ont·~. the Irish main­tained a (H-65 lead with just 2~ seconds left in the game. 
The Bruin., worked for the Ja.,t 
shot, and, after a timt·out. Jack,on 
took the.: hall to the hole for the Win­
ning shot. 
But revenge will not he the onlv motive.: for Coach Diggcr l'hdps 'quad. l'Cl.A b now the nation's top ranked te:~m, and :".otre Dame has a reputation 1!1r knocking ulf tile na­tion's hest Thl' Bruins l'nter their game again't ALthama tonight w1th a

"Its exciting to go out and plav a game again.,! the r-.:o. I t::am in the country." says Phelps. "The pressure is all on them. You can go out and heat them or gt·t blown out. hut its alway' a war." 
Two years ago, in a airplane h.tn­gar called tht· Rosemont llorizon, a group of seniors named Woolridge, Tripucka. and Jackson quarter· hacked hy a sophomore named Pax­son. along with ;1 center tandem of Andree and Kleine. were victorious ovn top-ranked \'irginia ';--';(,_ Ralph -.ampson was held to just ten points and nine rebounds. 
The kev to defeating l U.A, like Virginia in 19H I, is to shut down the big man underneath. The.: big man for l CIA is-2 "tuart (;ray Though uniniprcssive in December's con­test. (;ray has come on strong. The sophomore cc.:ntn is an:raging eight points and seven rebounds J game. 
"'.tuan <;ray holds the ke1 to l Cl..-\'s sucn·,s this year." ,a,·s Phelps. "I k had a tough night against us luck in lkcemhc.:r, but ill' has really come into h1s own since that lime beginning in thnr game with Loui,1·ille. When he pla1~ with !ntensity l CLA i~ awfulh· tough to heat."
