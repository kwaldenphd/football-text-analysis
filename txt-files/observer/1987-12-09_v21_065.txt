In Brief 
Airport security checkpoints have confiscated thousands of weapons over the years, but critics say the screening is uneven among airlines and airports, and FAA spot checks have shown weapons often may get through. A series of tests by the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that one out of five mock weapons escaped de­tection at screening checkpoints. During the series ofFAA tests, the agency found a wide range of accuracy in the screening programs. At one airport just over half the mock weapons passed through. Overall the detection rate ranged from 48 percent to 99 percent. -Associated Press

Food fight bill thrown about for a long pass 
Oh that food fight. 

Way back in September, a group of students 
threw food around and caused 1400 dollars 
worth of damage. Months passed, Tim Brown 
won the Reisman, Muffy started the women's 
basketball team off on the right foot, and the 
Student Senate completed something useful-­
the survey. 

During that time, the ominous $1400 bill some­how materialized in the hands of somebody and then everybody heard about it and nobody wanted to pay it, but everybody thought some­body else should. Then came the ultimate delay­-the bill was given to student government to take care of. 
The passing of the bill was like the old lateral kickoff return during a football game on the quad. I'm not sure who caught it first, but I think the jersey read "Class Officers." No Reis­man for those guys. They pitched it to the Hall Presidents Council. A couple of people on HPC thought it would be a good idea to try to advance the bill toward the "paid-in-full" endzone. They concocted a plan, but they needed help blocking from the class offices, student body govern­ment, and student senate. HPC called out the signals, but the senate tripped the HPC and the ball,bill was fumbled. Unfortunately, the senate recovered. 
In the meantime, the fans, especially the stu­dent body, saw the play developing. They began to boo the advances with full strength. The senators, those wild and crazy representatives of the student body, couldn't hear the boos over the din of their own thinking. They decided to call a timeout and make a plan. 
That's where we are now. The bill still hasn't been paid, and nobody knows if it will be paid. In fact, a lot of people don't know if it should be paid. I'd even go out on a limb and say that a few of the fans don't care if it is ever paid. The issue is dying, as the scoreboard clock ticks away. But the senate doesn't want it to die. Heck no. They can debate it right into overtime. 
The latest notion to pop out of that bastion of rational thinking is the idea that the money for the bill could be recovered by doing away with ice cream or dessert for awhile. I can just hear the fans singing the new version of our Alma Mater. Notre Dame Our Mother, has taken de ;ert 
away. 

Ashamedly in the dining halls, we endure a 
dessert-less day. 

Our ice-cream bowls are empty, 'the food fight' 
is their claim. 

Desserts are gone forever, at the senate's Notre 
Dame. 

The defense has virtually left the field. They figure that only ~he senate can stop the senate from performing well. The biggest obstacle for the senate is that they don't know which way to go. 

Should they carry the bill toward the "paid­in-full" endzone? If they do that, how do they get there? Using a no dessert formation is sure to generate ridicule from the student section in the stands. Ifthey try to advance out of a pro-set fund raiser formation, they may not get enough blocking from everyone to successively pull the play off. 
Maybe the senate could win if they simply put the baUbill back into Coach Goldrick's hands and said "Sorry, this play won't work. We have better things to tend to, like the Con­tingency Fund." Coach Goldrick could then dis­card the food fight plan, something the fans thought he should have done at the start. 
One thing is certain. Not even Arena Football provided as much fun as the food fight issue has. Maybe we could make Lou Holtz pay it. It was his fault we beat Michigan to begin with. Unfortunately, not even a crazy plan like that is good enough for the senate. 
Can the senate complete the play? I know they won't pass the ball, because there is almost nobody left to pass it to. Besides, the senate would never pass up a chance to make a moun­tain range out of a dirt speck. What I want to know is, if the bill is paid, does anybody win? Does anybody lose? Does anybody care? Be­sides the senate, of course. 
Maybe they will make a movie. "The Bad News Bears Go To Student Government." Com­edy. Tragedy. Both.

AIDS education is urged for physicians 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Per­sonal physicians need more competence in counseling patients afflicted with AIDS, and medical schools need to prepare their students better for that task, a top AIDS re­searcher said Tuesday. 
However, Dr. Michael Got­tlieb, the founding chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research and the first doctor to diagnose the disease, said he held little hope doctors would be able to overcome their prejudices, fears and lack of training to take on a greater role in curbing the spread of the fatal affliction. 
"I think the prognosis is poor," Gottlieb said at a news conference marking the end of an Indiana University sympo­sium on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
"Physicians are often in a po­sition to counsel such persons," Gottlieb added, "but usually they fail." 
AIDS, for which there is no known cure, attacks and destroys the body's immunity system. It is spread primarily through sexual contact and 
blood products. "There is a

tion that we can't rely on lab­oratory science alone and on technology alone to control this epidemic--that a behavioral response as well, and much ex­panded programs of public education, are essential," Got­tlieb said. 
Gottlieb, director of clinical research at Porton Medical Laboratories in Sherman Oaks, Calif., criticized the behavior of most physicians when they have diagnosed AIDS in a pa­tient. 
Most physicians have no for­mal training in human sexuality, he noted, and they avoid taking a patient's sexual history as part of his or her medical history. In addition, some physicians are prejudiced against homosexuals or are afraid to work with the AIDS virus. 
Andrew Mattison and Dr. David McWhirter, whose re­search on male homosexual couples was published in 1983 in the book, ''The Male Couple," said emotional reac­tions in AIDS patients range from increased spirituality to a desire to help other sufferers through videotaped interviews

no clemency for pilot 

Associated Press 
MOSCOW-The Soviet Union on Tuesday squelched rumors that daredevil pilot Mathias Rust would be out of prison and back home in West Germany for Christmas. 
Rust astounded the world and embarrassed the Soviets on May 28 by flying a single-engine Cessna plane from Helsinki, Finland, through the vaunted Soviet air defense system to Red Square, where he landed next to the Kremlin wall.

However, the INF treaty, as it is commonly called, requires both sides to scrap all missiles that can strike targets 300 to 3,400 miles from their launch sites. Because most such mis­siles are mobile and some resemble others outside the af­fected class, compliance with the treaty is difficult to ensure. 
Gorbachev called signing of the document ''the first step down the road leading to a nuclear-free world." The gen­eral secretary of the Soviet Communist Party described the agreement as the most stringently verified accord of its time. 
Reagan said, "We can only hope that this history-making agreement will not be an end in itself, but a beginning." 
''The importance of this treaty transcends numbers," Reagan said. "This agreement contains the most stringent verification" procedures in arms control history. 
Reagan, who opposed the never-ratified SALT II treaty on grounds that it was unverifi­able, insisted that any arms control treaty negotiated during his administration would have to contain provi­sions permitting on-site inspec­tion to check for cheating. The INF treaty does that. 
"This gets into details no other treaty contemplated," said one senior American offi­cial familiar with the negotia­tions in Geneva that brought the document into final form. "It not only permits challenge inspections, but it sets out just how you conduct one, how much time the other side has to get you to what you want to see, and so on." 
The official, speaking on con­dition he not be identified, said many of the provisions drafted for the INF treaty already are being used at the Geneva talks where negotiators are trying to work out a mueh more far­reaching accord that would halve the superpowers' strate­gic arsenals. 
''They're talking treaty lan­guage at START (the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks), and whole blocks of that language can be lifted from INF and ap­plied to START," the official said. 

The unauthorized flight led to a top-echelon shakeup in the Soviet military. 
The 19-year-old pilot, who said his flight was to ad­vance peace, has been in confinement since he landed. 
On Sept. 4, the Soviet Su­preme Court convicted him of illegal entry into the So­viet Union, violating inter­national air safety regula­tions and malicious hooliganism, and sentenced him to four years in a labor camp. 

2:30-5:30 pm 
WASHINGTON -The new treaty banning U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces has been dismissed by some as strategically insig­nificant, but officials say its detailed verification procedures already are being put in proposals for a wholesale cut in long-range missiles. 
The accord, whose final lan­guage wasn't agreed upon until hours before it was signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Tuesday, is described by those who worked on it as the most meticulous document of its kind ever negotiated.

Budget accord fails in lack of resolve 
Most of Washington this week is aflut­ter over General Secretary Gorbac­hev's summit visit to sign the historic INF accord, as well it should be. Yet while Gorbachev and Reagan exchange public relation blows, congressmen work furiously on the recently con­cluded budget reduction accord. Time is indeed of the essence, for unless the two-year, $76 billion dollar plan passes congress and becomes law, Gramm­Rudman's sequestration will rear its ugly head with $23 billion in automatic, across-the-board cuts for fiscal 1988. A failure to enact the plan could topple the world markets' already precarious position and spell disaster. According­ly, the content of the package becomes for the moment secondary, a sorry sit­uation indeed, for this budget deal fails miserably to signal a determined United States government bent upon fiscal responsibility. 
Matt Slaughter 
and another thing 
Even a superficial glance at the plan's particulars reveals a serious lack of resolve among its authors. $30 billion is to be saved in fiscal 1988, but at least a quarter of this comes from short-term gimmicks rather than true restraint: $5 billion from the sale of government rural electrification loans, $1.6 billion from "improved" IRS col­lection procedures, $1.2 billion from refiguring the interest on the national debt. Discount these accounting tech­nicalities and the package falls below Gramm-Rudman's required $23 billion in actual spending cuts. 
The problem as I see it is that Congress and the president recognize the detrimental effects sustained budget deficits incur, but they tie their hands before they even reach office with ridiculous campaign promises in pursuit of the almighty vote and cam­paign donation. Budget deficits in and of themselves need not be bad. Indeed, as Keynes described in theory in 1936 and Roosevelt proved in practice throughout the 1930s, government def­icit spending can stimulate the ag­gregate demand of the economy when no other sector is able, and thereby bring on recovery. Yet here we are in the 61st month of economic recovery, the longest peacetime expansion in his­tory, and are running federal deficits pushing 5 percent of GNP, up from 2.2 
percent in 1980 when Reagan became president-elect. Sustained deficits of this magnitude in times of prosperity seem unnecessary and dangerous. Economically, deficits requiring gov­ernment borrowing of some $150 billion annually crowd out private borrowing for investment, and they constrain the latitude of fiscal policy as an economic tool. And psychologically, the sheer size of them helps place the international economic community on edge, as the recent worldwide market crash can at­test. 
Given this consensus among nearly all in Washington that the current fiscal excesses must be reigned in, these policymakers often find there is little they can do, given the ridiculous cam­paign promises they prophesy. An un­fortunate constitutional oversight of our founding fathers dictates that all revenue raising and appropriating bills must originate in the House of Repre­sentatives, while these same represen­tatives all must come up for reelection every two years. A representative, it would seem, could find himself continu­ally campaigning while intermittently legislating. The president and the Sen­ate, the other two nearly important legs in the fiscal policy trinity, often suffer the same fate. Without fail, the air around election time fills with a cacop­hony of outrageous promises, resulting in policy-making giving way to pork barreling. In 1984, Walter Mondale was enough of a realist to state he would raise taxes; Ronald Reagan vowed never to commit such a mortal sin. And surprise, Reagan won in the biggest electoral landslide in history. Part of the blame lies with us the public for exacting from our leaders such silly campaign vows to appease ourselves; but more so with our elected officials who so consciously restrict their ability to govern. 
What is needed is an honest assess­ment of the situation and a disinter­ested look at possible remedies. The current fiscal irresponsibility must end, and its end will not be without pain. What combination of outlay restraints and revenue enhancers will best redirect our government and the eco­nomy I, a college sophomore, have no idea; let the economists haggle over this. But let the rest of us help them by scrutinizing every facet of the budget, leaving no "sacred cows." 
To argue that in the defense budget, the largest component of the overall

budget at nearly $300 billion, there exists no room for fiscal austerity is folly. Billions could probably be cut here, while simultaneously even bolstering our nation's defenses in in­troducing more efficiency. A 190-pound sidewinder missile costs the Pentagon some $50,000, or more than $250 per pound. The average car figures out to about $4 per pound. We still maintain over 300 foreign bases, and singlehan­dedly pay for the majority of our NATO alliP.!':. Why not require thP.ir economic parity with the U.S. be matched with parity in terms of providing the West's defense? 
"The international economic community, of which the United States is more and more an integral part, has demanded decisive action of us and we have failed them." 
Similarly, to declare all safety net programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and food stamps untouch­able does little but breed waste and excess. By no means should fiscal aus­terity come at the expense of the truly needy; indeed, government help for them should be increased whenever possible. But why not examine these various programs to see if any potential savings exist; such a move is in no way analogous with eliminating Social Se-curity cost of living increases, etc. Already strained Social Security, for example, may break in the coming decades as the baby boomers retire and fewer workers will exist to pay into their deserved benefits. Why not care­fully study if some fundamental restructuring of the program can both meet the looming problems and do it cost efficiently? 


And finally, to declare "I will never raise taxes" as George Bush does today is simply not rational. Does he truly believe that between now and 1992 the current tax system may not need ex­panding? Given the aforementioned trend of growing government spending, such a claim is ludicrous. Taxes could be shifted to place a larger burden on consumer spending (e.g. increase ex­cise taxes or develop a value-added sales tax), thereby also easing the other ~win deficit, the trade deficit. 
These above suggestions do not re­quire a doctorate in economics to rec­ognize their plausibility, just a good dose of levelheaded common sense free of rhetoric. Unfortunately, they all must first await passage of the budget accord. This package, weak though it is, must become law to calm the jittery markets and governments around the world. The international economic community, of which the United States is more and more an integral part, has demanded decisive action of us and we have failed them. Everyone will sur­vive this defeat, but next time we may not be as lucky.

'You've Got a Friend' with Big Brothers/Sisters 
HEIDI SCHLUMPf accent writer 
M 
ost college students spend their Saturday afternoons recovering from Friday night, watching football, or maybe even studying. But Jennifer Diem spends most of her Sat­urday afternoons with Myrenda Chism, an eleven-year-old girl from South Bend. 
"We go bowling, Ice skating, miniature golfing, to the movies," said Diem, a senior RAIn Farley. "Once we even went strawberry picking." 
Diem and Chism are "sisters" matched by Big BrotherSIBig Sisters, a social service pro­gram that tries to address the needs of single parents by pro­viding adult friends for their children. 
"Friendship Is Important," said Diem, "That's the biggest thing. You need time to share and a little creativity. Flexibility Is also key." 
One of every five American families Is headed by a single parent. In fact, the number of single parent families has risen 80% In the past ten years. The children of those families often need guidance from adult friends to "make up" for the loss of a parent In their lives. 
Big BrotherSIBig Sisters of America matches children of single parent families with adult volunteers who provide companionship. Forty students from the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community have Little Brothers or Sisters, according to Scott Smith, president of Big BrotherSIBig Sisters of ND-SMC. Another 40 students have ap­plied for matches. 
Big BrotherSIBig Sisters of ND-SMC funds various activities for matches. This year's activi­ties Include a bowling night, a. movie night, a Christmas party, and maybe a trip to Chicago. "We try to provide interesting and novel things to do for matches," said Diem. 
Since the Chlsms do not have a phone, Diem usually contacts Myrenda's mother at her job to make arrangements for their outings. "Myrenda's mom works two jobs and often Isn't home when I go to pick her up." Diem said. 
Myrenda lives in a small, two story house on the southeast side of South Bend. She and her twin brother, Myron, usually watch television after school and on the weekends. The house smells like gasoline from a space heater next to the TV set. 
"We always do fun things," says Myrenda. She Is a cute little girl, with two braided pig­tails and a smile always on her face. She can be shy, but Is ususally energetic. Big Brot­herSIBig Sisters matches the children with adults based on Interests, backgrounds, per­sonalities and general compatl­
blllty. The match may take a few months because Big Brot­herSIBig Sisters screens and evaluates the children and the volunteers. A caseworker su­pervises the match, providing guidelines and making sure that the child's needs are met by the developing friendship. 
Diem learned about the pro­gram from girls in her dorm who were Big Sisters and volunteered at the end of her freshman year. "I saw It as a need in the community that could be filled by Notre Dame students," she said. She was matched at the beginning of her sophomore year and she and Myrenda have been "sisters" ever since. 
The Big BrotherSIBig Sisters program stresses a one-on­one, same-sex relationship. They do not have "cross­matches" (that Is, Big Sister with Little Brother). Myrenda's twin, Myron, is matched with one of Jennifer's friends. Jen­nifer says that the time she spends alone with Myrenda Is the most Important, but some­times she will plan an activity, usually miniature golf, with Myron and his Big Brother. "The boys usually win," says Diem, "but not by much." 
"The Big BrotherSIBig Sisters program does not replace a parent In any way," Jennifer said. "We are role models and friends, but not authority fig­ures. It's Important to be a 

Cowboy Church holds services in a barn 
I 
nside a livestock sales barn 
near Hermiston, Oregon, a 
young preacher in blue jeans, 
cowboy hat and cowboy boots 
greets visitors to the come-as­
you-are Cowboy Church, the 
second of Its kind in the United 
States. "This doesn't look like 
the House of God, but the 
overhead Is low," the Rev. John 
Wambeke says as his hour-long 
service begins. 
The Northwestern Livestock Commission's auction barn along Interstate 84 was picked because It would be a comfort­able place for the kind of people Wambeke Is trying to attract. While all are welcome, the church seems to attract Western-minded types --people who like horses. 
"There's a Jot of people who haven't been in a church for years and years because they feel uncomfortable; they have to dress up," Wambeke said. "A lot of cowboys wouldn't ever go unless they're getting married or buried." 
Wambeke, 25, was raised on a I0, 000-acre cattle ranch south of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada. He's lived in this country since 1984, and recently moved to Hermiston to look after the family cattle operations associated with Ron Baker's feedlot and new Jean-beef packing plant. 
Wambeke was raised a Cath­olic and had never intended to be a pastor, but while living In Fort Worth, Texas, he became Involved in the original Cowboy 
Church there. With rodeo cow­boy Jeff Copenhaver as pastor, services are held In an Indoor bull-riding arena in one of Texas' king-size bars. 
"I just went down to Fort Worth because I knew Jeff and wanted to go to an agriculture school. But I got more and more involved. I had never gone to a church I had felt more at ease (at) and grown more as a Christian." As for becoming a cowboy pastor, "It was my desire, and he worked with me." 
Other than the business In­terests of his family, Wambeke had no special reason for wan­ting to live In Hermiston, but It was suggested that Hermiston was a good central location for a cowboy outreach In the Pendleton, Ore/ Tri-Citles, Wash. area. All things consid­ered, it seemed a natural place to start the nation's second Cowboy Church; and Wambeke has found he enjoys living here. 
As the service begins, Wam­beke thumbs a well-worn Bible. His wife, Jordawn, stands on the dirt floor of the sales arena, preparing to project onto the wall the words to "Whispering Hope." Strumming guitars, Wambeke and fellow canadian Shawn Wells sing traditional hymns with a country flavor. 
Wambeke's service is non­denominational, and he speaks on this Sunday of a "no­nonsense kind of Christianity," in which you don't have to be in a cathedral to talk to God, nor do you have to pick a num­ber to have a chat. "You can catch him anytime," Wambeke says. 
Wambeke, who became a cowboy preacher in September, says he's beginning to get the hang of it. "You can't just go up to somebody and blast them. They have to see some­thing else, another example. There is a tremendous amount of pride and independence among Western people, and that holds cowboys back from reaching out to God. Cowboy Church challenges you, but you're free to be who you are." 
Wambeke has been married about three years to Jordawn, from Toronto, who is expecting their second child early next year. During the service, she shepherds the children off to the Buckaroo Club, held in an adjoining room. 
The Sunday service has been drawing 25 to 30 people each week. The Wambekes also have fellowship meetings at their home two days a week. 


good role model and expose 
them to things they wouldn't ordinarily be exposed to." 
Myrenda has decided she wants to attend Notre Dame and room with her best friend from Girl Scouts when she grows up. "''m proud of her aspirations," Jennifer said, "I hope she sticks with her dreams." 
Chism and Diem celebrated the two-year anniversary of their match on Oct. 4 this year. "Our relationship has really developed Into a friendship," said Diem. "I also think Myrenda has grown up a lot In the past two years. 

"It's been very worthwhile," she adds. "I've gamed a lot of Insight Into the life of an eleven-year-old girl but mostly I've made a friend." 
Since Diem Is from South Bend, she expects to stay In contact with Myrenda even If she moves away after gradua­tion. Lifelong friendships be­tween matches are not unus­ual. 
If you have a few hours a week to share with a child, contact president Scott Smith at 283-1164 or vice-president Jennifer Diem at 283-4248.

Wednesday night at 9:30 the Student Union Board Is presenting another Nightclub Night. After the success of magician Bob Garner on November I4, Wednesday's show will feature three of the circuit's brightest rising comedians: maglcocomedlan Will Diedrich, 'Big' Brian Hol­lingsworth and local funny man Steven Kimbrough. 
Headliner, Kimbrough, performs his trade three or four times a week. making regular stops at Chicago clubs. Born in Chicago, but raised In South Bend, he currently manages comics for the Center Street Blues Cafe. "Being raised In the ar~, I like being involved with various facets of com­edy around here," Kimbrough said in a recent Interview. 
In addition to his work at local clubs, Kimbrough plays various private party engage­

ments and charity functions, 
and joins ZIP I 04's Bobby 
Rivers on the air Tuesday 
mornings between 8 and 9. 
He also has been opening 
for national acts such as 
Sam Kinlson and Kenny G. 
Kimbrough Is no stranger 

to the college scene either, 
having done shows at Saint 
Mary's, I.U.S.B. and an 
opening bit for the AT&T 
Record-a-Tune event at the 
Senior Alumni Club last 
month. 
While telling us about the show, Steven had a few words about the credentials of his Wednesday night cohorts. "The emcee for the night, Will Diedrich, has done a lot of college work. He's 25 and still hasn't graduated. The feature act, Brian Hollingsworth, Is big. So big, In fact, that he's had some problems with a few of his performances -people keep throwing harpoons up on stage." 
All kidding aside, Kimbrough confided, "I like to use my humor to make people feel good." Not a bad sentiment especially around finals time.

Oklahoma vs. Miami for No. 1 


Orange 
Associated Press 
Oklahoma is ranked No. 1 and Miami is No. 2 but not everyone is convinced that their Orange Bowl clash, the 23rd such game in the 52-year history of the Associated Press poll, will decide college foot­ball's national championship. 
Syracuse University Coach Dick MacPherson is among the dissenters. 
Only two teams have a shot at going 12-0--the Oklahoma­Miami winner and fourth­ranked Syracuse, which meets No. 6 Auburn, 9-1-1, in the Sugar Bowl. Third-ranked Florida State, 10-1 with a 26-25 loss to Miami the only blemish on its record, plays No. 5 Ne­braska, 10-1, in the Fiesta Bowl. 
"Oklahoma and Miami are playing a good opponent (each other), and so are we," Mac­Pherson said. "Any team that wins the Southeastern Confer­ence is a good opponent."

Miami completed its second consecutive 11-0 regular season by defeating South Carolina 20­16 Saturday night. Oklahoma, which finished 11-0 two weeks earlier, received 47 of 57 first­place votes and 1,129 of a pos­sible 1,140 points in Tuesday's final regular-season AP poll. 
Nine first-place votes and 1,088 points went to Miami, while Florida State remained third with 1,018 points. The other first-place ballot went to Syracuse, which received 955 points. 
Nebraska held onto fifth place with 926 points and Auburn remained No.6 with 847 points. 
MacPherson concedes there's nothing he can do about the Orange Bowl matchup and all the attendant hype--past, present and future. 
"If one of them is a dominat­ing factor, they deserve to be No.1," he said. "We'rethenext best game. The voters can see one game (Fiesta Bowl) at 1:30 (p.m., EST), one game (Sugar) at 3:30 and one game (Orange) at 8 and see who deserves to be No. 1." 
LSU, 9-1-1, stayed seventh with 794 points. South Carolina, LSU's Gator Bowl opponent, was the only other member of the Top Twenty in action over the weekend and their close loss to Miami dropped the Gamecocks, 8-3, from eighth place to ninth with 653 points. 
Michigan State, 8-2-1, moved up from ninth to eighth with 687 points and UCLA, 9-2, com­pleted the Top Ten, just like a week ago, with 642 points.

But once again, the Belles were unable to keep up with the competition's shooting ability in the second half as Michigan took the eight-point victory. 
Julie Radke led the Saint Mary's scoring with 22 followed by Linda Garrett who had 10 points. 
"We simply need to learn to adjust without our floor leader and take control with more con­sistent play in our overall per­formance." said Wood.

ball in the basket. The Terriers made only 34 percent of their shots from the field for the game, with Irving, who had been averaging 22 points a game, leading the slump with 3-of-12 shooting. 
Meanwhile, the Irish were able to correct their shooting problems in the second half. After making 35 percent of their field goals in the first half, the Irish responded with a 54 percent total in the second half. 
Once again Rivers led all scorers with 19 points, includ­ing 8-of-9 shooting from the charity stripe. Voce added 16 points and nine rebounds in just 23 minutes of play, and Robin­son collected 12 of his 16 rebounds in the first half. 
The rebounds hid Robinson's 3-of-10 shooting performance, with many of the misses com­ing on short jumpers and layups. 
"He needs to get into an of­fensive flow where he can read first, then shoot," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps of Robinson. "He's got ability to score, but it's a little different than high school where you can just turn and shoot it. 
"But 16 rebounds is a lot of rebounds, and that's good for him," Phelps added. 
The game opened with slam dunks by each team, but the first true field goal wasn't scored until Boston guard Jeff Timberlake hit a short jumper with 13: 57 remaining in the half. 
The Terriers held the lead early on when Jones was left all alone after the opening tip, re­sulting in an opening slam. The senior forward ended up leading the Terriers with 14 points and eight rebounds, just two boards shy of his third con­secutive double-double. 
Stevenson responded with a slam of his own off a fast break started by Rivers. But two free throws by Jones and Timber­lake's field goal gave the Ter­riers an early 6-2 lead. 
A  three-pointer  by  Rivers  
and  a  jumper by  Stevenson,  
who  also  finished  in  double  

figues with 10, gave Notre Dame a lead which it would never relinquish. The Irish out­scored the Terriers 33-11 to make the score 33-20 Irish before Boston closed the gap to nine at the half. 
Forward Steve Nicgorski woke up the JACC crowd when he entered the game with 2:43 to play. With birthday-boy Sean Connor trying to feed the senior walk-on almost every time down the court, Nicgorski fi­nally made it to the charity stripe on a shooting foul. The students stood with one out­stretched arm as Nicgorski made both of his "offerings."

Morrissey, Stanford open lnterhall hockey with wins 
By CHRIS PAULISON Sports Writer 
With the first round games complete, the quest for the In­terhall hockey crown is now un­derway. 
Grace, Morrissey, and St.Ed1Ioly Cross skated to vic­tories in the first round, ear­ning spots atop the league's Gold division. In the league's Blue division, victors Stanford, Sorin, and Alumni iced a three­citement early in the second half as they closed the gap to 5-2. However, Morrissey team captain Tim O'Brien and cen­ter Tim Hartigan provided sparks with two goals apiece and the victory was sealed. "We looked decent, consider­ing this was our first time out as a team," said Chris Hasbrook, who also scored a goal for the Manorites. "WP still need to work on fundamen­tals if we're to beat the better 
Captain Galis gave credit to his sophomore goaltender, Gary Davis. "Simply put, Davis is the key to our season. If he continues to play as well as he did tonight, this Grace team should prove to be very successful." 
Grace's success was put to the test again last night as they faced off with Morrissey. 
Stanford's 7-0 drubbing of Fisher represented the first Tankersley, tended the twines with perfection. 

By defeating Zahm 6-3, Sorin became victorious for the first time in over two seasons. Otter team captain, defenseman Matt Beuerlein, explained what this victory meant for his team. 
"This year's team is com­prised of an improving group of upperclassmen. We have been playing together for a few seasons now, and I think this is the year we make a name for ourselves." 
In other first round action, St.Ed1Ioly Cross skated past Flanner 4-2. Alumni downed Pangborn, 4-1, in the first clash for both teams. 
Dillon and Cavanaugh remained idle through first­round play. Both of these teams must wait until after Christmas break to make their season debuts on the ice.

Irish pound boards and Terriers, 74-49 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
While the shooting was ice­cold, the Irish heated up the boards on the way to an easy 74-49 over Boston University Tuesday night at the JACC. 
Notre Dame out-rebounded the Terriers 50-26, with sopho­more forward Keith Robinson collecting a game-high 16 of those plentiful missed shots. 
"To be honest with you," said Boston head coach Mike Jarvis, "the game was probably decided in the first two or three possessions down the court when Notre Dame got the rebounds. They wanted the ball, and they got the ball." 
The 19th-ranked Irish im­proved to 2-1 on the season, while the ECAC North Atlantic team Boston fell to 3-2. 
Holding a 33-24 lead at half, the Irish used a 23-6 run to pull away from the Terriers for good. After forward Mark Stevenson opened the half with a jumper from the key, six dif­ferent Notre Dame players scored. 


Jackson hit from the baseline after a reverse feed from for­ward Gary Voce. After Boston forward Larry Jones went over Voce for two, lhe senior co­captain connected on a three­point play when Jones fouled him on a turnaround jumper. 
Guard David Rivers hit a long jumper, Robinson put in a layup off an inbounds play and Stevenson hit a baseline jumper before Terrier guard Drederick Irving scored, making the score 46-28 for the Irish. Irish center Scott Pad­dock completed the round­robin scoring with a tip in of a missed layup by Rivers. 
The run was further helped by Boston's inability to put the

Women return against Pioneers 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 
Although the women's bas­ketball team dropped its first game of the season in the Phoenix Classic last weekend, head coach Muffet McGraw says the squad will show marked improvement tonight against Oakland. 
The Irish lost to Wisconsin­Green Bay, 69-65, before downing Brigham Young in the consolation game, 81-69. McGraw saw the loss as a building block for the remainder of the season. 

"They know what they have to do now," she said of the 3-1 Irish. "They went out expect­ing to win without doing the work. Then, we played well against BYU." 
The Irish must be in the right frame of mind when the Pioneers invade the Joyce ACC at 7:30 p.m. Oakland is cur­rently a perfect 7-0 with all of those victories by margins of more than 20 points, including a romp over Michigan, 92-70. McGraw realizes the Irish must control the Pioneer of­fense in order to stay in the game. 
"We have to play good defense to beat them," she said. "They haven't been in a close game all year. They average in the 70's, so if we can hold them in the 50's, we'll have a chance." 
Notre Dame enters the game with a distinct height advan­tage over Oakland. The tallest Pioneer player stands 6'0" compared with center Sandy Botham at 6'2" and forwards Heidi Bunek at 6'4" and Diondra Toney at 5'9" for the Irish. McGraw will try to ex­ploit Oakland's inside game, and this chance couldn't have come at a better time. 
Botham had a season-high 20 points against Wisconsin­Green Bay and added 16 more in the win over Brigham Young while being named to the all­tourney squad. Bunek contrib­uted 28 points and Toney tossed in 19. In short, McGraw thinks the Irish frontline can be the difference in the game. 
"We'll be trying to get the ball inside," McGraw said. "We could do a better job rebounding inside, but I think we're doing a pretty good job overall." 
McGraw will start senior Mary Gavin and freshman Karen Robinson at the guard spots. Gavin averages 6.7 points per game and needs only 17 points to pass Laura Dqug­herty as Notre Dame's No.2 career scorer. Robinson comes in averaging 10.5 points, includ­ing a team-high 20 against Brigham Young. Annie Schwartz continues to give the Irish depth off the bench, averaging 9.2 points. 
McGraw has no plans to prepare differently for the Oak­land game despite the setback at Green Bay. 
"They're a lot like Wisconsin-Green Bay," she said. "They're aggressive, play man-to-man defense, and go to the basket well." 

Wrestlers earn spot in top 20 for first time in Irish history 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
For the first time during a season in its 32-year history as a varsity sport, the Notre Dame wrestling team has reached the Top 20. 
The Irish are ranked 16th in the latest issue of Amateur Wrestling News, but Notre Dame head coach Fran McCann is not about to start celebrating. 

"I think it's a little prema­ture," said McCann. "It's nice to have, but we haven't proven ourselves yet." 
The ranking comes in the wake of Notre Dame's impres­sive performance in the St. Louis Open two weeks ago, where team scores were not kept. The poll was completed before last weekend's Las Vegas Invitational, where the Irish placed tenth in a compe­tition that included 13 other Top 20 teams. 
"We have a chance to move up a spot after Vegas," said McCann. 
Notre Dame won the Mic­higan State Invitational in its only other event of the year so far. Its dual meet schedule does not begin until tomorrow's match at Miami of Ohio, and McCann believes his squad is better in tournaments than in dual meets. 
"I would say as a tournament team, we're a Top 20 team, but as a dual meet team, maybe not," said McCann. "We don't have the balance, and we still have some holes to fill. But we do have some great individ­uals." 
But the ranking does repre­sent a big change from last year, when only two startin~ wrestlers survived the season without injury, and the Irish limped to a 1-11 record. 
Amateur Wrestling News had Notre Dame in its Top 20 poll one other time, ranked 18th in the 1978-79 preseason poll. That year, Irish heavyweight Bob Golic was coming off a 1978 season where he placed third in the nation. 
Golic, who was also a Notre Dame football player and cur­rently is a member of the Cleveland Browns, did not wrestle in 1979. Consequently, the Irish never appeared in the Top 20 during the actual season and did not return to the rankings until now. 



Countdown: The Top 10 of 1987 
As 1987 draws to a close, all seems well under the shadow of the Dome. 
The Heisman Trophy is where it belongs -in the hands of Tim Brown. David Rivers has a ready cast to work with as the Irish make another run at the NCAA Tournament. The wrestling team is ranked 16th in the nation, the fencing teams are undefeated and the swimming and women's basketball teams are off to strong starts. All this while

Notre Dame students recover from Christmas SYRs, prep for final exams and anticipate New Year's Day in Dallas. 
Just as students count down the ten days remaining before the semester break, here's my countdown of the top ten Notre Dame sports stories of 1987. 
One, as in the number-one player in the country. To say that Tim Brown provided Irish fans with exciting moments this fall is modest. The senior flanker literally did it all for Notre Dame, receiving, returning and running his way to become the school's seventh Heisman Trophy winner on Saturday. His two consecutive punt returns for touch­downs in the home opener will be noted as one of the greatest two-minute spans in Irish football history. 
Two, as in the margin of victory in Notre Dame's 60-58 upset of top-ranked North Carolina at the ACC last February. "Nobody leaves Notre Dame number one," said Digger Phelps and Rivers, Gary Voce and Company proved it again. A true Notre Dame Moment, one that will always bring back thoughts of flying yellow placards. Per­haps the Notre Dame student body should have been charged with the cost of replacing Phelps' split suitcoat. 
Three, as in three-time All-American fencer Molly Sul­livan, who led the Notre Dame women's fencing team to the first-ever national championship for a Notre Dame women's varsity program. Sullivan, then the defending national champion and now Irish team captain in her senior year, placed third in the individual competition held here at Notre Dame last March. Four, as in four times the Notre Dame football team has appeared in the Cotton Bowl. The Irish will return there on the first day of 1988 after posting an 8-3 record against what many agree was the nation's most difficult schedule. Lou Holtz' Pony Ex­press ran past and over most opponents to keep national championship hopes alive before losses to Penn State and Miami in the last two weeks of the season. 
Five, as in five players on a basketball team. The Notre Dame basketball team finished its 1986-87 campaign with a 24-8 record and reached the NCAA Tournament "Sweet Sixteen'' before falling to North Carolina. Irish floor gen­eral David Rivers was named Comeback Player of the
