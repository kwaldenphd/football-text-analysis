Final three election tickets approved 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 

The remaining three tick­ets in the student body pres­ident/vice president elec­tions have received approval of their petitions to run. The tickets of Mark Healy and Mike Healy, Adam Istvan and Karla Bell, and Ryan Craft and Steve Lynch were notified last Tuesday of their approval for the race. 
In order to be approved, petitions are first verified by Judicial Council president Elliot Poindexter. Petitions 
· are then sent to the Office of Student Affairs and to the Registrar. The candidates must be in good standing with each office. _ Petitions were due Jan. 23, but three tickets were turned in well before the deadline. The Charlie Ebersol-James Leito ticket, which the candidates turned in on Jan. 19, was approved Jan. 20, said Director of Student Activities Brian Coughlin. The three other tickets, however, were not approved until Jan. 27. Student body presidential candidate Mark Healy said he turned in his petition on Jan. 20 but was not notified of its approval until Jan. 27. He said he was unaware of 
any problems with either 
the Office of Student Affairs 
or the Registrar. 
"I was not notified of any 
problems," Mark Healy said. 
"I went almost every day 
that the Student 
Government was open to 
meet with Elliot Poindexter 
to see if my petition had 
been approved, and he said 
that it wasn't." 
Mark Healy said he felt the 
length of time it took to get 
the final three petitions 
approved needed to be 
explained. 
"I think that it's something 
that needs to be looked 
into," he said. "It seems 
peculiar that it would take 
so long for the rest of us to 
be approved, when it didn't 
take that long for the first 
ticket to be approved." 
The Istvan-Bell petition 
was turned in on Jan. 21, 
Istvan said, and Craft said 
he turned in his petition on 
Jan. 23. Neither candidate 
said they were notified of 
any problems in approving 
their petitions. 
"It's taking forever to go 
through the approval 
process, trying to get every­
thing in," Istvan said.

Students seek off-campus housing 
By NICOLE ZOOK News Writer 
Many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students have already signed their leases for off-campus housing next year, said managers oflocal apartment complexes. 
Officials representing tradition­ally popular off-campus options confirmed that leasing is pro­ceedingly strongly for 2004-05. Tammy Michaelbrink. the proper­ty manager at Turtle Creek, said many students have chosen to renew their leases from this year, wbile the number of new renters is about the saine as in previous years. 
"[Students] like it here, and we love to have them," Michaelbrink said. "Pretty much all of the renters here are students, besides the staff. I live here, and we have on-site maintenance and two security officers." 
Turtle Creek -drawing 95 percent of its renters from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students -maintains a flexible system and is still taking applications for next year, Michaelbrink said. attracts many students, sales

White, Moran win SMC elections 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD Saint Mary's Editor 
Sarah Catherine White and Mary Pauline Moran were elected as Saint Mary's 2004­05 student body president and vice president Friday. White and Moran will take office April 1. 
The ticket received 58 per­cent of total votes Thursday, beating out Sarah Brown and Michelle Fitzgerald, whose ticket received 38 percent of votes. Four percent accounted for abstentions in an election where 50 percent of the stu­dent body voted, a turnout considered successful by elec­tion officials. 
"I am extremely pleased with the student body's involvement in this election," said elections commissioner Nicole Haeberle. "Fifty per­cent of the campus voting is well above national averages for colleges and shows that all of the candidates captivated the attention of Saint Mary's women." 
Haeberle added that this year's election exemplified the strides made by Saint Mary's student government in recent years.. Most notably, this elec­tion marked the first time in three years that more than one ticket ran for the student body presidency. In addition to White-Moran and Brown­Fitzgerald, Shay Jolly and Veronica Saabedra rounded out a group of candidates going into the primary elec-

per apartment," she said. 
Notre Dame junior Kathryn Wendel said the mixed atmos­phere of students and older resi­

tion, Haeberle said. 

Both White and Moran agreed, citing a respectful election with tough competi­tion. 
"It's an honor," White said. "We're delighted and thrilled to see that so much of the stu­dent body supports us. It's exciting to see the school take interest in student government through the election." 
"It really revitalized things on campus for people to know that they have a choice," Moran said of the competing candidates. 
Before taking office, White and Moran will shadow cur­rent student body president Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl to better understand what their roles will include. The shad­owing process will consist of attending both administrative and student government meet­ings and evaluating the lead­ership demonstrated by past administrations. 
The ticket said that their first priority upon taking office is to welcome new College president Carol Ann Mooney on behalf of the stu­

Love and Hallmark 
The countdown has begun. 

As calendars flipped to February this weekend, moans of absolute agony and squeals of delight were heard echoing off of dorms and Domes alike. 
Saccharinely­

sweet red and. Amanda Michaels silver heart deco­rations have appeared in the Production most unpre­Editor dictable of locales, including the walls of South Dining Hall-and never has 24-hour fruit salad been more roman­tic. 
Sinatra is stuck solidly on repeat as couples gear up for candlelight dinners and moonlit walks, and singletons simultaneously loathe and revel in their solitude. 
The ultimate Hallmark holiday is within sight. 
That's right: Looming just beyond Groundhog Day and nestled snugly between Washington and lincoln's birthdays is Valentine's Day. Feb. 14­the holiday said to honor the patron saint of lovers, when candy, flowers and kisses are exchanged by the tons and the suicide rate rivals that of Christmas. 
In Roman times, before St. Valentine was celebrated in its place, Lupercalia was the major mid-February holiday. During the celebration, the names of Roman girls were written on slips of paper and placed into jars, and each young man would draw a name in a kind of "love lottery." The two would then be partners for the duration of the festival, and many times they would go on to marry. 
In the light of modern thought, though, this impersonal matching sys­tem may seem like the ultimate in bad blind dates to many and a mockery of the freedom of true love. To those peo­ple, may I present ... the Notre Dame dating scene. 
True couples aside, as they are clear­ly the minority on campus, dating at Notre Dame seems to consist of drink­ing, dancing, debauchery and dumping -all in the same night. From my experience, dorm parties are like little Lonely Hearts clubs for students look­ing for a quick make-out session. Given, there are many of those who go just to have fun, but they are quickly siphoned off as the music grows louder and the room steamier. 
With such an appealing alternative to the single life -who wouldn't want to be picked up and tossed out in the next breath -why not bring back the lottery of olden times? It certainly puts the "random" in "random hook-up;' and it would limit ResLife interference, as beer goggles would no longer be necessary to find a partner. Besides, the jar, perhaps in a lovely shade of pink, would go so well with the rest of South Dining Hall's decorations. 
With 12 days to go before the holi­day, as the scramble for a significant other reaches a fevered pitch, I send out a blanket plea for intelligent date choice. When faced with spending Valentine's Day with a group of friends or a drunken stranger, go with the for­mer. Unless you really like the idea of being just another name on a slip of paper.

HOLLAND,  Mich.  

Tacking Jr. or II onto a boy's name is too common, a new father decided, so the self­described engineering geek took a software approach to naming his newborn son. 
Jon Blake Cusack talked his wife, Jamie, into naming their son Jon Blake Cusack 2.0. 
Version 2.0 was born Tuesday at Holland Community Hospital, and the proud parents took him home Friday. 
"I wanted to find some­thing different to name him besides Jon Blake," Cusack, 
who is self-employed with 
Westshore  Design  and  
Cusack Music,  told  The  
Holland Sentinel.  

He said he had the idea for a few months, and spent the better part of that time persuading his wife to go along. 
Russian boxers married In the ring 
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -There's usually a ring in a wedding ceremony, but a wedding ceremony in a ring? 
The top matchup on the Saturday night card at a St. Petersburg boxing ring was the wedding of two Russian boxers who exchanged vows -and then blows -in what they called the great­est experience of their lives. 
"We decided to have our wedding party in a boxing ring because we first met in the ring and thought it would be very symbolic," said Nikolai Kibkalo, 40, who tied the knot with Natalya Karpovich, 31. 
On Saturday night, the pair of pugilists wore tradi­tional wedding garments, but donned boxing gloves after the ceremony and duked it out for a while.

Movie 'Black Barbie' Beauty·piays at SMC 
Film depicts African-American's struggles with concepts ofbeauty 
By ANGELA SAOUD 
News Wrirer 
Kareemah El-Amin's "Black Barbie Beauty," a film that portrays a young African­American woman struggling to fit in with society's image of beauty, premiered Friday night in Carroll Auditorium at Saint Mary's. 
~·I wanted to make this film because, growing up in the '70s and '80s, I struggled a lot with the image I saw looking in the mirror," El-Amin said. "I look at young women today, and I see these women dyeing their hair and wearing con­tacts to tty to fit in." 
Throughout "Black Barbie Beauty," the lead actress is shown staring at herself in the mirror. She applies baby powder to her skin in order to lighten her appearance and wears blue contacts with a blond wig. 
In a voiceover, the audience hears a poem that El-Amin wrote nearly seven years ago about the pain of looking dif­ferent from what mainstream America calls beautiful. 
"I wanted people to leave this film loving themselves for who they are," El-Amin said. "You should be proud of your heritage, proud of the way you look, even if you don't fit into the blond-haired, blue­eyed image." 
After the screening, which 

was only five minutes in length, an hour-long question­and-answer session was held. 
Many audience members provided El-Amin with posi­tive feedback on the film. Others shared their personal experiences with not fitting the ideal American image of beauty. 
One audience member com­mented on the lack of African-American beauty in mainstream America. 
"You just don't see black magazines on the news stands in the grocery store, and when you do see an image of African-American beauty, it's someone like Beyonce [Knowles] who has a blond hair weave and colored con­tacts," the audience member said. "This world is too slow still." 
El-Amin and the actors in the film then fielded questions and commented on the cre­ation of the movie. 
El-Amin has entered "Black Barbie Beauty" into the film festival circuit in hopes that it will reach many more young women who struggle with the way they look. 
"I think it's important to affirm young women," she said. "Don't let the main­stream influence who you are, because you are beautiful."

In Focus conference draws 120 
By CLAIRE HEININGER Assistant News Editor 

Despite clashes over the 
publicity scheme leading up to 
the third annual AAA In Focus 
Student-Run Conference, 
executive chair Ryan Leung 
said the event successfully 
boosted recognition of Asian 
and Asian-American issues at 
Notre Dame. 

"I think that, overall, the 
conference was a success," 
Leung said Sunday. "People's 
eyes were opened to some 
things they weren't aware of 
before."  

Leung said the conference was well attended, with 120 people present at the closing banquet and most of those also participating in various workshops throughout the day. 
"Being an all-day Saturday event, it was hard to get peo­ple to attend every workshop we had," he said. "But I'm glad we were able to get peo­ple to come to parts of it." 
Prominent Asian-Americans in a variety of career disci­plines led workshops at the conference, including actor Parry Shen's presentation of "Personal Journey," which narrated his experiences as one of the few Asian­Americans in Hollywood. 
AAA In Focus Public Relations chair Sarah Liu said the conference was eye-open­ing, but that students' interest in Asian-American concerns should not be confined to a yearly event. 
"I really hope that the ques­tions we raised ~ill go beyond just the conference this week­end," Liu said. "I hope the stu­dents who came felt empow­ered and will go out to make an impact on the Notre Dame community. I really hope that people will continue to chal­lenge others and themselves." 

While some of the flyers used to promote the event on campus were perceived as fur­thering anti-Asian stereotypes, Leung said they were not intended to be offensive. 
"I didn't get any official com­plaints, but I heard a lot of talk," he said. "Some of the flyers were seen as perpetuat­ing stereotypes, but we saw them as a method to bring issues Asian-Americans face to the forefront, to get people to discuss them and to pro­mote change." 
Advance publicity notwith­standing, the conference did bring the AAA into the spot­light. 
"A lot of people who came without any knowledge of the Asian community gained knowledge and insight," Liu said. 
Leung agreed that the goals of the weekend were achieved. 
"The most important mis­sion of the conference was to spark that fire in students' hearts to promote a better understanding of multicultural_ issues on campus," he said.

dents was one deciding factor in her choice to live in Castle Point next year. 
"Castle Point is the least expen­sive and nicest of the complexes, despite its longer distance from school," Wendel said. "Also, because it is not just for students, I will be able to interact with many different types of people, which is something that I think many people forget about while on campus at Notre Dame." 
In preparation for studying abroad this semester, Wendel signed her lease in early October. Some students, however, are not so prepared -causing complica­tions as the signing deadline nears.

Saint Mary's director of Residence Life Michelle Russell believes the apartments are a strong draw. 
"It's an option to the independ­ence of students without having to move away," Russell said. "You're close to class, close to the heart of campus -yet you still have your own kitchen, your own apartment. You get that free­dom. 
Saint Mary's Residence Life reported receiving more applica­tions than there are spaces for the new apartments. There will be a lottery for the 12 double and 12 quad apartments on Feb. 3. If a student is not chosen, her room deposit will roll over to the regt!­lar room drawing. 
Firmstone said relying on the dorms as a back-up plan is not an option for her. "We looked into Castle 
Russworm said. These students then are left to sign up late or not at all -College Park has been sold out of apartments since early October. 
"We have a list for the [20]05­06 school year starting already," Russworm said. "One hundred percent of all our renters are stu­dents." 
Some complexes, however, have not begun that renting process yet. The former Campus View Apartments, renamed Clover Ridge, has come under new ownership that aims to focus on this year first. 
Lisa Donlon, property manager of the recently purchased apart­ments, said the complex is remodeling and does not want to begin leasing until the renova­tions are complete. 
"So far, we're in the middle of remodeling. We're putting in new carpets, dishwashers, wash­ers and dryers -all of it," Donlon said. "We're looking to start leasing at the end of February or early March." 
Management hopes that new rent-covered inclusions such as Internet access and basic cable 
· will lure students to Clover Ridge. 
Many Saint Mary's students, however, said they will not take the bait ·-instead turning to the new on-campus apartments. 
·· Junior Michele Firmstone said the proximity of the apartments is a major selling point. "It's convenient. There's no driving issue," Firmstone said. "The apartments are already fur-
still moving off 
campus." 

Jeff Shoup, director of Notre Dame's Residence Life and Housing, said the popular per­ception of the entire senior class moving off campus is miscon­strued. 
"There actually aren't a lot of students moving off-campus," Shoup said. "As students stay here longer, they know more and more students who live off-cam­pus. They think that means that everyone wants to move." 
Shoup said that on average, 5 percent of sophomores, 25 per­cent of juniors and 55 percent of seniors choose to live off-campus. Notre Dame had difficulties fmd­ing space for all the students liv­ing on campus this year, he said. 
"We had more students return to campus this year than the year before," Shoup said. "We began the year with no openings and had 30 people on the waiting list for housing." 
Notre Dame eventually convert­ed over 30 lounges into dorm rooms and now has four or five spaces available on campus. However, many students are attracted by the freedom that off­campus housing offers and are making the decision to move now. 
"My friends who had lived off campus previously really enjoyed the independence and freedom that off-campus housing provided them," Wendel said. "I am look­ing forward to those very things."

Hundreds killed in hajj disaster 
MINA, Saudi Arabia -At least 244 people were trampled to death and hundreds more hurt Sunday under the crush of worshippers in one of the deadliest disasters during the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. 
The stampede occurred during the stoning of the devil, an emotional and notoriously perilous ha.ij ritual. Pilgrims frantically throw rocks, shout insults or hurl their shoes at three stone pillars -acts that are supposed to demonstrate their deep disdain for Satan. 
The stampede broke out on one of two ramps leading to the 50-foot stone pillars. Tens of thousands of people were on the uppermost ramp, which is about the width of a five-lane highway. 
Islamic leaders now Israeli targets 
JERUSALEM -The leaders of violent Islamic groups are targets for assassination, Israel's defense minister said Sunday. raising the possibility of a further escalation in the three years of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed. 
Shaul Mofaz issued the threat in response to a declaration by the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, that the group plans an all-out effort to kidnap Israeli sol­diers. 
"The statements of Yassin just emphasize the need to strike the heads of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad," Mofaz told the weekly meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, according to an Israeli official who attended the meeting. 
The statements by Mofaz and Yassin threaten to inflame an alreadv violent con­frontation that has led to the d-eaths of more than 3,500 people on both sides during three years of fighting.

Bush to order intelligence probe 
WASHINGTON -President Bush, under mounting political pressure, will sign an executive order to establish a full investiga­tion of U.S. intelligence failures in Iraq, a senior White House official said Sunday. 
The investigation will look at what the United States believed it knew before the war against Saddam Hussein's regime and what has been determined since the inva­sion. Former chief weapons inspector David Kay has concluded that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction, a chief ration­ale for the U.S.-led war. 
The investigation will examine not only Iraq but also intelligence issues dealing with stateless groups such as terrorists and secre­tive regimes such as North Korea, the official said, insisting on· anonymity. Given the broad mandate of the investigation, it is not likely to be completed before the November elec­tions. Bush had resisted an investigation of Iraq intelligence but agreed to an inquiry amid growing pressure.

INDIANAPOLIS -About 800 National Guard members from Indiana and other states who are heading to Bosnia­Herzegovina on peacekeeping duty received a warm sendoff at a ceremony attended by Gov. Joe Kernan and other dignitaries. 
About 500 Indiana Guard members were among the group that Kernan ch~racterized as "well-trained and up to the task, no mat­ter what the task." 
"Know that you have the unconditional support of every man, woman and child that calls Indiana home," Kernan, a decorated Navy veteran, told the group Saturday at the Indiana Convention Center. 
The Indiana-based troops being deployed are from the Indianapolis-based 38th Infantry Division, the Terre Haute-based 38th Support Battalion and the 138th Personnel Services Battalion.

IRAN 
One-third of legislators resign 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN -More than one­third of Iran's lawmakers resigned in protest Sunday over disputed elections and the par­liamentary speaker charged ruling clerics with trampling on the rights of his countrymen. 
Speaker Mahdi Karroubi appealed to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to help resolve the crisis caused by disqualitication of thousands of liberal candidates from the Feb. 20 vote. 
Some 124 Iawmakers in the 290-seat Majlis, or parliament, resigned Sunday in a dramatic gesture intended to force the clerical hierarchy to reinstate the disqualified candidates. 
The mass resignation "will determine Iran's direction: rule of absolute dictatorship or democracy," reformist lawmak­er Mohammad Kianoush-Rad told The Associated Press. 
Karroubi said he and reformist President Mohammad Khatami started new efforts to resolve the crisis, holding dis­cussions with Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters. 
But Khamenei left the capital Tehran for an undisclosed loca­tion, making it difficult to reach him, parliamentary officials said. 
Karroubi, the parliamentary speaker, launched a rare verbal attack on the Guardian Council, the unelected body of hard-line clerics that disqualified more than 2,400 reformist candidates from the legislative elections. 
"Are you loyal to Islam if you pray daily, but then trample on the rights of the people?" said Karroubi, himself a cleric. 
He accused the Guardian Council, whose 12 members are appointed by Khamenei, of "dis­respecting democratic values and having no faith in a popular vote." 
The furor began in early January when the Guardian Council disqualified more than 3,600 of the 8,200 people who filed papers to run in the polls. After protests and an opinion from Khamenei, the council on Friday restored 1,160 low-pro­file candidates to the list. 
Reformists say the council disqualified liberal candidates to fix the election in favor of conservatives. Hard-liners lost control of the parliament in elections four years ago, and repeatedly have thwarted Khatami's efforts toward greater democracy and a relax­ation of the Islamic social code. 
The council denies political motives and argues that the dis­qualified candidates lacked the criteria to stand for election, even though more than 80 of them were elected in 2000. 
Those lawmake·rs resigned Sunday. 
"An election whose result is clear beforehand is a treason to the rights and ideals of the nation," resigning legislators Rajah Ali Mazrouei told the par­liament. 
The leader of the biggest reform party in parliament, Mohammad Reza Khatami, resigned and accused the Guardian Council of killing all opportunities for resolving the dispute. 
"There is no hope for a solu­tion. We will not participate in this sham election. Even if all those disqualified are reinstated today, there will be no time for competition. Elections on Feb. 20 are illegitimate," said Reza Khatami, the president's younger brother and a deputy speaker. 
Iran's leading reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, has called a meeting Monday and is expected to announce a boycott of the polls. 
President Khatami called an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss the dispute Saturday, but was forced to postpone it when he suffered severe back pain and was confined to his house by doctors. 
On Saturday, President Khatami suggested his govern­ment would call off the elec­tions. 
"My government will only hold competitive and free elec­tions ... the parliament must represent the views of the majority and include all [politi­cal] tendencies," he said. 
If he follows through, that would leave voting in the hands of hard-liners most likely rely­ing on elite Revolutionary Guards and supporting military forces to organize the polls. 
Many hard-line legislators did not attend Sunday's session, apparently hoping to deny it a quorum. But the quorum of 194 of the Majlis' total 290 seats was reached. 
Inmates surrender as standoff ends 
Associated Press 
BUCKEYE, Ariz. -A correc­tions officer was released Sunday from the prison guard tower where she had been held hostage by a pair of inmates for two weeks, a Corrections Department spokeswoman said. 
The inmates surrendered, corrections spokeswoman Cam Hunter said. 
Hunter said the guard, whose name was not released, was receiving medical atten­tion. 
The surrender at the medi­um-to high-security Arizona State Prison Complex-Lewis ended one of the nation's long·est prison hostage situa­tions in decades. Negotiators had regular contact with inmates throughout the stand­off, and at times had seen the guard or talked to her by tele­phone 
The standoff at the 4,400­inmate prison west of Phoenix began Jan. 18 when an inmate attacked two guards and another worker in a kitchen area. That prisoner and another inmate then got into the observation tower, where they took the two guards hostage. 
One of the correctional offi­cers -a man -was released Jan. 24. 
The inmates were identified 
by prison officials as Ricky Wassenaar, 40, and Steven Coy, 39. 
Wassenaar is serving 28 years for armed robbery and assault. 
Steven Coy, who is serving a life sentence, has spent the better part of two decades in Arizona prisons. His offenses include theft, burglary, crimi­nal damage and drug posses­sion. He was sentenced to life after a 1993 crime spree in Tucson that included armed robbery, aggravated assault and rape. 
Both Coy and Wassenaar have committed numerous infractions while in prison, officials said. 

Shuttle anniversary 
commemorated 

Associated Press 
' 

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­One year after Columbia broke apart and fell in flaming streaks from the Texas sky, NASA workers who launched the shuttle and its seven astro­nauts and then gathered up the remains stood united in sorrow Sunday at the precise moment of destruction. 
The first anniversary of the catastrophe was a time for everyone -rocket engineers, debris searchers, school chil­dren, space enthusiasts, even football fans -to pause and remember. 
"One year ago, at this very hour, the unthinkable occurred," Kennedy Space Center's director, Jim Kennedy, told the crowd of a few hun­dred who gathered on a gray, drizzly morning at NASA's astronauts memorial. 
Kennedy quietly recited the names of the Columbia astro­nauts, carved into the black granite monument behind him: Commander Rick Husband, co­pilot William McCool, Michael Anderson, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark and Israel's first astronaut, Han Ramon. 
"They were our friends. They are our heroes. Their loss will not be in vain. We will come back bigger, better and stronger than ever before, and I can assure you that crew and their beloved families will never, ever be forgotten," Kennedy said. 
Almost all of the mourners held a long-stemmed rose. After the brief outdoor cere­mony, they tucked the red, yel­low, peach and ivory-colored roses into the white fence sur­rounding the memorial. 
Many wiped away tears. 
The ceremony began at 9 a.m., the instant NASA lost communication with Columbia over Texas on Feb. 1, 2003. 
It ended at 9:16 a.m., the time the spacecraft should have landed on the Kennedy Space Center runway. By then, Columbia had shattered into tens of thousands of pieces that crashed down on Texas and Louisiana. 
A piece of fuel-tank foam insulation had torn a hole in Columbia's left wing during the mid-January liftoff and allowed hot atmospheric gases . to enter during atmospheric re-entry. 



Kidnapped woman 
discovered alive 
Associated Press 
WHEELING, Ill.-A woman was found severely beaten, wrapped in duct tape and inside a plastic garbage can in her ex-husband's storage unit on Sunday, a day after she called 911 from the back of his truck saying he had abducted her. 
Teri Jendusa-Nickolai, 38, was in serious but stable condi­tion at a Park Ridge hospital, Wheeling Deputy Police Chief John Stone said. 
Jendusa-Nickolai, of Wind Lake, Wis., was found in a stor­age facility near the airport where her ex-husband, David Larsen, works, Stone said. An

Multiple jurisdictions are involved in the case because Jendusa-Nickolai apparently was abducted in Wind Lake, about 50 miles northwest of Wheeling.

Larsen, 39, was arrested Saturday when he reported for work as an air traffic controller at Palwaukee Municipal Airport. He was in custody Sunday on an initial charge of false imprisonment. 
Jendusa-Nickolai's rescue was a relief to her family, who were terrified Saturday with the disappearance not only of her but of her two young daughters. Amanda Larsen, 6, and Holly Larsen, 4, were found with a from her cell phone 
Saturday after­noon, saying Larsen had bound her hands and placed her in the back of his truck. 
A neighbor said they saw Larsen driving away from his home in his pickup truck Saturday morning, towing a trailer with his ex-wife's car on it. Jendusa-Nickolai's empty 1994 silver Camry was later found parked on a Milwaukee street, near a rental property owned by Larsen, Carlson said. 
Jendusa-Nickolai had obtained a restraining order against Larsen for domestic abuse on Jan. 22, and the two were in court recently for a child custody hearing, accord­ing to sherifl"s· officials.

ATA strikes deal with bondholders 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -The parent company of ATA Airlines Inc. reached agreement with bondhold­ers Friday, buying itself more time to repay debt and ease a cash crunch that threatened to bankrupt the nation's 1Oth largest carrier. 
ATA Holdings Corp. said it had met conditions for completing a bond exchange offer. The conditions included gaining satisfactory con­sent from bondholders and complet­ing amendments for leasing Boeing 737s and 757s that ATA had ordered before the Sept. 11 attacks. 
ATA also said it had won approval from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which guaran­tees loans to airlines. 
The low-fare carrier had faced the prospect of paying off $300 mil­lion in debt over two years while making aircraft lease payments. 
Friday's announcement "will cer­tainly give ATA a lot of breathing room to recover from the last cou­ple years of industry difficulties," said Richard Bittenbender, an air­line analyst at Moody's Investors Service. 
ATA shares closed up 41 cents, or 
3.3 percent, at $12.84 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Indianapolis-based ATA said last summer that it could not meet debt obligations unless it won mor~ ti,me_ , to repay bondholders. The airline warned of a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing unless it secured new repayment terms. 
Under the bond swap, ATA has more time to repay $175 million in bond notes originally due in August and $125 million in notes that were due next year. In exchange for stretching out the repayments, bondholders receive more favorable interest and cash consideration terms. 
ATA made its initial bond exchange offer Aug. 29, but was forced to revise the terms and extend the offer's deadline several times after failing to win enough bondholder ~uppo~t. . I

Don't appeal to Catholicism 
Speculating whether a more Catholic voter should choose a Republican or Democrat is an exer­cise in both absurdity and intellectu­al insecurity. Anyone who requires the comfort of 
Bill Rlnner
knowing that God will approve of his vote to either retain 
A Voice of
or oust George W. 
Reason

Bush is bound to be disappointed and should reevaluate the purpose of vot­ing. 
No matter how much you are influ­enced by Catholic social teaching. it's no surprise that the distribution of issues across the party platforms makes neither Democrats or Republicans truly shine from a pure­ly Catholic perspective. 
Democrats would never nominate a candidate who would sign a ban on abortion or nominate S.upreme Court justices who would overturn "Roe v. Wade," and the incumbent Republican facilitated what Catholic social teaching considers an unjust war in Iraq. There you have it; now get over it. 
The reality of the modern political arena is that no candidate will ever espouse every social tenet of Catholicism, so many try to find com­fort in the ability to weigh certain Catholic issues and vote for the less­er of two evils. It is an unfortunate position for any voter to find himself in, but I take issue with anyone who allows such a strong religious bias into their voting preferences. 
No single vote will ever make you more or less of a Catholic, and those who seek divine inspiration for their voting.patterns will likely end up at the polling booth trumpeting a skewed notion of God's will. To even suggest that Catholics should only vote for a single candidate is an insult to the church's endorsement of 
in election 
free will as God's greatest gift to humanity. 
If a priest mentions in his homily that you, as a good Catholic, should vote for a specific candidate, then you are not hearing the voice of a mediator between the human and the divine, but rather a human who is abusing his office and has the same political biases as the rest of us. The Church, or any member of it, should never make our voting deci­sions for us. and to suggest other­wise is to sanction a severe injustice. 
So why would someone conceivably appeal to his religious faith as justifi­cation for his political preferences? 
Simply put, the answer is insecuri­ty. We live in an era where complete deconstruction of political figures is now as American as apple pie. During our lifetimes. the prestigious role of the president has eroded sig­nificantly after countless scandals and a media that revels in inflating every minor shortcoming or mis­speak for the sake of higher ratings. I don't challenge or bemoan this development, which is the product of a free society, but I can understand that those with only moderate politi­cal views would feel insecure choos­ing between two flawed candidates. 
As a natural but unfortunate con­sequence, those who grew up in a wholly Catholic atmosphere and con­sider their faith to be crucial to most aspects of their lifestyles will gravi­tate toward the realm of religious reasoning during each election cycle. It happens all the time. You couldn't decide if you preferred Bush or Gore during the 2000 election; neither had a character or platform that was a perfect match for your personal views, so you looked at your "W.W.J.D?" wristband for some sign of inspiration. 
Oh, the folly of man. 
The solution I offer to this tendency is purely a challenge: Grow beyond the bonds of your religious back­ground and develop your vision, foremost, for which candidate would best serve the country. Reevaluate your reasoning for political views and how you would express them in elections. 
Listen to your conscience regarding political issues, not your religion. If you can't distinguish the two, then make sure you have arrived at those conclusions through a reasoned analysis of your opinion, not just because it makes sense within the confines of your religious views. The loudest voice in your head should be your own intellect, not what you heard at Mass this weekend. 
Better yet, when you finally decide for whom to vote in the upcoming election, make sure that you support the party you believe offers the best vision for the future of America based on the curr~nt domestic and international climate, not some utopian religious view of how America "should" be that is inconsis­tent with the reality of the modern world. 
We don't ask God how to run our country, nor does He directly influ­ence any election, which is a testa­ment to the free will of mankind. Claiming that a true Catholic should only vote in one direction is only a flawed way to alleviate a troubled conscience, and this mindset is unhealthy for the nation as a whole.

Edwards, not Kerry, will depose Bush 
Governor Howard Dean's barbaric yawp, in one fell swoop, derailed his campaign. The conservative strategists, aiming to paint Dean as an angry liber­al, found in The Scream the fullest 
expres~ion of the Roque Strew 
erstwhile frontrun­
ner's lunatic fury. 
Luckily for the GOP, 
Straight, No
the press promptly 
Chaser
turned The Scream 
into an Event, and 
that, more or less, is the story of the 
doctor's self-administered coup de 
grace. 
But how lucky was the GOP? Many believed, after all, that Dean was less electable, or more liberal, than Sen. John Kerry or Sen. John Edwards. In fact, the right-wing National Review had its fingers crossed for months, praying Dean would keep ahead of the other candidates. In other words, with Dean now (I think) out of the picture, the right now faces a few more formi­dable challengers. 
Let's examine the big two, Kerry and Edwards. Where some sense gravitas, I find in Kerry an affected solemnity. None of his rhetoric rings true to me, especially in light of his voting record. His flip-flopping runs the gamut, which bespeaks either plainjane opportunism or ideological incoherence, perhaps a mix of the two. 
After his wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, "The New Republic" sub­jected Kerry to closer scrutiny. What they found was a man attacked in the past as a "soft-on-crime, soft-on-wel­fare, crazed-on-taxes paleoliberal." Rove will mine that quarry happily ­and more aggressively-but it'll be an uphill battle to gainfully weigh Kerry's "early years as a warrior, protester, prosecutor and legislator" against "Bush's early years as a drinker." 
However, it's the later years where 
Kerry falters. As much as Kerry's recent legislative hijinks worry me, so does his cam­paign. If you look at every cam­paign excepting Edwards'. Dean's and Kerry's espe­cially, you'll encounter the inevitable exchange of criti­cisms, some even verging on smear. But Edwards has, from the outset, run a positive campaign. Even conser­vatives have applauded Edwards' serenity. 
Add to that 
his biography. 
What 

Edwards shares with Clark is an authentically plebeian, not patrician, back­ground-he's not another affluent Bulldog churned out by Yale, like Dean, Kerry, Lieberman and Bush. (In fact, Bush and Kerry were even members of the same infamous "secret socie­ty" of elites at Yale, Skull and Bones.) Edwards, on the other hand, went to North Carolina State. Unlike Bush, he didn't attend an exclusive prep school. And he doesn't hail from a political dynasty or oil money. On the contrary, his father worked in a textile mill. Which, then, can better relate to Middle America? 
Notre Dame's own College 
Democrats, a predominantly female 
group, share a strong balance of opti­
mism and outrage. Bush won't serve another term -not on their watch. But my handful of experiences with them also suggest to me something else: a collective hope that, after each successful debate; Edwards 
will, Mia Hamm­style, tear 
off his oxford shirt and bare his sculpted pectorals in all their Hellenistic 
majesty. Looks matter-I 
think we have a con­sensus here. America simply 

would rather not have an unsightly commander-in-chief. The GOP barely passes muster here. Not so the 
Democrats. The tradition of handsome, youthful Democratic candi­dates begins, of course, with JFK. (William F. Buckley, Jr., goes so far as to say that JFK's real legacy was his beauty.) Then Gary Hart in 1984 and Bill Clinton in 1992. And now Edwards -deemed by People magazine a few years ago the "Sexiest Man Alive" in the politician category. 
Back to Edwards' debating skill. He's an astonishingly successful attorney, first off; argument is his profession and he's proved to have mastered it. Some believe that if Edwards ended"up as the Democratic nominee, Bush would sim­ply refuse to debate him. The soothing drawl, the warm smile, the swift intel­lect -it'd be over before it started. 
Bush, let's be honest, couldn't debate his way out of a wet paper bag. (Maybe he could cheer his way out of one.) Top-dollar schooling evidently failed him in that department. So the prospect of our beloved incumbent locking rhetorical horns with Edwards -on national television, no less ­must have Karl Rove shaking in his imported loafers. At that same prospect, people like me are all but salivating, gleefully imagining the sound thrashing Edwards would deliv­er. 
Let's backpedal and revisit the morn­ing after The Scream. Because the media focused nearly all its attentions on Dean's antics, the more substantial story was buried: Edwards' second­place finish. Kerry was·instead lav­ished with attention, which undoubted­ly helped in New Hampshire. So the media, in reality, dealt both Dean and Edwards a solid blow. The former's done with, but the latter, as the GOP knows and fears, is still fighting the good fight. With us behind him. Edwards, not Kerry, will depose Bush,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Defending 'T~e Vagina Monologues' 
Exploring play's complexities 
I would like to respond to Professor Rice's Jan. 28 column concerning "The Vagina Monologues" at Notre Dame. 
In 2002, when "The Vagina Monologues" first came to Notre Dame, Professor Rice expressed concern and distress for some of the content of the play, as he did again this week. He worried about, the questionable nature of some of the mono­logues and what they would mean for women and for Notre Dame. And he is right to worry. As the play says, "We were worried about vaginas." 
"The Vagina Monologues" is not a simple play­it is incredibly complex. To attempt to cast the entire play in a single light is to miss the point it is trying to make. Professor Rice's mistake is that he attempts to do just that-classify the entire play as an advertisement for immorality and perver­sion. 
It is true that some of the Monologues will make audience members uncomfortable. Others may cause outrage. Others may cause fear or pity, while still others will create an unwavering sense of hope. The fact is that "The Vagina Monologues" is a metaphor for women and an example of women's diverse experiences in life. To silence even one of them, no matter how upsetting or out­rageous, is to silence us all. And once we get to talking, there's no stopping us. 
Professor Rice chastises the administration for its decision to allow such a play to be performed on the campus of Our Lady. I say that Our Lady would be proud. She, too, had a story to tell. Pregnant out of wedlock with only an incredible explanation for her husband-to-be, she asked that 
others hear her story and have faith that, 
although she did not fit into the mold that society 
expected her to, she was an important and worthy 
woman. 

Mary had a vagina. And I bet she would have something to say. 
Finally, I find it disturbing that Professor Rice refers to the administration's responses to criti­cism as "academic banalities." In a University as well-respected as Notre Dame, how can any aca-_ demic pursuit be considered banal? Have faith, Professor Rice, that the students of Notre Dame will see the play, take it all in, and decide for . themselves. I encourage everyone, even the most steadfast critics, to see the play. Explore the com­plexities of the stories, of the women and of their lives, and decide for yourself how you will inter­pret them. 
Congratulations to the amazing women of V-Day ND 2004. Your hard work and dedication will no doubt make this year the most fun and informa­tive yet. Every moment you put into this work, every person you talk to about the play or about V­Day, and every time you think about your own beliefs because of this effort, you are helping to be sure that women everywhere will be able to live happier, safer lives. 
Kerry Walsh class of2002 former V-Day NO organizer Jan. 30 
An equal opportunity production? 
I am writing to address a grave concern of mine: the trav­esty known as "The Vagina Monologues." Oearly, allowing them to come here will put a blemish in our school's other­wise great reputation. I cannot believe that we are allowing ourselves to take such a significant step backwards in the development of our atmosphere of sexual equality. 
Where, I ask, are 'The Penis Monologues?" What kind of equal-opportunity campus are we if we can't even provide comparable theatre experience for our men and our women? Now, I don't know much about this monologue play, but I do know that it has vagina in the title, and to me, thatjust exudes discrimination. Clearly, this can only be bal­anced out with a play that has penis in the title. I mean, come on. Men have sex organs, too. We can get onstage and talk about them. Ever think about that? Seriously. 
I hope if you have been reading this far, you are either very angry with me, or laughing hysterically. (I will accept either result.) I wrote this letter as a joke, hoping to prove the point that you can't really complain about something unless you have experienced it. And by "experienced," I don't mean you saw a special on C-SPAN, or you looked up a few quotes about lesbians to put into an editorial. So before you throw a fit about administration laxness, school reputa­tion, or your own inability to deal with the word "vagina," buy a ticket and see what they have to say. I know I will.

Motion City Soundtrack, Sugarcult, MxPx and Simple Plan hit Chicago Frida 


By MAUREEN BUSH 
Scene Writer 
The first large pop punk tour of the year breezed though the Windy City Jan. 30, leaving the young adults of Chicago with a warm feeling despite the biting cold outdoors. Motion City Soundtrack, Sugarcult and co-headlin­ers MxPx and Simple Plan took the downtown Rivera Theater by storm that night, filling the theater to the brink and pleasing the anxious crowd. 
The show opened with Epitaph recording artist Motion City Soundtrack from Minneapolis. This excellent blend of unusual vocals, electric keyboards and beats was a powerful way to start the night. The band played their much 
too short 

eight song set with flare. They began their set with "Cambridge" and contin­ued by play­ing the majority of the songs on their full­length album, "I Am the Movie." 
Lead singer and guitar, Justin Pierre, has an excel­lent voice, and the qual­ity shone through to the crowd of exuberant teenagers. Motion City Soundtrack is rounded out by Joshua Cain on gui­tars and back-up vocals, Tony Thaxton on drums, Jesse Johnson on moog (a small key­board-type instrument). and Matthew Taylor on bass and backup vocals. Their set flowed beautifully as they finished up with fan-favorites, "The Future Freaks Me Out" and "My Favorite Accident." 
This band has an amazing amount of talent and this was · evident as they played their set. The group could do something spectacu­lar in the future. 
As Simple Plan lead singer Pierre Bouvier said later that night, "Give it up .for Motion City Soundtrack. We're OK. They are great." 
The next act of the night was Santa Barbara, California's own Sugarcult. This powerful pop-punk foursome put together an excel­lent set that was

by the crowd who 

was looking to take 
the energy level up a notch. Sugarcult 
did just that entering the stage to with 
popular song, "Stuck in America." The high energy continued through the night as they played songs from their full-length album, "Start Stc;ttic," such as, "Daddy's Little Defect," "She's the Blade," and "Pretty Girl." They also played their new song, "Memory," to supplement the older favorites. This song is on their new full length titled, "Palm Trees and Powerlines," which is scheduled to be released on April 13. 
Leading the way was singer/guitar Tim Pagnotta, with band mates Marko 72 on gui­tar, Airin on bass and vocals, and Ben Davis on drums and vocals. Their hooks were incredibly catchy and kept the crowd jumping the whole set. Their clever use of lyrics enhanced the melodies. The music had enough pop credence to draw the crowd in and was smart enough to keep them excited for the next song. Sugarcult played an excellent set and made · one lucky fan's night by pulling him out of the crowd to videotape the set for their impending DVD they will be releas­ing. Members of the band could also be found out by their merchandise booth during the show and after the show to take pictures and sign autqgraphs for the fans. This kind of atti­tude, supplemented by their punchy music, will help them continue on their path to fame. Next in line was veteran 

Christian punk act MxPx, hailing from Bremerton, Washington. Made up of Mike Herrera singing and playing bass, Tom Wisniewski on guitar, and Yuri Ruley on drums, MxPx has released over 11 albums since 1995, the most recent being, "Before Everything & After," released in August on A&M Records. They began their set with "Play It Loud" and kept up the intensity all night. They played their set like the veterans they are. 
The show was an excellent mix, hit­ting both old favorites and the newer songs. They played "The Next Big Thing," "Southbound," and brought out the acoustic guitar for "Quit Your Life" among the others. Like Sugarcult, they made two girls' night by bringing them up on stage to have the band's first ever bass-off. The band gave each girl a bass guitar and had them battle it out to see who was the best. Neither girl had ever played before, but the use of crowd participation was a hit with the fans. 
After the bass-off, the band finished up with a cover song followed by one of their own, having Wisniewski sing "Should I Stay or Should I Go." They left the stage and came back momentarily to break into a cover of "Summer of '69" and popular song, "Chick Magnet." As always, they finished their set play­ing "Punk Rawk Show" to the delight of the crowd. 
The set was perfect length and was well planned. Hearing the older songs was nice, but it was a surprise that they played only six new songs in a 1 7 song set list. Still, it was a well played set that kept the predominantly Simple Plan fan crowd happy. 
The final act of the night was north­ern neighbor Simple Plan from Canada, with Pierre Bouvier on vocals, Chuck Comeau on drums, Jeff Stinko on lead guitar, David Desrosiers on bass and backup vocals and Sebastien Lefebvre on bass and back up vocals.

lY night in one of the year's first big rock tours 
These French-Canadian punks were the high­light of the night for many of the teens in the crowd whose resounding screams filled the building as they took the stage to the Star Wars theme, "The Imperial March." They immediately ripped into their set, playing many of the songs off their 2002 debut album, "No Pads, No Helmets..: Just Balls," includ_ing radio hits, 'Tm Just a Kid," "Addicted," and ''I'd Do Anything." 

This high-energy band is very reminiscent of fellow pop punk band Good Charlotte. Both have catchy hooks and fast paced anthems for disillu­sioned teens who want to scream their frustrations about growing up. The band played their songs and made jokes between them in Blink-182 fashion for the captivated audience. After playing some of their songs. the band really kicked in covering Pink's, "Get the Party Started", The Black Eyed Peas "Where's the Love", and also the Turtles' "Happy Together". Hearing so many cover songs in one night was a bit surprising. 
Bouvier and his acoustic gui­tar provided the second encore 
1.com 
of the night with Simple Plan's 
r of latest radio hit, "Perfect." Bouvier started the song him­self, but then stopped and allowed the thousands of voic­es in the Rivera to do the work for him. Halfway though the song the rest of the band joined him on stage and they filled out the rest of the music in an excellent end to the con­cert. Overall, it was a well-crafted tour with an interesting mix of different bands. The talent of some of the bands was over the heads of the kids who were seemingly there for one pur­
pose, to see Simple Plan. Simple Plan deserves a lot of credit for realizing this talent and taking these bands on tour to give them exposure to the masses.

Aery for the original Viewpoint 
I come to you today, my dear friends, to bring to light the dire situation we are fac­ing concerning The Observer Viewpoint section. Many peo­ple turn to the Viewpoint sec­tion in order to explore the various perspectives of fellow students and faculty, hoping to gain insight on current issues that are reievant to the student body and in our world. This, after all, is why the section exists. 
I have noticed, however, that the scope of the issues cover~d in The Observer by the student body has become increasingly narrow. In fact, on any given day, there's a pretty good chance that most students can name two_ or three of the articles that are published before even open­ing the paper. Because of this, I have decided to layout for you a quick list of what I believe to be the most played -out Viewpoint articles of all time. 
First of all, I must point out the "obscure political refer­ence that no one cares about" article. This is typical­ly a full-page article that attempts to turn the student body towards either tree­hugging liberalism or "ostra­cize everyone but the upper­middle class" conservatism. Thanks for the effort guys, but if I were looking for an article like this I would've picked up copies of "Common Sense" or the "Irish Rover." 
Second, there's the typical "Cherish your time at NO" . article that someone is sure to send in once a week. This 
· usually comes from a senior who is lamenting over their experiences at Notre Dame and talking about anything from what they think to be a funny Frosh-0 experience to the last time they got drunk at the Linebacker. On occa­sion, these articles can be tolerable, giving the student body a chance to reflect on their experiences here, but after awhile they start to sound like an NBC "the more you know" commercial. This type of article can also easily be coupled with the "thank God I'm finally 21" article, which generally recounts close calls with bar busts or fake ID stories. 
Then, of course, there is the ''I'm ultra-sensitive and everything offends me" arti­cle, carrying the tone of the movie PCU throughout. This article rants about different events going on around cam­pus that "don't fit in with the Catholic nature of the University" and usually tries to stifle much of the creative 
thinking that goes on here. 
Two of the usual suspects 
that are attacked here are 

the Vagina Monologues and --. 
the Keenan Review. I must 
say, if 
you're Tom Raaf 
going to 
object to 
Scene
something 
Columnist
about the 
Keenan 
Review then you should go 
off about the annoying girls 
in the crowd that sing all of 
the songs between skits. 
They are simply unbearable. 
Oh, and that awful head-bob­
bing that accompanies the 
singing ... Lord, please make it 
stop. 
On a related note to the 
previous article, there is the 
"offended person's response 
to the offended person." This 
is when someone writes a 
Viewpoint about something 
that offended them and the 
next day another article 
comes out about how offen­
sive the previous article was 
to another person. These 
articles can get a little ridicu­
lous and are at times hilari­
ous because the writer often 
ends up looking like a total 
crackpot. Does anyone 
remember that girl who was 
fuming about clothing styles 
on campus? If not, you can 
find her at the first table on 
the left in North Dining hall, 
according her instructions. 
I consulted a classmate of mine, fellow women's studies major Dan Block, for a reac­tion to lack of diversity in the Viewpoint's students are sub­mitting and he had this to say; 'Tm just surprised that no one has written on the plight of the three-toed Sri Lankan tree lemur. This rare species travels the forests in fear of his life while heartless poachers chase him like they're playing some kind of game. It's a damn shame, Jenkins, a damn shame." Upon hearing this, I shed a tear then quickly reminded him that my name was in fact Tom, not Jenkins. 
I would continue on my lit­tle ramblings about the com­mon Viewpoint themes, but then my article would look really long on the page and everyone would skip over it. So. in closing, I must say this; if anything I have said hurt your feelings or offended you, I'll see you in the Viewpoint section tomorrow.

FENCING 

Irish down slew of challengers at dual meet 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 

Saturday's dual meet marked the first time all season the Notre Dame fencing team showcased its talent in front of a home crowd. The defending national champions did not disappoint. 
Ten other teams arrived in South Bend with the hopes of b~sting the host Irish teams. Both the men and the women mowed down their opposition, finishing the tournament at a perfect 9-0 and 10-0, respective­ly. The women improved their season record to 20-0 while the men advanced to an 18 -1 mark. 
The dual meet began on Saturday with Notre Dame fenc­ing against Cleveland State and Air Force. Neither the men nor the women had any problem tak .. ing either match. The men topped Cleveland State 24-3 while the women dominated with a 26-1 victory. Air Force didn't put up much more of a fight, as both squads dispatched the Falcons 21-6. The next match against Ohio State, as expected, proved to be the most difficult of the weekend. 
Against an Ohio State team ranked second on both sides, the Irish faced a much steeper chal­lenge. Against the Buckeyes, the men's epeeists and sabers strug­gled to a combined 9-9 record leaving the match for the foilists to decide. But the Irish foilists faced a formidable foe in the per­son of Ohio State freshman Boaz Ellis. Ellis quickly swept aside both freshman Frankie Bontempo and senior All­American Forest Walton 5-1 and 5-0, respectively. That was when senior Derek Snyder put the team on his back. 
In his first bout against Buckeye sophomore Alexander Law, Snyder faced a 4-0 deficit and match point. But he battled back, scoring five unanswered touches to win in a 5-4 decision. 
His greatest test, however, came in the team's last match against Ohio State when he fenced Ellis. "Seeing where he finished in all the world cups he always does really, really well," he said. "I knew that it was going to be the toughest match up to this point in the season." 
With both teams and a throng of Irish fans circling the strip, the two squared off in one of the most intense matches of the day. This time, Snyder jumped out to the early lead, putting Ellis in a deep 4-1 hole. Ellis fought back and used a furious rally to record the next three points and tie the bout at four. Both fencers strug­gled in the deadlock until finally Snyder scored the final touch to secure a 5-4 victory. 
A roar burst from the Notre Dame faithful as the men defeat­ed Ohio State by a 15-12 score. Snyder's win capped a big day as he fmished Saturday with a per­fect 12-0 record. 
The women's match was even closer.

Federer defeats Safin to capture Australian Open title 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­
Roger Federer skipped the sob­
bing this time. He is, after all, 
getting familiar with the honor: 
Grand Slam tournament cham­
pion. 
Playing shrewd and confident tennis that has left him at No. 1, Federer won the Australian Open 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-2 Sunday against a weary and frustrated Marat Safin. 
Federer has captured two of the last three majors following his Wimbledon triumph. 
"I feel like I'm living the game when I'm out there," the Swiss star said. "When a a guy is going to hit the ball, I know exactly the angles and the spins. I just feel that I've got that figured out." 
It was enough to end Satin's great run. The unseeded Russian beat top-seeded Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, then stopped defending cham­pion Andre Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the Australian Open in the semis. 
But after more than 18 hours and 27 sets in six rounds, Satin had little left. Federer clearly was fresher, having spent just more than 10 hours on court and losing only two sets. 
When Federer won Wimbledon last summer, he responded with sobs of relief. At Melbourne Park, he was moved, bur far more composed and controlled. 
"What a great start to the year for me, to win the Australian Open and become 
No. 1 in the world," Federer 
said. "It means a lot to me." 
A day earlier, Justine Henin­Hardenrie added another title, winning a third all-Belgian Grand Slam final against Kim Clijsters to remain No. 1. The 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 victory was her third major in eight months. 
Federer, seeded second, was already ensured the top rank­ing by beating third-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero in the semifinals. Roddick's loss in the quarterfinals ended the 
U.S. Open champion's stay No. 1. 
In addition to his two major titles, Federer also won the season-ending Masters Cup at Houston. 
"When it gets important, I feel like I can raise my game," he said. 
He surely did that against Safin. The Russian slammed his racket to the court and drew a code violation when he smashed a racket after a dou­ble-fault. He talked to himself and to the crowd; he shook his head and shrugged after most of his 41 unforced errors. 
Against Agassi, one of the best serve returners in the game, Safin had 31 aces and no double-faults. Against Federer, the balls kept coming back. 
Federer chased overheads and forehands down the line that had the look of winners. Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion down, was drained. 
"I was out of energy, my legs were just too tired," he said. "I was a little too tired to keep up 
with him. I felt that I was miss­
ing just a little bit. Against 
Roger, you have to do better 
than that. I'm not playing a yo­
yo." 

Satin lost his last six matches in 2003, a rough year in which he struggled with an ailing wrist. He entered the tourna­ment at No. 86 and will improve to the low 30s on Monday. 
''I'm actually very glad to be in finals again," he said. ''I'm really glad to play my best ten­nis after the injuries I had last year." 
He did get one reward for his marathon effort in Melbourne, matching Harold Solomon's record of 30 sets for a Grand Slam tournament set in the 1976 French Open. 
Henin-Hardenne, with three Grand Slams, wants a fourth ­on grass. 
"Wimbledon this year, for sure, is going to be another goal," she said after adding the Australian to her wins at the French and U.S. Open last year. 
She's proved too good for Clijsters in their last three meetings in majors following a stretch in which the Williams sisters dominated. 
"I still have to improve my game on grass, especially against the strong players like Venus or Serena," Henin­Hardenne said. "I always lost against them over there because they're so powerful." 
In Melbourne, she didn't have to face Venus Williams, who was upset in the third round by Lisa Raymond.

Provid·ence falls to Seton Hall in Big East play 
Associated Press 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -Seton Hall decided not to double team Providence's Ryan Gomes, and see if anybody else could beat them one-on-one. 
The plan worked. 
Gomes got 28 points, but Seton Hall never let any of the other Friars get going, and the Pirates held No. 23 Providence to its lowest point total of the season in a 55-46 victory on Sunday. 
"It was our best defensive game from beginning to end since I've been here," said coach Louis Orr, in his third season at Seton Hall. 
Andre Sweet was 7 -of-9 from the field and scored 18 points to lead Seton Hall (14-4, 4-2), which won its the third straight -all in the conference. 
Providence (14-4, 5-2) had a six-game winning streak snapped, and fell out of a first-

"We didn't play with that swagger [we had] in the past three weeks," Providence coach Tim Welsh said. "We played back on our heels and side­ways, but they make you play that way. We just didn't have that look." 
Gomes, who had 13 rebounds, scored 20 points in the second half, including 16 straight for the Friars at one point. 
Gomes "is a tough guy to stop. I thought we did a good job to make him work for his points, but also did a good job with the other people," Orr said. 

J.R. Morris scored 13 points for Seton Hall, which shot 54 percent in the second half, while Kelly Whitney added 10. Andre Barrett, the Pirates' leading scorer with an 18.4 average, was held to a season­low six points, and had four assists.

butterflies before every match, but then your nerves disap­pear later." 
Overcoming that feeling of apprehension early on this weekend proved to be key to the team's success. 
Sunday's match against No. 64 Wisconsin brought Irish wins across the board begin­ning with Salas and Lauren Connelly's defeat of Teresa Gonzaga and Shana McElroy 8-2. Sarah Jane Connelly and Statsny knocked off Kaylan Caiati and Lexi Goldin 8.:5 to clinch the doubles point. Christian and Catrina Thompson swept doubles with an 8-5 triumph over Lindsay Martin and Katie McGaffigan. 
The Irish swept singles as well over Wisconsin with Salas remaining unbeaten this spring with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 win over McGafligan. Christian Thompson, nationally-ranked 88th triumphed over McElroy, who started this season ranked 79th. Catrina Thompson clinched the singles point with a win against Martin. Lauren Connelly gained her third win this season, defeating Teresa Gonzaga 6-4, 6-2. Also suc­cessful was Sara Jane Connelly, who won 6-0, 7-6 (9­
7) over Caiati. Statsny swept doubles, beating Goldin 6-0, 6­4. 
The Irish have a two-week break before their Feb. 13 meet at No. 16 Virginia Commonwealth. During this time, Louderback said the team will focus on becoming "match-tough"· by making inter-squad matches an inte­gral part of practice. 
"We'll be working really hard in practice [in the next weeks]," said Sarah Jane Connelly. "Because everyone wants to beat Notre Dame."

after a marginal victory, the 
Belles still view Chicago as a 
great competitor. 
"They were very competi­
tive, with a team that is 
slightly smaller than ours," 
Saint Mary's swimming coach 
Greg Petcoff said. "Our girls 
left the meet with a great 
deal of respect for them." 
As the team prepares for 
the MIAA championships, the 
win against Chicago will help 
to boost the confidence of a 
team that has overcome 
many obstacles throughout 
the season. 
"It was a really difficult ·season [with] a lot of con­
everyone's spirits." 

In their preparations, Saint Mary's will reduce the amount of training and begin tapering for the next few weeks. The team hopes to go 'jnto the MIAA championships

"They are not going to see 
a new Saint Mary's at the

Notre Dame hits wall against No.8 Duke 
By KATE GALES Sports Writer 

The Irish had no luck at 
Duke this weekend, as the Blue 
Devils swept them, 7-0, in dual 
match play. 

"We had our chances," coach Bobby Bayliss said after the match. "They're a Final Four team, in my opinion, and I expect them to do very well [this season]." 
No. 8 Duke lost just two sets in ·singles and swept doubles against No. 49 Notre Dame. The box scores, though, do not indicate that many of the matches were close. 
"The doubles were pretty close; there was a break at No. 1 early, and we lost No. 1 and No. 3 doubles by one service break -both were 8-5," said Bayliss. "No. 2 lost 9-8 in a tiebreaker, and we were actu­ally in position to win the oth­ers -they were very, very close." 
Duke (3-0) won against Texas A&M on Saturday. The Aggies beat Notre Dame 5-2 last weekend at the Eck Tennis Pavilion.. 
"We had our chances," Bayliss said of singles play. "Matt Scott lost in a match tiebreaker... [and Brent] D'Amico lost in three sets." 
Scott, ranked No. 68 coming off a recurrent leg injury, took the first set against Ludovic Walter, 6-3. Playing at number two, however, Walter ­ranked No. 7 in the nation ­battled back to win the second set and the last set in a tiebreaker. 
D'Amico came out strong, taking the first set against Jason Zimmerman 6-1, but he then lost 6-2 and 6-1 and Duke received the point. Luis Haddock, Stephen Bass and Barry King all lost in straight sets at No. 1, 4 and 5, respec­tively. Ryan Keckley, at No. 6, was forced to retire after suf­fering a sprained ankle in the second set. 
"Keckley went down in the third, fourth game of his match with a sprained ankle," Bayliss said. "We took an injury time­out-he got taped and tried to continue but had to end up defaulting, and that's a blow. Hopefully next week we'll get him back on track." 
"We were down 2-0 right off the bat, which is a pretty big psychological thing to deal with, but you move on," Bayliss said. 
Despite Scott's defeat, Bayless considered his play promising. 
·"Matt's foot started to bother him a little bit toward the end of his match," Bayless said. "I was really satisfied with the way he played; he hit the ball better than he has since the fall. I hope he's okay for the coming weekend -with Ryan's status in question, Matt shaky and Luis gone, we could be without three starters." 
Haddock will be playing in a tournament in Cuba during next weekend's match.

Senior teammate Kevin Somok won the 800-meter in 1:53.63. 
Senior Juan Alba won the weight throw with a heave of 
17.75 meters. He also quali­fied for the conference meet in the shot put with a toss of 
15.60 meters. 
Justin Oppel won-the pole vault with a height of 4.65 meters while fellow freshman Christopher Jacques placed first in the long jump with a leap of 6.59 meters.

spark." 
The Irish defense was up to the challenge against a Boston College team that came into the game averaging 72.3 points per game. The win marks the sixth victory in seven games for Notre Dame, and in all six victories, the Irish have held opponents to 50 points or less. The Irish defense has allowed just 171 points in the last four games. _ 
The score of Saturday's contest remained close throughout the game. Duffy hit a three-pointer to make it 14-10 in favor of the Irish, which proved to be the biggest lead of the game for either team. Notre Dame was also able to force the Eagles into 14 first-half turnovers, holding them to 22 points despite shoot­ing 43.5 percent from the field. 
''I'm just really pleased with the way they've come through this stretch [of ranked teams]," McGraw said. "It's really been a great defensive stretch for us." 
The Irish defense was also able to hold the Eagles' leading scor­er, Jessalyn Deveny, to 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting. Boston College's other star guard, Amber Jacobs, was held to 10 points on 4-for-15 shooting. Kathrin Ress, however, chipped in 14 points on 5-for-5 shooting. The Eagles shot 40 percent for the game, and the game almost slipped way from the Irish at the end. 
After tying the game at 42 with 
7:31 to go, Notre Dame missed eight free throws. 
But with 14 seconds left, Jacqueline Batteast hit one of two free throws to give the Irish a two-point lead. Boston College got the rebound on the second shot, but Jacobs was unable to hit an open, possible game-win­ning three-point attempt with five seconds to go. 
"I thought this game was criti­cal for us," McGraw said. "It really gave us just an added bonus going into the postseason. I think we're a top-25 team." 
Courtney LaVere added 11 points for Notre Dame, who 
remains undefeated at home this season (9-0). 
"We really wanted to take care of our home court this year," McGraw said. "I think mental toughness is something that last year people questioned ... and this year I think we've proven, time and time again, that we are a very, very tough team. That was an incredibly physical game, and I thought we responded very well."

But she wasn't the only Irish guard who came to play on Saturday. Senior captain Le'Tania Severe sparked a stagnant Irish offense when they needed it the most. 
The play of Duffy and Severe made the difference against Boston College, a team rumored to have one of the best back courts in the Big East in Amber Jacobs

and Jessalyn Deveny. 
Jacobs, though, was unable to connect on a three pointer to win the game and fmished 4-for-15 from the field. Deveny was held to 4-for-11 shooting. 
Mean\;Vhile, Duffy and Severe made sure the 6,808 Joyce Center 
fans knew the Eagles were not the only team with a talented backcourt. 
Duffy played the entire game, scoring J6 points on 6-for-11 shooting, including 3-for-5 from behind the arc. She committed only one turnover, while register­ing four steals and dishing out three assists. The 5'7" Duffy also grabbed three rebounds against a team with two 6-foot-4 players in the posts. 
But then there was Severe. She ­consistently slashed and drove to the basket against the bigger Eagles. When the shot clock was winding down and it seemed like there was nowhere to go, Severe found a way to score and found a way for the Irish to win. 
Severe only took eight shots, but she made five. She didn't miss a free throw, either, going 5-for-5 when the other members of her team weren't hitting their free

throws. And the best part about Severe's 39 minutes were her turnovers -or lack thereof. She didn't turn the ball over once, despite handling the ball a signifi: cant amount. 
And it wasn'tjust their offense that made this duo better than the backcourt of Boston College. It was their defensive effort. 
Severe and Duffy forced Jacobs and Deveny into tough shots, resulting in poor shooting per­formances. They left Boston College searching for ways to score, as they helped hold the Eagles to 50 points, over 20 below their 72.3 points per-game aver­age. 
But Duffy and Severe weren't looking to be the heroes of the game. They just wanted to win. 
. "I'm just trying to do a good job running the point, keeping every­body in the right position," Duffy said. "Some nights I get more shots than other times. Some games I have to score, some games I don't. The biggest thing is getting these guys' shots and keeping the team together. I feed ofT a lot from playing good defense, and that is kind of my game." 
In the Big East, Duffy and Severe may not be regarded as the best backcourt tandem just yet. But they sure are making a case for themselves.

Irish continue to suffer in torture RAC 
Scarlet Knights improve to 7-1 all-time versus Irish at home 
By MATT LOZAR Associate Sports Editor 

The Irish probably wish Rutgers were switching confer­ences next year. 
Eleven days after winning at Virginia Tech, who is joining the ACC next year, the Irish lost 81­70 at the RAC Saturday in a loss that has the Irish feeling they are cursed when playing in Piscataway, N.J. 
Unlike last season, when the Scarlet Knights jumped out to a 43-19 lead in the first half en route to a 95-80 victory, the Irish were able to stay in this game during the first half, holding a 38-34 advantage after the first 20 minutes. 
But then the second half start­ed. 
Over the first 11 minutes of the second half, the Irish (10-7, 4-3 in the Big East) shot 1-of-12 from the field, committed five turnovers and scored only six points.

Huddle, a sophomore from Elmira, N.Y., broke her own school record in the 3,000­meter race with a time of 9:14.13. 
Huddle's time is the second­best time posted in the coun­try this season. The race automatically qualifies her for the NCAA championships to be held March 12 in Fayetteville, Ark. 
Another outstanding per­formance on the women's side came from junior Lauren King. Her time of 4:45.61 won the inile run and puts her in second place national­ly. 
Senior Tiffany Gunn won the 500-meter with a season­best mark of 1:13.37. Teammate freshman Okechi Ogbuokiri finished second to Gunn in a time of 1:16.61.

"I thought that Megan and Le'Tania played especially well today, and I think, coming off the Miami game, they really had great focus and played really well at both ends," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "Thankfully, they did score, because we really struggled to score." 
Severe, who came into the game averaging 7.5 points per game, was able to slash and create for the Irish. 
"The drive was there a lot, so I just took what the defense gave me," Severe said. "I think that we were having a little trouble scoring, and I knew I had to provide some type of a

The Irish (13-9-4, 9-8-3 in the CCHA) bounced back from a pair of disappointing one­goal losses last weekend against Northern Michigan by taking three of four points from Alaska Fairbanks (12­13-1, 11-10-1) in a series this weekend at the Joyce Center. Notre Dame won the first game 3-2 on Friday and came back to salvage a 2-2 tie against the Nanooks Saturday. 
The Irish special teams had a solid weekend with the penalty kill, stopping all 11 Nanook power plays in the two games, including eight in the win Friday. Notre Dame's power play also chipped in with two goals, and Rob Globke scored a shorthanded goal Friday to really put a damper on UAF's chances at a comeback.

Notre Dame also got much­needed help on offense Saturday, as a player other than the trio of Mike Walsh, Rob Globke and Aaron Gill scored a goal for the first time since Jan. 10 against Bowling Green. Walsh, Globke and Gill scored the goals Friday, and Jason Paige and Brett Lebda scored on Saturday. 
Lebda's goal was the key Saturday, as Notre Dame came back from a 2-1 deficit to tie the game in the waning seconds. With David Brown pulled for an extra attacker, the Irish won a face-off in· their offensive zone. Neil Komadowski took a shot from the center point that was blocked. The puck hopped into the air.
