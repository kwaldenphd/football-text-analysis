Black Studies questioned 

by John Abowd 
One hundred black students led by Dr. Jospeh Scott, director of thz Black Studies Program, presented Fr. Burtchaell with a proposal for a , "Black Studies Department and a Division of Black Student Affairs" yesterday in the Provosts office. 
Scott the principal author of theproposal, indicated that he and the students expect>:<ed a response from the administration by "noon Friday". 
"I want to know and the students want to know if the administration is going to allocate money fro a Black Studies faculty because if they're not then I'm cut of a job and i I want to know, on theline," Scott sadi said. 
The proposald calls the current systei)l of hiring faculty for programs "counter-productive" because the final decisions lie with the department heads and a program chairman has only the power ofpersuasion.

Chambers said that students will have to be kicked out of the towers because these halls are more attractive than the other halls so fewer people want to move out. These halls also have been used as depositories by outcasted students from other halls.

It IS 1n the blue corner 

by Terry Shields 
Observer Sports Editor 
Of the twenty semi-final bouts on last night's Bengal card 18 of these were won by the man in the Blue corner. However, one of the lucky gold winners was the biggest upset of the tournament. Defending champ in 165 Roland Chamblee was the victim of a fired-up Norm Barry and this was the highlight of the 40th annual Bouts last night at the Convo. 
Barry's last punch of the match turned out to be the clincher as he knocked the South Bend Mauler down. It was a split decision. 
The only other gold corner winner was Ed Carney who won on a TKO over Gary Hunt. Hunt wanted to continue in the first round but Dominic Napolitano the head of the Bengals, made a wise decision in not permitting the fight to go on.

Griffin and Larry Samerad mixed it up pretty good for three rounds and Griffin won over the counter-punching Samerad by unanimous decision. Jerry Bradley won by the closest of margins over a tough Charlie Gabian. This was also unanimous. 
Jamie "Kahuna" Egan was stripped of any chance to win the 135lb. title as quick Pat McGrath out boxed the Kahuna. McGrath is very impressive for a fresh­man. Mike Loughery decked Matt Cavanaugh in o the other match in this divi~Ion but Cavanaugh made a gusty comeback that just wasn't enough to sway the judge's decision. It was unanimous for Doughery. 
Tom Kress and Charlie MOrrison hooked up in a real slugfest in the 140 lb. class and Kress came away with a very bloddy unanimous decision. In the other 140 match, Simon Kovalik lost by a narrow margin to Steve Duffy. Both fighters were even in the first and third rounds but Duffy got the better of Kovalik in Round 2 and with this went the unanimous decision. 
Gary Canori came out swinging from the start in the rugged 145 class and he and Tom Sykes hammered away for three rounds with Canori scoring big on a technical knockout. The decision was unanimous. 
In a match that may very well have had the best two boxers in the entire tournament, it was Tom Suddes by unanimous decision over a rugged Dave Pemberten. Suddes scored big and evaded Pemberton's power in rounds one and two and this led to his victory.

Tom's brother Mike Suddes won his 150 lb. with a hit and run match against Tom Bole. The decision was unanimous. Jim Lusk will be Suddes' foe in the finals on the merits of his close but unanimous win over Mike Harrington. 
Aaron Baker out-boxed Scott 
Gleason in all three rounds to 
take the 155 semi-final. The Mad 
Turk won on a split decision. 
Lance Corey turned out to be the 
surprise of the 155 lb. class. He 
slugged it out with defending 
champ Kevin Kerrigan for three 
rounds and although the tough 
Kerrigan won by unanimous 
decision, Corey had nothing to be 
ashamed of with his per­
formance. He came to box. 
Tom O'Hearn took a 
unanimous decision over Val 
Bernabe in the 165 bout. O'Hearn 
scored on Bernabe early and held 
off the determined Val's late 
charge to win it. Carney was the 
other winner of this class. 
Mark McGowan had to win the 
award as the Tiger of the night. 
The Chicagoan came out 
swinging from the heels o 
the opening bell. He punished a 
tough Nike Maloni for three 
rounds in taking his unanimous 
decision. He will fight upset 
winner Norm Barry on Friday. 
In another of the evening's 
closer fights Mike Burns built an 
early lead and warded off the 
charges of Jack Ragusa to take 
the split decision. Another upset 
of sorts occurredioccured in this 
same 175 division. Dennis Clark 
used a gutsy display of boxing to 
beat Byron King, a knockout 
winner in the opening night, by a 
unanimous decision. 
In the heavyweight class Bob 
Minnix used his quickness to get 
the better of Pat Marcello in the 
few flurries that occurred. 
Minnix fought intelligently, as he 
hit and ran to get the split 
decision. 
Matt Connelly, the other 
heavyweight, pummelled Bob 
Moorman for three rounds but 
the amazing Moorman took all of 
Connelly's best blows and stayed 
standing. This in in itself was a 
feat although Connelly was 
awarded a unanimous decision.

I remember the first time I saw that group of guys in a ball game. 
They were only freshmen at the time, but they were still good enough 
to whip a Notre Dame varsity team that won 21 games and placed 
third in the NIT. They were rlly comething 
It doesn,t seem like frou yars have passed since those first nights 
when "the best freshmen team in the nation, used to put on an 
exhibition against the Irish varsity. The freshmen took six outof seven 
of those exhibitions. 
gwhy, they even use 
to outdraw the varsity for some of their games. When you think aboit 
it, there was little reason why this shouldn,t have been. They were 
truly an entertaining team to watch. 
Bacc then, before he ran into so much knee trouble, Jack Meehan 
was so sharp that some felt his passes were too fakey for his team­
mates to keep up with. He was al o rugged on defense and with his 
quickness he was a constant threat to drive the lane for a bucket. 
Tom Sinnott was always an aggressive defender and he was also a 
very effective sixth man. His brilliant behind-the-back passes foten 
drew the cheers of everyone packed in the old fieldhouse. 
Jim Hinga, the Muncie Milkman, whould have bought a ticket for 
most of those games. He spent more time diving into the close crowd 
after loose balls than he did on the court. 
John Pleick, when dressed in those old green visiting uniforms, won 
the title of the Jolly Green Giant. Opponents didn,t see much to b jolly 
aboit when Big grohn cleared the bords, however. 
It seems that even then, Collis Jones was scoring 22.5 points a game 
and grabbing his twelve rebounds. He never won much praise from 
anyone, he was always taken for granted. He hasn,t missed a game 
since joining the varsity and something tells me that if he did miss a 
gme, he woild finally be appreciated by everyone. 
Another notable figure back in those dabs of the "the Murphy steal, 
the "Dixie jumper, was the mysterious big man that always sat on 
the freshmen bench. He was dressed sharply in trutlenecks and 'Glen 
plaid slacks bit he never dressed in uniform for thse games. All anyone 
knew of this 6,8, individual was tht he played center versus Lew 
Alcindor in high school and his was the only team that could mke the 
statemnt tht they won against the Power Memorial myth. Sid has 
shown moments since then which makes you understand why he ws so 
highly tooted. 
And then there was AVUSTIN Carr, always with his shirt tail oit, 
always hustling, always urging on his teammates to greater heights, 
and always playing backtball the way it was meant to be played to 
~~00. ' 
It,s been foir years since all thse things happened yet nothing much 
hs really changed. Oh sire, there,s been some disappointments along 
the way. Often the team had those bad nights when nothing seemed to 
go right. Weg,ll always remember the loss to Miami in the first round 
in the ,69 NCAA,s and the Kntuckh gme last year was anothr heart­
breaker. 
But somehow, I forget aboit these things when I remembr that Notre 
Dame has one I t chance to show why theh were tagged "best freshmen 
t earn in the nation., Tonight is the la t time tht many of us will ever 
see Austin, Collis, Sid, Jackie, Tom, Jim, and Big John on the court 
as a team. Th~y have provided u with many thrills over the fo ur year 
hre and ~.m Sire ~ht.the ~tudent body recognizes this and tht they,ll 
show their appreciation with a tremendous ovation for each man. 
There is also one other man who deserves an ovation. Unfortunately 
few pople appreciate what he hs done for ND nd the ba 
program here and it,s qiite possible that he will not receive a favorable 
welcome. To do this woild be one of the most bush manuevers that the . Notre Dame students have ever put forth. 
. John Dee ha~ put Notre Dame basketball on the map. He hs taker 
his teams to fmr tournaments in a row. HVE HAS SCHEDULED THE 
FINEST COI_V~PETITION ~OSSIBL~. His team earned a bid as justly 
as any team m the NCAA field. Now It comes to light th what Dee had 
on his mind when he made sich a schedule. Almost half of the teams in 
the tournament have appeared on th Notre Dame schedule an 
the Irish proved tht they are capable of staying with any on them. On a 
ne utral court the resilts may well be different the second time around. 
But tonight the pressure i off th Irish for once. Theh can go oit on 
th at Convo floor for one la t time and play the game in th way that has 
come to be known as Notre Dame basketball. 
Sid mah goaltend, he mah blocc some shots, he may even dunk and 
the crowd will love it. Collis will once again get tht workmanlik~ 22.5 
wheel and deal on the fast breaks and he,ll rack up ten more assists, 
and he,ll know tht part of the cheering that follows a score will be for 
the ~erfect _Pass he,s ju t thrown. Jim Hinga, if he,s able to play 
becaise of his unfortunate injury will hustle as though he invented the 
term. When Jim mkes tht one great save hell hear aboit it. Tom 
Sinnott is going to bomb a few of tho e long one-h~nders and for once he 
ca!l receive the applause tht he deserves. John Pleick may not score 20 
pomts ~nd he may not grab 15 reboinds bit his picks and his steady 
anchormg on defense are always cheered by his teammates. Tonight 
the students ought to show that they know something aboit basketball 
and give John the encoiragement he seserves for doing "the dirty
work ... 
I don,~ thin~ I,ll have to mention Austin Carr. He does a fine job of 
thatby_ his actions. There are some things words can,t express, but 1 
hope I can speak for the whole student body when 1 say ''thanks 
fellows,, for four exciting years of basketball. '
