Chair of the Student Senate minority aiTairs eommitteP Hhna Boyd presented a resolution calling for the creation of a committee under tho Ol'lke of the Provost that would investi­gate how best to incorporate "cultural competencies" into the Notre Dame curricula. She clar­ified the scope and purpose of the resolution beforn members weighed in on its importance. 
The committee's members will be drawn from various groups on campus and will include students, faculty and administrative rnprnsnntativns. 
"We want to form a commit­tee to investigate how to lim~or­porate cuI tural corn potencies into the classroom),'' Boyd said. "One issue that has come up is the no(~d for a diversity rnquire­ment, but this docs not suggest a diversity requirement as the b(~St way to do this. it just asks, what is best way to incorporatP ldiversityl?

INSIDE COLUMN 
Finals week: 
Chrishnas 

has arrived 
The definition of the "holiday sea­sou" seems to get progressively hazier with each year that passes. I realized this when I saw my first Christmas-themed commercial this year before Halloween. Since that fateful commer­cial, I have done Molly Griffin two things. Firstly, I have 
assistant
suffered from what I call 
scene editor 
"Christmas rage" because of the winter holidays being forcefully pushed on me pre-Halloween. And secondly, partially in response to this passive aggressive Christmas anger, I have thought long and hard about when the holidays should actually start and when they official­ly start for me. 
It seems that retailers would essentially like people to think of the holiday season as, well, basically the whole year. They restrain them­selves and usually wait until after Halloween to put out the Christmas decorations. Television stations start pushing holiday commercials before llalloween and holiday movies before Thanksgiving. 
Basically, I only have one rule for when the holiday season should ide­ally begin. I believe that the holiday season should not start before any other holiday, specifically Halloween and Thanksgiving. Inklings of the holidays can begin to creep in around Thanksgiving, but should be limited to the last two weeks of November. Christmas decorations should not supplant Halloween cos­tumes or Pilgrim hats in stores. No exceptions. 
With that, I also feel that even dur­ing the technical "holiday season," you can feel less than spirited. When Christmas starts creeping in around October, you start to either get tired of it or get so used to it that it seems like a normal part of your life instead of a few special weeks. 
I firmly believe that each person has a few rituals that make them feel like the holidays have finally started. In high school, it didn't feel like Christmas until my family and I braved the wilds outside of Reno, NV and cut our annual Christmas tree. 
Now that I'm in college, my "fami­ly" traditions have become a little bit different. The first night of bone­chilling, lung-stabbing cold makes me start thinking about the holidays. The first ugly-Christmas-sweater party makes me feel a little more festive. 
But it's really finals week that puts me in the holiday mood. It makes you appreciate your friends, because they can help you procrastinate. It allows you to enjoy good food, like Huddle candy for breakfast, pizza for any meal and caffeine all day. It also helps you appreciate the real reason for the season, religion, because who doesn't pray during finals week?

Cabbie bites off finger in dispute about crowding 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark -A taxi driver in Denmark bit off the tip of a 48-year-old man's finger in a brawl over how many people could fit in the cab, police said Monday.

Police said things got out of hand when the 37 -year-old driver insisted he could only take four passengers. It was not dear who started the fight, but the 48-year-old man claims he grabbed the driver by the collar after the

"I haven't talked to anyone who thinks it's a good idea," Dennis said, referring to the potential the University would change eertain parts of the Queer Film Festival.

unrecognized gay/straight stu­dent group AllianceND said Monday that the issue of aca­demic freedom at Notre Dame made her "a little nervous." 
Notre Dame's definition of academic freedom "should be consistent with !that of] other universities," Gomberg said. 
While AllianceND is not an official sponsor of the Queer Film Festival, Gomberg said the group has traditionally sup­ported event. 
"I think the Queer Film Festival is well within the boundaries of academic free­dom and is a huge asset to the University and the community at large," Gomberg said. 

History professor Gail Bederman said according to American Association of University Professors (AAUP) guidelines, performances and fllm showings for students are covered under aeademic free­dom. 
While Bederman said she did not know about the specifics of this year's Queer Film Festival or the discussions, she said Monday that these film show­ings would be no except to the AAUP's Statement on Profession Ethics, which reads: "As citizens engaged in a pro­fession that depends upon free­dom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote condi­tions of free inquiry and to fur­ther public understanding of academic freedom." 
The AAUP's guidelines are not regulations, so Notre Dame is not required to stand by this generalization. 

But controversy surrounding the Queer Film Festival raises questions about Notre Dame's own guidelines, she said. 
"It certainly is an issue of academic freedom," Bederman said.

which all students must move their vehicles out of the Regina Lot. 
Chapman said this was part of the agreement with the administration. 
"If students do not comply, they will again have tp move their cars out of the entire lot at the designated times," Chapman said. 
This past week alone, there were several special events held on campus. Chapman said students were informed via e-mail and poster notices in the residence halls of such events and their repercus­sions on parking. 
Police officers were instructed to ticket vehicles that did not comply with the special events policy of park­ing restrictions. 
Chapman said only six tick­ets were written. 
"I would like to commend and thank the students of Saint Mary's for complying with the instructions," Chapman said. "I believe that if they continue to cooperate, they will be allowed to park in the lot permanently." 
The amount of ticketing, even with the new policy, is average in comparison with other years, Chapman said. 
Students who have cars on campus enjoy having the option to park in Hegina, especially with the harsh weather. 
"I'm happy that [security] opened up the Regina Lot," said freshman Brooke Postregna. "It is closer than the main [Angela] lot and a lot more convenient now that it's getting a lot colder."

First witnesses testify at Hussein trial 
Accounts offer gruesome details; defense walks out on judge's refusal 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD. Iraq -The first witnesses in the Saddam Hussein trial offered chilling accounts Monday of killings and tor­ture using eleetrie shoeks and a grinder during a 1982 eraekdown against Shiites, as the defiant ex­prosident threatened the judge and tried to intimi­date a survivor. 
One witness said he saw a maehine that 'looked like a grinder with hair and blood on it in a seeret police cen­ter' in Baghdad where he and others were tortured for 70 days. lin said detainees were kept in "Hall 63." 
But defense lawyers questioned the reliability of' witnesses who were only 15 and 10 at the time and walked out of' the tumul­tuous session when the judge refused to allow for­mer U.S. Attorney General Hamsey Clark to address the eourt on Saddam's behalf. They returnod after the judge relented.

Judge will not toss serious DeLay charges 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN. Texas-A judge dismissed a eonspiraey charge Monday against Hep. Tom DeLay but refused to throw out the far more serious allegations of money-laundering, dashing the eon­grossman's hopes for now of redaim­ing his post as House majority leader. 
Texas Judge Pat Priest, who is pro­siding over the ease against the Hnpublican, issued the ruling after a hearing latn last month in which DeLay's attorney argued that the indietment was fatally flawed. 
When he was indicted in September, DeLay was required under House rules to relinquish the leadership post he had held since 2003. While Monday's ruling was a partial victory for DeLay, he eannot redaim his post beeause he remains under indictment. 
The ruling means the ease will move toward a trial next year, though other defense objections to the indictments remain to be heard by the judge. 
"The court's deeision to dismiss Honnie Earle's numerous charges against Mr. DeLay underscores just how baseless and politieally motivated the charges were," DeLay spokesman Kevin Madden said, referring to the Democratie district attorney who brought the ease. 
"Mr. DeLay is very encouraged by the swift progress of the legal pro­ceedings and looks forward to his eventual and absolute exoneration based on the facts and the law." 
DeLay declined to speak with reporters shortly after the judge's dedsion as he entered a Houston hotel for a campaign fundraiser. 
In a written statement, Earle's olliee 
said prosecutors were studying the ruling and had made no decision about whether to appeal. 
Earle has 15 days to appnal the dndsion. 
DeLay, 58, and two <;op l'undraisnrs, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, are aeeused of illegally funneling $190,000 in corporate donations to 2002 Hepublican eandidatns for thn Tnxas Lngislature. Under Texas law, eorporatn money cannot bo directly used for political campaigns, but il ean be used for administrative pur­posns. 
In asking that the caso bn thrown out, DeLay lawyer Dick DnGuorin argued that one of the eharg11s -con­spiraey to violate the Texas nlnclion eode -did not evm1 take niTnet until Seplembor 2003, a year aftnr tho alleged oll"ensns oceurrnd.

according to an e-mail sent to Saint Mary's students. 
Berlo said this year's student ticket allotment is more than that of the Gator Bowl in 2003 and more than the Fiesta Bowl in 2000, as the ticket office is expecting higher student demand. But at the same time, Berlo said his office cannot pre­dict what exactly the demand will be and if the 2,500 tickets avail­able to students will be enough or too much. 
"It's tough to say [what the demand is going to bel," Berlo said. "All of our indicators of demand -student and non-stu­dent -are very high at this point. With higher demand, we increase the number of tickets available to students." 
Berlo said the rest of the 15,000 tickets allotted to Notre Dame, a number he said was a standard bowl allotment, goes to alumni, the athletic department, the team, University administrators, parents of students, Monogram Club members and benefactors. 
He also said the University is trying to obtain more tickets for students. If this endeavor is suc­cessful, students could hear as early as Dec. 14, according to the email.

"My opinion is you [hadJ better get it right because there are a lot of people who need this money," Hall Presidents Council co-chair Dan Zenker said. "If it's going to be $40,000, it should be done the proper way." 
Zenker suggested that, unless clubs needed their reallocated funds immediately, the budget be sent back to FMB for further con­sideration. 
"[Sending the budget back to FMBI would hurt as far as SUB, and therefore the student body, is concerned," SUB president Jimmy Flaherty said. "I think it would be a hug~ error to slow this process down. 
Flaherty noted that SUB's pend­ing contracts -including some for events as early as mid-February­cannot be finalized without the budget reallocations. 
Marshall agreed that a proce­dural revamping would benefit future reallocations but suggested that COR approve the current budget revisions. 
"The process is certainly not what it should be, but to prevent the reallocation would be against from various sources," Berlo said. "If we're able to do that, we would go ahead and e-mail out additional winning lottery num­bers." 

Should students win the lottery, they are able to purchase tickets on Thursday from 7 a.m. to 4 
p.m. for $85 each, payable in cash or check only. Students are allowed to bring four different winning IDs on Thursday of peo­ple with whom they want their tickets. Berlo said the lottery sys­tem was implemented to make things easier for students. 
"In order to minimize the amount of time student<> are wait­ing in line, we elected to go with a lottery system," he said. 
According to Ohio State's Web site, their ticket allotment will be distributed through a lottery, but students and faculty will not obtain their tickets until they arrive at the Fiesta Bowl. There, they present a claim voucher that states they have a ticket and their student or faculty ID, according to the release. Should they win the lottery, Ohio State students have the opportunity to purchase one ticket. 
The Fiesta Bowl will be played in Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz., capacity of 73,379, accord­ing to Arizona State. Sun Devil Stadium is the home of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals and the Arizona State football team.

everybody's best interests at this point," he said. 
While FMB may have issues with its reallocation procedures, these do not involve members' considerations of their feelings about each student group, Marshall said, adding that the Student Union's funds must be allocated in such a way that stu­dents will gain the most. 
"It's not an easy process because people's feelings do need to be taken into consideration," Marshall said. "Ifpeople think stu­
dents will benefit 
from 

possibly having a monthly or fbi-monthly] spending review like this where money can be taken away and reallocated accordingly," Marshall said. "It doesn't seem to be the best way to meet just once in the middle of the year." 
Student Body president Dave Baron emphasized that the approval of this series of realloca­tions does not close the door for future revisions of the reallocation process. 
"In the constitution, it says FMB is responsible for budget realloca­tion, but it doesn't have to be just once a month," Baron said. "We're not solidifying the way budgets are approved." 
The budget was approved with 10 votes in favor, one opposed and one abstention.

meaning of "cultural compe­tencies," and CLC members expressed the same concerns -knowing that if the resolu­tion passed, it would be sent to the Faculty Senate. Dillon Hall rector Father Paul Doyle pre­dicted those faculty members would probably not be satisfied with such a vague term. 
''I'm willing to vote for this, but people will want a tighter definition of cultural compe­tencies somewhere along the way," Doyle said. "Professors want to define your terms, that might slow things down, but 
the spirit is something we can embrace." 
Boyd clarified the meaning of cultural com­petencies calling them "a specific range of skill, knowl­edge and abili­ty". 
"This was not a random choice of words," Boyd 
"{The word] 'cultural' is meant to be a bit vague ... We know it needs to be something that surrounds culture in general." 
Rhea Boyd chair minority affairs committee Student Senate 

said. "(The word] 'cultural' is meant to be a bit vague. This committee can define cultural -whether it refers to marginal­ized groups, the arts or [Film, Television and Theater] cours­es," Boyd said. "We know it needs to be something that surrounds culture in general." 
Satisfied with Boyd's answer, the members passed the reso­lution with one abstention. It will be discussed and voted on in the Faculty Senate tonight. 
Members of the social con­cerns task force still faced criti­cism when they presented a revised version of a resolution that called for more specific training for hall staff involving non-Catholic ministries. 
The resolution stems out of a perceived lack of attention paid to non-Catholic student faith options during this year's hall staff training. The resolution was met with opposition when it faced the Council on November 21. Welsh Family Hall rector Candace Carson, who is also a campus ministry commissioner, had insisted that the issue was already addressed in a variety of medi­ums, including pamphlets inside hall chapels. She prom­ised to bring up the resolution at the next campus ministry committee meeting. 
"We had a meeting on the Monday Nov. 28 and ... the concerns from the Council 
were pre­sented, and they said that they put the infor­mation 
0 u t 
through campus ministry e-mail. But each h a I I responds different­
ly," Carson said. "It was done as quickly as I could do it. I will continue to work through [campus ministry commission­ers]. They are a source on campus that should be used." 
The newly revised resolution asks that Student Affairs and Campus Ministry incorporate a presentation on resources for non-Catholic students during their spring rector gatherings ­instead of a separate workshop the original resolution called for. It also called for Campus Ministry to pay greater atten­tion to the issue during its presentation to hall staff in the fall. 
The resolution still faced 
doubt from several members. 
"It is seemingly ironic that we're talking about having entities that have offered infor­mation in this regard, like Campus Ministry, and asking them to do more when they seem to be the entities that have done the most," Carroll Hall rector Father Jim Lewis said. "I don't see any student initiative in this regard." 
Diversity council representa­tive and social concerns task force member Joyce Randall claimed that Campus Ministry was targeted because "obvi­ously there is a breakdown in getting the information [on non-Catholic initiatives! out there." 
Members also expressed fur­ther doubt about word choice and vagueness in the resolu­tion -resulting in a back and forth debate on how best to express its intent and meaning. 
Though Badin Hall rector Ann Napoli claimed that the resolution was calling for 15 or 20 minutes to be spent on non­Catholic resources as part of Campus Ministry's hall staff presentation, some members believed that the wording implied the need for a separate and distinct presentation. 
"We do want some intention­al ambiguity," Pasquerilla West Hall Senator Christina Lee said. "We don't want it to be like 'do this in this format.' We want them to figure out what they deem is the best way. It's more of a suggestion." 
The Council then voted to amend the resolution in order to clarify the type of presenta­tion as one that would be incorporated into the overall campus ministry presentation during hall staff training. 
The Council passed the amended resolution with two members opposed.

IN BRIEF 
Cardiologist criticizes Merck & Co. 
IIOUSTON -A prominent cardiologist testi­l'ying against Merek & Co. accused the drug­maker Saturday of engaging in sdentilic mis­conduct, supprnssing clinical evidcncn and sti­rling nwdical discourse as it promoted tho painkillnr Vioxx. 
Dr. l·:ric Topol, dmirman-of the cardiovascu­lar nwdieine department of the Cleveland Clink, called certain aspects of Merck's behav­ior "repulsive" and "appalling" during his tlm~e-hour videotaped deposition. 
Topol said Vioxx can cause heart atlacks any lime aftnr a patient begins taking it, and that its risks wnrn apparent as early as 1999, wlwn the drug was approved. Vioxx was rnmoved from thn market last year after a study shownd it doublnd patients' risk or heart attacks and strokns after 18 months of use. 
"Vioxx's risk has been evident since trails 


were conducted in 1999 and all the way through thn time of withdrawal in September :w, 2004," Topol said. 
This is tho first federal trial over Vioxx; Merck has already lost one state trial over the drug and won anothnr, but it still faces about 7,000 lawsuits and analysts estimate its liabil­ity eould reach $50 billion.

Boston Scientific offers $25 billion to Guidant 


Amount tops previous Johnson & Johnson bid by more than $3 million 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Troubled Guidant Corp. drew a $25 billion offer Monday from medical device rival Boston Scientific Corp., topping Johnson & Johnson's watered-down bid by more than $3 billion. 
Guidant's once flagging stock rose $6.16, or nearly 10 percent, to close at $67.98 amid Wall Street's speculation of a bidding war. 
But market analysts said that J&J, which did not return repeated phone calls for comment, may not want Guidant badly enough to spend billions more for the Indianapolis-based maker of pacemakers, dnfibrillators and other devices which has been plagued by a series of recalls and by related reg­ulatory investigations. 
It was just three weeks ago that Guidant accepted a revised $21.5 billion pro­posal from J&J and stopped suing the health care products company to dose on a year-old acquisi­tion oll'cr of $25.4 billion. 
Boston Scientific, whose products include the top­selling cardiac stent Taxus, oll'ered Guidant a combina­tion of eash and stoek worth about $72 per Guidant share -a 16 per­cent premium over Friday's elose. The prospect of entering the lucrative $10 billion international market for implantable pacemak­ers and defibrillators out­weighed Guidant's recent legal and regulatory woes. 
"The primary driver of our proposal is to increase Boston Seientilic's diversili­eation and grow our ear­diac-rhythm management business," Boston Scientilic's chief operating officer, Paul LaViolette, said in a telephone inter­view. 

Guidant's original deal with .J&.J bogged down amid a series of recalls and warnings affecting nearly 200,000 pacemakers and about 88,000 defibrillators since June. Dozens of shareholder and product liability lawsuits have ensued, costing Guidant more than a quarter of its value. Its stock plummeted to a low of $55.26 last month. 
"We understand there have been some recent issues, but we believe they are manageable," LaViolette said. "We are 
experienced with these issues." 
Guidant's strengths out­weigh its problems for Boston Scientific, which has seen its profits dwindle recently, Jefferies & Co. analyst Hyan Rauch said. 
"Guidant would shore up Boston Scientific's 2008 pipeline, if they're willing to take signilicant dilution to their shares in the short­term," Rauch said. 
Hauch said he did not expect Guidant's share­holders would embrace J&J's offer over Boston Scientific's, given the pre­mium and the frayed rela­tions betwenn Guidant and .J&.J. Hauch said .J&.J was not likely to sweetnn its ofl'tlr. 
"There's no love lost betwenn Guidant and .J&.J," Hauch said. "I believe .1&.1 will not come back into the dance at a higher price." 
The Boston Scientific offer consists or $36 in cash and $36 worth of its shares for nach share of Guidant stock . .J&.J is ofl'er­ing $:B.25 in cash and 
0.493 share of Johnson & Johnson common stock for each Cuidant share. 

Turmoil In actor union could lead to split 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -The largest union representing actors has promised a new, tougher stance in contract talks with powerful media eonglomerates. 
But the Screen Actors Guild may self-destruct before it ever gets the chance. 
The labor union's long-running infighting has escalated into what could become a mutiny after the elec­tion in September of SAG President Alan Hosenberg. 
Hosenberg and his allies gained a majority on the national board by pledging to squeeze more money from the studios from the sale of DVDs and new technologies, including download­ing of lilms and TV shows. He also pledged to unite SAG's feuding fae­tions. 
Instead, Hosenberg, 55, divided the union even more by almost immedi­ately firing popular SAG national exec­utive director Greg llessinger. He had been hired by the previous leadership, which Hosenberg accused of surren­dering too easily on key economic issues in contract talks last year. 
Many union members see the firing as an arrogant display of power by Hosenberg that could finally split the union into two groups -one that rep­resents film and TV actors, primarily based in Hollywood, and another mostly comprised of members in New York, Chicago and elsewhere who do commercials and voieeovers. 
Paul Christie, president of SAG's New York branch, said talk of a split has heated up since the election of Hosenberg, who was a regular on the TV series "LA Law" and "The Guardian," and is married to "CSI" star Marg Helgenberger. 
"I think he's eapable of better things," Christie said. 
With 120,000 members, SAG has always been a fragmented labor 
union, representing both multimillion­aire superstars and rank-and-file membership with an unmnployment rate of more than 80 percent. 
Membership in the union is all but required to work in lilms. television and commercials. Many SAG members also belong to the American Federation of Television and Hadio Artisl'i, which has jurisdiction over tlw prime-time schedule of major net­works, among other areas. 
Hosenberg's agenda mirrors that of the newly elected prosident of the Writers Guild of America, west. Patrie Verrone also ran on a promise to got tougher with studios and also fired his executive director soon after taking office. 
Both men justified the firings by say­ing they needed staiT who would push their agendas of incrnasing member­ship, fighting the rise of reality TV shows and gaining more eeonomie concessions from studios.

It is often typical of the Left to extol the virtues of a great society: a great society takes care of the elderly and the poor; it educates its children and pays for medical treatment. 
These sentiments are well and good until one attempts to ascertain from a left-winger how exactly society accomplishes such eleemosynary goals; because (as I am often quick to point out), left-wingers hardly mean "socie­ty" when they speak the word. 
When the Left speaks of society "taking care" of the people, it does not imply society itself; it refers instead to the welfare state and its many tendrils: Social Security, public schooling, universal healthcare -social programs that are funded via compulsory taxation by the govern­ment. 
Government is not society. In fact, Thomas Paine agreed with me when he said: "Society in every state is a bless­ing, but government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil." Society is the voluntary cooperation and coexis­tence of individuals; government is the involuntary subjugation of some indi­viduals to the will of others. Now, I am not necessarily claiming that every gov­ernment is inherently oppressive, but merely that any government without a gun is just another interest group. 
This distinction is important because every social end enumerated by the Left must be accomplished by govern­mental coercion. Indeed, both the Left and Right embrace a certain paternal­ism when it comes to the actions of "society": whether it be gratis medical treatment, smoking bans, the War on Drugs or the persecution of "obscene" materials, the nanny-state is a neces­sary component.

Let us therefore address the former: government-subsidized health care. I will not even attempt to delve deeply into the details of this complicated issue, but will instead focus my ener­gies on the elementary paternalism that is inherent in it. 
In the United States, we have (as of yet) avoided the catastrophe that is "socialized health care." What we have instead are Medicare and Medicaid ­complex bureaucratic institutions that, in effect, reimburse elderly, disabled and poor people for many medical services (including treatments for, among other dubious things, erectile dysfunction). 
According to the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, Michael F. Cannon, "Medicare spending is increasing at twice the rate of the· gross domestic product" and the new Medicare prescription drug plan is slat­ed to "cost more than $700 billion over the next 10 years." As mismanaged as any government program can be, Medicare faces a budget shortfall of as much as $62 trillion-that is, the gov· ernment promises $62 trillion more than it can deliver to beneficiaries. Today, the government collects slightly more than $2 trillion in total taxes. 
That is quite the shortfall. 

But suppose people are abusing alco­hol and tobacco, or eating so unhealth­ily that America continues her reign as one of the most obese nations in the world. Americans suffer from heart dis­ease, high blood pressure, high choles­terol, diabetes and myriad other ail­ments that stem from our obsession with eating poorly. 
At this point, the government still has some options: it can cut Medicare bene· fits (and sacrifice the political future of Republicrat politician X who would support such actions), or it can raise taxes by about, say, 1,500 percent. 
But the real, philosophically central question is: if the government is already paying too much for the care of Americans, does it have the right to force its citizens to be healthier in order to reduce its medical expendi­tures? Beginning in 2006, Medicare will cover preventive health screenings, lending credence to the notion that a few hundred billion dollars of preven­tion is worth $62 trillion of cure. 
So to avoid the impending Medicare crisis that is at hand, should acting unhealthily be made illegal? 
I have heard it argued before, believe it or not. Originally I believed it to be a joke, but upon further reflection, it seems perfectly reasonable. I have a vested interest in keeping you healthy, since I am forced by my government-at some point or another-to pay for your medieal bills. 
Such is the paternalism implicit in the government business or health care. Socializing health effectively destroys the lines that delineate what is your personal choice and what afl'ects me. Subsidies give society a controlling stake in what you do with your own body, where your health is no longer merely your concern. 
In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court mat­ter-of-factly stated that subsidized pro­grams "have almost always been accompanied by varying measures of control and surveillance." It is not beyond reasonable doubt, therefore, that government control and surveil­lance of health in America will soon become even more omnipresent­even more so than it is today. 
No, I do not believe McDonald's should be illegal. However, when "soci­ety" owns your body, there are few -if any -realistic options left. 
Like I said: $62 trillion is quite the shortfall.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Communion: not a time for politics 
In the Doe. 5 issue of The Observer, Matthew Hamilton rigorously dofendod his ehoiee to wear the orange "Gay? Fino by Me" shirt to Mass on Sunday. lin defends him­self by arguing the illegitimacy and destructive nature of thn Vatican's mueh-publieized statement. lie eontinues by saying that far from being inappropriate at Mass, sud1 a showing sends a message of communion and par­tkipall~s in tho radical naturn of the Eucharist. After all, lw says, calling his action a degradation or profanation of the 1\ueharisl. "prnsupposns that polities is inherently vulgar and that the s<u:raments have nothing to do with thn r·eal world." lie says that, divided from religion, political lifi~ is shorn of its mystery, and that we should "rnjm:t this ruthless division between politics and Communion." 
I apprndatn llamillon's liwvor in this matter. I appred­aln his honosly, his dosiro for a morn perfect Catholic Church. for lrun Communion and li1r rneognilion of the fallacy of lhn dualistic approach to ourselvns as religious and politkal beings. llowever, I disagree with his pri­mary nwthod of making a point. This has nothing to do with the issue of homosexuality, either in general, or in light of the Vatican's stat1mwnt. Any similar action fea­turing a shirt that loudly condonnd the Church's docu­mnnt should also receive disapproval. What is at issue horn is the lloly Saeriliee of the Mass, not rules and reg­ulations. 
Wn all recognize a cnrlain ordnr of propriety in life. Corlain things are fitting at enrtain times, but not at oth­ers. What llamilton did not reeognize in his comments is that, although there should not be a divide between our love of God and love of neighbor, or between theological hmehing and social teaching, that is not to say that the Mass is on an equal footing with politics. If our various religious beliefs had no superiority to the state, there would be no problem with state religions. Churches could welcome political campaigners to deliver some election year slogans. The core belief's of any person could be dictated by the opinion of the majority. llowever, it was the intentions of the founders of the United States to guarantee that religion would always be beyond the reach of the state. And rightly so. Christ him­self, while recognizing the legitimatn authority of the political realm, dill'erentiates between those things that belong to God, and those that belong to Caesar. 
I encourage to Hamilton, and anyone else who feels strongly about this issue, to set up forums for discussion. I applaud llamilton for writing a letter, that's what it's there for. But please, do not eross the line between what is appropriate and what is not. Church serviees are a time for communion, after all, we call the Sacrifice of the Mass "Communion," but worship services are also a time for an individual to engage in one of the most personal acts imaginable, the dialogue of one's innermost self with his or her God. Out of respect for this, there are many customary decencies that are observed. 
Many churches have instituted erying rooms for infants. That is not because infants are not appmdated, nor considered outside of the community. llowever, since they can be distracting to others. many parishes make them available. Another courtesy is refraining from extensive affection. Again, it is a matter of decency for couples to abstain from displays of their love. Even 
though sex is praised by the Church for its holiness, it 
could beconie slightly distraeting during even the best 
homily. Clearly, if llamilton's statement at Mass was to 
be efl'ective, it must be noticed by other people and 
thereby beeome a distraction during the service. 
I don't mean to be trite about this matter. Clearly such a controversial statnmenl by the Vatiean will produce division, and lhernfom charitable and understanding dialogue is required. Throughout the history, activists and reformers have kept the Church true to the leadt­ings of Christ, and thnrn is no loss need in tho modnm world. Finally, pray1w and personal holiness is necessary that we may be as ell'ective as possible in bringing the Word of God to all pnople. llowover, in all of this. wn must recognize tho proper respect that is dun to thn wor­ship of God, and tho respnet we own others who an~ par­ticipating in tlwir own ads of worship. What. happened on Sunday took into account neithnr, and thus was a profanation and an aetion or disrnspoet to all those who 
were trying to worship. I rncognizo that llamilton 
believes the Vatican to have already crossed both of' 
those lines. but that does not l11gitimize this act. Let us 
strive to reach grnat11r understanding and communion 
with one another and with God, and let us be aware of' 
both the intended and unintended results of' our actions.

Midnight madness 
I'm that guy. 

You know the one. The guy who can tell you off the top of his head which company created which game. He's the one who plans his weekends for the next year by video game and movie release dates. 
I was there on Sept. 9, 1999 when the Sega Dreamcast was released at midnight. I waited in a line for my chance at obtaining the first of the third-generation of consoles, knowing I would have to be up in less than six hours to get ready for school. "Soul Calibur" made sure that having to get up never occurred. 
I was there on March 24, 2005 when the Sony PSP was also released at midnight. I had pre-ordered it months beforehand, fully paying off the sys­tem and several games well before they were released and reviewed. Six 
a.m. came very quickly, as I played that tiny machine until the wee hours of the morning. Getting sick due to lack of sleep was only a minor detail, as it gave .me the opportunity to play "Twisted Metal" a little more. 
And I was there Nov. 22 for the mid­night release of the Microsoft X-Box 
360. Excitement was high in the tiny shop as the seconds ticked closer to the time the system could be sold. The first of the next generation, the fabled fourth tier of video-gaming, had my brother and me wide-eyed with antici­pation. 
But then our enthusiasm began to damper. A number of things led into this, I suppose. Perhaps the first sign was the bill, which totaled well over $500. It is one thing to be aware of what something will cost, but quite another when the time comes to hand the money over. 
The second was the rarity of the complimentary hardware. Ever since the arcade games of yore has the value of playing-with a friend been realized, and then compounded by games like "Goldeneye" and "Halo." But as the cashier was ringing up the 


purchase, there was a conspicuous 
absence of a specific accessory. So I 
went home that night with a solitary 
controller. 
But then that is where the real dis­
appointment set in. My brother and I 
quickly hooked up the X-Box 360 to 
my television, fervently waiting for 
what the next generation of gaming 
was going to bring. 
As we started to play through "Perfect Dark Zero," a feeling of deja vu began to set in, and not in a posi­tive way. The next generation of gam­ing felt disturbingly similar to the last one, and for that matter, the one before that. The graphics were pretti­er, but beyond that, it wasn't the leap 
that "Halo" was from "Goldeneye," or even from "Wolfenstien 3D" to "Doom." 
Maybe I'm just jaded, or perhaps the sad fact is that games are ceasing to impress. The same games are being made that have been made before, but with a dash of new paint. 
This then begs the question -why did we do it? Why go out at midnight to spend over half-a-thousand dollars on a product that so far is pure hype with no solid review base? 
The same could be said for movies, books and all the other products that get a midnight release. There is a rea­son people go to extreme lengths to fulfill non-essential pleasures. 
There is a thrill on being at the ground floor of an event. Attending the midnight premier of a movie, or going to an event on its opening day, add a special flavor to the action. To say, f was there first, I did that, car­ries a certain satisfaction. 
But in light of my X-Box 360 adven­tures, perhaps one should be a little more conservative in what we choose to indulge.

SMC SPOTLIGHT 
Madrigal Dinners recreat 
By NICOLE ZOOK Scene Critic 
Saint Mary's kicked off the holiday sea­son last weekend with three days of "merrymaking" during its 33rd annual Madrigal Dinners. 
The four madrigal performances that occur each year carry on an age-old tra­dition in which Saint Mary's and South Bend community members are invited to partake in a medieval-style holiday feast dinner that revolves around the music of the time. 
Students and faculty worked for weeks to transform Regina North Lounge into the Great Hall of an ancient castle, where the "local rabble, peasants, serfs, field­hands and their families" could feel transported back in time -as master of ceremonies Michael Kramer described the event. 
Kramer, a communication and perform­ance studies professor, acted as Master of the House. 
On Sunday afternoon during the third performance, the kitchen wench (senior Ashleigh Stochel) and court jester (junior Tori Abram-Copenhaver) engaged in live­ly play. Two others juggled, and period musicians performed along with a group of 24 madrigal singers. 
With so many different types of enter­tainment packed into two short hours, dinner guests were kept highly enter­tained throughout. 
Notre Dame jugglers Jason Quinn and Sean Rose highlighted the night, tossing fiery pins high in the air and at one point even knocking a pencil out of the mouth of a young volunteer as they passed clubs to one another. A juggling competition during the meal drew excited "oohs," applause and even laughs from dinner guests. 
Stochel and Abram-Copenhaver also received big laughs throughout the show with good-natured hijinks such as don­ning antlers and darting through choir members as they sang about "the running of the deer" and acted out the lyrics of "Vive Ia Cookery Maid," a lighthearted piece about a girl who makes pies as heavy as lead. 
But the main focus of the event was the Madrigal Singers, an all-female group who put dinner guests in a festive, holi­day mood by singing Christmas classics such as "Here We Come A-Wassailing" and "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" as various parts of the meal were served to diners. Several guests even hummed along to the more familiar tunes as they feasted. 
Some of the group's best work was heard in period pieces and modern madrigal-style tunes such as the sweet, lilting melodies of "Patapan" and "Le Sommeil de !'Enfant Jesus" and the Polish carol "To a Baby." 
While several songs were accompanied by the Andrews University Early Music Ensemble, one of the standout perform­ances of the night was the a capella "In Dulci Jubilo." The room fell silent as the well-blended vocal ensemble weaved their melody, with not even the clink of a glass breaking the spell. 
Interestingly, the madrigal was an entirely interactive concert. The singers paraded through the hall singing directly to the audience while the actors visited tables during dinner, joking with guests. Diners even interacted with each other, gaining a sense of community as they introduced themselves and chatted with neighbors, passing bowls of food down ( the long tables. Guests and performers t alike also united in singing "Silent Night"

Pittsburgh Symphon 
By ANALISE LIPARI Scene Critic 
The sound of strings, woodwinds and brass warming up to a familiar B flat tickled the atmosphere of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's performance last Thursday night at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. The general mood of anticipation was only heightened by noting the selection of pieces that the prestigious ensemble was to present that evening. And with Rachmaninoff, Strauss and Sibelius played to near perfec­tion, it was an evening of masterful artistry. 
With guest conductor Hans Graf at the helm, the PSO was truly remarkable. Their level of professionalism, talent and style was of the highest caliber, and witnessing their concert was undoubtedly one of the most exceptional joys of the semester. 
The first piece performed, Richard Strauss' tone poem, "Don Juan," was a bright and energetic opening for the concert. The piece, first performed in 1889, uses a featured selection of instruments to tell the familiar tale of Don Juan through music. Flute, bas­soon, harp and timpani are among the instruments chosen, and the piece's varying pace· and melodies heighten those choices. 
From its vibrant opening to the more measured middle sections, the tone poem's gorgeous melodies carried the audience to the Seville of centuries past. The interesting contrast between smooth, lilting string har­monies and bright, bombastic brass and tim­pani led the audience to feel both the power and elegance of the music. Its fmal crescen­do was the height of musical force and ener­gy. 
The second piece, Sibelius' violin concerto in D minor, featured celebrated violinist Sarah Chang. Chang, a known prodigy whose credits include performing with the New York Philharmonic at eight years old, was, in a word, a wonder. Her level of skill was astronomical for the average concertgo­er to witness, and her handling of the intri­cacies of Sibelius' orchestrations was out­standing. 
The concert itself was unique in its accent­ing of the violin's solo moments with a subtle depth of complementary orchestration. The accompanying instruments provided a strong background and partnership for Chang's violin, and throughout the concert's three major themes, that balance is heard with distinction. 
The final piece performed was Rachmaninoff's "Symphony No. 2 in E minor." The suggested performance time of 50 minutes may have seemed daunting before it began, but at the closing of the fourth and final movement, it felt as though the complex, graceful and unique melodies could have continued easily until morning. 
The first movement, with its strings-heavy opening, used the mournful tones of the oboe to create an ebb and now of melody. The mood rose and fell, culminating with a surge of thunderous brass and violin. 
The subsequent movements each had a distinct personality, so to speak. The second, with a more dramatic feel, also created a balance between a feel of threatening urgency and a sensation of rising joy in its choice of notes. The third is sweeping and romantic, and the fourth, an Italian "taran­tella," closes the symphony on a triumphant note of stunning beauty. 
"The several elements ... produce the rich and sonorous tapestry appropriate for the b

The film is highly acclaimed all over the world, receiving awards from many film festivals, ineluding Best Feature Film Award at the San Diego International Film Festival and Best Picture at the Berlin International Film Festival. "Innocent Voices" has earned high praise in the United Sates, despitn its initial dini­eulty in finding an American distribu­tion company. 
"Innocent Voices" shows history's evils, raising awareness of the devas­tation war inflicts on children, but also showing the strength of the human spirit in the midst of these evils. 
The boy, Chava, struggles to main­tain a degree of normaley within his home. In the midst of frequent shoot­ings in his village, he eonstantly fears turning 12 -the age when the gov­ernment ean recruit him to fight against his nation's peasant rebels. Meanwhile, he eares for his younger brother and sister, trying to preserve their innoeenee and sheltering them from the ehaos that surrounds them. During the frequent shootings, Chava

NFL 
Tuiasosopo tnight play Sunday 
·­
Associated Press 
ALAMEDA, Calif. -Marques TtJittSOSOfH:l probabl) ''ill get his shot as Oakland's starting quarterback this week. 
Coach Norv Turner is leaning toward demoting the strug­gling Kerry Collins and plans to make his final decision before the Raiders take the practice field Wednesday to prepare for the lowly New York Jets -though it sure seems Turner has all but made up his mind. 
The coach already spoke to Collins about the potential change for Sunday's road game. 
"I wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't something we're considering strongly," Turner said Monday on the heels of the Raiders' second straight defeat and fourth loss in five games, 34-10 at San Diego. 
"We're going to look at the quarterback situation and say, 'Hey, is it time to look at Tui?'With his mobility, would that help us?" 
The 26-year-old Tuiasosopo has been a backup since the Haiders drafted him out of Washington in 2001. He start­ed one game in 2003 in place of injured 2002 MVP Hich Gannon, but hurt his knee dur­ing Oakland's third offensive series on a hard hit by Boss Bailey in a 23-13 loss at Detroit and hasn't played in a regular-season game since. 
Tuiasosopo planned to relax by playing the guitar Monday night to take his mind off Turner's decision. 
"I definitely feel like I have a better chance," Tuiasosopo said. "That's always exciting. I'll lay low for a couple more days and obviously on Wednesday we'll all know and I'll go on from there .... I wouldn't approach it any dif­ferent. There are no added expectations, no added pres­sure. When I was playing in college, I'd go out and play. Pressure is a lot of things that have nothing to do with foot­ball. I love to play football and I love to go out to compete to win." 
This preseason, Tuiasosopo 

threw for 343 yards and com­pleted 29 of his 44 passes with four interceptions and no touchdowns. He has been tak­ing snaps with the first-team offense at times and is more athletic than Collins, allowing him to move more in the pock­et. 
The fans have been calling for him to get an opportunity for weeks now, chanting "Tui! Tui!" when the offense takes the field. 
"I have nothing to say about it," receiver Jerry Porter said about the situation. "No matter who's the quarterback, I'll be OK. I've been with Marques all five years he's been here." 
After a promising start to the season, the 32-year-old Collins has lately found himself facing constant questions -just like his mistake-prone year last season -about the Raiders' ineffective offense. 
"That's a tough one," left tackle Barry Sims said of the . possible QB move. "I don't think Kerry's played in a way that suggests that he should be replaced, but at the same time, Tui's been here a long time, and hardly played at all. It would be interesting to see how he handles himself, but I don't think that Kerry should be replaced by any means. I think he's the quarterback, and it's his job. I think you can't pin the whole loss on him." 
Collins has completed 245 of his 446 passes for 3,118 yards and 16 touchdowns, but he has thrown 10 interceptions and been sacked 32 times for 194 lost yards. 
His recent struggles have been surprising after his strong start in his first full sea­son as starter. Collins didn't throw an interception until his 141st pass in Week 5 against San Diego, then didn't give up another pick for 95 more attempts. Seven of his 10 inter­ceptions have ~orne in the past four games, including three in a 31-17 home loss to Denver on Nov. 13. 
"Kerry wants to play," Turner said. "He's a competi­tor. He's a strong guy. He gives everything he's got."

University of Central
Lapchick, who Two-thirds of

heads the DeVos the bowl-bound 
Sport Business Management Program at UCF. 
This is the first year Lapchick has used the NCAA's Academic Progress Hate, known as APH, to meas­ure the bowl-bound schools' academic progress. In past years, the study has relied sole­ly on graduation rates. 
Developed last year, the NCAA's new academic standard awards APR points based on how many scholarship student­athletes meet academic eligibil­ity standards. A cutoff score of 925 means an estimated 50 percent of those student-ath­letes are on track graduate. 
Starting this year, NCAA schools that regularly fall below the 925 score can lose scholar­ships, face recruiting restric­tions and miss postseason play. 
In a dry run of the system last year, more than 90 percent of Division I teams across all sports had passing scores. According to Lapchick's report, only 33 of the 56 bowl-bound teams -59 percent -got schools graduat­
ed less than half 
of their African­
American foot­ball student-athletes. By com­parison, 49 percent of the bowl­bound schools failed to have a 50 percent graduation rate overall for those players, according to Lapchick's report. 
Lapehick praised Northwestern University and Boston College for doing the best job of graduating football players. Both teams graduated at least 78 percent of all foot­ball student-athletes and at least 74 percent of Afriean­American football student-ath­letes. 
Two conferences, the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big East, had every one of their bowl-bound schools receive an APH score higher than 925, and all the teams in both confer­enees were in the top 25 of APR rankings for bowl-bound schools. 
The Pacific 1O's five schools chosen for bowl games scored less than 925.

AP Seattle Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu celebrates after intercepting a Mike McMahon pass for a touchdown. The Seahawks had six turnovers and three defensive touchdowns in the 42-0 rout of the Eagles. 

Seaha-wks dotninate depleted Eagles 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -A cross-country trip to Philadelphia for a Monday night game in the snow hasn't exactly been a for­mula for success. Then again, these are not the same old Seattle Seahawks. 
Using big plays on defense, including inter­ception returns for touch­downs by Andre Dyson and rookie Lofa Tatupu, and smaller ones from their top-ranked offense, the Seahawks routed the Eagles 42-0. 
Neither are these the same Eagles who made the last four NFC ehampi­onship games. Philadelphia (5-7) has been torn apart by injuries and the Terrell Owens affair and played its worst game since becom­ing an NFC force in 2001. 
Certainly a better fight was expected. Yet the Seahawks (10-2) dominat­ed from the outset, win­ning their eighth straight game, tying a team record 
. set in 1984. They gained only 194 yards overall ­the Seahawks were aver­aging 386-but didn't need to do much after tak­ing a 35-0 halftime lead. Seattle, which got two short touchdowns runs from NFL rushing leader Shaun Alexander, sort of sneaked its way to the top of the conference and barely survived the New 
York Giants last week. In the Monday night spotlight, though, the NFC West champions filled the score­board. 
The only negative came when Dyson, after he returned Ryan Moats' fum­ble 25 yards for another touchdown on the first play of the second half, sprained his left ankle . Dyson was carried off the field by several team­mates. 
It was Philadelphia's worst loss since a 38-0 flop against Seattle to open the 1998 season. Indeed, as Dyson scored on his fum­ble return, the Line pretty much emptied out. The majority of fans stayed that long only because the Eagles retired Heggie White's No. 92 at halrtime. 

The Eagles, who had six turnovers, were shut out for the first time since 2003 when Tampa Bay beat them 1 7-0 in the first game in the new stadium. It was the Eagles' worst home loss since they were beaten 49-0 by Green Bay in 1962. 
And, they lost running back Brian Westbrook with a sprained foot. 
It didn't take along for Seattle's powerful offense to begin the scoring. Well, it actually took morn than eight minutes on the open­ing drive, a relentless march featuring four third­down conversions and 16 plays. 
IN BRIEF 
Clemens unsure if he will 
continue to play next year 
DALLAS --Hoger Clemens hasn't decided if he will pitch next season, again leaving the Houston Astros in a bind as they plan for 2006. 
"Today, he would retire if he had to make the decision," Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, said Monday at baseball's winter meetings. 
Hendricks added that the seven­time Cy Young Award winner, who hobbled ofT the mound after only two innings in Game 2 of the World Series against the Chicago White Sox because of a strained left hamstring, probably won't make a decision until late January or early February. 
The Astros have until Wednesday night to sign Clemens or offer him salary arbitration. Otherwise, he would not be able to re-sign with them before May 1. 
"It's the same situation we were in last year where we were uncertain as to when we would get an answer," Houston general manager Tim Purpura said. "It puts us at somewhat of a disadvantage to build our club." La Salle basketball player
avoids sexual assault cllarges 
PIIILADELPHIA --Sexual assault charges against former La Salle bas­ketball player Dzaflo Larkai were dis­missed Monday because his accuser, a former member of the women's team, decided not to proceed with the case on the day the trial was to begin. 
Larkai, 23, was accused of raping the 19-year-old woman in April 2003. She told authorities she dido 't make a report right away because coaches discouraged her from coming forward. 
Assistant District Attorney James Carpenter declined to say why the woman decided against taking the matter to trial. 
Larkai, a forward who attended school in England before enrolling at La Salle, declined to comment as he left the courthouse after the brief hearing. He had been charged with rape, sexual assault and other related offenses.

It was a magnificent week at Orange County National for llolmes, the for­mer Kentucky star who helped the United States win the Walker Cup this summer. lie was the only player to shoot in the 60s all six rounds. 
''I'm just glad it's over," said Holmes, who finislwd at 24-under

Jeff Jackson appears to have settled on Brown. 
The junior has played in each of the last seven contests, starting six of them. He recorded his fifth career shutout Sat-urday against the Broncos. 
"That's what we need from Browny," O'Neill said. "He's a great goalie." 
The Irish fell behind Western 4-1 midway through the sec­ond period of Friday's 4-3 loss in Kalamazoo, Mich. Con­versely, when Notre Dame was able to get and hold a lead in 
the second period of Saturday's contest, the Irish went on to win. 
"We're not a team that needs to be trying to come back night after night," Jackson said. 
After going four games with­out a point, O'Neill burst back on to the scene against Western Michigan with a goal and an assist. Jackson said he 
hopes the talented junior can continue his improvement against Minnesota State. 
The Mavericks, whose school was formerly known as Mankato State, started this season with six straight losses but have since recovered to go 3-3-3 in their last nine con­tests. 
They went to overtime in two 

games against Minnesota­Deluth this past weekend, los­ing 4-3 on Friday and earning a 2-2 tie Saturday. 
The Irish and Mavericks will also square off Saturday at the Joyce Center. That game begins at 7:05p.m.

Cotton Bowl officials propose costly stadium renovation 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -The Cotton Bowl would add more than 16,000 seats and undergo extensive remodeling under a plan unveiled Monday, but the city's mayor warned that the home of the Texas-Oklahoma game games the stadium hosts. The city has been trying to lure

Before this year's game, Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds said he wanted to keep the Texas-Oklahoma game in must receive new commit­ments before renovations are approved. 

The nearly $50 million pro­posal would upgrade seats, concession stands, score­boards and restrooms to the decaying 75-year-old stadium. Seating capacity would to bn looking at two good foot­ball toams that are going to go down there and have a chance to knoek each other's brains out." 
Penn State shared the Big 1 0 championship with Ohio State, but earned the league's auto­matie BCS spot by beating the Buekoyes earlier this sPason. The Snminoles are the lowest­ranked team in thn BCS, finish­ing 22nd in the limd standings and getting into the mix only by upsntting Virginia Teeh on Saturday for the Atlantic Coast Conference title. 
Still, game officials said they're thrilled to have a Howden-Paterno matehup. 
"We are extremely proud to have two of the best here.... Two marquee coaehes in the game, one and two respective­ly," Orange Bowl CEO Keith Tribble said. 
Bowden has 359 wins, six more than Paterno -and both steered their teams to surpris­ing eomebaek stories in 2005. 
Bowden's Florida State team snapped a three-game losing streak on Saturday when it beat then No. 5-Virginia Tech for the ACC crown -the Seminoles' 12th in 14 seasons. Florida State's reward turned out to be a matchup with another highly touted opponent, a Penn State team that nearly went unbeat­en. 
"I feel very fortunate for us," said Bowden, whose team fell from the national rankings after losing three straight. "I feel vnry happy for our boys and our assistant eoaches that we were able to do it. Naturally I feel very lueky about it and some­times I can't hardly believe it." 
Amid whispers that their longtime coaeh is too old to compete, Paterno's Nittany Lions had lost 17 of their last 24 games entering this season and haven't won a bowl game sinee the 1999 season. But only a last-second touchdown by Miehigan kept Penn State from finishing this regular season with a perfeet record. 
"We've caught a lot of heck this year. I've caught a lot of heck," Bowden said. "I can look at Joe's program and say, 'Look there. Just be patient. Look what'll happen.' ... It just sub­stantiates my feeling that nobody's going to win forever. You can have a bad year. You can have a bad series of years. You can have a bad cycle, but Dallas but was not optimistic. He said he would find it diffi­cult for the city to commit so much money to a stadium that hosts only a handful of games each year. 

But Miller told the newspa­per that negotiations were "going very well" between Texas and Oklahoma and that she expected an announce­ment in .January. 
"We won't lose it. We're not going to lose it," Miller said. 
Sinee 1929, the rivalry has been played in Dallas, halfway between the campuses in Norman, Okla., and Austin. The stadium is equally divided between burnt orange-elad Texas fans and crimson Sooners and anchors the sur­rounding Statn Fair of Texas.

Frustrated with the deterio­rating facility, athletic direc­tors from Texas and Oklahoma have threatened to exercise an opt-out after 2007 and switch the Red River Rivalry to a home-and-home series. 
Dallas Mayor Laura Miller said she wants extended com­mitments from schools before making improvements. Miller said in Monday's online edition of The Dallas Morning News that if the city doesn't receive long-term pledges, "then we won't upgrade the Cotton Bowl." 
Prairie View-Grambling and the AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic are the only other football that's not the end because you can come back." 
Bowden is 1-6 all-time against Paterno; he lost all six meetings as West Virginia's coach in the early 1970s, and guided Florida State to a 24-1 7 victory over Penn State in the 1990 Blockbuster Bowl, also at Miami.

Mainieri said there are serious down sides in having a young team but noted past Irish success in situations like Notre Dame will have in 2007. 
"In '99, we started four or five freshmen every day, and that team ended up hosting an NCAA Regional for the first time ever in Notre Dame history," Mainieri said. "In '03, the year after we went to the [College] World Series, we had a lot of turnover again, and we had a lot of young players again that contributed. And we had a tremendous year and went to the Regional at Fullerton. 
"We are going to be awfully young, but I still feel confident that we'll be able to maintain playing at a high leveL" 
Mainieri said he expects the 2007 Irish team to utilize heavily the three right-handed pitchers in this year's recruiting class to stay at a nationally competitive leveL 
Billy Boockford, Steven Mazur and Andrew Scheid all join the Irish as highly touted prospects. 
Scheid, a 6-foot-7, 200-lb. starting pitcher for Regis Jesuit High School outside of Denver, Colo., enters Notre Dame as one of the nation's top pitching recruits after averaging almost 12 strikeouts per nine innings in his junior campaign at Regis Jesuit. 
"Andrew really could have gone to just about any school he wanted to in the country," Mainieri said. "For us to land him was a real major coup." 
Mainieri compared Scheid to former Irish star Brad Lidge, another tall right-hander from Denver. 
He saved a more recent com-
critical for us to replace position players because on our team in 2006 we could have as many as six seniors in our everyday starting lineup," he said. "So it was really important for us to bring in some quality position players, particularly in the outfield." 
The Irish signed four outfield­ers in the class, including two speedy lefties. 
David Mills, a versatile 5-foot­10 player from Battle Creek, Mich., and 5-foot-7 Michael Wright of Lockhart, Texas give Notre Dame a dimension of basepath speed it has been lack­ing in previous years. 
"We brought in two little speed guys, which I felt that we were in badly need of some speed into our program," Mainieri said. "Both [Mills and Wright] are the prototypical left­handed spray hitter that can really run." 
The power hitter of the out­fielders is Austin Pearce of Lake Oswego, Ore. The 6-foot-2, 210­lb. switch hitter has the most explosive bat of the 10 Irish signees, Mainieri said. 
"He's another kid that's just full of a lot of enthusiasm, and he can really hit," Mainieri said. 
Other Irish signees were heavy-hitting outfielder Brayden Ashdown of Tuscon, Ariz., and sure-handed infielders Ryne Intlekofer (Moorpark, Calif.) and 
A.J. Pollock (Hebron, Conn.). 
"This class may rank as high as any in the. overall enthusiasm in the players," Mainieri said. "All of the kids are very outgo­ing personalities that are tremendously thrilled about being at Notre Dame.... We couldn't be more pleased with the group that we fmally signed and will see next August."

Changing the pace 
Irish travel to Minnesota State tonight for pivotal road contest after streak-snapping win over Western Michigan 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's routine is to practice all week and play Friday and Saturday games. But the Irish will be jolted from their routine by today's trip to Mankato, Minn., for a game against Minnesota State. 
The Irish last played Saturday in a 3-0 win over Western Michigan at the Joyce Center. The three-day turnaround between contests is the fastest of the season. 
Notre Dame heads into its game against the Mavericks riding a 17­game road winless streak that dates back to last season. 
Irish defenseman Wes O'Neill said he is actually excited to play a mid­week game as a change of pace. 
"It's back to the junior [Ievell days where you played every other day," he said. "It's a little tough during exams, but we prepare all year for weeks like this." 
Every player on the Irish roster played junior-level hockey before coming to South Bend. Most compet­ed in the United States Hockey League, while three player -right wing Michael Bart-lett, left wing Josh Sciba and left wing Tim Wallace -played for the U.S. Under-18 National Team. 
Minnesota State, which plays in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), will be the first non-conference game for the Irish since Princeton on Oct. 29. Notre Dame is 4-9-1 this season and 3-6-1 in the CCHA.

By JASON GALVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's and women's track and field teams got their first taste of competi­tion this season at the Blue/Gold Invitational Friday in the Loftus Sports Center. And despite a limited amount of athletes on competing oppo­sition, the Irish were finally able to put their off-season training to a much desired test. 
"I would say our expecta­tions were met," assistant coach John Millar said. "Everybody was pleased with how our athletes responded to their first competition, and we

BASEBALL RECRUITING 

Irish ink ten recruits during signing period 
By KEN FOWLER Spans Writer 
Paul Mainieri knew he needed a top-flight recruiting class. 
With eight seniors on the 2005­06 squad and the possibility of multiple juniors being drafted after this season, the 11th-year Irish head coach had to reload Notre Dame's position and pitch­ing weapons with a strong incoming class. 
"It's a tremendous challenge for us this year because we have such an inordinately large senior class," Mainieri said. "We feel that there's a chance that we could lose two to three of our junior class also, so that's a big group to replace in one year.'' 
His coaching staff delivered, nabbing top prospects from California to Connecticut and Michigan to Maryland. 
"We feel like we have a great recruiting class," Mainieri said. "Our coaching staff, [especially] Terry Rooney, the recruiting coordinator, and Cliff Godwin, our new assistant coach, . . . the effort that they put in is where the credit is due for the success of this recruiting class." 
The Irish signed ten players to scholarships during the signing period, and Mainieri said Notre Dame's most important pickup was likely Ryan Smith. Smith, a 6-foot-2 catcher from Waldorf, Md., who will be thrust into the
