Whydoesn't 
General Electric talk about thermal pollution when they
talk about nuclear power plants? 
General Electric pioneered the 
development of nuclear power plants 
in 1957. 

Right from the beginning, we felt 
that the greatest advantage of nuclear 
power was environmental. Unlike 
fossil-fueled power plants, nuclear 
plants don't burn anything to make 
electricity. And where there's no fire, 
there's no smoke. 
But there's a possibl~ 
disadvantage as well. It, too, is 

environmental. Thermal effects. 
We recognize it. 

One GE advertisement you may have seen recently pointed out that "all nuclear power plants discharge heat, as do fossil-fueled plants. America's utilities, with many years of experience, are working on thermal problems at nuclear sites on a plant-by-plant basis." 
General Electric does talk about thermal effects. Because they are important, but also because we feel the facts about them are perhaps too little known. 
Few people realize, for example, that federal law requires utilities to 
. operate their plants within strict temperature limits. Thirty states have even stricter laws. Utilities are spending millions of dollars on dilution flow systems, cooling ponds and cooling towers to comply. 
But, in addition, utilities are sponsoring basic research on the problem of heat exchange and its effect on aquatic life. More than 97 utilities have been financially involved in over 300 such studies. And each one adds a little to man's scientific understanding of the problem. 
Some interesting things have already come of it. For one, it's been found that, in some cases, adding heat to water can actually be beneficial. Warm irrigation water has extended growing seasons. Warm water has created new wintering ponds along waterfowl migration routes. 
Power-plant discharge water is reviving Long Island's oyster trade. Florida is using it to grow shrimp and lobster. In Texas, it's increasing the weight of commercial catfish by as much as SOD%. 
Listing these benefits is not to beg the issue. Thermal effects remain a tough problem to solve at some sites. Each plant must be considered

disadvantages.

. On the first vote of the day, free traders, opponents of closed rule procedures and other foes joined forces to jolt Mills and those supporting the bill. 
Mills, a master tactician, rarely loses a vote and it was the first time since the early 1950's that the House had voted to open any kind of trade bill for amendments. 

News media 
New Voice Publications pub­lisher of the yet-to-be-published New Voice news magazine sub­mit ted its official charter touay to the Vice President of Student Affairs and the Student Union. 
In the charter, the group de­tailed its purpose and outlined its structure. A charter is neces­sary for recognition as an ofticial campus organization. 
The formation of The New Voice was announced early last week on WSN D. campus radio station, by senior Chuck Ryan, the magazine's first publisher. Ryan stated the reasons for founding The 'Vew Voice. citing alleged inadequacies of the pre­sent campus media. 
"A numher of students finally decideu to give a formal voice to the protests of many members of the c:ommunity over the past months concerning the some­times dishonest, often inacsurate and irrelevant, and always sloppy efforts of the current daily publication on campus," Ryan stated. 
Sophomore Jim Holsinger will be the editor of the publication and senior Ed McCartin staff coordinator in the "streamlined" structure. The position of Busi­ness Manager, the only other post specifically mentioneu in the charter, has yet to be filled. 
Holsinger, commenting fur­ther, stated that he hopes to be able to produce the first issue by Christmas, but notrd diffkulties, principally technicaL "There will be a lot of minor problems which I think we can overcome. We still have to find the financial hacking and decide on a prin­ter," he said. 
Holsinger said he received a

The new charter was not spe­cific concerning the frequency of publication, but promised "regular" issues. "The New Voice was originally intended as a weekly publication, with sup­

publisher and editor."  

New Voice Publications has no permanent office as yet. Room 305 Sorin Hall is tempo­rarily serving in this capacity. 
When contacted for his com­ments on the announcement of the New Voice's charter submis­sion and on Ryan's statements, Observer editor Glen Corso said, "Mr Ryan's charges are specious and dishonest. He's annoyed he­cause one of our stories on the Student Senate failed to con­form to his own peculiar taste of journalism.

Finally 
It is with no small amount of satisfaction that we greet tile Krashna administration's decision to hold the constitutional referendum. Since the abolition of the Senate and the general reconstruction of student government was one of the main planks in Mr. Krashna's and Mr. Wining's campaign platform we had expected action to be taken long before this. When the Senate elections were ddayed early this semester, w e along with many others assumed it was done so that a new constitution could be presented to the Senate at its first meeting. The assumotion was unfounded. 
We do recognize that the administration may have run into unexpected snags and consequently was unable to act quickly. However the process was started soon after Krashna took office last year, thereby giving him and his associates more than enough time to iron out any difficulties. The argument can be made that organizations who were planning to ask studen;t government for money may have been in severe straits if they had been forced to wait for the new constitution to be approveu. Yet here it is practically Thanksgiving and still the budget has not gotten final approval. 
Despite the procrastinations on the part of the present student govenment we still feel the case for abolition of the Senate is valid. The body si quite bluntly a legislative sandbox. There are some serious and concerned people in it, but most aspire to it in order to have a platform from which to vent their personal spleen. 
The HPC is a far more constructive body. These men are used to doing things and getting them done. They seem for the most part, to have little patience for the types of games in which Senators indulge. We then wish to congratulate the administration for its achievement in drawing up a new constitution and urge each student to vote in favor of it.

Fred Giufftrida 

The following is the first in a series ofcolumns on the new constitution. Mr. Giufridda is a slay senator from Lyons Hall. 
Since last March a quiet battle has been fought. The subject: the fate of the student senate. The battle has been marked by the conspicuous absence of any solid analysis of the problems which confront the Senate and Student Government. That analysis is due. 
The Senate, as things are now, cannot be an effective part of Student Government. That much is apparent. What, then, is the source of its weakness? To start with, it lacks the support and confidence of the student body, and of course no legislative body can function without popular support. Secondly, it has lost the confidence of the executive branch of student government, and the experience of the last two years shows that the senate cannot producewithout viable executive leadership. Finally, and most importantly, the Senate lacks any real power. By "power'' I don't mean concrete power to rule the community ·-that'd be nice, but unfortunately TMH has shown some reludance to acquiesce to such a move-but the power over internal affairs of student government, which is now exercised by those few men in LaFortune Center whom we shall endearingly call the poobahs. It appears, in fact, that the first two problems of the senate are direct results of this lack of power. 
The question with which we are now faced is: how can the proposed student government constitution seek to remedy the weakness and ineffectiveness of the Senate. Even a quick glance will show that the new constitution has done nothing but eliminate the senate and transfer its meager powers to the new body, the President's Council. In fact, it has weakened the powers of the legislature, for the President's Council is no legislative body at all (with the exception of its budget dealings) and can only recommend to the executive branch of student government. The names and personalities have been changed, but the important problem of power has been ignored. 
Until now, the arguments for and against the new constitution have centered around the question: which body is better equipped to serve the students? These arguments however, belie the whole problem, for what difference does it make who is better equipped ~o exercise powers that don't exist'! If this is infact the case, the same fair will await the President's Council as has already overtaken the Senate. Hence, the idea of the proposed constitution as a radical changt! is rediculous, for in the larger 

Bold New Direction 
swpe of things, it is only a minor adjustment. 
This is not to deny the possibility of radical change in student government, but rather to assert the stark necessity of such a change in a bold new direction. 
Spring at this University marks the annual 
appearance of that occasionally migratory animal, 
presidentis candites. After the customary flow of 
loose promises, the victorious candidate returns to 
hibernation, appearing only when he needs a show of 
public support. There are aiways feeble attempts at 
communication, but even while these attempts are 
made, student government is continuing to 
consolidate its powers of decision in the offices of 
LaFortune. The proposed constitution is another 
example of this consolidation because, whatever else 
it may purport to do, it retains the ultimate power of 
decision in the executive branch. The average student, 
on the other hand, hears nothing about student 
government's actions and furthermore realizes his 
impotence in altering the workings of student 
government. His natural reaction is to forget about 
student government entirely, the condition generally 
known·by the name apathy. 
Now is the time when students must impliment 
radical change to end the prolongation of this system. 
The legislature must be made healthy again; only then 
will Student Government respond to the popular will. 
One possible means to this end is the invest the 
legislature with broad new powers. One specific 
proposal might be to invest a proportionately 
representative legislature with the power to elect the 
Student Body President and his Vice-President. 
Though some will charge this undemocratic, far from 
being undemocratic, this system offers a future in 
which it would be virtually impossible for a candidate 
without the support of the majority to be elected 
SBP. Candidates for the legislature would of necessity 
reveal their choice for the presidency in their 
campaign. In turn, potential SBP candidates would 
probably tap those they considered their best 
representative in the hall, thus raising the quality of 
the legislative candidates. This system coincides 
perfectly with the concept of hall autonomy, of 
which we hear so much, for, in effect, the vote for 
SBP by halls. It would then convert student 
government into a type of strongly-bound 
confederation of at least semiautonomous halls. 
Furthermore, I would delegate to the individual halls 
the entire power of electing their alloted 
reporcsentatives, thus enabling the individual hall to 
send its president and/or vice-president to the 
assembly. if the hall felt this would be the most 
representative. 
Of course, this one provision alone does not create 
a radically strengthened legislature but rather a body of electors. It is provisions similar to the following which will ultimately complete the process. For instance, if the assembly is to be the source of power in student government, it must be the voice of the student body. As it stands the SBP is the voice of the student body, but no one man can represent student opinion on every occasion. This much has been proven more than once in the past. A responsible legislature can reflect student opinion much more effectively. 
Another important provision is that the assembly be directly represented in all university bodies which have student representation, including the SLC, Student Affairs Subcommittee of the Trustees. the University Forum, and any other such body which shall arise. This could enhance the power of the 
legislature  and  at  the  same  time  produce  a  more  
direct line of con tact to  the student.  
Another  area  which  needs  more  direct  student  

control is the Student Union. This body, which spends more than half of the students' money each year, is run entirely by appointed officials. In order to make the Union more responsive to the student will, we would first have the President and Vice-President of Student Union elected by the legislature, with lower-level appointments conferred by that body. Furthermore, the assembly should retain the final power of decision over the speaker schedule and the activities and concert schedules. This would go far to return the power to the people from the vast bureaucracy of student government. 
Such powers would allow the legislature to control Student Government. Furthermore, it would link the executive anu legislative branches inextricably together and force the executive to exhibit leadership in order to enact his policies. Finally, because of this consolidation of power, the assembly should gain the support of the students, thereby solving the three problems with which the Senate is now faced. 
No matter what the specific proposals are, it is this direction which is the only opportunity for radical change. The time for decision is now. For those who are in terested only in streamlining student gl vernment and yielding to the dominating impulse of centralization, the new constitution is a fine opportunity. But for those students who truly desire to reclaim their powers of self-government, the only viable alternative is to embark in this hold new direction.

. . Lowenstein: diary of a loser 
Tlze following are excerpts from a diary that I kept of the Notre Dame effort to help Senior Class Fellow A liard 
K. Lowenstein retain his Congressional seat from Long Island. Much has been omitted for the sake of brevity. The chosen excerpts are meant to express the spirit of the campaign, rather than partray any of tlze individual efforts put forth. 
Friday, October 30 

It is raining, and we are driving to New York. We are driving to New York in the rain. The rain makes the roads as slick as some of the excuses that we used for the classes that we are cutting. 
We are driving to help a friend. 

There are 6 of us in the car. We are thrown together for a common cause. ra'he cause binds us together like nothing at Notre Dame could. We are spending our time for someone we believe in. 
The windshield is awash. Under other circumstances we might stop, and wait ll'ltil it stops. But we cannot stop. Our cause will not let us stop, it is too important. 
At le?st it is not snowing, like in South 
Bend. We have those little things to be 
thankful for. 

It is hard to write in the car. The road 
is btampy. Evcrytime we hii i:i b1.mp, the 
C!!r jumps, and so docs the pencil. When it 
jumps it looses its place. And since it is 
dark, it can never find itself again. 

I cannot see what I am writing, I can 
only feel it. 

We are in Ohio. There are probably 
people here who could use our help, but 
we cannot stop for them. We have to go 
to New York. 

There are even some here that might 
like to help us, but we are not going to 
stop for them either. Our car is already 
tilled and we are going to New York. 
We are going to help AI Lowenstein. 
We have heard that he needs help. The 
polls show him 23,000 votes behind. He 
will lose his seat in the House, if he 
doesn't catch up those 23,000 votes. 
...There are 6 of us in the car -4 
Domer~ dnd 2 from SMC. None of us 
have eva met AI before, yet we all call 
him AI. We have seen him only once 
before. That was when he spoke at Notre 
Dame last year dunng the Strike, 
Cambodia and Kent State. We all believe 
in him, and we are all going to New York 
to help him. 

Each of us has our own personal 
reasons for going. But we all want to see 
AK L back in Congress. This single bond is 
pulling us closer and closer together. 
. . .It is difficult to sleep in the car, 
even when you are driving all night. So 
my mind is dredging up the past. 

I remember that it was 2 years ago that I first heard the name LOWENSTEIN. I first read about him in The Observer. Columnist Betty Doerr. better known in ~orne circles as Sweaty -Betty, published an-article about-going all the way to Long 1-;land to help a struggling young candidate. That candidate was Allard Lowenstein. 
Betty told us that he didn't have a 
chance. But when the ballots were tallied AI was VIctonous. He had won only by 
2000, but he had won where he didn't have a chance. Betty had witnessed a miracle. Betty and her friends had even helped make it come true. It is not often that mere mortals make miracles. 
But little did I think of Betty's article. It had cverythi11ll. a good article should have -clarity, continuity, etc. It even oozed emotion. But it didn't mean anything to me. It was all so far away. 
Far away until last spring, anyway. Al's appearance brought back each of Betty's painful words, and made them live right 
i~ _front of our eyes. f nday, Octoher 31 We are here in New York. It has taken 
us 16 hours and all mght but we are here. But, none of us call it New York, but we only refer to it by its nickname, The Big Apple. 
We worm _our way through its city streets,. stoppmg only for red lights. _We would hke to stop longer and see the city, but ~ong Island and the ca~paign is now w1thm our grasp, and we will let it allude us no longer. 
We are shuttled into the main Headquarters, called Freeport. It is merely the upstairs of a row of delapitated looking stores. But it is even more delapitated It is only an empty shell -a large garrett divided into many smaller rooms. 
nut these rooms have life. There are filled with busy people. We are escorted into a large ballroom by a friendly little moppett. 
She announces us as "the kids from 
Notre Dame." Terry, a long haired yet 
officious young man drops everything to 
greet us. 

There are others there too. But they 
are not so delighted to see us. They have 
come from other schools, not to meet us, 
but to canvass door-to-door. They are 
waiting to get their instructions and their 
literature. 

Terry, although only one of a thousand 
kids that came to help AK L, has a story 
much like everyone else there. But he 
does not tell us about himself, he makes 
sure that we are all right, and tells us how 
to get to the store front out of which we 
will work out of. 
The story that he doesn't tell, and 
which I only found out much later, was 
that he left the University of Southern 
Cal, the day of registration. He will not 
return again until after the Nov. 3 
elections. He will have trJ make up all the 
work he missed in less than half a 
semester. This is the dedication that is

"The worst thing" stops DiNardo 
by Terry Shields Observer Sports Editor 
Editor's Note: This interview with J.arry DiNardo took place lasi week, before he reinjured lzis knee. Tlze comments of the Irish co-captain still seem timely, however, a11d as a tribute to this great All-American the article "\Vill nm as originally printed.

of human hcing. On the football field he plays his position of offensive left guard better than any othn player in college fool­hall. Uff the field he is an hono.· student and a man who geh involved with people and was just recently awarded a post-graduate scholarship from the National F.)Qthall Founda­tion and Hall of Fame. Larry DiNardo is almost too good to be true. 
Most people have heard of the 6'1", 235 pound guard as the captain of the 1970 Fighting Irish offense. When his team­mates selected him last spring for this position they couldn't have made a better choice. Larry

realizes the tremendous burden that being a captain places on a player. He explains, "I definitely feel the added pressure of being a captain. However, I feel that the worst thing that can happen is not being out on the field with t'1e team. When I missed those two games with the knee injury I felt really bad, like I wasn't part of the team. Just being a senior and knowing that this is the last time around makes you dr­pressed when you miss a game, but if you're supposed to be out tnerc: kadi tg, you feel twice a . had." 
Larry DiNardo is a name that has appeared on many All-American lists smce his first year as a starter when he was a sophomore. The burly guard takes a sensible look at the All-America phenomenon. "There are probably five to ten guys at each position who could be picked for the squad. A lot depends on the team's record and things of that nature. There are a lot more 'true All-Ameri­cans' than really get picked. There are men just as good as those who get picked for the team but they just don't get the publicity." 
Notre Dame is still undefeated and the Irish appear to have one of the best teams in their long and glorious history. DiNardo says, "This is basically the same team we had last year, but with a year's experience. Possibly the fact that we have never gone all the way since coming here has made the team a little more eager to play. We're an extreme­
ly dose group. There is a good mixture of seniors, juniors, and 
sophomores. I wouldn't want to compare this team with any other Notre Dame team because the season isn't over yet. If we would go through undefeated then I might compare us to say, the I 966 squad. Even so, we've accomplished a lot." 
Larry's impressive credentials go far past the football field. He is today the sum-total of a col­lege experience that is available to a great many young people. He is an honor student in a rather difficult major (political science) and he definitely will not end his education after earning a bachelor's degree. De­pendingonhisstatusinprofes­sional football, Larry plans to either enter law school or go for an MBA. He explains, "If I get cut by a team then I'II just go on to law school but if I make it 111en I'll take graduate-school ..:reclits on a part-time ba~is. Where I go depends on the team l play for. I don't have a particu­:ar preference where I play but if possible I would like to stay away from New York. Not be­cause I don't like the city, but I simply want a change. You know, meet new people, see new places. I think that's good for a person." 
When Larry isn't opening holes for the Irish backs or studying to keep his average up he gets involved in community :tctivities.He isa memberofthe Blue Circle Honor Sociill:y and he has performed a few services for people in South Bend. "It's really not that hig a deal. A few of us guys would just like to help the community, like when we painted the school down-

They say Casanova con 
town for Sister Marita. One thing that I really like to do is go to the Logan Center and visit with the retarded children. There's nothing like seeing the expression on those faces when you cheer them up a little.'' 
If all this isn't enough to keep' one person busy, Larry still finds time to do things in the summer, like touring Vietnam. "I went on the tour for an educational ex­perience and what I learned was truly worth the few weeks of summer work I missed. My poli­tical views changed entirely after 
that trip. You have to 'be there and see the look on those sol­diers' faces to know the whole story. The war appears to be a futile effort to me. I felt that if we put a smile on one guy's face then the whole trip was worth­while." 
The Irish co-captain is also interested in the efforts of some of his teammates this season, Joe Theismann in particular. "The Heisman Trophy is supposed to symbolize the outstanding per­former in collegiate football. Now I know that (Archie) Man­ning and (Jim) Plunkett are great quarterbacks and they have that good size for professional foot­ball. However, if they are basing the award solely on a collegiate performam:e, then I see no rea­son why Joe shouldn't be right in there. If he won this award it would not only be good for him but for the entire 1970 Notre Dame team. I'd just be tickled to death if he won it." 
Larry DiNardo, if ever there were ever a person worthy of the privilege to be a Notre Dame captain it is certainly he.

Joey Morgan, sports editor of the Reveille, had this to say: "The Cotton Howl made a grav·· error in selecting Notre Dam, 
LS U _ Notre Dame has only played two teams with winning seasons, Purdue and Southern California. They lost to Purdue and tied Southern Cal. Notre Dame has more of a name than a game. It is going to he the bigges1 humiliation in Notre Dame history when they play Texas in the howl game. Coach Parseghian of Notre Dame plays a bloodthirsty game up until the last second, even when he's 40 points ahead. Their line is fat and sloppy. The good Catholic brothers of Notre Dame are going to the bowl fur the $300,000 they will receive, but the beating they'll get will not equate the humiliation they will fac~ at the hands of Texas.'' 
"One guy does not make a team," said Joan Bartus. "I think LSU has been done a dirty turn. With a team like LSU that ltas the best records in so many areas, you don't overlook it for a one-man show Archie Man­'ling 
a sophomore, was pegged for tailback this season by Coach Charles McClendon. However, a combination of circumstances dictated otherwise by mid-sea­s.on. Cass suffered a sprained shoulder in the season opener against the Texas Aggies and was hampered until the fifth game of the campaign. 
Meanwhile, various and sun­dry injuries on defenst> forced Cholly Mac to alter his plans and resort to his policy of 1969 when Tommy was used on de­fense almost exclusively, being spotted in certain situations on offense. 
However, his contributions to LSU's season, thus far, are im­pressive. He has carried the ball 4 7 times for 198 yards; caught three passes for 23 yards; scored 
three touchdowns; had two in­
terceptions; returned I 0 punts 
for 79 yards; and brot:ght back 
six kickoffs for 90 yards. 
These are just figures which hardly describe the other things this brilliant athlete has done. His exceptional speed (:09.7) and sharp reactions enable him to cover outstanding receivers like Auburn's Terry Beasley, Alabama's David Bailey and Mis­SISSippi State's David Smith, man-to-man. He is such a threat as a return man that in Saturday night's State victory, it was his handoff to Craig Burns on a, punt that enabled Burns to travel 90 yards for a touchdown. The Maroon coverage followed Casanova and allowed Burns to streak down the east sidelines for the longest punt return by a Tiger since Billy Cannon's fa­mous 89 -yard runback against Ole Miss I959. "We are con­
stantly amazed at the ease with which Tommy plays football," 


Coach Mac said. 
Tommy has one other quality which might be called a throw­hack to an earlier era in football. When he is carrying the ball his amazing balance allows him to utilize the old-fashioned "stiff arm" to ward off would-be tack­lers. And his faculty of shiftiness 
propels him through space in unbelievable fashion. Because of his mid-season. shift from offense to defense it 
will he rather difficult for Casa- nova, even with all the plaudits which have come his way, to be named to an All-American. but it's not impossible. He's a cinch. to be high on the check list. 
This weekend Tommy will be involved in an ironic situation. He attended Notre Dame high school in his home town of Crowley, La. Saturday afternoon he'll be at Notre Dame again, but this time as an opponent, facing the nation's number one football team. You can figure well that Tommy Casanova will be giving a good account of himself as the Fighting Tigers have their first meeting in his­tory with the Fighting Irish.

Rev. Edward Keller, C.S.C., Professor Emeritus, gave a brief talk on the beginnings and growth of the Young Americans for Freedom at a meeting of the Notre Dame chapter of that organization. Also, during the meeting, the YAF organized its drive for donations to be sent to a Vietnam hospital in the form of kool-aid, candy and other presents.

the YAF. He contrasted it to the John Birch Society, which he felt tries to shove viewpoints down it~ members' throats. He cited the varied responses of the nation's many chapters as an example of each chapter esta­blishing "its own path." 
Keller tersely ran through the history of anti-Communism and conservatism, starting with the changes in national policy during the Truman administration, up to the conference at Sharon, Conn. which started the YAF. Keller cited Bill Buckley and his Natinal Review for making the YAF a widespread national organization, and the Goldwater campaign for uniting it behind a common· cause. 
While Keller noted many dif­ferences among conservatives in rei i gi on, an ct the conflict between libertarian and tradi­tionalist elements of conserva­tism, he considered the common element to "that all emphasized individual moral responsibility.
