Contra policy leaves legitimate questions 
Unlike Ronald Reagan, who charmed the media during his campaign and early admin­istration, George Bush has entered into an ad­
Jim versarial relationship with the press. The much-publicized confrontation with Dan Rather Carroll made it quite apparent that the Bush campaign is not the favorite cause of the CBS evening news. Likewise, Bush holds no great admiration for what he considers a liberal and slanted press. 
Bush suffers from an image problem that in part stems from the often-repeated claim that he is a wimp. In faithfully serving a president as powerful and as colorful as Ronald Reagan, Bush has been typecast as a mild mannered assistant with neither the nerve nor the energy to implement policies of his own. However un­fair this characterization might be, the general public is unaware of what influence Bush has or had in Reagan's cabinet. As vice president he has remained mostly invisible, and for this, a lack of presence is often associated with his name. 
Bush claims that he is heckled by newspaper reporters and TV journalists who seek to destroy his presidential candidacy on the basis of a single controversial issue whose impor­tance is past, namely, the Iran-Contra affair. Instead of answering questions on this topic he .._.L-_______,___...;;;;;;...____~ chooses to avoid them. For unknown reasons numbers of their countrymen and sabotaging

In Brief 

The Institute for International Peace Studies received a grant of $450,000 from the MacArthur Founda­tion of Chicago to support the institute's programs through 1990. An additional $300,000 for the period 1991-92 is con­tingent upon the Foundation's review and approval of the University's use of the initial funds. The institute was created in 1985 with a six million dollar donation from Joan Kroc. -The Observer 
Abortion in Canada is now a legal right, as the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the nation's restric­tive abortion law in a split decision Thursday, ruling it unconstitutional and a "violation of a woman's right to control her own body." While abortion crusaders ap­plauded the decision, pro-life groups vowed to fight on, urging the Canadian Parliament to rewrite the law. The ruling mirrors the U.S. supreme Court decision of Roe vs. Wade in 1973 that struck down the U.S. abortion law. ­

Space workers paused at Cape Canaveral to pay sifent tribute Thursday to the seven astronauts who died two years ago in the fiery Challenger disaster. It was one of many remembrances around the country. Tour buses stopped, cafeteria lines halted and hundreds of engineers, technicians and other workers poured out of buildings at 
11:38 a.m., the moment when Challenger lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. Flags around the Kennedy Space Center were lowered to half staff, while workers stood silent for 73 seconds, the length of the fatal Challenger flight. The air was chilly, the sky clear, a grim reminder of the frigid conditions that contributed to the space shuttle's destruc­tion. -Associated Press

such as this does not happen very often." 
Both Hollenhorst and Par­
rish said full cooperation of 
anyone who will be using the 
library during the two hours is 
needed in order for the experi­
ment to be effective. 
"If it's only to have the build­

else to look at because there 
are plenty of other places to 
study," she said. 
Hollenhorst also said refer­ence services provided by a member of the library faculty will be available from 1 to 9 
p.m. and the lower level study lounge will be open 24 hours each day.

it would likely be one in a large city with a student body of around 25,000. Plans call for the screening to take place some time this spring, Koop said, and it would likely be part of a one­day open-air campus "gala" on AIDS prevention. 
"The goal would be to test everybody in that university in such a way that it's done out in the open, above-board; every­one knows that the blood specimen is not in any way tagged," Koop said. 
"That would give you a pretty good idea of the preva­lence (of AIDS) in the age group in an urban setting," he added. 
The incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is highest among 20-to 24-year­olds, with male homosexuals and drug abusers among those most at risk. 
AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's im­mune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from preg­nant women to their offspring. 
Blood tests can determine the presence of AIDS an­tibodies, indicating exposure to the virus.

Students at Saint Mary's Cushwa-Leighton Library will soon have more time to study, thanks to an experimental in­crease in Sunday hours. 
Beginning Jan. 31, the library will open at 11 a.m. instead of its usual opening at 1 p.m., said Sister Bernice Hollenhorst, li­brary director. The extension of hours was approved because students expressed a need to use the library material and the reserve collection prior to 1 p.m. on Sundays, Hollenhorst said. 
Students and other patrons will be asked to sign in and out and indicate their purpose for coming to the library before the usual opening time, in order to assess the results of the experi­ment, said Hollenhorst. 
The results will be evaluated at the end of the semester and used to determine future Sun­day hours, Hollenhorst said. 
Julie Parrish, vice president of academic affairs and college relations feels that the trial period, which will run through­out the semester, is a "major accomplishment for Saint Mary's student government." 
"Now that students have a trial period, they should use what was made available to them at their request," Parrish said, adding that "a change

Gary Hart attacks Democratic rivals 
Associated Press 
Gary Hart ridiculed his Dem­ocratic presidential rivals for misguided "old politics" and complained of endless scrutiny from the media Thursday, while a congressional inves­tigator renewed the call for George Bush to tell all on arms to Iran. 
Republican Pat Robertson, campaigning in Miami, a haven for Cuban exiles, sugges­ted he'd back an armed resis­tance against Castro's Cuba. 
Fighting sagging poll num­bers, Hart raised the pitch of his criticism of fellow Democrats in an Iowa speech where he said they avoid specifics by repeating only vague phrases, chanting "'Massachusetts miracle' and 'presidential leadership' like mantra."

Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, said the vice president's role in the sale of U.S. missiles to Iran "remains unclear" and will be an issue until Bush answers the questions that dog him. 
"It seems to me it's a legitimate issue right now for the vice president to tell us ex­actly what his reservations were and how vigorously he ex­pressed them," Hamilton said on CBS' "This Morning."

Daily said a college degree ensures greater opportunities for jobs in Indiana. "Because of the changing job market and because the training required to fit into the jobs of the future is much more extensive and de­manding than ever before," Daily said, he is in favor of in­creasing financial aid to col­lege students. 
"We have to give as many people the opportunity to at­tend universities as we possibly can," said Daily, "so it makes sense to invest money in edu­cation." 
Daily said he wants to "get into the schools" to talk to col­lege students. "The student vote, historically, has been nonexistent. Usually college students don't get involved in the political process, especially in the governor race,'' said Dai­ly. 
But, he added, college stu­dents, without knowing it, in­fluence opinion. "There's al­ways a small core of activists that can play a major role in a campaign," he said. 
He said it would be a mistake for any candidate to pass up the opportunity to speak to any college audience.

Parking situation 



1n dire straits 
At the beginning of every school year students wishing to park their cars in the lots adjacent to campus pay a $25 fee. For this price one might expect a guaranteed spot in a safe and convenient location. Unfortunately this is not the case. 
The student parking situation is bad and is growing worse. More students with cars this semester means substantial overcrowding in the designated student lots, an appalling lack of snow mainte­nance has made the lots slippery and often inacessible, and inade­quate security has made it clear that the automobiles left in these lots are at the mercy of thieves and vandals. 
Overcrowding in the D-1 and D-6 lots makes it necessary for on-campus students to park either in the muddy trenches of Green Field or in far-removed regions near Senior Bar. Too many cars are assigned for too few spaces. 
One solution to the overcrowding would to be to expand the D-6 lot by using the empty field that lies adjacent. 
Snow removal from all of the student lots is a service sorely in need of improvement. When students returned from Christmas break, D-1 and D-2 seemed not to have been cleared. 
Those lucky enough not to be blocked in by heaps of snow must still fight their way through freezing pools of slush. More profes­sional plowing and an improved system of drainage are needed. As for the icy hill that frequently prevents exits from D-6, a little salt and sand applied even occassionaly would aid immensely in safety and easy access to the lot. 
Snow removal is not the only problem in the parking lots. A quick glance at Security Beat columns shows an alarming number of reports of vandalism and break-ins. On Monday, The Observer reported three incidents involving break-ins or vandalism to stu­dent cars. Total damages were estimated at $550. Today's Security Beat column reports two more similar incidents involving $375 in further losses. We've come to expect that an incident of theft or vandalism will occur almost every day in the Notre Dame parking lots. The lighting in D-6 is poor, and while Security cars are seen patrolling the parking lots, there is obviously not enough of a pres­ence by Security in the lots to deter people from committing these crimes.

The Revue: all in fun 
MARK PANKOWSKI and MIKE NAUGHTON accent writers 

Y 
es, Thursday night's 
Keenan Revue did have 

jokes about "fat chicks." 
It also had jokes about Mark Stevenson's alleged extracur­ricular activities, Tim Brown's towel, University Food Services, Stanford Hall's "Studs," Tim Brown's towel, St. Michael's Laundry, off-campus parties, Tim Brown's towel, Crimestop­pers, "Queen" Laurie Bink, John Goldrick, and Tim Brown's towel. 
And nearly every one of them 

worked. 
In addition to the usual array of slams, barbs and jibes, there were several instrumental numbers that demonstrated the immense talent of Keenan stu­dents. 
Clearly, Thursday night's three-and-a-half hour show was a success. Though some acts ran a little long, the 1988 Revue left the standing-room ­only crowd wanting more. 
The best act was saved for last: SMC Side Story. The musi­cal featured Paul A. Kane, Daniel A. lzzo, Dave McMonagle, Steve Traubert, Kevin Keirn, Michael Peeney, Michael Zoltan Ury, Greg Wag­ner and Chris Barnabo. This undoubtably was the act that required the most work. The songs, which parodied those from "West Side Story," were well written and well sung. 
Mr. Olympia was a simpler skit, but it nearly brought the house down. Tom "Stick" Shaw courageously got on stage, displayed his physique and "outflexed" Notre Dame football players Anthony Johnson and Rod West to the delight of the audience. 
Notre Dame flanker and Heis­man Trophy winner Tim Brown was hit three times with Just When You Thought It Was Safe. _.. The three skits, inter­spersed throughout the Revue, featured Trey Dodson, John Hamill, Jim Mazurek, Steve Shemwell. We only hope Tim can laugh about the towel inci­dent as much as Thursday night's audience. 
Off-Campus Party hit home for anyone whose ever atten­ded a party at CampusView Apartments. And one of the best skits was a short but sweet parody of a familiar com­mercial, General Foods Inter­national Coffees. 
Two other "commercials," however, Less Filling, Tastes Great and Smickers Satlfles, took old jokes and made them older with unoriginal shots at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women. 
While short.gkits helped the 

Revue maintain a fast pace, 
some of the longer acts 
bogged down. 
Despite their promising premises, Donahue, SMC Trek, Peewee Hickey's Dining Hall, Midgets at NO, Crimestoppers ­It Works! and A Day at the Su­perhero Academy failed to really go anywhere. The stu­dents who played Donahue and Peewee, however, were good enough to rescue their skits from boring the audience. 
Good Math With Dr. Ruth Westhyperbola may have been too clever for its own good. Although George Cannon did a fantastic impression of Dr. Ruth, the skit seemed to elicit more uncomfortable laughs than genuine ones with its sexual innuendos. 
The great majority of the acts, however, were very enter­taining. 
Some of the most impressive were the musical interludes between the comedy acts. Annie's Song, performed by 
J.J. McCabe Noble Levesque and Mark Sanders was a union of music and sign language that moved the audience. Hiroshima Mon Amour added a more artistic element to the show with a synthesis of music and a video. The original com­positions Across the River and Midsummer's Daydream, showed both skill and ability by their artists. 
Other acts were entertaining primarily because of their originality. The NO Voodoo Sumo Wrestlers, Formal Dating ... With a Tuba and Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Eve­ning all explored the outer limits of humor. 
In the two of the more humorous skits, University Food Services was chewed up in Vat Chu Vant, and the men's laundry service was wrung out in St. Michael's Does Your Laundry. 
Stand-up comedy is difficult but Dan Izzo proved to be up to the task with a well-delivered and well-received act. Another entertaining one-man skit was Dramatic Reading, an act in which Rich Pokorny presented a deliberately overdone reading of the song, "Shake Your Love." 
-.he "Zambini Brothers" were 
back again this year with The 
Farewell Victory Tour of the 
Flying Zambini Brothers. 
They're still silly enough to 
remain one of the biggest 
crowd pleasers. 
Familiar musical tunes were 
altered to successfully lampoon 
campus life. Cindy the Smicker 
chronicled the social life of a 
Saint Mary's student. "John 
Goldrick" and his henchmen 
sang Screw Miser, a modified 
version of the tune "Heat 
Miser" from the Christmas spe­
cial, "A Year Without Santa 
Claus." And the Stanford Studs 
sang a song of narcism and 
dubious sexual preference. 
All in all, the show was once 
again an incredible display of 
talent and energy. The show 
was nearly perfect technically 
despite many scenery and 
lighting changes, and the 
sound was generally good. 
It just goes to show that some of the best things in life really are free. 
The ffeenan Revue continues tonight and Saturday night at 
7:30.

OOOmeanwhile, St. Ed's players get 'Odd' 
MARY BURGER Accent Writer 
}\ s the song goes, break­
.l'Jng up is hard to do, and 
thanks to the St. Edward's Hall 
Players, now we know that it's 
often funny, too. 
The Players, under the guise 
of Junior Duane Difranco, en­
tertained a crowd of 125 last 
night in Washington Hall with 
their rendition of Neil Simon's 
"The Odd Couple." 
Although director Difranco 
had said earlier that this pro­
duction would probably not 
leave the audience "rolling in 
the aisles," it was obvious that 
the Keenan Revue was not the 
only place to go for some good 
laughs and some good insight 
last night. 
The production did not get a quick start out of the blocks, but when Oscar, played by Sophomore Tim Flood, brought out the warm coke and brown and green sandwiches, he also brought on the laughs. 
Clad in khaki pants, sneakers, t-shirt. and baseball cap, Oscar sprayed his buddies with beer, weasled money out of them, and was just plain entertaining. 
According to Difranco's note in the program, Simon is one of the "most prolific comedic writers of our time." True, much of the success of this show Is due to the excellent script filled with hilarious one­liners. Credit must be given, though, to Difranco for his extraordinary efforts in putting the production on and in leading the Players. 
As an entirely student-run project. the Players did a pro­fessional job. For instance, when a prop fiub occurred in­volving a telephone, the actors did not get flustered. Another outstanding part of the produc­tion was the superb set de­signed by Charles Maher and constructed chiefly by Pat Murphy. Immediately upon en­tering the theater, it was ob­vious the set was solid and professional. 
The direction and the acting in general were all very well done. Senior Andy Barlow was convincing in his portrayal of the depressed neat freak. Felix Ungar, and he had some of the best facial and body gestures 

of the group. My neck kinked 
when he got a nerve twitch in 
his and one of the funniest 
scenes was during the dis­
astrous double date when Felix 
is struggling to carry on a con­
versation with the two giggly 
"cuckoo Pigeon sisters" (Robin 
Dvorak and Shawna Rheaume) 
from England. He gets swal­
lowed into an easy chair and 
squirms in it from then on, 
pleading for Oscar to bring the 
drinks and rescue him from the 
horrendous job of conversing 
with the two women. 
"The Odd Couple" is about relationships. Friendships, romantic involvements, and poker-buddy bonds are all ex­amined. We see the caring side of Felix's friends when he wants to commit suicide, we see the best friend role fully played when Oscar invites Felix to live with him since he has separated with his wife, we see the love and devotion Felix and Oscar both have for their wives and children, even though they cannot live with them and be families any longer. 
It was amusing to see Felix throwing all of the classic "female" lines at Oscar for being late for their date and not calling: "If you knew you were going to be late, why didn't you call? Were you so busy you couldn't even pick up a phone? Oh, you were working were you, down at a bar?" Heck. Felix had spent the day "slaving" over dinner for the big date and what did Os­car really care anyway? 
By this time, Felix and Oscar have obviously fallen into ruts and roles which are keeping their friendship from nourish­ing. What Simon, Difranco, and the Players hope is that we see ourselves in the:se charac­
ters and learn a little bit about ourselves and how we handle relationships. As Difranco says in his program note, "while you're laughing at Oscar, Felix. and all of their friends, look twice. You may find that you have been laughing at your­selfi" 
So, if you are looking for another good laugh this weekend, and you think your roommate, friend, or romantic involvement Is tough to get along with or get through to, be sure to make a date to find out If you really are an odd couple.

By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Kent State is the only school the Notre Dame hockey team has played and failed to defeat this season. 
But the Irish get their chance to change that this weekend in a rematch with their American Collegiate Hockey Association rival. Faceoff at the JACC is set for 7:30 on Friday and Sat­urday nights. 
In the second series of the season on Nov. 6-7, the Irish took a trip to Kent State and stumbled back home with a pair of ties. Several defensive lapses by Notre Dame and a potent Kent State offense led to a 5-5 deadlock in the first game and a 6-6 draw in the second one. 
"We might have been for­tunate to come away with two ties last time, but we're a much better team now," said Schafer. "We're going to work on our penalty-killing. They burned us pretty well that last time." 
In the series at Kent, eight of the 11 Kent State goals came on the power play. All six of the Golden Flashes' goals in the second game were results of a man-advantage situation. 
The Irish have made great strides in the penalty-killing department since that time. For the season, Notre Dame has stopped the opposition on the power play 83 percent ot the time. 
Notre Dame has been on a tear since the series at Kent, winning eight straight and 16 of their last 17 on their way to a 17-2-2 season record. For the Golden Flashes, the story has not been quite the same. 
Kent State lost six of eight games following the first series with the Irish. Since then, the Flashes have won six of their last 10 games, but still have a record of only 10-17-3. 
Notre Dame has won by having a strong defense to com­plement its powerful offense. Led by senior captain McNeill (18 goals, 30 assists), Guay (21, 
12) and Mooney (9, 24), the Irish have scored 6.3 goals a game. 
While much of the scoring has come from the front line (McNeill, Guay, Mooney) and the second line of forwards (Tim Kuehl, Brian Montgomery, Matt Hanzel), Schafer has shown much satis­faction with the recent play of the third line. 
"Bob Bilton's line with Bob Herber and either Tommy Smith or Frank O'Brien they've been really unnoticed at times and not gotten enough credit," said Schafer. 
"There's a lot of attention put on the top two lines, but we wouldn't be successful without the contributions of everyone on the team."

"No," said Washington's de­fensive coordinator, he didn't expect the Redskins would get the eight sacks on Denver's John Elway in Sunday's Super Bowl that they got on Min-
NFC champiOnship game. "I don't m~~n to ~ay this t~e 
wrong way, Pebtbon said. "Wade Wilson's ,a good. quar­terback. But he s not m the same class with ~ohn Elway."

page 14 The Observer 
McCann gives Irish the edge in National Catholics 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
To say Notre Dame wrestling coach Fran McCann is confi­dent going into this weekend's National Catholic Tournament at Cleveland might be an un­derstatement. 
"We'll be the best team there," said the fourth-year head coach. "I don't want to overlook it, but it's the type of meet we should dominate, and the kids are going into it like it's a must-win." 
Notre Dame won the Na­tional Catholic in 1986, but failed to defend the title last year. John Carroll won last year's championship and hosts this year's event. 
But the three wrestlers who won individual championships last year for John Carroll all have graduated. Notre Dame did not lose any of their indi­vidual winners to graduation. That, plus a freshman class rated the lOth best in the country by Amateur Wrestling News, makes the Irish prohibi­tive favorites to win this year's National Catholic. 
One of the freshmen ex­pected to do big things for Notre Dame this weekend is 158-pound Mark Gerardi. The frosh from El Cajon, Cal., has surprised even himself in jumping out to a 19-5 individual record in the early part of his first season. 
"I expected I'd take my lumps and lose a few times," said Gerardi. "I didn't expect to come in and kill people. I'm happy with the way I've done." 
The only "lump" Gerardi has taken this season has been an injury suffered in the team's winter trip to Colorado. Due to the lack of depth on the team, Gerardi has continued to wrestle, and win, with the in­jury, a bruised rib or separated cartilage in the bone. 

"In the practice before Air Force I hurt it, then I hurt it again back in practice here," said Gerardi. "The doctor said it was a slight separation en the cartilage. 
"Todd Tomazic was hurt also with his collarbone, and I pretty much had to wrestle. We couldn't afford to forfeit those weight classes. Between my weight class and Todd's, there were only three of us, so I had to wrestle." 
"I knew him in high school, and when I came on a recruit­ing trip he was here also," said Gerardi. "I didn't know for sure he was coming here, but I had an idea he would. I never wrestled him in high school, but I knew him from wrestling tournaments and stuff like that." 
While Tomazic has been sidelined for much of the year with his collarbone injury, McCann has been more than pleased with the performance of Gerardi. Mention Gerardi to the Irish head coach, and the word "composure" is soon to follow. 
That compsure is a result of over 10 years of wrestling ex­perience. Mark started to wrestle when he was seven years old. His brother started at the same time, and went on to wrestle at Cal-State Fuller­ton. 
Mark became the third per­
son in history to win three state 
championships at California· 
"We knew he had tremen­

dous ability, but the biggest 
thing that concerned us was 
that he wasn't the most physi­
cal person in the world," said 

McCann. '"He's got so many 
ways to offset his lack of 
strength, like his speed, quick­
ness, intelligence and just all­
around athletic ability. 
"I think he has the ability to place in the NCAA's this season as a freshman. We thought he was one of the best guys com­ing in, and he hasn't done anything to prove us wrong."

ND faces ninth-ranked 'Cats on Super Sunday in Louisville 
By RICK RIETBROCK Assistant Sports Editor 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -The ninth-ranked Kentucky Wildcats' chances of winning the Southeastern Conference definitely were hurt by Wed­nesday night's 83-66loss to Van­derbilt. But the loss may make putting away th~ wounded Wildcats an even tougher as­signment for Notre Dame when the Irish travel to Louisville's Freedom Hall to take on Ken­tucky Sunday at 1:30 p.m. (televised nationally by ABC). 
Notre Dame head coach Dig­ger Phelps says the loss doesn't affect his view of the 13-3 Wildcats. 
"The loss to Vanderbilt is in no way indicative of how Ken­tucky can play," says Phelps.
 "You just have to respect the talent they have, because they're due to explode. You just know Kentucky will be at its best Sunday.'' 
Kentucky at its best is quite a challenging task. The guard tandem of sophomore Rex Chapman and senior Ed Davender is one of the nation's best. 
Chapman was last year's SEC "Freshman of the Year" as he became the first Wildcat rookie ever to lead the team in scoring. He leads Kentucky in scoring again this year with 
18.4 ppg. and is second in as­sists with 57. 
Davender is a fine defender, who also scores 16 ppg. and leads the team with 59 assists. 
If the Wildcats have trouble from the outside, they can go inside to a front line packed with wide-bodies. 
Senior forward Winston Ben­nett (6-7, 210 pounds) has returned after missing last season to have reconstructive knee surgery. He is second on the team in scoring 06.2), and leads the Wildcats with 8.4 rebounds per game. 

Other Wildcats who will spend time filling the lane in­clude center Rob Lock (6-11, 225), who scores 11.2 ppg., and adds sevens boards, 6-7, 230­pound senior Richard 'Master Blaster' Madison (4.2 ppg., 4.6 rpg.) and 6-9, 205-pound senior Cedric Jenkins. 
A pair of heralded freshmen also contribute for the Wildcats. LeRon Ellis (6-11, 225), the son of former NBA great LeRoy Ellis, was Califor­nia's Player of the Year and 6-6, 205-pound swingman Eric Manuel was Georgia's Player of the Year. Both have been somewhat disappointing so far, according to Kentucky coach

Three new teams
Ieave n0 r0 0 m 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame field hockey team will be dropped from var­sity status beginning with the 1988-89 school year, Assistant Athletic Director Brian Boulac confirmed Thursday . 
According to field hockey head coach Jill Lindenfeld, Boulac and Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal informed her of the decision Jan. 19. In a sub­sequent meeting with Boulac, he gave Lindenfeld the reason­ing behind the move. 
"They're adding sports with scholarships (women's soccer and softball) and they said they need money for that," said Lin­denfeld. "It was either go all the way with field hockey schol­arships (the team did not have any), or drop it, and because the other two sports are more popular, they chose to drop it." 
Lindenfeld admitted that field hockey was on the downswing in the Midwest. Purdue, whose field hockey program included eight full scholarships, decided to drop its program last month. In fact no high school in the state of Indiana has a field hockey pro­gram. 
The decision to drop the pro­gram hit the team hard. 
"I can't believe it hap­pened," said freshman for­ward Amy Bundens. "If I would have known that they were going to drop the pro­

Senior guard Ed Cavender and the Kentucky Wildcats will provide a tough test for the Notre Dame basketball team Sunday afternoon. Rick Rietbrock previews the game at left. 
Limelight means athletes must shine 
When the story of Mark Stevenson's latest troubles broke early this week, one comment about his arrest for underage drinking was, "how many other students were cited for the same offense that weekend." 
The point is well-taken. Like it or not, underage drinking is as much a part of college life as, well, college basketball. It happens. Look at the number of minors cited at Lee's Ribs last year. There is, however, a difference between Stevenson's case and the Lee's case, aside from the fact that Steven­son had been arrested once before this season. 
Those students aren't in the limelight that a bas­ketball player at a major university is. 
That may not be fair, but that's the way it goes. People, especially children, look up to athletes. While growing up in the Atlantic Coast Conference area, my friends and I were always Phil Ford, David Thompson or, since we live in Charlottesville, Va., Wally Walker when we played games. 
No matter where you grew up, you more than likely played out a scenario like ''three seconds to go, Ford launches one from the corner, it's good! Carolina·wins!" Well, the same thing goes on now, only with the names changed to Rivers, Voce and Stevenson. 
While it may be an unfair burden to put on some­one between the ages of 18 and 22, athletes have some responsibility as role models. That question came up at Ule NLAA Tournament last yecu when drug testing was almost more of an issue than the games themselves, and in the wake of the death of Maryland all-American Len Bias. 

"Maybe in sports we can be the example," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps when questioned on the issue. "(Drug testing) has got to let people

know that there are enough role models out there that have not weakened to that type of lifestyle."· 
While that may apply to the drug issue, it also illustrates the point that athletes, the idols of children, have to live up to that. Again, that's a tough mantle to thrust upon a 19-20 year-old college student, but consider this: 
Last Saturday, after Notre Dame had upset Kansas, a reporter stood in the Irish lockerroom, wanting to get a few more words with David Rivers. The reporter found himself second in line to talk to Rivers. Ahead of him was an old man with his grandchildren, one who appeared high school age and another who was much younger. They were asking Rivers to sign their game programs which bore a picture of him on the cover. 
While Rivers signed the younger boy's program, the boy looked up with an awed look on his face. It wasn't the first time in almost two years of covering the Irish that the reporter had witnessed a similar scene. He knew it wouldn't be the last. 
On a less lofty note in college basketball, the grades are in on which school had the best early recruiting period. The Irish, who got commitments from 6-9 LaPhonso Ellis, 6-11 John Tower and 6-1 Elmer Bennett, have come out very well. Many of the columnists in the January issue of Basketball Times ranked how schools finished in the early per­iod. Here's a run down of how the Irish finished: Dick Vitale-eighth (Georgetown and Alonzo Mourn­ing were first), Dick Weiss-sixth (Georgetown), Van Coleman-third <Syracuse). 
Game of the Week -There are a lot of nnminations for this week's Game of the Week, with the scorch­ing 17-2-2 hockey team at home for a two-game set this weekend and the men's basketball squad en-
