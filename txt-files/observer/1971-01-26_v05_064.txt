Manson verdict: guilty of murder.! 
LOS ANGELES (UPI) ­Charles Manson and three young women he lured into 
his wild nomadic cult were con­victed of first degree murder yesterday in the savage and senseless slaughter of actress Sharon Tate and six other help­less victims. 
A predominantly middle-aged jury returned a verdict finding the self-styled "Jesus Christ" guilty of sending his "robots" out to stab and shoot to death five persons at the Tate home and two others at the residence of wealthy supermarket owner Leno LaBianca. 
The girls, Susan Atkins, 22, Patricia Krenwinkel, 23, and Leslie Van Houten, a former high school beauty queen, &-'ere charged only with the LaBianca slayings. 
The same seven man, five 
woman jury now will decide 
starting Thursday, the punish­
ment for the 36-year-old Manson 
and the dark-haired trio who followed his every command from love-making to homicide. 
They have a choice between life imprisonment or death in the gas chamber at San Quentin. 
Manson and the three girls heard the verdicts in absolute silence in a courtroom in which 20 deputy sheriffs stood guard. 
As he was led out Manson 
dressed in a white blouse, black 
scarf and trousers called out to 
the judge: "We weren't allowed 
to put on a defense, old man." 
Manson also said, "I think the 
jury's guilty." 
The three young women 
dressed in blue denim prison 
dresses with darker blue sweaters 
put their heads together and 
whispered as the verdicts were 
read bycourtclerkGene 
Darrow. 
lt took Darrow 16 minutes to 
read the 27 separate verdicts 
which included four counts of 
conspiracy to commit murder as 
well as the individual killings. 
Defense attorney Paul Fitz­
gerald said the defendants ex­
pected the guilty verdicts and 
that their lawyers were "dis­
appointed but not surprised." 
"We thought we lost the case 
when we lost the change of 
venue motion. We had about as much chance of a fair trial in Los Angeles as Sam Sheppard had in Cleveland." 
The verdicts came almost a year and one half after the slay­ings and, in the course of the uproarious trial the victims were 
all but forgotten characters in 
the case. 
They were: 
Miss Tate, 26, daughter of an 
Army colonel who became known for her performance in "Valley of the Dolls." She was married to Polish film director Roman Polanski and was eight and one half months pregnant at the time of her death. 
Jay Sebring, 35, at one time 
Miss Tate's finance. ~bring was 
a top Hollywood men's hair 
stylist who numbered such cus­
tomers -as Frank Sinatra among 
his clientele. 
Vo ityck Frykowsky, 37, a 
friend of Polanski who had 
worked with him on movies in 
Europe and came to the United 
States as a sort of hanger-on 
known to be a user of drugs. 
Abigail Folger, 26, a member 
of the millionaire Folger coffee 
family. A graduate of Radcliffe, 
she met Frykowsky in New 
York and formed a liaison with 
him coming to Los Angeles as 
house guests of the Po!anskis. 
Steven Parent, I 8, the son of 
a carpenter who was visiting the 
young caretaker at the Polanski 
home the night of the murders. 
Leno LaBianca, 48, president 
and chief stockholder of the 
Gateway Supermarkets. 
Rosemary LaBianca, 48, his 
wife, a pretty dark-haired wo­
man. 

The slayings took place the 
nights of Aug. 8-9-10, 1969 and 
at first police did not connect 
them despite the scrawling of 
the word "pig" in blood at both 
homes. 

Manson and his "family" 
moved from the Spahn ranch, an 
old Western movie lot on the 
outskirts of Los Angeles, several 
weeks after the murders to Goler 
Wash in Death Valley where 
they set up another commune

Apollo countdown begins 
CAPE KENNEDY (UPI) ­The countdown started smooth­ly yesterday and doctors said Apollo 14's astronauts were in good shape and "ready to fly" Sunday on their nine day half million mile round trip to the moon. 
Alan B, Shepard, 47 year old space pioneer, and rookies Stu­art A. Roosa 37 and Edgar D. Mitchell 40, passed their last major prelaunch physical exam­inations without difficulty. IX. Charles A. Berry "certified" them for flight on the basis of preliminary Iaboratory results. 
"They are certified and ready to fly" said the astonauts' chief examiner. "There are no prob­lems." 
After spending four hours in the doctor's office the three pilots returned to spacecraft trainers to bone up on critical parts of their ambitious expedi­tion to a valley on the moon. 
The countdown started promptly at 9 am EST and proceeded through the first hours without a hitch. Most of yesterday's launch pad activity

Undergraduates could benefit from the advice, experience and special skills that former under­graduates like themselves pos­sess. All student activities could benefit if the graduate students are willing to give their time. They would be, said Lorimer, "if properly approached." 
Lorimer sees the GSU as a primary organization for starting to integrate the graduate stu­dents into student life. But the problems aren't only outside the organization. "It's still new enough so that most graduate students have some resistance to it. We have the most trouble with our own members."

Their contacts here are limit­
ed to a select group of 112 
people all of whom are under 
close medical surveillance. Berry 
said he hoped to reduce that 
number of contacts during the 
next five days. 
Other aspects of preparation 
for the $400 million mission 
were going well. Four large jet 
tracking planes left nearby Pat­
rick Air Force base yesterday for 
stations on the other side of the 
world where they will support 
the mission. 
One of the jets will operated 
out of Perth, Australia, another out of Darwin, Australia and two will be based temporarily at the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. 
One of those jets will serve as a "Moonrock Express" to rush a batch of lunar samples from Samoa near the recovery area to the lunar Ireceiving laboratory 
in Houston.

The Observer story concerning Fr. Maurice Amen contained an error yesterday. The story claim­ed that Fr. Amen called in the Alcoholic Beverage Commission Police to clear up a party on the seventh floor. What he did do was threaten to call in the po­lice, but did not actually do so.

"The full significance of these changes (from single-sex education to coeducation) in other major Universities have been made stridently apparent to colleges and universities in the decade of the 60's through the influence of student opinion and the emergence ofstudent power." 
Park-Mayhew Report 
So who's doing that here? 

Who at the lhiversity of Notre Dame, is
' 

enunciating student'opinion and marshalling student support? Who is gathering student reaction to Park-Mayhew? Who is co-ordinating St. Mary's 
and Notre Dame as they prepare for the most important struggle in three years? W~o is making sure that student opinion is influencmg, and that student power is emerging? . . 
The answer to all these rhetorical q uest10ns Is, of course, nobody. Bill Wilka and Tim Conners, the Notre Dame students on the Notre Dame-St. Mary's .coeducational Steering Connittee, have been spectacularly quiet. Judging by their efforts to gather student opinion, one is forced to wonder whether they have read the report or even know of its existence. 
At St. Mary's the situation has been markedly better. The two St. Mary's women on the committee, Carol Henninger and Julie Rak (see letter) have initiated a program in which members of the St. Mary's Academic Commission (student, elective posts all) are asked their opinion about Park-Mayhew, co-education, etc. Later the St. Mary's part of the committee will intervie_w students at hall meetings. Mrs. Rak and Miss Henninger have not forgotten that their responsibility means m·aking informed student opinion a potent force when the Board of Trustees deliberate in April. 
Towards that end, The Observer will print the entire Park-Mayhew report, uncu_t, in its Friday edition. It will fill up two pages of newsprint; and contain both the recommendation and what Drs. Park and Mayhew consider a rationale for those recommendations. Then students can judge for themselves. 
Maybe a response-maybe a concerted response, maybe an angry response -will mo~e Notre Dame's student government out of Its 
self-appointed stasis and into something remotely connected with searching out and serving student opinion. But we don't know for certain. 
Let them know what you think of the report when you read it.

7HB OBSDHIER. 

The most important thing that most Notre 
Dame students did on December 9, was what they 
didn't. They didn't vote. By this nonaction they 
defeated the proposed new constitution of Krash­
na's Administration. While the motion carried 
roughly three to one, the referendum fell far short 
of the 60% voter turnout it required to be valid. 
Why did the new constitution die this strange 
sort of death? Apathy is the answer that many, 
especially student government officials, are likely 
to give. Yet to blame the poor turnout is to 
neglect several important facts. 
First, less people voted in the referendum, than who voted in the Student Senate elections, by a good thousand votes. Why are students apathetic for one election, and concerned for another, especially since the SBP emphasized the referen­dum more than the Senate elections? 
The logical answer is that there are several hundred students, who are not apathetic, and yet declined to vote in the referendum. One of the most obvious group of concerned nonvoters is those who abstained for voting on the idea that not voting would be the best way to kill the new constitution, and as such belong to the group opposed to it. 
More importantly, however, are those students who declined to vote as a sign of dissatisfaction with the existing and pro-posed constitutions. To these students, voting for Krashna's constitution would stop any meaningful reform of student government reform, while voting for the existing constitution would be saying yes to the existing monstrousity. Some of them liked the idea of the President's Council but were repelled by the almost per letter retention of major defects in the proposed constitution. Others considered the choice between an anemic, powerless Student Senate and an anemic, powerless President's Coun­cil as an insult to the student body. 
This, of course, is not apathy. By not voting they said "neither", not "I don't care". They do care, care too much to choose between two unacceptable alternatives. Who was better, Hitler 
Tuesday, January 26, 1971 

or Stalin? Do you prefer death by crucifixion or burning at the stake? If you don't choose, you're hopelessly apathetic and irresponsible. 
Unfortunately the refusal to accept such mad­ness will have bad results. In face of this fake "apathy", student leaders will tend to forget this vital issue. Misreading a demand for real improve­ment, as indifference, reform can very well be denied the student body. 
"Let the Senate reform itself". This was a popular slogan of those who opposed the new constitution. The Senate better. The SBP has offered vinegar and gall instead of real improve­
ment. The SLC is tripartite, and therefore unsuit­able. That leaves the Senate. Unfortunately some probably used Senate self-reform as an excuse for the preservation of the intolerable status quo. 
If so they have perpetrated a grave injustice on the student body. Many of those who voted against the proposed constitution are totally dis­satisfied with the present constitution, but felt that the President's Council was a step in the wrong direction. Many of those who voted for Krashna's constitution did so on a lesser of two evils basis. Together with the concerned nonvoters, these form a coalition of great importance. It is they, the people deeply concerned, to whom the Senate, and student government is now respon­sible. The bizarre nature of the referendum had split the deeply concerned and its results allow the deeply concerned to be neglected. 
Heed them well, you most impotent potentates, for their's is the wrath to fear. If not a majority of the students, the deeply concerned are a majority gf the students who vote. They demand improve­m~nt, listen to them, SBP and SLC hopefuls. 
Frustration of the deeply concerned now may mean more than Joe Blow isn't SBP. There is a great deal of apathy, and hundreds of the deeply concerned are transformed to that dread lethargy each year. One cannot say for sure that this is the last chance for ND student government, but one can't be sure it isn't.

Review of ''Love Story" 
What can you say about a 25 week old movie that is deadly? Love Story could quite easily, and perhaps more aptly have been retitled 
The Love Machine. 
It has quite the same effect as peeling onions. No better, no worse. Like onions, it is the smell of the movie that makes one cry, not one's emotions. Love Story bypasses any true emotional response, and simply lays seige to the tear producing mechanisms of the eyes. 
Like any well oiled machine, it needs fuel. The fuel in this movie comes in the' person of Ali MacGraw. Gasoline Ali plays, or rather tries to play, one of the most confusing roles since Bert Lahr's 7 character performance in the play, The Beauty Part. She is supposed to be a musical genius, the world's biggest wise acre, a Radcliffe librarian, student, the poor daughter of an Italian pastry baker, the alluring Ali MacGi'aW: and a fashion plate. 
The size of her wardrobe surely rivals anything seen at St. Mary's, and could only have been brought over from her last movie, Goodbye Columbus, in which she played a rich Jewish girl. 
But her trouble goes deeper than her 
clothes, Gasoline Ali hasn't changed at all 
either. She is still Ali MacGraw fashion 
Model, not Ali MacGraw actress. 
Everyone knows that she dies after 
only 3 years of marriage. Everyone also 
knows that they are supposed to cry at 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
the death scene. But then we all knew to cry when Mickey Rooney's dog got run over in Boy's Town. Miss MacGraw is certainly no dog (in any sense) but her 
character is no deeper than Lassie's. It is as thin as the film it is printed on. As thin as an onion peel. 
The other member of the Love Machine duo is Ryan O'Neal. He is by far the best in the film. But then he had a role, Not a role with much depth, but at least he had a role. He plays a rather convincing Harvard hockey jock, who is also Ali's lover and a nice guy. 
In the course of the film he manages to make it through Harvard Law School, but appears rather foolish for fighting with his father, whom he affectionately calls "Stone Face." Although in Eric Segal's book it is believable that he can hate his cold fish father, it is impossible to believe he .could hate the miscast Ray Milland. 
The aging Ray Milland, appearing for the first time without a toupee, is such a gracious and warm person though he is completely unconvincing in the part of the cold rich father. They seem to be feuding over nothing, and Ryan O'Neal can't even seem to vocalize his feelings. Segal has thrown in this generation gap simply to sell his movie. 
If you go see Love Story be sure to bring along some kleenex. It can make you cry. But this psuedo-romance between the beautiful people is not satisfying in the least. 
Segal has tossed in all the ingredients mental superficiality is what love is all to make his smooth running Love Story about, I would just as soon do without. machine the perfect box office smash, If you want to cry either go to the but it is too simple, too slick to really A&P and buy an onion, or go see Love have much meaning.

Dear Editor: 
Would you or one of your staff like to 
earn a very fast $50 fee? 
We're looking for useable leads for an on-campus story or photo feature illus­trating the new clean-shaven look among college males. 
If you know of a newsworthy "shave-off" situation on your campus, just drop us a line about it. If we use your lead as the exclusive subject of a story or photo session, we'll send you a check in the amount of $50. 
Here are some hypothetical examples as a guideline ....you'll probably find much better real material to suggest.. .. 
.... a sorority or campus women's club launches a fund-raising drive by offering their services as lady barbers (hair cuts and shaves); 
.... a campus organization sets up a "shaving station" for students in a high traffic location to dramatize "shaving" of funds for student activities; 
.... a business school professor impresses his students with the importance of appearance in a tight job market by keeping a safety razor and shaving sup­plies available in the classroom. Student beards disappear in direct ratio to the decrease in job opportunities; 
.... a political group holds a "shave-off" to symbolize its new resolution to use established methods and work "within the system". 
Be sure to include your phone number when you write. If the lead sounds good, we'll want to call you for details.

A Lenten Retreat into books 

Originally, I had intended to become a cowboy, and for the first six years of school, I got booted and spurred every evening in the hours before supper, and I practised riding a broomstick across the open fields of the little fishing village in Maine where I grew up. Obviously, the demand for cowboys was limited aiong that rugged coast where the lobsters dance on the incoming tide; and one morning I hung up my stirrups just as I was about to become bow-legged from being too long in the saddle, and I rode the tidal plains no more. A couple of 
-years ago, while visiting a cattle ranch in Arizona, I realized I never would have made it as a cowpoke when a full-blooded stallion buckled at the knees and fainted as I attempted to mount his back. Appar­ently the poor beastie thought the moun­tains had collapsed and were falling upon him. 
So now, in the middle years of life, as one who has moved from the old corral to the sheepfold, I am serving for a while as a University Chaplain, and students approach me to ask: "What does a Thi­versity Chaplain do, anyway?" 
"Why," I say, trying to look as merely ornamental as a field lily, "He spins not, neither does he toil." Solomon in all his glory could probably have thought up a more inspired answer, but it seems to me that if a kid has to ask what a chaplain does, I am already a failure in that kid's estimate. I refuse to tell him l am a wound-dresser of the spirit, or a pro­fessional Christian, or one of the Jesus-people who makes a living from practising the ethic of turning the other cheek, because lots of people on campus are also busy with the ancillary chores of the Redemption without the benefit of title as a high priest among the Munch­kins. 
So, for several years now, I have lived among students as a quaint, stout chap who follows with interest the toilet habits of a mutt named Darby O'Gill, and who is the confidant of moppets and urchins in their games around the altar; a man who is slightly cracked in his affection for candlelight Masses, where he can hide his fleshly immensity, like a shy elephant in search of nightfall, in the deep shadows of the sanctuary. 
At heart, of course, I am something 
more than a Friar Tuck who returns to 
his hall, after dining in Elkhart, cheerful 
and fragrant with the odors of bourbon; 
under the Chaplain's ven e er, I have an identity unknown to the animals and children of my playtime, and only half suspected by the students who demand keys and hot water from me in the Rector's office in Keenan. Most simply put, I am a teacher of literature, presently (by choice) unemployed. I have been friends with Moby Dick· for years. As a 
lover of verse, I once got frostbite of the navel from wandering through snowdrifts to pluck a twig from Emily Dickinson's forstyhia bush in Amherst, Massachusetts. Most recently, I waited two wintery hours for a glimpse of W ,H. Auden returning with mutton chops to his pad at 77 St. Mark's Place in Greenwich Village, and afterwards I memorized his telephone number from a New York directory (GR 3-0 3 3 I). Impeccable credentials these may not be, but in a teacher of literature, they must be admired as a sign of 
sincerity. 

During Lent this year, I would like to plan a series of Sunday evening happen­ings --a Retreat into Books, if you will --in which I, as chaplain, might borrow from my own experience as a teacher of literature. Take King Lear, for example, that greatest of all plays written in our language: it is the story of a tragically herioc old man driven to a magnificent madness and rage against heaven and life; it is the archetypal tale of Lear's suffering and redemption in a pre-Christian world as cosmically indifferent to mankind as is 
.that of any alienated story-teller's world 
advertised in the pages of the Times on 
Sunday (Just recall the words of the blinded Gloucester: "As flies are to wan­ton boys, so are we to the gods: they kill us for their sport."). 
Members of a Sunday evening discus­sion group, thinks old ex-cowboy Griff to himself, could open their imaginations to the spectacle of the fiercely-tempered old king tamed by suffering into gentleness and into a regality physicked of pomp. 
Then, if the reflections on Lea'r have been intense and prolonged enough, the group might stop for a supper break: a cup of oyster stew, perhaps, with appro­priately Lenten, fish-or-cheese kinds of sandwiches. Afterwards, the group could compose a Liturgy suitable to the tone and mood of the occasion, with a homily that uses the truths of the play to 
illuminate the mystery of suffering and redemption as it seems revealed to us in the passion and death o the Christ-life. 
The results of this kind of group study could be parochial enough to stir the playwright's bones from the dust after the manner of the ghost of Hamlet's father, unless Lear is understood as a work perfect and complete within itself. As such, one should not force meanings upon the play that can be found only in the documents of faith, nor should the work be read as a case-study in geriatrics. But once we have been stirred by the experience of the play, I think we canconfront the ancienttruthsof Passion-tide with insights never discov­ered in Paul, Augustine, or Aquinas. I also think that Shakespeare can be as informa­tive to our dilemmas of existential faith and Christology as anything we have been reading lately on the pages of "Are You Running With Me, Jesus?". 
Other authors who might be read in a 
Lenten Retreat into Books are Dostoevski 
(especially the pages closest to, and inclu­
sive of, the "Legend of the Grand Inquisi­
tor in the Brothers Karamazov); Melville's 
"Billy Budd"; Peter De Vries' Blood of 
the Lamb; MacLeish'sJ. B.; Hemingway's 
Old Man and the Sea, just to name a few 
of the shorter works. 
This campus will surely recover quickly 
from its fit of euphoria at the news of a 
chaplain's project for the Sundays of 
Lent. Hopefully, however, there will be a 
dozen students who feel that the ultimate 
religious experience has not been 
achieved through a reading of Gibran's The Prophet. If they are willing to expose their minds to the indignity of the stale insights and yellowed notes of an erst­while teacher with faded charms, I wish they would send postcards to l 20 Keenan Hall, and I will begin to plan menus for our little suppers together in the late winter twilights.

~By the author of Rally Round the Flag, BoyR ... DohirGilliR ... t'lr.) 
The Beard of Avon 
Some English teachers insist that Shakespeare couldn't possibly have written the plays attributed to him because the plays are so full of lofty poetry and he was but the son of an ignorant country butcher. 
"Faugh!" say I. What does being a butcher have to do with poetry? It so happens that my own butcher, Wally J. Sigafoos, who never went past third grade has written some of the loveliest poems I ever saw-exquisite things like "Hail to thee, blithe suet" and "Prime ribs do not a pot roast make" and "How do I weigh thee? Let me count the thumbs" and many, many others, too numerous to list here, in­cluding "La belle ham sans merci" and "They're hanging Danny's cleaver in the morning" and "Look on my rump, ye mighty, and despair." I am pleased to say that Mr. Sigafoos will publish a slim volume of his verse next spring, called "NoMan Is a Brisket." Watch for it. 

So let's have no more snide allegations that genius is confined to the upper classes. In fact, the greatest genius the world has ever known, Isaac Newton, was the son of a humble second baseman. (Not only humble, but also unemployed because baseball didn't get invented till a hundred years later.) But these Jowly origins didn't stop Newton from making his great discoveries, culminating of course in the third Jaw of motion: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." 
How true and eloquent these words still are! Take, for example, Miller High Life Beer. Have a sip of Miller; that's the action. Now what is the reaction? Pure pleasure, that's what. Pleasure, delight, contentment, chuckles, twinkles and wreathed smiles. And why such a happy reaction? Because you started with such a happy beer! 
Miller drinkers know their beer is gloriously unique. There simply is no other like it. How can there be? For more than 115 years Miller's marvelous brewing formula has been a secret known to only one man in the entire world-Miller's chief brewmaster-and believe me, there is absolutely no way to sweat the secret out of him. Not only is the formula written in an unbreakable code, but it is also written in in­visible ink! And don't think you can make the invisible ink visible by using heat; it so happens the formula is written on an ice cube. 
But I digress. Shakespeare's most important play is, of course, Hamlet or, as it is sometimes called, A Midsummer's Macbeth. This play tells in living color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have a first folio in Shakespeare's own handwriting which frankly is pretty lousy.) Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by the sight of this ghost (or goat) that he stabs Polonius and drowns his fat cousin, Butt Malmsey. Thereupon the King gets sore and banishes Hamlet to a leather factory, hollering, "Get thee to a tannery!" Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food till Laertes gets sore and sends her to a restaurant, hollering, "Get thee to a beanery!" Ophelia gets sore too, but she has nobody to holler at except her little dog whom she chases out of the castle, crying, "Out, damned Spot!" She is arrested and fined twenty farthings for cussing, but Portia in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence reduced to life im­prisonment. Thereupon King Lear and his three daughters, Patti, Maxine and Laverne, wishing to restore peace in the realm, decree a day of feasting and squat tag. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time till Hamlet returns disguised as Banquo's ghost (or goat). Well, nat­urally they all get sore when they see Hamlet and pretty soon there is a whacking big fight in which Hamlet kills whoever is around. Finally Hamlet is himself killed by Brer Bodkin, the preacher. 
The play ends with the little dog Spot reciting these immortal lines as he digs a grave for Hamlet: 
Thou wouldst, if couldst, undo thy wrongs, poor Dane, 
Thou wouldst recall thy blows and take thy kicks back, 
For now thou knowst that he who would his friends retain 
Should stab them not, but buy instead a Miller Six-pack. 
* * * 
Yea and verily. And tarry not, goodfriend,Jor once thou triest Miller High Life, the Champagne of Beers, thou'lt scorn to change thy state with kings! Get thee to a brewery!

The sex education team of Dr. and Mrs. J. C. Willke will speak tonight in the Library Auditori­um on the subject "Abortion: Social and Medical Aspects."
 
During the lecture, which begins at 8 p.m., the Willkes will show a 9-minute film showing an actual suction-type abortion of a wo­man two and one half months pregnant. According to the two educators, the film is "very ex­plicit, specific, and used for teaching in medical schools." 
In addition to the film and the lecture, the Willkes will be available for a question and ans­

The talk is presented by the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Aca­demic Cbnnission and -admis­sion is free. The Willkes have written four books and numer­ous articles for periodicals on sex education and related sub­jects. Every year they devote several days to a tour across the country, speaking to groups on the subjects of family life and sexuality. In an average year they will speak to over 50,000 people in over 40 major cities and appear on almost 100 radio and TV shows.

tial purposes but then admitted that he was not advocating tax­ing Notre Dame and he realized that no new housing starts could be built on campus. This ap­parent contradiction was never explained by either him or any city representative. 
Edmund 9-epan, Chairman of the Notre Dame Board of­Trustees, led off the University's presentation in counter to the city's arguments, and expressed the school's primary fear that annexation would lead in the future to the city violating their tax exempt status. 
City officials repeatedly said last night that the city has no intention of threatening the uni­versity's tax exempt status and never will have this intention. Every university spokesman stressed that it is not possible to fore cast the intentions of the City Council even a few years. ahead.

Bella receives first Business Teacher Award 
The students of the Business College have selected Mr. Salva­tore Bella as the first recipient of their new Business Students' Teacher Award. The award will be presented at a business meet­ing later this semester. 
The award was suggested by the· Students' Business College Council. They distributed stan­dardized forms to each business class. The form asked each stu­dent to rank professors as excel­lent, good, average or poor in regard to eleven aspects of teach­ing. Some of the categories in­eluded: knowledge of subject matter, ability in stimulating the desire to learn, tolerance to disa­greement and ability to evaluate student performance. The com­bined scores for each professor were graded by dividing by the number of students taught, so as to prevent professors with large classes from having an advan­tage. 
The Business College plans to award this honor each semester. The professor with the highest average will be given a trophy and have his name engraved on a plaque which will be permanent­ly erected in the lobby of the Hayes-Healy Building. The pro­fessor placing second will receive a special mention, and the teach­er in third position will receive an honorable mention.

chairman of the Civil Rights Commission. Mullins said the students would pay more atten­tion to the inner city problems if they were adequately informed. After those in favor of the ordinances had spoken, the microphone was turned over to Rev. Edmund P.Joycewho 
went on to present official ar­guments against annexation for the three schools. 
The floor was returned to the public after Joyce had spoken so that those against the issue could express their opinions. Paul Gil­bert of Gilbert's Mens 9-ores and Frank Sullivan, a well known area architect were among those who addressed the council. Al­though they were part of the University's program they said they were also speaking as citi­zens of South Bend. 
Gilbert charged the city is taking Notre Dame and St. Mary's "for granted" He cited the Lobund Laboratory where the cure for cancer may be found someday and the dis­covery of synthetic rubber as two major contributions for which nothing has been asked in return. He refuted arguments that the city's economy is dying by adding that bank deposits, and the South Bend Tribunes' circulation are at all time highs and also the new high rises erec­ted in recent years. Gilbert con­
eluded saying that Notre Dame has brought "more prestige, more honor and more glory" to the city than any other institu­
tion. 
Sullivan expressed his loyalty to South Bend and said he did not rule out the possibility of 
annexation in the future. How­ever, he believes that this is not the right time for the move and urged the council members to vote down the ordinance. 
The main concern expressed by Sullivan was over the issue of the University tax exempt sta­tus. He said he believed Mayor Lloyd M. Allen's statement that no taxes would be assesed and Allen's statement that he would not run for reelection. Sullivan then wondered what would hap­pen to Allen's no tax promise when the next mayor takes of­fice and says, "I don't care about those promises, we need ... "

A theft in the student parking lot D-2 resulted in heavv losses for one student. The list of missing items includes a tape player, ten tapes, a health kit and a tachometer. 
Another car, which had been illegally parked near the Memo­rial Library, was subject to dam­age. The exact nature and extent of this damage was undetermin­ed. 
A student report of a Rose­land police car on campus over the weekend was confirmed by the security chief. Mr. Pears ex­plained that thepolicehad assisted Notre Dame security in apprehending a drunken man who had run the main gate. He noted that the man was not a Notre Dame student. 
Another student sent a packet to the security office on Monday morning which contained a doz­
en tickets collected off wind~­shields in fhe parking areas. "If this anonymous person considered his act as a great assistance to the students, he was definitely wrong," said Pears. The director indicated that the students who received these tickets will still be respon­sible for paying them, which will cause problems since they are unaware that they were ticketed. It will also deny the unknowing students a chance to appeal the tickets. Mr. Pears was unsure as 
to a solution to this problem.
