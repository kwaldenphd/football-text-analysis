Gorbachev charges 'misrepresentation' in summit account 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev accused the White House yesterday of "gross misrepresentation" in its accounts of the Reykjavik summit, but he said the super-· powers could still work out their problems. 
A member of the Soviet sum­mit delegation, meanwhile, reiterated Soviet claims that President Reagan had agreed in principle to a proposal to eliminate all Soviet and U.S. nuclear weapons in 10 years. 
The Reagan administration has disputed the claim. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday in Washington that Reagan dis­cussed abolition of all nuclear arms during the summit but never proposed more than the elimination of all ballistic mis­siles in 10 years. 
Gorbachev's statement was the latest in a series of efforts to counter U.S. accounts of what the superpowers tenta­tively agreed to before they reached a stalemate at the summit over the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars." 
Gorbachev said the proposals included an initial 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons, elimination of all medium-range missiles in Europe, a ban on the testing of space weapons and a nuclear test ban.

Sociologist discusses Nicaraguan autonomy 
By JIM RILEY Assistant News Editor 
Greater self-rule for parts of Nicaragua and the current po­litical strength of those groups in power were discussed by Carlos Vilas, speaking Monday night in the Memorial Library Auditorium. 
Vilas, an Argentine sociologist who has lived in Nicaragua since 1980, outlinet;i the problems the peoples of the Atlantic coast region of Nicaragua as the revolutionary (Sandinista) government has tried to install its system of rule in that region. 
At first, the government tried to force the coast people into 

.-.., the revolution, said Vilas. But now the government realizes that it has to adapt the revolu­tion to meet the needs of the various ethnic peoples of the coast, Vilas said. Vilas said the coast people have felt caught in the middle, not being Sandinistas but not being contras either. Their neutrality has been violated by both sides, said Vilas. 
The coast region " .. .is a very large part of the country with a very small population, but with large problems caused by ethnic diversity,'' said Vilas. 
The region is occupied by several ethnic groups, all of which are distinct from each other and not integrated into the rest of the country, accor­ding to Vilas. The region's iso­lation is partly due to geogra­phy and is complicated by the contras who attack transporta­tion as part of their struggle, said Vilas. 

Carlos Vilas 
The problem the government has faced is that revolutionary theories paid no attention to ethnicity in Latin America, Vilas said. 
There was a reduction of the coast communities to their eco­nomic status, said Vilas. There also was a cultural reduction of the various ethnic groups. These groups "were reduced to just the symbolic aspects of their ethnicity" such as their different languages and differ­ent phenotypes, according to Vilas. 
This reductionist approach was the main problem during the early years of the revolu­tion, the problem which kept the people of the coast from relating peacefully with the government. 
Many people from the coast were relocated by the govern­ment away from areas that would be the scenes of battles with the contras and into rigidly-structured towns, said Vilas. 
These relocations and the government's policies stifled the groups' cultures and caused dissatisfaction with the revolutionary government, ac­cording to Vilas . 
Recently, the revolutionary government has acknowledged its mistakes and have taken two major steps, Vilas said. First, they are setting free coast people who are caught fighting the government. Second, they have undertaken an autonomy project. 
"The government formed the National Autonomy Commission for broad discus­sion of autonomy," Vilas said. "This has been difficult since there is little history of self-

SAN FRANCISCO -A dis­gruntled former Air Force man was arrested yesterday and charged with trying to deliver secrets about an Air Force reconnaissance program to the Soviet Union, authorities said. 
Allen John Davies of San Jose, a naturalized American citizen who works for Ford Aerospace and Communica­tions Corp., was arrested by FBI agents in Palo Alto, south of San Francisco, said U.S. At­torney Joseph Russoniello. 
The charge is punishable by up to life in prison. 
On Sept. 22, Davies met with an undercover agent who posed as a representative of the So­viet consulate in San Francisco and offered information about the Air Force program, accor­ding to a sworn statement by an FBI agent filed in federal court. 
Davies provided "detailed verbal information" about the program as well as a "hand drawing depicting various aspects" of the program, ac­cording to the statement by Agent Roger Edstrom. 
He said much of the informa­tion Davies provided was clas­sified as secret, according to Air Force Maj. Boyd Lease, director of the reconnaissance program. 
Davies, 33, said he had worked on the reconnaissance program while in the Air Force in 1983 and 1984, the agent said. 

Grace Hall debates begin with topic of gays at ND 
By GREG LUCAS News Staff 
Official recognition of the group Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will be the first topic of discussion in Grace Hall's debate tournament tonight at 9 in the pit at Grace Hall. 
The tournament is a single elimination contest among teams of four from the ten floors of Grace Hall and will feature nine topical debates on nine different nights. 
Participants will practice a formal debate format which will be followed by questions and comments from the audience. 
Native Irishman Joe McKenna, assistant rector of Grace Hall, designed the tournament based on the popularity that public debate receives in Ireland. "The beauty of debate," said McKenna, "is that both sides are presented and the issue is left up to the audi­ence." 
All interested students are encouraged to come and lis­ten and contribute at the debates. "People who sit in their rooms and gripe about the system are now being given a forum," said McKenna.

The Student Senate dis­cussed possibilities for differ­ent laundry plans for men in a meeting last night. 
"If you know you do not use $50 every semester (in laundry), why be forced to use it up?" asked Sophomore Class President Pat Cooke. 
Cooke noted that there are different meal plans, saying a similar system might be feasible for male laundry ser­vice as well. He suggested pos­sible $20 and $30 plans in addi­tion to the present mandatory fee of $50 per semester. 
Senator Brian Holst sugges­ted a completely optional laundry service for men. "What I think is a contradiction is financial aid. (The adminis­tration) says they are not going to take another person's money to pay for financial aid ... But people who do not use the laundry service are subsidizing other people's services." 
Holst also proposed laundry facilities in male dorms, al­though realizing the dorms "have not supplied them be­cause the buildings are not equipped." 
The Senate also discussed a possible stand on divestment of the University's holdings in companies in South Mrica. 
According to Senator Mike Jaeger, however, most students are "apathetic." 
"Most students said they thought the administration had a good grip of what was going on," said Jaeger. 
Senator John Gardiner said the Senate should "force the issue" upon the administration and the student body, in part because many students have not educated themselves on the South African situation. 
In other matters, Off­Campus Commissioner Tracey Thoman said RASTA's appeal to remain as a University or­ganization has failed. 
Citing a letter from Vice­President for Student Mfairs Father David Tyson, Thoman said, "They are banned this · year, with a possibility they can exist with probationary status next year." RASTA must appeal again next year if they wish to become a legal group on campus. 
Student Body President Mike Switek said the United Way campaign is slated to begin on November 3. He added "the crayons will be back in force," in a reference to their presiden­tial campaign last year in which posters were drawn using crayons. 
The Senate also reported plans to enlarge the bus stop at the main circle, because the University is the number two tourist attraction in Indiana.

debated topic will judge each debate. The decision rendered is not based on the personal views of the judge. "It's not whether the judge agrees, it's who presents the more cohesive argument," McKenna said. 
Jack Lee, a senior partici­pant in the tournament, said, "I have never been involved in debate but it seemed like it would be an enjoyable thing to try. You always need a few people to get the ball rolling," said Lee. 
The sides of the debate are chosen randomly. In other words, a participant may be debating against his personal beliefs. "It is a growing expe­rience to present an argument from a pomt of view other than your own," said McKenna. "It opens your mind to see that there is another side," McKenna said. 
All members of the winning floor in Grace Hall who attend at least one debate will be taken out to dinner in the Fac­ulty Dining Room of South Dining Hall. McKenna said, "To encourage people to come we are having a free drawing at each debate for food vouch­ers at Sarge's food service."

government in Latin America," he added. 
The autonomy program has taken different approaches since each of the ethnic groups of the coast is so different, said Vilas. Some groups have desired the right to speak their native language when dealing with government business. 
Others have emphasized re­unification of families dis­rupted by relocation or have desired economic improve­ment. 
The government has recently taken two major actions toward autonomy, said Vilas. They have officially recognized the Nicarauguan people as a multi-cultural one, and have of­ficially declared the languages of the various ethnic groups to be official languages of Nicaragua.

Director of institute 
responds to proposal 
Dear Editor: 
In your issue of Thursday, Oct. 16, you carried a letter to the editor written by my friend and colleague, Jay Dolan, in which he expressed his indignation about the new memorial on the Notre Dame campus. 
While I think that he is, of course, entitled to his own opinion about the value and significance of the memorial, it doesn't particularly strengthen his argument to indulge in such flights of hyperbole as talking about renaming the Institute for International Peace Studies the War Institute. 
Our new Institute is dedicated un­equivocally to the study of the relation­ships between peace, justice and human rights and it doesn't help anyone very much to suggest that there is anything hypocritical in the Univer­sity's sponsorship of our programs. 
John J. Gilligan Acting Director, Institute for Interna­tional Peace Studies 
Peace organizers miss point of new memorial Dear Editor: 
We wish to respond and voice our opinion on the recent article entitled, "Memorial's dedication draws fire," which appeared in the Oct. 17 edition of The Observer. We feel that Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace organization, and their spokesman, Joe Ross, do not understand the purpose and meaning behind the Clarke Memorial Fountain and the presence of the military and the ROTC units at the memorial's dedication. 
The Clarke Memorial Fountain was built in remembrance of the ser­vicemen who bravely gave their lives in the role of protecting our nation so that the likes of Joe Ross and others could have the freedom to object to the presence of the armed forces of which these servicemen were a part. Without the actions of these brave men, Joe Ross would today be speaking Russian, drinking vodka, and casting his all im­portant vote for Gorbachev. 
Ifthe memorial is in honor of military servicemen, we see nothing wrong with the presence of military personnel and the A-7 jet aircraft "fly-over" sched­uled for the Mass and ceremonies. Yet Ross says, "To work for peace does not mean celebrating Mass in the midst of warplanes." Hey, tell that to the chaplain on the carrier.

Mets' Knight plays hero, namedMVP 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Ray Knight, the man the New York Mets didn't want, turned out to be the one they needed the most, and was named most valuable player of the World Series last night. 
Knight, who batted .391 with nine hits in 23 at-bats, hit the seventh-inning home run that broke a 3-3 tie and sparked the Mets to an 8-5 victory over Boston in the seventh game. 
Knight was being fitted for goat horns in Game 6 after his throwing error gave Bos­ton a lead that could have ended the Mets' season. But he came back to score the winning run in the bottom of the lOth inning of Saturday night's 6-5 victory, and then played the hero in Game 7. 
"I was so down the other night because of the error," Knight said. "Just goes to show you, if you keep fight­ing, anything can happen. 
Giants down Redskins behind Morris' rushing 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
Joe Morris rushed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, including a 13-yard sweep of right end for the winning points with 1:38 to play, as the New York Giants defeated the Washington Redskins 27-20 last night, creat­ing a three-way tie for first place in the NFC East. 
Morris, who carried 31 times, followed big blocks by Chris Godfrey and Maurice Carthon and then sidestepped the final five yards into the end zone. It capped a 10 play, 81-yard drive, with Morris carrying five times for 66 yards. 
The victory gave New York a 6-2 mark and put the Giants in a first-place tie with Wash-. ington and Dallas. It also nul­lifed a great comeback for Washington and outstanding performances by quarterback Jay Schroeder, who completed 22 of 40 passes for 420 yards, and wide receiver Gary Clark, who had 11 receptions for 241 yards. 
However, Schroeder missed 
on his last attempt of the game 
after driving the Redskins to 
the Giants' 35 in the final min­
ute. 

The Redskins rallied for 17 straight second-half points against the NFL's best-rated defense to tie the game 20-20 on a 29-yard field goal by Max Zendejas with 4:20 to go. 
The field goal, like all the Redskins points in the rally, was set up by a big play. This time it was a 47-yard pass from Schroeder to Art Monk. 
In the third-quarter, the Giants defense blew a deep coverage and Schroeder hit Clark on a 42-yard touchdown pass on a third-and-19 play. On Washington's previous series, Schroeder hit Ricky Sanders on a 71-yard pass play to the New York 1, setting up a short touch­down run by George Rogers. 
The Giants had opened a 20-3 lead midway through the third quarter as Allegre booted field goals of 37 and 44 yards, Morris scored on an 11-yard run and Phil Simms hit Bobby Johnson on a 30-yard scoring pass.

Seorts Mets top Red Sox to take World Series title 
Knight's home run ignites climactic Mets' comeback 

Notre Dame ends Air Force jinx with basic running attack 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Ray Knight ig­nited a three-run rally in the seventh inning with a home run, climaxing another New York comeback and sending the Mets to their second World Series championship with a 8-5 victory last night over the Bos­ton Red Sox. 
The Mets scored three runs in the sixth inning, two on a single by Keith Hernandez, to chase two-game Series winner Bruce Hurst and tie the score 3-3. Then Knight led off the seventh with a homer to left­center that started the Mets to their first World Series title since 1969. 
Hernandez capped the inning with a sacrifice fly for a 6-3 lead. 
The Mets still had one last obstacle to overcome as the Red Sox rallied for two runs in the eighth and had the tying run on second base with no one out. 
But Jesse Orosco came out of the bullpen and got Rich Ged­man on a line drive to second, struck out Dave Henderson and got pinch-hitter Don Baylor to ground out to short.

Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz will not concede that any victory is an easy one, but pick­ing up his second win at the Irish helm was kind of like reading a second-grade textbook. 
See Steve run. See Tim run. See Anthony run. And see the 2-4 Notre Dame football team run all over the Air Force Academy last Saturday after­noon, posting a 31-3 triumph over the baffled Falcons. 
The victory snapped a four­year streak of consecutive Air Force wins over the Irish. 
"I'm really happy for our football players," said Holtz, "especially our seniors. Air reliever AI Nipper. Orosco, bat­ting for only the fourth time this season, singled in Knight with the eighth New York run. 
Winners of major league­leading 108 games during the season, the big question about the Mets was how they would hold up under pressure. They had never been tested. 
But they won their third Na­tional League pennant in a tense six-game playoff with Houston, culminating in the longest postseason game in his­tory, a 6-5, 16-inning victory in the Astrodome. 
Then, after losing the first two games of the World Series at home, they became only the second team in World Series history to come back to win. The only other team to do it was last year's Kansas City Royals. 
The Red Sox came back with Hurst on three days' rest, taking advantage of a rainout of Game 7 on Sunday night. It was a gamble because Red Sox Manager John McNamara had said Hurst didn't pitch well on three days' rest. In his only other appearance this season on three days' rest, he worked

Force has beaten us in some real close ballgames the last four years. 
"We had a lot of big plays from a lot of different people. I felt that our defense just kept us in the ballgame the whole way, and we felt we had enough points to win by the end of the third quarter.'' 
Notre Dame scored all 31 points in the first three quar­ters, after falling behind on a Chris Blasy field goal with 55 seconds to go in the opening period. 
But then Notre Dame began to run and run and run.

Junior flanker Tim Brown caught the ensuing kickoff on the Irish 5-yard line in the right corner, and broke back toward the middle. While Air Force's contain man slipped on the play, Brown broke one feeble attempt a:t a tackle at his own 15 and promptly bursted up the middle for a 95-yard touchdown return, giving Notre Dame the lead for good. 
"When I cut back to the middle, there wasn't anyone there," Brown said. "I was just looking at the goal line and I felt one guy hit my leg. It was just off to the races from there. 
"We've been coming close (to breaking one) in the last couple of weeks and we finally got one. I really needed this. I'm starting to settle down and play the kind of ball I know I can play."

heading into the contest, but it was clear from the outset that Notre Dame's defense was up to the challenge on this day. 
Vicious hits by linebacker Cedric Figaro and strong safety George Streeter (replacing the injured Brandy Wells) caused Air Force fumbles in the first half, both of which were pounced on by Figaro. 
"Today we came out and at­tacked them," Figaro said. "Before (the past two years) we played more of a slow-play defense, which I felt hurt us. Today we didn't wait for them -we went out and attacked." 
Streeter, in addition to causing a fumble, tied Mike Kovaleski with eight tackles on the day, including three for 
ND soccer scores 'biggest win ever' 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
In a game described by Irish head coach Den­nis Grace as "the biggest win ever in the history of Notre Dame soccer," the Irish defeated the University of Conneticut, 2-1, in overtime. 
A crowd of 4,300 witnessed the Huskies' first loss at home since Oct. 24, 1984, when they lost to Penn State, 2-1. Notre Dame also ended UConn's eight-game winning streak. 
"We had very good team defense," said Grace. "We had an excellent work rate, our team was good. It's amazing what you can get done when you play together. Togetherness is what's making this team good." 
Irish forward-midfielder Pat Murphy scored the winning goal in overtime on an assist from Johnny Guignon. 
losses, and also broke up two passes. 
Air Force settled for only 186 rushing yards to Notre Dame's 237, and completed only five passes despite trailing for most of the game. Junior quarter­back Jim TomaJlo, usuaJly a threat on the ground, was held to just 12 net yards rushing; 
Back-up signal-caller Dee Dowis was intercepted late in the fourth quarter by Irish free safety Steve Lawrence, adding to the Falcon turnover total. 
That made Holtz' strategy quite simple -run.
