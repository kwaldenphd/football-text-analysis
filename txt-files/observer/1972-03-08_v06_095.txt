Brinkmann says 
CAC debt not as 

bad as it sounds 
by Don Ruane Observer Executive Editor 
Admitting partial contract mismanagement, Cultural Arts Commissioner Bob Brinkmann said Tuesday that CAC potetial debt has been blown out of proportion. 
Brinkmann, in reply to Student Government Treasurer Cass Rejent's statements of Feb. 29 that the debt might be whittled to $1,600 by the year's end, said there are good signs that deposits totaling $6.250 will be returned, that a projected loss of $1,000 has been eliminated, and that much of the remaining debt could be eliminated by a series of films the commission is attempting to schedule. 
"If we do finish in red, it isn't going to be that much," he concluded. 
Explaining the mismanagement claim by Rejent, the commissioner said the mistake may be that the CAC deals with smaller booking agencies which "care for the artist," and can provide cheaper deals. Since the agency is small, and "legitimate," according to Brinkmann, its money is invested, and it is hard to get deposits returned. 
Rejent complained last week that the CAC signed contracts without protecting itself with an escape clause. As a result, according to Rejent, Neil Young was able to cancel because of illness, and Sea Train could raise its fee $2,5000 after deposits totalling $6,250 had been placed. 
Brinkmann said negotiations to return the deposits appear promising, and claimed there are no contracts providing the CAC with escape when it involves a live performer. 
Admitting this leaves the CAC unprotected, Brinkmann added that this situation exists with both large and small booking agencies, because live performers are placed on tours and a cancellation would cost the agency money. 
The treasurer also claimed Brinkmann has "unilateral control" over all contracts. The commissioner's answer is that he must approve all contracts for the CAC, as does each commissioner for his own area. 
When asked who reads a contract before it is signed, Brinkmann said the commission member handling the contract not only reads it but also signs it. It is then given to Brinkmann, who generally rubber stamps the smaller contracts, but reads the more expensive ones before approving. 
No other check for inconsistencies is made within the Student Union, according to its director, Bill McGrath. If legal problems arise an attempt is made to solve them through correspondence, before the Student Union turns to Phillip J. Faccenda, University Vice President and General Counsel, for legal aid. 
Most contracts are cosigned by someone from the Student Affairs office, usually the assistant vice president, Fr. James L. Shilts, according to Brink­mann.

1972 -73 schedule starts classes early 
by Jerry Lutkus Observer News Editor 
The University Academic Council has scheduled the 1972-73 school year opening for Thursday, August 31, and removed the ROTC departments from the College of Arts and Letters placing them administrativelv under the Office of the Provost. 

The earlier opening date for the fall semester is necessitated by an eight-day Thanksgiving break and a three day weekend October 14-16. 
University ProvostJamesT. Burtchaell explained that the longer semester was necessary because, "We felt a break would be advisable." This is the second year that the University is on its present schedule and, as Fr. Burtchaell noted, "This is the first time we've had a semester without a break and it is fatiguing." 
semester still short 
According to Fr. Burtchaell, the semester as it stands now, has too few class days. Even with the addition, he said, it still will be only 70 days. 
Fred Giuffrida, student member of the Council, claimed that presently the first semester was "too long." "The people needed a break. Since a lot of people go home now anyway, they might as well have a week at Thanksgiving." 
The assurance that the dorms and library will be open over the break was given by Public In­formation Director Richard Conklin. But Guiffrida disagreed. "We want to make sure the place is open over the break, but they didn't make that sure yet." 
Further University reasoning was provided by Leo Corbaci, dean of administration. Corbaci related that the new move by the University is part of a marked trend by colleges and universities for pre-Labor Day openings. 
two breaks in spring 
The calendar calls for the first semester to end December 14, and be followed by a week of final exams. The University reopens for the spring session on January 14. Two breaks will provide respite during the second semester, March 9 to 19 and April18 to 24. The last class day of the semester is May 8, again followed by a week of finals. 
Yesterday's Observer published the calendar for next semester as it had been released in the 1972-73 Academic Bulletin for the College of Business Administration. The only essential differences between the published calendar and yesterday's 
release are the starting date has been moved from August 29 to August 31, and the three day weekend has been added in mid-October. 
student response negative 
Student opinion on the change has been negative. Guiffrida confirmed that a group of students are considering the University to change the calendar back. He feels, however, that change is "not probable." 
Academic Council or the Administration would have to change their minds and that is not likely," he stated. 
In other action, the Academic removed the ROTC program from the College of Arts and Letters. The department will now come under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Provost. 
Fr. Burtchaell claimed that the move was "for the sake of efficiency." He explained that a very minor percentage of ROTC members were in Arts and Letters, and that ROTC subjects didn't qualify as A&L subjects. "Originally, they were put there for convenience," he noted. 
The College seems to have grown too large for one dean to handle now, Fr. Burtchaell claims. 
The Council also dissolved the Institute for Studies of Education, and moved the Graduate Department of Education into the College of Arts and Letters. 
Fr. Burtchaell said that his move was also one for the sake of efficiency. The programs will now report to the deans of Arts and Letters.

Includes coronation, inaugural ball 


Kersten announces plans 
by Larry Dailey King R. Calhoun Kersten, 
S.B.P. elect, has announced "definitely tentative" plans for the upcoming months after his succession to office on April Fools Day. 
"A coronation has been planned to take place in Sacred lleart Church sometime after the spring break. In addition, we are arranging an Inaugural Ball at LaFortune Student Center and are contacting St. Mary's in search of a chamber orchestra." 
The Prime Mover also an­nounced that, contrary to popular rumors, "no official ap­pointments have been promulgated. We are going to have to declare martial law first," he explained. 
The newly~lected S.B.P. has received national news coverage since his victory last Thursday. NBC television film clips have been aired in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and New York City. f<'ront-page pictures have ap­peared in newspapers of both Hichmond, Va. and Omaha, Neb. 
Kersten confided, however, that his greatest personal feat was the appearance of his high school graduation picture on the front page of the Ft. Dodge J\1rsst>nge·, the King's home · town. "My grandmother is very proud of me," he boasted. 
As usual. the Prime Mover stated that he has been in daily communication with God, but "He's not really helping me very much these days. In fact, I'm seriously beginning to think that Satan was involved in this all the time. and that I was actually misled." 
As of yet, there have been no assasination attempts upon the King's life. "However, I have received several threatening

pointments until martial 
law established. 

messages," he complained. "The cryptically lettered notes bear the messages 'The King is a fink,' and 'Beware of the Ides of March!' " The Prime Mover assured us, though, that all security precautions are being taken to insure his safety. 
BrinkJnann: CAC finances OK 
(continued from page 1) 
Fr. Shilts says he reads them "very fast," for certain points before signing. He said he or the vice president signs all contracts involving the Student Union. Large contracts involving the Athletic and Convocation Center are sent to the facility's managing director before approval is given. 
Brinkmann, however, said Tuesday that some contracts are not signed by the Student Affairs office, but are accompanied by a "cover letter" vouching for the financial feasibility. 
Fr. Shilts, who is an assistant professor of physics, and Brinkmann, an arts and letters major, differ on another point of contract procedure. 
Brinkmann says the usual 50 percent deposit is sent with the contract. The only prior commitment is a verbal one by the booking agency to send a contract for a performer with a specified price and time. If the contract is different, then it is returned, he added. 
Fr. Shilts claims a deposit is sent before a con­tract is signed. It accompanies a similar statement signed by the booking agency. If the contract is different it may be cancelled, and a request is made for the return of the deposit. 

Rejent has been searching for ways to to get the CAC out of several contracts since Christmas, after he found them filled with escape clauses for the performers, but not including an out for the Student Union. 
When asked if the contracts are read, Rejent replied, 'they just read the name, the cost and time evidently." 
The treasurer said the contracts should be signed by someone in the student affairs office since the documents are with the University and not the Student Union. He said he would recommend that his successor arrange this step. 
Reji:mt claimed part of the "fault," stating, "I've seen them going past my desk all the time." Brinkman said Rejent has nothing to do with the signing of contracts, at least with the CAC.

merger mus1ngs 
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIII Jim McDermott 
If Fr. Neil McClusky understands the feelings of the Holy Cross Sisters, they consider the present freshmen the most radical in the schooL If letters received by the Observer are any indication, a good portion of the class is proud of the designation. 
Radical seems the worst term that could be used for the freshman however. Where a radical seeks basic structural change, the freshmen are only demanding what they were promised in their acceptance materials. They were assured that they would be able to receive Notre Dame degrees, since the projected date for completion of the merger would be the 1975 academic year. Now they are told that if they want a degree from Notre Dame, they should immediately apply for a transfer. 
If they do apply, however, they join a crush at the admissions office. Present SMC sophomores have received little if any co-operation from this office. Several women report that they are not even able to schedule an interview. And the announcements of acceptances seem to be taking as long as the fall of an empire. The transfer situation is only a part of the confusion left to students in the after-math of the come-and-go unification of Notre Dame and St. Mary's. The amount of information that students have been given is almost insulting in the questions it leaves unanswered. The separate announcements that Notre Dame and St. Mary's released on the future of the co-exchange program did not clear the issue. 
Will the rules for co-ex electives be changed? Co-ex majors now seem much more difficult, or impossible in many cases. There had been no word yet whether electives will follow that trend or remain as they have for the past two years. In short, the continuing negotiations 
between ND and SMC are not making the student side any  more  
rationaL  Students  are  not  participating,  people  are  not  com­ 
municating.  The  principle disagreements  seem  to  be,  as  ever,  

finances, student life and regulations, and the psychological aspects of changing an institution that has existed for 125 years. 
The finances may never be solved until the two schools are willing to sit down and try to agree. Similarly, student life, especially for women in the University, will be a source of separation until the ad­ministrations finally reach agreement. There is no sign that any such agreement is near. 
The psychological aspect of the merger is perhaps the most difficult. St. Mary's is the residence of many retired members of the Holy Cross Order. They are used to having the college. It is not an intentionally malicious, grasping claw, but it is one grown familiar over years. And it isn't going to let go of the College until it knows what the ultimate situation will be.

Wednesday, March 8, 1972 the observer 
Fr. Robert Griffin 

a letter to someone who cares 

My dear Fr. Griffin, Monday's Observer contained a letter which disturbed me to some extent, in that I cannot answer it adequately myself, and thus, turn to you for assistance. The missive I refer to questioned how one can bear the titles of Christian and gay simultaneously ... That is why I ask that you answer the letter for me, for others questioning how Christianity feels. I know it will be difficult for you, but it would be a great help to many of us ... 
"One who cares" 
My dear Someone: 
You are indeed relying on the strength of a broken reed when you ask me to describe the "official Church stand" on homosexuality, and I would not even at­tempt to answer your letter, if I were not touched by your apparent faith in a priest without credentials as a theologian or as a very heavy thinker. But because you, as well as a number of others. have asked, I feel obliged by responsibility to offer personal comment on the plight of the Christian homosexual. I warn you that these views are not to be confused with Pope Paul's or the teachings of the Council of Trent. If you should hear that I have been consumed with fire from heaven, or that I am being shunned by the Brain Trust of the Paraclete at the Faculty Bar, think gently of me as a false prophet who is biting the dust of fools. 
In regard to official Church teaching, let me make two ooints: (1) it is pretcy _gril'llin its condemnation of homosexual practices. (2) At any given point in history, the official Church attitude is about 25 or 50 or 100 or 500 years behind the viewpoint of

contemporary theologians and Christian intellectuals." and more especially, of the rank and file of the people of God. Even­tually, the Church catches up; but in­stitutions destined to last until the end of time never seem to be in a rush for relevance. 
Apropos of the letter suggesting that the phrase "Christian homosexual" is a contradiction in terms, my initial reaction was to think less well not of homosexuals 
but of the Christianity that fails to un­
derstand that the Redemption of the Lord 
can accomodate itself to all manners and 
conditions of men. I am willing to concede that there is no Christian way in which one can be a child-molester, unless one is willing to baptize the aberrations of a sick psyche. But recent studies seem to be little the fact that for some in­dividuals, homosexuality is neither a sickness nor a neurosis; they seem destined by nature to operate by homo­erotic drives. Thus it would appear to be the mission of the Church to study the evidence in an attempt to relieve, if possible, the dilemma of the gay folk wishing to live out a commitment of Christian love. Even when viewed as part of the mystery of human suffering, it would seem thoughtless of God to equip his sons and daughters with sexual appetites ' entirely natural to them, which they can use only under the penalty of being outlaws to his love and grace. What God has made, God can accept, it seems to me, and so also can the Church. 
It is not illuminating to quote St. Paul in this matter. Ripping Bible verses out of their context and beating them as though they were the war drums of God is a game by which Christians have confused each other for centuries. Paul did not un­derstand homosexuality any more than he understood women, hairy old misogynist that he was. May I suggest, among other contexts, that he was writing to neophyte Christians, often still close to paganism, who lived in an Empire which was sick with its own sexuality; homosexuality was one of the moral illnesses among people who gave themselves up to indiscriminate perversions simply as a way of exploiting the pleasures of the flesh: Nero castrating a young athlete, then marrying him as a wife; Augustus as a sexually impotent old man who entertained himself by deflowering virgins by puncturing their hymens with his fingers. With sketches like these as a background illustrating the decadence of the upper class of the City, t·ead the opening chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, where Paul writes of God's anger with the pagans who have turned to unnatural practices, and you may con-elude that it was not a Gay Alliance group that he was concerned about

a historian's historian 
What does it mean to be a historian? I'm a history major-but am I a historian? What has three years of historical study knowledge transformed me into? Ob­viously, an inconsequential dribblist. No doubt about that. When it comes to flinging trivialities around or the profusion of common dribble, then I am a prolific prodigy. But am I educated? Does anyone really care? Is it not folly to be wise? Perhaps, but yet the struggle within myself continues. The merits of my en­deavors must l>e hidden. Let's have a look. 
The question which immediately pops into the average coconut is: What the heck can one do with a knowledge of the past? !he answer to that question is amazingly JOCk. Allow me to enumerate just a few of the more popular careers standing wide open for the crack dribblist. 
1) Bartending (called · mixology by science majors l -The mechanics of this profession are easily learned by spending a few days behind a bar and watching the pros mix drinks. However, the gutsy stuff like listening to family problems, sports, and politics should only be handled by a deft dribblist. Also, the BeeEssing under fire that a mixologist must go through is no job for an untrained blabber. 
2) Jingle Singing -Well, somebody's got to do it. Besides, the field is wide open. How many jingle singers do you know? 
3) Sewing Name Tags on Bulls -This profession calls for an immediate propensity for propelling the proper tags on the prospect while lying in a prostrate position. This is extremely important if the bull is to maintain his credibility within his peer group. Imagine the snorts and snickers if El Toro walked into the stable wearing Bossy's identification. That would be like Walt Patulski wearing Ben Gay's number. 
4 l Go on welfare -This is the most and the men of science. What is needed most by the gay community of Notre llame --and by those ~;ho try to open to them the possibilities of faith-is a marriage between the Wisdom of ancient insight and the contemporary evidence of research upon which the Spirit of God has breathed.

-The Roman Emperor Commodus, who wrestled as a hobby, was assasinated when his political enemies paid his sparring partner to strangle him. 
-French soldiers on their way to the battle of the Marne in August 1918, were shuttled from Paris in the most unlikely of all military vehicles, the taxicab. 
-George Washington, upon assuming his duties as first president, requested to be addressed as "His Mightiness." 
-The Roman emperor Caligula ap­pointed his horse consul of Rome (Kersten take notel. 
-Hank Aaron, home run king of the

When did Nixon ever bat.300. -Rumour has it that William Howard Taft, President of the United States 1908­1912, once got stuck in the White House bathtub. The 300 pounder was also the first Prexy to toss out the first baseball at a major league game. -The legend that the Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burned is almost certainly false. The fiddle was not in­vented for at least another thousand years. Reports have it, however, that Nero was an excellent bagpiper. Perhaps he played the Victory March during the con­flagration.

McGovern second in New Hampshire 
Muskie takes New Hampshire primary 
by Bill Kovach 
(c) New York Times Manchester, N.H. --Sen. Ed­ward S. Muskie won the New Hampshire Democratic primary 
Tuesday night in the face of a strong challenge by Sen. George 
S. McGovern. 
On the republican side there was no serious disaffection from President Nixon to either Rep. Paul McCloskey on the left or Hep. John M. Ashbrook on the right. 
Heavy voting in the Democratic primary throughout the state saw what began as a fragmented five-candidate field turn into a two-man race between Muskie and McGovern. Muskie's victory was built on a steady, even showing statewide that was just as evenly cut into by McGovern. 
Lagging far behind the leaders in the Democratic Primary were Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana, Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles, Edward T. Coli and written-in candidate Rep. Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas. 
The blue-collar wards of Manchester, the state's largest city, provided the first surprise in the early returns. Muskie, with the support of most regular democrats, had been expected to score heavily in these ethnic wards. Returns from key precincts, however, had Muskie and Mcgovern splitting the vote almost evenly between them. 
It was in these wards in 1968 that a write-in for President Johnson denied Sen. Eugene McCarthy a victory in the New Hampshire primary. 
Muskie swept the coastal city of Portsmouth, where he had been identified as a friend of the large naval shipyard there, and generally showed strength along the eastern edge of the state of Maine. 

Another core of support ap­peared in the North Country town of Berlin, where a three-to-one Muskie vote smothered speculation that organized labor in that industrial town had been split by his opponents. 
As a statewide picture emerged, it was clear that

Since their inception seven neither of the three other can­didates--Hartke, Yorty, or Mi1ls had caught on. There was little evidence to support the widely held theory that the conservative 1\Janchester Union Leader newspaper could deliver 15 per cent of the· vote. Only in some Manchester wards did the paper's candidate, Yorty, come close to such a percentage. 

The national implications of the race were reduced by the fact that several other major Democratic competitors were absent from this primary, in­cluding: Sen. Hubert H. Hum­phrey of Minnesota, Sen. Henry 
M. Jackson of Washington, Mavor John V. Lindsay of New York, Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York, and George C. Wallace of Alabama. 
It was not clear Tuesday night who would win New Hampshire's delegates to the national con­vention. Because of the length of the ballot, only preferential primary votes were counted early and ballots for the 20 Democratic and 14 Hepublican delegates to the national con­ventions will not be completely tallied until Wednesday. 
McClo.skey's showing against the !'resident in the Republican primary did not seem likely to pa'ss the 20 per cent minimum he
