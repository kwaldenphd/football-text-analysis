For sophomore Brenna Doyle, the biggnst problem with gender relations at Notre Dame is not romantie relationships. It's friendships. 
"The strain to make mean­ingful friendships with mem­bers of the opposite sex is the unhealthy aspeet of gender relations on eampus," said Doyle, a member of the Senate Gender Issues Committee. "I feel like it's harder to make friends of the opposite sex

Single-sex dorms 
While single-sex dorms have always been the rule at Notre Dame, they stand out at a time when most universities have men and women Living tognth­er in the majority of dorms. But some students like being differ­ent.

Irish faithful prepare to swarm Big House 
year. Many of the students who rushed the field in Notre Dame Stadium after that game waited in line for a ehanee to buy tiek­ets at the Student Union Board's lottery last Friday, and many of those who didn't snag admission are still making the three-hour road trip for game day. 
"Tiekets are always hard to eome by, especially when Notre Dame is in town," freshman Pat Moore said. "Everybody wants to see them play." 
Moore's family lives near Ann Arbor, so he said he would be "killing two birds with one stone," by visiting home and seeing the Irish "whomp on Miehigan." 
The Big House -already a generally unfriendly environ­ment for Irish fans -will host a massive Miehigan crowd ready to get revengn on Notre Dame, much like two years ago when

INSIDE COLUMN 

Closing the deal 
There he is, perched on the edge of some mystic battlefield fogged over by loud music and black lights, waiting to engage his counterpart in the oldest form ofbattle known to the human race. He is armed only with liquid courage, 
Sam Pandolfo 
shielded by sar­casm and keen wit, and clad in the 
Advertising
armor of paper-thin 
Executive
confidence waiting to charge. 
Then it happens, like Moses himself just parted the sea of Domers, and standing there across the room is his very own Helen of Troy embracing a silver-clad natural bever­{lge. 
This is in no way a fair fight. While we mere men are armed to the teeth with weapons that wouldn't work on a sixth grade bully, 'Helen' is her own dark army. Her weapon is intimidation, her strategy aversion, and her source of strength is a stare capable of stopping him dead in his tracks. The real danger lies in the wing-women she brought with her that are only there to make sure he fails in whatever end he's dumb enough to pursue. 
I consider myself to be an average Notre Dame guy who has no problem making a few friends at a party, but this battle seems to be lost from the begin­ning. Fear not my friends, there are ways to turn the odds in this battle in our favor. 
Step 1: Ask her name, and remember it. Even ifthings go sour and she jets, you'll be able to facebook her the next day and ask her out sometime. The worst thing that can happen is to be holding a glass slipper the next morning with no clue who it belongs to. 
Step 2: Show genuine interest in her. This requires listening skills and patience -practice with friends before­hand ifyou need to. Even ifit's hard to listen to her babble on about how much she loves "The O.C.," swallow hard and pretend it's your favorite show. 
Step 3: Dance with her. I'm not talking about VH1 Enrique Iglesias dancing (although it does work wonders in Zahm) -I want to see some MTV David Banner stuff. 
Step 4: Have your buddies entertain her friends. Be a gentleman and make sure everyone feels welcome, even the weird one with bangs. 
Step 5: Exercise patience. Even Wilt Chamberlain missed his first lay-up. 
I can assure you that following these simple steps will certainly get you a few brownie points and open the door for further exploration. Just remember it's not winning the battle that is important, it's winning the war.

CORRECTIONS 
Due to an editing error, two articles in the Sept. 8 issue ofThe Observer were listed as being written by the wrong reporters. The article "Local coffee shop honors Weis" was actually written by Kathy Lee, and the article "Meal plan includes more Flex Points" was written by Peter Devine. Due to a reponing error, an article in the Sept. 8 issue of The Observer misspelled the last name of CJ's Pub owner Ricky Medich. That article also said the pub was damaged inJanuary 2004, when it was acrually damaged in January 2005. Due to a reporting error, an article in the Sept. 8 issue of The Observer misspelled the last name ofDirector of Notre Dame Food Services Dave Prentkowski and con­tained several factual inaccuracies. This year, 2,000 Flex Points were added, not 20, because a point is worth a penny, not a dollar. The points were added to keep up with consumer inflation, not because ofstudent com­plaints, and the administrative decision involved student input. The Bookstore Cafe began accepting the points last fall, not this fall. The Observer regrets these errors.

Tiger urine gives meat a special "tang" 
SHANGHAI, China -A restaurant in northeastern China that advertised ille­gal tiger meat dishes was found instead to be selling donkey flesh -marinated in tiger urine, a newspaper reported Thursday. 
The Hufulou restaurant, located beside the Heidaohezi tiger reserve near the city of Hailin, had advertised stir-fried tiger meat with chilies for $98as well as liquor flavored with tiger bone for $74 a bottle, the China Daily reported. 
Raw meat was priced at $864 per kilogram. 
The sale of tiger parts is illegal in China and officers shut down the restaurant, only to be told by owner, Ma Shikun, that the meat was actually that of don­keys, flavored with tiger urine to give the dish a "special" tang, the newspa­per said. 
The report didn't say how the urine was obtained. 
Scuba divers begin ten days living underwater 
PONZA, Italy -Two scuba divers spent Thursday underwater off Italy, starting what they hope will be a record 10 days submerged -aided by a special dry chamber where they can change masks and eat. 
Stefano Barbaresi, 37, and Stefania Mensa, 29, completed the first day liv­ing 26 feet under water off the island of Ponza. 
They have nine days to go to reach their goal of 240 hours -doubling the 120 hours set by Jerry Hall of Bluff City, Tenn., in eastern Tennessee's Watauga Lake, according to the Guinness world records.

Cushwa Center celebrates 30 years 
By ANTHONY 
IANNAMORELLI 
News Writer 
In honor of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism's :~Oth anniversary this wnekend, Associate Director Kathleen Sprows Cummings is opening the Centor's doors for a public celebration. 
"You don't need to know nxactly what the Cushwa Center is to attend," Cummings said. 

The main events of the wnekend-long anniversary will (~xamine Leslio Woodeock commemoration are a lecture Tentler's work "An Ameriean Friday at 4 p.m. in the Eck History: Catholics an d Notre .Dame Visitors Center's Contraception," sixth out of 

Auditorium and a seminar Saturday, starting at 9 
a.m. at the MeKenna Hall Center for Continuing Education. 
Friday's lec­ture, entitled "Catholics and the Intellectual Life in Late 20th-Century America,"­

"You don't need to know exactly what the Cushwa Center 
· is to attend." 
Kathleen Sprows Cummings associate director Cushwa Center 
marks the 50th anniversary or an article published in 1955 by Monsignor .John Traey Ellis. The article was a "lament on the abscess of Catholics in intellectual life," a topic that hits very close to home in the Notre Dame community, Cummings said. 
The seminar on Saturday 
seven works in a comprehensive study on the effnet Catholics had on this aspect of American history up until 1968. 
The Center, which received its name from a largo endowment by the Cushwa family six years after its inception, spon­sors about eight events per year 

and publishns a newsletter each semester. Cummings coordinates the events and edits the publication, which documents happenings in thn field or religious history and has morn than 1,800 sub­scribers. 
Cummings said she and Director Tim Matovina arn 
attnmpting to build bridges betwmm the Conter and difl'er.­ont dnpartrnents, as all prior l>ireetors and Associate Dirnetors for the Center wnrn professors from Notrn Dame's history department.

Matovina is an assodatn professor in tho the­ology dnpartment and is active in Latino studies. Tho Center hopos to begin to ineorphrate many intnrnsts into its pur­pose. 
The two selwduled talks are prime examplos or what the Center is about, Cummings said.

Many students also said that parietals are a way for the University to make sure that stu­dents do not engage in sexual intercourse, which is a violation of school policy. 
According to DuLac, sex "requires a commitment to a total living and sharing together of two persons in marriage," Any stu­dent found in violation of this poli­cy is subject to disciplinary sus­pension or permanent dismissal. 
Some students think the idea that parietals prevent students from having sex negatively affects relations between genders. 
"In order to create a healthy environment here, this idea that parietals are about sex really needs to go," Rauh said. "It can add a sexual connotation to pla­tonic male-female friendships, at least those behind dosed doors after midnight. To foster a better atmosphere for gender relations, the Notre Dame community needs to, if you will, make it more natu­ral. Relationships are natural when they happen when people choose, not just between the hours of9 a.m. and midnight" 
The· University's policy actually has the opposite effect on some students, freshman Ashleigh Cross said. 
"It almost creates more of an emphasis on wanting to be in the other sex's dorms and rooms," Cross said. "And [it also creates an emphasis] on wanting to break parietals more because they exist." 
Parietals have been an issue of I)'luch debate in recent years. On April 30, 2001, nearly 300 stu­dents camped out on South Quad in. protest of the administrations opposition to extending late-night visiting hours. Though the Campus Life Council had just approved a resolution allowing visitors to be in dorms at 9 a.m., rather than 10 a.m., students were unsatisfied because the group defeated a proposal to extend parietals on weekdays. 
Uving off-campus 

Many students choose to live off-campus during their senior year, though some make the move earlier. This trend, students said, has fostered a healthier environ­ment for male-female relations. 
"Moving off campus tends to signify reaching a certain point in a career at Notre Dame," Senate Gender Issues Committee chair Ali Wishon said. "Healthier gen­der relations are one of many advantages of moving off. Moving off-campus allows for much more independence and freedom." 
Part of that freedom, Wishon said, means no longer having to "fear parietals." 
"It is much easier to relax and spend time at the apartment or house of members of the opposite sex, without constantly having to be aware of the dock," she said. 
However, parietals are not the only rule students leave behind when living oiT-eampus. 
"I think people move off-cam­pus to escape the rules in general, not just parietals. By the time people are seniors, the relation­ships that you have with the opposite sex seem to be set in stone," said Bullock, who lives at the Clover Ridge apartment com­plex. "Being off-campus doesn't change that. It just means that there's not a rector or an RA peering over your shoulder." 
Other students, however, said moving off-campus is just a better way to prepare for life away from the Dome, and not meant as an escape from the rules of the University. 
"I would say that the decision to move off campus is more a deci­sion to become more independent in preparation for life after gradu­ation than anything to do with relationships," Shappell said. 
And moving off-campus does not guarantee healthier gender relations, Burkavage said. 
"I think even off-campus people are as segregated as they are on campus -as far as living with people of the same sex," Burkavage said. "Obviously I think some people live eo-ed, but all my friends who are off-campus live with people of the same sex." 

Changing relationships 

"[Gender relations at Notre Dame are] more healthy than at bigger state Universities," junior James Ramos said. "I think ran­dom hook-ups here are less prevalent." 
Ramos, who said two of his closest friends at Notre Dame are female, said relationships do seem to change over time. 
"Guys are more accepting of being friends when you get older," as opposed to earlier in college where "it's more about hooking up," Ramos said. 
Sophomore Ashley Modak agreed with Ramos' theory of relationship evolution, with seri­ous relationships becoming more and more common as a student gets older. 
"I think the major change from freshman to senior year is the level of maturity," said Shappell, a former worker at the Gender Relations Center. "Students become more serious about rela­tionships." · 
But many students disagreed with Ramos about the healthiness of Notre Dame relationships. 
Shappell noted that while mod­erate relationships do occur, ran­dom hook-ups and intense rela­tionships -including the "ring­by-spring" phenomenon that marries off students by senior year -represent the vast majori­ty of interactions on campus. 
"Random hook-ups are very eommon when students are par­tying," she said. "Serious relation­ships are also seen across earn­pus. Anything in between, howev­er, is rare." 
Junior Matt Houser was even more emphatic in saying there was no middle ground with Notre Dame relationships, especially since he thinks the environment pressures males to start romantic relationships. 
"I think that the relationships here are seriously messed up," Houser said. "First of all, there js no dating. Two people hook up when they are drunk a few times and then all of a sudden they are together." 
Cross said random hook-ups have little to do with Notre Dame and a lot to do with college cul­ture. 
"That's an everywhere thing," she said. "It has to do with alcohol and people trying to find them­selves during their first and sec­ond years." 
Regardless of where the heart of the gender relations issue lies, Doyle said the transitions from year to year help students become more at ease in their environment. 
"Students become more aware of and comfortable with the gen­der relations at Notre Dame as they progress from freshman to senior year," she said. 
There's no easy solution to the problem, Shappell said, but there are ways to improve the situation. 
"I think it is difficult to pinpoint what exactly is missing from gen­der relations at NO," Shappell said. "However, I think that they could be improved with increased dialogue about gender relations issues and another look at the parietals system."

Gender

don't have to worry about," said Walsh senator and sophomore Erin Hankins. "Because of single­sex dorms, students get a chance to form very strong, healthy rela­tionships with others of the same sex." 
"It limits the number of people of the opposite sex who you are going to come in contact with and meet," freshman Nick Kovachevich said. "But it also makes you a lot closer with your guy friends and brothers." 
Some students, however, said this limitation made finding frier;ds of the opposite sex and forming healthy friendships sig­n'ificantly more difficult, especially when considering the background of 
the opposite sex dur­ing those four years," O'Neill sena­tor and sophomore Steve Tortorello said. "Because of this, many students aren't used to forming genuine friendships with the opposite sex -that is, rela­tionships that are based on some­thing more than just flirting." 
Sophomore Dan Justice sees a more dramatic result of single-sex dorms. 
"It makes [the campus] into two zones with guys' dorms as party dorms," he said. "No one bothers to go to girls' dorms. It makes for zones where you can get away with stuff and where you can't." 
Though many upperclassmen said they have enjoyed their over­all experience at Notre Dame, some students expressed feelings that more friendships could have been formed with members of the opposite sex had the dorms not been single-sex. 
"I am glad to have the friend­ships that I have with guys here, but I think that things could have been better," senior Elizabeth Bullock said. "So I would say that I am content with my friends, but not content with the opportunities I had to make more or closer friends." 
Bullock said her main problem was that "Notre Dame doesn't treat its students like adults" and does not give co-ed housing as an option. 
"I think that co-ed dorms would be a good step," Bullock said. "Even if they didn't want to make all of the dorms co-ed, at least give students an opportunity to make that decision for them­selves. But rather than trusting the students to make good choic­es, they decide that we'll live with members of the same sex and that seeing the opposite sex after midnight is inappropriate." 
While single-sex dorms are the cause of much controversy, some students believe they contribute to Notre Dame's uniqueness and are not worth changing. 
"I don't think it would be worth sacrificing the dorm unity and atmosphere that we have now to move guys and girls into the same dorm to help the relationship thing," senior Andy Burkavage said. "I think that the University has a lot more to lose from getting rid of the current situation than they have to gain from the inte­gration of co-ed dorms." 

Parietals ups and downs 
It's not just the single-sex dorms creating controversy. Parietals are a constant source of debate that divides students and admin­istrators. 

The University rule limiting late-night visiting hours was insti­tuted "to foster the personal and social development of residence hall students and at the same time respond to the safety, securi­ty and privacy needs of students sharing common living space," according to DuLac, Notre Dame's official guidebook to student life. 
Undergraduate residence halls set their opposite-sex visitation hours as specified by DuLac: visit­ing hours are not to begin before 9 a.m. on any day and are not to extend past 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights and midnight on other nights. Graduate student housing allows for 24-hour visita­tion. 
"The University's values are to develop well-founded adults," said student body vice president Lizzi Shappell, who defended the 
parietals policy.

roman tie. "I think that 
parietals have a big effect on gender relation's," Bullock said. "It doesn't prevent the 'hook-up' from happening between guys and girls, but it stops the normal behavior like watching a movie late at night or staying up to talk." 
Pangborn senator and sopho­more Lisa Rauh agreed with Bullock, saying parietals seriously impeded budding male-female friendships. 
"At most universities, even if there are single-sex dorms, peo­ple have the opportunity to get to build these important platonic relationships with the opposite sex because there is no time limit on how long a conversation can last or two people can hang out," Rauh said. "It is difficult to be in the midst of a great conversation or discussion, and suddenly it is midnight and that person, because they happen to be of the opposite sex, has to leave." 
While outlets like Reekers or 24-hour spaces are provided for students to continue such conver­sations, many students find it dif­ficult to foster such friendships in loud, public places. 
Shappell said parietals "seem to hyperactivate any social time between the sexes, especially on the weekends at dorm parties."

ten to your customers," Auletta said, playing the part of corporate owner. "Isn't a good business supposed to understand its customers?" 
The problem arises, Auletta said, when journalists focus­ing on their "craft" clash with the businHss approach to their profession. 
"Journalists prize independ­ence, not teamwork," Auletta said. "Journalists understand waste is inherent to good journalism that good reporting and writing is hard to quantify." 
Although as a journalist Auletta understands the anti­corporate sentiment, he made several concessions. 
"It's wrong to portray our bosses in a cartoon fashion as greedy capitalists uncon­cerned with anything besides maximum profits," he said. "Most journalistic enterprises need to make a profit Iand provide a range of news). But too often this journalistic supermarkets have become specialty stores." 
After citing five major "vices" in today's journalism -synergy, infatuation with brand, lack of humility, hubris and bias -Auletta gave an eight-step solution to the pro­gressively widening rift. 
"First, give journalists more time and space," he said. "Too often journalists are like fire­fighters -we are reacting, not thinking. Journalism is about sifting information, finding different courses ... It's not just a bird's eye view." 
Secondly, Auletta said read­ers needed access to essential hard news stories, for the public good. 
"Journalists and the people who sign our checks have to be willing to risk boring our audience" with more govern­ment and international news, he said. "It's not easy." 
Although he listed bias as a journalist's vice, Auletta said objectivity was impossible. 
"But fairness is possible. Balance is possible," he said. "We can be skeptical without being cynical." 
Auletta stressed the impor­tance of diversity in the news­room and better communica­tion between journalists and businessmen and women. He denounced the idea of a parti­san press, saying it would only create further polariza­tion in American society. 
His last piece of advice? "Be prepared to be fired," Auletta said.

FDA panel votes for 
Brain possibly still evolving

Findings show humans could be genetically changing, scientists say
nevv insulin approval 
Associated Press 

Inhalable drug to be an alternative to injections 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Federal health advise.rs on Thursday recommended government approval of the first inhaled form of insulin, offering some diabetics an alternative to many of their daily injections. 
The recommendation by a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel came despite questions about use of the drug in people who have lung disease or were exposed to secondhand smoke. 
No specific restrictions were recommended for Exubera, but FDA officials said smokers prob­ably would not be able to use the drug. Their blood sugar could fall dangerously low with Exubera because they absorb· much more inhaled insulin in their lungs than do nonsmokers. 
Some advisers also were con­cerned that patients might not use the device properly. Drug company representatives sug­gested that the inhaler was not any more complicated than the injections many diabetics now must rely on. 
Panel members twice voted 7­2 to recommend FDA approval of Exubera for each of the two most common types of diabetes. The drug is being produced by Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis and Nektar Therapeutics. 
The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory committees, but is not required to. 
The advisers questioned the drug companies about the long­term effects of distributing insulin to the body through the lungs, rather than directly into the blood stream. 
Rebecca Wilkes Killion, a patient representative member of the committee, said inhaled two genes, named microcephalin and ASPM, that are connected to brain size. If those genes don't work, babies are born with severely small brains, called microcephaly. 
Using DNA samples from eth­nically diverse populations, they identified a collection of varia­tions in each gene that occurred with Unusually high frequency. In fact, the variations were so com­mon they couldn't be accidental mutations but instead were probably due to natural selec­tion, where genetic changes that are favorable to a species quick-
Years later, a 
ruler declares one of those copies the definitive manuscript, and. a rush is on to make many copies of that ver­when art, music and tool-making were emerging, Lahn said. For ASPM, the variation arose about 5,800 years ago, roughly corre­lating with the development of written language, spread of agri­culture and development of cities, he said. 
"The genetic evolution of humans in the very recent past might in some ways be linked to the cultural evolution," he said. 
Other scientists urge great caution in interpreting the research. 
That the genetic changes have anything to do with brain size or intelligence "is totally unproven and potentially dangerous terri­tory to get into with such sketchy data," stressed Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research 
-Institute. Aside from not knowing what the gene variants actually do, no one knows how precise the model Lahn used to date them is, CollinS added. Lahn 's own calculations acknowledge that the micro­cephalin variant could have aris­en anywhere from 14,000 to 60,000 years ago, and that the uncertainty about the ASPM variant ranged from 500 to 14,000 years ago. Those criticisms are particu­

insulin could convince reluctant diabetics that they should take their medicine. 
"I take four shots a day and the fourth one is hardest one," Killion said. ''I'm tired of it. If I could get myself down to one I'd be thrilled. A lot of people resist it because they are afraid of the needles." 
The companies, which are promoting Exubera as an easi­er-to-take alternative, proposed to conduct studies on the long­
ASHINGTON -The human brain may still be evolving. 
So suggests new research that tracked changes in two genes thought to help regulate brain growth, changes that appeared well after the rise of modern humans 200,000 years ago. 
That the defining feature of humans -our large brains ­continued to evolve as recently as 5,800 years ago, and may be doing so today, promises to sur­prise the average person, if not biologists.

It is estimated that more than 18 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, although some do not know it. The number of people with diabetes is believed to have tripled in the past quar­ter-century. 
Most have Type 2, a condition linked to obesity that occurs when the body cannot effective­ly use the insulin it makes. Sometimes this can be treated with pills instead of injections. 
Fewer than 10 percent have Type 1, a disorder in which the immune system attacks insulin­producing cells in the pancreas. This is sometimes called juve­nile diabetes. 
An FDA medical officer ques­tioned whether inhaled insulin could provide a precise enough dose to treat people with Type 1 diabetes. 
agreed Greg Wray, director of Duke University's Center for Evolutionary Genomics. "A dif­ferent way to look at is it's almost impossible for evolution not to happen." 
Still, the findings also are con­troversial, because it's far from clear what effect the genetic changes had or if they arose when Lahn's "molecular clock" suggests -at roughly the same time period as some cultural achievements, including written language· and the development of cities.

Katrina has spurred other blacks to take crucial roles in relief ell'orts -and they're in a better position to help than they were even a decade ago, when rap still scared people and being paid $30 million per year to play basketball was beyond imagina­tion. 
Now billionaire Mississippi native Oprah Winfrey is bringing her top-rated show to the Katrina zone, famed attorney Willie Gary is planning to transport victims in his 737 jet, and rapper Kanye West can excoriate President Bush's response to the hurricane in front of a nationwide audience. 
Tavis Smiley has devoted much or his television talk show to Katrina. 
''I've seen black folk come together around any number of issues. It's usually either a head or a heart issue," he said. "For example, we came together after the election of 2000, when Bush essentially stole the election. That was a head issue. Pnopln wnre mad. Other issues hit our hearts; 
O.J. Simpson comes to mind." 
With Katrina, "our head is say­ing we know that what happennd here is wrong ... and our hearts at the same time go out to these peo­ple because we know, we l'ePI their pain." 
Many want to share it. 
Hip-hop hitmaker Timbaland said that he is renting trueks, buy­ing dothes and toys and hPading "to the trenches" -first stop, the Houston Astrodome. He chal­lenged peers who splurge on jew­elry and ears to do the same, because "these people in the dome listen to our music." 
"Don't give to no Red Cross, that's the easy way. Not to say anything bad about the Red Cross, but who knows where that money's going," the producer said. "Take your money and do your own thing." 
Timbaland estimated he was spending several hundred thou­sand dollars, up there with Diddy and .lay-Z's half-million each. Tlw donation of' time, monoy and frnn performances by hip-hopp!'rs is a watorshed f(w what had bncomo a largely apolitical genre. 
"This is the most devastating thing to their community they've seen in their lil'etinw," said tho original hip-hop mogul, Bussell Simmons. ''I've never seen a big­ger outpouring of' love and giving. I've never seen anything liko it." 
There is another mason Katrina resonatos. Most blacks havo fami­ly from "down South," a sort of' symbolic womb from whieh black America slowly wont iL'i separate ways. 
"We are a population in this country of blaek people, but do we feel like a community'?" said ayo, the author. "What really makes a community?" 
Shared expnriences, perhaps? 
"I think this is on11," ayo said. Katrina "is at the enntral eorn of black eulturn and American eul­ture ... I hope this is a turning point of some kind, a turning point for creating a largnr com­munity."

A tale of two Notre Dam_e graduates 
Despite my personal political leanings, my friends come from opposite ends of the political spectrum and include Democrats, Republicans, Independents and Libertarians. It just so happens that two of my closest Notre Dame alumni friends have been quite active since Hurricane Katrinia devastated the Gulf coast area. One is a Republican former special opera­tions military veteran from Atlanta, the other a peace activist and liberal Democrat from Kansas. 
These two Notre Dame graduates could not be more unlike each other except for a common undergraduate alma matter. My Atlanta friend brags of his covert past and at times still bullies his way through business dealings with veiled threats and an air of intimidation. My Kansas friend is a writer who can unceasingly spout off one joke after another and compares his anti Vietnam protest days with his current peace movement activities. Each has carved out a homestead on opposing mountaintops, yet each has put life on hold to assist homeless evacuees. 
My Atlanta friend owns interests in sev­eral business ventures with many employ­ees and has holdings of vast warehouses containing large equipment such as cranes, generators, air conditioners, portable lighting fixtures and a fleet of vehicles. Following Katrinia's devastation, he quickly secured special transportation permits, including state police escorts, and led one of many convoys to the disas-

ter area. He is equipped with satellite telephones and has set up his base of operations in Alabama. 
Upon his arrival during his initial visit to the stricken area, he donated a generator and air conditioner to a hospital where trapped patients were sweltering in oppressive beat. On his second visit he was disappointed to learn that while the air conditioner was operational, the hos-pita! wing's temperature was registering at only 82 degrees. A nurse comforted him by saying, "It was a humid 102 degrees, and each day it gets slightly cool­er. This is a big relief. Thank you." 
His other priority is to rescue a priest in Louisiana who was trapped with others in his church. My Atlanta friend did not say how he contacted the priest, but noted that the group was isolated and feared for their safety. The former commando explained that prior to his departure from Georgia, he bought several guns and ammunition to fortifY the church if neces­sary. Jokingly he quipped that he now qualified as a one-man militia. 
Half a continent away, my Kansas class­mate took a different approach to the res­cue efforts. Unlike the Atlanta alumnus who dove head frrst into the disaster area, the Kansas alumnus and a prominent local attorney organized their own mini­eflort to assist evacuees who were headed for Oklahoma. They attained a truckload of bottled water through their local soft drink bottling plant owner and then organized a new goods contribution cam­paign from local businesses. They too led a convoy south. 
My Kansas friends sidestepped both the Red Cross and emergency management agencies during their project. They rea­soned that it was better to have a moving 
van full of goods sitting next to a shelter 
staging area for possible use. ra,thel,' th<m 
'· to have a' shortage of goods. To tiieii · ' · · amazement, others had had the same bold strategy, and each truckload nicely complemented the overall effort to assist evacuees. The relief shelters took on an atmos­ph ere of shock, despair and hope. My friend described the dramatic effect the experience had on him as "conflicted." On one side of the room someone was franti­cally trying to find a family member while on the other side another rejoiced at news that a relative had been found alive. The beaten, weary brows of adults contrasted to the energetic, bright eyes of their chil­dren. The dazed sorrow of some clashed with the euphoric joy of others. . . Interestingly, both of my Notre Dame friends mentioned to me similar conver­sations with those affected by the hurri­cane's devastation, that a common social thread ran through their experiences. At some point during their interactions with others, the fact became clear that they had graduated from Notre Dame. Both reported that several Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana State University football fans then pledged to cheer for Notre Dame. Both graduates, in their own way, replied, "It's just something Notre Dame does."

Calling the U.S. to take genocide seriously 
One year ago today, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell dedarnd the atrocities in Darfur tantamount to genocide. It was a histork deelaration that gave many around the world hop~ that the United States would not stand on the sidelines once again as genocide ensued. Yet, one year has passed and that hope has subsided with lack of action by the U.S. governmnnt and international com­Peter munity. Thnrn is still time, though, for the Quaranta and United States to rnnnergize that hope and  Patrick ad to sav~ lives. Corrigan 
The atrocities in Darfur rage on as more than two million pnople are displaced and Guest anothnr two million require humanitarian Columnists assistanee. Sincn 2003, it is estimated that bdween HO,OOO and 400,000 people have been killed. In the same time, tens of thousands of women have been brutally rapnd and villages have been dmnolished in a systematic cam­paign eondueted by government and militia forces. 
The Unitml Statns has much to contribute in bringing an end to the horror in Darfur. First, the government can provide incrnas~d logistieal, financial and diplomatic support to the t\frkan Union mission in Darfur to protect civilians. In addi­tion, high-levnl nngagnnwnt and linandal support will pro­mote and nnnrgizn the Darfur peace negotiations. Finally, the rngion rnquires a eontinued and increased commitment to dnaling with tlw humanitarian erisis created by the atrocities. Thn current administration has shown that none of these steps will bn implemented without sustained pressure by concerned citizens. 
The tragic disaster in the Gulf Coast demands our immediate and urgent atteption; however, that attention need not negate eontinued foeus and engagement to the human disaster that continues to kill in Sudan. These attacks on human life­whetlwr caused by humans or nature, whether in our back­yards or an ocnan away-call us to aflirm the sanctity of life and act to defend it. This is a calling that we cannot ignore any longer. 
Today, we are joining the voices of thousands of Arnerieans asking the Bush Administration to make human life in Darfur a priority. We urge you to join in by calling your reprel?enta­tivns and especially the White House today at 202-456'-1414. Together, let's eall the U.S. to take genocide seriously and act aeeordingly.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Argument hypocritical 
This country, though rooted in Judeo-Christian morality, is secular. Though recent rulings of the Supreme Court may imply otherwise, speeifie reli­gious beliefs and Arneriean law should not be inter­twined. 
With this in mind, I'd like to ask Gregory Pio ("Liberal, examine thyselr' Sept. 7) to step down from his soapbox and ask him why it makes the least bit of dilferenee whether or not Mario Cuomo's, John Kerry's, or John Roberts' political ideals come from beliefs of religion, natural law or the U.S. Constitution. They have their ideals. That is enough. 
Sinee Pio is so opposed to rape (as well he should bel what happens to his stanee on abortion when rape come into the picture'? If the 14-year-old New Orleans rnfugee who was raped in the Superdome last week bneame pregnant, should she be morally or legally obligated to carry the ehild to term and givn birth to it? 
I am always repulsed at the audacity of those who think that the government has the power to tell women (and girls) what they are allowed to do with their bodies based on a religious belief. Should this 14-year-old girl who has lost her home, all her pos­sessions and h~ sense of seeurity, only to be violated in the most intimate way, be forced to carry a con­stant reminder of the trauma for nine months? How ean she, or her family, support such a child'? 
If your solution is adoption, what of her life in school for the next year'? What of the dangers to her health that any fully grown adult woman nnnd be conscious or? Oh, you say, there ean be an "nxeep­tional circumstances" exemption in your ideal anti­abortion law'? Who will dncide what qualilies m; an exemption'? llow etm any one person or even legisla­tive body makn that decision for someone else's lifi~'? 
Pio is also eager to point out th~ hypoerisy of liber­als' aceeptanee of abortion in the facn of their per­sonal rnligious eonvictions, but he has to look no fur­ther than his own argument to find another nxample of that hypocrisy. lie himsnlf states: "I opposed abor­tion before I was Catholic", asserting that his posi­tion on abortion is independent of his Catholic faith. !fit is so easy for Pin to separate the two in his per­sonal bdief system, why does he assume that Catholie liberals are too "morally crippled" to do the same'? 
Pio has asked me to examine mysnlf. I have done so, and am completely satisfied with what I see. Now I have a rnquest of him: spray some Wind ex on your glass walls before you throw your next stone.

Don't blame the Legion 

Don't blame the Legion for the word "sueks" 
I must really be bored here in Alabama, where I am working for the ACE program, because I'm actually taking the time to respond to what some­one said about the Leprechaun Legion. However, I was looking through The Observer Web site today, to remember how much fun college was, when I ran across some comments from Kelly Jordan, a Faculty Senate Committee Member. 
Jordan said he didn't like the vulgarity of the Legion, especially when the section says the dreaded "S" word during opposing player intro­ductions. When a player is announced for the opposing team, students have yelled "Sucks" loudly. I was never one of those people, although I still don't get how students are allowed to yell "Kill" during football cheers, but can't say "sucks" at any time. Ever. 
Either way, I spent a lot of time helping 1to cre­ate and sustain the Legion, so I figured I'd help Jordan understand some of the facts about the Lngion. First, the "Sucks" cheer was here years bnfore the Legion arrived. We started the Legion during the middle of the 2002 season and stu­dents were already yelling "sucks." So, please don't blame the Legion for conceiving this jeer. 
Second, we aetually have worked with sports promotions to have students refrain from yelling the word. We have brought newspapers to most games in hopes that students wouldn't yell that word. However, it's hard to eontrol 3,000 stu­dents. Despite the diflicult odds, we felt at the end of last season, many students were beginning to stop chanting the "S" word. 
Third, if you didn '.t know, Mr. Jordan, the Legion donated almost $3,000 to Coaches vs. Cancer last season, thanks to our public shirt sales which reached more than 2,HOO shirts. This season, the new president expeets to sell more shirts and therefore give more money to charity. We also kept zero dollars from our sales. 
So I ean understand that you don't want your child to hear the word "sucks." At the same time, it's not fair of you to aeeuse the Legion of starting or trying to continue such behavior. Frankly, it's not our fault. Instead of being a hazard at Notre Dame basketball games, the Legion has raisnd money for charity whiln helping to give the Irish a home court advantage. So plnase understand the facts before you bash somnone or something else.

Ad trivializes faith 
I never thought I would see a clip such as the one shown during the Notre Dame vs. Pittsburg game last weekend. The eommercial, which the Office of News and Information and Matt Storin believe to show the University as a "serious place for learning and faith," is an insult to anyone who has ever put their faith in prayer. It is an outrage to think that the University would allow such a clip. 
It trivializes the faith and its most important con­duit to God, prayer. To let Hudy pray at the grotto for admission is one thing-that's Hollywood. Twelve thousand students apply to get into here and I guarantee most of them spent a lot of time praying for admittance. Does God not hear the prayers of the 8,000 who didn't get in, or could it be that those who got in made it with credentials of academic excellence and a dedication to their com­munity through service and activity. Of all the peo­ple that helped make this film I wonder if anyone asked the theology department what they thought. As a theology major, we laugh in class at the thought of people praying at the Grotto for an Irish victory or that one might do well on a test. 
This video sends an awful message to people like my brother who did not get in. "You should have prayed harder and maybe God would have lis­tened. You should have gone to your ehureh and prayed during every season of thn year." This video does not speak of a "Higher Education" it speaks of a false sense that prayer will get you anything and that admittance to Notre Dame is dependent on your devotion to God. 
I'm sorry that I did not pray enough for my brother down at the Grotto. I will make a note of that for the next four siblings that I have that look for admittance here, and J will tell them to drop their books and pray. If this video is airnd during the Michigan game you will be insulting the faith of many and trivializing the meaning of prayer.

DPAC REVIEW 

'Crash' is a course in stunning cinema 
By BRIAN DOXTADER and MOLLY 
GRIFFIN 
Assistant Scene Editors 

Brian: Every once in a while there is a film destined to be a sleeper classic, like "Memento" or "The Usual Suspects." These films often come from talented directors who have made an impression and are on the verge of fulfilling their potential. Paul Haggis, who wrote last year's Best Picture Oscar winner "Million Dollar Baby," is such a director. 
In "Crash." his directorial debut, he has made a film that is not only an incisive portrait of racial tensions, but the best American film of the year so far. 
Haggis has proven himself a great screenwriter, but the directorial panache on display in "Crash" is still a little star­tling. He juggles intertwining storylines and balances a talented ensemble cast perfectly, almost out-mastering the mas­ter, Robert Altman. Like that director's 1993 film "Short Cuts." "Crash" follows the seemingly unrelated but ultimately intersecting lives of various Los Angeles residents. The differences in the attitudes and backgrounds of the characters are immediately evident, ranging from poor black ghetto residents to a rich white dis­trict attorney. Race, gender and economic disparity all play major roles as the char­acters develop over the course of the film. 
There are some dazzlingly effective moments in "Crash," particularly a mid­film car crash and the scene that appears on the movie poster. Haggis' pacing and control is excellent, especially for a first­time director. Additionally, his sense of drama (in some cases, melodrama) and character interaction is pointedly ,effec­tive. The film's sense of build-up and pay­off is unparalleled in its logic and execu­tion, and each situation resolves itself in ways that are often unexpected, but somehow perfectly right. 
Additionally, Haggis' ear for dialogue is perfect. All of the characters have distinct voices and personalities, and none are played for type, not even the fast-talking African-American carjacker (rapper Luducris, who is surprisingly talented) nor the corrupt, racist police officer (Matt Dillon, in the best performance of his career). Each of them have reasons for acting the way they do, and while those reasons may not be entirely justified, nei­ther can they be simply dismissed. 
"Crash" is alive in ways that few movies can be. Though the subject matter and its presentation is often quite harsh, it's not as darkly depressing as "Million Dollar Baby," which is actually one its strongest facets. Most of the characters arrive at an epiphany of some sort before the film's conclusion, and the film ends on a hope­ful note. "Crash" is not as directly didactic as might be expected, but Haggis' mes­sage is clear: If these characters, with all their hate and prejudice, can learn to simplistic, two-sided debates, but change, why can't we? "Crash" refuses to give into stereotypes 

or expected endings.

Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) goes Racial issues can easily be made into on a tirade after her car is stolen by two black men, but she focuses her rage on the Hispanic locksmith who she hires to protect her. An Arabic immigrant, Farhad (Shaun Toub) becomes so dis­traught after his insurance won't cover a robbery, he attempts to kill an innocent worker he blames for the event. 
Another interesting element is how Americans' attempts to be politically correct and conceal feelings can lead to greater tension and problems. The sensi­tive and politically correct Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillipe) requests a new partner after Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillion) harasses an African-American woman after stopping her for speeding. When it comes down to a final life-or-death choice involving people of other races, though, Sgt. Hyan redeems himself and Officer Hanson commits a horrific act. 
The i~portance of actions over words is a huge part of the film, and it com­ments on the fact that while words are hurtful, the final actions that we take ·under pressure reveal our true charac­ters. Anthony (Chris "Ludacris" Bridges) constantly discusses how young African­American men are stereotyped by Caucasian society while simultaneously fulfilling such societal prejudices. l-Ie feels entitled and blames society for his own actions, but ultimately finds con­tentment after realizing that some peo­ple in society even have it worse than he does. 
The differences betwoon people in "Crash" ultimately boil down not only to racial differences but to the same basic human emotions of fear, resentment and loneliness. Haec is just a medium through which people express their frus­tration in their lives, and the film reveals that humans have much more in com­mon with one another than the tensions within society would reveal. Class and attempting to fulfill certain societal expectations are more to blame than race alone. 
"Crash" is not a movie to go see to escape reality for a few hours. If any­thing, the film creates a greater sense of awareness. As the actors and actresses peform masterfully, the movie truly seems to open our eyes not only to the racial tensions that lie at the heart of our American society, but also reveals a great deal about the difficulties of com­munication and personal interaction in American society. The film can be diffi­cult to watch because parts of it are almost too real and show distinctly unpleasant sides of our own humanity. It is a film, however, that is immensely entertaining, interesting and that will be discussed long after the credits have rolled.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 
Bahnan Begins can't quite soar 

1\y JOSH TALLEY 
Scrnr Writrr 
Many eonsider the original Batman film. direetml by Tim Burton. a eontem­porary ~~lassie, hut it may soon be sur­passed by llw Dark Knight's current inr.arnation in Chris Nolan's "Batman Begins." 
But twtm though Batman Begins is, in this r:nviewpr's humble opinion. an excnllnnt film. this Batman gan'w nneds some major improvemnnts. Whiln this ganw is I00 pPrcent Batman, it fails to transcend the norms of action games and fails to be all it t:an be as both a supnrlwro and a Batman ganw. 
This game dons follow the film fairly faithfully. It n1wnr takes hugn libnrties with tlw 1wnnts in thn movie. But, it has lwen tweaked slightly to makn it more acreptahl1~ as a video game. Like the movie, the game follows Batman's can scare tho others badly 1mough that they conw elosn to passing out from fear. This addition to the game is an enjoy­able one. but it eould have been done dill'erently. The game is extremely linear, usually only oiTering one way in which to seare your oppononts. 
While there arn no major 11aws, there is also nothing spoctacular about the game. It does get a little tiring to see the same I 0 generic thugs over and over again. The in-game movins usn the same quality or rendering as game-play, but l'ilm footage is incorporated into the game fairly well. The audio work is well above average. The ambient noises in tlw game make it believable that are actually in the game and are creeping through a st1mm lillnd subterranean cor­ridor. Also, the voice acting is superb, with all the principal actors voicing their eharat:ters (save the glaring omission of Gary Oldman). The sound cfl'eets quality of the game is also well done, providing 
first attnmpts at Batman Begins that little extra to lwing thn Caped makn the gamn feel Crusadnr. It starts ·' more complete. out in Arkham or course, since Asylum, but then this game is based

and then continues on to the finale. This change in setting and back story crnatns a littln dnpth for the charaeter and providns pnopln who haven't seen this movie a chancn to undnrstand what is going on. During game-play you are a1~companiml with Bruen Wayne's eon!i­dant and frinnd Alfred. Alfrnd oll'ers you advke and tells you of the goals to come in the lnvel. Thnrn arn two kinds of mis­sions in the game, the first in which you play as Batman searching for r.lues to forward the plot and fighting oil' various villains, and the sm:ond in which you drivn tho Batmobile around Gotham City d1asing had guys and escaping from the policn. Tlw game's I 0 to 15 hours of garnn play arnn't amazing, but arn the lwst of any other in thn Batman serins. 
Wlwn you play as Batman, one of the major points of the game is striking fear into the hnarts of your 1m1~mies in order to makn thnm llustered and confusnd. Tlw ganw takes a rnalistic approach to Batman this time in thn fact that you t:an't rush through the game like Hambo. Onn guy with a gun is more than sum­dent to ruin nven the Dark Knight's day. You havn to use the gamn's onvironrnont to scaro your prey to frighten them out of using tlwir woapons. Also, by taking out the strongest opponents (i.e. the ones with weapons or giving orders) you isn't a huge problem 
though, because the stnalth style of the game is better situat­ed for a single player. The controls to the game are simplistic at best. While com­bat is a large part of the game, the play­er essentially has an attaek button and a dodge button at his disposal. Also, Batman's gadgets are simplified in the game as woll because you ean only use them when you arc near an enemy and in eombat or when your opponnent is already seared. You can't just use them like you think Batman really would, but have to follow the poorly designed item engine in the game. 
There aren't too many speeial features in the game. Once tho game is complet­ed, you have unlocknd alternate Batman costumes from past incarnations of the Caped Crusader. While interesting, it does nothing to change the gameplay. Also, you can unlock both of the Batmobile levels so that you can play them as a stand alone mission or as a time attack. While fun the first few times, it gets old rather quickly. 
This game is the best Batman game to date, and the best supnrhero game of tho year so far. This game does not com­pare to the superhero game "Spider­man 2," hut it is still worth a rent.

MLB -AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Indians move into wild card lead with victory 
Angels' Byrd shuts down Red Sox in 3-0 win; Yankees fall 7-4 to Devil Rays, trail Boston by 4 games in AL East 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -As if waving some magic wand, Kevin Millwood makes the most frightening situations disap­pear. 
One instant, the bases are loaded. The next, it's presto­chango, abracadabra and alakazam -inning over for the Cleveland Indians. Another head-scratching escape. 
"It was like, 'Did I just see that?' Detroit manager Alan Trammell said. "We've got the bases loaded and we're all excited. Seconds later ... Wow!" 
Millwood kept it close for five nerve-racking innings before Aaron Boone hit a two-run homer and Casey Blake and Coco Crisp hit solo shots as the Indians moved into the AL wild-card lead with a 4-2 win over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday. 
Boone's homer off Nate Robertson (6-13) tied it 2-2 in the fifth inning before Blake and Crisp connected in the sixth. Cleveland's last 15 runs have all come via homers. 
The Indians, who have won four in a row and 12 of 14, moved a half-game ahead of the New York Yankees, who lost to Tampa Bay 7-4. It's the first time this year the Indians have been alone in the lead, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 
"We're playing as good as anyone right now," Millwood said. 
Cleveland's three homers ­the Indians have 31 in their last 16 games -wouldn't have meant anything, though, if not for Millwood's tenacity. The right-hander made two Houdini-like escapes, wiggling out of jams in the first and third innings when the Tigers had a chance to blow it open. 
Millwood's knack for dodging trouble is nothing new, with opponents 0-for-16 against him with the bases full. He allowed one earned run and seven hits while throwing 110 pitches in five innings. 
"It's nothing like I've ever seen," Indians manager Eric Wedge said of Millwood's abili-
CLASSIFIEDS 

ty to elude danger. "He throws 60 pitches in the first couple innings and did nothing but get  much stronger. He's tough. It wasn't like it was just today, either, he's been doing that all year." 
Millwood would obviously prefer more 1-2-3 innings, but they've been rare for him this season. 
"It hasn't been easy," said Millwood, who has the lowest run support (3.23 runs in 26 starts) in the AL. "But I've been able to keep us in the game and give us a chance to win, that's a starter's job." 
Rafael Betancourt (3-3) pitched 1 2-3 scoreless innings, and Bob Howry struck out Brandon Inge with the bases loaded to end the seventh. Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 37th save, matching his career-high set with Milwaukee in 1999. 
Los Angeles 3, Boston 0 
The Los Angeles Angels showed a little emotion and escaped Boston with their AL West lead intact. 
Paul Byrd combined with two stomach-churning relievers to shut out the Red Sox on Thursday night, avoiding a sweep. Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia and hitting coach Mickey Hatcher were ejected -Scioscia for the second straight night. 
"I think we feed off that," said Byrd, who allowed four hits in seven innings before Scot Shields and Francisco Rodriguez each pitched out of bases-loaded jams. "These games count. That (emotion) is the way it should be." 
Los Angeles, which moves on to play the Central-leading Chicago White Sox, opened a one-game lead over idle Oakland in the AL West after losing the first two games of the series. 
Despite getting shut out for the fourth time this year, the Red Sox maintained a four­game lead in the AL East over the second-place Yankees, who lost to Tampa Bay 7-4. The Red Sox open a three-game series in New York on Friday with the knowledge that they will still be in first when they leave. 

Byrd (11-9) allowed two walks and struck out four in his second consecutive win. He retired 13 straight batters before John Olerud's slow­bouncing infield single to lead off the seventh. 
Matt Clement (13-4) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2­3 innings, walking two and hit­ting a batter while striking out one. He had won three straight decisions, but also received no decision in five other starts since July 16. 
Tampa Bay 7, New York 4 
Forget about the Boston Red Sox coming to town. The New York Yankees must be thrilled just to see Tampa Bay leaving. 
Carl Crawford hit a two-run double and scored three times, Mark Hendrickson won his fifth straight decision and the Devil Rays held off New York Thursday night for yet another victory over the Yankees. 
"We have to be better. We expect more of ourselves. Tonight is just not acceptable," Alex Rodriguez said. 
Jonny Gomes and Jorge Cantu also drove in two runs apiece, helping the last-place Devil Rays build a 6-0 lead and improve to 11-5 against New York this season. 
The Yankees dropped two of three in this series -not the way they wanted to head into three big games in the Bronx against AL East-leading Boston this weekend. New York remained four games behind the Red Sox but fell a half­game behind Cleveland in the wild-card race. 
"This team tomorrow, they start scoring runs, they don't stop," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "We need to do a better job of controlling the game than we did tonight." 
New York has lost four con­secutive series against the Devil Rays after dropping only four of the previous 38. 
"You can't say we're embar­rassed because they're major league players, too," Derek Jeter said. "They played better than us. I don't know how many times they beat us, but they deserved to win all of 'em." 
Rookie right-hander Chien­Ming Wang (6-4) returned from a two-month stint on the dis­abled list and lasted five innings: After recovering from inflammation in his right shoulder, he gave up three runs and eight hits, dropping to 0-3 against Hendrickson this year. 
Wang said his shoulder felt fine, but he thought it was a mediocre performance. 
"It looked like he was just trying to get his rhythm in the first inning," Crawford said. 
Danys Baez retired Rodriguez with a runner on to end the eighth, then finished for his 35th save in 42 tries. He has seven saves against New York this year, tying Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox in 1990 for the most against the Yankees in one sea­son. 
"Fastball right down the mid­dle," Rodriguez said. "I had a great pitch to hit. I didn't come through, and that's not accept­able. I need to do more." 
Hendrickson (9-7) retired 13 straight after Jeter's leadoff single in the first, then ran into trouble in the seventh. But he hung on to improve to 3-0 in four starts against New York this year.

Carpenter became the first 21-game winner in the major leagues, Albert Pujols homered twice and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the fading Mets 5-0 Thursday night. 
New York has lost 10 of 12 following a 9-2 stretch, falling to 70-70. The Mets, on the verge of taking the wild-card lead on Aug. 31 before Pedro Martinez faltered against Philadelphia, have lost eight of nine since then and dropped 5 1/2 games back of Houston, which leads in the wild-card chase. 
"We've got to see if we can get something going from the little funk we're in," Mets man­ager Willie Randolph said. "Obviously we've picked a bad time to go into a little swoon, and it's hurting us." 
St. Louis cut the magic num­ber for clinching its second straight NL Central title to 10, beating the Mets for the ninth straight time at Busch Stadium. 
Carpenter (21-4) allowed three hits in seven innings, struck out seven and walked one, lowering his ERA to 2.21, second in the major leagues' to Roger Clemens' 1.57. He's 13-0 in his last 16 starts with a 1.36 ERA over that span. 
"What a performance we're watching," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "It's just been a privilege to watch this kind of excellence." 

Carpenter said everything was working against the Mets. 
"I made quality pitches over and over again and kept the ball down in the strike zone and kept them off balance," he said. 
Carpenter has started 22. games in a row in which he allowed three runs or fewer while pitching six innings, the longest stretch of coq.<>ecutive quality starts in the NL since Bob Gibson also did it 22 straight times in 1968. 
Pittsburgh 8, Arizona 7 
The Pittsburgh Pirates went through two managers and a pair of 12-inning games in three days before finalJy.ending a record-tying home losing streak. 
Humberto Cota singled home the winning run in the 12th, and the Pirates overcame Tony Clark's two homers and five RBis to end a 10-game home losing streak with a victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday. 
"This feels really good, because we didn't want to break that record," Cota said. 
The Pirates lost 10 in a row at home for only the second time in their 119-season history and the first time since 1968. Their first victory in Pete Mackanin's three games as interim manager since replac­ing the fired Lloyd McClendon also ended a six-game overall losing streak. 
"Hopefully, this relaxes every­one and we can start playing better ball," Mackanin said.

With a 56-83 record, they can't play much worse. 
Pittsburgh was within two outs of losing following Clark's second homer, a three-run go­ahead drive in the ninth, when Jason Bay hit a tying two-run shot -his 26th -in the bot­tom of the inning off Tim Worrell. Worrell blew his third save in four opportunities. 
In the top of the inning, Jose Mesa blew his third consecutive save opportunity by giving up Clark's 25th homer. Clark also hit a two-run drive in the first off Josh Fogg during his 17th career multihomer game. 
"The goal is to shake hands at the end of the day," Clark said of his big day in a losing cause. "If it's a 5-for-5 that does it or a 0-for-5, it doesn't matter." 
After the Pirates couldn't score with the bases loaded in the 11th, Rob Mackowiak sin­gled off Buddy Groom (0-1), Arizona's seventh pitcher, to start the 12th and moved up on Freddy Sanchez's sacrifice bunt. Cota, who doubled in a run in the eighth, then singled to center to give Pittsburgh its first home victory since Aug. 23. 
"It's good to finally win a game -it seems like it's a lot longer than it's actually been," Bay said. 
San Diego 3, Colorado 2 
It was a big bounce-back night for Brian Lawrence and Robert Fie!,(, who helped carry the San Diego Padres to their biggest lead in the NL West this year. 

Lawrence threw seven strong innings and Fick singled in the winning run with two outs in the lOth inning as the Padres beat the Colorado Rockies on Thursday night to climb one game above .500. 
The Padres (70-69) took a seven-game lead over idle Los Angeles and San Francisco, which lost 5-3 to the Chicago Cubs. San Diego took two of three from last-place Colorado. 
"We control our own destiny," Fick said. "As long as we win every night, we don't have to worry about anybody else." 
Lawrence, Akinori Otsuka, Trevor Hoffman and Scott Linebrink combined to five-hit the Rockies. Line brink (6-1) pitched a perfect lOth. 
Miguel Olivo started the win­ning rally by drawing a leadoff walk in the 10th off Jose Acevedo (2-4). Pinch-hitter Woody Williams, one of the Padres' starting pitchers, sacri­ficed him to second. After Mark Loretta grounded out, Fick hit a fly ball over right fielder Brad Hawpe to score Olivo. 
"Shoot, I was just trying to be aggressive and hit the ball hard for once," Fick said.

During his running exorcises, Bonds sprinted around the basns and spoke with several coaches. After getting instructions on how to quickly head out of the bat­tor's box for first base, Bonds cracked: "What if I hit a home run'?'' 
''I'm not waiting on his swing. I take that for granted," Giants manager Felipe Alou said. "The thing is running the bases. He ran better than in spring training and in the last month of last year. At this time last year, he was limping and complaining about the knee. It's much, much better than a year ago, or in spring training." 
Bonds and general manager Brian Sabean refused to give a timetable for his return, but the Giants' longtime left fielder said he would be willing to return even as a pinch-hitter. 
"I want to play [in the outlieldl if it's my pick, but I have to do what's best for the team," Bonds said. 
"l hope he's activated during tho weekend -that everything is OK enough that he's adivat­ed," /\lou said. "(Friday(, I don't see it as a sure thing, because we've got to see how he eomes in tomorrow."

'There's a feeling of urgency, because we know the diflimmee that he could make for us," Alou said. 
Gianl'> owner Peter Magowan and Sabean watched Bonds' workout from a luxury box above the field, while at least 40 reporters and photographers crowded into fiml territory in tl1e otherwise empty stadium. 
"It's days like this that tell you he's getting closer, but he's going to have to feel like he's rnady," Sabean said. 
Bonds, who has 703 career homers, said Wednesday he would definitely play this season, continuing his quest to overtake Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Huth (714) on baseball's career homers list.

Bonds could return soon 
Associated Press 
SAN FHANCISCO -Barry Bonds felt strong and limber while taking swings and running the bases in a pregame workout back home Thursday. and the San Francisco Giants slugger said there's a possibility hn eould return this weekend. 
Bonds, who hasn't played this season after thrne surgerins on his troublesome right knee since Jan. 31, faced 21 pitches from Giants right-hander Kevin Correia split into two sessions in a simulated game. lie took just one swing at the first seven pitches, but hit an early pitch from the second session out of the park. 
Ilo also took a round of batting practice against hitting coach. Joe Lefebvre, swinging 17 times and hitting another homer along with a handful or line drives. Bonds took more batting prac­tiee later with his teammates, and he played catch in the out­field. 
He'll consult with his doctors Friday before a similar workout -and if he responds well to the increased stress and waiting periods required by his sport, Bonds acknowledged the possi­bility he could return this week­end. 
"It's not unrealistic, but now it's just the time of how I recov­er," Bonds said. 
Bonds looked good in batting practice for the fourth straight day since rejoining the Giants ~ Los Angeles, where he spent the last two months in rehabilitation. lie also was upbeat being baek in his home park with McCovey Cove behind right field -though the chilly weather tested him.

ND WOMEN'S GOLF 

Irish host Notre Dan1e Invitational at Warren 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team will open its season Saturday and Sunday with the Notre Dame Invitational at the Warren Golf Course. 
The three-round tournament will host a field of 17 teams; including the Irish. Other field notables include Illinois, Western Michigan and Yale. Saint Mary's will also cross U.S. 33 to com­pete. 
Irish head coach Debbie King explained her reasoning in choosing which schools to invite. 
"I usually invite Big East and Central Region teams," she said. "Those are first priority. If none of them can make it, I start on the waiting list of schools around the country." 
Division I women's golf is divid­ed into three regions: East, Central and West. Teams need to beat as many schools as possible from their region to secure a bid to the NCAA Championship Tournament on Nov. 21. 
Despite King's attempts to bring in Big East opponents to the Invitational, only Georgetown and Notre Dame will be repre-­senting the conference at Warren this weekend. Former league member Boston College is making the trip, but the Eagles moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference after last spring. 
While she likes to play Big East opponents early in the season, King says she will not use the Invitational to scout the Hoyas. 
"We've played them many times, and we have a good idea of their caliber," she said. 
King said that opening the sea­son at home is important for the psyche of the Irish. 
"It's the best way to start the season, especially for the fresh­men just getting used to competi­tion," she said. "We don't have to miss classes and we're a little more comfortable at home." 

Teeing off for the Irish this weekend will be junior Noriko Nakazaki, senior Katie Brophy, sophomore Jane Lee and senior Suzie Hayes. The four veterans earned spots after a series of playoffs over the course of the preseason. Nakazaki and Brophy hold the two lowest stroke aver­ages in Notre Dame history. 
"We've had five rounds of qualifying since the first day of school," King said. "It's been a shootout for those top four spots." 
Three other players -senior Lauren Gebauer, junior Stacy Brown and freshman Courtney Sullivan -will compete in a playoff Friday for the fifth spot. King said the three were tied after the first five qualifying rounds. 
Five Irish golfers will compete as individuals. Senior Sarah Bassett, sophomore Alejandra Diaz-Calderon and freshman Lisa Maunu will join the two golfers who do not earn a spot on Friday. 
King also said she feels having the players compete for the top five spots and a chance to com­pete in tournaments is the most fair way to determine the team's roster. 
Butler, Indiana, IUPUI, Bradley, Western Illinois, Eastern Michigan, Toledo, Xavier, Winthrop and Bucknell will round out the !ield along with the Irish, Iloyas, Eagles, Broncos, Illini, Bulldogs and Belles. 
Iowa State won the 2004 Notre Dame Invitational, but will not compete this year.

Belles join Irish at course 
By JORDAN BELTZ Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's will visit Notre Dame this weekend when the Belles take part in the Notre Dame Invitational at the Warren Golf Course. 
Competition figures to be tough, as the Belles are the only Division II squad entered in the event. 
Last year, Iowa, State took home the title in an extremely close match, followed closely by the Washington State. The Notre Dame women's squad fin­ished just 12 strokes behind, in third place. 
This is the frrst time the Belles have ever been extended an invitation to the Notre Dame Invitational, and they feel hon­ored by the bid. The Belles are realistic about their goals for the weekend, but they are excit­ed to get the chance to show off their skills against some of the top college teams in the nation. 
"I think we're all pretty nerv­ous for it, but we hope to play well," senior Megan Mattie said. "It's an honor just to be invit­ed. " 
The Belles hope to put on a better showing than last week, where they struggled in the opening round of the Ferris State Lady Bulldog Invitational. The team eventually pulled it together in the fmal round and salvaged an eleventh place fm­ish, but they know that they can, and will, perform better in the future. 
"As a team, we played well for it being our first tourna­ment, but we could have played much better," freshman Alex Sei said. 

The added pressure of facing some of the top-ranked colle­giate teams in the nation will surely push the Belles to play to the best of their ability, as they are eager to show off their tal­ents to the rest of the women's golfing community. 
The Belles will look to take some of the positives out of last week's match, such as the fact that they defeated regional rivals St. Joseph's and Depauw, and parlay them into a respectable performance this weekend at home. 
Looking ahead, the Belles will begin conference play next week as they travel to Calvin College next Wednesday for the first of three MIAA outings.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. ­New England's quest for an unprecedented three straight Super Bowl victo­ries is in good hands with two stars the Patriots did­n't lose: Tom Brady and Hichard Seymour. 
Brady threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns and Seymour made a game-turning defensive play as the Patriots beat Oakland 30-20 Thursday night, holding Handy Moss, the Raiders' new star, to one big play, a 73-yard touchdown catch. 
"It's important, we want­ed to get off to a good start," said Brady, who had 212 of his yards and both TD throws in the first half. 
New England's 35th win in 39 games since the start of the 2003 season was an odd one -all offense at the start, mostly defense after intermission. One key early adjustment was made by the Patriots, switching from their tradi­tional 3-4 defense to a 4-3 to help fill the gap caused by the loss of inside line­backers Tedy Bruschi and Ted Johnson. 
The Patriots, who also lost coordinators Charlie Weis and Homeo Crennel to head coaching jobs, led 17-14 at h a I l'ti rn e on touchdown passes by Brady of 29 yards to Super Bowl MVP Deion Branch and 5 yards to newcomer Tim Dwight. 
That offset a 2-yard TD pass by Kerry Collins to tight end Courtney Anderson on the game's first series and the bomb to Moss, who at 6-foot-4 simply went over 5-8 Tyrone Poole. 
Anderson also caught a 5-yard touchdown pass with 3:04 left set up by Handa! Williams' block of Josh Miller's punt. 
But Moss was called for offensive pass interference on the 2-point conversion 
play. That wasn't Moss' only mistakn. 
lie also dropped a short first-down pass that could havn gotten thn Raid1~rs out a hole early in thn third quart1~r. 
That nventually lnd to the gamn-turning play with just undnr six min­utl~s lnf't in the pnriod, thn kind ol' play that has marked the Patriots' run to three titles in four sea­sons. 
Seymour, who as usual made a half-dozen big plays on defense, was thn catalyst, pushing Raiders eenter Jake Grove into Collins. 
IN BRIEF 

Westbrook finally speaksafter one-week holdout 
PliiLADELPHIA-Move over T.O. Brian Westbrook is making his way to the top of the line of disgruntled Philadelphia Eagles. 
The Pro Bowl running back cut oiT contract talks with the Eagles because the two sides are far apart on a long-term extension, expressing disappointment management "hasn't stepped up to the plate." 
"Me and my agent have told the Eagles' management that we're no longer interested in talking to them as far as the contract situation," Westbrook said Thursday. "We don't feel as though we've received a pro­posal from them that really repre­sents the value that I bring to this team and my market value. 
"I think that in the last 2 1/2 , 3 years that I've been here, I've brought a lot to this team." 
Westbrook, talking for the first time since reporting to training camp after a one-week holdout, had been seeking a long-term deal after sign­ing a one-year restricted free-agent offer for $1.43 million. 
"I don't see anything but upside for me, and I feel as though I should be compensated for that," Westbrook said. Red Sox hope to build AL East lead in weekend series 
NEW YORK -For the past seven years, the Boston Hed Sox have spent each September trying in vain to catch New York. 
Now they get a chance to play with the lead. Boston begins a big three­game series at Yankee Stadium on Friday night with an opportunity to build a very comfortable cushion over its longtime rival in the AL East. 
After finishing second to the Yankees every season since 1998, the Hed Sox went into Thursday night with a four-game edge as they pursue their first division title in a decade. 
Legendary Auerbach hospi­talized again 
BOSTON -Red Auerbach, the president and former coach ol' the Boston Celtics, has bonn hospitaliznd in Washington with an undisclosnd health problem. 
The 87-year-old coaching great has been in and out of' the hospital the past month for tnsts and a successful surgical procedure, Celtics spokesman Jeff Twiss said Thursday. Twiss would not identify tlw proce­dure or the hospital and said Auerbach was rnadmitted for an unspecified problem within the last 10 days. 
A statement posted on the Celtics' Web site said: "The Au1irbach family expresses their deepest appredation for the concern pertaining to the health of their father. 
"Hed has been undnr the weather at times recently. and he has taken steps with his doctor to return to feeling better."

continued from page 24 
Though Connelly will be keeping his top athletes in South Bend this weekend, he was extremely confident in the team that will be making the trip to Valparaiso, where the Irish finished third last season. 
"We're going to give our younger runners a chance to compete, because they have trained real hard all sum­

mer," he said. 
Among the nine runners making the trip will be Loryn King, a senior who was a part of the team that ran at the NCAA meet last November. 
An injury in the spring limit­ed her opportunities to race during the track season. Connelly wanted to get her back into a race early in the season. 
Joining King will be junior Ann Mazur and a slew of sophomores attempting to prove they are worthy of a spot in the top seven. 
Connelly pointed out that most of these runners will be in uncharted territory this afternoon. 
"We want to put them in a situation where they haven't been before," Connelly said. "They are used to running eight[h] position on the team,· and all of a sudden, they will have to run one or two. We'll see how they respond." 
Connelly also spoke of his group of sophomores, and .the adjustments they made enter­ing their second season. 
"Some of [the sophomores] 
struggled last season as fresh­men," Connelly said. "We sent them home with the message that they would have to train very hard over the summer. They got the message and worked hard. Now it's time to prove it in racing." 
All-Americans Molly Huddle, Stephanie Madia and sopho­more Sunni Olding lead Notre Dame's elite group of runners, which has undergone rigorous training early in the season. 
Connelly could not say for sure who will fill out the top seven, saying the competition is wide open. 
He felt later races would determine who will step into these roles. 
Connelly was certain that his team was eager to begin the season and attempt to improve on last year's fourth­place finish. 
When asked if his team was ready to race, Connelly responded quickly. 
"They're bouncing off the walls," he said.

Belles hoping to rebound at Wooster College Invitational 
By KEVIN BRENNAN Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team needs a confidence boost. 
After losing three of four matches at last weekend's Elmhurst Invitational, the Belles dropped their MIAA season opener Wednesday, losing to rival Hope College in four games. As Saint Mary's (1-4) prepares to participate in this weekend's Wooster College Invitational, head coach Julie Schroeder-Biek thinks the team must improve on its mental state and preparation. 
"We're just going to start from ground zero," Schroeder-Biek said. "We're going to work our way back up, and I'm just trying to narrow their focus. Right now, that's my big focus-the confidence issue." 
The Belles used Thursday's prac­tice to try to iron out some of these issues. Schroeder-Biek said she concentrated less on technical or strategic adjustments, focusing instead on eliminating frustration and keeping her team motivated. 
The tournament kicks off on Friday with the Belles taking on Mount Vernon Nazarene and Muskingum College. Saint Mary's then faces Bluffton on Saturday morning. Once the preliminary matches are done, the eight-team field will be re-seeded and elimina­tion rounds will continue for the rest of Saturday. 
Schroeder-Biek expects the com­petition at the tournament to be strong, especially with perennial power Muskingum in the field. 
The Belles participated in the Wooster College Invitational in 2003 and lost in the championship match. The team is excited to finishing seventh in the nine-team return to the tournament and conference in 2004. Schroeder­hopefully post another similar Biek wants her team to approach result.

"We all have to start thinking like that. 
"Everything is important. Every point is important. Every time you step out on that court, you are step­ping out to win." 
Despite the recent setbacks, Schroeder-Biek feels good about the Belles' chances heading into the weekend's match-ups. The · coach thinks that an improved mental outlook combined with her players' abilities should help Saint Mary's make a serious challenge for the tournament title. 
"We just need to get our confi­dence back, and I'd say we have an excellent chance," Schroeder-Biek said.

Tho Trojans return 11 lnttnrwinners and live starters from last year's 2:~-6 Final Four squad that defeated top­snedod Nebraska 3-2 before falling to Minnesota 3-1. The Trojans had won two straight national titles prior to last year's loss. 
Oklahoma's lone loss came against Alabama. The Sooners return nine letterwinners and f'ive starters from last year's 12-17 team that linished ninth in the Big 12. 
Florida, perhaps the most intimidating group the Irish will meet this weekend, has yet to lose a game this season. The Gators' closest game was 30­27, and their top win was a sweep against No. 15 UC Santa Barbara. They tied for lirst in the eastern division of the Southeastern Conference. After an easy first round win, the Gators gave eventual national champion Stanford a scare but lost 3-2. Florida concluded last season with a 28-5 mark. 
If Notre Dame plans to show the nation's elite it belongs, the Irish will have to rely on Tarutis' leadership on offense. 
Tarutis, as always, kept the Irish offense flowing smoothly and method ieally in Notn~ Dame's own tournament with her quick decision-making with the ball. 


She acknowledged she takes pride in getting the attaek going. 

"I do ltake prideJ. because when you get the oll'ense start­ed, it gives a lot of confidence to the team, if you get a big kill," she said. 
The 5-foot-8 leader was so quick Sunday against Arizona State, she got to the volleyball when she wasn't even in posi­tion. Tarutis "pancaked" a ball, which is when a diving player lays her hand completely flat on the court in order to bouneH the ball ofT to a teammate wait­ing to bump it over tho net. Tarutis downplayed her seem­ingly miraculous play. 
"I wasn't in the right posi­tion, and if I didn't go all out, then I wasn't going to get the ball," she said. "There are a couple of times when [pancak­ing] is necessary, but it's not technically good." 
Conventional or not, she'll do whatever it takes to help her team win. 
The pancake gave Notre

Ilnintzman, who injured her knnn in tho first match of the season. prac­ticed this week some and will likely play. Stasiuk has been out the entire soason so l'ar because of an ofT-season rib injury. She has donn "minimal" workouts in practices. Coaeh Debbie Brown is unsure of' when her outside hitter will return. 
Still, the Irish have a hoard of capable players to keop their early season momentum rolling. And while there's a long way to go on the road to tho Final Four, the Irish might as well get used to eeiAbrating in the Alamodome.

said he feels as though this sea­son he doesn't get as tired as a result of the strength program. 
"It has definitely improved my game," the sophomore said. "Getting out there playing and running the ball, I'm not as tired now. When you know you can get out there and do the job and not have to worry about being tired, it makes your job a lot easier." 
And the Irish have also Qene­fited from their new faeility, the Guglielmino Athletics Complex. The Haggar Fitness Center is twice the size of the team's old facility in Loftus. It contains more than 250 pieces of weight training equipment in addition to six plasma screen televisions. The adjacent room consists of a 45x18 turf field for workouts and exercises. Next to that is a 50-yard track for speed work­outs. 

"Best in the country," said Mendoza, who formerly coached at the University of Mississippi. "I left Ole Miss building a new weight room and coming to this situation and having a little bit to say what was going on here -it's the best in the country." 
And Mendoza used the Irish facility to push his players. He installed a "110 test" in which the Irish had to complete 18 consecutive 110-meter runs with a 30 second rest. Skiii players had to finish each in 16 seconds, all others in 19. 
"I think the conditioning that we received, the team as a whole, was a lot different than any of us ever received," Walker said. "So I would defi­nitely say the training and the conditioning that we received from Coach Mendoza kind of put us over the top." 
Mendoza is a coach who prides himself in having players who are in shape. 
"My philosophy's always been about being in great shape," he said. "I think when you come into camp being in great shape, I think you're focused on what you're doing. At the same time, it builds confidence in what you're doing." 
While most high school play­ers think they need to put on weight before they get to col­lege, Mendoza said he stresses another part of the game ­conditioning.

size to our freshmen coming in, I don't emphasize for them to work on their strength gain, I tell them they need to come in being in shape," Mendoza said. "The first thing we send them is the conditioning manual." 
Mendoza also said the Irish had to adapt to some new exer­cises, such as squatting, which develops the legs. 
"These kids have never squat­ted," he said. "My first week they struggled with 315 pounds. We've made some big kids. Most of these kids are at 550 pounds. When I left Ole Miss we had three kids that squatted over 700 pounds. Not that that's what we need to work to, but I like to get these kids to where they're squatting 600 pounds." 
And with the "Gug" complete, Mendoza has the perfect facility to help him achieve his goals with the Irish. 
"We've made improvements over the summer," he said. "We're not where we need to be, but we're moving in the right direction."

FOOTBALL 

tonight. 
The Broncos enter the game with a 2-0-1 record after beat­ing Virginia Tech Sunday, and come off a season in which they reached the College Cup semifi­nals -a game they lost to the Irish. 
Santa Clara traveled to South Bend early last season to play in the Inn at Saint Mary's Notre Dame Classic. This year, the roles are reversed. The Broncos play host to the tournament they call "El Classico," and the Irish play the role of the highly­ranked visiting foe. 
Notre Dame emerged victori­ous from both contests last sea­son. The Irish won the first game by a score of 5-2, though the game was much closer than the line indicates. 
After the two teams battled closely for the first 80 minutes, Irish forward Katie Thorlakson scored two of her three goals and added one of her two assists in the final 10 minutes. In a dazzling stretch of just three minutes, 39 seconds, she netted five points and took the game's outcome out of question. 
Their second meeting would have no such offensive out­burst. Candace Chapman scored the national semifinal's only goal on a give-and-go with Thorlakson at 72:02. 

The Irish then defeated UCLA 1-1 (4-3 on penalty kicks) to capture the national title. 
The Broncos beat Arizona 2-0 to start the season, but tied No. 21 Wake Forest 0-0 after two overtimes a week ago. 
The Irish have won all four of their opening games in convinc­ing fashion. The team opened

Last week the Irish line didn't give up a sack, helped its run­ning backs rush for 275 yards and chased the play all game. 
Credit strength and condi­tioning coach Ruben Mendoza for the stamina that the line showed.

Younger runners co111pete 
Veterans to remain at home for meet 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team will not send any of its top runners to the sea­son-opening meet, the Valparaiso Invitational, slated to take place this afternoon. 
For any other team, this may seem like question­able coaching strategy, but Irish coach Tim Connelly has a plan. 
He will save his best run­ners for later in the sea­son, allowing them to get more uninterrupted train­ing before they compete in any races. 
This will allow them to be in peak shape for the most important races, including the conference, regional and NCAA meets, all of which take place in late October or early November. 
It's difficult to argue with Connelly's philosophy. It has earned Notre Dame three consecutive NCAA top-1 0 finishes, including a fourth-place result last fall.

Irish set to host tournament 
By KATE GALES Associate Sporrs Editor 
Before the long road trips and exhausting injuries, when every team harbors dreams of a national title and every freshman is full of potential, there are the tour­naments. 
For the Irish, there is one very important tournament­the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament, which Notre Dame hosts annually at the beginning of the season. 
In the midst of dizzying non-conference schedules,

Squad to face tough .cotnpetition at Rally 
By TOM DORWART Sporrs Writer 
The Irish hope to celebrate a championship this weekend. 
It's September, and they're already at the Final Four ­the site of it, anyway. 
This weekend Notre Dame (3-0) heads to San Antonio for the University of Texas-San Antonio Dome Rally at the Alamodome. The Irish don't want to get too far ahead of themselves, but the city of River Walk is right where they want to be in December. 
"We still have a lot to work on, obviously," sophomore set­ter Ashley Tarutis said. 
Though they will face two top-10 teams in No. 8 Southern California (2-2) and No. 6 Florida (5-0) as well as Big 12 foe Oklahoma (4-1), the No. 19 Irish won't consider a tournament championship an upset. 
"[Last weekend's success] gave us a lot of confidence to be able to play with a lot of highly ranked teams," said Tarutis, who made The Inn at

~~~~ Sports Editor 
Harry Oliver lined up for an impossible 51-yard field goal, then booted it through the uprights. 
It's winged helmets vs. golden helmets. Hail to the Victors vs. The Victory March. The Big House vs. The House that Rock Built. 
It's a game of names. Tim Biakabutuka and Autry Denson. Elvis Grbac and Kevin McDougal. Butch Woolfork and Michael Stonebreaker. Bo Schembechler and Lou Holtz. 
It's Version 2005 of Notre Dame-Michigan. One of the most competitive, colorful and dramatic series in col­lege football kicks off tomorrow and everyone is thrilled. 


Everyone that is, but the teams themselves. 
Irish tight end Anthony Fasano says it's nothing unusual, simply the second game of the year. So does his teammate Rhema McKnight and Irish coach Charlie Weis. 
Hot air? Maybe. 
But if the Irish hope to play well in Ann Arbor, Fasano and Co. must treat Michigan as just another game. Getting too hyped will

summed up his squad's outlook best. 
"You have to treat every week the same," Weis said. "You understand the signifi­cance of rivalries between different schools. But if you ever treat any team differ­ently, you're just setting yourself up for a fall." 
Weis showed against Pittsburgh he knows a little bit about coaching. And his attitude will help the Irish tomorrow. 
But for followers of Michigan, Notre Dame and sports in general, tomorrow is the closest college foot­ball comes to theater. 
Since 1978-when the series resumed after a 35­year hiatus -the average margin of victory has been 
6.4 points (not counting, of course, the 38-0 Michigan romp in 2003). 
Tomorrow should be no 
different than in recent years, except for one thing: 
ness of the 

past that caused him to fire footballs over receiver's heads and Travis Thomas to drop them on the ground. 
Weis said after the Pittsburgh game the players were starting to realize they were better than they thought they were. 
He's right. They are better than they thought they were -better than last year's team, better than Pittsburgh and possibly bet­ter than Michigan. 
Yes, Michigan is in the top five as usual, and there's a reason for that. 
Steve Breaston, Chad Henne, Jason Avant, Mike Hart and the rest of the Maize and Blue are good football players. Very good football players. 
But the Irish aren't pushovers. 
They have a Parade All­American offensive line; a running back named Darius Walker who could start for any team in the country; a defensive tackle named Trevor Laws who is only a law degree short of being Chris Zorich; and Quinn. 
Tomorrow is the biggest game of his three-year career. 
l-Ie was heavily recruited by the Wolverines. Michigan wanted him. But Quinn wanted Notre Dame. 
Barring injury he's likely to go down as the Irish career-leader in most pass­ing categories. But that means little if he doesn't win the big games -and none are bigger than Notre Dame-Michigan. 
Enjoy the show.

QUARTERBACKS 
Brady Quinn looked every bit the star he is expected to be when he went 14-of-16 in the first half against the Panthers. He connected with seven different receivers last week for 227 yards. This is his third year at the helm of the Irish offense but his first under Weis. 
Sophomore Chad Henne is back after a breakout freshman season when he amassed 2,743 passing yards and tied a school recor.d with 25 scoring passes. Last week he was 20-for-31 with 227 yards and two touchdowns. Senior Matt Gutierrez is the backup.

IRISH RUSHING IRISH PASSING 
Darius Walker will start for the Irish after racking up 100 yards and two touch­downs on 20 carries against Pittsburgh. Rashon Powers­Neal scored a career-high three touchdowns at full­back last week, and his straight-ahead attitude complements Walker's flashy style. 
Michigan surrendered 211 yards and two scores last week against Northern Illinois. Tackle Gabe Watson and end Pat Massey return as starters for the Wolverines but accounted for only four total tackles Saturday as the squad gave up 4.3 yards per rush. 

Brady Quinn was effi­cient last week-a prod­uct of his experience and Charlie Weis' playcalling. Fasano, an All-America candidate at tight end. caught four passes for 42 yards against Pittsburgh. Rhema McKnight and Maurice Stovall are solid outlets for Quinn.  
Leon Hall is a preseason all-Big Ten cornerback pick and intercepted a pass as Michigan held Northern Illinois to 200 yards and zero scores through the air. The loss of cornerback Marlin Jackson and strong satety Ernest Shazor to the draft will hurt.  
The Irish pass offense looked perfect last week in the. first half. Quinn :will try to spread the receptions around again. Michigan's secondary g~:~.ve up 200 yards to Northern Illinois and will have problems if they play like that against Notre Dame.

DEFENSIVE LINE 
Notre Dame tackles Trevor Laws, above, and Derek Landri plugged the interior last week to hold Pittsburgh to 103 yards rushing. 
Left end Victor Abiamiri tallied six tackles and one sack against the Panthers. Abiamiri's pressure of Michigan quarterback Chad Henne could make the difference in the game. 
Ends Ronald Talley and Justin Brown filled in nicely in backup roles last week -each recording two tackles. 
Senior Brian Beidatsch brings expe­rience and depth in a reserve role. 
MICHIGAN 
OFFENSIVE LINE 
Michigan's offensive line is big, athletic and experienced. 
Fifth year seniors Adam Stenavich, above, Leo Henige and Matt Lentz anchor a unit averaging 317 pounds per man. 
Center Adam Kraus spearheaded the line as they enabled back Mike Hart to rush for 117 yards and one touchdown last week against Northern Illinois. 
Tackles Stenavich and Mike Kolodziej will need to hold their ground and protect quarterback Chad Henne from the grasp of Abiamiri and fellow Irish end Chris Frome.

0-line, running game key Wolverine attack 

By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
While Notre Dame exploded with a 35-point first half against Pittsburgh last Saturday, Michigan was also making a statement of its own. 
The Wolverines scored 27 first half points against unranked Northern Illinois on the same day, all but sealing the win early and allowing coach Lloyd Carr to run the ball -and the clock. 
"Last year

33," Notre school phenom Dame coach Kevin Grady regis­Charlie Weis tered 42 yards on
Charlie Weis 
said. "They nine carries and a
Irish coach
have a lot of weapons." 

Michigan's style of offensive play prioritizes a strong run­ning game whic.h sets up a more experienced, and possi­bly improved, passing game. Though last season's leading receiver Brayton Edwards (97 catches, 1,330 yards, 15 touchdowns) is departed to the NFL, Michigan retains a solid core on its offense. 
Sophomore quarterback Chad Henne, who started all 12 games his freshman sea­son, opened the 2005 season completing 20-of-31 passes for 227 yards and two touch­downs, throwing no intercep­tions. 
Sophomore running back Mike Hart, who saw limited action in Notre Dame's 28-20 victory at Notre Dame Stadium last season (five carries, 17 yards), also holds onto the ball well. 
"My biggest concern with Hart is in 283 touches in a row, he has not fumbled the ball," Weis said. "So obviously he's very good at ball posses­sion, which was a critical fac­tor in their win last week." 
Michigan did not turn the ball over against Northern Illinois. Hart car­
touchdown of his 

own. Jerome Jackson-who started last sea­son against Notre Dame and carried the ball 15 times before getting injured -also saw action in the backfield behind Henne. 
"Any time you can put two or three guys in there that have different types of abilities, I think it creates issues for the defense," Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. "You still have to block them, but certainly we've got three guys in there." 
To make up for Edwards' departure, veteran wide receivers Jason Avant and Steve Breaston lead the way as Henne's primary targets. 
Avant caught nine balls for 127 yards and a touchdown last week, while Breaston grabbed five passes for 42 yards and a touchdown. 
Michigan's strength, howev­er, lies in pounding opponents into the ground with the run­ning game. And Notre Dame's strength on defense -last sea­son and this season as well ­has been its run defense. 
"Defensively, I like their line­backnrs," Michigan coach Llyod Carr said. "They're very athletic and they get to the football well." 
Linebackers Brandon lloyte, Corey Mays and Maurice Crum, Jr. will focus more on running backs in Saturday's game than in any matehup the rest of' the season, with the exception of' facing Navy's option attack. 
Boyte was second on the team in tackles last weekend with nine total, six of them solo and 4? for a loss against a fresh Pittsburgh squad. Weis said Notre Dame will have to adjust on defense bocause he expects the well-coached Wolverines, like his own Irish team, to show new offensive schemes and plays. 
"''m not expecting just to see what they did last week against Northern Illinois," Weis said. "They are not expecting for us just to do what we did against Pittsburgh. 
"I think that we have to both be ready to adjust on the fly."
