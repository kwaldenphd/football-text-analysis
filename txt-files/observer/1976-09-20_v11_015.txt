Would you wait 66 hours for Bruce Springsteen tickets? Mike Rice and Bob Ebel were the first students in line for tickets. They came at 2:45 P.M. on Friday afternoon to wait in line. 
They hope this system will work so that nobody will be able to cut in front of people who have been waiting for hours. 
Students had to sign a list when they arrived at LaFortune for tickets. Then either the student · who signed the list or someone

· representing the student had to be present for spot checks conducted by Rice and Ebel. Each person in line could purchase ten tickets. Students forfeited their position in line if they were not present for the spot checks. 
According to Kathy Denney, one of the students waiting, Security consented to the camp-out on the LaFortune lawn. They would not let anyone camp out at the ACC until 6 P.M. Sunday, but they said we could wait at LaFortune,'' she said. 
According to Security, students have been allowed to camp out since they don't have any tents. Securtiy would not guarantee that the students could continue this practice in the future, however. 
Chad Tiedemann, another wait­ing student said the waiting list was a good idea. "Last year the homecoming tickets were also run exceptionally well by Student Union. But this is the best system I've ever seen for purchasing concert tickets at Notre Dame," Tiedemann said. 
If Springsteen is cancelled, will the 66-hour wait be worth it? ''I'd rather not think about it, " Rice said.

Political problems in Italy do not seem to be a deterrent to students in the College of Architecture who spend their junior year studying in Rome. Despite recent rioting, demonstrations and monetary ·in­stability, 65 architecture students left for Rome early this month. Sixty-seven were enrolled in last year's program. 
According to Professor Ambrose 
M. Richardson, Chairman and Professor of the Architecture de­partment. the year spent in Rome is still thought to be one of the "strong features of the depart­ment.'' · 
Bill Malewitz, a senior architec­ture student, who spent last year in Rome, said the political problems were hardly noticed, except for an occasional riot or demonstration, and of course, the ever-changing Italian lire. Though th!! lire was subject to change overnight, the students usually knew where to go to get the best rate. 
Ed Bleiszner, who also spent last year in Rome, said "Things sound worse ovei: here." As. for the recent presidential election in Italy, Bleiszner said, "It was a beneficial experience arid I was able to see things first hand." 
The fact that students are "out of 
touch· with the University" Brian Brady's only corppaint. . 
Brady also spent last year overseas and said that obtaining 'desired classes .in registration was a bit difficult this. fall, but that the "structure of the program is gre­at." 
Last year, several Notre Dame students had a chance to observe a riot that took place near the hotels where they lived. Bleiszner related that a peaceful demonstration tur­ned into a riot when a group of leftist Roman students attacked policemen. Shots were fired and the police spread tear gas through­out the crowd. The riot took place around lunchtime when N.D. stu­dents were giD_pg to lunch. Bleiszner said they went inside until the crowds dispersed. 
Architecture students have had the opportunity to study in Rome their junior year since 1969. The Architecture College does not re­quire the year abroad, but it is strongly recommended. Richar~­

son said over the years there have been individual complaints, but nothing about the program in general. 
The cost of year overseas is dependent upon the amount of traveling done, and money spent for gifts and entertainment. The architecture students are also re­quired to buy all their meals. Malewitz suggested that "it would be better if they had a program to provide meals. We had to buy all three meals and it got pretty expensive." ' 
Aside from minor individual complaints, the consensus is that the year overseas is a beneficial opportunity. An accrediting board that recently visited the Architec­ture College said the year in Rome is one of the strong points of the whole college.

Possible gunshot fired at Nickie's 
by Jack C. Silhavy StaH Reporter 

What may have been a gunshot was heard· late Sat. night outside Corby's Tavern but the police would not give details as to what actually happened. A Nickies' checker also reported that a man leaving Nickie's a short while earlier dropped a gun on the front steps of the bar. 
Several persons reported . that 
they heard a loud sharp crack 
which could have been a gunshot, 
 but no one could give a specific. time. Three police cars pulled up a few minutes later and a witness said that "the police had some guy across the street." The police stayed for at least one hour. 
An anxious crowd gathered, but, again no one could be found who knew anything definite. 
The South Bend Police first denied having dispatched the cars. They then refused to release any information, saying that it could not be given over the phone. 
No preliminary report wa·s filed with the South Bend Tribune, which ususally receives accounts of all police activities.

Mowatt lectures on Shake:speare 
by Donna Berndt 
StaH Reporter 

Women in Shakespeare was the topic of a presentation by Barbara Mowatt last Wednesday evening at the first of the American Scene Lecture Series. The associate professor of English at Auburn University was greeted by a capa­city crowd in Carroll Hall. 
Mowatt began her talk by ex­plaining her unusual title, "The Wicked Witch is Dead." "The image of female characters in Shakespeare," Mowatt said, "is that of a wicked woman symboliz­ing evil, who is destroyed in a Wizard of Oz-like manner." 
Mowatt then illustrated the divi­

sion of Shakespeare's women into 
two categories; goddess and en-
Keenan coals cause chaos 

A fire broke out in a trash recepticle behind-Keenan Hall Sunday afternoon. 
According to John Quinn, who reported the fire, two men, about 20 years old, dumped barbeque coals in the receptical shortly before the fire started. 
''I thought at first that some­thing in my room, like my' fan, overheated," Quinn said. · 
"Then I looked outside and saw these five-foot flames jumping out of the trash recepticle ," he added. 
The Notre Dame fire department put the fire out and received a standing ovation. 
chantress, witch and harlot. The ijrst group "had the purity to bewitch and seduct" and the latter "had the power to attract and transform." 
"Midsummer Night's Dream exemplifies the young maiden who bewitches her lover'' said Mowatt. She went on to say that the whole play deals with this "bewitching power-'' Mowatt pointed to similar uses of the "enchantress" in King Lear, Love's Labor's Lost, Much Ado About Nothing, and Two Gentlemen of Verona. 
"In Shakespeare's romances the pattern changes," said Mowatt, for the young maiden remains pure and beautiful in contrast to wicked stepmothers and lustful mother figures. Mowatt further explained, "the incarnation of female evil is destroyed in these plays." The Tempest proved to be a good example as the evil harlot and wicked witch are dead at the end of the play while the young innocent lives on. 
Shakespeare's depiction of "go­ddess, enchantress, witch, and harlot" has a deeper meaning, stated Mowatt, for he describes the hero's reaction to the female character as different to that of the audience and other characters. 
This discrepancy, argued Mowatt, is based on the fact that the hero's attraction for the beautiful maiden makes him susceptible to her power. Thus Shakespeare's use of the various images for his female characters merely explains the Nickie's and drop a gun out of his coat. He was unable, however, to give the time. 
"He came out of Nickie's with a long brown coat on and I don't know if it was in his pocket or sleeve or what," he said. "He walked to the bottom of the stairs and it dropped there on the sidewalk. It looked like a toy and he started twirling it around his finger like it was a toy gun." 
The man then pocketed he gun and walked away. 
A short time later, the checker heard a sharp report he thought might be a gunshot. Several others  standing around him commented

opinion Bishops for Justice 
~~~~~--------~---john clapp 
For several weeks now, there seems to have been a big "to-do" over the Catholic bishops who first met with Mr. Carter and then with Mr. Ford. There have been articles about them in Time and Newsweek magazines, various newspapers throughout the country, and even our own Observer. None of those articles seem to be very compli­mentary to the bishops. And I think that is a shame. 
The ultimate crime in any soc­iety. no matter how "primitive," is murder--that is--the unsanctioned taking of human life. The bishops are of the firm belief that abortion is such a crime. They have there­fore taken steps, within the rights granted to all Americans, to fight such a crime by working to change the law as it now stands. 
I have unfortunately nothing to say to those people who believe that abortion is right. But those who feel that it is wrong and yet will do nothing to prevent it, are indeed like Pontius Pilate. He knew that Christ was an innocent, yet he did nothing but wash his hands. of the whole, disturbing affair. 
It is the duty of these bishops, as Christians, to tight all injustice. It 

ingalong junk 
has nothing to do with sectarian morality. Ifthat were the case, then the millions of other Christians and 
Jews who are fighting abortion as well, would certainly not be doing so. It is not even the only ''Cath­olic" issue, as some people believe the bishops think. It simply has gotten more press than other issues, such as aid to parochial schools. Rather, it has to do with whether responsible men and wo­men of all faiths or none, will allow this or any taking of human life to go on; whether it be in sterilized hospitals, on the streets, in an electric chair, in old-folks homes, or even in war. "Silence is con­sent" is the old adage. · 
If we as a nation maintain that all murder is illegal no matter what the Supreme Court rules, we must then go on record acknowledging that fact. This is certainly not to say this will eliminate all abortions. Those who believe that are fooling 
.only themselves. Programs, both private and public, must be insti­tuted to aid and educate those who do not want or who cannot afford to have children--that goes for men as well as women. 
Finally one must ask those who say that Catholics do not listen to their bishops any more, or that they do not represent the feelings of the majority of Catholics: If this is true, then why is there such a fuss being made? Why have these men received so much attention from the press or the two presidential candidates? Perhaps those that think that Catholics do not listen to their bishops are really, to use some ''pop psychology,'' reflecting their own lack of respect for temporal or spiritual authority. It seems to be the fashion. 
Anyways, let all responsible people in this country unite not under the banner of some secular morality but under the banner of Justice--Justice for the poor, the aged, women, the Black-American, the Native-American, the His­panic-American as well as the unborn American, who has no voice at all. We are personally against the injustice done to these people everyday. Are we to do nothing about them as well? Then how dare we smirk at men who are trying to fight at least one segment of this injustice?

One of these people was a Buffalo policeman who had just begun his own ice cream shop after ten years on the force. His name is Jim, and he lives across the street from my sister, Terri. After dinner one night, she and I stopped at his ice cream parlor for dessert, and 
luckily, he was there, too. Terri and I ordered hot fudge sundaes and sat down to talk with him. 
After he mentioned that he had only been in business for three weeks, Terri asked "Whatever gave you the idea of doing this?" Jim, who's in his late thirties with greyish-black hair, paused a min­ute and then replied, "Well, I was kinda disappointed that you could never get a good hot fudge sundae around her." We laughed, and Jim continued, "Most of the places add some kind of chocolate syrup that waters it down; but anyway, I've always wanted to do something like this. And everyday, I've driven past this place on my way home from work, noticing that it was always boarded up, but think­ing that it would be a really good location for something like this. And so, I talked it over with my wife, she agreed, and I bought it." 
With that, Jim smiled, the proud smile of an entrepreneur in busi­ness for the first time. 
''I've always wanted to do some­thing like this" --that's what Jim said, and it really struck me back then, just as it strikes me now when I wonder about my major in terms of a career. Jim had gone through four years of college and then to a police academy, but it was only· now, finally, that he was doing what he really wanted to do. 
WASHINGTON--When Lieu­tenant Viktor Belenko of the Soviet Air force delivered a spanking new MIG-25 "Foxbat" fighter plane to the Japanese last week, there was tremendous excitement amongst all Western military commands. The Foxbat ·is considered the world's fastest warplane and every­one, especially the U.S. Air Force intelligence people, were dying to have an opportunity to examine every toggle switch on it. 
The Japanese knew the Soviet Union would put tremendous pres­ure on them to have the MIG-25 returned immediately so they ask­ed the United States how they could stall for time. Pentagon officials huddled for a few days and then a general came up with the answer. "What we need is an expert in stalling--someone who can keep the .M~G from being sent back and at the same time not offend the Soviets." 
"Whom do you have in mind?" the secretary of defense asked. 
"Charley Muleback." 
"Who the hell is Charley Mule­back?" another general asked. 
"I  can't  tell  you  now,"  the  
general replied.  
Muleback  was  flown  out  that  

evening. He arrived at KHakodate airport and was taken to the Foxbat which had been completely sealed off by the Japanese and under heavy guard. In another part of the airport an angry Russian Embassy official was screaming at the Japanese officials that the Soviet Union wanted its MIG back immed­iately, and if they didn't get it there would be serious consequences. 
The Japanese introduced Mule­back to the Russian. 
"Tell him," Muleback said, "tnat the plane's been completely totaled .and we're going to have to start from scratch to rebuild it.'' 
A Japanese official translated this. to the Russian. 
The Russian protested that the plane was in perfect condition and there wasn't a scratch on it. 
Muleback shook his head. "That's what all MIG-25 owners say, but they never look under­neath the plane where the real damage is. Besides, we're going to have to replace the two afterburn­
ing jet engines. At the impact ot landing, they were wrecked beyond repair and I believe they wouldn't 
' 
last another 500 miles. Tell him I 
personally called the spare parts 
factory in Lansing, Mich., and they 
promised they would air freight the 
engines in two months." 
The Russian made a telephone 
call to his superiors and then .returned. "We'll take the plane as it is," he told the Japanese, "and make our own repairs." 
Muleback, when told what the 
Russian said, replied, "Even if the 
afterburning engines worked, 
we're going to have to put in all 
new air intake valves. They're a 
mess. And we have to replace the 
grill on the radar nose cone and the 
wheels will have to be realigned. 
And we have to change the oil 
filters which means removing the 
radar equipment from the cockpit. 
We found some dirt in the gaskets 
that control the air-to-air missiles, 
and we'll have to send away to 
Shreveport which is the only place 
that still makes them.'' 
The Russian was screaming at 
the Japanese, "Just give us the 
plane as it is!" 
Muleback listened to the trans­
lation and shook his head. 
"I'm sorry, mister. It's too late now because we've got the whole thing torn apart. We were under the impression you wanted your MIG plane fixed so no one would ever know it had been totaled on a Japanese runway." 
The Japanese officials were hor­rified to see the Russian Embassy official beat his head against the ticket counter. 
That night the general in the Pentagon received a cable which said, "I did like you said. Regards, Muleback." 
The elated general showed it to everyone at the meeting. 
"All right," the secretary of defense said. "Who the hell is Muleback?'' 
The general replied, ''He runs a body shop in Alexandria. My kid smashed up my Mustang and it took Muleback six months to repair it. I figured if it took him six months to repair a Mustang, it would take him three years to patch up a MIG-25, providing he can get all the parts. " 


exactly what I was doing here, and if my chosen major would help in the quest for happiness. Unfor­tunately, the answers eluded me. 
And although I'm not ready to go out and buy an ice cream parlor in a fit of despair, I'm going to keep looking for these answers. Until I find them, until I'm happy with them. 
What's your major? 

All he really wanted in life, or so it seemed, was a chance to talk with others and make them smile, and work at a place in which both were possible. And now he had it. 
I was somewhat jealous. With six years of school left, I have few expectations of being successful, or better yet, happy. It's just too far away, and I began to question

The Fall TV Preview 


David 0'Keefe 
The new television season usually holds out about as much promise as the coming of winter. The fall premieres serve not so much to get us excited anout the new upcoming shows as much as they remind us of the vast intellectual wasteland that lies within the borders of the 24-inch screen. 
In fact, one can more accurately gauge the mood of the three networks not so much by what they offer in the way of new shows as by which old shows they retain, and this season they've retained some beauties. High on the lost of flaccid trash we can expect for at least another season are Starsky and Hutch, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Emer· gency! and Switch. Lest these shows become lonely, they have been provided 
with  all  sorts  of  new  friends.  
Some samples:  
Delvecchio  (9:00 P.M.,  Sunday, CBS):  

Judd Hirsch plays Delvecchio, who is, amazingly, a cop. But he is a very special cop. He is the systhesis of every endearing salient feature of Baretta, Kojak and Elliott Ness with a dash of Mike Stone. He is a contrived character artfully designed to attract a chunk of the cops-and-robbers audience. but its going to take some fine acting by Hirsch as well as at least a modicum of creati've originality for this show to survive. Executive Suite (9:00 P.M., Monday, CBS): This show might die young just 
because it's so confusing. I guess the best way to describe it is as a prime-time soaper. But the collection of characters is astounding. Adulteresses, bigots, alcohol­ics, power-hungry executives, mistresses, rebellious children and God knows what else promise to make Executive Suite-a bust... Unless, and this could well happen, it happens to catch the fancy of the same audience that made Rich Man-Poor Man such a phenomenal success. But until such time, and even afterwards, this program remains a vaccuous exploitation of the more embarassing side of TV viewers. 

The Quest 

Baa Baa Black Sheep (7:00P.M. Tuesday, NBC): Robert Conrad plays World War II flying ace Pappy Boyington, who assem­bles a gang of misfits for special tasks, ostensibly for their "lack of brains and talent for trouble." Given half a chance this show might have gotten off the . ground, but the time slot erased its half a chance. Whoever at NBC put this show opposite Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley has a definite talent for trouble. 
Gemini Man (7:00P.M., Thursday, NBC): Ben Murphy is a typical television actor, pretty face and trim body. Except in this show it all disappears for 15 minutes at a time. 
It seems there was some sort of nuclear accident and Ben got zonked by some weird rays. Now he can make himself disappear, but only for 15 minutes at a time or elas he'll just fade away. You can probably imagine how valuable Ben is to spies and governments and the sort, and you can just imagine how his 15-minute deadline will lend itself to all sorts of frenetic, nail-biting conclusions each week. I don't know about Ben but I think this show might fade away. Soon. 
Best Sellers (8:00 P.M. Thursday, NBC): The idea is to adapt popular fiction for television. While there may not be any problem with the execution of these movies, the trend in the quality of recent bestsellers will probably be enough to doom this one. 
Spencer's PUots (7:00P.M., Friday, CBS): It looks like it's going to be a bad season all in all for the airplane shows. This one promises to be one of those cutesy crime-fighting chase-sequence formulas that makes Starsky and Hutch so incredibly bad. 
Serpico (9:00 P.M. Friday, NBC): There are really only two major problems with this one. First of all, a series based on the career of undercover cop Frank Serpico hardly stands a chance in the inevitable comparisons with Sidney Lumet's film and Peter Maas' book. And David Birney, a talented actor whose previous nightmares have included Bridget Loves Birney, will be hard-pressed to be nearly as convincing as was AI Pacino. Pitted against ABC and CBS movies and preceded by a strong lead-in in The Rockford Files. however, Serpico could be a very pleasant surprise in 
a not-too-di·~·~·· 
The comedy-variety offerings are varied. Old reliable Carol Burnett is back on Saturday nights, unreliable Sonny and Cher precede Kojak on Sunday, Tony Orlando and Dawn have added George Carlin to their Tuesday night show, and Donny and Marie Osmond are back on Friday might with their shiny teeth and sequins. The new entries: Cos(6:00 P.M., Sunday, ABC): It's good to have Bill Cosby back on TV. This is his second go-around, if you want to count his show in which he played a high school phys­ed teacher, but not many people want to count that. This program is aimed at young viewers, but it is hard to believe that Cosby's brilliant and sometimes hectic humor could be aimed at any one group. Armed with a strong series of guests, Cos could take a run at Walt Disney's show, the perennial powerhouse in the time slot. 
The Captain and Tennille (7:00 P.M., Monday, ABC): This show had a lot of promise when it first started out; an attractive and talented couple with all sorts of recent hits. I don't like the show myself because the Captain comes off as sort of a lemming while Toni Tennille impressed me as an over-bearing Amazon. They'll probably be around for a while, though, just out of sheer desire on the part of ABC to make it work. 

Van Dyke and Company (9:00 P.M., Thursday, NBC): It is very hard to hazard a guess anout the eventual success or failure of this show. Betting against Dick Van Dyke is like betting against Sectrtariat There is no doubt that on the basis of sheer talent and energy Van Dyke is one of the best performers in the history of television, but even his multi-faceted talents might not be enough to overcome the awesome power play that ABC is using to take over Thursday night. 
The comedy shows seem to follow the established pattern: a few innocuous sitcoms with ethnic orracialunderpinnings, made in good faith and intended to be taken with a few grains of salt. With few exceptions, however, the growing reluc­tance of television audiences to laugh at anything may cause a few producers to bite their tongues-in-cheek. 
Holmes and Yoyo (7:00 P.M., Saturday, ABC): Holmes is a regular cop and Yoyo is his partner. Fine, except Yoyo is a robot. John Schuck, a creditable television actor, plays the mechanical man in this bizarre comedy from the people who brought you Get Smart sans Mel Brooks. This haywire series will probably short out halfway through the season unless some fine writing and the almost impossible avoid­ance of robot gags recharg~ its batteries. Mr. T and Tina (7:30 P.M., Saturday.: ABC): The Japanese finally have a sitcom they can call their own, if indeed they wan1 to. Pat Morita (Arnold of Happy Days) plays Mr. T (for Takahashi) and Susan Blanchard is his flaky housekeeper, Tina. The r~ationship between householder and housekeeper has provided a lot of good stuff for Maude and almost all the humot for MacMillan and Wife, but it is doubtful that an entire series on the stuff wouldn '1 become rather dull and dizzy. All's Fair (8:30, Monday, CBS): Another

entry from the Norman Lear stable, this is the story of a conservative political reporter and a liberal newspaper photographer who fall madly in love and argue happily ever after. If this show makes it, it will be because of the combined efforts of Writer­Producer Lear and two very talented performers, Richard Crenna and Berna­dette Peters. 
Ball Four (7:30P.M., Wednesday, CBS): Jim Bouton doesn't have a whole lot of class. He wrote a somewhat raunchy expose of professional baseball, and spent a considerable amount of time revelling in his role as the intellectual iconoclast of the nation's pasttime. Now he hopes to capitalize again by scoring with this series. I don't know how it ever got up to bat. I hope for Bouton's sake it strikes out on three pitches. 
Alice(8:30 P.M., Wednesday, CBS): A takeoff on Alice Doesn't Liv.e Here Any More, Alice concerns itself with the lives of the working girls in Mel's Diner in Phoenix. There seems to be potential here, and the entire success. or failure of the se~ies will lie where it should be, with the 
writers. NancyWalker(8:30 P.M., Thursday, ABC): Nancy Walker is a very funny and talented lady. Norman Lear has created for her the role of a Hollywood talent agent with a neurotic daughter, a recently-returned­from-29-years-at-sea husband and a gay border. If anyone can handle the mess, it's Miss Walker, but she'll need some assistance from the supporting cast to make a go of it. 
And so it goes with the new shows. Television seasons are like the food at the dining hall; you don't really like it but you grin and bear it. But things aren't a total

loss this year. The season does offer us an occasional "Steak Night" in the form of five shows that have every indication of making it. 
The Five to Watch: 
Most Wanted (9:00. Sawrday, ABC): A Quinn Martin production starring Robert Stack, Most Wanted deals with a special task force within the police department whose mission is to bring to justice only the most wanted criminals, usually the perpe­trators of particularly heinous or brutal crimes. But this is not just another violent cop show. The last time Martin and Stack teamed up, the result was the classic series The Untouchables. The combination of Martin's simplistic narratives and Stack· s relentless anj:l believable acting could make lightning strike twice. 
The Big Event (8:30P.M .. Sunday, NBC): NBC. has lined up an exciting variety of spectals to be shown in this time slot. Under the appropriate heading The Big Event will be movies (Earthquake, Gone With the Wind), documentaries, TV novels children's specials and concerts. CharUe's Angels (9:00 P.M., Wednesday, ABC): I don't mind being pandered to in the least. Seriously. the premiere episode was cleverly crafted if a little incredible. But there are a lot of incredible things on television these days. If you don't believe me just look at Farrah Fawcett-Majors. 
The Quest (9:00 P.M. Wednesday, NBC): The television Western is a vanishing breed. The Quest rides the range alone this year. But it is a different type of Western, one that promises to portray the American West with the necessarily violent historical accuracy. But it is not the predictable and obligatory violence that

TimO'Reiley 
''Enchanting ... The New York Times," "Warm and charming ... Billboard:" so read the cliche-ridden ads for Ingmar Bergmann's producton of The Magic Flute (Die Zauberfloete.) But for once, these and a plethora of other synonyms do accurately describe the movie, a greatly different version from many others that have been staged over the work's long history. 
Composed in 1791 by Wofgang A. Mozart, it proved to be his last opera before his death later in the year. He wrote it as a defense of the Freemasons, of which he was one, at a time when they were falling out of favor at the Austrian court. Traditionally, this calls for a very heavy and serious interpretation, emphasizing religious and feminine overtones. . 
Bergmann, however, intentionally drowns the original meaning with lightness and an almost fairy-tale atmosphere. The music (all sung in Swedish with English subtitles) the typically precise and delicate Mozart style, perfectly fits Bergmann's concept. This unusual attempt to film a stage play also features some back-stage vignettes, such as Papageno awakening from a nap, seconds before his entrance on stage, or actresses smoking under no­smoking signs, which further undercut the props of seriousness. 
The story line is simple, almost to the point of being inanae, and definitely subordinate in quality to the music. A­handsome young man (Tamino) is saved from a dragon (wearing something of a Sesame Street costume) by three women who serve the queen. Papageno, a wandering pipe player who wants nothing but a woman out of life, appears and trys to take credit for the slaying, but is caught and rebuked by the women. They show Tamino a Iockett of Pamina (with a picture that comes to life), the daughter of the queen who was kidnapped by Zarastro, described as a rival and evil king. Pamino falls madly in love with the princess, and 
goes off to rescue her, with the magic flute 
given him by the queen. 
Once he reaches Sarastro's land, he fins the flute powerless (except on Papageno, who came, too), and is soon brought before Sarastro's court. There Tamino, along with Pamina, undergoes tests of Earth, Fire, Air, and Water and passes them all. Papageno fails them all and is about to hang himself when three children spirits, who earlier replaced the three women, bring him a wife Papagena, and together they have a flock of Papagenos and Papagenas. Meanwhile, Pamina has rejected her increasingly shrewish mother, and joins Tamino in marriage in Sarastro's kingdom. They then achieve a higher state of spiritual happiness than they had ever known before. 
To Mozart, this all symbolized a rejec­
tion of the contemporary society and its 
women. The initiation into Sarastro's 
kingdom somewhat mirror the rites of the 
Freemasons, and higher order they achieve 
thereafter. 
The outlook of the child, however, 
exemplifies Bergmann's interpretation. He 
focuses on the face of one child repeatedly, 
between and during several long shots 
during the overture. The movie opens with 
scenes of the greenery surrounding the 
theater, complete with sunset and twit­
tering birds. None of the actors appears 
any too serious either, re-enforcing the 
child's view that it is all a fairy-tale. 
Despite all he plot and thematic conjec­ture, the dominating force of the play is Mozart himself. He is the only person that gets a credit. During the overture, the camera flashes to a variety of people besides the girl, of all races and ages, and 
·eventually flashes back to portraits of 
Mozart. His genius for entertaining people 
Rlakes him a man worthy of such 6dulation.

The Tony Randall Show (8:00 P.M., Thurday, ABC): Judge Walter Franklin is the perfect character for Tony Randall: a man who is seemingly on top 'of things but in reality is victimized and confused by the people and the world that surround him. Be it his children, his secretary, his court clerk or his housekeeper, he always comes out on the short end of the exchange. This show will probably be a smash just out of the sheer endearment inspired by both Wal­ter Franklin and Tony Randall.
