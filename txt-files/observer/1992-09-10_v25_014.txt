Clinton campaign targets young vote 
By MONICA YANT Editor-in-Chief 
For political strategists like Kate Fucher, campaign stops like Gov. Bill Clinton's tomorrow at Notre Dame represent opportunities to reach an important, historically "alienated" youth vote. 
"It's time to give American young people the opportunity to get involved in the political process. Their energies, their ideas, and their experiences need to be addressed," said Fucher, coordinator of campus visits in the Clinton/Gore headquarters in Little Rock, Ark. 
Fucher's role is typical of Clinton staffers working to get the saxophone-playing, MTV­watching governor elected in November. At college campuses across the country, workers are trying to galvanize support for the generation Fucher believes has been "overlooked" and made "cynical" by the Bush administration. 
But if Clinton has aimed at attracting younger voters, Bush has counterreacted by staying faithful to his faithful-if older-supporters, according to Robert Schmuhl, acting chair of American Studies. 

"Clearly, the 1992 race has a strong generational aspect/ Schmuhl said. "You see George Bush invoking the name of Harry Truman at every stop-in the hope that older Americans will see some of Truman in Bush." 
"Bill Clinton, on the other hand, is working as hard as he can to stress his youth -and the youthful presidency of John Kennedy," he added. 
But targetting the youth vote could be a gamble for Clinton, Schmuhl concedes: "Bush knows older Americans vote. Clinton can't be sure about younger ones." 
Historically, voter turnout among 18 to 24 year-olds is among the lowest. Since 1972, the number of young voters has decreased by more than one­fourth-to the point where only

Study: 30 million Americans suffer hunger 
BOSTON (AP) -About 30 million Americans who are poor or struggle to get by fail to eat enough food as hunger spreads beyond inner cities to the heartland, a report says. 
The research, prepared at the request of the Democratic chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, estimates hunger has grown by 50 percent since the rnid-1980s. 
"When we see increasing poverty and decreasing incomes, it's not at all surprising that hunger has increased," said J. Larry Brown, director of Tufts University's Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy. 
The increase in hunger also creates potential for more learning deficiencies among young children, more illness among the elderly and diminished productivity for 
workers, he said. 
In 1985, Brown led a national task force that warned that 20 million Americans suffered from hunger, defined as a condition where health is threatened because a person repeatedly doesn't consume enough nutrients. 
Brown said he has confidence in the updated figures because three different methods were used to calculate them, and each resulted in a total around 30 million. 
Brown said the profile of hunger has changed as the problem has grown. 
"The stereotype is that this is largely an inner city and minority problem," he said. "Those stereotypes no longer hold. "It's very dramatic to go into the Midwest and hold a malnourished child in your arms at a family farm. Hunger

is in America's breadbasket." 
Dr. Stephen Berman, a pediatrics professor and director of health policy at the University of Colorado, said families at high risk for hunger might have never experienced economic trouble before. 
"We have a situation where you have people who are unemployed or who go from a well-paying job to a minimum paying job," said Berman, who also served on the 1985 hunger task force sponsored by Harvard University. "It takes a while for them to understand the system to get food stamps or other supports." 
Betty Khanoyan, 33, a mother of four from Clinton in central Massachusetts, said she has been helped by the federal food supplement program for women, infants and children, known as WIC. 

Clinton visits NO tomorrow 
By PAUL PEARSON Associate News Editor 
Democratic presidential candidate Governor Bill Clinton will address the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community at 1 p.m. this Friday in Stepan Center. Doors will open at noon. 
Due to seating limitations, attendance at the event will be limited to ND/SMC students, faculty and staff. Admission will be on a first-come, first-served basis to those presenting valid ND/SMC I.D. cards. 
Notre Dame received word of Clinton's plan to visit about a week ago, according to Rex Rakow, director of Notre Dame Security. "It's fairly normal to get seven to ten days notice for a campaign visit like this," Rakow said. 
Notre Dame Security is "helping coordinate" security for the event with South Bend, St Joseph County and Indiana State Police, as well as Secret Service members, according to Rakow.

ND graduate teaching program awarded grant 
By THERESA ALEMAN News Writer 
The Notre Dame graduate teaching program has been awarded an $80,000 grant by Burlington Resourses Foundation, according to Nathan Hatch, dean of the Notre Dame graduate school. 
Over the next four years, five students will receive $4,000 each year. Recipients of the grant money are senior graduate students currently working on their dissertations, according to Hatch. 
Grant recipients were selected for their academic excellence as well as past 
teaching experience, he said. 
All grant recipients will teach sections of Freshman Seminar, Hatch said. 
Though gr-aduate students are currently teaching sections of freshman seminar, Hatch believes that "the freshman program stands to be greatly enhanced through this program" by attracting the best graduate students with the most teaching experience. 
Hatch, who was on the board to select grant recipients last spring, added that the grant money was awarded to ND graduate students so that highly motivated students could "learn to teach well." 


Hurricane's toll: A boy named Andrew 
MIAMI (AP) -Andrew Guanche was laid to rest Wednesday in the calm after the hurricane for which he was named. 
He was born into poverty and took with him little: a pacifier and a hairbrush, placed alongside him in a tiny casket, 10 inches wide and 24 inches long. They were the first gifts he received in his short life. 
"Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!" his mother, Natalia, cried hysterically as she bent over his grave, running her hand across the casket, the last connection to her son. In Spanish, she screamed: "Why, God, why? You gave me this child only a few days. Why did you take him?" 
Natalia and Andrew's father, Felipe, each placed a chrysanthemum on the casket. 
And then Andrew was buried, in a cemetery surrounded by Hurricane Andrew's fury: piles of tree limbs, dirt, the debris of houses. Some of the trees in the cemetery itself were toppled. 
Both Andrews had lived short lives that touched all around them. 
Baby Andrew was 9 days old when he died. He slipped away, not in a horne surrounded by toys and pets, but in the coldness and loneliness of a Red Cross shelter, in a donated crib that suffocated him. 
He was the 39th death and, so far, last death in Florida blamed on Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane had hastened his birth, and then betrayed him. 
Buried with him was a piece of the American dream of his parents, who came to the United States 12 years ago from Cuba aboard the "Freedom Flotilla" boatlift. 
"I lost part of my life," said his father, a 48-year-old unemployed handyman. "It's a hard strike for us. We have lost all our happiness and strength. I am emotionally destroyed." 
He was the one who picked up the child from his crib, felt the coldness of his body and stared into a face that had turned blue. 
"I can't overcome that memory," he said. 
The funeral drew scant attention, a dozen relatives and friends. 
But to his father and mother and six brothers, baby Andrew was an omen of good fortune. He enriched their lives at a time when they had lost everything they had to Hurricane Andrew. 
Even in the finality of their son's death, they did not have any money to pay for his funeral or cemetery plot. The funeral horne donated both. 
"My dream was to come to the States," said Felipe, speaking through a translator. "And even if we were living among the poor people, we were happy." 
He said he saw his purpose in life as being more of a father than a husband, and Natalia, 41, was more of a mother than a wife.

places on unborn human life." 
Hold on, there. Notre Dame invited both Bush 
and Clinton to come here. Bush simply hasn't 
said whether or not he'll come. 
"Yeah, but they probably told Bush he couldn't give a political speech or some garbage like that. Anyway, I'd have liked to see Bush. He's ·ust like Harry 'Give em Hell' Truman, ya know." 
He is trying to paint himself in Trumanesque colors, but frankly I don't see the resemblance. First of all, Bush voted against Truman. Secondly, Truman was a man of rigid principle. Bush hasn't met an issue he didn't reverse himself on. Remember the 'no n.ew taxes' thing? 
"Now, don't ya start blaming Bush for somethin' Congress did! Bush's whole 'Clean House' deal is about stuff like Congress raising taxes. Don't you remember anything from civics class, kid?" 
Wait a second. Bush's promise was to fight Congress, with vetoes if necessary, on stuff like tax increases. Also, about 90 Republicans members of Congress voted against Bush's last budget. Don't you read the papers, sir? 
"Nab. Then I run the danger of seeing one o your columns." Then you didn't read my last one about Bush and his 'family values' campaign. 
"Nope. But it was probably some trash about letting single women and gays run households. No wonder Dan Quayle is so upset at ya 'media elite!'" 
You're not fond of my writings, I take it. 
"Not one bit. Yer one of those flag-burning, fag-loving, draft-dodging liberal Democrats who've abandoned family values. I can tell from yer columns." 
Pardon me, sir, but I'm not a Democrat. I'm an independent (it cuts down on my junk mail). Heck, I'd vote Republican, if they nominated someone like Theodore Roosevelt, someone who really wants to change this country. 
"Hey, kid, ain't ya been paying attention? Bush is the real candidate for change. He says so all the time." 
Yeah, every time he sees. a negative poll, he responds with a change in his views. He was once pro-choice, you know. 
"Hey, at least MY candidate didn't have to blow a saxophone to get TV time." True. All Bush had to do was lose his lunch in the Japanese prime minister's lap to get on TV. "That's it, ya flaming liberal! Let's step outside!!" 
Calm down, sir. This is a 'kinder, gentler nation.' Remember? Anyway, I've finished my beer now, so I'll leave. Anything else you want to say, Mr. Bush-lover? 
"Yeah! Go Blue!!"

Judge removed from tobacco case 
PHILADELPHIA -A federal judge who has presided over cigarette-hazards lawsuits for the past decade has been removed from one case by an appeals court that said he had a possible bias. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also overturned a February ruling by U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin of Newark, N.J., who ordered confidential tobacco industry documents turned over to the plaintiff, a woman whose father died of lung cancer.The tobacco industry appealed, saying Sarokin was so prejudiced against it that a fair trial was impossible.The appeals court, in a unanimous opinion released Friday, said Sarokin may be capable of presiding over the case without bias, but "the appearance of impartiality will be served only if an

Many Russians had expressed fear that Yeltsin would surrender two of the four islands during his three-day

SMC works to redisplay sculpture

The Saint Mary's Art Department said that they will continue to work towards l:aving Marcia Kaplan's outdoor sculpture returned to the campus grounds in a letter addressed to the entire SMC community. 
There is a "desire to have them (the sculptures) exhibited there and that's where it should be," said Doug Tyler, chairman of the art department.

One of the four outdoor exhibits was damaged either the evening of Aug. 27 or the early morning of Aug. 28. After the damage was incurred "The administration contacted a member of the Art Department and insisted that the works be removed from the exhibition site, both to protect them from further damage and because they questioned their suitability for exhibition at Saint Mary's College," the letter also said. 
The letter continued by stating that in "the opinion of the Art Department these works are fully appropriate for public exhibition and display at Saint Mary's College." 


Justice Department clears some in check scandal 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Justice Department on Wednesday began clearing an unspecified number of lawmakers of criminal wrongdoing in an investigation of the scandal-plagued House bank. 
But the preliminary inquiry of thousands of overdrafts will leave some members under a legal cloud through Election Day. 
"On the evidence we have reviewed, I have concluded that there is no basis for pursuing a further inquiry regarding possible criminal violations 

Feigl that their has been no formal communication between her and the art department, but the artist, Kaplan, has said the sculptures were best displayed on the grounds where they were originally intended to be. 
The issue is more complex now that the community is involved, said Feigl. 
Tyler said an emergency meeting of the Faculty Assembly was called for Sept. 17 to discuss the issue, but Feigl said that she knew of a regular meeting of the Faculty Assembly next week, but does not recall seeing discussion of the issue on the agenda, although it could be a special topic. 
"We will continue to try to remedy the situation so that the artist is satisfied with the display," said Tyler. 
concerning your account," special counsel Malcolm Wilkey told individual House members in hand-delivered letters Wednesday. 
Within hours, 58 members said they had received the letter. 
Among those cleared were Speaker Thomas Foley, D­Wash., who had two overdrafts, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who had 22. 
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., had no overdrafts. 
The Justice Department would not say how many House members were being cleared in the initial batch of letters, expected to be delivered over the next few days, or how many will face a continuing review. 
But a department statement said it was Wilkey's "firm expectation that the vast majority of members and former members under review will receive clearance letters." 
Wilkey's letter to members said future notification letters will be sent "as soon as we have satisfied ourselves that the records do not disclose any conduct which would warrant further inquiry." 
He wrote that the notifications received now "should not imply that members not yet notified will not in the future receive a letter similar to this." 
Rep. William Thomas, R­Calif., who had 119 bad checks and did not receive a letter, said, "I assume they're going through the stack and doing the easy things first. Some will take longer. I imagine it will go on all fall. It's not politically bad so long as the media report it correctly." 
Foley, in a statement on behalf of the House Democratic leadership, said it "has always been evident to us" that "no member has violated any law in this matter."

The importance of age in 1992, however, is obvious. A youthful ticket attracting a youthful audience is what Clinton's assistant press secretary Ethan Zindler will fuel a November victory. 
"As we get closer to the election, it's really starting to pick up -people are going from 'I hate George Bush' to 'I really like Bill Clinton,"' Zindler said. That some of Clinton's strongest supporters are in the 18 to 30 year-old group can be credited to the Democrats' "willingness to speak out on the issues that are of concern to younger people," he said.

Although statistics and poll results vary on an almost daily basis, an August survey conducted by MTV showed Clinton leading Bush 57 to 33 percent among 18 to 29 year­aids -although the same poll showed Bush with a 51 percent favorable reading among the voters surveyed.

Dear Members of the Notre Dame Community, 
During the past academic year a small subcommittee of the working group on Missions, Opportunity, and Challenges (MOC) of the Colloquy for the Year 2000 drafted a mission statement for the University. We discussed this draft with the members of the MOC group of which we are a part and with the Committee for the Whole of the Colloquy. We now feel ready to share that draft with the larger Notre Dame community for your comments, suggestions and emendations. 
I o the left of the mission statement we have added a "Prenote" which sets out the theological understanding that undergirds the mission statement itself. That "Prenote" intends to express our understanding of the word Catholic which is pan of our self-understanding of Notre Dame as a national Catholic university. It is not the mission statement but the context out of which the mission statement arises. 
Our purpose in publishing this draft in the Observer is simple: we invite students, staff and faculty to help us produce a final statement of mission and purpose that will be part of the final document produced by the colloquy. We would invite you to communicate any reactions you may have to any member of the subcommittee whose name is listed below. We would like such responses before the end of September. 
Gregory Burrus (Student Body President) Lawrence Cunningham (Professor: Theology) Carol Ann Mooney (Professor: Law School} Thomas F. O'Meara, O.P. (Warren Professor: Theology) Mark Poorman, C.S.C. (Assistant Professor: Theology) Kathleen Maas Weigert (Academic Coordinator: Center for Social Concerns) 
PRENOTE: THE CONTEXT OF THE MISSION 
The following statement of purpose and definition will speak of the University of Notre Dame as aplace of teaching and research, of scholarship and publication, of service and community. These components follow quite naturally from certain distinctive characteristics ofCatholicism. The first is sacramentality. The Catholic vision encounters God in all things ­people, events, the world at large, the whole cosmos. It is in and through the visible world and our endeavors within it that we come to know and experience the invisible God. The second is mediation. The Catholic vision perceives God to be not only present in, but also working through persons, events and material things. The Catholic believes there is an 
THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME 


he University of Notre Dame is a Catholic academic community of higher learning, animated in a special way from its origins by the Congregation of Holy 
L_______J 

Cross and dedicated to the communal pursuit and sharing of truth. This University exists that through free inquiry and open discussion the variant lines of Catholic thought might intersect with all the forms of knowledge found in the arts, sciences and 
professions. This University is Catholic in its deliberate determination to render to the Church and to the world this unique service in Christian wisdom. 
This purpose is concretely realized in the intellectual interchange that constitutes the life of the University, the development of its students and faculty, and the advancement of knowledge through distinguished teaching, research, scholarship, publication and service. 
Therefore, the University of Notre Dame essentially includes within itself the presence, the voices, and the contributions of diverse scholars and students, both those who represent the Catholic intellectual heritage and those from other traditions. The diversity of Notre Dame is further enhanced by the presence of different races and ages, nationalities and genders. This pluralism enables and enriches the exchange that forms the University community. The continuing presence of a predominant number of Catholic intellectuals is crucial for the Catholic identity of the University. What is asked of all scholars and students, however, is not a particular creedal affiliation, but a respect for the objectives of Notre Dame and a willingness to enter into the conversation that gives it life and character. The University, consequently; insists upon that academic freedom which makes this open discussion and inquiry possible. 
The University fosters the development in its undergraduate students of those disciplined habits of mind which are inculcated by : the liberal arts and which characterize educated, free human beings. Such skills are: to read with critical understanding; to think and express oneself with clarity and coherence in speech and writing; to frame problems of theoretical inquiry or practical action with a sense of the relevant evidence, historical context, and procedures appropriate 
--------~~-------------. 
Thursday, September 10, 1992 The Observer page 7 
intelligibility or coherence to all reality, discoverable through the mind and the imagination, and through the sciences which give shape and discipline to both. The Catholic further believes that all human activity is called into collaboration by God to bring this world to its completion. The third is communion. The Catholic vision sees the way to God and Gods way to us as communal, not individualistic, and that the consummation of the world lies in a communion of persons. That is why the Church as a community has had such a significant role in Catholicism, and why Notre Dame has always conceived ofitselfas afamily and has fostered familial bonds at every level of its institutional life. 
These three characteristics find their source and 
reality in jesus Christ, the incarnation ofthe 
divine in the human. He is the sacrament of 
divine presenceamong us. He is the mediator 
who manifests Gods love to humanity and who 
teaches the way to salvation. He is the Lord 
who formed a new kind ofcommunity to preach 
the coming of the Kingdom. A Catholic university, then, draws its basic inspiration from jesus Christ as the source of wisdom and its mission from the conviction that all things can be brought into their completion in Christ. 
As the University draws its inspiration from jesus Christ, it understands the imperative for higher education to be heightened by critical developments that have made of this planet one world. Religious and cultural, technological and environmental, economic and political challenges make up that world. Free women and men and the communities they form will direct this world into its next millenium. The shape it takes will reflect their knowledge, their skills and their commitments -in a word, their education. 
for a reasonable resolution; to possess an understanding of quantitative thinking and scientific method; to comprehend something of the great discoveries of science and technology as well of their contemporary promise; to think in a manner that is both insightful and creative and to recognize this in others; to analyze issues philosophically back to their fundamental presuppositions; to grasp the significance of Gods self­revelation in jesus Christ and to apprehend the theological implications of knowledge gained in other disciplines as these relate to the great questions of human existence. 

ogether with these liberal capacities of mind, the 
University cultivates in all its students a humane 
sensitivity both to human accomplishment and to 
human misery: an appreciation of such great achievements of human beings as are found in art and literature, history and sociology, mathematics, technology and science; a disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many of their fellow human beings. Such a sense of human solidarity and a developed concern for the common good reaches its fulfillment as learning becomes service to justice. 
As a research university, Notre Dame takes the responsibility not only for the diffusion of knowledge through the academic formation of its undergraduates, but also for the advancement of knowledge in a search for truth through original inquiry and publication. This objective particularly engages the faculty and the various divisions of the graduate program, but also its professional schools and special institutes. As a university committed to public service, Notre Dame sponsors professional schools that equip their students for a particular career with the skills and disciplines proper to each. The University also sponsors special institutes whose focus is research and science on pressing contemporary social issues. The graduate programs, the professional schools and these special institutes, aided by the general ethos of the university, also foster in their students those intellectual habits and humane sensibilities that the University expects from all its graduates. 
The Catholic character of Notre Dame as an academic community depends upon the seriousness with which the religious dimensions of all human learning are recognized, given priority, and explored throughout the University. 
The University embodies its deep concern for the religious and moral education of the students not only in the academic reflection brought to bear upon ethical and social issues but also in its encouragement of a manner of life consonant with a Christian community. Residential life contributes significantly to develop in the students that sense of community and of responsibility which prepares them for subsequent leadership in building a society that is at once more human and more divine. As a Catholic community, liturgy and retreats, spiritual direction, volunteer work and the continual promotion of service, permeate the life of the University and contribute to the complete education of the human person. 
In all of these dimensions of the University, Notre Dame pursues its objectives through the formation of an authentic human community graced by the Spirit of Christ.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Controversy surrounding Kaplan's sculpture contributes to its purpose 
Dear Editor, 

I was pleased to read in The Observer (Sept. 7) that Marcia Kaplan's sculpture, previously displayed in front of LeMans Hall at Saint Mary's, has sparked controversy and debate concerning both the piece as well as the role of art today. 
In lH·r Tw_;, r .. lu;,n. \. "· :.larle laLu1 uuJ he1 fri~.:11J concluded that the sculpture "must be some kind of revolting joke," and they insist that it "didn't give us anything to ponder about our bodies that we haven't been forced to before." 
Perhaps they didn't ponder further about their anatomy, but it is obvious that the sculp­ture prompted a strong reac­tion, an intelligent conversation, and subsequent thought which Tabor felt strongly enough about to share with all students and faculty. 
These are precisely some of the goals many artists strive toward with their work. And many women artists today, such as Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons, choose to work with the exact same issues of the exploitation and subjugation of women that Kaplan apparently addresses. 
Their art, and perhaps Ka­plan's art, does not endorse traditional ways of viewing women, as Tabor suggests. Rather, through their work, they attack society's way of thinking, with the hope of prompting debate and instigat­ing changes. 
Less specifically, a function of 
DOONESBURY 

modern art is to open the senses and the mind to new and different ways of experiencing and thinking, not only about art, but about the world around us. Tabor wished for a warning and an explanation of the work before she experienced it. 
However, I must agree with Ki!.pl··" "1 ., ]J,,,. "" rJ, .. ;, .. t" ::OjJlJli uul lwl iulellllUil::O. nw viewer must interpret the work for himself or herself, and then use the experience and the knowledge gained for his or her own purposes. What use do we have for a work which has been explained and untangled for us? 
The manner in which the piece was abruptly presented allowed each person to ap­proach the sculpture without previously formed expectations, and thus they were free to react in their own individual way. 
In the article, Tabor agrees with Prof. Schlesinger's definition of art as "a beautiful creation." But I have to agree with the recently deceased American avant-guard com­poser John Cage, who said, "left to itself, art would have to be something very simple-it would be sufficient for it to be beautiful. But when it's useful it should spill out of just being beautiful and move over to other aspects of life so that when we're not with the art it has nevertheless influenced our actions or our responses to the environment." 
Tabor also suggests that the sculpture be placed in Moreau 



Viewpoint 

Gallery, "where most art ap­pears." This, she claims, would have lead to a better reception of the piece. Its placement in a gallery, I'm afraid, would have lead to a reception with little or no debate, and the fullest potential of the work would not have been served.

ums. Many modern artists, from Duchamp in the early part of the century to Christo in the present, have worked to shorten the gap between art and life by bringing art into the everyday environment. 
To quote Cage again, "The changes that have taken place in this century are such that art is not an escape from life, but rather an introduction to it." The hushed observation of art in a museum, entered by a pa­tron full of expectations and pre-conceived ideas, no longer allows art to fulfill its complex new roles in an equally complex modern society. 
Although the entire situation surrounding Kaplan's sculpture seems to Tabor to be a disaster, my understanding of modern art brings me to see the initial installation as a phenomenal success. I am happy to read that Ms. Kaplan seems to be ·or a similar opinion, even in light of the physical damage.

Tickets for tonight's show are available for $8 for students and $12 for non-students. 
Stepan Center's doors will open at 7 p.m.

CAMPUS MINisrnY... 
. .... CoNSIDERATIONS 
An Invitation to Fourth Day 
As a Rector in a residence hall, as well as a Campus Minister, I have had many opportunities to observe students and to listen to their concerns. I am particularly intrigued by incoming first year students who are desperately trying to find their niche at this university. As I recall my own college years, I remember how important it was to "fit 
in" somewhere; to find a community with whom I could relate, socialize and share my life. The alternative to "fitting in" was, 
unhappily, being alone. Obviously, there are times when all of us want to be alone, but those should be times of our own choosing. None of us wants to be alone because we haven't quite found a way to belong. 
In their eagerness to fit in, individuals may often fall in with groups with which they are not comfortable. Ideally, we would all like to share time with those who hold the same values and beliefs; who like to participate in the same type of activities which we enjoy. However, nobody wants to spend their free time alone, so it is not uncommon to hastily join in, either formally or informally, a group with which one has very little in common. In this situation, an individual then begins to feel the pressure to do things or become involved in ways with which he or she is not comfortable. Peer groups can often be very influential on a person's actions, regardless of the beliefs that a person holds. 
There are many healthy and happy communities which exist inside of this large community which we call Notre Dame. Each residence hall is a community in itself and offers many opportunities on social, educational and spiritual levels to become involved. As a person who works in the Office of Campus Ministry, I am particularly interested in encouraging students to become involved with communities which will allow them to explore their faith. One of the wonderful things about this university is that it allows people to openly talk about being a Christian without feeling embarrassed about it. Expressing our faith is not only encouraged here ~ it is expected. 
There are various communities on campus that exist for the sole purpose of praying together and discussing issues which are relevant to the spiritual life of the members of this university. One such community calls itself the "Fourth Day." Originally organized as a follow~up for those who participated in the Notre Dame Encounter with Christ Retreat, the Fourth Day community comes together weekly in order to allow students to pray and talk together with their peers. The community invites all who are interested in this type of activity to attend. Many students are involved for the sheer enjoyment of meeting weekly with a large group of people who hold some of their same beliefs. Others come to talk about their daily struggles or to discuss questions with which they are concerned. It is a fun time for people to gather in a community of faith. It is a time to NOT be alone. 
I would like to invite you to explore various communities on campus which allow you to investigate further your own spirituality. You will certainly meet others who share your concerns and questions. You 
will find a group with whom you can "fit in." Most importantly though, you will most probably meet a few individuals whom you can begin to call friends.

Fridge activated; Zorich starts 

LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -The Chicago Bears will activate William Perry -all 315 pounds or less of him -to play against the New Orleans Saints this weekend, coach Mike Ditka said Wednesday. 
"He's moving good. He looks good," Ditka said after practice Wednesday. 
Perry, who signed a two-year contract last week, will alternate at the left and right defensive tackle slots with Chris Zorich and Steve McMichael, but will not start, Ditka said. 
"One reason we're not starting Perry is because Zorich has played very well," Ditka said. "I don't think that somebody coming back should start automatically."

Unser Jr. who he holds in high regard. 
"He's my idol because he was so young when he got into it (racing). He's got a real flam­boyant driving style and he makes big moves. He's always exciting to watch," added Buf­fomante. 
Buffomante also got an early introduction to the racing life. Buffomante's father, Anthony Sr., raced karts as his son was growing up and Buffomante used to work the crew for his dad. The elder Buffomante won the first race he ever ran in 1969 in the JACC parking lot. At that time, there was a Sports Car Club at Notre Dame and Buffomante was the vice presi­dent. 
Despite his racing success, Buffomante Sr. never pressured his son to go into racing. At age 12, Buffomante decided that he wanted to try his hand at racing. He ran his first race that year in a go-kart with a five-horsepower engine and a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour and following in the Buffomante family tradition won his first race. 
After four races, Buffomante showed enough promise to move up to a more powerful Sprint Kart and ran in the World Karting Association Na­tional Series. It was at this level that Buffomante started to at­tract attention. He won the WKA National point series three years in a row from 1987­1989 and in 1989 got the opportunity to represent the United States in races half way across the world. 
Buffomante was chosen to captain Team USA in the Kart­ing World Championships in New Zealand and helped the

The coach said Perry will see a lot of playing time and may eventually be the starter. But in any case, he added, the three 
players  will  continue  to  
alternate.  
"This  should  make  us  

stronger," Ditka said. "We did the same thing when we had Steve and Dan (Hampton) and William." 
Ditka said he is not looking forward to making player cuts on Friday. 
"There's a chance we'll keep eight defensive linemen, but at this point it's very hard to make cuts," he said. "You don't want to make cuts. But we've got to do what is best for the 4 7 people who are going to play, and try to make the team as 
team to a fifth place overall fin­ish in the three week event. 
Buffomante has logged hun­dreds of hours behind the wheel of karts and cars since becoming competitive in the sport of racing, but in an ironic twist of fate he ran into some trouble during his driver's test. 
"It was two days before Homecoming and I wanted to get my license so my sister wouldn't have to drive me to the dance. The test was on old roads and I was cutting corners like a race car driver would and I failed," said Buffomante. 
Right now, Buffomante knows where he wants to go in racing, but he also knows that he has a long way to go. Currently, Buffomante is sponsored only by Island Thunder, but competitive racing costs much more than one family can give. Most drivers have several strong as it can be." 
Ditka said he is not planning to do too much differently against New Orleans in the Superdome than he did last year, other than to help out his offensive tackles. Rookie Troy Auzenne is starting on the left side and right offensive tackle Keith Van Horne is questionable because of sore toes. 
The news about Perry will not sit well with New Orleans' coach, Jim Mora. 
"It means we'll have to double team him," Mora said in an earlier conference call from New Orleans. "That's the only way you can stop him. Perry is a great football player and he adds to an already tough Bears' defense." 
sponsors such as Valvoline and Newport who pay for tires and equipment and Buffomante is hoping a winning trip to the SCCA National Championship will attract the attention of the corporate sponsors. 
"Not having a sponsor is re­ally frustrating because the other guys have so much money. The guys with the big bucks are buying the very best motors and equipment," said Buffomante. ''I'm doing the best I can, but I always feel that I have to overdrive the car just to keep up." 
Despite the odds, Buffomante has continued to succeed in racing, but he's not satisfied. 
"I don't know if a racer is ever happy. Everytime I go out there, I want to win and if I don't it's disappointing," said Buffomante.

'COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -If you've noticed that the Bowling Green-Ohio State game isn't on the daily betting lines, it's because Bowling Green is in the Mid-American Conference. 
Tim McCarthy, a sports book supervisor for Harrah's in Reno, said the game is not listed on the latest line because the MAC is one of two conferences "not on the official rotation." 
McCarthy said games involving the MAC and Big West Conference are seldom on the list because they are not considered among the nation's preeminent major college teams. 
"There's two things at work here," said Russ Culver, sports book manager for The Mirage 
Thursday, September 1 0, 1992 
hotel and casino in Las Vegas. "First, those conferences are never on TV, so there is no coverage. Second, they don't have any stars to speak of, although Randall Cunningham came out of the Big West. With all the games on a Saturday, there's just not much interest in Mid-American Conference games." 
When MAC teams play against national powers, Culver said the games are seldom listed because they are usually "walkovers." He said Bowling Green was a good team for the MAC but was overmatched against Ohio State. 
Culver lists Bowling Green as a 14-point underdog.

Yount gets no. 3000 
MILWAUKEE (AP} ~ He broke in as an 18-year-old shortstop in 197 4 and now, 19 seasons later, Robin Yount has become a player for the ages with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Unassuming, consistent and durable, the Brewers' Rockin Robin has reached 3,000 hits, joining only 16 other major league players on one of baseball's most elite lists. All but Pete Rose, barred from baseball for betting, are in the Hall of Fame. 
Yount got No. 3,000 Wednesday night, a line single to right center off Cleveland's Jose Mesa in the seventh in­ning. 
"I've been fairly consistent and been fortunate to stay away from a major injury that kept me out of an extended period of time. The key has been consistency and health," said Yount, who's been on the disabled list only twice in his career. 
A week shy of his 37th birthday, Yount is the third­youngest player to hit the 3,000-hit milestone. Only Ty Cobb, who was 34, and Hank Aaron, who was 36 years and four months, were younger when they got their 3,000th. 
Yount. never one to like the spotlight, has played his entire career with the same small­market Brewers, joining them after only one short minor­league season. 
He is one of three major leaguers to win two Most Valuable Player Awards at dif­ferent positlons. He won as a shortstop in 1982 when the Brewers went to their only World Series. After switching to the outfield in 1985 because of shoulder problems, he won his second MVP four years later as a centerfielder, even though the Brewers were a .500 team that season. 
"The fact that I have seen how this game can take its toll, both physically and mentally, helps me appreciate the goal of 3,000 hits," said Paul Molitor, Yount's teammate since 1978. 
"It talks of consistency, ability and endurance as well as super talent, necessary to reach such a goal." 
The thought of the Milwaukee Brewers without Robin Yount is one team president Bud Selig can't bear to consider. 
Selig has had a personal hand in negotiatingcontracts with Yount, including a three-year, $9.6 million deal Yount signed after the 1989 season.

SPORTS BRIEFS 

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP} ~ Jeff Zgonina of Purdue, a semifinalisf for the Lombardi Award as the nation's top lineman, doesn't hold back when assessing his potential. 
"It was my fault I wasn't an All-American last year," said the 6-foot-2, 270-pound senior from Long Grove, Ill. "I believe I should have been an All­American last year, but I didn't play up to my ability." 
Zgonina has been moved from nose guard to tackle this year to make it more difficult for offensive linemen to thwart his charges into opposing backfields.He doesn't care where coach Jim Colletto plays him, however, when the Boilermakers open the season 
Saturday  against  No.  17  
California.  
"To  me  it doesn't make  a  

difference, as long as I'm making the plays," Zgonina said. "I've been here five years now, and I've got to show leadership. The best way is to show leadership on the field, making the big plays and firing up the team so it goes back to the huddle pumped up." 
"No matter what position I'm at, I will be an All-American this year," he said. 
"I want to win. I want to go to a bowl game. I want to be an All-American, win the Outland or Lombardi award," he added. 
"If I don't, it will be my fault. ... I want to leave me name here as someone who has turned this program around. "Zgonina compared himself to another Purdue line great, Dave Butz, who went on to star with the Washington Redskins. 
"I want to be mentioned in the same sentence as Dave Butz as one of the great linemen that have been here," Zgonina said. 
Zgonina last year had 53 solo tackles despite constant double­and triple-teaming by opponents. He has 195 after starting 33 consecutive games for Purdue. 
"I wasn't focused enough last year," Zgonina said. "Being double-teamed for the first time since I've been here that much, for the whole game, got me flustered and kind of bothered me." 
Colletta thinks a new position will help Zgonina fulfill his potential. 
"Many times he's going to be on a guy all by himself. and that guy is going to have his hands full. We did it to give him a chance to make more plays," Colletta said. 

Colletto agreed post-season honors are within Zgonina's reach. 
"I don't think he's even reached his potential as a college football player. I don't feel he's really turned loose," Colletto said. "If he does, he can really become a bigger force." 
Zgonina has created problems for his Boilermaker teammates in practice. 
"He controls everything. We try to keep him out of a lot of things and we don't get much done," Colletto said. Hopefully, he can do the same thing to Cal's offensive linemen." 
California defeated San Jose State 46-16 in coach Keith Gilbertson's debut with the Golden Bears on Saturday. 
"We have a lot of respect for him," Gilbertson said. "I think he's certainly an Outland Trophy candidate. He's a guy when you turn the film on or every time you go to the line of scrimmage, you better know where he is."

Pacers reload without The Rifleman 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -The Indiana Pacers' first trade in three years was for stability, not scoring. 
They already had enough points. The problem was finding a way to distribute them that kept everyone happy. 
"To have Detlef Schrempf, Reggie Miller and Chuck Person on the floor all the time ... there's not enough balls to go around," said Pacer president Donnie Walsh, who engineered a four-player swap with Minnesota. 
Sent packing Tuesday night were Person, a 6-foot-8 forward who was the 1987 NBA rookie of the year, and Micheal Williams, a 6-2 guard who found a home -and a starting role -with the Pacers after a two-year odyssey through the NBA. 
In return, Indiana got Pooh Richardson, a 6-1 guard who was Miller's backcourt mate for two years at UCLA and averaged more than 8 assists a game for his 3-year NBA career, and Sam Mitchell, a 6-8 forward who was the Timberwolves' all-time leading rebounder. 
"We felt we had an overabundance of offensive players and not enough players who could perform roles," Walsh said. 
That designation as a role player suits both Richardson and Mitchell. 
''I'm not Chuck; I'm not going to try to be Chuck," said Mitchell, who averaged 10.1 points a game last season. 
"I see myself as a role player, to play defense, get some rebounds. I'm not going to change my game." 
He said the trade to Indiana from a team that won only 15 games last season is a "pleasant surprise." 
"It's going to be a different feeling knowing from the jump ball you have a chance to win. 
With an expansion team you are just hoping you can win," Mitchell said at a news conference late Wednesday afternoon. 
Mitchell said the Pacers' search for a winning team chemistry means "doing whatever they have to do to win." 
"Sometimes everybody has to take a back seat. Whatever it takes-that's what we're going to do." 
Richardson, who was second in scoring for the Timberwolves last season at 16.5 points a game, said he can bring direction and leadership to the Pacers, and that being reunited with Miller "helps a great deal." 
"It will take some pressure off him knowing there is someone there who can get him the ball." 
Richardson would not speculate whether he would start for the Pacers.

Oilers' Jones returns 
HOUSTON (AP) -Defensive end Sean Jones, a major factor in the Houston Oilers' pass rush last season, "unretired" and reported to the Oilers training facility Wednesday. 
"It was just time," Jones said after arriving near the end of practice and emerging from his first team meeting. "The reasons I retired may have been a little bit premature. It's something I can always do at another time." 
Jones played last year following bitter contract negotiations and has said he remained angry the entire sea­son. He asked to be traded in the off-season and then an­nounced his retirement and missed preseason and Sunday's season opening loss to Pittsburgh. 
Jones' arrival left the Oilers with defensive end William Fuller and cornerback Cris Dishman in contract nego­tiations. Dishman and his agent met Wednesday with Oilers officials. 
Jones said a talk with coach Jack Pardee helped bring him in. 
"I have a lot of respect for him and it was a lot of the things he told me and the feel­ing he has for this organiza­tion," Jones said. "I maintained if I did come back I would put everything behind me and move forward." 
Jones played in all 16 games last season and started 11 at right end. He was tied for sixth in the AFC and led the team with 10 sacks. He was second on the team in total tackles with 60. 
Jones said he is ready to play this week against the Indianapolis Colts. 
"I've kept myself in pretty good condition so I know I can come off the ball and get after the quarterback," he said. "In terms of how much more coach Pardee wants me to be part of the game plan, that's up to them. 
"Every player feels he can roll out of bed and play, I just have to convince the guys in Indianapolis to be as cooper­ative." 
Pardee said he'd have to see Jones in practice before deciding how much to use him against the Colts.

Williams' return 
could mean big 
things for Irish 
It's official now. After rumors too numerous to count spread this past summer about the availability of Monty Williams to rejoin the Notre Dame basketball team, the University has cleared him to play. 
Anyone who remembers watching Monty play for the Irish during his freshman season, or has played against him in the Rock since then, knows what his return will mean to a Notre Dame team thin in talent. 
At six-foot-seven, Williams is tough inside and outside, and his ball­handling skills are remarkable. And despite not playing on the team the past two seasons, he will still be looked to 'for the senior leadership this year's squad will be in need of. 
The inevitable wondering will occur. Imagine how much better last season's team could have been with Williams in there. A few of those close losses would probably have gone the other way, and the Irish may have been wreaking havoc in the NCAA Tournament instead of the NIT. 
Though the Irish received bits of inspiration from junior center Jon Ross and junior forward Carl Cozen, they were not able to spell a tired LaPhonso Ellis as much as the Irish coaching staff would have wanted. 
Ellis would have been much more effective if he could have had Williams, in addition to Ross, to back him up. 
But that is all in the past. 
True Irish basketball fans will look to the upcoming season, and a team that until yesterday had a front line that looked very bleak with the absense of seniors Ellis and Keith Tower. 
Think of Williams being inserted into a lineup that will most likely consist of a core of young but experienced players like juniors Joe and Jon Ross, Cozen, Brooks Boyer, and sophomores Malik Russell, Billy Taylor, and Lamar Justice. 
Not bad for a team that lost one of the best senior class in the history of Notre Dame basketball. 
True, the Irish will be rough around the edges, but so was last year's squad with the addition of a revamped coaching staff. But by the end of the year the Irish had pulled off a myriad of stunning upsets and become the cinderellas of last year's college basketball season. 
This season the Irish will be fully adjusted to Coach John MacLeod's up­tempo offense and he will have a nice group of fresh legs to work with. 
Including a set that has been just itching to get back onto the ACC hardcourt for two long years. 
I can imagine it now... defending champ Duke falls to an inspired Irish squad at the ACC... Kentucky's Pitino helpless against the swarming Irish defense as yet another top 10 team falls ...Williams named Final Four MVPOne can always hope.

SMC volleyball opens year in Kalamazoo 
BY EILEEN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team will begin the 1992 season at the Kalamazoo College Tournament this Saturday. 
Coach Julie Schroeder-Biek, currently in her second season, is apprehensive about beginning the season with a tournament. but has confidence that the Belles will come out on top. 
"We've only had two weeks together including tryouts. However, we have more talent and depth which would make for a successful season," said Schroeder-Biek. 
The Belles possess six returners, two of whom are seniors -a recipe for great success. The ultimate goal for the volleyball team is simple: to acquire · more national attention and obtain a bid in the NCAA tournament. 
Last season, the Belles placed first in the nation in blocking percentage. Producing individual records in hitting percentage and sets achieved were senior co-captain Karen Lorton and junior Michelle Martino, respectively. 
Beginning Saturday, Schroeder-Biek would like to see the start of many more individual records. 
The team will have to defeat four of the eight teams in Saturday's confrontation in order to place in the tournament. The Belles will be facing Kalamazoo who, last year, was ranked third nationally. 
"We played them well last year," praised Coach Schroeder-Biek."This season, Kalamazoo lost many key play­ers so no one knows what to expect. 
"We're trying out a new defense this year. Hopefully, this tournament will allow us to work on it. I'm confident we'll do well." 

Guerrero starts college career off right 
BY MATT BOWER Sports Writer 
After flirting with disaster throughout the preseason, the Notre Dame women's soccer team has returned, with a new star for the future. Freshman Rosella Guerrero has stormed into the women's soccer scene, scoring 5 goals in Notre Dame's first two regular season games. 
A grim season was shaping up as four Notre Dame starters fell victim to injury. In addition to losing the three team captains: Margaret Jarc. Michelle Lodyga, and Denise Chabot, the Irish also had to play without their leading scorer, Stephanie Porter. Even Guerrero had to endure early season injuries.

Gentlemen, start your engines. 
It's the command that starts the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing" and it's the command that Notre Dame junior Tony Buffomante hopes to hear in a few years. 
Buffomante, affectionately known as "T" and now in his seventh year of racing, is rapidly moving up through the divisions and levels of racing. He is currently racing a Formula 2000 car owned by Island Thunder Motor Sports. a small racing team composed of and financed by Buffomante's family and friends. 
The team is very important to Buffomante and his racing career. 
"It's a total team effort. Everyone helps out. Everyone has a job to do," said Buffomante. "It's always 'we' because I can't go to the track by myself and be good." 
The team includes Buffomante's parents. his sister, stock car driver Mike Stahl and anyone else who comes out to watch him. His roommates in St. Ed's and friends around campus have also become fans. 
This year, Grand Island, NY native has successfully competed on the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) National circuit in the Northeast division finishing in the top five spots in five of the six races he ran. He was named the Rookie of the Year for the Northeast division for his performances. At the end of September, Buffomante will find out if his year was good enough to qualify him for the SCCA National Championship in October. 
The Formula 2000 car that he races is two steps below an Indy car that the "Big Boys" race.. With his success at the SCCA level, Buffomante sees an Indy car in his near future. 
"I want to run the next level in the next two years and get into an Indy car in the two years after that. Hopefully, I can be in an Indy car at age 23 or 24. I would like to be one of those guys who is one of the youngest to break into Indy cars," said Buffomante. 
"The 500 (Indianapolis 500) is a dream. Getting into Indy cars. everyone dreams of winning the 500. If I have four or five years experience at the Indy level, I feel that I'll be ready." 
Buffomante has already met some of the drivers on the Indy car circuit and has even raced against some of the younger ones including Scott Pruett and Paul Tracy. The 23 year old Tracy currently drives for racing magnate Roger Penske, but Buffomante has beaten him a few times. 
He has also met his racing hero, AI

"I was hurt for a week and I had to sit out of practice. I was worried that I would be out of shape for the first game," said Guerrero 
Though many critics might have written off this injury-riddled team, head coach Chris Petrucelli knew his younger players would rise to the challenge. Petrucelli decided to start five freshman and four sophomores. "I am totally confident in their ability. It doesn't matter what year they are, they are just great players," noted Petrucelli. 
Guerrero immediately took advantage of the situation to prove herself as an Irish star of the future. She scored all three Irish goals in a heartbreaking loss to fifth­ranked North Carolina State. 
Coach Petrucelli commented after the game, "I didn't know if the team could even get three goals. No one could have guessed that she would do this." 
Guerrero's stellar perfor­mance continued into Tuesday's game with Butler University. She had a hand in all three Irish goals, scoring two and assisting junior Allison Lester on the third. Petrucelli commented, "She has really filled the hole created by Stephanie Porter's injury." 
Perhaps Guerrero's most valuable attribute is her great attitude. · 
"I love my teammates. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here. They are so supportive and they are always pushing you. They all have such a positive attitude," she remarked.
