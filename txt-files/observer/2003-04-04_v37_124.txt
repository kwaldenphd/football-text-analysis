Everclear hits Notre Dame 

By JESSICA DALSING News Writer 
Everclear is scheduled to per­form at a Stepan Center concert Friday that begins at 7 :30 p.m 
Band members Art Alexakis, Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund have been entertaining audiences since their formation in 1991. Everclear is promoting its sixth CD on its current U.S. tour. 
The album, entitled "Slow Motion Daydream," shares a sim­ilar tone with their other works. In an interview with VH1 about the album, Alexis said, "All our albums are about the American Dream from different perspec­tives." 
"The recipe of punchy vocals and a strong guitar presence is what creates success for Everclear," said The Observer's Becca Saunders, who reviewed the band's most recent m. 
The Student Union Board, the programming body which is sponsoring the concert, compiles a list of possible bands to bring to campus each year based on stu­dent input and the advice of for­mer programmers. The event coordinator then tries to schedule a concert from this list each year. 
"Our radar screens are always open and when one of those bands on the list becomes avail­able, we jump," said Stephen Christ, outgoing SUB manager and programmer for the event. 
The Student Union Board works to fill student requests when planning events, but avail­ability is always an issue, said Christ. Everclear was already scheduled to be in the area for SUB contacted them for a possi­ble concert. 
The perspective of playing at. Notre Dame met with high approval from the band, said Christ. "Once we put a bid out, they were really excited about coming," he said. 
Two opening bands, Authority Zero and the Exies, will perform before Everclear takes the stage at 9:30 p.m. Tickets for the show are on sale at the LaFortune Ballroom and cost $20 for stu­dents and $25 for the general public. 
Christ expects the concert audi­ence to reach the top capacity of the 1,500-person Stepan Center. 
"There are still tickets avail­able, but we are expecting to sell out," said Christ.

Laptops stolen from student apartments 
By KATE NAGENGAST Senior Staff Writer 

An employee of Castle Point Apartments will receive a poly­graph test as part of an active investigation into the theft of two laptop computers from student apartments last month, St. Joseph County police said Wednesday. 
According to police reports, one laptop was taken March 19 from the upstairs bedroom of a Notre Dame student's apartment in Enchanted Forest. The second, a Compact Presario worth roughly $3,500, was taken from the back bedroom of a Saint Mary's stu­dent's apartment on Royal Huntsman Court March 21. There were no witnesses to either bur­glary. 
Cpl. Christian Johanson said there were no signs offorced entry at either apartment and nothing but the laptops was taken or dis­turbed. However, at the Royal Huntsman Court apartment the computer's power cord was also taken, though it was in a different room from the laptop itself. 
Other valuables, like the com­puters' wiring and printer, along with two leather jackets and a portable CD player, were left untouched, the Saint Mary's stu­dent said. 
At the Notre Dame student's 
apartment, a watch worth 
between $2,000 and $3,000 was 
left on the table beside the mis..'iing 
computer, Johanson said. 

Jar,k Goens, general manager of Castle Point, said any of hi.,;; main­tenance employees would be will­ing to submit themselves to finger­printing and polygraph tests. 
"There's nothing to hide." Goens said. "If[the students] want to pur­sue it with police we'd love it, but it's a police matter." 
Castle Point provides security at night, but any other resident pro­tection is in the hands of the police, he said. Goens also said he told both students to contact police as soon as they reported the thefts to his office. 
Detective Jerry Ratkiewicz said police are still unsure whether the male Castle Point employee who will receive the polygraph test could have been involved in either burglary, but that he will be ques­tioned about both incidents. 
According to police reports, the Saint Mary's student said her apartment was locked when she left and still locked when she returned home. Police took finger­print.'i from the living room where the computer's power cord was taken.

INSIDE COLUMN 
What side is 
God on? 
Recently, a message scrawled in yel­low chalk appeared on the sidewalk near Lafortune. "Who would Jesus bomb?" it demanded in large letters. Later that day, a 
response appeared  Clalre Kelley  
under it in blue.  
"Who would Jesus  
rape, murder, pil- Photographer  
lage and execute?"  
it countered, refer­ 

ring to the atrocious practices of Saddam Hussein. 
While these questions address the heart of the debate concerning the moral implications ofthis war in Iraq, they also address the fact that through­out history, there have been wars in which people of various religions were exhorted to go out and kill each other in the name oftheir faith. 
As many sides of the debate about the justification for this war invoke God's name, I can't help but wonder, "Whose side is God on?" 
I am especially troubled when I hear people who commit atrocious acts invoke religion, like when Osama bin Laden declared a holy war against the United States in his disturbing video or when Hussein talked about Allah in his interview with Dan Rather. But last year, Bush's reference to~ "crusade" against terrorism also worried people around the world because they thought this language meant the United States was moving toward a religious war between Christians and Muslims. 
By frequently referring to religion and God in his speeches, is Bush trying to tell the world that God is on America's side? 
In 1963, Bob Dylan addressed this issue when he wrote "With God on Our Side," a song that traces conflicts from cavalry battles against the American Indians through the Spanish-American War, the Civil War, both World vVars and Vietnam, describing how each war­ring nation believed that God was on its side. 
Dylan concludes: "If God's on our side, he'll stop the next war." 
Perhaps some in the peace movement would believe that God is on the side of those who are suffering as a result of this war in Iraq. Others who support the war for ethical reasons would say that God would want us to remove Saddam Hussein from his position of power. But does recognition of injustice mean that we also have the insight to know how God would want us to respond? 
In Mark Twain's "The War Prayer," which was published after his death, Twain gives his own interpretation of what people are really praying for when they ask God to take a side against their enemies in war. 
He imagines a prayer asking God to "help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst." 
To wage war while invoking God's name certainly raises many important questions.

iStore opening this summer 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD 
Saint Mary's Edicor 
A new addition to Saint Mary's campus will better accommodate students returning next fall for the 2003-2004 school year. 
The College's Administrative Council has recently approved The Campus iStore, scheduled to open this summer. 
Keith Fowlkes, Saint Mary's director of Information Technology, developed the iStore's business plan and design last November. 
The on-campus computer store will sell Omni Tech, Toshiba, Apple and Dell computers, stan­dard software packages, cellular phones and various accessories at · what Fowlkes said will be eco­nomical prices. 
"The iStore is primarily to serve the needs of our students and to give them the best computer equipment for their college expe­rience," Fowlkes said. 
The iStore, which is set to be located permanently in the Information Technology office, will also .be found on a mobile kiosk, which will move among various campus locations during promotions throughout the year. 
The kiosk will hold six comput-. ers, allowing students to try each and choose the hardware they prefer. 

Beginning next year, the Saint The Omni Tech machines will Mary's campus will progressively come pre-configured and ready to transfer from Dell computers to connect to the Saint Mary's net­Omni Tech. The iStore hopes to work, which will help minimize aid in that transition by selling the the time it takes for students to company's all-in-one and stan­connect to ResNet at the begin­dard mini tower computers, along ning of the year, Fowlkes said. with flat panel In addition monitors.

Jordan prince gets ND service award 
By CHRISTINA CEPERO 
News Writer 

Prince El Hassan bin Talal 
of Jordan has been 
announced as this year's 
recipient of the Notre Dame 
Award for International 
Humanitarian Service. 

This award was to be pre­
sented to Prince El Hassan at 
a cerem~py on campus April 
23. However, the event has been postponed indefinitely because the Prince is not able to travel due to the war in Iraq. 
Prince El Hassan was born 
in Amman, Jordan in 1947 
and graduated from Oxford 
University with Bachelor's 
and Master's degrees in 
Oriental Studies. In 1965, he 
began his role as the political 
advisor of his older brother 
King Hussein, who passed 
away in 1999. 

In 1987, he initiated the 
New International 
Humanitarian Order resolu­
tion under the United Nations 
and founded the Independent 
Commission on International 
Humanitarian Issues. 

The Prince has organized a systematic interfaith dia­logue, consisting of ongoing consultations with the Orthodox Centre of the Ecumenical Patriarchate at Chambesy, Switzerland; the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue at the Vatican; and the Independent Commiss,on on Christian­Muslim-Jewish Relations. 
In 1994, he founded the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies rn Jordan. In 1999, he helped found and acted as Vice Chairman of the Foundation for lnterreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue in Geneva, and he served as moderator at the World Conference on Religion and Peace in Jordan. He is also a member of the UNESCO International Interreligious Advisory Committee and Hashemite Aid and Relief Agency.

He has also participated in 
various educational and sci­
entific institutions in Jordan 
and internationally and has 
written several books over 
the past 34 years. 

A committee of several fac­
ulty and staff members meets 
periodically throughout the 
year to evaluate the 
strengths of various candi­
dates that it, or anyone in the 
University, nominates for the 
Notre Dame Award. 

The group then selects one 
to three individuals and rec­
ommends these names to 
University President Father 
Edward Malloy and the offi. 
cers of the University, who 
make the final decision. 
Prince El Hassan was the 
group's sole recommendation 
this year. 

"Prince El Hassan bin Talat 
is known worldwide for his 
intellectual and cultural lead­
ership in the Arab world and 
for his religiously grounded 
commitment to the advance­
ment of universal human 
rights. A devout son of Islam, 
he also exemplifies the 
socially engaged Muslim 
intellectual," Malloy said in a 
press release. 

The University established 
the Notre Dame Award for 
International Humanitarian 
Service in 1992 on its 150th 
anniversary as a vehicle to 
honor non-Catholics and/or 
individuals from other 
nations. 

The mission statement of the award attests that it seeks persons "within and without the Catholic Church, citizens of every nation, whose religious faith has quickened learning, whose learning has engendered deeds, and whose deeds give witness to God's kingdom among us." 
"The award has still very much a spiritual element but is not confined to people whose $piritual faith is Catholic," said University ~pokesperson Dennis Moore. 
At a time when Islam has received extensive negative press in this country, Moore Sjlid the University felt it would be apprd"priate to honor someone of the Muslim faith to exhibit the solidarity of various faiths. 
"The first factor in deter­mining candidates is the totality of.the person's career and life work, but the University was specifically looking for an exemplary person from the faith of Islam," said Moore. "Jt demonstrates the fact that there are wonderfu I ad her­ents of Islam in the world ...

The sky was still dark Sunday 
morning as the weary mem­
bers of Bravo Company assem­
bled for breakfast outside the 
chow hall. "One! Two! 
Motivated! Hoo-hah, Bravo!" 
the cadets bellowed as they fell 
in line to receive a hot meal of 
scrambled eggs, biscuits and 
gravy. 

During the day. cadets dined 
on MREs -Meals Ready to Eat · -the Army's standard com­bat-ready rations. The food included entrees such as meat­loaf with gravy, chicken and 
salsa and beef stroganoff. 

Another key activity during 
the weekend was the Field 
Leader's Reaction Course. The 
course challenged squads, typi­
cally made up of six cRdets, to 
negotiate difficult obstacles 
using critical thinking skills. 

One such scenario found 
cadets stranded behind enemy 
lines. The students had to move 
themselves and an unwieldy 
crate of ammunition over a 
large wooden platform using 
only a length of rope. The 
cadets took turns leading their squad to conquer the various challenges, then met eagerly afterwards to be evaluated by their superiors. "No more booze! No more sex! We just want F-T-X!" cadets bellowed, in a reference to the Field Training Exercise, as they assembled to discuss the results of the FLRC. 
Sunday night, cadets con­ducted land navigation drills and tests, using a map and compass to find their way through the branches and brambles in the Michigan woods. The navigation course, which lasted late into the night, tried the students' patience and stamina, as light snow fell on the chilly evening. 
The future officers also dis­cussed the nature of military conflict and the international laws governing war. Junior Leon Gil said a key element of ROT~ life at Notre Dame is the ethical aspect of military ser­vice. 
"Our cadre [officers] really do try to make us superior, not only in tactics, but morally cog­nizant as well," Gil said. The motto "God, Country. Notre Dame" was put into practice as members of the Fightin' Irish Battalion assembled for reli­
gious services on Saturday

IRAQ 
Coalition seizes Baghdad airport amid blackout 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD 

Coalition forces bombed Iraqi Air Force headquarters in cen­tral Baghdad Friday morning, one of many air assaults on the capital as U.S. ground troops pressed closer from the south. 
Blasts before dawn from the south and southwest shook buildings in the heart of the capital, and explosions grew louder and more frequent as day broke. Al-Jazeera television reported presidential palaces had been hit. 
Using satellite-guided bombs, allied troo·ps hit buildings of Air Force headquarters west of the Tigris River at about 9:45 a.m., 
U.S. Central Command said in a statement. The strike hurt Iraqi ability to control its air assets. the statement said, though com­plete damage was not yet clear. 
The attacks came after the first widespread power outage of the war plunged Baghdad into darkness Thursday night. Bombs rocked the city before the blackout, but U.S. military officials said they had not tar­geted Baghdad's power grid. The_ reason for the outage was not known. 
Explosions rang out for nearly 15 minutes before the lights went out in large parts of Baghdad, and soon it appeared the entire city had lQit electrici­ty. Less than an hour after the outage began, virtually the only sound that could be heard in the city was the noise of power gen­erators. 
A sustained power outage to the city of 5 million people would mean the disruption of water supply and sewage, which could spread disease at a time when temperatures are rising. 
The electricity went out as 
U.S. forces launched their attack on Saddam International Airport, 10 miles southwest of the city center. Anti-aircraft fire could be heard near the airport, tracer rounds raced through the sky and artillery shells exploded in the air. 
By Friday morning, the 3rd Division occupied part of the airport and had sealed the entrance closest to Baghdad. Gunshots were heard from inside, however, and it was unclear how many Iraqi troops remained there. 
On Thursday, a televised statement attributed to Saddam Hussein exhorted the Iraqi peo­ple to "fight them with your hands." 
The statement was read by Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf. Saddam hasn't delivered a speech on TV since March 24, and it is unclear when that address was recorded. 

No trace of Saddam or his Mohammed Mehdi Saleh -who "I think you have seen his pie-sons turned up Thursday when accused coalition forces of ture," Saleh said, referring to special operations forces raided breaking into Iraqi warehouses silent footage that aired a presidential palace northwest and stealing children's milk and Wednesday of a smiling Saddam of the capital. supplies -laughed when he chairing a Cabinet meeting.

RUSSIA 

Moscow promises cash to maintain space station orbit 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 
Russia pledged extra money Thursday for building the only spacecraft to ser­vice the International Space Station after U.S. shuttle flights were grounded following the Columbia disaster. 
Hussia previously said it could not fund such construction on its own. The Cabinet's decision to release $38 mil­lion ahead of schedule appeared to renect growing doubts that the United States will provide extra assistdnce. 
Aerospace Agency Director Yuri Koptev said the alternative to building more spacecraft was leaving the station temporarily unoccupied, which was dangerous be.cause the station could drift out of its proscribed orbit. 
"We need to keep th£ station [manned] so that it does not become a piece of wreckage that threatens to become the damnation of mankind," Koptev said. 
The $38 million in space funds origi­nally budgeted for the second half of the year were released early to speed up construction of extra ships. he said. 
"We will undoubtedly have to carry the main workload, having to perform additional launches and flights to the station," Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the Cabinet. "We can't postpone this decision." 
Hussian Soyuz crew capsules and 
Progress cargo ships remain the only · means of getting to the 16-nation sta­tion while the U.S. shuttle fleet is grounded pending an investigation into the Columbia catastrophe. 
The Cabinet also promised tentatively to bolster the space station's budget from about $130 million this year to about $240 million next year, Koptev said. 
Potential American funding is ham­strung by U.S. legislation barring addi­tional payments to Russia's space agency until Washington confirms Moscow has not transferred banned weapons or military technology to Iran. 
With U.S.-Russian ties cooled over the war in Iraq; a U.S. congressional waiver of the bill appeared unlikely. Some American officials also have complained that Russia failed to meet many of its obligations to service the station. 
Koptev acknowledged that the cash­strapped Russian space program failed to accomplish some of its functions on the station and that U.S. shuttles had taken up the slack. 
"Now it's coming back to us and it's hard to complain about that," he said. 
In the past, U.S. space shuttles rotat­ed the International Space Station's long-term crew. Soyuz capsules served as lifeboats for the crew and were changed every six months, while Progress ships ferried fuel, water and other supplies.

'Health E Day' set for Saturda)' 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 

Graduate students in search of free food and advice on healthy living should look no further than Stepan Center and the adjoining fields on Saturday, where the Graduate Student Union will host its second annual "Health E Day." 
Healthcare Committee chairper­son Heather Edwards said the event is designed to promote healthy lifestyles and is open to graduate students and Notre Dame faculty and staff.

SIBC to host annual forum Saturday 
By KATE DOOLEY 
News Writer 

The Student International Business Council will host its annual forum at noon Saturday in the Hesburgh 
.Auditorium. 

Steve Lauletta, sports and event marketing director of Miller Brewing Co.; Dennis 
Flannery,  executive  vice  
president  of  the  Inter­ 
American  Development  

Bank; Father John Riley, pastor of Sacred Heart Parish; and Ian Moore, exec­utive vice president of human resources for News Corporation, will be speaking at the forum. 
This ' year's topic is "Perspectives in Peace through Commerce" and panelists will discuss the perspectives in terms of their careers and the greater con­text of international busi­ness. 
Courtney Zeph, a Notre Dame sophomore and coordi­nator of the event, said that the topic was chosen partial­ly because it reflects the SIBC's motto, but also as a reflection of current events. 
"With everything that is going on in the world today, we wanted to see if peace through commerce is some­thing that holds up in diffi. cult times," Zeph said. 
Members of SIBC said the annual forum is a unique exchange between the speak­ers and the students. Daniela Urs, a junior business major at Saint -Mary's and chief operating officer of SIBC, said she appreciates the interaction _with panelists that the forum provides. 
"Its exciting to see success­ful people devote their time to us. We feel we are in the company of prestigious peo­ple, but I think the speakers take something away from us as well," Urs said. 
Last year, Dick Ebersol. chairman of NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. left a lasting impression on those at the event, said Katie Sandford, a 
Saint  Mary's  senior  and  
member  of  the  Global  
Development  division  of  
SIBC.  

"It was mind-blowing to hear a man like Dick Ebersol saying that what the SIBC does is important and that it benefits the business com­munity," she said. 
The SIBC is a student orga­nization that'prepares it members for the professional 
world. It is run much like a business and has over 250 members from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross. Members work on projects in eight different divisions, including marketing, finance. internships and global devel­opment. 
The spring forum is one of their main projects, with the goal of giving members as well as the entire student body a chance to hear from interesting, successful peo­ple. 
The forum begins at noon and lasts until 3:30. It is free and refreshments will be provided. The SIBC also gives away prizes at the event, including an X-box and DVD player.

students," Edwards said. 

This year's "Health E Day" will feature short information sessions and workshops on stress relief, nutrition and relaxation. University Health Services will be on hand to discuss prevention, along with representatives from Hoosier Healthwise, a health insurance program for Indiana children. pregnant women and low-income families. 
Edwards and the Healthcare Committee have also recruited local experts to give introductory classes in yoga, martial arts and eurogym. Games and activities will be offered for children, and lunch and free T-shirts will be available for all participants, she said. 
Last year's event, also organized by the Healthcare Committee and thenchairperson Adrienne Minerick, attracted about 50 fami­lies. 
"We're hoping to get that amount [this year] or more," Edwards said. 
"Health E Day" kicks off at noon and runs until 4 p.m. The event is sponsored by the Alumni Association and the University Counseling Center. _ "We are excited about it," Edwards said. "One of the things we really want to do in the Healthcare Committee is to inform graduate students about what's out there. This is a fun way to do that"

IN BRIEF 
Jobless claims jump in late March 
The number of American workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed last week to the highest point in nearly a year as businesses trimmed jobs in the muddled wartime economic climate. 
The Labor Department reported Thursday that new applications for jobless benefits jumped by a seasonally adjusted 38,000 to 445,000 for the week ending March 29 _ a level last reached in the week ending April 13, 2002. 
IMF warns on U.S. housing bubble 
One more threat for the fragile economy ­the possibility that America's booming hous­ing market could be headed for a bust. 
In a survey of global economic dangers, the International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that the U.S. housing market, after two years of record sales over and strong increases in home prices, could be headed for a fall. 
The study said that based on past experi­ence. a housing bubble in an industrial coun­try has a 40 percent chance of being followed by a sharp drop in prices. 
HealthSouth cuts 165 HQ workers 
HealthSouth Corp. cut 20 percent of its headquarters staff Thursday as five more executives agreed to plead guilty in a huge accounting fraud that has the health care giant teetering on bankruptcy. 
The layoffs of 165 people was HealthSouth's first mass personnel cut since the government accused it of overstating earnings by at least $1.4 billion since 1999 to make it appear the company was meeting Wall Street forecasts. 
The company said the workers were being laid off from marketing and other departments that do not deal with patients. HealthSouth eliminated about 1,000 of its 50,000 employ­ees last year. 
The refinancing rate helps determine the cost of short-term central bank credits to com­mercial banks and serves as a benchmark for other rates. The decision was widely expected after remarks by bank officials strongly sug­gested there wouldn't be another quick cut.

Becoming Catholic 


Discovering the Gift of Eucharist 
by Megan Thomas 
Junior, Lewis Hall 
This Sunday at the Basilica, eleven people will be received into the Catholic Church in the Rite of Full Communion. I am one of these eleven, and while this Sunday marks the completion of Rite ofCatholic Initiation for Adults, or RCIA for rhe, it is not the end of my spiritual journey. · 
Throughout the RCIA process, I have conie to understand the blessing of the Eucharist. Growing up in a Protestant church, that celebrated communion only as a sign of representation of Christ, has given me a different respect for the Eucharist. It is such a blessing and I can't wait to be able to share in this relationship with God. Throughout my journey I have witnessed the nourishment that comes from the Eucha­ri~, but more importantly in taking the Eucharist with us and giving it to others in all 
aspects of our lives.  Because while I haven't received the actual Eucharist, I am blessed  
every time I go to  
mass with being  I was limiting the sacrament of Communion to

Even though they  the bread and wine.  
end with receiv­ 

ing the Eucharist and I just receive a blessing from a priest, I know that I have shared in the sacrament as well. I can feel rhe nourishment. I understand that I too am called to take this blessing of Christ out into the world. 
This RCIA process has been a strengthening journey. I have never once questioned the decision I made, which is an amazing grace, but also a frustration. Ir's difficult for me to feel so called to this, but still have to wait for the Eucharist. But looking back I can see the blessing in this struggle. I was limiting the sacrament of Communion to only receiving the actual body ofChrist, when in reality it is so much more than that. I had to discover the fullness of the sacrament before I could come to understand what it means for Jesus to be completely present in the bread and wine. It seems like such a small acceptan~e on our part-we just have to believe-and we receive this gift. Not only do we receive strength, healing and love in the form of a meal, but also we get to share it with other Catholics in Communion. What a powerful challenge enveloped in an amazing gift. The challenge comes in taking the blessing and sharing it with others: becoming Christ for others. We cannot receive the Eucharist and let it end with us. This is what the nourishment of the Eucharist brings into our lives. It strengthens us to become more Christ-like in our actions and words outside of mass. 
As I prepare for this Sunday, I am excited to develop a greater understanding of the Eucharist and a closer relationship with God. The intense joy I feel as I look forward to celebrating my spirituality with family and friends is hard to put into words. RCIA has been a life-changing journey and I am humbled at the blessings I have received. It's incredible the amount of grace and love we receive in just answering "yes" to God's call in our lives. Because of a simple "yes" I will soon be Catholic.

A message for student government 
Pat Hallahan and Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl, the student body presidents for 2003-04 at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, both played key roles in previous administra­tions. But as their administrations establish their own identities, they must do more than continue the policies set in motion by their predecessors. In order for these leaders to show their commitment to students, they must produce tangible results. Students on both campuses tend to think that student government cannot help students. Now is the time to prove the OJhe critics wrong. userver other student organizations and must be undertaken with a spirit of cooperation and compromise, not one of com­petition and bruised egos. The latter only harms stu­dents, as is evidenced by the struggle between Notre Dame's Office of the Student Body President and Student Senate over the content of the Board of Trustees report. 
While seeking to fulfill their grandest campaign promis­
es, student leaders at the same time need to seiz~ oppor­tunities to implement less ambitious goals. Forming relationships of mutual respect with administrators is an essential component of

Hallahan often disagreed with former student body president Libby Bishop; he should now translate that crit­icism into action by showing the student body how stu­dent government should be run differently, while still ful­filling his campaign promises. Jablonski-Diehl may have run unopposed, but this does not excuse her from making significant changes and developing new policies. 
Hallahan and Jablonski-Diehl must concentrate on what students really want. While proposing a calendar and additional lectures are adequate, if unexciting, ideas, improving student life is one of the chief challenges fac­ing both adminstrations. Students will not become enthu­siastic or supportive of student government until they can show lofty campaign promises that directly benefit stu­dents can be achieved.

school. 
When a problem seems too difficult to tackle, this is not an excuse to avoid working for students -it merely means that the strategy must be modified. Notre Dame's student government could learn a lot by looking at Saint Mary's dedicated effort to see their read­ing day, once a seemingly insurmountable goal, become a reality. Such diligence and creativity in responding to an important student-life i~sue should be the rule rather than the exception for student governments on both cam­pus. , As they take office this spring, the incoming adminis­trations must take the initiative to pursue policies that matter to students and remain faithful to the promises they made before their election. If they succeed, they will also be able to claim a restoration of student faith in stu­dent government as one of their many achievements.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Awareness promotes understanding 
It's hard being American these days, but then again, it's always been hard. In kindergarten. I needed to give myself an English middle name because what six year-old wanted a Chinese name no one could pronounce? I chose "Victoria" -it sounded elegant enough and when I spelled out "V-I-C-T­0-R-E-A" across my penmanship pad, I didn't notice anything amiss. 
Things became slightly more com­plicated though when I moved from my all-white Catholic grade school to public school. There were black students, there were white students and then there was me. I was ill-prepared for the time a friend asked inno­cently whether 1 was black or white. After some considera­tion, I decided, by default, that I was black. 
My misjudgements now pro­vide my friends with good laughs, but the confusion that forced these situations isn't all that funny. More than 150 years after Asians first came to America to pan gold, harvest sugarcane and build railroads like every other fron­tiersmq.n, Asian Americans are still the "other" of American society. We are the citizens caught on the lower frequencies, Americans pushed to the margins. If an affinity for baseball and apple pie marks one's citizenship, I'm a good deal more American than my friends who can't dif­ferentiate the Yankees from the Red Sox. 
Instead, I am the perpetual foreigner. "Where were you 
born?" "Do you speak English?" "Can you teach me kung­
fu?" Nearly every Asian American has this checklist of 
questions filed in his or her memory. It does not matter that I am from St. Louis, that I am an English major and do not even watch kung-fu movies. Somehow we lack something more. If an Asian American became president tomorrow, he or she would be perceived as less American. Like the Japanese who were interned during World War 11, society 
questions the loyalty of Asians in a way German, Italian and Irish Americans do not worry about. No one assumes 
Americans of French descent natu­rally sympathize with Jacques Chirac. · 
Some grumble and roll their eyes at another week or month that cele­brates some ethnic/multicultural/minority group. 
The purpose is not to provide a forum for complaints nor is it unfair to have Asian Heritage \Veek instead of a British Heritage Week. Simply, this is our reality, both yours and mine. 

Asian Americans find themselves sus­pended between a black and white world without the luxury of carving out individual 
identities. As long as a name like "Long Duk Dong" makes us giggle or we secretly think some Americans should "go back to where they came from," we need an Asian Heritage Week.

Confessing sins of the past 
Thirty years ago this month. my Notre Dame class was concluding its senior year of college in anticipation of gradua­tion. It was a time similar to the present. Our classmates had marched against the Vietnam war while young Americans were brought back in caskets. The economy was flat, and most seniors felt a sense of gloom at the prospect of finding a job after gradua­tion. 
Yet, with the energy and ideal­ism typical of col­lege-aged people, we plodded ahead with our lives and let "senioritis" set into our psyches. We allowed ourselves to turn from the distractions of the real world and remain in the secure cocoon of Catholic Disneyland for one final month. For many in my graduating class. the year 2003 is our emancipation from a little-known campus statute of limitations buried deep in the Notre Dame archives. 
Few among those outside the campus hierarchy are privy to the "Thirty-year Statute" that Notre Dame imposes on its graduates. I learned of it quite by acci­dent when my public speaking professor one day ... well, actually every day ... would threaten us. He would flip us his middle finger and say. "If you give me this. I will hold back your degree for thirty years. It is a law I can impose at Notre Dame." 
To my public speaking professor and the University administration, I declare my freedom now, at the thirtieth anniversary of the sins of my past. With my degree secure, I can admit that I cut down a pine tree outside Carroll Hall and participated in commando raids through the steam tunnels into the South Dining Hall. They are acts of my youth that helped diminish the realities of life. 


As a participant in student gov­ernment, I frequently worked with the vice president for student affairs and the office staff. During my time at Notre Dame, their office was located on the first floor of LaFortune Student Center in the north wing next to where the large television now sits. The primary administrative secretary sat inside the door­way, just beyond a small waiting area. 
One Friday in early December. she mentioned in passing that she would like to place a tree in the office waiting area. I told her I'd look around to see what might be available. That weekend I found the perfect tree just outside Carroll Hall. On Sunday evening, I dressed in black and began sawing the tree when a NDSP car patrolled the area. I left the saw halfway in the trunk and dove under a larger tree while the car stopped next to "my" tree. I spent five minutes holding my breath, which seemed like five years, while the officer smoked a cigarette before he drove back to the main campus. 
On Monday morning I retrieved the cut tree from its hiding place behind a small tool shed and dragged it past Lyons Hall across the quad back to Lafortune. The 
surprised secretary decorated the tree later that day. The fol­lowing day when I stuck my head into the office, she said, "Everyone has admired the tree, 
including a police officer who said it looked very 
familiar. I told him it was a gift, so he said he wasn't 
going to fin­gerprint it and went back to his rounds. Next year. I 

think I'll get my own tree." My other transgression occurred prior to my birthday in February of my senior year. I decided to host a party in our dorm, Lyons Hall. A ROTC marine in my section, while 
exploring the campus under­ground steam tunnels, had discovered a way into the South Dining Hall, which has since been sealed. It was less than two feet square and required a person to twist in several directions around hot pipes and then drop down a three-foot step. Several of us had entered and returned through that route until some­one thought ofjust exiting through a 
window. 
The marine knew where the dining staff kept keys to refrigerated lockers and storage rooms. With precision, we executed a refund on our meal tickets for the breakfasts we never attended throughout our four years on campus by systematically moving about the dining hall and basement areas. We retrieved two large bricks of cheese, industrial sized containers of peanuts and crack­ers, a twenty-pound uncut meat, indus­trial sized cans of tuna and mayonnaise, along with paper products. Our excur­sion ended within an hour, and we only needed to buy a keg of beer for the enor­mously successful birthday bash that filled the entire third floor of Lyons Hall. 

In many ways the simplicity of life on campus in 1973 was just as pressure­filled as the complexities of life on cam­pus today. The college pranks of the 1950s paled in scope compared to those of a more militant student body of the Vietnam war generation. We in turn, are among the ghosts of campus past. While each generation faces personal, campus and global problems in its own way, his­tory will ultimately judge how well the campus, and society overall, reacted. If it were not for a statute of limitations, we alumni may not be as readily eager to share our weaknesses as examples of how young men and women of another day survived.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A call for peace among ourselves 
Over the past few weeks since the war on Iraq has been launched, I have come to notice dissent and division among many Notre Dame students on campus. There are the students who have supported this war all along and who continue to rally behind the government. On the other side, there are the students who have objected to the war and continue to take anti-war stances. Since the day the war became a reality, feelings have intensified and voices have seemed to grow loud­er and louder. 
Unfortunately. just as the voices have become stronger, the division appears to have deepened. Underneath all of the varying messages, though, I feel there exists one common hope for eternal peace. Now you may read the word "peace" and be internally bombarded with images of protes­tors and hippies or anti-war slogans and posters. But what I would like to point out today is that the word "peace" is not solely reserved for those who feel strongly against the war on Iraq. 
Peace is something greater and far more beau­tiful than what the eye can see or the hand can touch. It is a word that can represent truth and hope to every existing man or woman. Can we not all share the same dreams ofa more unified world, a world with less suffering and greater friendship among nations, a world filled with peace? 
I strongly believe that no matter what stance we as individuals take on the war, we all share many of the same goals. We can all share the hope for a quick end to this conflict, for the least possible amount of American and Iraqi casual­ties and for an establishment of peace in the Middle East. We all can come together in a spirit of confusion. hope and despair and support our troops as well as each other. 
What I have witnessed on campus is a com­
plete disregard for the commonality among 
those for and against this war. As Americans 
and Christians, I feel that now, more than ever, 
we should unite under the word "peace" and not 
draw such a distinct and fatal line between those 
with differing opinions. In the coming weeks and 
months, I will continue to be opposed to this 
war, while others will maintain an attitude of 
support. but what we need to overcome is the 
division that has been created. I believe that as 
the Notre Dame student body, we need to begin 
to break down the walls that have been con­
structed. 

Mother Teresa once said, "If we have no 
peace, it is because we have forgotten that we 
belong to each other." Her words seem strikingly 
appropriate at this time in history. for it is only 
once we have peace among ourselves that we 
can implement peace into greater society. We 
need to remember that beneath all of the dis­
cord, in our hearts we all wish for a better. more 
peaceful world. We must always remember that 
we do belong to one another. 

With all of this in mind, I would encourage 
everyone, as a community of caring and passion­
ate people, to pray together for peace. 

Everybody is welcome to come to the grotto and 
join other concerned students who meet every 
weeknight at 11 p.m. to pray in solidarity. I hope . to see you all there. Peace be with you.

Supporting the tradition ofMass 
To "save" Catholicism, the one thing that should especially not be messed with is the Mass. In his Wednesday column, Joe Muto got it all backwards. While his ideas were said jokingly, let's follow this yellow brick road and see where the wizard takes us. 
Cheerleaders, the wave and air horns at Mass are definitely off the wall. While these practices will never gain official approval, they can happen at Mass. Think I'm kidding? I wish I were. There have been Masses where the wave was actually done. Kazoos and noisemakers have been used for music. As to the Eucharist, a Protestant minister once used fruitcake and eggnog for Christmas. 
A big problem with these "advancements," besides the lack ofsancti­ty, is the effect on attendance. Sure it goes up at first-everyone likes excitement. Maybe it even lasts for a few years, but the church dies. I've seen it happen. Being from the Bible Belt, I see Protestant church­es compete to gain members. I know churches with laser light shows of the Gospel. Others let you paint the devil's face on a balloon and pop it. How exciting. 
Yet this does not keep people coming. The Protestants that are seri­ous about services last while those who cater to the masses have come and gone. These Protestants have taught me that entertainment never works. Catholic churches have tried marketing too, but attendance is not nearly what it used to be or could be. My parish recently went from drums and guitars to pipe organs and bells. It also went from one of the smallest parishes in the diocese to the largest, current weekend attendance being 7,000. Churchgoers realize what they really long for is the "meat and potatoes." Once they see entertainment does not have it, they leave. The fact is, to save the Church the best thing we can do is ket>p stained glass, orthodoxy and the Eucharist. Ifyou want to see Heaven, go to Mass. The Mass is Heaven and the book of Revelation makes that clear. Think about that next time you're in the pew.

' 
if really have control over the thoughts that 
I i come into your head, that they just appear. But what if those thoughts not only appeared but started to take on a mind of their own, having as much depth and realism as a flesh-and-blood person? How would you be able to tell the real people from those in your mind? How could you lead a normal life? More impor­tantly, if your thoughts were always with you, how would you get those voices to shut up every once in a while? 
! In Farley Hall's play "Jake's Women," : ' ' the audience takes a step into the mind of a man named Jake, a fifty-something 
writer who has begun to blend his life and his thoughts into one confusing mess. To put it bluntly, the stresses in his life have caused him to start to lose it. 
The audience is quickly drawn into his mind as they try to distinguish the differ­ence between what is real and what is not. His thoughts take the form of seven women, all characters from different parts of his life, that continuously show up to play devil's advocate, bring him comfort or give him someone to talk to when he is alone. "Time flies when you're neurotic" is not too far off from the truth. 
"Jake's Women" is a dramatic show, with the type of comedy interspersed throughout that comes from everyday life rather than one-liners or slapstick. And what can you expect? The audience is welcomed into Jake's mind at a low point in his life. Jake is a widower, and his sec­ond wife is on her way out the door for a six-month separation so that they step back and re-examine things. 
Jake clings to the memory of his deceased first wife. finds himself delving deeper and deeper into his writings and making every aspect of his life a story. Throughout the show, we actu­ally only see two "real" women, but Jake is constantly writing stories and dialogues in his mind about what the major female characters in his life would say if they were with him. 
The show itself. written by Neil Simon of "The Odd Couple" and "Lost In Yonkers" fame, is a very inter­esting look at the quirks of the human mind. Each woman in Jake's life represents a different role or rela­tionship that a man could have with a woman, including wife, daughter (who jumps back and forth between being age 12 and 21), sister, girl­friend and therapist. Each relationship is unique, as a woman is called forth into his thoughts at different times for different pur­poses. 
However, when Jake's wife leaves him, he falls into despair and begins to lose con­trol of his thoughts. The women come and go as they please in his mind. One cleverly done scene has Jake calling his real thera­pist to ask how to get rid of his imaginary therapist who won't stop harping at him about the quality of his life. The story is an interesting idea, a solid attempt at looking at the different levels of the human, not just the male, psyche. There are a few moments where Simon's script is awkward and some­what lackluster, but he balances it out with moments of genius as his grasp of Jake's dilemma really comes out. The show has its 



ups and downs with both emotion and mood; you're able to laugh at Jake's predicament almost as quickly as you can feel strong sympathy for the turmoil in his life.

audience is able to feel for the withdrawn and eccentric writer. 

The first act is a little more passive and once or twice Dolson seems to be ques­tioning the depth at which he should allow himself to fall into the character, coming out of it briefly, but then slipping right back in. However, as Jake's madness grows in the second act, so does Dolson's

process changes. They all handle the script very well. 
. Lena Caliguri does well as the prod­dmg therapist, illustrating an aspect of stream of consciousness well done in this show. As Jake talks to his therapist, his train of thought jumps about to self­pity to sex, to humor and back to self­

pity. Caliguri is well-balanced and not shaken by the jumping between parts. She and Jake's sister, played by Beth Colombo, add a level of humor to the show as both seem to enjoy twisting the screws in Jake's life, making him ques­tion his own motives and actions. 
Two highlights of the show are the perform­ances of Jake's first (now deceased) and second (now separated) wife. Devon Candura as Julie, Jake's first wife, shows well-developed, playful intimacy that displays an idealistic and wonderful idea of first love. Julie never seems to know whether she is real or not, but Devon adds breath to the character that it is easy to see why Jake has difliculty think­ing ofher as imaginary. 
Molly Topper does a fantastic job as the dual role of Maggie, Jake's wife in reality and as a figment of his imagina­tion. She is playful and witty as a solid piece of Jake's mind, but Topper also adds depth and nat­ural flow to her emotion­al charged scenes with Dolson. She offers him support as a strong lead­
ing lady, but she shows off her versatility as her part jumps in and out of reality. 
Though there are times when it may confuse, "Jake's Women" does a good job of drawing the audience into Jake's head. Farley Hall is offering this show in a relaxed setting, serving "wine" and cheese before the show. It creates a good atmosphere to sit back, relax and enjoy the fact that someone out there is cra­zier than you are.

The best of student art 
The Snite Museum displays art students' thesis projects 
By MARIA SMITH 
Scene Editor 
This Sunday, an exhibition of the sen­
ior projects of the University's graduat­
ing Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of 
Fine Arts candidates will open at the 
Snite Museum of Art. 
The BFA and MFA thesis candidates 
are one of the Snite Museum's most pop­
ular exhibits, attracting over 800 visitors 
to the awards ceremony last spring. The 
Snite Museum's display is unusual com­
pared to many university museums 
which refuse to display student art. 
"It's really unique," said Austin Collins, chair of the art department. "The Snite and the art department have an excel­lent relationship." 
This year's exhibit features a wide variety of exhibits from a larger than life representation of Jesus constructed from insulation foam and automotive body filler to an edited video of an artist danc­ing with a heartbeat as background accompaniment. Some exhibits have political messages, while others address issues such as body image, preservation of the environment and spiritual experi­ence. 
"We get a wide variety of projects, which is really good," said Gina Costa, marketing and public affairs specialist for the Snite Museum. "Each year is so different in the issues that are dealt with." 
Other featured exhibits include "Consumed by the Daily," a sculpture by MFA student Suzanne Mauro designed as a commentary on the difference between the ceremony and reality of marriage, and a sculpted grove of trees created to represent encounters with the spiritual by MFA student Phillip Shore. 
All the exhibits include written expla­nations of the artists' intended message and techniques. 
"The mindspace I enter when I dance 
is enough to show me that there is some­
thing greater to this world," said artist 
Gerry Sheahan, explaining his piece 
"Murmurs Through Time: The Eternal 
Heartbeat." 
The exhibit includes four pieces by MFA students and nine by BFA students. Students have worked on their projects over the past year, with juries for the BFA candidates in December. The proj­ects are the culmination of a three-year study program for the MFA students and a four-to five-year program for the BFA students. BFA students take an addition­al 30 credit hours in addition to the nor­mal 36 art student earn for a BA degree and some stay an extra year to finish the requirements. Around 38 of the school's 182 art majors attempt to earn a BFA degree. . 
The MFA program often leads to job placement for talented artists, including some artists such as Shore whose work is already known outside the University. 
"The graduate program horn needs to be tooted louder," said "Students do wen being placed in teaching." 
"This is a very strong show," said Collins. "It's a very professional space, and a good experience for our students to display in a museum." 
The BFAIMFA Thesis Exhibition will be open from April 6 to May 18. The open­ing reception will run from 2 to 4 p.m.. with awards presented in the Annenberg Auditorium at 3 p.m. Awards include the Walter R. Beardsley cash prize for the best work in the show. Department of Art. Art History and Design awards for exceptional papers. and College of Arts and Letters faculty teaching awards.

The Saint Mary's softball team will continue to try and reverse last season's misfor­tunate when it host sconfer­ence rival Adrian College Saturday at 1 p.m. 
The Belles played Adrian in their first conference dou­bleheader last year and lost both games, 9-1 and 5-3. Last year's 0-2 start for Saint Mary's was indicative 
of the type of season  the  
Belles would have.  
Saint  Mary's  stole  two  

extra-inning games from Kalamazoo on Wednesday to open 2-0 in the MIAA and increase its overall record to 12-6-1, 
This year, coach Anna Welsh emphasizes coming out ready to play and make a lasting impression. Welsh said she wants her team to come out firing and intimi­dating conference oppo­nents. 
"We won both games on Wednesday, but we didn't make the statement we are capable of making," Welsh said. "If we can make that kind of statement against Adrian, we'll be on our way." 

So far, the Irish have over­whelmed Big East doormats Villanova and Georgetown ­who presently are a combined 3-13 in the Big East and 13-31 overall. 
When they face the Eagles and Red Storm this weekend, which Irish head coach Paul Mainieri says is a challenge his team is ready for, it will be a true test of just how much the Irish have improved since the beginning of the season. 
SMC SOFTBALL 

Belles to host home conference opener 
The Belles certainly are capable of scoring a lot of runs. The team has only been shutout once this sea­son and has produced over five runs in nine of their games so far. Freshman Kate Sajewich and senior Susan Kutz are two reliable hitters the Belles will look to for leadership with the bats. 
Pitching is also a strong point for the Belles. Most recently, freshman Bridget Grall pitched six hitless innings against Kalamazoo Wednesday. 
Due to the cancellation of a double-header against Olivet College on Saturday, March 29, the Belles had a 10-day break between the Indianapolis tournament and their match-up with Kalamazoo on Wednesday. Now, however, Saint Mary's will see little rest as they play a fast-paced league schedule with two or three games per week. 
"We have a lot of fresh­men, so our upperclassmen will get them accustomed to playing this type of sched­ule," Welsh said.

Captain guarantees victory after Miami'wake-up call 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
After suffering a 6-1 loss to 
conference rival Miami Sunday, 
the Irish are looking to use that 
disappointing event to make the 
rest of their season successful. 
A_ team that began the season 
0-4 is now striving to go 4-0 in 
its final matches as the postsea­
son looms. That stretch begins 
Sunday when Notre Dame trav­
els to Southern Methodist in 
Dallas. 
"\\'c're going to win," junior tri-captain Matt Scott said. "I don't think we expect (just] to ·fight hard or to give them a good match -we expect to 
win." 
While the Irish struggled early in the season, their early record hides the fact that many of those matches were fairly close. 
Even against the Hurricane squad that beat them 6-1, Notre Dame had some misfor­tunes that turned the tide against their favor. Additionally, the Irish have shown they can beat top teams -. evidenced by their 5-2 defeat of Virginia Tech, another Big East foe, just a week before the Miami loss. The Hokies defeat­ed the Hurricanes 5-2 earlier in the season. 
Nevertheless, last Sunday was disappointing for the Irish. "We were really down after that match," Scott said. who 

took some of the blame for the loss. 
"I can't but feel to personally responsible for that match," he continued. "When we come off a big [win] over Virginia Tech, and then [lose] at Miami, I'm left thinking, 'What could I have done more to maybe have secured that win."' 
Perhaps the important victory over the Hokies made the Irish somewhat complacent when they dueled with the Hurricanes. 
"Maybe we were, believe it or not, a little bit overconfident," Scott said. "I don't really know, but I know that we're not going to make that same mistake twice."

of Kansas and Josh Howard 
of Wake Forest, along with 
junior Dwyane Wade of 
Marquette and sophomore . T.J. Ford of Texas. The 6-foot-9 West, a sec­
ond-team All-American last year, averaged 20.3 points and 12.0 rebounds for the Musketeers, leading them to a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. 
West, the only preseason All-American to earn the postseason honor, received 64 first-team votes and 344 points from the 72-member national media panel that selects the weekly AP Top

Michael  Phelps  defeated  an  

Olympic medalist for the second straight night and was still looking to improve. 
Phelps, the 17-year-old standout from Baltimore, won the 200-meter freestyle in Thursday's U.S. National Spring Swimming Championships. 
Phelps finished in 1 minute, 47.37 seconds, beating Klete Keller, the bronze medalist in the 400 meters at the 2000 Olympics. 
In Wednesday's 200-meter back­stroke, Phelps defeated Lenny Krayzelburg, who won three gold medals at the Sydney Olympics. 
Tom Wilkens secured his 16th national title by winning the 400­meter individual medley in 4:16.75, then compared Phelps' impact on the sport to Michael Jordan's on the NBA. 
"Michael is raising the bar, mak­ing all of the sport better." \'Vilkens said of Phelps. 
Wilkens, 27, moved into a tie with Chad Carvin for most national titles. 
Lindsay Benko, another Olympian, took first in the women's 200 freestyle. 
Kaitlin Sandeno, an Olympian, won the women's 400 individual medley in 4:45.48. 
Southern Methodist swimmers Li~a Wanberg, Laura Pomeroy, Georgina Lee and Lotta Wanberg won the women's 400 freestyle relay in 3:48.86. 
Doherty claims UNC was 
afraid players would leave 
Matt Doherty said North Carolina athletic department officials never met with him to discuss problems with his coaching style before Doherty was asked to resign as the school's basketball coach. 
"(Athletic director] Dick Baddour is a good person. I like Dick Baddour. I think it's just more the handling, the process that I'm dis­
appointed in quite frankly," Doherty said Thursday. "I didn't feel like all the options were exhausted." 
Doherty said he was told Saturday that he would have to resign or be fired by early this week. 
"The main concerns were that if I stayed players would transfer, that if I stayed they felt that players might turn pro before they would be ready to go. Like that's not an issue throughout the country any­way," Doherty said. 
Doherty said he didn't know of any players who planned to leave if he had remained. 
Kirschner said the possibility of players transferring played a role in Doherty's departure, but wasn't the main reason the coach lost his job. 
Doherty said he will continue to root for North Carolina. 
"They're going to be good next year whether you coach them or I coached them," he said.

Irish take on Canada. 
In Wednesday's game, Mexico's Desiree Flint opened the scoring in the 13th minute, but Thorlakson evened the game for the Canadians six minutes later. 
After the 1-1 halftime tie, Canada took the second half lead when Josee Belanger scored on a corner kick-head­er from Brittany Timko. The lead lasted to the final min­utes, when Mexico tied it on a penalty kick after Canada was whistled for a foul in the box. 
Canada held a large lead in shots, 19-8, but Mexican goal­keeper Pamela Alonso made 10 saves. Canada's Taryn Swiatek made two key saves on breakaways for Canada. 
Thorlakson will play for Notre Dame when the Irish face Canada.

Three opponents for Belles this weekend 
By LISA REIJULA Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team has a busy weekend ahead. 
The Belles will play three matches in two days! opening with a contest against Adrian College on the road on Saturday. After that, the team will travel to Chicago for matches with Carthage College and the University ofChicago Sunday. 
The Belles are looking to get back in the win column after a tough 5-4 loss to Kalamazoo College Tuesday. With a strong 9-2 record, the team is motivat­ed to perform well during this 
difficult stretch. 
"There will be good matches [this weekend], maybe not quite· as competitive as Kalamazoo," junior Kaitlin Cutler said. "But it seems like the whole conference has improved this year." 
First up will be a match up against Adrian, a MIAA confer­ence foe. The Bulldogs are 1-0 in conference and 5-2 overall. Adrian and Saint Mary's have faced several common oppo­nents this year. Both teams defeated Olivet and Tri-State University. Adrian lost 7-2 to Aquinas, a team the Belles shut out 9-0. · 
The Belles' first opponent in Chicago will be Carthage College, a team with a 4-1 record this season. Carthage looks to be a strong opponent, as they defeated Kalamazoo 6-3. 
"It's kind of an overwhelming weekend," said junior Kaitlin Cutler. "But we're excited to travel to Chicago." 
The host University of Chicago team has a record of 0-1 for the spring and hasn't played nearly as many matches as the Belles. 
Saint Marv's faces Adrian Saturday at 1 p.m. The Belles play matches against Carthage and University of Chicago Sunday at 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.

Despite another }ate game rally, the Notre Dame womens lacrosse team dropped a 9-6 decision at No. 8 Syracuse. The Irish competed strongly but could not do quite enough to get the win for the third straight time against a ranked opponent. 
The Irish were plagued again by a tough start as Syracuse jumped out to a 5-0 lead. 
"We just were a little tenta­tive on offense in the first half,,. Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "They are a very high­powered offensive team, so we weren't surprised they were scoring, but we just couldn't match them." 
Despite a 6-1 deficit at half­time, the Irish turned up the intensity in the second half. By the end of the game, the Irish had evened most of the statis­tics, including ground balls

res e . Finally, Tameisha King, and draw controls and outshot Syracuse 28-26, but they could not break through on the scoreboard enough to catch the Orangewomen. 
"We put a ton of pressure on them in the second half," Coyne said. "We had a lot of opportunities and came out real strong. We controlled time of possession and forced turnovers well, but we needed to score more than five goals." 
Danielle Shearer, who scored the lone Irish first half goal, scored on two free-position chances to cut the lead to 6-3 before three more Syracuse goals pushed the lead back to six. The Irish continued bat­tling as Meredith Simon scored three goals to get the Irish back within three. 
The Irish hit the post three times in the final minutes as they fire_d 22 shots in the sec­ond half. 
"We're playing very hard, and that shows a lot about our character," Coyne said. "We went all out, so it's disappoint 
Kristen Dodd, Tiffany Gunn and Kymia Love ran their best time this year, as they qualified for the NCAA Regional in the 400­meter relay at the Florida Relays. 
However, last weekend was not the only time the Irish saw their athletes qualify, as Selim Nurudeen (110-meter hurdles), Love (400 meters), Dodd (400­meters), Gunn (400-meters and 400-meter hurdles). Stacey Cowan (high jump) and Jaime Volkmer (pole vault) have all qualified for the NCAA Regional meet. 
The Irish have three more chances to qualify for the Big East and NCAA Regional meets. Saturday looks to be a great opportunity.

The Irish fell to 3-4 (2-1 in the Big East) on the season with the loss. Syracuse moved to 7 -2 ( 4-1 ) . 
Next up for the Irish is Big East foe Connecticut Saturday at the Loftus Sports Center. where the Irish will look to even its season record. 
''JJConn is a huge game for us," Coyne said. "They're hav­ing a breakthrough season. Connecticut beat Vanderbilt, a ranked win, and had a lead on Syracuse at the half. 
Despite the losses, Coyne believes her team is respond­ing well and putting them­selves in position to win. 
"We've had a lot of solid per­formances at different times. We haven't given up. We're playing hard and we've had opportunities to win. That's a positive."

One runner proposed the 10,000-:meter run be run on Friday night so the wind will be minimal. The Irish will do this in hopes of qualifying the most ath­letes possible in this event for the Big East meet.

Six golfers qualify for Indiana tournament 

By ANDY TROEGER 
Sports Wricer 
Looking to improve on an 11th place finish last year, the womens golf team will head to Bloomington for the Indiana Invitational this weekend at the Indiana University Golf Course. 
It will be the first action in about ten days for the Irish since finishing eighth at the Baylor Tapito Springs Shootout in Texas. 
With the opportunity to work on their games, the Irish have 
taken to the practice area and the Warren Golf Course to pre­pare for this weekend's event. 
"We've been doing a lot of short game work," Irish coach 

I' 
Debby King said. "We've also been qualifying [for th is event]." 
King will be taking six golfers to Bloomington, led by freshman Katie Brophy, who had .the best score for the Irish at the Baylor tournament and also won the Peggy Kirk Bell Invitational in Florida in a

Loman drove home Ciolli in the fifth to provide the third and final run. 
Throughout both games, Notre Dame pitchers worked both sides of the plate and effec­tively changed speeds to keep Loyola's hitters off balance. All 
four Irish pitchers saw work and held the Ramblers to one run on five hits. 
"I think they are getting it. We learn every day," Gumpf said. "I think there are a couple of times where we could have done something better. For the most part, the pitching staff did a great job." 
Sophomore Steffany Stenglein (5-4) worked five innings in game one and senior Jessica Sharron relieved for the final two innings. Gumpf used the same strategy in game two with freshman Heather Booth (9-5) pitching the first five and sopho­more Carrie Wisen throwing two scoreless innings of relief. 
Loyola pitcher Jenny Rice (5­
6) took both losses for the Ramblers. 
The strong continued offensive output, the good pitching and zero defensive errors are the formula the Irish strive for each and every time they take the field. 
"It's like we talk about, if we do three things well, we are going to win," Gumpf said. "We pitched well, we hit..vell and we played defense. If we do those things, we give ourselves a shot, a real good shot." 
After getting doubleheaders cancelle·d at Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech last weekend, Notre Dame is looking forward to starting their Big East sched­ule Saturday at Providence. 
"We are so excited to start Big East play," Gumpf said. "We are very excited." 
But the forecast is calling for rain and hopefully 1t won't. just like Thursday.

series of strong spring show­ings. 
Also traveling to Bloomington because of strong showings at Baylor are senior Terri Taibl and junior Shannon Byrne. After qualifying, fresh­men Sarah Bassett, Karen Lotta and Suzie Hayes will round out the Irish contingent. 
This will be one of the strongest fields the Irish have faced this season, and it is also their last preparation for the Big East Championship, which will be held at the Warren Golf Course. 
"This is one of our strongest events," King said. "There are many Big Ten teams partici­pating." 
The Irish will focus on their own goals instead of worrying about the competition. 
"We need tJ) shoot for 312 as our own personal goal," King said. "Whether it puts us in first place or last place, that's what we have to shoot for."

Irish playing without Howell 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
With starting attackman and 
lead point-man Matt Howell sidelined after having his appendix removed last Friday, · the No. 15 Notre Dame mens lacrosse team will travel to Columbus, Ohio, to take on No. 20 Ohio State (4-2, 0-0 in the GWLL) on Sunday at Jesse 
Owens Memorial Stadium. 
Howell, who leads the Irish 
with 12 goals and 19 assists, 
did not feel well last Thursday 
following practice and did not 
play in the match against 
Denver last Saturrlay. Without 
him, Notre Dame needs to step 
up their game in every area. 
"I just think we've got to do the things we need to do to put us in a position to win," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "They're a very good team in transition and in unsettled sit­uations. We have to keep them from doing what they are good at doing. We have to clear balls and identify roles at the defensive end of field." 
The Buckeyf:)s will be the Irish's second GWLL oppo­nent of the season. Notre

Dame (5-3, 1-0) won its first 
league game on Saturday, 9-8, 
at home. against unranked 
Denver. 
As with its history with Denver, Notre Dame has domi­nated in the all-time series with Ohio State. The Irish have won nine of the last 10 games between the two and Corrigan has a 12-2 all-time record against the Buckeyes. 
In a 7-3 win-at Moose Krause Stadium last season, Notre Dame broke a 3-3 half­time tie with two goals in both the third and fourth quarters to beat Ohio State and end the Buckeyes'season. 
The last time the Irish trav­eled to Columbus in 2001, Corrigan's squad got the win in a 13-4 rout. 
Still, Ohio State is ranked and will challenge the Irish just as Denver did. With Howell out of the lineup, there will be even more pressure on precocious freshman Pat Walsh (12 goals, 16 assists) and junior attackman Dan Berger (20 goals) to spread the ball around and score on offense. 
Against Denver, Walsh and Berger did just that. The freshman recorded two goals and five assists, and Berger added three goals. Still, Corrigan thinks there are other players who have not played to their full potential. 
"On the other end, we must execute offensively," Corrigan said. "We haven't had that breakout game offensively. We've got a lot of guys who haven't gotten over the hump yet, a lot of guys who haven't scored the way they're capable of scoring. But I would love to see [a breakout game] this weekend, because we've got guys working really hard to do it."

Hitting on all cylinders 

victory over Loyola (Chicago) Thursday afternoon at Ivy Fleld. 
. Irish continue solid offensive play, sweeping Loyola 7-1 and 3-0 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
It looked like it was going to rain the entire afternoon, but it didn't, and the Irish were happy, very happy. 
Building off the offensive momentum from Tuesday's doubleheader sweep at Purdue, Notre Dame defeated Loyola (Chicago) 7-1 and 3-0 Thursday at Ivy Field to extend their win streak to four games. 
"I am happy no matter what the temperature is, as long as there is no precipitation," Notre Dame coach Deanna Gumpf said. "It was great, we needed today." 
In game one, the Irish pounded out 10 hits, including five doubles and three home runs. Shortstop Andria Bledsoe hit her second home run in as many games and went a com­bined 2-for-6 with three RBIs and two runs scored. Third baseman Andrea Loman and catcher Mallorie Lenn each also knocked one out. 
"They have come alive. I think that Northwestern game hit them hard and they don't like that and don't want it to happen again," Gumpf said about the offense. "Hopefully this momentum wil1 help us on the weekend. You can't really tell what's going to happen, but I like the way we are hitting the ball." 
The Irish (14-11) jumped ·on the Ramblers in the bottom of the first when centerfielder Megan Ciolli and second base­man Alexis Madrid lead off with back-to-back doubles. Ciolli scored on Madrid's two­bagger to give the Irish the early 1-0 lead. 
Lenn put the Irish up 2-0 in the second with her first colle­giate home run. Bledsoe got her home run out in the bottom of the third and gave the Irish a 4-0 lead. 
After the Ramblers got one back in the top of the fifth, the Irish got two insurance runs in the fifth on HBI doubles from Bledsoe and freshman Kellie Middleton. Loman's homer in the sixth provided the final dif­ference. 
In game two, the Irish scored two in the bottom of the second on a triple by senior first base­man Lisa Mattison. Left fielder Liz Hartmann scored on Mattison's second career triple and Mattison came home on the errant throw to third.

Also at the Western Michigan Open, Chris Staron qualified for the regional with his effort in the high jump. Ryan Mineburg had already qualified from the Baldy Castillo meet. 
The Irish distance runners also have qualified many runners for the NCAA regional meet, includ­ing Lauren King and freshman Molly Huddle in the 1,500 meters. The tandem looks to be a huge threat nationally.

Women host international teams 
. Irish to play Mexican and Canadian National U-19 teams

Different styles of soccer will be on display this week­end as the Mexican and Canadian National under-19 teams have come to South Bend to take part in the 2003 Womens Soccer International Showcase. 
This year's Showcase is an expansion of the previous two years, when the Mexican National team had come for games against the Irish. Notre Dame has come away from both of those games with close fought wins of 2-1 in 2001 and 3-2 in 2002. Both events have attracted large crowds of over 2,000 fans. 

"The reason why we started doing this was to get some top level competition during the off-season," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said. "Monica Gonzalez was with the Mexican National team and played here at Notre Dame, and now we've expanded to include the Canadians. We have a couple Canadians on our team so we have a real good relationship with them." 
Both the Canadians and Mexicans come in with strong accomplishments. The Canadian under-19 team fin­ished second to the United States last summer at the under-19 World Cup in a game well represented by Irish players. Katie Thorlakson and Candace

Chapman played for Canada, while freshman Annie Schefeter was on the U.S. squad. The Mexicans are only one more win away from qualifying for the World Cup that will take place later this year. 
Waldrum described how the teams play very different styles of soccer. 
"Canada is athletic and physical, they are very direct. Mexico is smaller but very technical and skillful," he said. "They are creative and play a very high quality of soccer." 
For the Irish, the Showcase gives some players who missed large portions of the season because of injury, including Schefter, senior Vanessa Pruzinsky and sophomore Gudrun
