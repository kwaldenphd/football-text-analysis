Affirms college identity 
Henry outlines SMC goals 
by Ann Therese Darin Campus Editor 
Edward Henry, president-elect of St. Mary's College, detailed plans for the school's future Friday afternoon. 
While re-affirming the college's identity as a relatively small, Catholic, liberal arts college for women, he outlined eight goals for the college's im­mediate future ranging from the inclusion of more laywomen and men on the Board of Trustees to developing exchange programs with other colleges, inner-city programs, and internships. 
Addressing an all-school convocation of scarcely 100 students and faculty, the new president committed the college to: 
--implementation of tri-partite community govern­ment for communication and decision making; --expansion of off campus opportunities of exchange programs, internships, and inner-city work; --examination of curriculum, the calendar, existing and new majors; 
--active solicitation of foundation and government 
assistance, as well as alumnae financial support by the 
reconstituted development office. 
In his speech, Henry also described new efforts to expand the student body with enrollment of mature women beyond the age of normal college students and more minority students, appoint more laywomen and men with occupations as Trustees -and adopt college programs to society's needs. 
Prior to his speech, the new president confirmed he 
will name the new vice-president for academic affairs 
within the next few weeks. 
During the 45-minute talk, Henry centered his 
remarks on the concept of St. Mary's as a woman's 
college. "I believe St. Mary's College can make an 
excellent case for itself as a small liberal arts college, 
without arguing its feminine character. It is far from 
being an exclusively women's college of course," he 
asserted. "exceptthatit has not given degrees to men it 
has involved men students in its classroom. And until 
last year, in anticipation of merger, it has had 
proportionately more credits hours taken by men 
studentsattending class here than women at Notre 
Dame. Socially it also has many of theaspectsof a coed 
situation.'' 
He would not agree with N.D. Board of Trustee 
chairman Edmund Stepan's analysis that SMC will 
eventually merge with Notre Dame in two or three 
years. Commenting on Stepan's remarks made last 
week at a Universal Notre Dame Night dinner in South Bend, Henry emphasized St. Mary's must first create and strengthen a separate identity of her own before any unification proceedings would continue. 

The merger negotiation teams have not yet disbanded, the president-elect added. He hopes that they will be the basis of continued academic and ad­ministrative cooperation between the two schools. But, Henry emphasized the need for St. Mary's to maintain its feminine character. 
In exclusively women's colleges, "They (the women) are treated as equals both in the classroom and in extra-curriculars. While America is well on the road to a long delayed equality of treatment, it has not yet arrived there. In the interim, experienced educators in women's colleges express grave reser­vations about the ability of coed campuses to provide this equality. Now, where chauvinism does not surface, supercilliousness may .... One is tempted to ask, will it take a generation or two to eliminate 'tokenism"'? 
Defending his views, the new president cited several prestigious women's such as Mt. Holyoke, Chatam, Barnard, Wellesley, Wilson, and St. Benedict's which have reaffirmed intentions to restrict enrollment to women. He also quoted a 1970 study on the un­dergraduate origins of women listed in Who's Who of American Women. Graduates of women's colleges receive career recognition approximately 2.3 times more than coed graduates. 
·"There can little doubt in my mind that by their very nature women's colleges are freer than coeducational schools to seek and develop new teaching techniques, new courses, new educational and living arrangements--that are of particular value to women students," said Henry. "In such colleges women's consciousness can be maximized and women given more of a chance in a crucial formative period of their lives to free themselves from the distortions a male­oriented society has induced in many aspects of life, including education." 
However, Henry also noted St. Mary's interactions with other institutions prevents isolation, usually associated with women's campuses. "Notre Dame men will continue to attend class here and St. Mary's women there," he reassured. "Consortia relationships with still other colleges will be explored--not only for an exchange of teachers, but of students. We hope that off campus semesters at other colleges--through in­ternships, and inner-city community arrangements-­will inject a new variety of relationships with other students.

US being flooded with Secobarbital capsules 
by Dana Admas Schmidt 
(c) 1972 New York Times 
Washington, April 30--John E. Ingersoll, director of the Bureau of Narcotics and dangerous drugs, has formed a special secobarbital force to track down a "gigantic" operation in the California-Mexico border area that he says is flooding the country with the drug. 
The red and red-orange secobarbital capsules known as "California reds," have turned up as far away as Boston, Ingersoll said in an interview yesterday, but appear to originate near the border. In the last 24 months bureau and customs officials have seized seven million such capsules and the Los Angeles Police Department two million. The Mexican Police arrested two persons at Sonora four months ago carrying more than three million were diverted from legitimate sources, Ingersoll said. To tighten up on· this activity he has asked 340 domestic drug manufacturers to supply detailed information on the manufacture, distribution and use of barbiturate products by the end of May and has added 140 com­pliance investogators to his staff to check the books of pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
He said that he had also asked doctors and lawyers connected with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangersous Durgs to study the advisability of imposing controls on barbiturate distribution similar to those now applicable to nar­cotics. 
Ingersoll expressed fear that the flood of illicit "downers" would contribute to a new vogue for this type of drug as the availability of heroin decreases. Secobarbital is one of the fast-acting barbiturates whose effect can be similar to thatcapsules.

'Two thirds'is representative 
College of Science approves tenure rule 
by Michael Baum 
The so-called "two-thirds rule" of faculty tenure has been greeted with approval and cautious op­timism for the future in at least three departments of the College of Science. 
The chairmen of chemistry, physics and mathematics in statements this past week, were 
united  in  their support  of  the  
measure.  
The  three  departments  

represent a good cross-section of the college in regards to the question. Chemistry, under Prof. Jeremiah P. Freeman, is almost exactly two-thirds tenured. In addition, two men presently tenured will be resigning in the future. 
Explaining that his department had projected a plan of "an­ticipated retirements", Freeman said that the department's hiring policies had brought it, coin­cidentally, just within the suggested limit. Barring oc­casional fluctuations up and down, Freeman said, "Our departmental size has not changed greatly over a long period of time. It's working out the way it should." 
Freeman noted that one problem in predicting future hiring and tenure policies is uncertainty about the possibility of increasing faculty size. "You have to know the departmental quota and nobody knows what that is yet," he remarked. Freeman added that the last directed quota for the department of chemistry -the number that it could employ -was. figured last fall to include the projected merger with St. Mary's, and has not yet been revised. 
Freeman sees the application of the two-thirds quota as an attempt to regularize what has hitherto been an informal procedure, "I think what Fr. Burtchaell is at­tempting to do is to regularize things. He's trying to let the departments know what their boundary conditions are. Notre Dame has always been rather informal about this, and there has been a certain amount of rivalry among colleges." 
Free Lance Behavior 
Freeman noted, however, that he didn't feel publishing the guideline was a good thing, "My main objection to publishing percentages is that a young man may assume, but simple arith­metic, that he has no chance of being tenured." 
Freeman said he felt this would "encourage free-lancing behavior," causing young un­tenured faculty members to concentrate more on preparing a standing with other schools to fall back on rather than being "university-centered."
In addition, he said, he felt it 
caused "unnecessary ap­
prehension" among faculty. "I 
think the departments should be 
relied upon to make their own 
decisions," he said. 
Summing up his opinion of the future Prof. Freeman commented, ''We've never gotten ourselves in a bad position and I don't think that we will in the future." 
Another facet is visible in the 
department of physics, chaired by 
Prof. Charles Mullin. Presently, 
the department is about 81 per cent 
tenured, four over the guideline, 
and has the highest percentage 
among the major science depart­
ments. 
Prof. Mullin explained that the 
high percentage of tenured faculty 
is the result of competitive hiring 
practices over the past few years. 
"We are a department that grew 
rather rapidly over a certain time 
span and the competition to get 
and keep quality people was ex­
tremely great. Just to meet the 
competition we were forced to 
move people up very rapidly," he 
explained. · 
On the other hand, according to · Mullin, "We are fortunate to have 
a number of retirements coming 
up." By June of 1978, five men will 
have tenured 
Physics Plan 

The physics department, ac­
cording to Mullin, will present the 
requested plan to the ad­
ministration that should bring the 
department under the quota after a 
period of time. Mullin feels that 
this can be easily accomplished, 
"given sufficient" time. 
At present the department plans 
on a long term program over a 
space of ten years. Exactly how 
the ruling will affect tenuring of 
faculty is not certain, "We haven't 
faced this situation yet," said 
Mullin, "The policy is a new one, 
and it depends on how flexible the 
plan is."

GIRL HUNTERS 
The projected plan most probably will not call for a direct effort to reach the two-thirds mark according to Mullin, but may call for a slight increase in the number of tneured faculty over a short period, to be balanced by a gradual decline. 
The proposed plan, not yet detailed, was originally drafted by Prof. Mullin. It will be presented to a departmental committee and discussed through several meetings. Following full faculty approval, the final plan will be presented to the administration for approval, according to Prof. Mullin. "I would hope by June 1st," he added. 
''A lot of this has to be conjecture on my part," Mullin cautioned, "because it's hard to tell what will be the situation five years from now.'contrast, the department of mathematics, with chairman Prof. 
0. Timothy O'Meara, is tenured only to about 56 percent of its faculty. With one professor retiring this year, the mathematics department will be 5 short of the two-thirds line. 
Before Burtchaell 
Prof. O'Mea'ra explained that the department has made a point of following a similar rule for some time, "I think the two-thirds rule is a very good idea. We were trying to do it ourselves before Fr. Burt­chaell appeared on the scene. It's the only way to keep fresh young blood in the department," he said. 
The situation in the mathematics 
department is affected by the 
department's policy of awarding 
"visiting assistant professor­
ships." 
These "visiting" positions are filled by six or seven doctoral students at Notre Dame, to sup­plement the regular assistant

Hesburgh questions population cr1s1s 
A deeper crisis over values and priorities lies beneath the widespread concern with over­population, according to Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, CSC, the president of the University of Notre Dame. 
In an article appearing in a special supplement in Sunday's New York Times, sponsored by the Population Crisis Committee, Washington, DC, Fr. Hesburgh said the question of human dignity "is becoming lost in the discussion of population growth." 
The priest-educator said, "If population growth is viewed alone as the one great crisis, then we will descend to all kinds of pragmatic and immoral initiatives. One of themosblatant of these is abortion as a means of population control .. . As a priest, I have known of nothing that so shatters a woman, psychologcally and morally, as the destruction of_ human life within

Fr. Hesburgh called upon af­fluent nations to aid un­derdeveloped countries in which rapid population growth has prevented gains in food, housing education health services and income. "The United States, with 6 percent of the world's population, annually uses 40 percent of the world's energy," he noted. The United States gives "a mere one billion" to foreign aid, he added, while "two-thirds of the rest of the world lives. on less than $200 a year." 


He also said Catholics are as interested as any group in solving population problems, and he called upon his co-religionists to support basic research into the biochemistry of human procreation in order to make available birth control means "which will pass any moral, theological or cultural test."

As they worked and relaxed, the Apollo 16 astronauts -Capt. John Young of the Navy; Col. Charles Duke of the Air Force and Lt. Cmdr. Thomas K. Mattingly of the Navy -were regaining some of the weight they had lest inspace. · 
And like other astronauts, they temporarily experienced the peculiar sensation that their clothing and bodies were heavier than they actually were -a reversal of the weightless phenomena of space. 
The astronauts were un­conscious of the way their bodies silently and painlessly reset reflexes tht were not called upon space and readjusted their physiologic homeostatic mechanisms to 1-G, Dr. Charles Berry, director of Life Sciences for the space agency, said in nn in­terview.

In Henry's estimation, these t changes will make the education department one of the most progressive departments in the 
Midwest. 
"Internships, field observation, 

living experiences off-campus, 
directed independent studies, use 
of para-professionals as staff 
members, student research--all 
must be experimented with 
judiciously." Henry explained. 
"Structure and mechanics, must 
not be allowed tc get in the way of 
learning. We will constantly seek 
to find new ways of doing old things 
better while experimenting open­
mindedly with the novel. Both 
accelerated education and 
stopouts should be looked at. Early 
admission and experience credits 
will not be dismissed unilaterally." 
He anticipates St. Mary's will 

adapt the 4:1:4 calendar system 
which allows students and faculty 
study tour or internship ex­

periences during semester break 
for credit. Since this change must 
depend on reduced faculty and 
students hours per semester, it will 
not be used this year. Although no 
building expension is presently 

contracte, Henry said that a new 
library will probably have priority. 
Explaining the advantages of 

maintaining St. Mary's as a small 
college, Henry stressed the 
decentralization and per­
sonalization of St. Mary's to 
achieve a senseof community 
lacking in large universities. 
Henry enumerated the benefits of 
small colleges as: 
"personalizing their relationship 

with students; responding to 
changing needs of students in a 
.. 


very large way, necessarily bureaucratic structures, cannot; effecting a sense of community in a way that large colleges find dif­ficult to achieve; and maneuvering in terms of self-survival, ex­perimentation, innovation, in a way that large institutions cannot be." 
While not increasing in size, St. Mary's will also not lose students. Henry reported that September's freshman class has 450 students and is continuing to grow. Although he did not have statistics on upper classes, he could not discern a substantial loss of those students either. 
"Small colleges are capable of great productivity, but probably a relatively small proportion of them really achieve it. St. Mary's has undeniably been among this handful. I believe small size to be an important contributor to per­sonal emotional stability and security." 
Henry did not answer questions from the audience after his speech. He felt most of the queries would involve specific problems with registration which either Dr. William Hickey, special assistant to the president, or department chairmen could answer. 
Saturday he addressed the spring meeting of the Parent's Council, before returning to Minnesota.
