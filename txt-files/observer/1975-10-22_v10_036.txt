Troops foiled in attempt to rescue I.R.A. hostage 
MONASTEREVIN, Ireland (APl -Heavily armed troops and police tried to rescue a Dutch industrialist from his kidnapers by storming a house in this sleepy market town Tuesday. But the abductors held authorities at bay by threatening to "blow his head off," police said. 
"All communications we've had to date indicate they're not about to surrender," a police spokesman said. 
The kidnapers, believed to be lrish Republican Army guer­rillas Eddie Gallagher and Marion Coyle, seized Tiede Herrema 18 days ago, demand­ing that the Irish government release three other IRA mem­bers from jail. They repeated those demands Tuesday. 
A squad of troopers smashed down the front door of the two­story house 40 miles west of Dublin and police officers led by Supt. John Fleming of Dub­lin's special branch force charged in, a police spokesman said. 
The kidnapers Hred five shots at the assault group but no one was hit, police reported. The assault team did not fire back. 
The kidnapers retreated to an upstairs bedroom holding a gun to Herrema 's head. 
A short while later, a man who appeared to be the 26-year­old Gallagher shoved Herrema up to a wmdow of the house and jammed a pistol against his head and yelled: "He's a dead man if you try anything!" 
Police officers at the scene 
said Gallagher later shouted 
that he had tied explosives to 
himself and would blow up the 
house if security forces tried to 
rescue the 53-year-old Her­
rema. 
"We're negotiating with the kidnapers for Herrema's re­lease, but it's very touchy," a police spokesman reported. 
He said Gallagher is sticking to the demands he made when Herrema, managing director of the Dutch-owned Ferenka Steel

Irish government has refused 
all along to free the trio and 
showed no sign Tuesday of 
backing down. 

The Irish cabinet held an 
emergency meeting, but issued 
no statement. However, govern­
ment sources reported: "There 
is no change from our policy of 
making no deals with these 
people." 

At least 300 armed officers 
ringed the house. Fleming and 
his squad occupied the ground 
floor and police and army 
marksmen moved into first­
floor rooms in neighboring 
houses. Two armored cars were 
behind the house.

CCUM offers Xmas course 
by Mary Mungovan 
Staff Reporter 

Interested students can visit social action centers in major American cities and receive course credit, Father Tom Stella, director of Volunteer Svices, an­nounced. 
The Undergraduate Committee for Theology and Religious Sudies will offer the one-credit course "Religion and the Urban Ex­perience" over Christmas break in cooperation with the Catholic Committee on Urban Ministry (CCUMl. 
''The purpose of this course is to expose students to the problems and the people of the city and put them in contact with those dedicated to solving them," Stella explained. 
Groups of four to six students will "live-in" for a 48-hour period with CCUM members in the parish or secular organization they are observing. No prerequisites are necessary, but student will be required to keep a journal and at­tend briefing sessons before and after break. Students can visit centers in Pittsburgh, Houston, Washington D.C., Chicago, New York, Boston, San Francisco and others. 
CCUM, founded in 1967 by chairman Monsignor John J.

· Egan, is holding a national con­ference in campus starting Sun­day. "While the members are already here for the conference," Stella stated, "Students taking the course will be able to meet and make arrangements with the members they'll be visiting." 
CCUM is a national network of over 3,000 rpiests, brothers, sisters and laity working on prisons, housing programs, drug clinics, hospitsls, legislatures, inner-cities, and various school and community projects.

At a news conference after the announcement, Bayh said he foresaw no problem unifying a factionalized Democratic par­ty that now has nine announced presidential candidates but no clear front-runner. 
"As I travel around this country, I find people who were for Humphrey, McGovern and Wallace," he said. "They're all out of work and they want a new president. 
"Coming from a state like In­diana, as large as it is and as diverse as it is, I think I have an excellent understanding of what America is all about." 
The Hoosier setting for the long-expected announcement made before a contingent of th~ nation's top political reporters, was a showcase for Bayh's Midwestern background and his success as a liberal in a con­servative state. 
Bayh grew up in Shirkieville, a strip-mining and farming community of about 40 persons two miles from the Illinois state line. The town prepared a huge reception, including road si'gns scattered along the 10­mile. route the Bayh caravan took from Terre Haute.

Broader counseling services now available 
by Sut <'arey Staff Hl'porter 

In its offices on the fourth floor of the Administration Building, the Notre Dame Counseling Center offers educational-vocational and personal-social guidance for in­dividuals and groups. 
''WP're relevant to everybody, not just people with problems," asserted Dr. Sheridan McCabe, Director of the center. "A lot of people think about counseling in a nanow way. We tend to do that." 
McCabe noted counseling used to assunw that someone had a problem, and then attempt ot remedy it. The Notre Dame center. on the other hand, is primarily concerned with problem prevention and personality development. "We work with our 
· clients to make them more ef­fective in general, and to help them keep from having problems," McCabe explained. The Counseling Center also serves as a source of training and consultation. "Often an R.A. comes in asking for advice on how to deal with the people living in his section." McCabe observed. "Most of the H.A. seminars have also asked us to give a class presentation." · About half of the students who 

contact the Counseling Center want help for educational or vocational problems. "As a faculty member I have observed a Jot more academic pressure this year than in the past," McCabe 
affirmed.  "It  is  usually  self­ 
imposed.  though,  and  comes  
primarily  from  the  present  

economic conditions." 
McCabe noted less academic pressure when he first came to Notre Dame in the late 1960's. "In those days, the thing was ac­tivism." he observed. "We have come a long way from that. I still hear some social justice concerns txpressed. but academics are the big concern now.''

Pomerleau spoke of church and 
state relations in the past. "In the 
1920's," he said, "the church was a 
fused entity. Her institutional 
identity was with the government. 
The Church could not move any 
resources because it is under state 
control." He said that in order for 
one to he a citizen of Chile, he must 
have been a Catholic. 
"But in 1925," he continued, 
"there was a separation of church 
and state. By 1964, the 
church moves in with the govern­
menl. In fact, the .church becomes 
a means of dialogue of the 
Christian Democrat Party." 
According to Pomerleau, as the 
Church separated, it developed as 
an institution to help the poor· "In 
1973, the.govern~e~t destroyed the 
labor umon t~ ehmmate part of the 
lower class,' he added. 
Economics in Chilt' Today 
Professor Jameson discussed 
the problems in the Chilean 
economy today. "There are 
several problems in the economy 
of Chile,'' he remarked. "The 
country must figure out how to get 
investment to accumulate, what to 
do with its image amongst other 
nations, what to do with wage 
goods with income distribution, 
and finally what to do with the elite 
structure." 
Jameson said Chile is striving 
for a "social economy market" --a 
return to the free market. 
Jameson related the poicies of 
thi:; change to the free market 
system. "It emphasizes free 
foreign exchange, a removal of 
price controls, wages being set by 
the market. moving the govern­
ment out of control, and making 
harsh decisions by letting wage goods go up in price," he said. 
However. Jameson listed 
problems to this change. Hecon­
tended that inflation has dropped, 
unemployment has risen to a rate 
of approximately 20 percent, goods 
cannot be returned to the private 
sector of the economy, and there 
exist difficulties with their 
foreign loan renewals. 
"Will these problems continue?" 
he asked. "Yes and no. The ques­
tion is how long will it last. If it 
succeeds, with the present policies, 
the question is will the system 
work,'' he concluded. 
investigators have been unable to determine who ordered the destruction of a threatening note which Lee Harvey Oswald

of it. 
McCabe noted fewer Freshmen seek help from the Counseling Center than do upperclassmen, not because they have fewer academic problems, b,ut because the Fresh­man Year of Studies has such a large staff itself. 
The Center attracts more premed majors than any others, according to McCabe. "But they're usually here to examine career options, rather than because of academic pressures," he said. 
A large part of the counseling center's work is with personal and social problems. "Actually Pverything we do here has a bearing on the social aspect," McCabe declared, noting that one of the most beneficial aspects of the center's workshops is the chance for social interaction. 
"We don't have many op­portunities on this campus for communication. particularly 'between men and women, without commitment," McCabe asserted. 
In past years the Counseling Center has run Male-Female Communications workshops, but these programs have failed to attract wide interest. "The groups themselves were very effective, but getting people, particularly women. to join them was very difficult," McCabe asserted. 
The center has abandoned these workshops, but McCabe expressed 
, ihope that informal discussion 
· groups, such as one organized last year by Grace, r.reen-Phillips and fo'arley Halls, ~.light allow for greater communication. The counselors have worked with faculty members and teaching assistants in the past, dealing with such topics as strategies for improving classroom discussions. 
The Counseling Center deals with many more students now than it did even five years ago, according to McCabe. "We don't have more actual clients, but we cantact more students through our OUTREACH program of workshops and group presen­tations." he explained. '"I wouldn't suggest that our business is up because there are more problems, 
but rather because we are better 
known now and we have expanded 
out programs." 
Presently in its ninth year, the 
Counseling Center is planning to 
continue many of its programs 
from previous years. 
Assertive Training Workshops teach people to stand up for their I'jghts, without being aggressive. "Students tend to be docile," McCabe asserted. "We're acting on the principle that good. creative citizenship requires a certain amount of assertiveness." 
Life-Planning Workshops are another important branch of the c1nter's activities. Several hour­long sessions give people the op­portunity to explore with each other their personal values and talents. "These are not job­oriented, but live-oriented. The participants learn to develop a short and long-range plan of how they are going to live," McCabe explained. 
Anxiety Management Training Programs are designed to help recognize and cope with the aspects of the environment which cause anxiety, according to McCabe. A specific Test Anxiety Program offers techniques . for preparing' and taking exams. 
A new addition this year is a project for people returning from the Sophomore Year Abroad Program. "We will explore what it is like to try to fit back into Notre 
Dame1, and to translate the year's 
l'Xperiences into cognitive lear­
ning," McCabe observed. 
The Counseling Center's dealings are always held in strict confidence. "Whatever we do is regarded with a great deal of respect for confidentiality," McCabe asserted, explaining that the center's records can be released only by written request of the student himself. 
From client feedback. and the 
counselors' own observations of 
progress, McCabe feels that the 
center is very effective. "Our 
overall feedback has been very 
good,'' he noted. "Unlike most 
businesses, if our customers come 
back. we aren't being very suc­
cessful."

In the true spirit of newspaper reporting, I have found the an­Wednesday, October 22, 1975: 
swer. 

Saturday night, when the wind was howling and the rain was drizzling in through the holes in my window pane, I must~red up all my investigative courage and slowly crept up the statrs to the fourteenth floor. The sound of my footsteps echoed in the hallway, and I shivered in the cold. Those echoes were like lonely voices, telling me to turn back, and I almost did. Suddenly, at the top of the stairs, I heard voices, and noticed that the door was ajar. 
I walked slowly up the stairs, and with one last prayer to St. Jude, I opened the door. 
The sight that met my eyes was ghostly. The room was immense, and old curtains decorated with dust hung over the windows. In the darkness, I perceived a number of wooden tables and chairs on a dingy rug. The whole atmosphere was eerie and frightening. 
What immediately caught my attention, though, was that the entire room was lit by only one small light bulb, and very dim at that. 
Around this light stood four upperclassmen all wearing Notre Dame buttons, jackets, sweaters, and hats. In the background, playing very softly on a beat-up old phonograph, was the Notre Dame fight song. 
I began to move closer when a voice behind me said harshly "Alright, you, go to the end of the line like the rest of them." 
Using my wits for the first time in my entire life, I quickly said "I'm the new man here to relieve the Security guard." He looked at me suspiciously and said "Okay then, you'll do." 
I breathed a sigh of relief, inwardly thanking God. 
He then led me over to the men standing around that dim light. While we were walking, he whispered "This is the brainwashing center of Notre Dame." I looked at him in disbelief, and he con­tinued "We of Notre Dame feel that every freshman should be ingrained with certain ideals and generalizations that represent the viewpoints of everyone. Someday, these young people will be alumni, less than miraculous coaching

ND to host alcohol conference 
by Eileen O'Grady Staff Heporter 
Notre Dame will be the site for a nationwide collegiate conference twld on the prevention of alcohol abuse, entitled "University 50 Plus 
12: A Fresh Look at the Old Sauce." 
The conference will be attended by the largest university from each state plus thirty private and minority schools. Each school will be represented by both a student and faculty or adminsitrative ptrson It will be held Nov. 21, 22, and 23 at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The National Clearing House of Alcohol Information is sponsoring the conference. Diana Merten, the Notre Dame chairman explained tht fo<.·us and purpose of the Con­ference. 
"They are trying to help colleges develop programs to prevent alcohol abuse. Abusive drinking is not just a personal problem; it is a community problem," Merten stated. 
"On college campuses, this can be seen with the high cost of damages done by people who come back from a beer blast and tear off a door or stick their fist through a wall," she added. 

"By working with these prople," she continued, "I've learned that the biggest part of drinking is where you drink, with whom you drink and why you drink. If you're drinking in a nice environment with good friends, then you're not going to tend to have drinking problem. On the other had, if you drink by yourself with not type of social interaction, there is a higher tendency to develop problems," 
Merten said. 
According to Merten, the con­ference will consist of a student panel discussion , various speakers, the handing out of the conference manual and the sub­sequent break down into workshops looking into the dif­ferent areas, of the manual. 
Merten served on the editorial board of the ma.nual over the summer. The booklet consists of­strategies and programs to be used to prevent alcohol abuse on college campuses. It includes various projects that schools have developed to enhance the socialization of alcohol. The "Quickie" bus service and Senior Club are projects explained from Notre Dame. 
HPC to award Rockne Trophy 
h)· 1\lartha Fanning Staff Ht}lorttr 
The first presentaton of the ltockne Trophy, initiated this year by the Hall President's Council, will be awarded this weekend, announced HPC Chairman Elton . Johnson last night after a meeting i11 Cavanaugh. 
The purpose of the award is to Pncourage hall activities. At the Pnd of each month each hall will submit an activities sheet to the II PC to be evaluated by the Rockne <'omm ittee. Possible criteria for Pvaluation was presented to the council by Johnson for discussion and approval. 
Dissussion on the cirteria cent­Pred on how the importance of a hall activity should be determined. The original propsal emphasized projects geared toward the entire Nll-SMC' communitv. 
Kathy Grace, Breen-Phillips president, pointed out that some halls may have more pCtivities geart>d toward dormitory residents. "My hall is trying to organize activities to get students who stay in on Saturdays out of th­eir rooms," she commented. 
Patty Sheehan, Walsh president added, "There are some activities that Walsh has that we would hesitate to include on an activities sheet since they are geared to Walsh residents." 
A decision to equate the im­portance of the two types of ac­tivities was reached and approved hv the council. Dan Buckley, Morrissey president, commented "The number of people that attend an activity should not be important in the committee decision." He pointed out that some activities are designed for different people to satisfy varied interests and therefore would appeal to smaller groups. 
The approved criteria that will be presented to the judgment committee, include: 
Number of Activities: serving as an indicator of an active hall government and sufficient student­resident participation; 
Scope of Activities: equal 
importance to be assigned to any 
activity whether it is geared 
toward dorm residents or the ND­
SMC community:

United fund success spurs second auction 
b)' Brigid Hafrerty Starr Heporter 
Due to successful sales, Tuesday evening's United Way Fund Auction at St. Mary's dining hall will be be continued tonight, ac­cording to Cathy Coyne, chair­person of the event. 
Under the auctioneering of Dr. Mark Bambenek, chemistry in­structor, students donated ap­proximately $400 to the United Way cause. Some of the sales included a pair of blue jeans. presented as "St. Mary's official uniform", for $10.25, a used Notre Dame football helmet, which sold for $31.75, and a luncheon for two with Dr. William Hickey, which added $25. For $18, one student received the privilege of having her room cleaned by Sr. Elena Malits, chairman of St. Mary's Religion Department. 
"I was happy with the response from the students," said Coyne. "It was so lively. They were all interested in the cause. It was so much fun for them to watch other kids bidding. A group of kids got together with $23 and went around to collect money to bid for a cheesecake made by Dr. Bam­banek 's wife, which eventually went for $37," she added. 

The highlight of the auction was the bidding for a motorcycle ride with Dr. Robert Borengasser, of the Business Department, who appeared at the dining hall in a helmet and offered to escort the highest bidder to Baskin-Robbins for a sundae, and return safely to campus. This went for $23. 
"People got really excited about that. The interest just grew more and more as they saw other people bidding for it," Coyne said. 
The money raised by the annual 
auction, in its third year at St. Mary's, counts strictly as a student contribution toward the goal of $5500 established for the total SMC community by the St. Joseph County United Way. "Instead of going door-to door to collect money, we wanted to make an event out of this," continued Coyne. "An auction seems to be the most effective and fun way." 
Coyne wishes to thank Dr. Bambenek for his time, as well as the students who helped in the project and solicited merchandise from the Michiana area.

"Hopefully, from the con­ference, people will get some ideas and go back to their schools and develop their own programs," Merten explained. 
"This is in no way a prohibitionist movement," Merten stresses. "The people running the seminar are in no way against the use of alcohol. In fact, they think drinking can enhance ·social situations. They even include in the manual a section on how to use alcohol in different ways, such as cooking and things like that," she said. 
At a meeting Monday night with Keith Hewitt, a representative from the National Clearing House of Alcohol Information, explained to student government and student union members what the con­ference entails. 
Along with the rest of the agt>nda, there also will be several talks on campus on abusive drinking for the general public. He indicated the need for housing the visiting members of the con­ference. Anyone interested in putting up one of the students for tht> weekend should call John Lonsberg at 287-8571 or contact him at the student government office <7668). 
Ed Byrne, Student Body president, speaks highly of the conference. "I'm really looking forward to having all of these representatives from the different state university systems. Many of them have shown a commitment to using alcohol responsibly. I'm all for drinking and so are the people coming in here. But the conference will show there is a 1right way and 'wrong way to drink," he said. 
The Notre Dame student repre­sentative to the eonference will be junior Debbie Kenny. A psychology major, Kenny originally became interested in fhe program because of its relation to behavior. She now has definite goals in mind for the Notre Dame commumty. "What we want to set up is parties that are not just alcohol oriented. There should be more offered at a party than just drinking for drinking's sake. Drinking can be an asset to 
sot·ializing," she said. She cites the armory as an example. "Prior to this year, the 
point of the armory was just toget bombed. W{ want to get away from that," Kt>nny said.

Total renewal plan for theater given 
b)· Thomas J. Conaty Starr Heporter 

A renovation presentation of Washington Hall has been given to the Administration but final plans and adequate funds are not yet available, according to produc­tions advisor Professor Reginald 
Bain. 
Inadequate wiring for stage lighting and spotlights in the auditorium led to the halting of theatre presentations in the 
auditorium. The wiring is now safe, 
but classes, films and speeches are 
the only events that now take place 
in the old theater hall. 
Professor Bain thought the ent­ire building may have to be renovated. "The theater in the hall is old and needs to be updated," says Bain, "and maybe this will bring about a definite decsiion t renovate the entire building." "We need to take a real look at the building, and do more to it than just make it adequate." 
Bain thought the seating in the 
hall could even use repairs. 
May be televised 
The matter of repair is now 
under strong consideration but the estimates of the amount or when the renovation could be expected could not be given, due to the need of funds not yet allocated. The only estimate give for repairs was in 
the excess of $30,000. 
Because of the discontinuation of 
the use of the stage for theatrica.I 
productions, performances have 
been chseduled in O'Laughlin 
Auditorium at St. Mry's and 
Stepan Center on the ND campus. 
A recent performance, INDIANS,

according to som~ students, dif­
fered from that of Washington 
Hall. "The play was very good but I had a hard time hearing everything that was said," Fred Rodgers, aND senior, commented. "The building is old and not 
designed for what it was beingused 
for." added Bain. "Many changes 
must be made. For example, 
the seating could be improved to 
have better sight and hearing for 
productions." 




USC pep rally scheduled 
b~· Lonnie Luna Staff Heporter 

The 1975 USC pep rally will be held on Friday at 7:00p.m. on the field between the Memorial Library and the Towers. 
Two years ago when the Irish beat USC, 23-14. the pep rally was 
held  at  the  basketball  courts  at  
Stepan.  
"The  biggest problem  in  1973  

was crowd control--getting the speakers and the band in and out," said Paul Reis, pep rally chair­man. The pep rally has been in the plarwing stages for over a month, Heis added. 
A mobile stage was obtained from South Bend. This year, the band. football players will sec­tioned off from the crowd. 
Conflicts at the ACC and preparations for the Homecoming Dance in Stepan Center moved the pep rally to the field. "If there is inclement weather, 
have no choice but to go I ' with it " said Reis. In 1973, ABC televised the pep rally but whether they will this year is up to them, he added. 
A main speaker has not been obtained but one is anticipated, Heis said. Burgemeier, Wujciak and coaches Kelly and Kuhlman will also speak, he added. 
Because of the organization of the pep rally, Security will be using a normal pep rally force, explained Arthur Pears, chief of Security. 

Pitt club collects 
The Pitt Club and the Junior Class officers will collect money for the Pittsburgh trip this weekend. All students who signed­up for the trip must pay the balance due at this time. Money will be collected on Sunday, Oct. :!6, at 6:30 p.m. in the LaFortune Amphitheatre. Game tickets will be distributed to everyone who has made a reservation and who has paid in full. 
"The Kroger chain stores in the 

South Bend area ranked in the six 
lowest priced stores," said Pat 
Burke, survey co-ordinator of 
InPIRG's Notre Dame chapter. 
Burke added that the Thrif-T 

Mart chain stores rank ir the 
second six stores having the lowest 
prices. . 
"Kroger's prices are lower than most stores and they alsays have good discounts," said Rick Casas, an off-campus student shopper. 
Kroger's strong showing is the 

result of its price leadership in 
fresh vegetables and meats and 
poultry, the survey revealed. 
"Kroger does have lower prices,

"Kroger does have lower prices,

SMC tunnels have curlew 
by Liz Mernll Staff Heportt>r 

Early last week, the SMC security force announced that the tunnels connecting several dorms and classroom buildings would be locked at 11 ::~o every night. 
For girls who have been visiting friends in another dorm or using the lab facilities and swimming pool located in Regina Hall,thiswill mean a walk to their rooms alone at late hours. \The tunnels will remain open during inclement weather. l 
According to Mr. Anthony Kovatch, director of security at SMC, "There is no need for the tunnels to remain open any later than the designated hour." 
This has not always geen the policy. It is just in recent weeks that security has felt it necessary to close the tunnels as a safety precaution against the influx of outsiders appearing on campus. 
"My main objective in closing the tunnels at 11:30 and during week-end parietal hours," Kovatch says. "is simply to keep outsiders out. Undesirables, coming on to the campus from the surrounding areas including Mishawaka, Goshen, Elkhart, St. Joes's and the local high schools, have been on the increase due to the movies, concerts, and other special ac­tivities at SMC. The Friday night coffee-house brings in a lot of 'townies', too,'' he explained. 
Kovatch says these people " ... have absolutely no business wandering around the campus, let alone through the tunnel system. It isn't hard for them to get into the tunnels and from there into the dorms unescorted. It's happened before. We want to keep it to a minimum." 
Kovatch elaborated on a new telephone system recently inst­alled throughout the tunnels. "All you have to do is pick up the receiver and it automatically rings in security headquarters.

Measures to counter scalping explained 
continued from page 1 against him. Faccenda said, "and the University is taking steps to find out." 
Athletic Ticket Manager Mike Busick explained the steps his office takes to prevent any type of scalping situation. Busick called the job in his office as "plugging up the loopholes." The color and pictures used on the reserved seat tickets are changed periodically. The color on the student tickets is l'hanged each year. The format of all tickets, including emergency and duplicate tickets is also

O'Connor stated that much of the technology involved was not l'omplicated, and said that "you l'an do it yourself." He also said that it was probably better to do it yourself, as "the commercial market is not always the best place to go." 
After Completing his slide presentation, O'Connor finished on a note of conservation of energy saying "We should save energy and keep the lights off, but after a while it gets impersonal." 
Several members of the audience responded, listing the inflated price of gasoline and the new awareness of waste of energy, and the avoiding of that waste, a'> I he two major effects of the energy erisis. 
Cashman pointed out that both of these were not very serious effects. 
"We're not hurting very much," lw said. "One reason is that this l'ountry is very fat. We have more goods and serv ices than anywhere elso in the world." 
lie pointed to America's energy 
intensive way of life, with 
processed foods, synthetic fibers, 
and electric appliances, as one 
major example of how affluent the 
nation is. He referred, among 
other things, to electric waxed­
paper cutters as and illustration of 
the extent of the American mania 
for electric appliances. 
Cashman stated the energy 
lTisis was really not a crisis, but 
that it could develop very quickly 
into one and "pull the rug out from 
under us" by toppling the 
Pconomy through a lack of fuel and 
synthetic products made from oil. 
With this preface, Cashman 
began the major portion of his 
presentation, which also included a 
slide program showing how wind 
power is used at the New Alchemy 
Institute. 
Cashman showed a number of 
windmill designs used at the In­
stitute's farm near Woods Hole, 
Mass. All were made of either low-
l'ost or salvaged materials. He 
said that the designs were said. "It will always occur where demand is greater than supply," he continued. Busick also em­phasized that the tickets anyone buys from a scalper may, in fact, be stolen. 
Busick felt that people have to stop meeting the scalper's unreasonable demands if the issue is to fade away. "People con­stantly complain to my office about it," Busick said. "Recently I got a four page letter from an ND grad complaining about the high prices he paid somebody for tickets. What gets me, is that he paid the price anyway." I only have 59,075 tickets for each game; when they're gone, they're gone, Busick said. 
"Rarely, if ever, are tickets returned for any game. If they are, they usually only show up about Friday afternoon." 
Some of the students surveyed indicated that they would not make any firm commitment to any person selling tickets for this weekend's game in the hopes that the prices would come down. 
changed often. Even the ap­plications for the tickets is changed on a regular basis ac­cording to Busick. "Our office 
does  everything  it  can  to  make  
sure  that there is only  one way  
possible  for  admission  to  each  

game," Busick said. Just this year Busick's office stopped its "will call policy", which allowed certain persons to pick up their tickets at Busick's office the day of the game. 
He also emphasized the fact that football ticket is not broken down on the tuition bill any more than the linens used on the student's bed," Busick explained. 

Busick praised the stadium personel for the job they have done regarding crowd control and security. "Much of the job depends on them and their ef­ficiency," Busick said, "one break in this chain and our problems would snowball." 
"Scalping is fostered as long as people are willing to pay the higher price the scalper asks," Busick

The Irish Eye 
:=:=::;=:===========~=====================~=========================================:;=:===~=.College vs. pro 
It is a week such as this one on the campus of NotreDamethat should reaffirm the belief that college football is just about the most exciting entertainment around. 
The whole aura of the college game makes this so-not just the game itself.lt's the pep rallies, the alumni parties, the tailgateparties etc., that give college football its attractiveness and which makes it so enjoyable. 
But as far as the game goes, college football is still far more ent­ertaining, especially compared to professional football. Pro-style play has become dull, routine and repettive. Its patterned offenses, zone defenses and reliance on field goals take the thrill and excitement out of the game. True, the pros execute better and make fewer mistakes, but collegiate offenses, the wishbone, the veer, the l,the wing T and the wild, zany often funny errors that arise out of them give college ball a good deal of its attraction. 
In the latest NCAAnewsletter, several sportswriters gave their opinion on the college-pro comparison. 
Joe Falls, Detroit Free Press: I couldn't believe that such things really existed in life -that you could get up on a Saturday morning ... get in the car and drive though the glorious countryside and then watch a game that was utterly exhiliarating. After almost 25 years here, I stil.l. get my biggest kick out of toing to a college game on a Saturday afternoon. 
Dave Hicks, Phoenix Arizona Republic:Comparedto college football, the pro game is highly sophisticated. Compared to college football, the pro game is a monumental bore. 
Dave Condon, Chicago Tribune: College football players aren't asking for pensions ... or for yearly salaries that representmore money than many working men earn in a decade. They're just playing football ... an? the public is beginning to appreciate it. I agree...that college football IS en­joying its finest hour." 
Paul Attner, Washington Post: Pro football is a bore. It's as predictable as George Allen's next quote and as exciting as on~ of Howard_Cosell's profundities. It's even more overrated as an Amencan attra~t10n than Evel Knievel. For pure enjoyment give me college football anytime. 
Notre Dame coach Dan Devine has experiencedboth and he certainly doesn't have to think long to make his decision. 
"I feel very strongly that college football is more exciting," he said. "At Green Bay we had great rivalries with the Vikings and the Bears, but it'sJiothing compared to, say the Air Force game last week. The pros try to simulate a college game. They hire a band and bring in cheerleaders and everything, but they're justthere onthe~idelines, they haveno stake in it." 
"I'm sure there's nothing comparable to a Notre Dame-USC weekend," he added. This week lbould. bear that out. 
wiJaL can be expected form dif­ferent formations and different plays. 
Notre Dame's scouting report is primarily a defensive one. That is, it is aimed at stopping the op­ponent's offense. This report is possible since most teams stay wi­th one basic offense. 
The Irish don't concentrate on scouting the opponent's defense since most colleges run a number of different defenses, making it impractical to put in report form. 
·'The idea of the thing is to allow vou to concentrate on certain things ihat your opponent has shown a tendency to use." said Greg Blache. head JV football coach who also serves as a scout. 
The report is is aimed at two areas. First it wants to prevent the big play and second it wantsto force the opponent away from its strength. By stopping the big play, the opponent is forced to drive for their scores. "When a team is forced to drive, they have to run more plays and naturallythere is a greater chance that they'll make a mistake," Blache said. "Besides, any team that can drive to a score on you probably deserves it and it's less demoralizing." 
By concentrating on the op­ponent's strength, it is hoped that theywill be forced away from their game plan. "The idea is to make your opponent beat you left­handed." Blache said. Notre Dame doesn't worry about teams ch­anging their style of play. "A team might try and surprise us, and it might work once. But in doing so, they're leaving their strong suit and it'll hurt them in the

by Mike Towle 

Even though two of their top runners did not figure in the scoring, the Notre Dame cross eountry was able to finish a respectable fourth out of 15 teams in the Wisconsin Invitational on Saturday. 
Captain Jim Hurt was unable to perform to the best of his ability because of a lingering hip injury. l\1t-anwhile. freshman teammate Dt-nnis Vanderkraats could not make the trip because of sickness. 
Bruce Fisher of the University of Chicago Track Club topped the field of 121 runners with a time of 
23:56 over the five miles. Wisconsin teammates. Mark Johnson and Steve Lacy, were second and third respectively in leading the Badgers to the team title over Southwest Michigan. 
The first Irish finisher was Steve Welch in eighth place with a time of 24:56. He was followed by Jim Reinhart, 16th; Joe Yates, 23rd; Dan Horgan, 45th; and Jay Miranda, 46th. Notre Dame's next meet is this Friday at Purdue in the Indiana Intercollegiate State meet.

Club Sports Summary 
The Notre Dame Rugby "A" Club was beaten by Ohio_ University this past Saturday, 17-3. The Irish "B" team fought to a 6-6 tie. 
The "A" game was closer than its score would indicate, with both sides having an equal number of opportunities. The backbone of the Ohio team was their excellent kicker who turned back many Irish thrusts and generally, controlled the tempo of the game. Chet Zwalick scored the three Notre Dame points on a penalty kick. The "A" team's record is now 2-2. 
The "B" game was very competitive, with neither side being able to maintain any noticeable advantage. The Irish came up with a last minute rush, but time ran out and the game ended in a 6-6 deadlock. Eric Snider made two kicks for the 6 Notre Dame points. The "B" team's record is now 2-0-2. 
The Rugby Club's next match is this Friday evening at 8 on Cartier Field against Michigan State. 
********** 
The Notre Dame soccer team suffered two heartbreaking losses 
this week. On Saturday they were beaten 3-Q by Central Michigan 
and were defeated 2-0 by Grace College yesterday. 
Despite being on the verge of scoring in both games, the Irish 
failed to kmake the big play. Still they demonstrated outstanding 
hustle and spirit. 

********** 
The Notre Dame varsity Men's Crew, coxswained by Jose Santiago, lost by a length to Detroit Boat Club last weekend. The junior varsity, also coxswained by Santiago, lost by a half-length. Notre Dame's 4-man crew; Ed Tagge, Bill Landyute, Dave Robinson and Bill Tracy, raced against the Senior Elite Four Crew that won the nationals this year, losing by two lengths. Considering the competition, coach Bill Godfrey was pleased with the Crew's performance. The Men's Crew will travel toBoston this weekend to compete in the "Head of the Charles" Regatta. 
********** 
The Women's Golf team completed its fall season by beating Franklin College Saturday. In a dual meet, Captain Barb Breesmen and Leslie Barnes won the meet in match play. Due to the inclement weather, the meet was cut down to nine holes, but was actually won by Barnes and Breesmen on the sixth hole. Brees men was already 4 up with only 3 holes to play. Barnes and her opponent were tied going into the 6th hole, but because of the weather they decided to end on the sixth hole also. The team will resume its season next spring. 
********** 
Notre Dame's Women's Crew coxswained by Rose Gill, lost to Wisconsin by less than two lengths, or 11 seconds, last weedend. Later Notre Dame's same varsity crew beat Wisconsin's second varsity by 2112 lengths or 16 seconds. 
Notre Dame varsity normally competes as a lightweight crew, but Wisconsin does not have a lightweight crew. "We were out­sized," said Women's captain, Mary Fitzsimons. The Women's Crew will travel this weekend to Boston to compete with 44 teams in the "Head of the Charles," the world's largest regatta.
