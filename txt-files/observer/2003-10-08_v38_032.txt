In an cll'ort to increase male participation in its retreat pro­grams. the Notre Dame Office of Campus Ministry will spon­sor a "Man's Weekend" begin­ning Friday afternoon. The pro­gram, which will be held at a Congregation of Holy Cross property in LaPorte, Ind. is designed for men who dislike the "touchy-feely approach of many retreats," said Father Kevin Husseau, who coordi­nates retreats for Campus Ministry, 
Russeau said that weekend retreats, like the Freshman Hetreats. Sophomore Road Trips and Notre Dame Encounters. have been more popular among female stu­dents. 
"I realized that it was a lot easier to recruit women," he said. "There were three women to each man on some retreats."

Pope appoints 31 cardinals earlier than expected 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Writer 
Fueling already-circulating speculations about his declin­ing health, Pope John Paul II, 83, surprised the Catholic community Sept. 29 when he appointed 31 new cardinals -the group that will choose his successor-months earli­er than originally expected. 
Last Sunday's announce­ment came three weeks in advance of the week-long Vatican celebrations of the pope's 25th anniversary, which will now coincide with the consistory ceremony in which the new cardinals are installed. While Vatican offi­cials gave no specific expla­nation for ~he consistory's earlier date, which is set for Oct. 21, two Notre Dame experts on Vatican issues said they believe the announce­ment reflected a combination of John Paul Il's poor health, his intention to ensure his continued legacy and his eagerness to make these cele­brations special. 
"I think he knows he is coming to the end of his life, and he wanted to reward cer­tain bishops for their loyalty and service," said Father Richard McBrien, professor of theology and Crowley-O'Brien Chairman of Theology at Notre Dame. "At the same

time, perhaps [he wanted] to ensure that his successor ... will carry on his program. Combining the 25th anniver­sary celebration, the beatifi­cation of Mother Teresa on the 19th, and the consistory of new cardinals simply makes it more convenient for cardinals visiting Rome for these closely scheduled events."

Themed nights at Legends result in mixed opinions 
By TERESA FRALISH Assistant News Editor 
Students heading to Legends this weekend expecting to hear their favorite radio songs may lind a surprise they didn't expect. 
Over the past two weeks, man­agers and DJs at Legends have instituted a schedule of theme nights that involves playing a cer­tain type of music on "heavy rota­tion" for one night, said Jonathan Jorissen, program manager for Legends. 
According to Jorissen, Legends will play Top 40 music on Thursday nights, hip-hop on Fridays and salsa or reggae on Saturdays. 
However, some students are upset the nightclub will mostly play songs that they may not have ever heard before. 
Anthony Albert said he disliked the sudden changes in music styles, as when DJs insert a block of songs of a dillcrent genre than the one being played on a given night. 
"!The Latin music! killed my dancing mood," said Anthony

Other students said that the nightclub might see a drop in attendance if students choose other weekend dance options besides Legends.

professor of theology, agreed that all of these factors should be taken into consid­eration when interpreting the pope's decision. 
"I suspect that it was pri­marily for health reasons," he said. "Secondarily, he may have wanted to do something dramatic on the eve of these papacy celebrations." 
Pope John Paulll's selection of new cardinals revealed his willingness to extend his con­servative influence, as well as his goal to increase aware­ness of the Catholic presence in countries where Muslim­Christian tensions are high. 
"The new cardinals fit the profile of the kind of people he's traditionally chosen: doc­trinally orthodox but socially conscious," Cunningham said.

Books and Butt Shorts 
The soothing, tinkling classical music. The gentle, subdued lighting. The rows and rows of Irish butt shorts, which come in more colors than a bag of M&M's and are just as much ofa guilty pleasure. 
The sensual over­load that is this shopper's high is mostly elusive on campus-no bou­tiques line the Bubble. So when that insatiable itch hits, we flock to the consumer's paradise that is the Hammes Notre Dame bookstore: a not-quite-Barnes and Noble with everything from keychains to Kant, shot glasses to Scripture. 
Its title is innocently misleading. Yes, there are books for sale, a fact that most of us whine about at least four times a year when we shell out $80 for a text­book we will likely open twice, and then are dismayed when we get a buyback price of$15. But all concerns about books are forgotten and all remaining bitterness is forgiven when we consider the real attraction-Notre Dame apparel. 
Few things in this world scream ''I'm classy! I conform! I'm connected!" as well as a Notre Dame hooded sweat­shirt. I'm not talking about the annoy­ingly Easter-eggish new arrival of pastel pink, or the snobbish superiority con­veyed by the phrase "Notre Dame Engineering" imposingly splashed across gray cotton. You know the one I mean -always gray, hunter green, or navy blue with an interlocking ND or cursive "Irish" -simple, traditional and yet almost as satisfying to put on as it is to utter those magical words, "put it on my student charge." 
A Notre Dame apparel craving is as real as that of any other drug -it strikes quickly, tugs strongly and can only be subdued with a good hit. And like any addiction, it only gets worse every time you appease it. My own story started off innocently enough last year, with a Return to Glory shirt and a bean­bag bear. Soon it was hoodies. And san­dals. And a sweatshirt skirt. And anoth­er bear. Before I knew it, I was spiraling into spending class time thinking about how incomplete my life would be with­out one of those fascinating Play Uke a Champion Today coffee mugs. 
I fear that it'll just get worse when I graduate. I can see myself as part of the swarm of alumni that descends on the bookstore on every home game week­end, straining to reestablish ties to my alma mater with just one more T-shirt of a silhouetted leprechaun. I will be that mom who dresses her kids in little foot­ball jerseys. I've even accepted that my addiction will probably be with me when I'm 80 and I actually like the pas­tel-clearly, once it gets in your blood­stream, Notre Dame apparel sticks .with you for life. 
And the best part is, Notre Dame knows it. Champion and Russell Athletic certainly know it. The bookstore is irre­sistible, and they're smart for taking full advantage. That said, I think I'll wear the baby blue butt shorts today.

Pope Duarte tells 'Cinderella story' 
By NICOLE ZOOK News Writer 
Stella Pope Duarte lit the stage at Saint Mary's Carroll Auditorium Tuesday night -lit­erally. 
In keeping with the theme of her talk. "Tending the Flame: Writing Through Hevelation and Self-Knowledge," the award-win­ning author lifted the ban on can­dles at Saint Mary's lor one night. 
"This flame, this light preceded prayer at home," Pope Duarte said. "I love to encourage people to tend who they are. Tend your flame." 
Pope Duarte encouraged and entertained an audience of roughly 70 with stories, quotes from famous authors, and read­ings from her two major works, "Fragile Night" and "Let Their Spirits Dance." 
She stressed the importance of self-discovery. 
"I come from this modern world. I come from Ia Sonorita barrio, but also this ancient world, and I also come from an Irish background," she said. "I come from many worlds. And those of you who are writing, you need to understand your world. The more worlds you have. the more you can give to your char­acters." 
Pope Duarte was active and energetic onstage, bringing not only candles, but a whole table of props. including a binder of pic­tures and an apron her mother wore. She donned the robe and acted out her stories, encourag-

ing the audience to wear items that empowered them. 
She challenged her listeners in other ways, urging them to take risks, leave their stories for their children, and never give up. 
"Stay with your manuscripts when you want to quit. Your work is like a marriage. You write for better, for worse, and sometimes until death do you part. Writing is a relationship. If you're faithful to that relationship, it will be faithful to you," she said. 
Pope Duarte is a self-described Cinderella story. She did not intend writing to be her main career, and began as a grief and loss counselor. She said she start­ed writing only after her father came to her in a dream. and chal­lenged students to follow their own dreams. 
"Dreams are sacred ground. Nobody can touch you in your dreams," she said. 
Many audience members agreed. 
"She catches our attention," said senior Rocio Estrada. "Especially now that we're young, we need somebody outgoing to speak to us. These are inspira­tiona! words for writers, and not just from our professors." 
The lecture was co-sponsored by the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership as part of the 2003-04 Diversity Series.

Winning econ paper focuses on poor 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame assistant profes­sor James Sullivan's disserta­tion, which recently co-won the annual Upjohn Institute for Employment Research contest, focuses on the financial behav­ior of low-income households in the United States. Sullivan com­pleted the dissertation at Northwestern University while pursuing a doctoral degree. 
Sullivan, an assistant profes­sor of economics, submitted a summary of his dissertation to the Upjohn Institute over the summer and was asked to send the complete paper for the sec­ond round. He learned last week that his dissertation co­won the award along with Rucker Johnson of the University of Michigan. 
"It's always nice to have your work recognized," he said. "I think the most exciting aspect is the company I'm with. The peo­ple who have won this in the past have gone on to do imp.;es­sive work." 
Sullivan's dissertation, which consists of four chapters, focus­es on the consumption, saving and borrowing behavior of poor households in the U.S. 
The frrst chapter explores the access such households have to unsecured credit markets and whether they can cushion 

income variations. including 
those resulting from unemploy­
ment. Sullivan concludes that 
such a resource is frequently 
not available to those who need 
it most. forcing the poor to curb 
expenditures instead. 

"It [utilizing unsecured credit 
markets) sounds good, but 
when you look at the data, the 
most disadvantaged households 
don't have access to the credit 
you would want," he said. 
"When unemployment insur­
ance runs out, they essentially 
have to reduce consumption." . The second chapter analyzes 
the rate of savings among poor 
households and suggests that 
the requirements of public 
transfer programs. specifically 
those involving transportation, 
may hinder the ability of the 
poor to build up savings. 

The final two chapters 
explore the most effective 
means of measuring the mate­
rial wellbeing of the poor ­

whether by rate of consumption 
or household income -and 
how recent policy changes in 
tax and welfare have altered 
their material well-being. 

"You want to think of a means 
of measuring the well-being of 
the poor," he said. "Do you look 
at the resources they have or 
the expenditures they make?"

Davis conc~des race to Schwarzenegger 
'Terminator' star is now California's chief executive 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES Californians banished Gov. Gray Davis just 11 months into his second term and overwhelmingly elected action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace him Tuesday a Hollywood ending to one of the most extraordinary political melodramas in the nation's history. 
Voters traded a career Democratic politician who became one of the state's most despised chief execu­tives for a moderate Republican megastar who had never before run for office. Davis became the first California governor pried from office and only the second nationwide to be recalled. 
"Tonight, the voters did decide it's time for some­one else to serve, and I accept their judgment," Davis said in conceding. He pledged to work for a smooth transition.

IN BRIEF 
Do-not-call list made legal 
DENVEH -A federal appeals court on Tuesday cleared away a hurdle that has kept the government from fully cracking down on tclcmarketers who contact people on the national do-not-call list. 
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tem­porarily blocked a lower court order barring the Federal Trade Commission from enforcing the registry of more than 50 million numbers. 
The court questioned the conclusions of U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham of Denver, who said the list violates the telemarketing industry's free-speech rights by barring calls from businesses but not charities. 
"The Supreme Court has held that there is undoubtedly a substantial governmental interest in the prevention of abusive and coer­cive sales practices," the appeals court said. 
The court also noted Congress had found some telemarketing calls "subjected con­sumers to substantial fraud, deception and abuse." 
FTC Chairman Timothy Muris called the rul­ing a victory for American consumers and said his agency will return to enforcing the list. 
Coke whistleblower is paid 
ATLANTA -The Coca-Cola Co. has agreed to pay $540,000 to a former finance manager to settle a whistleblower lawsuit that led to a criminal investigation of fraud allegations at the world's largest beverage maker. 
Matthew Whitley sued for wrongful termi­nation in state and federal court in May. The suit accused Coke of rigging a marketing test three years ago to inflate the popularity of Frozen Coke at Burger King restaurants in Virginia. 
In a joint statement Tuesday, Coke and Whitley said they had settled their disputes. 
Whitley has agreed to dismiss his com­plaints against the company and each of the individuals named. The company has agreed to pay him $100,000, the severance benefits he was to receive from being laid off. about $140,000, and $300,000 for legal fees. 
Whitley and Coke said both would continue to cooperate in the federal investigations of the company. 


Fonner Tyco CEO's trial begins 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK Prosecutors accused L. Dennis Kozlowski and another executive Tuesday of raiding Tyco International to pay for lavish homes and decadent parties, while defense lawyers said the pair deserved every dollar they got. 
The former Tyco CEO and Mark Swartz, the com­pany's former chief finan­cial officer, are accused of stealing $600 million and lying about it in a case that came to symbolize execu­tive excess, down to a $6,000 shower curtain. 
According to prosecutor Kenneth Chalifoux, they "didn't win the jackpot, they stole it." 
Chalifoux said the crimes came despite the duo's handsome salaries. In 2000, Kozlowski earned $106 million in pay and Swartz $54 million. 
Kozlowski, 56, and Swartz, 45, face larceny charges, enterprise cor­ruption -a charge usually aimed at organized crime figures -and lesser offenses that include filing false business records and conspiracy.

Hollyw-ood big shots talk 111ovies 
Guber and Bart promise laughs on new "Sunday Morning Shootout" 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Peter Guber and Peter Bart want you to under­stand: Their new talk show is called "Sunday Morning Shootout." Not "Shoutout." 
Guber, a legendary film produc­er, and Bart, the editor-in-chief of Variety, are dueling co-hosts on "Shootout," which premieres on AMC this Sunday at 11 a.m. EDT. 
"We're going to discuss and argue about some of the key issues that involve the entertain­ment business, particularly movies," says Bart, who last year collaborated with Guber on "Shoot Out," a book about the entertainment industry. "We have been friends for an alarming number of years and we enjoy our feisty exchanges, so maybe other people will, too." 
Set in a Hollywood coffee shop where big shots can be found on a Sunday morning (but, oddly enough, not on their cell phones), each "Shootout" will feature a guest -a star, filmmaker or other insider (first up: Edward Norton). There'll be some gossip, maybe a little news. 
But no Tell Me About Your New Film And Let's Show A Oip. 
"And no reviews," Bart promis­es. "No thumbs-up or thumbs­down. Thumbs will be inactive." 
At the same time, look for trig­ger fingers to get twitchy (figura­tively speaking). In the movie­world parlance of Bart and Guber, "shootout" refers to a cre­ative clash; conflict in the service of collaboration; a demonstration of power and the willingness to use it, even if a shot is never fired. 
"Shootout," says Guber, "will mean something, rather than just two guys on 'The Best Damn Sports Show' screaming about whether Kobe Bryant is guilty." 
Of course, it usually means something when Guber or Bart opens his ·mouth. That's a given with power players of their mag­nitude. 
At 61, Guber has headed stu­dios and been an independent producer since the 1970s, with credits including "The Deep," "Midnight Express," "Rain Man," "Batman" and "Gorillas in the Mist." 
After a rollicking term running Sony Pictures with Jon Peters (an escapade in excess that cost Sony tens of millions), Guber in 1995 formed Mandalay Entertainment, whose films have included "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Donnie Brasco." 
Editor since 1989 of Variety, the so-called "show business Bible," Bart, now 71, wrote for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. Then he took a 20-year detour as a studio executive, helping develop such films as "The Godfather," "Harold and Maude," "Rosemary's Baby" and "Being There." 
"We have been in the business many years," Bart declares. "And yet we're not two old guys sitting around saying, 'Things were bet­ter in 1970 than they are now" ­because in many cases they weren't." 
"We have a completely different view on most things," adds Guber, insisting, "It's not necessarily just to create drama or conflict on the show. We actually believe differ­ently!" 
"For instance," says Bart, eye­ing Guber's garb, "I would never wear a shirt that says 'Prada' on it." 
"But there's a reason," grins Guber, whose casual togs strike a contrast to Bart's Saville Row nattiness. "He told me not to wear it. I said, 'Now that I found something you don't like, I'm going to be really active in its pursuit."' 
Their differences don't end with their apparel. "I am volatile, emo­tional," Guber says. "He speaks firmly, quietly, deeply, thoughtful­
..

!y. 
"But I know that he's danger­ous," Guber continues, grinning again as he gestures at Bart. "You have an argument with him, and you leave the table and then you drop dead five blocks away and you don't know why. Me, I pick up a fork and stab you right in the heart while you're sitting here." 
Could be great TV. But Guber makes movies, as well as arguing about them. Isn't he worried that, on public display every week, his candid style might rub the wrong person the wrong way? 
"The reality is, if I have a proj­ect that somebody wants to do and they hate me, but the script's really good, they'll do it," he replies. 
But don't mistake defiance for fearlessness. 
''I'm at a place in my career where I still have fear, but I'm not fear-filled," he explains. "When I was in my 20s, I thought the world would come crashing to an end if everybody didn't love me. When I was in my 30s, I realized that nobody loved me. And now, I don't care if they love or they hate me, as long as they do the work." 
"That's probably including his wife and children," jokes Bart, referring to Lynda, Guber's wife of 38 years, and their four kids. 
"Probably does include them," Guber fires back with a laugh. 



Judge orders man to stop stalking Spears 
Associated Press 
SANTA MONICA -A judge ordered a Japanese business­man to stay away from pop idol Britney Spears, ruling Tuesday 
he  was  "was  abnormally  
obsessed  and  fixated  with  
Spears."  

"It was an obvious pattern of harassment and emotional harm done to a person of notoriety," Superior Court Judge Alan Haber said in issuing the perma­nent injunction. 
Spears, 21, first sought a restraining order against Masahiko Shizawa in December 2002, alleging that he "tracked and attempted to contact" her at her home in Los Angeles, as well as at her second home and one of her parent's homes, which are both outside California. He also allegedly sent photos of himself and notes reading, ''I'm chasing you." 
Shizawa, whose visa expired, has been back in his native Yokohama, Japan, since last December. 
The judge said the evidence showed that Shizawa was men­tally "off." 
Shizawa's lawyer, Simon Robert Hiller, said his client was a law-abiding citizen. 
"He was in love," he said. 
The injunction calls for Shizawa to stay 300 yards away from Spears for three years. 


FCC: Bono didn't violate decency rules 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -When it comes to cursing, the govern­ment says, it's all in the deliv­ery. 
That's the view of the Federal Communications Commission in its decision that U2 singer Bono's colorful language during the Golden Globe Awards didn't violate federal indecency rules. 
The FCC rejected complaints from the Parents Television Council and more than 200 people, most of them associated with the council, who accused dozens of television stations of violating restrictions on obscene broadcasts by airing portions of the awards program last January. 
The complaints objected to Bono's uttering the phrase "this is really, really, f------brilliant." 
The FCC, using the F-word more often to explain its deci­sion than Bono did on the air, said the word "may be crude and offensive, but. in the con­text presented here, did not describe sexual or excretory organs or activities." That dis­tinction is a key test to measure whether a statement meets a federal standard for broadcast indecency.

Associated Press 

COLORADO SPRINGS ­America's European allies are expected to otTer this week to play a bigger peacekeeping role in Bosnia and Afghanistan, helping U.S. forces stretched by the occupa­tion of Iraq and their fight against ai-Qaida. 
European nations firmed up plans for both operations at talks ahead of a two-day meet­ing of NATO defense ministers, which opens Wednesday in this Rocky Mountain city. 
NATO also has already asked the United Nations for permis­sion to expand its peacekeep­ing mission in Afghanistan and move troops beyond the capi­tal, Kabul, into other Afghan cities. 
"My top priority is that we get Afghanistan right," NATO Secretary General Lord Hobertson told reporters Tuesday. "It's a big responsibil­ity." 
NATO currently runs a force of 5,000 -mostly German and Canadian -troops maintain­ing order and supporting the Afghan authorities in Kabul. The mission is separate from the larger U.S.-led combat mis­sion fighting remnants of al­Qaida and the ousted Taliban regime in the countryside. 

Plans under consideration would send more NATO-led troops -possibly up to sever­al thousand -out to other Afghan cities to support civil­ian reconstruction teams and help extend the authority of the Afghan government in areas currently under control of local warlords. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Washington he supported a wider role for the Kabul force, which operates under a U.N. mandate. 
"We've always favored expansion outside Kabul," he said. 
However, Robertson has acknowledged that a shortage of properly trained and equipped European troops could limit the scope.

Clark's catnpaign tnanager quits 
Presidential candidate loses manager in feud over campaign direction 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Wesley Clark's campaign manager quit Tuesday in a dispute over the direction of the Democratic presidential bid, exposing a rift between the former general's Washington­based advisers and his 3­week-old Arkansas campaign team. 
Donnie Fowler told associ­ates he was leaving over widespread concerns that supporters who used the Internet to draft Clark into the race are not being taken seriously by top campaign advisers. Fowler also com­plained that the campaign's message and methods are focused too much on Washington, not key states and the burgeoning power of the Internet, said two associ­ates who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Spokesmen for the cam­paign declined to comment. 
Fowler has been at odds with communications adviser Mark Fabiani of California 
and policy adviser Ron Klain 
of Washington. All three are 
veterans of AI Gore's 2000 
presidential campaign, part 
of a large group of Clinton­
Gore activists hired by Clark 
as he entered the race Sept. 
17. 

From the start, there has been tension between the campaign's political profes­-sionals and the draft-Clark supporters. 
Fowler has complained that while the Internet-based draft-Clark supporters have been integrated into the cam­paign, their views are not taken seriously by Fabiani, Klain and other top advisers, many of them based in Washington. He has warned Clark's team that the cam­paign is threatening to be overly focused on Washington, a charge leveled against Gore's campaign in 2000. 
Fowler, son of former Democratic Party chairman Don Fowler, was quietly installed as chairman of the campaign in the first days of the bid. 
Fowler's departure is the latest blow for a campaign that has gotten off to mixed reviews. 

National polls put Clark near the top of the nine-per­son field and he raised more than $3 million in the first two weeks of his campaign, a sum that surpassed what sev­eral rivals raised in three weeks. However, he has been criticized for nip-flopping on whether he would have sup­ported the Iraq resolution, and his commitment to the Democratic Party has been questioned. 
Clark voted for Presidents Reagan and Nixon, praised both Bush administrations and had not registered to vote as a Democrat in his home state of Arkansas before entering the race. The high number of Clinton-Gore offi­cials on his campaign has caused Clark's rivals to ques­tion whether the former pres­ident is quietly pushing Clark's campaign, a charge strongly disputed by the can­didate and Clinton's associ­ates. 
Split brewing in Episcopal Church 
Associated Press 
DALLAS-An insurgent con­servative movement that could split the Episcopal Church opened a national rally Tuesday with prayers, heartfelt singing and sobering messages about a break with liberals. 
The meeting's goal is to shape plans for Episcopalians who oppose their denomination's increasing acceptance of gay relationships. At its national con­vention this summer, the church confirmed the election of a gay bishop living with his partner and voted to recognize that bish­ops are allowing blessing cere­monies for same-sex couples. 
"Our church has embraced schism and heresy," Bishop Robert Duncan of Pittsburgh told the 2,674 participants at the meeting, including 799 priests and 46 of the denomination's 300 bishops. 
Dunean, who mentioned the temporary split the church went through during the Civil War, was just one of several speakers who delivered emotional speech­es to the gathering. 
The Rev. David Roseberry of Christ Church in suburban Plano said "people are confused and hurt and angry and concerned and grieved." 

Canon David C. Anderson, president of the sponsoring American Anglican Council, said his movement welcomes people of all sexual orientations "gay and straight and ex-gay people who are committed to a biblically moral life," implying that homo­sexuals are expected to be celi­bate.

The w-aves of white 
This summer, after sifting through the bombardment of Notre Dame e­mails concerning the remarkable diversity of the Class of 2007, I half­expected to arrive on campus to see a rainbow of skin colors joining

the contrary, one of my very first Notre Dame musi­cal experiences consisted of about a dozen white kids squeezing bagpipes outside of the LaFortune Student Center. 
Clearly, this University's definition of diversity bears absolutely no resemblance to that of any contempo­rary dictionary, which tend to stress words like "difference," "variety" and "mixture." Unfortunately, on a college campus where a large part of a stu­dent's education is expected to devel­op through peer interaction, diversity in the form of Confirmation name, favorite du Lac guideline or desire to perform a colonoscopy on Bob Davie are not the preferred social back­grounds for spurring the erudite, multi-ethnic discussions characteris­tic of a University of such prestige. 
Frighteningly enough, it seems as though the only true diversity to be found in South Bend is in the bever­age sections of the North and South dining halls, where a Texan, an East or West Coaster and a Midwesterner can spend hours fiercely debating the differences between Coke, soda and pop. This, however, does not consti­tute diversity. Actually, it is merely a misconception on the part of Texans who associate the drinking of Coke with a former illegal habit of their hometown hero, President George W. Bush. 
Administrators are quick to point out that members of the Class of 2007 come from all 50 states and 36 differ­ent countries, thereby ensuring noth­ing more than that a wide variety of beers will be served at most campus parties. However, learning the subtle differences in taste between the bev­erage of choice in these varying Caucasian nations is not the type of diversity· that is necessary to create a truly open-minded and cultured stu­dent body, even if it does add some spice to a game of Beirut. 
In addition, with a high percentage of Notre Dame students coming from similarly Caucasian Catholic high schools, most of the student popula­tion has still managed to avoid open­ing their eyes to a world that does not revolve around a prosperous family lifestyle, Sunday Mass and white homogeneity. I would be extremely interested to know how many Darners have ever sang along to the horah at a Bar

bly enlightening expe­riences. 
Consequently, some changes must be made to one of the worst examples of a Notre Dame mis­nomer -"The Sea of Green." This apparently verdant coming together of the student body in their corner of the football stadium may include the occasional green face on anyone who had a little too much keg with their egg. Generally speaking, though, one cannot deny the fact that "The Wave of White" would be a much more accurate representation of the tint in Notre Dame Stadium every football weekend. 
John Kennedy once said, "The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed, but the liberation of the diverse ener­gies of free nations and free men." Why then, has this supposedly transnational campus chosen to forgo riding Kennedy's metaphorical "wave of the future?" Why then, has it cho­sen to leave behind its aspiring lead­ers of America by depriving us of the "diverse energies of free men?" 

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that this is a University rich in age-old tradition, including strong Catholic heritage, incomparable ath­letic pride and support and first-class academic excellence. Unfortunately, along with these noble remnants of the past lie the far more disturbing traditions of white, male-dominated homogeneity. It took 105 years for this college to graduate its first black which, in 1947, was a long,timeJqOffir ing compared to other top-tier U.S. universities.

after most other major colleges did so. It seems as though this University is always just a little behind the times when it comes to diversification, and the time has come once again for it to either catch up to its competition, or risk falling behind permanently. 
According to an excerpt from the Multicultural Student Programs and Services section of du Lac, "At Notre Dame, we believe variety is the spice of life." Well, if that's the case, then maybe this campus needs a little more Tabasco sauce.

Focus on the present 
I'm sitting on South Quad with my back toward Main Circle and leaning against the nag pole, my feet and legs stretching straight out in front of me. I take a deep breath and take in what is around me. It is dark and there is no one on the quad but me. Why would there be anyone out at this Adam Cahill hour? It's 4 a.m. and I try to push that thought from my head, though, A Domer's and focus on other

things. 
The Dome is brilliant tonight, even more so than usual. The majestically serene statue of Mary atop the Dome seems to command the rest of the campus. And for the first time in a while, the stars salt the sky above me as I lean my head up against the cold aluminum. The wind has died down from before into a soft breeze that barely dis­
turbs the trees that line the path up to the Admissions Building. There aren't too many nights like this.

ries get you down, he says, it's not worth it. Thanks officer, I say, I'll try. He rides off down the sidewalk toward Rockne Memorial and disappears into the distance. 
I come here sometimes when I cannot sleep. It seems like a lot more often as of late but I cannot figure out why. For a num­ber of nights, I have had this feeling that there was something inside of me that has been mounting in pressure almost to the poln1. of. eruption. But for whatever reason, I cannot put my finger on it and it pesters me even more. The depressing questions of self-confusion have dawned on me and the answers are not coming. I know it has to do with more than just the major I dislike or the classes that require all my time. I think back on the decision to come here. more of a statement than a decision. It was always here that I wanted to go. 
But why, I ask myself. Why have I always wanted to come to Notre Dame and why am I here now? 
A light breeze stirs up the trees in front of me and almost as if I am subject to divine intervention, I know. The clouds of confu­sion and mystification clear and my mind

could not have more clarity. I know why I wanted to come here. why I am here. 
I wanted, or rather, want to be somebody. I said to myself that the dreamer is only as good as the dream. And I realize now that I have lived my whole life under the pre­sumptuous idea that the world is going to need me to run it someday. And if it is not me who is running it, it's going to be me that advises the ones that do. After all, is no't a dreamer only as good as a dream? 
But I realize now that keeping my eye on the ultimate goal never got me any closer to making it a reality. It was like trying to win a marathon by looking for the finish and not noticing the 26 miles I needed to run to get there. 
Like all dreams, my ideas of life were large and without limit. When I was younger. I was going to play in the World Series and be mentioned in the same breath as the Babe and Cobb. I was going to go to 
break all the records in the 
book and then be elected 
president. I had it all figured out. 
But looking at the Dome right now I am granted a revelation. I see that dreams are only as difficult to 
achieve as we make them. I 
become conscious of the fact that the loftier the goals, the more we need to do the small things to get there. We need to focus on what there is to do today instead of what there is to do tomorrow or a decade from now. Reading .assignments, eating healthy and taking care of myself are all things that will help me reach my final goal. 
Distractions got in my way then and dis­tractions will probably get in my way again, but one thing is certain, I'm going to try and take it one step at a time. 
And as I rise to my feet and cross the quad back to my dorm. the breeze that had died down picks up again, revealing the underbelly of all the leaves on the trees. It's going to rain soon, I predict, but that's no matter. I have work to do. But first, it's time to sleep.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Consider facts 


carefully 
Pardon my frankness, but Peter Quaranto, in his Oct. 7 column, needs to bring his head down from the clouds and take a glance at the real world. 
So Pope John Paul II and John Mearsheimer challenge the United States' case for going to war. Does this make the case wrong? I believe the Pope to be a wise, keen and benevolent man, one of my favorites amongst world leaders. But he is aging, and even in the sharpest of men, age takes its toll. Further, did he have all of the information? If. as we now see, the United States did not, and the United States has extensive security and intelli­gence networks, how could the Pope? The fact is that despite ensuing problems, such as unemployment, as Quaranto cites, the Iraqi people are free of the oppressive Baathist regime. As a Catholic, I see this as some­thing of a justifica­tion of the war on Iraq, if not a complete jus­tification. As the United States is a mem­ber of the United Nations, it would seem appropriate that the United States desire to remove Hussein from power, by any means necessary ifit comes down to it. 
However, neither the United Nations nor Quaranto seems to agree with this. Sadly, members of the United Nations were more concerned with putting their own concerns ahead of those of the Iraqi people. It seems that say, the French, were more concerned with Iraqi oil than the Iraqi peo­ple. And what of the weapons found in Iraq that have been pre­liminarily linked to France, though the French deny it? 
Yes, I will concede that oil was likely a major influence in the American decision to go to war. However, in doing this selfish deed, the United States would by necessity alleviate the Iraqi peo­ple by removing Hussein. So we see two similar ideas in which the nations put their own desires above the needs of the Iraqi peo­ple. But·by carrying out the Americans' selfish goal. some good was done. So we must decide, which is better, a bad thing that leads to good, or a bad thing that leads to continued oppression? I would think the for­mer to be the lesser of two evils. But what do I know? 
Having said that about the United Nations, how can we trust the organization to be given authority over Iraq? With all of its in-fighting and the selfish desires of its members, how can it be said to still even have a strong pur­pose? I agree with Quaranto in his claims about the problems with the United States continuing as the primary re-builder, but to me this is, sadly, the lesser of two evils. 
Quaranto cites a United Nations claim that $40 billion would be enough to end world hunger and provide every child with clean drinking water, basic health care and education. He mentions the growing poverty and unemploy­ment in the United Sates. Here, I do sympathize with his argument. I personally am fiercely anti-free trade, and think our government should be taking more proactive steps to bring jobs back to 
Americans instead of giving 
them to foreign workers 
who suffer from 
labor abuses by 
corporations not 
made account­
able for their 
actions. 
However, I 
find one 
major fault 
with 
Quaranto's 
idealistic 
notion of 
ending 
world 
hunger and doing all of those other wonderful deeds. How on 
earth do we do it? Do we really think that Hussein 
would have let all of 
the amenities reach his 
people in full quantity without 
keeping some for himself and his 
soldiers? Or what about Kim Jong 
II? The man is infamous for keep­
ing humanitarian aid out of the 
hands of the many North Koreans 
starving at the hands of his 
oppressive reign. 
How have we managed to get food where it needed to go? Through force. A case in point is Somalia. While as a military ven­ture to oust General Aideed and his war machine, as well as com­peting warlords, the mission was a failure, it was successful in end­ing the famine affecting such a huge majority of the Somali peo­ple. How did we succeed? We sent in troops to defend convoys and poor areas from the war­lords. 
I have attempted to, in the most intelligent and coherent way I can, point out why force is some­times necessary, and how it may be justified in Iraq. Carefully note that I said "may." I do not know if this venture by the War Party is justified. I do not know if I will ever believe it to be just, or unjust. Perhaps even 20 years from now I shall still be on the fence. But it is not the place of Quaranto, or anyone, to be so hasty as t~ judge this war without frrst seeing what ensues over the coming years.

Scene music critics reveal 
"American English" brings back memories 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Music Critic 
Nick Hornby wrote in his brilliant book 31 Songs that "sometimes, very occasionally, songs and books and films and pictures express who you are, per­fectly. And they don't do this in words or images necessarily; the connection is a lot less direct and more complicated than that." One of the most impressive abilities of music and simple, sometimes incredibly inane rock and pop songs is to transport their listeners back to a specific place and time and allow them to recall exactly how they felt. Day after day, week after week, music is my own personal time machine. 
The best songs -the ones that stick with me -are the ones that I can place within a specific time and place. Coldplay's Parachutes, the first side of Sigur Ros' () and just about every U2 and R.E.M. song ever written has its place on my own personal timeline. Like Hornby's character Rob in High Fidelity, my music collection is less a definition of musical taste than of auto­biography. 
Last May, I was in the Dublin airport coming back from a semester abroad, and I thought the perfect last purchase in Ireland would be a CD. After glanc­ing through the racks I picked up Idlewild's The Remote Part, an album and an artist I had never heard of. It's always a dangerous proposition to buy something costing over 10 euros on impulse alone, but I gave it a shot. 
Once it hit the third track, "American English," I was sold on it. The rest of the album was very good, but that third track had me hitting repeat all the way from Ireland to New York, and I still lis­ten to that song about once a day -the driving beat, the pulse, the beautiful refrain that promises to "keep singing a this means I 'cause you already know." Other songs I listen to may be better. and Idlewild will probably never be loved by millions of people, but almost no song can bring me back to better

Pink Moon possesses subterranean Inusical beauty 
By RYAN RAFFERTY 
Scene Music Critic 
If I were to ask you to name your favorite album of all time, how quickly would you be able to answer? Would you quickly rattle off a widely-accepted clas­sic album like Led Zeppelin's IV, or Pink Floyd's Dark Side ofthe Moon? 
If you're a true music fan, you would fear this question like leprosy. Music is a hugely emotional medium, and, like emo­tions, it is always changing. So when my editor asked me to write about my favorite album or artist, I spent hours racking my brain. I spent the entire day going through all of my albums, trying to fmd the perfect one. I finally decided on Nick Drake's Pink Moon. 
My reasoning behind choosing Pink Moon was actually easier than I thought. I asked myself what album I could listen to at any time of day or any time of the year and have it feel brand new. There were other albums that followed that criterion, but Nick Drake has always struck that emotional E minor chord in my heart. 
Pink Moon clocks in at only 28 minutes -but a delicate and beautiful 28 min­utes. It was the final album from a bril­liant folk artist who committed suicide shortly after recording this album in his basement. What makes this album so special is the nakedness of the music. The only instruments that appear are Nick's wonderfully finger-picked acoustic guitar and his gorgeously melancholy vocals. One song. "Know" is only four notes played behind Nick's hummed vocals. Despite its lack of depth, Pink Moon is incredibly subterranean in its musical beauty. 
Many will recognize the title track from its use in Volkswagen commercials, but there is so much more to this album. Pink Moon captures a certain tender yet hope­ful sensation through the 11 tracks. When

U2' s Inusic defines a generation 
By REBECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Music Critic 
Like most 15-year-old girls, my absolute favorite song after 15 boy band-filled years of musical develop­ment was "Crash" by Dave Matthews Band. Dave Matthews Band fandom was my mature move into what I con­sidered to be "real" music. This new­found appreciation of "real" music, which came directly from my clearly extensive musical expertise, opened up new worlds for me. 
Eventually, I turned off my "Today's Hits" radio station and determined to find real music I could truly appreci­ate. I nobly went out -and borrowed my friends' Beastie Boys and Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits albums. After committing both albums to memory, I still found myself hungry for a deeper level of musical genius than party songs and divas. At this time. I entered an art class composed of a handful of musical connoisseurs, and somewhere between Britney and Metallica, some­one played the U2 The Joshua Tree album. Enough said. With the huge · rock ballads "With or Without You," "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "Where the Streets Have No Name," I became an instant fan. 
Since my initial life-changing experi­ence of U2, I have only become more and more addicted to the Irish band that fills stadiums without a second thought. "All That You Can't Leave Behind" came out right as my addic­tion began to peak. While this is slightly glorified, in all seriousness, I believe that U2 has been the defining band of our time. They are one of the 
few bands 
today known 
worldwide, 
and as much 
as they hate 
this compari­
son. they are 
The Beatles 
of our gener­
ation. Not 
only do they 
write amaz­
ing and 
groundbreak­
ing music, 
but they also 
use their 
fame for the 
improvement of the world at large. 
Political activists from the start, U2 
strive to bring peace to the world 
through their art form. They are great men, and the band of our time.

T
hrough the years; thousands of students have taken part in the diverse opportunities offered through the Center for Social Concerns and our many partners. Each student has made an important difference. 
Very often these students' service involvement, and the learning that comes through and with it, has transformed them. In turn, their transformation allows each of them to be ever more impressive agents of transformation and/or goodness within others' lives and within communities. These students continue to reach out long after their time at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross College.

world's transformation. The Center for Social Concerns invites you to push the boundaries of your classroom into the neighborhoods of South Bend and beyond. Come and enter the lives of those who live and study and work there. Jesus called love the greatest ofall commandments-to love the Lord God with all our hearts and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Mark 
12: 28-31). It is not easy but it remains no less our challenge and call. It is the foundation on which we will build the justice we seek and the peace we long for. 
Be a part of the transformation we are called to, and be transformed. Give yourself away. One or more of the opportunities on these pages could quite possibly change you forever.

other situations the elderly may need assistance or companionship. 
"There are so many needs­and by extension-so many opportunities to help," said Cahill Kelly. "There really is something each student can do to help." 
Service & Learning It is also clear that being ofservice goes both ways for the student. Cahill Kelly explains that often the experience of volunteering contributes to the overall educational experience at Notre Dame. "For many of our students, 
volunteering is a chance to broaden their education. They have a chance to learn new skills as well as utilize the skills they are developing in their courses," says Cahill Kelly. 
For the student, service work provides an opportunity to build relationships and affect the lives of others as well as their own. 
"There are countless stories out there of students who have been changed by their service experiences. Many have learned that service is rewarding because of the people they meet and the relationships of mutual benefit they develop."

The Bends conveys raw emotion 

By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
There are certain moments in my life that would be entirely. forgettable were it not for the music playing in the background. That may sound strange to some of you, but I am almost certain that anyone who truly loves music can remember at least one such experience. I can remember the very first time I encountered Radiohead's The Bends. Sitting in front of my computer, sending IMs to my friends on AOL (as I can often be found doing today), I decided to pop in the CD that I had recently borrowed from a friend. As I continued typing, the music that I had intended to be mere background noise began to assert itself more and more into my consciousness. Soon, I found that I was unable to force it into the back­ground, and not only that, but I was also unable to let the album play past the fourth track without starting it over again. I was so taken with the music I heard that I kept playing "High and Dry" and "Fake Plastic Trees" over and over again. Luckily, when I had finally had my temporary fill of those two songs, I was able to listen to the album in its entirety and immediately christened it my new favorite, a title that it retains to this day. There is some unexplainable quality in Thorn Yorke's voice that drives his emotion into the ears of lis­teners, even though he is not what we might call a conventionally "tal-ented" vocalist. "High and Dry" is one of those songs that can make you want to cry even if you are in a good mood. 

Though that may not necessarily sound like a good thing, there is some­thing to be said for experiencing raw emotion. And that is exactly what you 

get when listening to The Bends.

Blackalicious shows another side of hip hop 
By KENYAITA STORIN 
Scene Music Critic 
Unlike most of you, who probably began listening to music in elementary school, it was not until the rise of Napster in high school that I really began to get interested in music. Before then. I had always enjoyed music, but I had known very little about it. Napster allowed me to download just about any­thing my friends told me was good, and from that I was soon able to develop the tastes in music that I have today. I now enjoy listening to many different genres of music, but hip-hop has always been my favorite. Although it is obviously one of the most popular genres of today, I find that modern hip-hop too often gets 
wrongfully criticized for being solely about money. sex and violence. Pop rap may typically fall under this criticism, but this generalization does the genre as a whole no justice, and it does not take into account the numerous contempo­rary hip-hop artists out there that dis­prove this criticism. 
The progressive underground rap scene has much to offer those who want to hear rap that is a little deeper and, in some cases, more intellectual than what is usually heard on the radio. I believe that the rap act Blackalicious exempli­fies this better than anyone else. Blackalicious is one of the most talented and unique duos out there of any genre of music, with excellent, poetic rhymes from Gift of Gab and complex, experi­mental production from Chief Xcel that draws from a number of different genres. Gift of Gab raps at an alarming speed com­plete with allusions, metaphors and a vocabulary that would make an English professor proud. And best of all, rather than being misogynous or violent, Blackalicious is both spiritual and uplift­ing. If you are one of those people who dislikes the rap you have heard for its shallowness, give Blackalicious a chance to enlighten your view on hip-hop.

Weezer' s Pinkerton, a heartfelt release 
By BRIAN FOY 
Scene Music Criric 
Hemember when Weezer came out with "Buddy Holly" and "Say It Ain't So" and everybody bought the Blue Album? Then, they seemingly fell off the face of the Earth before they resurfaced with "Hash Pipe" and "Island in the Sun" from the 
Green Album? 
Well, Weezer didn't fall off the face of the Earth, but instead recorded one of the best albums that almost nobody has heard. Weezer's sophomore release Pinkerton is the most honest album of the last d1!cade and maybe the greatest dis­play of sincerity ever recorded on one album. 
When I heard Pinkerton, I was immedi­ately taken back by '"Tired of Sex." The song is a slow-brewing, simple track about Hivers Cuomo's desire to find a girl that he can love so that he can stop just having sex. When the song closes with the line "So why can't I be making love come true?" I knew this was not the same Weezer I had heard before or have since. "The Good Life" is Weezer at their finest, with a catchy guitar riff and lyrics like "I should have no feeling, 'cuz feeling is pain." Rivers is pouring himself out on the album and is coming from some very deep places to do this. "Across the Sea" might be the strongest song on the album, as it mixes multiple layered instruments with heartfelt lyrics. "Why are you so far away from me? I need help and you're way across the sea" set the tone for the chorus and the song as a whole. My favorite song on the album is "EI Scorcho" because of its increasing pace music and identifiable lyrics. Every time I hear ''I'm a lot like you. so please llello. I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me" I am reminded that every­one goes through difficult things in life. The most humorous and comforting song on the album might be "Pink Triangle." The chorus opens up with ''I'm dumb, she's a lesbian. I thought I had found the one." Anyone who has been wrong about someone that they thought they knew can take solace in these lyrics. Hivers has obviously been through some troubling times, and from the lyrics it sounds like they are worse than any I might go through. 

Weezer's Pinkerton was heartfelt and true before guys like John Mayer ruined the entire genre by taking it way too far. Rivers proves you can be emotional and sentimental without being overly sappy. Musically, the bass, drums and guitar all follow the same pattern, so we are not dealing with Mozart, but The Beatles' music wasn't the most complex, either. Pinkerton is an outstanding album because of its lyrical content, not its musi­cal complexity. Pinkerton proved that Weezer is not a typical band and that they have musical substance. They were will­ing to push the envelope and take things in a different direction. The problem is that the general public has been slow to receive this album, but it is gaining popu­larity and developing a cult status. Weezer's Pinkerton is not only the best album you've never heard, but it's also my favorite album.

James shines in first exhibition game win 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -LeBron James' second assist was more impressive than his first basket. 
Making his professional debut in the Cleveland Cavaliers' first exhibition game, James was a better passer than scorer in a 100­96 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night. 
James shot 4-for-12 while scoring eight points and had three rebounds and seven assists -the prettiest of which came as he was cutting across the lane midway through the first quarter. As a sec­ond defender Davis for an easy basket. 
His favorite pass, however, was the early one to Ilgauskas. 
"I see a lot of things before some of my teammates even see it, so I'm going to try to put them in position where they can score a basket," James said. 
One heckler made James laugh by telling him his car was ugly, but James had little other interaction with a crowd sprinkled with fans wearing replicas of James' wine-and-gold Cavaliers jer­sey. Many more No. 23 jer­seys will be bought and worn this season as most fans get their first look at the most hyped prep

evening when he struggled with his outside shot but would have had more assists if his teammates had convert­ed other nifty passes. 
"Where he gets that vision from, .I don't know," Cavs coach Paul Silas said, "because he can come up with some passes like nobody can." 
James' only basket of the first half was a breakaway dunk off a steal by Ricky Davis. Knowing he was all alone, James fully extended his right arm and flushed home a one-handed jam. The dunk was replayed twice on the main scoreboard. 
James made three outside shots in the third quarter when he handled more of the playmaking chores, and he added a deft touch pass to 
is that I don't have to go to class any more," James said. "The level of play is so much higher here. In high school, you could take a few minutes off and coast a little. You can't take a second off in the NBA." 
James was under the watchful eye of veteran refer­ee Joey Crawford as the play­ers came out for the opening tip. 
James, unadorned by the headband and arm sleeves he wore in high school, walked over toward the Detroit bench and greeted each starter indi­vidually, calling several Pistons by name while exchanging hugs and pound­ing fists as Crawford watched bemusedly from the center circle. 
Crawford later made sure 


James tucked in his shirt, then called the rookie for the type of ticky-tack hand­checking foul that referees use in the preseason to test a young player's response. James shrugged off the call, similar to his non-response in the fourth quarter when he tried to draw a charge against rookie Ronald Dupree but Crawford whistled a blocking foul instead. 
"I just want to see what he's going to bring to the table. There's a lot of hype around him," said Detroit's Ben Wallace, whose curiosity mir­rors that of many who have not yet seen James play. 

The Pistons credentialed more than 100 media for a game in which the enduring image of James was his pass­ing. He had assists off two other no-look passes, although he also had a drive swatted away by Wallace and shot an airball on one of his first attempts from the out­side. 
James spent only a few moments on the court togeth­er with Serbian teenager Darko Milicic, who was taken second overall in the draft by Detroit. Milicic was only 2-of­8 from the field and 1-for-4 from the line for five points. 
"The other kid was sensa­tional," Detroit coach Larry Brown said.

NHL -
Heatley allowed to attend teammate Snyder's funeral 
Associated Press 
DULUTH, Ga. -Atlanta Thrashers All-Star Dany lleatley will be allowed to trav­el to Canada for the funeral of teammate Dan Snyder, who died of head injuries sustained when Heatley's sports car crashed. 
Charges against Heatley were l!Pgraded to vehicular homicide Monday, one day after Snyder's death and a week after the accident. 
"lie's an emotional wreck," said lleatley's attorney, Ed Garland. "lie's grieving the tragic death of Dan Snyder. That's been almost his entire focus." 
Magistrate Hichard !licks on TuPsday cleared the way for lleatley to attend Snyder's service Friday in Elmira, Ontario, with the rest of the team. The judge also signed a consent bond adding the upgraded charge. 
Heatley will remain free on the $50,000 bond he posted on lesser charges filed shortly after the Sept. 29 crash, said a spokeswoman in Hick's office. 
Snyder died Sunday at a hos­pital, where he had been in a coma since the crash. He was 25. 
Heatley, the 22-year-old leader of the team, broke his jaw and tore ligaments in his 
right knee. lie was released 
from the hospital Monday to 
spend time with his family, but 
he returned Tuesday for knee 
surgery. 
A spokesman for the district 
attorney's office, Erik Friedly, 
said the vehicular homicide 
charge was based on a prelimi­
nary finding that Heatley was 
driving recklessly. It carries a 
prison sentence of three to 15 
years. 
General manager Don 
Waddell said team officials held . internal discussions about pos­sibly delaying Thursday night's season opene~ but the Snyder 
family persuaded them to play. 
"When I talked to the Snyder 
family, they really expressed 
their concern for the team and 
how we mDve forward," 
Waddell said at a news confer­
ence at the team's headquar­
ters in suburban Atlanta. "They 
really felt the team needed to 
play." 
The Thrashers open the sea­
son Thursday against the 
Columbus Blue Jackets. Last 
season, Heatley scored a team­
record 41 goals and was MVP 
of the All-Star game. 
Heatley also faces four mis­
demeanor counts, each of 
which are punishable by up to 
a year in prison. He is free on 
$50,000 bond. 
"We are overwhelmingly sad­
dened and distraught over this tragic loss," the Heatley family said in a statement released by the Thrashers. "Dan was a genuine and caring individual, and a tremendous friend to us all. 
"Our deepest sympathies and compassion go out to his par­ents and their entire family." 
Police said Heatley was driv­ing his Ferrari at about 80 mph on a narrow two-lane road when he lost control, spun off the road and smashed into a brick and wrought iron fence. 
Heatley's case has yet to be presented to a grand jury, which would decide on the for-mal charges, Friedly said. Prosecutors are waiting for more evidence before taking their case to the grand jury. 


Police were also awaiting test results to determine if Heatley was drinking on the night of the wreck. There is "no conclu­sive indication" that Heatley was drinking, Friedly said. 
Heatley and Snyder had been at an event for season-ticket holders at Philips Arena shortly before the crash. 
Snyder, a center who had 10 goals and four assists in 36 games for Atlanta last season, had surgery on his ankle in September before the start of training camp. He was expect­ed to start the season on the injured list. 


Snyder signed with the Thrashers as an undrafted free agent in 1999 after playing four seasons of junior hockey for Owen Sound in the Ontario Hockey League. " 
How many undrafted guys make it to the NHL? Not many," Waddell said. "He had to work his way into the lineup to play in the minor leagues. The sec­ond half of last year, he really proved he was ready to be an NHL player."

McGahee passes physical, will return to Bills 
Top pick only needs clearence from doctors 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. -Bills rookie Willis McGahee passed a physical on his injured left knee Tuesday, one of the final steps that would allow the running back to begin practic­ing as early as next week. 
John Uribe conducted the physical in Miami. Uribe is the University of Miami team physician who surgically repaired the three torn liga­ments McGahee sustained dur­ing the Hurricanes' loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl last January. 
"He's ready to play," Uribe said. "He's worked pretty hard to get back to where he is and the fact that his biology coop­erated is pretty amazing. He looks very good." 
McGahee's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, was excited by the findings, and said the results all but clear the way for his client to begin practicing. 
"It was a successful visit and he's on his path to an amazing recovery," Rosenhaus said. "There doesn't appear to be any reason not to go ahead." 
Rosenhaus said the Bills approved McGahee's exam in Miami, and that Uribe was passing along the results to the team's training staff. 
The final step for McGahee's

Bills president Tom Donahoe declined to comment on the test results.

McGahee, selected 23rd overall, opened the season on the reserve nonfootball injury list. The earliest he could take the field is next week, after the Bills (3-2) travel to play the Jets on Sunday. 
NFL rules bar a player on the injured list from practicing until between Week 6 and 9. Once McGahee begins practic­ing, the Bills would have three weeks to determine whether to place him on the active ros­ter. 
Because of his long rehabili­tation, McGahee is expected to require at least two weeks of practice before the Bills would consider using him in a game. 
McGahee has spent the last two months working out on his own while being limited to watching practice from the sideline. The most he has been allowed to do is catch passes in

McGahee's presence could spark a running back competi­tion in Buffalo. Returning starter Travis Henry was ini­tially unhappy -calling it "a slap in the face" -the day McGahee was drafted. 
Henry, who finished fifth in the NFL last season with 1,438 yards rushing, has since said he is open to competing with McGahee, who set school records with 1,753 yards rush­ing and 28 touchdowns last season.

NBA 
Bryant considers waiving initial hearing 
Associated Press 
EAGLE, Colo. -Attorneys in the Kobe Bryant case huddled with the judge Tuesday but didn't answer the biggest ques­tion: Will the NBA star waive his preliminary hearing to keep potentially damaging evidence from being heard publicly? 
That decision might not be made until minutes before Thursday's hearing, where prosecutors will present evi­dence they say proves Bryant raped a young hotel worker in his room at a mountain lodge on June 30. 
Though everyone involved in the case has been silenced by a gag order, many legal analysts expect the defense to waive the preliminary hearing and acknowledge there is enough evidence for a judge to order a trial. 
"If they have the hearing the public is going to hear basically all the details of what hap­pened that night and it's going to be told from the prosecu­tion's perspective," said Karen Steinhauser. a former prosecu­tor and law professor at the University of Denver. "There's a lot of unfavorable evidence going to be brought out in pub­
...
[IC. 
Another reason for waiving the hearing is that the defense has little to gain, said Denver defense attorney Dan Recht. 
"There's no way the defense will win a preliminary hearing. No way. None," Recht said. 
Even if the hearing is waived, Bryant must appear Thursday in front of Judge rrederick Gannett for a bail hearing. Bryant, free on $25,000 bail, would also at some point have to appear in another court to enter a plea to the sexual assault charge. 
Bryant was in Hawaii this week, where the Los Angeles Lakers were training and play­ing their first exhibition games. 
The basketball star's attor­neys met earlier in the day with prosecutors and Gannett for more than an hour. dis­cussing what a court spokes­woman called logistical issues. Exiting the courtroom, Gannett wouldn't comment. Earlier, he said he didn't expect the issue of waiving the preliminary hearing to come up. 
Attorneys were to meet with the judge once more Thursday, just 45 minutes before the hearing. to resolve other issues. At that point. defense attorneys could move to waive the hearing and take their· chances at trial. 
Prosecutors planned to bring a sheriff's detective to the stand at the preliminary hear­ing to discuss the investigation and the conclusions reached by a nurse who examined Bryant's accuser.

"With the Olympics just 10 months away, if you believe that we need to get rid of some of these older players, clean house and go younger, then I think it's a mistake," U.S. coach April Heinrichs said Tuesday. "It's really a mistake." 
The Americans went through a spirited workout at the Nike World Campus on Tuesday, singing "Happy Birthday" to 29-year-old Shannon MacMillan, then taking turns kicking soccer balls at her as she bent over in front of the net. 
The team will leave Wednesday to prepare for its third-place World Cup match against Canada on Saturday in Carson, Calif. 
"Right now we have a very recent goal of beating Canada and leaving this World Cup with our heads held as high as we can hold them," Abby Wambach said. "There's a lot of pride in still being in the World Cup right now, and there's a lot of pride going into the next 10 months of our preparation for the Olympics." 
Hamm would have nothing to do with any Olympic talk, not with Canada to play. 
"·I don't want to assume that I'm part of anything next year," she said. "I can't control that 

-
right now. All I can do is focus on our task at hand and that's the consolation game on Saturday against Canada. I mean, that's going to take our full concentration." · 
Hamm had an ice pack on one -knee. When asked if she was all right. she nodded yes, then added, "Haven't you read? We're old." 
She was not smiling. 
The idea that this is a team with too many players past their prime does not sit well in the aftermath of Sunday's 3-0 semifinal loss to Germany that ended any chance of repeating as World Cup champion. 
"Some people say that we have old-timers on this team," said the 23-year-old Wambach, one of the brightest young stars in international soccer. "But if you ask anybody in this organi­zation, in the federation, there's no way that we even put them in an old-timer sentence. Just because you're a veteran, doesn't mean you're an old­timer and that you don't have the stuff." 
Hamm is 32 and has said she will retire after Athens. Brandi Chastain is 35 and is recover­ing from a broken foot. She wants a shot at the Olympic team, too. Joy Fawcett is 35. Briana Scurry, Julie Foudy and Kristine Lilly all are 32. They all want to go for another Olympic gold. 
"For some of them it's going to be their last go-round for an international event," Wambach said. "I think that's going to be all the more motivation." 
Wambach makes no secret she expects her older team­mates to be around for a big finish next year.

Scandals leave English football reeling 
Associated Press 
LONDON -English football has been left reeling by a string of scandals which threaten to rip up the founda­tions of the game's unprece­dented growth over the last decade. 
Allegations that a group of Premiership players were involved in the gang rape of a 17-year-old high school stu­dent have been followed by a series of revelations that will repel both traditional fans and the new wave of middle-class supporters who have helped to underpin the football boom. 
In the space of barely 24 hours, it emerged that England defender Rio Ferdinand had skipped a dop­ing test, Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy was convicted of being drunk and disorderly and two Leeds players were questioned by police in con­nection with a serious sexual assault. 
Ferdinand claims he was the victim of a simple oversight, Bellamy was acquitted of more serious charges that he had racially abused a night­club doorman and the investi­gation into the Leeds players is only in its preliminary stages. 
But football chiefs have been powerless to contain a wave of repulsion and concern over the huge wealth bestowed upon young players and the resulting hedonistic, and irresponsible, sub-culture which is seen as contributing to such unsavoury incidents. 
Even a relatively unknown player in the Premiership can count on an annual income in the region of one million pounds. Stars can command up to live times that amount, thanks in large part to the huge television revenues English football generates around the world. 
Police have yet to charge anyone in connection with the alleged gang rape of a 17­year-old in a London hotel at the end of last month. 
But ooe of the men involved in the alleged attack has claimed the girl consented to sex with several men, a prac­tice he described as "roasting" and said was commonplace among Premiership players. 
Late Tuesday, it emerged that West Yorkshire Police had questioned two Leeds United players in connection with an an alleged sex attack on a 20­year-old woman in the north­ern city on Monday. 
A statement from the club said: "Leeds United Football Club has been advised by West Yorkshire police of an ongoing investigation, and in line with club policy full cooperation has been extended to the police." 
Leeds are no strangers to criticism over the conduct of their players. Their former defender Jonathan Woodgate was convicted of affray in con­nection with the savage beat­ing of an Asian student by a gang of drunken youths in the city in January 2000. His team-mate Lee Bowyer was described by the judge in the case as an unreliable witness but escaped conviction. 
Ferdinand meanwhile has described himself as "absolutely devastated" after being excluded from the England squad for failing to provide a urine sample for a random doping test after training with his club on September 23. 
The England defender claimed he had been preoccu­pied with moving house on that day and had simply for­gotten to go for the test. He subsequently had a test, 36 hours later, which proved neg­ative. 
Ferdinand's club Manchester United, his union: the Professional Footballers' Association, and his interna­tional manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson. have all made it clear they believe the FA acted prematurely. Ferdinand himself has denied taking any drugs, recreatio11al or per­formance-enhancing. 
But judging by the opinions of callers to radio talk shows and a series of snap polls on the Internet, most English football fans back the FA's tough stance. Innocent or not, the Manchester United star could find his chances of a fair trial prejudiced by the excesses of his' peers. 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL 

Texas looks to knock down OU 
Associated Press 

Chance Mock and Vince Young will try to help Texas do something Chris Simms couldn't: Beat Oklahoma. 
The 11th-ranked Longhorns look for their first win in four years against the top-ranked Sooners when the teams meet for their annual matchup at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on Saturday. 
Simms, who graduated last season, was intercepted eight times, sacked nine times and did not throw a touchdown pass while losing three straight games to Oklahoma. 
This season, Texas coach Mack Brown has a pair of quarterbacks to he rotates in and out -Mock, a strong passer, and the freshman Young, an impressive scram­bler. Brown has not announced who will start against the Sooners (5-0. 1-0 Big 12) and has said that both will sec action. 
"We told both guys, 'We're going to continue to play both of you and we're not going to discuss it during the week,"' Brown said. "So let's talk about OU instead of getting into a discussion of who should start." 
Mock, who is listed as the 



Longhorns' No. 1 quarterback 
on the team's depth chart. has 
already thrown 11 touchdown 
passes, including a 51-yarder 
in a 24-20 win against Kansas 
State last Saturday. 
However, Young has guided 
Texas (4-1, 1-0) to touch­
downs on 11 of the 17 drives 
he has led, including a game­
winning march against the 
Wildcats, highlighted by a 52­
yard pass. And his ability to 
scramble would provide a 
challenge to a Sooners 
defense that dominated the 
immobile Simms. 
"Everybody has trouble 
defending mobile QBs," 
Oklahoma co-defensive coor­
dinator Mike Stoops said. 
"Obviously, [Young] is a guy 
we have to account for. It's a 
different style of Texas than 
we're used to seeing." 
The players seem to be 
impressed with Young as well. 
"I don't know if anyone has 
really tackled him yet," 
Sooners defensive end Dan 
Cody said. "It looks like he 
just kinda fell down." 
Young twisted his right 
ankle in the third quarter of 
Saturday's game and had to 
be helped off the field before 
returning in the fourth. 
However, he said that he 
would be fine for the 
Shootout. 
Of course, two quarterbacks ... 
might not be enough to stop a 
tough Oklahoma squad that 
has outscored opponents 221­
75 and scored at least 50 
points in each of its last three 
games -the first time they 
have accomplished that feat 
since 1956. 
"They are playing great 
right now," Brown said. "We'll 
lose some sleep over the next 
couple of days to try to figure 
them out." 
So far, Oklahoma's defense 
has been as strong as expect­
ed, and the offense, led by 
quarterback Jason White, has 
been much better than 
thought. 
In their 53-7 win over Iowa 
State last Saturday. the 
Sooners gained 613 yards, the 
most ever under Bob Stoops, 
while holding the Cyclones to 
234. The defense forced six sacks, two interceptions and a fumble recovery. 
"I think they're the best team in the country," Brown said. "Great defenses are usu­ally better than the offenses they play. They have no weak­nesses on defense. Then no one talks about the offense and the offensive line. Their talent is as good as anybody in the country." 

Stoops is understandably ­pleased with the way his team is playing. 
"We're probably peaking at the right moment," he said. "We're getting into the Big 12 schedule and looking forward to next week." 
Texas leads the all-time series 55-37-5.

Rivera rocks the postseason 
Associarcd Press 
NEW YORK -When the New York Yankees have their way, all that postseason pres­sure is left in the delicately thin lingers of one man's right hand. 
Mariano Hivera rarely dis­appoints. 
"It's a good feeling. That's why you're the closer. Otherwise, you wouldn't be doing that job," he said. 
The Yankees have counted heavily on Rivera throughout their run of four World Series titles and Jive pennants in the past seven years. They expect to do so again when the AL championship series against the Boston Red Sox begins Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. 
"We would not be here, we would not be wearing the rings that we are wearing now if it was not for Mo. lie's like a regular player, whether he's a shortstop or a center fielder or catcher or whatev­er," manager Joe Torre said. "I think Mo has to be in the back of teams' minds when you know he's sitting there in that bullpen. Right now, he's throwing the ball as well as he has thrown in all of the years I've been here." 
That's a scary thought for the Red Sox, who have seen plenty of Rivera over the years and know how domi­nant he can be. After starting the season on the disabled list with a strained right groin, he converted 40 of 46 save chances and ended the year with a career-best 1.66 ERA. He did not allow a run in his last 15 appearances. 
"I think every starter on the staff is glad that Mo is back at the back of the bullpen and throwing the ball the way he's been throwing it," said Mike Mussina, who will start Game 1 against knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. "We know if we can get to the ninth inning with a lead, we'll take our chances out there with him every single time." 
Often in October, Torre won't even wait until the ninth to go to Mo -especially this season with New York's shaky setup situation. The four-time All-Star had a pair of two-inning saves in the first round against Minnesota, further demonstrating" his ability to turn it up under postseason pressure. Rivera retired all 12 Twins he faced, extending his postseason record for career saves to 27. 
The right-hander converted 23 consecutive postseason save opportunities before tak­ing the loss in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against Arizona, and he once pitched a record 33 1-3 straight scoreless innings in postsea­son play.

Johnny Damon, right, and second baseman Damian Jackson collide while attempting to catch a ball hit by Oakland's Jermalne Dye In Game 5 of the American League Division Series playoffs 
Concussion could keep Damon out of Game 1 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Hed Sox 
center fielder Johnny Damon 
was discharged from an 
Oakland hospital Tuesday 
and instead of joining his 
teammates in New York, 
went to Boston to see a neu­
rologist. 
Damon's concussion is 
expected to keep him out for 
at least part of the American 
League Championship Series 
against the Yankees. 
He was injured in a fright­
ening collision with second 
baseman Damian Jackson in 
Game 5 on Sunday night and 
was unconscious for several 
minutes before being 
removed on a stretcher. 
Manager Grady Little tried to be upbeat about the condi­tion of his leadoff man. "We certainly feel like he'll be ready to play before the series is over," Little said Tuesday. "Whether he's ready to play tomorrow, we're not sure right now. He did suffer a pretty severe concussion out there and he was taking some more tests this morning. Hopefully, he'll be ready to get back in a couple of days." 
In the meantime, Little said he would use Gabe Kapler in center field to replace Damon. Kapler batted .291 in 158 at-bats after coming to the Hed Sox in midseason. 
Boston general manager Theo Epstein would not rule out Damon. 
''I'm not saying it's a loss yet," he said. "Let's wait and see." 
Playing without Damon for any length of time would have a major impact on Boston's chances against the Yankees. 
"It would be tough," sec­ond baseman Todd Walker said. "He's a big part of this team. Without him, it would be difficult. From what we hear, things are fairly good." 
First baseman Kevin Millar said as important as Damon is to the Red Sox, the team does not depend on just one or two players. 
"It's been amazing," he said. "There's a lot of char­acter and a lot of chemistry in this clubhouse."' 
Kapler said he noticed that 
almost immediately after 
signing with the Hed Sox fol­
lowing his release by 
Colorado. After stretches 
with Detroit, Texas and the 
Rockies -"not good teams," 
he said -the Hed Sox expe­
rience has been completely 
new for him. 
"These are guys who love 
each other," he said. "These 
are affectionate, caring indi­
viduals, guys who pull for 
each other and care for each 
other." 
They are also bonded by 
buzz haircuts. Damon is one 
of the last Hed Sox with a full 
head of hair. Almost all the 
others have shaved heads. 
And that includes Little and 
Epstein. "They even got me 
and Theo last night," Little 
said. 
Damon's injury shook the Sox when it occurred. Pitcher Derek Lowe was one of the first players to reach the center fielder. 
"I went out there," Lowe said. "He had no idea what happened or where he was or why we were all looking .. at him. When he came to, he wanted to know if the ball was caught." 
As he was placed in the ambulance, Damon waved, a signal to his teammates that he was OK. 
Still, Little must prepare to be without him, probably at least until Saturday's Game 3. 
"I think what Johnny Damon brings to the lineup is well understood," Little said. "lie's a good leadoff hit­ter. lie's a good center field­er. He's a tough man to replace, but we feel confi­dent Gabe Kapler can do the 

-
job whenever he's in the game. He did a good job 1111­ing in for Trot Nixon for a couple of weeks going toward the end of the season in right field. He's very respectable."' 
Little said he would start knuckleballer Tim Wakefield in Wednesday's opener with Lowe set for Game 2 and Pedro Martinez in Game 3 on Saturday in Boston. That would make Martinez, the ace of the staff, available for a Game 6 or 7, if the series goes that long.

Irish finish 15th at tournament 
Special to The Observer 
GLENVIEW. Ill. -The Notre Dame men's golf team wound up in a tie for 15th place at the Windon Memorial Classic which concluded Tuesday at the par­72, 7,058-yard North Shore Country Club in Glenview, Ill.. just north of Chicago. 
The tournament, which was hosted by Northwestern University, featured eight of the top 50 teams in the nation, according to the latest Golfweek/Sagarin Performance Index rankings, led by No. 10 Minnesota and No. 25 California. 

The Irish fired a final-round 302 on Tuesday, highlighted by an even-par 72 from sopho­more Scott Gustafson and a l­over par 73 from freshman Cole !shan. 
Notre Dame finished the tour­nament with a score of 909, tying them with SMU for 15th place. Minnesota won the event with a S-under par 859 team score, nine shots clear of Purdue and California. 
Individually, the Irish were strong in their top two posi­tions. Gustafson was the top fin­isher for Notre Dame, placing in a tie for 11th overall with a career-low score of 1-over par 217. 
His previous best 54-hole total was 219, which he set at the 2002 Kansas Invitational. Gustafson's score in relation to par also was the best of his career.

Belles pound Olivet in im.pressive fashion 
Observer Staff Report 
The Saint Mary's soccer team got off to a quick start and never looked back in its' 4-0 blanking of Olivet Tuesday night. 
"The team played a solid game where we dictated the pace and controlled the offensive half field through­out the majority of the game, Belles coach Peter Haring said. "I am happy with the overall play of the team after this game and it was good to give some bench players quality field time towards the end of the match." 
Wendy Irvin scored in the 13th minute from the assist of Ashley Hinton. Irvin took the ball and fired it from just inside the penalty box area. 
The Belles were held scoreless for the rest of the first half, but exploded in the second half to put the game out of reach for Olivet. 
In the 53rd minute, Jen Concannon shot a low ball into the corner of the net to give her team a 2-0 edge. In the 79th minute, the Belles continued to pour it on with another goal by freshman Megan Mackenzie. Finally Katie Green scored in the 86th minute to finish the scoring and give the Belles the 4-0 win." 
"It was nice to see some of our bench players come onto the field and contribute in the scoring," Haring said. "Green and Mackenzie com­bined for the final two goals and they worked well with each other." 
Overall, Haring was pleased with the effort of his team. 
"We used our outside players more during this game than we have during our last two outings and it showed because we had so many good shot opportuni­ties in front of the goal," he said.

Phoxes beat Farley, win second straight 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER, MATT 
PUGLISI and DAN 
TAPETILLO 
Asscoiate Sports Editor and Sports Writers 
One week after ending a four­year losing streak, Pangborn is hoping to continue a streak in a new direction. The Phoxes won their second straight game Tuesday with a 20-13 win over Farley. 
Led olt defense by Katie Riemersma, who returned one interception for a touchdown and picked off two more passes, the Phoxes (2-4) withstood a late drive from the Finest (0-5-1) to come away with the close victo­ry. 
Farley wide receiver Lauren Kent had seven receptions for 115 yards in her team's loss. 
"Our girls are mostly fresh­men," Pangborn coach Robert Coly said. "We wanted to go out on a winning note. 
"It's good to have something to show at the end for the work 

-
we've done." 
After going three-and-out to start the game, Pangborn was forced to punt. Farley needed only three plays to score on their frrst drive, as quarterback Karrie Koski found Kent in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown. Koski passed to Kent again for the 1­point conversion. 
Pangborn would then answer the score in just three plays of their own. Quarterback Christina Dunn completed a short pass to wide receiver Mary Davis, who initially bobbled the ball before catching it and running in for a touchdown. The 1-point conver­sion failed, giving Farley a slim 7-6lead. 
The Finest would turn the ball over on downs at their own 38­yard_line, and Dunn went right back to work, scoring on a 9­yard touchdown run four plays later. The conversion attempt failed, making the score 12-7 in Pangborn's favor. 
Farley would come back to retake the lead before the half,

Irish win again, blank Butler 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 
In the first half of its gaine against Butler, the women's soccer team looked like a team that has now played five games in the past 10 days. But the second half was another story, as the Irish remained undefeated with a 3-0 win over Butler. 
"It's very tough," said sen­ior defender Melissa Tancredi of having played many games in a short peri­od. "So far we've been really good getting through it." 
The Irish, still No. 2 and now 12-0-1, have now won six games in a row since their lone tie of the year against Stanford. Since allowing a late goal against North Texas, they have shut out the last four teams to visit Alumni Field. 
Butler did not make it easy on the Irish at the beginning of the game, getting both of their shots in the opening minutes as the Irish got off to a sluggish start. 
"We tried to do the same

The Irish had only attempt­ed three shots in the first 32 minutes before midfielder Kim Carpenter continued her recent scoring surge after a failed clearance by the Bulldogs. The Irish were dominant in the second half, outshooting

Despite struggles, Irish still committed to the ground game 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
The last time the Irish offense took the field, fresh­man quarterback Brady Quinn threw for a season-high 297 yards, but the Irish only scored 13 points in a losing effort to Purdue. Even with the newly­found production through the air, the Notre Dame offense still struggled, due in a large part to its inability to establish a running game. 
"Throwing the football is great. It's exciting. Fans love it," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "But if you go by the statistics of it, usually if you're throwing for 300, 350­plus yards, with no running game, then you usually don't fare well." 
While Notre Dame made 62 pass attempts -the most since the 1960s -the offense strug­gled to move the ball on the ground. Notre Dame only

Belles play well, but lose in five 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 

The Belles again showed some of the form which helped them to an 8-4 start this season, but it wasn't quite enough to beat one of the best teams in the MIAA. 
Saint Mary's fell to Calvin at home Tuesday night in five sets, by the scores of 30-28, 28-30, 30-25, 21-30 and 13-15. 
The Knights (15-4, 8-1 in MIAA) came into the match tied for first in the MIAA. but they were able to fend off the Belles' (10-10, 2-6) upset attempt. 
"This game was 100 percent better than Saturday [when Saint Mary's lost to Kalamazoo in straight sets]." coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "It was an absolutely great match." 
It was also a better match than the last time the Belles played the Knights, on Sept. 9, when Saint Mary's lost in straight sets on the road.
