. Server crash prompts officials to change web registration times 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
News Writer 
The server that handles most of the University's primary administrative tasks overheated and crashed Wednesday morning, causing officials in the Registrar's office to reschedule the Web registration times for hundreds of juniors, graduate students and law students. 
In what one member of the registrar's office called tht~ worst registration-related situation that had occurred in over two decades, Hcgistrar Harold Pace announced Wednesday that registration times would be changed while the Office of Information Technologies

The registrar's decision to move regis­tration times could make a variety of weekend events significantly more compli­cated for students taking part in every­thing from athletics to practice MC/\T exams. 
Students who arc unable to register via computer during their rescheduled regis­tration time Friday or Saturday were encouraged to either have friends or par­ents register in their place or call the reg­istrar's office during the scheduled time with the course call numbers, said

Panel debates Iraq -war 
By KEVlN ALLEN 
News Writer 
Students and faculty packed the student lounge in the Coleman-Morse Center Wednesday to discuss the war in Iraq. 
/\ir Force HOTC Senior Andrew DeBerry and fresh­man Peter Quaranto, a mem­bc r of the Peace Coalition, helped organize the event. titled "Student Dialogue on the War in Iraq." 
"This is a complicated issue and a lot of good, moral peo­ple disagree on whether this war is just and legal," said Quaranto. Both pro-war and anti-war voices had a chance to be heard Wednesday. 
Participants noted the impact on their discussion of recent news coverage that showed liberated Iraqis embracing American and British troops as they marched on Baghdad. 
"Today is a good day to talk about how the war has gone because today we've taken a big step forward in finishing the war," said Daniel Philpotl, assistant professor of international relations, as he began an introduction to the many issues associated with the 
U.S. involvement in Iraq. 
The discussion centered on the issues of whether the war in Iraq is a just war, whether a preventive war can ever be considered just. prospects for establishing a healthy democracy in Iraq and the responsibilities of the Notre Dame community during this

Students sponsor bone marrow drive 
. Bone marrow drive hopes to register 1,000 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
In an attempt to register 1,000 blood donors, Howard Hall kicks oIT its third annual blood drive today, which will take place from 6-9 p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. 
The drive hopes to register 1,000 donors in the registry. The drive, which is also sponsored by the Minority Pre-Medical Association, will conduct the medical screening and blood work necessary to enter potential donors into the national bone marrow registry. The Shirt fund has completely subsidized the $60 per person cost. 
"It's an amazing gift of life," said Jessica Howell, a Notre Dame senior who worked on last year's bone marrow drive. 
l loward Hall co-commissioner Camilla Pollock said that adver­tisements and letters in The Observer as well as fliers and posters have helped advertise the drive. 
"The challenge is getting the word out," she said. 
Pollock said that she and other Howard I !all organizers mailed letters to all minoritv students in an attempt to encourage dona­tions. The national registry is especially low on minority donors and patients in need of bone marrow usually find a match from their specific race. According to the National Marrow Donor Program, out of 15,556 WU'elated marrow trans­plan ts, only 3,332 have been among minorities. 
"It's really important that we get a diverse population," said senior Ann Gurucharri, Howard Hall co-commissioner. "We are really trying to recruit minori­

Bone marrow drives save lives. Just ask senior Ann Gurucharri, co-commissioner of the Howard Hall bone marrow drive, and her father Vince Gurucharri, a 1967 Notre Dame graduate who was diag­nosed in December 2001 with Myelodysplastic Syndrome, a disease curable only with a bone marrow transplant. 
"It was because of drives like Notre Dame has that I have been given a chance again at life," Vince Gurucharri said. "Donors save lives." 
The class of 2002 sponsored the first bone marrow drive two years ago in honor of classmate Connor Murphy, who was diag­nosed with leukemia. Connor eventually found a match in the national registry and under­went a transplant, but died due to complications. Two other members of the Class of 2002 also died of leukemia. and numerous faculty, staff and alumni have been either direct­ly or indirectly affected by bone marrow drives. 

Because of Ann's personal connection with the need for marrow, she decided to orga­nize a bone marrow drive last year in the hopes of finding a match for her father, who failed to match with his 10 sib­lings. 
Ann said that doctors gave her father a one in one-million chance of finding a donor. 
The national bone marrow registry found Vince a donor after four months and complet­ed a successful bone marrow

INSIDE COLUMN 
Take pride
in the U.S. 

Upon watching the images of many Iraqi people exulting in the streets ofthe once-oppressed and now chaotic but free Iraq, it seems hard to fathom that the heart of even the staunchest 
Joe Llndsley 

opponent of this war would not feel the slightest surge Sports of American pride. Production And this American Editor pride-real American pride ­is not a mere jingoistic self-love. 
On the contrary, it is a humble, yet confident pride home ofthe securing of precious liberty for fellow humans. It is a nationally transcendent pride that expresses gratitude for the American blood, as well as that ofthe British and Iraqi civilians, that has been sacrificed so that others might be free, for there is no greater gift amongst men than to lay one's life down for another. 
Even the leader of French President Jacques Chirac's party, the Union for a Popular Movement, said that the American and British forces should be honored for their great courage. 
Such praise should not be bestowed superficially, and perhaps certain figures would do well to own up to their true colors. Many who opposed the war have strong principles upon which their oppo­sition is based. Whether or not they have right opinion, many of these pacifists and others are at least sincere in their con­victions. 
Others are not so candid. 
Much of the opposition to the American-led Iraqi liberation effort­and we can now truly call this liberation -stemmed from people who are not opposed to war itself. Instead, they are opposed to America and the values that she defends. 
While space prevents a digression, one should consider researching the true, though often obscured, motives and ide­ology of the U.N., France, Germany and others. 
The pending fall of Baghdad signals an important event in many ways. For the Iraqi people, it is that liberty which is so sweet that will now bring peace to their land. This was encapsulated in a pithy sign displayed by an Iraqi citizen yester­day: "Mr. Bush: Man of Peace." How ironic -perhaps. 
Secondly, for the world, the American effort is evidence that wherever evil is bred, its sources had better fear this mighty yet friendly nation in whom the oppressed can place their hope. 
America cannot accept all the tired and the huddled masses into its limited domain, but she can be a powerful force for protecting what is good in this world including herself. 
So today, ifyou live within the great bounds ofthis country or ifyou take joy in seeing the happiness ofthe Iraqi peo­ple, take a moment, and thank with the greatest sincerity the United States and her noble defenders, from the Commander-in-chief to the fallen heroes -for standing tall against the raging tides, for protecting us a.nd for sharing the beacon ofliberty with the rightfully exuberant Iraqi people.

Mock Trial attends competition 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 
Two Notre Dame teams placed fourth and fifth in their division at the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA) National Championship Tournament and three stu­dents received additional awards during the event. held April 3-6 in Des Moines, Iowa. 
The Notre Dame program was the only one to have two teams place top five in either division and it received the most individual awards of any of the 64 teams present, according to William Dwyer. Mock Trial coach and an attor­ney with the O'Hourke, Hogan. Fowler and Dwyer law firm. 
"We did remarkably well," Dwyer said. "It was quite an accomplishment." 
Members of the two teams included Dave Belczyk and Mike Romano. club co-presi­dents, and Erika Jackson, Erin Blonde!, Brenden Bowes, Brad Springman. Meghan McCall. Kristen Rodriguez, Vinnie Tenerelli. Jared Rizzi. Marlena Mangan. Katie Spitz, Leanor Cimino. Brandy 1-lutton and Brian Frey. 
Mike Homano also received the All American Attorney and All-American Witness awards. Vinnie Tenerelli and Brian Frey received All-American Attorney awards as well. 
Mock Trial allows college students to simulate court cases with team members serving as defense and prose­cuting attorneys and witnesses. The AMTA holds tournaments across the nation with over 300 universities participating. All the teams in a particular division try the same case, either criminal or civil, and fol­low a series of established rules. 
During the National Tournament, teams participat­ed in a mock civil lawsuit brought by the parents of a seven year-old killed by a hit­and-run driver. 
"The idea is you have to work within the framework of the case and the rules set up by the AMTA," Dwyer said. "They try to recreate a realistic environment in which the case is tried." 
Dwyer and Romano described the atmosphere of the tournament as intense and said participants spend several hours each week practicing in addition to a two-hour class that focuses on form and legal knowledge. 
"The students work enor­mously hard and there's a lot cf stress involved," Dwyer said. 
There are a total of 21 stu­dents in Notre Dame Mock

Romano credits the success of the organization to the tal­ent of the members and the coach and said he anticipates the teams will do well next year. 
"Next year we definitely want to maintain the program," he said. "This year we established ourselves by taking fourth and fifth in the tournament. I think we will be in a position to do very well next year." 
"I think this is great for our program," echoed Dwyer. "It really shows the caliber of tal­ent at Notre Dame."

Pace encouraged anyone with registration problems to contact the registrar's office. adding that the office would be open additional hours Friday and Saturday to assist with any registra­tion problems students might experience. 
As soon as Pace made the decision to postpone regis­tration, his office contacted at least three major groups -the band, which sched­uled a weekend tour to Detroit and Windsor, Canada, the organizers of the Rebuilding Together Now service project, former­ly called Christmas in April and the organization that runs a practice MCAT test ­to work out arrangements so students could register.

University Band Director Kenneth Dye said he was attempting to make accom­modations for 12 students who would be taking a trip with the concert band. He said he told students who could not do what the regis­trar suggested that they would either try to find an Internet connection on the road or have someone back in South Bend register for students.

Latimer estimated that the server failed again around 
7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, a half-hour before the first group of students was sched uled to register. 
As wave after wave of con­cerned students arrived at the registrar's office, Pace and the OIT staff established a 9 a.m. deadline to fix the problem before they decided to move the times. When it became clear that computer compo­nents would have to be replaced again, Pace told approximately 60 students out side the registrar's office of the move and sent out an e-mail about a half-hour later. 
Latimer said the OIT had no idea that the server, which was scheduled to be replaced in three years, was about to over­heat. A special technician was working Wednesday to replace most of the components in the server. 
"That's the characteristic of heat-related failure," Latimer said. "They show no symptoms until it fails. We thought we had a functional system." 
Both Pace and Latimer said they expected the server to be operational by Friday, but did not say what would happen if the server was not operational by then. 
Latimer said the OIT had a secondary server that would take at least eight hours to hook up and OIT officials were trying to decide whether to begin setting up the backup server. 
"Hindsight is 20-20 and had we known what we know now, we would have done it," he said. "But at this point, we're going to wait."

"We are not seejng any orga­nized resistance," said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp at the U.S. Central Command. "The Iraqi military is unable to light as an organized lighting force," 
There was continued combat in cities to the north, though, where government troops were under attack from U.S. and British warplanes. 
The scenes of liberation in Baghdad and celebrations in scattered other cities unfolded as the Pentagon announced that 101 American troops had died in the first three weeks of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Another 11 are missing and seven listed as captured. The British said 30 of their troops were dead. There arc no reliable estimates for Iraqi casualties, although an Army spokesman said 7,300 prisoners had boen taken. 
The medical system was over­run with civilian casualties in Basra and Baghdad, cities where some of the fiercest fight­ing has occurred. Doctors said 35 bodies and as many as 300 wounded Iraqis were brought to the al-Kindi hospital in the capi­tal Tuesday.

Iraq's UN envoy concedes defeat 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS 

With the fall of' Baghdad, Iraq's lJ.N. ambassador declared Wednesday. "the game is over" -and became the first Iraqi of'licial to concede defeat in the U.S.-lcd war. 
Mohammed Al-Douri expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace. 
'"My work now is peace," he told reporters outside his New York residence. "The game is over, and I hope the peace will prevail. I hope the Iraqi people will have a happy life." 
Al-Douri was asked what he meant when he said "the game is over." 
"The war," he responded. 
His comments were the first admission by an Iraqi official that coalition forces had over­whelmed Iraqi troops after a three-week campaign. 
In an AP interview Wednesday night, Al-Douri said he wiU continue to work at the United Nations and had no intention of defecting. 
"Defecting from who?" he asked. "'I think the government has already defected. There is no more Iraqi government to be defected from." 
Two weeks ago, during a heated U.N. debate, Al-Douri accused the United States of "criminal aggression" against Iraq and warned the U.S.-led coalition was "about to start a real war of extermination that will kill everything and destroy everything." 

He said U.S. and British forces were being "hoodwinked" into believing "that the Iraqi people would receive them with flowers and hugs," 
The outburst caused U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte to walk out of the open Security Council meeting, saying he'd "heard enough." 
On Wednesday, when asked about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Al-Douri said he had no "relationship with Saddam." 
"I have no communication with Iraq," the ambassador said. 
Questioned about Al-Douri's comments, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said: "Well, I would say it wasn't a game." 
US: Saddam was likely in bombed building 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
U.S. special operations forces on Wednesday scoured the site of a Baghdad building leveled by American bombs, searching for evidence that Saddam Hussein was inside at the time of the blasts, officials said. 
The team is looking for remains or other evidence to prove that the four tons of bombs dropped on the building Monday hit the Iraqi leader, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Multiple intelligence sources put Saddam inside the building in the capital's tony Mansour neigh­borhood before it was hit, other 

U.S. officials said. 

Intelligence officials described the information that led to Monday's strike as solid but did not provide details. One source was believed lo be an eyewitness who watched Saddam go inside the building. 
The officials stopped well short of declaring Saddam dead. 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld laid out several possi­bilities: '"He's not active. Therefore, he's either dead, or he's incapacitated, or he's healthy and cowering in some tunnel someplace trying to avoid being caught"

Anonymity prevents a transplant recipient from learning the identity of their donor until one year after the transplant. but Ann said that she could not adequately express her desire to meet the donor who saved her father's life. 
"On my graduation day, we get to find out who [the donor isl," she said. "We've been writing letters to [the donor] and I'm really hoping that I can meet him [or her.] I just don't know how you can thank some­one like that." 
Ann said that last year's bone marrow drive, which success­fully registered 642 potential donors into the national reg­istry, testified to the willingness of the Notre Dame community to come together in service to help others. 
"The day of the drive was amazing because in the midst of a semester that was personally trying, this was a moment when I had the support of my class [and others] for a total stranger. It gave me hope in the people around me. For me, this was the hope that I needed to get through it all," she said. 
Ann said that this year's bone marrow drive, being held today in the LaFortune Ballroom from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., is prepared to register 1,000 people into the national bone marrow registry. The procedure consists of a brief medical screening and blood test, which takes about 15 minutes. The cost, typically $60 per person, is subsidized through funding from The Shirt project. 
Patricia Brubaker, assistant director of University Health Services and a registered nurse, volunteered her time last year to draw blood for testing. She attributed the success of last year's drive to volunteers from Health Services and the South Bend Medical Foundation who donated time and supplies. Brubaker, whose sister was a recipient of a bone marrow transplant, said that last year's student response was surpris­ing to her. 
"I was overwhelmed with the response from the students. People were very kind and I was impressed by that," she said.

Howard Hall is currently rais­ing funds to start an endow­ment to ensure that the bone marrow drive will be continu­ously self-funded in the future. 
Next year Howard Hall resi­dents may request part of their housing fee go towards the endowment fund and organiz­ers say they are exploring other fund raising options. like foot­ball concession stands and the solicitation of Howard Hall alumnae for donations. 
Brannock said the importance of an annual bone marrow drive remains paramount. 
"It's just important that we do [the bone marrow drive] every year," she said. "Who knows how many people we could help on this campus. Who knows when you may need [marrow] or someone you know may need it," she said. 
Co-commissioner Camilla Pollock will head the project next year after Ann graduates. Each year, a Howard senior and a junior spearhead the bone marrow drive so that one member will have experience in planning for the upcoming year. 
Pollock, who has a blood dis­order and has had bone mar­row extracted for testing. said that she understands the fear that many potential donors have about registering. 
"All the questions that people have about being a donor I can answer because I have gone through all of the medical test­ing." she said. 
Jessica Howell, a senior who worked on the drive last year, said that the number of people who volunteered to register astonished her. She talked about students who went in between their classes, braved long lines and frequently checked back multiple times in the day in order to register. 
"I was most struck that in times of need the Notre Dame community never fails to come together. It's an example of support and selfless giving," she said. 
Chris DesBarres, a volunteer and donor at last year's drive, said that the outpouring of sup­port was strong. 
"I was working there at the end and people were still lined up down the staircase waiting to donate. Even when we ran out of needles, people were reluctant to leave," said DesBarres. "It was a great way for the Notre Dame community to demonstrate its willingness to step in and help, even when the people you're helping are complete strangers," he said. 

Howell said that she wanted to register last year but could not when supplies ran out. She said that she is excited to regis­ter this year and believes that the extra capacity this year will be sufficient. 
"Sprits were very high. The most disappointing [problem last year] was seeing when we ran out of vials and tests and had to turn people away," said Howell. "So many people had really been wanting to get on the list," she said. 
Ann mentioned that only stu­dents who arc committed to the possibility of giving bone mar­row should register today. 
"Joining the registry should be thought of as a commitment to donate. It's devastating for a family to think they've found a match [and have the donor refuse to donate]," she said. 
Ann also said that students should not be deterred or frightened by the bone marrow extraction procedure. 
"It is slightly painful, but you're saving a life. Where is the choice to be made?" Ann said. 
The two previous bone mar­row drives held at Notre Dame have resulted in one successful match. One more donor is in the final stages of the testing process and six more donors have been contacted for further testing. 
There are currently over 3,000 patients in the United States searching for a matching bone marrow donor.

Saint Mary's plans swim1ning lessons 
Money raised will benefit
. Swim team to 

the Saint Mary's Swim rundteach kids and may help fund a winter ------------training trip, training equip­
By LAUREN O'BRIEN 
News Writer 

Throughout this month, members of the Saint Mary's swimming and diving team will hold swimming lessons for children in the South Bend community. 
Though swimming lessons were not available last year, they have been offered in the past, said Greg Petcoff. coach of the swim team and assis­tant director of athletics at the College. 
When Petcoff came to Saint Mary's in the fall of 2001, he decided to take a one-year break from offering the swim lessons to work on reorganiz­ing the program. 
This year, Petcoff enlisted the help of junior Amy Kleinfehn. a newly-elected co-captain of the team, and together they created a les­son plan for the 4-week pro­gram. 
The swim lessons were mostly advertised in South Bend parochial schools, but they are open to the entire South Bend community. Nearly 70 children partici­pate in the lessons, which cost $50 for eight sessions. 
According to Kleinfehn, teaching swimming lessons during the team's off-season serves multiple purposes. 
"Nearly everyone on the team has taught swim lessons before," Kleinfehn said. "It is a good way to raise money and bond as a team." 
ment or allow the team to travel to a swim meet in Wisconsin, which would give Saint Mary's the opportunity to compete against more Division III schools. 
Pctcoff said he realizes that a winter training trip to a warmer location could bene­fit the swim team. 
The most difficult obstacle the team faces is finding ade­quate training facilities. While the team takes advan­tage of Notre Dame facilities in the evening, morning prac­tices are held in Saint Mary's Regina Hall Pool. 
"When it comes down tu it, it is a question of what is going to help us to be more competitive," said Petcoff. "Making us better will win out over something that is nice." 
In addition to strengthening the College's swim program, sophomore Amy Nicholson views the lessons as unique opportunity to interact with children. 
"A lot of women on the swim team are education majors," Nicholson said. "The lessons give us a chance to interact with kids, as well as providing a possibility for us to see each other in the off­season." 
Due to the success of the lessons, Kleinfehn said there is a possibility the team will hold lessons again in the fall.

IN BRIEF 
Airline deal receives early OK 
American Airlines and British Airways will be able to sell seats on each other's flights unless public opposition convinces transporta­tion officials otherwise. 
The Transportation Department said Wednesday that it has tentatively approved a code-sharing agreement between the two air­lines, except for nonstop flights between the United States and London. 
The public hasn't been allowed to comment on the proposal. though, so the Transportation Department will accept writ­ten objections for a week. 
Code-sharing allows airlines to reach more places without flying more planes and to offer reciprocal benefits. American and British Airways already had an agreement to allow their customers to earn and redeem frequent Byer points on each others' airlines. 
The airlines said they plan to begin code­sharing as soon as transportation officials issue a linal order, expected sometime after April 21.

News Corp. to acquire Hughes 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 
News Corp. agreed Wednesday to acquire control of Hughes Electronics Corp. and its DirecTV service, the nation's largest satellite television provider, in a $6.6 billion cash and stock deal. 
The proposed deal would give News Corp. access to DirecTV's more than 11 million subscribers and conclude media titan Rupert Murdoch's three-year effort to gain a U.S. outlet for his global satellite television network. 
News Corp. will acquire 34 percent of DirecTV parent Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.. by purchasing 19.9 percent of Hughes shares owned by GM. News Corp. also will offer to buy 14.1 percent of Hughes shares owned by the public. 
News Corp. will pay about $14 per share, making the deal worth about $6.6 billion. The company will then transfer its interest in Hughes to its Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary, which includes the Fox News Channel. 
Murdoch, whose News Corp. also owns other media entities and the Los Angeles Dodgers, said the deal will kets and provide better services to 

U.S. viewers. 
"With Fox taking a significant inter­est in Hughes, we are forging what we believe will be the premier diversified entertainment company in America today, with leading assets in film, tele­vision broadcasting and production, cable programming, and now pay-TV distribution," Murdoch said. 
GM president and chief executive Rick Wagoner said his company "is pleased to have reached an agreement with News Corp. that provides sub­stantial value to our stockholders." 
In addition to DirecTV. Hughes also owns 81 percent equity of satellite operator PanAmSat and Hughes Network Systems, a broadband satel­lite network provider. 
Murdoch unsuccessfully wooed DirecTV in 2001. EchoStar Communications, a rival satellite broadcaster, tried to buy Hughes for $18.8 billion. but that deal was blocked late last year by federal regu­lators who felt iL would harm competi­tion. 
The News Corp. deal is aL'lo subject to regulatory approval. The new company will provide 
form to all suppliers" and will not be exclusive to Fox or News Corp. prod­ucts, Murdoch said in a conference call. 
At their convention in Las Vegas, members of the National Association of Broadcasters gave the acquisition a generally positive response, saying it likely would prod satellite operators to carry local stations more quickly. The trade group had opposed the Hughcs­EchoStar merger because it would have reduced competition and pres­sure to carry local stations in small<lr markets. 
Under the agreement, Murdoch would become chairman of Hughes and Chase Carey, who currently serves as an adviser to News Corp., would become president and chief executive officer of Hughes. The com­pany would continue lo be based in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo. 
Hughes shares, which trade sepa­rately from those of General Motors, fell 2 cents to $11.48 in regular trad­ing before the deal was announced, but gained 36 cents in extended trad­ing. News Corp. shares fell 66 cents in regular trading to $27.22 each but rose 50 cents in the after-hours ses­
sion.

time. 
A four-person panel offered diverse perspectives from ROTC, Peace Coalition, Young Republicans and International Students. The panel was mod­erated by Philpott, who is also a faculty fellow at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. After the pan­elists were finished discussing the planned part of the dia­logue, the floor was opened up to questions from the audi­ence. 
One panel member. Mary Ann Mazzarini, a senior and the wing commander in Air Force ROTC. gave possible positives and negatives that could come from the situation. She said that although the Iraqi people have been liberat­ed from a brutal dictator, the United States has set a danger­ous precedent by preemptively attacking Iraq. Actions by the United States could possibly discredit the United Nations, but that could also motivate them to enforce their rules more strictly. Mazzarini added. 
Catherine McGeeney, a member of the Peace Coalition, took issue with classifying American military involvement as a humanitarian mission to liberate oppressed Iraqis. 
"Why do we continue to sup­port regimes that are just as bad or worse than Saddam Hussein's?" she said. 
McGeeney pointed to exam­ples of human rights violations in Israel and Turkey, both U.S. allies, which have not been addressed. McGeeney also said the war has been a distraction from more urgent domestic affairs, such as the struggling economy. 
When addressing the issue of what the Notre Dame commu­nity can do at this time, McGeeney also said it would be important for students to inform themselves by using several sources for news, not just American, and by promot­ing dialogue on the issue. 
Mohamed Shehab El Din. a peace studies graduate student from Egypt, began his speech on the panel by requesting that everyone reserve a moment of silence to honor the victims of war. He then assert­ed that more resistance ~y

Iraqis is imminent as well as casualties. "The war is not over," said Shehab. "This is just a stage." 
"The way [the war in Iraq] is viewed in the Islamic world and the Arab world right now is that 'it's a crusade,"' Shehab said. 
Shehab said that no one in the Arab world argue against the fact that the Hussein regime is corrupt, but they are extremely wary of the American presence in the region. He added that he is encouraged by youth and stu­dent opposition to the war. 
Mark Hayes, former presi­dent of College Republicans, rounded out the panel. Hayes pointed to the possible connec­tions between Hussein and ter­rorist networks and the subse­quent dangers to American national security as justifica­tion for the war. 
As a follow-up to Wednesday's dialogue, stu­dents will also have the oppor­tunity to discuss the war in open lunch discussions on Thursdays in April, starting today, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the South Dining Hall Hospitality Room.

Guruchani organized last year's project because her father Vince was diagnosed ½'ith myelodyplas­tia, a disease curable only by a bone marrow transplant. Vince successfully underwent a trans­plant May 15. 2002. 
"The day of the drive, even when the lines were really long, everyone was so patient and will­ing to be there. It was great," she said. 
Last year's bone marrow drive was a continuation of the project begun two years ago by the class of 2002 in hopes of finding a match for three classmates diag­nosed with leukemia. Over the past two years, one successful match has been made. One addi­tional donor is in the final stage of the matching process and six more arc in preliminary testing stages. 
"Students don't really realize how prevalent [the need for bone marrow is] on campus," Pollock said. 
Pollock will head the project next year, along with a Howard Hall member of the class of 2005, after Gurucharri graduates. The residents are currently raising funds to begin an endowment that will provide for future funding for the bone marrow drive. 
"People only hear about the drive the week before but it really is a 52 week commitment," Pollock said. 
Chicago and South Bend heath care professionals, as well as stu­dent volunteers, will be available to perform the blood tests, med­ical screening and paperwork necessary for donor registration. Participants in today's drive will be registered up to age 61.

Man killed tourist, convicted of murder 
Associated Press 
ROCKVILLE, Md. 
Jurors Wednesday convicted a former Navy SEAL of killing one of two tourists whose dismem­bered bodies were found last year after they disappeared during a Memorial Day trip to the beach. 
Benjamin Sifrit was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Martha Crutchley but acquitted of assaulting and murdering her boyfriend, Joshua Ford. 
Prosecutors say the two were slain after Sifrit's wife claimed her purse had been stolen while the couples partied at the Sifrits' condo. 
Ford's brother and other rela­tives sat stunned in the court­room after the verdict was read. 
'Tm totally disgusted," Mark Ford said. "He took away a good brother, a very loving, trustwor­thy friend to everybody and this guy walks." 
Sifrit, 25. testified that he was asleep when Crutchley and Ford were killed, but that he dismem­bered the couple to help his wife, Erika, cover up the slay­ings. 
Sifrit also was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. His trial, like the one scheduled in June for his 25­year-old wife, was moved out of Worcester County because of extensive pretrial publicity. 
Prosecutors said Crutchley 


and Ford, of Fairfax, Va., met the Altoona, Pa., couple May 25 on a bus in Ocean City in south­eastern Maryland. The four went to a bar before returning to the Sifrits' condominium to use the hot tub. 
When Erika Sifrit claimed her purse was missing, her husband went into a rage against the vic­tims, prosecutors said. 
Crutchley, 51, and Ford, 32, fled into the bathroom, but prosecutors said Benjamin Sifrit shot Ford through the door, kicked it in and shot him two more times. 
Sifrit said he cut the bodies into sections, wrapped them in plastic and dumped them in a trash bin outside a Delaware supermarket. The remains were found in a landfill days later. 
Sifrit faces a possible 30-year sentence for the murder convic­tion and five years for the acces­sory charge. He was also con­victed of first-degree assault against Crutchley. 
Sifrit's attorney, William Brennan, said his client was acquitted in Ford's slaying prob­ably because the gun used belonged to Erika Sifrit. 
The decision was especially difficult for Mark Ford, whose 23-year-old daughter Kelly was murdered, decapitated and had her heart removed by a serial killer two years ago. Nu one has been convicted of that crime, he said. 
"I've yet to receive any jus­tice," he said. 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Praising the advantages of an environmental law it has criti­cized, the Bush administration announced agreements Wednesday with Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Alcoa Inc. to reduce air pollution in 16 states. 
The settlements under the "new source review" provisions of the Clean Air Act will result in nearly $680 million in spending to reduce about 130,000 tons of air pollution a year. Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department officials said. 
''I'm willing to admit that this has been a very good too]." 
EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said of those provi­sions, which her agency changed last year. "But it's not the best we can do." 
Whitman and Assistant Attorney General Tom Sansonelti emphasized they will strongly pursue cases such as these even as the adminis­tration seeks further changes in the law. 
ADM, of Decatur, Ill., the nation's biggest ethanol pro­ducer, agreed to spend an esti­mated $350.9 million to settle charges it failed to accurately count emissions and expanded corn and oilseed processing facilities without installing proper pollution controls. 
The settlement filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois includes $213 million for new pollution con­trols over the next decade at 52 plants in 16 states. 

Those states are Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. 
It also includes $127 million to change the way it processes corn and oilseeds and to con­duct environmental audits at all its facilities. Another $6.3 million will be spent to retrofit diesel engines in school buses and $4.6 million will go to a civil penalty. 
Sansonetti said the case builds on last year's settlement with 12 ethanol plants in 
Minnesota, the first time the federal government reached agreements mandating cuts in air pollution from manufactur­ers of com-based ethanol, an additive in gasoline. 
Alcoa. Inc. of Pittsburgh, the world's largest aluminum pro­ducer, cast doubt on the $334.75 million settlement fig­ure provided by the govern­ment. The Alcoa settlement ­which grew from a citizen group's complaint that its Rockdale, Texas, power plant improperly made changes that increased pollution -was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. 
Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said it might be cheap­er to close that coal-fired power plant and get energy elsewhere for its aluminum smelting facility there rather than spend the $330 million the government estimated it would cost to install new boil­ers. 
But the company will spend $2.5 million for conservation easements around the plant and $750,000 to retrofit school buses in Austin, Texas, and pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. 
Whitman said the agree­ments would reduce by 68,000 tons a year from Alcoa and by 63,000 tons a year from ADM emissions of air pollutants such as smog-causing nitrogen oxides and acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide. Sansonetti called it the first settlement of its kind involving the grain and oilseed processing industry. 
-highly conscious of anything that could be interpreted as a sign of American occupation ­ordered Chin, 23, to take it down. He then replaced it with an Iraqi flag.

SAUDI ARABIA 
Democratic candidates Citizens shocked by US ascension divided on war in Iraq 
. Fall of Baghdad met by disbelief in the Arab world 
Associatc<l Press 
H.IYADH 

The rail of Baghdad provoked 
shock and disbelief among 
Arabs, who exprusscd hope that 
other oppressive regimes would 
crumble but also disappointment 
that Saddam Hussein did not put 
up a better fight against 
America. 
''Why did he fall that way" 
Why so fast?" asked Yemeni 
homemaker Umm Ahmed, tears 
streaming down her face. "He's 
a coward. Now I feel sorry for 
his people." 
Arabs clustered at TV sets in 
shop windows, coffee shops, 
kitchens and oflices to watch the 
astounding pictures of U.S. 
troops overwhelming an Arab 
capital for the first time ever. 
Feeling betrayed and misled, 
sonw turned off their sets in dis­
gust when jubilant crowds in 
Baghdad celebrated the arrival 
of U.S. troops. 
"We discovered that all what 
the [Iraqi! information minister 
was saying was all lies," said Ali 
I lassan, a government employee 
in Cairo, Egypt. "Now no one 
believes Al-Jazeera anymore." 
In a live report from Baghdad, 
corrnspondcnt Shaker Hamed of /\bu Dhabi Television said, "We are all in shock. I low did things -come to such an end? How did 
U.S. tanks enter the center of the city? Where is the resistance? This collapse is puzzling. Was it the result of the collapse of com­munications between the com­manders? Between the political leadership? How come Baghdad falls so easily." 
The shock came after weeks of hearing Saddam's government pledge a "great victory" or fight to the death against "infidel invaders." 
"We Arabs are clever only at talking," Haitham Baghdadi. 45. said bitterly in Damascus, Syria. "Where are the Iraqi weapons? Where are the Iraqi soldiers?" 
Behind the disbelief lay a worry over the prospect of an American occupation of an Arab nation. 
However, Tannous Basil, a 47­year-old cardiologist in Sidon, Lebanon, said Saddam's regime was a "dictatorship and had to go." 
"I don't like the idea of having the Americans here, but we asked for it," he said. "Why don't we see the Americans going to Finland. for example? They come here because our area is filled with dictatorships like Saddam's." 
Tarek al-Absi, a Yemeni uni­versity professor, was hopeful Saddam's end presaged more democracy in the region. 
"This is a message for the Arab regimes. and could be the beginning of transformation in the Arab region," al-Absi said. "Without the honest help of the Western nations, the reforms will not take place in these coun­tries." 
From Kuwait, which was occu­pied by Saddam's forces before the 1991 Gulf War, came one of the few statements of unadulter­ated support. Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah, Kuwait's deputy prime minister and for­eign minister, said, "Joy fills our hearts as we see our Iraqi broth­ers ... express their jubilation at victorv." 

In comments carried by state­owned Kuwait Television, he praised "the huge sacrifices made by the coalition" to free Iraqis. 
But for most Arabs, the over­whelming emotions were those of distaste and worry. 
Three men having tea and smoking in a coffee shop in Riyadh were unsettled as they watched television, even though they said they were against Saddam and felt sorry for the long-suffering Iraqis. 
"l can't say that I'm happy about what's going on because these are non-Muslim forces that have gone in and I hope they will not stay," said Mohammed al­Sakkaf. a 58-year-old business­man. 
Another of the three, Walid Abdul-Rahman, said he was dis­turbed by the sight of U.S. troops lounging in Saddam's palaces or draping the U.S. nag around the head of a Saddam statue. "Liberation is nobler than that," he said. "They should not be so provocative." 
In Jordan, hotel receptionist Wissam Fakhoury, 28, expressed disgust at the Baghdad crowds. 
"I spit on them," he said. "Do those crowds who are saluting the Americans believe that the United States will let them live better?" Fakhoury said. "[AmericansJ will loot their oil and control their resources, leaving them nothing." 
Bahraini physician Hassan Fakhro, 62, said he was sad­dened because even if Saddam "was a dictator, he represented some kind of Arab national resistance to the foreign invaders -the Americans and the British."

WASHINGTON 
On the day Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed, divisions over the war in Iraq took center stage in the first joint appear­ance of the nine candidates run­ning for the Democratic presi­dential nomination. 
The candidates intended to lay out their agendas on chil­dren's issues at a forum spon­sored by the Children's Defense Fund. But with U.S. military advances dominating the news, the first question from a panel of journalists 
Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich. former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun and civil rights activist Al Sharpton of New York also maintained their opposition to the war. "I do not see where we have seen the nuclear weapons that we were told wern there," Sharpton said. 
The war has been a delicate issue for Democrats since many core party activists oppose it. But polls show most Americans are behind Bush's effort in Iraq, and some say a tough stance against the war could hurt his opponent in the general elec­
tion.

"For $200 billion we can insure every child in this coun­try under the age of 18," said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who opposed going to war without U.N. backing. "It seems to me like that is a better invest­ment." 
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, making his first appearance as a presidential candidate, said he voted against the resolution granting authority for the mili­tary strike because he felt the 
, war would make Americans less secure. He said the United States should focus on pursuing the shadowy group of interna­tional terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks instead of Saddam Hussein. 
"Saddam Hussein is an evil person," Graham said. "He lives in a neighborhood with lots of evil people. The question is where do we put our priorities." 
Massachusetts 

and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut ­were asked whether the costs of the war will hurt domestic pro­grams. 
Gephardt said the war would create larger deficits. but as president he would roll back almost al! or Bush's tax cuts and fund health care for every American. 
"It's the moral thing to do, it's the right thing to do and as president I will get it done," he said. 
Lieberman and Edwards said there shouldn't be a choice between war and domestic pro­grams. "It's actually the respon­sibility of the president of the United States to do two things at one time," Edwards said. 
"If we pull back the tax cut, we could both protect our secu­rity and provide a better life for our children," Lieberman said. 
Kerry said that although he voted for the resolution and sup­ported disarmament of Saddam, he does not support the way that Bush went to war without more international support.

IRAQ 

Kurds In Northem Iraq celebrate the falling of Baghdad to Amerlcan troops. Kurd forces, In coalltlon with American forces, hope to gain control of strategic cities like Mosul and Klrkuk. 
Kurds rejoice as Baghdad falls 
A,sociated Press 
BAGHDAD 

Iraqi Kurds flooded the streets of northern Iraq on Wednesday, rejoicing in the downfall of President Saddam Hussein -a leader who had gassed them and executed them by the thou­sands. 
"He's gone! He's gone!" chant­

ed a group of boys dancing in 
stalled traffic. As news spread 
that U.S. troops had overtaken 
the Iraqi capital Baghdad, 
Kurds left their homes and 
waded onto streets, waving 
streamers and the yellow star­
burst flag of their autonomous 
region. 
But fighting in the north was 

not over, and strategic oil fields 
near the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk remained under Iraqi control. 
Backed by U.S. Special Forces and American-led warplanes, Kurdish fighters took a strategic peak near Mosul and were just outside Kirkuk, but it wasn't clear when coalition troops would attack those key areas. 
That did not stop tens of thou­sands of Kurds from basking in the moment of Baghdad's fall to coalition troops. 
In the Kurdish administrative capital of Irbil, joy came in many guises. Car horns blared. Boys waved hand-drawn American flags. Militiamen held their weapons overhead. 
People burned newspaper 
photos of Saddam. One car 
windshield carried a message written in soap: "Bye Bye, Saddam." A cartoon showed Saddam falling into a garbage bin. 

"There is joy today, but let's not forget we've all shed tears because of Saddam," said actor Uman Chowshin. "We cannot never forget what he's done to 
US.11 

Saddam's regime has long oppressed the 4 million Kurds living in northern Iraq, despite occasional alliances of conve­nience between Kurdish leaders and Saddam's regime. In the late 1980s, more than 150,000 Kurds are believed to have been killed by the Iraqi leader's orders. In 1988, in the town of Halabja, a poison chemical attack wiped out an estimated 5,000 residents. 
Wall Street pulls back as troops move ahead 
Associaced Press 
NEW YORK 

Wall Street pulled back Wednesday after investors' elation about a quick end to the war with Iraq dissolved into concerns about corporate profits. Stocks tumbled sharply with the Dow Jones industrials forfeiting 100 points. 
"The market has been 
absolutely thrilled about an 
imminent end for arguably 
[these] first three weeks of 
the war. We started the stock 
rally before the war started," 
said Arthur Hogan, chief mar­
ket analyst at Jefferies & Co. 

"Unfortunately, when 
investors stop celebrating 
they will have to focus on cor­
porate profits, which may not 
be so jubilant," he said. 

The Dow closed down 
100.98, or 1.2 percent, at 
8,197.94. 

The broader market also 
foll. The Nasdaq composite 
index dropped 26.20, or 1.9 
percent, to 1,356.74. The 
Standard & Poor's 500 index 
fell 12.30, or 1.4 percent, to 
865.99. 

Wall Street welcomed news 
from the U.S. military that 
Saddam Hussein's govern­
ment is no longer in control of 
Baghdad and TV footage 
showing joyous crowds 
swarming the city and defac­
ing images of Saddam. 

But the market's ability to 
advance was impeded by 
first-quarter earnings, which 
companies began releasing 
this week. Profits are expect­
ed to be mostly disappointing. 
due to the detrimental effect of the war on the economy and in turn, corporate perfor­mance. 
Wall Street has failed this week to gain upward momen­tum despite encouraging news on the war front, including rumors Tuesday that Saddam was dead. The Dow dipped 1.49 Tuesday, having risen a modest 23.26 on Monday. 

"For weeks, the only game in town was Iraq. We have gotten to the point where it is not over but in the last quar­ter. Investors are now looking for the next thing that will drive the market," said Chris Johnson, manager of quanti­tative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. "The economy is still not good. For the past few weeks, we were able to ignore that as the market focused on success in Iraq." 
While investors will likely 
send certain shares lower 
when first-quarter earnings 
disappoint them. stocks are 
more vulnerable to weak pre­
dictions about the second 
quarter, which companies are 
likely to make, citing higher 
energy costs and decreased 
consumer spending in the 
wake of the war. 

"The market needs to hear 
that the next quarter is it," 
said Johnson, referring to a 
return to profitability. 
"Unfortunately, the current 
events in the market are 
going to keep that from hap­
pening." 

Decliners included Knight 
Ridder, which fell $1.5 5 to 
$58.81 after reporting quar­
terly profits that fell short of 
estimates.

UN refuses US demand to probe N. Korea 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK 

The U .N. Security Council r«'fused Wednesday to act on a U.S. request to condemn North Korea for pulling out of a trr.aty to curb nuclear weapons because of strong opposition from China and Hussia. 
But U.S. Ambassador John Nugroponte called the coun­cil's expression of concern "an acceptable outcome." He expressed hope that North Korea "will not reject diplo­matic efforts to address its nuclear program" and warned Pyongyang against any "fur­ther cscalatory steps." 
At the heart of the dispute is North Korea's insistence on direct talks with the United States. which it views as a threat to its security. 
The Bush administration. which has called North Korea part of an "axis of evil" along with Iran and Iraq, insists that the problem be addressed in a multilateral 
forum, including countries threatened by Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
China, Russia. the European Union and Secretary-General Kofi Annan have tried to get North Korea and the United States to the negotiating table. U.N. envoy Maurice Strong, who just returned from Pyongyang, said Tuesday both sides now agree to hold direct and multilateral talks, but haven't agreed on the for­
mat. 
North Korea has warned that any Security Council action would undermine peace efforts and it has reit­erated several times that it would regard U.N. sanctions as a declaration of war. 
With such high stakes. council members chose to take no action, hoping to instead find an acceptable framework for talks. 
"Members of the council expressed their concern" about the nuclear issue, said council president Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, Mexico's U .N. ambassador. "The council will continue to follow up develop­ments of this matter. There is nothing else to add to this." 

China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday the Security Council had no business dis­cussing North Korea's nuclear program. 
Leaving Wednesday's meet­ing, China's U.N. Ambassador, Wang Yingfan, said, "I think it was a good discussion. All the efforts are being done, and 
will continue,  to  promote  
political dialogue  - that's  
what I stressed."  

"The only way the problem is going to be solved is direct bilateral dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang, and whatever multilateral for­mats are used should be in addition to this," said Russia's 
U.N. Ambassador. Sergey Lavrov. 
The standoff began in October when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted it had a clandestine nuclear program. North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Pak Gil Yon called the report "a rumor." 
Washington suspended fuel shipments that were part of a 1994 agreement with the United States that froze North Korea's nuclear program. The North retaliated by expelling 
U.N. nuclear monitors and withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as of Thursday. 
It then took steps to restart its frozen nuclear program, saying it would be limited, for the moment, to peaceful pur­poses such as electricity pro­duction. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency referred the issue of North Korea's with­drawal to the council in February. 
Even though the council did not agree on a statement of condemnation, Negroponte 
said  the  outcome  of  
Wednesday's meeting was  
"acceptable."  

"Diplomatic contacts ... are taking place bilaterally, multi­laterally, between all the countries in the region around the Korean peninsula -China, Japan, South Korea and so forth," he said.

Ex-CEO 
rejects charges 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Fired HealthSouth CEO 
Richard Scrushy refused to 
answer questions in federal 
court Wednesday about 
claims the company overstat­
ed earnings by $2.5 billion lo 
meet Wall Street expecta­
tions. 
Scrushy faced more than 
50 questions from Bill I licks 
of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission but 
repeatedly invoked his Fifth 
Amendment right to avoid 
self-incrimination. 
The SEC filed suit last 
month accusing Scrushy and 
the health care giant he 
founded of overstating earn 
ings. The hearing was to 
determine whether Scrushy's 
personal assets should 
remain frozen while the gov­
ernment investigates what it 
calls a massive accounting 
fraud at HealthSouth. 
Scrushy, who has denied wrongdoing, will be charged in a criminal indictment "that is about to drop," defense attorney Tom Sjoblom told the judge. U.S. Attorney Alice Martin wouldn't comment on whether Scrushy would be charged criminally. 
Eight former HealthSouth executives already have pleaded guilty and a ninth has agreed to. 
Scrushy already has given a sworn statement in the case, and the government revealed it has a recording of him made secretly by a for­mer HealthSouth executive who is helping investigators. 
Government lawyers said Scrushy has requested about $10 million in living expens­es, plus $60 million for legal fees and tax payments. Sjoblom wouldn't let Scrushy tell Hicks why he needed so much money, but Scrushy's lawyers did not contest the amount. 
Other former HealthSouth officials testified at Scrushy's hearing in a government effort to show it has a rea­sonable chance of winning the civil case. The hearing was set to continue Thursday. 
Diana Henze, the compa­ny's former assistant vice president for finance, testi­fied that she went to then­chief financial officer William 
T. Owens with suspicions about accounting fraud in spring 1999. 
Henze said Owens, who has pleaded guilty to crimi­nal fraud charges, told her changes had to be made to meet earnings forecasts to keep the company's stock prices up or "people would lose their jobs."

Senate passes tax cuts for donations to charities 
Associated rress 
WASIIINGTON 

Abandoning President Bush's larger "faith-based initiative," the Senate passed scaled-back legislation Wednesday granting new tax breaks for charitable donations. 
The initiative began as an effort to open government pro­grams LO churches, synagogues and other religious organiza­tions, but that proved so con­tentious that backers dropped every one of these provisions from the bill. 
The revised measure was approved 95-5. 
It now simply provides a vari­ety of tax breaks for charity donations, including a break for contributors who do not itemize on their taxes. It also provides $1.3 billion more over two years for the Social Services Block Grant, a favorite of Democrats. 
The White House said it sup­port~ many elements of the bill but "strongly opposes" the increased money for the social services program. President Bush suggested he wanted to see changes to more closely reflect his proposals. 
"America's charities face tough times, and we can do more to support their efforts," Bush said in a statement. "I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the CAHE Act legislation." 
llis words contrasted state­ments by Senate backers, who characterized their action as the final compromise. 
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., 
called Bush's move a "major reversal." 
"I cannot understand why the Administration would do such a divisive thing and undermine the harmony we achieved with this strongly bipartisan, high­constructive bill we passed today," Lieberman said in a statement. 
It was unclear what the bill's fate would be in the House, or whether the Senate would sup­port a hill that includes more of

to $500. To keep the cost down, the new tax deduction would expire in two years. 
The bill also gives tax breaks for corporate donations, allows tax-free donations from Individual Retirement Accounts and encourages banks to offer Individual Development Accounts, which match the sav­ings of low-income people 
It provides $150 million for a new fund to help small chari­ties, including religious groups, expand their programs. 
The vote Wednesday came after more than two years of sometimes angry debate in Congress about the role of reli­gious groups using tax dollars. 

Lieberman said he was "proud and in some sense relieved" to arrive at the vote. 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.. the other lead sponsor, said the bill would encourage charitable giving and therefore support religious groups, as well as sec­ular ones, that will receive more contributions. 
"It's really a great day for those who have been working hard, committing their lives in some of the most difficult 
organiza­
tions." 

Santorum also argued that the Bush administration has suc­ceeded in rewriting government regulations to open programs to religious groups, making legisla­tion less urgent. Santorum also promised to revisit the issue when a bill renewing the wel­fare program comes to the floor later this year. 
The Senate dismissed an amendment backed by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., to give people who sell land for conservation a break on capital gains. That vote was 62-38. 
That was the only amendment considered, with other objec­tions to the bill dismissed after 
the controversial parts were stripped. 
The initiative, at the center of Bush's "compassionate conserv­ative" agenda, met stiff opposi­tion from the start. 
Backers argued that people looking for social services should be able to choose reli­gious providers if they want to. Opponents worried about dis­crimination against people based on religion and feared the wall between church and state was crumbling. 
A divided House approved Bush-backed legislation opening a dozen new federal social pro­grams to religious groups. It allowed these groups to hire or fire based on their religion, and allowed them to skirt state anti­discrimination laws. 
The bill was strongly opposed by civil rights groups and oth­ers, and when it got to the Senate, Santorum and Lleberman scaled it back. 
Their bill initially offered tax breaks and made it clear that religious groups may not be excluded from government con­tracts for reasons such as hav­ing a religious name or display­ing religious symbols. 
Still, critics objected. Unable to overcome these objections, backers stripped the contested language altogether. 
Opponents welcomed the final version. 
"After two years of fighting, this compromise is finally con­sistent with the American values of tolerance, equality under the law and religious freedom," said Christopher Anders of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Associated Prc.s., 
WASHINGTON 

Government investigators announced Wednesday that they had broken up cigarette smuggling operations that allegedly trafficked about $20 million in contraband ciga­rettes on both coasts. 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced the arrests of 13 members of two smuggling groups in California. ATF agents are looking for four other smug­
glers. 

"Truckloads of these ciga­rettes were going across the country," said Jeff Roehm, ATF special agent in charge of the Washington field divi­sion. ''It's one of the largest tobacco operations uncov­ered." 
Federal, state and local law enforcement organizations were involved in the 2-1/2­year investigation. 
Officials said the smuggling organizations moved about 108 million cigarettes from Virginia to California, defrauding California of some $5 million in tax revenue. The smugglers operated in Nevada and New York as well. the government said.

Center, which 
Perspective
opened in 2001. was designed to be an outreach by the University to the Northeast Neighborhood of South Bend. 

According to the Center's Mission Statement, the Center was designed to build trust through partnerships that stimulate community revitalization, thus strengthening the interaction between the Northeast Neighborhood and the University. It goes on to state that the Center was designed to enhance the area's life and gifts by providing teaching and learning opportunities through a range of educational, health and faith­based initiatives. 
In order to accomplish all of these goals, the Center has eight full-time staff members who are responsible for over­seeing and maintaining the overall direc­tion of the Center, as well as running the adult programs. In addition to this staff, the Center also has 100 student employ­ees and volunteers from Notre Dame. 
It is as a student employee that I have had contact with the Center. Since October of last year I have been volun­teering at the Center twice a week as a tutor for the after school program. Not quite sure what to expect at first, I must admit that I was somewhat uneasy about the whole idea of trying to tutor children from South Bend. I was unsure about how I would be able to connect with these children whose backgrounds seemed to be so different than mine and what it would be like to try. As I sat there through the tutor training sessions, how­ever, I began to get somewhat excited. After listening to the directors talk about how much the children looked forward to the tutors' arrival and how much the tutors helped, I realized that this was a unique and valuable opportunity. 
My first day of tutoring only served to further my excitement. I could not believe the excitement on some of the kids' faces when their tutors arrived. 
They were so excited to tell how their day was, so excited to just have someone who was there specifically for them. As my relationship grew with my assigned child I began to experience that glow and excitement from the inside as well. 
I began to realize that what so many of these children need is some stability and knowl­edge that someone is tak­ing time out specifically for them. It is hard to imagine that helping a child do simple math problems or taking the time to play a few games of Connect Four a week can make a difference, but I can assure you it

easy, because it is not. With such a relationship comes responsibility, and these children hold you to your word. Seeing the disappoint­ment on some of the children's faces when their tutors cannot be there one day can be painful. And, of course they do not always want to work. But despite all the challenges and the extra responsi­bility, there is no doubt that it is worth it. 
This semester I have been lucky enough to have had even more of an opportunity to work at the Center. Due to more schedule flexibility, I am able to get there at the same time as the children and interact with them for an hour before the rest of the tutors arrive. What I have found through this experience is that the more time you spend at the Center, the more you come to love it and 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Don't eat the veal 
Could you imagine a small puppy being taken from his mother at birth, doomed to spend the rest of his life tied to a crate so tiny that he can't even turn around or lie down com­fortably? He is kept mainly in the dark and in total isolation. Because these conditions are so unnatural, to prevent illness, he is pumped full of drugs and antibiotics to keep him alive. At just 20 weeks, left so weak that he can barely walk, he is slaughtered. You probably can't fathom an innocent little puppy being subjected to these conditions, and in fact, if you did this to your dog, you could be prosecuted for breaking anti-cruelty laws. Yet, these are standard methods for rais­ing veal calves in the United States. 
As the public has slowly become aware of the gruesome truth behind the production of veal, there has been a recent outcry to ban this inhumane and cruel practice. Many estab­lishments have pledged to stop serving it. 
Unfortunately, Notre Dame Food Services still offers veal in the children. The more comfortable they become with you, the more open they are and the more you can see how much their time there and their relationship with you means to them. 
As tutors we give these children some­one to look up to and a sense of stability. something they may not get anywhere else. Just to know that you mean so much to a child, just to know that what you are doing is making such an impact, is unbelievable, and truly an experience that everyone should have. 
Overall, the Robinson Center has made a large impact in my life here at Notre Dame and changed the way I view South Bend. The Center 

allows us as students to really get involved with the community and to 
take part in helping to revitalize it and to make that difference that everyone talks about wanting.

So, as you plan your schedule for next semes­ter, think abut leaving from 3:30 to 5:30 open on either Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday so that you can volunteer at the Robinson Center and have an opportunity to help and really connect with the community.

Please fill out dinning hall comment cards letting Notre Dame Food Services know that Notre Dame will not tolerate such injus­tice, send an email to kalili.l@nd.edu and most importantly, don't eat the veal!

Challenging ROTC to see other view-s 
Those in HOTC at our schools can justifiably find many reasons Lo swell with national pride. We are inspired by lhc many unnamed soldiers who have put their face in the dirt to pay the price for our liberty.

Such soldiers have set a high stan­dard for us who follow. We can be faithful to them by hearing the chal­lenges presented by the very citizens whose freedom we regard so highly. Doing so can only make us better offi­cers. 
While it is agreed that Saddam Hussein is a harsh dicta­LOr. we must scrutinize our leaders also. According to CNN, our president, vice president and national security adviser all have strong personal ties to energy industries: "Bush is a former director of Harken Energy Corporation, Cheney served as chief executive officer of Halliburton Energy Services Corporation and National Security Council Director Condoleezza Rice served on the board of directors of Chevron. The top 100 officials in the Bush administra­tion have the majority of their personal investments, almost $150 million, in the traditional energy and natural resource sectors." These facts seem worthy of at least some thought in our discernment about the war. 
According to the CIA's World Factbook, our military expenditure is over $276 billion, which is roughly one third of the world's total military expenditure. The U.S. fig­ure is 210 times that oflraq, which puts $1.3 billion towards its military. However, President Bush's press sec­retary /\ri Fleischer said, "This is about preserving the peace and saving the lives of Americans." 
On the other hand, such arguments can be interpreted to support the war effort. The president can couple virtuous intents with their economic expertise to reconstruct a bet­ter, stronger Iraq. And Iraq's $1.3 billion can still cause irreparable destruction against the United States or its own citizens under Hussein's direction. Also, despite the Pope's grave concerns about the war, he has made clear in his Catechism that without official government intelli­gence, he is not the proper authority to declare a war just. 
Having neither the top secret information nor the gift of insight into politician's hearts. it seems difficult for anyone lo concretely assert they know our leaders' motives. And that's where the health skepticism should arise for us who will serve. 
/\!though our military does receive annual training about just conduct within war, politicians deciding the war efforts as a whole are fallible people with important prac­tical and economic concerns who many not exclusively fol­low the Church's teachings that the laity is to animate. Therefore, we ironically seek out and learn from those who are frustrated by our government because we love uur nation and the values we want it to embody. Engaging the issue will make us and the teams we lead more grounded in the integrity and moral courage our military is to exemplify. 
Figures at Notre Dame act as our models to follow. Various instructors in ROTC and the Kroc Peace Institute have recurring lunches for dialogue. They learn by their relationship. During a recent meeting with Peter Quaranto, a student leader in Pax Christi, and an ROTC officer, open dialogue was praised for the educated, moral foundation is helps to build. College is an appropriate opportunity for such discourse as a time to let one's intellect explore deep and wonderful areas. As the officer noted, there is a prob­lem if HOTC students are not able to address the argu­ments presented to them. 
Consequently, next week's Pass In Review will present a special opportunity for us to hand each other along during this precarious ethical journey. ROTC students will gather in parade before Father. Malloy. Pax Christi will gather also to promote challenging viewpoints worthy of ROTC's consideration during their process of developing leader­ship excellence. Perhaps we can demonstrate our common patriotism and regard for peace by coming together in dia­logue and joint service projects in days to come.

MOVIE REVIEW 
'View from the Top' a new low 
By MARY SQUILLACE Scene Movie Critic 
"Please fasten your seatbelts and return your seats to their locked, upright position; we will now be experi­encing some turbulence." This warning should be issued before anyone should 

be subjected to viewing Bruno Barreto's "A View from the Top." After stumbling through corny dialogue, a trite screenplay, and failed attempts at comedy, his film ultimately crashes and burns. 
Donna Jensen {Gwyneth Paltrow) is a small town girl who 
"View from the Top" 

Director: Bruno Barreto Writer: Eric Wald Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Christina Applegate, Marc Blucas, Mark Ruffalo, Kelly Preston, Mike Myers, Rob Lowe, Candice Bergen, Stacey Dash 

aspires to see the world. In an attempt to fulfill this dream, she takes a job as a stewardess with a small airline that boasts of "big hair, short skirts, and service with a smile." Soon after, deter­mined to move-up in the world, Donna and her best friend Christine (Christina Applegate) enroll In flight attendant school with an upscale airline. 
However, Donna's dreams of working in first class are shattered when she is assigned to work out of Cleveland. 
Nevertheless, in a typical cinematic twist of fate, it is here where she reunites with love-interest Ted (Mark Ruffalo). In the end Donna must decide between staying in Cleveland with Ted and pur­suing her dreams. 
While the premise of "A View from the Top" appears to be promising grounds for some quality satire, screen-writer 
Eric Wald's cheesy dialogue and ovorly dra­matic warm-and­fuzzy moments thwart any attempt at humor he may have made. It's as if he can't decide whether he'd like to deliver laughs or a heart-warm­ing message. Furthermore, the plot is too thinly spun to ade­
quately support the storyline between Donna and Ted, so the film also fails as a romantic comedy. 
As if to counteract the obscenely cliche filled screenplay, Barreto packs "A View from the Top" full of big names such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Mike Myers and Candice Bergen. Unfortunately, neither Paltrow's superstar status nor Myers' humor can revive this film. 
In her role as Donna, Paltrow attempts to shed her characteristic grace and poise to don pastel mini-skirts and bright pink lipstick. However, she is unconvincing as a tacky, working-class girl, and her outrageous outfits provoke the only laughs of her performance. In addition, Paltrow's wistful looks and teary-eyed endeavors to appear emo­tionally torn are exaggerated and seem out of place in the context of such a triv­ial story line. 

Myers' performance is equally disap­pointing. His initial appearance as the lazy-eyed flight-school instructor pres­ents a glimmer of hope; however, by the end of the film even Meyers' jokes are far too repetitive to be funny. 
Other recognizable actors advertised in previews, such as Rob Lowe and Kelly Preston, almost appear more onscreen when their names roll during the closing credits than when their faces appear during the actual film. 
On a more positive note, at a mere 87 minutes, "A View from the Top" is mini­mally time consuming. In addition, it's so intellectually cushy that it might be just what mentally frustrated college students need in the wake of end-of­semester stresses. However, under any other conditions, seeing "A View from the Top" should plummet straight to the bottom of all priority lists.

TAKE Two 
Incurable insanity: Drug culture in Hollywood 
Kate: Well, kids, we were hoping to bring you our normal wholesome movie review. Ilowevcr, we were not willing to watch any or thn movies showing at Movies 14. 
Maria: At the risk of seeming pretentious becawm we lik~ foreign movies, we clccidnd to write an 
article on the won­
drous evolution of illegal substances in movies in anticipa­tion of "City of God." /\!though we have not seen the critical­ly acclaimed lilm debut of Brazilian director Fernando Mcirelles' movie that dflals with poverty and the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro. we would still like to address its significance in the portrayal of drugs and drug cul­ture in the history of motion pictures. 
K: Plus nothing ,.vitl get a college student to read an article faster than Lhc word "drug" in the title. To understand just how much the por­trayal of drug culture has changed since Lhe advent of movies, we have to go back to the beginning -the original drug cul­ture movie. Yes. I am talking about "Hccfer Madness." This "documentary" from 1936 is perhaps the most inaccu­rate portrayal of marijuana use known to man. It labels marijuana as a "violent narcotic" which can cause "incurable insanity." 
M: Anyone with stoner friends or cable knows that people under the influence of cannabis arc less likely to go on a violent rampage than eat an entire box of Cheese Nips in five minutes. But in the early days of film, accuracy was less important than scare tactics in addressing any aspect of drug culture. Even accurate portrayals showing the negative sides of drug use seem to have been strictly taboo in favor of over-exaggerated anti-narcotic hype. 

K Modern directors have abandoned the idea of marijuana as a ghastly menace, and use it as a comic tool instead. Cheech and Chong's 1978 film "Up in Smoke," featuring a van made entirely of marijua­na, is a far cry from the sensationalism of the 1930s. In the last decade, however, we've seen the rise of a new genre of drug culture movies that are much dark­er. 
M: Where the directors of the 1930s used spurious tactics to instill their message in viewers, directors such as Danny Boyle and Darren Aronofsky go the opposite direction and use genuine life experi­ences for much the same purpose. "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream" show the disintegration of the lives of lives of people addicted to heroin and other narcotics. Unlike "Reefer Madness," "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream" both take us inside the heads of drug users. "Trainspotting" frankly addresses heroin use as the greatest pleasure addicts have known in showing exactly how hard it is to quit using the drug, while "Requiem for a Dream" uses graphic images to depict the addict's slide into harsh reality. The shocking frankness of both films is a huge departure from what was accept­able in early days of film, with the bizarre subject material emphasized through rapid camera shots and other surreal filming techniques. 
K: While there has been a tendency to look at drug use as something casual or fun, the recent spate of film detailing the 
less chic side of 
addiction takes the focus from the perspective of drugs as recreation and focuses on the much nastier reality of life as an addict. The idea of "heroin chic" becomes a lot less appealing with images of the conse­quences of serious use staring you in the face. The dead baby crawling on the ceil­ing in "Trainspotting" removes any smidgen of coolness from heroin use. While Cheech and Chong look at drug use as a source of laughs. "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream" leave little opportunity for comedic enjoyment. 


M: Drug culture movies also took a differ­ent turn in 2000 with a look at the supply side of the drug trade in Steven Soderburg's "Traffic." Although the film was arguably less successful portraying the lives of drug users, it was an interest­ing foray into the national and interna­tional issues involved in drug sales. The ftlm was a step forward in examining all sides of an issue that has often been inco­herently addressed by writers and direc­tors. Movies revolving around the issues of drugs and drug cultures have become increasingly insightful and accurate since the genre emerged, and especially in the last few years. None of the previous films have been able to offer what "City of God" accomplishes by examining the drug trade abroad without any American perspective on the issue. The film focuses on the violence and poverty that promote and surround narcotics before they ever reach the United States. If watching the lives of drug addicts is an exposure to harsh reality, being emerged for two hours into the worst districts of Rio de Janeiro is even more so. 
K: Modern movies provide a much more realistic picture of addiction and they show there is a much more honest dis­course now about the issue of drug use. Directors arc still using scare tactics, but they're using tactics based on what really happens. This is an example of how much more effective honesty can be in making any important point. I lowever, it's still a Hollywood version of addiction. These actors go home and are no longer addicted. Volunteering at a homeless shelter will provide a far more realistic picture of the life of a drug addict than a movie will ever be able to do. Or, if you really don't care. go sec "A View from the Top."

Mussina outdueled Kyle Lohse (1-1) on a crisp 40-degree night at Yankee Stadium where the ball didn't carry well to the out­field. 
Lohse retired the first nine bat­ters and didn't allow a hit out of the infield until Posada and Mondcsi homered in the fifth. 
That gave the Yankees 19 homers in their first eight games -one shy of the AL record, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Yankees set the record in 1932 and Seattle matched it five years ago. St. Louis holds tho major league mark of 23 in 2000. 
Indians 5, White Sox 2 
Brian Anderson won his first appearance with the Indians at Jacobs Field since the 1997 World Series, leading Cleveland over the Chicago White Sox. 
Only 14,841 -the smallest crowd in the Jake's 10-year his­tory -attended in near-freezing temperatures. It was the fewest fans to see an Indians home game since Sept. 20, 1993, at Cleveland Stadium. 
Anderson (2-0), who earned a save in Game 4 against Florida in the '97 Series in his first stint with the Indians, allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings. 
Rookie Brandon Phillips hit his first career homer off Jon Garland (0-1 ). Phillips added a double, stole third and scored on a short sacrifice fly to center for the Indians, whose bullpen final­ly did the job. 
Jose Santiago pitched 1 1/3 innings and Danys Baez got five outs for his third save. 

Paul Konerko homered for the White Sox, who had their win­ning streak stopped at four games. 
Blue Jays 10, Red Sox 5 
Vernon Wells hit a grand slam as the Toronto Blue Jays rallied for their fifth straight victory, beating the Boston Red Sox. 
Mike Bordick doubled twice and drove in three runs for the Blue Jays, who haven't lost since dropping their first three games of the season to the New York Yankees. 
Manny Ramirez extended his career-high hitting streak to 22 games with a three-run homer for the Red Sox, who have lost three offour. 
Ramirez's homer gave Boston a 3-0 lead in the fourth, but Toronto's Dave Berg homered off Casey Fossum (1-1) in the bottom half and the Blue Jays scored five runs in the fifth. 
Toronto starter Tanyon Sturtze (2-0) won his second straight start. 
Devil Rays 10, Orioles 7 
Rocco Baldelli hit a tiebreaking RBI triple in the seventh inning as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays came from behind for the second straight game to beat the Baltimore Orioles. 
Tampa Bay trailed by four runs in the second inning and three in the fifth, but Baldelli's triple off Willis Roberts (0-1) gave the Devil Rays an 8-7 lead. Aubrey Huff followed with a run­scoring single against B.J Ryan, and Carl Crawford added an RBI single in the eighth. 
Marlon Anderson hit a three­run homer and matched a career high with four RBIs for Tampa Bay. Huff knocked in three runs. 
The Devil Rays fell behind 6-0 in the second inning Tuesday before coming back for an 8-7, 10-inning win over Baltimore.

NHL 
Islanders upset Senators 
Associated Press 
OTTAWA 

Dave Scatchard, Alexei Yashin and Shawn Bates scored, and Garth Snow earned his first career playoff shutout to lead the New York Islanders to a stunning 3-0 victory over the top-seed­ed Ottawa Senators on Wednesday night in the opener of their first-round series. 
One day after New York coach Peter Laviolette proclaimed his eighth-place team was better than the Presidents' Trophy-winning Senators. the Islanders backed him up. 
Despite finishing 30 points behind the Senators who had 113, New York got goals from Scatchard and Yashin in the first period. Bates then scored midway through the second. 
Yashin, the former Senators captain who was jeered whenever he touched the puck, gave the Ottawa fans some­thing new to boo about at 11:35 when he scored his 10th career playoff goal. 
Oilers 2, Stars 1 
Ryan Smyth popped a short-handed goal between Marty Turco's legs, and Shawn Horcoff beat the record-setting goaltender's glove on a 2-on-1 break. sending eighth-seeded Edmonton past top-seeded Dallas in Game 1. 
Turco turned away seven first-peri­od shots and was bolstered by a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal by Mike Modano. 
Then Turco allowed two goals with­in a 3:48 span early in the second period and Dallas never recovered. A spurt of penalties in the third left the Stars down at least one man the final 4:06, draining their comeback hopes. 
Edmonton's Tommy Salo stopped 20 shots to earn just his fourth win in 16 playoff games. Turco made 21 saves in his playoff debut. 
The Stars and Oilers are meeting in the playoffs for the sixth time in seven years. 
Maple Leafs 5, Ayers 3 
Mikael Renberg scored a power-play goal with 5:39 left, leading Toronto over the Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals series open­er. 
The Flyers outshot the Leafs 31-15 but Toronto scored four goals on its first 13 attempts against Roman Cechmanek. Alexander Mogilny had three goals, for his first playoff hat trick, and Tie Domi also scored for the Leafs. 
Ed Belfour made 28 saves for Toronto. which has won four straight first-round series. 
Eric Desjardins, Donald Brashear and Eric Weinrich scored for Philadelphia, which has been eliminat­ed in the opening round four of the last five years. That trio scored only 18 regular-season goals. 
Devils 2, Bruins 1 
Jamie Langenbrunner scored twice and Martin Brodeur had 26 saves to lead New Jersey over Boston in the opener of their first-round playoff series. 
Bryan Berard scored for the Bruins in the series that matches teams com­ing off embarrassing first-round losses last year. 
There were plenty of hard hits, and both teams played with a chippiness that could make this an interesting series.

'Bullets' lose on anniversary 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Calling themselves the Bullets once more, the Washington Wizards spoiled the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the franchise's lone NBA champi­onship by losing 87-83 Wednesday night to the Boston Celtics. 
Rookie J.R. Bremer scored 20 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including the win­ning 3-pointer with 19.4 seconds to play. Antoine Walk13r scored 24 and Paul Pierce had 20 as the Celtics clinched a playoff berth and sent the Wizards clos­er to elimination. 
Washington fell 2 1/2 games behind eighth-place Milwaukee in the East. 
After Bremer's basket, the Wizards trailed 85-83, but couldn't get the ball to Michael Jordan on their final possession. Tyronn Lue missed a tough 16-foot fade­away, and neither Kwame Brown nor Christian Laettner could get the tip. 
Jordan scored 21 points for Washington. 
Bucks 112, Clippers 92 
Toni Kukoc scored 26 points, tying his season high, and had 10 rebounds. The Bucks reduced their magic number to one for the final playoff berth in the East: One Milwaukee victory or a Washington loss puts the Bucks into the playoffs. Milwaukee has three games to play and Washington has four. 
Sam Cassell had 22 points and Gary Payton 21 for Milwaukee, which 
bounced back from an overtime loss at Chicago in which the Bucks led by 19. Elton Brand scored 21 points and Corey Maggette 20 for the Clippers. 
Magic 88, Raptors 82 
Tracy McGrady scored 37 points and 
had a spectacular two-handed dunk to 
help the Magic snap a four-game losing 
streak. McGrady shot 1l-of-18 from the 
field, including 4-of-7 from 3-point 
range, and was 11-of-16 at the free 
throw line. He surpassed 30 points for 
the 48th time this year. 
Coupled with Washington's loss, 
Orlando's magic number for a playoff 
berth fell to one. 
Toronto got 15 points from Alvin 
Williams. 
Hawks 97, Nets 92 
Ira Newbie hit a go-ahead 3-pointer 
with 1:38 left and the Hawks held off a furious rally. Shareef Abdur-Rahim added another 3-pointer late in the game to extend the margin to six, and . after Jason Kidd made a layup on the other end. Atlanta's Dion Glover made a 
free throw for the final margin. 
Jason Terry scored 24 points for the 
Hawks, and Abdur-Rahim added 18 
points and 15 rebounds. Newbie, who 
started in place of Glenn Robinson, fin­
ished with a season-high 16 points. 
Kidd had his fourth triple-double of 
the season, totaling 23 points, 12 assists 
and 11 rebounds. The Nets lost for only 
the second time in eight games, but are 
just 16-23 on the road.

The University of Kansas fired athletic director Al Bohl on Wednesday, and he said basketball coach Roy Williams was behind it. 
"I believe the Kansas bas­ketball coach had the power to hold his athletics director in his hand like a dove," Bohl said. "And he had a choice to either crush me with his power of influ­ence or let me fly with my vision for a better, total pro­gram. He chose to crush me." 
Bohl has had numerous clashes with the popular Williams. whose Jayhawks

Burk, who heads the National Council of Women's Organizations, plans to protest Augusta National's all-male membership during the third round Saturday. 
She wanted to place picketers at the front gate of the exclusive club, but Sheriff Ronald Strength would only approve a site a half-mile away. He said it was unsafe to gather in front of the club because of heavy congestion during the golf tourna­ment. 
The three-judge panel refused to grant Burk's emergency request to block Monday's ruling by U.S. District lost to Syracuse in the national championship game Monday night. Bohl was hired in 2001 to replace longtime athletic director Bob Frederick, a close friend of Williams. 

Williams is expected to he a leading contender for the coaching job at North Carolina, his alma mater. Williams turned down the position three years ago, but he has faced frequent questions about the opening since Matt Doherty resigned.

Bowen upheld the city ordinance granting Strength the power to regu­late protests and also approved the sheriff's application of the law in handling Burk's request. 
Burk said her group had no other legal means to overturn the decision before Saturday, though it will con­tinue to fight the constitutionality of the city ordinance in court. 
Burk wanted to post 24 demonstra­tors outside the front gate of Augusta National and 200 more across the street. 
She believed that would be the most effective way to demonstrate against Augusta National, which said again Wednesday that it has no timetable to admit a female member. 
In any event, she said her group would not do anything illegal at Saturday's gathering.

wouldn't speculate on whether the pitcher will be signed. LaMar said a couple of other teams had looked at Hocker, too. 
Rocker, who returned to Atlanta after the workout, is 13-22 with 88 saves in 278 major league appearances with the Braves, Indians and Rangers.

LaMar, who was in the Braves' front office when Rocker signed with Atlanta, said he talked to Rocker about the prob­lems the pitcher has had in the past and made it clear that the Devil Rays would expect "professionalism" from him both on and off the field. 
Piniella said he didn't have a problem with taking in a player with Rocker's background. 
"When I look at a player, I don't look in the past. I look at the present and the future," the manager said. "I think he's learned from those things." 

NASCAR 
Cheever opts out of Indy 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 

Eddie Cheever Jr., the 1998 winner of the Jndianapolis 500. announced Wednesday that he will not drive in this year's race -although his team will enter at least one car. 
His decision ends a streak of 13 consecutive starts at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the longest among active drivers. Cheever, 45, was care­ful not to say he was retiring, instead calling it a "self-imposed sabbatical." 
'Tm not sure what I'm going to do in the future," he said in a statement released by Red Bull I-lacing. "All I know right now is that I have too much going on." 
Cheever was unavailable for com­ment Wednesday because he was traveling to England, and no replace­ment was announced for his No. 51 car. 
He cited increasing travel, which included seven trips to Europe this winter, as much of the reason for his announcement. He said he had not had much time to prepare for the race. 
Cheever lives in Phoenix but was 
born and raised in Rome and has 
traveled there more frequently since 
he and John Menard, another IRL 
team owner, purchased TWR 
Engines, an engine-design company 
based in England. 
Cheever already had announced a 
cutback in the number of races he 
would drive this season but had said 
he would compete at Indianapolis. 
But just because Cheever is not in the driver's seat does not mean he will not have a stake in the race on Indianapolis' 2 1/2-mile oval. 
His team's No. 52 car will be driven by Buddy Rice. 
'Tm not certain about the future," Cheever said. "Hight now, I'm con­centrating on running the team and on the acquisition of TWH Engines." 
He has been an owner or co-owner of his car since 1996, when he was one of the better-known drivers who opted to stay with the Indy !lacing League following its split from CART. His gregarious demeanor made him one of the series' fan favorites. 
Cheever shares the series record for most consecutive starts, 69, with Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy 500 win­ner. Cheever's July 2001 victory at Kansas Speedway was only the sec­ond for an Infiniti-powered car. 
Cheever qualified for his first Indianapolis 500 in 1990, when he drove for Chip Ganassi's team. lie was named Rookie of the Year but never won a CART race. 
From 1978-89, Cheever drove in 132 Formula 1 races -the most of any American driver -but without a victory. His first win came in a rain­shortened race at Orlando, Fla., dur­ing the 1996-97 season. 
Cheever won one race each of the 
next four years, his biggest being in 
1998 at Indianapolis. 
Cheever also drove in Formula 2 
from 1976-77 and Formula 3 in 1975 
as a teammate of 1985 Indy 500 win­
ner Danny Sullivan.

Torm.ented by Tiger, Els chooses ne-w approach for Masters

AUGUSTA. Ga. 

It's hard to imagine Ernie Els getting worked up about any­thing. Hey, he's the Big Easy, the guy with the sleepy eyes, the comfortable grin, the sooth­ing demeanor.

in his ear. 
"If you start playing Tiger on Thursday from the first tee, that's the wrong way to go about it," said Els, expected to be one of Woods' main chal­lengers at the Masters after taking two weeks off to heal a sore wrist. "You're going to beat yourself up and not play your normal game." 
A year ago at Augusta National, Els let his preoccupa­tion with Woods ruin any chance of winning the tourna­ment. 
Woods was leading on Sunday when Els went to No. 13, hoping to take a big chunk out of the deficit with an eagle on the par-5 hole. He pulled out a 3-wood and tried to steer his tee shot around trees hug­ging the left side of the dogleg. 
Instead, Els yanked the ball into the woods. To make things worse, he tried two impossible shots from the foliage, putting them both in Rae's Creek. He wound up taking a triple-bogey

"I was trying to really get it around the corner and have a shot at eagle and all that stuff," Els said. "But after the tee shot, I was dead. And then I just made mistake after mistake. After that first mistake, I was 
said. "Tiger 
wasn't the 
issue. He was the issue. Instead of changing the person, you have to change the way the person thinks." 
So far this year. the results are evident. 
While Woods was recovering from knee surgery, Els became the first player in 14 years to win the first two PGA Tour events of the season. He won twice more against good fields in Australia. 
Then came a reality check. Els and Woods went mano-a­mano at Bay Hill in the third round. It wasn't really a fair fight -Els had the sore wrist, Woods had a four-shot lead ­but the world's best player solidified his spot by finishing the day with a to-stroke lead. By the end of the next day, Woods was 19 shots ahead. 
Els, it seems, is still a work in progress. 
"Whenever Tiger gets into a tournament, pow!" Vanstiphout said. "There's five times more press, more security, more attention. Ernie has got to learn to live with it, and he will." 
Make no mistake, though: Els is learning. With his career threatening 
to drift off course last summer,

out why he is so Saturday,
preoccupied with Woods. 
At age 24, Els won the first of two U.S. Open titles. He was the rising star in the world of golf: imposing in size (6-foot-3, 200 pounds). dashing in looks and immensely talented. 
He never really got a chance to enjoy his reign. In 1997, Woods signaled the start of a new era with a 12-stroke victo­ry at the Masters. Since then, this sport has been Tiger's World -everyone else just has a tee time. 
Over the years, Els has fin­ished second to Woods in six tournaments around the world, more than anyone else. Two of those came in 2000. when Woods romped to record­breaking victories at the U.S. Open and British Open and 
but Els still had to over­come his mental demons. 
He had a big lead on the back nine until a double-bogey on 16 left him one stroke behind. It's not farfetched to say Els was at a crossroads. 
He had a remarkable birdie at 17, then parred the final hole of regulation to force a four-man playoff. After four extra holes, only Els and Thomas Levet were left. Els parred the next hole to claim the Claret Jug. 
"The British was definitely the start of maybe the resur­gence of my golf game," Els said. "If I didn't get through that tournament, if I didn't win that tournament, I think I would have been a different player right now."

Kent's RBI bails out Miller's error as Astros edge Reds 4-3 
Talented Cornell top 
seed in Frozen Four 
A,sodatcd Pr,,ss 
HOUSTON After an embarrassing error, Wade Miller just · wantod to disappear. Jeff Kent and the rest of his Houston teammates bailed him out. 
Miller's throwing error to an uncovered third base allowed three runs to score. but Kent's tiebrnaking sacrifice fly in the seventh inning sent th,1 Astros to a 4-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday night. 
"I wanted to dig a hole behind the mound and crawl in and hope no one would see me," Miller said. "! thought my best option was to throw to third base. but I had other options. I chose the wrong one." 
The Astros pulled it out anyway by loading the bases in the seventh against Josias Manzanilla (0­
2) on singles by Craig Biggio, Jose Vizcaino and Jeff Bagwell. Gabe White struck out Lance Berkman before John Hiedling came on to pitch to Kcnl. 
The 2000 NL MVP hit a deep fly to center field, scoring Biggio easily with lhe go-ahead .run. 
"I was trying to simplify the game a little bit," Kent said. "You just try to put one out there. That's all it was." 
Billy Wagner worked the ninth for his second save. Ile walked the first two batters before retir­ing Jason LaRun. Felipe Lopez and Barry Larkin to end it. 
Brad Udge (1-0). who replaced Miller in the sev­enth, went two scoreless innings for his second major league victory. 
"Wade pitched a good game and gave us a chance to win," Astros manager Jimy Williams said. "You are always trying to do the right thing and sometimes it doesn't work out. It wasn't from a lack of effort." 
The Heds were trailing 3-0 in the fifth inning when Miller's mistake allowed them to tie it. 
AI\Pr striking out the first two batters, Miller hit LaHue with a pitch, walked pitcher Jimmy Anderson and hit Larkin with a pitch to load the bases. 
Aaron Boone then hit a slow roller toward third and Miller threw without noticing that third base­man Morgan Ensberg also was trying to field the ball instead ofcovering the bag. 
Miller struck out Adam Dunn for ihe third time to end the inning. Reds manager Bob Boone agonized over bob­bled balls by his own defense. 
"When you are playing against Miller, you have to make those plays, you can't be giving them extra outs and extra bases," he said. "When you don't hit, it means you've got to do some work or you've got to change some players. 
Rockies 9, Cardinals 4 

La.rry Wa.lker and Preston Wilson each drove in three runs, and the Colorado Rockies built a big early lead Wednesday night in a 9.4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Wilson and Bobby Estalella each hit two-run homers as Colorado opened a 9-0 lead after three innings. 
Nelson Cruz (2-0), making his second straight start because of injuries to Denny Neagle and Denny Stark, went six-plus innings for the Rockies, allowing two runs and five hits before he was ejected. 
Cruz was tossed in the seventh by plate umpire Mike DiMuro after hitting Tino Martinez with a pitch. Cruz plunked Jim Edmonds earlier, and DiMuro issued a warning to both benches after Brett Tomko threw a pitch behind Todd Helton in the third. 
Tomko (0-1) gave up nine runs on nine hits in six innings. Edgar Renteria hit a three-run double for St. Louis, and Scott Rolen added a solo homer.

Shaq's practice absence draws Jackson's ire 
Associated Pres 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. 
Shaquille O'Neal skipped practice Wednesday, and coach Phil Jackson was not satisfied with his excuse. 
"He called, although he didn't call a number that reached any of us," Jackson said after the rest of the Los Angeles Lakers held a light workout and watched film in preparation for Thursday night's game against the rival Sacramento Kings. 
"He didn't call. he had some­one call for him," Jackson said. "Flat tire is what he said. That's all I know." 
A flat tire in the O'Neal house­hold would not seem to be an insurmountable obstacle. The 7­foot center is known to have a vast supply of automotive

ee's estimate. "It bothers me, yeah," Jackson said. 
At the same time, Jackson inferred that he would not make a big issue of O'Neal playing hooky, saying the team would move on and concentrate on the task of trying to become the first team in nearly four decades to win four consecutive NBA titles. 
With four games remaining, the Lakers are in sixth place in the Western Conference and have a chance to improve their playoff seeding if they finish 4­0. 
Portland, fighting it out with Minnesota for the No. 4 spot in the conference, had its lead over the Lakers slip to one game after the Blazers lost to San Antonio 84-79 Wednesday night. 
The Lakers will play at Portland on Sunday before fin­ishing the season against the Nuggets and Warriors. 
First, though, come the Kings, who have defeated the Lakers twice this season. 
It will be the last regularly scheduled installment of the league's best rivalry, one that has included a preseason fight between Rick Fox and Doug Christie, a Christmas night vic­tory by the Kings at the Staples Center, and a game last month in Sacramento in which O'Neal scored his 20,000th career point. only to find an obscene message written on the game ball when the Kings presented it to him. 
"They don't need to win this ballgame. they've sewn up the Pacific Division," Jackson said. "If we want to move up in the standings, it's a must-game for us to win. Any loss now pretty much eliminates our chances of moving up to a different brack­et." 
At practice, Jackson had planned to emphasize a few offensive themes that he felt the Lakers were lacking the last time they played the Kings. But O'Neal's absence deprived Jackson of a big part of his

He always plays well against the Kings, relishing the opportu­nity to dominate Vlade Divac ­a center O'Neal often proclaims is the league's biggest flopper. 
Jackson knows O'Neal well enough to be confident his cen­ter will be ready at tipoff, yet that didn't mitigate the bother­some nature of his blowing off practice. 
Jackson has seen his team meander through this season with less focus than they've had the two previous times they defended the title. Only 3 1/2 months ago they were 11-19, but the Lakers have turned things around to such an extent that they've won nine of their last 10. 
But just when things were seemingly going so smoothly, Shaq's flat tire put an unneeded bump in the road. 
"Something we wanted to do as a team was to kind of push ourselves here and create a playoff atmosphere for our­selves," Jackson said, "so it's a little bit Gf a setback for us."

Spurs hold off Blazers to win 10th in a row 
. Win ensures San Antonio share of Midwest Division lead with Dallas 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO 

Neither Tim Duncan nor Rasheed Wallace had much of a game on offense in Wednesday night's matchup between Portland and San Antonio. That was because both played so well against each other on defense. 
Duncan's teammates, howev­er, outperformed Wallace's, enabling the Spurs to cling to a 84-79 win in the face of a strong second-half comeback by the Trail Blazers. 
The victory was San Antonio's 10th straight, and ensured the Spurs would at least retain the best record in the league and a share of the Midwest Division lead with Dallas. The Spurs and the Mavericks each began the day at 57-20, best in the NBA. 
Stephen Jackson made a pair of free throws and Tony Parker added one in the game's wan­ing monents to clinch the win for the Spurs, who saw a 15­point advantage in the first half shrink to two by the final minute. 
Duncan, defended physically by Wallace for most of the night, had trouble getting close to his comfort zone near the basket. He was just 3-for-14 shots for 11 points, less than half his season average. 
"It's good to be able to have a game like this tonight and the team still find a way to win," Duncan said. 
Wallace, averaging nearly 19 points. was held to eight on 4­for-16 shooting. 
"They both canceled each other out," said Portland guard Bonzi Wells. "Rasheed guarding Tim, Tim guarding Rasheed. That's just two big guys having a big game [on defense]." 
The Trail Blazers, trailing by 12 at the half, trimmed San Antonio's lead to 81-79 on two free throws by Wells with 1:28 left. But Portland's rally stalled as the team missed its final three shots. 
Manu Ginobili's l 7 points off the bench led six Spurs in dou­ble figures. Parker added 15 and Bruce Bowen 13, all in the first half. Duncan led all rebounders with l l. 
Ginobili also had two key offensive rebounds in the final 
1:04 to help the Spurs run time off the clock. 
He passed the second rebound to Jackson, who was fouled by Derek Anderson with 
10.6 seconds left and made both. 
"I don't play 40 minutes like Tim and Tony -I'm fresh," said Ginobili. "The best thing I can give the Spurs is energy." 
Jazz 94, Rockets 73 
The Utah Jazz picked the right time to end a three-game losing streak. 
Getting ready to play the top three teams in the Western Conference and coming off one of its worst losses of the season, Utah took advantage of some poor shooting and beat the struggling Houston Rockets. 
"It was huge because we're heading into a tough schedule and you want to get that feeling of winning back before we play these tough .teams," said Matt Antonio and Sacramento.

The Rockets trail eighth-place Phoenix, a winner over Dallas, by 2 1/2 games.

(31.5 percent) overall. 
"I really can't explain it. We just can't put it in the basket. We just can't score," acting coach Larry Smith said. "Our main guys are getting good looks and we're coming up with zero." 
James Posey and Maurice Taylor led Houston with 10 points each. Yao Ming finished with just six points and five rebounds, both well below his averages of 13.7 and 8.3. 
Houston was just 5-for-23 in the first quarter, with only one field goal, a layup by Kelvin Cato, that wasn't a 3-pointer. 
"Yesterday we did a few things well," Yao said. "Tonight, I don't think we did anything well." 
Suns 112, Mavericks 89 
Penny Hardaway got his first triple-double in 1 1/2 years and Shawn Marion had 31 points and 15 rebounds as the Phoenix Suns widened their lead for the West's final playoff berth with a rout of the Dallas Mavericks.

The Suns never trailed. shot 51 percent and, for the first time this season. had six play­ers in double figures, including all five starters. Stephon Marbury scored 20 points, Amare Stoudemire 17 and Joe Johnson 14. 
Bo Outlaw, who started at center, scored 11 before getting an elbow to the face from Raef LaFrentz with 7 :02 left in the third quarter. 
He had a bruised left jaw and a cut on his left cheek that required three stitches. 
Dirk Nowitzki scored 26 points and Nick Van Exel 22 for the Mavericks, who had no one else in double figures. Marion scored 11 points and the Suns shot 63 percent (15-for-23) in the first quarter, outscoring the Mavs 14-5 over the final 3:21 of the period to take a 36-25 lead. 
Van Exel scored seven in a 10-3 Dallas run that cut the lead to 43-39 on his 19-footer with 6:35 left in the half. 
But the Suns outscored the Mavericks 14-5 the rest of the quarter to go up 57-43 at the break. 
The run-and-gun Mavs had no fast-break points in the first half. 
Phoenix twice led by as many as 17 in the third quarter before Van Exel scored 10 con­secutive Mavericks points, the first six on 3-pointers, to cut the lead to 74-62 with four minutes to go in the period. Dallas never got closer.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Ex-Kansas AD blasts Willia1ns 
Associated Press 
LAWRENCE, Kan. 
The news was about Al Bohl. 
He was out as Kansas' ath­letic director. 
But the reaction -including that of Bohl himself -was only about basketball coach Roy Williams. 
"I believe the Kansas basket­ball coach had the power to hold his athletics director in his hand like a dove," Bohl said after he was fired Wednesday. 
"And he had a choice to either crush me with his power of influence or let me fly with my vision for a better, total program. He chose to crush me." 
When making the announce­ment, Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemenway tried to deflect attention away from his wildly popular basketball coach and onto the athletic director he'd hired less than two years ago. 
He said he had discussed leadership of the department with Bohl during the past few months, as well as with coach­es, other athletic department staff members, alumni and donors. 
"On the basis of these con­versations and my own evalua­tion of the situation, I came to the conclusion a change of leadership was needed at this time," Hemenway said, adding that he made the decision while returning from the Final Four. 
But Hemenway took pains to say Williams never asked for Bohl's removal, a move he stressed was not necessarily intended to placate the basket­ball coach -who is expected to receive an offer any day to return to North Carolina to coach at his alma matter. 
"This is not a Roy versus Al decision," Hemenway said. 
Bohl, however, said other­wise. In an extraordinary news conference 30 minutes later at his home, Bohl blamed his fir­ing squarely on Williams. 
"It is bad when a basketball coach can have the ability to hire and fire someone," Bohl said. 
Hired in 2001 to replace Williams' close friend and longtime Jayhawks athletic director Bob Frederick, Bohl clashed early and often with Williams. 
Bohl's dismissal has been viewed as an almost foregone conclusion since rumors sur­faced in February that UCLA would pursue Williams, whose Jayhawks have won nine con­ference championships and more than 400 games in 15 years and lost to Syracuse in the NCAA title game Monday night. 
But the speculation intensi­fied after North Carolina coach Matt Doherty resigned before the Final Four, opening the position that Williams -a for­mer North Carolina assistant and protege of Dean Smith ­passed up three years ago. 
And now that Hemenway has acted, when will Williams?

I I I USOC predicts $8 million short£ all through 2004 
Asso,iated Press 
DENVER The latest turmoil surrounding the 

U.S. Olympic Committee wasn't a big problem until it affected the bottom line. 
The USOC is predicting a revenue shortfall of about $8 million through 2004. in part because recent scandals have turned donors away. according to two sources within the Olympic move­ment. 
"There's no question in my mind it's [turmoil) hurt their fund-raising abili­ty." said Ben Nighthorse Campbell. part of a Senate committee investigat­ing the USOC. 
"They've got to regain the confidence of the public. The only way that you're going to be able to do that is prove to the public that you're going to have good, solid, fair leadership where the main is goal is going to be to help young Americans." 
The shortfall is in a $491 million budget that covers 2001-04. 
About 60 percent of the gap is blamed on a drop in public donations after three months of turmoil led to the resignations of eight top officials and drew the ire of Congress. 
The figures are detailed in a report to be delivered to the USOC at a meeting this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, said the sources. who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
"Direct mail and major gifts we think are going to be down through Athens because of all of the turmoil." one source said. "And until we can get our­selves back on track and get things 
out, we're making a conservative forecast." 
Other hits to the budget include declines in fees from broadcasting rights, retail sales and a smaller con­tribution from the Olympic Foundation, the sources said. 
The USOC is moving to make up the shortfall by savings in administrative costs, mostly because the organization has not replaced the highly paid top officials who have resigned, the sources said. 
The difference between revenues and expenses in the budget is about $3.5 million. including a $2.8 million sur­plus USOC officials hope to carry through the Athens Games next sum­mer. 
Figures related to deficiencies or sur­pluses in previous quads were not immediately available. 
The news was no surprise to Campbell. one of the USOC's harshest critics through the latest flareup. 
"The moms and pops who send in their 10 or 20 bucks, they didn't send it in for the hierarchy to take first-class trips around the world to stay in five­star hotels," Campbell said Wednesday. "They sent their money in because they thought the money was going to go to the athletes." 
The USOC receives about 5 percent of the annual assets of the Olympic Foundation. a nonprofit corporation that provides funding for sports in the Olympic movement. The Olympic Foundation's revenue is down because the sour economy has affected invest­ments. 
Savings in salaries stem from the decision to not replace chief executive Lloyd Ward, chief operating officer Fred Wohlschlaeger and chief market-

All three resigned after conflict-of­interest charges against Ward in December set off a series of attempted coups, resignations and power strug­gles behind the scenes. 
Ward made about $550,000 a year, while Wohlschlaeger and Wong earned a total of about $500,000.

MENS LACROSSE 
Irish hungry to halt recent losing streak 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sporrs Writer 
When you dig a hole for your­self, you have to dig your way out. 
The whiteboard in the Notre Dame mens lacrosse locker room could have read something similar at the beginning of this sea.son. The Irish no doubt entered the spring reluctant to let another 5-8 season pass them by after being less than two years removed from the NCAA national semifma.ls. 
Su a quick start was in order, and the team responded to coach Kevin Corrigan's preseason preparation. A 3-0 start became a huge step up from the team's 1-2 opening record after three games last year. The Irish redeemed themselves against Penn St. and Penn and beat No. 7 North Carolina on the road. The for­tunes of Kevin Corrigan's team seemed to be changing for the better. 
Since the North Carolina victory, however, Notre Dame has lost 4 of its last 6 games. The losses include 9-8 defeats to current No. 11 Loyola (Md.) and current No. 14 Ilofstra and blowout losses to No. 19 Ohio State {11-5) and No. 6 Virginia (14-8). 
Notre Dame looks to end their losing stretch Thursday as they host the Butler Bulldogs at Moose Krause Stadium at 3:30 p.m. Butler returns eight starters from its 5-8 team of a year ago. 
Corrigan, who was frustrated after the disappointing Ohio State loss, is anxious his team has not settled into any type of comfort­able zone or style of play on the field. I le is unsure the team can handle the various tempos that top teams have been throwing their way. 
Granted, the schedule has not been kind to the Irish, as seven of their nine opponents so far have been ranked. Playing without leading point man Matt Howell. as he recuperates from an appendec­tomy, does not help Notre Dame either. 
Still, the expectations Corrigan and the team had for this season were way above a 5-4 record at this point in the season. 
Even more significant than the record on paper is the way the team has been playing of late. A lack of fundamentals and learn defense has led to disastrous con­sequences. The play of freshman Pat Walsh and junior Dan Berger have kept the Irish close, but the team is still struggling to find a niche. 
"We need to find a rhythm and we haven't done that yet," Corrigan said. 
On a positive note, Notre Dame is 3-1 at home this season. The last time the Irish hosted the Bulldogs in 2001, Notre Dame spanked Butler, 12-3. Last sea­son's game was closer, but not by much. The Irish tallied four goals in the first quarter and Dan Berger scored three on the day as the team came away with a 12-8 road victory. 
Notre Dame is 9-1 all-time against Butler, a statistic that bodes well for the men's chances Thursday. 
Then again, they had also won nine of the last ten against Ohio State before Sunday.

Hungry for a win, Irish prevail 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 

After a. losing two matches in a row. the Irish regained their confidence and bright­ened hopes for the rest of the season when they defeated Ball State 5-2 Wednesday at Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Although the Cardinals, 13-7, began the match by winning the doubles point, the Irish won three straight singles matches to pull ahead, 3-1. The three remaining matches all extended to the third set -the seventh time this has happened to the Irish in eleven matches. 
In the end, the Irish won two of those as they moved to 7-11 on the season and pre­p are to face off with No. 13 Kentucky Sunday in their regular season's penulti­mate event. 
Tri-captain Luis Haddock was once again in position to clinch a match Wednesday, and his 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 triumph over former St. Joseph (South Bend) High School player Chris Varga gave the Irish the much sought-after victory. 
Haddock, ranked 97th nationally, has contended with several ranked players of late and has seen some successes, including his recent wins over No. 55 Johan Brunstrom and No. 63 Thomas Haug, dur­ing Irish losses to Southern Methodist and Minnesota, respectively. Since spring break began, he has had two losses to ranked players -No. 14 Todd Widom of Miami and No. 67 Marcus Bernston of Boise State. 
Patrick Buchanan was the initial player to direct the Irish towards their 14th straight victory over the Cardinals. He easily top­pled Ball State's Klint Knable,6-4, 6-1. Then tri-captain Brian Farrell defeated Matt Laramore in 6-3 straight sets before tri-captain Matt Scott put Notre Dame with­in a point of victory and gave Haddock the opportunity to clinch. 
Scott obtained his eighth win in his last 11 matches playing at the No. 2 flight by topping Matthew Baccarani 7-6 {7-5), 6-3. 
Nicolas Lopez-Acevedo, playing in the last match on the court, topped Patrick Thompson 6-3. 3-6, 7-5. 
Brent D'Amico yielded the Cardinals their only singles victory of the day when he was defeated by Kevin Burnett, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. With Burnett's win, the Cardinals brought the score to 3-2 with Haddock's and Lopez­Acevedo's matches still undecided. 
The Cardinals swept the Irish in doubles. At the top of the lineup, Baccarani and Burnett top the duo of D'Amico and Scott 8­
5. Then Knable and Andy Rhodes defeated the junior/sophomore pair of Ben Hatten and Paul McNaughton 8-5. After the dou­bles point was clinched, the Cardinals added to their initial domination with a 9-8 (7-5) victory over Farrell and Haddock at the No. 2 flight. 
Notre Dame's next opponent, Kentucky. recently defeated the 19th-ranked Auburn Tigers 4-2 at their home courts. The Wildcat roster includes 13th-ranked Jesse Witten and 65th-ranked Karim Benmansour, who both were defeated in their singles matches against Auburn.

Belles fall to Albion in conference match 
By LISA REIJUl.A 
Sports Writer 
A strong Albion squad defeated the Saint Mary's April 8 by an 8-1 score. The Britons {13-4) won five of six singles matches to remain unbeaten in the MIAA confer­ence with a 3-0 record. 
With the loss, the Belles dropped to 2-2 in the MIAA and 10-3 overall for the spring season. The Belles haven't lost two conference games in one season since the 2000 season, when the Belles finished 5-2. 
Junior co-captain Kaitlin Cutler was the lone singles winner for Saint Mary's on the afternoon, as she beat Albion's Betsy Netherton 6-4, 6-2 at No. 3 singles. At the No. 1 singles spot, Briton senior Amiee Greene defeated Saint Mary's Jeannie Knish 7-6 (7­4), 6-2. 
In the second flight match, Albion's Katie Tornga won over Kristen Palombo 6-4, 5­7, 7-5 in a close battle of two freshmen players. At No. 4 singles, Karen Dumas outlast­ed Saint Mary's' Kris Spriggle 6-2, 2-6. 6-2. The loss was Spriggle's first of the spring season. 

In No. 5 singles, Briton sophomore Emily Dumas defeated Elisa Ryan 6-1, 6-1. Albion continued their near­s weep in the No. 6 singles match, when Caitlyn Campbell won over Angela Sandner 6-2, 6-2. 
In doubles action, the Britons swept the Belles to ensure their victory. At No. 1 doubles, Albion's Emily Dumas and Greene beat the Belles' Knish/Palombo pairing 6-4, 6-3. At the No. 2 spot, the Belles' duo of Cutler and Byan lost to Tornga and Netherton by a 6-1, 2-6. 3-6 score. Rounding out doubles play was Albion's victory at No. 3, as Karen Dumas and Amy Esh defeated Spriggle and Lindsay Cook. 
The team will have several days to refocus until resuming play at the Midwest Invitational in Madison, Wis. this Friday and Saturday.

Irish claim their first Big East victories in doubleheader 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Sports Writer 
The Irish finally got their first two Big East matches of the season out of the way Wendesday, and thanks to some timely hitting, managed to also come away with their first two Big East wins of the season. 
The Irish won the first game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh 5-4, thanks to a five­run seventh inning rally for the victory. Notre Dame completed the sweep by beating the Panthers 4-1 in the second game, behind near-perfect pitching from freshman Heather Booth. 
The Big East victories have been a long time coming for the Irish, who have had their first six conference matches post­poned due to inclement weath­er. 
The Irish offense was sparked by a bases-loaded double by Andrea Loman in the seventh inning of game one. Mallorie Lenn hit her second home run of the season in the second game, a two-run shot. 
In game one, the Irish fell behind early, as starting pitcher Steffany Stenglein was victim­ized by the home run. Francesca DiMaria led off the bottom of the first with a solo shot, and Casey Pickard fol­lowed, giving the Panthers back-to-back home runs and a 2-0 lead before the Irish had even recorded an out. 
Stenglein worked a scoreless second inning, but did not last past the third, as Heather Andrews hit a two-run double in the third inning to give Pittsburgh a four-run advan­tage. 
Pitcher Carrie Wisen entered the game in relief for the Irish and shut down the Panther offense for the rest of the game, allowing only one hit over 4 1/3 innings. 
Panther starter Nikki Gasti kept the Irish offense at bay for most of the game, allowing only one hit over the first six innings. With only one inning left in the game, the Irish finally solved Gasti in the seventh. 
Shortstop Andria Bledsoe led off with a single, but was thrown out at second on Liz Hartman's fielder's choice. First-baseman Lisa Mattison then reached on an error by the Panther second baseman. 
Pittsburgh's shaky offense continued when Lenn then reached base on an error by the third baseman, which allowed Hartmann to come home and score the first run for the Irish, while Mattison reached third and Lenn moved up to second on the throw home. 
Nicole deFau came up next, but hit a weak pop-up to short that put the Irish one out away from losing. Megan Ciolli kept the rally alive with a perfect squeeze bunt that allowed Mattison to score. 
Kellie Middleton, pinch-hit­ting for senior Alexis Madrid, drew a walk to load the bases for Loman. 
Loman came threw with a double to centerfield that scored all three runners and gave Notre Dame a 5-4 lead. Meagan Ruthrauff grounded out to end the inning, but solid pitching by Wisen in the bottom of the seventh made the win stand up for the Irish. 
The Irish offensive surge con­tinued into game two of the series, with Notre Dame jump­ing on top early in the first with two runs off a double by Ruthrauff. 
Pittsburgh would score in the second after an error by the Irish, but it would be the only run the Panthers would get off of Rooth. Booth pitched all seven innings, only allowing three walks and one hit. 
The Irish scored two insur­ance runs in the fourth to put the game away. Mattison drew a walk before Lenn launched a shot over the fences to give Notre Dame a 4-1 lead. 
The team returns home for two more Big East doublehead­ers this weekend, facing the two teams currently tied for first in the conference. 
The Irish face St. John's on Friday at 4 p.m. and Seton Hall on Sunday at 11 a.m.

Axford K's his way to 12th straight Irish win 
By BRYAN KRONK Senior S1affWri1er 
When the hitting got cold for the Irish. John Axford got hot. 
The sophomore right-hander struck out 12 batters, and some key defensive plays kept the Irish in the game before a late offensive rally boosted Notre Dame to a 7-1 victory over Western Michigan at Eck Stadium Wednesday night. 
"[Assistant coach David Grewe and II both thought that it was going to be a low-scoring game," head coach Paul Mainieri said. "That kid (Broncos' starter Keith] Perez is a good pitcher -he beat us in Kalamazoo a couple years ago. We just had the feeling it was going to be a low-scoring game." 
And it was a low scoring game for much of the duration. The Irish were able to manu­facture single runs in the first and fifth innings, while a solo home run in the third for Western Michigan tied the game for a while. 
Not that either team didn't produce any opportunities. 
Two key scoring opportunities by the Broncos late in the game were thwarted by impressive defensive plays by the Irish. 
With a runner on second and two outs in the top of the seventh, a Western Michigan player singled to center field. The runner rounded third as center fielder Brennan Grogan fired his relay throw, which arrived in plenty of time for catcher Javi Sanchez to tag the runner out at home. 
"Grogan made a major league play throw­ing the guy out at the plate," Mainieri said. "Perfect throw, hit the cutoff man on one bounce, great catch by Javi. Kept the game 2-1 and kept Axford in line for a win."

Frigid Bookstore courts get rowdy in first round 
 Boom boxes, plastic penguins and thwarted thongs all decorate Wednesday's first-round games 
ByMAITLOZAR Associare Sports Ediror 
They both had boom boxes. 
They both had beverages on the court. 
One team was drinking from a two-liter bottle while the other was using the tradi­tional blue plastic cup. What separated these two teams were their mascots. 
Four Fingers and a Thumb had a plastic Christmas penguin while Verdad o Falso? We're Bowed? had a six-foot inflatable penis. 
On the court, Four Fingers and a Thumb was able to overcome all of these distrac­tions and win 21-13 in the first round of the Bookstore Basketball tournament. 

The plastic penguin routinely sat at the top of the key on offense and defense for Four Fingers and a Thumb. 
Meanwhile, the inflatable penis stayed mainly on the sidelines and was used to hit some of Verdad o Falso?'s players as needed. 
Despite the 30-degree temperatures, a small pool was courtside filled with water for any potential swimmers -there were no takers. 
Hoop While Rap 21, Team Thlz 12 
Thankfully it was cold. Originally, Thiz planned to play wearing nothing but thongs from the waist down. 
Due to the cold temperatures, Thiz kept their shorts on and only attempted to pull down their shorts in order to distract the opposition. 
Hoop While Rap stayed focused on the bas­ket and took advantage of its height in using the inside game to defeat Thiz and move on to the second round.
