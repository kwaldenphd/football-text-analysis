British comedian MartyFeldman. whose bulging 
blue eyes and wacky style brought laughter to millions of moviegoers, has died ofa massive heart attack, his agent said Friday. Michael Maslansky, manager and agent ofthe 49-year-old comedian, said in Los Angeles that Feldman died Thursday night at about 9:.:'10 
p.m. CST ( 10:30 p.m. EST) in his Mexico City hotel room hours after completing his role in a new movie. "Paramedics were called to the hotel room, but they were unable to revive him," Maslansky said. Feldman had just finished work on "Yellow Beard," a spoofof pirate movies in which he starred with James Mason and Madeline Kahn. Although a British citizen, the comedian had lived in Hollywood for several years with his wife, Lauretta, who survives him. They had no children. A spokesman for a local funeral home said arrangements were being made to send Feldman's body to Los Angeles. Maslansky said funeral plans were pending. -AP

The No. _>, domestic carmaker "is running out of some parts" at l '.S. assembly plants because of the month-long strike by some I0,000 Chrysler Canadian autoworkers, said Thomas Miner, Chrysler vice president ofindustrial relations. "I think that ifthis strike continues, ifwe don't -god forbid -get hack to work (Dec. 1.~) ... then I think we're going to have to let out some work rather quickly," \liner said. The Canadiam struck Nov. '; after talks broke oft' when Chrysler said it could n?t afford an immediate pay raise workers demanded. Chrys­ler has moved some machines to make the needed Canadian parts into U.S. plants, although Miner said production of the parts has not started. The United Auto Workers insists its members will not do struck work, and Miner says if that is true, Chrysler has "sources lined up." -AP

Patient faces lung problem.s 
SALT LAKE CITY ( AP) Artificial-heart recipient Barney Clark sipped water and juice yester­day as doctors made plans to get him out of bed and on his feet. 
The plans came less than a day af­ter Clark wa~ taken into surgery when air from ruptured lung sacs began to leak out. 
Some of sacs were closed with staples by Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who implanted the mec­hanical heart Thursday. 
Clark, 61, a retired Seattle dentist, is the first person to receive a per­manent artificial heart. 
The air leaks, which were unr­elated to the implantation of the mechanical heart, caused some tissue just below the surface of the skin to become "bubbly, almost like puffed rice," said Dr. Chase Peter­son, vice president for health sciences at the University of Utah hospital. 
The ~welling on his left chest and neck caused by the air leaks was barely perceptible yesterday, Peter­son said. 
"There's no more leakage, even from small spots," he said. Clark wao; listed in serious but stable condition. 
Clark, who was somewhat sleepy, visited with his family in his in· tensive care room, Peterson said. A tube placed tin his chest to suck out remaining air would be in place for four days to a week. 
The plan over the next several days was to get Clark eating food and walking, Peterson said. Clark was unable to walk when admitted to the hospital because his own heart had deteriorated. 
DeVries had feared the air could be leaking from the heart, which is powered by compressed air, or from the tubes that connect it to an air compressor, Peterson said, but that was not the cao;e. 
The surgeon saw the lungs bub­bling when the chest was opened, Peterson said, and he stapled several sacs shut and allowed tiny ones to remain because the body has the ability to "self.~al" them.

Although a senior State Department official told reporters Friday that "real progress" has been made in resolving ll.S.-European dif­ferences since Shultz took office, many problems remain. 
Among them: 
-France's refusal to go along with a U.S.-arranged accord on a new western strategy for economic rela­tions with the Soviet Union. Reagan gave that accord as his reason for lif­ting li.S. sanctions on Soviet pipeline devdopment. 
-Suspicion in Europe that the Reagan administration is not yet serious enough to negotiate an arms control agreement with Moscow that would eliminate the need to deploy new U.S. nuclear missiles in Europe. 
-The decision of Spain's new socialist prime minister, Felipe Gon­zalez, to rethink Spain's entry into NATO. 

-A whole array of trade and economic issues, including U.S. demands that Europeans end sub­sidies of agricultural goods that serve to keep out l'.S. farm exports. Many Europeans believe Reagan's economic policies have made the world-wide recession worse. 
But the most attention. especially at the NATO foreign ministers meeting, will focus on deve::loping an allied stance toward the Andropov government and a common response to any moves hy .\loscow toward better relations.

COCK-A-DOODLE's a dandy 

I
n association with the ~c::an O'Casey festival hdd this past weekend by the College of Arts and Letters. the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatrc:: Department presented a production of ()'Casey's play Cock-u-Doodle Dant~)' Thursday and Friday in the Little Theatre of Moreau Hall at ~aint Mary's. 
Joe musumeci 

theatre review 
The presentation had two major flaws, neither ofwhich could bc:: blamed on the members of the production -the Little Theatre is the culprit in the first case, the playwright in the second. The most annoying was the absurd level ofthe temperature in the theatre; I sweated through the entire perfi>r­mance in shirt sleeves and I shudder to think what it must have been like for the actors. The second tlaw was the lack ofan intermission. The play ran on to nearly two hours, and though ()'Casey's script does not make provision for an intermission, opportunity enough was available to insert one. 
There. Now that that is out of the way, there is little to he said about the production that is not com­plimentary. The play itselt'~ one of O'Casey's later works, was written while he wa.~ in a self-imposed exile from his native Ireland, one from which he never returned. The play is a bitingly satirical commentary on the state of the Church, politics, the sexes, and life in general on the Emerald Isle. 
The play begins in front of the house of Michael Mathraun, played by Paul Clay. Mathraun and Sailor Mahan, played by Jack Arends, engage in an argument over the price Mathraun will pay to have his turf hauled to town. In the course of the conversation. it is revealed that .\1athraun believes his house to be enchanted with evil spirits resulting from the visit of his daughter hy his first -wife, Loreleen (played by :vtary Link). 
This Sl'ts up thl· main action ofthe play, which revolves around the in­vasion of the town by a large and rambunctious rooster, the "cock" of the title. 
()'Casey has set the large fowl as a symbol ofgentle fun and tolerance l(>r new ideas, something he fiHmd distinctly lackng in his country of birth. The cock is represented in the ND/S:VIC production by Kathleen Maccio, who appears as a masked dancer carrying the head of a cock on a high pole. All Maccio's apearances on (and off) stage con­sist of rollicking dances through the areas of the stage, accompanied by gentle, flute-based tunes which ad­mirably inspire the moods ofserene gaiety O'Casey was aiming at. 
The conflict of the play is simplicity itself: the younger mem­bers of the character plot accept the cock; the older ones, in particular, the priests and :\lathraun, do not. This leads to the eventual exodus of the freer spirits and the abandon­ment of Mathraun in his stolid world. ()'Casey's message, follow­ing as it does on the exodus of the cock and those who followed it, seems to he that the gaiety the people search li>r can be found right among themselves, if they will only open their eyes and accept it; this lack ofacceptance is what drove the happy fowl away. just as it drove O'Casey. 
The production seen this weekend was obviously designed as a complement to the O'Casey fes­tival held by the College ofArts and Letters. Costuming and sets were minimal, though effective. The costumes (with a few clerical excep­tions) were ordinary street clothes which served to give the characters a flavor of the Ireland they were

However, there are a few places and times where we can truly escape the

pressures and relax in an intimate, homestyle Christmas setting. One such setting is the Madrigal Christmas Dinners, an evening of 16th century food and entertain­ment which wa.o; presented Decem­ber 2-S, nightly at 7 pm in the Regina Hall North Lounge at St. Mary's Col­lege. 
The decor ofthe lounge was tradi­tional Christmas sea.~on. with red tablecloths, candlelit tables, green wreaths, and holly gracing the lounge. Only the neatly-sewn family seals ofroyalty hinted that we had moved back in time over -!00 years. A traditional dining table. burning fireplace, and a pair of royal thrones comprised the stage. The table ser­vers wore traditional 16th century clothing: tights and full-sleeved shirts for the men, whereas the women donned the brightly­colored long skirts ofthe time.

When characters wne supposed to be speaking from inside the house. they climhed the laddcr and held up one or morc of th'e frames to rcpresent windows. 
The: show. htTeft as it was ofspec­tacle. dcpendcd vcry heavily on the pt-rf(>rmanccs ofthe actors, and in most places succeeded nicely. \lac­cio's mute imerpretation of the cock's presence wa.~ very per­suasive.

As the chidcleric of the area, Father Dominen. Dan Devine gave a powerful performmance, behevahle even at the extrenws of the priest's character. :VIary Link, as Mathraun's daughter. gave a creditahle performance, though she seemed not quite M> devilishly charming as ()'Casey might have hoped. All in all, the entire cast gave a very enjoyahle performance. and it is to their credit that the audience remained despite the unrelieved length of the show and the heat in the theatre. The choreography hy Kathleen Maccio was simple but enjoyable, and her own dancing was very engaging. The accompanying music, for which director Reginald Bain seems to have enlisted nearly his entire family, was pleasantly and faultlessly performed. The use of heavy Irish accents at some points detracted from the overall effect due to occasional inconsistencies. hut in general was well-handled. 
I personally enjoyed the evening a great deal; the production wa.~ not a highly polished effort, but wa.~ well­performed, and served as an excel­lent vehicle for the sparkling wit of one of Ireland's greatest playwrights.

followed. Thus will end the late nights ofcramming, trying to ac· complish all that should have been done many moons before, and you will find that you will he at least caught up in your work, ifnot ahead. 
I can't do it. 
Case in point: The last schedule I made out was a one-day ~chnluh:. and hv the end ofthe day I still hadn't gotten my hair cut, and it was .., before I realized that I had forgot· ten to pick up my sister from school. I had inadvertently cro~sed out "Pick up :\1aric" instead of"Buy bread... By the time we ate the ,urplus ofbread it had outlived its ~:xpiration date and" as stale. 
\ly procrastination is sinful to those who an: ahk to follow an or· ganized schedui<' in their school­work. They look upon me with scorn and disgust like I were some low-life that crecpcd out ofSodom or (;omorrah. I almost fed as if they go home and pray for people like me at night. in accordance with their schedule. ofcourse. I break the foremost of their ten command· ments: I blow off everything I have to do until scant hour~ before its deadline. The result ofthi~ b often a deed which. on the Organized Scheduler's Code of Ethics. is tan· tamount to violation of number six on those tablets :\1oses received oh· so-long-ago. 
The All-:\lighter. Say it to one of the Organized Schedulers. and they 'hrink back in queasin~:ss. closing their eyes in bittercontempt. But we Procrastinators stand proud against the Organized Schedulers. The All­Nighter is the ultimate form ofthe results ofblowing off. 
There are (and believe me, I know) five stages to the All·Nighter. The first is the Declaration ofIntent Stage. This can be taken care ofany time before nightfall. I usually do it at dinner. Sometime in the middle of a conversation about the preceding night's football or basketball game, I quietly interrupt and say, "I'm going to pull an all-nighter." Sometimes this is greeted with ooh's and ahh's, but most ofthe time my companions merely look at me strangely, look at each other confusedly, look back at me amusedly, and resume conversa­tion. 
The second stage is the Blow-off Stage. It hegins after dinner for me and last~ until about ten o'clock. I know I'm going to be up all night. so the present becomes free time and i~ a continuation of the Declaration of Intent stage. This is the time when I gloat in my pride of being a Procras­tinator. aimlessly wandering about the hall. picking out the Organized Schedulns and informing them of what lays ahead for me. \lore often than not I can usuallY make one of them sick. until they arl.' hJrccd to kick me out of the room. But O(:ICC niy watch ( COil\Tniently ten minutes hehind) hits ten o'clock. I'm off to work. 
The third stage is the Industrial Stage. As its name implies, this is when I finally sit down and start writing or studying. After what seems like hours I take a break. It is eleven o'clock. I consume the con­tents ofa hag ofFritos. and reluctant· ly return to my desk. The hours wear by slowly; the work is oozing out even more slowlv. Hints of panic manifest themseives in hrok~n pen· cil points, typographical errors, or unas~igned page~ read. Whatever traces of insomnia had inhabited my hodv before are now gone, and my sligl;t drowsiness has ~uddc:nly con­verted itself into heavy exhaustion. In desperation I jump out of my seat and out into the hallways, meander· ing about in an attempt to keep awake. This is when the fourth stage ofthe all-nighter begins. 
The fourt 11 stage is the Giddiness Stage. Singing, imitations, unusual acrobatic movements, and incredih· ly silly actions are all a part of this stage. One night someone had left their interhall football gear outside their door, ~.nd I donned the helmet and the thigh pads for no reason at all. Obviously I had to do something with my find. and ignoring the fact that it was three in the morning, I ran around the dorm. hutting various doors with the helmet. In the study lounge I came acro:;s a kllow Procrastinator named Tony, and he too had reached the Giddiness Stage. He was singmg Doors songs in the voice offoz:de Bear. and as I left him he was still ~.creaming, "Come on. come on, come on, com~: on. come on now touch me baby .. 
The fifth :~rage is th~: Re~olution Stage. when I tlnally resolve to com· pkte my untinishnl proj~:ct hecausl.' I no longer haYe any choice in the matter if I want to get it dont· on time. \ly en:lid~ are hean. and soon. too soDn, it is becoming light outside as the sun rises from its hiding place behind the :-.lcmorial Library.

The light change~ and I cross the street. 
Waiting at the light is an old red Porsche with its roofdown. In the seat arc three blondes, all with teased hair with dark streaks. I think one of them was a girl, but you can neYer be too sure in this town. They looked at me like I was a ctgl.'d animal imported from another countrY. I wonder what they thought when they saw me -not helonglng to any group in the neighborhood, yet not a camera-toting tourist either.

Halfway down the block there was a group of people. Actually. there were tu•o groups.

Forget the buses -save face 
Celebrating students greeted the buses carrying the Fighting Irish foot­ball team on Saturday, Nov. 6 with a rousing (and, of late, also rare) display ofschool spirit. 
The emotional outburst, to mark the victory over top-ranked Pittsburgh, unfortunately was quite destructive. More than SHOO worth ofdamage was done to the Transpo buses. 
Yet. that destruction pales in comparison lO the wreckage of ad­ministrative and student response to the bill for those damages. 
The administration, represented by Vice President for Student ."\.ffairs Fatherjohn Van Wolvlear, passed the Transpo bill onto the student govern­ment. 
Student government, led by Student Body President Lloyd Burke, took Van Wolvlear's suggestion that they pay the bill as ludicrous and unneces­san:. 
They chose-wrongly -to make light of the matter, without tirst han­dling the immediate problem. 
Were life like "The Gong Show," student government's "Save the Buses" campaign would be a short act. As soon as Burke began his stream of "funny" lines about "What's S800 to an athletic program that makes mil­lions?" the gong would sound and out would come the hook. The audience would be laughing at the hapless would-be comic. 
But Van Wolvlear didn't laugh -reports have it he didn't even crack a smile. l~e did comment, however, that the students had no basis for expect­ing the University to cover for student irresponsibility. (It seems that the administration has forgotten the students it saved from harsh European drug laws last year. ) 
:Vtedia coverage no doubt worsened the situation -quotes taken out of context and harsh statements left unchallenged often make speakers appear heartless and foolish. 
Student government, the administration and the media mtssed an oppor­tunity for a constructive response to a destructive situation. 
Imagine what might have happened if those involvn1 had reacted in a spirit of understanding and cooperation: The l !niversity pays the bill, but \"an Wolvlt:ar asks for a meeting with athletic department and student government officials to decide how to split ultimate responstbility for the bill. The athletic department pays halfofthe bill in gratitude t<>r the show of support, but issues a plea against over-exuberance. Student government agrees to pay the other half of the bilL and also r~ffers to reimburse the. athletic department. Suddenly, ideas on ways to raise the money come pouring in from student senators: a benefit softball game with athletic department otficials against student government members. a benefit touch football game, a mud volleyball contest, a bowl-a-th(m or skate-a-rhon; per­haps even a Burke-Van \\'olvlear-Gerry Faust dunking booth would do. Ami The Obseruer gives favorable publicity to the efforts. 
But perhaps, as many are fond of pointing out, :'-Jotre Dame is indeed not the real world, so expecting real solutions to probkms mav be foolish. 
Thus, rather than $800 standing a..o,; the insignificant sum it seems to be, it becomes a high price paid, in part, by the student government in the form of its apparent alienation of the administration, and, in part, by the administra­tion in the form of its seeming insensitivity to the students.

Emerson once remarked that ""A foolish consbtency is the hobgoblin of little mind~. adorn\ hy little statesmen. and philosophers, and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do... 
\Jow however true this quote might seem un tlrst bounce. it is plainly ohviou~ that it won't hold up well on second or third hearing. .-\nd the reason for this is simple: w contradict this :-.tatement b· to state the truth: it is the little mind. vour usual statesman. philosop­her. and divine who revds in incon~i~tency. who enjm·s being misunderstood. Remember the old slogan from the Dr Pepper commer­cial: .. Dr. Pepper. you're ~o misunder~tooll'"' Your u~ual politician is the Dr., Peppn of today. fie is the master ""lonelv heart"" ( w mix

dark 'ophistry, and self-contradiction; oftice is 
what the little politician rum t(>r; the truth i' 
something he usually runs trom. If you want to 
he consistent. to speak the truth. clearly and 
plainly, then it is better hy 1;1r to he a hoh· 
goblin, however frightening or unpopular you 
may appear to be. 
Unfortunately. being a hobgoblin can put a per~on in an extremely vulnerable position. especially in countries where basic human rights are neglected, ignored or hlatantlv and overtly abused by repressive govern~1enb throughout the world. Each year. hundreds of people are imprisoned against their will with· out due process of law. for mert"ly speaking their minds. Amnesty Internattonal, the Nobel Prize winning human right~ organiztion. through a series of letter writings and publicity campaigns, attempts to help the many pt·ople who. by speaking the truth. have heen detained as political pri~oner~.

Praising Observer sports coverage 
/Jear Editor: 

The Observer ought to be commended for its frank coverage of coaches· squabbling on the Notre Dame sidelines late in N.D.'S loss to Penn State. The confusion was evident to those of us who were part of the television audience. 
It would be wise prior to selection of the next coach -an event which is hopefully not far off·-for Notre Dame's administration to take a long. hard look at what sort of public impression the l'niversity b making with its football program. It's no laughing matter that Faust is being laughed at. for football is the sole. limited contact that mil­lions of people have with the university. 
"Jotre Dame was well served during the Dan Devine vears. The coach often looked as though he\\ ere at death"s door. hut the team did not. It won important games. came from 
behind to do so. and triumphed due to or· ganization and canny coaching. And. most important, Notre Dame t<JOtball conveyed the image of a planned, rational game-not an emotional rclea!'e or exercise in oldtime religion. 
The favorable impression was good to have. Despite ~0 years· effort, Father lies­burgh has still yet to convince manv secular observers that Notre Dame is not a football factory. The university is still seen as the place that produced Joe Montana and Alan Page, not a~ training ground for governors, college professors, physidans. journalbts, judges and promising members of the legal profession (such a~ Mr. Page). 
The Faust era has presented a thrtl\vback view of Notre Dame football. Tlw coach roam~ the sidelines like a caged tiger. )Tiling at referees and twbting his face in angubh when something goes wrong. During com· mericial intermtss1on, ht· hawb trtps to Rome. When talking to press or alumni, he peddles the sort of rah-rah piety popularizcd in the movie ""Knute Ro<;kne: All American."" 

On the tield. meanwhile. defeat is being snatched from the jaws of victory. Trick plays backtire. Untried quarterbacks appear on the tleld in crucial situations. The schedule's patsies, tcams like Air Force and Oregon. suddenly tlnd they can pu~h around the li>otball power that usually beats them by scores like -t9-0. 
It all seem~ reminiscent of an occasion in tht· earlv 19SO"s. when the "Religious Bul­letin·· publbhed by the ;\;_ () chaplain·~ office bl..1111ed ~uu:es~ive los~e~ to Purdue and In· diana on a drop in thc number of com· munion wafers distributed on '>aturday morning~ bdi>re the games. Student~ were urged to "hit thc rail"" for the team (:\otre Dame wem on to .: "-_,.I record tor the year.) 
Perhaps a rcturu to old·tllne r.1h rah foot­ball is what Father Ned Joyce..1 yocal con· sen·ative among '\iotre Dame administrators. had in mind two year~ ago when he selected Faust. Dan Devine was in official disfavor, for reasons never explained. anti exited with few word~ of tribute from the l :niversitv"s glosw magazine 
However. the exercise ha~ clearly backfired. The emotional. theatrical debacle of Faust"~ coaching i~ a public embarrass· ment to an institution that ~tre~ses "excellence"" Jnd ~eeks to cement it~ claim as "the world"' tiro;t great Catholic unin:r­sitv. ·

And to all, cJ tgood night' 
Since thi~ is my last column beti>re Christmas. I would like 10 examine a few of the things that have been piquing my imagina­tion as I think of the coming holiday season and the accompanying cease-fire in the never­ending war between me and my classes.

Christma~ has a special signiticance for those of us whom the government lumps un­der the label of"full-time students," especially those like the students at Notre Dame who finish the semester before going home to partake ofthe wassail and eggnog (not to men­tion the home-cooked meals) with our families and hometown friends. 
For those who have a great deal of work to do at the end of the semester, the holiday season hegins only when we arrive home. This means, ofcourse, that all gift shopping is done either at the bookstore two hours before one embarks on whatever form of transportation one has been able to commandeer for the trek home. or during the few shopping days

The hues ofautumn have touched the state­ly trees along Wood Street again. But it will not he the same. ":\1r. Lowellville." Ormond Donatelli, Police Chid Village of Lowellville, Ohio. will nor be standing there in the middle ofthe crossing seeing that the school children make it safely. 
It was a constant concern of his, that the young make it safely, not just across the street, but in the journey of life. He wa~ reluctant to send offending youths lO courts or jails out of town. "The things they learn there won't he good for them." he would remark. And so he w<mld spend his time and energy far beyond the demands of duty in counseling. correct­ing, and encouraging youths who needed available after one has been repatriated with the "homeland."" I. per~onally. resent the fact that, since exam~ this year don't end until the .22nd, the space of time left me for Christmas shopping, winding down. etc., is a paltry thr·~c days. The amount ofeffective work that can he done in three days, amidst the panic-stricken tlight of last minute shoppers that clog the malls during this particular shopping season, is so minimal it foregoes mentioning. But anyway ... 
One word seems to have dominated the first few paragraphs of this meandering little column . . . Home. The coming break has come to mean that more than anything ebe for me. The fall and spring breaks are just too short these davs to be more than a change of backdrop for the endless papers. projects and various readings that bc:;come the he-all/end­all of the typical college student's daily routine. Summer is Home. but means full-time work in the real world and sometimes evt·n more of a grind than I encounter during the school year. But Christmas is Home. 
What has become the "Christmas season" for the college student (that is, the time h·~­tween the end ofone semester and the begin­ning ofrhe next) is the only real break we are afforded in our career here. One semester is 

done -the worries ofwork and the almighty GPA can be ~et aside for the moment; but we remain juniors, or seniors, or whatever. Chrbtmas is a time when we can see our parents, the friends who have been labouring at other institutions of higher learning -a little warp in the academic year, free ofobliga­tions, when we can stop and look at what it is we are doing and why we are doing it. Christmas is a time to remember that the people we love are still there and that "family" is a real thing. 
Since I took to the :\1idwest to tinish my schooling. all these things have impressed themselves upon me with a growing ferocity. As a junior in college. I am thinking more and more about what I can do to justil)" my exist­ence and fill my stomach when I finally leave this haven of ivory (Belden brick') towers. And the thought that I may not be able to do it in the same town as that in which my family dwells has become a real consideration. 
I suspect that others, too. may realize hy now that Christmas is a time that must be set aside to see the family, having come to grips with the fact that it may. in the not-too-distant future, be the only time. 
So, Christma~ is a time for many things: relaxation. stock-taking. togetherness. But

peoples' eyes, not to mention enraging a few tempers. The group was The ;\lational Democratic Policy Committee. 
Having talked with :vtr. Andrew Rotstein of the group's Chicago branch, I gained some in­sight into the committee·~ position. 
They believe that the freeze on nuclear weapons and particularly nuclear energy is a sub~tantial part ofa plot to re\erse the gears of technology to reduce the world to a "pre­industrial teudal \lalthusian nation-state." 
"It i:-. these 'stop-the-world, I want to get off kind of people who are attending these nuclear peace rallie~ ... ~ays Rotstein.

He believes that a real defeme against nuclear war is through the advanced technol­ogy of beam weapons. These weapons would destrov ICB:vts (intercontinental ballistic missil~s") in mid-tlight, before initiation of the chain reaction explosion. 
\1r. -Rotstein's points are well-taken. Economic hardship is indeed a prime mover in the inception of war. And alleviating some of this economic hardship by using advanced technology. of which energy is an integral part, should be a major concern ofours today. 
But I would like to address the~e points with two thoughts. first. is the major concern of the nuclear freeze centered about the reversal of technology to obtain a "pre­industrial teudal \talthusian nation-~tate 1 '' 
I think that the main concern ofthese "stop­the-world, I wa!lt to get oft'' people is with the extremely dangerous inherent qualitie~ of nuclear weapon~ and to some degree, nuclear ener~.'Y· The capability to literally annhilate most of the life on this planet and to destroy much of the earth bevond recognition would. he another side of the coin to look at. 
Second,' doc~ the energy he talks about necessarily have to he nuclear energ,·1 With all of the rapid devdopmenb in cnergv al­ment enough' ;\luclear disarmament would al­leviate much of the threat nuclear weapons pose, but for all the limitations on nuclear weapon~ we can impose. the nuclear technol­ogy remains. There would not be much to in­hibit a radical group. or even an organized government, to impose a nuclear attack. 

But are beam weapons the answer' \lr. Rotstein himself admit~ that they would only give us a "breathing space." He agreed that there are very good possibilities olmanufac­turers of ICB:\1s to circunl\"ent the inhibiting capabilities of beam weapon~. and of beam weapons becomingoffensil•e weapons. 

Orbiting satellites capable of destroying wide areas of land (and everything and ev­.f)"Olle in them) through scatter pattern blasts is indeed an interesting (if not perverted) prospect. 
I am nor going to pretend that there are easy solutions to our world problems, hut I think that the extreme danger nuclear weapons pose demar>ds im_mediate action. And Mr. Rotstein and his group fail to act on ttb dan­ger. In tact, they add to it by prolonging the advancement in the technology that i~ ah!t: to destroy the life on this earth and that naturt which is so bountiful and beautiful.

Gretzky, from his post behind the net, fed the puck to Mark Messier to the left of the Kings' goal. Messier stepped around a defenseman and backhanded a pass to Anderson, who was alone in front of goaltender Gary Las­koski. He scored easily with a backhand.
