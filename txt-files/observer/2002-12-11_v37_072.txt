Students: TCEs could be more resourceful 
. Evaluations help university and teachers, but work needed to aid students 

By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
As the semester draws to a close, students will fill bubbles and answer questions for over 40,000 teacher-course evalua­tion surveys. 
While some students till out the scan sheet to make a pat­tern or scribble phrase responses to the short answers, the University uses TCEs in several ways to evalu­ate the professor and course. 
"It's a measure of a profes­sor's classroom performance. It's a measure of how well stu­dents feel they were taught," said Carol Mooney, vice presi­

dent and associate provost. "It's designed not simply to measure the professor's per­formance for tenure purposes but to help them analyze how the professor-can improve his teaching style." 
lnstitutional Research administers the TCEs and ana­lyzes results. Copies of the analysis from the scan sheet are sent to the instructor, department chair, college dean and Provost's Office in January after grades are released. The short answer sheets are sent only to the instructor. 
Mooney said the Office of the Provost uses TCEs when a pro-

Gator Bowl tickets go on sale 
By lAURAN WILLIAMSON 
News Writer 
It's official -the Irish are Gator Bowl bound. The only question now is how will students get tickets? 
Junior John Dee plans on attending the bowl game. "Although I'm very confi­dent we'll be going to another bowl next year, you can never be too sure." the Colorado native said. "I want to make sure that I go while we've got the chance. I'd hate to graduate without ever having been to a bowl." 

On Jan. 1, the Irish will face North Carolina State in Jacksonville, Florida's Alltel Stadium at 12:30 p.rn. A student ticket sale will take 
place Thursday at Gate 10 of the Joyce Center between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
Student tickets are for personal use and there is a limit of one ticket per stu­dent. Each student may bring up to six student IDs, including their own. when purchasing tickets at Gate

INSIDE COLUMN 


The big 0 

I was pretty excited a few weeks ago when I signed up for the last Inside Column of the semester. It was almost as exciting as when l got a gorgeous date for my formal. Oww!! I figure I just can't lose. 
But then I quickly realized that no one reads this article. Ever. 
However, what I can promise you is that I'll spare you any sob sto­ries of my years 

here at Notre  Matt Lutz  
Dame or why my  
fall break was  
better than yours.  Ad Manager  
Even though it  
was. I even won't  

talk about the alcohol policy which I can guarantee you will continue to change and parietals which I can guarantee you will continue to not 
change. 
For lack of space I'll get to the point. There is a negative reputa­tion associated with The Observer for a good number of people. Believe it or not, The Observer is not run by gremlins late into the night. Only part of that statement is true. 
Editors, writers, and people that can't figure out which door really leads to the men's room spend their time in the basement of South Dining Hall into the early morning. A majority of these people spend six hours or more doing their jobs which often pay nothing. The point is the amount of work poured into every.paper is amazing. I have the fortune of escaping hours before some people get to leave the office at 3 or 4 in the morning. These people usually have the paper as their first priority with classes and parties a distant second. I don't mean to say there aren't a large number of peo­ple on this campus that don't sacri­fice for us, especially all those that represent Notre Dame in sports. Maybe it's just my point to say there is another group that is sometimes overlooked for their sacrifices of a different sort. 
Sure, at the same time, there's a good amount of errors in the paper day in and day out. A lot of the things in the paper might appear to suck, including this article. On a completely different note, we all still lament the fact that there is no more Fourth & Inches or Befuddled and Bemused for that matter. 
Maybe something you didn't know about The Observer is that it's com­pletely student-run and won National Collegiate Newspaper of the year in 2001 and second place in 1999. We get to see a lot of other newspapers from other colleges, and they struggle sometimes to put out weekly editions. The overwhelming majority of people on campus proba­bly don't complain about the paper as much as what we hear, but it just might be a good thing the next time you pick up an Observer to remem­ber the pride a lot of people associ­ate with every edition. And if we don't have a period somewhere, or if the Phillies weren't covered in the paper (talk to the sports guy) maybe try and let it go.

Professors warn of bio-terrorism 
. More investment needed to prevent biological attacks 
Special lo The Observu 
The Dec. 7 edition of the scientific journal The Proceedings of the Royal Society of London contains a paper in which a team of University of Notre Dame biologists offer a framework that merges ecology and eco­nomics to identify optimal strategies, acceptable risks and the economic conse­quences of invasive species. 
David Lodge and Gary Lamberti, professors of bio­logical sciences, and Brian Leung, research associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, write that invasive species, which are increasing rapidly world­wide, are a major cause of extinctions and arc economi­cally expensive, costing the United States alone $137 bil­lion annually. Yet rigorous quantitative risk analysis frameworks for invasive species are lacking. 
The researchers present a quantitative bio-economic modeling framework to ana­lyze risks from invasive species to economic activity and the environment. 
Lodge coauthored an article in October in the journal Science that suggested a method of identifying invasive species that are likely to become nuisances if intro­duced in the Great Lakes. 
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is the independent scientific academy of the United Kingdom and is dedi­cated to promoting excellence in science.

Frank Rzeszutek, a former machinist for the Notre Dame physics department, died of a heart attack on Nov. 26. 
Physics machinist remembered 
By CAITLYN EARLY 
News Writer 

Prank Hzeszutek, a former machinist from the Notre Dame Physics department, died on Nov. 26 at Memorial Hospital after suffering a heart attack. 
Rzeszutek joined the Physics Department in 1969 after he emigrated from Poland, and retired in 1997. 
He worked as an instrument maker for 28 years at the University and designed techni­cal equipment for the Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering departments. He created machinery for Brookhaven and Argon National Laboratories. 
"Frank was an interesting man, there wasn't much he couldn't fix," said Don Gard, Rzeszutek's co-worker. "I've been in this business for over 30 years and worked with lots of different people, and I've never seen a man quite as meticulous and as skilled as

When Rzeszutek was not in Niewland Science I lall, he fixed the ovens and coolers at his family's bakery, Baker's Dozen Bake Shop in South Bend. He was also an active l'undraiser and organizer for a Catholic radio program broadcast out of Poland, known as Radio Marya. 
"My dad was a very dedicat­ed and generous man. He was even known to fix professors' cars in his free time," said his daughter, Lucy Rzcszutek, a junior FTT major at Notre Dame. 
The memorial service for Rzeszutck was held Nov. 29 at St. Adalbert's Church, South Bend and he was buried at St. Joseph's Cemetery. 
Rzeszutek is survived by his wife, Maria and their six chil­dren, Tony, Lisa. Margaret, Christopher, Donna and Lucy.

Idol

Faith Gospel Choir. 
But Tern has a secret weapon -a rich, captivating singing voice. She sings both alto and soprano. 
"It's like ... perfect," said Dawn Hogue, Tern's best friend of 10 years. 
That voice, in fact, brought a fellow contender to tears dur­ing the preliminary tryouts in Detroit. While Tern was warm­ing up by singing "O Holy Night," the girl next to her began to cry, amazed at the sound of her voice. 
"You should have seen her face," Tern said. "I've never had anything like that happen to me in my life. When I sing it's like God gives me a whole new voice. You don't realize how huge your blessings are until they're laid out before you.'' 
Despite her talent, Tern is humble. Deeply religious, she regards her voice as a gift from God and plans to practice in a corner by herself to avoid a similar incident. 
When Tern started college, the girl who had been singing since she could talk stopped performing in public, afraid that people wouldn't be impressed. 
"I lost my confidence," she said. "I don't know why. I was too worried of what people would think of me. [ couldn't hide it for very long. I think it's because God didn't want me to hide it." 
Tern reentered the spotlight last year when she joined Voices of Faith. She said she enjoys the opportunity to per­form and the friendships that the choir provides. 
'Tm doing it; I'm loving it. It's like going to Church," Tom said. "They're really excited [about American Idol]. They're encouraging me to go and be a witness. 

Pop star Paula Abdul, BMG Record Executive Simon Cowell and former music company executive and industry expert Randv Jackson, the show's three· judges, were also impressed during her tryout, Tern said. 
"My voice was almost gone. I just prayed and got my song out," Tern recalled. "Randy and Paula were sitting there looking at me with these big similes on their faces. They both threw their hands up in the air when I was finished." 
Cowell, notorious for the bluntness of his criticism dur­ing the first season, had his arms crossed throughout the audition, Tern said. When she was finished. Tern said he said, "Fabulous," but warned the Saint Mary's student that her voice had a 1940s sound and her image "sucked." 
Since October, Tern has been working on improving her image, shopping for a new style. Iler love of God, howev­er, is unchanging, she said. 
"My faith in myself is zero, but my faith in God is 100," Tern said. 
She described her feelings about the competition in Los Angeles as a mixture of happi­ness and nervousness. Tern isn't overly concerned about Lhe selection process, however, because she knows the out­come will be part of God's plan, she said. 
Tern attributes her success to God and to the support of her family and the Notre Dame/ Saint Mary's communities. 
It was Tern's mom who first suggested she try out for the show, and her mother and grandmother are more excited about the process than she is. she said. 
Tern said that her professors have been very understanding 
and that she thrives on the Christian atmosphere that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's offer. 
"I love being surrounded by Christians," she said. "It makes it easier for me to pray." 
If Tern is selected among the top 32, she will return to California and advance to the next level. She plans to put school on hold if this happens. If she doesn't make the cut, it's not the end of the world either. she said. 
"It's just like last time, I'm going on faith," Tern said. 
The two-part season pre­miere of "American Idol", based on the hit British T.V. series "Pop Idol" will air on J-iox on Jan. 21 and 22. The show's winner will receive a record contract that could, according to Fox, be worth millions of dollars.

TCE

fessor applies for renewal, pro­motion or tenure, while other departments use them to evalu­ate the professor's ability. 
A professor can use the TCE results to improve teaching styles and evaluate their course material. Spanish professor Kristine Ibsen said TCE's were useful because they allow every student to provide feedback. 
When asked how TCE's were beneficial, political science pro­fessor Barbara Connolly said, "It depends how much time students take but when they give specific suggestions then they are helpful." 
In spring 2002, the enroll­ment in TCE-evaluated sec­tions for the University was 40,988 response rate was 75 percent, according University of Notre Dame Fact Book. The overall response rates for the College of Arts and Architecture, Business College of Engineering and College of Science were 69, 78, 72 and 64 percents respectively. 


Some students wonder how effective the TCEs are. 
"I think thev are worthless," junior Danielle Davis said. "Everyone rushes through them and everyone wants to get out of class. I think maybe two peo­ple out of every class take them seriously." 
Student Senate's Academic Affairs committee submitted a letter to Facultv Senate earlier in the semester suggesting improvements for TCEs. Trip Foley, student body vice presi­dent, said making the TCE scantron results available to the public on a database would benefit students when register­ing for classes. · 
"Currently, there is some misinformation about profes­sors out there and the current systems -word of mouth and 


ticketmaster outlets ticketmaster.com or 574-272-7979 
NDToday -are incomplete," said Foley. J-ioley said a databasfl would~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
reflect the varied views of stu-­
dents and not just the positive or negative opinions that seem to be posted on NDToday, an independent student-run Web site. 
Foley said Harvard, Northwestern and Stanford make their equivalent to TCEs public, and the trend in higher education seems to be moving to making information avail­able to help people. 
When Faculty Senate meets in January, Foley said the Student Senate will push to have the TCE issue on their agenda.

U.S. takeover of U.N. arms declaration angers Iraq 
Associated Prcss 
BAGHDAD 

The Iraqi government accused Washington on Tuesday of taking control of a 
U.N. master copy of Baghdad's arms decla~ation in order to tamper with il and create a pretext for war. 
In the United Slates, special­ists at the CIA and other U.S. agencies began pouring over the 12,000-page declaration, in which Baghdad is supposed to "tell a.II" about its chemical. biological and nuclear pro­grams. American officials said much or the material appeared to be recycled ver­sions of earlier documents. 
U.N. inspectors have said Iraq's earlier declarations w1irc incomplete. The United Nations was beginning its own analysis of the mammoth dec­laration. a process officials say could take weeks. 
Inspectors stepped up their search Tuesday, fanning across Iraq on surprise mis­sions to 13 sites -the largest number of inspections since the U.N. operation resumed two weeks ago. One team moved in on a uranium min­ing site 250 miles west of Baghdad. 
President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, spoke of war and sacrilice in a meeting with top lieutenants, men U.S. strate­gists hope will abandon the Iraqi strongman in the event of war. If war comes, Saddam told them, "your heads will remain high with honor. God willing." 
The U.S.-lraqi tensions flared again in the southern "no-fly zone" Tuesday, when the U.S. command said its warplanes bombed an Iraqi anti-aircraft missile site 165 miles southeast of Baghdad. Just across Iraq's southeast­ern border in Kuwait, U.S. Army units were conducting desert exercises. 
Iraq insists it no longer has weapons of mass destruction or programs to make them. The Bush administration says it's sure Baghdad does and has threatened war if. in the 
U.S. view. Saddam's govern­ment doesn't comply with U.N. disarmament demands. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell denounced Saddam's claims, saying, "He's a liar." 
"We'll see now whether he decides that the cost of lying is too great. The cost of lying now might result in his regime being destroyed by the armed forces of the international community," he said during a Dec. 5 interview with the French television station France 2. The State

Federal court opposes ruling against death penalty 
As-Iodated Pres 
NEW YORK 
A federal appeals court upheld the federal death penalty Tuesday, firmly rejecting a lower court's conclusion that it was unconstitutional and declar­ing that only the Supreme Court can change "well-settled" law. 
The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached deep into history to show that Judge Jed Rakoff found no new legal territory when he ruled the death penalty amounted to the "state-sponsored mur­der of innocent human beings" because so many death row inmates are later exonerated.

Venezuelan Court protests pressure: 
Nearly hair the judges on Venezuela's Supreme Court suspended work Tuesday to protest what they called political harassment from the government during a violent opposition general strike against President llugo Chavez.

The protest ­which would disrupt most court work -came after the pro-Chavez Congress fired court vice president Franklin Arricchi, saying he wasn't qualified.

drug-murder conspiracy. 

The appeals court noted that European nations from which the United States derived its laws recog­nized in the 1700s that capital punish­ment carries the risk that innocent peo­ple will be executed, which abolitionists have argued since the 1800s was area­son to shelve the death penalty. 
Since then. the appeals court said, the Supreme Court has recognized that risk but repeatedly left the death penalty intact "because our judicial system -indeed, any judicial system -is fallible." 
In its 35-page ruling, the appeals panel in New York said there was "no fundamental right to a continued opportunity for exoneration throughout the course of one's natural life." 
Defense lawyer Kevin McN ally promised to appeal. 
"All the court said is that this is an old debate and while there is new evi­dence, the only court that can look at the new evidence is the Supreme Court. which is fine," he said. "If we were going to lose, then this is what you'd want them to say." 
Prosecutors had no comment on the ruling, said Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney James Corney. 
The ruling does not apply to state death penalty laws. Thirty-eight states allow capital punishment, although some have not executed anyone for many years. The governors of Illinois and Maryland have placed moratori­ums on executions in their states. 
In his ruling, Rakoff had said he based his findings on studies of state death penalty cases, because the num­ber of federal death sentences -31 ­was too small to draw any conclusions. 
Only two people, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and drug killer Juan Garza, have been executed under the federal law, enacted in 1994. Of the remaining 29, five were reversed. The government said none of the 31 defendants was later found to be innocent. 
Rakoffs ruling came during the pre­trial phase of the case of Alan Quinones and Diego Rodriguez, alleged partners in a heroin ring. They are accused of torturing and killing informant Edwin Santiago in 1999 and have pleaded innocent.

Ship with N. Korean missiles stopped: 
A ship carrying a dozen Scud-type missiles from North Korea was intercepted in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, U.S. officials said. They said the mis­siles were believed to be headed for Yemen. The ship was stopped and boarded about 600 miles east of the Horn of Africa, the officials said. U.S. intelligence had been trncking the vessel closely, said U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Lax government oversight and shoddy maintenance practices by Alaska Airlines led to the crash of an airliner off the California coast that killed all 88 people aboard, federal investigators ruled Tuesday. The National Transportation Safety Board said insufficient lubrication led to excessive wear and the eventual failure of the jet's jackscrew, a tail component that helps move the plane's stabilizer.

Former President Jimmy Carter accepts Nobel Prize 
Associa.ted Press 
OSLO 

Former President Jimmy Carter, in Oslo to colleci his Nobel Peace Prize. said Monday that his support of President Bush is solid, provided he keeps working through the United Nations and weapons inspectors for a solution in Iraq. 
The former president will accept his Nobel diploma and modal, and give a traditional lec­ture, at a gala ceremony Tuesday in the Oslo City Hall. The prize also includes a $1 million cash award. 
Carter said at a news confer­ence he supports the stance of President Bush so long as he con­tinues to work for a solution on Iraq through the United Nations. 
The debate over Iraq is even more pertinent because Gunnar Berge, chairman of Peace Prize committee. said that singling out Carter for the honor should be considered a "kick in the log'' to Bush. 
Carter is being honored "for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to internation­al conflicts, to advance democra­cy and human rights, and to pro­mote economic and social devel­opment." 
Carter, a Democrat who said he gets along well with the Republican president, urged Bush to support the efforts of international inspectors now searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He also urged Iraq to comply with U.N. demands. 
"If Iraq does comply completely with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council ... I sec no need for a conflict," Carter

WorldCom CEO payment criticized 
A federal judge on Tuesday criticized WorldCom lnc.'s proposed compensation plan for incoming CEO Michael Capellas, warning that he could still hand down a multibillion dollar fine if the company doesn't show it is truly "committed to reform." 
Manhattan federal court Judge Jed Rakoff issued a four-page memorandum order call­ing on representatives of the company to come to his court on Dec. 16 to discuss the compensation package. 
A WorldCom filing in bankruptcy court said Capellas would be paid a signing bonus of $2 million, an annual salary of $1.5 million and a $1.5 million bonus guaranteed in 2003.

United holds prepartatory talks 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

A day into its bankruptcy reorga­nization, United Airlines held preparatory talks with its unions Tuesday on concessions while its CEO began a tour of United's U.S. hubs as part of a campaign to reas­sure passengers and employees. 
The world's No. 2 airline stressed that it was business as usual for its daily flight operations in the wake of the largest bankruptcy filing in aviation history. 
But its financial emergency, including daily losses as high as $22 million, continues despite the protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. United moved quickly to start addressing top priorities in bankruptcy: customers and cost cuts. 
A team of United executives met with financial advisers for its unions in Boston. Company repre­sentatives said the meetings were intended to set the stage for broad­er talks with unions in the coming days about management's plans in bankruptcy. Union officials did not immediately comment. 
United needs to make steep labor and other cutbacks soon to emerge healthy from bankruptcy sometime in 2004 as planned and to keep its $1.5 billion interim financing intact by meeting creditors' periodic benchmarks. But it also needs employees· support for the reduc­tions. since labor turmoil could fatally damage its plans. 
"We're trying to continue the con­sensual and collaborative approach that has been displayed over the last several months," United spokesman Joe Hopkins said of the preparatory talks. 
Meanwhile, chief executive Glenn Tilton headed west on a tour of United's network at the same time as the airline ran full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers, urging pas­sengers not to give up on United.

Over 12.5 million watch 'The Sopranos' season finale show-

The season finale of "The Sopranos" was the second most-watched episode of HBO's mob drama, with 
12.5 million viewers tuning in as Carmela and Tony Soprano split.

As last year. the finale proved a runner-up in rat­ings to the season premiere: "The Sopranos" drew its biggest-ever audience, 13.4 million, when it returned Sept. 15 for the fourth sea­son. 
Overall, the series was up 22 percent in viewership unhappy. 
T h e episode, which included high-volume blasts of Dean Martin's crooning used as a weapon, ended to the bit­tersweet strains of "I Have Dreamed," the Richard Rodgers' tune. 
Series creator David Chase has said he intends to do just one more season of "The Sopranos," but noted that HBO holds the series' rights. HBO's Baldwin had no comment on its future. 


Complexity stalls CNN-ABC deal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
The complexity of merging two news operations has stalled any CNN/ABC deal. AOL Time Warner Inc. chief execu­tive Richard Parsons said Tuesday. 
Parsons, in a speech before the annual UBS Warburg Media Week conference, said such a merger would make good business sense because it would allow ABC to benefit from CNN's international reporting expertise, while CNN could expand its audience via ABC's stations and generally broad reach. CNN is owned by AOL Time Warner; ABC is owned by Disney. 
But figuring out the logistics has been challenging. 
"We've hit a pause ... because it's very, very com­plex," Parsons said, adding that both news organizations would want to maintain full control of what appears on their airwaves. 
ABC and CNN have been in discussions for months now about a possible merger. Last week, The Atlanta Journal­Constitution quoted CNN chair­man Walter Isaacson as saying he and ABC News President David Westin had already worked out how to run their operations if they are merged. Isaacson said the deal had been delayed as AOL Time Warner takes care of other issues. 
Indeed. Parsons indicated that the media conglomerate's plate remains quite full, as it sorts out problems at its America Online unit ranging from questions about the via bility of its business to govern­ment investigations into its accounting practices. 
But Parsons reiterated that the company is committed to restoring investor confidence and improving the health of its balance sheet. 
He said the company is look­ing into the possible sale of some assets as a way to simpli­fy and focus the business, although no final decisions have been reached. 
"We have looked at some assets like our sports teams" and assets that don't con­tribute to earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization, because they are owned jointly, he said. But "we haven't come to any kind of formalized decision." 
There are also no plans for what he called "transforming deals" saying the company will instead work to extract value out of its current holdings, including the America Online division.

Celebrities -write letter urging President to avoid w-ar 
AsrndateJ I' rcss 
LOS ANGELES 

Cclobritios mobilized against a possible war in Iraq on Tuesday, gathering to pub­lici..:e a letter urging President Bush to avoid military action. 
More than 100 entertainers signed the missive, which says a war with Iraq will "increase the likelihood or terrorist attacks, damage the economy and undermine our moral standing in the world." 
"This notion or pre-emptive war ls setting a precedent ... and we must ask ourselves, 
where does this end'?" said Tony Shalhoub, star of the ABC detective show "Monk." "Where is the next pre-emp­tive strike?" 
Shalhoub, Martin Sheen and Mike Farrell were among nearly a dozen performers who got together to draw attention to their cause. 
Farrell, who's co-starred in the television series "M-A-S­H" and "Providence," said llollywood was speaking out to show average citizens that it's OK to voice dissent. He also said he did not believe that Bush has proven Iraq is a danger to America. 
"It is inappropriate for the administration to trump up a case in which we are bally­hooed into war," Farrell said. 
Among those signing the let­ter were Academy Award win­ners Kim Basinger, Helen llunL, Olympia Dukakis, Susan Sarn.ndon and director Jonathan Demme. 
Other names included for­mer "X-Filcs" stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny; "The West Wing" cast members Sheen, Janel Moloney, Bradley Whitford and Lily Tomlin; "CS!: Crime Scene lnvestigation"actors Marg Hclgenberger and 
Hobert David Hall; and "Ocean's Eleven" 
co-stars Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner. 
R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, Peter Buck and Mike Mills joined fellow musicians Peter Yarrow and Bonnie Raitt. 
Bush has threatened mili­tary force against Saddam, saying the dictator has amassed weapons of mass destruction that pose a dan­ger to the United States. U.N. weapons inspectors are searching the Middle Eastern country for such devices but have turned up little so far. 
Sheen. who plays thp, presi­dent on "The West Wing." said he believed Bush was eager lo go to war with Iraq because he wanted Lo settle a personal score with Saddam lfussein. 
When Bush's father was president, he ended Saddam's invasion of Kuwait but did not eliminate him in the Gulf War. 
"I think he'd like to hand his father Saddam Hussein's head and win his approval for what happened after the Gulf War. That's my own personal opin­ion -I don't know if that's true. I hope it's not, but I sus­pect it is," Sheen said. 


Houston back in the spotlight, faces big career test 
NEW YORK 

Whitney Houston, who released her first album in four years this week, has suc­ceeded in getting the public's attention -but not for her music. 
Instead, the buzz is about llouston's admissions of drug use, her erratic behavior and her frail appearance. 
"f think Whitney's lost it a lit­tle bit," says Delia Pena, of Bayonne, N.J., one of thou­sands of fans who waited out­side Lincoln Centcu on Sunday to see the Grammy-winning star in a mini-concert that aired on Good Morning America on Tuesday. 
"I like her music. I hope she's doing better." 
"Just Whitney" comes a little more than a year after Houston, now 39, signed a reported $100 million contract to stay at Arista Records. When she was 22, she released her self-titled debut album, which has sold more than 13 million copies in the United States; she went on to have hits like "Saving All My Love for You," "The Greatest Love of All" and "I Will Always Love You," and starred in movies

such as "The Bodyguard" and "Waiting to Exhale." 
Those glory days, however, seem far away. Over the past few years, the singer has been dogged by controversy, from her tumultuous 10-year mar­riaga to bad boy singer Bobby Brown to her missed concert appearances. 
She looked so emaciated at a concert for Michael Jackson last year that there were rumors she was dying. And in 2000, Houston was charged with marijuana possession 
when an airport security guard found the drug in her purse; the misdemeanor count was dismissed when a counselor said llouston did not need treatment for drug abuse. 
Brown has a history of drug and alcohol arrests, including an arrest last month in Atlanta on drug and traffic charges. 
After years denying drug use, Houston conf1rmed in an inter­view last week with Diane Sawyer on ABC's "Primetime Live" that she had used cocaine, marijuana and pills.

sors for a job well done. 

Students, however, are not entirely to blame. They can­not be expected to take TCEs seriously when they do not see significant benefits to completing them. 
Students are in the best position to judge the fairness of exams, the professor's ability to communicate with their class, the usefulness of texts and the overall quality of the professor and class. 
But it is evident that the TCEs are not used appropriate­ly. The evaluations may not be perfect, but their imperfec­tions fail to rationalize the University's refusal to release the results. 
Students should be allowed access to the statistics com-
TCEs could be much more valuable tools. If the University made the information they received public, students would be better informed when selecting classes. Students could seek out popular courses and professors and avoid those rated poorly by their peers. 
Once the University begins to make students' opinions avaiable to other students, it will generate more thoughtful and honest responses. Once it shares information about the merits and downfalls of certain classes and professors, it will prompt students to give careful evaluations that will aid their peers in choosing courses. And once it makes TCE results public, it will improve the quality of a Notre Dame education for all. 
Can you ever really be 'just friends?' 
After a breakup, once the relation­ship has officially ended, when the tears are dried and the issue discussed to an eye-rolling death, can we ever maintain a normal relationship with the person we've shared much more than chemistry notes with? 
This really is the eternal question, one that has never had a simple black and white answer. It's not as if we can click our heels together three times and make the transition from dating to friends in a few short minutes. It's often as complicated and circumstantial a situation as the break up itself and involves a great deal of communication and effort by both parties to even attempt to make it work. However, sometimes, even if the effort is made, it's not always an easy trip down the yellow brick road to friendship. 
Attempting a friendship after dating can be as different a transition as black-and-white Kansas was to Technicolor Oz. And depending on the circumstances of the actual dissolution of the relationship, whether it be a complete annihilation of romantic asso­ciation or a resigned parting of ways, the first meeting post-breakup is always unavoidably awkward. 
Of course, the easiest path to take in this initial ex-change is complete and utter denial of the situation. This usu­ally involves avoidance of eye contact, recognition and in general, our ex's entire existence. For some people this can go on forever, to the point where. as far as we're concerned, they fall off the face of the earth (or at least are permanently deleted from our cell phone books). However, as most rela­tionships end with the classic, "Let's be friends" approach, it's not so easy to just call it a day and move on. Rather, we are brought into a strange, complex arrangement known as post-dating friendship. 

The initial problem with post-dating friendship is where we draw the line. When is it OK to call? If we've gone to lunch every Tuesday and Thursday with our ex, are we still obligated to go and make small talk over pasta and a panini? Or, is it better to make a clean break and only give our exes a tight, contrived smile when we run into them in between classes, rather than wading through the murky waters of post-dat­ing friendship? 
Being friends after a breakup involves a great deal of mutual commu­nication and understanding and requires honesty and candor from one ex to another. There's also a difference between being friends and being on good terms. Simply tolerating our ex and not wishing that a house falls directly on top of them doesn't exactly make for friendship, although it can be a start. 
Often one person is faking the initial friendship in hopes of getting his or her ex back, while that same ex is faking friendship to simply make nice and avoid the tension and unease that accompanies a breakup. This isn't friendship, it's fake-ship and this type of relationship is more doomed than the Wicked Witch of the East. 
Unfortunately, being friends with an ex can hurt, especially when one per­son moves on and begins a relationship with someone else. Sometimes we feel like we're more likely to go over the rainbow than get over an ex. We think, "If only they had a brain," or "If only we didn't have the heart." Of course, letting go can be the best relief. It frees that same heart for much more satisfy­ing pursuits than an ex. 
If there was no initial friendship pre­dating, it's a little easier. We don't know what it's like to have our ex as a buddy and there's no comparison to pre-1'elationship behavior. However, if we were friends first, things can be tricky, as that friendship usually involves mutual friends made along the way. Sharing the same circle of friends means that sooner or later we're forced to hang out with our ex, which can certainly be a lesson in grace. However, it's important not to let our social circle run circles around our relationships, even when our own world feels like it's caught up in a cyclone. 
Our exes are people who we've shared meals, conversations and an amazing amount offree time with. Getting over them isn't always easy and feelings aren't as easily changed as accepting to the terms that the "Let's be friends" agreement sets for us. 
Maybe we can never really just "be friends," although it is possible to maintain a good terms relationship with an ex, if we really make an effort and are honest with them. Things are never going to be the same as they were when we were dating that person and the definition of normal often takes on a different meaning in a post-dating friendship. However, we may not be in Kansas anymore post-dating, but Oz isn't so bad -and the shoes are fabu­lous.

Makes a great gift? 
'Tis the season once again: time for annoying holiday commercials! 
I won't use this space to protost the over­commercialism of"Xmas" -not "Christ," just "X." Though "X" knows I could; depart­

there, either) by Nov. 15 at the latac;t. 
But at tl1e same time, I realize that busi­nesses and retailers depend on holiday spending dollars and a.c; such have a right to purchasr. advertising time for that pur­pose. Heally, only two kinds of holiday com­mercials grate on my nerves any more than that God-awful "Feliz Navidad" song. 
The first group is car companies. Buy a ~ar for Chri,;tmas? Yeah. right, whatever. And it's always a luxury car company, like Ja1,ruar. Even if I could buy a Jaguar as a gift, I'd get two Chcvys instead, one being for me. Rip,ht now, I drive a 1990 Honda Accord with no right turn signal, shoddy brakes and an exhaust system that would make Al Gore froth at the mouth. I couldn't afford a Jaguar hood ornament to put on my Christmas tree (I'm too poor for a tree). The only way I'd get $60,000 for a Jag is to sell two or three internal organs, or get my own reality show. "X" only knows which would be more invasive. 
But the real fly in my eggnog is all the commercials that get slapped with the slo­gan "Makes a great gift!" They're all for worthless junk. Things that actually are great gifts don't need such a ridiculous tagline, but the overpriced doohickeys nobody would be caught dead buying for themselves always have "Makes a great gift!" at the end of their commercials. 
I honestly don't know who would be dumb enough to fall for this. Have you ever been watching TV, seen a commercial for a Garden Weasel, ignored it at first, but then heard "Makes a great gift!" and I.bought. "Wow, you know, that would make a great gift for my roommatf.VSYR date/grandma!"? But somebody buys them or else the corporations that made them would be out of business. 

On second thought, the fact that nobody buys them is probably why the commercials are still on. Somewhere there's a warehouse with six million of those hamsters that sing "Kung Fu Fighting," and they advertise just so people will take the damn things off their hands. 
Luckily, I've never been the recipient of a gift so inane. Mostly this is because people who know me realize that if they get me a Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia, I'll ch-ch-ch-choke them. Call me a Grinch all vou want, but if some­one even tries to get.me the Clapper, I'll grab the first secular holiday decoration I can find and cram it into their nearest con­venient orifice. 
I don't include infomercial prod­
ucts because some of them actu­ally have practical uses and also require spending at 
least more than the sum total of pocket change in the fountains at the mall. I got a George 
Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Burning Grilling Machine last year. It 
cost $40 or $50, and I use it fairly often. But if you buy me a Flowbee, I don't care how easy the pay­
ments are -Frosty is going somewhere where he'll melt real 

quick. Get me some­thing good or Rudolph's 
next, and those antlers will sting a little. I'm being facetious here, 
of course; despite my lack of chintzy novelty gifts, I've been hit 
with some real goober presents. And I've smiled, suppressed the urge to blud­geon the giver to death with a plastic Santa and worked up the most honest-looking expression of surprised gratitude I could muster. 
Once, some members ofmy extended 
family bought me jumbo packs of microwave popcorn and flavored peanuts. I understand that since I don't see them very often, they were probably clueless as to what to get me. But popcorn and peanul'i signal that the only thought they put into those gifts was "Iley. Mike likes food. Let's buy him that. I have a coupon." They knew I was an English major at Notre Dame; they could have walked into Barnes & Noble and bought the first random thing they saw, and I would have at least appreciated the effort. 
Ifyou've suffered from meaningless trash gifts, might I suggest this gem of wisdom from a song called "Stop Giving Me Crap For Christmas" by comedian Bobby Gaylor: "They say it's the thought that counlc;. So instead of making me cringe every year with what you bought, let's call it even for­ever and stop at tile thought." If you don't know what to get me, a simple heartfelt card will do with possibly a gift certificate from Borders or McdiaPlay inside. 
A Jaguar would be nice. though. Just no more popcorn. for the love of "X."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
GOP gains do not suggest 
dissatifaction with Democrats 
Michael Derocher's Dec. 3 letter, "Democrats act like sore losers," is filled with so many errors that it will be impossible to stick to The Observer's 350-word limit for let­
ters. 
First of all, the media is not liberally biased as Derocher states. He is correct in his com­ment that "[p)olls reveal that 89 percent of Lhe media voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, and upwards of 93 percent voted for him in 1996, Need Isay mo,·e?" 
Yes, you need to say more Mike. For starters, how docs this translate to a liberal bias? Just because someone has a more liber­al stance on the issues, as most journalists do, does not mean their coverage will reflect this. In 2000, nore negative publicity was given to Al Gore han to George W. Bush. Also, news­paper e·1dorsements have almost always gone disprop >rtionally to the Republicans. The truth is Lhat the media will print whoever has the jui1 :er stories. If a candidate is scandalous (Clin'.on) or docs something dumb (can't spell potatoe), it will get headlines. 
The funniest part about Derocher's article was how he pushed his conservative senli­mcnls -by using quotes from Tom Daschle and Gore about how terrible the llepublicans are. BuL all candidates bash each other, not just Democrats. This is how our political sys­tem works. Mrs. Soandso says something bad about Mr. WhaL'ihisface in order to sway the public. Negative press has a greater impact on the populace than anything positive. A candidate can volunteer for the homeless every day, donate money to various founda­tions and adopt 15 whales and it still wouldn't have as great of an effect on people as he or she smoking up in the girls or boys room in 
high school. It's absurd, but that's how it works. And why are we using Alec Baldwin as the poster child for the Democratic party? 
A couple more points I would like to make: Election of more Republicans does not neces­sarily translate to action. Republicans gaining a few seats in the House or the Senate will not pass bills that would have otherwise been rejected in a bipartisan Congress. If a repre­sentative wants to keep his or herjob, his or her voting had better reflect the constituency. 
When the country is in an economic rut, people are looking for a change. This means out with the old and in with the new. The rea­son more Republicans were elected is because they are more likely to support a war effort. And one of the reasons Bush is con­stantly looking for a reason to go to war is because he knows it will help pull us out of a hole. The loss of Democratic seats has nothing to do with "the state oflcadership (or lack thereof) currently within the party." Good Lord, use your brain. 
And finally, in response to Derocher's "Why is Rush Umbaugh so popular with 20 million listeners daily," in addition to his incredible talent "on loan from God" (his words), it is because radio is the one news outlet that lib­erals have not conquered? By God, you're right. I don't know how many times I've picked tip a paper and read "The Indianapolis Colts lost to the Tennessee (abortion is good!) Titans this weekend 27 to (gun control, gun control!) 17? Those liberal newspapers ... ha!

Supporting 
affirinative action 


implies racism 
Like many of you, I've been keeping up with the debate that has been going on in The Observer for the past several days about race and dis­crimination. There have been suggestions for a redefinition of the term "racism" and a wave of indignant dictionary-waving responses. Most of the articles have been highly opinionated, and expend large amounts of energy trying to sound authoritative, so I think I'll break the trend. 
I am not at all sure about the proper way to think about racism and I have no authority to lay down the law regarding such a complex and sensitive issue, but what I do have are questions that no article has yet answered for me. For instance, what is the ultimate goal in striving for a new definition of the term "racism" if we still acknowledge, as Tona Boyd and Shamus Rohn do, that "all racial discrimination is wrong?" I would be interested to know the views of both authors regarding affir­mative action, because if discrimination based on race is wrong under all circumstances, then doesn't it follow that all forms of' af'lirmative action are wrong? 
It seems to me that if someone supports af'lirmative action, he or she must believe that discrimination based on race is in fact permissible under certain circumstances, but Boyd and Hohn apparently do not believe this. If "racism" were redefined to account for social factors, it would become impossible to label admissions committees who use race as a factor for discriminating between college applicants as "racist" groups, but it would not stop anyone from labeling their actions as wrong. 
If we all agree, as surprisingly it seems we all do, that racial discrim­ination is always wrong, then would it really make a difference if peo­ple were forced to stop applying the word "racist" to affirmative action programs and other institutions and individuals who discriminate based on race, and substitute "racially discriminatory" in its place? This debate would seem a waste of paper if it ultimately boils down to the substitution of a two-word label for a one-word label. Of course, I would be happy to hear any suggestions from anyone who can clarify this matter for me.

Some rock fans are offended not only by the hype surrounding the garage­rock revival, but by the insinuation that rock could be or needed to be revived at all. But as popular music styles have diversified and sometimes disintegrat­ed in the '80s and '90s, rock and roll has lost its power and drive. Perhaps for loyal fans of old rock movements the groups are merely an imitation of their predecessors. But for many listen­ers, new or old, garage rock is a breath of fresh air. The sounds may be classic, but certainly not stagnant, and howev­er far back they go are still far ahead of some of today's ranker music trends. A period of Lifehouse, Christina Aguilera and Backstreet Boys could use an infusion of real back-to-basics rock. 
With names and sounds so easily con­fused, are the bands riding to fame on each other's shoulders? Certainly they are more unique than their pop peers, who are more distinctive for what trashy outfits they wore to the last awards show than for the quality of their music.

NHL 





Prusek makes 26 saves as Senators slash Sabres 
Associated pCCS5 
BUFFALO 

Martin Prusek made 26 saves in only his fifth career start. and Marian Hossa scored twice to lead the Ottawa Senators to a 4-2 victory Tuesday night over the Buffalo Sabres. 
Todd White and Brad Smyth also scored for Ottawa, which won for the first time in Buffalo since Dec. 30, 1998 and snapped an eight-game winless streak (0-7-1) at HSBC Arena. 
Prusek is 4-0 this season as a backup for the Senators, who are 10-1-3 since Nov. 12. Hossa, with 18 goals, tied Minnesota's Marian Gaborik for the league lead. 
Henrik Tallinder and Ales Kotalik scored for Buffalo, whose season-best three-game winning streak was halted. 
Martin Biron made 26 stops for the Sabres. 
White put Ottawa ahead 9:02 into the game with his seventh goal. He was parked in the slot and converted a feed from Martin Havlat. 
Tallinder scored the first goal of his NHL career on the power play to tie the game with 5:26 remaining in the period. He pinched into the slot and one-timed a pass from Curtis Brown. 
Smyth regained the lead for Ottawa on the power play four minutes later, deflecting a slap shot by Anton Volchenkov. 
Hossa made it 3-1 with 8:03 left in the second period. He went in alone on Biron after Tallinder mishandled the puck near the Buffalo blue line. 
With 7:59 to go in the game, Hossa took the puck at his own blue line and slipped it between the legs of Buffalo defenseman Brian Campbell on his way to Biron. Hossa has six goals in the last six games. 
Kotalik drew Buffalo within 4-2 with 5:42 to play. He scooped up a loose puck in the high slot and wristed a shot past Prusek. 
Canadlens 4, Bruins 2 
Goalie Jeff Hackett stopped the NHL's top team as the Montreal Canadians beat Boston Tuesday night and ended the Bruins' three-game winning streak. 
The Canadiens took a 4-0 lead on goals by Jan Bulis in the first period and Yanic Perreault, Oleg Petrov and Randy McKay in the second. Boston cut it to 4-2 when Joe Thornton scored his 15th goal at 10:53 of the second and Mike Knuble got his fifth at 19:16. 
Hackett, 3-1 in his last four games, stopped 31 shots, including all 14 he faced in the third period. 
Montreal also knocked off a strong Boston team in last sea­son's playoffs. The Bruins had the best record in the Eastern Conference but lost in the first round to the eighth-seeded Canadiens. 
Tuesday's win was the Canadiens' second straight after a four-game losing streak. They heat Phoenix 4-2 on Saturday. Despite the loss, the Bruins are 8-2 in their last 10 games and have the league's best record. 
John Grahame, who played every game of Boston's three-game winning streak, allowed Bulis' fifth goal just 5:10 into the game. It came on a pass from Andreas Dackell from behind the net. 
Perreault scored his 12th at 
3:06 of the second on an unas­sisted breakaway, and Petrov added his fifth at 6:42 when Grahame dived to the ice too soon, leaving half the net unguarded. 
Montreal made it 4-0 on a power play at 10:18 when McKay scored his fifth, pushing a 10-footer through a crowd and past Grahame. 
Boston's comeback began less than a minute later as Thornton, the NHL's second leading scorer, knocked a pass from Knuble out of the air and bounced it into the net. 
Then it was Knuble's turn as he scored on a deflection of Bryan Berard's shot from 45 feet. 
The loss dropped the Bruins' record against Eastern Conference teams to 14-2-2-0 and ended their five-game win­ning streak against Montreal in Boston, including a 4-2 victory Nov. 29. 

Blackhawks 3, Islanders 2 
Tyler Amason scored the go­ahead goal and also assisted on the tying score in the third period as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the New York Islanders Tuesday night. 
Arnason picked off a pass from Islanders forward Jason Wiemer at the Islanders blue line, moved to the high slot, and heat goalie Chris Osgood with a slap shot. 
Chicago is 11-1-5 in its last 17 meetings with the Islanders. 
The Blackhawks' only loss was the night New York honored former coach Al Arbour on Jan.25.1997. 
Steve Sullivan and Eric Daze also scored for Chicago, which got 29 saves from Jocelyn Thibault. 
Roman Hamrlik and Dave Scatchard scored for New York. Osgood made 31 saves, but it wasn't enough to keep the Islanders from having their three-game winning streak snapped. 
The teams skated to a score­less first period, as the Islanders wasted a two-man advantage that lasted 1:38. Thibault made two of his seven saves of the period during that stretch. Osgood made a nice stick save on Phil Housley in the first minute of the game, and then -along with defenseman Kenny Jonsson ­managed to snuff a breakaway by Theo Fleury at 15:15. 
The Blackhawks took the lead at 7:52 of the middle peri­od when Sullivan, at the top of the crease, managed to tip Daze's centering pass past Osgood. 
Hamrlik tied it off a faceoff at 
12:51. He cut in from the left point, accepted a cross-ice feed from Jason Wiemer in the left circle, and wristed a short side shot past Thibault. 
Scatchard put the Islanders ahead 3:52 into the final peri­od. Wiemer's clear-in took a strange bounce off the back boards. and Scatchard, by the left post, put a backhander in off Thibault's pad. 
Daze made it 2-2 at 7:49 when his slap shot from the top of the left circle trickled past Osgood. 

Devils 2, Blues 0 
Jim McKenzie and Turner Stevenson scored, and Martin Brodeur made 28 saves for his third shutout this season as the New Jersey Devils beat the depleted St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night. 
Brodeur earned his 58th career shutout for the Atlantic Division-leading Devils. who have lost in regulation only once in eight games (5-1-0-2). 
Brodeur preserved the shutout with a great glove save on Barret Jackman with just under nine minutes remaining. He also survived a hard slam when Blues forward Tyson Nash was checked into him by Devils defenseman Colin White. 
The Blues played two men short as they dressed only 18. The team was hit by wide­spread food poisoning which affected Dallas Drake and Scott Mellanby. 
McKenzie scored the only goal of the first period at 
13:14. Brian Gionta set the score in motion when he inter­cepted the puck just inside the St. Louis blue line. Gionta car­ried wide down the right wing deep into the Blues zone. He fed a centering pass back to the slot where McKenzie tipped it in for his first goal of the season. 
Stevenson made it 2-0 at 
10:52 of the second period. Joe Nieuwendyk dug the puck out of the corner and fed it to the slot where Sergei Brylin and Stevenson had cracks at it. Stevenson got the score as he put in his own rebound.

Snow to resign from Augusta 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Treasury Secretary nomi­nee John W. Snow will resign his membership in Augusta National Golf Club, which has been under fire for not allow­ing women to join. 
Snow, chairman of the transportation and railroad conglomerate CSX, was nom­inated Monday by President Bush and must be confirmed by the Senate. 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters Monday morning before Bush's announcement that such a membership would not be a "disqualification" for a nominee. 
Three hours later, Fleischer announced Snow is leaving the club. But, he added: "The president does not judge that to be a dis­qualifying factor." 
White House spokesman Claire Buchan said Snow "is in the process of resigning. It's all part of the process of filling out papers and making courtesy calls." 
Augusta National spokesman Glenn Greenspan said the club would have no comment. 
"Mr. Snow has done exactly what he should do. No one in the public eye ... should be willing to be identified with sex discrimination." said Martha Burk, head of the National Council of Women's Organizations. which has been leading the fight against Augusta National. "I think he's done exactly the right thing." 
She added that Bush should consider potential nominees' club memberships as a fac­tor. 
"They would never put for­ward a candidate of an all­white club and they should never put forward a member of an all-male club," she said. 
Last month, former CBS chief executive Thomas H. Wyman resigned from Augusta National after 25 years, calling the club's stand on female members "pigheaded" and saying up to a quarter of its 300 members feel the same way he does. He was the first member to resign in protest. 
Augusta National officials took Wyman's resignation in stride and said it would not change the club's position that it will decide when to admit women on its own and that there will be none by the Masters in April.

NFL 
Maddox won't be wanning Steelers' bench 

Allsport Photos 

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Tommy Maddox throws a pass past the Texans' Jamie Sharper during the Steelers 24-6 loss on Saturday. 
Associated Press 
PITfSBURGH 
Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher held class Tuesday on the subject of what separates good NFL quarterbacks from mediocre ones and, just as sig­nificantly, those who play from those who sit. 
He can only hope Tommy Maddox was sitting at home on his day off, listening intently and taking notes. Cowher won't bench Maddox despite one of the most peculiar days ever· by an NFL quarterback during the Steelers' baffling 24-6 loss Sunday to Houston. Maddox effectively drove the offense to a 422-yard day, only to hand the Texans' defense three touch­downs with two interceptions and a fumble. 
"It's hard to explain a game like that ... in my 23 years in the league as a player and a coach, I've never experienced a game like that," Cowher said. 
Still, Cowher made iL clear Maddox won't stav on the field Sunday against Carolina (5-8) if he keeps turning the ball over. The Steelers (7-5-1) have eight turnovers in Maddox's last two starts, and are 0-2-1 in his last three starts. 
"How do you explain Tommy running and the ball falls out of his hands ... the ball falling out of Antwaan Randle El's hands?" Cowher said. "It's not a lack of effort, but you can't do it. J'm not going to tolerate a continu­ing of that and they understand that." 
Perhaps that's why Maddox will start Sunday, but hasn't been assured he will finish. Kordell Stewart won his two

NBA 
Police allegedly toasted Iverson felony 
Associated Press 
Pl Ill.ADELPHIA 

;\ former hotel security guard says he overheard a police detec­tive make a toast to Allen lvcrson's "next felony" last sum­mer. days before the NBA star was charged with threatening two men with a gun. 
Wesley Gregg told Iverson's lawyers ho was working a lato­evening shift at a Philadelphia hotel July 8 when he spotted the hmd detective in the invesliga.tion dining with other ollicers at the hotel's bar and heard him boast "he is going down" when a news story about the 76ers player appeared on TV. 
When the detectives got up to leave, Lt. Michael Chitwood made a toast: "This is for lverson's next felony," Gregg said in a signed statement he gave lverson's attorneys on July 24. 
The lawyers never used the statement in court. Prosecutors dropped all charges against Iverson after the 
two  men  he  was  accused of  
threatening said  they  were  
unwilling to testify.  

But the tale was passed along to Iverson. and his attorneys said Tuesday it formed the basis for comments the star made about Philadelphia police last month. 
"I've heard about police offi­cers toasting to Allen Iverson 's next felony conviction," Iverson said during an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Daily News. 'Tm hearing about them saying I'm involved with one thing or another, and it scares me. I know that if there's a crooked cop out there. they could do anything to me. He could do anything. Allen Iverson could wind up dead tomorrow if a crooked cop wants him dead." 
After the interview. police commanders said such behavior by officers would not be 
Chitwood, a decorated officer well known in the city for his involvement jn high-profile cases, did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday. 
He told the Daily News he was at a steak house in the Sheraton on the night in question, but denied making a toast involving Iverson. 
"It's positively, undeniably false," he said. Attempts to locate Gregg,

said they would boycott a 76ers law enforcement appreciation night unless Iverson apologized. 
Later, Iverson said he had intended to direct his criticisms at "just a very few individuals" on the force. 
One of his attorneys, Larry Woodward. said Tuesday the guard's signed statement proves that "Allen didn't just go out and make this thing up." 
"There was skepticism, or peo­ple were wondering where all that came from. Well, now they know," he said. He declined to provide Gregg's statement to The Associated Press. but a copy was printed in Tuesday's editions of the Daily News.

unavailable after the 76ers' practice Tuesday. 
Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson defended the depart­ment's handling of the case and said any suggestion that officers may have been overzealous is false. 
"As far as I am concerned, it is over. lam not going to do anoth­er investigation on Chitwood or anyone," he said. 
"Hypothetically, even if true, it didn't involve any sort of viola­tion of the law, or police rules or procedure," Johnson said. "He is off duty. He has First Amendment rights, just like any­one else has."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Franck joins 15 hall of fame inductees 
Assodated Pius  
NEWYORK 

George "Sonny" Franck never thought he'd live to see this day. 
The former All-America tail­back at Minnesota from 1938-40 didn't know whether he would ever make the College Football Hall of Fame -despite his accomplishments with the Golden Gophers. 
"I thought maybe I'd die first," 
Franck said. He was wrong. The 84-year-old Franck is one 
of 15 former greats set to be inducted into the Hall of Fame on Tuesday night. The other players are Auburn split end Terry Beasley, Princeton running back Cosmo Iacavazzi. Arizona State receiver John Jefferson, Southern California safety Ronnie Lott. Pittsburgh quarter­back Dan Marino, Navy tailback Napoleon McCallum, Michigan offensive guard Reggie McKenzie, Georgia Tech defen­sive back Randy Rhino, Texas offensive tackle Jerry Sisemore, Kansas State linebacker Gary Spani, Tennessee defensive tack­le Reggie White and Missouri tight end Kellen Winslow. 
The coaches to be inducted are Carmen Cozza, who spent 32 seasons at Yale, and Earle Bruce, who coached at Tampa, Iowa State, Ohio State, Northern Iowa and Colorado State. 
"For the class of 2000, thank you very much," said Marino, who made the acceptance speech for the inductees. "This is something we will cherish for the rest of our lives. 
"I had the opportunity to play on great teams for four years for the Pitt Panthers and I could walk from my front door to Pitt Stadium in 10 minutes," Marino said. "To be here with my family and to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, this is just a great honor." 
Franck, the oldest of this year's inductees, also played quarter­back, safety, and was a punt and kickoff returner. In 1940, he fin­ished third in voting for the Heisman Trophy, was an All­American and helped the Golden Gophers win the national cham­pionship with an 8-0 record. 
He played alongside Bruce Smith, another College Hall of Fame member, and the two 
-
combined for more than 60 per­cent of Minnesota's touchdowns. Franck said he never worried about making the Hall of Fame. 
"I thought, if they miss me, they miss me," Franck said. "Maybe I'm too old to worry about those types of things.... Sometimes when you're in your 80s, people forget about you." 
One of the games he remem­bers most vividly was in the sea­son finale against Wisconsin in 1940. He returned an intercep­tion for a touchdown in Minnesota's 22-13 win, which sealed the national champi­onship. 
After college, Franck signed up with the Navy and served time as a World War II captain USMCR/Fighter Pilot. He won nine battle stars and survived his plane being shot down in the South Pacific in 1945. 
He returned to the United ­States after the war and spent a few seasons with the New York Giants. Franck went on to coach high school football and is retired and living in Rock Island, 
Ill. 
"I'm so happy to be here," Franck said. "The guys worked so hard to get me in. They pushed and pushed and pulled the right buttons." 
Another player surprised with his selection was Spani, the first player to be honored from Kansas State. Spani was the school's first consensus All­America in 1977 and is the Wildcats' career leader in tack­les (543) and assists (343), play­ing during a time when Kansas State was not nearly as good as it is now. 
Spani credits Kansas State's turnaround to coach Bill Snyder. He was on the hiring committee when the job came open and knew Snyder was the perfect fit. 
"Kansas State has done a lot in the last 10 years," Spani said. "It's an honor to represent the old-timers. Kansas State strug­gled so much prior to me getting there and after I left. It's a mira­cle what coach Snyder pulled off." 
McCallum is hoping for a mira­cle for Navy. The Midshipmen have struggled recently, going 2­10 this season, and Mccallum said it's been frustrating to see what has happened to the pro­gram. 
"They have a very unique situ­ation, they can be as good as they want to be," said Mccallum. who played from 1981-85 and set 26 school rushing and return records. "I get mad. They have potential. I know it. Because of the standards the administration set for themselves, it's difficult." 
Also honored Tuesday were the National Scholar Athletes, selected from all NCM divisions. The Division I-A winners are offensive tackle Kyle Eaton of Oklahoma State, linebacker Hunter Hillenmeyer of Vanderbilt, linebacker Bradie James of LSU, end Chris Kelsay of Nebraska, quarterback Kliff Kingsbury of Texas Tech and offensive tackle Jon Stinchcomb of Georgia. 

NBA 



Webber trial set after season 
Ass<><;iated Press 
DETROIT 
Sacramento Kings star Chris Webber's federal perjury trial can wait until after the NBA season ends, a federal judge ruled. 
Webber. father M a y c e Webber Jr. and aunt Charlene Johnson a r e charged w i t h obstruction of justice and perjury. They are accused of lying to a federal grand jury about their dealings with ex­University of Michigan basket­ball booster Eddie Martin. 
Martin says he gave $616,000 to Webber and four other Wolverines players while they were amateurs. Martin, who pleaded guilty to illegal gambling, said he gave Webber and his family $280,000. 
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds set the Webber family's trial for July 8. 
Edmunds initially suggested the trial be held in May or June, before agreeing to a request from Webber's lawyer, Steven Fishman, to set it after the NBA playoffs end in June. 
"There is no reason I can think of," said Fishman, to hold the trial in the middle of the season. He said that would be a hardship on the NBA, the Sacramento Kings and their

fans. A federal prosecutor strong­ly objected to the delay. 
"Frankly, it is obscene," Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Convertino said. He said Martin's age of 68 could present a problem and said a delay might indefinitely post­pone the trial. 
Edmunds said the court often agrees to work around the schedule of "seasonal" employees, like Webber. 
'Tm surprised you would use the word obscene," Edmunds replied. "We

U.S. District Judge
Webber the univer­
issue a subpoena ordering the University of Michigan to turn over an edited copy of its report into Martin's associa­tions with its players that it supplied to the NCAA, along with interviews with former Wolverines players. 
The subpoena is being requested by Johnson's attor­ney, Steven Levy. 
Michigan refused to turn over the documents in a Nov. 20 letter to Levy, citing a fed­eral law that bars the disclo­sure of student records. 
The next 
hearing in 
has denied taking all but pocket money from Martin. He told the grand jury in August 2000 that he took money from Martin in high school, but could not remem­ber if he took money in col­lege. 
His father also admitted tak­ing gifts from Martin when he testified before the grand jury. 
Edmunds seemed inclined to

ished its men's basketball program for the NCAA rule violations linked to Martin. It said it would prohibit the team from playing in either the NCAA tournament or the NIT after the upcoming season. 
The team also forfeited 112 regular-season and tourna­ment victories from five sea­sons.

Nakamura meets with Mets' Phillips 
Associate.! Press 
NEW YORK 
Free-agent third baseman Norihiro Nakamura met Tuesday wlth New York Mets general manager Steve Phillips, who is seeking a replacement for Edgardo Alfonzo.. 
"We had a good meeting. We got to know each other," Phillips said after the session at Shea Stadium. 
"I told him we'd be back to him in a couple of days. The player is going back to Japan tomorrow. He's got to assess what he wants to do. He has decisions to make." 
Nakamura hit .294 with 42 homers and 115 RBI last season for Kintetsu of the Pacific League. In Japan, he has been courted by the Buffaloes, Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers. 
Nakamura visited Los Angeles and New York during his trip to the United States. 
He brought along Masami Shigeta, his Japanese agent.

To say DePaul likes to shoot 3-pointers is more than a slight understatement -espe­cially considering that Blue Demon guard Ashley Luke has shot 55 herself, while Notre Dame has only attempted 30 3-pointers as a team.

Luke leads DePaul with a 
41.8 3-point percentage, while teammate Sarah Kustok has drilled 40. 9 percent. 
Sophomore guard Jenni Dant leads the Blue Demons in scoring and minutes played averaging 13.1 points per game and clocking 28 minutes per contest. She was also named to the All-Tournament team when DePaul played in the Rainbow Wahine Classic. 

However, the Irish counter with an array of scorers. Notre Dame has all five starters, including three sophomores averaging double figures in scoring, led by Jacqueline 13atieasl's 17 .5 points per game. The Irish have also shot 50 percent or better from the field in all four games this season. 
"We have great balance,"

Notre Dame is also finishing np a four-game road trip that saw the Irish defeat USC, Valparaiso and Arizona State. The Irish defense completely shut down the high-powered Sun Devil offense Saturday, as Notre Dame held Arizona State to only 16 first half points, en route to an 81-52
