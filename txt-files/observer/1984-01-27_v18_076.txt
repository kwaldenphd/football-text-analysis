ND Food Services earns Ivy Award 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Editor 
It may be fish-on-a-bun day in the dining halls today, but it has been filet mignon day all week in the office of Food Service Director Wil­liam Hickey. 
The coveted Ivy Award, the na­tion's top honor for institutional food, has been given this year to the Notre Dame Food Service for in­novation and quality in dining pleasure. 
"It's the Academy Award for food services," said Liz Adams, award program director for Restaurants and Institutions, the leading magazine in the industry and spon­sor of the award. 
But not just any Academy Award. 
Notre Dame Food Service has taken 
home the award for best picture. 
"I am really proud of it and so is 
my staff," Hickey said yesterday. "T:.e profession has recognized that good things are happening at Notre Dame." 
The magazine receives nomina­tions for the annual award during the summer. and readers select the recipients by mailing in a ballot published in a fall edition. To be placed on the ballot, a food service must be receive at least four nomina­tions from previous winners. Notre Dame's competition was Bowling Green University, Chemical Bank of New York, Continental Illinois Bank of Chicago. and Motorola Food Services ofSchaumburg, Ill. 
Restaurantsand Institutions also 
gives an Ivy Award to the best hotel 
food service and restaurant. 
Hickey said receiving the Ivy Award confrrms that Notre Dame Food Service is fast becoming one of the best in American colleges. Uni­versity oflllinois and Purdue Univer­sity have also won an Ivy in the award's 14-year history. 
But Purdue doesn't even serve carbonated beverages, Hickey said with a laugh yesterday. Coke is a once-a-year treat for the Boiler­makers. 
"We think our institution is just as good as the Ivy League's." said Hick­ey, who ranks Yale and Cornell food services as industry models. "We go through a lot of extra effort. That's the difference; that's why we got the Ivy (over other schools)." 
Cap'n Crunch Week didn't hurt. Although sponsored by the sopho­more class, Hickey and his staff set up many of details for the fall fest, including the logistics for the eating contest. 
Theme Nights at the dining halls and the Taste Of Notre Dame -an outdoor showing off of new food from national distributors -are other examples of Hickey's "extra effort." 
"You can't just put up a Mexican 
poster and serve tacos and call that 
Mexican Night," Hickey said. "We 
go through a lot of hard work to 
create the right ambience." 
In his 18 months as food service 
director, Hickey -who is a leading 
contender for the Silver Spoon 
award given by the International 
Food Manufacturers Association ­
has opened up the dining halls for 
dances. 
He has revamped menu schedules 
and researched new ways ofprepar­
ing food. One example is if you avoid 
quickly heating up a frozen breast of 
chicken, it will be much more ten­
der.

A 'dream comes true' for faculty as Decio Hall nears completion 
By FRANK LIPO 
News Staff 
The Decio Faculty Hall, for more than 20 years a dream for the Col­lege of Arts and Letters, is now nearing completion. Its construc­tion is right on schedule and it will be a "very, very effective offifjk building," said Physical Plant Di~'; tor Don Dedrick. 
The $6.2 million facility is the gift of Arthur ]. Decio, president of Skyline Corporation and a Univer­sity trustee. It was designed by Ellerbe and Ellerbe, and Carl ]. Reinke and Sons is the general con­tractor. Located behind O'Shaughnessy Hall on the Sout­heast Quad, it consists of three four-story sections, encompassing 75,000 square feet. 
According to Dedrick, the north section of the building will be com­pleted first and is scheduled to be furnished Feb. 7 or 8. The south sec­tion will be ready for furnishing March 1, while the central section is to be furnished April 1. While the cold wave affected the rest of us, Dedrick said it had "little effect" on the construction because "95-98 percent of the building was weat­herproof' before the cold struck. The permanent heating units are 
operating in the north and south sec­tions while there is a temporary unit operating in the central section. 
Roger Skurski, associate dean of the College of Arts and Letters, was also enthusiastic about the building. All of the college's faculty, except the Art, Music, and Psychology Departments, which have their own buildings, will occcupy the 250 
offices. Skurski hopes the social space will allow the faculty of the different departments to mix. 
There are also several seminar rooms, a conference room, a com­puter terminal room and lounges, and the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies will be housed in the building. "The space that is there is effectively used," said Skurski. 
All ofthe department chairmen of 
the College of Arts and Letters were 
invited to an official inspection tour 
last Tuesday. Skurski reports a very 
favorable faculty response to the 
tour. 
When the Memorial library was built in 1963, the basement office space was viewed as temporary. Now that permanent offices are a reality, the faculty may fmd many of their special features worth waiting for. 
Both Dedrick and Skurski spoke 
proudly of the many features of the individual offices. Each has a large picture window and a smaller win­dow that can be opened, as well as a controllable heating unit, a large built-in bookcase, carpeting, a corkboard strip and a built-in worktable by the window. A new desk,a filing cabinet and two chairs 
will also be provided. 
For allocation of offices, Skurski 
asked each department chairman 
whether he would prefer the offices 
of his department in one block or 
scattered throughout the building. 
He also asked ifthey preferred a par­
ticular section or floor. After making 
a general chart for office allocation, 
he left the individual office assign­
ments to the department chairper­sons. 
After the central section is completed, Skurski hopes to occupy the building as soon as possible. He said he "won't be able to move everyone simultaneously, but we'd like to move everyone in before graduation." 
What about the vacated basement 
of the library? Dean Skurski said the 
administration is still evaluating this 
space to determine its future use. He/ 
said the library will need some ofthe

car in a University lot over break but was one of the unfortunate few to have his car damaged. 
He contends that the weight of the snow piled on his car by a Uni­versity snowplow caused con­siderable damage, although the car was not actually hit by a plow. The damage amounted to about S 1300, said Rock, and included a dented hood and roof, broken louvers, windshield, and taillights; two blown right tires, and suspension and alignment problems. 
University g.rounds crew official William Thistlethwaite disputes Rock's claim, saying only 10-1 5 per­cent of the snow resulted from plowing. Thistlethwaite said the cor­ner of D-2 where Rock's car was parked normally collects a lot of drifting snow. 
Rock said the g.rounds crew was unable to answer his questions as to the unusual drift pattern of snow in D-2. He claims that at least 70 per­cent of the snow on his car was due to snowplowing. When asked of the possibility of a lawsuit, Rock 
replied, "I probably won't sue. 
Hopefully it won't go that far. 
They've been really good about it." 
Rock has discussed his case with both Campus Security and Univer­sity insurance representatives. He claims Security furnished shovels, but not shovelers, and that he and his friends spent three days digging the car out.

ND/SMC pro-lifers join DC protest march 
By BUD LUEPKE 
News Staff 

Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Pro-Lifers joined an estimated crowd of 70,000 in the nation's capitol Monday to protest the Supreme Court's 1973 decision to legalize abortions. 
The Pro-Life Club ofSaint Mary's and Notre Dame, headed by John May and Dan Harrington, took a busload ofover 50 people to Washington D.C. to participate in the demonstration. Support was not a problem as limited bus space prevented many more students from going. Terry Donovan, a club member who made the trip, said "people were calling from Chicago to go, and John (May) got a lot of requests from other students around campus. There's much more support than people realize." Donovan said studentsfrom Valparaiso University also went on the Notre Da-me trip. 
Support was again evident in Washington D.C. The protesters flooded Constitution Avenue during the march from the Wash­ington Monument to the steps of the Supreme Court. "I've never seen so many people," said Cecilia Smith, another club member. Donovan said that the crowd, which has always been large, was slightly larger this year, and noted that support for the pro-life movement is as strong now as it was 11 years-ago. In Donovan's words, "It was phenomenal."

Political passions past? 
President Reagan is expected to announce his plans for re-election Sunday night. While this is no surprise to anyone, it officially signals the beginning of tht: 1984 presidential race. 
But there will he something missing in this election, something that was also noticeably absent in the 1980 election. It seems as though .there is a definite lack of interest in the issues relevant to the campaigns on the part of voters. Nowhere is this lack of concern mort: evident than in the once exciting and striving political groups on the campuses oftht: nation's universities. 
And Notre Dame could be the definitive campus in this saddening turn ofevents. 
This year's candidates will have to succumb to playing off of each other's faults rather than taking strong sides on controversial issues. This will most like· ly confuse rather than assist the voter in his or her choice since the issues will never honestly he con­fronted until after the first Tuesday in November.

But it wasn't always thiS way. Some may remt:mher hack to 1976 when the no­name challenger, Jimmy Carter. took on the staid somewhat boring incum­bent administration of Gerald Ford. But in this elec­tion the drama of an all-out prt:sidential race was again not completely at its peak.

Nixon and Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., embroiled 
the nation in two of the most exciting and written­
about campaigns in American history. Interest in the issues was rdevant then. They were so relevant, in fact, that both campaigns involved people who were emotionally-driven and often militant in their attempts to get their man in the White House. 
In 1972, American troops were still lighting Com­munists in the jungles ofVietnam, members ofthe Com­mittee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) were being tied to the burglarly and attempted bugging of Democratic national headquarters in the Watergate hotel, and the nation was still recoiling from the tur­bulence ofthe 1960's. 
Emotions ran deep in '72. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D· Mass., visited the campus to rally support for the Democrats, as did Sargeant Shriver. And an English professor named Donald P. Costello (now chairman of the American Studies department) submitted an article anymore." 
Rather, in 191-!4 Costello sees the student as not par­ticularly politically active bt:cause the issues don't directly affect tht:m the way tht:y did in '72. "Troops sit­ting in Lebanon is not any­
thing like the emotional issue of kill or being killed. An awful lot of the passion in that article was caused hy my friends who were over thert: (Vietnam) killing. And if they didn't, they'd go to jail. Be killed, kill, or go to jail." 
As Costello said, "I look furward to the time when I can write a letter of reft:rt:nce for a student and tell the company that the student was an activist, and it will he taken a~ a compliment." 
Perhaps someday soon the pendulum will swing back toward the left a little and campus activism will gain renewed popularity. Hopefully, students will not feel so confined by the scrutiny oftheir peers and by tht: fear of projecting a nt:gative image towards potential employers. "' 
Until then, however, we'll just have to look toward the past for example ratht:r than to the present for ac­tion.

Mexico program offers cultural experience 
ByPATSAIN 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Are you tired of battling snow on your way to the library to study? Does South Bend's dazzling social and cultural life leave you yawning? 
Notre Dame's Mexico Program 
may  be  the  answer  to  your  
problems.  The  program,  offered  
with  the  International  Center  at  

Iberoamericana, has two options, a sophomore year·long program and a junior one·semester program. 
There will be an information meeting for those considering the one·semester option on Mond;ty, January 30, at 6:30p.m., in the coffee house at the Center for Social Con­cerns. 
The program is offered during both the fall and spring semesters, and takes place on the campus ofthe Universidad Iberoamericana, a private university just outside Mexico City. 
Courses are chosen to take ad­vantage of local offerings and staff and to fulfill as many as possible of the requirements ofthe Notre Dame curriculum. 
The normal course load is 15 credits, earned in special courses recommended for Notre Dame stu­dents and in electives available from additional offerings of the Interna­tional Center, and appropriate courses from the curriculum ofUni­versidad Iberoamericana. 
A unique aspect ofthe curriculum at Iberoamericana is the Social Analysis Seminar on the economic, social, and political problems of Mexico. The course is a requirement for the one-semester program and emphasizes personal contact with people living and working in poor areas. 
Students live with families chosen by the International Center, since residential universities are ~re in Mexico. Because they live in the city, students will have frequent contact with local people. 
Mexico City offers rich cultural opportunities. Mexican folklore, dance and music is world-reknown, and the countryside shows the' evidence of former great cultures. Mexico City also has the museums, opera, theater, and libraries of any other nation's capital. 
The cost of the program, includ­
ing transportation to and from 
Mexico City is the same as that paid 
by the average student living on the 
Notre Dame campus. Most financial 
aid scholarships continue as at Notre 
Dame, although students must pay 
for books, snacks, and incidentals. 
Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are eligible for the program, although intermediate­level Spanish is required. All can­didates must have a strong overall average and at least a B in Spanish. 
Interested students should con­tact Dr. Isabel Charles in the Foreign Study Office, or Marcia LeMay, coor­dinator of Latin America Programs. 

Saverline Corporation's Vice President of Marketing, Charles Hutson, contratulates Rob .Guilday and Rich Vanthournout, Notre Dame students who lucked out in the Saverline Win a Trip to Florida contest. Hutson and Saverline Chairman Lany Butler were on campus Monday to announce the winners.

PARIS -The downing ofa French jet in Chad and an attack on a government post have reopened the civil war that has been stalemated since the French intervention last summer. 
France blamed Libya for the loss of the plane· and pilot in Wednes­day's attack. But Libya, which sup­ports the rebels of former Chad President Goukouni Oueddei, said the attack was carried out by Goukouni's forces and warned against any intervention by "foreign parties." 
An armored column from north­ern rebel-held territory crossed into government-held territory Wednes­day, shot down a French Jaguar fighter-jet and its pilot, and hit a Mirage Fl fighter, the French government says. The pilot was the first French fatality since French forces entered on the government side Aug. 9. 
In N'Djamena, Chad's Information Minister Mahamat Soumalia said the attack on the government garrison at Zigueye was carried out by a "large Libyan column." 
The French intervention force, sent to halt a rebel drive, stopped the rebels and an estimated 3,500 Libyans, but never attempted to drive the intruders back into Libya.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. -The car­

'Ibe strip wa-; pulled from its slot on the front page on Dec. S. Manag­ing Editorjoe Weiler said he felt the cartoon "too frequently played to the humor of violence." 
In a December edition, Weiler asked readers whether the comic should return to the News-Sentinel. 
"Let us know in a Far Side-esque 
manner whether you want the car­

The reader who suhmitcd the hest and the most Far Side-like plea by noon Dec. 22 received an original drawing hy Gary Larson, the :33-year old St·attlc artist who draws the comic.

Since the cartoon's disap­pearance, the newspaper reported receiving calls and letters asking that it be restored. 
"That's the only reason I sub­scribed to the paper," one caller complained. 
The last view readers in Fort Wayne got of the cartoon was of a grinning clown sandwiched be­tween two frowning guards.

Cranston tries for third place in iowa primary 

Associated Press 
CARROLL, Iowa -Television lights tlooded the stage of the Holy Spirit School gymnasium and repor­tt-rs crowded the bleachers as for­mer Vice President Walter F. Mondale spoke at the annual dinner ofCarroll County Democrats. 
When Mondak finished, Sen. Alan Cranston rose to spt·ak. 
With a loud clatter, the television crews packed their equipment and the reporters stampeded for a waiting press bus to accompany Mondale to his next stop. 
That kfi tht· Carroll County Democrats and txactly two repor­ters -no tloodlights, no crowded pn·ss section. 
The<:alifornia senator insists such incidents don't diso>Urage him, but they do throw into sharp relief the state of hls campaign for the lkmocratic presidential nomina­tion. 
Front-runner Mondale, with his silver-strt·aked shock of hair, his Secret St·rvice agents and his ever­present press entourage, projects an aura ofsuccess. 
Tht· lanky Cranston, with his jokes about his baldness, his meager retinue and his earnest warnings about the arms race, comes across as a man trying for third place. 
That, in fact, is exactly what he says ht· is doing. Over and over, on his most recent tour of Iowa, he told audienn·s that his objective is to win a "ckar" third in the state's Feb. 20 precinct caucuses and in New llampshirt·'s presidential primary on 
 Ft·h. 2H. 
That, he argues, would put him in a beuer position to overtake the more conservative Glenn in later primaries and then go head-to-head with his fellow liberal Mondale. 
Sergio Bendixen, Cranston's cam­paign manager, concedes "it will be difficult in Iowa ...and even more difficult in New Hampshire" for Cranston to emerge in a "dear fas­hion" as the winner among the second-tier candidates. 
"In spite of the organization, Cranston is still an unknown quan­tity here," says Chuck Gifford, politi­cal director of the United Auto Workers, which supports Mondale. "That is awfully hard to overcome on a personal basis." 
Yet Cranston soldiers on, slogging through his third Iowa winter since announcing in December 1981 that he was considering a race for the White House. 
On a flight from Des Moines to Council Bluffs. he tells a reporter he is not disturbed by the relative lack of press attention. Of the Glrroll County meeting, he says, "I was there for the Iowans." 
He says he chose to pass up Secret Service protection, at least for now, because, "It keeps you from the people," and would interfere with the small, informal meetings he likes to hold. 
Yes, he says later, he will make "major efforts to make significant cuts in aspects ofmilitary spending." 
No, he says, he does not see "evidence of any significant progress in dealing with the underlying problems of the economy." 
Gordon Saari doesn't believe in wasting ex­ercise time. Rather than driving to the suburbsfor a little cross-country skiing, Saari rigged up his bicycle to carry his equipment.

Official leaks confidential data 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -An Interior Department official passed con­fidential data to a coal company lawyer more than a month before the federal agency auctioned more than 1 billion tons of federally owned coal, The Washington Post said in today's editions. 
The Post said Interior official David Russell told the lawyer, Brent Kunz of Cheyenne, Wyo., the mini­mum amount the agency would ac­cept as a bid from his company, Texas Energy Services Inc. of 
report to the Justice Department, 
which concluded in November that 
the case did not warrant criminal 
prosecution, the newspaper said. 
Interior Secretary William P. Clark removed Russell from his job last month as director of the Minerals Management Service. Rus­sell's removal was part of a 
departmental shake-up of former top deputies to ex-Secretary james Watt. 
The Post said Russell is quoted in the report as denying that he passed the information to Kunz and that Russell says he has "no idea" why Kunz claims Russell did so. 
The newspaper report says Rus­sell volunteered the information on a tract sought by Texas Energy and two others, without mentioning that it was confidential, the Post said. The tract in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming was put on the auction block in April 1982. 
Interior Department spokesman Tom DeRocco said he was un­familiar with the agency report. 
Pendley also was removed from his post in last month's shake-up.

Assassins cannot kill memory of Kerr 
Editor's note: This is the second in a two-part series on the assassination ofMalcolm Kerr, pnsident of the American University in Beirut. 
Patrick Gaffney· 
Guest column 
1 

Regardless of the timing for the withdrawal from Lebanon, and the eventual face-saving excuse which will justify it, Beirut is more than a passing headache. For many, it is, has been and hopefully will continue to be a home. 
Malcolm Kerr, a highly respected teacher, scholar and extremely popular administrator belonged to this group. For this reason his . murderers, as time will tell, got the wrong man. 
It was their failure to recognize the depth of his personal devotion and the quality of his proven commitment to the welfare of Lebanon that was their most serious structure mistake. 
The real tribute to Kerr is not simply to abandon what is now clearly an impossible program and a distasteful entanglement but to learn to live in and to deeply appreciate a world of wonderful differences, even if they are far ;tway from headlines. 
Long after Lebanon has been relegated to the journalistic oblivion of Iran, Afghanistan and Chad, the memory of Malcolm Kerr will summon people to seek wisdom. 
Kerr's most widely known book, a veritable best seller of its genre, is entitled The Arab Cold War. It is being used this semester in a course taught in our anthropology depart­ment. 
In the preface ofthat marvelous book, there is a casual, but revealing analogy that includes an explicit local allusion: 
Sincejune, 1967, Arabpolitics have ceased to be fun. In the good old days mosi Arabs refused to take themselves very serious~y, and this made it easier to take a relaxed view ofthefew who possessed intimation ofsome immortal mission. It was like watching Princeton play Columbia on a muddy after­noon. 
The june war was like a disasterous game against Notre Dame which Princeton im­pulsively added to its schedule, leaving several players crippled for life and the I others so embittered that they took to fight­ing viciously among themselves instead of scrimmaging happily as before. 
This may be instructive for the student of politics, but as one who all his life has had friendships and memories among theArabs to chensh, I have found no relish in describ­ing it. 
The first time I met Malcolm Kerr, in Cairo, several years ago. I happened to remind him of this remark and I told him that it had stuck in my memory because Notre Dame was my school. He shared my small delight at finding an unexpected mention of my alma mater. 
But then there followed a more distracted air as though the real meaning conveyed by this simile returned to him. He replied with only halfa smile, "And l'm from Princeton." 
Finally, let me give Malcolm himselfthe last word. His commendation of Albert Hourani, another great scholar of Ncar Eastern society and culture, applies to himself: "The effort to comprehend an alien culture is surely a worthy tradition in itself; the important thing is to do it with receptivity and imagination. as well as with skill." 
Father Patrick D. Gaffney is a professor in the Department ofAnthropologyat Notre Dame. 
The real threat of 1984 at Notre Dame 
Although the year is only 2 7 daysold, many people are tired ofGeorge Orwell's 1984. 
The book, embossed with a com­memorative seal, has climbed to number one on several bestseller lists around the country. And businessmen have been more than happy

Profundity's demise 
to to join the fun. hawking posters and T-shirts with Star-Wars-like abandon. 
At Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, as on any campus, mentioning 1984 has become the "in thing." The latest fad is 1984 parties where students wear drab clothes or the garb oftheir favorite University official. 
While students are quick to equate ad­ministrators with the Junior Anti-Sex League, Big Brother or the Thought Police, the com­parisons are often shallow. In fact, the most lucid example ofOrwell's world went, for the most part, unnoticed in yesterday's issue of 
The Observer. 

It seems Student Activities wants each club president to submit a roster with the names and J.D.'s ofall members so the University can have "concrete data to make statements about student involvement at Notre Dame." 
James McDonnell, director of Student Ac­tivities, says such data "could assist in plan­ning programs and activities while allowing us to come to an understanding ofwhere we are at Notre Dame." 
His motives sound pure enough. Admis­sions wants information to impress high school seniors with, and student activities wants to promote programs whose appeal is weak in particular colleges and classes. 
For instance, if students in business didn't put in as much volunteer work as those in other colleges, the University would take spe­cial steps to promote such activities for that 
group. Not even the Party kept such close tabs 
on Winston Smith's volunteer activities. 
It's not obvious that the University has any 
business collecting such data, much less ask­
ing club presidents to provide it. Unless the 
data is analyzed for hundreds of factors apart 
from class and college, the conclusions will be 
unscientific. 

The real problem is that the lhiversity can­not collect information for groups without collecting that ofindividuals. IfJames McDon­nell wants to know what senior philosophy majors do, he'll have to know exactly what I do. 
Of course there's no reason to be threatened, right? M ·lst students really wouldn't care if the entire world knew the clubs they belonged to. 
Unfortunately, the University is planning to use similar tactics to find out more about us. 
"New identification cards with all kinds of uses" will hit the campus next semester, McDonnell notes. Some of us aren't quite as 
ecstatic as he seems to be. The cards wiiJ 
enable the University to determine how many 
and which students attend concerts. dances, 
lectures and similar events. 

Students really don't want to be bothered with more detex machines, especially when going to events like concerts, lectures and dances. But forget the inconvenience -how much personal information should we let the University stick its nose into? 
The University certainly has no evil inten­tions, and probably would never usc the in­formation they collect on individual students for anything. What is not clear is whether they should even have access to such data. 
Once again the administration is asking us to trust them. As long as everyone who works for the University is perfect, we have nothing to worry about. Some ofus, however, are tired ofhaving to trust administrators who obvious­ly don't trust us. 
Welcome to 1984.

Lebanese government reinstates servicemen 

Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -President Amm (iemayt:l's administration on Yl"Stt·rtlay bowed to demands by Druse lt:ader Walidjumblatt that the army reinstate Druse soldiers who rt:li.tst·d to fight in civil warfare in St·ptember. 
Tht· rcinstatt·ment is designed to hdp revive a Saudi-sponsored st·curity plan stalled by demands from Jumblatt, said Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan. 
An estimated 500 to 800 Druse scrvict·men had refused to fight in the three weeks of fierce battling that pitted the army and Christian rightist militias against leftist Druse militiamen. The Druse sect's creed is based on Islam. 
The Druse soldiers were relieved from active duty with the army, but will be reinstated by the army high command within 48 hours, Wazzan announced. 
Promotions for the Druse soldiers 
-another demand by Jumblatt ­
will then be considered, Wazzan

The deadlock over the plan and the lack of any progress toward a Moslem-Christian reconciliation have fueled fears among Western diplomats. Lebanese officials and citizens that a new round ofcivil war could break out any time. 
A U.S. Embassy official denied rumors that the embassy was quietly advising Americans to leave Beirut for a while. But the official, who asked for anonymity, said that people who ask for embassy advice on security are advised to "reconsider their reasons for being here." 
"They have to decide for them­~lves whether they really need to be in Beirut now," he said. 
Meanwhile, Druse militiamen and government troops traded sporadic artillery and mortar fire yesterday under heavy rains in the hills above the U.S. Marine base southeast of Beirut. Police said no casualties were reported.

Letters to a Lonely God 
A Catholic father 
by Rev. Robert Griffin 
features columnist 
H
e was a middle-aged Catholic 
father brought up in an old­
fashioned tradition. He and his wife 
had worried and sacrificed all their 
adult life to raise a large family, 
teaching them the Christian 
decencies and educating them 
through college and graduate 
school; loving each child and being 
patient with him or her; giving the 
family every advantage which would 
not spoil them. The couple had lived 
through rough times when money 
was short and when the father ofthe 
brood suffered heart attacks from 
the effects oftension and overwork. 
No~. the oldest boy, six years out of Notre Dame, was living with a young woman without benefit of clergy. The father, knowing the ways ofthe world, wants to be patient and compassionate with his first-born. "I' ve been quiet for a year," he told me, "though I haven't liked the ar­rangement. My wife and I are fond of 
the young lady, and we've been hoping for a wedding. The time has come, I think, when I should tell my son he is living in an occasion ofsin." 
His voice broke, as though he was close to tears. 
I'm the family priest trying to be of help. Here was a middle-aged layman who has lived through the changes in the Catholic Church. He with his wife could have had a small­er family ifthey had compromised their Catholic consciences by practising birth control. He had seen his own brother dispensed ofhis vows as a priest and married in a sacramental union blessed by the Church. Here he was, in this naughty and permissive world, this decade of collapsed traditions, his 
anecdote: "The old man slipped me the word: 'You are living in sin.' " Such an episode is unlimited in the emotional mileage it offers. A Cath­olic son could cry himselfto sleep for months remembering his mot­her's heart is broken because her baby has grown up to live in sin.

faith in an old-fashioned morality, with its quaint, dated idiom, "living in an occasion ofsin." I could have worshipped him for the graces he lives by. The fundamental decencies were never updated by Vatican II so far as I know. It was inspiring to hear this father willing to challenge his son's conscience with the absolutes 
ofthe Ten Commandments. 
"He's driving me crazy," the father said. "He should marry the girl, or break offthe relationship. I'm going to take him aside and tell him he's living in sin, though his mother and I would be happy to welcome his girlfriend as a member ofthe fami­ly." 
He was hoping, I suspect, that I 
could lend him courage for the con­
frontation. He was also testing my 
approval and hoping for advice. "As 
a father," I said, "you can give your 
children any advice that you want 
to; you have earned that right. I 

would be careful, ifI were you, of 
telling him he is living in sin. He may 
reject that. He may feel, in fact, that 
he's doing the best he can, being 
faithful to one woman at a time." 
The young man, though he loves 
and respects his parents, was 
capable oflaughing at his father. He 
enjoys dramatics enough so that he 
would remember as a highlight the 
time his father said: "You are living 
in sin." He might feel he had joined 
the great Irish tradition oflapsed 
sons like ]amesjoyce or Eugene 
O'Neill who quarreled with their 
families over religion, and authors 
who have made a literary genre out 
of their disenchantments with the 
ancient faith that limits freedom. I 
could hear it being told as an 
This traditional father blinked at me as though I were the new voice oftolerance in his reformed Church. "Don't you think he is living in sin?" 
"Objectively, according to the old rules, his living arrangement is sin­ful," I said, because I don't know a more modern way ofputting it. "In his conscience, where guilt lives, he may be very comfortable, not caring what the Catholic Church teaches." 
"Should I go on saying nothing?," 

the father asked, "Not even pointing 
out that he's a bad example to his sis­
ters and brothers?" 
He is so great as a father. He must know better than any priest could tell him how to deal with his son, let­ting the young man know that he's into a lifestyle that is disappointing, compromising the values ofthe home and family in which he was raised. A grown man should be able to make his boy feel the paternal sad­ness because the boy is negligent of his own fulfillment as a husband and father, in company with a woman fulfilled in becoming a wife and mot­her. Parents, seriously Catholic, get into·accusatory showdowns with their offspring, where kids feel that they are being nailed to the wall with denominational definitions. The tradition that underlies all definitions begins with a few verses at the beginningof"Genesis." A man leaves his father and mother in obedience to the mandate ofGod supporting creation. 
The news ofthe sweetness of being parents should be passed on by the men and women who have been there. ACatholic father blessed with eight children should be wise enough to know that love is best when it is fruitful. He should be grieved ifhe has raised a son who lets himselfbe cheated ofthe joy of becominga father himself, as though having children weren't an un­rivalled benefit. 
"You needn't quarrel with your son on behalfofthe Church," I told him. I don't want the discussion be­tween them to be as narrow as whether the boy is living in sin. The boy has other lessons than the Cath­olic one to learn from his parents.

SMC swimmers open by breaking records 
By KATHLEEN NICHOLSON 
Sports Writer 
Since his arrival at Saint Mary's College in the fall of 1982, coach Scott Trees, a Notre Dame graduate student, has worked hard to build a strong swimming program for the Belles. The seventeen member team, composed of only four up­perclassmen, is now by far the lar­gest team on the Saint Mary's campus. 
Trees has six of his all-Americans returning this year, as well as last year's Moose Krause Award winner for the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's ath­lete of the year, senior captain Gail Casey, so prospects are bright. 
On Dec. I 0, Casey showed her talent against Valparaiso by winning the 50 and I00-yard breaststrokes, while being out-touched in the 100­yard individual medley. Sophomore Amy Stud.er managed to set a new varsity record against Valpo with her first place finish in the 200-yard in­dividual medley. 
Freshman Kathleen Kennedy chalked up even more points for the Belles in the meet, fmishing first in the 50-yard breaststroke. Still, Saint Mary's fell six points short, losing 73-67. 
The Belles bounced back against Albion College on Dec. 14, winning 78-57. Studer lead the team with three personal firsts -in the 100­yard backstroke, and in the 50 and IOO-yard fly, the last ofwhich was in record-breaking time. 
Casey added two more firsts, in 
the 50-yard breaststroke and IOO­
yard individual medley, while 
teammates Rosie Whalen and Ellen 
Byrne copped firsts in the 50-yard 
continuedfrompage 16 
form before the season started," he admits. The mere fact that Sluby has done so well this year -he is averaging 
16.1 points on 56-percent shooting prior to tomorrow's game with Maryland -is not all that surprising to Phelps, though. 
"When Tommy plays with that in­
tensity and aggressiveness," says 
Phelps, "there's not too many 
people who can stop him. Tommy 
knows that and it's getting him into a 
groove." 
It's games like tomorrow's when Notre Dame needs Sluby the most. The senior is expected by almost everyone, including Phelps, to take charge and produce when needed. 
"Sluby's got to come through for us,'' Phelps says. "He's got to get 20. 24 points in a big game for us. He just has to. That's our offense. We call backstroke and 100-yard freestyle, respectively. 
Freshman standout Jer:.nifer Hirschfeld took first in both the diving events, setting a new varsity record on the three-meter board. The 200-yard freestyle relay composed of Casey, Studer, Byrne, and freshman Barb Dorini also set a new varsity record to conclude a smashing meet for the women. 
Christmas break was no vacation for the Belles, as they headed south to Ft. Lauderdale for two weeks of intense training. 
"They're an amazing team, very self-motivated and always giving their best," comments Trees on his team. "We're considerably better than we were last year." 
Heading north onJan. 15, the girls splashed back into action on the 21st in a dual meet against Adrian and Calvin. Three varsity records were broken and seven first places were captured. 
Casey was a triple winner, taking the 50-yard breaststroke, 50-yard fly, and 100-yard individual medley. Studer, swimming a total of 106 laps in the meet, won the 1650-yard freestyle and the 400-yard in­dividual medley in record time, as well as the 500-yard freestyle. 
Whalen took another first in the I00-yard backstroke and freshman Michelle Mannion was the last one to break a record in the meet, win­ning the 200-yard breaststroke. 
Saint Mary's went on to defeat Adrian, II5-20, while losing to Cal­vin, 83-65. 
Tomorrow the Belles meet DePauw University for what should prove to be yet another record smashing meet. 
  . Sluby 
plays for him, we want him with the ball, and we don't think people can 
stop him when he's in the groove. 
"He's got to become the leader in (important) situations. I've forced him to be the star, so to speak." 
Don't think Sluby doesn't realize this, either. 
"Sometimes when he wants me to get the ball I can kind of sense it," Sluby remarks. "Still, I don't go out there thinking about pressure. I just want to relax and have some fun." 
So far this season, but especially since Notre Dame's four-game road trip began on Jan. 4, Sluby has met Phelps' challenge to be the star. He has already scored 30 more points this season than he did in his entire sophomore and junior seasons combined, and needs only 56 more 
points  to  surpass  the  combined

seasons.  

Yet, despite the way he has come on as a player this year, Sluby ha.o. no preconceptions that he can one day play in the NBA. Presently the senior in the College of Arts and Letters is planning other possible options. He has applied for a scholarship at MBA school and is taking part in some job interviews. 
"I wouldn't mind playing but I'm not sure what will happen," says Sluby. "I'm just going to sit back and wait." 
And waiting is something that Sluby has has to do a lot in his career at Notre Dame.

He has accumulated 45 points on I9 goals and 26 assists. Mike Metzler is next with I 7 goals and 1 7 assists. Third in scoring is Adam Parsons, who has I3 goals and 20 assists for 33 points.

The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team will try to end its four­game losing streak when North Star Conference opponent Evansville visits the ACC tonight at 7:30. 
Coach Mary DiStanislao will be looking for the right combination of players to get her squad back to the level of performance that it showed briefly during the early part of the year. 
In order to get things rolling, however, the Irish must get past the Aces from Evansville. Early in the year, this game appeared to he a breather, but with Notre Dame standing at 6-10, the game has become extremely important. Tougher opponents like DePaul,

which beat the Irish by 16 last week, lie just around the corner. 
The key to the game will be Notre Dame's ability to control Evansville's two excellent guards. Shelly Brand, a 5-9 junior, and Barb Dykstra, a 5-7 sophomore, average a combined 33 points a game to ac­count for a large chunk of the Evansville offense. 
Giving the guards help inside will be a front line that has only one player over 5-9.Jenny Schulz, who at 5-9 is easily the smallest center the Irish have gone up against, will try to usc her quickness to outmaneuver the taller Irish players. She will get some help from 6-0 freshman Karen Baney. 
Likewise, the Evansville forwards 
will have to try to outmaneuve 
their much taller counterparts. 
Freshmen Lisa Martin and Bobbi Jo 
Lovell, junior Denise Spear, and 
senior Marty Niehaus will fill out the 
front line. 

Besides superior size, the Irish have a big advantage being at home. The Aces, under Coach Linda Wam­bach, have not fared particularly well on the road this year, posting a 2-7 mark. On the other hand, Norre Dame has dropped two in a row at home. 
Nevertheless, DiStanislao has promised some changes and, if they p!ay well, the Irish could get back on the winning track by the time DePaul comes to the ACC on Mon­day.

The Notre Dame track team and ·Notre Dame track fans their first Head CoachJoe Piane open up their IJook at this year's team. This year's busiest weekend of this young ; Irish squad, which could emerge as season tonight in the ACC. The Piane's best team in his nine years at weekend will be a hectic one be-Notre Dame, will welcome teams cause Irish runners will also be ,from Ball State, DePaul, Northwes­traveling to New York's Madison :tern, Loyola, and Valparaiso. 
Square Garden and Chicago's Rosemont Horizon before Monday rolls around. 
Coming off a narrow 68-63loss at the hands of Iowa last Saturday, the Irish expect more tough competi­tion again this weekend. 
However, four Notre Dame run­ners will be in New York rather than South Bend tonight. The four will be competing in the Millrose Games at Madison Garden. 
The contingent going to New York will be runners from the two­mile relay team. Jim Moyar, a senior and a three-year letterman, leads off for the relay team.

On Sunday, some other members of the Notre Dame team will travel to Chicago for the annual Goodwill Games. The Irish will enter the distance-medley relays, long jump, and high hurdles, as well as the 60­yard dash and two-mile run. Piane feels that the weekend will be as hard for the team as it sounds, beginning with tonight's meet. "Since we're running four guys in New York and resting some for Sun­day, it will be a heck of a meet (tonight)," assesses Piane. Tonight's meet is the first of two home indoor meets for Notre Dame this season and will provide a good chance to see the Irish athletes in ac­tion. 
Hoosiers defeat Wildcats 
Associated Press 

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -In­diana's trademark over Coach Bob Knight's 13-year reign has been a relentless man-to-man defense, but the Hoosiers used an unexpected zone defense last night and came away with a satisfying 57-44 Big Ten Conference victory over Northwes­
tern. 

"This is the first time since I've been here that we've played zone," said Knight. "We were in a diamond­and-one a lot of the time. I'd say of every five Northwestern posses­sions, we were in a zone three times and man-to-man two times." 
The Hoosier defense held Northwestern scoreless for more than six minutes late in the ~econd half. Sophomore guard Stew Robin­son, meanwhile, led Indiana's of­
fense with a career-high 17 points. 
"They were having some troubles on their end and I'd like to think that what we did defensively had some­thing to do with their problems," said Knight. "Robinson played per­haps as well as at any point all year. He was a little freer with what he was able to do." 
Northwestern coach Rich Falk said, "I· was proud of our guys, we hung tough and were in the game early. 
"We got out to a 6-0 lead and before you knew it Indiana was up 10-6. Any time you're within four or five at halftime at Indiana you have to feel real good. We took some ill­advised shots and allowed Indiana to 
get their 10 and 12-point lead." 
Falk said the Hoosiers "did a super job defensively ... We didn't do a good job of kicking the ball out to the open man. Robinson definitely
' hurt us, no question. We respect him on the drive, but he hit three or fourI, shots from the perimeter."

dishing oft 62 ( 4.1 average per game). Adkins penetrates well, is a pretty good outside shooter (hitting 61 percent this year), and fits in well with the Terps' fast-breaking style. He has been chipping in an average of I 1.0 points per game and has started every game for Maryland the last two years. 
These five starters for Maryland are shooting a collective 57 percent from the field and Phelps is obvious­ly impressed with that mark. 
"Maryland is probably the best shooting team in the country," praises the Notre Dame coach. "Rebounding-wise, they're as strong as any team we've faced. We have to contain their outside shooting and do a job on the boards (in order to win)." 
One of the first players off the bench for the Terps is 6-9, 220­pound senior forward Mark Fother­gill. Fothergill is a career 53-percent shooter who has appeared in every Maryland game this year, always in a relief role. 
Others who have a good chance of playing time for the Terps tomorrow are freshmen Keith Gatlin and Terry Long, as well as Driesell's son,

For the Irish, tomorrow's game means another chance to beat a re­spectable team, something they haven't done too often this year, and Phelps fully realizes this fact. 
"We're playing for credibility," says Phelps. "That's what this game is for us. If we beat Mlryland, that puts us in a good pt>sition (for the NCAA Tournament). 
"This game means a lot for us team-wise," states captain Tom Sluby on the importance ofthe game with Maryland. 
The Irish have been playing well of late but their weariness from playing three games in five days clearly showed Wednesday night. against Davidson, especially in the rebounding department. The Wildcats were able to outrebound their much taller hosts. But, accord­ing to Phelps, Wednesday night's game was important in his eyes. 
"Anytime a team can play this tired and still win, that's a good sign," commented Phelps after the signs tomorrow. In fact, he is count­ingon them. 
"In my opinion, it's going to come down to the last minute," he says, "but Saturday's a Notre Dame mo­ment. We have a history of rising to the occasion when we're an under­dog." 
Whether or not this Maryland 
game will go down ill the books with 
past Notre Dame upsets of the 
UCLA's, DePaul's, and San Fran­
cisco's is a question which won't be 
answered until sometime late 
tomorrow afternoon. But even more 
than wanting to get another upset in 
the record book, the Irish would like 
to give Lefty Driesell a little birthday present tomorrow.

"Veal is a very good shooter form the corner," assesses Phelps. 
He also can play some defense and was voted the Terps' "Best Defensive Player" last year, Veal serves as a co-captain along with Coleman. 
An old Notre Dame nemesis is 6-8 junior Adrian Branch, who will like­ly be at the off-guard spot for the Terps tomorrow. Branch has scored 16 and H! points in the two years he has played against the Irish. Ranked 14th on Maryland's all-time scoring list, he is also an excellent ball hand­ler who is a bonafide all-America candidate. 
A fine player throughout his career at Maryland, Branch was voted the Terps MVP as a freshman and shared the same award with Coleman last year. Branch presently averages 12.6 points and 3.6 rebounds.

hack to the early part ofthe century, while Notre Dame 
basketball tradition really didn't begin until the days of 
Austin Carr in the late '60's. 

The fact is that there is nothing, and probably never 
will be anything, like a Notre Dame home football game. 
Football games are social events. On the other hand, 
basketball fans are at the ACC to watch a basketball game. 
Also, two mediocre, if not poor years have robbed the student body of its enthusiasm for basketball. Ex­pensive tickets and exciting opponents like the En­gineers of Lehigh have been small deterrents, but, in general, the students, long spoiled by very successful teams, have turned their attention away from the ath­leti<: scene. 
It is being unfair to say that everyone has been af­fected negatively. There is still a fairly strong core of students who attend games regularly. Ifit wasn't for this group, the ACC would be a morgue during the games. Its behavior exemplifies Notre Dame spirit and originality at its best. However, the general student sup­port for the team is so weak that the pep rally that had been scheduled for tonight was canceled. 
This lack ofenthusiasm could prove dangerous in the long run. The basketball team needs the student sup­port more than any other team at Notre Dame. Except for the football program, no other sport is expected to draw large, paying crowds. And football will always be able to get rid ofas many tickets as it needs to. 
If people cannot get excited about these next two weeks of basketball, they won't be able to get excited about basketball at all. The fifth-ranked and second­ranked teams in the nation will both be here on national television. Winning either one ofthose games would be an immense help in getting the Irish into the NCAA Tournament. Notre Dame Is now on a two-game televi­sion roll (Liberty Bowl and Villanova) and it is impor­tant to keep this streak going. 
This is also the chance for the Notre Dame students to win back the reputation for being the "sixth man." Back in 1977, the student body was voted the game's MVP by NBC Sports in Notre Dame's upset of No. 1 San Francisco. Ifthis could happen again (the team has to do 
tts part, too), people around the country would realize 
that Notre Dame students haven't given up on their 
teams just because they are losing. 
The nice thing is that both Maryland and DePaul are 
talented teams who are very capable ofchoking in the 
clutch. Not that Notre Dame is the greatest clutch team, 
but the Irish won't have people distracting them at the 
foul line and students yelling at them in tight situations. 
Two years ago, when Maryland came to the ACC to 
face a Notre Dame team that would end up I 0-l 7, the 
Terps lost their composure and the game. The Notre 
Dame-Maryland rivalry almost always guarantees a very 
close game and, historically, the team that wasn't 
supposed to win, did. Maryland, like Notre Dame. has a 
habit of playing down to its opponent's level, but the 
Irish can also play up to the level of their competition. 
So it should be a close game. 
Likewise, DePaul could bring out the best in the Irish 
in Ray Meyer's last appearance as DePaul coach. 
The crowd can play a very important role in the next couple of weeks. And, in basketball, more than in any other sport, the crowd can help out the home team. The fans sit right next to the court and right behind the bench. Arenas like the ACC keep the noise loud and continuous. 
Digger Phelps knows this very well and likes to come up with new ideas to get an extra edge from the fans. Just this year, he has suggested that the students get up at halftime and move behind the opposite basket to make the opponent shoot into the student section for both halves. It was a good idea, but the townies who sit in those seats were not about to switch to the other 
side. 

His latest idea he actually borrowed from Washing­ton fans. It was called The Wave out there, but Digger wants to create "The Irish Sea." Ifyou haven't ever seen The Wave in action, it involves the various sections standing up and sitting down in order. The motion gives a wave effect through the stands. People in Washington love The Wave, but it's hard to see South Benders doing anything but sit on their hands. 
It might appear that Digger is spending too much time worrying about the fans, but he has called the Maryland game, "a typical Notre Dame moment." 
In the past, that has usually meant a Notre Dame up­set. It's been a while, but maybe we can get lightning to strike again.

Sluby's the star now but it's been long wait 
ByJEFF BLUMB

Right now he's the star, the one who the Notre Dame basketball team looks to when it really needs a basket. But it hasn't always been that way for Irish captain Tom Sluby. 
After appearing in 27 of 29 games off the bench as a freshman, during which time he averaged 3.2 points, Sluby opened his sophomore cam­paign as a starter at the small forward spot, averaging 7.8 points a game. That role lasted only 11 games, however, because he became academically ineligible at the end of the first semester. 
Sluby was once again in a relief role when he returned to action the following season. Astress fracture of an ankle hobbled him throughout the month of December, however, holding him back and forcing the swingman to struggle to get back to a position where he could make a serious contribution to the team duringthe second halfofthe season. 
Then came the North Carolina 
State game. Sluby came offthe bench 
to go five-for-five from the floor in 
that game, contributing 11 points in 
Notre Dame's narrow 43-42 win 
over the eventual NCAA champion 
Wolfpack. 

That game was the springboard for Sluby, as he went on to start the final eight games of the year for the Irish at the off guard spot, hitting double figures in six of those games. Still,' Irish coach Digger Phelps was not sure who would be his captain the next season and delayed naming one at season's end. 
But, by the end of May, there wasn't any question in Phelps' mind that Sluby would be his captain for this year. His performance during Notre Dame's summer trip to Yugos­lavia left little doubt that he was the man for the job. 
Sluby came off the bench to con­
tribute 22 and 18 points as Notre 
Dame went on to win the Zadar Cup. 
In doing so, he was selected as the 
outstanding young player in Zadar 
Cup play. 

For the native of Washington, D.C., a city that has produced such other Notre Dame greats as Austin Carr, Sid Catlett, Collis Jones, Bob Whitmore, Adrian Dantley, and Tracy Jackson, the Yugoslavia trip was a most valuable experience. 
"I went over there wanting to get more playing experience and to work on some basic things like defense, rebounding, and shooting," reflects Sluby. "I was loose and playing well." 
Yet, probably the most important 
thing the senior swingman gained 
from the trip is something that is 
hard to measure with stars. 
"I came out with more self­confidence and gained the con­fidence ofother people," Sluby says. 
Still, his good play in Yugoslavia and his new position as captain was no guarantee that things would go well for Sluby this season, and he knew it. 
"I didn't set any goals because I didn't really know how much playing time I'd get or how I'd per-
