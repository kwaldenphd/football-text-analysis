GSU candidates compare similarities and differences 
By JASON WILLIAMS Assistant News Editor 
Graduate Student Union (GSU) presidential candidates gathered last night to debate is­sues relative to the general elections which are taking place today. 
Rita Francis and Ed Wingen­bach spoke to only a handful of students who attended the fo­rum last night in Nieuwland Science Hall. Both candidates touched on similar issues and both admitted their differences were slight. 
Wingenbach called for more communicative representation among graduate students, in­sisted on the improvement of committee structure within the GSU and advocated the protec­tion and promotion of graduate student issues. Francis grouped her concerns under four major areas: travel grants, committee issues, communications and social space. 
"We need to find a way of dispensing as much money as possible through our travel grant process," Francis said. "We need to show the Univer­sity that we are going to put all of this money to good use." 
Her social space concerns in­
clude enlarging the physical 
space of GSU office facilities 
and upgrading or expanding 
Wilson Commons for student 
purposes. 
Wingenbach stressed the im-

Six killed as train hits gas tanker 

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -A gasoline tanker trapped in traffic at a railroad crossing was struck by an Am­trak train Wednesday and ex­ploded in a giant fireball that set nine other cars and trucks ablaze. The tanker driver and five others died in their vehi­cles. 
Fifteen people waiting at the crossing were injured, and six of the 118 aboard the train were taken to a hospital for observation, officials said. 
Witnesses described panic as people stuck in traffic scram­bled for their lives after the blast. 
"I just saw some people screaming all over the place," said Billy Rodriguez, 25, of Co­ral Springs. 
A Broward County sheriff's deputy in his patrol car at the time pulled the driver out of a burning vehicle behind him, said Sonya Friedman, a Fort Lauderdale police spokeswoman. "He tried to rescue another, but couldn't because of the fireball," she said. 
The blast left cars and small trucks scorched and scattered as if they had been in a tank battle. The gasoline truck burned for more than two hours after the midafternoon crash at a crossing near Inter­state 95. 
"The explosion was unbe­lievable," said witness Tim Dahms. "The sky was just black." 
portance of improving graduate student representation through expanded, active involvement. 
"I think there needs to be a more vocal promotion of grad­uate student issues," he said. "There's a lot of graduate stu­dents who do not know what our concerns are. Through im­proved communication students can discover these concerns." 
Both candidates brought up the issue of establishing a Women's Resource Center on campus. Francis said she had been involved in establishing a Women's Resource Center on another campus. Wingenbach said he has been involved and concerned with establishing a center ever since it was first brought to the GSU's attention. 
Francis' committee issue concerns include improved health insurance, child care and the re-establishment of the Intellectual Life Committee. Wigenbach said his concerns lies in the structure of the cur­rent committee system with more regular, posted committee meetings. 
Francis said the major differ­ence between her and Wigen­bach is their approach to the is­sues. 
"We have two very different styles of doing things simply because we are different indi­viduals," she said. "I have found through my experience in other graduate student activ­

honored 
Special to the Observer 
Two members of the Saint Mary's community were honored Tuesday at the 14th annual Tribute to Women for their achievements and contri­butions to the community. 
Nancy Menk, associate pro­fessor of music and director of choral activities at Saint Mary's, was selected as the Woman of the Year and the co­honoree for the Arts. 
Saint Mary's Senior Michele Budd was among the area col­lege honorees at the Tribute. 
The Tribute is sponsored by the YWCA of St. Joseph County. The honorees were selected from among 82 nominees in five categories. 
Menk is the founder and mu­sical director of the South Bend Chamber Singers. She is the founder and coordinator of the annual Saint Mary's College High School Women's Choir Festival. 
She was selected for the Na­tional Conductor's Symposium in VancouveJ;, British Columbia in 1991.

The cars of the train -the Silver Star from New York City -remained upright. The fire­blackened lead locomotive stopped several hundred yards down the track. 
Another witness, Barbara Freeman, said the tanker was trapped in bumper-to-bumper traffic when the warning lights came on and the gate lowered. 
"He couldn't back up; and he couldn't go forward. Then, the crossing gate did come down, but it came down on the cab of his truck." 
The truck driver desperately inched forward until the crossing gate broke, Freeman said. Then the train hit the back of the tanker. 
The train had been starting to brake and was going about 30 to 35 mph, said Fort Laud­erdale police spokeswoman Sonya Friedman. 
Killed were the tanker driver, three people in a van and two in a car, said Broward County sheriff's spokesman Ott Cefkin. He said most of the 15 injured in their vehicles suffered smoke inhalation. 
The train carried 108 pas­sengers and 10 crew members; six passengers were taken to a hospital for observation, Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said. 
The Amerada Hess Corp. tanker was carrying about 8,500 gallons of gasoline ­near its capacity -when it was struck, said Carl Tursi, a spokesman for the company. 


Series examines ethnicity 
By LAURA FERGUSON News Writer 
Since everyone is ethnic, eth­nicity does not solely pertain to minorities, according to Tina Buchanan, a Saint Mary's se­nior and one of the organizers of a week long lecture series fo­cusing on "identity." 
The third event in the series of "Inner Exploration" was an ethnic identity group discussion held last night in the Stapleton Lounge in LeMans Hall. 
Several students, faculty, and administrators participated in the open and informal dis­cussion sponsored by Minority International and Non-tradi­tional Students (MINT) and SMC Really Groovy Women. 
"The main question of this week is 'do you know who you are?' By organizing this week of events we hope to help peo­ple to search for the answer in themselves and tonight I feel that we were successful in do­ing this," said Buchanan. 
This informal discussion surfaced several viewpoints. 
"Many Americans experience ethnicity as a void, but if it comes to a question of national­ity then we all have ethnicity. This void is a very common· American experience," added Julie Storme, assistant profes­sor of modern languages. 
"We must all hold onto our ethnicity," said Frances Shavers, a representative from the NO Alumni Association. "If we increase the ethnic back­ground of everyone, then that might bring us all together." 
"It is like the analogy of the world as a salad. If we improve each individual vegetable the whole salad will taste better. However we tend to become too self absorbed in our own eth­nicity to do this," added Shavers. 
In general, the message from the group was that people need to promote tolerance and re­spect others regardless of their ethnicity. 
This discussion series on identity was organized by a group of four Saint Mary's se­niors known as SMC Really Groovy Women. The members of this organization are Tina Buchanan, Sarah Fisko, Delia Garcia, and Renee Young. Although not an official club, the group is responsible for this lecture series, a multi-cultural week in the spring of 1992, and a previous celebration which recognized Christopher Columbus. 
The next event in this series will focus on sexual identity. It will take place tonight at 6 p.m. in the Haggar Parlor at Saint Mary's.

Mastering the art: getting past the guards 
You and your roommate------­'ust ran some errands off Kelly 0' Neill 
campus,  and you refuse to  Assitant Office  
park in D2000 and walk  
back to the dorm.  Instead,  Manager  
you pull up to the security  

guard, look him/her in the eye, and lie through your teeth. 
I would consider myself to be a very honest person, except when it comes to making up reasons for getting my automobile on campus. I'll admit it, when trying to get past the security guard, I'm a compulsive liar. 
Although I often tend to use the more standard reasons such as loading luggage or unloading groceries, I have discovered some other excuses which are much more exciting and effective. 
Injuries always work. My roommate once stuffed kleenex in her sock and faked a sprained ankle; she was waved onto campus without question. I have also discovered that leaving crutches in the car or claiming to take a friend to physical therapy always gets sympathy from the guards. 
Creativity may also get you past the security guards. I was once with a friend who had to pick up a refrigerator in Farley (it was a Tuesday night in November). One of the best lies I ever heard, however, came from a girl claiming she had to pick up three sheet cakes in the dining hall for her dorm's SYR. Even though it was a Thursday night, the guard let her on campus, probably because he was so impressed with her excuse. 
When pulling up to the security booth, it is never easy trying to figure out how sympathetic the guards will be to your excuse. Some will Jet anybody on, others hand out passes, and a few probably won't even let Monk on campus. 
It is much easier getting waved on when it is cold or raining outside (which is pretty often in South Bend). It seems that many of the guards would rather sit in their booth than check to make sure you really do have groceries. 
I never have been able to figure out the system for handing out passes; sometimes thi guards give them, sometimes they don't. Also, the passes are always for a different amount o time. 
And if the pass expires while you are still on campus, is it better to take it off, or leave it on your car even though it is invalid? 
Some of the guards may refuse to let you on campus regardless of your excuse. I once needed to drop off some people in a snowstorm after a formal. The guard asked me why I (the girl) was driving; I explained that it was my car. He then questioned me for about five minutes before taking my license and Jetting me drop everyone off. I guess he gave up Jetting autos on campus for Lent. 
Notre Dame just wouldn't be Notre Dame without the thrill of getting past the se.curity guards. The next time you want your car on campus, don't be afraid to try a really farfetched excuse. It is much more exciting telling them you're Monk's main squeeze than claiming you have luggage to load.

E~erts say corpse was not Hitler's 
P RIS -French forensic experts say the charred corpse said to be Hitler's was not his body, and that experts falsified verification reports ordered by Josef Stalin to appease the Soviet dictator. In a report published in the professional review Hospital Weekly, four forensic scientists concluded that the body actually was that of an 
' unknown German male. The article, published on March 11 and excerpted in France's national press this week, does not claim that Hitler survived and fled Germany, but rather that his body was shown to a German soldier. The body was later apparently transported to the Soviet Union. According to the Soviet autopsy, the body found outside the Berlin bunker where Hitler committed suicide with his wife, Eva Braun, had an extra tooth and only one testicle. The French team believes doctors were under pressure from Stalin to fake the autopsy, because he wanted to show the world Hitler was really dead. 
Oil discovered in Latin America 
CARACAS, Venezuela -Major discoveries of oil and gas are likely in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, according to a study by Amoco Corp. "There is reason to be optimistic about the future in Latin America," oil compa:1y manager George Kronman said Tuesday in a speech to the Venezuelan-American Petroleum Geology Congress. He said Amoco predicts discoveries of at least 500 million barrels in six basins: the Campos in Brazil, the Llanos in Colombia, the Reforma-Campeche and the Tampico-Misantla in Mexico, and the Maracaibo and the Maturin in Venezuela. Latin America has the largest amount of proven crude reserves outside the Middle East, according to 1991 data, Kronman said.

NATIONAL Helen Haves dies at age 92 
NYACK, N.Y. -Helen Hayes, who won the highest honors of stage, screen and television and was dubbed "First Lady of the American Theater," died Wednesday. She was 92. Hayes was brought to Nyack Hospital, in this New York suburb where she made her home, early last week suffering from congestive heart failure. The hospital would not release further information at the request of Hayes' son, actor James MacArthur. She received three Tonys and an Emmy as well as two Oscars, and in 1981 was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement. Miss Hayes left the theater in 1971. after 66 years, because of allergies to dust that aggravated chronic bronchitis. But she always said the theater was still her first love.

Navy guarantees ROTC jobs 
By JOHN LUCAS for graduating Midshipmen, ships, which would be able to Assistant News Editor Wilmot explained that there are quickly respond to regional still many opportunities left in conflicts around the globe.

The Observer/ John Bingham 

Rear Admiral Louise Wilmot addresses a meeting yesterday for the Naval ROTC Midshipman's Battalion. 
Although working toward modernization and downsizing, the U.S. Navy will continue to guarantee jobs for graduating ROTC students, according to Rear Admiral Louise Wilmot. 
"The sweeping changes pre­sent challenges to me and to you, but I ask you to embrace the changes, know what they are, and make them your own," she said yesterday afternoon, addressing a meeting of the Naval ROTC's Midshipman's Battalion. 
Through all the current reor­ganization, the Navy will con­tinue to promise positions for all graduating ROTC Midship­men. 
"We can guarantee that there will be a job for each of our graduates," she said. 
In addition to promising jobs to be explored in the Navy, particularly for women and minorities.

"I want everyone to under­stand that the Navy is still a vi­able career," she said. 
Behind the current changes, which involve base closings and the shrinking of the 600 ship fleet of four years ago, Wilmot cited a recent joint report by the Navy and the Marine Corps, entitled "From The Sea." The report detailed proposed changes and compelled the Navy to begin to modernize its forces and refocus its mission. 
"We simply had to adapt our naval forces to the 21st cen­tury," she said 
The new mission of the Navy, according to Wilmot, is the establishment of a smaller force, ranging from 319 to 344 
Don't spend an hour in the shower! 
Wilmot referred to the recent deployment of troops in Somalia as an example of this new kind of navy. 
In refocusing toward smaller crises, the Navy's focus would no longer be geared toward the "domination of the open sea," but rather place an "emphasis on mobility," she said. 
The proposed changes and reorganization will not be with­out some difficulty for those lo­cated at the 31 bases to be closed and the 134 to be recon­figured, Wilmot said. 
"If ships go, bases go, and if bases go, people go," she said, citing that nearly 200,000 civilians will be affected by the proposed closures. 
With upcoming announce­ments and the analysis of plans for daily base closings, Wilmot urged the Midshipmen to stay abreast of the current situation the Navy faces by reading newspaper articles and edito­rials. 
"It is very difficult to keep up 
with the changes," she admit­
ted.

Muslim sheik ordered deported 
NEW YORK (AP) -An ex­tremist Muslim cleric who preaches at the same mosque where two suspects in the World Trade Center bombing worship was ordered deported from the United States on Wednesday. 
The action came as a federal grand jury in Manhattan re­turned indictments against the two suspects already in custody and charged in the blast: Mo­hammed Salameh, 25, and Nidal Ayyad, also 25. 
The Feb. 26 blast, which shut down the World Trade Center for nearly three weeks, killed six people, injured more than 1,000 and did tens of millions of dollars in damage to the city economy. One of the buildings will reopen Thursday when Gov. Mario Cuomo returns to his 57th floor offices. 
The deportation order against Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman was unrelated to the blast. But Salameh and Ayyad both have worshiped at the Jersey City mosque where he has preached. 
Abdel-Rahman, 54, had come before U.S. Immigration Judge Daniel Meisner on Jan. 20 for a closed hearing requested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to remove the sheik from the country. 
The immigration service said Abdel-Rahman did not disclose in 1991 that he is a polygamist and that he was convicted of falsifying a check in Egypt in 1987. Both are grounds for ex­clusion from the United States. 
Abdel-Rahman left Egypt for the U.S. after his acquittal in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. The cleric has been known to issue 
service organization. Budd is currently the lieu­

Honors 

fatwas, or death orders, against what he considers to be infidels against Islam. 
He has denied any involve­ment in the twin towers attack. 
The indictment returned Wednesday said that Salameh and Ayyad "unlawfully, willfully, knowingly and maliciously" damaged the world's second­tallest buildings "by use of an explosive device." 
Authorities allege Salameh, of Jersey City, N.J., rented the van used to transport the explosive, while Ayyad, of Maplewood, N.J., was capable of building a bomb. Ayyad is a chemical engineer. 
The suspects face life without parole if convicted. 
The single-paragraph in­dictment shed no new light on a motive for the blast or possible links between the alleged bombers and Abdel-Rahman.

NYC parade stirs controversy between gays, Catholics 
NEW YORK (AP) -It was a badly splintered St. Patrick's Day celebration. 
The mayor stayed at home. The cardinal was snug under a canopy on the cathedral steps, waving and smiling at paraders. And more than 200 gay protesters who raised a racket ended up celebrating at Man­hattan Central Booking. 
Only about 120,000 people marched Wednesday in the 
nation's oldest St. Patrick's Day parade, tens of thousands less than usual, and spectators along Fifth Avenue were rarely more than three deep. Orga­nizers blamed the poor turnout on a never-ending Irish-style drizzle. 
But what was most remark­able about the 232nd parade, even by the unpleasant stan­dards of recent years, was how

Whisler, Fedesna, Good 
& Regan on March 18ili! 

many Irish-for-a-day were go­ing their own way. 
More than an hour before the main parade's start, hundreds of marchers protesting the exclusion of Irish homosexuals staged a countermarch up Fifth Avenue, chanting "Hey-hey, ho­ho, homophobia has got to go!" 
When they ran into a line of police, they knelt or squatted as police cuffed them and moved them into vans and buses. 
In all, 228 were arrested, most for violating a court order, including City Councilman Thomas Duane, an acknowl­edged homosexual who was cheered as he stepped into a police wagon. Five were charged with disorderly con­duct. 
"Our tax dollars at work," laughed one protester. 
In Ireland, a gay organization entered a float in the Dublin parade with no appreciable controversy. Last year, a gay group entered a float in the Cork parade, and won a prize. 
Elsewhere, Chicago's 38th parade went ahead in freezing temperatures. 
In Boston, where last Sunday's parade was postponed a week by the blizzard, organizers were trying to block a gay group from marching for the second consecutive year. Last month, a judge ruled the homosexuals had a right to march. 
A predicted rain fail to show up for the parade in Savannah, Ga., which drew at least 200,000 spectators. The march in Albuquerque, N.M., was canceled because of unpaid bills to city police from past parades. 
In New York, a judge ruled Tuesday that the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, which has battled for three years to be included in the main parade, could not stage a protest parade on the avenue. 
Mayor David Dinkins boy­cotted the parade; instead, he gave a breakfast at his official Gracie Mansion and told his guests that "a few small-minded individuals have soured this celebration with attitudes of intolerance and exclusion." 
Dinkins, who had tried to get 
the gay delegation into the pa­
rade, was referring to members 
of the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians, the parade's tradi­tional sponsor. 
The city had taken away the Hibernians' parade permit, but a federal judge gave it back, citing the Hibernians' right to freedom of speech, religion and association. The city then op­posed the gay group's request for a counter march, warning that it could lead to violence. 
During Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Cardinal John O'Connor complained that, for years, "Irish Catholics have been persecuted for the sole reason that they have refused to compromise church teaching. What others may call bigotry, Irish Catholics call principle." 
Later, when asked about Dinkins, Gov. Mario Cuomo and other officials who skipped the parade, the cardinal said, "Politicians make their own judgments. Thank God I'm not one." 
The parade itself was rela­tively somber, with no grand marshal and a color scheme in which green was rivaled by the black of countless umbrellas and the white remnant of last week's blizzard.

Fog hinders rescue efforts for hikers lost in Smokies 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) ­Helicopter rescue efforts in the Great Smoky Mountains were grounded Wednesday by rain and fog as rangers searched the snowy slopes on foot for as many as 45 stranded campers and hikers. 
The death toll from the weekend storm that paralyzed much of the Eastern Seaboard reached 232, and searches have been suspended for 32 crewmen from a sunken freighter otT Nova Scotia and 16 mariners lost in waters around Florida. 
An official said he hoped he­licopters would be able to re­sume flying over the mountains in and near Great Smoky Mountain National Park astride the Tennessee-North Carolina state line on Thursday morning to retrieve people stuck by record snows. 
Some hikers have waved off helicopters previously, prefer­ring to take their chances. They no longer have that option, Shelton said. 
"We'll go get 'em out whether they want to come or not," Shelton said. "The park has ordered everybody out." 
Rangers on snowshoes hoped to reach shelters along the Appalachian Trail sometime Wednesday night, National Park Service spokesman Bob Miller said. "We hope to find some people there and verify their medical condition tonight," he said. 
Miller said three parties of hikers had filed itineraries at trail heads where they entered the park. A fourth group of hikers was attempting to walk the entire Appalachian Trail; they weren't required to file itineraries, he said. 
Nearly 120 students and teachers from a Detroit-area prep school became snowbound during a wilderness expedition in the same area, but all of them had walked out or were flown to safety by Tuesday. 
Elsewhere, the storm con­tributed to a shutdown of 5,000 automatic teller machines, af­fecting more than a million cardholders around the coun­try. 
The machines are owned or operated by Dallas-based Elec­tronic Data Systems Corp., and its New Jersey computer center ground to a halt Saturday after part of the building's roof and walls collapsed under the pres­sure of heavy snow and high wind, said Jon Senderling, EDS spokesman in Dallas. 
EDS is transferring its com­puter work to a backup site in Rochelle Park, N.J., but the transition will take days to complete, he said.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -The body count is rising as shootouts between government security forces and Muslim extremists become more frequent, with both sides quick on the trigger. 
In the bloodiest clash so far this year, 10 extremists and one policeman were killed Wednesday, and 11 militants and 10 policemen were wounded. 
The extremist al-Gamaa al­Islamiya -the Islamic Group ­in 1981 launched its drive to install an Islamic government. Fueled by suspicions that they will receive no mercy, the ex­tremists ,have resisted gov­ernment raids. 
"They have orders to fire on police. We fire back. Sometimes one or two get killed," said Maj. Gen. Galal el-Shamy, an Interior Ministry spokesman. He said the militants would rather die fighting than be arrested.

Egyptian police, extremists clash 
Egyptian Human Rights Orga­nization. 
There are about 200,000 Muslim fundamentalists in Egypt, according to estimates by Western diplomats speaking 
on condition of anonymity, and about 10,000 of them are in­volved in militant groups. 
In 1992, 80 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in an intensified terror campaign against tourism, Egypt's largest source of foreign exchange. 
This year, 51 people have been killed. The victims include Coptic Christians and foreign tourists. 
Last week, eight extremists and a policeman died and 35 people were wounded in an at­tack on an extremist-held mosque in the southern city of Aswan. A bomb damaged six empty buses outside Cairo's Egyptian Antiquities Museum on Tuesday. 
The latest deaths occurred Wednesday in Assiut, an ex­tremist stronghold in southern Egypt. 
Police surrounded two apartment buildings, and when the extremists inside refused to surrender, stormed the build­ings.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Hispanics frequently ignored 
Dear Editor: 
Recently at Notre Dame, there has been a renewed discussion concerning cultural diversity. I have read many letters in The Observer and overheard discussions between individuals concerning this very important issue on campus and in society. However, every single time cultural diversity is discussed at Notre Dame, it has been an issue of black and white, the two traditional different ethnic groups in the United States. What about Hispanics? Where do we fit in this discussion? Why are we overlooked? 
By the year 2000, Hispanics will probably become the single largest minority group in the United States. With currently 25 million living in the United States, Hispanics comprise a large part of society. The His­panic population of N.D. grows every year and is the largest of any national minority group here on campus. However, though we are a large diversi­fied community comprised of peoples of different races and economic status, we are, in American society and Notre Dame, overlooked. 
There are no Hispanics in the 
U.S. Senate and in every level of government, we are far from getting the representation equal to our numbers. In Notre Dame, there are no Hispanic rectors and few in either the faculty or the administration, even though Hispanics comprise over 50 percent of American Catholics: the majority aren't Irish or Italian but Hispanic. The goal of economic empowerment is far from sight. 
For example, over 40 percent of Puerto Ricans living in Amer­ica do so in poverty. Hispanics 
DOONESBURY 
are faced with racism derived from cultural ignorance. Here at N.D., I've heard comments from acquaintances such as "Well, he doesn't look His­panic!" and the like whenever Hispanic issues are brought up. Why is it we are faced with this here at Notre Dame? 
One reason that is easily seen at N.D. is apathy within the community. Many students, administrators, and faculty simply could not care less whether or not American mi­norities are facing injustice, racism, or oppression in Amer­ica or whether or not here at 
N.D. the topic of cultural diver­sity should even be discussed. Within the Hispanic community at N.D., there is apathy. Many Hispanics do not discuss cul­tural diversity as African­Americans have and have not made the Hispanic presence known on campus. 
How can we correct this prob­lem facing Hispanics at N.D.? I think a key element that we, as Hispanics, can do is to change our approach to discussing such issues at N.D. In the past, I feel that the leadership of the Hispanic groups on campus has not made addressing issues of cultural diversity or awareness the goals of their organizations. As the new president of the Hispanic American Organiza­tion, I have made it one of our top goals to ensure that as His­panics, our concerns and needs are addressed and discussed by the administration and the stu­dent body. 
Along with the other officers in the H.A.O., I have initiated Project Vision, an innovative approach to nurturing a spirit of multiculturalism at N.D. In H.A.O., we will be working on trying to attain better financial aid for Hispanic students by so­liciting help from national His­panic organizations and profes­sional societies. 
We will be inviting numerous Hispanic scholars, academics, politicians, artists, and social workers to open the eyes of Notre Dame's non-Hispanics to what it means to be Hispanic in the U.S. today. Through cook­outs, dinners, and dances, we will provide all students with a taste of the wide array of His­panic cultures, ranging from Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Mexico. 
To ensure recruitment of Hispanics to N.D., we will hopefully conclude the estab­lishment of the N.D. Hispanic Alumni Association. This will also serve as another link be­tween Notre Dame and the various Hispanic communities around the nation. We will work closely with the growing Hispanic community of South Bend. Those of us here at N.D. are fortunate while many of our brothers and sisters in this country have so little. We must be cognizant of this fact and work to ensure a brighter fu­ture for all Hispanics in Michi­ana and make our presence known here at Notre Dame. 
I ran on the platform that we, as Hispanics, have to take the initiative to make sure our needs are met at N.D. and that the campus community does not spend another year without any major event to heighten Hispanic awareness. We have to reaffirm our culture: it's our responsibility to keep our tradi­tions alive. The apathy that has plagued our organization and the Hispanic community of N.D.

Roller coaster ride of 1968 was not terrible for some 

America in need of industrial policy 
I was taken by surprise, re­cently, when I was talking about 1968 with an acquaintance, and he said, "Boy, that was a terrible year!" 
Some terrible things hap­pened, certainly, and we knew they were terrible at the time, but somehow, I never thought of the second semester of my freshman year, which began with the Tet Offensive and ended with the murder of Bobby Kennedy, as a terrible time. 
Actually, it was pretty excit­ing. It was like being at the scene of an accident: Some people stand around being sen­sitively horrified but, for those who pitch in and do what needs to be done, the immediacy of the situation overwhelms its horror. Not only are you being more useful, but there is an intoxicating kick of adrenalin to be had, as well. 
Well, the spring semester 25 years ago was one long, horrific accident, and the adrenalin never stopped pumping. Tet was the two-by-four-between­the-eyes, the wake-up call that told Americans we were fight­ing an enemy that wasn't going to give up, no matter how many of their young men and our young men were killed in the struggle. 
The battle raged throughout South Vietnam, but especially in the city of Hue, where some 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, and, most shockingly, at the US Embassy in Saigon, where the embassy staff carne under fire as enemy soldiers swarmed through the compound. Analysts agreed that 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
the communists lost the battle, but all we won was the opportunity to have another 30,000 young men killed over the next five years. 
It was terrible news. But you must understand: We were more distracted the week be­fore, when the North Dining hall served tainted beef in the middle of finals week, turning a normally tense time into a Pandemonium of violent diar­rhea and vomiting throughout the North Quad. In revenge, there was a food riot, und~r the slogan "Better Food or Bigger Johns." 
How do the two events corn­pare? Well, whether it is a no­ble sentiment or not, things that happen to other people are not as bad as things that happen to you. I wept that I had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet. Then I stopped crying, but I still wanted some shoes. 
The other thing to realize is that the horrific events weren't necessarily seen at the time as they are seen today. When Martin Luther King was killed, 

Pete Peterson 
Beyond Freedom Rock 
the shocking thing was that it was Martin Luther King and not Huey Newton or Stokely Carmichael. King was loved and revered, but as an elder statesman still preaching pas­sive resistance in an age of Black Power, not as someone on the cutting edge of the revo­lution, and certainly not as a logical target for assassination. 
Like the attempted assassina­tion of John Paul II, the shock was in how pointless it seemed to be, to shoot such a nice guy. It wasn't that we felt we could not move forward without him. 
And then there was Bobby. I've heard it said that the Chicago Convention might have been riot-free if Bobby had Jived to take the nomination, but I don't recall the antiwar movement having much faith in him. Bobby was a preppie opportunist who jumped into the race once Gene McCarthy had done all the work, and he was embraced, for the most part, by those who would have protested the war if they weren't afraid it might ruin their chances of getting into law school. 
Still, the killings sent a mes­sage, because both Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy represented what our elders kept advising us to do: Work within the system. Genteel dissent, turning the other cheek, working for change was preferable to shouting and threatening and marching. The moment LBJ announced the bombing halt and his decision not to seek reelection, our lib­eral friends began telling us to stop demonstrating, because the president needed our sup­port to bring about peace. 
But four days after LBJ's speech, Martin Luther King was dead. Bobby Kennedy died less than eight weeks later. They both followed the rules, they both worked within the system. Working within the system began to look to a lot of young people like some bullshit. 
And I guess that, if 1968 were a terrible year, it would be for that reason: I think many of us carne out of that semester with the clear message that the system was not for us, that we were cogs in a machine that was not only out of our control, but was working against our best interests. 
But it wasn't a bad year. It was an exciting time to be at a point in our lives where we had the freedom to just jump in and get involved in all this amazing stuff. 
A couple of years ago, I inter­viewed Arlo Guthrie, and he mentioned the number of peo­ple at his concerts who were too young to remember "Alice's Restaurant" the first time around, but who know and re­quest it. What he suggested was that, 25 years from now, middle-aged people in Eastern Europe, in Hussia, in China, will sit around talking about the days when they were young, and when amazing stuff was happening in their countries. 
I'm sure he was right. And maybe some Russian will say, "Our monetary system had collapsed. There were short­ages of everything. We had vio­lent ethnic fighting everywhere. It was a terrible time." 
But another will smile, and say, "That's funny. I never thought of it as terrible."

the United States so that we can once again dominate world commerce. 
What can we consumers do in the meantime? We can start by supporting ·our own industries and establishments by buying and shopping American. The book The Patriotic Consumer: How to Buy American can show you how. For nearly every kind of product, it tells you which ones are American and which ones aren't so that you can make the right choice every time you shop. We need to start shopping by country of origin rather than just price tag. We need everyone's three favorite words to become "Made in USA." 
However, the trade and cur­rent account deficits are again rising and foreign lobbyists are flooding America trying to pre­vent us from recovering. Time is of the essence and the Clinton Administration needs to implement a new policy now before anymore of the triumphs of our grandfather's are mortgaged overseas, before there are more Allen towns, South Bends and Detroits. 
There is another book out 
called IBM vs. Japan which could accurately describe the global computer struggle in the 70s and 80s. I guess you've heard of IBM's recent record losses and layoffs. A lot of their present problems stern from the fact that they've had to expend so many resources trying to maintain a slim lead over the entire Japanese computer in­dustry which works hand-in­hand with the Japanese gov­ernrnent. Cray SuperComputers is having similar difliculties. All too often lone U.S. companies must take on whole foreign industries, backed up by their government. Who's destined to win? 
As for negotiating an end to our trade problems with Japan, during talks in 1987, the U.S. asked Japan for the same rights in Japan granted to the Japanese in the U.S. A leading Japanese negotiator replied, "What the United States is ask­ing for is impossible." I guess that about sums it up. 
Jeffrey O'Donnell Grace Hall March 14, 1993 

Dear Editor: 
In case you missed it while enjoying spring break, last week Secretary of Commerce Hon Brown announced the merger of General Motors, Unisys, Raytheon, Chase Man­hattan Bank, Travelers Insur­ance Company and DuPont into the American Trading Company (ATC). 
The idea is modelled on the Japanese Keiretsu system of in­terlocking companies such as the Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Sanwa groups. These Keiretsu are vast corporate groups built around a bank and containing 10 to 20 other companies in au­tomobiles, chemicals, finance, mining, forestry, aerospace and just about every other economic field. 
Mitsubishi motors is only the seventh largest member of the Mitsubishi Keiretsu. The ad­vantages of this system are many, but there are two pri­mary ones. First, any group member can receive low-cost loans and investment capital from the banking affiliate, and second, cheap, guaranteed supplies and transportation can be had from any group member. Also, operating as a unit allows streamlining and standardizing of a wide-range of administrative and industrial facets. All of these things greatly enhance Japan's ability to compete in the global mar­ket. 
Secretary Brown said that such a drastic move was neces­sary to effectively compete with systems like Japan's and hoped to have a total of four such ATCs in place by the end of the year to counter Japan's six conglomerates. The shared re­search and development, cheaper financing and supply costs and the presentation of a unified front in the face of in­creasingly stiff, subsidized for­eign competition (which also includes Korean Keiretsu such as Hyundai and Daewoo as well as Airbus) should help America adjust to the more protectionist . global economy. 
When asked if he thought that this might provoke a trade war with one or more nations, Secretary Brown answered that the possibility had been examined, but that the expected benefits outweighed any such problems. As the expected global protests and lobbying ef­forts began to come in, Secre­tary Brown emphasized that "The United States is sending a clear message to the rest of the world that we will no longer sit back while subsidized and pro­tected competition undermines and eliminates our industries and economy." 
Unfortunately, the ATCs and Secretary Brown's speech were fictitious. The Keiretsu of Japan, of course, are not. Doesn't it make sense therefore that we should have a system that can effectively take on Japan's? Can America afford to be the only major nation with­out an industrial policy? Very similar suggestions are con­tained in the book How to Beat the Japanese at their Own Game. Honald Reagan and Ge­orge Bush refused to even consider such proposals in def­erence to Adam Smith's ghost. 
Bill Clinton has promised an industrial policy, but except for his visit to a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, he has I

understands and actively en­courages the centrality of do­rnestic industry in our economy. The government needs to set priorities for key technologies and provide funds, facilities and expertise to ensure the actual growth of these areas. Industrial policy succeeds as shown by the phenomenal tri­urnphs of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Indus­try, the astounding growth of Europe's Airbus and the bur­geoning economies of the Little Tigers (South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan). 
That it can work in America is evidenced by Senatech, a gov­ernrnent-sponsored consortium of several of the nation's leading semi-conductor manufacturers. Now for the first time in a decade, America is the world's number one semi-conductor maker. America can still compete which can be seen in our recent overtaking of Japan and Europe in the field of High Definition televisions with some of the world's most advanced digital technology. Our gov­ernrnent must give our busi­nesses the same advantages given foreign companies abroad

Saturday's celebration of 'Women's CollegeAppreciation Day is an attempno e:reate this awareness. 
Sponsored by the StudentLeague for Women's Colleges, the day will indude music, di~ussion and lectures with the goal of brlnging about pride and awareness of the· benefits of women's lnstitutions, according to Kathy Roe, league vice president and one of the coordinators of the event. 
The Student League for Women's Colleges originated last year as a group of women who were concerned with the future ofwomen's colleges, according t? Martha M~zolf,l>resident ... .·.· 
The idea came from a conference thatM,aureen Lowery; 1991~92 stu,de11thodypresidl:)nt. attended, in which two women from Regis College in Massachusetts spoke oftb~ir efforts to begin an organization in which women's colleges could communicate with one ano~er. 
At the start of this year Marzolf said she tried to further this idea of a ntltlonal orgaruzation with lo­cal chapters at each women's college, but she realized that the idea was 11()1 feasible at this time. She said that first the chapters need to start atthe campus leveL

creased opportunities for women, they still need an education to break into the traditionally male-dominated world. 
"You can provide more oppor­tunity, but without women's edu­cation to put women in leading roles you are not better fulfilling the needs of women in this country, and how can men know the needs of women or how to fulfill them," she said. 
The need for women's colleges today is not an argument against coeducation, rather it is an argument for an alternative option in education for women. 
White said that while he believes there are many strong women and men at coeducational institutions it is easier for them to blend in if they choose to. In an envi­ronment like Saint Mary's, though, this is more difficult . 
"A women's college goes be­yond small and friendly, because we challenge students in a sup­portive environment," he said. "The issue (at a women's college) is not that you don't have to compete with men, but the issue is that you have to assume responsibility and accept the challenge." 
"Here we insist that students 
see the possibilities open for 
them. My colleagues at other 
coed institutions often only see 
the feeling, barriers and 
obstacles (to women's 
education), here we help them 
break through the feelings, 
barriers and obstacles," he 
added. 
Nicosia said that while 
women's colleges are not for 
everyone, she feels that the 
education is tailored to the 
needs of women. 
"Professors stress that women 
are very important in society," 
she said. 
The choice to attend a 
women's college was not a 
conscious one for many. Instead, 
they said they were first 
attracted by the small liberal 
arts atmosphere, but once there, 
they realized the value of a 
women's education at a women's 
college. 
"When I was looking at 
schools, I just happened to look 
at women's colleges and that is a 
consensus of most of my friends 
here," said Olsen. "I wasn't sure 
how it would be different until I 
was actually here." 
Mary Barger, a Le Mans 
senior, said that with two older 
sisters attending Saint Mary's 
she was attracted by the all 
women's aspect of the school 
along with other fringe benefits 
of Saint Mary's. 
"I didn't choose Saint Mary's 
solely because it was an all 
women's college, but that was 
an added benefit," said Barger. 
"Being here has bolstered a lot 
of feminist issues and 
strengthened my belief in them." 
In the 1960s there were 228 women's colleges in the country. Today, though, that number has dwindled to 84 colleges located in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Proponents of women's colleges say that espe­cially in light of the recent studies and statistics, women's colleges must work to promote themselves so that the number of institutions does not decrease any further.

"To be 5-4 on the road in this league and 4-5 at home is very unusual for us. That was prob­ably the most frustrating part for our staff this year," said Keady. 
''I'm sure our players aren't old enough to understand this yet, but we don't take advan­tage of our home-court situa­tion and we don't come out and get after folks. So there was not an edge there this year, that's for sure." 
Southeast Regional 
With only 2,300 students to its name, the University of Evansville realizes its basket­ball team will be an underdog Thursday against Florida State. 
The Seminoles (22-9) enter the first-round NCAA Tourna­ment game ranked 11th na­tionally and seeded third in the Southeast Regionals in Orlando, Fla., a short road trip from Florida State's campus in Tallahassee. 
Evansville, which came nowhere near the Top 25 this year, is seeded 14th among the 16 teams in the region. The Aces (23-6) landed in the NCAA Tournament instead of the NIT by upsetting Xavier in the Mid­western Collegiate Conference tournament. 
So how does a scrappy crowd of overachievers hope to match up with a talent-rich team led by two-sport star Charlie Ward? 
First, they pay no attention to the polls, the seeds or the press clippings about celebrity oppo­nents. 
"We never talked about the seeds at all," said Scott Shref­fler, a fifth-year senior who is part of his third NCAA Tour­nament team at Evansville. 
West Regional 
As Vanderbilt coach Eddie Fogler studied videotapes of Boise State, the image of Tonoka Beard grew larger and larger. 
The 6-foot-10, 245-pounder may be the Broncos' best hope against the eighth-ranked Commodores in Thursday's NCAA West Regional first-round matchup. 
"Tonoka Beard is an out­standing center, a senior four­year starter, very quick and strong -a heck of a player," Fogler said Wednesday. 
Beard's 21.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game aside, No. 8 Vanderbilt (26-5) is expected to have little trouble with Boise State (21-7). 
Santa Clara (18-11) plays No. 
5 Arizona (24-3) and Temple 
(17-12) plays Missouri (19-13).

This is the first appearance for New Mexico in the Blue-Gray, which is the same situation Notre Dame was in last season.

way, averaging 20.2 points per game. 
"It doesn't take much to real­ize we're in deep water," Boise State coach Bobby Dye said. "You're talking about one of the power conferences in the United States." 
The Broncos finished second to Idaho during the Big Sky's regular season, but defeated the Vandals 80-68 last weekend for the league tourney crown and automatic NCAA berth.

Cincinnati, Arizona and Vanderbilt, who sit quietly in the shadows, waiting to pounce on some unsuspecting favorite. 
History seems to be on Indi­ana's side this year. Bob Knight has never gone more than six years without a championship, and his last title came in 1987. That year the Final Four was in New Orleans and the Hoosiers came out of the Midwest Region. Same scenario this year. 
Ranked No. 1 in the season's final poll. the Hoosiers carry the favorite's label with an as­terisk. Sophomore Alan Hen­derson missed the last month of the season with a knee injury. If he is unable to return, Indiana will return to Bloom­ington early. 
North Carolina faces similar difficulties. Point guard Derrick Phelps injured his back in the ACC tournament and his status is questionable for the tourna­ment. The Tar Heels' chances are questionable without him. 
Michigan should return to the Final Four to give the Fab Five a chance to win their first. 
They could run into a road­block in Georgia Tech if the Yellow Jackets play as well as they did in the ACC Tourna­ment, but that is unlikely from a team who lost 10 regular sea­son games. 
Farther down the road a date with Vanderbilt or Arizona awaits, but neither team has the tournament experience or the raw talent to handle the Wolverines.

slug it out for the Southeast Regional title. Both teams have had their ups and downs this year, but both have all the weapons to make a serious run at the title. 
The tactical matchup between Rick Pitino and P.J. Carlisimo is enough to make it one of the best games of the tournament. 
But those marqee matchups are still a few miles down the road. 
Today all the hype and expec­tation will end and the games will begin. All the speculation becomes meaningless. Game plans are in place and nothing matters other than what hap­pens on the court. 
A sea of questions will be an­swered before the crowning moment on April 5, but regard­less of who emerges from the clutter as college basketball's best of 1993, one question will remain.

SMC softball wins four during break 
By BETH REGAN Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
The Belles had a successful first week of games in Orlando, Florida over Spring Break. They finished the week with a 4-3 record winning the last three games. 
"We improved each day we were down there," said Coach Don Cromer. "We have a lot of young players and this week gave them the opportunity to Don Cromer gel." 

The Belles did not lose heart after a disappointing first day losing to Alvernia College. The team also scrimmaged Grand Rapids Community College the same day, which allowed

The Belles got a taste of vic­tory the following day by defeating Anderson University, although they lost to top-ranked Saint Norbert College later that afternoon. 
"Anderson was an important win," said junior Sara Miller. "We will play them later in the season and we hit well against their pitcher."

The Belles dominated against Ithaca College, Point Park Col­lege and trounced undefeated Loras College in their final day of games. 
"I think that these games helped us a lot," said freshman Tina Brockman. "We played well together after we got the kinks out." "Loras was by far our best game," said Miller. "We started the week off slowly, but man­aged to pull togethnr in the end." 
"We should have a successful season if we can get into a rhythm." added Miller.

College basketball's next dynasty? Don't close the book on the last one, says Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. "People are waiting to close the chapter," Krzyzewski said as he prepared his Blue Devils for their NCAA opener 
... 
Illinois tonight in defense of their national championship crown. 

on Thursday night. "What we have to try to do is use that to our advantage, don't let anybody close any darn chapters on us. This is our time." 
Of course, Krzyzewski also realizes his Blue Devils are not as powerful as in the last two seasons, when they won the national championship. 
While the Blue Devils have plenty of postseason experience with star players like Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill and Thomas Hill, who have two championship rings each, Krzyzewski said his 1992-93 team has been more apprehensive at times. 
"They are more easily distracted than my last two teams," Krzyzewski said. "They might be distracted by a performance of a player against them ... it knocks them back. A call, or if they miss a couple of shots. In some games that will impact on them more than we would like . 
"This team gets along great, but that's what we mean by maturity. It has nothing to do with something like 'you stole my towel and I'm mad at you for life.' " 
The Blue Devils have lost seven games, including four since Feb. 13, and questions surround Grant Hill's effectiveness. While they're favored to beat Southern Illinois in a Midwest Regional opener in Rosemont, Ill., on Thursday, the Blue Devils (23-7) are 10-to~ 1 to make it three in a row.

Purdue certainly doesn't mind a first-round NCAA as­signment far from home. The road has been friendlier to the No. 22 Boilermakers than their home arena for most of the season, anyway. "It's one of those things where it's certainly been the trend," said coach Gene Keady. see NCAA's /page 13

Familiar sound opens a wide open NCAA tourney 
When the drumroll ceases and the first jump ball is tossed this afternoon, 64 college bas­ketball teams will begin the quest for the 1993 national championship. 
The steady beat of the drum has been building since the pairings were announced last Sunday as fans, players, and coaches swell with anticipation. 
The regular season and the conference tournaments are now a distant memory. Tunnel vision is now focused on New Orleans. That is the destination of only four members the 64-team field. but it is coveted by all. 
It takes a special blend of talent, experience, coaching and luck to reach college basketball's promised land, but it promises to be an exciting ride even for the teams who stall along the way. 
Teams like Hider, Coppin State, Coastal Carolina and Wright State are just debris that

Four to make room for the real contenders. 
And this year there are many. 
Indiana, North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan, Kansas and Duke have each held the No. 1 ranking at some point this season. And every member of that group except Kentucky has been to the Final Four at least once in the last two years.

When the Notre Dame women's tennis team takes to the courts of Eck Pavilion today against Illinois, it will be fighting to keep its undefeated record intact. 
Although the Irish are 6-6 indual match play this season, their record is 2-0 versus Midwest Hegion teams. A win against the Lady Illini would push them 
one step closer to·

South Florida. In order to beat the Illini, Jay Louderback though, the Irish will need to return to the form which helped them to a 5-4 upset of 19th-ranked Kansas over Spring Break. "Illinois recently beat a good Northwestern squad," said Irish coach Jay Louderback. "That puts them in contention with the other top teams in the region [Notre Dame, Wisconsin, and Indiana)." The Irish have already defeated Northwestern earlier this season in Evanston, 6-3. Their other in-region victory was an 8-1 drubbing of Wisconsin in Madison. As in their upset over Kansas, Notre Dame may need strong play from its lower-seeded players in order to overcome Illinois' power at the upper

seeds. 
"Their number-one player [Lindsey Nimmo] will be very tough," said Louderback. "She's ranked fourteenth in the country." 
Notre Dame's highest ranked player in the International Tennis Association's most recent ratings is freshman Wendy Crabtree at No. 55. 
Crabtree lost 3-6, 4-6 to Nimmo earlier this season at the Eck Invitational, but she looks forward to today's rematch. 
"I think she [Nimmo] played well in the Eck Invitational, and I don't think I had my best match," said Crabtree. "It will be good to get another shot at her." 
For upperclassmen on the Irish squad, today's match will be a chance for another shot at the entire Illinois team. Notre Dame was defeated by the Illini last year. 
"I think with South Florida we may have overlooked them," said Crabtree. "But with Illinois, even though they're not ranked we know this is a match we can't joke about. Just the revenge factor is enough for us to get up for. 
"Hopefully we got our bad match out of the way. Our practices since the South Florida match have gone well and everyone's worked hard-that points to our mental focus for the Illinois match." 
A win over the Illini today would help the Irish as they enter a busy weekend schedule that includes home matches against Drake, Michigan, and Kansas State.

The Notre Dame men's tennis team hit the road once again yesterday, as they will clash with New Mexico this afternoon in the first round of the prestigious Blue-Gray National Classic in Montgomery, Alabama. 
The match is yet another against an opponent ranked in the top-25, as New Mexico moved up from 24th to 19th in the latest Intercollegiate Tennis Rankings. But that is nothing new for the road weary Irish, as they have already faced ten such teams, including five teams ranked among the top five in the nation. 
"It really makes a difference when there's not any easy matches," said Irish head coach Bob Bayliss, "But all you can do is play your best and learn how to absorb the losses. It's just a matter of how much your ego can take." 
Even though the Irish have not done as well as expected with the nation's toughest schedule, they have gotten their share of wins against top 25 foes, including wins against No. 20 Minnesota, No. 13 Texas, No. 27 Arizona State, and they suffered narrow losses to No. 6 North Carolina and No. 12 Kentucky. 
The Irish will be looking for a couple more quality wins this weekend, as they head to Alabama for a tournament they finished fifth in last season, posting a 2-1 record including with wins over Oklahoma State and Drake last year. The fifth-ranked Irish were bounced out of the tourney by 13th-ranked Florida. 
Last year 12 out of the 16 teams in the tournament were ranked in the top and the Irish expect another toug challenge from the Lobos in the fi round. The Irish are familiar with N

Mexico, as they have prepared for them before. The Irish expected to play New Mexico in the championship of the Ice Volleys tournament in Minnesota earlier this year, but the Lobos lost to unranked San Diego in the first round and the Irish captured the title.
