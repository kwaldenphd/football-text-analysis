Glory days of high school athletics fondly remembered 
One thing I never will forget is the pain I felt as I walked off the field after my last high school football game. 
I am not talking about any type of physical pain, but rather, an indescribable anguish which stemmed from the realization I probably never would play in another football game in my life. Many people may not be able to understand the way I felt, but to me, the end ofa 12-year football career was a bit traumatic. 
When I arrived at Notre Dame last year, I kept meeting hoatds ofpeople who all were ex-high school athletes. They came in different shapes and sizes but were held together by a common bond of their past · the high school athlete who did not have the talent or size to participate on the level of varsity athletics that Notre Dame boasts. 
So here we all were, after the smoke ofmoving in and getting situated had cleared, left to regale each other with mountains of stories about past high school ath· letic achievement and fame. 
No matter who told the story or what sport he played, the storyteller al· ways made sure to hit the highpoints of his career. In fact, I don't believe I've ever heard a person tell about fumbling the ball in a crucial game or striking out when he was at bat. Regardless of the story, the teller always seems to be the hero. 
Believe me, I am not placing myself above this mass of story-telling ex· athletes; as a matter offact, I may be one ofthe worst. 
I never seem to let the sour points of my career slip out unless I make it seem like a joke. By trivializingthe valleys in my performance on the football field, I do come off as trying to act humble, but fail to let my compeers realize how much ofa klutz I actually was in a helmet and shoulder pads. 
By no means do I feel badly about making myself out to be some kind of great athlete · because there is no one around here from my hometown who is able to contradict me. In other words, in the next three years if I can manage to keep my friends and relatives from pop­ping up and o Jening their mouths, I have it made in the shade. 
just because I said I was one ofthe worst ofthe some­what "tall tale tellers" does not mean I was the worst. For example, I often used to exchange stories late into the evening with an ex-soccer player from Pittsburgh whom I will call John. No matter what story someone would tell, john always had a better one. 
Noticing this trend in his one-better-than-you yarns. I attempted to make it impossible for him to top one of

my stories. 

I let rip with astory about our football team having to run up and down a steep levee in full football gear with the mercury around 100 degrees and the humidityat 99 percent. Needless to say, his soccer team had to sprint up and down the treacherous Alleghenies every day before practice. There just is no beating some people. 
Actually, I do not mind listening to all the stories my friends have to tell me. I never get tired ofhearing about my roommates' excellent wrestling career or of anot· 
her one of my friend's tennis exploits. I guess it's neces­sary to sit back and listen to people relive their past. 
I think I would go crazy if my roommate were to turn a deaf ear to all the stories, I have told him. In a way we are helping each other by turning memories that are potentially painful into stories meant to impress and beguile others. 
Even though I am playing interhall football this year and my friends are par· ticipating in various other sports, the feeling just is not the same. Although interhall is fun, there is not the same feeling and spirit in interhall 

sports as there was in high school. The comradeship and the great moments we experienced in high school never will be relived by us ex-high school jocks. 
So we all sit around and dream about past glories and conquests. We talk about how good it would feel to be back in high school and to don the old uniform. 
There is something inside that will not let us forget the times when we were once great athletic heroes · at least in our own minds. 
Thankstoyou... itworks...

Album warning label discussion continues 
ByROBPRICE 
News Staff 
PARENTAL GUIDANCE: EX­
PUCIT LYRICS. 
This warning label will appear on selected albums of 19 major record companies as a result of pressure from the Parents' Music Resource Center, a Washington-based group whose members are wives of legis­lators and other public officials. 
The group's purpose is to make parents more aware of albums whose lyrics deal with sex, violence, drugs and alcohol, or satanism. A record-rating system, similar to the one presently being used for movies, also is suggested by the PMRC. 
Although public opinion varies, at least one group openly opposes the attempts made by the PMRC. The Musical Majority, made up of artists, managers, publishers, broadcasters and others in the music business, does not want albums rated and is concerned the PMRC has too much political clout. 
"The rating ofrecords will do not­hing but impose a sense of censor­ship on the creative community," said Danny Goldberg, chairman of the Musical Majority and president of Gold Mountain Records. 
The proposed record-rating sys­tem also has stirred opinions at Notre Dame. 
Ron Mileti, chairman of the musi­cal entertainment committee of the Student Activities Board, said he hesitantly endorses a rating system as long as it does not cause the artist to restrict his creativity. 
Father George Wiskirchen, music professor and assistant director of 
the Notre Dame band, said he 
believes rating records is an accep­
table idea. He said, however, it 
would be difficult to do because of 
people's different moral bases. 
"And how do you define 
'obscene'?"Wiskirchen asked. 
Both Mileti and Wiskirchen agree 
rating records is not a form of cen­
sorship. Wiskirchen noted, "It can't 
be censorship because it does not 
prohibit production of records." He 
added, however,"It is a dangerous 
first step towards censorship." 
Kevin Purcell, a Notre Dame 
senior, said he strongly opposes a 
rating system because it is a form of 
censorship. He said, "Music has al· 
ways been a form of expression, like 
poetry. Nobody rates poems, do 
they?" 
The issue ofwho is responsible for censoring the music children listen to, parents or the record industry, is also controversial. 
Tom Klein, president of Spiritual Rock, said he believes children don't understand the lyrics of rock songs. "For the most part, they don't listen to the lyrics, they are attracted to the image the group projects," he said. 
Purcell disagreed with Klein, and said he thinks children do under­stand the lyrics. Anyway, he said,"Children can hear the music on the radio even if their parents won't let them buy the album." 
Wisk.irchen said the issue doesn't concern him too much. He said only a small number of people are at· tracted to the "cults" formed by the music and that it is only temporary. 

Greenpeace explosion blame given to Hernu 
A.s8oclated Press 
PARIS · Prime Minister Laurent 
Fabius on Wednesday blamed 
former Defense Minister Charles 
Hernu and the former secret service 
chief for the bombing of a Green­
peace ship Rainbow Warrior. 
Fabius said it was difficult to 
determine specifically who gave the 
order to sink the ship July 10 at its 
berth in Auckland, New Zealand, be­
cause "there was no written order." 
He said he questioned Hernu and secret service chief Adm. Pierre Lacoste Wednesday afternoon. 
"My conviction is that both of them acted under the impulse of their owri. idea ofwhat was in the in­terest of our country," he said. "My conviction is that it is at their level where the responsibility lies." 
Lacoste was fired last week for refusing to answer questions about the sinking, and Hernu, who had ul­timate responsibility for the secret service, resigned. 
On Sunday, Fabius announced that the secret service carried out the bombing on government orders but did not say who was responsible. 
Speaking during his weekly televi­sion appearance, Fabius said, "In a democracy like ours, the respon· sibility for this kind of decision is borne by the civilian authorities · that is to say the minister (Hernu )." 
Some news reports have said military subordinates carried out the attack either because they misin­terpreted orders or because some right-wing elements in the army wanted to embarrass the Socialist government. 
The Rainbow Warrior was prepar­ing to lead a protest flotilla to France's South Pacific testing grounds for nuclear weapons. 
One theory holds that Hernu gave an oral order to Lacoste to "take care of' the Greenpeace protest, and Lacoste interpreted it as an instruc­tion to sink the ship. 
A greenpeace photographer was 
killed in the bombing. 
Earlier Wednesday, the govern­
ment named army chiefofstaff Gen. 
Rene Imbot to replace Lacoste as 
head of the General Directorate for 
External Security, France's secret 
service. 
The Cabinet ordered lmbot, 60, a 
Foreign Legion veteran, to clean up 
the agency and report fully on its 
role in the bombing. 
The authoritative daily Le Monde 
quoted sources close to Fabius as 
saying the premier wanted Hernu to 
admit his role publicly, even ifthere 
had been "slippage" between his or­
der to "anticipate" Greenpeace ac­
tions and the actual bombing. 
Three military men have been 
arrested and two are being sought 
for questioning in connection with 
leaks of information about the scan· 
dal to the news media. Authorities 
said the arrests were made on in­
formation from new Defense Mini­
ster Paul Quiles. 
Francis Szpiner, an attorney, said one of those sought was Capt. Paul Barril, well known in France, who was transferred from a special anti­terrorist unit in 1983 after inves­tigators said he manufactured evidence against three purported Irish terrorists. The three later were· cleared. 
Szpiner said Barril was "at the dis­position of judicial authorities" but would not say where he was. Le Monde said he was not in France. 
Le Monde charged the arrests were an attempt "to intimidate the press ... and hamper its investigative work." It said if convicted on charges of leaking state secrets, in­formers could face a 20-year jail. term and journalists who used their information could be jailed for five to 10years. 
In its meeting Wednesday, the Cabinet also retired Lacoste from active military service.

North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin declared a state of impending dis­aster for 27 counties and Virginia Gov. Charles Robb mobilized Na­tional Guardsmen to help with evacuations. 
At the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay, mailboats were pressed into service, along with police and Coast Guard vessels, to ferry about half the residents of Smith Island. 
Classes were canceled in North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland as schools were turned into evacuation centers, and hundreds of military airplanes and helicopters and dozens of ships set sail from their home bases to protect them from the storm. 
People fled their homes as far north as Fire Island, which runs the southern coast of New York's Long Island. But others who planned to stay home stocked up on food, bat­teries and candles, boarded up win· dows and set up sandbags to guard against floodwaters. 
At 9 p.m. EDT yesterday, the center of Gloria was near latitude 
33.5 north, longitude 76.0 west, 140 miles south of Cape Hatteras, moving nonh at 20 mph. The storm's forward motion was ex­pected to accelerate, and a hur· ricane watch was issued from Plymouth to Eastport, Maine, in ad· ditionto the hurricane warning. 

Charges of South African police brutality made by young woman 
Tuesday morning under the Internal Security Act. 
She belongs to the Western Cape Student Action Committee anti· apartheid group and said she was picked up at a roadblock on her way to a rally, apparently because she carried anti-government pamphlets. 
She said she was struck repeatedly until a senior police officer, whom she identified only as Steenkamp, arrived from Cape Town. The other officers then became courteous and apologetic, she said. 
A police spokesman at national headquarters in Pretoria said he could not comment on the com­plaint, but that all people with al­legations ofpolice misconduct were urged to file sworn affidavits and bring charges. 
He said all complaints were thoroughly investigated. 
She said she was released Wednes­day afternoon after being treated Qy a district surgeon, then was taken home by police. Her lawyer, Nadeem Human, said he would bring assault charges. 

Senate requests AIDS funding 
AMoclated Press . QueenMown in eastern Cape 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa· A 1 7 -year-old girl ofmixed race whose face was bruised and swollen said yesterday that five officers, behaving like "real animals," beat her for no reason in a Cape Town police sta­tion. 

The charges came the day after a judge barred policemen from as­saulting prisoners in two other Cape Province cities, Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, where other allegations of brutality have been made during more than a year of protest against white-minority rule. 
Cape Town police said they fired on a crowd from which a gasoline bomb was thrown at a police station, killing a 15-year-old black youth. A policeman in the Ciskei tribal homeland shot and killed a black man who was in a threatening mob, authorities there said. 
Police headquarters reported a dozen riot incidents during the day, mainly rock-throwing and arson, and said 45 black men were arrested for "public violence" in Province. 
Finance Minister Barend du Ples­sis said in Pretoria that a leading Swiss banker, Fritz Leutwiler, would help the government renegotiate its foreign debt of S24 billion and major creditors had agreed to Leutwiler's role. He is former governor of the Swiss national bank and former chairman of the Bank for Interna­tional Settlements. 
Foreign banks have refused to renew loans to South Africa because of the continued uprising against apartheid, the race laws that guaran­tee privilege for the nation's five mil­lion whites and deny rights to the 24 million blacks. More than 700 blacks have been killed. 
South Africa's currency has plum­meted in value during the financial crtsts and the government postponed repayment of principal on the debt until january. 
Cheryl Phillips, who lives in the Bishop Lavis suburb of Cape Town, told a news conference five policemen beat her at the Bracken­fell police station after her detention 
and members of Rockne's last team held a reunion, placing a wreath on his grave in South Bend's Highland Cemetery. 
The premiere was an event that gathered nationwide attention. Celebrities arrived on the "Twentieth Century Limited" and "Super Chief' trains, and met in Chicago to ride to South Bend in the "Knute Rockne Special." 
In South Bend, streets were decorated, and merchants were hoping for visitors to spend almost $1 million by the end of the week. 
At Notre Dame, the Glee Club par­ticipated in a· local broadcast of the "Kate Smith Show" and dining hall chefs prepared a menu for the night's banquet, the first time women would eat in the main dining hall. 
"Anyone who wants to buy a ticket can," said Nickle. Tickets start at S25 and go as high as S500. They can be purchased by calling the Hospice of Saint Joseph County office. 



AMociated Press 

WASHINGTON Citing the growing threat of AIDS, the govern­ment's top health official said yester­day he asked the White House to approve an additional 55 percent in­crease in federal spending to combat the deadly disease. 
Dr. James Mason, acting assistant secretary for health in the Health and Human Services Department, told a Senate subcommittee he has asked the Office of Management and Budget to approve a $70 million in­crease in the administration's 1986 budget request for AIDS research. 
The increase -the second in two months -would bring spending in the fiscal year beginning next week to about S200 million, more than double the amount President Reagan asked for in his first budget proposal in February. 
The new total also would be more than three times the amount spentin 1984. 
Another witness gave the panel fresh evidence that the disease is spreading to the heterosexual population. 
"This disease is the department's number one public health priority," Mason told the Senate Appropria­tions Subcommittee on Health. "We will continue to reassess our efforts in order to make maximum progress in our fight against this disease." 
Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., the subcommittee chairman, told Mason the money would be available as soon as the administra­tion formally requests it. 
"Whatever you ask for, you got," Weicker told Mason. 
Meanwhile, a Harvard researcher cited Army studies showing that 5.4 percent of the U.S. soldiers seeking treatment for venereal disease in Berlin this june were infected with AIDS. 
Dr. William Haseltine said the sol­diers got the disease from German prostitutes, who have infection rates of 50 percent or more. And the sol­diers likely will spread the disease further, he said. 
"These aren't homosexuals," he told the subcommittee. "These aren't drug abusers. These are nor­mal, young guys who visited pros­
titutes.  Half  the  prostitutes  are  
infected,  and  these  guys  got  in­ 
fected."  

Weicker questioned whether enough soldiers were involved to draw such broad conclusions. He cited a similar study, possibly the same one, which put the infection rate at four cases of AIDS among 74 soldiers seeking treatment for VD. 
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, generally is thought to kill its victims by destroy­ing their immune system and leaving them vulnerable to secondary diseases. Haseltine said, however, that recent research indicates AIDS also causes massive brain damage that may be as serious or more serious as the immune system damage: 
The majority of its victims to date have been homosexual men, and many people identify AIDS as a disease of homosexuals. That is not correct, Haseltine said.

Fear of failure must not limit our aspirations 
"You get up again--over and over..."­Madonna. 
No -this column is not a plug for the princess of lace and bizzare boots so do not change that dial yet. I was listening to this Madonna tune the other day, though, and it really hit me. 
Carol Brown 
in these times 
It is true -you do get up again. 
Just take a moment to remenber all the 
times that things seemed hopeless. Remem­
ber that test that your entire life depended on 
-the one that was humanly impossible to pass? 
Remember that major break-up with your 
high school sweetheart or that disastrous SYR 
with your dream date? Or how about the great 
fear that many of us here shared -the fear of 
rejection by the Notre Dame Office ofAdmis­
sions. 

Now, after these "disastrous, life-ending" events have passed, how does life look? Well, ,you probably passed that "impossible" final, you have gone on living without the person you could never live without, and, if you are reading this from the South Dining Hall (no offense North), you were not denied the chance to become a Domer. 
Even ifyou had been who is to say it would have been for the worse? It is probable that you would have been just as happy or even happier participating in the collegiate life on some other campus. The point is, all things seem worse at the time they bombard you than they usually tum out to be. 
An exaggerated example of this, which all Domers can relate to, is the past two weeks of Fighting Irish football. The entire Notre Dame student body, alumni and players went from the utter despair brought on by a defeated team to the elation we all experienced after this past weekend's victory. 
Who is to say that losing that first football game was necessarily a bad thing for Notre Dame. Granted, it was definitely a letdown to start off the season with a loss, but looking on the flip side, maybe an opening loss is just the motivation the Irish need to win the rest of this fall's games-we can hope, can't we? 
This is not to suggest by any means that things always work out the way we would like them to, for to do so would not only be naive, but blatantly ridiculous. Rather, I want to remind you that we cannot see into the future and time does heal many, if not the majority, ofall wounds; there really is a silver lining be­hind the dark clouds (even in November in South Bend). 
We ought not underestimate the power of people-in body, mind and spirit. Not to sound egotistical, but we are incredible creations of God, with exceptional resiliency. We do bounce back and we are often much stronger than we give ourselves credit for. 
Since we cannot predict the future and of­ten have little control over which way our paths in life will bend, we should keep in mind, particularly in times of crisis or disap­pointment, that what may seem like the ul­timate blow in life now might ultimately tum out to be for the best. 
To those of you who find yourselves the doldrums oflife right now, this may not seem like much consolation -but step back from your problems for a moment and think... are things really that bad? How many times have you been down before and things worked themselves out? You got up again, right? 
Look around your world. We all have so much to be thankful for -so much to be happy 
about. Among many other things, we live on a 
beautiful campus, we have our minds and our 
health to be thankful for, we have friends and 
family and we have the freedom to choose 
how we want to live. 
Along these same lines we have the power to make our lives happy -to look to the future with hope and aspirations. We know that along with our desire to achieve certain goals in life comes the possibility of failure. We must not let fear offailure and disappointment limit our aspirations, however. 
We know from experience, although we of­ten seem to forget, that if we do not succeed we will "get up again" and eventually we will succeed. 
In high school, my friends and I had a saying: Everything works out in the end. I still believe this and follow it today. The message is clear and the meaning is right. 
So, next time you are feeling smothered by a dark cloud in any part ofyour life just remind yourselfthat "things can only get better."

P.O. Box Q 
Feeling of Irish Guard will never be forgotten 

DearEditor: 
I would like to discuss a feeling which could not be experienced by anyone except nine ot­her guys and myself. This feeling is only ex­perienced by marching in front of the Notre Dame Band. The band inspired me so much on the Saturday night of the Michigan State game that my heart felt like it was pumping faster than the speed oflight. I was overtaken by the noise of the crowd, the music ofthe band and the voices in my head saying "Sean, this is great!!!" I felt like I was on top of the world. I was so uplifted by the band, and I will never live this feeling down. This special feeling which I experienced on Saturday the 21st will stay close to my heart for the rest of my life. The enthusiasm surrounding me overtook me and put me in a state ofcraziness (nothing un­usual). 

 The best way to describe all my feelings is to say marching on the campus to the stadium, marching in the tunnel, marching in the stadium, and marching on the campus back to the Band Annex is heaven. This is Notre Dame, this is the Irish Guard. March and become overzealous to march all the time. 
If I had not made the Irish Guard, I never would have lived it down. These feelings I have mentioned and discussed ace very spe­cial to me, and I would like to say, "Do it up!"

Ticket prices are not the issue for Johnson 

DearEditor: 
I could not help but feel sorry after reading Joseph Pupel's and DonJohnson's letters. I do not think the price of football tickets is the issue here. What is crystal clear is that both men have a need to exert the "dominance" of the Notre Dame name that is too strong to be healthy. Being in a very intelligent community 
Doonesbury 
comprised of two well-regarded schools, like ours, it disappoints me that it has come to this. Pupel and Johnson, if you want me to cringe with hurt feelings when told "You are not NO" you will be disappointed. My friends and I are proud of Saint Mary's College. The caring faculty and staff ace genuinely interested in our search for full personhood. The small School atmosphere nurtures our senses of in­dividuality. Most importantly the many beautiful friendships we have been lucky enough to acquire are in themselves enough for us. My friends and I do not feel an in­stinctual need to play the "Anything-you-can­do-l-can-do-better" game. What a waste! Why don't we instead emphasize in our two schools shared values and friendship; this is living in a way from which all ofus can benefit.

Damage at the Grotto makes some feel lonely 
DearEditor: 
In the midst of all our complaining about "Stonehenge II," a beautiful, integral part of this campus has been damaged by fire. The Grotto, which symbolizes what this Univer­sity is all about, is now a charred, lifeless structure. It makes me sick to think of the once radiant statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary covered with black soot. 
I hope people will stop their protesting over the fountain and take time to reflect on this incident. Yes, the Grotto will be restored, candles will soon brighten dark nights, and Our Lady will once again shine. For now, though, where can we go for those precious moments of silence and meditation we all need at some time or another? For me, it has always been difficult to pray in my room (and even the hall chapel) amidst the sounds of laughter, Bruce and typing. In lonely, sad times I rush to the Grotto, knowing that I will always find peace, hope and, most ofall, love and acceptance there. At the place that was once home for all, the barricades now read "Danger! Unsafe."

Hurley's Mass showed ND family cohesiveness 
DearEditor: 

The house was fuJJ. "Come in out of the cold," Father said. The children huddled together to think, to eat, to hope and to pray. They came in various costumes-some in suits, some in sweatshirts, some with bafkpacks, but all with warm hearts. They came to show their support for their injured brother, Kevin. 
For the Hurley family, Kevin's Mass and the multitude of students and staff who par­ticipated must have been a comfort. For the rest ofus, the gathering was an opportunity to experience the strength and unique cohesive­ness of the Notre Dame family. Something of­ten alluded to by alumni in green plaid pants but something we, as students, often fail to recognize-Notre Dame is a very special place.

Presence of monument will not let us forget 
DearEditor: 

As of late, the Vniversity has come under heavy fire for its plans to erect a monument to those alumni who have died in service since World War II. While the criticism may be jus­tified in light of other pressing needs which demand immediate attention, it is unfair to cite the monument as an example offinancial 
irresponsibility  and  a  frivolous  waste  of  
money.  
This generation  has great  reason  to  be  

thankful. For the past 40 years, our freedom 
Garry Trudeau 
81fT mAT IKJKJJJ.I'M t-VA50N/..Y NOTSAYIN6 7liJO )'CAR5 H&CANTEJE AGO. HWCJJ. 
has gone relatively unthreatened. It is very 
easy to forget the millions in previous genera­
tions who died to preserve it. 
Each year in Leningrad, thousands of Soviet 
school children file past a monument com­
memorating soldiers who died at the hands of 
Nazi invaders. Soviet newlyweds stop at the 
monument before leaving for their 
honeymoons. 
we would do well to take this advice from 
our Soviet counterparts: Never forget. These 
Notre Dame students who gave up their lives 
to guarantee our freedom deserve our respect 
and a place in our memories. What better way 
can we recall their unselfishness to us, save 
through a monument that most ofus will pass 
each day? Surely S500,000 is a small price to 
pay to preserve our memory and respect. We 
cannot afford to forget.

Saint Mary's women not just for dates 
DearEditor: 
In reply to the editorial "St. Mary's should not pay same for tickets", my friends and I un­derstand and agree with the fact that if Notre Dame wants to raise ticket prices for our stu­dents then they have every right to. What we have a bone to pick about is the condescend­ing attitude of certain Notre Dame students toward Saint Mary's, specifically DonJohnson. TI1e message that came across in the editorial by Johnson is that Saint Mary's women are only good for a date. What makes him think that Notre Dame men are good for more than one date? Excuse me, 1 do not mean to take cheap shots as Johnson did. Do not get my friends and I wrong, we enjoy the combined social life, we don't enjoy being treated con­descendingly. Johnson degrades himself trying to elevate himself above others when he has no right to. He also makes the mistake of believing that Saint Mary's students wish to join Notre Dame. WE DON'T.

Notre Dame lacking 
a good radio station 
Dear Editor: 

When looking at the size and potential the University of Notre Dame possesses, we too, find it difficult to understand why we as a col­lege community lack a viable student radio station. In response toW. Todd Waffner's let­ter, we would like to shed some light on this issue. 
First, we do have two radio stations on campus. One is WSND FM 88.9, a fine classical station which services the Michiana area. The second is WVFI AM 64 which services the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community. Un­fortunately, WVFI has gradually become dis­
I

L 
and unprofessional organization, which has 
r, 
led to its present condition. In a sense, WVFI is presently being told to become a first rate
( 
radio station and then it can "play ball" with the administration. I We at WVFI have taken the necessary ac­
I 
tion. We possess a great deal ofstudent poten­
( 
tial, and the energy and enthusiasm needed to make WVFI a truly viable student radio sta·
I 
tion, an organization of which the student
{ 
bodyand administration can be proud. 

For example, we have a four year \VVFI( veteran as station manager. We have ex­perienced, enthusiastic people in all of our 
i 
departments as well including sales, promo­tions, sports, news and production. We provide immediate information-the absolute latest in news and sports -and the best music programming college radio can offer. Also, our promotions staff has some exciting ideas planned for Notre Dame and S3.int Mary's. 
Granted, we do have problems with our equipment, but not with our committment to excellence. 
We look to you, therefore, the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community and the ad· ministration. We have taken the first shot and the ball is in your court.

Cheering for the Irish just as easy for SMC

Stadium. I would think, simply from all the 
commotion being raised that many of us on 
this side of the road do put a value on our 
ticket. Saint Mary's has been an integral part of 
the fan section far longer than Pupel's 20 
years. He could confirm this fact by simply 
cracking the history books he is most 
assuredly surrounded by on a football mor­
ning, while the rest ofus are sinfully socializ­
ing. · 
Saint Mary's is simply questioning the difference in price and is addressing the ad­ministration of Notre Dame. Ifit would be so kind as to offer a reasonable, acceptable answer a lot of the griping would abate. Cer­tainly before the Notre Dame males decide to do something as drastic as flooding the stadium with students from Holy CrossJunior College and Saintjoe High School. 
There is no apparent reason for this slan­derous attack on the Saint Mary's community by certain factions. This issue did not attack them personally, but these factions cannot be surprised at our retaliation. 
We are equally proud of the football tradi­tion, and will continue to support it if Mike Bobinski has anything to do with it. Pupel, Saint Mary's women must be part ofthe cheer­leading squad. 
Go Irish...and it comes just as easily from this side ofthe street.

Both schools dependent on the other's existence 
DearEdttor: 

I hesitate to write this since I am probably stepping right into the trap which Joseph Pupel has set by writing his letter on Monday, Sept.24, but I am willing to risk being a fool in order to express my sincere disappointment towards the disrespect I have felt ever since I have been here. Maybe I just took Pupel's ar­ticle "too literally" while it was really meant to be "light-hearted", but I did all I could to stop from chokingon my coffee when I read it. 
The argument that divides Notre Dame and Saint Mary's has gone on so long, I am tired of it, and since we all know it is asinine, why can't we admit it? We Saint Mary's students do depend on Notre Dame for many of its academic, social and sporting events (notice I separ~ted them.) Notre Dame, in turn, depends on us for the same kind ofactivities. Why can't we just respect each other for what we have to offer? 
Let us not forget how far back the bonds 
between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's go. If we showed Pupel's letter to Saint Mary's alumnae, they probably would have choked on their coffee as well. Why do students from Saint Mary's have the opportunity to buy tick· ets to Notre Dame sporting events? Because we always have, and we want and deserve them for all the support we have willingly given to Notre Dame in return. 
I realize that while the best rebuttal I could have written to Pupel's article would have been none at all, I refuse to sit back and neglect the opportunity to stick up for some­thing that deserves attention and respect. We are on Notre Dame's side (even ifwe are not mentioned in the cheers or the football program), and we know Notre Dame is on our side as well. Our schools have so much poten­tial separately and together! Only when we can respect each other's individuality can we live up to this title deeming us the Notre Dame(Saint Mary's community.

Original article threw no mud at Notre Dame 
DearEditor: 

.It always amazes me at how a small a human mind can really be and Don Johnson has truly amazed me. His letter to the editor regarding Kelly Portolese's article was uncalled for. 
In her article, there was no mud slinging; it was not meant as a slap to the University of Notre Dame or its students. She was merely asking a question, "Why are Saint Mary's stu­dents required to pay more for tickets to ath­letic events at Notre Dame?" It was not a criticism of the "grossly chauvinistic bureau ofSaint Mary's College-hating officials." 
I hate to say it, but how stupid. Give Saint Mary's students more credit than that. She did not say Saint Mary's College and the Univer­sity of Notre Dame were one school and that their students should be equal. She only said the students ofboth school are treated equally in many respects but sports tickets seem to be a different matter. 
Yes. We are Saint Mary's College and U.S. 31 divides us from the University ofNotre Dame, butJohnson have you ever heard ofthe Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community? We are separate schools, but the schools are related through tradition and friends. Let us hope that does not change. 
Finally, I would like to make a comment on Johnson's closing statements concerning Saint Mary's students: "I find no fault with Saint Mary's girls. I think everyone should date one at least once." If I only knew the one girl from Saint Mary's who dated you once, Johnson, there is one thing I would like to ask her -Why? Dear God, Why?

Flames announce His wrath, and our thoughts 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a lonely God 

T 
he prophets ofgloom seem 
unanimous in agreeing that the 

next time God destroys the world, 
He will send down fire from the sky 
to incinerate us, and the globe will 
be left in ashes like Sodom and 
Gomorrah ofold. 
Fire, in our religious tradition, is both God's best symbol (meeting Moses, He disguised Himself as a burning bush ), and the agent of punishment and destruction promised to the damned, who will be gathered like faggots for the everlasting campfire. 
Sailors fear the storms when the masts ofthe ship burn like candles on a sacrificial altar as St. Elmo serds his fire as a warning ofim­pending disaster. The Chicago fire, started by the clumsiness ofMrs. O'Leary's cow -who couldn't fairly be accused ofdropping a cigarette while smoking in bed -was seen as a judgment on a town that forgot God. All the great fires ofhistory have been pointed out as examples 
ofwhat the New Testament meant 
when it warned us that our works 
would be tested as though by fire. 
Early Monday morning, Our Lady's Grotto exploded with fire. We didn't know it was possible for glass, metal, and stone to burn. "Maybe it was a bomb?" some ofthe Catholics asked. "No," the fire department said, "it was too many candles lighted and left burning by weekend visitors." 
Blaming weekend visitors sounded too easy, so the specula­tion went on. Maybe it was Gerry Faust's fault because he was over­zealous in asking the Blessed Mot­her's help. Maybe it was the gamblers with heavy bets on the game, not leaving a stone unturned to get heaven on their sides. Maybe it was the fault ofseniors, frightened by interviews, regaining their lost faith in the power ofthe saints. 
The Christians who felt them­selves gifted in reading the hand­writing on the wall shook their experienced heads. "It was a God­sent sign," they said. "It. was like the first tremor of the ground in an earthquake alerting the local in­habitants with a signal ofdanger. God, at His most dram~tic, uses fire as a language to say He is cross with us." 
Reading The Observer one could get the impression civil war is about to break out, as though we were Catholics and Protestants in Nor­thern Ireland; but that's because people who like to drink write more letters than their sober-sided classmates. Anti-establishment tirades are a form ofself­indulgence, likt: the last orgy ofa bachelor before his marriage, in a generation whose members are paying their dues to join any respectable establishment that will take them. The closer you get to a career, I suspect, the more savage indignation seems, as Adlai Steven­son described Disneyland, like "a paroxysm in trivia." 
There is a time to pick up stones ­which those without sin are free to cast -and a time to hold our peace. One ofthe benefits ofbeing my age We never had a major fire, the

God interrupted, "I know, I know. But I needed you up here. The guardian angels were experiencing a mid-eternity crisis. Morale was low and you were the best motivational speaker available." 
The Lord returned to the issue at hand. 

"My son, Catholic football in America is in a shambles. It's a sin how many Catholic high schools are changing their nicknames from the Fighting Irish to such devilish variations as the Blue Demons.

game. But give Harry Oliver most ofthe 
credit. He's the one who actually kicked the 
ball 51 yards!" 
"That was quite the miracle finish, Sir," the 
soul in the sweatsuit acknowledged, "Having 
no time remaining on the clock was a nice 
touch, too." 
"Lately, however," God resumed, "I have been preoccupied with other problems. You know how it is. Ifit isn't the Russians, it's the Democrats. Fortunately, Heaven admitted its first management consultant just the other day. She's given me quite a few pointers already about effective delegation. 
"And so, Knute, I'm delegating! I'm return­ing you to Notre Dame. Your assignment is to resurrect a winning tradition at our Lady's University!!!" 
Rockne's chaUen!Je 
T 
he soul of Knute Rockne was stunned. 
Although he had thoroughly enjoyed his 
heavenly reward, he had been a bit miffed 
when the Lord drafted him into The Biggest 
League ofALL on that fateful day in March, 
1931. 
A chance to go back to Notre Dame.... 
"...ofcourse, Knute, anything or anyone 
you need will be at your immediate dis­
posal." God's commanding voice brought 
Rockne back to attention. 
Being a soul of action, he made a swift 
decision. 
"I want George to go with me." 
God leaned back. At last count, there were 
128,912 souls named George listed in the 
Permanent Record. "George?" 
"George Gipp," Rockne answered. 
God was a little surprised. Knute usually played by the rules. "Knute, you know he's ineligible. He's still in Purgatory working off all those misspent afternoons in South Bend's pool halls...when he should have been studying!" 
"It's a touch assignment, Lord," countered Rockne. "I need the Gipper." 
God relented. 
"Oh, I suppose it can be arranged. Tell you what. I'll even fix it so that he receives a 
certain amount ofplenary indulgences for 
every touchdown he scores while wearing a 
Notre Dame uniform. They'll be credited to 
his account in the Permanent Record." 
"Thank you, Sir. When do we start?" 
"The next time someone lights a candle for the football team at the Grotto, you're on your way. Good luck, Knute!" 
Rockne's spirit rose. He started to leave. 
"Wait, Knute. I almost forgot!" 
The Lord handed Rockne two large tablets 
made ofstone. 

"I wrote these during halftime oftoday's 
game. Deliver them for me," said the Lord. 
Win or lose, Joe Kelly was an exceptionally devout Catholic. As was his custom after every game, he made a visit to the Grotto of Our Lady ofLourdes to say a Rosary in honor of the Blessed Virgin. The Grotto, a one­seventh scale replica ofthe original French shrine, had been built in 1896. It had become one ofthe most beloved spots at Notre Dame. Generations ofNotre Dame men and women had offered fervent prayers at the site. 
Kelly knelt at his usual spot along the rail, near the statue ofSaint Bernadette. He had to smile. An earlier visitor, probably one ofthe co-eds, had placed fresh flowers in the statue's delicate left hand. 
He prayed the Rosary, and then added an extra Hail Mary. He hoped the Lord oc­casionally listened to a coach's prayer.. 
Kelly rose to leave, then turned back and entered the Grotto. He removed two quarters from his pocket and slid them 

through the slot ofthe collection box. Taking a taper, he touched its waxed end to one of · the burning flames. He lit a devotional candle in the back row, where it was a little more sheltered from the wind. 
As he strode resolutely from the Grotto toward his office in the ACC, he was already too preoccupied with next Saturday's game with Michigan State to notice the flash of heavenly light over his shoulder. 
Rockne and Gipp landed on a bench at the edge ofthe clearing. They observed Coach Kelly as he headed away. 
"That's him, poor soul," said Rockne, "Joe Kelly. A Notre Dame alumnus and a fine man, too. This is his third season at Notre Dame. He came here determined to turn the Notre Dame program around. He knew it would be difficult, and it hasn't been easy on him. But he loves the University ofNotre Dame." 
"Do you really think we can help him, Rock?" asked Gipp. "I'm not sure, Gipper. But we'll certainly give it the old college try!" 
Rockne suggested a tour ofthe campus. Gipp enthusiastically agreed. Uke other souls assigned temporary guardian angel duty, they were invisible to mortals until they chose to reveal themselves. Therefore, they could move undetected among the passing parade ofpriests, professors, students and alumni. 
Entering the Main Quad, the souls turned and looked upward. 
"She's still a lovely sight, Rock," said Gipp, "The gold leaf looks good as new." 
The central campus was much as Rockne and Gipp remembered. Many of the buildings surrounding the perimeter ofthe Main Quad had been standing during their era. Most had aged gracefully. Ivy now covered their exterior walls. 
Suddenly, Rockne grew excited. There was 
one thing he wanted to see! "C'mon, George. Follow me!" They walked briskly southeast and crossed 
the South Quad. When they emerged from the walkways between the Fitzpatrick Hall of Engineering and O'Shaughnessy Hall, Rockne's destination came into full view. 
Notre Dame Stadium! 
"The House That Rockne Built" was an impressive structure. It had been built during the Golden Age ofsports by the same con­struction firm responsible for Comiskey Park in Chicago and Yankee Stadium in New York. Its outer wall stood 45 feet high and measured a half-mile in circumference. Along its rim fluttered brightly-colored pennants symbolic ofNotre Dame and its opponents for the season. 
Rockne said, "George, I coached the Irish a 20-14 win over Southern Methodist on Opening Day in October, 1930. What a day! I wish you could have been there!" 
"So do I!" 

Rockne glanced at Gipp, suddenly remem­bering. Their eyes, glistening with tears, met. Both realized how much they missed being part ofNotre Dame. 
Together, they made a silent vow to restore the lustre to its golden tradition. To be continued ...

The Notre Dame field hockey team used a stingy defense to subdue Hope College by a 5-0 score yesterday on Cartier Field. 
Molly McCabe and Corinne DiGiacomo powered the Irish of· fense with two goals apiece. 
Notre Dame Head Coach Jill Lin· denfeld singled out the defense as a factor in helping the offense to get rolling. 
"Our defense, Mary Rose Rodgers in particular, was excellent throug­hout the game," she explained. "We made good passes up to the forwards but they were not scoring. It was very frustrating. 
"Finally, in the second half, our of­fense broke loose and took advantage of the scoring oppor· tunities." 
Despite the missed opportunities, the Irish ended the half with a 2·0 lead. Melissa Sommer opened the scoring with a rebound shot, and Molly McCabe scored after receiv­ing a solid cross-field pass from Mary Rose Rodgers. 
Notre Dame exploded for three more goals midway through the second half. Molly McCabe set up Corinne DiGiacomo nicely with the third goal for the Irish. McCabe and DiGiacomo each scored again to close out the scoring. 
Irish goalies, Patti Gallagher and MaryJean Beetel, had little action in front of them as Hope attempted only one shot on goal. 
l.indenfeld said she thought the offensive outburst would help in this weekend's play.

USFL team after AI Harris; Vernon Maxwell also sought 
A.ssociated Press 
PHOENIX · The Arizona Outlaws say the'y hope to sign former Na· tional Football League linebacker Vernon Maxwell and have made an offer to linebacker AI Harris, a con­tract holdout with the Chicago Bears this season. 
Maxwell and Harris played col· legiately at nearby Arizona State for Outlaws head coach Frank Kush. 
M~ell, who also played for Kush for two NFL seasons with the Colts in Baltimore and Indianapolis, was traded to San Diego this season and then was cut by the Chargers. In 1983, he was the NFL's defensive rookie ofthe year. 
Outlaws co-owner Bill Tath~m Jr. said Maxwell talked to Kush two weeks ago about playing for Arizona and someone in his organization has begun "very, very informal" con· tract talks with Maxwell. 
The Outlaws reportedly have of· fered Harris a four-year contract worth more than S1.2 million. 
"We're taking the offer seriously, but it will have no effect on our negotiations with AI. We do not con­sider a USFL team as a factor in the negotiations," Bears general manager jerry Vainisi said Wednes· day. "In the course of some 60 con· tracts I've done this year, they've been a couple of occasions when a USFL offer came up and we told the agents to accept the offer with the USFL, that it was their perogative." 
Vainisi said the Bears' original of· fer to Harris of S825,000 over three years has been taken off the table. 
Harris' agent, Ethan Locke, said the Outlaws' offer is more than the Bears' "in straight dollars" and hinted that his client is prepared to sit out the 1985 NFL season. Arizona's offer reportedly starts at S250,000 and jumps to S400,000 in the final year. 
"The dollars are there. The structure of the deal is the thing," Tatham said. "The time factor is not critical for us, but it may be critical for AI." 
"We'd still like to have him play for the Bears," Vainisi said. "He's made a good contribution to the team, but he's priced himself out of the NFL"

AssistantSports EditOf' 
The members of the Notre Dame soccer team, who already will "have their hands full" with some tough competition this weekend, also will have to overcome additional dif­ficulties, Irish Head Coach Dennis Grace said yesterday. 
Several players have been sidelined this week with injuries or illness, and the Irish will be without the full benefit of their services tomorrow when they play at Wisconsin-Green Bay and Sunday at Northwestern. 
Tomorrow's game will begin at 2 p.m., and Sunday's starts at 1 p.m. 
"Green Bay is going to be a good team," Grace said. "They're very tough at home. I know that we're going to have our hands full, espe· cially because we don't have some of our key players. Other players have the flu and will be getting back to (only) 80 or 90 percent by the time we play." 
The Irish will leave two regular starters, John Guignon and Chris Telk, behind when they leave for Green Bay. Guignon, a freshman wingback, is fourth on the Notre Dame scoring list with two goals. Telk, a senior captain, has recorded a goal and an assist as a midfielder this season. 
Four other starters, Randy Morris, Steve Lowney, Bruce McCourt and Dave Miles, have missed some practice time this week because of illness. 
Wisconsin-Green Bay will present the Irish ( 1-6-1 ) with a 4-3·1 record, which includes a 1-0 win over Wis­consin and a 0-0 tie with national power Akron. Green Bay currently is ranked fifth in the Mideast region, behind Evansville, Akron, Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Cleveland State. 
Tomorrow's game will be the first ever between the Irish and the Phoenix. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame will face the Wildcats of Northwestern, who have lost four games to the Irish in as many meetings. However, this season's squad is stronger than ot­hers the Irish have encountered, Grace said. 
"Northwestern is a much­improved team from last year," the Notre Dame coach said. "(Head Coach) Mike Kunert does a real good job with them. 

"I know coming off a Saturday game and then travelling to Northwestern on Sunday, we're going to be concerned that the kids get ready to play again. They (the Wildcats) will be a very good op­ponent, and we've got to be on our guard. If we're not, we're going to be in trouble." 
Additional trouble may hamper the Irish if the players cannot recuperate from their illnesses. 
"When you're sick, you don't recover as fast as you can after a game," Grace said. "So we're taking an extra player or two in case they don't recuperate as they should by Sunday. We'll still have some people to go in and take their place." 
Grace said his players' attitudes seem to be good. They have forgot· ten about last weekend's disappoint· ing 1-1 tie with Michigan State and 4-0 loss to Indiana.

overtime ended the game. As Zahm "A"'s left wing Rob Paradise at­tempted to cross the ball for Chris Koster, the ball bounced offa Dillon defender and into the net. 
Zahm "A"'s captain, Bill Lane, pointed out the fact that his team is comprised of nine freshmen, and said that the work of keeper John Gisleson in the Dillon II game was "excellent". He admitted, however, that such a young team will have dif· ficulty playing in a division pop· ulated by older and talented teams such as Flanner and O.C. Crime.

"Initially after the loss to Indiana they were a little down," he said, "only because of how they didn't play well and how Indiana really took it to them. But they seem to have bounced back, and they seem to be hungry, which is good. 
"They seem to be ready to go." 
Grace intentionally scheduled several tough games for the Irish this season so his players could grow. Now, as he has to deal with injuries, illness and travel restrictions, he said he still is not having second thoughts. 
"We're facing more and more ad­versity, but somehow we're going to do it," he said. 
The schedule does not get any easier for Notre Dame for the rest of the season, so ifthe Irish are going to tum around their 1-6-1 record, they might as well start this weekend. 
slippery Cartier Field, 3·1. Using goals from Rob Zilenski, Dave Stevenson, and captain Jim Byrne, Stanford got off to a good start this season. 
"We should do pretty well this year, even though we have a lot of freshmen on the team," said Byrne. 
Still, such bellicose statements will have to be kept in perspective in a league with O.C. SP, Dillon I, Holy Cross "8", and Flanner "B". 
This weekend a full slate ofgames is scheduled, featuring Howard vs. Grace "A" on Sunday at 4 p.m. on the South Stepan Field, Alumni vs. Holy Cross, Sunday at 3 p.m. on South Stepan, and Monday afternoon's 4 
p.m. slugfest pitting Sorin against 
O.C. Crime on South Stepan.

teams. St. Thomas (Minn.) enters this season as defending NCAA Divi­sion III champions, and the Vil­lanova Wildcats boast the brother combination of Anthony and Gerry O'Reiley. 
Then there is Boston College, which provides an extra incentive for Magill.

Along with this, though, he senses the same "hardworking atmo­sphere" which characterized 1984. 
As co-captain, meanwhile, Magill views his responsibility as leading by example everyday and enjoying practice. 
"We encourage the younger members by recognizing their ac­complishments in practice and in meets," says Magill "The team con­cept is extremely important. 
"Only seven men run in the var­sity race," he continues, "but 15 to 20 members support them in practice and at meets. This is almost as important as running because it inspires the team spirit, and no one wins cross country meets without a team effort." 
Magill, who will graduate in the spring, has become especially close to the younger members of the team. 
"The younger runners arc impor­tant to me," he says. "When I graduate, I want the spirit and success to continue with them." 
Magill's success throughout his tenure has been clear. He has steadily improved from No. 12 man freshman year, to the No. 9 place as a Magill also notes that it will be dif· 

ficult to improve on his 17th place 
showing last year. 
"I hope to place somewhere in the 
top 15," he says. "But the field is a lot 
deeper talent-wise." 
The Notre Dame women's cross country club, meanwhile, will race against 15 varsity women's teams this year. Club president Mary Beth Fisk noted that the club usually does not run against these teams, so she really does not know how they will perform. 
The top runners for the club are Julia Merkel, Nancy Laughlin, Kath· leen Lehman, and Susan Wanchow. 
Spectators are welcome for both races. Piane notes that there are several spots on the course that the runners pass three or four times, so it is easy to catch most of the action. 
ficult task," says Magill "They have instilled already in themselves the discipline and work ethic from previous academic success required for admission to Notre Dame. Also, when you run with quality Division I runners, you improve toward their level" 
Magill, a walk-on who made it to co-captain, is proofof that.

crew -Your-Roommate. The dance with a difference. The tryst with a twist. A chance with a chump. Or a bash with a beauty. 
Only at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's could such a concept have become the pivot around which social life revolves. 
In their short existence at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, Screw-Your-Roommates (more
fun or flops? delicately known as SYRs) already have taken on the prestige ofa weighty tradition. A dorm that does not hold at least one SYR in a semester is seen as socially backward. A student who doesn't attend any SYRs in his college career is left out of many conversations. 
You may love them, you may hate them, but you can hardly ignore them. SYRs have become as

much a part ofNotre Dame as the Golden Dome. 
Actually, they only have been around for seven 
years. The whole thing began in 1976 with the 
then-novel idea ofan all-hall dance, according to 
Sister jean Lenz, assistant vice president for 
student affairs and former rectress ofFarley. That 
idea was born in 1976 with the first Pop Farley 
birthdaycelebration, for which the dorm had to 
obtain special permission, she said. 
Two years later, according to Lenz, a women's 
dorm (she and other former rectors are uncertain 
as to which one) became the first to hold a dance 
and call it a Screw-Your-Roommate. It was simply 
the name ofan all-hall dance that was supposed to 
be all blind dates, but the idea spread like wildfire. 
By 1981, all dorms were holding SYRs, some not 
even pretending to hold to the blind-date idea. 
"There were a lot of reverberations from that 
event," she said. "We had such a good time-the 
hall was themed and decorated, and there was 
nothing like that before. People asked, 'When can 
we do it again?' It became an annual thing." 
One reason for the spread ofhall dances, Lenz 
believes, was that they were one ofthe few 
situations where alcohol was allowed. 
Lenz believes SYRs are now phasing out. "I 
think people put themselves in a difficult situation 
socially in that setting. You get somebody you 
don't like, you start at 8, and it goes all the way to 
1," she said. "I get the impression that it's getting 
hard to get the whole hall to do this." 
Cavanaugh Rector Father Matthew Miceli noted 
that at Cavanaugh's first SYR in 1979, "the decora­
tions were enormous. But now they are minimal." 
Lenz said she doesn't know what may take the 
place ofSYRs, but the University is trying to bring 
social life out ofthe dorms by introducing such 
alternatives as new Around the Corner Club. 
An informal survey revealed that for many 
students, SYRs still are seen as a major source of 
fun and a way to meet people. 
"They're a blast and this campus is so boring 
that any social life is good social life," Bob 
Cahelsky, a Stanford sophomore. "It also gives you 
chance to drink." 

"I think they're a good alternative, but I tell 
~~n.cu that basing a date on just looks is 
immature," said senior Laurene Powers of 
Pasquerilla West. "They have a good mature party 
atmosphere with a chance to meet a lot of 
people." 

Many students said they "cheat" and do not follow the blind date theme strictly. Technically, for an SYR, you should call up a blind date for your roommate and not tell her who it is until he shows up for the dance, and vice versa. But of course, this doesn't always fit the plans. Following are several ways mentioned to get around this: 
The 
main way to cheat, ofcourse, is to choose your favorite "scope" and tell your roommate to call him. "We are having an SYR this Friday, and I thought you might want to go with jane," your roommate says. "Don't tell jane I'm asking you, because she doesn't know." Meanwhile,jane is listening near the phone with bated breath. 

SYRs 
are inextricably linked to another Notre Dame tradition, the Dogbook. One common way to find that ideal SYR date is to simply page through it until you find a great-looking person. One slight disadvantage to this method is that people who happened to have good photog­raphers end up getting calls for 30 different SYRs in one semester. Another is that photos taken during junior year in high school can be very

-The Time 
Saturday night SYR. Feeling like a 
million dollars, and oh, have you 
got the hottest date around. Ready 
to burn down the night. 
An SYR gives you the best ofboth 
worlds; it has the formality ofa 
major dance but doesn't have to be 
as serious. But it will assuredly be 
only what you make ofit. You can 
turn an SYR into "a dance I went to" 
or into a wild talk-about-it-for­
weeks kind of night. The choice is entirely up to you. 
Your look for the night is a major factor in how you will be perceived. Realize that few will challenge you on it. It's there and will receive a reaction and will receive a reaction. 
Question: What kind ofa reaction do you want? The decision to dress

unreliable. 
The 
dogbook is also key at the other end of the line. It is a well­known fact that when you are cal­ling for an SYR date and the person at the other end ofthe line says, "Can you hold on a minute while I check my calendar?" they are ac­tually frantically paging through the dogbook. To save time, some people simply have mentioned at the end of the call, "By the way, he's on page 32." 

One 
nasty way ofcheating is to make up a "Top tO" list several weeks in advance, and have your roommate run down it in order until he gets an affirmative. 

If
your date really doesn't know you, it is possible (though risky) to pretend you are your roommate and ask "Hey, would you like to go to our SYR with my roommate John?" Later you call up and say, "Hi, I'm John, your SYR date." 

Corsages/boutonnieres 
always present a problem. You don't want to be tacky and not get one, but on the other hand you don't want to embarrass your date if he didn't buy one for you. The safest bet is to buy one and put in the refrigerator until the night ofthe dance. Ifyour date arrives without one, simply don't take it out (but be careful he doesn't see when you open the fridge to get a beer). 

One 
twist to playing by the rules is to actually call a blind date for your roommate, and casually men­tion to him that you did so several days later. This is not recom­mended unless you are desperately trying to switch roommates. 


No matter how you work it, it is likely that SYRs will provide both your best and the worst times at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. As Lenz noted, "I've heard ofpeople who left (their dates) before a dance was over. But I'm sure there are people who have married their blind dates from anSYR." 

up or down is completely yours. There are no rights or wrongs in the look you create, though ofcourse the dress code is semi-formal at the very least. Subtle elegance, cool sophistication, wildly chic ... each look can conceivably make your date's knees weak. 
Simple, clean lines are key. This year's premise is to keep the dress a simple base that can be comple­mented with accessories. The idea is to keep the body ofthe outfit in a slim, fluid line. "Dressing" becomes the act ofadding to the base with eye-catching, head-turning acces­sories. 
The premise is the same for evening dress. The throwaway charm ofthe "little black dress" is still very appealing, but now flashed with color. Vogue's September issue suggests coloringand textures should be "almost fantasy-like in their decorativeness, their dazzle." Mesh, tulle, leather, cachmere, lace, velvet, satin, and watered silk are all 
extremely "touchable" signatures. 
But keep the styling simple to set 
offthe actual ..-dressing" pieces. 
Body-dressing jewels demand attention; with these, you can vir­tually do no wrong. Chokers of colored glass, stacked bangles on arms, and pearls dripping down the back ofa gown are coming up in the fashion scene. Gold in particular should be worn with daring, making the most ofits charms in the form of matte textures and unique bracelets against the background ofdark colors and simple shapes. 
Stockings are back in unusual textures, patterns, and colors to showcase the legs. And gloves, long and short, studded and jeweled, of suede, leather or lace, are ideal for playing offthe simplicity ofthe base dress. 
The ultimate objective is to create contrast and impact. Use colors that move to a rhythm with an intensity that grabs the eye. The total effect should be striking but not garish. Overpowering your date is not the goal. 
Aword for men. There is no need to feel limited to a traditional suit or coat and tie. Textures and colors are your forte and can be taken advantage of. Leather and suede carry a distinctly masculine feel as do wool and tweed. Accents like ties and collars can alSo be a major part ofyour dress. 
Cufflinks are a nice addition to any look. They carry a sense of romance and add a classy touch. 
Your choice ofcologne will be burned in her mind. Make it a good one.

W
~dnesday I almost had a really good 
ume. 

My roommates and I went to the nightclub 
Chips to catch a couple ofcomedy acts. The 
comedians were slick, the club was passable 
and the beer was definitely all right. Unfor­
tunately, the townie clientele did their best 
to ruin everyone's evening. 

Chips has been hosting comedians every 
Wednesday night since February, according 
to Manager Elaine Kistner. Kistner said most 
ofthe comedians come from either the 

Chicago or Detroit area, though the featured 
comedian last week was john McDonell, an 

Englishman from the Finsbury Park section of 
LOndon. Admission on comedy night is 13 
and one must be 21 to enter. 

As a building, Chips is a cut above regular 
Domer bars such as the Commons, Bridget's 
and Mr. D's. The bar is divided into two 

rooms. One is a long room, with a large bar 
extending down the left side as one enters, 
and a small dance floor converted into a stage 
for the comedians at the far end. Offthis 

room is a lounge with a big screen television 
and the standard barroom video games: 
Pac-Man, Centipede and Electric Darts. 

Chips is spacious, and though the decor is 
nothing special, it was a refreshing change 
not to be crushed getting a drink. In fact it 
wasn't necessary to go to the bar at all as 

Chips has a couple ofwaitresses who visited -our table frequently. The comedians were obviously profes­
sionals who knew their craft. Opening was Kevin Norman, a Chicago native who enter­tained the crowd for half an hour with infectious, Eddie Murphy-esque humor. His topics included family life, fat jokes and imitations ofjames Brown and a drunk driver ("I ran over your dog. I'm sorry, but you shouldn't let him run around in your back­yard.") 
After Norman finished his act, the natives started to get restless. Chip's master of ceremonies came out to ask the audience of about 50 people, mainly Hoosiers, to allow the featured comedian the chance to get through his jokes. 
The request had no effect. McDonnell had been onstage no more than 30 seconds when he was heckled by a sizeable group ofdrunk patrons at a table in the center of the room. The hecklers were led by a guy who said he "works 'sat da' effanol plant" -need I say more? 
For about 30 minutes these people kept up a continuous flow ofinnane comments aimed at the stage. To McDonnell's credit, he was able to make the most ofthe comedic poten­tial ofhis attackers. Finally, the hecklers became preoccupied with grabbing at a waitress and shut up, giving McDonnell a chance to get into his standard material ­which was quite funny. 
McDonnell's observational style ofhumor, vaguely reminiscent ofGeorge Carlin, worked especially well when he talked about places such as Alabama ("There are some retarded people down there, and they're in charge.") and about women ("I love ladies­where would men be without them? Probably in a circle somewhere.") 
Until something is done about audience respect for performers, I would not recom­mend Chips for anything but a large group of people capable ofdominating the atomo­sphere ofthe bar. 
Chips is located on 746 South Eddy St. off Mishawaka Avenue in South Bend.

Key for Irish is to be consistent against Purdue 

Chuck Freeby 
Irish Items 
Hello again everybody! 

Last week the key word for Gerry Faust's Fighting Irish was "win," and Notre Dame achieved that goal by using an excellent game plan and-for most ofthe game-executing it. 
Anybody can win once in a while, though.Just look at the Pittsburgh Pirates. What makes the champions is the ability to win again. . . and again. . . and again. So, the key for the Irish this week is not only "win," it's achieving "consistency". 
Consistency and intensity are words Faust has used a lot during his tenure at Notre Dame. We've seen the intensity on several occa­sions, the most recent occurence being last week against the Spar­tans as the Irish shook off the doldrums suffered in the opener and came out fired up and ready to play. Consistency, however, has remained an elusive element for Faust's teams. 
Oh, certainly we've seen spurts ofgood play. The first four games of the '82 season and the last four games of '84 were examples of steady, winning football. In both streaks, the Irish used a solid run­ning game while shutting down the opposition's aerial attack. It cer­tainly wasn't the most exciting football, but it did produce four victories in a row, and that is the bottom line. 
The reasons the Irish were unable to maintain consistency in those seasons are very simple. In examining the breakdowns in those losses, the first thing one notices is that the running attack was not strong enough to establish the passing game. That meant the Irish found themselves in several long-yardage situations, and you didn't have to be in the Irish huddle to know the ball was going in the air. 
Secondly, the Irish defense may have been exceptionally strong against the run, but it certainly had its shart: ofproblems against the pass. Opponents with good quarterbacks knew this and took advantage of the weakness. While the running stats remained low, the passing numbers ballooned, as did the Irish loss total. 
In many ways, Faust's '85 edition resembles these teams. It was ob­vious Saturday night that once Notre Dame established Pinkett as a potent weapon on the ground, the passing game became increas­ingly effective. It also is apparent that the defense is strong enough to thwart an average or less-than-average quarterback, as it has in the season's first two games. 
Purdue, however, posses~s the qualities which have troubled recent Notre Dame teams. Jim Everett may be the premier passing quarterback in the Big Ten, and he certainly will test Notre Dame's defense unlike any other quarterback the Irish will face this season. 
Everett has an exceptionally quick release for a quarterback, which means the defensive line and linebackers must move off the ball quickly to get to him before he can set up. If the Irish pass rush is ineffective, it's going to be a long day for the folks in the secondary, who will have their hands full with Purdue's fine receiving corps. 
The Boilermakers also possess a strong defensive line, which shut down the Irish running game last year. While Purdue ~dmittedly is weaker against the pass, Notre Dame must establish the running game in order to exploit that weakness. If not, Steve Beuerlein could be wearing linebackers on his back every time he looks to pass. 
The warning signs are there for Faust and the Irish. They certainly know what to expect from Purdue -now it's just a matter ofstopping it. That is easier said than done, though. 
Ifthe Irish can't stop Purdue, 1985 could take on the same inconsis­tent character of Faust's previous four years. On the other hand, if Notre Dame beats Purdue tomorrow, it could be a sign that the con­sistency which has eluded Faust's teams in the past has finally arrived. 
Pick of the Week Consistency was one thing Notre Dame cross country coach Joe Piane's team had last year, and he'll be looking for that hallmark to continue when the Irish play host to the National Catholic Meet this afternoon at the Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
The Irish are the defending champions, but in order to repeat they'll need to hold offa strong challenge from strong Eastern teams such as Boston College and Villanova as well as perennial rival Marquette. The action starts at 3 p.m. with the women's race, so go on out and give the Irish your support.

reflected Krause. "Purdue went on to lose to all their Big Ten opponents and finish 2-7. But they still gave Coach Holcomb an extension on his contract. That's how im­ponant the victory over the Irish was." 
The notability of the Irish-Boilermaker contestcontinued throughout the years. In 1957, although the shillelagh was at stake, the players had even more on their minds than the trophy. Both teams were trying to bring some respectability back to their programs. Purdue had just seen its team complete a 3-4-2 season in 1956, while the Irish didn't have any luck that year either, finishing 2-8. Both schools were looking for some sense ofredemption as they faced each other at Ross-Ade Stadium in the season opener. 
"Our first game that season carried the to­tal weight of the last season because everyone was looking to see if we were going to pick ourselves up or repeat the tragedy of '56," explained 1957 Irish co­captain Ed Sullivan. "You build a winning season one game at a time, and the opener is certainly a pivotal point. It sets the tone for the team. And a victory over Purdue al­ways helps. 
"They were a great rival -mortal enemies at times. We knew Purdue was always a tough, physical team and that they were going to hit hard. The past two times they came up here to play they beat us, so we wanted to go down there and return the favor. We wanted the win badly." 
And a win was exactly what Sullivan and his teammates brought back to South Bend, along with the shillelagh. The Irish defense had the usually potent Purdue aerial attack hobbling on one leg. The Boilermakers didn't complete a single pass in the first 59 minutes ofplay. In addition, Big Ten standout and Purdue record­holder Mel Dillard gained only 51 yards on I 5 carries, the second lowest total of his career. 
The Purdue defense was just as stingy, hol­ding the Irish to just 12 points. But that was all Notre Dame needed to record a victory that afternoon. The win spurred the Irish to a 7-3 season and a ninth-place finish in the polls. 
Notre Dame has not always had such luck when it comes to Purdue games, though. In 
1967, Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian was riding high with a l 0-game winning streak and a number-one ranking. Once again, the Boilers came in as the giant kil­ler. Ranked 1Oth in the country, Purdue had everything to gain and not much to lose. Boilermaker coach jack Mollenkopf had all-America back Leroy Keyes and highly­skilled quarterback Mike Phipps prepared to welcome the likes of Irish signal caller Terry Hanratty and fullback Rocky Bleier. In front of a capacity crowd at West Lafayette, Notre Dame was handed one of only two defeats that season, 28-21. 
Not that Irish fans should despair. Notre Dame has had more than its share of vic­tories in the series. Since 1968, the Irish lead the series 11-6, with such scoring mar­gins as 48-0, 35-14 and 52-6 showing up in the record books. But ask anyone knowledgeable about the series between these two schools and they'll tell you that when these teams meet you can throw out the book. 
"You never know what to expect when the two play," Krause said. "It seems that whoever is favored ends up losing anyway. It is one of the best rivalries we've got." 
Exactly 28 years from the day the shil­lelagh first was made a part ofhistory, these two teams will square off once again tomorrow. Whether it is a rainy Saturday or a clear, sunny day, whether a team's reputation is at stake or is being defended, one thing is clear. when the Irish and the Boilermakers clash, it is always something special.

"I thought about it, but with football it would be too much," he continues. "I really like basket­ball, but I don't think I could ever be a better basketball player than a football player." 
says Brown. "But I don't like for people to label me because then if I don't live up to their ex­peciQtions, they're disappointed. I'd rather they just said that I was a solid football player." 
Tim Brown may be more than just a solid foot­ball player. Although his reticence off the field prevents him from admitting any impending greatness, he could very well end up alongside other great Notre Dame receivers in the memories of Irish fans. 
And that graceful image in people's minds will be much better to Tim Brown than the one people received from his first collegiate game.

pleting 20-of-28 passes to lead the Boiler­
makers to a 23-21 upset over the Irish. 

The Irish will try to avenge that loss tomorrow as they travel to West Lafayette, Ind., to face Purdue. And this time around, they know whom to regard as the main threat. Everett has thrown for 738 yards and seven touchdowns in his first two games. But although Everett is well known to Notre Dame, howwell the Irish prepare for him will spell the outcome ofthe game in the end. 
The Boilermakers enter the game with a 1·1 record, losing to Pittsburgh in their opener, 31·30, then whipping Ball State 37-18 last week. And even though Purdue had a three· week break before facing the Cardinals, Irish head coach Gerry Faust points out that some ofthat time might have been spent looking at the Irish. 
"Purdue had three full weeks to prepare for Ball State," said Faust, "and I think Leon even admitted they already had spent some time working on Notre Dame. So we're going to have our work cut out for us. It'll be tough." 
It certainly will be tough, but the Irish possess the potential to derail the potent Boilermaker passing attack. If Notre Dame plays with the intensity it did last week against Michigan State, it very well could leave Ross-Ade Stadium with a victory. 
Purdue's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense: 
When talking about the Purdue offense, one speaks essentially of Everett. The 6-5, 212­pound senior Has completed 68 percent ofhis passes ( 58-of-85) for 738 of Purdue's 970 to­tal yards this season. Everett has thrown just two interceptions, and Purdue head coach Leon Burtnett makes no bones about how the Boilermakers will attack the Irish defense. 
"We will have to throw the football a lot to be successful," said Burtnett. "You just don't run the football up and down the field against Notre Dame." 
Everett's main targets are fullback Ray Wallace ( 12 catches for 128 yards), tight end Marty Scott ( 12 for 116) and wide receiver Steve Griffin ( 10 for 1 50). 
But although the Boilermakers are feared mainly for their passing attack, they do have two very talented and underrated running backs on their roster. 
The 6-0, 221-pound Wallace has rushed ·for 115 yards on 24 carries, while 6-0, 206-pound tailback Rodney Carter has gotten the call 2 3 times, gaining 55 yards. 
The offensive line, which consists of Mark 
Drenth, Vince Panfil, Rick Skibinski, Bret Brunell and Mike 
nose guard slot. The Irish will try to put the same pressure on Everett that they had on Spartan quarterback Bobby McAlister last week, forcing 13 incompletions in 17 at­tempts. 
The linebacking corps again will consist of Larkin and Robert Banks on the outside, with Tony Furjanic and Mike Kovaleski on the inside. They will try to stop the Boilermaker rushing attack, while also keeping an eye on Everett's short passing game. 
The Irish secondary will have its hands full with Everett, but from the first two games it appears Notre Dame has the ability to meet him head on. The

receivers. And Wallace and Carter are good enough runners to earn your defense's respect." 
Notre Dame should be able to start the same players on defense that it did against the Spar· tans. Outside linebacker Mike Larkin sprained an ankle in that game, while free safety Steve Lawrence aggravated a hip flexor. But both are expected to play in tomorrow's game after improvement in their conditions. 
Thedefensive line will have Greg Dingens and Wally Kleine at the tackles, while Eric Dorsey, who had 12 tackles and two sacks last week, will try to ignite the Irish defenders from his 
Everett defensively. 

I don't think we can afford to play the same type ofcoverage down after down." 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Purdue's defense: 
The Notre Dame offense also will enter the game with the same look. Junior quarterback Steve Beuerlein has completed 52 percent of his passes for 3 77 yards, hitting for one touch­down while throwing three interceptions. 
"I think (Beuerlein) has given us good leader· ship over the first two weeks," said Faust. "I think he's thrown the ball quite well except for a couple times. I think his performance has been good and it will get better." 
Junior split end Alvin Miller should be at full strength this week, joining Reggie Ward, Tim Brown, Tony Eason and Pat Cusack as Beuer­lein's targets. The Irish will try to balance their offensive attack against the Boilermakers be­cause Beuerlein will be facing an experienced secondary. 
As far as the Irish offensive line goes, improve­ment was evident in the Michigan State game. Hopefully for Notre Dame, this improvement will continue Saturday against the 4-3 defense ofPurdue. 
"I thought our offensive line did well against Michigan State," said Faust. "I really was impressed with our pass blocking. Our run blocking has to improve, but it will get better because we'll keep working on it." 
The Purdue defense, however, most certainly will challenge the talented Irish offense. The Boilermakers have given up only 294.5 total yards per game, 141 passing and 153.5 on the ground. 
The defense returns eight starters from last year. The front four is headed by senior Brad Horner, who has recorded six tackles, four of them going for losses. 
The Purdue secondary is filled with veterans, with junior free safety Rod Woodson recognized as the hard-hitting leader. The defensive backs will have their hands full trying to keep up with the Irish speedsters. 
"The secondary is an experienced secon­dary," said Faust. "They've got a lot of speed back there. I think their defense is excellent and is going to cause a lot of problems for us, but we're just going to have to be ready to button our chin straps. 
"I think the Michigan State game proved to our players what can be accomplished with consistent intensity and aggressiveness. We played hard and we played with emotion · and when you do that you can overcome some er­rors along the way." 
There is no reason for Notre Dame not to ap­proach tomorrow's game in the same way. Stopping Everett will be the key for the Irish defense, and if Notre Dame is able to put together a consistent offensive effort as well, it could be a long afternoon for the Boiler­makers.
