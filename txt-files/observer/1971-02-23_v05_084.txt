MOONEY-BARKETT EVEN 
Many Undecided In First Poll 

bv Ed Ellis OESER VER News Editor 
With two days remaining in the campaign, the majority of Notre Dame students is still undecided in this year's Student Body Presidential election. Among those who have decided, Student Senator Don Mooney and Hall President's Council Chair­man John Barkett hold a sizeable lead over the field, but the distinction between the two leaders is so slight as to prohibit valid prediction. 
This was the result of a poll conduded last night for The Observer by the Student Survey Service of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's under­graduate Sociology Club and the Alpha Kappa Delta Sociology Fraternity. 
Of a total sample of 400 students, 324, or 81%, replied. Of those, 82% said that they would definitely vote. 8.6% will not vote, and 9% of H•ose responding are undecided whether they will vote or not. Of those who will vote, Senator Mooney has 19.3%, Barkett 18 6%, and Jim Riebandt lags behind in third place with 5 .0%. Slightly over 50% of the students who said they would vote, said they were undecided as to whom they would choose. 
Among the other candidates, Mike Cervas polled 2%, Chip Hendrick, 1.4'f,,; and Rich Sherman, Eileen Fitzpatrick, and Jamie Egan .7%. 
The poll, coordinated by Dan Shaw of the Sociology Club, was based on random selection by class, not specifically by hall, and thus not all halls could be predicted by the sampling. Some halls, however, where there was a concentration of the sampling, could be predicted. Students in Alumni, where Mooney lived last year, showed a preference to Mooney, but the undecided vote was still great. 
Barkett's home hall of Morrissey showed a definite preference for him as did Fisher, but Dillon showed a slight lead for Mooney. 
In Cavanaugh the preference was for Barkett, but again the undecided vote made definite predic­tions impossible. 
The Student Government Abolition petition to be placed on the ballot with the Presidential c~oice received a negative reaction, 46% to 24%, With 30% undecided. 
The high percentage of uncertain voters is unprecedented in Student Body Presidential elec­tions. Last year the first Observer poll showed 38% undecided, and the second poll was considerably lower. The possible cause of the uncertainty is the short campaign, but no one has yet advanced any definite explanations. 
Pollster Shaw mentioned that the high percen· tage of persons saying that they intended to vote was probably inaccurate. This percentage was 82% b~t Shaw said that many people tend to say they will vote but never actually do it.

Sherman prom1ses Better N D Life 
by Mike O'Hare 

Saying they are "tired of the political rhetoric and unlimited idealism of past student governments," Rich Sherman and his running mate Mike Murphy, are centering their campaign on the belief that, "Student government must realize its limits and help better the everyday life of the average student." Sherman feels that student leaders must be cognizant of the limits of their ideals and concentrate on doing the most they can to improve student life

S.G. Teamwor~~ to aid students 
by Mary Chris Morrison 
Kate Cassidy and Laura Bayer, candidates for SMC stu­dent body president and vice­j)resident, believe strongly in the importance of a closely knit team to best represent the inter­ests of the students. 
It is from this te:tm concept of the offices that they arc attempting to deal with what they term the four main areas of their platform: Coeducation, Student Government Merger, Health Service and Counseling, and Community Government. 
Miss Cassidy stated that it is no longer a question of SMC and Notre Dame going coed or not, but rather how we can best accomplish the step by step logi­cal process that such a change requires. She and Miss Bayer see I this as "the year that student involvement is absolutely neces­sary" if the change to coeduca­tion is going to take place accor­ding to student desires. 
The team stresses the genuine excitement surrounding the re­structuring· of the two schools. They see the potential of two different apporaches to liberal art~ education as a very real

possibility. 
As stated in their platform, "There can be two different approaches to a liberal arts edu­cation -and providing an experi­mental interdisciplinary college on this campus while still main­
taining a liberal arts college at Notre Dame could allow for the best possibk education for all students by representing a diver­sity of opportunity." Regarding their basic approach to the question, the team sees the conception of a semi-autonomous St. Mary's College of the University of Notre Dame as most workable." In the area of student govern­ment structure, Miss Cassidy stated that "we advocate full cooperation with Notre Dame in the areas that concern us both, but we see: no reason for a complete merger at this time. "While WI! are working with two distinct administrations, we advocate two distinct, but co­operative, governments." The team is also vitally con­cerned with the health service provided at SMC. They believe that the health and counseling services should be merged into one 1-Iealth Center, where both mental and physical . problems could be dealt with. They are also in favor of the health and counseling services of SMC merging with those of Notre Dame,, as recommended in the Park-Mayhew report. The last major goal of the 

·team's platform concerns com­munity government. They stated that "the adll'inistration has 
declareo open war on com­
munity governments. One of our 
major goals is an opening up of 
the administration. To try and 
accomplish this we propose 
open forums at least once a 
month." 
The forums would be held in 
each hall and be open to all 
interested students, faculty, and 
administrative personnel. Miss 
Cassidy hopes that the forums 
will serve to eliminate the elitist 
tendencies of student govern­
ment. 
In order to do this, however, the student body will have to become involved. The team sees part of their responsibility in the . roles of student body president and vice-president as engender­ing excitement for student body 
involvement. 
They continued, "We see our 
role as one of asking questions 
and then reporting back to the 
student body in our open 
forums... We don't have any 
illusions about the offices we are 
running for being easy to fill.t• 
In accordance with the belief that the students have to be aware before they can become iny_olved, Miss Cassidy and Miss Bayer have changed their cam­paign approach from holding floor mee!ings in the various halls to a door-to-door cam­paign. 
They want to talk to as many 
students as possible on a very 
personal level in order to combat 
the apathetic mentality that 
says, "Prov·e to us that student 
government can do something, 
then we'll come to your meet­
ings." 
Miss Cassidy and Miss Bayer 
believe "the most ' important thing that we can offer is a more open representation so that every student has the opportuni­ty to listen to and discuss the issues student government deals with." But for this to be realized students will have to participate.

ADMISSIONS 

The key to the academic atmosphere in <lOY university is the admissions program. Many have charged that ours has failed to bring a sufficiently diverse student body to Notre Dame. I rnmediately it is clear that the merger of the Notre Dame and St. Mary's admissions departments is a desirable step towards a more •diverse student body. But this is onlv one aspect of the problem as It appears to us. The need for as diverse a student body as possible Is so Important that we consider It second only to the need for immediate co-educa,tion. When 
we speak of diversity we do not limit oursellves solely to racial minorities although they form an important element, but we' extend our goals In this area to Include ethnic minorities such as Chinese and Japanese Americans, Indian and Mexican Americans, non-catholics, Baptist, Lutheran and Unitarian, and most of a II, those of diverse economic backgrounds such as the sons and daughters of blue-collar factory workers. 
In attempting to aid the admissions depmtment in Its most important work, we will establish a new cabinet position of Admission Commissioner whose job will be to work solely In this area, and to co-ordinate joint student body efforts to extend the Recruitment Act ion Program from the area of strictly racial minorities to the wider area of minoriHes as outlined above. This program will call upon undergraduates to use vacation time to speak to and work with qualified high school students in their home towns attempting to interest these students in attE>nding Notre Dame. We realize that the success of this program depends on the availability of scholarship money. we also realize that the funds which we receive from such things as the Cotton Bowl are neither sufficient nor stable enough to continually guarantee the funding of this program. We honestly cannot offer any solution to this problem, but we can promise that it will be the first consideration of our administration to find a viable solution to this problem. 
OFF-CAMPUS 

Students move off-campus because of a conscious or unconscious dissatisfaction with the residential environment. Because of this, emphasis should be placed on improving the life in the dormitories at Notre Dame. However, there are certain a·spects of residential living which are inherent and in some cases not conducive to the well-being of 
the student. In such cases we believe that any student's desire to live off-<:ampus should be respected. It shall be our purpose to defend that right. 
Sec a use we believe that co-education should be implimented in all areas of student concern, we shall work to merge the Notre Dame and St. Mary's off-campus offices. An elected representative from off-campus should also be seated on the Hall Presidents Council, and be given the same status in eliciting funds and other benefits as the residence halls. The off-campus office should also be a service offered by the students for the students. Thus 
we shall work to insure that the off-<:ampus office is staffed and operated by students approved by Student Government, and in conjunction with the Dir-ector of Student Residences if necessary. 
As in the past two years, it shall be our policy not to establish an off-campus sounding or complaints board. Off-campus is within the realm of civil auspices, and we In student government have neither the expertise nor the authority to enter into this area. we shall continue to work through the law school to obtain legal aid for those students who need it. 
MINORITY STUDENTS 
If one truly desires to enrich the Notre Dame experience, he must realize the unique problems faced by minority students. In overcomin~ these problems, we need an attitudi! which recognizes the diverse human potential found In each student ­foreign, black, Mexican-American I ndlan, woman, etc. EstabliSh in~ facilities wherein the specific cultural and socail needs of these student may be fulfilled would assist in allowing these students their own personal development. The University and SMC have an imperative to establish a tutorin£ program to aid all minority student in overcoming academic problems, a well as establishing a counselln~ service to help these students adjus to the different conditions they find themselves in. 
Furthermore, S.G. should provide some realistic funding so that individual organizations may carry out their programs. It should take an active part in obtaining tutors for those students who need them. 
Black Studies should be expanded 
into an ethnic studies program 
Furthermore, Dr. Joseph Scott, the 
present director of Black Studie 
should have a staff to enable him to 
deal with the myriad problems which 
he presently faces. 
STUDENTS ABROAD 
Students in foreign programs find themselves incommunicado with the University for their year of studies. To alleviate this we propose establishing the Cabinet position of Foreign Exchange Commissioner whose duties would entail locating ND/SMC students studying in foreign 
programs, sending them periodical literature to keep them informed of what Is occurring on campus, and insuring that they are able to participate In SBP elections.

~Ven that Notre Dame is more than a golden bubble, a number of spookily talented athletes, a piety palace, and a success machine, a number of Freshmen are annually disappointed. Let's face it; Notre Dame in theory is considerable different from Notre Dame in practice; and perhaps the theory is a bit more attractive than the reality. If we were to believe what we read in the papers (or saw on NBC or read in Srwrts illustrated) we'd believe that between football weekends students here sit around and joyously lap up the Truth; moved by love of the aforementioned on the one hand and fear of the righteous anger of the no-nonsense Fr. Hesburgh on the other hand. But we don't believe it, and this fold-out and send-home section will attempt to address itself to the reasons for we don't. 
No one will pretend that this section will at all deal completely with Notre Dame. Since the people who write are peopk and as such are limited by their own hopes, experiences, prejudices, and fears; But they are also written by students, students with nothing to win or lose by speaking their minds, and they are written as honestly as can be honestly written. 
In this section, then, you will find six columns by six students. The columns will appear on t11e next two pages; the two pages after that will be dominated by Neil Rosini's full-page cartoon, At Notre Dame. After the Obsenw Editorial Page, the section will feature a full page on the halls. The halls are alleged to be the most important thing on campus and perhaps they are; in any event, this page will <tttempt to make the choice of halls easier to those Freshmen who for some reason finally do decide to get their kicks under the Golden Dome.

THE OBSERJJER. 
.------------------------------------------------------;-----~~~~~~-----------------~------------------------------~ 
Mark Winings 

Golden lady, who are you? What are you? 
I've heard many stories about the men who have fallen 
under your spell. Do ,you remember any of them now? Did 
you then? 

Tell me, mother, were your elegantly covered loins ever 
moved to pulse by their Saturday night obscenities, or by 
their abject dedication to organized d:!gradation--excuse me, 
the "educational experience"? What do you feel when they 
wake up the echoes cheering your name? Did you ever, just 
once, want to try the supine position? Aren't your ankles 
swollen from being on your feet all these years? 
Golden lady, who are you? What is your name? Everyone 
who is real has a name. 


But then I know you're not just an object or some thing I mean you must have 
some passion. After all, you have been screwing with a lot of minds over the last 
century. Or is that your secret. Do you take only what you want, only what you 
need. It's perfectly logical for you to do so, but tell me, are you aware of it? I mean 
you must know that all that paper they offer in sacrifice to your army -some days 
it covers all the trees, even your shoulders-is also wiping a lot of muddy crevices. 
Some guys even do without to praise you. 
Golden, shining, blinding lady, are my questions unfair'! I don't want to 
challenge or oppose your authority, and certainly not your glory. But just answer 
me these few more, for I am about to leave and it is important that I know. 
Are you a faithful lover? Did you weep when your paramours fell writhing on 
exotic beaches, gushing your song with their last breaths? Surely you've read that 
story. They sang your praise at Omaha, mother, not Sam's. It must have made your 
breasts swell with pride, seeing the family spirit become operative in times of 
declared emergency, God, country, Notre Dame. Yes, quite a family we have here; 
so close, so interchangeable. I bet a lot of your devotees have wondered how they 
ever drove those nails through Jesus' combat boots. 
Mother, my nameless mother, it is _true. You are dying. Did you think it would 
feel like this? Are you confused? Are you frightened? H had to happen; it is good. 
Your new lovers are whole men. They have cut you deep and soon will put you to 
rest in the graveyard of craven images. You offered them your mind; they have 
seized your body. And they fall upon in midst the garbage, reborn. 
Golden lady, who will you be? I think no one is quite sure yet. But already they 
are telling stories inspired by your approaching death, and I like this one especially, 
for it can be told to children -indeed it was-without the fanfare of bugles and the 

Jerry Lutkus 

I'm a rah-rah, pure and simple. I was a rah-rah in high school 
and I guess if it's possible I was a grade school rah-rah too. It's 
evident why I came to Notre Dame. 
Now, mind you, I don't live or die on football and I don't 
cry if Austin doesn't match his average, but I love being part 
of the spirit and excitement that these events generate. For 
me, it's fantastic. I know I came to the Dome largely because 
of this. And it is this kind of reasoning that affects a good 
many High School Seniors. They really do not know what to 
look for when searching for a college. College catalogues serve 
the purpose of supplying the address of the office of 
admissions and list­

ing the necessary requirements. Beyond that they simply show 
pretty Ptc:twres 
the campus. Too many high school students do not look beyond that. That could 
be why ND comes off so good. 
Not denying the academic ability of this school, it's recruiting and the initial 
impression it gives often is the result of the excitement of a football weekend and 
the beauty of the campus. Envision a high school senior (you've seen enough of 
them here on Saturdays) thrown onto the campus in the fall. It's a football 
weekend, ND vs. Michigan State. The quad is absolutely packed. The alumni are 
flowing out of the bookstore carrying their ND baseball caps and ND sweatshirts 
and ND mugs and ND underwear. Girls are all over the place. You walk along the 
quad in your suit and striped tie on the way to the admissions office. You get lost 
because you don't know that the Administration Building is under the Dome and 
not a church. You ask someone for directions and they give you a hand. Of course, 
you're impressed by the friendliness of the campus. After the interview you wander 
around or go to the game. Later that evening, notice an impressionable dreaming 
high school senior riding in the back seat of the family car on the Indiana Toll Road 
dreaming of September 197-. 

I'll admit it, that is how Notre Dame impressed me. It's verified in that I came here to be a Journalism major which, due to certain recent developments, makes as much sense as going to the Artie for a tan. When you have a student who really does not know what he's looking for, as was my case, the excitement of a football weekend, the beauty of this campus, and the friendliness here leaves such a huge impression on his mind that he often has no doubt where he must go to schod. All the screaming about women and no social life seem ridiculous because, hell, you saw all the women there. The arguments about how dull the place is seem even more absurd because you saw the excitement of the place. The Dome can leave a wrong impression with one so impressionable. 
Since I've been here of course many impressions have changed, though some may never change. A football weekend still excites me as much as that first one did. The friendliness of the campus is still a valued commodity. But for a boy who didn't know what he was looking for, I was surprised by the fine academic standing of the university. It has proved to my liking so far. I also changed my impression of the social status. One weekend on this campus cannot tell you how lonely you can get after 14 consecutive ones. But hope lies in the future with the merging of ND and SMC appearing more and more necessary and imminent. Though it is too often viewed as a cure-all, I think it will be an elixer to many of the perversions that do exist on this campus. 
But nonetheless an outsider cannot see these facets of the university and a prospective student is more and more affected by 30 Minute commercials for Notre Dame on NBC and stories of glory in Sports Illustrated. He finds it hard to accept a students advice after Sander Vanocer has made the Dome look like super-university. It is a super-university in many ways, but it is questionable if it can meet the praise that the media has reaped upon it. 
When it becomes realized that Notre Dame has its troubles just like any other 
university than perhaps we can look at it in a different light. Then outsiders will know what ND really is and they will not view it in misrepresented terms as Leo Pursely and ND studded alumni tend to. Notre Dame is a rapidly changing university and necessarily so. For Notre Dame is completing its journey back into the world of reality and when it completes that journey it will then more fittingly hear the name of a university. 



PRESUPPOSITIONS AND 
pounding of hollow drums. One of your new lovers, among the very first to wound 
you, let it echo about the ears of children with only a softly strumming guitar to 
touch the spirit. 
He told of Jimmy, a ten-year-old far better at marbles than at geography. As few empires have ever been won with marbles, Jimmy's father knew that his son must soon acquire proficiency in th~! latter, for he would be judged a success or failure in later liFe dependent upon his mastery of the earth-science. So, though with a trouble conscience, Jimmy's father took from the magnine rack a periodical that contained a full page map of these United States. On the back was a picture of a 
man. With quiet snips had had soon chopped up the continental republic into its 
forty~ight respective principalities. Then, with an air of parental smugness, he 
solemnly told Jimmy that, until he had correctly assembled the country, there 
would be no more marbles. H•! then sent him off to his room, confident that the 
house would be free of marbles for some days, and, more importantly, that his son 
would soon know his geography --a paramount concern in any father's life. 
Two hours later Jimmy emerged from his room, map perfectly assembled and 
asking for his marbles. The father, stunned almost to speechlessness, could only ask 
how he had done it so quickly, for he was doubtfull that he himself could have 
done the chore so quickly, so perfectly. 
Without a flicker of amusement, and in the same moment as he reached to pluck 
his bag of marbles from the father's outstretched hand, Jimmy replied: 
"Why, Daddy, it was so easy. On the back of the pieces was the picture of a man. 
So I put him together, because everyone knows you've got to have the man 
together· before you can work on the country." 
Or God. Or Notre Dame. 
Yes, golden lady, because of assasins like this you will find a name, you will start 
to become. You will be real. The battle hymns your former lovers sang will be 
replaced by your slayers gentler's gentler ballads. They will not offer glory to 
Christian steel mills or Christian railroads, for such abstracted perversions are 
praised only by the idolators, only by the heralds of that other chimera -the 
Christian corporation. These bards will sing of touching, of response, of 
responsibility. Your Dow is bankrupt. 
Something bizarre is happelliing at Our Lady's institution. The steel is crumbling 
and the essence --always there-is seeping out. The next few years will see quite a bit 
of discomfort, but the result to be obtained is cause for profound optimism, reason 
for strenuous effort. Our lady must not be allowed a lingering death, for that is 
meaningless suffering -for us. 
Ed Ellis 
As a high school senior I had never seen Notre Dame. l had 
heard about the place, like most high school seniors, from the newspapers, magazines, and television, because that year was the last of the three Hanratty years. I also had the misfortune of having for my guidance counselor an alumnus, Class of '58 or so, who had apparently received a pretty good educatio:J from the place, and he eamed my everlasting dislike by pushing me toward Notre Damf!. 
The only other contact I had with the University was from the high school recruiters who stopped by my area in April my senior year. Their contribution to my knowledge of No Dame was threefold: a) Home football weekends are th greatest, b) Notre Dame is a great place for beer-drinkers, and 
c) the social life around the place isn't that bad. The sum total of that particular interview was that I should go to Notre Dame and really groove on the place because these guys were assuring me that it was great. 
I have since suspected that those particular students were Social Commission Poobahs or else getting paid a lot of money to say what they did. 
I suspect that there are thn~e periods of development in a student's opinion of this school. The first reaction is to the campus as a physical entity, and even the most cynical senior must admit that the green ND in September is a far more pleasant place for a freshman several hundred miles from home than the grey ND that dominates through the willlter. 
This first reaction usually remains the dominant one at least until the annual "mixer" at SMC the night before registration. Then the harsh reality of a 5 to I male-female ratio hits the average frosh. (Let's face it, Mr. Mooney, sleep-out on the quad or not, five-to-one is five-to-one, and nothing more or less). 
The second reaction, at least in my case, is where do I want to transfer to. Many students never pass through this stage, eventually transferring or else spending their sober hours in dismal perusal of letters from home or year old Playboys. 
After a while, however, those of more determined mettle tend to weary of the same old thing, and look for something else in the University atmosphere. To a large extent, then, one's sexual drives must be sublimated to other desires, such as academic achievement .or extracurricular activity. This is the third phase of the student opinion, combining the earlier academic desires with the sterile reality of the Notre Dame situation. 
In considering Notre Dame, one must realize that there are great opportunities for intellectual development. The science and engineering programs are excellent. The Government and English De.partments of the College of Arts and Letters are of impeccable quality. And Stud1mt Government, Student Union, The Observer, and WSND provide good, solid programs where students who are interested can develop their talents. Because of the intellectual atmosphere and the opportunities for personal advancement I will not leave this place. Perhaps even more important than that is the fact that I really like the people here, and I've made friends to last for a lifetime. I guess I expected this while I was a high school senior, but I never really thought about it. Let's face it, people around here are pretty good. 
The difference, then, betw~:en Notre Dame (and perhaps any college, for that matter) as seen from afar, and the real Notre Dame, is the same as the difference between the reputation of anyplace or thing and the reality of that same place or thing. As a high school senior I saw a school rendered unrecognizable by the inevitable distortion of 700 miles. Now I see that Notre Dame has a terrible social life, abominable weather, and Ulnquestionably terrible architecture. But Notre Dame also has excellent educational. opportunities, a great student body, and there's always the chance that things will get better, in junior or senior year. And, strangely enough, l don't think that any other University has anything better. I know that the places my friends go aren't better, so I'm satisfied to remain with the reality of

THE OBSERVE:R 
AN INDEPENDENT STUDENT NEWSPAPER 
GlenS. Corso, Editor-in-Chief John E. Knorr, Executive Editor Bruce Reick, Buiiness Manager 
Human life is everywhere a state in which much is to be endured, a little to be enjoyed. -Samuel Johnson 
FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3,1966 NOTRE DAME,INDIANA 
WE NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS 
The saddest thing among many sad things at Notre Dame is that what is probably the most idealistic body of incoming Freshmen in the country has to make a most drastic re-evaluation of man and society. 
As this is being written; four students, three legally innocent of any charges, are suspended on the whim of the University Provost; three distinguished instructors are denied tenure for unclear reasons; two drunks fight near LaFortune, and one stark, grim, reality stares us in the face: Man is depraved, and in few places does he seem more depraved than at Notre Dame. 
The next saddest thing is that the power of the University's press agentry is sufficient to pervade even national news agencies. NBC had to import girls from The Dean Martin Show, but they left 'em thinking that there 'were real live girls -lots of 'em --on the Notre Dame ccmpus. Notre Dame's relations with the South Bend Tribune is even more perverse. The University and the alleged newspaper share the same attorneys, and the publisher of the Tribune sits on the Board of Trustees at both Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
Notre Dame, then, for all you people considering attending next year, is not: 
I) A Social Paradise. Or even a social world. You don't appreciate single-sex education until you see it operate on a grand scale replete with a ratio of five to one against the available world. Men go through here for four years without dates; they will continue to do so for several years to come. 
In turn, co-education seems imminent. Single-sex education is economically unsound and politically embarassing for a Irian who heads the Civil Rights Commission, as Father Hesburgh does. Within two years, there should be girls living on campus. 
2) A Catholic Bob Jones. Despite the fifteen-minute rule, Father Hesburgh is not by nature high-handed or arbitrary. He is a reasonable man, intensely dedicated both to the University and all of this faith's highest ideals. 
In turn, this University is behind most other major institutions in terms of student power (small s, small p). The highest board of University governors with student representation, the Student Life Council, is in reality operationally ineffective, since the Board of Trustees can overrule it at any time. 
3) Anywhere near racially comfortable. People here are very self-conscious about race; among students, it is discussed as social disease was discussed among the Victorians -· discreetly and with some shame. 
The shame is well deserved. No one has yet done anything effective to bridge the gap between the two races, and nothing is on the docket. 
4) Jock. A person in search of a good education can find it. It's here. The school of Engineering is among the best in the country. Despite financial cutbacks, there are some fine Arts and Letters departments, including English and Government. 
In turn, you can set yourself up in some easy courses. But don't expect us to tell you what they are. What, then, is it? It is a battleground for the fantastic theological dialectic Mr. Winings described. It is an institution 
and a University, troubled by the things that trouble all institutions and all Universities, as Mr. Lutkus asserts. It is a great place to learn but a lot of people don't want to live there, as Mr. Ellis points out. 
It is a place to drink until you're sick, if you're into that, or watch your roommate drink until he's sick, if you're not into it, as Mr. Corso's column suggests. It's a place to get some really great lousy experiences as Mr. Cassini has found. And, as Mr. Higgins suggests with some pith but a great deal of good honesty, precisely what you make it to be. 
More than this, it is rough, competitive, harsh, challenging, bizarre, morbid, baffling. There are no gentle adjectives that can be applied here. And if you're looking for a place with gentle adjectives, you won't find it here. You'll find misery and anguish and a whole lot of distasteful and unnecessary rigamarole. Don't come.

THE HALLS 
The following is a series of subjective analyses (on an objective scale!) by select (and quite anonymous) hall members. On the scale, ten denotes excrllence, one denotes abject misery. The "Living Conditions" references mean, specifically, now easy it is to live in the hall; and it means all the intangibles-hall spirit, friendliness, &c. (As opposed 
to "room conditions· "which refer to the halls physical shape.) 

Alumni Hall

Rectors-10

Poor lighting and the existence of several forced doubles detracts from what are otherwise adequate room conditions. The resident assistants are good but the assistant rector is practically non-existent. Numerous incidents of violence involving hall residents and people from town have caused problems. However, steps have been taken this year to improve the situation. Recreation facilities within the hall are limited. Its central location is an advantage.

Sorin Hall has many individual rooms and the doubles are more than adequate. Since the building is old, the walls are thin and the sounds from neighboring rooms filter through. The RA 's and the new hall officers are available most of the time. In the past, Sorin has had a very limited social life. However, with the advent of new hall officers, many interhall activities are being planned.

Committee considers SG abolition 
by Tom Degnan 

"I think the main reason the Student government should be suspended can be seen just in the way it's structured. The Student Government is actually building itself by the way it's operating," said Ken Knevel, one of the three Senators responsible for the Student Government suspen­sion plan. 
"Once the constitution is out of the way, the students would probably have enough ba~kbone to take the activities upon them­selves. There is nothing really stating that the government can­not be structured in any other way. Many of the people that I've talked to are afraid because they think they themselves won't be able to do it. For this reason involvement and initiative would be ne~:essary on all levels." 
As to the proposed elimina­tion of the Student Union along with the Senate, the offices of SBP and his cabinet, Knevel admitted that the dissolution of the Student Union appeared to 
be  the  main  rallying point  of  
people  against  the  proposal.  
"Most  people  think  that  the  

elimination of the Student Union would mean curtailing social, cult ural and academic activities. The pooling of money on the hall level and the delega­tion of committees to draw up activities would make up for the loss of the Union." 
"People really don't have much to say now about the activities, but the students can relate back to the hall even though they can't relate back to LaFortune. The majority of the people against it don't want to put only effort into restructur­ing a new government." 

Sarin Hall Scna tor Chuck 
Ryan, sponsor of the bill, 
believes that the idea behind the 
proposal was due to the number 
of complaints about Student 
Government. 
"The Senate subcommittee 
which passed the bill thought that the students wouldn't have to elect a leader which they would complain about but that they might choose to decide on what kind of government they want. The Senators figured that the student would be presented with two options: either to say that they were satisfied with the present government or say that 
they would like to see the Student Government suspended. I think that if they voted to have Student Government suspended that they would get a better perspective on what St uJent Governmtmt should be and be able to see what they are miss­ing." 
"I'm not sure how many P.eople understand it though. I o'an't see it passing in refer­endum if it's labeled as an abolishme:nt. In either case i'd like to see a strong statement either for or against it." 
"As for the Hall President's Council, I can see the proposal touching hall government. Under the proposal the power would go back to the halls. ! think that the per capita allotment would produce neal activity in halls. 
Frank Devine, the third senator responsible for the pro­posal commented, "I probably won'i vote in favor of it. But the apathy especially displayed by the poor turnout at the General Assembly makes it a viable issue. It would be good to see if there are alternate forms of student government available. However, I don't believe that it should be passed. Putting money back into the halls will have disastrous effects. With the abolition of the Union, the halls will have to replace the concerts, cultural arts festival and other activities. There will be a heck of a lot of pressure on the halls themselves. 
"I hope that there won't be a great amount of student sup­port. I think that it1l wake up a lot of the LaFortune poobahs who've been neglecting their 
campaign promises." 

Devine stressed the fact that the amendment was not an attack against anyone in the Student Government. "This was not aimed against Rossie or M;:;Kenna. or Krashna or Barkett or Mooney or anyone else. It was aimed at prod udng the most effedive government possible. Th~· bitterness exerted by Krashna was unfounded. We never intended to harm any­one." 
Stay Senator Tom Thrasher is optimistic about the outcome of the referendum. "I think that the majority of the students will sec that there is more to be gained than to lose.

Fitzpatrick calls for Co-ed, S.G. reforms 
(Continued from page 1) 
Fitzpatrick and Secada propose is that the SBP and the SB VP sit in on the Finance Committee, the SLC and the Student Affairs sub-committee of the Board of Trustees. The other posts would be relinquished in favor of another student representative. Miss Fitzpatrick feels that the Senate presently deals with little other than the budget and the 
constitution. Under their pro­
posed system any student, inclu­
ding Off·Campus students, are 
eligible to be senators. They 
propose that candidates submit a 
50-word resume of candidacy 
which would then be distributed 
to the students. The candidate 
then has 48 or 72 hours to get 
125 signatures on a petition. 
Each student may sign a petition 
only once. Fitzpatrick and Se.cada feel that i>~ this way a more representative body will be created. 
Miss Fitzpatrick also proposes that 0-C be allowed a representative in the Hall Presi­dent's Council if 0-C imple­ments a form of government equivalent to the government of the halls. ln all this, they feel that St. Mary's ~hould be recip­rocating by placing 1\/otre Dame students on SMC committees. 
When asked about the pro­posal by Chuck Ryan that all student government be suspend­ed for a year, Miss Fitzpatrick said that the statement was made primarily to get the stu­dents to think about what the student government does for them. Fitzpatrick and Secada 

Candidate opinions about govern mental structure 

Barkett 

by Matt Cavanaugh John Barkett feels that the present structure of the Notre Dame student government is adequate and that it should not be changed. He said that one of the things lacking in the present Student Government is the administra­tive ability needed to carry out the projects that are undertaken. Barkett believes that he can supply the needed ability, by drawing from his past exper­ience, having been the President of Morrissey Hall and the Chair­man of the Hall President's Council. He also added that by running with Orlando Rodriguez he would have the advantage of working with someone he has been closely associated with for three years, while many of the other candidates "have only known their running mates for a few weeks." He proposed that a Student Government Comptroller be appointed to oversee the Senate Finance Committee, and make frequent reports of their expen­ditures to the students. He said that "the students have a right to know what is being done with their money." Another proposal made by Barkett was to limit the number of committees and boards that the Student Body President belongs to. He mentioned such bodies as the Senate and the Judicial Review Committee, a board headed by the SBP, whose · function is to rule on the legality of actions of the president. Concerning a new constitu­tion Barkett s:.tid that he would work with the Senate in their efforts, but he feels that this should not be a major project of Student Government. He said, "There are several things that are more important than a new constitution. Such ·a having better communication~with the students, and working to im­prove the Student Life Council." Barkett, who plans to use the SLC as a vehicle for the advance­ment of campus life, outlined 
several points for the improve­ment of this body. 
He declared that Orlando Rodriguez, his running mate, or he would concentrate on organ­izing the student members of the council and try to coordinate the efforts of these members so that they would be better able to work with other representa­tives. 

Mooney

Don Mooney and Dan Sherry plan many structural changes in student government for the up­coming year. According to Mooney "we will throw out the old constitution and start over." 
Mooney and Sherry stated that their "main plan is for a student association, The Associa­ted Students of Notre Dame. It would be a loose organization of halls with Hall Presidents and one representalive from Off­Campus dividing up the Student Activity fee." Mooney also com­mented that the coordinators of the Student Association the SBP and SBVP, would be "more coordinators and organizers than leaders. They'd come up with creative ideas while looking for issues of student concensus." 
"Once these coordinators get 
the concensus, they could bar­
gain with the administration 
effectively," according to 
Mooney. At other schools, Stu­
dent Associations have been 
incorporated, and these bodies 
have threatened legal action at 
the violation of student's rights, 
Mooney explained. Mooney fur­
ther commented that "the pre­
sent Student Union would still 
exist for social, cultural, and 
other campus-wide services 
under its present structure but 
hopefully we can decentralize 
social and cultural planning by 
giving more money to the halls." 
Mooney also plans to push for 
a new constitution. He will set 
up a Constitutional Committee 
with representatives from each 
hall on both campuses. Mooney 
commented that "hopefully this 
committee would work out the 
merger between ND-SMC 
governmt:nts, and work out the 
Student Association idea. 
Mooney and Sherry plan to 
continue membership in the 
NSA. Don feels that "the NSA 
can help us deal with problems 
that affect all of us." 
According to Mooney, his 
priorities this year will be work­
ing on making this year exciting. 
"This means interacting with 
st udt>nts and working on student 
problems as much as possible. If 
the beauracracy gets in the way, 
then it will be sacrificed," 
Mooney stated. He also voiced 
his hope to eliminate the Senate 
with a new Constitution. 
The SLC will only be used by 
Mooney to deal with "long range 
University pro hlems." 
feel that student government is a necessary and valuable part of the university, and that such a move would do nothing other than waste a year. 
One of the other proposals made by Fitzpatrick and Secada in their platform is the establish­ment of an Exchange Program Commissioner. lie would okay all students in the program, keep them informed as to the occurences on campus and would arrange for them to vote. The candidates feel that ignoring the exchange students is equiva­lent to ignoring a hall on cam­pus. 
Miss Fitzpatrick also feels that it crucial that the budget be decided in the spring. She feels that the time saved by this pro­cedure could be put to good use by all the student government 
bodies. As far as the actual budget is concerned they feel that they can promise the halls at least $6,000 and at most $8,000. They feel that to promise any r.10n: than this would have to cut down on other organizations such as the Afro-American Society, the Mexican-American Association and the International Students Society, and both candidates feel these societies are extremely important to the members and to the University. 



Sullivan releases changes in registration procedure 
Richard Sullivan, Associate Registrar, disclosed Friday that there would be a few minor changes in the upcoming pro­cedure. He stressed the need for a more orderly.procedure. 
The changes are only going to effect registration for check mark courses. In order to get into a check mark class for next semester one must first get a Class Authorization Form from his academic advisor. He must then take this form to the De­partment Head of· the course in which he is interested. If the Department Head allows the stu 
dent to take the course, the student will receive a pre-punch­ed caru w'-.ich insures him of a seat in the class. 
The acquisition of authoriza­tion for these courses is to be dealt with by priority according to class. Registration will be on a 
first-come first -serve  basis with­ 
in the classes.  
Juniors  will  be  called  on  

Thursday April IS, followed by the Soohomorcs· on Friday and 
then the freshmen with anyone else on the following Monday, April I 9. 
The new arrangement Is" a combination of methods used in the past, according to Sullivan. It utilizes the pre-punch class card employed last semester and the class authorization form which was used during the last semester of the 1969-1970 

Cavanaugh Hall 
Cavanaugh Hall residents elected Kevin Hansen president in their elections held Thursday night. The hall also elected Harry H'averkes to the position of vice-president, Joe Wilkowski as secretary, and Dennis Deehan as treasurer. 
The election was a runoff election held between the two candidates who received the lar­gest number of votes for each position in the primary election held on Monday. The votes went: President: Hansen: 103, Bob Reynolds:93; Vice-Presi­school year. 

It is hoped that a great deal of the confusion in the last registra­tion period will be alleviated. It should cut down on crowds since the student can only go according to his class, Sullivan said. 
He added that " ...the right people will get into the right classes."

Grande then told Krashna that the University would not finance the trip unless he consented not to work through Mathis. Krashna refused, and consequently Mathis paid for the trip. When the students returned, Krashna was fired by the Admissions Office from his position as black recruiter. 
Thus far, the strange prejudice against Mathis and the "dropping" of 48 black students from Dayton have not been explained. But the other side has a story too. 
Frick,VP, replies 
Mr. James Frick, VP for Public Relations and Development explained the administration's side of the story. To the claim that the University "dropped" the 48 black students when Mr Britt applied a financial threat, Frick responded, "There is not the slightest shred of truth to that." 
Mr. Frick explained that the University would not act so precipitously on a threatened 
loss of only $1 00,000 out of the $52 million SUMMA campaign. Secondly, he said that in the meetings with the black high school students, conducted by ND students Smith and Sims, no formal promises of acceptance were made. Thus, he said, no promise was broken. 
;;How, in that context you could think in terms of implicit promises-I just don't understand how he arrives at such conclusions...,"said Frick. 
Frick complained that Mathis was giVIng the public the impression that all a black stu­dent has to do is apply and the University will take care of the rest, including financial aid. He termed such an impression "an injustice to blacks" because the University does not have enough money to insure adequate finan­cial aid to everyone. Also, he said, if an unqualified student is accepted it may well mean that he won't be able to graduate.
