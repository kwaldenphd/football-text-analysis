Health Fair plans underway 
Plans for the Health Fair to be held November 19 and 20 at Century Center are well underway according to Dr. Douglas Barton, Chairman of the steering commit­tee for the event. Barton reported that more than 45 health and welfare agencies from St. Joseph County were represented at a recently held meeting and all were planning on participating in the Health Fair event. 
"The enthusiastic response we have received from every agency we've been in touch with is an indication of the kind of success we expect to have in the final event,'' said Barton. 
The Health Fair is included as one of the major festivities being planned in celebration of the opening of the new Century Center complex, the convention and cultu­ral facility being built on the bank of the St. Joseph River in down­town South, Bend. 
Barton outlined the purposes of the Fair as the folJowing: to gain exposure Century Center by attrac­ting the community at large to attend an event held there, to educate the general public as to the function and services offered by the many various health-related agen­cies in our community, and to provide specific services to those persons who cannot afford them.

Library plans improvements 

[continued from page 1] According to Sparks, the system will be operational on Jan. 1, 1978. 
·''It will help us handle our paper work--just make the process a lot faster and a lot simpler,'' Sparks said. 
About branch libraries, Sparks said that people often forget about them. As a result, he said that there may be plans to install book detection systems in four major branch libraries: life science, chemistry-physics, english and architecture. 
No budget cuts 
~Sparks pointed out that unlike most other college libraries, the Notre Dame library suffered no budget cuts, although there has been a lack of funds. "We're remarkable in that way thanks to 

' Fr. Burtchaell," he said. 
But improvements for the library will be urged because faculty, library staff and even students believe a good library is essential to Notre Dame. Said one library staff worker: ''The library is the most 
important part of the school. The faculty know this, and if the t d t d 't t th b t d 
s u en oesn ge e es e ­ucation possible from the books, then he doesn't get the best job."

This is the first time in recen · 
years that Saturday has been chos­
en as an on campus ticket sales day 
and it is in direct conflict with LSAT 
testing. In response to student 
concern, LaCosta was empathetic. 
"I don't like it either," he said, 
"but the whole thing is entirely out 
of my hands. The ACC and Sun­
shine Promotions are the ones who 
set the dates of ticket sales and we

A new idea instituted by Student 
Government is a ''weekend bank.'' 
This will enable students to get 
change on the weekends and 
possibily also cash checks up to 
$10. This may start by Nov. 1, with 
Mary Beth Leisle in charge. This 
idea originated, Rukavina said, ''in

Hartzell also outlined coming sports events. There will be a volleyball tournament tomorrow starting at 11 a.m. at Angela Athletic Facility. On Mon. St. Mary's will face Notre Dame in field hockey. This will start at 7 
p.m. on the astroturf behind the ACC. 
St. Mary's has obtained Mont­gomery Wards' film of the 1976 Winter Olympics which will be shown within the next two weeks. There will be no charge, but a specific date and place has yet to be announced. 

In response to the problems with the shuttle, St. Mary's student government volunteers rode the shuttle to get statistics on fre­quency and major areas of usage. 
This information will help if a decision on cut-backs in the service is necessary. Mary Ann Fuchs, Co-Exchange commissioner, thanked everyone "very much for their time and cooperation.''

Usher confiscates Murray's banner 
by Mike Berberich possible embarrassment to the stated that an initail step will be to stating that it did not encompass or have filthy double entendres. 
The confiscation of a "Murray's Massage Parlor'' poster during halftime last Saturday was the result of a University directive that 
no  banners  be  permitted  on  the  
field.  
The  posters.  made  by  several  

Zahm students calling themselves "Murray's Massage Parlor," have become a regular halftime feature in front of the student cheering section at home football games over the past two years. 
When the Murray's group stood on the wall in front of the students showing the poster, "Kick the Spartans in the Athens," a stadium usher came from the field into the front rows of seating. Approaching the students from behind, the u'>her then grabbed the poster from them. "It was kind. of a shock. This guy gave us no reasons, he 1ust took it," claimed a representa­rh e of Murray's. 
The usher stated that he was 
·unly doing his job," and was fl~llowing the University directive. fhc usher cited the "filthiness" University as reasons for not allowing signs. 
Dean of Students James Roemer stated that he was ''in sympathy with the usher.'' He added that he had issued the orders that "there be no banners on the field or on the concrete parapet around the field," after the last Southern Cal home game. 
After the nationally televised game, Fr. Hesburgh, Fr. Joyce and Roemer received a "barrage" of letters from across the country about game posters. 
''Some of them were pretty gross and obscene posters, distasteful to the national television audience and the 60,000 people in the stadium.'' Roemer said. Roemer/ has asked that student government 
form a proposal  to  regulate ben­ 
ners.  
Student proposal  

Tom Soma, Orest Deychackiwsky and John Ryan are presently working on a policy to be submitted to Roemer early next week. Soma declare that during Homecoming Week before the Southern Cal game, any banners in poor taste or with double meanings will elimin­ate that hall from competition for any of the prizes to be awarded. 
Soma said that he wants to see "a positive peer pressure cam­paign against these posters. There is no need for the double meaning in posters and it detracts from the whole weekend." 
If Roemer accepts the policy guidelines, to be proposed by the student representatives, the next step is to seek approval of the Hall Presidents Council. 
Regarding the student proposal, Roemer commented, "I'd like to pass some of the responsibility to the students for a plan to screen posters. I want the posters to be fun, wholesome and consistent with the class Notre Dame repre­sents.'' Soma commented that "rather than having Dean Roemer take signs down, we would like to prevent the possibility of him even having to do this.'' 
Roemer clarified his directive banners in the stands, but that the issue concerned permitting posters on the field or on the ledge of the wall around the field. Regarding posters in the stands Roemer said, "In the stands--fine, but I would hope students won't get into four letter words or double meanings.'' 

Roemer added that having post­ers on the field could intedere with band performances and was unfair to those who had put in many hard hours of practice. 
Murray's 

"Murray's", consisting of Mike Beaulieu, Brian McHale, Tom Mielenhausen, Mike O'Brien, Sean Coughlin and Mark Szaflarski, expressed disappointment at the University directive. Mielenhaus­en stated that they consider the Murray's signs as traditional be­cause they were permitted at every home game last year. Mielenhaus­en also added that they never try to offend anybody. 
"9ilr policy," he said, "is that the puns are rotten, but never filthy

There is always a big response in 
the stands and it brings the 
students together. Last year, even 
parents and alumni cheered our 
poster when we walked around the 
field.'' 
The usher who took the poster at 
the game Saturday was booed by 
the students. The members of 
Murray's felt that this showed a 
strong disapproval of the usher's 
actions. "We try to keep our 
posters in good taste,'' Mielen­
hausen said. "We don't want to 
rub anybody the wrong way." 
Joseph O'Brien, assistant athlet­ic director and business manager of athletics in charge of the stadium ushers, stated that the usher may have "overreacted." Referring to banners he said, "when students display posters, we hope they are doing so in good faith.'' 
O'Brien added that he was concerned with the danger of toilet paper being thrown around. ''There is a special section in front of the students for people in wheel chairs and we are concerned that they could be injured," he noted.

No ND connection with 'test tube city' 
by Kathleen ConneUy Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame has not indicated 
any official interest in a multimil­
lion dollar experimental city, as 
implied in a syndicated UPI article. 

In the article circulated this past summer, the project's designer T. Brooks Brademas was quoted as stating that the University had indicated interest in his project. However, Brademas said in an interview recently that he ''at no time stated that Notre Dame sup­ported or sponsored the project.'' He added that the University had not as yet taken any official position. 
The project, to be located about 20 miles Notre Dame, includes plans for a revolutionary system of education and innovations in indus­try and urban planning. 
Brademas said that he had discussed the project with various University faculty members, but that these were informal conver­sations, and their interest did not imply University interest. 
In July Brademas sent a letter to Joseph Hoban, dean of the college of Engineering clarifying the sit­uation. Brademas had also dis­cussed his plans with engineering faculty members. 
Brademas mentioned IU and Michigan State in addition to Notre Dame, saying that "the project needs to be tied into a first class educational institution with strength in various disciplines.'' 
In the experimental city, tele­vision monitors in the home would replace conventional schools, wastes would be recycled in the 
special  plant,  and  all  religious  
denominations  would worship  in  
one building.  

The reason for the last provision is Brademas' belief that operating a building for several hours a day once a week is a waste of space and energy. A single building for all of the various denominations would be more economical. 
Brademas said that since the syndication of the UPI article he has received letters of support from all over the country. At present he is awaiting federal funding before starting construction. Brademas added that the federal government has expressed interest in this type of project. An amount ranging from 10-25 miliion dollars will be needed for the first year.. 
The communities surrounding the already purchased site are not enthusiastic about the plans for a test tube city in their backyards. At a well-attended meeting at the township hall, the project received negative feedback. 
Brademas added, "society has the resources to solve· virtually any problem but has never corollated or coordinated efforts in a certain area. That is essentially what we would like to do.''

Poetry reading,discussion scheduled for tonight 
The Open Word,'' a poetry read­ing and discussion, will be held to­night at 8 p.m. in the Elkhart Pub­lic Library, 300 S. 2nd St., Elkhart. Community poets are invited to bring their works in any language for informal group discussion. 
The program will be conducted by Rogelio de Ia Torre, a Spanish professor at Indiana University; Ruth Cassel Hoffman, a French professor at St. Mary's; Jeanne Rodes and Deanna Sokolowski, members ofthe St. Mary's English department; and Laurie Horst, a educator of the deaf at St. Marv's. 
O'Neil to discuss law topics 
.. 

The St. Mary's Law Society will meet this Sunday at 6:30 pm in Room 161 LeMans. Karen O'Neil, Career Development director, will speak on general law topics, inclu­ding LSATs, paralegals, and law school admissions. 
The public reading is part Of a 

series entitled, "Poetry Speaks 
Your Language," in which local poets share their works in Spanish, French, English and the American Sign Languauge.

Freedom or Decadence? 
1 enjoy being with charming and inteHigent, attractive, and vivaci­ous women. Most other men also enjoy being with charming and in­telligent, attractive and vivacious women. I realize, though, that a small minority of men prefer the company of other men. However, I expect these men who are homo­sexuals to recognize their homo­sexua1ity is unnatural. I expect these men who are homosexuals to live a life of struggle to try to over­come or control their tendency. 
But at the present time some pe­ople have concluded that their ho­mosexuality is so natural that it jus­tifies in their case homosexual rela­tions with a ''sincere communion of life and love" analogous to marri­age. Also, there are those who, ba­sing their ideas on observations from the psychological order, have begun to judge homosexual con­duct indulgently. Some even ex­cuse it completely. For example, several weeks ago there appeared in this paper an article on the homo­sexual community at Notre Dame. The artide was written in a tone that att~e mpted to give moral justif­ication to homosexuality on the grounds that it is consonant with the t~ondition of these people.

Thisis ,, ::allowed campus, popula­ted by hallowed people with a hallowed purpose. For those of you who were somehow unaware of this, let mt: remind you of an article which apf>~;ared in this very space several cta:vs ago, written by noted campus theologian and philosophi­cal Poo-Bah, David Cwik. If any of you have doubts about the true nature :&nd purpose of Notre Dame, read Cwi.k's article. It literally gushes with insight about what Notre Dame can do to the mind of an ordinary man. Cwik is the embodi~ent of the Notre Dame Man, a. &~If-confessed conscien­tious Di:>6iJle of God, Mind, Soul and The Truth, a man with the courage tc reveal to the world the agnosticism of Kant and logical impossibii}; ~.' of Christian Existenti­alism. Wi:zt courage, what inspi-· ration! h: ;)tdy David Cwik could take the time to guide us. But, alas &s 1:-·e all know he must be gatherin,JI; ~vidence to crush the heresies of Darwin, Newton, and Einstein, 'he blasphemy of Watson and SJcinnPr But perhaps with a : 
However, homosexuality is not consonant with the condition or freedom of anyone. It is an intrin­sically unnatural condition. It is unnatural because it is not prompt ed by love for another. It is promp­ted only by an urge for a perverse self-gratification. And pursuing this self gratification ends in the destruction of the human persona­lity. 
Complacent toleration of homo­sexuality indicates a lost sense of man's dignity. Toleration of homo­sexual conduct demonstrates many no longer understand freedom. 
Many who do tolerate homosex­ual conduct would probably res­pond that freedom is ''the power to do what you like." However, such power to choose is not real free­dom. The power to choose what you wish to do only demonstrates free will. You can exercise your free will to do something you feel like doing, and be less free as a re­sult. For instance, you can eat as much as you feel like and the result is that limitation of your freedom that we call indigestion. 
No; freedom is not the power to do what you like. It is something much more important. Freedom is the power to become fully yourself; 
little help from The Devine Pre­sence we can help ourselves. Ifwe are to stop irreverent booing of The 
Devine Team of Notre Dame, we need a plan. 
I would like to propose the following: First, all of Cwik's proposals must be implemeted at once, i.e., all University courses are to be taught within the guide­lines of Christian teaching as revealed through the Bible, and administered under the leadership of Justice Incarnate, Mr. Triple Threat Himself, the Builder of the Holy Endowment. Second, errant professors such as Rev. Burtchaell and Prof. Larson must continue to be demoted and/or discouraged from continuing their association with the University. Professors such as these, sincere though they may be, have been the unwitting handymen of anti-chrisitian, i.e., evil forces. Their crime: to promote the dangerous belief that ND is and should strive to improve its position as a leading Academic Institution. That anyone would think ND is a leading Academic Institution is simply a kind of silly intellectual mischief. But to go further, to actually make serious attempts to bring ND to the grimey depths of academic and intellectual excellence frightens the soul. What could Rev. Burtchael have been thinking? Was he thinking at all? Look at what some consider to number amongst the leading Aca­demic Institutions: Berkley, Har­vard, Michigan, etc. These are dens of existentialists, behavoritst, and Darwinian evolutionists. People who are not imbued with the Word. Why they even are sometimes heard to claim that the teachings of the Bible are not absolute, indisputable Truth· Blas­phemy! Of course they cover up their folly ~th mutterings of 
"academic freedom," but we all .know this ignoble phrase is obvi­ously a mere euphemism for the morally bankrupt debauchery which runs rampant across the to become master of yourself and your choices. This is why homo­sexuals do not posssess freedom. they do not rule themselves. They are, instead, controlled by their unnatural impulses. And when man is controlled by unnatural im­pulses he cannot be free. 
Since homosexuality does not lead to freedom, we should control its influence. A first step would be for this paper to exercise a degree of discretion and refuse to print fur­ther articles or classified listings dealing with homosexuality. We need them not. 
"Censorship?" I can hear many you cry out incredulously. "Is it possible that anyone nowadays can seriously defend the idea of censor-
h. ?"
s tp. 

Yes. Modern man cherishes freedom as one of his highest attainments. If homosexuality 
leads not to freedom, but instead to decadence, why should we not control its influence? 
spirtual wastelands of their cam­puses. Surely anyone can plainly see that Notre Dame does not wish to be considered among the "lead­ing academic institutions." Those 
professors  who  fail  to  see  the  
Truth, that IS N D, must go.  
Third,  those  individuals  who  

consistently and/or deliberately menace the Christian character and communityh spirit that is Notre Dame must be expelled. There is no alternative. We simply cannot tolerate rowdv derelicts on this campus. One of our priests recently commented in The Observer that students caught abusing Holy ducks which swim in the Holy Lake should be expelled. This cannot be doubted. Throwing objects at these ducks, booing the glorious clad in blue and gold, carrying beer in hallways, blaring the Rolling Stones across the quads and, finally, -I shudder to think of it ­violating parietals; such actions must be severely punished. These are grievous offenses against the nature of man, and certainly fatal to the Notre Dame Man. Our memories are short. If this irreverent booing, drinking, and late-hour womanizing is allowed to continue, ND might very well attract the kind of students that attend today's leading academic universities. Where would we, who possess The Truth, be then? ­confined to Sacred Heart Church nd the offices of The Scholastic no doubt. 
It wasn't long ago that this campus was forced to endure the mockery of one who refused to accept without question the values of Notre Dame · King Kersten, doer of devious deed. Remember him, remember what he did? We cannot endure another such as he. King Kersten must never happen again. We must stand and fight. Grab your Bibles, quote the scrip­ture, and follow Truth! 




P.O.BOXQ 
Biased 

reporting 
Dear Editor: 

As a resident of Grace Hall, I feel that the facts concerning the Grace­Dillon clash were not objectively represented. 
1. 
First of all the flag was not stolen by Grace residents. The actual flag was found in bushes near the Dillon kegger by two grade school students in South Bend. The flag was also not legal property of Dillon Hall, which was not brought up by Mr. Bauer. 

2. 
The legal implications of the · kidnapping of the Grace Hall President, Jerry Castellini, were not mentioned. Physical injury was received by Castellini. Bauer also did mention that while Castellini was kidnapped, he was presented to the Hall Council of Dillon with the Dillon rector present. Obvi­ously the Dillon staff condones the criminal action taken by its resi­dents. 

3. 
In reference to the incidnet with Brother Paczesny it was a case of mistaken identity. Few of the 


· students would recognize Bro. Pazesny if they were confronted by him. In the heat of the contlict, how could a student, if indeed it was a student. recognize a Univer­sity official who did not identify himself? Was the presence of Brother Paczesny to indicate that he was in support of Dillon's action? 
4. 
No mention was made of the fact that Dillon leaders entered rooms in Grace Hall in search of their hallowed flag. Does this not signify a gross invasion of privacy? 

5. 
How much longer will the self acclaimed "a--holes of the uni­verse" be able to continue their acts of vandalism under the pretext of "hall spirit?" Don't broken windows and damaged bicycles

The above facts are just a few of the various misrepresentations published by Mr. Bauer. How does this justly represent objective jour­nalism? How can the senior staff of The Observer publish this article which places no guilt upon the residents of Dillon? Last year The Observer lobbied vigorously for an increase in operation expenses but is this the effect of such an increase? The Observer staff owes the residents of Grace an apology from Mr. Bauer, equal space in The Observer with a true representa­tion of the facts, or the resignation of Mr. Bauer from The Observer staff.

Intrinsic 

rewards 

Dear Editor: 
After reading Mr. Gryp' s article, of 10-4-77, we felt an obligation to clear up the misconceptions put forth in his letter. 
Mr. Gryp seems to overlook the fact that the band is not at issue here. There are many student organizations on campus, in addi· tion to the band, which perform various services. The people involved do not receive or expect material compensation for their efforts, but rather are driven by their own loyalty to the purpose of the organization. The reward that these people receive is the intan­gible satisfaction inherent in know­ing that they are providing that particular service. When you become a member of the Student Union, the band, or any organiza· tion, you consciously accept the "sacrifices" that will accompany that commitment. Whatever addi­tional material benefits that may be obtained should not be expected or considered deserved. 
We would like to point out that what has been referred to as "payment" for the donation of the band's time and effort is actually a Universtiy servec laden with responsibility and constraints. The rewards of being a member of the band are intangible. We had hoped that certain Student Union members were motivated by the intangible satisfaction involved with their work and not the opportunity of obtainin~ special priviledges (i.e., USC tickets). 
Sacrifices are made every day by students on this campus as they involve themselves in various acti­vities. The time donated by Student Union members does not enable them to have priority on USC tickets, originally allocated for the entire campus.

Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to both Mr. Gryp's and Mr. Childers articles on 'working''. I was a bit angry at the pettiness of the arguments which both gentlemen engaged in. The heart of the matter is not who gets two football tickets or sent to an "away· game. What is important, however. is the reason why we become involved in the organizations we are in. 
It seems to me that extra­curricular activities are greatly encouraged at Notre Dame in order to make friendships. serve our fellow students and better our­selves. It is apparent that a re-evaluation of motives is in order.

When we volunteer to become active in some organization, the primary purpose should be to help others and in doing so, help ourselves. I should hope that none of us would join an organization in order to see how many 'fringe benefits" we could tally up. 
Mr. Gryp, I would be the last student to accuse you of running for director in order to get passes to concerts, movies, football tickets or anything else. I certainly don't think you would "dip your hands in the til''. I also fully sympathize and am grateful to you for all the long hours you dedicate yourself to the N.D. student body. I myself am involved in various activities and know how much work they entail. But they come with the job, don't they? The good and the bad. And when one volunteers he always has the option to quit. 
What annoys me are people who take on a task and then complain about all the work it entails. That is not the purpose of these organi­zations. Nor are they there to buy loyalty or offer fringe benefits. They're there for personal growth. No one is twisting your arm or your associates to do their respective jobs. You should be doing them because you enjoy it. However, I have no qualms whatsoever about letting you and your associates but two football tickets. After all, you have a very difficult job and quite time consuming. 
But, fair is fair Tom. Don't you think it is also important to compensate those others who have given so much effort and time to their activities like the track team, fencing team, lacrosse club, interhall football. Logan Center helpers, SLC. CILA, ....

No flowers for security 
Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame is a private institu­tion, so private that even students can't get on campus. The circle has become a rejection route after frustrating and futile attempts at persuading the guards to let us on. "I'm sorry, but those are the rules" is the standard dismissal. The rules should be changed and made more reasonable. Notre Dame Securitv is inconsistent and unfair to stud-ents in their policies regarding cars on campus. 
One Sunday night I realized just how unreasonable the restrictions for getting cars on campus are. I went home for the weekend and returned to school with the car loaded. I pulled up at the gate at 11 
p.m. and handed the guard my driver's license to get a fifteen minute pass. She handed my license back and said "No one is allowed on campus after six. We don't issues any passes." I asked her how I was supposed to unload my car. She said '·Either park at the circle and carry it, or wait until tomorrow.'' I didn't like the idea_of making several trips to unload my 

car in the dark. But I wasn't about 
to leave my stereo in the car in D2 
overnight. 
How many times have adults 
been waved on through with a 
smile while students loaded down 
with paneling. carpet, and luggage 
were handed a fifteen minute pass 
and instructions to "hurry up, 
unload, and get the car off?" Some 
guards are more lenient and will 
'do the kids a favor by letting them on." Others stand firm, prepared to inspect the car and quote the ·University Code Book of Regula­
tions. 
A security guard who goes by the books wi11 not allow a guy on campus to pick up a date for a formal. Solution? Walk. It's not that easy trudging through the snow across campus in three inch heels and a long dress. I can remember lugging two suitcases across the South Quad to the circle and packages from parking lot D2 to my dorm because I was denied a pass. Even in last winter's below zero weather some students were refused entrance to campus to drop someone off. It was easier to stay in rather than hassle with security. 
The redesigning of University policy to satisfy both students' needs and security objectives is in order. The question of who is allowed on campus and for what reasons he is let through should not depend on what particular guard is on dutv. The rules need to be reviewed, made reasonable. and then consistently carried out.

Midas touch under the Golden Dome 
Dear Editor: 
We all know the story of King Midas who was obsessed with money. when he was given a wish, he wished that all he touched would turn to gold.

Hesburgh's desire to turn everything he touches into gold. This point came out loud and clear a few weeks back at his annual talk at Howard Hall. I felt very uncomfortable throughout the talk as Father continued to expound on how hard it was to beg 
$130 million." Maybe I was mistaken, but I got the distinct impression that he ·was trying to get us, the students present, to contribute to his fund-raising drive. 

I was sorry to see a forum for discussion between the adminis­tration and students turned into another call for gold, no matter how worthy Father felt his call to be. 
But the other day Father's touch went too far. When some Notre Dame students walked to Sacred Heart Church to attend weekly 5:15 
p.m. mass on Friday, they met with a sign that said that the Mass was canceJled. When they probed inside, they noticed a gathering inside the Chapel. Perhaps there would be a Mass after all! But when they sat down they were asked to leave the church because there was to be a "private" Mass celebrated by Father Hesburgh. Now perhaps somebody had died and a funeral was being held, but I doubt it. Perhaps Father wanted to celebrate with some friends, but why the main Church and at the standard time for our weekly celebration? I'm afraid Father's touch for gold has touched the Lord's Supper. Besides the fact that the words "private Mass" are a contradiction in terms theolo­gically, I'm afraid Father was celebrating his "private Mass" for a few wealthy friends to influence his drive for gold.

Who pays 




to see errors ? 
Dear Editor: 
To the world (and Tim Bour.-et): 
We, the undersigned. wish to respond to the remarks contained in The Observer concerning the NO-Michigan State game. Gran­ted, Rusty Lisch did nothmg to merit the treatmenl given him by the spectators on Saturda.v. Whether students should boo fel­low students who happen to play football is open to debate. We do take exception to the comments about the sports fans of Philadel­phia. 
Everyone know~ the reputation of spectators in the City of Bro­therly Love; few know the truth. These people are among the most knowledgeable fans anywhere. If 

the  Eagles  play  Hke  the  little  
Sisters  of  the  Poor,  the  fans  
respond according!.)  They  love  

their teams so much they cannot bear to see them trampled upon. an all too frequent occurrence. When their teams play wen, the noise is unbearable, to say the least Philly fans support their players. Ask Digger Phelps about bringing a team into the Palestra. Ask the Boston Bruins or the Buffalo Sabres. When Larry Bowa made a spectacular pl_ay in the field against the Cincinnati Reds, the "bush" fans gave him a standing ovation that stopped the game for over five minutes. Sparky Anderson said of the action, "It was the first time since I've been in baseball that I've seen a game held up for applause of a defensive play.'' 
Face facts, Tim. Thirty thousand people do not pay good money to see errors. There are a great many athletes who like the city and its people -they enJOY playing for them. 
Your entire article, in our opi­nion, was intended to dissuade people from taking bush, cheap shots. It is a shame vour ruined it all by doing exactly that.

THE AGE MY FATHER 


Reuerend Robert Griffin 

I tend to be ambiguous on the subject of age. I lie about it, or supply false dues, hoping to mislead people about how old I am. This year, on the October seventh bithday. I am almost tempted to be honest, mostly because this birthday brings me within two years of the age my father was at the time of his death. 
I hope it is not greedy to want to Jive as long as my father lived. He died in his early fifties, at an age when his familv still needed him with all the essential needs a family has. I hope it is not irreverent to want to live longer than my father lived, surviving into the later decades of life that eluded him. I will never be as good a man as my father was; but as long as I live, something of him will survive. After me and my brother, there are no sons to carry on the name he gave us. 
I was eighteen when my father died. At eighteen, you think a lot about girls, and you have dreams, and you ache with longing for life to be good to you. At fifty, you still think about girls; if you're lucky, you still drearr. and you are simply fearful of losing whatever sweetness you presently know. You think: "In the thirty-two years since I was eighteen, I. have laughed often, and cried sometimes. In those tears and laughter were most of the lessons your father wanted to teach you.'· That is why it is poignant to have lived as long as ,·our father: standing where he stood, feeling what he felt after the lessons of the years, you can understand the anger; the fear, the worry, and the gentleness that were his caring moods for you. At fifty, you have lived through the generation gap that separated the son from the father. Now you stand with him man to man, comparing truth and experience, differing only in the shapes and places of the scars. 
Cruelty 'is the treatment expected of wicked stepmothers towards beautiful daughters they are jealous of. But a teen age son can be cruel too, when he is thoughtless enough to cause his father suffering. AH my father ever tried to do was to provide for his family, and teach them to be decent. AH the return I made to him was to become, as he feared me to be, a thoughtless liar. Lying and hypocrisywerethe sins he hated most. My greatest lie was to become a Catholic without telling him, against his will and against his explicit command never, never, never, under threat of corporal punishment, to set foot in a Catholic church. Where was the honor to father and mother, he wanted to know, in disobedience in such an essential matter as a family's faith? How could one--with any sincerity whatsoever--sing hymns to God or communicate in sacraments in a religious tradition that supported a boy in rebellion and deceit against the God of his own father's household. 
I could have done it differently. It was not pride that caused my father anger, but fear of the self-destructive­ness (as he saw it) that I was getting myself into: a bondage to priests and superstitions and political machinations emanating from the pope. How could I see myself as he saw me: a beloved, youngest child, well-favored by heaven, advantaged enough with endowments to be a source of unfailing family pride; blowing all of it away as certainly as I might have done travelling the traditional ways of dalliance of the prodigal's pleasure cruise. I might have become a Communist; or, in a later generation, I might have become a Moonie. Instead, I became a Catholic, and it was heartbreak for him to watch me. In the thirty-two years since I was eighteen, I have seen parents grieve over offspring rushing freely toward disaster. I have never comforted them without wondering who, except me, could have comforted my father. 
Thirty-two years ago, my father died when I was a lad in the first year of college. I never saw him again after leaving home in September; I came home to his funeral in the week before Christmas. Mother said he worried, during his brief, final illness, whether I would ever make it to my dreams of becoming a priest; but he never wrote, and I never told him I was sorry for hurting him. To ten the truth, I did not understand, at that time, how I had hurt him; you have to be older to understand that kind of pain. Though we lived in the same house, scarcely speaking, for nearly a year, knew he loved me. At the train station on a September midnight--in a scene that never was, and never can be repeated--he fumbled at me with a kiss and groped at me with a hug, leaving my cheek wet, with his tears and my own. It was the first time in over a year we were gentle with each other. It was the last time in a lifetime we were directly in touch. 
This is a tale I have toldbefore, but never have I stood so close to my father in age and understanding as I do on this birthday. The boy's eyes have become the man's eyes, and middle age has brought me sensitivities that age eighteen never knew, and the realization I could have done it differently. Perhaps I did it the best way I could. Perhaps, if my father had lived, he would have lived to tell me that. In the tension that existed between us, I don't think I'm the only one who has a sense of unfinished conversations. 
For many years now, I have been at peace with my father's memory. Still, on my birthday. from whatever place in the Light earth's shadows touch him, I pray for his blessing and his prayer to God for the years I hope for that keep me younger than he was. He was so good a man, and I need all the time I can get for growing closer to his likeness. 
Wish me Happy Birthday, Father dear. With you, at least, I do not have to be ambiguous. Dear God: when you see my father, tell him I never said I didn't love him. Whatever else he needs to know of me, I think he has already heard. 
Happy Birthday, Dick Conyers. 
Eternal peace, Bob Reiman. Please pray for us. 
NICE ITALlAN GIRL, BLACK MARKET BABY 

Anne Cordesman 

Anne Marcarino is a twenty-year old junior in college. She has been innocently raised in an Italian family steeped in the Roman Catholic faith. 
When Anne first lays eyes upon the glamourous Stephen Alvright, she never imagines he will befriend her. But her wildest dreams become reality when Steve asks her out. Courted by Steve, Anne falls deeply in love and is not able to resist Steve's solicitation. She becomes preg­nant. 
Unable to confide in her family, and completely unwilling to abort the child, "·nne is alone and desperate when Steve decides he cannot marry her. Finding herself unknowingly involved in a diaboli­cal adoption racket, Anne struggles vali­antly against those attempting to possess her baby. 
The above story is a brief synopsis of a short fictional novel entitled A Nice Italian Girl. The book was written by Miss Elizabeth Christman. Besides being a writer, Miss Christman is also a teacher in the American Studies Department at Notre Dame. 
Born and raised in St. Louis, Miss Christman joined the Navy during World War 11 and was later educated at Webster College in Missouri. The oldest of seven children and the first writer her family produced, Miss Christman took a job with a literary firm in New York after college. 
After a long career with the firm, helping authors sell their work, Elizabeth Christ­man decided to embark on a new career: college teaching. She found herself very interested in helping young writers devel­op their talents. She returned to school and obtained her Masters and Doctorate degrees at New York University before taking a job at DePauw University. Miss Christman taught at DePauw for seven vears before cJming to Notre Dame. She had previously taught classes here during the summer when the American Studies Book Publishing (next semester). 
Miss Christman's interests outside of 
writing are centered around reading and 
classical music-especially opera. When I 
asked her about the difference between 
DePauw students and those at Notre 
Dame, Miss Christman replied that Notre 
.. 


Dame students are happier people. 
A Nice Italian Girl is Elizabeth Christ­man's first novel, although she has always been interested in writing. She has written and published short stories and articles for "The Reporter," "The Sign," "Southern Humanities Review," and "The Colorado

Quarterly.'' This fall, another of Miss Christman's compositions will be pub­lished in an issue of "Indiana Writes". 
In 1973, Miss Christman began writing the beginning of A Nice Italian Girl in one of her advanced writing classes at DePauw 
The students wrote stories and so did the teacher. The first part of the book was completed that semester at DePauw. Two years later, Miss Christman signed a contract and completed the novel. An article in the new york times on adoption rackets gave her the inspiration for the book. 
A Nice Italian Girl has been filmed as a made-for-TV movie. The title has been changed to Black Market Baby and the movie will be aired by ABC tonight at 8:00 p.m. 
When Miss Christman wrote her nove, she thought it had movie possibilities. She sold the rights to her book to publishers Dodd, Mead & Company, and this firm took care of the movie rights. 
Andrew Marin wrote the screen play for Black Market Baby. It was filmed in Hollywood and stars Linda Purl, Desi Arnez Jr., Tom Bosley, Bill Bixby, and Jesscia Walters. The movie is two hours long. 
Miss Christman explained that the movie differs greatly from the book. Only the central plot remains the same. Miss Christman told me that when a writer sells the rights to his/her book, he relinquishes any hold over the original work. It can be changed in accordance with the descretion of the screenwriter. 
This being her first movie. Miss Christ­man is hopeful and optimistic about it. Although not totally pleased with the script for the screenplay, Miss Christman real­izes that deviations from the original text are necessary when changing mediums. The novel must be made visual for the screen. 
A Nice Italian Girl is in hard-cover edition and can be found at the book store. The paper back edition will be coming out in the spring. Miss Christman's plans for the future include an upcoming book. Wanting to surprise her readers, she won't reveal any facts about it y~t.

Co-eds charge Yale with 'sexual harrassment' 
[CPS]-In an August class-action suit, Ronnie Alexander character­ized herYale education as one filled with self-depreciation, emotional torment and rape. 
Alexander is one of five persons fc.u women and a male professor­who charge that Yale women are subjected to harassments encom­passing everything from offensive conversation and behavior to rape. While the word rape doesn't ap­pear in the court papers, the phrase "coerced sexual intercourse" does. Legally novel in several ways, the suit names no names and seeks no damages. The suit argues that harassment is a form of sex 
discrimination and asks that the court intruct Yale to establish procedures to deal with this prob­lem. 
Procedures that Yale,claims al­
ready exist. "We're probably the 
only universtiy in the world that 
has a special harassment procedure 
written into the rule books," said a 
university official. Instituted in 
1969 at the request of black 
students, the rule states that in the 
event of harassment the person so 
aggreived can make a charge 
through his/her advisor. 
"Clearly inadequate," says law­
yer Anne Simon. "Women in Yale

professors." Simon admits her legal brief is unorthodox. By declining to charge specific per­sons, the suit goes beyond partic­ular manifestations of harassment to the institution which causes them: Yale University. The only legal precedent for such a charge is Cannon vs. University of Chicago Medical School, a sex discrimina­tion case that was dismissed, appealed, and dismissed again. The appeal was supported by HEW. ' 
University officials are con­temptuous of the suit. They admit to a few complaints concerning the sexual conduct of faculty members, but stress that it is an isolated phenomenon. One official, claim­ing to echo the opinion of many faculty and administrators said, "there is a strong argument that if women students aren't smart enough to know how to outwit some obnoxious professor, they shouldn't be here in the first place." 
Ronnie Alexander, who endured professorial "rape" because the man's opinion of her work was crucial to her future, is joined in the suit by Eugenia Leftwich, Lisa Stone, Ann Olivaarius and John Winkler. Both Alexander and Olivarius graduated last spring. Winkler, an assistant professor of classics, joined the suit because he refused to teach in an "atmosphere poisoned by distrust.'' Does Winkler have tenure? No, Anne

Simon said -just nerve. 

Dismissing the suit as "a pub­licity seeking charge and a poor legal document," a Yale public relations spokesman predicted taht the suit would be thrown out of court. At the moment, the judge has called for additional infor­mation concerning Cannon vs. U. Chicago before rendering a written decision. When asked what the plaintiffs will have gained should their efforts fail, the PR man responded with a curt, ''three months of publicity." 

Yale Law School graduate Simon laughed when informed of Yale's opinion of her legal prowess. "It'll be more than three months,'' she· said.

New York downs Royals, ties series 
New York [AP]  Ron Guidry pitched a brilliant three-hitter and designated hitter Cliff Johnson awakened a slumbering New York offense with a home run and double that moved the Yankees to a 6-2 victory over Kansas City last night, tying the American League cham­pionship playoff series 1-1. 
Guidry, the slender left-bander with an exploding fastball who was New York's most dependable star.: ter during the regular season, overpowered the Royals, who had walloped three home runs in win­ning the opening game of the best-of-five series. 
But it took Johnson's booming bat and a vital second chance provided when catcher Darrell Porter was unable to corral the designated hitter's foul pop to get the Yankees going. 
Left-bander Andy Hasler was nursing a 1-0 Kansas City lead and had retured 11 straight Yankee's hitters-when Johnson come to bat with one out in the fifth. The muscular New York DH popped a twisting foul near the screen and Porter was unable to snare the ball. 
That gave Johnson a second chance and he made the most of it, walloping a 1-2 pitch deep into the center field bleachers, well beyond the 417 foot sign-one of the deepest spots in Yankee Stadium. 
The shot tied the score 1-1 and brought the capacity crowd of 56,230-largest ofthe season in New York-alive. 
Hassler retired the next batter, but Willie Randolph singled to left, then trotted to second on a balk. Bucky Dent followed with another hit to left and Randolph raced home, giving the Yankees the lead for the first time. 
But the 2-1 edge lasted only as long as it took Kansas City to bat in the sixth. After Frank White struck out leading off-one of seven strike­outs Guidry had in the game-Fred Patek doubled to the base of the right field wall. Hal McRae then walked and George Brett bounced to third baseman Graig Nettles. 
Nettles threw to second for a forceout, but McRae's rolling block upset Randolph at second base and Patek continued home with the Hassler. It turned out to be a fatal mistake. 
Lou Piniella greeted Littell with a ringing single to left on the reliever's first pitch. Then Johnson driiJed a 1-1 pitch into left field, scoring Munson and putting New York in front again, this time 3-2. 
That brought up Chris Chamb­liss, who beat the Royals for the pennant a year ago with a ninth­inning, fifth-game home run a­gainst Littell. This time, the strategy was an intentional walk, loading the bases. 
Randolph followed with a shot to third that went right through Brett's legs for an error, allowing two more Yankee runs to score. 
That made it 5-2 and Guidry got another run to work with in the eighth when Jackson singled, stole second, advanced to third on a long fly and scored on Randolph's two-out single. 
The cushion was plenty for Guidry. The youngster, who rescued the Yankees' high­priced but often injury-plagued pitching staff during the regular season, mowed down the Royals and allowed only one runner after McRae walked in the sixth. 
Besides Patek's double, the only other hit off Guidry until a ninth­inning single by Brett, was a second-inning single by Frank White following a walk to Porter. 
Kansas City converted that into a run on Patek's sacrifice fly, and Hassler protected that narrow mar­gin, yielding only one hit until Johnson's huge home run in the· fifth got the Yankees going. 
The victory was particularly vital for New York because the remaind­er of the series will be played at Kansas City, where the Royals had a remarkable 38-7 record in the final three months of the regular season. 
Game Three will be played Friday night and Game Four is scheduled for Saturday afternoon. A fifth game, if needed, would be played Sunday night.

ing interference, but the play stood. According to Baseball Rule 7.09 
, a play is ruled interference if "any batter or runner who has been put out, hinders or impedes any following play being made on a runner." In Springstead's view, the interference had not been committed, and the score was tied. 
But the Yankees untied it quick­ly. With one out in the bottom of the sixth, Thurman Munson sing­led for one of his three hits in the game. Reggie Jackson popped out, then Kansas City Manger Whitey Herzog went to his bullpen, sum­moning Mark Littell to relieve 
The ''A'' contest followed and pitted two extremely quick and well disciplined teams. Irish Captain Tony Mendiola opened the scoring with a beautiful 30 yard drop kick that is fast becoming his trade­mark. Tom Byrne added a three point penalty boot and Mike McGlinn Sr. boosted the Irish lead to 10-0 with a 15 yard gallop 
Paul White and Dave Gamache then combined some slick passes passing and hard running for a perfect scoring play while Byrne hit the extra point. The game ended with an Illinois State try and a hard-fought, 16-4, victory fcir the A squad. 
The ''B'' ruggers closed out Saturday's assault with an 8-0 shut out. Ted Howard , who also contributed bri11iantly in the "A" game, started the Irish rolling, by

For Notre Dame women's field hockey team, this season is proving to be a rough one. Last week, the Irish lost to a solid Northwestern squad.3-0, and the group has been hampered by the flu. various in­juries and missed practices due to 
midterms. 

Despite all of this, Coach Astrid Hotvedt still maintains the disposition of an optimist. "We've been playing exceptionally well; we're well charged nd I know the skill is there." 
"But. we are having problems co-ordinating our attack," Hotvedt cited. When asked if she believed the degree of competition was intense for her predominantly freshmen squad, Hotvedt declared, "We've never been outclassed. Yes, the teams we've played were good but I think we are just as talented.'' 
The coach explained the squad's low scoring record by the fact that presently the team is having trou­ble shifting from their defensive to offensive attack which forces the forwards to have a low percentage of shots on goal. 
Saturday the Irish will have a chance to rectify their situation in a round robin tournament to be held at Notre Dame. Teams from Univesitv of Wisconsin at Mil­waukee:and University of Chicago will be competing. 
The games are scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. on Cartier Field. Hotvedt anticipates good competi­tion in this tournament and and again versus St. Mary's on Monday night. The St. Mary's contest will also be played on Cartier Field with game time beginning at 7 p.m.

Notre Dame harriers to host 45 opponents in invitational 

by Greg Solman Sports Writer 
All ears will be tuned for the im­pending pitch ... intense concentra­tion toward hearing the sound will replace the butterflies that make their unwelcome guest appearance at times like these. A hard swallow will combat the dryness in the throats of a hundred anxious men .. and the sound of"-starters gun will begin the stampede.

a new era in Notre Dame cross-country history. For although to­day's race will somewhat resemble the twenty-one that annually pre­ceded it, this may be the first time to memory that Notre Dame has had a strong chance of coming in on top. 

"We are hoping to record our best finish in recent history," pointed out Irish Coach Joe Piane, "and I'm confident that we will do well in the meet." 
For Irish harriers Steve Welch, Qennis VanderKraats, Dan Hogan, Charlie Fox, Mike Maney, Chuck Aregon and Pat Sullivan, the race will probably mean as much, if not more than to Piane. They are run­ners who by virtue of their strong performances in the first two meets of the year, will take on the chal­lenge of Burke Memorial Golf 
Course today at 2 p.m. 

·Runnning with the Irish squad will be similar ones from about 45 other schools throughout the East and Midwest. The Notre Dame In­vitational is the largest cross-coun­try invitational in the nation ... and 
generally accepted is the maxim that the larger the race, the more pressure exists. 
Veterans Steve Welch, Dennis VanderKraats and Dan Horgan have experienced this type of pressure before, and respond well in spite of it. 
In fact, Dennis VanderKraats 
24:16 time was good enough for 24th place last year, as the Irish placed 13th in the meet -but Piane will be the first to remind you that this is a diffetent squad than last year's. 
"The veterans on this squad will run better than their usual races,"

Fighting Irish football players, coaches and fans can enjoy their weekend of leisure as another Saturday of college football approaches. Last week, a lot of reshuffling occurred in the pols as two of the top ten teams were defeated. 
Meanwhile, the Irish dominated Michigan State im most categories, but only downed the Spartans by ten points. This feat did enable Notre Dame to advance to eleventh place in the AP rankings. 
Southern Cal has claimed top honors in both wire service polls. Their ranking will be tested tomorrow as the Trojans battle Bear Bryant and the Crimson Tide. In addition, number-two ranked Oklahoma will be challenged by Texas, the highest scoreing team in the nation. 
Notre Dame cannot help themselves but only observe their comrades and just prepare for their clash with Army next weekend. So, with another slate of major competition, and the aid of Frank LaGrotta, the Italian Stallion, here are the Irish Eye's picks for tomorrow's gridiron action. Oklahoma at Texas; These two opponents tied last season at six, but, the last time they tangled in Dallas, the Sooners emerged victorious. The key call in that matchup was Head Coach Barry Switzer's decision to quick kick late in the game with the ball deep in Sooner territory. Tomorrow's clash matches the second and fifth rated teams, with Oklahoma being <;tight favorites by some oddsmakers. Texas has the highest scoring team in the country, however, they have not played a tough opponent. Oklahoma proved themselves against Ohio State, but has not been overly impressive in other contests. Texas can put the points on the board, especially if the Sooners maintain their fumbling pattern. With the hometown edge, this battle should go to the Longhorns by 6. LaGrotta backs Texas by 7. Air Force at Navy: This will definitely be quite a battle between these two service academies. The Air Force downed the Middies last season, 13-3. This game will be close, but George Welsh and his fleet should be able to shoot down the Air Force by 6. LaGrotta goes with the Middies by 7. Oklahoma State at Colorado: The Buffalos are rated sixth in the country by the AP, but this ranking will be challenged as Colorado tackles Terry Miller and Company. Colorado has only played Stanford, Kent State, New Mexico and Army. Oklahoma State will give the Buffalos a major test. Colorado won last year's match up and should repeat that performance by 
10. LaGrotta goes with Oklahoma State by 6. Dartmouth at Yale: This wil1 be another great Ivy League contest. The Bulldogs, expected to be a true title contender by inside source Ken Ryder, fell to Miami of Ohio last Saturday. The Big Green wil1 give Yale a· 
related Piane,"I can say this with 
all confidence, having seen them 
run before under these kinds of 
conditions." 

However, the freshmen, Fox, 
Maney, Aragon and Sullivan, have 
not been in such a big race be­
fore, and Piane is justifiably con­
cerned with how this will affect 
them this afternoon. 

''All four of these freshmen had 
two really fine dual meets to start 
out the season," he commented. 
"But this is their first really big 
meet, a different situation. How­
ever, they did run well in their re­
spective state meets when in high­
school, and I have confidence in 
them." 

Mike Maney is one of those 
freshmen, and he admitted that he 
was "pretty nervous" about the 
race, but was confident that he 
would perform up to his capa­. bilities. 
"These fresmen have done an 
excellent job, admitted Piane. 
"We returned five lettermen this 
year and these fotAr freshmen have 
moved into the top seven spots.'' 
Of the forty fiv< teams compet­
ing, not all of ther1 will be placed in 
the strongest , ·vision (the blue 
one), where Not c Dame has been 
spotted. At 3 p.m , the next

Among stronger competition for

from Western Michigan, Michigar,

"I expect the field to be ex­
tremely competitive, a good warm-
up for the national qualifiers in 
November," the confident Irish 
mentor commented. "I think our 
finsih will be a great indicator of 
how we will fare in big meets 
throughout the remainder of the 
season." 

The Irish are presently coming 
off two strong victories over Purdue 
and Michigan State, and are well 
on their way to achieving their 
preseason goal of qualifying an 
entire team for the NCAA tourn­
ament, November 21, in Spokane, 
Wahsington. This, according to 
Piane, should be a good warmup 
for his runners, a chance to 
experience the heavy pressure that 
big meets bring with them.

Men 1S IH play continues 
by Terrence Mannion Sports Writer 

Old and new powers of the men's interhall football league were tested once again Wednesday night at Cartier Field. Pangborn fell to Dillion, 20-0, in the first game, Off-Campus bested Sorin in a protested contest, 12-0, Fischer downed Morrissey, 6-0, and Alum­ni lost to St. Ed's-Howard, 14-0. 
A strong defense and a tough playing offense led the Big Red of Dillion to their third straight victory this season. Although Pangborn had won the last two meetings between the two squads, it did not show on Wednesday. Jamie Helper scored twice on short runs to lead the offense, while Chris Pearson and Brian Crowley each picked off passes to lead the defensive unit for Dillon. 
The only bright points for Pang-
tough battle, but the Bulldogs should bounce back on the winning track by 
3. LaGrotta follows Yale by 3. Purdue at Ohio State: The Boilermakers are good for at least one upset every year. Purdue failed against the Irish and they haven't had their opportunity against Michigan. The Buckeyes smashed Southern Methodist last Saturday, but probably still are not satisfied with that one blemish on their ledger. Purdue will have to go another week without an upset. The Buckeyes should chalk up another victory tomorrow by 14. Alabama at Southern Cal: The Trojans have taken over the top spot in both wire service polls and will have to prove they are worthy of their ranking tomorrow. The Crimson Tide has a strong team which has only faltered once this year, that being against Nebraska. The game will be tight, but USC should triumph and retain their position in the polls by 7. LaGrotta goes with the Trojans by 6. Pittsburgh at Florida: The Panthers have been scoring points like they are going out of style. The Gators fell victim to Louisiana State last Saturday and will have a hard time bouncing back into the win column. Pittsburgh has been impressive after their opener with the Irish, even thought hey have not been playing the highest caliber teams. The game will be rough in Gatorland, but give the matchup to the Panthers by 7. LaGrotta goes with Pittsburgh by 7. Michigan at Michigan State: The Wolverines proved they were a championship team when they thrashed Texas A&M last weekend, 41-3. Michigan State could not mount any great offensive threats against the Irish last week and it looks doubtful that they would be able to successfully atack Michigan. The game will be in East Lansing and the Wolverines are coming off a big win, so the game should be closer than expected. However, give the contest to Michigan by 10. LaGrotta goes with the Wolverines by 17. Stanford at UCLA: The Br!-Jins evened their record at 2-2 with their victory over Iowa last weekend. Stanford fell to UCLA last year by 38-29 mark and although they will keep the game close, they will suffer the same fate again tomorrow. So, give this rivalry to the Bruins by 12. LaGrotta goes with UCLA by 10. Mississippi at Georgia: The Rebels have had a poor season, except for their victory over the Irish, which obviously they enjoyed so much. they do not care what happens in the remainder of the season. Georgia still cannot believe that this up and down Rebel team defeated them last year. The contest will be truly southern battle', but the Bulldogs should triumph

born, whose record dropped to U-2-l, were the performances of quarterback John Franko, who ptcked up most of Pangborn's yardage with his passing, and Steve Del Greco who played a fine game at defensive end, although suffering from a broken finger. 
St. Ed's-Howard dominated both the offensive and defensive aspects of the Alumni game to raise their record to 2-1. Dan Tranel threw for one touchdown, a 25 yard strike to John Dziminski, and ran for another as he directed his team to another win. St. Ed's-Howard also threatened twice in the second half, bringing the ball inside the 10 yardline, but they were stalled both times by penalties. Terry Hawkins performed wi11 at quarter­back and Mike Van Ecker seemed to be on the ball constantly at his middle linebacker position for Alumni. 
Fisher eked out their victory against Morrissey in what was probably the most defensively dominated game ofthe four played. 
Although" Fisher mounted three drives that took them inside the twenty yard-line, mistakes and a tenacious Morrissey defense stopped the team each time. 
Morrissey defensive standouts Glen Sturm, Dan Murphy, and Mike Allare were the major causes for the strong Fisher backfield's inability to score. Fisher's winning touchdown came on a punt blocked by Bence and recovered by Rocky Stapleton who took it in for six during the second quarter. Mor­rissey's downfall was caused by their inability to put together a sustained drive because of mental and physical errors. 
In the most controversial and hard-hitting of the games, Off­Campus apparently defeated Sorin 12-0. At the start of the fourth quarter Off-Campus had a punt blocked by Sorin which was picked up and advanced by an Off-Campus player. Although the referee disallowed the yardage gained, he gave the ball back to the Off­Campus team with a first down. The Interhall Sports Office has announced that the protest lodged against this play by Sorin will probably go through. 
The fourth quarter will be re­played only if it is needed to decide the final standings. In the game itself, the only score in the un­protested part of the game came on a sixty yard draw by Dave Betlack. The touchdown scored by Off-Campus in the final quarter came on a thirty-five yard quarter­back draw by Matt Ratterman.
