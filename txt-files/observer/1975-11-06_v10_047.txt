COUL proposes 'neutral space' 
by .Jill Truitt Starr Heporter 
The Committee on Un­dergraduate Life <COULl report, released last spring, cited students' need for additional in­formal meeting places on the Notre Dame campus. 
The report recommends a strong and concerted effort be made to create and maintain areas of neutral space for recreation on an informal basis. 
Dormitories are single sexed and l'lassrooms have formal and-or competitive atmospheres, ac­eording to the COUL report. 
"There needs to be a place that is not tied to the classroom or dorm." said Ellen Syburg, COUL eo-education committee chair­person. "The relationship between men and women that occurs in the classroom can be competitive." 
Syburg said that the dining halls, 
second floor of the library, and the 
Nazz are common places to meet 
with other students. 
"More places like the Nazz and the second floor of the library need to be tTeated," Syburg stated. 
Professor Ronald Weber suggested that the residence halls be more than they are. 
"All they are now are bedroom communities," he said. "They could have more congenial rooms for informal gatherings." 
Librat·y lounges 
The COUL report suggests the possibility of developing or building more lounge areas in or near the library. These areas would facilitate social interaction and alleviate the problem of noise in the library. 
Wl'ber stated that students and faculty members need more congenial meetings places. 
"The huddle and library basement are not conducive to this at all," Weber said. "The pay cafeteria is a good place." 
A place is needed where students and professors can get together for a beer. Weber added.

Dean approves 
Pink slips increase 
by John Shaughnessy Staff Reporter 
The number of students receiving academic deficiency notices this semester totalled 1314, an increase of 110 over last fall's figures. 
Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, Richard Thompson "approved" of the increase. 
The total encompasses approximately 20 percent of the un­dergraduate student body. Last fall, the total was 1,204 while in the spring the number decreased to 1,067 students. 
Commenting on this semester's increase, Thompson stated, "I would have to approve of the increase. It allows a student to re­evaluate himself and work towards doing better. From an ad­ministrative viewpoint, it gives us a chance to solve those problems which might be causing the trouble." 
The increase results from more professors reporting deficiencies and not a reaction against grade inflation or greater academic pressure, according to Thompson. 
Thompson explained that in the past some professors didn't give "pink slips" or other indications of possible failure. As~ resul!: he stated, students didn't know where they stood academiCally. We thought this was unfair," he stated. . . 
Now, according to Thompson, the policy IS to encourage professors to report deficient students. 
"We have encouraged professors to report students who are doing D work or worse," said Thompson. "Perha~s. it is ?ur ,en­couragement that has resulted in the crease of pmk slips. It makes more work for us but we're not unhappy with it. We'd prefer to be alerted rather than have the student flunk." 
Thompson also stressed that the majority of people who get "pink slips" don't fail. Some people, however, ignore the slips and decide to drop the courses in which they receive a pink slip, according to Thompson. 
"The student feels the deficiency report is written in stone. He isn't willing to make the effort to change the situation, so he pulls out. I'm not happy with this," Thompson commented. 
More classes dropped 
In recent years, Thompson has noted an increase in the. ~umber of drops. He cited administrative changes and competition for grades as the major factors in this increase. 
Thompson stated that students have been encouraged to with­draw from courses due to a change in academic regulations in 1973. 
Before then, a course could only be dropped within the first five weeks of the semester. In 1973, the academic code was changed to allow students to drop a course up to one week after the distribution of mid-semester deficiency reports. 
The extension of the time period has increased the number of "drops", 'Thompson declared. 
The problem, stated Thompson, also results partly from co~­petition for grades. If a student has a D or F average at mJd­:-emester, the tendency is to drop the course. 
"Students must realize, however, that C's, D's and F's are a fact of life," he said. "The notion that you can save an A average by dropping everything below that grade is just a little bit gutless." 
"Besides, by dropping a course, the student penalizes himself," Thompson continued. "He'll just have to go to summer school or make up the credits later. They're much better off if they stick it out." 
as a congenial place for students  
and professors to meet," Weber  
said. "And student access to the  
University Club is limited."  
Mall proposed  
COUL recommends contmumg  
extensive renovation of LaFortune  
Student Center.  
"LaFortune should remain open  
24 hours everyday," Syburg said.  
The creation of an outside mall  
and picnic area would help develop  
more social . interaction, COUL  
recommends.  
"The area between LaFortune  
and Hayes-Healy could be made  
more at_tractive," Syburg said. "It  
would be a nice place for students to meet." ·  
Professor John Houck suggested  
that conversation pits and cement  
benches be built in this area.  
"A nice courtyard could be  
created here," Houck said. "This  
area is convenient and would even  
be a good place to hold classes  
outdoors."  
Houck stated that places where  
students and professors normally  
visit should be in one location.  
"A great problem was the  
piecemeal decision to spread out  
places such as the post office and  
bookstore," Houck explained.  
He suggested that a "downtown"

Cheating, lack of student help plague Notre Dame pre-meds 
by Eileen O'Gt·ady Staff Reporter 
Is their such things as the typical "cut-throat" pre-med student here at Notre Dame? Do pre-med students actually resort to such tactics as sabatoging fellow students' lab experiments, or destroying parts of medical books from the library? 
These practices and more were reported to be the nation-wide trend among pre-med students in a recently conducted Associated Press survey. But the trend at Notre Dame does not appear to be so drastic. 
Most students would agree the main problem in the Notre Dame pre-med program is cheating. A second problem most complained about is the lack of help from fellow students, whether it be lending out notes or misin­formation given out. 
"On the whole I don't think the 
situation here is as acute as 
painted in the article," said 
General Biology professor, Dr. 
Ralph Thorson. "It occurs though, 
let's face it," he added. 
Thorson described the pre-med 
majors here as "a compulsively 
aggressive group and over 
achievers." He claims one reason 
the cut-throat competiton is not as 
prevalent here is the quality of 
students. 
''There is a tremendous urge to 
get into med school,'' he said, "but 
I think the majority of students 
realize to cheat to do it would not 
reflect their ability to be an ethical 
doctor." 
Thorson's testing policy is to 
stagger tests, and have proctors 
walk around and "intimidate 
students." Before the test, he 
announces, "If anyone wiggles too 
much, I'll pick up your paper and give you an immediate F." 
He has held the same attitude towards cheating for 20 years. "If you let the pre-med group go and don't have some control during examinations, then I think some of them would cheat. But if you maintain fairly close scrutiny, then it will be difficult for them," 

Dr. James P. Danehy 

he states. 
As a result of his policy, he claims there is very little dishonesty in his course. "So far 
this year, I haven't seen any overt cheating,'' he contends. 
Organic dtemistry 

According to the AP poll, Organic Chemistry is one of the major courses for cut-throat competition. 
In the last organic chemistry test given here, 382 students took the test at tables in the North Dining Hall. Only Professor Danehy and three other faculty members supervised the test. 
According to Danehy, their job was to respond to questions and clarify anything that came up. If students saw any cheating, they were to report it to these faculty members. The faculty themselves were not there to look for cheatin~. 
Danehy maintains his job is -a teacher, not a policeman. He claims only the students them­selves can stop the cheating. "The students can stop this cheating cold. I am inviting them to turn such people in," he states. 
Danehy blames students' hesitancy to turn cheaters in on a "perverse morality" in our society. "The students have been brainwashed. Somehow it is im­moral to snitch, but actually it is immoral not to do so," he claims. 
He cites the example that happened last year. "Four students were . reported cheating by other students and we nailed them," he explained. 
The matter was sustained by an honesty committee. It was made a matter of permanent record that they had been proven to be dishonest. Of course, they all got F's in the class," he added. 
"I refuse to look for cheating, but if it hits me in the nose then I won't miss it," states Danehy. 
Opposing sturll•ut attitudes 
One junior pre-med student thought that Notre Dame is drastically different from the schools listed in the survey. 
"The severe cut-throat tactics are non-existant here. The only problem I see at Notre Dame within the realm of cut-throat tactics, is cheating," he said. "And I think that's a problem the pre-med department can't deal with," 
A junior woman pre-med student said cut-throat tactics were more prevalent in the larger lecture classes than in the smaller pre­med courses.

Club founder looks back 
RENO, Nev. <AP) -Four dec­ades after he founded the ca­sino that bears his name and five years after selling out to Howard Hughes, Harold Smith says he is "just a has-been." 
Although he admits sorrow that Harolds Club was sold, he maintains he has no regrets as he prepares to leave Reno in search of something to keep him busy. 
"It's been an exciting life," he said. "I lived it good. I lived it right to the hilt. I'd do it all over again. Change nothing. Not a damn thing. I've lived it. I started with nothing, worked it up, worked 17-18 hours a day, and I made it. 
"I've had plenty of women. Plenty of booze. Plenty of gam­bling. Now it's over. I don't live with regrets. Time to move on." 
Harold Smith, now 65, whose club was once synonymous with Reno-style gambling, is far past the days when he once rode his palomino into his ca­sino and ordered him a saucer­ful of soft drink. 
Gone are the days of almost legendary cowboying, his freely discussed drinking, his gam­bling, his high, wide and hand­some style as the out-front kingpin of Harolds Club. 
"Too old now," he says in a loud, raspy voice. "Three years ago, I quit boozin', raisin' hell. Enough's enough... Now, I'm done. All through .. . I've lost interest. I'm just a has-been." 
Harold Smith came to Reno in 1935 with a wife. babv and $4,100, and opened a small ca­sino on Feb. 23, 1936, his 26th brithday. 
Under the stern hand of his father, Raymond "Pappy" Smith·, Harolds Club grew to become perhaps the nation's 
best known casino as "Harolds Club or Bust" billboards spread around the world. 
The Harolds Club facilities 
were  sold  for  $16  million  to  a  
New  York  investment  group  in  
1962,  with  the  Smith family  re­ 

taining management control. 
"Pappy" died in 1967 at the age of 80, and in 1969 Harold Smith went into what was then called a temporary retirement because of poor health. 
In July 1970, the Smith family relinquished its remaining club holdings to the Howard . Hughes organization for $11.5 million. 
In 1971, Harold Smith told re­porters he'd bought an interest in a small cocktail lounge in downtown Reno. He still has the interest, but he doesn't care. "I'm not a bar man," he says.

In kidnap-slaying 
Four charged W'ith conspiracy 
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) ­"It makes no sense, no sense at all," a sister says of the kid­nap-slaying of Alma Char­bonneau Hartley, missing for 13 d~ys before her body was found under a sheet of tarpaper in a wooded area. 
"Alma was just struggling to keep her business going, " Eve­lyn Barnett of Elberta, Ala., said Wednesday after the body of the real estate saleswoman was found. "She didn't have any money." 
FBI spokesman Arthur Neh­rbass said the body of Mrs. Hartley, 51, was found off U.S. 98, about six miles east of Gulf Breeze near this Florida Pan­handle city. 
"It would appear that Mrs. Hartley was killed very soon after she was kidnaped Oct. 24," Nehrbass said.

Sarnoff, 57, took over the giant communications company 10 years ago from his father, David Sarnoff, who had founded it. 
Under the Sarnoff family, RCA formerly Radio Corp. of America, was among the pioneers ofthe home radio and television in­dustries. It is now diversified into a braod range of consumer and commercial electronic products and services. 
Sarnoff's resignation will become effective Dec. 31. The board of directors designated Anthony L. Conrad, presideht and chief operating officer of RCA to become chief executive officer, one of Sarnoff's titles immediately. 
Before directing RCA, Sarnoff led an RCA subsidiary, the National Broadcasting Co. in several executive positions in­

PHILADELPHIA <AP> The Liberty Bell is not only l'racked but might be Amer­ica's most flawed treasure.

The Senior Death March, after a temporary burial last year, has risen from the dead. 
Traditionally held on the Friday before the last home football game, the bar-hopping trek will be this Friday afternoon according to Augie Grace, Senior Class president. 
Hundreds of Notre Dame and St. Mary's students are expected to participate in the event. The death march is only one of the activities planned for the annual Senior Football Weekend. 
The activities begin at noon with a pre-death march rally in the community building at Campus View Apartments. 
Grace explained, "Because so many off-campus students live at Campus View, we feel it is the ideal place to start off the afternoon's activities."

After leaving Campus View, the marchers will meet in the AP parking lot on Eddy St. at 2:00 for the Death March's official beginning. 
I<'rom 2:00 -3:00, the marchers will visit Bridget's, followed by visits to Corby's from 3:00-4:00, Nickie's from 4:00-5:00, and ending at the Library from 5:00-6:00.

In a political development, police in Barcelona announced they had broken up a cell of nine Catalan Socialists with links to a Basque separatist organization blamed for a compaign of police killing across Spain.

The physicians reported in early afternoon that a blood clot found in his left leg Tuesday night was continuing to form. They said fluid was still accumulating in his stomach, where a major vein is blocked by a second clot. 
The doctors have already acted twice to drain the fluid from Franco's stomach--once by simple puncture and once during emergency surgery to remove three abdominal ulcers.

Grace said that last week the Death March committee ap­proached the administration with a written proposal in order to get permission tousethe Senior CLub. "We were sure they wouldn't turn it down," Grace added. 
Grace expressed disappointment with the decision. "The Senior Class has continually proved itself It is the first class to go through four years of coeducation, which is an obstacle no other class has encountered. To me that makes us special." 
Initially, Grace resented the decision on the part of the ad­ministration concerning use of the Senior Club. He cited the fact that the Club is a symbol of the Senior year, and was disappointed that it could not be included on the Death March agenda. 
Grace said that after the ad­ministration turned down the porposal, his immediate reaction was to turn the march in to an alcoholic binge. But, he continued,

Death March. 

Grace said the owners were 
hestitant this year about allowing 
students in for the march. Grace 
stated that after he explained the 
changes in this year's march, 
noting the shorter hours, the bar 
owners were more receptive to 
the idea. 

The Senior class also had to 
commit itself to pay for excessive 
damage done on the premises of 
the bars. Grace said, "The Senior 
class stands to lose money if too 
much damage is done. This money 
could better be applied towards the 
senior trip or graduaton." 

Grace said he would like to see 
thisyear'sDeath March correct the 
image of marches in the past. He 
noted, "It's a good chance for 
people who have had their heads 
buried in th£ir books for four years 
to show a certain togetherness." 
Annory Pa•·ty 

Grace also discussed the Senior armory party on Saturday night. He said there will be 45 kegs of beer and 100 pounds of pn•tzels for refreshments. Music will be provided by Fawn, a group from Chicago. 
Grace stressed thatalthoughit is not feasible to make the seniors take buses to the armory. "If anyone is planning on getting really drunk. he should consider taking advantage of the bus ser­vice provided by the university." 
Tickets for seniors and their guests are on sale now in the dining halls during dinner, and Student Union ticket office. Tickets will also be available at the door · Saturday night. 
Pat Dore, Senior class treasurer, encouraged seniors to buy their tickets as soon as possible. Dore

The general idea behind the program is that the representative is a resource who would be available to the college for a day to talk to any interested students.

Colby stays at CIA; Bush waits approval 
by DAVE HILEY Associalt'd Press Writer 
WASHINGTON <AP> --As President Ford's personnel shakeup continues to send ripples through the upper levels of his administration, the State Department's intellisence chief moves ta the White HoiMie and fif'ed· CIA Director William F. Colby remains in his job tempar&rily. 
Colby, dismissed ~ Ford oo Sunday, agreed to remail'l at his CIA post until his successor, U.S. Ambassador to Peking George Bush, is confirmed by the Senate. l<'ord also fired Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger and did not ask him to await a permanent replacement. 
William G. Hyland, intelligence thief at the State Department, was llam<'d deputy director of the National Security Council, the White House policy coordinating unit. 
Ford's shakeup took the title of diret'lor of the Security Council away from Secretary of State llenry A. Kissinger. However, the appointnwnt of Air Force Lt. Gen. Bn•nt Stowtroft to succeed Kissinger there and Hyland's assignn]('nt as Scowcroft's deputy nwans the two top NSC positions now are filled by Kissinger prott>gt's. And Kissinger himself rl'mains a member of the council as secretary of state. 
llyland is a former chief of staff for Soviet affairs in the CIA and worked at the White House as a St•t·urity Countil staff member for Sovit•t and European affairs from I!Hi2 to 1975 when Kissinger tapped him for the State Department post. 
White llouse. spokesman Ron N(•sst'n said Colby had agreed to a Ford n•quest to stay on the job until relieved by Bush after Colby was assured he would retain full control over the CIA in the interim. 

Nessen said Ford met with Colby for about 15 minutes on Wenesday. The presidential spokesman did not deny reports that Colby had planned to leave the CIA post late this week but that the ad­ministration suddenly discovered his presence was needed to help handle continuing congressional probes of the agency. 
Later, Colby presided over a promotion ceremony at CIA headquarters and an aide said the director received a five-minute standing ovation from some 300 agency employes gathered for the program. 
Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chairman of the Senate in­telligence committee, continued to voice opposition to the Bush ap­pointment, saying he had spoken with a half dozen other senators who also felt Bush was unqualified for the CIA post 
Church. whose committee is conducting one of the probes of the CIA, said, "Of course, I'm pleased" that Colby had agreed to remain at the agency until Bush is tonfirmed. 
But Ford made no move to halt lhe departure of Schlesinger, who is scheduled to leave the Pentagon this week. Deputy Defense Sl'trl'tary William P. Clements will head the department until For·d's nominee, White House chief of staff Donald W. Rumsfeld, is tonfirmed as Schlesinger's replacement. 
Mt•anwhile, Kissinger denied that he had had any discussion with Ford on the possibility of leaving his Cabinet post. 
Kissinger laughed off reports that Elliot Hichardson, now am­bassador to Great Britain and Ford's nominee for secretary of commerce, was being groomed to take over as secretary of state. 

Company respects rights 
NEW YORK <APl --One of the "basic beliefs" of the International Business Machines Corp. is "rt•spet'l for the dignity and the rights of each person in the organization." 
Is this basic belief contradicted hy doing business in South Africa, wh<'re an apartheid policy segn•gates blacks from whites and discriminates against them politieally and econ economically? 
Some tritics, including church groups, tend to think it is. They eontend that IBM should challenge South African government policy or withdraw from the country. 
Frank T. Cary, IBM chairman, disagrees. "We're not political," ht• said in an interview. "We're politically neutral." 
IBM has carefully defined its position on this and other challenges presented to multinational companies-­thallenges that often are made more complex by the belief of some that no task is too formidable for a powerful business to un­
dertake. 

A distinction must be made between the activities and responsibilities of a corporation and those of a government, said Cary. "We are a business organization. Our job is to make goods and services and be a good member of the community." 
Certain critics, he said, "think we should try to change the political situation in South Africa, but I don't think business can or should take on that responsibility." 
The South African condition, he rep?ats, is a political rather than a bus mess eth1cs problem.

Marijuana rodent expires 
SAN JOSE, Calif. CAP) ­Marty the Mouse, a onetime field mouse who used a liking for marijuana to gain fame and a position in medical research, has died. He was an estimated 16 months old. 
Marty died peacefully in his sleep Tuesday at a pet clinic where he had spent the last month for treatment of a stub­born skin ailment that robbed him of much of his fur. Death was attributed to old age. 
The four-inch, gray-brown ro­dent was little known until last Christmas when he moved to police headquarters and, de­spite strenuous police efforts, conducted nightly raids on marijuna stored for use as evi­dence. 
His success at eluding police gained national publicity. Offi­cers finally trapped him with his favorite snack, but instead of being charged he was taken to the University of California at Los Angeles to aid in studies on marijuana. 

Later he was installed as a police mascot, living a life of leisure in a special cage -with all the food he wanted but no marijuana. 
There are no known survi­vors. A companion mouse do­nated to provide female com­panionship -but who turned out to be a male -died during the summer. Marty will not go unmourned at headquaters, however,. 
"We hated to see him go. He brought us a lot of enjoyment, more than people realized," Of­ficer Jim Leroy said Wednes­
day.  "He  was  really  a  welcome  
relief  around  here,  kind  of  a  
kick."

Bike registration scheduled 
Plans for bicycle registration and winter storage were an­nounced yesterday by Schaefer O'Neill and Bill Brewka of the Notre Dame Central Lost and Found Department. 
A one-dollar fee registers a student's bike in "computer gard," a nation-wide organization. Through "computer gard" a bicycle's owner can be traced 
within  minutes.  This  enables  
security personnel  to  investigate  
bicycle thefts and  to  aid  in  the  

return of stolen bikes to their owners. 
The "computer gard" sticker gives Notre Dame students another benefit. Any bicycle with the "computer gard" sticker will be given free winter storage. This offer is valid until the sticker expires, which is four years after registration. Thus the bicycle receives four years of security and

Dying 


and the Courts 
........iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii--.--uaI zurb lis 
It is amazing how medical technology in our society has ad­vanced in the past 50 years. The average life expectancy has in­creased to 75 years. Organ transplantation, including heart t­ransplants, is a commonoccurrence, cures for previously untreat­able killer diseases such as malaria and bubonic plague are universally known, and now the cure for cancer is drawing near. However, all these advances are creating moral dilemmas never before imagined, as in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan, who has been in a coma for five months. 
Karen's family wants to unplug the unlucky victim from the respirator that has been keeping her alive, but the doctors decided against it because they feared legal repercussions. The Quinlans brought the case to court, and the final decision could affect hun­dreds of people in positions where they cannot personally com­municate their will to live or die. 
The Harvard Medical School has come up with a definition of brain death that has already been adopted as law in eight states. When the brain is declared dead (as opposed to the heart) vital life organs can be removed and transplanted into another individual. Now that patients can be kept alive indefinitely by artificial means, another definition of death may be needed. If there is a statutory definition of death doctors are bound to follow it by law until that law changes or possibly face the cost of a malpractice suit, or perhaps even a murder charge. 
But the real issue in Karen's case is not when death occurs, but whether she has a chance for a meaningful life. 
Itis very difficult for anyone to decide this, and it is questionable whether the patient has the right to decide his ownlife'svalues and possibly terminate his own life. People wishing to die are not thought to be in their "right mind" and near-suicide victims are labeled mentally unstable. After all, the will to survive is the basic instinct in all people and no one should want to stop living. But is it living or existing that is in store for the person? There are patients who cannot state whether they wish to be kept alive or allowed to die: such as deformed babies or those, like Karen, being kept alive unconsciously in a vegetative state. There are also the elderly who would rather die and be out of theirmisery than to suffer the pains of disease. 
Who decides if the life will be meaningful? The doctor? The family? Or possibly it will be the court? The court decision in Karen's case will be made soon and it will effect similar cases in 
Lue future.Should Karen be actively unplugged or be left to die if she 
contracts a disease, which is highly likely in her weakened condit­ion? Or should every effort be made to save her life with the hope she will come out of the coma and recover to lead a meaningful life? 
I certainly don't know the answers to these complicated questions. Itcannot be avoided that as one gets more power he will eventually face more touchy moral problems. When people are in a dilemma about a situation, it usually ends up that the courts decide what should be done. But highly moral cases such as Karen's, are unique and one law cannot possibly handle all the circumstances surrounding it. 
The cold impersonality of the law is no substitute for a lov-ing family that is genuinely concerned about the individual involved. Sometimes a guide is needed to help people make decisions and here I think is where the legal system can help, but I do not think that the courts should make the final decisions. Also, a doctor may be afraid to take action in a particular case because the law may find him a criminal accused of murder or malpractice. 
Maybe it is time to not let such emotional cases be brought to court and not let the law put such pressures on the people involved. The morality of the issue should be stressed in the best interests of the patient and the legal implications should be secondary.

little feat: working on their destinies 
gregg bangs 

When thinking of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the emphasis is usually put on Stephen Stills and Neil Young. After all, 
('rosby. Stills, & Nash was produced and practically designed by Stills while Deja Vu was enhanced by the mysterious presence of Young. In between their original break-up and the recent national tours, Young has made the more suc­cessful solo albums (especially Harvest) while Stills had a brief stint with Manassas in between a couple of solo albums. CSNY was supposed to come out with a fourth album, titled after Young's "Human High­way." but the record was never recorded and Stills and Young went back to solo careers. The idea o( getting CSNY back together was dismissed in favor of reorganizing Buffalo Springfield, of which Young, Stills and Richie Furay (among others l were a part of. In between all this, Graham Nash and David Crosby have not simply been waiting for Stills and Young to join forces with them. Both of them pursued solo careers. but always on the premise that they'd save their best songs for CSNY-~a promise the group made to themselves m regards to solo albums. Nash's first album, Songs for Bl'ginners sold fairly well and received favorable reviews while Wild Tales. his second, did not get any publicity and did terribly, even though it was just as fine an album, if not better, than the first. Nash also picked up a reputation as being one of the finest backup vocalists in the recording industry. Crosby also had a few solo attempts but they did not sell well. He and Nash had made an album together earlier and en­joyed working and touring together, so after the latest CSNY break-up, they decide to get back to "just us two retread folkies" and go it alone as Crosby and Nash. They quit the Atlantic label who considered them "the remnants of CSNY" uccording to Crosby, and joined ABC which is regarded as an up and coming label. 
They also collected a back-up band 
comprised of some of the most respected session musicians in L.A. Included were Russ Kunkel on drums, Lee Sklar on bass. Craig Doerge on piano and Danny Kort­chmar on guitar. Throw in James Taylor and Carole King on background vocals and the two folkies produced a fine album titled Wind on the Water. 
notes from italy 
Leavmg Rome is almost as exciting as entering it; one leaves behind a Gestaldt that is almost as brutal as it is beautiful. 
In contrast to the churches, piazzas and Homan Ruins lay simultaneously the in­cessant inceasable noise, the unsanitary and narrow streets, a dearth of green space or even living soil, and a ridiculous density of human beings characteristic of almost metropolis. 
To the east of Rome lay the Appenine mountains, which rest still and calm upon the crust of the boot-penin$Ula, inhabited but not indisturbed, non-idols they are. f<:ven so. they still did not seem to be unaware of our presence, one day in Oc­tober. 
We, (a ND-SMC delegation of 23) looked very much like rabbits when we left <sleepy-eyed and bushy-tailed at such an ungodly hour one Saturday morn) and wet cocker spaniels upon our return, at the end of the day. 
Nonetheless, the story we told was a good one, and were not unseen by the friendliest fate. 
We set out on our monumental foot hike from the tiny village of Saracinesco (which we had reached by the only bus t­hat climbs the winding road to the lop of the summit, where , where centuries before wanderers had decided to settle). 
Saracmesco is somewhat reminiscent of the small town in Antonini's "The Passenger". The streets, strictly pedestrian, are mostly empty, save for maybe a native woman walking to and 
The trademark of Crosby & Nash has always been their harmonies and this record does nothing to tarnish that reputation. The two seem to perfectly 
•compliment each other :Nash with a high, fragile sounding voice. blends easily with Crosby's deeper, harsher sounding delivery. Perhaps the shining example of these harmonies is found on the last cut. "To the last Whale" starts out with Nash, Crosby . and Taylor singing what sounds like a church choir song. The song then moves into "Wind on the Water" which is beautifully sung by the three. It would almost appear to be a ballad, instead of the protest song against the killing of whales that it is. Nash has a tendency of writing cutting protest lyrics and turning them into very appealing, pleasant song. ("Military Madness" is another example). 
The presence of lush orchestration also adds to the almost mystical quality of the song. This orchestration is evident throughout the album and gives the songs a deeper quality as compared to those on Graham Nash-David Crosby, their first album, which almost seems simplistic in comparison to Wind on the Water. 
Combine the harmonies, orchestration, and back-up band with some fine new songs and the album almost gives Crosby & Nash a separate musical personality after just one recording. 
David Crosby's "Homeward Through the Haze" is a fine example of this com­bination. Crosby drives his lyrics home with a very forceful vocal with fine har­monizing by Nash and King. Craig Doerge adds some interesting work on electric piano which compliments the lead guitars of Crosby and Kortchmar. 
Other notable cuts include: Graham 
Nash's "Cowboy of Dreams" which has a 
country-rock approach that is highlighted 
by David Lindley's fiddle, and Crosby's 
"Carry me," which was supposed to be on 
CSNY's ill-fated fourth album. 
Wind on the Water is a step forward for David Crosby and Graham Nash. They have, as will be readily admitted by both of them, put visions of CSNY behind them and started to work on a new group and a new image. They might not ever be able to completely escape the aura of CSNY, but this ablum certainly shows that they are more than the other half of the now defunct supergroup. 
Little Feat is the group that stole the show from the Doobie Brothers last year on Warner Brother's European publicity tour. Although they have not really progressed past cult status in this country, Little Feat drew packed houses and rave reviews in Europe. 
It's a good thing they did too, for if this band didn't get a break soon, they very easily might've broken up for the last time. Since 1970, Little Feat has had an incredible nember of dissolutions and personnel changes. However, under the leadership of guitarist-producer Lowell George, they keep coming back. 
Dixie Chicken was the first album of theirs to gain any sort of audience and it found its way to the more progressive FM stations. After a brief break-up, George and keyboard man Bill Payne got the group together again to record Feats Don't Fail .Ml' Now which got a lot of air play, favorable reviews and decent sales-­considering most people still didn't know who or what a Little Feat was. 
The two songs that got most of the air play off the Feats album were George's title cut, "FeatsDon't Fail Me Now," and Payne's "Oh Atlanta." 
The group consists of George and Paul Barrere on guitars and vocals, Payne on keyboards and vocals, Ken Gradney on bass, Richard Hayward on drums and vocals, and Sam Clayton on congas and other assorted percussion instruments. These six have been together since Dixie Chicken and have probably made their best overall recording with their latest release, The Last Record Album. 
One of the main reasons for this is that everybody in the group is now making contributions whereas George and Payne used to dominate the writing and production ends of the • recordiQg . George still produces the album, but Barrere and Gradney contribute to the writing while the percussion section of Clayton and Hayward are heard more in this album (also used more effectively to boot) than in previous ones. 
, 

a walk '" the countr~ 
trom the only store, and a a man walking with a pair of mules, whose cries reak up an imposing silence within the valley below on the slopes. 
The north wind had brought a greyish white mist and an early morning autumn sky that was neither threatening nor at ease. 
When we were all gathered, the man and his beasts had moved on down the road apiece. The elderly women left the store and walked off with one newly-bought box of cookies which I had left unattended. We could all feel her staring out of a window when we passed by the building she had crawled into. 
The leeward side of the ridge we were eventually to cross and then retuen, was rather warm. We followed horse trails, lined with maneur, fromerly belonging to horse, cow and mule. Though burdened we were guided and reletively secure, knowing that at least animals had taken our course before, if not wayward wan­derers. 
We did, though, lose our way, kinda-sort of. We followed cattle paths which led to dead ends, at least for people-types like ourselvPs. For sure we lost the time of 
day, because the sun had been made in­visable by the haze, because we were too preoccupied with clever footwork and logical-illogicla pathfinding to pay at­tention to our watches, and because we had lost the need for time. 
Perched upon a lofty rock, we viewed the approach of winter: dark grey clouds, prophesized by a sudden chill, and the frightening silence of impending turmoil. By the time we crossed the ridge, the clouds burst softly, continously. 
Stepping aside, it became obvious to me, after several pensive moment that at one point in time there was a spontanious diffusion of man: into cave dwellers and rural folk-the former being mostly amorphic and egocentric builder, the latter is truly geomorphic, more responsive to nature. 
The absence of the necessities of the egocentric culture (i.e. time, artificial environment, complex economics) un­derlines this diffusion of life styles. Psychology and sociology, vital elements of city life are undefined by the inhabitants of isolated valleys and countrysides. In the city, there is technology, the con­centration on superficial ideals, the great agression-regression syndrome, a rapid 
pace. In the country, all these are lacking, including, however, much activity in general. 
But as we approached Saracinesco through a long valley, I noticed an old man and little girl, sitting in the midst of an edificial oblivion, beneath an umbrella, and not too concerned about fleeing from t­he rain which is so harsh upon concrete and asphalt and those who walk upon them. 
This scene, so void of movement, still was a more energetic arousal of my spirited emotions than celluloid and un­natural sensations attributed to life in the big city. 

"Romance Dance," the first cut on the album is a typical Little Feat effort. The song progresses at a medium fast pace with the percussion section and Gradney's bass keeping a steady beat. George's lead is steady throughout while Barrere keeps his slide guitar shooting in and out and Payne takes solos on a few . keyboard instruments. However, the Little Feat trademark is their ,,ocals. Everybody in the group has a low, gravel-edged voice that could tend to annoy people who like clear, straightforward voices. However, the effect is quite catchy and the vocals can sound simultaneously like soul, reggae or straightforward rock. Combine this with the heavy beat--always danceable nature of their faster tunes and there is a verv distinctive quality to their songs. 
B.ill Payne, who at one time nearly joined the Doobie Brothers, takes the Little Feat sound one step further in "Day or Night", where, backed by the rythym section, he gives a moog solo that sounds like something out of Weather Report. 
George wrote three songs on the album, which is a small number for him. However, the !Songs are distinctive which is something his earlier efforts tended not to be. "Down Below the I Borderline" is a fine example of his production work. All the tracks mix well, especially Payne's keyboards and Barrere's slide. "Long Distance Love" is a very slow paced, bluesy tune that is enhanced by George's gutsy, emotional vocal. Valerie Carter and Fran Tate give some fine background vocals to compliment George. George also writes the liner notes and they are a true test of anybody's concentration--if one can read them straight through, then anything will seem easy. 
George said the European tour gave the 
group impetus to put out a fine album, and 
go on tour in the U.S. Little Feat has ac­
complished both those goals for they just 
finished a successful tour and The Last 
HPcord Album is their best to date. 
Hopefully, the title cut doesn't mean 
anything because this group is getting better every recording

The last hours of the day were the most precious and summoned the journey's end. 
Approaching Saracinesco again was an event pinched from a fairytale. The loft was Oz, or Chartre Cathredral (thus we be pilgrims) or some Italian Shangri-La. It was then when we were completely blanketed by a late afternoon fog. We lost sight temporarily, and we were isolated even from each other. 
Soon we were upon a farm just below the village, the fog having moved along on its way. Oz was closer and closer than ever before but we realized twas neither glitter nor gold that it was made of. It was stone, mellowed with time, savourly rich in a histrory of complacence, harmony, and a string of worn out phrases all defining the true spirit of a congrous adaptation to environment. 
Pathetic and tempest torn we looked as we gathered in the town square. We drew the attention of a very kind priest who saw our discomfort and invited us in his rec­tory for home-made wine and cookies and a warm fire. Afterwards, we extended a damp but cordial version of Notre Dame gratitude, saying goodbye to the good samaritan and friend. 
We left all this behind, half willingly and half reluctantly, thinking it might be good to be back home, so foreign and foresaken as it may be. 
The day had slipped behind us somehow, despite our efforts to make it endure longer. Indeed it had been, for tomorrow we were to fight the city again, and time.

Pennsylvania ci 
elects four women to city council 
SCHWENKSVILLE, Pa. (AP> -­This small Philadelphia suburb, :ong run by a steadfastly Republican borough council, has elected a new council majority-­four members of the "Women's Party." 

The four women, who say they are definitely not women's libbers, defeated four Republican men, including three incumbents, in Tuesday's election. The women now control the seven-member council. 
Elizabeth Shellenberger, a 34­vear-old Western Electric assembly line worker and mother of two, said the party's platform was based on providing a two­party system for the town and had nothing to do with feminism. 
··we got involved in this just for our town," she said, novng that Schwenksville Democrats didn't even bother to nominate can­didates for the four council seats up for election. 
Schwenksville, population 6,000 and 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, has about 90 Democrats among the town's 440 registered voters. 
''It got to the point where it was really an unhealthy situation," Mrs. Shallenberger said of the uncompetitive political balance.

Mrs. Shellenberger sounded pretty much like a seasoned politician when asked what cause her party embraced, if not. feminism. ~ "We want to give the town back to all the people. Let their voice be heard," she said. "We want to make council meetings where they will want to come and will be treated with respect." I

The United Farm Workers of America are sponsoring a march and rally on Saturday, November 8, at 11 a.m. in Chicago to protest unfair labor practices by the Jewel Food Stores chain. 
Los Desparraigados, a Mid-West Council ofLaRaza publication, also reported that the Jewel Food Stores chain, the 6th largest in the country, was petitoned by the UFW to use its immense power to con­vince the growers to allow fair elections and to sign contracts. As a result of Jewel's refusal to help, UFW and the AFL-CIO have organized Saturday's march and rally. 
Ricardo Pane, a spokesman tor the Mid-West Council of La Raza, Inc., stated, "We will have a caravan leaving from South Bend on Saturday morning. We will assemble at the Mid-West Council 

Open committee policy adopted 
WASHINGTON <AP) -The Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to require for the first time that all its committee meetings be open to the public. 
The 86-0 vote was a major victory for advocates of "gov­ernment-in-the-sunshine" legis­lation, who will now move to get a similar open-meeting re­quirement adopted for many federal agencies. 

The Senate approved a reso­lution by Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., to require all meetings to be open unless a majority of committee members votes to close them. 
Such a vote would have to be taken in open session, however, and committees could only be closed for narrowly defined ex­emptions -such as matters that relate to national security. 

By an 81-6 vote, the Senate also agreed to extend the open­meeting concept to House-Sen­ate conference committees named to work out differences in bills passed by each cham­ber. 
The House already had agreed to open conference com­mittee. 
All House meetings currently are open unless committee members vote to close them. But in the Senate, business meetings are considered closed unless a committee votes to open them. 
A second measure_ by Chiles, which is cosponsored by more than 50 senators, is scheduled for Senate debate Thursday. It would prohibit most closed-door sessions by some 49 federal agencies, boards and commis­sions. 
Earlier, the Senate rejected, 77 to 16, a proposal by the Sen­ate Rules Committee that would have, in effect, allowed committees to set their own rules on whether to conduct business in closed open ses­sions.

The publication continues in stating that the growers are not allt;wing farm workers organizers access to the camps while Teamsters have full reign. 
"While farm workers attempt to vote, the growers are also casting their ballot through mass firings, counting the ballots of non­farm workers (security guards--at Gallo, 27 security guards voted), threats, intimidations, payroll padding, massive recruitment of new unaware work forces and not coutning the votes of farm workers who have gone on strike with the UFW."

Specialty teams getting their kicks 



by Fred Herbst 

The specialty teams play an important role on any football team. And the Notre Dame 
specialty teams are proving their importance. While the offense has been sputtering, the specialty teams have (jon~ consistently well and have given the Irish the ball in excellent field position for most of the season. 
The special teams include: punt block, punt return, punt, kickoff, on-side kick, kickoff return, field goal and extra point teams, any or all of which can be vital in a game. 
Head Coach Dan Devine realizes 
the importance of the specialty 
teams. "He believes in specialty 
teams and it's been passed on," Ed. 
Chlebek, specialty teams coach, 
said. "We've been working hard 
on them and the players really ' 
believe in them." The Irish work 
on each of the specialty teams 
everyday in practice. 
Each of the specialty teams has 
a number of set plays. For 
example, on kick returns, each 
blocker has a specific assignment 
in order to open a particular hole 
for the ball carrier. On punt 
returns, each player has a specific 
assignment in order to set up a 
wall along the sidelines for the 
return. Every play executed by 
the specialty teams is a designed 
play. 
But of all the aspects of special 
team play, none is more familiar to 
Notre Dame fans than the punt 
block. In the past two games, the 
Irish have managed to block three

The fall practice season is over for the Notre Dame baseball team and new head coach Tom Kelly is very happy with what he saw. "I was really pleased with the at­titude of our players. They worked hard all fall and did a lot of good things." 
Coach Kelly, who has a reputation as a super organizer, put together a tourney dividing his squad of over 60 hopefuls into four teams. "This gave me a chance to look over everybody under game conditions and gave the players a chance to sharpen their play in 
Pep rally Friday 
The pep rally for the Georgia Tech game will take place Friday night, at 7 p.m., in Stephan Center. 
The last football rally will have Head Coach Dan Devine, Coaches Ed Chlebek & John Roland, and co­captains Ed Bauer & Jim Stock as the speakers. 
The band will step off at 6:40 from Washington Hall and request all bikes be removed from their path. 
punts <including one against Southern Cal that was called back>. 
"We work a lot on the punt block," Chlebek said, "and we know that we can do it. So we're taking some chances, but they're good chances." 
The Irish have five different plays that they use in trying to block a punt. The play used depends on a weakness exhibited by the other team. 
Chlebek pays particular at­tention to films of upcoming op­ponents in search of a weakness. "The films are generally helpful," he said. "We look for things like the snap from center, the amount of time the kicker takes to get the ball off and for areas in the line where blocking might break down." 
Chlebek stressed the 
significance of the specialty teams 
but added, "You have to 
remember that this is a team 
game. The specialty teams can't 
win or lose ball games." 
"Our major concern is with field 
position," he said. "On a kickoff 
we want to stop our opponent at the 
20 and on a punt we want to prevent 
a return. Our job is to give our 
offense the best possible field 
position and keep the other team's 
offense in the worst possible field 
position." 
The specialty teams do more 
than just help the team, they 
provide a number of second team 
players with an opportunity to 
play. Jim Weiler, John

The Wolfpack <Don Wolfe) 6-6 
The Fighting Irish (Jim Sholl) 5­
7 
The Hustlers (Mitch Stoltz) 5-7 
"I think we're going to have good pitching," commented Kelly in what may be an understatement. Notre Dame had a fine staff last year and every pitcher returns plus freshman Mike Bobinski who was 3-1 this fall and Marty Serena 3-2 this fall after a year in Rome. 
Hitting may not be as big a problem as graduaton losses suggest. A pair of freshmen, shortstop Rick Pullano and out­fielder Dan Monroe both hit over .350 and returnees Mike Galloway, Bob Stratta, and Mitch Stoltz all had good autumns with the bat. A number of players who saw limited action with the Irish in the past-­Frank Fiascki, Jim Abbatiello, Dave DeFacci, Dave Lazzeri and Jose Alonso--all hit .300 or better and appear ready to step in.

Both The snap was low and Griffin had Pangborn and Dillon came into the trouble getting it down. This was game high as a kite but it was the all the opportunity that lineman Pangborn "Violence" defense Gary Hankemer needed as he which rose to the occasion, stormed through the line and blocking an extra point attempt by blocked Holroyd's kick to give Dillon, as Pangborn defeated Pangborn their margin of victory.

At the beginning of the second quarter Dillon punted from their own end zone and the ball was fielded by Tony Miller. Miller was hit hard though and Dillon recovered on the' 38. Dillon quarterback Bill Griffin struck quickly with a 48-yd. strike to Larry Jurkens and the Big Red had first down at the 12. The Pangborn defense held and Dillon lined up to attempt a field goal. The play was designed to be a fake with holder Griffin throwing a pass to Jurkens. 
But confusion about the call and the line up resulted in a time out and a delay of game penalty. Finally, Tim Holroyd did attempt a 35 yd. field goal but itwas wide to the right. 
Dillon got another chance just minutes later as the snap on an attempted punt by Pangborn flew over punter Mark Witkowski's head. He recovered the ball but was tackled on his won 20-yd. line. Dillon took over but their drive st­alled as time ran out in the first half. 
Dillon began the second half with their only sustained drive of the game. They marched down the field behind the running of Lou Brien and the passing of Griffin. Brien took the ball in for the score through a mammoth hole in te left side of the line' from 2 yards out. Dillon trailed 7-6 but it was that one point which made the difference.·

Until this year, Notre Dame's specialty teams were more widely known for their failure to contain Anthony Davis of Southern Cal than for their excellent play. But with a new-found emphasis, the specialty teams have developed into one of the most essential and successful parts of the Irish team. 
guys," said Pangborn coach Jeff Jeffers. "Our defense was the backbone of our team all season and they came through for us again. I'm really looking forward to playing Keenan." 
The vaunted "Violence" defense was led by the superb play of linebacker Bob Dalpos, nose guard Witkowski and end Jay Van Heyde. 
Their hard hitting inside and their wide pursuit continually shut down the Dillon ground game. 
After the game, the Dillon bench was the scene of many dejected faces, but they were proud faces. Coach Paul Linehan expressed the same pride in his club that Jeffers did. 
"I'm really proud of this team. They worked their butts off to get here tonight and it wasan honor to play in this game," he said. "You have to remember that this is not the overpowering Dillon team of past years. These guys started fresh and had to work hard to get here and that's why they're so disappointed right now." 
For Dillon, it's looking toward next season but Pangborn must take on undefeated Keenan on Sunday afternoon at' Cartier Field

Cullens, Tom Maschmeier, Mike Carney, Terry Eurick and Pete Johnson play on all of the specialty teams. "These guys play on every single team and they play well," Chlebek said. "There's nothing easy about their jobs, they deserve a lot of credit." 
Reserve fullback Steve Orsini is happy to have the opportunity to play on the speical teams. "All I really want is to help the team the best way I can," he said.''Besides, 
I see it as a chance to show my ability to the coaches and try to make the first team." 
"The specialty teams are very important. They're a big part of the game," said reserve halfback Terry Eurick. "They give a lot of the subs a chance to play and it's fun, plus they give you the chance to help the team." 
The specialty teams are often neglected, but nonetheless are an important part of any team. They
