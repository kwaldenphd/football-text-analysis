Board responds positively to Lao's report 

Topics include drunk driving, social responsibility and programming fund 
By SHELIA FLYNN 
News Writer 
Members of the Board of Trustees responded to a student government report Thursday with positive enthusiasm and a round of applause, congratulating student body president Jeremy Lao and his team for their accomplishments and their efforts to address Board criticisms given in October. 
Chief of staff Patrick Corker began the presentation, outlining student govern­ment's alcohol responsibility campaign. lie said the effort will include the distribu­tion of blood alcohol content cards, speak­ers and a drunk driving simulator machine during the week before spring break, and an advertising campaign encouraging students not to be "that guy" or "that girl" in regard to excessive consump­tion of alcohol. 
"Students on campus would benefit from knowing what their limits are," Corker said. "I don't think stu­dents are cognizant of 


that."  Lao  
Lao  and  his  team  
emphasized  - and included in their  

report -that the campaign promotes responsible drinking and in no way tries to impose abstinence from alcohol upon students. Instead, their initiative focuses on collaboration with local establish­ments, cab companies and other institu­tions to ensure designated driving and responsible behavior. 
The Board applauded the plan, which is 

in-depth and multi­faceted. 
"This is only a transi­tional student govern­ment, but this initiative is a first from student government," said Father Mark Poorman, vice president for stu-

Poorman dent affairs. 
The other Board members expressed approval and also voiced additional suggestions, such as cooperative planning with Notre Dame Security/Police and other bodies. Several members also expressed concerns about ensuring the continuity of such an alcohol responsibility program from year to year within student government. 
"I can't imagine that there would be an administration that wouldn't want to pur­sue this," Corker said. 
Building upon the administration's emphasis on responsibility, Student body vice president Emily Chin then addressed the Board concerning social responsibility at Notre Dame. She outlined student gov­ernment's role in the Church in Africa conference and showed a short video of Notre Dame students, including herself, visiting Nigeria as part of the conference. 
"Americans don't really see the true, other side" of Africa, Chin said, citing the continent's "hospitality," "beauty" and "rich culture." She stressed student gov­ernment's commitment to social responsi­bility and said she hopes for increased awareness on campus and continued par­ticipation in events such as the Africa con­ference.

Campus Ministry gets creative with retreats 
By MATTHEW SMEDBERG News Writer 
It begins at Freshman Orientation, with posters on res­idence hall bulletin boards advertising the Freshman Retreat. It continues with the Notre Dame Encounter and the Sophomore Road Trip. If you are a senior, man, woman, Asian, black, Latino, MBA student, gay, lesbian or bisexual, Campus Ministry has a retreat for you. 
Campus Ministries offers retreats throughout the year attracting about 3,200 students, or more than a third of the undergraduate population. Each retreat is unique, according to Father Kevin Russeau, director of freshman retreats. Russeau said that the retreats do not contain a set format, though certain elements appear in all, such as presentations by the retreat director and his or her assistant leaders, as well as ice­breakers and small group dis­cussions. 
The retreats vary widely in length, size and scope. A fresh­man retreat, offered six times a year, lasts 26 hours and can accommodate up to 90 partici­pants. The Man's Weekend, Campus Ministry's newest offer­ing, lasts nearly two days. 
The Man's Weekend is a unique event in many ways. The first one, which took place last October, included a pig roast ­but it is still geared towards developing the spiritual life of each participant. Students who attended the retreat spoke very highly of the experience. 
"It was an awesome experi­ence," said junior DJ DiDonna. "There was a good blend of spir­ituality and time to be alone, to pray, to relax. It was great to have the leaders give talks about what it means to be a man in the Church today, to have a chance to think about vocations, not necessarily as a priest, but just as a man. It was a very refreshing experience." 
Russeau said that student response coming out of retreats is overwhelmingly positive. He said that freshmen wish that their retreat could be longer, while seniors attending their first retreat wish they had done one sooner. Nevertheless, there is a certain amount of salesman­ship involved in getting students to sign up. Russeau said that his colleagues have had to essen­tially reinvent the women's retreat, because so few students signed up for it in previous years that several had to be cancelled. 
Students from all religious backgrounds are invited to par­ticipate, he said. 
"While the spirituality we offer in retreats is unavoidably Christian in nature, we do not concentrate on doctrinal issues, but on relationship." 
In the retreats he has led, stu­dents whom he knew were not Catholic "asked some of the best questions;' out of all students; he has had non-Catholics as lead­ers and presenters. 
DiDonna said that, coming from a Catholic high school, he had been to many retreats before, but the voluntary nature of Notre Dame retreats meant that "a different crowd" partici­pated. He said that, for someone 


Participants act out a skit during a recent Notre Dame Encounter. The retreats attract students throughout the year. 
who is serious about deepening their relationship with God, whether Catholic or not, a Notre Dame retreat is ideal. 
"Not every student will go on a retreat," said Russeau. "However, we like to think of those who do as acting as a kind of 'leaven' for the campus. We hope that they will be better equipped to make good deci­sions."

Events planned for Black History Month 
By ANNA GELHAUS News Writer 
A variety of cultural events, including lectures, readings and a film series, will occur throughout the semester to cel­ebrate Black History Month, said Keith Lee, the assistant director for program develop­ment for the Department of African and African-American Studies. 
Lee said that his department has decided to schedule the events differently this year, spreading them out throughout the semester rather than con­centrating them only in February. In addition, Lee said that the planned activities are targeted toward a student audi­ence. 
"We have a lot of activities spread out through February into March and even April," said Lee. "We are trying to attract students and [thus our events are] very student focused." 
As an example of the kinds of events that will take place, the next installment of the depart­ment's co-sponsored lecture series Race in the Americas will occur Wednesday. Jose Saldivar, a professor of English and Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Berkley will present a lecture entitled "Border Fillers."

Housing 
surveys sent out 
Students e-mailed surveys about future ofon-campus housing 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
Within the next two weeks, the 
Office of Student Affairs will be e­
mailing 1,000 undergraduate 
students a survey about the 
future of residential life at Notre 
Dame. 
The survey is the product of several months of discussion by a committee for the future of resi­dential life, which consists of administrators, faculty members and students. The results of the survey will be used when design­ing and renovating residence halls. 
Ann Firth, committee member and executive assistant to the vice president of student affairs, s.aid the committee is dreaming big and these result<> will be cru­cial in determining the nature of the four proposed residential complexes that were outlined in the University's most recent 10­year plan. The committee, which formed as a result of this plan, has discussed several options such as co-educational housing, senior apartments and suite style living. 
Firth said the University also intends to significantly renovate residential halls within the next 10 years once funding is avail­able. 
Committee members said the survey is a pro-active approach by the University to gauge stu­dent opinion and to lend credibil­ity to future plans.

Why me? 

My aunt has been diagnosed with bone cancer. Her youngest child is four years old. What did she do to deserve this? I have weekly dinner with a group of elderly Holy Cross sisters who are in the late stages Katie Knorr 
of Alzheimer's disease. What did they do to ll 

deserve this? I 1 ustrator listen to a lecture by Jimmy Dunne, whose business lost a third of its employees in the Sept. 11 attacks. What about him -what did he do? I think about the heartbreak I will feel after my boyfriend graduates. the incredible pain of not knowing what will happen to the connection we've made. What, I ask myself, did I do to deserve this? This is only a glimpse of the pain I've encountered. and I'm just one person in a world of six billion. Tragedy -and sadness -are everywhere. We often wonder why, but we never find an answer. Yet I promise you ... there is one. And figuring it out will change you. As I sit in my Irish Film and Culture class, a lecture about Yeats quickly shoots me a line that I will never forget. "Love cannot exist without pain," my professor says. "for if there's no pain, the feeling isn't real." It takes a minute to sink in. I ask myself, do I buy it? Six hours later, I am sure that I do. My aunt's cancer whispers that life is precious, and always too short. The stories of love and life the sisters tell increase in volume after two years of listening to their repetition. I listen to how Jimmy Dunne risked his entire business, but man­aged to send millions of dollars to the families of those who fell in the Towers. I realize that the tears I will cry in May will reflect some of the greatest love I've ever felt, and one connection that I know will never die. I think back on the family I've · been given, the opportunities I've had, the love I've encountered. And I'm sure that no tragedy. no pain, no sadness can lessen that. In fact, it serves not to break us, but rather to make us realize the full force of life, of love, and of experience. I've had all of these things, and so have you. Now I guess all that's left for us to ask is ... What could we have possibly done to deserve it?

Trucker wins driving award after accident 
MISSOULA, Mont. -A truck driver received his million-mile safe driving award in a hospital after getting injured in a crash. 
Raymond Mattes, 53, of Post Falls, Idaho, was en route from Washington state to Ohio with a load of frozen french fries and planned to stop in Missoula on Saturday to pick up his award from Jim Palmer Trucking. 
Before he could reach the company's yard, a sport utility vehicle skidded into the path of his tractor­trailer on Interstate 90 out-

Hooters job won't count as work-study 
SAVANNAH, Ga.-A 17­year-old high school senior working at a Hooters won't get class credit for her job because the restaurant. known for its waitresses in tight T-shir~ and hot pants, is too racy, school district officials decided Thursday. 
Laura Williams wanted her hostess job, for which she wears long pants and a collared shirt, to count as part of a work-study pro­gram that lets students leave school early so they can work for vocational course credit. 
Williams plans to keep the job and give up the credit.

Lee emphasized that the Department of African and African-American Studies aims for programs with an academic focus. 
"We try to tie things into the academic mission of the University," he said. 
The department is also look­ing to work in collaboration with other groups on campus in order to spread out and attract students, such as their collabo­ration with the Institute for Latino Studies in the Race in the Americas series. 
In addition, Multicultural Student Programs and Services (MSPS) will hold their annual Blak Koffee House Feb. 20 at 7 
p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. The event is an annual celebra­tion of black poetry and music. 
Also, Saint Mary's will sponsor a poetry performance and read­ing with award-winning poet Sonia Sanchez Feb. 24. 
In the final weekend in March, the recipients of the Erskine Peters Fellowship will arrive on­campus to participate in a panel discussion regarding black experiences in academia. The fellowship program is adminis­tered by the provost's office and the Department of African and African-American Studies and awards five black graduate stu­dents a $25,000 stipend and a 
$2,000 research budget to com­
plete their dissertation. 
MacArthur Fellowship winner and black poet Jay Wright will be holding a reading towards the end of the month, sponsored by the Boehnen Fund for Arts, Creative Writing, Graduate School and Office of the Provost. The exact time and location has" not yet been determined. 
A six-part series of films spon­sored by the Department of African and African-American Studies, "This Far by Faith", examined black spiritual life and recently concluded Wednesday.

"As we go forward and reno­vate, we want to make sure res­idential life is important," said Bill Kirk, committee chair and associate vice president for res­idence life. "You have to be sen­sitive to the student's needs." 
Firth said that students who participate in the survey, which the Office of Institutional Research estimates should only take about 10 minutes, will be eligible for a drawing that includes ten prize packages. These packages include a lap­top computer, season football and basketball tickets, flex point certificates and pizza par­ties. 
Undergraduate students from each year, including those who live both on and off campus, will receive the survey. 
Kirk said the committee wants to know what students opt" to move off-campus so that future and renovated residence halls can provide amenities that will keep students on campus. 
Kirk said the decision to review the character of resi­dence halls and the nature of residential life was not in response to the growing trend of Catholic universities that have abandoned completely mandatory single-sex living arrangements. 
"If you look at what's going around at other campuses, after they upgrade, you realize that you have to do something to make [residence halls] attractive," Kirk said. 
Kirk said the aspects of resi­dential life that students value 
most -the stay-in-hall system, 
in-hall chapels and the small 
community-will remain, but 
that officials want to know what 
else students value and that the 
committee is remaining very 
open-minded about the range 
of possibilities that residential 
life could take at Notre Dame. 
Kirk cited the creation of Legends, Reekers, the Coleman­Morse Center and the renova­tion of Hesburgh Library and the LaFortune Student Center as recent examples of where the University solicited student opinion in an effort to enhance campus life and said that this survey will continue that effort on a larger scale. 
Keri Oxley, a senior and stu­dent member of the committee, said the administration is put­ting a great deal of energy into including students in this deci­sion making process. 
In addition to the surveys, student opinion will be gauged through focus groups. Focus groups will also target adminis­trators, faculty members, rec­tors, assistant rectors and young alumni. 
Kirk said these surveys and focus groups will be different in nature and composition than the ones used to create the revised alcohol policy that was announced by vice president of Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman in March 2002. 
The committee expects to have survey results sometime this spring and the deadline for the first round of focus groups is March 15. Firth said the com­mittee's recommendation report most likely will not be completed until fall2004.

Finally, Lao led his team in previewing a student programming endowment, which would allow an increased budget for big-name concerts and speakers at the University. 
"We don't want to put the full burden of financing this on just student shoulders," Lao said. 
The Student Union Board's current allotment ranges between $30,000 and $60,000, Lao said, and these funds are not adequate for luring the famous acts desired by students. 
"The major challenge here is to have big signature events," Poorman said, adding that officials do "have a willing participant rate." 
Board members suggested that, before student government finalizes its proposal and report for ·the Board's May meeting, representatives should compile a list of sample bands and speakers and their respective fees, differentiating between various entertainment levels. 
"Come back to us with some ideas and price tags," one Board member said. 
The Board also suggested that student government explore the option of fmding sponsors to match funds that they, as a body, raise. Lao and his team said they will look into this idea of making the endowment more proactive and coopera­tive. 
When one Board member inquired into using the stadium as an entertainment venue, Poorman said there is no specific prohibition against its use, but various other factors, such as the amount of nec­essary security and human resources, create difficulties. 
"It's pretty complicated because it has a lot of other complications besides the money to host the concert," Poorman said. 
Lao and his team said they would con­sider and incorporate the Board's feed­back, and they said, in response to mem­bers' requests, they will send out more frequent updates to the Board before the May meeting.

Student political interest increasing 
By TARA EDWARDS 
The California Aggie 
Various student organi­zations assembled at tables on the University of California-Davis quad on Wednesday, providing reg­istration forms and infor­mation on their particular groups -and encourag­ing other students to vote. 
A recent study shows that this sort of student political interest is increasing significantly. Students are discussing politics more frequently and are much more aware of current events, found a recent study con­ducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UClA. 
The study The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 2003 -reported that the number of freshman that discuss politics regularly has increased from 19.4 percent in 2002 to 22.5 percent in 2003. Student political interest has not been as high since 1993. 
Some students said they believe that the college experience allows them to identify their beliefs and become more involved with political parties. 
Others credited the increase in political awareness to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
"[Sept. 11] didn't start any new movement; it just raised interest and strengthened groups," said UC Davis sophomore Cynthia Funes. 
Some students said they pay more attention to pol­itics because they felt sti­fled by the views they were taught before com­ing to college. Lindsey Krabbenhoft, a UC Davis sophomore who graduat­ed from a conservative Catholic high school, said that the university has offered a broader spec­trum of political views. 
"There's more of a vari­ety [of political groups] and they are more publi­cized," she said. "You find out about things easier." 
Krabbenhoft also attrib­uted her political interest to her belief that as stu­dents get older, they care more about what is going on in the country. 
Funes felt that since high schools are much smaller than many uni­versities, her political opinion didn't carry much weight. But once she started attending UC Davis, she said, she felt like she had more of a voice. She joined the National Organization for Women and found many individuals who shared her political views. 
Since Fumes is in a large organization that shares her views, she feels she can participate in outreach and have a stronger political impact.

Voter independence affected by colleges 
By ALEXANDRIA BURRIS The Louisiana State Reveille 
A New York Times colum­
nist recently told a crowd at 
Dartmouth College that peo­
ple with college degrees vote 
less independently. 
David Brooks said rising education levels have helped shape modern politics and voting in the United States. 
"The effect of this increas­ing education level for vot­ers should be to make voters independent minded, open to argument, rational and sophisticated," Brooks said. "It's just the opposite." 
He said the number of people voting independently decreases as the voting pop­ulation becomes more edu­cated. 
Robert Hogan, a political science assistant professor, said Brooks' argument makes sense to him, because college-educated people tend to vote along party lines. 
People with college degrees know more about politics, Hogan said. 
He said strong Democrats and Republicans happen to be well-educated people who understand more about what they believe and what each political party repre­sents. 
 Hogan said people who identify themselves as inde­pendent do not hold the staunch political positions of Democrats and Republicans. 
There is a lot of evidence that shows people who iden­tify themselves as independ­ent voters are more per­suade-d by political ads, Hogan said. It is hard to determine whether they are less educated than partisan voters. 
In a Jan. 14 article in The Dartmouth, Dartmouth College's campus newspaper, 
Brgoks said education leads away from independ­ent thinking. 
"The more educated you are, the more partisan you are, the less independently you think," Brooks said to the Dartmouth. 
Hogan said he thinks Brooks is not implying that staunch party supporters are closed-minded or that independent voters are more open-minded. 
He said partisan voters just have decided what they believe politically. 
Krystal Williams, political science senior, is one of the many students who identi­fies her beliefs with a cer­tain political party. 
Williams is president of College Democrats at Louisiana State University. 
She said she believes the political ideas people have are set in them. 
Williams said her Democratic ideas were always a part of her because she came from a Democratic family. 
But Williams said she did not realize she wanted to work in Democratic politics until she came to LSU.

Trade talks stall over U.S. subsidies 
PUEBLA, Mexico -Talks on the Free Trade Area of the Americas have largely. stalled over South American demands for an end to domestic U.S. farm subsidies, negotia­tors said Thursday. 
The prospect that the talks could fail -or result in a preliminary agreement so vague as to be meaningless -cheered an estimat­ed 1,000 anti-globalization protesters who marched and briefly confronted police out­side the hemispheric meeting of vice minis­ters in this colonial city, 65 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
"There is an impasse," said Edgardo Lander, a member of the Venezuela delega­tion. "The sticking point, as always, is agri­culture." 
Smnmit establishes anti-terror center 
BALI, Indonesia -Asian and Pacific coun­tries on Thursday moved to step up the inter-· national campaign against terror with a new law enforcement center in Indonesia and legal commitments that would make it easier to extradite and prosecute terrorists. 
Delegates at the two-day anti-terror con­ference oo this bomb-scarred tourist island said they hoped the meeting would help keep the terror fight at the top of governments' agendas. 
"This has been a historic meeting. This gives real momentum to the campaign against terrorism," said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who laid a wreath Thursday at a memorial for victims of the October 2002 nightclub bombings on Bali that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.

The former student, Clark Glenn Jr., now 27 and living in New Jersey, testified that Bendillo, known as "Brother Vic," had told him he was concerned about the boy's sex life and the development of his genitals. Glenn said Bendillo molested him and said it would help his condition.

HAITI 





Revolutionary army occupies city 
Associated Press 

PORT-AU-PRINCE -An armed opposition group seized control of Haiti's fourth-largest city Thursday, burning a police station, freeing prisoners and leaving at least four people reported dead and 20 wounded in clashes with police. 
Members of the Gonaives Resistance Front began the assault shortly after noon in Gonaives, setting afire the mayor's home and then dousing the police station with fuel and lighting it while officers fled, Haitian radio reports said.

TOLEDO, Ohio -Auto parts maker Dana Corp. has selected the head of GM Europe to become its new chief executive officer and president, the company said Wednesday. 
Mike Burns, 51, will replace for­mer Dana CEO Joseph Magliochetti, who died Sept. 22 after developing pancreatitis. 
Burns, president of GM Europe since 1998, will take over at Dana on March 1. 
"Mike Burns has the leadership

Toledo-based Dana fought off an unwanted takeover bid last year. -.ArvinMeritor Inc., a Troy Mich.­based supplier of shocks, struts, suspensions and exhaust systems, dropped a a $2.2 billion hostile takeover bid in November. 
Dana has about 4,500 Indiana employees and operations in Andrews, Avilla, Churubusco, Danville, Fort Wayne, Syracuse, Elkhart, Marion, Mishawaka and Mitchell. 
Dana, which makes parts such as brakes and axles, had struggled in recent years because of auto indus­try slowdowns. 
Two years ago it began eliminat­ing 11,000 jobs through plant clos­ings and consolidations. Those reductions came on top of about 10,000 job cuts because of declining auto production and slow U.S. sales. 
In October, Dana reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings, cred­iting its restructuring plan.

And she did it precisely when federal authorities are mulling a crackdown on broadcast inde­cency. 
The Jackson case could have a "galvanizing effect" on the move to toughen standards, said FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, who has complained his commission has been toothless in responding to complaints. 
At the very least, he said, it punctures the argument of peo­ple who say that those who are bothered by things on TV just shouldn't watch.

Frist staffer to resign over leaked memos 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -One of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist'~ key staffers will resign Friday because of an investiga­tion in to how Republicans gained access to Democratic memos concerning opposition to President Bush's judicial nomi­nees. 
Manuel Miranda, who worked for the Tennessee Republican on judicial nominations, has been on leave since late last month because of the investigation into how Democratic memos stored on a computer server shared by Judiciary Committee members ended up in GOP hands. 
But Miranda, a former GOP Judiciary staffer who trans­ferred to Frist's leadership office, offered his resignation and will leave Frist's office as of Friday, Frist spokesman Bob Stevenson said Thursday. 
A message left at Miranda's home was not immediately returned. He told The Knoxville News-Sentinel on Thursday he resigned to spare Frist. 
"I have departed so as not to distract the majority leader from pursuing the needed legislative agenda for the American peo­ple," Miranda told the Tennessee newspaper. "I cer­tainly did not want to burden Senator Frist with matters relat­ed to my work op the staff of Senator Orrin Hatch." 
He told the same newspaper in January that investigators were looking at work he per­formed for the .Judiciary Committee before he joined Frist's office. "There was no stealing," he said. "No systemat­ic surveillance. I never forward­ed these memos -period." 
Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, began the investigation in November after Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., protested what they said was the theft of the memos from their servers. The memos, con­cerning political strategy on blocking confirmation of several of President Bush's judicial nominations, were obtained and reported on by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times. 
Conservatives have talked up the memos as proof the Democrats colluded with outside liberal groups in their choices of which Bush appellate nominees to block. 
Hatch, the Judiciary chair­man, also placed an aide on leave late last year for improp­erly obtaining data from the computer networks of two Democratic senators. That aide, who has not been identified, has since left government work, offi­cials said. 
Senate Sergeant-at-Arms William Pickle has been working with the Secret Service and out­side investigators since November to try and determine how the Democratic memos got to Republicans. A report is expected to go to Hatch's Judiciary Committee in about two weeks, officials said. 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he would wait until that report is finished before deciding whether Miranda's resignation will satisfy Democrats. "At that time, we'll be in a better posi­tion to make an assessment of not only the investigation, but of the actions taken consequently," Daschle said. 
Pentagon nixes 'e-voting' 
Associated Press 
Citing security concerns, the Pentagon has canceled Internet voting that would have involved as many as 100,000 military and overseas citizens from seven states in November, a Defense Department official said Thursday. 
The announcement comes two 
weeks after outside security 
experts urged the program's 
cancellation in a scathing report. 
They said hackers or terrorists 
could penetrate the system and 
change votes or gather informa­
tion about users. At the time, the 
Pentagon said it felt confident 
enough to proceed. 
But Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz has since decid­ed to scrap the system because Pentagon officials were not cer­tain they could "assure the legit­imacy of votes that would be cast," said a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The official said alternative voting systems will now be con­sidered, possibly using the Internet as welL The official could not say when, if ever, such a system would be ready. 
Accenture eDemocracy Services, the vendor that built the system, issued a statement indicating testing will continue. 
"This is now an opportunity to demonstrate that the Internet is viable, valuable and secure enough to use for filing absentee ballots," said Meg McLaughlin, the Accenture unit's president. "We are confident that sending absentee ballots via the Internet is just as secure and reliable as sending them by mail." 
Computer scientists were elat­ed.

This year's $22 million trial, also overseen by the Pentagon agency, was to have covered 50 counties in Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Washington. It would have been open to non­military Americans abroad and military personnel stationed at 
U.S. and foreign bases. Any Internet-connected computer running Windows operating sys­tems, including at a cybercafe, could have been used for voting.

UNITED KINGDOM 
Donors may transmit CJD 
Blood may pass on human variant of mad cow disease 
Associated Press 
LONDON --British scientists studying how the human form of mad cow disease is transmitted say some people could be pass­ing the illness through blood donations. 
Although it has not been proven that the brain-wasting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease can be transmitted through transfusion, the scien­tists did find a case in which a blood donor and the recipient died of it. 
In that case, the donor gave blood more than three years before he developed symptoms, the scientists said in their report in Fridafs Lancet medical jour­nal. 
The researchers, led by Professor Robert Will at the National CJD Surveillance Center in Edinburgh, wrote that "although the epidemic of vCJD presently seems to be in decline, a proportion of the U.K. popula­tion could be incubating vCJD and acting as blood donors." 
The scientists based their study on records from United Kingdom blood services and the national CJD surveillance unit. 
The report said 48 people had been identified as having received blood from 15 donors who later developed the variant disease. 
By December 2003, all but 17 of the recipients had died but vCJD was the cause of death in only one case. The disease can only be confirmed during an autopsy by examining brain tis­sue. 
"Our findings raise the possi­bility that this infection was transfusion transmitted," the report says, adding that infection also "could have been due to past dietary exposure" to BSE. 
Scientists already believe peo­ple can get variant CJD from eat­ing products from cows infected with a similar illness, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ­BSE-or mad cow disease. 
Statistical analysis indicated that the odds of the man not being infected by his blood transfusion were between one in 15,000 and one in 30,000. 
In an accompanying independ­ent commentary, Dr. Adriano Aguzzi and Dr. Markus Glatzel from the University Hospital of Zurich in Switzerland, said, "the chance that this case is not transfusion-related is very small." 
"Shocking as it may be," they wrote, "the finding that vCJD can be transmitted via blood transfusion is not surprising. Stringent studies in sheep show that prion diseases" -such as CJD --"can be transmitted via blood, even if blood is collected in preclinical stages of prion dis­ease." 
Besides the transfusions, 20 units of plasma from people who later developed variant CJD were used to make blood prod­ucts before 1998, when Britain stopped using British blood, the Lancet report said. 
The scientists said that before 1998, "many thousands of indi­viduals may have been exposed" to blood products "derived from pools containing a donation from an individual incubating vCJD." 
So far, they said, no case of variant CJD has been identified as connected to exposure to such plasma products. The risks from plasma products are probably less than from transfusion, they added.

Rumsfeld: Relations with Europe normal 
Associated Press 
MUNICH -U.S. relations 
with Europe, severely strained 
by the Iraq war, are now "fair­
ly normal," Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld said 
Thursday. 
He has embarked on a three­
nation European tour aimed in 
part at smoothing relations 
with Germany and other coun­
tries that were upset by the 
U.S. decision to invade Iraq and by postwar issues. 
Differences between allies 
are inevitable, Rumsfeld said 
in an interview en route here 
from Washington, and he dis­
missed suggestions that a 
major diplomatic effort will be 
required to mend fences. 
Rumsfeld flew here for a 
meeting of NATO defense min­
isters on Friday and for the 
weekend Munich Conference 
on Security Policy, which 
attracts officials, analysts and 
military leaders from around 
the globe. 
Throughout NATO's 55-year history, he said, the trans­Atlantic relationship "has gone from little difficulties to things better, from little difficulties to things better -it's been a pat­tern over my entire adult life­time. 
"I would say the relation­ships right now are fairly nor­mal." 
Rumsfeld also said that although NATO may get more involved in Iraq at some point, "Its first task really is to do well [in] the Afghanistan task" of leading the International Secu.rity Assistance Force in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and managing civil aid teams in several provinces. 
Rumsfeld said he expected Iraq to be a major topic of dis­cussion during his two days in Munich. On Sunday he is scheduled to travel to Zagreb, Croatia, followed by meetings in London on Monday. 
When he spoke to the Munich con~rence one year ago, Rumsfeld was critical of Europeans who favored giving United Nations inspectors

more time to determine 
whether Iraq possessed chemi­
cal. biological or nuclear 
weapons. Delay, Rumsfeld said, 
"could well make war more 
likely, not less, because delay­
ing preparations [for war] 

sends a signal of uncertainty 
instead of a signal of resolve." 
About one month later, U.S. 

forces invaded, toppling 
Saddam Hussein's regime. So 
far no weapons of mass 
destruction have been found in 
Iraq, and the head of the U.S. 
search team, David Kay, told 

Congress last week that it 
appears that the administra­
tion ·s prewar claims were 
erroneous. 
The political backdrop to 
Rumsfeld's return to Munich is 
the Bush administration's 
struggle to get past the divi­
sive ness and mistrust that 
remain among U.S. allies over 
the Iraq war and Bush's han­
dling of its aftermath. 
France, Germany and 
Belgium -all NATO members 
-strongly opposed going to 
war last year, and the French 
and German governments are 
against committing NATO 
troops to Iraq in a peacekeep­
ing role. 
France and Germany also 
were angered at Bush's deci­
sion to prohibit them from bid­
ding on postwar reconstruction 
contracts financed by the U.S. 
government. The White House 
later said it was reconsidering 
its position, but there has been 
no announced decision to allow 
French or German companies 
to bid. 
The administration wants 
wider international support for 
its postwar efforts, including 
troop contributions. A number 
of NATO countries, led by 
Britain, Spain and Poland, 
have deployed troops to Iraq, 
but NATO as an institution has 
so far not taken a direct role in 
helping stabilize the country. 
Some private analysts say there is a danger that as the United States tries to draw NATO into conflicts far from its traditional area of interest ­inside the borders of Europe ­the trans-Atlantic relationship that is the foundation of NATO could unravel. 
Anthony Cordesman, a mili­tary analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a recent report that the Bush adminis­tration's effort to get NATO more directly involved in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East will "invoke countless aspects of the law of unintended consequences." 
"While it is acting from self-· ish motives. the United States is defining tangible power pro­jection missions far beyond the periphery of NATO for the first time since the end of the Cold War," he wrote.

What I know about racial preferences 
In response to the recent spate of affirmative action articles in The Observer-some of which, I must say, were deeply disturbing-I felt the need to weigh in. At some level, these debates revolve around questions of racial preference, something I know a good deal about. Yes, I

United States. But, per­
haps more importantly, American 
I'm an authority on Studies 
racial preferences 
because, as a white per­
son, I receive them each and everyday. 
Here's what I know. For starters, having sub­stantial savings or wealth makes one's life a whole lot easier. I also know that, like most peo­ple, much of my wealth comes from what I inher­it from family members. Because my ancestors never faced severe or systematic discrimination in buying a home, joining a union, working a quality job or receiving an honest wage they've had more of an opportunity to earn and save money-and to pass it on to me. This point helps explain why the assets oftoday's average white households are -"controlling" for income, age, occupation, and education-still $25,000 higher than those of average black households. 
I also know that, thanks to my whiteness, my job prospects are, on average, a good deal brighter than those ofnonwhites. White men like me occupy the overwhelming majority of the most prestigious, powerful and well-paid jobs in the country. To quote a recent Newsweek article: "White males make up just 39.2 percent ofthe population, yet they account for ... 77 percent of Congress, 92 percent ofstate governors, 70 per­cent oftenured college faculty, almost 90 percent of daily newspaper editors, 77 percent of1V news directors," and, I'd add, 95 percent ofsen­ior managers in Fortune 500 companies. Did someone honestly say "reverse discrimination"? 
Why the preponderance ofwhite men? An important reason is continuing racial discrimina­tion in the job market. One recent experiment that involved college students posing as job appli­cants found that white ex-cons were more likely to receive interviews than African Americans with squeaky-clean records. In another study, economists at MIT and the University of Chicago responded to 1 ,300 help-wanted ads in Chicago and Boston by sending out equivalent resumes and randomly assigning "white-" and "black­sounding" names to each. The study concluded that applicants like "Greg Kelly" and "Emily Walsh" were 50 percent more likely to get called for interviews than "Jamal Jackson" and "Lakisha Washington." 
I also know that my whiteness greatly increas­es my chances ofliving in a nice, clean and safe neighborhood. Part of this, of course, has to do with my savings and employment options; chances are I can afford a better home in a bet­ter community. But there's more to the story. For one, government agencies and businesses are far more likely to place toxic waste sites and haz­ardous landfills near African-American and Latino neighborhoods and not next to mine. In addition, racial discrimination remains rampant in the housing market. Over the last decade, numerous studies by banks, academics and gov­ernment agencies have found that African Americans and Latinos-when compared with whites of similar economic standing-have a harder time securing bank loans, are often quot­ed higher interest rates and are steered by real estate agents into particular (i.e., racially segre­gated) communities. 
I also know that my whiteness improved my chances as a child of attending a quality school. Because local tax dollars fund America's public schools (with a few exceptions), all the economic advantages I've mentioned here make it far more likely that white schools -like the one I attended -secure the best equipment. most highly paid teachers and nicest facilities. Given that the Supreme Court outlawed school segre­gation a full fifty years ago, you might think the term "white schools" is something of an anachro­
nism. I wish you were right. The truth is today's 
schools are resegregating at alarming rates. 
According to a recent report from Harvard 
University's Civil Rights Project, "African­
American and Latino students are now more iso­
lated from their white counterparts than they 
were three decades ago, before many ofthe 
overhauls from the civil rights movement had 
even begun to take hold." 
I also know that should I, during the course of 
my life, experience any health problems, my 
whiteness will be an asset. Having reviewed over 
100 recent studies on race and health, the 
Institute ofMedicine concluded last year that 
"racial and ethnic minorities in the United States 
receive lower quality health care than whites, 
even when their insurance and income are the 
same." Thanks in part to the conscious and 
unconscious biases of white doctors, Latinos and 
African Americans are less likely to receive 
appropriate medications for heart disease, to 
undergo bypass surgery or to receive kidney dial­
ysis, transplants or the most sophisticated HIV 
treatments. They are, therefore, far more likely 
to die from numerous diseases. Race, in this 
case, is literally a life or death matter and white­
ness the great immunizer. 
Finally, I know that whiteness deeply shapes 
my everyday life -when I go shopping and 
security guards take my integrity for granted; 
when I'm driving on the highways and the police 
do not pull me over or eye me suspiciously for 
Driving While White; when I walk around the 
Notre Dame campus and am never forced, on 
account ofmy race, to feel out of place; when I 
enter a classroom and need not worry that some 
students might automatically question my qualifi­
cations for being here; and when I read The 
Observer without fear that some writers, on the 
basis of my whiteness, may seek to malign my 
intelligence, character and sense ofself-worth. 
Although this list of preferences is hardly exhaustive, I trust you get the picture. Whiteness pays. Whether it's my savings, income, health, home, education, job opportunities or everyday peace of mind, whiteness offers me and other whites countless seen and unseen advantages. Given this fact, I am continually dismayed and disheartened that the very term racial prefer­ence has become synonymous in popular parl­ance not with these widespread and longstand­ing white advantages, but with affirmative action, a relatively new and limited program designed to offset them. 
Indeed, this equating of racial preference with affirmative action is the great racial fiction of our day; the twenty-first-century version of"separate but equal." It sounds plausible but is, in reality, profoundly and perversely misleading. Affirmative action doesn't "prefer" any one "race." Yes, many universities, colleges, compa­ni~ and government agencies do offer "minori­ty" applicants some form ofpreference in the selection process. But preferences also go to many other groups, such as athletes, legacies, musicians, men in nursing, Catholics at Notre Dame, Italian Americans at the City University of New York and, ofcourse, white women-the biggest beneficiaries of afllrmative action -in workplaces all across the country. 
Equally important, people of color should receive some "preference" in hiring, contracting and admissions decisions. In a country that for far too long has parceled out the lion's share of power and money, rights and resources to whites alone, how else can we ensure that all Americans receive some semblance of equal opportunity? If you've got a better solution, I'd love to hear it. But, in the meantime, let's pre­serve affinnative action and fight real racial pref­erence. It's a fight we all win by waging, for while white privilege charms the few, a more equal America enriches us all.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Consistency, please 
Ah, Notre Dame. A place where young minds come to search for new ideas, expose themselves to perspectives other than their own. A place where not just the physical landscape has beauty, but so too do our thoughts of common and uncommon, controversial and uncontroversial, Catholic and non-Catholic origin. Notre Dame must be more than simply a place where "children toss footballs" and "family and friends visit to see their darling sons and daughters and brothers and sisters," as Ricky McRoskey's article points out. 
McRoskey is apparently offended by the fact that his younger brother will have to be traumatized by the word "vagina" appearing in the dining hall. Rather than force such horror on this innocent mind let us rid the campus of these outlandish signs. I'd like to further this line of thinking. My younger sister has read The Observer, and I'd really rather her not be exposed to such excessive close-mindedness as~displayed by McRoskey's letter. Let us rid the campus of this too. In fact, let us rid the campus of everything remotely controversial. McRoskey is right; our standards of appropriateness should be those of a ten-year-old. 
But really, let's have some consistency. McRoskey's point about his inabili­ty to sell shirts with a beer logo on campus, or ones with "lewd or sexual slogans across them" is well taken. Clearly the signs saying "vagina" are similarly motivated, as a theatrical performance trying to end violence against women is as reprehensible as a student selling "lewd" shirts. 
Since when is a college campus subject to censorship at the elementary school level? May we have a little appreciation for something with a noble cause and an original approach. 
RaySchleck freshman Keenan Hall Feb. 5 
Another rationale for Monologues 
I find the "Vagina Monologues," based on what I have read about the play by both supporters and detractors, to be totally classless and unintellectual as well. These criticisms have been aired quite well already, so I will not waste any more time on them. What I would like to do is defend the play from an angle I am quite certain nobody else has even considered. 
Vocations. We all know about the vocations crunch and how it will proba­bly get even worse in the years ahead. As a man, and having spoken to many other men about the issue, I can say with confidence that, for us. the biggest obstacle to the priesthood is the desire to marry. I think "Vagina Monologues" can effectively blunt this desire for many, if not most, men. If I were a Holy Cross priest teaching theology, I would drag my male students to this play, and then ask them afterward, "Now are you sure you actually want to get married?" This is not to say, ofcourse, that most men are unaware that women have vaginas, and need to see this play to inform them of that fact. It is just not what men tend to consider primarily when they think of the fairer sex, or in such a crude and juvenile fashion. "Vagina Monologues" can fix that. 
I think internet pornography can serve the same role, by the way. Watch enough of that, so disgusting and degrading and you will be far more likely to agree with the Church that celibacy is indeed the superior way of life. There is a danger with some men of getting addicted to that stuff, though. so if I were a recruiter for the seminary I would not promote it. The "Vagina Monologues," like "Sex & the City," is a safer alternative. Or have them read the "Wlfe of Bath" tale in Chaucer. That tale is difficult to understand, though, and perhaps a little bit above the heads of most college students today. No danger of that in "Vagina Monologues," not intellectually anyway. The only part hard to understand is why female college students would pro­duce and promote something so conducive to contempt for women.

Parkin 
Rules 
Yes, they also apply to you 
Hello Notre Dame! It's time to learn something really important that will be good to know for the rest of your life. No, it's not metaphysics of weasels or advanced basket weaving. This, my fellow Darners, is a basic tutorial on parking. 
Now parking is something that should have been learned naturally around the age of 16, or whenever a driver's license was acquired. It's a sad fact that many members of the Notre Dame community are inexplicably incapable of placing their cars in an at rest position correctly. I am willing to assume that this is due to no fault of students themselves. Perhaps you had no good parking role models. For example: your parents didn't drive, had chauffeurs or are wild dogs. So to make Notre Dame a more respon­sible parking community, let's run through some common parking Rachel Ourada misconceptions. 
"Sometimes I can't see the yellow lines in the parking lot -Scene should I just park anywhere?" Columnist 
If there is a space between existing cars -you should park par­allel to the other cars, not at an extreme angle. Also make sure that you are parking in an actual row-not the aisle. 
''I'm really important! Can my car occupy more than one parking space?" 
No. 
"It snows a lot in South Bend, but I just don't understand why you can't park where the snow piles go from plowing the parking lot? And what do those crazy signs mean that say 'no parking January­March.' What ifI just park behind the snow



RACHEL OURADNObserver Illustration 
it's not going to get warm enough to melt all the snow anytime soon. That means that every time it snows there is more and more snow in the lot. To stop the entire thing from becoming a slushy mess, Notre Dame plows the aisles between cars. This is where the snow piles come in, as the snow from the aisles is pushed to these specially designated areas. Think of them as parking spaces for snow. If there is snow there, it's parked and there is no room for your car. As far as the signs go, Notre Dame assumes that its students can read basic English, which means if it says no parking, don't park there. Parking behind the snow pile is also a big no. If there's snow there, then you are not actually parking in the spot, you are in the aisle. 
''I'm in a big hurry/really lazy. Can I park anywhere my car stops?" 
Ah, you are confusing parking with your car being at rest. Summer houses in the country have huge driveways so wherever your car stops, it's parked. This, however, is Notre Dame and there are not enormous driveways. Cars have to be parked in des­
ignated areas. This means no parking where other cars have to navigate the lot. So, no creating that special parking spot at the end of the row just for you. Lots are carefully organ­ized to allow cars to both be at rest and navigate through the lot-it's not up to you to change them. 
"I really want to find a parking space-is itpolite to

Following people is, 

in most cultures, consid­ered stalking. It creeps out the people you are following while at the same time makes you look like a big jerk. So please leave the pedestrians alone and just find an avail­able spot. 
I hope that this little tutorial will be a help to the Notre Dame driving community. If you need more help, try practicing at large parking lots -like the mall or Meijer. Take the time to park correctly in every available spot. And don't come back until you figure it out.

Scene Writers 
Rarely in pop culture is a remake of a classic work able to become a clas­sic of its own. One of the only excep­tions is "West Side Story," which brings its special twist of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" to Washington Hall this week. Performed by the Pasquerilla East Musical Company, the show has created a the­ater buzz unseen on campus for a very long time. The weekend shows sold out so quickly that they opened up Wednesday's final dress rehearsal for ticket sales. 
"West Side Story" is a fairly strict adaptation of one of Shakespeare's greatest works. The setting is moved from Verona to Manhattan in the 1950s, and the rival street gangs the Jets and the Sharks replace the feud­ing families of Montague and Capulet. The lovers of this tale are Maria, sister of the Shark leader, Bernardo and Tony, best friend of Riff, the leader of the Jets. 

The two fall in love at a dance, which causes a great stir among the gang leaders. Riff does not want to see her sister get involved with one of their enemies, just as Bernardo does not want to see his best friend do the same. To complicate things, Maria has already had her marriage arranged for her, to a fellow Shark named Chino. What follows is a tale of love struggling to survive in a world full of murder and hatred. The story even goes a step further than Shakespeare in adding the extra tension of the eth­nic struggles between Puerto Ricans and Americans in 1950s New York. 
The concept of "West Side Story" came from Jerome Robbins and a novel written by Arthur Laments. Leonard Bernstein, the creator of many famous symphonies, ballets and musicals, composed the score. Lyricist Stephen Sondheim has also con­tributed to such famous musicals as "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," "Candide," "Gypsy" 
and "Into the Woods," which was performed last year by the Pasquerilla East Musical Company. His work also includes contribu­tions to motion pictur"es such as "Dick Tracy" and "The Birdcage." 
Robbins pro­posed the idea to Bernstein in 1949. Bernstein first wanted to set it against the back­drop of Easter and Passover with the main conflict aris­ing between Jewish and Christian families. After meeting with Laments in 1955,

the con­e e p t w a s changed to the one seen now in the­aters. The musical opened Sept. 26, 1957 on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theater, later home to the musical, "Cats." It played there for 732 performances and then went on the road for ten weeks and returned to Broadway for 249 more per­formances. A 1980 revival on Broadway played for 341 performances. 
Unlike many musicals, the film version of "West Side Story" is just as famous as its stage version. The film opened in October 1961 and was nominated for 12 Academy Awards. It went on to win 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director and Best Cinematography. The film also won three Golden Globes, including Best Picture, and won a Grammy for Best Soundtrack. 

The soundtrack itself is one of the best parts of the show. The musical numbers of "West Side Story" are some of the most widely recognized pieces of musical theater in history. "Jet Song," "Maria," and "America" and "I Feel Pretty" are staples of the Broadway canon. The widely recognizable songs in addition to the large cast make the musical a popu­lar choice for high school and college theater companies. 
As for Notre Dame's own The Pasquerilla East Musical Company, the performances of the actors reveal the amount of hard work and effort that went into the production. Besides the lines and blocking of standard dramatic plays, the actors in "West Side Story" also had to rehearse the vocal numbers and learn the choreography to the sever­al dance numbers that are interwoven into the storyline. Director Ray Areaux also acted as choreographer, with Lauren Prieto as music director and Beth Planalp as stage manager. 
Lawrence Santiago plays Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks who is looking for a turf of his own for his Puerto Hican erver brethren. Santiago plays the role with a ;to headstrong aggressiveness needed to convey his role of authority in the organ­ization. Santiago also displays the confident qualities of a wom­anizer, while at the same time being protective and caring of his sister 
Maria. 
Natalie Martinez, in the role of Maria, has a sim­ply beautiful voice that com­mands the stage whenever she is present. The role of Maria is multi­faceted, and Martinez makes the perfect transi­tion from being a wide-eyed girl with dreams of a bet­ter future to assuming the role 
of the love stricken protagonist. Like Maria, the 
character of Tony, played by Jack Calcutt, is torn about his present life at the onset of the musical. Tony is reluctant to rejoin the Jets, but 
Calcutt's motivation stems more from having an unseen knowledge of what the gang life is all about, rather than from fear of the unknown. Calcutt beautifully balances that initial mature reluctance with his later infatuation with Maria. 
KC Kenney plays Riff, the leader of the Jets who has finally gained respect for his gang by ousting another rival city gang. Kenney plays Riff with a zeal that reflects his war-hawkish qualities and his slight overconfidence. Kenney was also one of the producers of the show. 
Jenny Radelet plays Bernardo's girl­friend Anita. She gives a powerful vocal and acting performance. She is Maria's only real confidant and is as torn as her friend over her connection with the Tony and the Jets. 
Unlike the movie version, which obvi­ously needed a realistic setting in order to make the story believable on screen, the Pasquerilla East Musical Company chose to reflect the original stage setting of the play and use a minimal amount of set design. The orchestra does not per­form from a pit, but rather behind the set of scaffolding in front of a plain white canvas with colored lights on it. The only props are a few tables and chairs and a few moveable boxes. The absence of large decadent sets and props leaves as much room as possible open on stage for the elaborate dance numbers. 
The costumes are timeless, but easily convey the identities of the rival gangs. The men are in jeans and T-shirts, while the women are primarily in dresses. The Sharks' costumes are lively and vibrant in order to reflect Puerto Rican influ­ences. The men wear bright reds, oranges and yellows with black jeans and black sneakers and occasionally simple suits and ties. The women wear colorful Latin dresses with reds and whites and ribbons and lace. 
The Jets' costumes are more muted and metropolitan, with blues, greens, and purples. The men wear blue jeans and white sneakers, along with sport coats and khakis. The women are always in pastel dresses that reflect the 1950s style. The contrast between the cos­tumes, and between the gangs, is stark when the cast members are together onstage. 

It is fitting that the honor of having so many sold out shows goes to The Pasquerilla East Musical Company, the organization that was responsible for bringing musical theater back to ·Notre Dame. Starting in 1987, the University experienced a decade long drought of musical theater productions. Neither the Department of Music nor the the Department of Film, Television and Theater would sponsor such activities. 
Then, in the spring of 1997, Kelly McGann, a resident of Pasquerilla East, worked with Student Activities to devel­op a campus group dedicated to musical theater, under a mission statement dedi­cated to "provide an outlet for musical and artistic expression and enjoyment, for Pasquerilla East and the University of Notre Dame community." The Pasquerilla East Musical Company first performed "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," a musical take on the biblical story of Joseph in the Book of Genesis, in the fall of 1997. The production was a rousing success, and since then the group has gone on to stage productions of other several other famous musicals. In 1999, the Pasquerilla East Musical Company performed "Godspell," the story of Christ set in the psychedelic '60s, fol­lowing it the next year with "Grease," one of the most staged musicals in history. "Guys and Dolls," performed in 2001 told the gang­ster-era story of dat­ing, marriage, and gambling. The fol­lowing year staged 
"Damn Yankees," set in the golden age of baseball and telling the story of a baseball team with plenty of heart. 
This year, the Pasquerilla East Musical Company has upheld their excellent tra­dition with yet another strong perform­ance of a classic musical. The singing, acting and dancing all provide an excit­ing experience of authentic Broadway theater, 800 miles from the great white way. "West Side Story" is a tale about hatred, prejudice and vengeance, but above all these, it is a story about love overcoming all bonds. Shakespeare wrote his theater for the masses of his time, as stuffy as it may sG'em to many readers today. The P. E. Musical Company's production succeeds in tak­ing that classic love story and bringing it to a contemporary audience with an excitement and enthusiasm that is hard to find in any other medium but musical theater.

NCAA FOOTBALL 



Pittsburgh's Fitzgerald eligible for NFL draft 

Associated Press 

PITTSBURGH -Heisman Trophy runner-up Larry Fitzgerald, the Pittsburgh sophomore who set NCAA receiving records in his two college seasons, was declared eligible Thursday for the NFL draft. 
The NFL's ruling came on the same day a federal judge ' opened the door for running back Maurice Clarett to also turn pro despite playing only one season at Ohio State. 
Under league rules, a player must be in college for three NFL seasons before he can be drafted. Fitzgerald left the Academy of Holy Angels in Minneapolis, Minn., midway through his senior year in 2001 and transferred to Valley Forge (Pa.) Military Academy to boost his grades for college. 
After spending nearly 1 112 academic years there, Fitzgerald signed with 
Pittsburgh and immediately became the most productive receiver in school history. He owns NCAA records for con­secutive games with a touch­down catch (18) and most TDs receiving as a freshman and sophomore (34). 
The NFL determined Fitzgerald was eligible because he would have gradu­ated from high school in 2001 had he not transferred and thus is three years past his senior year of high school. 
Fitzgerald declined comment after learning of the NFL's rul­ing. His father, Larry Sr., said, "We choose to let them [the NFL] do what they do, and then we'll do what we do." 
With numerous NFL scouts saying Fitzgerald likely will be a top five pick, his departure from Pitt was considered a foregone conclusion for weeks. 
Pitt's offense would be in a rebuilding mode next season even if Fitzgerald returned.

with star quarterback Rod Rutherford, running back Brandon Miree and most of the offensive line departing. 
"Whatever Larry decides, this university is going to sup­port him whole hearted ly," assistant athletic director E.J. Borghetti said Thursday night. "The opportunity to be a top­five pick can be a fleeting one in the game of football. But education is important to Larry's family, and whatever he decides to do, he will still work to his degree. It was important to his [late] mother and to his dad and I know it remains a priority of his." 
Fitzgerald's case differs from Clarett's. The Pitt star played two college seasons, while Clarett played only one. Clarett graduated early from high school in December 2001. and his lawyers contended that came before the end of the 2001 NFL season and thus made him eligible under the three-year rule. 
The Clarett ruling, if it holds up on appeal, means high school football players and college underclassmen would be able to make the jump to the pros just as NBA. NHL and major league baseball players can. 
Fitzgerald is not believed to have formally petitioned the league to be declared eligible. But his lawyer sent a letter to the NFL last month asking that his draft status be clari­fied. 
The 6-foot-3, 225-pound Fitzgerald already has an NFL background. His father, a for­mer college lineman, is a sports writer and radio-TV show host in Minneapolis, and his son was a Minnesota Vikings ball boy for several years while in high school. 
While working in the Vikings' training camp. the younger Fitzgerald became friends with receivers Cris Carter and Randy Moss. It was Carter, a former Ohio State star, who suggested he consid­er Pitt. 
Pitt coach Walt Harris is a former Buckeyes assistant coach. 
With Fitzgerald's departure now imminent, the Panthers will be losing their most pro­ductive player since the days 

of  Dan  Marino  and  Tony  
Dorsett.  
Fitzgerald  won  the  

Biletnikoff Trophy as college football's top receiver last sea­son and the Walter Camp Award as the nation's best player. He was a close runner­up to Oklahoma quarterback Jason White for the Heisman Trophy, nearly becoming the first sophomore to win the award. 
Fitzgerald, a first-team All­American, caught 87 passes for an NCAA-leading 1,595 yards and 22 touchdowns last season, making at least one touchdown catch in all 12 reg­ular-season games. His record streak of 18 consecutive games with a touchdown catch ended in a Continental Tire Bowl loss to Virginia that wrapped up Pitt's 8-5 season. 
As a freshman, Fitzgerald made 69 catches for 1,005 yards and 12 touchdowns in leading Pitt to a 9-4 record ­its first nine-win season in 20 years. Pitt was 17-9 with Fitzgerald in its lineup.

Burks signs one-year contract with Red Sox 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Ellis Burks was let go 12 years ago by the Red Sox, who weren't sure he'd stay healthy and become a productive player. Now they've changed their minds. 
On Tuesday, the team's for­mer top draft choice finalized a $7 50,000, one-year con­tract with Boston. 
"It's like a fine wine -I got better with time," Burks said. 
Now 39, Burks said his release from Boston 

changed in his absence. It has new owners, numerous minority players and a repu­tation for working together. 
"That goes to show you, everything grows in time," Burks said. 
Burks made the All-Star team and won a Gold Glove in 1990, when he hit .296 with 21 homers and 89 RBis. He didn't match those numbers in 1991, then missed most of 1992 with a serious back injury. In December that year, Boston let

I. 
Burks accepted baseball player love so dearly 
Boston's offer over a proposal from Seattle. His choice was made after hours on the Internet, comparing the teams' pitch­ing staffs and lineups. 
He was selected by Boston in the 1983 draft and arrived in the big leagues in 1987. 
"It was a lot of pressure on a young kid, to hear compar­isons to Willie Mays," Burks said. "I put too much pres­sure on myself instead of relaxing and playing like I can play." 
Burks was among a handful of black players on the team. Burks said he never had any problems on the Red Sox, but remembered being uneasy at times in Boston. He cited the infamous Charles Stuart case in 1989, which awoke racial tensions when a white man killed his wife, then blamed it on an unknown black man. 
"The whole city was looking for a 6-foot-1 black man in a warmup suit," the 6-foot-2 Burks recalled. "So I didn't wear any warmup suits." 
The organization has 
taken away, that 
helps you re­
evaluate things," 
he said. 

Burks also played for Colorado, San Francisco and Cleveland. His best season was in 1996, when he hit .344 for Colorado with 40 homers and 128 RBis. 
In 2002, his last full season, he batted .301 with 32 homers and 91 RBis. Last year, his season was cut short because of a nerve con­dition in his right elbow that required surgery. 
He figures to see time mainly as a designated hitter and right-handed pinch-hit­ter, and will compete for playing time with Kevin Millar and David Ortiz, both coming off good seasons. Burks also is prepared to play outfield and maybe first base. 
"He's been an everyday player, and now he'd kind of coming down to the twilight of his career," manager Terry Francona said. "Like he said, he can still impact a baseball team."

Kuchar and Henry
UConn defeats Tennessee 
Associated Press 
KNOXVILLE. Tenn.-No mat­ter who's ranked No. 1, Diana Taurasi and Connecticut know how to top Tennessee. 
The All-American guard scored 18 points to lead the No.4 Huskies to an 81-67 victory Thursday night, their ftfth straight win over the top-ranked Lady Vols. 
Ann Strother added 17 points for Connecticut, and Barbara Turner had 16 points and nine rebounds. Ashley Battle scored 11 points. 
Connecticut (17-2) improved to 12-6 all-time against Tennessee {18-2) in a rivalry that began in 1995. The series has included three national championship games-all won by the Huskies. 
The Huskies made a compelling case to return to the top of the polls for the second time this sea­son. Connecticut was No. 1 until Jan. 5, after losing at home to Duke two days before. 
The Huskies ran out to a 21-13 lead midway through the first half and never let go of the lead. 
Each time Tennessee appeared to mount a rally, Connecticut would get an easy basket on a backdoor cut or come off a screen to hit a 3-pointer. 
Tennessee looked out of sync on offense again without point guard Loree Moore, who is out for the season with a tom knee ligament. 
And again Tennessee melted on defense in the biggest regular-sea­son game in women's basketball. 
The Lady Vols got as close as 67-63 with 6:28 remaining after Tasha Butts made two free throws, but Connecticut had a quick 5-0 run to go up by nine. 
The Huskies outscored Tennessee 7-2 down the stretch to win their sixth straight game after losing at Notre Dame last month. 
Reserve Tye'sha Fluker and Shanna Zolman each scored 14 points for Tennessee, which had its 11-game winning streak snapped. Shyra Ely and Brittany Jackson added 10 points apiece.

views and 
greens so soft 
and bumpy that 
only 6-inch putts are consid­
ered tap-ins. 
On Thursday, it looked like 
a "Welcome Back" party for 
some of the leaders. 
Kuchar, the former U.S. 
Amateur champion who had 
a charming run through the 
majors in 1998, won the 
Honda Classic two years ago 
but followed it up by finishing 
182nd on the money list. 
Henry had two runner-up fin­
ishes as a rookie in 2001, but 
dropped into mediocrity the 
last two years. 
The biggest surprise might 
have been Tommy Tolles, who 
shot a 66 at Pebble Beach. 
Tolles, considered to be 
among the best young players 
when he nearly won the '96 
Players Championship, 
watched his game slowly fall 
into disrepair until he was 
forced to play on the 
Nationwide Tour last year. 
Getting back to the PGA 
Tour was a big deal. Starting 
his season with a 66, which 
included a chip-in on No. 17 
that made him feel like Tom 
Watson, made it even better. 
"On the. Nationwide Tour, 
there were some tourna­
ments you just didn't feel like 
this was a setting," he said. "I 
was out here seven years, 
and I know what it's like. You 
can get competition wherever 
you go. But the atmosphere 
just isn't the same. Th.ere is 
only one PGA Tour." 
There's only one Pebble 
Beach, and Tolles really 
soaked it up. 
It started on No. 1 with a 
birdie, "a typical AT&T 10­
footer, bounced around and 
eventually went in," Tolles 
said . 
Despite hitting his approach 
onto the beach and taking a 
bogey at No. 10, he plugged 
away and got close to the 
leaders by chipping in from 
17th. It wasn't anywhere 
near the spot where Watson 
chipped in to win the '82 U.S. 
Open, but Tolles felt just as 
good. 
"The feeling is incredible, 
but when there's 500 or 
1,000 people around to cheer 
for you, it's icing on the 
cake," said Tolles, who was 
lucky to see that many people 
all year on the Nationwide 
Tour. 
"It's just so unexpected that 
you just have this, 'Oh, I want ·to do cartwheels or somer­saults.' But I'm too old for 
that," he said.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Duke beats UNC 83-81 in overtime thriller 
Associated Press 

CHAPEL HILL. N.C. -Mike Krzyzewski thought this was more than just one of the best games in the storied rivalry between Duke and North 
,. 
Carolina. 
"I think you do it an injustice to say it was a great Duke­Carolina game," he said of the top-ranked Blue Devils' 83-81 overtime victory over No. 17 North Carolina on Thursday night. "It was a great game. You can't match the intensity level." 
There was a buzz in the 

'·. 
Smith Center minutes after the
1
'' game ended. It was the noise a crowd makes when it's disap­pointed, yet still energized. "You're told it's a rivalry and everything, but when you're on the court, the emotion of every­body -your teammates and the Carolina players -it's. like you're giving it everything," Duke freshman Luol Deng said. ,1' "It was just a fight from both teams and Chris [Duhon] made an unbelievable play to win it for us." Duhon's reverse layup with 
6.5 seconds left in overtime gave Duke its 16th straight vic­tory overall and fifth in the last six years on North Carolina's home court. 
This one was over first-year Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, and the former assistant to Dean Smith left the court as did predecessors Bill Guthridge and Matt Doherty, losers at home to Duke. 
"That was a big-time college basketball game and it's tough saying that when you're on the short end," Williams said. "If I could coach to the enthusiasm we had in the building, I'd be one hell of a coach." 
Shelden Williams had 22 points and 12 rebounds for Duke (19-1, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). He had two of his five blocks in overtime and also came up with a big defensive play in the final minute to force a turnover by the Tar Heels (13-6, 35). 
"I told Shelden after the game, 'Your post defense was best when most people will 
I have played their worst -the ' ,. end of the game,"' Krzyzewski 
I 
I said. 
I Daniel Ewing scored 19 
I points for Duke, while Deng had 17 points and 12..cebounds, and J .J. Hedick added 14 points. 
Rashad McCants scored 27 points for North Carolina, including the 3-pointer with 13 seconds left that tied the game at 81. Sean May had 15 points and 21 rebounds for the Tar Heels, but was 7 -for-18 from the field and missed a ·number of close-in shots. 
"I told the team we all could point to one or two plays that you could have made that you didn't make that would have made a difference," Hoy Williams said. "We had a lot of opportunities early from 2 or 3 feet, and we just didn't make the baskets." 
The sellout crowd of 21,750, most wearing "Turn It Blue" T­shirts, was loud all night -but it was roaring and shaking the floor when McCants' fast-break dunk with 5:45 to go gave North Carolina a 69-62 lead. 
Duke then turned up the defense and went on a 10-0 run, taking a .72-69 lead on two free throws by Deng with 1 :06 left. · 
"That was the pivotal point of the game because a lot of teams would have been run out of here," Krzyzewski said. "All of a sudden we had the lead, which I think was shocking. That showed our team played major, major manly minutes." · 
May scored on a rebound with 53 seconds to go, and Redick restored the three-point lead on a drive with 38 seconds left. 
-North Carolina called a time­out, and Jawad Williams hit his only 3-pointer of the game with 18 seconds to go to tie it. Ewing missed a 3 with 3 seconds left for Duke. 
Shelden Williams was a force inside in the overtime. His defense forced North Carolina into a 35-second shot clock vio­lation with 22 seconds left. Redick then made two free throws to make it 81:78 and McCants, who finished 2-for-4 from 3-point range, drilled the 3 that tied it and set the stage for Duhon's heroics. 
"Those two shots they hit, come on," Krzyzewski said. "Those aren't shots kids are supposed to hit. Men do. They're the best team we have played." 
Duhon said it helped the team's confidence that Krzyzewski didn't call a time­out after either of the tying 3­pointers. 
"He told us he wanted us to win the game," said Duhon, who did. "I just kept going and it opened up and I was able to make the layup. I don't think anybody on either team could've handled [another overtime]. I tried to do both of us a favor." 
Melvin Scott missed a 3 at the buzzer for North Carolina, and it was appropriate that Shelden Williams grabbed the game's final rebound.

Irish face tough doubles test 
By KATE GALES Spons Writer 
No. 49 Notre Dame faces another tough match this week­end, as they face No. 53 Purdue at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
The Boilermakers will travel to Western Michigan on Saturday and then face the Irish on Sunday at 1 p.m. 
With a 2-0 record and wins against Ball State and Butler, the non-conference match to Purdue is not to be overlooked. A key point of this match will be doubles. 
"Purdue always comes out strong when they play us espe­cially in doubles," senior tri­captain Matthew Scott said. "(There's] always a tradition of really solid doubles; it was a focal point in practice this week." 
Irish coach Bobby Bayliss emphasized the doubles play as well. 
"We worked really hard on doubles," Bayliss said of his team's preparation this week. "Purdue just absolutely pulver­ized us last year in doubles matches -they won all three, and did so convincingly." 
This year's matchup presents a special challenge to the Irish, as their No. 1 doubles team of Luis Haddock and Ryan Keckley will not be playing. Haddock will be playing for Puerto Rico in the Davis Cup and Keckley remains out with an ankle injury suffered against Duke. Ranked No. 18 nationally, Haddock and Keckley are also the No. 1 and No. 6 singles play­ers, respectively. 
"The good news is that this is one of the deepest teams I've ever coached," Bayliss said. "We are filling their shoes with Matt Scott, who is capable of playing the No. 1 spot and is regaining the form he had. He played his best match in a long time against Duke, so I expect Matt to play extremely well." 


Eric Langenkamp and Patrick Buchanan are also expected to see time to fill out the Irish ros­ter. Langenkamp has yet to lose a match, and Buchanan won his singles match at No. 5 last year against Purdue in a 4-3 Irish victory. 
Bayliss expressed confidence in the ability of his freshmen and in the bottom part of the lineup for this weekend's match. 
"Usually, when you lose a cou­ple of players it's catastrophic, especially at No. 1," said Bayliss. "We're a stronger team with them, but I don't think that the task ahead of us is an impossible one." 
Scott agreed, as he and his teammates are ready for a tough mat~h. 
"This is a very important match," Scott said. "We're just looking to go out there and take care of business.... It's disap­pointing for us but I think pres­ents a challenge and the team is ready to rise to the challenge and meet it." 
But the Irish will have to do it without Haddock and Keckley. 
"It's some great motivation to beat a Big 10 team without two key players, a third of our start­ing lineup," said Bayliss. 
The Irish are set to face Purdue at 1 p.m. at the Eck Tennis Pavilion.

Iverson dominates in 76ers' home win

Belles look to knock off Hope 
Irish hope for 
By STEVE COYER 
Sports Writer 
After a demoralizing 65-42 loss to Calvin (16-3) at home, the Belles will have little time to recover as they go on the road to play the best team in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association. 
Saturday the Belles (6-14) will face MIAA leader Hope {19-2). 
The momentum from a criti-· cal win Monday against Olivet failed to carry over into Wednesday's game against Calvin. Despite a second half comeback, the Belles only shot 27 percent from the field and the 36-18 halftime deficit proved to be too much to over­come. 
In the Belles 67-64 victory against Tri-State Jan. 24, Emily Creachbaum led the team with 26 points. However, in the last three games, Creachbaum has scored a total of 16 points, 10 of those points coming in the win over Olivet. 
As a result, the bench has taken a more active role with strong efforts from Bridget Lipke, Anne Hogan and Bridget Boyce. 
Against Olivet, the bench combined to score 33 points. As a result, the bench players saw nearly as much floor time as the starting five. 
The Belles have had a prob­lem with turnovers when they have played aggressive teams this year. In their loss to Calvin, the Belles had 2 3 turnovers and had difficulty finding open shots. 
Hope's dominating offense will also provide a challenge for Saint Mary's, averaging 73 points per game this year. Hope has also held opponents to 34 percent shooting. 
On the other hand, the Belles' offense has struggled this year and has averaged 58 points per game on 37 percent shooting. 
Despite this, the Belles look to come away with an upset on Saturday. 
"We just need to play togeth-

depth." 
In addition to the Cleveland 

State match-up, Welsh 
stressed the importance of the 
Oakland match-up less than 
24 hours later. 
"It's very important for us to 

be able to race at night and 
then the following day," Welsh 
said. "This is set up for cham­
pionship time, so we're eager 
to see that." 
Last Saturday, Notre Dame 

won 11 of the 13 overall 
events to wrap up a 5-2 
January with a 159-75 thrash­
ing of St. Bonaventure (6-5) in 
the Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
The meet's results were 

never in doubt as the Irish 
won each of the first ten 
events, including the top three 
spots in the first five. 
"We're happy with how we 

swam this past weekend," 
freshman Chris Zeches said. 
"We know that with two more 
weeks of rest we're going to 
be ready for go for Big East." 
Freshman Ted Brown 

(1,000-yard freestyle and 200­
yard freestyle) and sophomore 
Jaime Lutkus (200-yard indi­
vidual medley and 500-yard 
freestyle) both won a pair of 
races. Freshmen Tim 
Kegelman (50-yard freestyle), 
Zeches (200-yard backstroke) 
and Scott Coyle (1-meter div­
ing), sophomore Tim Randolph 
(100-yard freestyle) and senior 
J.R. Teddy (200-yard butterfly) each contributed with an indi­vidual event victory. 
The women's squad looks to 

take care of Oakland in its 
final tune-up before the Big 
East Championships when the 
No. 21 Irish (7-2) welcome the 
Golden Grizzlies to the Rolfs 
Aquatic Center Saturday at 1 
p.m. 
"They have a pretty good team and always have some strong swimmers in the sprint events..which should present a different type of challenge for us," head coach Bailey Weathers said. "It will proba­bly be a little low key as com­pared to last weekend's meets, but still a lot of fun for the girls." 
Last Friday, the Irish won 11 overall events as they defeated two Big Ten squads on the road in East Lansing, Mich. Seniors Danielle Hulick (1 00 backstroke and 50 freestyle), Lisa Garcia (200 butterfly and 200 individual medley) and Meghan Perry Eaton (l-and 3­meter board) and freshman Katie Carroll (1 00 and 500 freestyle), each posted a pair of event victories as the Irish trounced Michigan State and Ohio State, 160-138 and 194­105, respectively. 
However, Notre Dame ran into trouble the following afternoon at home with No. 16 Michigan. 
Dropping each of the meet's first three races, the Irish were never able to rebound as the Wolverines took nine of the 16 events en-route to a 166-134 
Following this weekend, both the men and women will set their sights on the Big East Championships Feb. 19 to 21 in New York.

The men's swimming and diving team hopes to secure a winning dual meet record for the seventh time in nine years when the Irish (6-7) play host to Cleveland State (9-2) tonight at 7 p.m. and Oakland (5-3) Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. in the Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
While the Vikings have won their last four meets, the Irish have taken 16 of the last 17 meetings between the two schools, including each of the last eight. 
"Cleveland State is a chance for us to even our record," head coach Tim Welsh said. "So far they've been having an excellent season. One of the interesting match-ups will be some of their speed against what we hope is a lot of our

grew even stronger. In fact, Grisham -for his

joked that he felt obligated to

"I wanted to be here tonight. because I feel like I owe you one, and because Paul [Mainieri] was gracious enough to invite me." he said. "Although I did not grow up an ardent supporter of Notre Dame, I have become a huge fan of this baseball program." 
Part of Grisham's support has come recently with his ties to Virginia -a school that is con­sidered a northern program when it comes to baseball. The author understands the plight of northern schools like Notre Dame in trying to overcome obstacles such as wintry weather conditions, a late start to the season and recruiting difficulties stemming from their northern locations. 
"Over the years. it's been a rough adjustment for me as an enormous college baseball fan to belong to a northern school," Grisham said. "I've become very keenly aware of the un­level playing field that exists

when it comes to college base­ball, and I hope that some day soon we can get a common start to make all things fair for us northern schools." When the Irish overcame these obstacles in 2002 -earning their first No. 1 ranking and a trip to the College World Series for the first time since 1957 -Grisham was there cheering them on for northern schools everywhere that face similar problems 
"The real wakeup call came two years ago, when we looked up one morning and Notre Dame was No. 1 in the nation," Grisham remembered. "That was a huge moment, not just for you guys, but for a lot of us that realized it can be done. And when Notre Dame went to Omaha, and Nebraska was there too, we had two northern schools. We became rabid Notre Dame fans, because they were winning." 
Grisham concluded his speech with a hopeful message for college baseball fans about the growth of the sport in the past two and a half decades. 

"It's become very rewarding in the past 25 years or so to see college baseball become such a popular sport," he said. "I think it's more popular now than it ever has been. The attendance figures go up every year.. Attendance at the regionals and super regionals goes up every year, and crowds of 10,000 to 15,000 are not unu,sual at these events." 
In his final message, Grisham appealed to local Notre Dame fans to take advantage of the Irish program and to support their team. 
"You have great college base­ball here. You have a wonder­ful program played by great kids and a wonderful coach," he said. "So I encourage all the fans to come out this spring and support the team, and I hope to see you in Omaha." 
Notre Dame plays its first game Feb. 20, when the Irish take on San Diego State in Los Angeles.

behind Ohio State and Western Michigan for fifth place, and two points behind third-place Michigan State and Alaska Fairbanks. 
Notre Dame earned three-of­four points against Alaska Fairbanks last weekend, defeat­ing the Nanooks 3-2 on Friday and tying 2-2 Saturday. The Irish have two games in hand on Alaska Fairbanks and one on Western Michigan. 
"From top to bottom, this is as competitive a league as I've seen," Poulin said. "The group in the middle that's vying for home ice advantage in the playoffs ­they're all right there close to each other. Even the teams in the weaker half of the league are good teams that can beat any­one." 
The Irish will face a Miami team set on revenge for last sea­son, when Notre Dame knocked the RedHawks out of the first round of the CCHA playoffs. The Irish fell behind in game one of the three-game series, dropping a 4-2 decision in Oxford on Mar. 14, but goalie Morgan Cey and the rest of the team rebounded to collect 1-0 and 5-0 shutouts over the final two games. 
Notre Dame advanced to the CCHA Super Six in Detroit, despite being the lower ranked seed (No. 7 to Miami's No. 6) in the first round and having to play on the road. 
Special teams will likely play a large part in this weekend's series, with the Irish penalty kill currently on a three game (14 straight kills) streak. Miami boasts one of the top power play units in the CCI-lA, connecting at a 21.2 percent clip, and it will be imperative for the Irish to stifle thatunit. 
"This is the traditional clash of offense versus defense," Poulin said. "But the best defense against a good power play is to not take penalties. The discipline is a real factor because when you're killing three or four power plays rather than seven or eight, you're a lot fresher and you make better decisions on the ice." 
The Irish offense that averages 
2.73 goals per game. 
"No-matter where you play, scoring first is always a big part of getting a win. It's important to come out and get some confi­dence, and get your team up on its toes and moving in the right direction," Poulin said.

scoring average. 
The last time these two teams met, March 1, 2003, the Irish escaped with a 62-60 win at home on Katy Flecky's two free throws with two seconds to play. So this year, the Irish are ready for a challenge. 
"Overall, they're a greaC defensive team," Irish coach MufTet McGraw said. "They're terrific rebounders, and they're really athletic. They hold teams down. It's going to be a challenge for us." 
The Pirates out-rebound 

their opponents by almost ten 
rebounds per game, as they 
average 41.7 rebounds to 
opponents' 31.9. Notre Dame, 
on the other hand, averages 
37.2 rebounds per game. "We're going to work on rebounding," McGraw said. 
The Irish hope to carry their performance at home on the road, as they are 10-0 at the Joyce Center this season. But after two road wins in the past two weeks, the Irish feel as though they have figured out how to play on the road. 
"Winning the Syracuse and Miami games have really given us confidence on the road," McGraw said. "We've really got to stay focused. Every game is really important for us and the team knows that." 
Notre Dame, led by Jacqueline Batteast {15 points, 
8.3 rebounds per game) and Megan Duffy (11.4 points, 4.6 assists per game), has won 11 of their last 14 games since starting the season 3-4. 
"We really took a lot of lumps early on, and we were fortunate that we were able to maintain our mental tough­ness because that was a long stretch," McGraw said. "I think this team has been really resilient this year." 
The Irish success has been in large part due to their com­mitment to defense, according to McGraw. Players know that they will play only if they excel on defense, and McGraw has shown this throughout the sea­son in her substitutions. 
"Putting Monique Hernandez in the starting lineup was a huge sign that we're serious about [defense]," McGraw said. "The other people are starting to improve defensive­ly. We're definitely starting our best defensive group. I think that by substituting, they're getting the picture." 
Notre Dame hopes to carry over their defensive intensity this weekend on the road, in what could prove to be anoth­er defensive battle. 
"Seton Hall is another great team and a big test for us on the road," McGraw said. "That's going to be a big chal­lenge for us to go out there. They're a great defensive team, so it should be another defensive battle, but it's one that we're looking forward to."

BASEBALL 
For the love of the game 
Grisham speaks of affinity for college baseball in opening dinner 

By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
<. The 2004 Irish baseball sea,. son officially got under way Thursday night as the team hosted the Opening Night Dinner with guest speakers John Grisham and former Notre-Dame All-American Steve Stanley. Grisham, a rabid amateur baseball enthusiast and recent follower of the Notre Dame program, talked about his love of collegiate baseball and the role the sport has played throughout his life in the rural South. "College baseball is fun to watch, and that is one of the reasons it's my favorite sport," the author said. "I go to [the College World Series in] Omaha, Neb., every chance I get just to watch great base­bail. The reason I love the sport is that its great baseball played by great players." Grisham extolled the virtues of amateur baseball, especially on the collegiate level, for the great love and respect the players have for their favorite past time. 
"These kids respect the game, they know how to play it, they respect their schools and they're proud of their schools," Grisham said. "That's why I love college baseball. It's a great game, played by great kids at great schools like this." 
The author contrasted the devotion that players on the collegiate level have to the game and to their schools with the selfishness and "me-first" attitude that often arises in professional baseball. 
"College baseball players hustle, and for somebody that is a fan of the game, there is nothing so rewarding as to watch a kid hustle," he said. "And there is nothing more frustrating than to watch pro­fessionals who will not." 
"College baseball players play for the name on the front of the uniform, and not the one on the back. They love their schools. They respect the game, and that's the corner­stone of college baseball." 
In the last few years, Grisham has developed sever­al ties to the Irish baseball program. The attraction start­ed. in the 2000 NCAA

The two schools played three grueling games in 24 hours before the Bulldogs eventually triumphed with a ninth-inning home run for a 10-9 win in the championship game. Grisham, a Mississippi State graduate, was unable to attend the regional that year, but he got a full report from friends and family about the feisty Irish team.

February stretch make or break for the Irish 

By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 

Mike Brey is not a coach nor­mally given to using superla­tives. 
But ask the Irish basketball coach what he thinks of Notre Dame's February schedule, and Brey offers a weak smile. 
"This is," he said, "the tough­est February ever in this pro­gram's history." 
Just how tough is the gaunt­let the Irish must run? The month's first seven games are all against teams whose RPI rating places them among the nation's top 30. 
After losing 76-69 to Boston College, the first team in that stretch, Wednesday night, Notre Dame faces a difficult stretch when they host Pittsburgh and Connecticut in a 48-hour span beginning Saturday. 
Then, the Irish get the better part of a week ofT before host­ing Seton Hall, but two days later, have to travel to Syracuse. Five days go by before the Irish have to play Connecticut -in Hartford, this time -and then host Providence. The murderous stretch concludes with a trip to Los Angeles to play UCLA. 
It's enough to make any head coach whimper. 
And with the Irish (10-8, 4-3 in the Big East) teetering on the brink of failing .to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, the Irish have to manage to get several quality wins during

"We're a little younger this time around, and we have the talent," Jones said. "But the older guys have to step up and get that eight-game winning streak. 
"Leadership is what we need most right now."

"Nobody is thinking about the NIT," Cornette said defiantly. 
He didn't have to add that the Irish have enough on their minds already.

Brey had led the Irish to three straight NCAA Tournaments in his first three years at Notre Dame. Yet he faces arguably his most difficult task this year in trying to get the Irish to make a fourth straight trip.  There's two themes here. Notre Dame often begins games trying to get the ball to Francis in the post. But as the game wears on, the Irish tend to move away from Francis and win games with their outside shooting.  One of the best big men in the Big East, Francis is a formidable weapon if he gets his hands on the ball. Cornette and Timmermans have both been playing well lately, as well, giving the Irish a couple options down low.  With Thomas strug­gling, Quinn has emerged as the center of Notre Dame's offen­sive attack. Jones gives the Irish a slashing, penetrating attack when he moves to the basket, and he's easily the team's most vocal leader.  The Irish have used largely a seven-man rotation all season long. While Cornette and Timmermans have done well off the bench, Falls has yet to emerge as the deadly shooter he was pur­ported to be.  The Joyce Center can get rocking for big games, and Notre Dame's student sec­tion is one of the loud­est in the league. However, the Irish have struggled at home this season.

In his first year at Pittsburgh, Dixon has kept the Panthers among the league's elite. Pittsburgh was undefeated late into the season, and many are projecting this team as a potential Final Four candidate.  The Panthers play a style of basketball simi­lar to Notre Dame, where they use the 3­point shot to beat teams s.enseless. However, they also have a strong physical presence inside and often out-rebound their opponents.  Brown, Troutman and Taft compose the Panthers' inside game. All three are shooting over 50 percent from the field, and combined, they generate an aver­age of 32 points a game.  Page is far and away the deep threat of this year's team. His range is equivalent to that of Irish graduate Matt Carroll's, but he can also create shots off the dribble. The freshman, Krauser, has performed well at the point guard spot all year.  The Panthers can go eight-deep with ease, and they have an inter­changeable lineup that allows them to start different players on dif­ferent nights with mini­mal drop-off. No bench player averages more than 10 points a gam(~. however.  One of the league's toughest teams to beat at home, the Panthers have only played four games on the road this year. What's more, this team has a chance to challenge for a Big East title -something not lost on the Panthers when they play.

Calhoun is easily one of the nation's most respected coaches, and year after year. the Huskies are always in the hunt for a Big East title. A large part of that has to do with Calhoun's effective leadership.  Pick your poison -this year's version of the Huskies will kill you inside with Okafor or outside with Gordon. Connecticut's strength is in its versatility of offen­sive weapons, and five players are averaging double-digit point totals since league play began.  There's no question Okafor is the Big East's best big man. The only question that remains is if he's the nation's best player. He shoots a whopping 61 percent from the field, averages a double-double each game, and ha.<; blocked 96 shots this year.  Gordon is an effective perimeter player, shoot­ing 43 percent from 3­point range, but he is also a great point guard. He's complimented well by Brown, a slashing guard who picks the Huskies up on the rare occasion when Okafor and Gordon are off.  Connecti.cut can go eight or nine players deep, running bodies at opposing teams to tire them out. Their depth is one of their greatest strengths, and defense is a hallmark of Calhoun-coached teams.  Ranked No. 1 in the nation at one point this year, the Huskies are a team on a mission. Okafor's calm leader­ship helps guide Connecticut in close ·games, and the Huskies have only lost one game on the road this year.

With a difficult game against Connecticut looming, the Irish will be eagerly motivated to get a win. Their. NCAA Tournament hopes are starting to slip away, and this game against Pittsburgh-who the Iric;;h almost beat ­is a must win.

Calhoun has made seven1l trip!>-.Jo the Final.,Four,qwb,ile Brey is stilf trying tQ g_et the Irish· past the Sweet 16. Plus, while Brey is trying to sorf-otlt his teamii struggles, Calhotfn ·has the Huskies running like a fine-tuned machine.  It will be tough for the Ir\Sh·to.match up with.' Connecticut's inside-outsfde combo of Okafor and Gordon. Plus~ 'connecticut's deep bench will hurt an Irish· team that relies heavily on its starters for minutes.  The matchup betwe~n f.r.alicis and Cornette and Okafor will .be intrtgwng; Still, Oka.for is an in~redible defender and r-eoound­er who has excellent basketball kno~ledge the Irish have yet to demonstrate.  As good as Thomas and Ql,lilUl CaJl. be when their shots are falling, the pair has ~ tv have goodgames in the same ga~, Jones··may be called on t6 contain Gordon, but the Huskies just maJb{(foo deep for Notre Dame's guards to handle.  Again, there is little doubt here who has the edge,.} Connecticut's deptb'·enables th,.em to run bodies at teams, thu~.tkeeping tha:;stars fresh' down the stretch. The lrisjl, .however, look tired fn close games because they lack the bench support.  This is hands-down the biggest game in the Joyce Center this year. If the Irish faithful aren't rocking and the players aren't fired up for this game, they won't be at all. The key for Notre Dame will be their abili­ty to weather the inevitable lluskie run.
