Annual Senior Block Party held 
By JEFF SWANSON News Staff 
The eighth annual Senior Class Block Party was held in the Joyce ACC on Friday, giving Notre Dame students and members of the South Bend community an opportunity to enjoy a variety of perfor­mances and different ethnic foods. 
Chris Lee, co-organizer of the event, called the party "an at­tempt to bring the Notre Dame and South Bend communities together in an effort to enhance relations ... We've gotten a lot of positive feedback, e.specially from the northeast neighbor­hood," Lee said.

The army command con­firmed that there was "ac­tivity" in Madama but said it had no reports of injuries. 
Three Israelis suffered injur­ies when buses they were riding in were pelted with rocks in the West Bank. 
In Lebanon, an Israeli soldier was killed and four others in­jured when their armored per­sonnel carrier overturned Sun­day in southern Lebanon, the army said. "It was a road ac­cident," said an army spokes­man, who declined to elabo­rate. 
Israel radio said the accident occurred north of the Lebanese city of Naqoura, two miles north of the Israeli border in Israel's self-declared buffer zone. The zone is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and the 2,000-member South Lebanon Army. 
Meanwhile, underground PLO leaders distributed leaflets praising the declara­tion of an independent Pales­tinian state last week by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.

boost the 11-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The pro-PLO leaders also urged Moslem fundamentalist extremists to stop criticizing the declaration publicly. 
"Whether you like it or not, that will serve the enemy," said the leaflet, signed by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. 
The pro-PLO leaders called for "escalating the struggle" against Israel in the next two weeks and announced three one-day strikes. 
Maglicic said that the party "opened communication lines between Notre Dame students and South Bend residents and allowed South Bend residents to see what the Notre Dame community is about." 
The party featured shows every half-hour including Hawiian and Mexican dancers, performances by the Shenanigans and by bag-pipe players. Music between the shows was supplied by Notre Dame's WVFI. 
"The party came off really well and I was glad so many people came," Maglicic said. Lee and Maglicic also ex­pressed their gratitude for the volunteers who gave much time and effort to help make it all happen. 
Egypt on Sunday became the latest nation to recognize the Palestinian state. A statement said it hoped the proclamation would "serve the cause of

region."

The committee also recom­mended the University finance the Weekend Wheels Program, which is currently funded by the Hall Presidents' Council. 
Bishop said he was very happy with the Trustees' rep­sonse to the report, and com­mented, "I think it (the report) really opened a lot of eyes. This was a relatively new issue, and I think the Board was really interested--especially with all the emphasis that's recently been placed on street crime and drunk driving." 
Karen Flaherty, chairman of the parking committee, said the parking issue was ad­dressed primarily because, "there seemed to be no organi­zation at all in regard to the current parking situation." 
The committee proposed several immediate and long­term measures which would enhance the present parking system, such as improving the condition of the lots, increasing the number of available parking spaces and adding se­curity measures to deter crime in the lots. 
According to Flaherty, stu­dent government will work in conjunction with Associate Vice President of Residence Life John Goldrick, a member of the Committee on Parking, to implement some of the sug­gested proposals. 
According to Blantz, "The meeting between the students and the Trustees was very worthwhile, because it ed­ucated the Board in regard to students' concerns." 
Doyle commented, "The people who worked on the reports really did a fantastic job ; they definitely turned out a quality report."

University must challenge racism 
In light of the recent student­performed "blackface" at the Sorin Hall Talent Show (Sorin Hall-­residence of University President Ed­ward A. Malloy), many students once again engage in their yearly examina­tion of race relations at this University. Once again, these students who dare look at what's really happening in terms of racism (blatant or subtle) must come to the same conclusion: rac­ism and racial ignorance is still alive and well at the nation's premier Cath­olic university. 
Lionel Coleman 
guest column 
This very sad tradition at Notre Dame continues unhindered, and the University has once again failed to take any effective means to stop racism, ra­cial ignorance, and other social injus­tices (namely continued investment in companies dealing in any way with South Africa and sexism). The fact that such gross racism and racial ignorance exists leads many to believe that the lack of decisive action concerning these matters signifies a leadership problem. 
With these thoughts in mind, many students call the University's Board of Trustees, the University president, and the rest of the University administra­tion and faculty to demonstrate ed­ucated, sensitive, and truly effective leadership in order to change this "benign environment" in which racism and sexism can survive. In other words we call Notre Dame's leadership to recall its mission and to live up to its goals. 
If we, including the individuals per­forming in the "blackface" skit who came to realize and took steps to cor­rect their ignorance (and we commend their actions and intents), are to oper­ate under the presumption that we are members of the Notre Dame commu­nity, we have the right and obligation 
Student learns about thanks and giving 
A few weeks ago, when the rest of you were watching the Irish destroy Pitt, I unexpectedly went to Chicago to visit my friend, David. We spent the day shopping and visiting the Art In­stitute, and in the evening, topped it off with stuffed pizza from Giordano's. Dinner was delicious but, as every pa­tron of Giordano's knows, too filling to finish; consequently, we wrapped two of the remaining pieces for David's roommate, and one for mine, and went on our way. 
Christine McCann 
guest column 
Since it was only seven o'clock and I didn't have to meet my ride until eight, we walked to the Water Tower to watch the outdoor street performers. We were talking and laughing, paying little at­tention to anyone but ourselves, when we came upon a man who looked to be about ten years older than he really was. He had long hair and a beard and bad teeth, and was scrabbling through a garbage can looking for something to eat. 
We walked on past and pretended not to look, but my eyes filled up because I suddenly realized just how insig­nificant my little troubles are. 
I worry about getting an "A" on a paper or finding a date for a dance; this man spends each day of his life contemplating how closely he teeters between death and survival. We turned around and walked back, and I stood and watched David gain all of my respect and admiration in one of the most dignified exchanges I have ever witnessed. He said, "Sir, would you like some pizza?.'' And the guy smiled his

toothless grin and answered almost philosophically, "Yeah...thanks.. .I like pizza." 
I walked away and felt very good--not because I'd spent a day foraging through Marshall Field's Thirty­Percent-Off Sale and needed to quell my capitalistic guilt, but because it made me realize how good life is. Even in the midst of glaring poverty and op­pression, there is a sense of human dig­nity and spirit in this world which is almost unbreakable. Some might say that there is a lack of dignity in digging through cast-offs, but I'd disagree. Having the ability to accept a meal with a simple "thank you" shows perhaps the greatest courage of all. 
Hell Week is coming up for a lot of us, and with exams and papers coming out of my ears, I'm no exception. Nevertheless, I'll take time out tonight to walk to the Grotto, kneel down, and pray. I won't say long, complicated prayers or stay there for hours; in­stead, I'll simply whisper, "Thank you, thank you." Because, after all, is there any better way for us to express all that we feel? 
Christine McCann is a sophomore En­glish and history major. 
to change this University for the bet­terment of its principle beneficiaries, its students. We have the right and ob­ligation to challenge our University's Board of Trustees, its president, admin­istration, and faculty to stand up and make a bold, national statement on col­lege racism and its detrimental effects. 
We exj>ect such a statement from the nation's premier Catholic university, and we have the right to challenge the "powers that be" when they mis­represent members of the Notre Dame community. Notre Dame is seen worldwide as a first-rate Catholic uni­versity and its leadership must clearly define its position and efforts in these matters. The African-American stu­dent population, as well as the rest of the student body, wants to know exactly the leadership's sentiments about these matters and about the dark cloud over the Golden Dome--that is, continued in­vestment in companies dealing (directly or indirectly) in South Africa. 
The student body, and especially the African-American student community, has serious questions about the Univer­sity's leadership and its sincerity in dealing with the aforementioned issues. The student body deserves a Presiden­tial Statement. The African-American community, as well as other so-called "minority" communities, simply deserves better. 
We know that we cannot challenge the University's leadership without of­fering some constructive recommen­dations. The ND:SMC NAACP proposes the following: 
First, the establishment of a Univer­sity Study on the Racial and Sexual At­titudes of members of the Board of Trustees, administration, faculty, and student body. 
Second, the establishment of a task­farce to combat racism and sexism based out of a proposed "Office of Race and Gender Awareness" located in either the LaFortune Student Center or the Administration Building. 
Third, a presidential directive to each dormitory and the Office of Student Af­fairs, and student government to dis­cuss racial, ethnic, and gender sensi­tivity. 
Fourth, a presidential visit to each dormitory, the Office of Student Af­fairs, and student government to inves­tigate what efforts have been taken to eliminate this benign environment that allows racism and sexism to grow un­checked. 
Fifth, a presidential directive to each dormitory to establish a race/gender awareness committee. 
Sixth, a presidential statement to each college dean and department head 
(1) directing these individuals to sup­port minority student awareness func­tions and (2) emphasizing to these in­dividuals the implications of not doing so. 
Seventh, a presidential statement to the Vice President of Student Affairs stressing the importance of monitoring and editing senseless and tasteless ac­tions taken on the part of members of the student body and establishing cor­rective measures when such actions are taken. 
Eighth, a presidential directive that each racial andlor sexual offense will be handled by the proposed Office of Race and Gender Awareness and that a report be given to a proposed Race and Gender Awareness Board and the Office of Student Affairs. The Office of Student Affairs will take corrective measures and the Race and Gender Awareness Board, out of the proposed Office of Race and Gender Awareness, will issue a report to the Board of Trus­tees, who will, hopefully, look at cor­recting the problem at the institutional level. 
Ninth, a presidential commitment to be more accessible to minority student organizations through periodic visits to their meetings and functions if properly notified. 
Tenth, a presidential statement to the whole Notre Dame community and the nation concerning the need for campus racial and gender sensitivity and ac­tions taken by the University of Notre Dame to address these issues. 
If the University can study and take actions to cure the sickness of al­coholism, through the Office of Alcohol and Drug Awareness, why cannot the University take similar actions dealing with the sickness of racism, sexism, and other social injustices? To many students and in many ways, this is the best of times and the worst of times. Minority student enrollment is slowly increasing. Through such unfortunate yearly events as the "blackface" skit in the Sorin Hall Talent Show, many students find themselves shut out from the Notre Dame community. To be a true part of the Notre Dame family each of us must constantly battle rac­ism and sexism. 
Notre Dame students must take many tests. Now the University's lead­ership, from the Board of Trustees and its president to its newly-hired instruc­tors and teaching assistants, must take a test. This is a test of the moral and ethical fortitude of the University's leadership concerning racial and sexual harmony. Since Notre Dame and its leadership are nationally recognized and emulated, this test accurately serves as a litmus test of the advance­ments in terms of race and gender re­lations. The students will monitor this test; there will be no curving of grades and, as always, the Honor Code is in effect. Many students wish you good luck on your test.

Mischief brings fame to computer guru 
Who says that it is difficult to get fa­mous in modern times? There is a really quick--and fun--way to get fa­mous. Mr. Robert Morris, Jr., at the age of 23, just demonstrated how to do it. The clue to fame in our times is not to burn the Temple of Apollo, or Jeffer­son Memorial, or Washington Monu­ment, but rather to perform some harmless mischief, harmless yet provocative enough to stir a troubling sense of intellectual inferiority in the adult society. 
Xiao Xiang 
guest column 
Mr. Morris petit is famous now. The TV networks spread his name across the nation overnight. For days the newspapers around the country reserved the headlines for his legen­dary deeds. Throngs of journalists chase him down the streets and dig out his anecdotes from whoever has neared him. All of a sudden, the Morris petit out-famed the Morris grand, his father, the famed computer expert whose fame is hard-won through scores of years' toil. Nothing else can again cheer the 
public up. 
Indeed, everybody is amused, everybody--but badly enough--except Morris petit himself. He is scared. Right, he amused everbyody else but scared himself. Mischief done, he could have sat back with a Lite or a Bud and enjoyed the fun of seeing a nation of computer experts--his dad included-­bugging around like a nest of disturbed ants, yet instead, he sat worrying. Only his mom's presence could give him enough courage to be interviewed by the reporters. This makes him a less than perfect hero. He had the guts to do it, but hasn't the guts to enjoy it. Alas! With a little more courage, he could not only have out-famed his fa­ther but also out-heroed Colonel North and thereby eased Americans' hero­crave. 
If Morris petit did it less than per­fectly, proving that a hero does not have to wear a coat of armor, Herr Rust, der Deutch Jung, did it nearly perfectly. A year ago, he did what Goring had not dared to dream: traversing thousands of miles of Soviet air defense and lan­ding his little plane right at the center of Red Square, amongst those onion­headed spires of Eastern Orthodox churches and the hammer-and-sickle patterned red flags, a prankster dragon-fly visiting a strange meddle blooming with odd flowers. With a grin on his face, he got down from the plane and was immediately surrounded by a cheering crowd. The journalists as well as KGBs, always present under Mos­cow's dull sky, flooded to him as he gave his signatures to his instantly con­verted fans. They still remember his unconcealable grin. 
Guys, if you want your picture to appear in the Paris Match beside those of the rich and the famous, don't write on mischief, make it. 
Mr. Rust's surprise visit to Moscow was no less surprising than Hitler's Blitzkrieg. No bomb was necessary, the news was explosive enough. It shocked the general of the Red Army's air force out of his office. The Pentagon must have loved it. But wait a minute, Pent­agon, wait until your turn comes, when even Dr. Strangelove can't help you. Last year the mischief befell your rival, this year it befalls you. Now everybody's curious to see who in Washington will be shocked out of his office this time for Mr. Morris petit's mischief. If anybody will be, Mr. Mor­ris grand most likely will be. If that happens, the son will have not only out­famed the father, but also out-officed the father. 
Mischief is probably one of the first things most of us learned in our early childhood. Known as the bad boy in the neighborhood, I did numerous mis­chiefs, but obviously, none of which was big enough to win me fame. If I had been rich enough to own a plane, I would have flown to Moscow before Mr. Rust did (although I knew my ex­socialist-brother would treat me brot­herly). If I had been a smart enough kid, I would have released very mean computer viruses. I was apparently nei­ther, so I end up writing this column on mischief which wins me neither fame nor buck. 
Guys, if you want your picture to ap­pear in the Paris Match beside those of the rich and the famous, don't write on mischief, make it. Make it big. The big­ger the mischief, the bigger your name.

Status quo not enough for GSU 
In the past few weeks, graduate stu­dents have been getting a lot of atten­tion. The Graduate Student Union has been working very hard to make the community aware of the situation of graduate students and is therefore ex­tremely pleased that this has been the case. We write this article to clear up some inaccuracies and misunderstand­ings that have been given expression in an article ("Graduate Students En­joy their Anonymity," Nov. 17) by a graduate student in the physics depar­tment. 
Victor J. Krebs GSU 
guest column 
First, the graduate student situation: The writer suggests that it is merely the GSU's opinion that "graduate stu­dents are treated poorly by the Univer­sity and that major changes in Univer­sity policy toward grads are needed." But the fact is that this situation is em­phatically recognized by graduate stu­dents and admitted by most members of the University administration. The writer himself wrote last semester, in an inflamatory leaflet passed around the Graduate Student Council mem­bers: "The purpose of the GSU is to promote the improvement of grad stu­dent life. In the two years I have been a grad student, conditions have not im­proved, but have only gotten worse." Things have not improved much since then, so we wonder what could have changed his mind. 
Second, graduate student represen­tation: The writer asks, "some grads have called for more 'representation' at the University. I'm not sure exactly what that means." It is alarming to us that, having been a departmental rep­resentative, the writer is still not quite clear about what he was supposed to be doing. But he continues, "there is practically nothing that any student or­ganization can do for me with ten years of resolutions and meetings that my ad­visor or my department can't do with a single phone call." Good for him. 
But the issue for the Graduate Stu­dent Union is the well-being not of one graduate student or even one depart­ment, but of the whole graduate student body. To that purpose, the GSU re­quires every department to designate representatives to the Council and tries to place graduate representatives in as many University committees as possi­ble to provide graduate student input for those decisions which affect us all in the Notre Dame community. Only in this concerted way can graduate stu­dents work as a unified body for the improvement of conditions in all con­cerned areas. 
Third, graduate student housing: It is false that "most students prefer to live off-campus," as the writer states in his article. In the 1987 Housing Sur­vey (of which the writer should have been aware since he was then a departmental representative) 42 per­cent of single graduate students preferred the on-campus option. Only 15 percent preferred off-campus housing, and the rest (43 percent) had no preference. One can reasonably ex­pect that, even if only for financial reasons, the on-campus alternative would be preferred by most of them. 
Of course the writer is right in claim­ing that the University cannot be forced into building housing for graduate stu­dents, nor is that what the GSU is sug­gesting we do. Nor are we "lilegging and pleading." Our task is to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the adminis­tration to make the University aware of the problem, until they recognize the urgency of the is"sue. In fact Fr. Malloy has recently reiterated the University's commitment to graduate housing during a forum in St. Edward's Hall by saying: "We are exploring now ways to finance the construction of graduate housing (on-campus) as soon as possi­ble." It is changes like this that are necessary and that the GSU is trying to help come about. 
Fourth, graduates and undergradua­tes: the writer suggests that the GSU's Graduate1Jndergraduate committee is expecting "that grad students try to be­come more like undergrads." This is foolish. (It is as foolish as to suggest that when we ask for more faculty­student interaction we are expecting faculty members to try to act like stu­dents again). He further claims that "(the GSU) demands that the Uni­versty treats us like undergrads." This is not only preposterous, it is also false. His fears that we may start being treated as undergrads are therefore to­tally unwarranted. The writer also as­sumes that we want graduates to inter­act with the undergraduates in their social functions. We know that is one of the areas where graduates and undergraduates have the least in com­mon, so we would be mistaken in trying to change that. 
The main purpose of the Graduate1Jndergraduate committee is to integrate graduate students into the life of the University, not to transform graduate students into undergraduates (or into administrators, or into anyth­ing else for that matter.) The thrust of our efforts is to improve the quality of life for graduate students. This means fulfilling their unique needs as well as helping to improve the cultural and in­tellectual life of the University by in­tegrating the distinctive identities of graduate students into the community. Our premise is, as we wrote in the 1988 'GSU report to the Board of Trustees, 
that as graduate students we have very much to contribute to the Notre Dame community. 
One specific area where graduates and undergraduates can indeed inter­act is the intellectual life of the com­munity. Now the writer is entitled to his unwillingness to participate in "in­tellectual activities" outside his school work. But there are plenty of graduate students who don't see their intellectual life restricted to their classrooom or lab hours. ~ioreover there are many graduate students who are happy for the opportunity to help other members of the community with their talents and experience. That may be altruistic. But if the GSU is being accused of being too altruistic, then we think the accusation speaks for itself. 
We at the GSU are all proud of these changes of late, and we will persevere and encourage others to join us in in­tegrating graduate students into the University community and in improv­ing the present quality of graduate student life despite the efforts of those few who are satisfied with the status quo, whatev{lr their reasons may be. Victor J. Krebs is the president of the Graduate Student Union.

Irish hockey destroyed by Lake· Forest 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Sports Writer 
The 1988-89 Notre Dame hockey schedule features some 

of  the  finest  teams  in  the  
country.  
Lake  Forest  is  not  one of  

them, but don't tell that to the Foresters. 
After losing to Notre Dame (3-7-2) five times last season, the Foresters returned to the Joyce ACC Fieldhouse with a vengeance Friday night, trouncing the Irish 5-1 en route to a sweep of the home-and­home series. Lake Forest com­pleted the sweep Saturday on their home ice with an 8-4 vic­tory over the Irish. 
Lake Forest exploded for four goals in the third period of Friday night's game, including three within just 71 seconds. A series of defensive miscues by the Irish sparked the Forester attack. 
"It's not that the players don't want to win," said Irish coach Ric Schafer, "we just keep making costly mistakes. We're not quick enough to cover up for those mistakes." 
Following a scoreless first period, forward Dennis Moran took a pass from Jeff Sather and slid the puck behind Irish goalie Lance Madson to give Lake Forest a 1-0 advantage in the second. The Irish applied consistent pressure on the Foresters, but failed to cash in on a number of scoring oppor­tunities. 
Right wing Andy Slaggert broke away down the left side of the ice in the first period, but his shot from the left face-off circle banked off the left cros­sbar. Left wing Matt Hanzel also had a chance to put the Irish on the board early, but his shot from the crease sailed just wide left of an open net. 
Notre Dame bounced back into the game two minutes and 35 seconds into the third stanza when Michael Curry skated out from behind the net and cen­tered the puck onto the blade of right wing Rob Bankoske, who slammed it home for the lone Irish score of the game. 
But just 35 seconds later Sat­her put the Foresters on top again, scoring amidst a flurry of activity around the Irish net. Forward Dan Slavin was credited with an assist on the play. Slavin, Sather and for­ward Glenn Whalen closed out the scoring for Lake Forest. 
"There are glaciers in Alaska that move faster than some of our players," said a solemn Schafer after the game. "We need an infusion of talented hockey players." 
Lake Forest catapaulted to a 5-1 lead in the first period Sat­urday night on its way to an 8-4 victory over Notre Dame. Once again, defensive breakdowns and a failure to convert scoring chances did in the Irish. 
"We had quite a few scoring opportunities," said Schafer. "We outshot our opponent, but we just didn't convert." 
Larry Bird is cooling his heels 
Associated Press 
BOSTON --Larry Bird under­went "very successful" sur­gery on both heels Saturday and the Boston Celtics' star should be able to return to bas­ketball in three to four months, his surgeon said. 
Dr. Arnold Scheller, who per­formed the 90-minute opera­tion, said Bird would remain hospitalized for one to two days and wear fixed casts for about six weeks. He estimated that for the following six weeks Bird would wear removable casts. 
Then, he said, it would be up to Celtics' Coach Jimmy Rodgers to decide when the 31­year-old Bird could play. 
Scheller said at a news con­ference that his reason for changing his original estimate of a three-month rehabilitation "is the potential for rupture" of the Achilles' tendons. The tendons were cut in both heels to remove the bone spurs that were irritating them. 
He said 30 percent of the sur­face area of the tendons was damaged in the operation, per­formed under general anes­thesia, rather than the 40 to 50 percent he suspected Friday night.

Bills clinch division early; Saints clobber Broncos 
Associated Press 
The AFC east race is over, sooner than it has ever been. 
Scott Norwood's third field goal, from 30 yards at 3:47 of overtime, gave the Buffalo Bills a 9-6 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday that clinched the division crown. Buffalo, at 11-1 the best record in the league, clinched earlier than any AFC team has won its division since the NFL went to a 16-game schedule in 1978. It was the Bills first division crown since 1980. 
Norwood's winning kick was set up by a fumble by New York's Roger Vick, who was stripped of the ball by Derrick Burroughs at the Jets' 32. The Bills ran four plays before call­ing on Norwood to win the game before Buffalo's seventh sellout crowd of the season. Many of those fans stormed the field and tore down the goal­posts. 
Said Bills owner Ralph C. wil­son Jr.: "it feels great because I remember when they were throwing programs at me." 
Not all of the fans had a good time, however--security workers said three fans may have suffered broken legs in the process of tearing down the $7,000 goalposts. 
The Bills have won seven straight, while the Jets, 5-6-1, have dropped their last three. 
Indianapolis, which won the division last year, was eliminated when it lost 12-3 at Minnesota. New England and Miami, the other two AFC East teams, played Sunday night, but neither can catch the Bills. 
Saints 42, Broncos 0 
At New Orleans, Bobby Hebert completed 20 of 23 passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns as the Saints re­corded their most lopsided win ever. They also took a two­game lead over the Rams in the NFC west and clinched their second consecutive win­ning season --the only two in team history. 
Hebert hit Eric Martin for 40­and 6-yard scores and also con­nected with John Tice for an 8­yard touchdown. Rueben

Mayes had 115 yards rushing, the first time in 20 games he has gone over the 100-yard mark since coming off knee surgery. 
Vikings 12, Colts 3 
At Minneapolis, the Vikings held Eric Dickerson to 72 yards and got four field goals from Chuck Nelson. 
The Vikings, 8-4, haven't al­lowed a rusher to gain 100 yards since Oct. 26, 1986, when Cleveland's Curtis Dickey had 
106. That's a span of 38 games, including the three with non­union players last season. 
The Colts, 6-6, had a five­game winning streak snapped. Dickerson, the NFL's leading rusher, failed to reach 100 yards for the third straight week but increased his season total to 1,237 yards, a club record. 
Eagles 23, Giants 17 
On the lOth anniversary of The Fumble, when the Eagles snatched a victory from appar­ent defeat at Giants Stadium, Philadelphia used a similar scenario. 
Clyde Simmons picked up a blocked field goal and ran 15 yards for the winning touch­down at 6:10 of overtime. Luis Zendejas set up for a 31-yard field goal attempt. Lawrence Taylor broke in and got a piece of the ball, sending it into the air. Simmons picked it up on the first bounce a yard behind the line of scrimmage and ran into the end zone. 
Chargers 38, Rams 24 
Mark Malone took over after 
Mark Vlasic suffered torn knee 
ligaments and guided San 
Diego to a pair of fourth­
quarter touchdowns by Barry 
Redden on 1-yard runs. 
Vlasic, starting just his 
second pro game, suffered the 
injury to his left knee late in 
the third quarter and will un­
dergo surgery and miss the rest 
of the season. Malone, who lost 
his starting job to Vlasic two 
weeks ago, threw an intercep-tion on the first play after he replaced Vlasic, then settled down, completing four of six for 128 yards as he kept the Chargers in front. 


Browns 27, Steelers 7 
In another game plagued by poor weather, the Browns beat the Steelers for the sixth straight time, dropping Pit­tsburgh to 2-10. The Steelers, non-winners at Cleveland since 1981, ensured themselves of matching their worst record in 19 years and have lost four in a row and 10 of their last 11 games. 
Frank Minnifield returned a

Adamonis) really strong, but the weather conditions made it tough." 
The Lewis offense adjusted quickly to the dismal weather, marching 40 yards on its first possession to set up an Ellen Mouch 12-yard touchdown run. The Chickens made it 8-0 when Mouch rambled in on the two­point conversion. 
"We knew we'd be in a good position if we scored first," said Mouch. "I just want to give the line credit. They blocked punt 11 yards for a first-half touchdown and Bernie Kosar threw a 77-yard scoring pass to Reggie Lan­ghorne on the second play of the second half. The 77-yard TD pass was the longest comple­tion of Kosar's career and the longest for the Browns, 7-5, since Frank Pitts caught an 80­yarder from Mike Phipps against the Jets in 1972. 
Lions 19, Packers 9 
Wayne Fontes' debut as Lions coach was a success be­cause Eddie Murray kicked four field goals and Scott Wil­liams scored on a 1-yard run. 
However, the flip of a coin may have been even more of a deciding factor. 
"They (Dillon) were in con­trol by just winning the toss," said Wightkin. "We weren't ex­ecuting offensively and they put on pressure by giving us the ball first." 
Schneider had missed on

The Blitz stormed right back on the following series, eating up 12:54 on an 82-yard drive. Marsh, who substituted at quarterback for injured Teresa Coombs, capped the Blitz at­tack by scampering 41 yards on a quarterback draw to make it 8-6. Then, with :06 left in the half, the B-P conversion at­tempt failed and it came back to haunt them in the end. 
"We didn't get the play going in the right way," said Marsh, who supplanted the quarter­back role well by amassing 109 total yards. "I was supposed to fake the pitch to the left and

Bears 27, Bucs 15 
In one of the few games played in good weather, Chicago beat Tampa for the 12th straight time. The Bucs, 3-9 and losers of six of their last seven, haven't beaten the Bears since 1982.

bootleg right, but I turned the wrong way." 
The second half was all B-P. The Blitz ate up most of the clock and controlled the ground game but could not find the endzone. In their final drive, the Blitz went to their bread and butter--freshman tailback Kristy Alkidas. Alkidas teamed with Marsh in an option attack that brought B-P inside the Lewis 10. But at that point, the Lewis defenders turned it up a notch and kept the Blitz out of the endzone. 
"It was really dissapointing to get the ball down the field and not be able to get anyth­ing," Marsh said, "but at that point it was even hard think. It was so cold and wet." 
The inclement weather al­most changed the site of the game to the Loftus Center but the Lewis players voted to keep it in the stadium. 
"It was to our advantage beacause they're quick backs had trouble cutting back on the wet field," said Mouch.

With all the talk and attention focused on Notre Dame and Southern California, the Uni­versity of Miami, Fla., still en­tertains notions of winning its second straight national cham­pionship. 
Miami's only loss of the season was to Notre Dame, 31­30, when the Hurricanes fumbled on the Fighting Irish 1-yard line. The third-ranked 'Canes now are 8-1 with regular-season games still to go against Cotton Bowl-bound Arkansas and Freedom Bowl­bound Brigham Young. 
On Saturday, Miami ac­cepted an invitation to meet Nebraska in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2, then clobbered 11th­ranked Louisiana State 44-3. 
Notre Dame, ranked No. 1, will finish out its regular­season schedule against No. 2 Southern Cal, then take on un­defeated and fourth-ranked West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. Southern Cal has a Jan. 2 Rose Bowl date against No. 12 Michigan. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame defeated Penn State 21-3 and Southern Cal captured the Pacific-10 Conference title and the Rose Bowl berth by downing No. 6 UCLA 31-22. 
Steve Walsh threw for 220 yards and two touchdowns in Miami's easy victory over Louisiana State, the worst home field setback for the Ben­gals since a 46-0 loss to Tulane in 1948. 
"I knew if they came out and kept making mistakes, this team is sharp enough to blow anybody out," Walsh said. "We got a lead and that helped. We really believed early that we could run the ball, and that helped when the monsoon started because you really couldn't see the receivers down field." 
LSU, 7-3, had its five-game 
winning streak snapped. 
Alabama might be watching 
the Jan. 2 bowl games on tele­
vision, but at least the Crimson 
Tide will have determined the 
makeup of two of the final 
postseason contests. 
On Friday, Alabama plays 
Auburn at Birmingham. If Al­
abama wins, Louisiana State 
will go to the Sugar Bowl on 
Jan. 2 to face Florida State, 
while Auburn will head to the 
Hall of Fame Bowl the same 
day to meet Syracuse. 
If Auburn wins, the Tigers will represent the Southeastern Conference in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans and Louisiana State will play in the Hall of Fame at Tampa, Fla. 
"I'm just thrilled to get to go to the Sugar Bowl," said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden. "Never having had the opportunity to play in it, it is going to be a great thrill for me." 
"They seem to be a very good team, better than us right now," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said of West Virginia. "I've watched them on film, 
but all I can remember is they wore white on one film and dark on the other." 
Victories Saturday by South­ern California and Nebraska settled four Jan. 2 matchups: the Orange, Rose, Cotton and Citrus Bowls. 
Southern Cal, by defeating UCLA 31-22, clinched the Pacific-10 Conference title and a Rose Bowl berth against Mic­higan. UCLA goes to the Cotton Bowl to meet Arkansas. 
"UCLA is an outstanding team, as good a team as there is in the nation," Arkansas Co­ach Ken Hatfield said. "They'll be doing a great job mixing up

Senior center Todd J adlow made 17 of 19 free throws in scoring a career-high 23 points as Indiana defeated No. 20 Stanford 84-73 Sunday night to reach the semifinals of the Big Apple NIT. 
Jay Edwards, who led all scorers with 27, made three 3­point shots and had 11 of In­diana's first 20 points as the Hoosiers moved ahead to stay early. He made his fifth 3­pointer of the night at the buz­zer. 
Battling a physical, aggres­sive Stanford squad, Indiana made the Cardinal pay by sinking 33 free throws and sen­ding five players to the bench on fouls. 
Indiana never trailed, taking the lead for good 13-11 on a tipin by Brian Sloan with 13:30 remaining in the opening half. The basket ignited a streak of eight straight points by Indiana that ended on an Edwards' 24­footer, putting the Hoosiers ahead 20-11 with 12: 01 left in the half. 
Stanford, which was led by Todd Lichti with 22 points, pulled to within five points five times before the half ended with Indiana ahead 32-27. The Cardinal pulled to within three twice early in the second half. 
N.C. 99, Georgia 91 
Scott Williams scored 25 points and Kevin Madden had 18 as sixth-ranked North Carolina knocked off Georgia 99-91 in Sunday's quarterfinals of the Big Apple NIT. 
The Tar Heels, 2-0, advanced to the semifinals at Madison Square Garden with two big scoring runs and a defense which held off a Bulldog rally late in the first half. 
Williams scored seven of the game's first nine points and contributed to North Carolina's 26-8 bulge in the first eight minutes. But Georgia, 1-1, rallied, using an 18-2 run to get within 28-26 after Sebastian Neal scored on a tap-in with 
7:24 left. 
Opening the second half much like the first, North Carolina went on a 15-0 tear and expanded its lead to 64-39 after a Rick Fox steal and dunk with 
16:57 remaining.

It almost was a case of bad news getting worse Friday night at the Joyce ACC. 
The Notre Dame basketball team was taken to the final seconds before winning an ex­hibition game 81-78 over Zadar of Yugoslavia, a team the Irish had defeated 120-81 a year ago. 
"You've got to get burned this way and hopefully it wakes you up," said Irish coach Dig­ger Phelps. "Our intensity and level of concentration will be much more improved in the next couple of weeks." 
Things got even scarier for the Irish after the game. While Zadar's Predrag Saric was missing a potential game-tying three-point shot in the final seconds, Irish freshman LaP­honso Ellis was lying in pain on the court. The 6-9 forward, who led all players with 15 rebounds, needed to be helped off the court. 
Ellis later was found only to have a bruised calf and will not miss any action. 
Zadar's Petar Popovic, who shot 9-of-14 from three-point range, led all scorers with 29 points. Jamere Jackson led the Irish with 21 points, while Saric added 20 for Zadar. 
Despite shooting just 43 per­cent and being outrebounded 23-19, the Irish led by as many as nine points during the first period. Zadar kept chipping away behind the three-point bombs of the 29-year-old Popovic, who scored 18 points (all on three-pointers) during the half. 
Zadar's Darko Pahlic fol­lowed the lead of Popovic at the buzzer, nailing a three-pointer from behind half court to tie the 36-36 at the half. 
For the game, Zadar shot 13­of-23 from three-point range and 17-of-40 on two-point shots. 
"It's a situation where you're used to going back from transi­tion and working from the in­side out," said Jackson. "They've got guys on the three­point lane, so you have to stop at the three-point lane and pick

up the shooters. That's what the coaches told us to do, but we weren't concentrating enough." 
Zadar led for the first few minutes of the second half, but Ellis tipped in Joe Fredrick's missed shot with 17 :11 left to give the Irish a 42-41 lead they never relinquished. 
Notre Dame again built its lead up to nine points, leading 68-59 with 7:22left in the game. But that's when Petrovic started the second act of his air show. 
Petrovic hit a trio of three­point shots in the next five minutes to help cut Notre Dame's lead to 76-73 with 2:16 to play. 
Notre Dame's lead was down to one when Saric hit a three­pointer with 15 seconds left. But Fredrick made both ends of a one-and,one with 12 seconds left for the final points of the game.

Irish set sights on NCAA's 
By MOLLY MAHONEY 
Sports Writer 
Leaving Kalamazoo, Mich., 
Saturday night, the Notre 
Dame women's volleyball 
team saw an usual sight on the 
horizon. 
No, it wasn't Elvis incarnate. It was an NCAA bid, which is finally in sight as the Irish finished the eleventh week of their season by winning the Western Michigan Invitational. 
The Irish, now 18-9, improved their chances of earning a spot in the NCAA tournament by defeating Miami <Ohio) Friday night in three games, 15-11, 15­8, 15-4, and winning the cham­pionship match over host West­ern Michigan in four games, 15-13, 4-15, 15-2 and 15-3. 
"I thought it was great," said Irish head coach Art Lambert. "Right now the girls are playing under a lot of pressure because every match is like a must-win situation. But the girls are responding and playing well and I think they can only get better." 
Freshman setter Julie Brem­ner proved she could handle the tournament's pressure, as she was named the invitational's most valuable player after recording 72 assists, 12 digs, 12 total blocks and 11 kills during the team's two matches. 
Seniors Mary Kay Waller and Zanette Bennett also

Holtz passed the offer on to University Executive Vice­President Rev. William E. Beauchamp and Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal, who left the final say with the players. Fiesta Bowl commit­tee member Bill Shover was pleased with the response.

Despite a brief lapse of con­
centration in the second game, 
Notre Dame dropped Western 
Michigan for the second time 
this season Saturday night. 
The Broncos, who had fallen 
to the Irish earlier this season 
in three games 15-8, 15-6, 15-8, 
had advanced to the champion­
ship match by defeating Min­
nesota on Friday. 
Western Michigan could not maintain a consistent offensive attack Saturday though, hitting only .119 for the match, and could not handle the well­balanced Irish attack. 
"We struggled a bit in the second garrie," said Lambert, "but we came back strong in the other games and played very well. We didn't pass very well in the second game and when you don't pass, you can't hit." 
Waller played well on and off the net, as she tallied a team­high 13 kills six total blocks as well as seven digs. 
Senior Maureen Shea also played a well-rounded match, recording 12 kills for a team­high .400 hitting percentage and a match-high 12 digs. 
Bennett contributed to the cause too, finding the seams in the defense for 10 kills and res­ponding well defensively with eight digs. 
The Irish earned a spot in the

The Mountaineers also received their bid Saturday. West Virginia, now 11-0 after beating Syracuse 31-9, is cur­rently ranked fourth in the na­tion.

Waller and Bennett mur­
dered the Miami defense, com­
bining for 27 of the team's 43 
kills and both did so with pre­
cision. 
Waller helped her chances of earning All-American status this year by recording a .500 hitting percentage while Ben-· nett hit .435 for the match. 
Defensively, Waller also gave the Redskins fits, as she registered 13 total blocks for the Irish and repeatedly greeted them with an in­penetrable wall at the net. 
The weekend's victory brings the Irish a step closer to an NCAA bid as the team ap­proaches the final week of reg­ular season play. 
The Irish came into the week ranked 16th--the team's highest ranking ever--and must now prepare to face Texas, who is currently ranked 5th in the na­tion with a 24-5 record, and 13th-ranked San Diego State who is 21-10, in next weekend's Whataburger Invitational. 
"We just keep playing better and better," said Lambert. "There's no ceiling to how well we can play. We know what we we're supposed to do and now it's just a matter of going out and we can do it."

By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
With the bowl bid official and the Notre Dame-West Virginia matchup set, it takes an expert to analyze the teams on their performances and predict how they'll play in the Fiesta Bowl. 
The Nittany Lions, who lost to the Irish Saturday 21-3, also met a similar fate at the hands of the Mountaineers on Oct. 29, 51-30. If anyone is an expert on the Irish and the Mountaineers, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno and his players fit the bill. 
"Notre Dame is a fine foot­ball team," Paterno said Sat­urday after his team's loss. "It's hard to beat a team with that kind of enthusiasm. I wish Notre Dame the best. 
"Notre Dame plays hard, they play alert. The are aggres­sive defensively and skilled of­fensively. They will be tough to beat." 
Paterno gave the credit to the Notre Dame players, not the Notre Dame mystique. 
"They're well-coached, they're organized, they play with a lot of enthusiasm," Paterno said. "It adds color to college football, but it's not a mystique. I didn't see any ghosts making any tackles out there." 
Paterno and most of his players did not want to com­pare the Irish and West Vir­ginia directly. Nittany Lion tailback Gary Brown did have something to say. 
"I give West Virginia the edge on offense," Brown said, "but not by much. I thought we did a better job on defense today, but Notre Dame still got the big plays and scored what they needed. No matter how people try to match them up, though, it's going to be a great game." 
"I will not do that," Paterno ,.... said when asked to compare the Fiesta Bowl opponents. "I don't think that's fair to either team. I think they're both fine lc football teams that have everything--good offense and solid defense, the whole bit. I think it's nice that they're going to play each other." 
"They're both outstanding," said Penn State heroback

Lonergan had several passes broken up and two intercepted by the taller Irish defensive players. 
"The thing about Notre Dame," Lonergan continued, "is that they know how to stop you. We felt good out there today. We thought all we had to do was make one big play and it would put us back in it. 
"But the thing is, Notre Dame doesn't let you back in it. They don't let you get the big plays. We got some shots at West Virginia, but if a team keeps you down like that, they've always got an advan­tage." 
"I see a difference in Notre Dame this year," Johnson said. 
"I've played them for three years. They've always been scrapping, always fighting, they don't give up; it's made them a tough team. This year, they are more confident. That's the difference. They got some big wins early. That can give you confidence, and that can win for you when it gets tough later."

Irish, USC meet 1n 60th playing of 'The Game' Top ranking at stake in battle of unbeatens 
By MARTY STRASEN Sports Editor 
Early Americans traveled west and expanded the nation. 
Over Thanksgiving break, Notre Dame is heading west in an attempt to expand its claim as the nation's top college foot­ball team against arch-rival Southern California. And though the top-ranked Irish will have an easier time getting to Los Angeles than did the fron­tiersmen, Saturday afternoon's battle in the Coliseum is ex­pected to be an historic one. 
They call it "The Game," and this year it is. 
"They're going to be ready for Notre Dame," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz of the second-ranked Trojans after Notre Dame's 21-3 drubbing of Penn State on Saturday. 
USC beat UCLA 31-22 to win the Pac-10 title and secure a spot in the Rose Bowl against Michigan on Jan. 2. Notre Dame will face West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. 
But Saturday's 60th meeting between the Irish and Trojans will decide which of the two teams will control its own fate on bowl day. 
"We're looking forward to playing USC and proving we are the best team in the country," said Notre Dame tailback Mark Green, a native of Riverside, Calif. "Being from Southern California makes this a big deal for me, but we need to win this game for more obvious reasons. It's just great to be in a position where we control our own des­tiny." 
But to control their own des­tiny, the Irish are going to have to control Reisman Trophy hopeful Rodney Peete. The senior quarterback holds numerous game, season and career records at Southern Cal and is dangerous both running and passing the football. 
"He's everything you dread playing against as a defensive player," said Notre Dame in­side linebacker Wes Pritchett. "He's very similar to (Pittsburgh quarterback) Dar­nell Dickerson because he can throw the ball or he can kill you on the ground. 
"It's going to be a great chal­lenge on defense to be able to contain him," Pritchett contin­ued. "He can do a lot of things when he breaks containment." 
Peete completes 63 percent of his passes and averages 240 yards per game through the air. He has thrown for 18 touch­downs and been intercepted only eight times. 
USC's rushing game is similar to Notre Dame's in that a number of backs share the load. Sophomore tailbacks Scott Lockwood and Ricky Er­vins, junior tailback Aaron Emanuel (113 yards and two touchdowns against UCLA) and junior fullback Leroy Holt each have rushed for more than

Associated Press 
PASADENA, Calif.--Rodney Peete, who got measles earlier in the week, passed for 189 yards and one touchdown, leading second-ranked South­ern Cal to a 31-22 victory Sat­urday over No. 6 UCLA, giving the Trojans a berth in the Rose Bowl. 
Peete also scored a touch­down and Aaron Emanuel scored twice as the Pacific-10 
Larry Smith (Coach) 
USC's head coach has guided the Trojans to the Rose Bowl in each of his first two years at the helm. Smith was named Pac-1 0 Coach of the Year for his efforts in 1987. 
Conference champion Trojans, 8-0 in league play and 10-0 over­all, qualified to face Big Ten champion Michigan in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 2. 
But first, Southern Cal plays host to top-ranked Notre Dame next Saturday in a game which could ultimately decide the na­tional championship. 
The sixth-ranked Bruins, who completed their regular season with a 9-2 record and went 6-2 in the Pac-10, meet 
300 yards for the nation's 
seventh-ranked team in total 
offense heading into the victory 
over UCLA. 
Split end and All-America candidate Erik Mfholter and flanker John Jackson are Peete's favorite receivers, ac­counting for more than half of the Trojan receptions. 
The USC defense has been as stingy as any in the nation this year. It held both ASU and Oklahoma to single digits on the scoreboard and, not includ­ing the UCLA game, was ranked in the top 10 nationally in rushing (No. 1), scoring (No. 
5) and total defense (No. 5). 
Inside linebacker Scott Ross is the leading tackler on the team, while safety and Jim Thorpe Award candidate Mark Carrier is second. 
USC's 14-game regular­season winning streak is tops in the nation, but the Irish have come out on top the last five times the teams have met. 
Notre Dame leads the series 32-23-4. 
EXTRA POINTS: The entire Notre Dame team is scheduled for vaccinations against measles and influenza today. 
California health officials say 30 cases of measles, includ­ing that of Peete, have been re­ported on the USC campus. 
"The good news is that coaches over 40 don't need them," Holtz said. "That's why I approved the shots. I hate a needle."

ND gets revenge, victory and a Fiesta Bowl bid 
lnterhall teams battle for supremacy in the muck 
Seniors get first career win over Nittany Lions 21-3 
By MARTY STRASEN 
Sports l<~ditor 
Revenge might be sweet, but nobody said it had to be fair. 
Saturday it wasn't, as top­ranked and Fiesta Bowl bound Notre Dame took out the frustration of three straight losses to strong Penn State teams on a rare weak one. The Irish totaled 502 yards and powered to a 21-3 victory at Notre Dame Stadium in their last home game of the year. 
The win was the first over Penn State for Notre Dame's seniors and sent Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno home with his first losing season (5-6) in 23 years at the helm. 
Notre Dame brings its 10-0 record and No.1 ranking to the Los Angeles Colusium on Sat­urday for The Game--a battle with second-ranked USC 00-0) that will determine the nation's top spot going into the bowl games. The Trojans clinched a Rose Bowl berth by stopping UCLA 31-22. 
"I just feel great for the seniors and the things we've done," said Irish senior tail­back Mark Green, who scored on a 22-yard run in the second quarter. "It's great to go out with a bang and finally beat Penn State. We've never beaten them before." 
The Irish not only beat the Nittany Lions--they nearly blanked them. Penn State scored its only points on Eric Etze's 52-yard field goal on the last play of the first half. The attempt was made possible only after Notre Dame was hit with a 15-yard facemask penalty on the previous seven­yard run by Penn State's Leroy Thompson.

Lewis beats Blitz f to take title 
By VIC LOMBARDI Sports Writer 
"It was a Cinderella story," said Lewis coach Steve Treppicione after his team defeated Breen-Phillips 8-6 for the wo­men's Interhall Football crown in a cold and muddy Notre Dame Stadium yester­day. 
The Lewis victory was preserved after a 25-yard Breen-Phillips field goal at­tempt fell short with 2:20 remaining. 
"We're still stunned," said Lewis cap­tain Christine Wall meyer after her team dove into a puddle of mud in ecstatic celebration. "We came from out of nowhere and won it all." 
Breen-Phillips drove 69 yards and con­sumed 16 minutes of the clock before op­ting to kick the field goal on fourth and five from the nine yard line. 
"It was a coach's decision," said B-P captain Karen Marsh. "She's (Amy 
see LEWIS, page 9 
In fact, Penn State moved the ball more on Notre Dame penalties (eight for 94 yards) than on pass completions (5-of­24 for 74 yards). The Irish defense broke up 10 Lion pass­ing attempts and Jeff Aim and Steve Roddy each snared an in­terception. 
Penn State did not complete a single pass in the second or third quarters. 
"We just didn't have enough offensively," said Paterno, whose team managed 105 yards on 31 rushing attempts and held the ball for only 21 minutes. "Notre Dame played hard, they played alert, and played very aggressive defensively. They've got a good, tough sec­ondary." 
The Irish offense set the tempo for its control of the line of scrimmage in its first series of the game. Notre Dame marched 87 yards on 12 plays and took a 7-0 lead when Rice rolled out to the left, pump­faked to a wide-open Rod West in the end zone to get a Penn State defender off his feet and scored from two yards out. 
The Irish took a 14-0 lead in the second quarter when Green broke through a hole at the line of scrimmage, headed for the right sideline and somehow managed to stay inbounds on his 22-yard score. Freshman split end Raghib Ismail threw a clinching downfield block on the play. 
"I looked up and saw three of their guys go down," Green said. "I saw three of our block­ers on three of their blockers, and it was kind of like the domino effect."

Defense keys 3-0 Dillon victory 
By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
On a field that was nothing short of unplayable, Dillon kicker Kohl Schneider nailed a 27-yard field goal in overtime to bring the Big Red a 3-0 vic­tory, its second consecutive Inter hall championship, over Stanford. 
Both teams, playing in a rematch of last year's final, were forced to change game plans due to the horrid field con­ditions in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"We couldn't run during regulation, so we tried to pass in overtime," said Stan­ford's Steve ,Wightkin. 
After winning the coin toss at the end of regulation, Dillon opted to start on defense, putting the pressure on the Stud offense. Beginning on the ten-yard line, each team had four downs to attempt to score. On Stanford's third attempt at the ten, Dillon intercepted, setting up

Irish will face

Now it's official.

Surprise. 
"This is really a thrill for us," said Phil Motta, president of the Fiesta Bowl team selec­tion committee. "The history of the Fiesta Bowl has probal>ly reached its peak--to have Notre Dame, and to have them unde­feated and ranked No. 1." 
The matchup will occur regardless of the outcome of the Notre Dame-USC game Saturday in Los Angeles. In fact, the Penn State outcome did not matter. The committee wanted the Irish that much. 
The bid was extended to Irish head coach Lou Holtz before Saturday's victory over the Nittany Lions. The Irish got $3 million for accepting the bid, the largest ever offered by the bowl.
