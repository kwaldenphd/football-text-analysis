Byrne appoints ND graduate 

by Mary Fran Callahan Senior StaffReporter 

Chicago Mayor ] ane Byrne on Sunday appointed ] oseph Whelan, a Notre Dame alumnus (Government '76), to the position of her personal appomtment secretary--a job which pays $27,000 annually. 
Byrne, who has been criti­cized by reporters for her nepotistic tendencies following the appointment of her daughter Kathy to a public relations city job in Chicago, also appointed Libby Lamb (SMC '79) and Pat Vidir (SMC '79) to administrative positions earlier this year. The women are friends of her daughter.

NDgrad tips off Aspen drug·dealers 
ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -Tucked up the Roaring Fork Valley 180 miles west of Denver, Aspen has always been a place where you could go tO get away from the rest of the world. 
For quite a while now, state and federal authorities have contended it is also a place where people can escape the drug laws enforced elsewhere in the nation, a place where cocaine and other drugs are 
plentiful.
And tor almost as long, the authorities have obtee to the attitudes of Pitkin County Sher­iff Richard Kienast, a philoso­
pher turned lawman who has refused to cooperate with . ~.~:ndercover narcotics investiga­tions. 
Kienast, a taller version of actor Richard Dreyfuss, holds a master's degree in philosopher 
-and theology from Notre Dame. In his campaign, he used a poster of a dove floating above a quotation from Thoreau: "Let everyman make known what kind of government would com­mand his respect and that will be one. step toward attaining
it. J J 
From that he was tagged "Dick Dove." He is not, he says, a dove on 
drug use -particularly cocaine which he calls "a very danger­ous drug." 
He also says, "Sure, I can be fairly certain that it (cocaine use) is going on in Aspen, but I also don't think there's any way to deal with,!t. Society's doing it not Aspen. 
That is the kind of remark that has enraged some ·state and federal officials and made them determined, the locals say, to make an example of Aspen. 
For six months, a federal grand jury in Denver heard allegations that the sheriff de­liberately tipped drug dealers to an impending federal raid last summer. 
The ~rand jury was believed to be mvestigating the entire sheriffs department and sev­eral other public officials. Last week it indicted a former depu­ty on a felony charge of distributing cocaine. 
FBI Special Agent Cliff Brow­ning said the investigation would be renewed with another grand jury within the month: 
"You don't expect me to give up," Browning said. "That's just the beginning." 
Three years ago, the people who live amid the mountains 

Seniors change Picnic 
by Kelli Flint Senior StaffReporter 
An enforcement of Univers­ity policy has resulted in a rescheduling of the Senior Picnic, according to Nick Schneeman, senior class presi­dent. 
Schneeman had originally planned two senior picnics, one on April 19 and another on May 10. "Approval for the picnics was denied by the administration,'' Schneeman said. ''The administration said that no more picnics with kegs are allowed on University pro­perty. Prior to this deciswn, only the senior class was allowed to have picnics with kegs because these students are over 21." 
Schneeman said that he was disturbed by the decision _on the _(Jicnics because of behavior at picnics held since last fall. ' 'I worked hard to successfully enforce responsible drinking at picnics this year,'' Schneeman said. ''There has been a great improvement over last year's situation. There have been no complaints from the admini­stration, no security problems, and no alcohol abuse problems this year." 
Schneeman said that a picnic will be allowed by the admini­stration on Tuesday, May 13, after fmal examinations are over. ''This picnic would replace the one scheduled to for May 10," Schneeman said. ''I was told that more under­graduates would be able to attend the picnic if it was held on May 10 during exams. As I see it, more undergraduates would be able to attend Tues-­day, after exams are over than on Saturday while they're still being given." 
According to)ames Roemer, Dean of Students; there are no new enforcements on the· keg policy for picnics. "We decid­ed to contmue a precedent ~et in the past by havmg the senwr picnic after the undergraduates have gone home,'' .R~emer said. ''To have the picnic for the seniors over 21 with beer during exams causes problems. Nick wanted to set a 'lew precedent. We asked him tG reschedule the picnic. Fr. Van Wolvlear told me that he 
[continued on page 4] 
surrounding Aspen elected Kienast their sheriff. In Denver, on the other side of the Continental Divide, Chief 
U.S. District Judge Fred Win­ner has been heard 1 to warn drug defendants to tell their friends that ' Aspen is a part of the United States" and subject to its laws. 
Richard Nathan, who heads the state's Organized Crime Strike Force, talks of "some very great philosophical differ­ences between ourselves and those in Pitkin County on what the laws are and how they should be enforced." 
The original allegation invol­ving Kienast stemmed from a news conference July 31, 1979, a week before the federal Drug Enforcement Administration culiminated a seventh-month drug investigation with the arrests of 32 alleged dealers ih Aspen, Basalt, Carbondale and Glenwood Springs. 
Pressed by reporters about whether the DEH was about to make drug arrests in the area, Kienast said the DEH had told him it was not doing any investigation in Pitkin County .. 
The sheriff says he made the statement because of rumors of imminent drug arrests in the area. But federal :ruthorities­claim that Kienast, by saying that there was not going to be a bust, was cleverly tipping off drug dealers that there was. They believe that Deborah Quinn, then deputy district attorney in Aspen, had rold Kienast of the investigation and that he devised a tricky means of spreading the word. 
Ms. Quinn, who was also a subject of the initial grand jury investigation, resigned her job to protest the distnct attorney's decision to use -undercover agents in further drug investi­gations. She has since been elected president of the Pitkin County Bar Association 
Ms. Quinn also prosecuted the county's forest drug case in more than five years last ) uly. With the help of testimony from several local residents, a guard at the exclusive Starwood hous­ing development was convicted of selling drugs to minors. Kienast says that testimony makes the conviction more meaningful than if it had come from evidenced gathered in an undercover operation. 
Such work is unethical, he insists, because "an underco­ver officer is put in the position of breaking the law along with someone else. When it's all over with he steps back and say~ 'I'm going to arrest you for doing this, but not myself.' " 
Wanda Smolinski, Byrne's former appointment secretary, will retam employment under the mayor as her personal secretary. 
Byrne promoted Whelan despite the fact that as former "administrative aide" to the mayor he was a subject of controversy in a scandal con­cerning an interview which occurred in his office, last year_ 
Whelan had been interviewed David Cintron, an unemployed divinity student and during the course of the interview, Whelan noticed that Cintron was carrying a handgun, which is an illegal weapon in the state of Illinois. 
When police questioned Whalen about the incident, he changed his story and said he was not certain that Cintron was carrying a handgun. Whelan's former duties as an administrative aide consisted mainly ofadvising the mayor in the area of health. "He was supposed to advise her on health matters in general," Richard Axelrod said. 
The Alumni Oft:ice, however, confirmed yesterday that Whel_an f;raduated in 1976 with a maJor 10 government. 
Although the press has call­ed Whelan's new position that of "the mayor's appointment secretary," Whelan yesterday defined his new job as one of "coordinating office appear­ances and schedulins." 
When questioned If he view­ed his new job as a challenge in light of his government backround, Whelan answered, "Yes, very much," but declin-.. ed to elaborate further. 
Whelan also actively cam­paigned for Michael Brady, · one of Byrne's top committee­ward men. "There isn't much to do now," Whelan comment­ed, referring to his involve­ment with campaign efforts. 
He did say, however, that he plans to campaign for Ted Kennedy's presidential bid in the fall.

rece1ves fellowship 
by Patty Sheehan 
Dr. Martin H. Dull, associate professor of mathematics at Saint Mary's, recently received a faculty fellowship from the Lilly Endowment in Indianapo­lis. Dull is one of ten recipients chosen for the 1980­1981 academic year. 
The competition, limited to Indiana colleges and univer­sities, was open to able tea­chers in mid-career who pro­posed to diverge from their academic routine to pursue individually-designed pro­grams in the United States or abroad. 
Those selected for the endowment have professional development interests that can­not be adequately served by conventional fellowships. The Lilly endowment is supplemen­tary to Dull's sabbattcal salary at Saint Mary's. 
Dull will use his fellowship to support an academic year as Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. He will read in the area of the history of mathematics and science and audit courses in intellectual history. 
Dull aims to devei.op inter­disciplinary perspectives that will bridge the gap between scientific and non-scientific fields of study. "When I explain to a class the theory of real numbers, I want to be able to relate it to the history and culture of the Greeks, and why they developed the number system, Dull explained. 
When asked if the endow­ment was a surprise, Dull replied, ''After looking over the other proposals of previous recipients, I had a pretty good idea that what I wanted to do was what they (Lilly) were interested in funding. I was more pleased than surprised."

[continued from page 1] 

Rogari said. 
Campus View manager John Wilson declined to esnmate the damage, saying only that it was "nowhere near" the $35,000 estimate listed in the police report. 
The residents of the apartment deny that the fire was caused by 
fireworks.  "There's  just  no  
way,"  one  said.  "We  were  
only using  little  firecrackers,  
not  bottle  rockets,  and  we  
stopped  at  five  o'clock  when  

two girls came over. I can't believe that it smoldered that long.'' 
According to Chief Robe_rt Lindzy of the Clay Towns_htp Fire Department, Campus Vtew has had no other fires since the complex opened in 1974. "This is the first fire that we're aware of," Lindzy said, "other than a small one two years ago that was set in order to cover up a burglary.'' 
Campus View undergoes no regular inspection for fire safe­ty, Lindzy said. "It's a residen­tial area. We are not allowed to inspect unless the residents · request it."

Bookstore action continues as crowds grow larger 
by Btl/Marquard Sports Writer 

Day 4 ... Bookstore Basketball held hostage by the weather... 
But no one seemed to care as crowds began to Jick up for yesterday's secon round ac­tion in the campus basketball classic. 
'' Then·were a lor more people watching the games today," offered Bookstore Commission­er Rob Simari. "The weather really be8an ro clear up for us this evenmg, and the tempera­tures are supposed to be in the 70s by Friday." 
A crowd of over 200 watched t~e defending ~?amp ''Defen­dtng Chumps · dtspose of "Team X" 21-10 on the Book­store courts. Dan Short led "'Chump" scorers with a 7-for­11 shooting performance, while teammates Bill Hanzlik and Tom Sudkamp chipped in five apiece. One of Hanzlik buckets was an unconventional running jumper from just under half court. 
In other tourney highlights, ''AI McGuire and the Aircraft Carriers'' flushed out the "Water and Vinegar Douches" 21-8 on the Lyons courts. The "Carriers" were paced by Mike Boushka's 7-for-11 shooting performance, while sophomore marksman Pete Crowe pum­meled the nets at a 6-for-8 clip. 
''The tournament has been very competitive so far, and we are expecting continued excite­ment in the rest of the games," said Simari. 
Today's top Bookstore offer­ings feature ''Much Later WEB" on Bookstore 9 at 5:30, followed by the ''Butcher Bro­thers'' on the same court at 
6:15. "Strappamasquon and the Combat Wombats" open their Bookstore season on Book­store 10, also at 6:15.

Weather halts drills again 
by Craig Chval Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's spring drills were cancelled by inclement weather for the fourth time in a week Tuesday, as muddy grounds and blustery weather prompted head--coach Dan Devine to call the drills off ... weather permitting, the Irish will work out Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and twice on Saturday ... Devine and his staff still haven't scheduled the team's first scrimmage of the spring, as the coaches have been very pleased so far by what the squad has accom­plished during teamwork ses­sions and other drills. 
One positive note about the miserable weather is that the Irish have yet to suffer a serious injury during their abbreviated drills ... tri-captain Tom Gibbons and tight end

' But then s<.-rnething hap­pened that m<:a 1e him very sail' In a preseas m scrimmage, Vagas was lUIInir g and Pete was blocking and P, ·te fell down and didn't get up. There was pain on his face aor!. he doctors said it was a brokt n ankle. As they carried Pete otf he field, Coach Dan saw all o{ !.is plans for the upcoming st:asor evap­orate into the misry d;w·pness of the cool autumn a ·tern<>'"~n. 
"I knew when I die it that it hurt baJ,'' recalls Pt tl Buchan­an who would proba~ ly like to · forget the whole incidl '1t. "The 1njury was worse than a.·y I'd ever had. I'd broken .1 "imall bone in the leg above IU} left 10kle anJ there was lig.n.~nt 
lamage on both sides of :he 
tnkle." 

BuLhanan was operated on by team surgeon Leslie Bodr.ar and rhe i.1itial l;rognosis was that he W<>uld be able to play again. But it was gonna take alot of time and alot of work. 
"At first I was pretty down, but I never thought that I wouldn't be able to play again." admits the sophomore from nearby Plymouth, Ind. "Theycame up with a rehabili­tation routine and I started it two weeks after rhe operation.'' 
What the routine consisted of 'was a whirlpool to return flexi­bility to the injured ankle. The doctors provided a cutaway cast that Buchanan could slip on and off to take the whirlpool. 
"I did that for about 12 weeks," he remembers, "along with stretching and flexibility exercises to get my strength back. I also did alot of long distance running to build it up and now the ankle is about 90 percent of what it was before the injury." 
But Buchanan isn't satisfied with 90 percent. He's shooting for a full recovery and he is optimistic about his chances. 
"Right now, I'm mostly ob­serving during spring drills," he points our. ''Alot of my time. is spent remembering what I forgot. For instance, every day before practice they put in some new plays and I try and stay on top of that so I can start practicin,g and not be too far behind.' . 
Presently he is being held out of contact drills and team work and is pracucmg in sweats. He prob.1bly will not be ready for pads and contact until fall workouts begin in August. 
''I'm going in for another examination next week,'' he reveals. "If everything is all right I might put on the pads and start a little indivtdual drills. But I doubt if they will let me scrimmage until the fall." 
And then Buchanan will set about the task of winning back the starting fullback spot that was his before the injury. That, he believes, will be the tough­est recovery of all. 
''I'II have to come back and prove myself all over again,'' he says. "That won't be easy because we have some very talented people at that position. But I'm gonna try and I think I can come back to full strength.' 
Once upon a' (;die: about one year later as a matter of act, ~oach Dan was again looking at his roster and scratching his head. Vagas the runner was gone and that was gonna hurt. But then he smiled because Pete rhe blocker was back ... 
And that was onna help. 

Tennis team extends streak 
by Michael Ortman Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame tennis team ran its winning streak to ten straight yesterday afternoon with a 7 · 2 drilling of visiting Purdue in the final tuneup for this afternoon's showdown with 3ig Ten powerhouse Indiana. 
"I'm always happy with a win," said Irish coach Tom Fallon, "but we had a lor of bad shot:'> today. I hope-I thihk we got them all out of ou.r srstem. J' m just glad we dtdn t play Indiana, today." 
Altho.1gh the rains (and snow and sleet and... ) had stopped prior to the 3 o'clock st3:r~ing rime, rhe blustery condltlons forced the match into the ACC. It was the ninth indoor contest for the Irish in 13 outings this season. 
Wins at tmmber one and number two doubles got the Irish _off to a fast start, as they took a 2-1 lead into the singles competitions. The number three duo of Jim Falvey and Tim Noonan lost a tough three­setter to Purdue's Matt Friedman and Phil Dull. After splitting the first two sets, Falvey and Noonan battled back from a 0-3 defecit to tie the score at six, o,nly to fall short in the tie-breaker, 5-3. 
In singles, senior captain Carlton Harris and freshman Mark McMahon swapped posi­tions and played one and two respectively for the first time this season. The switch didn't appear to affect their play (howev~r) as each coasted to straight set victories. 
''Carlton has beu1 playing extremely well lately,'' ex­plained Fallon. "I just thought he deserved the chance to play number one. McMahon has been playing very well too, but

Dame's record book en route to a second-place position on 
the Irish career scoring list. 

Matvey set school standards for scoring average (17 .6 ppg), 
points in one season (529), rebounding average (10.2), 
rebounds in a season (305), field goal percentage (. 582), field 
goals made (237) and field goals attempted (407). She also

MOOSE AWARDS -Congratulations to Athletic Director 
Edward "Moose" Krause on being honored last night as 
"Man of the Year" by the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph 
V1.lley. It seems that most of .the club's membership 
assumed that Krause had been a past recipient of the award, 
but when their current president noticed that Krause's name 
was absent from the hst of past honorees, he offered the 
appropriate accolades. 

The same club is sponsoring their annual Rockne Memorial Mass and Breakfast this Sunday, April 20. The featured speaker will be Jim Crowley, the last living member of Notre Dame's famed "Four Horsemen." Other guests will be Krause and football captains Bob Crable, Tom Gibbons and John Scully. The cost of the affair, which starts with Mass 
8:30 followed by breakfast in the South Dining Hall at 9:30, is $3 per person, and reservations may be made by calling 232-7946 during the day or 234-8279 in the evening. 
MAT TALK -The search for a new Irish wrestling coach is still in progress. Physical Education Department Chairman Dennis Stark is still reviewing applications for the position vacated last month by Ray Sepeta. It is expected that the­new coach will also serve as physical education instructor ... The w.omen's tennis coaching space will also be open next year smce J ory Segal will not be returning either. 
HEADS UP -Sophomores John Iglar and Fred Kitziger were ~hosen to captain the Irish wrestlers next year. Retinng captam Dave Disabato, who owns a 
Notre Dame record 104 victories among numerous other records, was honored as the most Outstanding Wrestler at the team's annual banquet... 
Freshman Susan Valdiserri was chosen to Captain Mike DeCicco's women's fencing team during their 1980-81 campaign .. .Johm Komora and Dave Campbell will serve as co.captains for Notre Dame's 1980-81 swimming season. Komora, a three-time Most Valuable Swimmer, was the captain of this year's squad. 
Title X -"The Doctor and their Nurses," one of the 384 Bookstore teams this year, has already won two games with a two-women, three-man roster in the otherwise-male tourney. Missy Conboy and Maggie Lally, veterans of the women's varsity basketball team, have helped the "Doctors and Nurses" to the quarterfinals of their sectional. It is too bad, but surely one of the alphabet organizations (HEW, NCAA or AlA W) could find a way to tax, regulate or outlaw such an innocent arrangement.
