"Question of effectiveness" 
Hesburgh explains referendum delay 
by Dave McCarthy 
ln a news conference held yesterday Father Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame, told newsmen why, when 21 colleges and universities {including MIT, Cornell, Vassar, Holy Cross, and Duke) have decided to suspend classes from four days to two weeks to allow student political campaigning, Notre Dame had postponed a referendum on the suspension until October 2nd. 
"Tbe whole question of effec­tiveness carne out," he said. "The reason we put it in Oct­ober instead of having it right away (May, 1970 at the time of the Kent-Cambodia crisis) was becuase a lot of things happen 
Vol. V, No.8 
over the summer, the political situation changes." He added that it was a time to test the candidates' reactions to whether or not they wanted student help. "That turned out to be pretty much of a mixed bag," Hesburgh said. 
When asked whether he fa­vored the suspension of classes Fr. Hesburgh replied, "I'd be inclined to take a long, long look at it; and I wouldn't say I'd be personally in favor;" but he add­ed, "Being for or against the idea is not the same as being for or against political activity .. .1 'rn very much in favor of the vote for 18 year olds and political involvement by students." 
He summed his feelings when he said, "I don't know how our referendum is going to come out. All 1 can say is that the feeling across the country is less enthusiastic than it was." 

When asked if he though fail­ure to suspend classes would result in campus unrest Fr. Hes­burgh said, "No. This is not a crucial point." 
He was asked what specifical­ly was being done at Notre Dame to quell campus disorder, and he answered, "Here you get some kind of consensus on what kind of place you want...And I think it's pretty loud and clear around here that people don't want violence, they don't want burning, they don't want peoples' rights trod on." 
Hesburgh's opinion reg;uding student unrest was sought. He said, "I think the current situa­tion is fairly bad for Universities generally. I think the net of much that has happened is that the general public is somewhat down on Universities; at least that is the reaction I get when I try to raise money for the Uni­verstiy. The general feeling is that things have gone to far, gotten out of hand." 
He also remarked about the image of the student saying, "The student has gotten an image that is untrue and very bad; but it's been ground into people ... and the whole reputa­tion of students, faculty, and administration has gone down." 
He denied extending security measures after terrorism at the University of Wisconsin, in 
which one man was killed. H. prescribed "nothing preventive

Mafraq.  
Official  Amman  radio  said  

that by dusk, only scattered pockets of guerrilla resistance remained in the city. Both army and guerrilla announcements in­dicated there were many cas­ualities. 
The heavy fighting caused concern for the safety of 54 airline hijack hostages still held by the guerrillas, reportedly in scattered hideouts in Amman. President Nixon warned the guerrillas they would be held responsible for the safety of the hostages, most of the Americans, and the State Department de­clined to rule out the possibility of U.S. military intervention if necessary. 
Official Amman radio, which played martial music and broad­cast government announcements throughout the day, warned against outside interference in Jordan's "purely internal prob­lem." 
Iraq has 12,000 to 15,000 army troops based in Jordan, and both Iraq and Syria have sided with the guerrillas in their opposition to Jordan's King Hussein and the military govern­ment he installed Wednesday. 
Neither government respond­ed to the Palestinian appeal, but Syrian foreign ministry officials summoned the Jordanian ambas­sador in Damascus and told him "Syria will not stand idly by in the face of the massacres." 
In Tel Aviv, Israeli foreign ministry sources said Israel had no intention of intervening un-' less its own security was thrf;at­ened by the fighting. · 
"The army has taken all sec­tors of Amman except for some pockets of resistance whic~1 it is not clearing," Amman radio said at dusk, about 13 hours after the fighting erupted  in the capital and four towns in the north. The broadcast named 16 sections of Amman as being under army control. 
The Jordanian government, responding to an a.ppeal from the Arab League meeting in Cairo, offered the guerrillas a cease fire if they would agree to withdraw from the cities and leave the army in control of the urban areas. It offered to trans­port the guerrillas to points a­long Jordan's border with Israel. 
There was no response from the Palestinian Central Commit­tee, under which at least 11 guerrilla organizations were fighting. 
The guerrillas appeared to get the worst of it almost from the outset of the fighting, which began with several exchanges of small arms fire south of Amman at dawn. It spread quicklv when 
NSA meets nationally 
by Hilary Rhonan 
In August of this year the National Student Association (NSA) met in St. Paul, Minne­sota to discuss the various prob­lems which confront the student as an individual and as a citizen. Marilyn Mohrman, a junior at St. Mary's attended the l 0-day con­ference. 
NSA is composed of some 400 college and university stu­dent governments, and serves as a ·coordinator of information as well as an outlet for opinions and facts. 
Miss Mohrman said that al­though she had mixed feelings about the conference as a whole, she was very impressed by the intensity of the discussions and lectures. Some of the ideas which were discussed were the ' crisis in the universities, educa­tional reforms and American for­eign policy. Miss' Mohrman said that she believed that the stu­dents at the conference may not have accurately represented their student bodies but said that on the whole did not want to merely talk about the problems, but wanted to do something to came from Sr. Alma Peters, act­ing President of St. Mary's Col­lege. The reason behind such a meeting according to Sr. Alma is that "students tend to get pulled in two directions. The political recess is a good example. If one council votes to suspend classes and the other doesn't, then the one who suffers is the student." 

On the recess Sister stated, "I'm not in favor of it. I believe in student involvement, but it shouldn't take priority over the main purpose of college which is academic." 
As for the possibility of a merger of the two councils, Sr. Alma stated that there were "too many things that the indi­vidual councils must act in­dependently of one another."

perhaps alleviate the tensions 
which these problems produce. 
Miss Mohrman explained that 
some individuals were frustrated by the idea that perhaps what was being done by NSA would be ignored by those in power; some believed that the Congress in Washington would not take the resolutions which were being passed seriously enough and ·would tend to treat the whole 
matter as unimportant. 
Miss Mohrman feels that the 
value of NSA for St. Mary's lies 
not in the issues which were 
passed but in the other services 
which are connected with NSA.

by Ann Conway The Academic Affairs Coun­cils of St. Mary's College and Notre Dame have agreed to meet jointly September 27 at 3:00 
p.m. This marks the first such meeting of the two councils to discuss issues which concern both campuses. 
The initiative for this meeting Jordanian army artillery units began shelling Palestinian areas of the city and tanks and armor­ed cars rolled into its streets, The guerrillas fought back with machine guns and bazookas. 
Heavy fighting also was re- ported in the cities of Zerqa, 13 miles northeast of Amman; in Salt, 22 miles to the northwest, and in Ramtha, 45 miles north­east of the capital, and the guer­rillas announced they had taken control of Irbid, 45 miles north of Amman. 
But there was almost a con­stant note of anxiety in an­nouncements and orders the Central Committee broadcast to the guerrillas on Damascus radio from Syria.

=====================================================================================:=====::;:;::=======:=========:=====:===========:=======:===:==========================:=:=:=:= Glen Corso 
The racial question surfaced on Long 
Island this summer, through the guise of 
low cost housing for welfare recipients. It 
seems that the low cost housing shortage 
in Nassau county was so critical that 
county social service agency was forced 
to house people in motel rooms. 
A sub-crisis situation was reached how­
ever when the agency reported that by 
December there would be no motel 
rooms available. A proposal was put forth 
to renovate several buildings at-Mitchell 
Field, an abandoned Air Force complex, 
and house the welfare recipients there. 
Residents from the adjoining 
community of Uniondale appeared at the 
County Board meeting, where the matter 
was to be resolved, and protested the plan 
most vehmently. The arguements ranged 
from beliefs that the school system would 
be overloaded with the children of the 
welfare recipients, to fears that the 
housing complex would become ghetto. 
Glib spokesmen presented the arguements 
but one could hear comments from the 
rest of the people saying the recipients 
were "stupid and lazy", or how they 
refused to "get off their asses and get a 
job" or that they were "lousy incom­
petent workers." 
Listening to these people, who ob­viously believed the rightness of their comments, brought to mind a story told me by a black with whom I work. At the time he was explaining to me why he felt there was such a gap between the white middle class and the blacks. He said he didn't pretend to talk for anyone but himself, but had found that whites never bothered to think about why blacks are so poor. 
"The best way to show something like that is to use a graphic illustration, something that white people can relate to," he said. The story I use sometimes has two characters in it, Joe White and Joe Black. It's kind of simple, maybe a little bit childish, but it gets the point across." 
"Now take Joe White. He's 47 years old, he's got a college education. He's married, with two kids, lives in an exclu­sive suburb and owns his own electornics firm. He is not wealthy, but he makes out pretty good. His background isn't a hell of a lot different than most folks in this country. Joe's parents came over from the old country just before the first World War broke out. They scrimped and saved to buy two steerage class tickets to America. When they got over here they couldn't speak English and since both had lived on farms they found it tougl1 finding a job. Joe's father had some conststruction experience though and found a job laying bricks. Joe's mother meanwhile worked in a knitting mill. Things were tough, and there were times no money was in the house. 
By the time Joe was I 0 they had managed to move out of the ratty tenament to a better apartment. Joe was a pretty sharp in school and got good marks. He was thinking about college, but World War II came along. After the war, with the help of the GI bili Joe went to a decent college and graduated in near the top of his class. He went to work for a small electronics manufacturer. He moved up quickly and saved every penny he could so he would be able to buy his own business. He made some smart investments in the market and in the early 60's had enough to but a business. 

Most of the jobs in the electronics firm are unskilled and Joe has a lot of blacks working for him. Most of them are poor workers. They're absent frequently, they drink a lot, they're in constant trouble with the law and a lot of times they don't pay their debts. Joe can't understand this. After all he's "giving" them a job. These guys, he claims, don't want to start out at the bottom and work their way up like everyone else, they want it all right now. Joe has a pretty low opinion of blacks and he hates politicians who take their side. 
"Let's take a look at Joe Black, one of the guys who works in the electronics company. His background is similar to Joe White's. His folks came to the northern city from the old country, only in their case the 'old country' was Alabama. This Joe's father also had a tough time finding a job. Only his trouble lasted all his life. Whenever Joe's father tried to get a job in construction, or with a company that payed well, he was always told the job was filled. One day he got so desperate he pleaded with the foreman to give him a job. The fellow told him that he wasn't allowed to hire coloreds. He told Joe's father that he should look for a porter's job, cause that's all he would ever get. 
A few weeks later Joe's father start­
ed drinking. The schools Joe went to weren't so good. The teachers didn't know much more than the pupils. Joe got bored and quit. His father had disappeared by then and his mother was busy caring for seven other kids, so nobody was around to talk to Joe. The wa1 came and Joe was drafted. He was put in a labor battalion for the duration. After the war Joe finished high school. He went to a trade school and learned the electricians trade. When he got out he tried to join the electricians union, since he couldn't get a job unless he was a member. The man at the union kept putting Joe off and finally told him that he would lose his job if he let him in the union. Joe got a job as a porter. 
A few years ago he got the job in the electronics plant. By that time Joe had started drinking. When he tried to join the union again he was turned down with some vague excuse and told his schooling was useless."

cannot be assured of being accorded at least a courteous reception 
everywhere he goes. 
There are alot of people who hate President Nixon. The President 
has traditionally been exposed to threats of physical violence and 
the insane actions of maladjusted individuals who vented their 
frustrations on the Office of the President. It didn't make any 
difference who the President was, it just mattered that there was a 
President. Periodically one of those maladjusted individuals would 
go out with the intention of killing the man. 
It is different today. There are alot of people who just hate President Nixon. Of course, there were always people who disliked individual Presidents. But there has never been a time in American society when so many people, especially young people, have been so violent toward the person of the man. Many young people have no respect for the man himself and there is open and wide-;<;pread depiction of the President in posters with obsene and derrogatory captions in college dormitories. It wouldn't be very hard to find a person who would talk seriously of the need for the President's death. 
The state of affairs is sad. The President can not speak at any American College or University unless it is "conservative" or "quaint." There were a few hecklers at Kansas State. They made delivering his actress less than comfortable, but with the majority of the 16,000 listeners willing to afford him common courtesy, he delivered his address. 
Kansas State is acknowledged to be a fairly conservative school. 
At least, that's what most journalists assume from the mere fact that 
it is situated in the Midwest. Let the President try to speak at any of 
the more "liberal" schools, the Eastern schools with "academic" 
reputatiOns, and the hecklmg would no doubt increase. Probably to 
the point where he wouldn't be able to continue to speak. 
The situation does not say much for the average American scholar. A true scholar would treasure freedom of speech, defending it against threats from outside the community as well as from within. He would understand that the only hope for 20th century civilizations torn by war and the ravages of their own waste lies in the firm adherence to some basic set of human values-a set of values which elevates man above all his shortcomings. Not the least of those values is common courtesy. Another is respect for every man's right to hold an opinion differing from others. But do most college students feel outraged at the fact that the men who lead this country can not come to universities to speak about and to be questioned about their actions? It seems not. 
Amazingly there are none on this campus who will say that the heckling of the President was justified. The President's rhetoric is intlamatory or his policies are ridiculous they say. But since when ha~ it been accepted practice in a truly academic community to refuse a speaker common courtesy for lack of agreement with what he has to say? 
American institutions of higher learning are gradually losing their most conveted possession; an atmosphere where free inquiry can take place. In the name of academic freedom, they have tolerated actions by members of the community which have made them more closed, then open institutions. In a time when student power is the demand it must be that power which is used to assure that the scholarly community will survive. Individuals who subscribe to any political philosophy must be free to speak on campuses. 
If the trend toward heckling speakers who are controversal is not changed, continued credence will be given to the arguments of those who typify students as closed-minded, crude, and anti-intellectual. 
And more regrettably, there will be little hope that this generation's actions and judgement of events will hold much weight with future generations who no doubt will look to see whether the principles we express to hold really meant anything to us.

BOY, -DOES NOTRE DAME 
EVER HUM 
M~.,~~ '""~t-================­
First Commuraion 

========= l'} Ft. R('l'n1 Ct·iffin 
One Sunday this summer, because as priest I felt lonely and isolated while offering a Sunday Mass in the vast, empty sanctuary of Sacred Heart Church, I invited the moppets and urchins of the congregation to join me at the altar for the Canon. 
Among the children who trooped up to the altar that morning was a dear, young thing named Eileen. She was as fair a child as her lyrically Irish name suggests she should be. She was so pretty, in fact, that a first-grade boy nearly busted a second-grade boy in the nose over who should stand next to the seven-year-old beauty to give her the sign of peace. 
At communion time, as I had said l would, I gave hosts to all the young Christians, and the fair Eileen twinkle-toed her way back to the pew to kneel down beside her mother, who was by now a distraught woman. There had been a mixup, you see: Eileen shouldn't have been given the host; she had never made her First Communion; in fact she didn't have any clear idea what Communion was alll about except that it was "a gift from God." 
Sad to relate, the host did not behave at all well for a gift from God; it got stuck in her throat, somewhere 
between the tonsil and the windpipe. One might have hoped that the living presence of Christ would be experienced as something more comfortable than as a damp, sticky paste for a little child to choke upon. 
Afterwards, speaking to her mother, Eileen announced her rejection of the entire Sacrament called Blessed: "It was awful, and I don't ever want to do it again." 
The priest was horrified to learn the news of the instant apostasy of the moppet-child whom he had nourished on the Saviour's glory. Within a few hours, he had half the nuns in Summer School praying that the fair Eileen would give the sacramental system another chance. 
The next day, he sat down with the child to talk of the mystery of love and redemption and God-with-us, and of the immensity of the Trinity tucked into a snowflake of wheat, and afterwards the child said she understood. Seemingly, for the child, there was no mystery left. 
Then they visited the Keenan-Stanford chapel, where they played a note or two on the organ, identified the Man on the Cross, and peeked into the tabemacle to wonder at the pallor and fragility of the l\.eal Presence of the Lord. 


·)nee again, I offered a fragment of wafer (unconsecrated) to the child, and once again -oh, grief! despair! -the morsel, infamous im its accidents, refused to behave; and the child, despairing of bread so resistant to swallowing, broke into tears. 
She was comforted only by the news that for her next Communion -for her first big Communion that would be marked down by the Church in a great book where people could read about it forever -we would send out to a baker for bread whose only ambition in life was to be allowed to be swallowed as God's gift by little girls like Eileen. And if bread refused to do the trick, I declared, we would tum to wine, and immediately poured muscatel into a cup where the light danced joyously upon it. Eileen tasted the wine, and she nearly danced too, because she now knew that Jesus could come in Communion, tasting like grapes that have laid in warm fields for long afternoons, ripening in the sun. 
I thought of Eileen today, because on Sunday morning she is coming to Mass in the Keenan-Stanford chapel at eleven o'clock as we resume the Family Mass begun in July for the children of the Notre Dame: limily. Hopefully, other children will be there, too -the urchins and moppets of students, faculty and staff. I am anxious that they should be there, for with children standing about the altar, I as priest can never feel isolated and lonely while offering a Sunday Mass.

Vilgot Sjoman's complete and uncut I Am Curious (Yellow) is a "remarkable film (which) has been playing for a long time to droves of Swedes, and to several million people almost everywhere. It is the story of a young girl who is, or was, curious about politics, nonviolence, Zen, commitment, socialism, other Swedes and, to be sure, sex. It is a serious film with a noble theme, and, in dramatic terms, it is original," says Look magazine. The Evergreen Film presented by Grove Press stars Lena Nyman. A Sandrews Production.

When asked whether the placement of Fr. James Bur­tchaell in position of Provost was done to "groom" him to succeed him as president, Father Hesburgh replied, "I don't think you can honestly put it in those terms...I would say that what we're trying to do is get a lot of new ideas and new people in top administrative posts...Who be­comes the next president around here is simply a matter of a de<; is ion of the Board of Trustees...they make all the presidential, vice presidential ap­pointments."

lightened his work load and re­sponsibilities saying, "I'd say they have been. Because there are a lot of things that used to jump from individual vice presi­dents or even deans, bang, up to my office. Now they normally go thru the Provost's office." 
To a question directed at him as head of the Civil Rights Com­mission which asked whether he thought the country was going more or less divided regarding priorities, Fr. Hesburgh said, "There are some areas where we're making progress, other areas where we're going back­wards." He cited that with pro­gress comes polarization, which he remarked, "is as bad. as I've seen in the past ten or fifteen years." 
"A lot of people are very liberal until their kids have to go to school with other kids of another social class or race, and suddenly they become illiberal because they talk a good game but they don't live a good game." 
When asked to comment a­bout change in the country he said, "A minority wants change." He termed it a creative majority and reminded those present that only a minority wanted to break away from Great Britain prior to the Revo­lution. 
"You rarely get leadership from the majority, but you sure have to some 'followership' from the majority." 
Regarding the leadership of the majority by the minority he said, "Part of the challenge of leadership in our day is to find out what change makes sense." 

Filibuster allowed 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Senate struck a hard and maybe fatal blow Thursday to a con­stitutional amendment to make everybody's vote for president count the same. 
Although the action came on a procedural question-to kill a filibuster-it definitely weakened if it did not altogether work chances for electoral reform in time for the 1972 elections. 
With a two thirds majority required to stop a Southern-led filibuster against the amendm­ent, proponents of reform could muster only 54 votes to cut off debate against 36 votes to con­
tinue it-six votes short.

Most opponents of the amendment say it would give excessive electoral powers to a few of the most populous states and negate the influence of the small states. 
Sens. Birch Bayh, D Ind., and Howard H. Baker, R Tenn., chief sponsors of the amendment, immediately vowed to carry on the fight.
His hope lay in one of two courses: persuading the Southern bloc, aided by some small state Republicans, to let' the issue come to a vote on its merits after further debate; or to switch some of the senators who refused to force a halt in the debate through cloture. 
The 36 senators voting against cloture included 18 Republicans and 18 Democrats.

Page 8 TilE OBSER.fJER. 
Irish must stop Daigneu, Pearson 
by Terry Shields Observer Sports Editor It's the Wildcats and the Irish tomorrow afternoon and that says quite a lot. Notre Dame holds a commanding 27-7-2 record in this ancient series that dates as far back as 1889. Don't let that record make you think that there hasn't been some real ding-dong battles between the two Midwestern schools, how­ever. There is no reason to believe that this season's product should be any different in results. The Wildcats have some explosive credentials to put points on the board and since this is the first game of the season, ND won't have that tremendous press build up to frighten the opposition. The game appears to boil down to a matter of whose defense is the stronger. North­western's offense is potent. They 
rely a great deal on the running of Mike Adamle and A1 Robin­son. Both have good speed but there size is questionable. Both weigh in at about 190 lbs. They have a veteran offensive line to make holes for them but they will be going against a defense famed for its stinginess on the ground. 
It may be a blessing in dis­guise if the Wildcats are forced to pass. Quarterback Maurie Daigneau (DANE-yoo) has a sure throwing arm and his receivers are potential standouts. Jerry Brown is a split end with great speed and fine moves who has been showing brilliantly in the fall scrimmages. 
The real superstar on the team may be a junior flankerback named Barry Pearson. Pearson is fast and he is also lightening quick. Besides receiving passes he doubles as a punt return man. Clarence Ellis will line up on 


Maurie Daigneau (sounds like DANE-you) is the prime mover of Northwestern's new option offense. If the Irish can stop him they will halt the Wildcat offense.

which ever side of the field that 
Pearson splits. This should tell 
th1~ tale of what kind of ball­
player Pearson really is. 
The Notre Dame defense must 

shut off Daigneau and North­
western's newly installed option 
offense if the Irish want to avoid 
an early season upset. The men 
that will probably take this re­
sponsibility are Walt Patulski 
and Bob Neidert at the ends 
(possibly the best tandem in the 
country) and tackles Greg Marx 
and Mike Zikas. Marx is a sopho­
more who bears watching. 
The lindbackers have been im­

pressive. There are five who will 
see plenty of action. Tim Kelly 
(captain of the defense), Jim 
Wright, Eric Patton, John Rat­
terman and Rich Thomann. All 
of these men have experience 
and even more important they 
are all MEAN. 
The secondary is headed by 

All-America candidate Ellis and 
Ralph Stepaniak, a steady starter 
from last season. Mike Crotty 
will probably get the nod to 
start at safety. Crotty is only 
5'9" but he is quick and a hard 
hitter. 
Northwestern's secondary is 

experienced and, with what they 
must face, they'll need all of the 
savvy they can muster. Eric 
Hutchinson and Rick Tleander 
were two of the Big Ten's better 
defensive backs last season and 
they will try to stop the passing 
of Reisman Trophy Candidate 
Joe Theismann. Jack Dustin and 
Mike Coughlin will also be deep 
to halt the South River Road­
runner's bombs. 
The Wildcat defensive line 

boasts two proven terminals but 
little else. Wil Hemby and Mike 
Morkin will try to cover for 
mistakes made by the new inter­
ior lineman. 
The Irish offense is a potential powder keg. A Theismann to Tom Gatewood completion was no uncommon sight throughout the spring and fall scrimmages and its a difficult thing to stop. Last year in the regular season this combo clicked 47 times. ND fans should expect more of the same this time around. 
The offensive backs are neither overwhelmingly fast nor big but they do get the job done. Senior Denny Allan was a depen­dable four yard per carry man last year and he may well im­prove on that this season. Bill Barz is a great man to have for short yardage situations. He rare­ly fails to get the necessary yardage. The other halfback will be Ed Gulyas. Gulyas saw a little playing time last year as a defen­sive back and return specialist. In the spring he impressed enough to be given a shot at the starting offensive position. 
Besides Gatewood, the line will feature Mike Creaney, a sophomore tight end who has fought hard to gain this position and there is little evidence that he will give it up. 
The rest of the offensive line has been a worry for head coach Ara Parseghian. Larry DiNardo 
lnterhall Tennis 
The lnterhall Office has an­nounced that they will sponsor a single elimination doubles tour­nament this Fall. There will be two divisions -novice and open. Novice is limited to those with no competitive experience. 
Deadline for entries is S~::pt. 

22. To enter sign up at the Jnterhall Office (C-4) or Inter­hall Issue Room at the ACC. 
and Gary Kos give the Irish two of the finest guards in the country buy everywhere else is a question mark. Dan Novakov started at tackle in the Cotton Bowl and he preformed credit­ably. He should duplicate that performance at his new position, center. 
Mike Martin has been plagued by injuries since he came to ND but the big man from Oregon has rebounded well enough to get a starting berth at one tackle. The other tackle is John Dam­peer, a soph from Kermit, Texas. He won the Hering award for the most improved offecsive player in the spring so he should be an asset to N D in the opener. 
The key to the game should ride with thedefense's ability to halt Daigneau and company. ND has the boys to put points on the board. Look for the defense to come through. NU may stay with the Irish for a half but the results will be similar to last year. Ara will give his old pal Alex Agase another lesson.

This weekend nearly every major college team gets into act_ion and there appears to be a lot of interesting match-u~s. The _only big name missing from the slate is pre-season favonte Oh10 ~tate. The Buckeyes open next weekend against the Texas A&M Agg1es. 
The results should look something like this: 
Notre Dame over Northwestern: The Irish won't 'be caught looking ahead to Purdue. They have a lot of respect for the Wildcats but they also have confidence in themselves. 
Southern California over Nebraska: This is probably the top game of the week but in Los Angeles you have to go with SC. The Huskers will make a game of it but the Trojans have played in too many big games to choke up. 
I Georgia Tech over Aorida St.: After pullin~ off an up~et last week the Yellow Jackets are ready' to make believers of Its Southern opponents. . Texas over California: The Longhorns first attempt at defendmg their National Championship should be a successful one. Houston over Syracuse: The Cougars make their first attempt at setting even more offensive records. They shouldn't score a hundred points but they should get enough to win comfortably. Tennessee over Southern Methodist: This shouldn't be the Vols strongest team of late but they'll be strong enough to take care of Chuck Hixson and Co. LSU over Texas A&M: The Aggies hold the unique distinction of never having lost a ball game in collegiate competition. They have been out-scored on numerous occasions, how~er, and thi.< I'i one of those occasions. Missouri over Minnesota: Mizzou has another fine ball club and they should have just enough to get by the impr~ved Go~ hers Kansas State over Kentucky: Professor D1ckey Will hold his second lecture of the semester on the Purple Pride. UPSET OF THE WEEK ' Pittsburgh over UCLA: Laugh, scoff, and call me names if you might, but the Panthers have an honest to goodr.ess, re~ f~otb~ team this season and they will surprise the weakened Brums m P1tt Stadium.
