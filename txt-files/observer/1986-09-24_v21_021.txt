Israel divebombs targets in Lebanon after border move 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -Israeli jets divebombed Palestinian guerrilla bases in the hills east of Beirut yesterday, setting at least four targets ablaze, pollee said. 
The raid came one day after Israel massed troops along the border with Lebanon in an ap­parent warning to Shiite Moslem guerrillas to cease their attacks In south Lebanon, near Israel. The border situation was quiet yesterday. 
Syrian President Hafez Assad was quoted as threatening a "stunning retaliation" if Israel in­vades Lebanon. 
Police said huge clouds of smoke billowed from the bluffs of Bayssour, Keyfoun, Eitat and Shimlan, 12 miles east of Beirut, after strikes that began at 5:30 
p.m. It was the lOth Israeli air raid in Lebanon this year. 
Israel's military command in Tel Aviv said all planes returned safely and reported hitting bases used for attacks on Israel by the Abu Moussa guerrilla faction and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
The Abu Moussa Fatah­Uprlsing, which broke away from PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah, said In a communique in Beirut that its bases east and southeast of Beirut sustained considerable damage In the air raid. 
The Abu Moussa group said no Palestinians were killed or in­jured. Police said two militiamen from Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, which controls Lebanon's central mountains, were wounded. 
The party is allied with Pales­tinian guerrilla groups backed by Syria. 
The Israeli planes made at least four bombing runs in 40 minutes, with eight jets taking part In each sortie, police said. The pilots released red balloons that distracted the guerrillas' shoulder-fired, heat-seeking SA­7 missiles. 
Beirut International Airport was closed for 30 minutes during the attacks, with one commercial flight diverted to Cyprus and four other flights delayed, aviation of­ficials said. 
But tension lessened yester­day at the Israel-Lebanon bor­der. Israeli troop and tank rein­forcements rushed there Monday, poised for a thrust Into south Lebanon to put down a surge of guerrilla attacks by Iranian-backed Shiite extremists. 
The threat raised fears ofa new military collision between U.S.­
supplied Israel and Sovlet­equippped Syria on Lebanese soil for the seond time in four years. 
"If It (fsrael) attempts a new invasion, the retaliation will be stunning. It will be a surprise to all," Assad was quoted as saying by the leftist Beirut newspaper AI-Hakika. 
It said Assad's remarks were made Monday In Damascus, the Syrian capital, during a meeting with Lebanese politicians. 
Israel humiliated Syria In a 1982 invasion of Lebanon that drove Syrian troops and Pales­tine Liberation Organization guerrillas from Beirut.

In Brief 
Lights will be installed sometime next week to complete the Notre Dame War Memorial fountain, according to Don Dedrick. director of physical plant at Notre Dame. Dedrick also noted that the water jets have been adjusted to spray inward so as not to .drench students sitting on the fountain's marble base. He added, however, that some mist is inevitable on windy days. 
As the school year begins, there is mixed news for the I 986-87 crop of college graduates. The Job Opportunity In­dex (JOI), published in the September issue of Business Week careers magazine, pre~licts a 2 percent rise in total job offers. But no increase is expected in starting salaries. Accounting and business majors have the best prospects, with a predic­tion of a 3.5 percent rise in job opportunities. Liberal arts graduates should also fare. better than last year, with retailing and food service as prime markets. The outlook for engi­neering graduates is spotty. Offers will be plentiful for those in computer science, electronics and avionics. But few offers are anticipated for petroleum and mining engineers. Man­agement and administration graduates also face some hurdles, as cost-conscious companies are hiring less trainees. -The Observer

Relative's death provokes reflections on faith 

My great uncle Bobby died last February while my parents were on campus for Junior Parents' Weekend. 
My dad went down to the Grotto to light a candle for Great Uncle Bobby. He was his father's brother. My mom went along, too, because she wanted to see the Grotto. My mother Is not catholic. She 
goes to Mass only when my father's catholic sense 
of ritual requires It: marriage, baptism, first com­munions and the like. She waited patiently on the side while my father pushed open the wrought­iron gate and entered the Grotto, scowling in con­centration at the Instructions about how to light a candle for the dead. 
In the Grotto there are iron plaques embedded in the walls, plaques that say things like "In Thanksgiving For Favor Granted. Aug. 3, 1954 ­M.H.M." Miracles have occured here. Miracles! The earth should have been shaking. 
Yet the moment was still as my mother, with no particular religious affiliation, stood there watching my father light his candle, as if by study­ing his example she could figure out how to par­ticipate in the mechanism of faith. 
And what exactly is faith? If you're not sure, don't worry. There are many groups out there today willing to explain it to you. From Southern fundamentalists to conservative Catholics, Americans of all colors are worried about the non­believers and the evil effects they are supposedly having on society. 
When Notre Dame expels a student for a parie­tals violation, the University displays (although It will never admit it) a fear that students are not obeying its rule against pre-marital sex. Or take for example the television evangelist Jimmy Swag­gert, who believes rock music publications help lead teenagers down a path of drugs, violence, sexual promiscuity and general mayhem. He names the country's fastest-growing retailer, the Wal-Mart discount chain, as contributing to America's moral degeneration by selling rock publications. Shortly thereafter Wal-Mart pulls all rock-related magazines, including Rolling Stone, from its shelves. 
It Is sad that people feel compelled to force others to believe exactly as they do. Perhaps It is more reassuring, more a confirmation of a reli­gion's position, to have others ascribe to the same tenets. 
But what if my father had demanded that my mother participate In his particular set of beliefs? I doubt they would have remained married for these 21 years. The Grotto and all It embodies may mean little to someone like my mother, who

cannot accept a faith manifested through objects and rituals. She must find something else to serve as a vehicle of faith. 
But to my father, the Catholic church with its prayers and masses does mean something. I think It must provide him with a structure -something which he can actually see and touch -that will support a concept such as belief that has no tan­gible shape, form or explanation. 
My point is therefore very simple. I don't think it matters exactly what you believe in, but rather that you believe. Faith, although all-important, is extremely personal. Thus it also has many forms. A person can't believe In something he or she cannot fundamentally accept. 
But mankind with all Its history of inquisitions, religious discriminations and general Intolerance will never be content to allow people who need It the luxury of their own belief. 
Back at the Grotto, my dad stood looking at his candle. "Great Uncle Bobby -third row from the front. eighth slot from the left," he repeated, trying perhaps to give shape to a concept like death which goes beyond human understanding. 
My mother nodded absently, and then we left. My dad was mumbling something reassuringly practical about maybe the four little candles for 25 cents each being a better buy than the one big candle for a dollar. 
The SYR was held last Friday and was Fisher's first of the fall semester. The Observer apologizes for this copy editing er­

Former prisoner here to act, teach students 
By TIM CLARK 
Staff Reporter 
A former San Quentin prison Inmate, here to perform in "Krapp's Last Tape," wants to not only perform but also share his unique perspective with aspiring actors. 
Former san Quentin inmate Rick Cluchey will perform Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" tonight, tomorrow and Friday at 8:10p.m. in Washing­ton Hall. 
The veteran of three Beckett plays, Cluchey thinks he lends a unique perspective to Beckett's plays. 
"In prison, I underwent suffer­ing and punishment day in and day out, much like the characters in Beckett's plays," he com­mented. "Ultimately, however, my experience uniquely prepared me for the New York drama critics," he added. 
In the play, Cluchey takes the role of Krapp, an old man who regretfully looks back on his life. "The play Is basically an anagram of light and dark," said Cluchey. 
Despite the depressing theme, Cluchey adds a touch of comedy to the play and finds that many hopeful youth attend his perfor­mances. He said, "I generally see about a 50-50 split between young and old at the off­Broadway performances." 
"Others simply want to see the play as directed by Its author and understand how Beckett views his own work." he commented. 
Cluchey enjoys a unique rela­tionship with Beckett, who In­spired Cluchey to act and then later discovered him. Cluchey described the playwrlte as "demanding yet kind, generous and warm." 
Cluchey first became inter­ested in acting after seeing Be­ckett's "Waiting for Godot" while In San Quentin. "I rushed to the prison library afterward, but both copies of the play were gone so I had to wait and the desire grew." 
While in prison, Cluchey wrote "Cage," a play that showed the reality of life in prison. "The piece did a great deal for the cause of prison reform," he said. 
Cluchey will offer workshops, advice and lectures on Beckett and his work for aspiring actors and interested people at 12:15 
p.m. and 4:00p.m. on the day of each performance. 
Tickets for the performances are $6 main floor and $5 balcony with student and senior citizen discounts tonight and tomorrow. All workshops and lectures are open to the public and free of charge.

Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon called for by UN Security Council 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS  The Secur­ity Council passed a resolution yesterday demanding that Israel withdraw all of its forces from Lebanon, but Israel-had an­nounced earlier that it would not comply. 
The resolution passed 14-0 with the United States abstain­ing. 
It instructs the secretary­general to arrange for the deployment of U.N. peac_ekeep­ing forces into the buffer zone in southern Lebanon now held by Israel "and solemnly calls on all the parties concerned to cooperate in the achievement of that objective." 
U.S. ambassador Vernon Wal­ters said the resolution was flawed because no solution is possible until all the parties in southern Lebanon reach agree­ment on security arrangements. But the United States did not use the veto, which it has as one of the five permanent council mem­bers. 
The resolution asks Secretary­General Javier Perez de Cuellar to report back to the council in 21 days on the implementation of the resolution. 

It condemned attacks ma<;le upon members of the United Na­tions Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, over the past month, with the French contingent being the main target. Four French sol­diers and an Irish officer have been killed since Aug. 11 in at­tacks by Moslem extremists who consider UNIFIL an obstacle to their aim of attacking Israel. 
Israel told the council Monday it would not withdraw from the "security zone" that it set up along the border in southern Lebanon after it withdrew the bulk of its forces in June 1985 
AMA says doctors should disclose drug addict names to authorities 


Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Doctors who dis­cover that their patients threaten public safety because of drug abuse or other problems should set aside doctor-patient con­fidentiality and tell authorities, the American Medical Associa­tion says. 
A doctor otherwise could be held legally liable for any harm that results, B.J. anderson, AMA associate general counsel, said yesterday. 
The Pittsburgh Press reported Sunday that at least 2.3 airline crew members, including a pilot near death from a cocaine over­dose, had been treated at Pit­tsburgh hospitals for medical crises related to drug abuse. Hospital officials said confiden­tiality laws prevented them from reporting the drug abuse.

be removed from her record once she completed the pre-trial program. 
She said paying the fine for the citation would still leave the cita­tion on her record. 
Lewis Hall rector Chris Men­gucci said a new resident assis­tant has been selected from last semester's alternates. 
Keenan Hall rector Brother Bonaventure Scully said he has selected a candidate and has sent the name to Student Affairs for approval. 
"We took all the seniors in the dorm and considered them (for the job)," Scully explained. "It really was a consensus of myself and the RAs and the assistants," he said. 
Although DeWald and Peter­sen's dismissals mean that they must move out of the resident assistants' rooms, both will be permitted to stay in their same dorms. 
DeWald said she plans to con­
tinue to reside in Lewis. 
Petersen said he was unsure whether he would remain in Keenan. 
Correction 

In yesterday's Student Senate article, the information about the forum on students' rights at off­campus parties was incorrect. It will be conducted by a represen­tative of the county prosecutor's office at 7 tonight in Room 127 of Nleuwland Science Hall. The article was also unclear about a resolution about parietals. It must be approved by the Campus Life Council and Vice President for Student Affairs Fa­ther David Tyson before It can take affect. 
Anderson said yesterday that while chemical abuse programs that get federal money are prohibited from revealing the names of participants, the legal ban does not extend to medical treatment outside such pro­grams. 
But Lou Gable, spokesman for the Hospital Association ofPenn­sylvania, said a 1972 state law forbids such disclosure even out­side formal rehabilitation pro­grams. 
That puts medical people in a difficult spot in cases like those of the airline workers, he said. If they don't disclose names, "there's a possibility for catastrophe. Ifthey do tell some­body, they're liable to be sued or prosecuted," he said. 
Some way should be found to let medical people report such cases "without It coming back and biting them," he said. 

Normally, Anderson said, doc­tors have an ethical obligation to keep medical information about their patients confidential. 
But "physicians recognize the moral obligation under certain circumstances to report because of the overriding consideration for public safety," Anderson said. 
Neither the issue nor the prob­lem of drug abuse in positions crucial for public safety is new, she said. 
The AMA's council on ethical and judicial affairs has stated, "The obligation to safeguard pa­tient confidence is subject to cer­tain exceptions, which are ethi­cally and legally justified because ofoverriding social con­siderations."

Children face bigger problems today, survey discloses 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Three out of four American adults think the problems facing today's children are more severe than when they were growing up, and even more are willing to pay higher taxes for better schools, drug treat­ment, and other services for kids, according to a Louis Harris survey. 
The comprehensive poll demonstrates that "the United States in the 1980s may be the first society in history in which children are distinctly worse off than adults," said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who joined Harris at a news confer­ence yesterday. 
At the same time, Moynihan added, it "gives us hope that the grown-ups are finally recogniz­ingthe problem." 
The first national survey of public attitudes toward the prob­lems of children found that drug abuse is perceived as the most serious, with 52 percent ofadults putting that at the top of the list. 
The survey, based on half­hour-long telephone interviews with 1, 254 adults, showed the vast majority believes a wide range of other problems facing children, including hunger, kid­napping, sexual assault, paren­tal abuse, suicide and prostitu­tion, have increased in recent years. 
The survey, commissioned by the Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.'s Group W, found that less than half of the public believes that most American children are basically happy (48 percent), or get a good education (40 per­cent), or live in a safe neighbor­hood (36 percent). 
Other findings in the July 29­August 7 survey: 
Only 43 percent felt schools are doing a good job meeting their responsibilities to children. 
Forty percent said hunger is on the rise among children. 
Only 28 percent felt the federal government was doing a good job regarding children, whilejust 34 percent gave local govern­ments a good rating. 
Barely half, 53 percent, believe that most children have loving parents. 
Teen-agers are perceived as particularly at risk. with half of the public believing that most teen-agers have sex at least oc­casionally, 43 percent believing that most teen-agers use alco­hol, and 31 percent believing that most use drugs regularly. And only 41 percent ofthose sur­veyed said American teen-agers read and write adequately. 
Among blacks, 84 percent felt that children's problems have grown worse. 
Majorities of adults said they would be willing to increase their taxes for programs to trace mis­sing children (86 percent), for drug prevention programs (83 percent), for public schools (76 percent), for day care programs (73 percent) and for parks and recreation programs (70 per­cent). And 70 percent said they at least "somewhat approve" of the government providing birth control services for teen-agers. 
Given the sampling size of 1, 254 adults, the survey has a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction.

Cluchey: from inmate to actor 
LAURA LINDNER 
features writer 

Ex-San Quentin Inmate and world-renowned actor Rick Clue­hey brings playwright Samuel Beckett to Notre Dame this week. Cluchey will be performittg Be­ckett's play, "Krapp's Last Tape" "as a teaching model for theatri­cal students," he said. 
Cluchey's internationally FJC· claimed acting expertise is not based on childhood aspirations; rather It is directly related to his experience as an inmate in San Quentin from 1955 to 1966. 
Cluchey was introduced to the theater in 1957 when the San Francisco Actors' Workshop visited San Quentin with a per­formance of"Waiting for Godot." As a result of this experience a group ofinmates founded an act­ing troupe, the San Quentin Drama WorkShop. The San Fran­cisco Actor's Workshop was the audience for their first produc­tion, "Waiting for Godot." leading to an exchange of pro­fessional guidance for their productions of Beckett's "Endgame" and "Krapp's Last Tape." 
During this time Ciuchey wrote three plays, one of which, "The Cage," is based on a stage image in "Waiting for Godot." After seven productions of Beckett's plays in almost four years at San Quentin, "The Cage" premiered in regional and university theaters and was produced Off­Broadway. "It was a crusade for penal reform, a means to ed­ucate college students about prisons," said Cluchey of the play. 
In 1966 Ciuchey was paroled, along with other members of the troupe, for his skill as an actor, director, and playwright. 
Cluchey finally met Beckett in 1974. The San Quentin Drama Workshop was performing "Endgame" at the Edinburgh Festival and critics raved about the performance. When the troupe was later performing the play in Paris in Beckett's honor, ---------------------------------:--------:-_J

Beckett's use of "searing 
images, haunting and cosmic in 
resonance, as he strips down and 
refines allows him to make use 
of his incredible dramatic faculty 
in his relationship to his actors 
and actresses," said Cluchey. 
Contrary to what many critics 
believe, Beckett allows an area 
of dramatic license within the 
context of his play. Cluchey uses 
"Krapp's Last Tape" as an exam­
ple. Beckett gave Cluchey the 
tonal relationship and physical 
spine but Cluchey was instructed 
to find the internal character, 
specifically the anger of a man 
confined to a den, work table and 
the shadows of life. 
Samuel Beckett is always the 
master in control of his work, not 
the emotionally unstable person 
suffering from the disabilities in­
dicated by his characters, but his 
art is rooted in personal experi­
ence, according to Cluchey. "Life 
is imitating art. and art is imitat­
ing life, for we always report 
creatively upon ourselves. Whe­
ther we are writing poetry, 
fiction, novels or plays we em­
bellish our own life but in the 
work itself, we are masked." said 
Cluchey. 
Cluchey once asked Beckett 
his method of writing. Beckett 
replied, "I begin with a blank 
page, close my eyes and hear a 
voice. I write what he says, put 
it away and later apply my critical 
intelligence. I take no sides. I am 
interested in the shape of ideas. 
There is a wonderful sentence in 
Augustine. 'Do not despair; one 
of the thieves was saved. Do not 
presume; one of the thieves was 
damned.· That sentence has a 
wonderful shape. It is the shape 
that matters." The key for Be­
ckett is 51. Augustine and his 
words are used in "Waiting for 
Godot." Beckett has often been 
labeled a negative theologist but 
according to Cluchey this does 
not apply. "Beckett suffers visibly 
from all images of world pain 
and l1is works focus on the 
wretchedness of man without 
God; therefore he is not a god­
less man. Beckett is definitely a 
private person because he is not 
going to interfere in anyone's 
opinion or take a position, and 
for this reason the critics have 
taken advantage of him," said 
Cluchey. 
Now revenge is coming to Be­
ckett. Everyone is returning to 
one of the 20th century's 
greatest playwrights. His Off­
Broadway productions continue 
to sell out despite criticism in 
New York. Cluchey can't envision 
a more wonderful way for the 
great playwright and close friend 
to round off his career. 
Cluchey will be performing "Krapp's Last Tape" at Washington Hall Sept. 24-26 at 8:10p.m. Tickets are available at the Washinqton Hall ticket office.

University ignores·alcohol policy on game day 
Recently, I wandered out to Green Field on a sunny Saturday morning to stretch my legs and escape the pressures of col­lege life. Expecting to be alone, I instead found myself in the midst of a wild frenzy ofdrunkenness, swearing. and other non­sociable behavior. 
Mark Dickinson 
guest column 

I stared in disbelief and asked myself how this could be happening at a Univer­sity which so clearly states no one can drink a beer outside the dark confines of his own closet. I knew the University wasn't joking since many of my friends had written checks to pay for the hideous crime of walking in a hallway with a beer. 
Worse. I had seen students shipped off to unknown offices in the Administrative building. sent for psychological treat­ment. and told to perform a community service as penance for some of the same 
alcohol induced behavior I was now wit­
nessing. 
Then I remembered. This was a home 

football game. 
I shuddered to think of the army of security personnel that would be thun­dering down upon this gathering if it were taking place on a Tuesday afternoon.· Today none were around. 
What was different about today? Why was it suddenly fine to drink to excess in public? The students were the same. DuLac was the same. The only noticeable difference was the prescence of alumni. Yet how could they change the interpre­tation of the rules'? 
I thought about why the University chose to ignore its stance on alcohol this day and decided the rules just couldn't be enforced, but I knew that was a cop out. Only one answer remained -the Uni­versity chose to ignore the situation for fear of upsetting these benefactors of the

Soviet Union has not raised concerns of activists. as their attention span is solely on the contra issue which possesses a level of intensity and potential for con­frontration nowhere near that resulting from our lie with Pakistan. 
The con~ressional and activist criticism over Nicaragua concerns a country with which our military involvement is quite modest and where chances of escalation to superpower confrontation are quite slim. Such criticism is misplaced and in­consistent when considering the blatant American military connection with such Third World countries as Pakistan where dan~er for escalation is much greater. 
While I do not question the sincerity and motives of the grassroots peace movement against 'contra' funding. I do question those political and social leaders who sound a rallying cry and warn of an­otller Vietnam. Such warnings are il­legitimate and illogical when considering American activity elsewhere. If it is indeed dan~erous policy to combat communism on a small military scale in a tiny country in our own backyard. surely it must be dramatically more so for a large, complex military operation in the Soviet's back­yard.

Security's jurisdiction comes under fire 
Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame Security has informed the two alumni that were mugged on Green Field at 8:30 p.m. after the Michigan game that they will do all that they can. But what can Notre Dame Security do? Recent events have led me to question their ability and jurisdiction. Either Rex Rackow has not clearly defined Notre Dame Security's role or he has dis­regarded its traditional role. In either case, questions remain concerning what Notre Dame Security can and cannot do for students, faculty and staff. 
I do know what Notre Dame Security cannot do for us. They are consistently unable to prevent VCR. stereo and bicycle theft from dorms on campus. They can­not prevent numerous counts of van­dalism and burglary of cars. They also cannot prevent muggings on Green Field. My dorm alone has been burglarized on at least 5 separate occasions in the last 3 years. Two friends have had car win-

dows broken and the stereo stolen. This is not to mention my friends who were mugged. 
In spite of Security's inability to keep the Notre Dame campus secure, they have extended their power off-campus in what I believe to be a breach ofjurisdic­tion. Of course, we have been given ex­planations such as "protection of Notre Dame students," "observation," and my favorite, that of the Notre Dame Security person who was looking for her husband who was involved with a raid as a member of the Roseland Police Department. AIL some or none of these reasons may be true. In any case, Security's presence raised questions during and after the raid. Notre Dame Security may havejuris­diction at these raids. If so, Rex Rackow should clarify this policy with us. If not we still deserve a reasonable explanation. Furthermore, Notre Dame Security should concentrate on keeping the campus safe and secure before they ex­tend themselves off-campus.

Sox number remains three 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Rick Manning hit a three-run homer and Paul Molitor went 3-for-4 with two RBI to boost the Milwaukee Brewers to an 8-5 victory last night over the American League East­leading Boston Red Sox. 
Boston's magic number to clinch its first division title in 11 years remained at three because New York and Toronto, tied for second place, both won. 
Tim Leary, 10-12, gave up eight hits and four runs In five innings for his first win since Aug. 12.

Johnson likes his chances against top-ranked Sooners 
Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla.-Just like last year, University of Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson believes his football team is superior to the top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. 
Last year, Johnson kept his opinion to himself until after the Hurricanes beat the Sooners 27­14 at Norman, Okla. This time, Johnson is being a little brasher before the game. 
"I felt like we had the better football team last year,"Johnson said Tuesday. "I feel like we have the better football team this year." 
Johnson then offered further pregame comments about this clash between the No. I and No. 2 teams in the country. 
"It's going to be a very, very close game between two great teams and I think it will come down to which team makes the fewest mistakes," he said. 
This is only the 20th time the two top-ranked teams in The As­sociated Press poll have met, the most recent being the Oct. 19, 1985 game between No. 1 Iowa and No. 2 Michigan. Iowa won that game 12-1 0, giving the top­ranked teams a 14-.3-2 record in the matchups. 
"For every football fan, player and coach, this is the absolute ultimate in excitement," Johnson said. "You have the defending national champions playing the team that gave them their only loss last year. You've got No. 1 playing No. 2. I know the adrenaline will be flowing for everybody." 
But just moments later, Johnson changed his tune. 
"This isjust our fourth game," he said. "We've won three and we're looking to win four." 
He said for the Hurricanes to beat the Sooners, they need to slow down the Wishbone attack directed by sophomore quarter­back Jamelle Holieway. 
Last year, Holieway wasn't sharp when he took over after the Hurricanes knocked out starting quarterback Troy Aik­man. But Holieway went on to lead the Sooners to eight straight victories and the national cham­pionship. 
The maturation of Holieway isn't the only reason the Sooners may be better this year than last, according to Johnson. 
"I think this year, more than others, they have tremendous talent in the offensive line," he said. "They are more physical and quicker. They've always had great talent in the backfield, but now they have that kind of skill behind one of their best lines ever." 
Meanwhile, Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde said, "There are things to be concerned about with Oklahoma, but I wouldn't say we're worried."

Weissenhofer makes strong return 
By MIKE CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 

Despite dropping their first two games of the young 1986 cam­paign, the Irish have a new, pos­itive attitude that will translate into a good season, according to Irish linebacker Ron Weissen­hofer. 
"I see us having a good season," says Weissenhofer. "We're 0-2, but that doesn't knock us out of post-season play. 
"After we lose, it's not like a loss. We feel like we're going to get back on the winning track. Last year, it seemed like people were giving up. This year, It's to­tally opposite. It's nothing like last year at all." 
Coming into his fifth year, Weissenhofer is confident that he will finish his Notre Dame career on a positive note with this new Irish attitude and a starting role. After recovering from a broken wrist and backing Tony Furjanic for two years, Weissenhofer has finally earned a starting role for this season at Inside linebacker. 
"He's done very, very well," says Notre Dame Defensive Co­ordinator Foge Fazio. "He's done a great job for us. He's not a flashy ball player, but he does hisjob. He's one ofthose unsung heroes that just keeps pluggin' away." 
For the Irish, the 6-.3, 221­
pound, Welssenhofer calls the
..___.,...,________,..___________. signals on defense. He concen­trates his efforts In the middle of 
the line and keys the defense against the run. 
"He's our might linebacker," Fazio says. "He's got to plug the middle up, and he's got to be excellent against the inside run. 
"(Senior Mike) Kovaleski is the linebacker that is going to make most of the tackles," continues Fazio. "He plays in a position where he is protected and doesn't have to clog up the middle or hold his area down like Ron does. Ron's linebacker posi­tion is one that has to plug the 

Weissenhofer's rise to defen­sive signal caller does not suprise those who have followed his career through the rough, run-oriented Chicago Catholic League. At Saint Rita High School In Chicago, Weissenhofer was a standout linebacker who won consensus prep All-American

honors. He earned four letters In 
football at the high school level 
and was recognized among the 
best incoming freshmen in 1982 
by Football News and The Sport­
ing News. 
After filling in on specialty 
teams during the 1982 season, 
Weissenhofer broke his wrist in 
two-a-day workouts just prior to 
the start of the 198.3 season and 
was sidelined for the year. With 
this year off, he was awarded his 
current year of eligibility. 
"I wanted to come back and 
play football for another year un­
der Lou Holtz," says Weissen­
hofer. Last May, Weissenhofer 
earned a degree in Marketing. 
Currently, he is enrolled In an 
MBA program in the Notre Dame 
College of Business. 
Following a year off, Weissen­
hofer assumed an increasing 
role on the Irish defensive unit. 
In 1984, he played in nine games 
and started against Colorado, 
South Carolina, and Navy. Over­
all, he totalled .35 tackles, Includ­ing 16 solos, made 48 specialty team appearances, and worked his way back to a top reserve role. 
Last year, Weissnehofer played in all but one game against LSU. In his 10 outings, he had one start and made 41 tackles. He also made 70 specialty team ap­pearances. 
Fazio is also pleased with the inside linebacker and his perfor­mance which has netted 1.3 tackles, including one incredible drop for a loss against Michigan State. 
"He really played very well In the third quarter versus Michigan State," says Fazio. "He made a play that was the best to date." 
In replacing Furjanlc as the sig­nal caller, Welssenhofer feels no pressure to duplicate Furjanlc's statistics. Welssenhofer does, however, feel confortable In his position. 
"I definitely enjoy defending against the run . . . taking on blocks, getting off blocks, and making the tackle," says Wels­senhofer. "It's like the good old Catholic League Style of play." 
Overall, the veteran likes what he sees in the new coaching staff and believes that the Irish will continue to Improve. 
"I'm pretty Impressed by Coach Holtz," says Welssen­hofer. "His coaching staff Is one of the best In the nation. 
"There's always room for Im­provement and I think we're coming along pretty well. If we could alleviate the turnovers, we'd be 2-0 Instead of 0-2 right now.

Wilkins agrees to deal with Hawks 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins, the NBA's top scorer last season, Tuesday signed a new five-year, $6..3 mil­lion contract with the Hawks that he negotiated without the help of his agent. 
"We're happy to announce that Dominique has signed a contract that secures the Hawks' future for the next five years," Hawks' Pres­ident and General Manager Stan Kasten said at a news confer­ence. "It will provide Dominique with lifetime security." 
The 26-year-old Wilkins, who came to the news conference with his mother, Gertrude Baker, said his signing without an agent was "not unprecedented." 
He said he had discussions with his agent, Patrick Healy, but ''wanted to get It over with."

National League pitchers battle for Cy Young honors 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON · Los Angeles' Fer­nando Valenzuela, the National League's first 20-game winner this season, and Houston's strikeout ace Mike Scott appear to be the top candidates for the NL's Cy Young Award. 
The Dodgers are pushing Valenzuela, who pitched a two­hitter against the Astros Monday night to reach he 20-victory mark for the first time in his career. He's also the first Dodgers' 20­game winner since Tommy John In 1977 and the first Mexican­born m~or leaguer to win 20 games in a season. 
The Astros, commanding leaders In the National League West. are boosting Scott, 17-10, who leads the league with 285 strikeouts, in earned run average with 2..3.3 and in innings pitched with 259 1-.3. 
"It depends on what you em­phasize," Scott said. "If you go by earned run average and strikeouts, I've got a pretty good shot." 
Valenzuela, who won the award as a rookie in 1981, said he's not worrying about winning again. 
"''ve got nothing to do with the Cy Young voting." Valenzuela said. "All I can do is pitch my best. But I'd much rather be in this clubhouse than theirs." 
Astros third baseman Phil Garner thinks the voting will be close. 
"You've got to look at Scott's ERA and strikeouts and be im­pressed," Garner said. "My vote goes to Scott. But Fernando never beats himself. He pitches well, hits well and cuts off a lot of hits with his glove. He's just one tough pitcher." 
Valenzuela, 20-10, and Scott could be pressed for the award by Pittsburgh's Rick Rhoden, 15­10. 
With no chance of winning the division title, the Dodgers have turned their attention to helping Valenzuela win the Cy Young honor.

Bruce "Tiger" McCourt is flying high these days as the leading scorer of the Irish soccer 
McCourt goes after scoring mark as soccer team faces Blue Demons 

By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame soccer team's offense has found a solution to last year's lethargic offense -un­leash a Tiger at the opponents. 
This year sophomore forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt has ter­rorized opponents, registering nine goals and three assists in eight games this season. In fact. his total of 21 points is just four points shy of matching the top point total of any player last season. 
Ideally McCourt would like to reach that plateau this afternoon when Irish face the Blue Demons of DePaul at 3 p.m. at Alumni field. Last year he scored his first goal of his collegiate career against DePaul, so he thinks it would be fitting to reach another milestone against the Blue Demons. 
A native St. Louislan, McCourt and his family moved several times before settling In South Bend eight years ago. At St. 
Joseph's High School, he was the team's most valuable player all four years. He also set the school scoring record with 8I goals and 30 assists. 
Head Coach Dennis Grace had spotted McCourt in a summer camp. But before he could get McCourt, he had to wait a year. 
"Tiger had It in his heart to be at Notre Dame," says Grace. "So he spent a year over at Holy Cross." 
Because Holy Cross had no soccer program, McCourt was out of competiton for an entire year. So when he transferred to Notre Dame last year, the adjust­ment to collegiate-level soccer was a little harder. 
"Tiger had to make a big ad­justment to play the way we play," says Grace. "But going day In and day out against good com­petlton helped him." 
McCourt ended up playing in all 22 games last year. He scored six goals, one the game-winner against North Carolina­Charlotte. 

However the team suffered through an offensive slump. The team's leading scorer, forward Joe Sternberg. hadjust 25 points in 22 games. The team also set a record for lowest goals-per­game average with two. 
"The ball would always hit tlie crossbar last year," says McCourt. "Luck was definitely not on our side. This year, they're just going ln." 
Through eight games this season the team has scored 25 goals. Forwards Dan Augustyn and Randy Morris have also been Instrumental to the scoring revival. 
Randy and Dan always take it to the end lines," explains McCourt. "When they beat the last guy, I turn my guy's back to the play and make a run." 
It is true that McCourt tends to score goals more than he does assist on goals. But as Sunday's game against Tri-State proved, he should stick to goal scoring.

Notre Dame faces Bowling Green Lambert pleased with progress 
By BRIAN 0' GARA 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame volleyball team seeks to continue it's win­ning ways tonight as the Irish face Bowling Green. 
This match will be a tough early-season test for the young Irish squad, which is off to it's best start in recent years with a 7-4 record. 
"We are coming along very well, right on schedule," says Coach Art Lambert. "I feel very good about the team's progress
.. 
these past few weeks." 

The Irish have won the Rice Tournament and placed second in the Hoosier Classic and the Bradley Tournament. 
Notre Dame-Bowling Green volleyball games have provided for ·some exciting moments In recent years. 
In 1984, the Irish pulled out a slim victory at home in a barn­burner (13-15,16-14, 17-15,16­I4). Last season Bowling Green pulled out a victory at home, defeating the Irish (4-15,5­15, 15-6, 9-I5). 
"We played bad in that match and just couldn't get out of it," said junior setter Kathy Morin, "We really want to get them back." 
The Irish have a great oppor­tunity to do just that. With the addition of two outstanding freshmen, Taryn Collins and Kathy Cunningham, the contin­ued improvement of four sop­homores and four juniors, and the leadership of seniors Mollie Merchant and Karen Sapp, the Irish have come a long way since last fall. 
Without hesitation, Lambert 

claims, "This is the best team since I've been here. No doubt." Lambert's prediction for 
tonight's game? 
"It's anybody's guess really. I'm pleased with our play and Im­provement, but Bowling Green is a very competative team." 
This one has the makings of another exciting match between the two teams as they clash tonight in the ACC Pit at 7:30 p.m. 
After tonight's game, the Irish travel to western Indiana to do battle with Valparaiso University on Thursday at 7 p.m. Although the Irish have handily defeated them in the past few years, Val­paraiso recently defeated highly­ranked DePaul, a good indica­tion that they will be ready to give the Irish a fight Thursday eve­ning. 
Close is not enough as Irish stay winless 
Close, but no cigar. 
This time-worn expression is the story of the young fotball season for the Irish. 
Notre Dame has outgained both of its opponents this season, scored first in both games, and has had a chance to win both games with late scores. But it has failed to do so both times. 
Head Coach Lou Holtz is definitely not pushing the panic button yet, and neither should Irish fans. But Holtz also was not predicting a quick remedy to the problem. 
"We've been in both games right down to the end, so there's no reason for our players to feel down," he said. "We've just got to do better until we win in those situations.

"''m not down on this team or down on any of our players. 
I've said all along that we will be a good team, I just don't 
know how long it will take." 
The problem of being close, but not coming through in the end is visible in the Irish offense. It has piled up yardage between the 20-yard lines, but once it penetrates the oppo­sition's 20, the movement ceases. 
Coming away with only a field goal is sometimes disap­pointing. but it is better than nothing. Six times this season, the Irish have moved inside the opponent's 20, and come away empty. No points. Zero. 
Against Michigan, two fumbles and an interception thwarted the Irish scoring bids. Last Saturday, the culprits were a missed field goal, a fumble, and an interception. The result of all this is that Notre Dame is 0-2 when it easily could be 2-0. 
That all sounds innocent enough, but it has been a long time since the Irish have been 0-2. This is only the third time in this century that the Irish have lost two straight to open the season, and only the fifth time in history. 
The last time it happened, and don't get all excited about this, was in I978, and the Irish went on to win eight straight and capture a Cotton Bowl win over Houston. 
Before Notre Dame dreams about going on a winning streak. however, they must win one. They have a chance to do that against Purdue this week. 
Purdue has been a bad dream for the Irish the past two meetings. Two years ago, the Boilermakers defeated the Irish at the Hoosier Dome, 23-2 I. Last year, Jim Everett completed 27 of 49 passes for an Irish-opponent record 368 yards to lead a 35-I7 romp over Notre Dame. 
At least we can take heart in the fact that Everett has gone to the greener pastures of professional football. Or can we? 
You see, the Boilermakers, never a team weak at quarter­back, have Jeff George at the controls now. You may recall him as the most highly-sought high school quarterback in the country last year. 
He is the man to stop for Purdue, since saying he carries most of the offensive load would be a terrible understatement. Purdue averages 267.5 yards per game offensively. All but I6 have come through the air. 
The Irish secondary will need an outstanding performance to keep the freshman in check. So far, the defense has con­tained the opponents' primary weapons fairly well, but Purdue quarterbacks have traditionally been a trouble spot for the Irish. 
Another trouble spot appeared in last week's game. The running game, which piled up 192 yards against Michigan, managed a meager 82 yards against Michigan State. 
Compounding the problem with the running game was the inability of the special teams to perform. 
Dan Sorenson finally got some game action, but the line seemed to be setting up a screen pass as a host of green jerseys put heavy pressure on. The Irish caught a big break when one kick took a huge Notre Dame bounce. 
The punting game provided some more thrills later on when Sorenson had to make a leaping one-handed grab to field a snap and get the ball off. 
Unfortunately, the punting team provided more excitement than the kickoff return team, and that is never a good sign. 
Poor communication and shoddy blocking put the Irish in the hole on several occasions. That is doubly bad news when the offense must rely almost exclusively on the pass. 
At last week's press conference, Holtz said that a team usually improves the most between the first and second games of the season. If that's true, I hope the Irish do not "Improve" any more this season. 
They looked impressive in the opener and lost by one. They looked unimpressive in last week's game and lost by five. One week confident. the next week incompetent. 
It does not matter. The results were the same. 
They do not get lovely parting gifts, or even a heartfelt snap of the fingers from Vanna White to show she feels bad about it. too. 
Just an 0-2 record. 
Close, but no cigar.
