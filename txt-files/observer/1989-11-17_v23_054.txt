Cause of laundry fire still unknown 

By JOHN O'BRIEN News Writer 
University officials and fire department investigators spent much of Thursday assessing the damage and preparing a response to the fire which gut­ted St. Michael's Laundry early Thursday morning. 
Vice President for Business Affairs Thomas Mason said that it would be some time until the cause of the fire could be determined. 
"We have to get the roof out of there before the investiga­tors can go in," Mason said. 
While there is no damage es­timate yet, Mason said that the middle portion of the building, called the "1934 section," is "gone." The roof to this section collapsed in a rush of flames at 3 a.m. Thursday morning. 
Mason said. however. that the end sections of the building, which contained the offices of

the Laundry and the dry clean­ing "escaped in relatively fair shape. All our records and our computer in the office appear to be, at this time, salvage­able." 
The laundry is one of the few buildings on the Notre Dame campus that did not have a fire· alarm, said Rex Rakow, direc­tor of Security, in an interview with the South Bend Tribune. 
University President Father Edward Malloy, who cancelled a speaking engagement at the Air Force Academy, said "We are so happy that there was no injury or loss of life." 
Malloy met on Thursday afternoon with the officers of the University and administra­tors whose departments were involved in the fire. "All of the immediate steps have been laid out and responsibilities as­
signed," he said. 
The Earth Science portion of Brownson Hall sustained minor damage, including broken win­dows and some "water damage to their computer room but as far as we know it was not ex­tensive," Mason said. 
"With the· way the wind was blowing, we could have lost a number of buildings," Mason said. 
Malloy praised the work of firefighters who battled the blaze. "There was a time where we were at serious risk of los­ing a couple of other buildings. They did a great job of contain­ing it and controlling it." 
"The loss of the Laundry is a bad situation, but when you look at the potential of what could have happened, we have a lot to be thankful for," Mason said.

ND computing launches major networking program 
By SARAH VOIGT 
News Writer 
The Office of University Com­puting has just launched some of its most exciting and inno­vative projects as the University progresses into a more ad­vanced phase of its campaign to improve the computing sys­tem on campus. 
For example, by the middle of next semester the Office of Uni­versity Computing will have ex­tended a fiber backbone net­work to link all the principle acauemic and administrative buildings on campus. 
James Wruck, director of systems and networking ser­vices, coordinates the network­ing project. "About a year and a half to two years ago we put in a backbone network that linked the engineering, science and biology buildings and also

linked them into the National Science Foundation [NSF] net­work," he said. 
Wruck explained that this de­velopment allowed researchers to gain access to the large store of information in the NSF supercomputer. 
This summer a fiber-based network was put in place that linked together computers in the Administration Building, the Hesburgh Library and Nieuwland Science Hall, said Wruck. 
This expanded networking system has allowed the Univer­

Six Jesuit priests killed in San Salvador 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -Armed men killed and mutilated six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter Thursday after bursting into their house at a leading university. A priest quoted witnesses as saying government forces were in­volved. 
The government denied re­sponsibility, condemned the slayings as "savage and irra­tional" and said an investiga­tion was under way. 
The U.S. National Council of Churches also denounced the slayings, and the U.S. ambas­sador said the slayings would have a "negative impact" on President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government. 
Two witnesses said about 30 uniformed police or army sol­diers entered the campus be­fore dawn and killed the eight "with lavish barbarity," said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit order leader for Central America. "For example, they (the troops) took out their brains." 
Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas com­pared the killings to the slaying of his predecessor, Oscar Ar­nulfo Romero. That 1980 as­sassination marked the begin­ning of years of killings and kidnappings by right-wing death squads. 
"If this spiral of violence con­tinues, death and destruction will sweep away many, espe­cially those who are of most use to our people," said Rivera Damas after leading a prayer over the mutilated bodies. 
The slayings came on the sixth day of fierce combat around this capital following an attack by leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas. 
The dead included Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose

Don't abandon problems after the hype ends 
I pass that table on the way out of the dining hall everyday. Christine Gill 
Often there are people

there; they are selling Saint Mary's Editor 
things or trying to 
sign you up for 
something; T -shirts, 
blood drive, Chicago 
trip, "Fast for a 
World Harvest." 
I walk past with a 
glance and continue 
on with my day. Wait 

a minute. Fast -what is this? Actually, 
what was this. 

Yesterday, the Saint Mary's community 
participated in Oxfam's "Fast for a World 
Harvest." This is a nationwide day of fast, 
to show support and raise money and 
awareness for people who have little or no 
food. 

How did I walk past with hardly a glance 
all those days? 

I paid attention four years ago when Bob 
Geldof brought "Live-Aid" to the forefront 
of the hunger fighting campaign. 
I was one of the many people who gave up a day for "Hands Across America." What has happened to my h1,.1manitarian spirit? 
Trying to figure out what happened, I came to the conclusion that the American public has been under a barrage of "causes" in the last few years. 
First, there was the famine in Ethiopia. Then, human rights and homelessness. Now, we have the Amazon rain forests and environmental destruction. 
I do not mean to say that there is anything wrong with the efforts different or­ganizations have made on behalf of various 
causes. 

The American public has been made aware of atrocities that are occurring in the world and the time and money it has con­tributed have helped. But these efforts should not give Americans a "Cause-of-the­Month" attitude. 
The issue of hunger -national and worldwide -seems to be at the back of the general public's minds. It was almost five years ago that hunger gained worldwide media attention. 
We have moved on to the equally devastat­ing problems of "crack" and AIDS. But in moving on we cannot abandon those causes to which we committed ourselves in the past. 
Participating in the fast, Saint Mary's has shown that it is aware of the problems that still exist and is helping work to toward an eventual end. We all neecl. to remember that all the problems, all the causes, still exist when the TV has been turned off, the fast day is over or "Time" magazine moves on to a new cover story.

Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa salutes memoers of the Af'OL-CiO convention Wednesday in Washington. Walesa will appear in Chicago, which is second only to Warsaw in polish population, today. Story be­low. 
Solidarity leader Walesa to visit Chicago today 
CIIICAGO (AI'l -Tlw city that boasts tlw world's largest Polish population aftPr Warsaw on Thursday prPJHirPd a joyous WPironw for Solidarity IPadPr I.Pch WaiPsa. 
":'\Jpxt to tlw p<qw's visit hPrP, it's tlw biggPst thing that's happPn<'CI," said Anthony Pi­wowarczyk. vicP prPsidPnt of tlw Polish National AllianrP. 
"Tiwrp's no qtwstion about it," said Homan Pucinski, a city aldPrrnan and pn~sidPnt of the local Polish AmNican Congress. "ThP two top figures of the world today, thP pope and WaiPsa. an~ both Polish." 
Signs dPpicting Walesa were tapnd to store windows up and down a section of Milwaukee Avnnun, c~enwr of the eity's Pol­ish community. "Solidarnosc: A labor lnadPr who is changing thP world," read one. urging attPndanen at a rally Saturday in Walnsa's honor. Another read simply: "The Man." 
As many as 50,000 people are expPcted at the rally, including thousands of children from Polish "Saturday Schools," schools in Polish language, his­tory and culture. It is Walesa's only public appearance in Chicago, with private meetings occupying most of the rest of his onP-day visit. 
WhPn askPd about Walnsa. WojeiPch Cioromski immcdi­atPiy pulled two invitations from his brnast pocket -one to a Saturday breakfast and thn sncond to a lunch honoring tlw labor leader. 
"Absolutnly. They are waiting for Walesa," said Cioromski of Chicago Poles as he drank cof­fep and chain-smoked European cigarettes at the Orbit Restaurant, across the street from Klub Amcryka. 
"Evnrybody wants to see him -but he spends minutes here," he said. 
Walesa will be in Chicago slightly more than 24 hours after he arrives Friday, and the demands for his time have been monumental. 
"They are calling Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk, asking him to attend weddings, birth­day parties, anything you can imagine," said Pucinski, who met with Walesa while in Poland earlier this month. 
Compromise needed in W. Bank 
By SANDRA WIEGAND News Writer 
Mutual compromise is the only way to resolve the Pales­tinian/Israeli conflict, said gov­ernment and international studies professor Alan Dowty, at a lecture last night titled "A Personal Perspective." 
Dowty, who spent 12 years at the Hebrew University in Israel, emphasized that neither side can be seen as completely good or evil. The enemy always ap­pears "extreme," your side al­ways appears "conciliatory," and the press always appears biased against your side, he said. 
"Each side can match atrocity with atrocity," Dowty said 
Dowty said that there are two different ways to approach a settlement: through force or through negotiation. 
"An imposed solution is really aii iliusioii," he said. Dowty referred to a study conducted by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Tel Aviv, which suggested a number of possible solutions to the question of what to do with the occupied territory. The first solution is the con­tinuation of the status quo. A solution that would be neither side's first or second choice for 
settlement, although perhaps preferable when both side's views were taken jointly, it is also "a high cost both economi­cally and humanly," he said. 
The second, the annexation of Israel, would cause war, isola­tion, and civil strife, Dowty said, adding that by the year 2010, Arabs will be a majority in Israel and its occupied terri­tories. 
The third possible solution, a J ordinian!Palestinian confeder­ation, would be "too risky for Israel," he said. This solution would not be acceptable to Palestinians either, 95 percent of whom are in favor of the Palestinian Liberation Organi­zation, Dowty said. 
The fourth solution, unilat­eral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, would probably turn the area into a mini-state with even more conflict, Dowty said. 
Two rnnrp UJorJ...~hJ., ""'"­
.-....... ..., ....... , .. ..., ... .n.uu.. ...., .:3t._l.!...,. 

tions, Dowty said, are highly preferred by one of each of the two factions, but highly objec­tionable to the other. The first, autonomy within the state of Israel, is rejected by almost all Palestinians. The second, the formation of a Palestinian state, is not agreeable to the Israelis. 
Dowty pointed out that nei­ther side was completely "monolithic," however, and that opinions vary within the popu­
lations of the two factions. 
When the Jaffee Center found that none of their proposed so­lutions seemed agreeable to both factions, Dowty said, they had another conference which produced a settlement proposal that the committee found more reasonable, and that Dowty himself felt was the best possi­ble solution. 
The solution would involve a transition period of 10 to 15 years of "broad autonomy to be implemented in the occupied territories without explicitly stating that this is evolving to­ward statehood, but without rejecting that possibility ei­ther," Dowty said. 
As far as the role the United States should play in resolving the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, Dowty said that Americans often have an "illusion of om­nipo!Bnce," believing th!lt once 
they set out to do something they will be able to do it. 
Dowty expressed satisfaction that the United States gives relatively equal amounts of aid to both factions, and tries to serve as an "honest broker" between the two. 
"Reassurance and subtle pressure," Dowty said, should be the underlying attitudes of the United States toward the resolution of the conflict. 
Family and Gender week sponsors panel discussion on having a family and a career 
By HANNAHWU .'·Jews Writer • 
A panel discussion on the dif­ficulties of having both a family and a career titled "Family and Career In Conflict" was held Thursday. 
This panel discussion was the last event in the Family and Gender Issues week on campus. Seven panelists representing di­verse personal backgrounds of­fered their views on how to build a healthy family and a satisfying career. 
"I did not get married before I really felt safe," said Kath­leen Biddick, associate profes­sor of history at Notre Dame.

Biddick also advised students to be very careful about putting a committed relationship into a commuting life. 
"It is very difficult. Try to stay together, especially if you are married," said Biddick, whose marriage suffered as a result of years of commuting. 
The panelists also talked about the struggles they had to go through between age 18 to 25 as they began careers and families. "I was taught that as a girl I was equal in the eyes of God," said Dr. Ellyn Stecker, chair of the local chapter of. National Organization of Women (NOW). She was sur­prised that there were a lot of things she could not do . 
"Always keep looking into yourself and asking yourself 'why my dream is my dream?'" said panelist Suzanne Bullock, who has recently reentered a the workforce after staying home with five children. 
Other panelists were Jennifer Glass, associate professor of sociology, and her husband Bruce Juetten, a case manager for Cass County Mental Health; Peter Smith, professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College, who is married to Stecker; and Tom Bullock, a graduate of St. Mary's College in Berkeley, Calif.

27 dead in violent two-day storm 
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) ­National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday while work crews dug at the debris of a 250 mph tornado that struck virtually without warning, leaving 17 people dead and about 1,000 homeless. 
No bodies were believed left in the rubble, but portions of the city resembled a bombing target. A shopping center. and clusters of apartment buildings were leveled. Cars were piled atop each other. Utility poles had been snapped like twigs. 
The National Weather Service said the tornado path had cov­ered between eight and 1 0 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as 250 mph. 
"It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it on liq­uefy," said rescue worker Bob Caraway. 
The storm system that struck Huntsville -a violent clash of unusually warm and cold air­continued its march north on Thursday, leaving seven schoolchildren dead in New­burgh, N.Y., collapsing homes in New Jersey and shattering skyscrape~: windows in Philadelphia. 
A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high winds on bridge connect­ing Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. A New York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown off a water tower. 
In West Virginia, high winds believed to be tornadoes swept Jefferson County, near Louisville, Ky., early Thursday, injuring four members of one family, two seriously. 
Tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Mississippi. Al­abama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Ken­tucky and Indiana. Altogether, the storms were blamed for at least 26 deaths and more than 500 injuries over the two days. 
In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt said he would ask President Bush to declare Huntsville a disaster area to open the door to millions of dollars in federal relief. Mayor Steve Hettinger said no firm damage estimates were expected until Friday, but he put the number of homeless at 1,000. 
Hunt assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and help law officers guard against looting. Police spokeswoman Susan Williamson said there had been minor looting the night of the storm but no arrests. 
The temperature, which had 
risen to 73 before the storm 
Wednesday, plunged into the 
30s early Thursday while res­
cuers workecf through the night 
under the glare of floodlights. 
The lights, powered by gener­ators, produced an eerie glow in a area that was otherwise largely without power. Tall cranes lifted the heavy rubble, while workers with flashlights picked through the smaller pieces. 
As daybreak came, people be­gan returning to the scene, some to look for valuables in ravaged cars or businesses, others simply out of curiosity. Many carried cameras or videocassette recorders. 
Police Maj. Robert Moder said there was no indication that anyone was left in the rubble. 
"We don't have any reports of people missing," he said Thursday morning. 
Moder said 463 people were injured and more than 150 of those required at least overnight hospital treatment. Authorities had said 19 people were killed but later lowered the death toll by two. 
All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from. 7 to 6 7, were killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march. The other victim per­ished on the city's outskirts, authorities said. 
Most of the dead were in apartments and stores that were torn into twisted wreck­age.

Fire 
continued from page 1 
Determination of the cost of the damage is an ongoing pro­cess, according to Mason. "The insurance office here said the insured replacement value of the building is $3 million, but we don't have an estimate yet on the loss," said Mason. 
"It's going to take a while to rebuild the laundry, so no one should expect to come back for second semester and find it done," Mason said. 


"A number of companies have offered to help us out and we think we're going to accept an offer from St. Joe Medical Cen­ter to help" with institutional laundry such as sheets and pil­lowcases, said Mason. 
Malloy said that he was con­cerned about the employees of the Laundry. "We're going to make every effort to ensure that they are employed in some other unit of the University un­

til we can make a final decision about what we're going to do in terms of laundry in the future," he said. 
James Lyphout, assistant vice president for business affairs, said the University is trying to place the employees of the Laundry into other jobs around campus. 
"We will be using some of the employees to operate the equipment at the St. Joe Medi­cal Center," said Lyphout. "We're going to interview the rest and place them in Food Services, Building Services and Support Services according to their preference or interest." 
"I think we'll be able to place everyone," said Lyphout. 
Malloy praised the coopera­tion of residents of Lewis and Brownson Halls who were forced to evacuate their dorms at 3:10a.m. "There were also a number of students who helped the firefighters with ladders and other aspects of fighting the fire. That contributed to the fact that something more seri­ous had been avoided." 
Malloy, Mason, Lyphout and most of the officers of the Uni­versity were on the scene early Thursday morning.

Zionism. A political movement tied closely to the Jewish faith that inspires a promise of an earthly haven and even a step toward salvation for some. For others, it represents the embodiment of worldly suffer­ing and oppression. 
Its realization in the form of the Zionist state of Israel is lauded as the just restitution for the thousands of years of persecution and slaughter, yet the Zionist state as an institution is condemned for the inhumanity it brings upon the· Palestinians. 
The imperative which is common to most forms of Zionism is the reconstituting of a Jewish society in the promised land, free to live a Jewish lifestyle. The establish­ment of the Jewish State is not intrinsic to the Zionist vision; yet it is the version of Zionism which we are most familiar with because the creation of Is­rael is a historic fact. 
The prevailing version ofr Zionism during the creation of Israel, notably the version pre­ferred bv David Ben-Gurion, the founding leader of Israel, was that the sovereignty of a na­tion-state was necessary to guarantee that a Jewish society could determine its own laws and social norms, act as a haven for all Jews who choose to live free from persecution for being Jewish and to estab­lish defenses for that society. 
Given the familiar form of Zionism as it manifests itself in the fact and the policies of the state of Israel. it is instructive to investigate an alternative view of Zionism, a view which maintains that the question of just and brotherly relations be­tween Jews and Arabs (Palestinians and others) is the most critical challenge to Zion­ism. This is the Zionist vision of Martin Buber the foremost Jewish philosopher-theologian of the century, author of I and Thou, and may be seen in later ages as the Prophet of our time. 
The foundation for Huber's approach to Zionism was his conviction that the Jews are a nation of people who share more than just a common fate; they are a people who have a common fate and a common faith that the Bod of the Bible has assigned to them a task of living according to particular moral imperatives. It is this destiny, unique among nations, from which the Jews derive their tied to the land. 
Buber finds implicit not only that the Jewish people must live in the land, but also how they must live in the land with each other and with other peoples. He argues that, in accordance 
'At this point, the Israelis would have to offer the first olive branch of trust since they have the political and economic infrastructure upon which to build.' 
with the law, the "Arab ques­tion" was (and is) the most critical challenge to Zionism; all decisions must be made with respect to the impact on the Arabs of Palestine. 
The great philosopher-the­ologian was not satisfied with philosophizing above the fray of politics; Buber actively en­gaged in Zionist politics, favor­ing deeds over declarations. Working to apply the com­mandment for truth and jus­tice, Buber sought to bring Arab and Jewish interests to­gether by affirming the mutual love for the land in his pro­posed "land policy." 
This policy proposes an effort to build up the land for the benefit of all, an effort which can be shared by two peoples who both love the land. Through mutual investment in projects, such as the develop­ment of an irrigation network, the "land policy" would improve the health, economy and stan­dard of living for both peoples while at the same time building the brotherhood resulting from shared labor. Brotherhood of shared labor, is, in Huber's view, a necessary part of living out the moral imperative which is "bound up with the land." 

This brotherhood carries with it necessary consequences. According to Buber, the com­mitment to this brotherhood must be invested in the estab­lishment of a bi-national state, Jewish and Palestinian, with each nation having a parity of political power, regardless of the number of Jews compared to the number of Palestinians. In the state which Buber envi­sioned, each community would have autonomy in affairs that concerned themselves, but would have equal power in is­sues which concern both com­munities. 
In this way, Buber hoped to diffuse Palestinian fears of domination by Jewish immi­grants, while assuring Jews the social and political indepen­dence-not sovereignty-neces­sary to carry out their divine task. Huber's proposal went against the grain of main­stream Zionism, with supported immediate and unlimited Jewish immigration for the dual purpose of rescuing Jewish refugees from Europe and for carrying our the political design of creating a Jewish majority and thus Jewish sovereignty. The UN partition negotiations and the creation of the Jewish state, covered in the blood of Jew and Arab alike, was a clear rejection of Buber's brotherly bi-national state; a rejection with ramifica­tions which are being felt ever more strongly day by day. 
Although Buber's vision never came to fruition. his ideas are insightful even in the present 
condition of the Arab-Israeli. crisis. As we see in the daily news, the Palestinians are working urgently to end the 
oppression of the occupation through the creation of an in­dependent state. Different fac­tions are pursuing different means: residents of the occu­pied territories are about to begin a third year of economic and physical hardship in intafada, the PLO leadership is seeking negotiations and radi­cal factions resort to terror­ism. This profile of liberation activities is not unlike the pro­file of the Zionist actitivties against the British and Pales­tinians before 1948. 
The attitudes preventing brotherhood are entrenched and are getting deeper. Each people's perception of the other is getting more ugly and more evil with no end in sight to this nasty spiral. What can break the spiral of distrust and in­crimination? The answer sug­gested by Buber is that the two nations must agree to work together on the achievement of a goal which each of the two nations is independently inter­ested in pursuing. Such projects would probably, but not neces­sarily, fall under the category of the economic development of agriculture and industry. 
At this point, the Israelis would have to offer the first olive branch of trust since they have the political and economic infrastructure upon which to build. A cooperative economic development_program has the potential to develop the fragile Israeli economy into a booming bi-national economy by mobiliz­ing Jewish and Palestinian capi­
tal, minds and labor with a 
blind eye to the nationality of 
these resources. The program 
would have to take the form of 
a single law code for economic 
practices void of favoritism and 
discrimination. 
This code would include free­ing Palestinian capital, allowing Palestinian companies to de­velop, to compete for the Israeli market without the interference of unequal subsidation of Is­raeli industry, and to export and import directly without be­ing required to use Israeli mid­dlemen. Such an explosion of Palestinian agriculture and in­dustry is well within their ca­pability given the high percent­age of Palestinians with high education, business savvy and marketable skills. Legislation for the protection of all work­ers, guaranteeing equal oppor­tunity hiring, equal pay for equal work, health care, job se­curity, and recognition of the universal right to education would also be necessary. Most importantly the economic pro­gram would have to be accom­panied by concessions in Israeli military oppression in the terri­.tories as an initial sign of 
goodwill and a promise of fu­
ture concessions in the effort to 
build brotherhood. 
There is a degree of risk for 
both parties, yet the security of 
each would prosper tremen­
dously. On the economic level, 
cooperation would stabilize the 
regional economy and make the 
bi-national economic unit 
(perhaps someday state) into a 
vital and competitive member 
of the European Economic 
Community. The real benefit 
would be the security with re­
gard to national preservation 
for each of the parties. This se­
curity would result from the 
sense of shared fate accompa­
nying the economic partnership 
resulting in a durable friend­
ship and alliance. Let us hope 
against fate that not all of our 
prophets are ignored.

Sparse education funding slights Hispanics 

By Paul A. Peralez 
Some weeks ago, citing a constitutional mandate for "efficient and equitable educa­tion", the Texas Supreme Court ruled that Texas' system of fi­nancing public education is un­constitutional. This was a great tribulation after years of fiscal and moral depravity that de­nied tens of thousands of Texas children, mostly Mexican­American, the opportunity for a first-rate education. In Texas, as in many other states, educa­tion is largely financed by the individual school districts which depend primarily on property taxes for their rev­enue. What this means for chil­dren who live in property-poor school districts is an education vastly inferior to that of their wealthy counterparts. 
Discouraged by a high crime rate and lingering prejudices, businesses do not locate in pre­dominantly Hispanic areas to provide jobs and a substantial tax base for our schools. We are often alienated from a soci­ety which doesn't seem to care if we fail yet which constantly berates us for doing so. Our society must decry ignorance ­without degrading the ignorant. 
In my native San Antonio, where the Hispanic population predominates, the high-school drop out rate for our Mexican­American youth is an alarming sixty percent. Contrary to what some cynical and hateful people believe, it is not because we Chicano youth are lazy or inca­pable. It is often because we are poor, and we must work to sustain ourselves and our families. For years, Mexicans have been characterized as lazy and indolent and thus incapable of learning. 
This characterization has no basis; we Mexicans perform some of the most back-break­ing toil in this nation. In the oppressive heat of the sun, we build the roads that crisscross the Southwestern United States, and we pick up the trash on the sides of these 
roads. We build houses and 
skyscrapers, and we labor in 
fields. If we can do these 
things, we most certainly can 
sit in the shaded comfort of the 
classroom and learn. 
Often, however, the classroom is abysmally inadequate. As I travel the city I call home, I am dismayed by the striking contrast between the wealthy and the poor schools. Obsolete textbooks, aggravated and often insensitive teachers, school buildings in egregious disrepair -this is the bane with which many of our Hispanic and poor youth must contend and which systematically disen­franchises them from our na­tion's economic and political systems. This is a problem which must be addressed by Texas and by the nation. 

Lauro Cavazos, the United States Secretary of Education, has adopted the George Bush strategy: all talk and no action. Dr. Cavazos, a Mexican­American and a Texan, has ne­glected to serve the interests of Mexican-American youth ­whose plight he is particularly familiar with -and has elected to serve the interests of the Bush administration by calling for a decrease in funding for what is an already underfunded federal education budget. This is unfortunate for all our na­tion's youth. 
This nation has sent hundreds of thousands of our Hispanic men to fight in defense of freedom. Mexican-Americans have received more Congressional Medals of Honor than any other ethnic group in the nation. Yet we ourselves are denied several significant free­doms which, I believe, emanate from one: free-dom from igno­rance. While we must maintain a strong defense with sophisti­cated weaponry and well­equipped soldiery, our greatest defense rests with competent teachers and well-equipped schools. 
The crisis in education, I be­lieve, results from a philosophy which has been espoused by the last and the present Republican administrations -one which is entirely out of touch with real­ity. This philosophy consists of the idea that the present gener­ation of leaders -those that are well-educated, wealthy, and white -will produce the next generation of leaders, -and those people who comprised the working class will produce the next generation of working class. George Bush and his inane predecessor's call for a capital gains tax cut is a per­fect example of their belief that the wealthy and the powerful can assume a paternalistic role and single-handedly solve our nation's economic crisis. 
The strength of our nation rests just as much on the people in the barrio as it does on the people in the boardroom. The President doesn't realize or doesn't care that our nation's future labor force will be ill­equipped to assume a role in an increasingly complex economy. Quite literally, there are not enough white Americans to as­sume all the occupations that will sustain our nation's eco­nomic strength. Since 1980, the Hispanic population has in­creased 118%, far exceeding that of any other group, and we will have a crucial role in this nation's economic and political future. 
Hispanic -Americans are aware of the role they will play and wish this role to be positive and productive. We are aware of our rights and obligations as citizens of the greatest nation in the world. This is why Hispanics spurred a suit to change Texas' educational fi­nance system; and we prevailed, for, as former Senator Joseph Montoya of New Mexico stated, "today's society can no longer afford the shameful luxury of barring any road to advance­ment to such a significant group of Americans."

Penn State is located in State College, in central Pennsylvania, 70 miles northwest of the state capital Harrisburg. The drive to State College should be ap­proximately nine hours. Nine hours is a long time, but the hills and forests of central Pennsylvania will be a refresh­ing change from the flatlands of Indiana. Once the roadtripping domers arrive on campus, the main objective will be Beaver Stadium. Beaver Stadium is just north of the central campus on Curtin and Fox Hollow Hoad. 
Like most state colleges, Penn State offers a college town at­mosphere complete with a Fra­ternity How and a main drag where the fast food restaurants are located. After the game, students can choose from a number of fast food restaurants on College Avenue.

Notre Dame defeated Southern Methodist 59-6 Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium, as the Irish found a passing game and the Mustangs found they weren't quite ready to fact the No.1 team in the nation. 
The Good on Saturday was Notre Dame. The Bad was SMU. The Ugly was not only the final score, but the Irish efforts to keep themselves in check and not embarrass the Mustangs by scoring even more. 
That the Irish took four delay of game penalties to keep themselves from scoring was obvious enough, but Husty Setzer's run out of bounds when he had a clear shot at the endzone made Notre Dame's intentions all too clear. 
"I wanted to score and I could have," Setzer said. "Coach (Lou) Holtz told us that we could run up and down the field but he didn't want us to score. He told me he was proud of me for doing what I did. I will be here two more years and I will have many more oppor­tunities to score."

It's a virtue 
Brown patiently waits for his chance to shine 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Assoc1ate Sports Ed1tor 

Derek Brown has heard the question so many times this season that he has the routine down pat. 
"I always get a lot of, 'How come you don't get the ball more,' " said the Notre Dame tight end. "It's not really any big deal. It just wasn't my number that time. I'm sure my day's going to come." 
Brown ranks second on the team in receiving with 11 catches for 185 yards, including a 100­yard day in receptions against Purdue. Those statistics would appear impressive enough for the normal tight end. 
But Brown, the 1987 Parade High School Player of the Year, is not exactly your normal tight end. Your normal tight end doesn't open up a Sports Illustrated in September and find himself listed on a projected 1995 All-Pro team. 
Thus, Brown hears the questions from fans wondering why the ball is not thrown his way more often. For Brown, it's all a matter of hav­ing patience and keeping priorities in order. 
"I have nothing to complain about. We're winning; we're 10-0," said Brown. "I just have to wait my turn. It's like the punt return and kickoff return team with (Raghib) Ismail and (Hicky) Watters. They're not going to run back for a touchdown every time. People won't even kick it to them every time, but they just have to stay patient." 
Brown knows all about patience. Coming from Merritt Island (Fla.) High School. he needed all 

kinds of strength to resist the temptations to Notre Dame tight end Derek Brown. stay instate for college football. Brown consid­Brown's younger twin sisters, ered Miami and the University of Florida before Henae and Jenae, read all the deciding on Notre Dame. literature that colleges sent to "There was all kinds of pressure," said the the household and recom­sophomore. "I think some of the pressure is mended Notre Dame to their what kept me away. I was tired of hearing peo­brother. Choosing between ple say, 'Who are you kidding? You're going Notre Dame and Miami, Brown to be a Gator.' " made his final decision while 
watching television one day. 
"I was sitting at home by my­self and watching 'Wake Up the Echoes,' "·said the 6-7, 235­
-pounder. "As weird as it may seem, I got a feeling about Notre Dame." 
He had that same feeling about the 1988 national championship team. Brown says that it did not take long before he realized that group would be something special. 
"I felt something was about to explode here, and I wanted to be a part of it," said Brown. "After the Michigan game, I felt we'd go all the way." 
That 19-17 season-opening win over Michigan led to a year that · included many potential spots for future releases of "Wake Up the Echoes." 
Brown earned a starting role midway through that year and caught 12 passes for 150 yards and three touchdowns. 
His top games came in the two biggest contests of the sea­son, making two catches for 46 yards against Miami and two catches for 70 yards in the Fi­esta Bowl win over West Vir­ginia. 
Brown is more satisfied with his play so far this season, and he is particularly happy with the strides he has made as a blocker. 
Derek Brown celebrates. "I feel very confident in my
Fila Photo 
blocking," said Brown. ''I'm much more aggressive, and very seldom do I make any mental errors." 
He also feels he has adjusted to the cold weather of South Bend and the pressures of ma­jor college football. 
"I considered 40 or 50 de­grees cold back home," said Brown. "Last year (the cold) would affect me, and I'd be wearing a lot of thermals, but we've had cold games here. 
"This is bigtime football," Brown continued, in reference to the Notre Dame program. "I was kind of used to this from high school, but at least there I had basketball and track also." 
Of course, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Although Brown earned· high school All-America honors at Merritt Island, he recalls only making about 35 catches his last two years there. 
Brown had to share the 
wealth there, as he played with 
seven other Division I players 
(three at Auburn, two each at 
Miami and Florida) on a team 
that lost only three games in 
his four years of play. 
Now Brown again has to wait 
his turn for the ball, but the 
Irish have posted a perfect 22-0 
record with him on the roster. 
It leaves Brown with no re­
grets about his college selec­
tion. 
"I look back at my decision, 
and Florida has all the troubles 
going on there and at Miami, 
(Jimmy) Johnson's gone," said 
Brown. "Here, I'm undefeated 
going on two years."

The Irish have rolled up a total of 100 points in the last two games. It does not figure to be so easy against Penn State, the top scoring defense in the nation. 
In nine games, the Nittany Lions have allowed a grand total of 83 points (9.3 points per game). Alabama's 17 points are the most anybody has scored against Penn State this year. 
One of the main reasons behind those impressive totals is linebacker Andre Collins. The Butkus Award finalist has 12 sacks and a team-leading 99 tackles.

Former Sooners convicted and sentenced in rape trial 
NORMAN, Okla. (AP) Former Oklahoma football players Nigel Clay and Bernard Hall were convicted Thursday night of first-degree rape. 
The jury was unable to reach a verdict for a third defendant, Glen Bell, and will continue de­liberations on his fate Friday morning. 
The jury assessed a 10-year sentence for Clay and Hall. 
All three were accused of raping an Oklahoma City woman on the night of Jan. 21 at the athletic dorm. 
After hearing two full days of testimony, the jury began delib­erations Thursday morning and reached its verdict on Clay and I!all about 11:10 p.m. 
There was no indication which way the jury -which voted 9-3 according to its foreman -was leaning on its deliberations for Bell, the only defendant who did not testify in his defense.

Leslie Biegler, the national champion in the 200-yard breaststroke, led Wisconsin to a #4 ranking in the NAIA last year. 
The Notre Dame women's team ( 4-1) is coming off last week's 149-151 loss to Bowling Green which was one of its best complete meets of the season. Four university records were set, including two by freshman star Tanya Williams in the 200­yard butterfly and the 400-yard individual medley. But Welsh noted that the Irish might have to break more records to beat Wisconsin and Northern Michigan. 
The men's team defeated Wisconsin last year, but is fac­ing Loyola for the first time in history. Loyola, formerly a na­tional water polo power, 

Several friends and family members of Clay and Hall cried when District Judge Preston Judge read the guilty verdicts, after about 11 1/2 hours of de­liberations. 
Hall, dressed in a rose-col­ored sports jacket, had a tear­ful embrace with his mother and father before he was hand­cuffed to Clay and led out of the courtroom. 
'Tm pleased with the jury's verdicts on the two defen­dants," District Attorney Tully McCoy said. "It was a very dif­ficult case. We presented the evidence to the jury and justice was done." 
A solemn-faced Bell, dressed in a gray suit, was hurried out of the courthouse after the ver­dicts. 
"I was shocked, to say the least," said Charles Cox, Bell's attorney. "It was obviously a disappointment to co-counsel and to their clients." 
scrapped its water polo pro­gram in favor of a swimming team. 
"As a new team, there will be some unexpected surprises for them, some good and some bad," Welsh said. 
The meet will begin at 5 pm on Saturday at Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
On the opposite end of the spectrum is Wisconsin, which placed fifth at the NAJA na­tional championships. Barry Kneevers is the defending champion in the 200 yard breaststroke. 
"The men's back to back meets is part of intense prepa­ration for the National Catholics," Welsh said. "One object of the weekend will be to see if by the end, everybody has gained meet experience in all the championship events." 
The men's team raised their record to 5-0 last week by de­feating Bowling Green. 
The Observer page 13 

"We will have to reduce the size of the roster for the National Catholics," Head Coach Tim Welsh said. "On pa­per, we appear to be faster than the teams, but there will be a good deal of racing among ourselves." 
Neither Notre Dame team is likely to take its opponents lightly, however. 
The women's team beat both of their opponents last year. but the swimmers have reason to be wary of this year's races. Wisconsin and Northern Michigan are two of the best coached teams in the country. according to Welsh. 
Wisconsin is coached by Dave Enzler, last year's NAIA coach of the year, while Northern Michigan swims under the tute­lage of Ann James, the 1988 NCAA Division II coach of the year. 
Hesburgh heads panel for reforming athletics 
AKRON, Ohio (AP) Nineteen leaders in the field of higher education, government, sports and business were named Thursday by the Knight Foundation to its commission working for reforms in inter­collegiate athletics. 
The foundation announced earlier that the panel would be directed by the Rev. Theodore 
M. Hesburgh, president emeri­tus of the University of Notre Dame, and William Friday, president emetitus of the University of North Carolina. 
Hesburgh and Friday said they would recommend that c:ommission members seek the advice of conference commis­sioners. athletic directors, coaches and faculty members on the issue of intercollegiate sports reforms. 
Donald Keough, the president of Coca-Cola Co. and the head of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees, was one of the mem­bers named to the commission. 
Creed Black, former chair­man and publisher of the Lexington Herald-Leader and currently the foundation's president, will serve as an ex­officio member of the commis­sion. 
"The Knight Foundation is gratified that such an outstanding group has agreed to join Father Hesburgh and Dr. Friday in this important undertaking," Black said in a statement.

Snow transplants Vikes 
Associated Press 
The Minnesota Vikings, 
long a symbol of man's triumph 
over the elements, have been 
run out of town by a little 
snow. 
The Vikings, who for years 
considered frigid weather and a 
frozen field the perfect combi­
nation to ice an NFL opponent 
on a given Sunday, went to 
Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday to 
prepare for the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
This, after an inch of snow ­
an inch! -fell Wednesday ac­
companied by a forecast for the 
Twin Cities of temperatures in 
the teens with wind-chill fac­
tors near zero for the next two 
days. 

Where have you gone Bill 
Brown? 
Nowhere. But the former 
Vikings fullback isn't about to 
call the current crop of purple­
clad warriors sissies for flee­
ing. 

"We went down to Tulsa (Okla.) a few times," he said by telephone from his suburban Minneapolis home. "You can't practice if they can't clear the snow off the field." 
But Brown added a word of caution, noting that Charlotte isn't all that far from Atlanta. 
"It isn't supposed to be cold in Atlanta, Georgia, is it? It was 1973 and we were playing a Monday night game," he said when asked about the most chilling experience of his 13 NFL seasons. "It was about 27 or 28 degrees and raining. I ruined two toes, maybe three. My feet had to turn a couple of shades to get back to normal." 
Maybe the Vikings should have stayed at home to prepare for Philadelphia. 
The forecast for Friday in Charlotte is a chilly 40 degrees, more Viking-like than Carolina weather -perhaps an omen as Minnesota (7-3) tries to hold its one-game lead in the NFC Central. The Eagles (6-4) al­ready have been told by Coach Buddy Ryan that they "must" win if they hope to keep the (8­
2) New York Giants in sight in the NFC East. 
The Giants entertain the Seattle Seahawks. Elsewhere, it will be Buffalo at New England, Detroit at Cincinnati, Kansas City at Cleveland, Miami at Dallas, New Orleans at Atlanta, San Diego at Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay at Chicago, Phoenix at the Los Angeles Rams, the Los Angeles Raiders at Houston, Green Bay at San Francisco and the New York Jets at Indianapolis. Denver is at Washington on Monday night. 
The Giants, whose loss Sunday to Los Angeles broke a four-game winning streak, may get tight end Mark Bavaro and linebacker Steve DeOssie back from injuries. The Seahawks are changing quarterbacks, re­placing Dave Kreig with Kelly Stouffer. 
A knee injury may prevent Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski from playing against San Francisco. Majkowski, leading the NFL in several passing categories, has missed practice because of a hyperextended right knee suf­fered in Sunday's loss to Detroit. 
If Majkowski doesn't play, the Packers (5-5) will have to choose between rookie third­round draft pick Anthony Dilweg and veteran Blair Kiel. 
Although three-time Pro Bowl receiver Al Toon and comple­mentary deep threat Wesley Walker are expected to play to­gether this season for the first time at Indianapolis, Jets coach Joe Walton says there are no guarantees. 
''I'm very guarded in my op­timism for that to happen," said Walton, who has tried to put together a passing attack without Toon for five games and Walker for seven. 
Meanwhile, Cardinals coach Gene Stallings said Pro Bowl offensive tackle Luis Sharpe and defensive tackle Bob Clasby could be ready to play against the Rams. Clasby has been on injured reserve since tearing ligaments in his left knee Oct. 1 against San Diego, while Sharpe sprained his right knee two weeks against the Giants.

Tarpley suspended for DWI arrest 
Associated Press 
Dallas Mavericks forward Hoy Tarpley was suspended in­definitely Thursday by coun­selors in his after-care pro­gram, one day after he was ar­rested on charges of driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. 
In a telephone hookup from the ASAP Family Treatment Center in Van Nuys, Calif., Dr. David Lewis told a news con­ference that Tarpley would be suspended without pay "until we can sort everything out." 
Tarpley, who twice has been treated for drug and alcohol abuse, was arrested shortly be­fore 11 p.m. Wednesday on a north Dallas freeway after offi­cers spotted him driving his car too close to another vehicle. He also pulled away from a woman police officer who tried to ar­rest him, officer Frank Ruspoli said. 
"It is clear that alcohol was 
involved and that is in non­
compliance with his after­
care," Lewis said. "Roy will be 
suspended until he is fully in 
compliance with his personal 
after-care program. He must 
understand the gravity of this 
kind of incident and how alco­
hol contributes to it." 
Under NBA regulations, the

counselors at an after-care program can order a player suspended if he violates the agreements of the program. 
Tarpley, who did not attend the afternoon news conference, has not commented on the Wednesday night incident. He practiced with the Mavericks Thursday morning, then talked with Lewis. 
A positive test for alcohol would be a violation of Tarpley's after-care program but not necessarily the "third strike" that would result in a lifetime suspension from the NBA with an opportunity to apply for reinstatement after two years. 
But Lewis said if a blood test taken after the arrest turns up cocaine, Tarpley would be sus­pended from life. Test results may not be available for up to two weeks, Dallas police said. 
Asked if he advised Tarpley to tell his side of the story. Lewis said, "I don't have any advice for Roy in that regard. I hope he will spend time and energy on himself and his after-care." 
Owner Donald Carter said that Tarpley wouldn't be wel­come around the Mavericks' fa­cilities any time soon. 
"We won't have any relation­ship with him," Carter said. "We won't pick him up. We won't give him food. We will have nothing to do with him un­til the time he is sent back to us to play basketball." 
Mavericks coach John MacLeod said, "We want him to be sober and comply and we don't even want him around for any of our meetings." 
Earlier, Carter indicated that Tarpley's days with the Mavericks might be numbered. 
"You are innocent until you are proven guilty but I don't have a whole lot of hope," Carter said. "I am embarrassed and frustrated. Have you ever wanted to haul off and hit your head against a wall?" 
Carter said the organization's hands were tied in dealing with the chemical dependency aspect but not on the charge of resist­ing arrest. 
"That (the resisting arrest charge) is not what this city wants," Carter said. "We are responsible to this city for our actions. You can take the name Roy Tarpley off of it there be­cause I'd feel the same way about anybody in the organiza­tion. He has to be accountable for his actions. " 
Dallas Police Sgt. J.N. Grissom said patrol officers Laura Campbell and Paul Keough clocked Tarpley driving 70-80 mph on the LBJ Freeway.

Both teams have steadily risen from the depths of their division to the upper crust, with a combined record of 9-1 thus far this season.

Indiana has the reciprocal record of the /\ggies at 15-11 and are lnd by junior Diane lloereth's team-high 375 kills and sophomore Nancy Mason's 302 kills. 
Thn Hoosiers' freshman snt­ter has been a catalyst for many of these kills, providing her teammates with 973 as­sists, while adding 225 digs, and senior middle blocker Julie Goedde has established herself as a force at the net, recording 89 total blocks. 
The host Broncos are 16-9 thus far primarily because of elder statesman Joanne Bingham, who has 450 kills and 42 aces to her name. Bingham's partner in crime, sophomore setter Jan Cottrell, has 1,054 assists. 
Two young players-sopho­more Julie Young and freshman Kim Len-lead the Broncos with 228 digs and 71 total blocks, respectively.

Defensive back Ryan Hobert agrees, saying "We're trying to cut the hype and play as a unit. We just want to play old-fashioned football, come together as a team and do our job."

Swim teams

set to dive in 
BY MARY GARINO 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame swimmers have two challenges to face this weekend: their opponents and each other. 
The men's swimming team fac1~s a tough test this weekend as it travels to Milwaukee on Friday to take on the University of Wisconsin and returns home Saturday for a meet with Midwestern Collegiate Conference rival Loyola. 
The wormm's team will com­
pete against both Wisconsin 
and Northern Michigan on 
Friday night at Milwaukee. 
When the teams dive into the pool this weekend, they won't just be competing against their opponents. The swimmers will be challenging each other. 
The meets are the last races 
for the Irish before the 
National Catholic Meet next 
month, and each Irish swimmer 
will be vying for a spot on the 
roster for the National 
Catholics.
