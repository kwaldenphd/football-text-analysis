USS Iowa returns to port 
Associated Press 
NORFOLK, Va.-Relatives and friends of the 1,600 crew-­men of the USS Iowa, the bat­tleship scarred by a blast that killed 47 sailors, gathered Sun­day at the Norfolk Naval Base to await the ship's arrival. 
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said. 
Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen. 
"We have lost 47 of our num­ber in a tragic way," said Cmdr. John Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station. "Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death." 
A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the al­tar. 
Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine "put po­litical differences aside and unite the human family as one." 
On Monday morning, Presi­dent Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people. 
The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend. None of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown. 
The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret. 
But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged. 

Hayes speaks at SMC dinner 
CATHY FLYNN 
Staff Reporter 
Actress Helen Hayes was the guest presenter at the lOth an­niversary Madaleva Society dinner Saturday night. The din­ner recognized the most generous donors to Saint Mary's. 
"I really do feel as if I've come home," said Hayes. The 88-year-old actress visited Saint Mary's several times be­tween 1934 and 1961, when her friend Sister Madaleva Wolff was president. 
Hayes was cited by coordin­ator Becky Drury as the most likely choice as a speaker for the dinner because of her close relationship with Sister Madaleva. The Madaleva Soci­ety, which V{as named in her honor, has raised over 4 million dollars since its inception in 1979, according to William Hickey, president of Saint Mary's. 
"I loved the friendship we had," Hayes said of her rela­tionship with Madaleva. "We had such a giggly companion­ship and a serious one too." 
Madaleva invited Hayes to the campus for the first time in 1955, for the laying of the cor­nerstone in Moreau Hall fine arts complex. Hayes said that she was awed and frightened by Madaleva's reputation as an intellect and poet. 
"Since these are the first words that an actress has delivered from this platform," said Hayes, christening the partially-completed O'Laughlin Auditorium, "I hope they may find their way into some of the cornices and rest there." 
O'Laughlin was to be a place where plays could be polished before they went to the bigger theaters, said Dennis Andres, director of Conference and Events at Saint Mary's. Madaleva invited many fa­mous people during her tenure. 
"I had been promoting greater support for university theater when I was on the Coun­cil of the Arts under Kennedy,'' Hayes said. "I said we should support the university theater instead of the Theater of the Absurd and it has saved the 
American theater to a great ex­tent." 
An honorary doctor of law degree was awarded to Hayes in 1956. That was the day she became part of the Saint Mary's family, she said. Ac­ting in Thornton Wilder's, "The Skin of Our Teeth" in 1960, she spent two weeks on campus. In 1985, she endowed a $50,000 scholarship fund in Madaleva's name. 
"I wish I were here as a freshman with four lovely years ahead of me," ·said Hayes. "May the vision of Sister Madaleva continue into eternity.'' 
Winning her first Oscar in 1931 for her role in "The Sin of Madame Claudet,'' Hayes went on to win a second time in 1971 for a supporting role in "Air­port." She was the first actress ever to win both a best actress and best supporting actress Os­car. 
Other noted films of Hayes's include "Arrowsmith," "A Farewell to Arms," and"Anas­tasia." Her television work in-

Students call for reform in China 
Protest has violent episodes 
Associated Press 
BEIJING-Students ·on Sunday paraded on cam­puses, made speeches on street corners and began or­ganizing a nationwide boycott of classes to press 

their  demands  for  demo­ 
cratic reform.  
The  protests  in  Beijing  

were organized and gener­ally peaceful, but marches turned violent Saturday in Xian and Changsa. Rampag­ing mobs looted stores, burned cars and seized a government building. Scores were reported hurt. 
The unrest was perhaps the most violent since demonstrations began April 15, when the death of refor­mist leader Hu Yaobang stirred anti-government sentiments and an organized protest campaign by univer­sity students. 
Protest leaders said stu­dents at Beijing universities planned to join a class boycott beginning Monday and to contact schools nationwide to persuade them to join. 
They said the boycott was a peaceful, legal attempt to force communist authorities to meet with them and dis­cuss demands for a free press, an end to official cor­ruption and other reforms.

Many students also called for Premier Li Peng's resig­nation and hung posters on campus mocking him. 
The official Xinhua News Agency said Monday's People's Daily newspaper contained a commentary that warned: "Social tur­moil can only do good to an extremely small number of people with ulterior mo­tives!' 
About 150,000 people joined Saturday in one of the biggest protests in Commu­nist China's 40-year history, holding a 15-hour rally at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Authorities allowed the protest to unfold, but stu­dents alleged Sunday that police beat several and in­jured one seriously. 
Worse violence was re­ported Saturday in Xian and Changsha. The state-run Xinhua News Agency said rioters in Xian, a popular tourist city and capital of northwestern China's Shaanxi province, forced their way into the provincial government compound and burned buildings and vehicles. 
It said 130 security officers were injured and 18 people were arrested. Xinhua said the melee began after stu­dents who had been mourn­ing Hu left the scene.

A 10-year-old boy was buried waist7high in more than 2,000 pounds of bricks when a chimney collapsed, but police say the child was not seriously injured and was in stable condition Sun­day. Joseph Stanley Williams was playing in an empty lot near his home when the chimney, all that was left of a house formerly on the lot, collapsed Saturday, said Clayton County police Lt. George Pinson. It took rescue workers about 20 minutes to free the boy. He was taken by helicopter to Scottish Rite Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition with a fractured thighbone. Pinson said Joseph and another boy apparently were beating on the chimney with sticks when it collapsed. 
Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan brought a fiery close to the Mrican American Summit '89 in New Orleans on Sunday, accusing government leaders of formulating secret policies to perpetuate poverty and drug abuse among blacks. Summit chairman Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind., who organized a similar gathering in his home city in 1972, defended the invitation to the controversial Farrakhan. Citing statistics showing declines in white births, Farrakhan said pow­erful whites want to destroy the black community to keep from losing power in the next century. Farrakhan called poverty a subtle form of genocide and said highly addictive crack cocaine may have been introduced in low income areas by people who wanted black youths to "sell death to each other."

More than 11 ,000 men and women were incarcerated in Indiana prisons in 1988, an increase of 5.3 percent over the pre­vious year, the Justice Department reported on Sunday. Nation­ally, a record 627,402 men and women were held in federal and state prisons at the end of last year, an increase of 7.4 percent over 1987. Indiana's prison population at the end of 1988 totaled 11,406, compared with 10,827 at the end of 1987. But prison con­struction has not kept pace with the inmate population, the report found, with overall prison capacity increasing by just 5.5 percent in 1988.

Information compiled from Observer wires and Observer staff reports 

Finals week is fast approaching ; we only we have more weeks until the descent into hell begins. Despite the grueling tortures of finals, there was always one glimmer of hope, sort of a calm before the storm: the midnight pancake breakfast. 
As most of you already know, the pancake breakfast is served on the Sunday night before finals. Alumni and other friends of the Univer­sity serve the food, and the students get to blow off a little steam before they get back to the books. It's a great time--probably the only time in the entire year that I enjoy going to the Dining Hall. 
Last semester, a lot of us were looking for­ward to what we thought was a Dining Hall tradition. We told all of the freshmen in our section how great the pancake breakfast was going to be until we realized that there wasn't going to be one that semester. Mysteriously, the pancake breakfast was taken off of the Dining Hall's menu. 
I don't know why the University Food Ser­vices decided against having the pancake breakfast last semester, and I don"t know whe­ther or not there will be a pancake breakfast this semester, but I do know one thing: we want it back. The pancake breakfast will be sorely missed if it's cancelled again. 
So with two more weeks until the eve of finals week, I've decided to make a pitch to youl" friend and mine, Mr. Bill Hickey, the Director of Food Services, to let him know just how much we want the pancake breakfast to return. 
Dear Mr. Hickey, 

I am writing you this letter as a formal re­quest to bring back the midnight breakfast on the Sunday before finals. If you've already decided to have the breakfast, ignore the rest of this letter. If you have decided against the breakfast or are currently undecided, please read on. 
I don't know why the breakfast was cancelled and I'm sure you had a very good reason to cancel it, so let's start with a clean slate and let me present my arguments for bringing back the breakfast this semester. I figure that you're a groovy guy and you'll take my request into

consideration. First, just think about all of those poor deprived freshmen who never got to ex­perience the excitement of the midnight pan­cake supper. And just think what a pleasant memory it would be for our graduating seniors. 
Also, the pancake breakfast is a real morale booster. After we eat our pancakes, we'll want to study some more, the more we study, the better our grades, the better our grades, the happier we are, the happier we are, the happier our parents are, the happier our parents are, the happier their co-workers, neighbors and relatives are. That's a lot of joy you're spread­ing with just one pancake breakfast. 
One more thing, if you let us have this pan­cake brea~fastwe promise to behave. We won't throw food after football games. We won't make fun of the meatless cheeseburgers. Instead of saying "Oh no, not again! " we will say, "Mmmm. Yummy. I love shells and sauce." Instead of saying, "What's That?!" we will say, "The cheese, brocoli and rice casserole looks particularly appetizing today." 
I hope you bring back the pancake breakfast. I think that everyone will have a good time and we will be eternally gratefully. The midnight pancake breakfast is truly a Notre Dame mo­ment. 
Sincerely, 
Robyn Simmons

The new fieldhouse mall con­cession stand is scheduled to stay open through the end of summer school said Larry Schaack, assistant manager of the Huddle. 
The booth opened on the af­ternoon of April 18 during the snowstorm and is managed by the Huddle under University Food Services. 
Foods such as hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, ice cream novelties and soda are sold at the booth and the prices are identical to those in the Huddle. 
The concession stand is open from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the weekdays. 
The idea for the booth began last summer during summer school when a hot dog cart was rather successful said Schaack. "The cart involved too much time to be set up and torn down each day," said Schaack, "We (the Huddle) wanted something more per­manent." 
Schaack said he did not know if the Huddle had plans to open the booth next fall and spring. "I'm sure we'll do something next spring if this proves suc­cessful,"said Schaack.

1987 plane crash is reinvestigated 
Associated Press 
DETROIT-The pilots in­volved in a deadly 1987 airliner crash, blamed in part on a warning system failure, may have intentionally discon­nected a similar alarm on an­other jet two days earlier, the plane's maker says. 
In a petition filed with the Na­tional Transportation Safety Board, Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas Corp., said the pilots pulled a warning system circuit breaker on the first plane, in­terrupting power to the system and silencing an unwanted warning, The Detroit News re­ported Sunday. 
The same pilots, John Maus and David Dodds, were in con­trol of Northwest Flight 255, a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, when it crashed on takeoff at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Aug. 16, 1987. 
The pilots died, along with 154 other people, including two people on the ground. The only survivor from the plane was a 4-year-old girl. It was the second worst aircraft accident in U.S. history behind the 1979 crash of an American Airlines jet near Chicago that killed 275 people. 
The NTSB concluded last May that the warning system on the MD-80 failed to alert the pilots that they hadn't set the wing flaps and slats, which pro­vide added lift for takeoff. 
The board faulted the pilots for not setting the flaps and slats and failing to complete a routine preflight checklist. The board also said power to the warning system was inter­rupted, but couldn't determine why. 
Flight records show Maus and Dodds landed that plane in Santa Ana, Calif., on Aug. 14, 1987, and the plane stayed on the ground until Hodges en­tered the cockpit the next day, Douglas' petition said.

WASHINGTON-The House ethics committee investigation of Speaker Jim Wright moves to San Antonio this week, where panel members will interview the Texas businessmen in­volved in an oil well investment that netted large profits for the blind trust held for the em­battled Democratic lawmaker. 
Two committee members and panel investigators repor­tedly will spend three days in Texas, beginning Monday, to interview San Antonio finan­cier Morris Jaffe; his business associate and son, Doug Jaffee, and two others involved in the oil well deal. 
At the same time, Wright's lawyer in Washington, William 
,_ 
Oldaker, is expected to con­tinue negotiations. with the et­hics committee's special out­side counsel, Richard Phelan, over a timetable for the speaker's personal appearance before the panel. 
The ethics panel-officially the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct-charged Wright with 69 instances of violating House rules in his dealings with Fort Worth developer George Mallick, and evading limits on outside in­come through bulk sales of a book authored by the speaker. 
Wright denies any wrongdo­ing and says he will fight the allegations. 
The first phase of its investi­gation finished, the panel now turns to considering whether there is clear and convincing proof of violations and, if so, deciding whether to recom­mend disciplinary action to the House. 

A spokesman for Wright, Mark Johnson, said no resolu­tion of the Washington negotia­tions is expected until later in the week. 
The Wright case continues to dominate interest on Capitol Hill, particularly on a week with little else on the agenda. 
The Senate remains out of session all week on an extended Passover break and the House does not return until Wednes­day when action is scheduled on a supplemental appropria­tion bill for ·the current fiscal year and the House banking panel continues work on its ver­sion of a measure to shore up the S&L industry. 
The ethics committee said Monday, in its report on Wright, that it was still inves­tigating how a Wright-Mallick company bought a 4 percent in­terest in an oil and gas well for $99,000-putting up only $9,120 in cash-and sold it the same day for $440,000. 
Phelan said the committee needed to determine whether Wright had knowledge of the

AR AND REMEMBRAN 

Talented cast contributes to ABC's continuation of W ouk's 'War and Ren1en1brance' 
 
T 
he mini-series to end all mini-series is back. Part two of ABC's blockbuster epic, "War and Remembrance," returns in May with more of the war, terror, and intrigue that captivated audiences in November. Herman Wouk's sensational novel, translated to the screen in all its grandeur and glory, will hopefully attract ratings as high as the book is long. 

JOE BUCOLO 
To Be Continued ... 
ABC will air the final eleven and a half hours of "War and Remembrance" beginning May 7. The series will continue on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week and will conclude on the follow­ing Sunday. ABC hopes this concise schedule will keep more viewers tuned in than the show's spread out schedule did in November. 
When viewers last saw the Henry family, it seemed a family in name only. Pug (Robert Mitchum) and his son, Byron (Hart Bochner), were fighting the war in the Pacific. The Battle of Midway brought tragedy to the Henrys as it took the life of Pug's other son, Warren. The tragedy fur­ther drove a wedge between Pug and his wife, Rhoda (Polly Bergen). As Pug grew closer to a young English­woman, Pamela Tudsbury (Victoria Tennant), Rhoda entered into a series of affairs. 
In the meantime, Byron's wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour), her uncle, Aaron Jastrow (John Gielgud), and her son, Louis, became trapped in 
Covering three and a half years of America's involvement in World War II and requiring five years to complete, "War and Remembrance" features one of the best casts ever assembled.

May's segment will follow Natalie and Aaron as they begin a horrible odyssey through Nazi camps. Byron s submarine undergoes some fierce sea battles, and Pug and Pamela face a decision about their marriage. Viewers will witness such historical milestones as Yalta, the assassination attempt on Hitler, the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, and the explosion of the first atomic bomb. 
Covering three and a half years of America's involvement in World War II and requiring five years to com­plete, "War and Remembrance" fea­tures one of the best casts ever as­sembled. Mitchum, Seymour, Bochner, Gielgud, and the Emmy A\Yard-nominee for her work in "Winds of War," Bergen, make up the cast of the epic's main charac­ters. Their incomparable talent adds realism and prestige to this historic piece of entertainment. 
In January, both Gielgud and Barry Bostwick won Golden Globe Awards for their performances in the first half of "War and Remembrance." The series won the best mini-series category at both the Golden Globe and People's Choice Award presenta­tions. In addition, the series received nominations for awards by the Direc­tors Guild of America, Writers Guild of America, and American Society of Cinematographers. 
"War and Remembrance" is sure to be 11 hours of suspense, intrigue, and adventure. Those who misseu November's installment may be inter­ested to know that that portion of the series is available on videotape. With the availability of the cassettes and the excitement surrounding the up­coming segment, ABC hopes that "War and Remembrance" will be remembered for years to come.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. Shaquille O'Neal scored 18 points and had 16 rebounds and Bobby Hurley had a game-record 10 assists as the West beat the East 112­103 Sunday in the McDonald's High School All­American game. 
O'Neal and Hurley, who scored 10 points, were named most valuable players in the game that fea­tured the 25 best high school players in the country. 
The West team featured two Indiana players. Greg Graham of Warren Central in Indianapolis scored five points and Indiana Mr. Bas­ketball Pat Graham of Floyd Central scored nine. 
Hurley broke a record of eight assists held by three players in the game, which features players selected by a coaching panel from a pool 1,500. 
The West took a 16-2 lead at the start of the game and never trailed. 
"Coach went with his five best guys and told us to go out and play hard," said O'Neal, a 6-foot-11 center from San Antonio who is headed to Louisiana State. 
"You just come out to have fun in a game like this. Usually I'm playing against guys who are 6-4 or 6-5, so it was good to come out and play against people my own size. I just went out and played my game." 
O'Neal--who once scored 27 points, got 36 rebounds and blocked 26 shots in one game--also blocked six shots in this game despite sitting out most of the first half with three fouls. 
"He's got a real big base," said Conrad McRae, who scored nine points for the East. "Guys who are that tall are usually a lot skinnier than that. 
"They came out and got that big lead on us and that was the game. I could tell by looking in the eyes of our guys that they weren't ready to play. It took them too long to realize they had to get in the game and play defense and rebound." 
O'Neal and Deryl Cunnin­gham each had two baskets as the West broke to its 16-2 lead by the 16:47 mark of the first half. 
The West built an 88-73 lead with 9: 33 to play on 3­point shots by Tracy Murray and James Robinson, and two straight 3-pointers by Allan Houston.

ND tennis cruises -­against Spartans 
By BOB MITCHELL 
Sports Writer 
At St. Edwards' Carnival on Sunday afternoon, superfrosh Dave DiLucia was the recipient of one whip cream pie after an­other in his face, many thrown by his fellow teammates. But on Saturday afternoon, the Notre Dame men's tennis team came together to down the a hapless Michigan State squad, 7-2. 
The victory over the Spar­tans improved the Irish record to a respectable 2-3 against Big Ten opponents this season. The 17-9 Irish squad overcame a va­riety of illnesses to take a 4-2 lead after the singles competi­tion, and solidified the win by sweeping the doubles competi­tion. 
"I have a very young bal­lclub," said Spartan head co­ach Stan Droubac who is in his 32nd and final campaign. "This year's Notre Dame squad has great depth. Their number one through number six players are just tremendous. I was very impressssed with their doubles. They are a well coached and a good ballclub." 
While the Michigan State co­ach was quick to give the Irish accolades, Notre Dame skip­per Bob Bayliss assessed the match in a somewhat more subdued manner. 
"We played a good match," said the second year head coa­ch. "Coming into the match we certaily had a better record, better schedule but you can take all those things and throw them out the window when you play a match. Last year it was the same situaion and they beat us." 
Indeed, the Irish knocked off esssentially the same Spartan team that beat Notre Dame 5-4 last year in East Lansing. Leading the way for the Irish was No. 1 Dave DiLucia and No. 3 Brian Kalbas. 
The No. 53 collegiately ranked DiLucia simply over­matched South American Damon Valentino in a battle of the No. 1 players, 6-2, 6-2. 

Dave Dilucia 

Senior team captain Brian Kalbas had a suprising easy time with Santiago Cash in straight sets, 6-4, 6-0. Cash downed Kalbas lasst year in straight sets. 
"Brian had a little extra in­centive today to finish early be­cause he was leaving for the senior formal right after the match," said Bayliss dismiss­ing the notion that coaching had anythhing to do with the win. "David's match was just a case of having too much." 
The Michigan State match marked the first home outdoor match of the year. And in the eyes of two Notre Dame players, they might have wished that the milestone had come later in the year. No. 2 Walter Dolhare suffered a two set loss to freshman Grant As­her, 6-1, 6-4. Dolhare was ham­pered by a flu throughout the week that undoubtedly affected the outcome of his match. The Argentinian was not able to play his usual No. 2 doubles spot. "It was pretty nasty out there today," said Bayliss. "It was uncomfortable and there was nothing to block the wind. It definitely hurt Ryan Wenger. For Walter to lose that match he was not 100 percent physi­cally." 
Next up for the Irish is pe­rennial Division III power Kalamazoo and Illinois State next Saturday on the Courtney Tennis Center. These two matches will mark the end of Notre Dame men's tennis 66th season of play.

Draft

people," said Seattle coach 
Chuck Knox. 
Moore coached Pro Bowlers 
Covert, May, Grimm and 
Fralic as an assistant at Pitt. 
Seattle originally wanted to choose a defensive end. That plan changed after San Diego took Pitt's Burt Grossman with the eighth pick and Chicago picked Trace Armstrong of Florida with the 12th selection. 
"We tried to get help at the defensive line and possibly make deals to move up in the draft, but we weren't able to do it," said Knox. 
Starns, another All-American last season, also was surprised about his selection. 
"I was thinking third round," said the 6-4, 257-pound defen­sive end. "It was a surprise to go in the second." 

Like Heck, Starns went to a team that had not spoken with him much before the draft.

"They tested me in the 40, but I hadn't seen the head co­ach or 'owner at all," said Starns. "I know they're a class organization, and I talked to tM head coach and owner and they're excited about having me." · 
Green was in for a different kind of surprise. The three­year Notre Dame starter had not received a phone call by 8 p.m., when the draft was sup­posed to adjourn for the day. 
"I was sitting here with my head down, and at 8: 15 the tele­phone rang," said Green. "I didn't think it would be any team because I thought it was over for the day. It was the director of player personnel for the Bears, and he told me, 'We're in the fifth round, and we're considering drafting you,' and at that point I hit the ceiling. 
"They put (Bears coach) Mike Ditka on the phone," con­tinued Green. "He was telling me they usually carry five run­ning backs, and they have four runnning backs right now."

"I feel comfortable at both places (tailback and ful­lback)," said Culver. "In high school I played a lot of fullback and tailback, so I'm pretty comfortable at both positions. I just want to play. Whatever I can do to help the team, I'll do." 
Spears gained an impressive 58 yards on 10 carries on Sat­urday, and Johnson compiled a hard-fought 47 yards on nine at­tempts. Rice and Belles con­tributed most of the Blue squad's remaining rushing yards. 
"I think Rodney Culver can play fullback or tailback," said Holtz. "Anthony Johson is the most underrated football player I've been around. lt'was really encouraging to watch Kenny Spears run. He's been coming on during the course of the spring." 
Ricky Watters, who returned to his natural tailback position this spring after spending last season at flanker, also showed up well in the game. The soph­omore picked up 27 yards on seven carries despite great penetration from the Blue de­fensive line. 
"I thought Ricky Watters ran as well as I've ever seen him run," said Holtz. "I always look at how well a guy does when he doesn't have an awful lot of blocking, and I thought Ricky Watters played well. 
"Ricky really had a great spring. Even my wife said to me, 'Boy, he runs different now than he did last fall'. I want to tell you, it's no great sight to be able to see the sun or no great feat of hearing to be able to hear thunder, but if my wife says Ricky Watters improved, then that's really something."

I think the depth is starting to come. 
"I feel much better about tailback now than I did prior to spring practice." 
Much of Holtz's enthusiasm can be contributed to the recent play of Culver, who wasted little time in making himself known to the 25,694 fans gath­ered for the annual spring clas­sic. 
Culver, who scored only three touchdowns all of last season, capped a 16-play, SO­yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown run on the first se­ries of the day for the Blue squad. On third-and-goal from the 10, Culver took a pitch from Belles and sprinted the dis­tance to give his team an early 6-0 lead. 
Culver gained 51 yards on nine carries in the first half, including his longest run of the day, an 11-yard scamper up the middle for a first down. 
He also scored on the Blue squad's first possession of the second half, powering through an enormous hole in the middle of the line to give his team an insurmountable 13-0 lead. Cul­ver put the finishing touches on a spectacular day with his third score nine minutes and 16 seconds into the fourth quarter. 
"The line blocked well on a lot of my big runs," said Cul­ver. "On the one going down towards Touchdown Jesus, there was a big hole there and I went in untouched." 
Culver is listed as a fullback on the Irish depth chart, but he has seen action from both back­field positions. With Braxton Banks still recovering from February arthroscopic sur­gery, Culver could very well be the glue that holds the Irish backfield together.

"With the Gold team, it was kind of hard because it was the first time I was playing with a lot of those places," said Rice, who went 3-of-11 passing for 34 yards and an interception and rushed for 48 yards on 11 carries. "It was prety good with the Blue team because that was most of the first team." 
Kent Graham's 41-yard touchdown pass to Ismail with

EXTRA POINTS: At halfime, Holtz handed out winners of Hering Awards for outstanding achievement in spring prac­tice.

success. Chris Zorich fumbled on his only carry, while George "Boo" Williams ran one time for two yards.

BOSTON --Cam Neely and Michael Thelven scored in a seven-second span late in the second period as the Boston Bruins avoided a playoff sweep with a 3-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens Sunday night. 
The Bruins, trying to become the third team in NHL history to win a series after losing the first three games, still trail the best-of-seven Adams Division final3-1. The Canadiens can ad­vance to the Wales Conference finals with a victory at home Tuesday night. 
Brian Hayward started in goal Sunday and Neely beat him to give Boston the lead with his seventh playoff goal at 
14:54 of the second period. It broke a 1-1 tie created by Randy Burridge's first-period goal and Russ Courtnall's un­assisted goal at 3:57 of the second. Each has five playoff goals. 
Neely jammed a five-foot shot between Hayward's pads after Andy Brickley's slap shot went behind the net and came out to Hayward's right.

Bob Sweeney tied up the faceoff after Neely's goal and the puck went to Keith Crowder at the blue line. Crowder passed it to the right point to Thelven, who had no one be­tween him and Hayward. He fired a 40-footer that hit the in­side of the left post and went into the net. 
Brian Skrudland's third playoff goal cut the lead to 3-2 just 12 seconds into the third period. He took a pass from Claude Lemieux on the left side and beat Andy Moog from 40 feet.. 


Flyers 4, Penguins 1 
PHILADELPHIA--Tim Kerr scored two power-play goals in a 2: 21 span of the second period and Philadelphia's defense checked Mario Lemieux and the Pittsburgh Penguins to a standstill Sunday night as the Flyers evened the Patrick Divi­sion finals at two wins each with a 4-1 victory. 
The series returns to Pit­tsburgh for Game 5, but the Penguins may be without Lemieux, the NHL's top scorer, who was helped off the ice early in the third period after a col-Cunneyworth. 
Kerr, who took over the playoff lead in goals with 10, broke a 1-1 tie at 6:57 when he deflected Gord Murphy's 55­foot slap shot past goaltender Tom Barrasso. Kerr then scored his eighth power-play goal of the playoffs at 9: 18, snapping Pelle Eklund's cen­tering pass behind Barrasso from 10 feet. It was Kerr's sixth goal of the series and the Flyers' seventh on the power play. 
Terry Carkner put the game away at 7: 13 of the third period with a shorthanded goal, ban­ging in a rebound after Bar­rasso stopped Dave Poulin's slap shot. 
The Penguins dominated the early going and went ahead just 3: 22 into the game when John Cullen beat goaltender Ron Hextall from between the circles with a wrist shot. But the Flyers took control after the midway point of the first period and tied the score at 
13:24 when Derrick Smith got his own rebound, circled the net and fed Poulin, who rammed the puck past Barrasso from five feet.

GREENSBORO, N.C. --Ken Green made good on his vow to atone for a playoff loss last year, using a final round 72 for a two-shot victory in the $1 mil­lion Greater Greensboro Open tournament Sunday. 
Green, in scoring the fifth victory of his career, finished with a 72-hole total of 277, 11­under par. Before Sunday, his best performance this year was

Culver runs for three touchdowns in Blue victory 

By FRANK PASTOR 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Notre Dame does not have a problem at the tailback position. 
Despite the graduation of three-year starter and tri-captain Mark Green, and the still­uncertain status of Tony Brooks, the Irish return plenty of rushers capable of posting num­bers similar to those of last season's highly­ranked backfield. 
One of those backs, freshman Rodney Culver, carried the ball14 times for 63 yards and three touchdowns Saturday to lead the Blue team to a 21-8 victory over the Gold squad in the Blue­Gold Game. He was named Offensive Most 
Valuable Player for the game. 
ND baseball drops three 

..... 
to MCC foe 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame baseball team suffered a disappointing weekend against MCC East rival Detroit at Coveleski Stadium, losing three out of four to a Detroit team which had not won two in a row since April4. 
The Irish (30-10) split the Sat­urday doubleheader, losing the first game 1-0 and winning the second game 7-2. On Sunday, the Irish were swept, losing the first game 6-3 and the second game 5-4. 
The two losses on Sunday marked the first time Notre Dame had lost two games in a row. 
Head Coach Pat Murphy, however, is not about to make any changes because of the weekend losses. 
"I'm not worried about our ballclub," said Murphy, "I mean, how can you be worried about a ballclub that's 30-10 that's beaten the teams we've beaten? I'm disappointed obvi­ously .because there were three 

Culver's big day highlighted a 237-yard per­formance by the Blue backfield, which also in­cluded freshman Kenny Spears and fullback Anthony Johnson, plus quarterbacks Steve Belles and Tony Rice. 
"I think we'll be all right at tailback," said Head Coach Lou Holtz, who in three years has seen the tailback position develop from one of the team's most glaring weaknesses into one of the top units in the nation. 
"We have a little bit more depth at tailback now," Holtz continued. "If you recall, we're here our first spring and we didn't even have a tailback. We stuck Mark Green back there and played Anthony Johnson there as well, but

Holtz discovers one answer, still searching for the other 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame football team solved one question and left another unanswered as the Blue team won the Blue-Gold Game 21-8 Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Freshman Rodney Culver earned offensive most valuable player honors with 63 yards and three touchdowns on 14 carries. The performances of Culver, Kenny Spears ( 10 carries for 58 yards) and the Gold's Ricky Watters (7-27) left Holtz happy with his tailback situation. 
"I feel good about tailback right now," said Holtz. "<Running backs coach) Jim Strong really is doing a great job with the backs. We're much better at tailback now than prior to spring." 
The same can't be said of the receiving corps. Notre Dame quarterbacks combined to complete just seven of 22 passes and throw four intercep­tions. Most of the interceptions came on deflected passes. 
"Our passing game is behind but not because of Tony (Rice)," said Holtz. "If there's one problem we've got, it's receiver. That's a severe prob­lem right now. 
"We have a problem at split end," Holtz continued. "I think (Pat) Eilers will be solid. We've got to be solid behind him. We have people with tal­ent who haven't progressed. How much progress they make over the summer is critical." 
Starting flanker Raghib "Rocket" Ismail and tight end Derek Brown led the Irish with two receptions each. George Poorman, who had two inter­ceptions as a Blue defensive back, was the only other player with more than one catch. 
The Blue team opened the scoring with an eight-minute, 80-yard touchdown drive in the opening posession. Culver took a pitch and darted 10 yards along the right side for the score. 
Culver, a freshman from Detroit, ran nine times for 51 yards in the first half. 
Steve Belles, who completed ' one of five passes for nine yards and an interception, di­rected a Blue scoring drive that included 14 rushes and just two passes. 
Rice quarterbacked the Gold in the first half, completing one of eight passes for 19 yards and an interception. 
The Blue team also scored on its first series of the second half, after it had taken its 7-0 lead into the intermission. With Belles again at quarterback, the Blue drove 68 yards on nine plays for the score. 
Culver ran two yards through a giant hole to extend the Blue's lead to 14-0. 
Spears, another freshman running back, saw most of the action out of the backfield in the second half. The Atlanta resident responded with three carries for 30 yards on the touchdown drive and a second­half total of seven carries for 46 yards. 
After Poorman intercepted a Kent Graham pass for the Gold team's second turnover, Rice switched to the Blue team and led a 13-minute touchdown drive. 
The Blue drove 80 yards on

Heck leads trio of Notre Dame picks 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
Andy Heck, whose stock among NFL scouts had grown as much as his size over the past several months, went to the Seattle Seahawks in the 15th overall pick at Sunday's NFL draft. 
Heck, who earned All­America honors at offensive tackle after moving from tight end last fall, becomes Notre Dame's 35th player to go in the first round of an NFL draft. 
"This is a dream come true to me," said the 6-7, 286-pound Heck. "To go this high is un­believable. I couldn't be hap­pier to go to an organization like the Seahawks." 
Other Notre Dame players to receive calls included defen­sive end Frank Starns, who went to the Los Angeles Rams in the second round, and tail­back Mark Green, who went to the Chicago Bears in the fifth round. 
· NFL teams go through the final seven rounds of the draft today. Probable Notre Dame selections include linebacker Wes Pritchett and strong safety George Streeter. 
Most scouting reports had projected Heck to go late in the first round or early in the second. His draft position rose to that level because he had gained 18 pounds since last month's NFL scouting com­bine. 
"At the combine he weighed 268 and now he's 286, so he's putting in the effort you like to see," said Mike Allman, Seattle's director of player per­sonnel, "and he hasn't reached his full maturity yet. He can play at 295 and still can move with the smaller defensive ends. 
"He's got really good feet and will be able to compete well with the pass rushers on the right side."
