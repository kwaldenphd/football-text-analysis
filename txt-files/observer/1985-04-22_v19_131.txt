44 youths killed in Philippine fire 
Associated Press 
MANILA, the Philippines -A rural audience fled in panic from a fire in a movie house complex in the sout­hern Philippines yesterday, and 44 people, most of them teen-agers, were killed in the stampede to get out, police said. 
Fifty-three people were injured. 
"Somebody shouted fire and all of a sudden there was confusion. 
People started rushing to the doors," saidJeanette Barja, 13, who was one of 20 people injured seriously enough to be hospitalized. She spoke in a telephone interview from a hospital at Tabaco, 200 miles sout­heast ofManila. 
Hundreds of people ran out, screaming and shoving each other, from a Sunday matinee featuring a favorite movie star. 
The theater complex is on the second floor of a three-story build· ing in the center of Tabaco. Barja was among fans, including mothers carrying babies, who packed the Cine Aracade's Cinema I to watch a movie titled 'Star Without a Glow.' 
Police said the fire actually was in adjacent Cinema II, which was al· most deserted. Two charred bodies were found there, indicating the rest of the deaths occurred as people fled, police said. 
Coca-Cola to alter secret formula 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -The 99-year-old, top-secret formula used to make Coca-Cola soon will be changed, accmding to a report published Saturday. 
The new formula was developed in a secret project launched in january, The Atlanta journal and The Atlanta Constitu­tion reported in their combined Saturday edition. 
The newspapers, which quoted n.o sources and said the company would not comment, said a possible reason for the new formula was a drop in Coke's market-leading share last year. 
Coca-Cola Co. spokesman Carlton Curtis declined com­ment except to say there would be a news conference tomorrow at which "the most significant soft drink marketing develop­ment in the company's nearly 100-year history will be an­nounced." 
The current formula, known as "Merchandise 7X," is frequently described as the best-kept secret in American industry. It was developed by Dr. John Pember­ton in 1886. 
The New York Times in Satur· day editions quoted an analyst who said tomorrow's news con­
ference  would  be .used  to  in·

fruit-based beverages.

FORSYTH, Mo. -Authorities Satur­day arrested a reputed member of a neo-Nazi group, ending an intense manhunt that began five days earlier with the slaying of a state trooper at a random traffic stop. 
David Tate, 22,linked to the neo· Nazi group called The Order and charged with first-degree murder in the trooper's death, was arrested 

.unarmed and without incident in a 
city park, said Capt. Lee Thompson 
of the Missouri Highway Patrol. 
Hundreds of police using camouflage, helicopters, dogs and road blocks had searched the rugged Ozark Mountains on both sides of the Arkansas-Missouri border since the trooper was killed and another wounded with a silencer-equipped automatic pistol on Monday. 
Tate was spotted at the edge of a city park by a resident, who then 

told  officers  manning  a  nearby  
roadblock,  said  Taney  County  
SheriffChuck Keithley.  

"Tate was ready to give up," Keithley said. "The man was getting hungry, he told us. He's been in the woods for several days without a whole lot to eat." 
Authorities found a weapon they think was used in the shootings -an Ingram MAC-10 automatic pistol ­about 20 to 30 feet from where Tate was arrested, said Keithley. 
Tate's arrest was announced before nearly I00 residents and reporters at the Taney County cour­thouse. The residents clapped and cheered when the arrest was an­nounced, and again when Taney County Circuit Judge james justus said that if Tate was convicted, he could face the death penalty. 
Forsyth is about 15 miles from Branson, where Trooper Jimmie Linegar was shot dead and Trooper Allen Hines wounded. 
Tate was arraigned Saturday night before Taney County Circuit Judge James Clifford Crouch on charges of first-degree murder in the slaying of Linegar and first-degree assault in the shooting of Hjnes. 
He was ordered held without bond on the murder charge, and bond was set at Sl million on the as­sault charge. A preliminary hearing was set for April 29, and Tate was taken by motorcade to the Greene CountyJail in Springfield. 
First-degree murder carries a penalty upon conviction ofdeath or life in prison without parole. 

SMC professor named to congressional panel 
By ELLYN MASTAKO 
StaffReporter 
Jerome McElroy, associate profes­sor of business and economics at Saint Mary's, has bee(l appointed to a congressional panel to study "Appropriate technologies to en­hance food, fishery, and fiber pro­duction in the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories of the United States." 
The panel is composed of 24 ex­perts from the United States, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Their specialties include marine bi­ology, anthropology, political sci· ence, and economics. 
"Our commission is a highly interdisciplinary because we want to get technologies that are integra­ted into political, social, and envi­ronmental systems," said McElroy. 
The panel was chosen by the Office of Technology Assessment, a 12-member bipartisan congres­sional board which provides con­gressional committees with objective ~nalysises of the difficult, and often highly technical issues of the late 20th century. 
The countries to be studied by the panel are Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Guam, and American Samoa. 
Despite the fact that the federal government is spending $2 billion annually to enhance the self­sufficiency of these islands, the food production of these islands con­tinues to decline. 
"It is in the best interests of the United States for our government to help these islands," said McElroy. "Anything that would strengthen these island economies would strengthen our security interests. We have major military installations on Puerto Rico and Guam." 
McElroy was chosen for this com­mission because of his ongoing re· search on the developmental problems ofsmall Caribbean islands, particularly small-scale agriculture and fisheries. 
McElroy has taught in the Virgin Islands for nine years, during which he became familiar with the eco­nomic problems of this U.S. terri­tory. He was also coordinator of socio:economic research at the Caribbean Research Institute for five years and was director of policy, planning, and research for the Virgin Islands' government for one year. 
The commission will begin its work by reviewing all the literature on the most successful and innovat­ive technologies with regard to small-scale agriculture and fisheries. They then will explore recent tech­nological developments and will make a list of those technologies which are found to be both economically profitable and en­vironmentally adaptable. Finally, the commission will suggest policy op­tions and programs to Congress in order to implement the panel's list ofacceptable technologies. 
The panel, meeting last March to scope out the project, assembled the

McDonald's Campus Airlift joins campus delivery menu 
Domino's delivers. 
So does Pizza Hut. 
And now, McDonald's does too. .. 

Yes, McDonald's is the newest competitor for your on-campus fast food dollars. A week ago today, Campus Airlift went _into full-scale operation, delivering Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets across the Notre Dame campus. 
At an isolated school such as Notre Dame where ma:ny students feel tied to campus, one would expect that such delivery services would be popular with stu­dents bored by Tofu vegetables. 
"Experienced" delivery services show this to be true. Wanda Binney, a manager for Domino's pizza said that during the school year, they do 80 percent oftheir busi­ness at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Pizza Hut ships 20 to 30 pizzas to campus each night, said manager Tom Uttleton. 
It seems there may be a market for hamburgers as well as pizza. 
"Right now, we're getting 



son, 
taxes and delivery costs. 
As ofnow, there is no min­imum order for delivery. The service will be in a test phase until the end of the year. "We want to determine what the students want," said Watson. 
Students may be anxious to have pizza and hamburger trucks pouring into campus, but Notre Dame doesn't always welcome these delivery services with open arms. 
"It took us three years to get it OK'd," said Binney, a manager at Domino's. She said it took Domino's longer to get permission to deliver at Notre Dame than at a:ny school in the country. "Notre Dame is the only school where we have to go tlllrough security to get on (campus)," she added. 
Uttieton, a Pizza Hut manager, said, "Notre Dame is very concerned about who's allowed (on campus) and who's not." 
There has been some confusion as to whether McDonald's actually has permission to deliver on campus. Watson, the restaura:nt's owner, said his

service has "the same kind of approval that anybody else does that delivers out tJilere." 
Watson said he has recei¥ed clearance from Security a:nd has assured Notre Da:me officials that his drivers are fully insured. He said the· nickname of his service. Campus Airlift, caused some to believe that someone other than McDonald's w~ organizing the delivery service. The service is rt~n out of McDonald's of Roseland. 
In an interview with an O~server reporter last week, 
J<?ni Neal, director of stu­
d~nt activies, said that a 
a good response," said Charles Watson, owner of the Roseland McDonald's store which runs the deliveries. A McDonald's manager said they receive about 40 orders a night. He said deliveries take an average of 40 to 45 minutes, although some take a little longer. 
Most items on the regular menu can be delivered, and prices are generally 20 to 30 cents higher than those in the store. According to Wat­
this increase covers "\)nified University policy may have to be set up con­q:rning businesses making deliveries on campus." 

It seems logical that the administration would want tQ) establish guidelines con­q:rning who may and who np.ay not deliver on campus. There are some businesses d/le University certainly would not allow to deliver tl> the dorms. For example, it iS doubtful that any en­t¢rprising businessman hpping to deliver alcohol to 
cilmpus would be en-
ci.mraged by the administra­
tipn. 

If they decide to dtablish such a policy, 
administrators should keep in mind that many students 
appreciate the convenience of on-campus delivery. 
Time constraints and lack oftransportation cause many 
students to rely on delivery l!ervices as a temporary link 
to the outside world. A rushed student can pick up a 
phone and have pizzas, flowers and even balloons 
brought to his or her dorm door. 
Extensive restrictions I concerning on-ca:mpus deliveries would be pointle*'. Ifenough students use a given service to make it profitable, and if the service does not violate University policy (such a'> alcohol deliveries), that service sho~ld be allowed to continue. If no one uses a service, it Vfill die a natural death and restrictions are therefore unhecessary. 
Regardless of what polic~. if any, the administation enacts, Campus Airlift will probably continue soaring at least until the end of this scllool year. And that means a Big Mac is just a phone call alWay.

PHILADELPHIA Children bearing placards with the names of jewish communities wiped out during World War II led thousands of people in a march yesterday as American survivors ofthe Holocaust remembered their dead. 
The march followed a memorial service that opened the Inaugural Assembly ofthe American Gathering 
\ of jewish Holocaust Survivors. About 5,000 people who withstood the horrors of Nazi concentration camps and their children were in Philadelphia for the three-day gat­hering. The marchers wore blue caps with "remember" written in Hebrew, and youths waved cardboard signs carrying the names of cities such as Rotterdam, Nitra,
f'!'!t Braila, Terni and Regensberg. 
~ 
i "They want to show that the youth are trying to understand what was lost," said Kay Ehrenkrantz, 25, a 
member of Young judea, a jewish youth group. 
The marchers sang and chanted Meet senior Paul Perona'sfriend Larry. The two were seen yes­prayers in Hebrew on the 13-block terday enjoying the fair weather and the Bookstore Basketball walk to Independence Mall. There,

Golda Draznin, from Buffalo, N.Y. said her carnation was "to remem­ber my father who got lost in the concentration camp. To pay my respect to him." 
"I am going to put my flower on my own grave," said Genia Klapholz, of Philadelphia. "I was in Auschwitz and I was sentenced to death," she said, her eyes red from tears. , After the ceremony, politicians and religious leaders spoke to the gathering. 
One spectator, Edzia-Frymet Milich ofBeverly Hills, Calif., wore a light blue sweatshirt with big letters that said, "Have you seen my sister Hena Milich?" 
Milich said her sister disappeared in 1946 in Poland. She showed the blue 55496 tatooed on her arm in Auschwitz, and said she survived five camps. 
A "survivor's village" was set up in the Philadelphia Civic Center, where victims of the Nazi camps could meet, eat kosher food and lis­ten to Yiddish music. Also at the center was a computer containing the names of 55,000 Holocaust sur­vivors"Iivin~ in the United States, to 

help people find those lost during  
World War II.  
The marchers first gathered at the  
Monument to the Six Million jewish  
Martyrs, a twisted, black stone  
sculpture that reaches to the sky  
with limbs protruding and hands  
with knives ready to strike.  
Some 6,000 people packed into  
one-block area, silent as speakers'  
voices bounced off walls of nearby  
office buildings.  
As the world commemorates  
World War II, "we think of our  
jewish world that was cut down,"  
said keynote speaker Vladka Meed,  
who fought in the jewish under­ 
ground in Warsaw, Poland.  
"As Hitler unleashed his sys­ 
tematic machine of murder," he  
waited for an outcry from the world,  
Meed said. But "the world paid at­ 
tention only to the military battle,  
not to the war against the jews."  
Marion Wilen, chairwoman of the  
Memorial Committee for the Six Mil­ 
lion jewish Martyrs, criticized Presi­ 
dent Reagan for his scheduled visit to a German military cemetery next month. "His presence will honor the per­petrators ofthat genocide," she said, as the audience hissed and booed.  , 1, 1 ~,

WASHINGTON -Thou:;ands of 
protesters marched oul!ide the 
White House on Saturday to start 
three days ofdemonstrations against 
President Reagan's military buildup 
and policies on South A1rica and 
Central America. 
Protesters massed on tho! Ellipse, 
the park outside the While House 
grounds, then swung up Pennsyl­
vania Avenue toward the Ctpitol for 
a rally. 
A.'i they passed the White House, 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson dropped to 
the pavement and uttered a prayer 
that referred to Reagan's planned 
visit next month to a military 
cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany. 
"Touch our president in some 
special way," the kneeling civil 
rights leader said. "Some place bet­
ween Bitburg and Johanne~burg, let 
him choose another way." 
The demonstration, marking the 
lOth anniversary of the end of the 
Vietnam War, was echoec on the 
West Coast, where 4,000 p::otesters 
marched in downtown Los Angeles 
and others rallied in Seattle.

protester in Los Angeles. 
U.S. park police estimated the size of the crowd in Washington at 26,000. March organizers claimed 100,000. 
District of Columbia pJlice Lt. William White said at late afternoon there were no arrests and termed it "a very peaceful demonstralion." 
About 100 counter-demonstrators assembled for an American Conservative Union rally near the Washington Monument and sang "America the Beautiful." 
Busloads of anti-Reagan demonstrators from around the na­tion waved banners and watched mimes and "street theatc:r" at a "Festival of Resistance" on the El­lipse that opened the "April Actions for Peace,Jobs andJustice."

FRANKFURT, West Germany ­World Jewish Congress leaders on Saturday assailed President Reagan's decision to visit a German military cemetery and said they would ask Chancellor Helmut Kohl to urge Reagan to cancel the visit. 
"We hope to see Kohl on Sunday. We shall appeal to him to urge Reagan to drop the Bitburg visit," said Israel Singer, secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress, speaking Saturday. 
A delegation of Congress leaders traveled yesterday to Bergen· Belsen, the site ofa Nazi death camp, and expected to meet Kohl before the chancellor spoke at a memorial ceremony there for the victims. 
Reagan, trying to appease criticism at home and abroad about the cemetery visit, said he also would visit a former concentration camp during his May 1-6 visit to West Germany. The U.S. and West German governments announced Friday that Kohl and Reagan will visit Bergen-Belsen together on May 5. 
At Bitburg, 47 bodies of. SS troopers are buried along with nearly 2,000 German soldiers, most ofwhom were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. Thousands ofAmerican soldie_rs also died in that battle.

"We hope to prevail on Kohl and to convince him that he and Reagan are making a mistake by visiting the Bitburg cemetery," Singer told The Associated Press."The problem has to be solved by Kohl. He could become the hero ofthe day," he said, and Reagan should "stay at home" until he's reassessed the subject. 
"The president has shown great 
misunderstanding of the issue. He 
needs a lesson on what happened in 
Nazi Germany," Singer added. 
He said his delegation would propose to Kohl that Reagan visit in­stead the grave of former West Ger­man chancellor Konrad Adenauer, a staunch anti-Nazi leader throughout World War II who served as chancel-· lor from 1949 through 1962. 
"We have the greatest respect for Adenauer and that would be real act 1

literature necessary to study exist· ing technologies. They also began to identify the most crucial problems

"My main concern is that we really understand why agriculture is in decline," said McElroy. "My second hope is that the technologies will be quite accessible to the farm­ers and the fishermen. That means small scale," he said, adding, "What good is high technology if it is beyond the capacity of the family farmer to operate and maintain?"

Reagan escapes the blame for his many errors 
Ronald Reagan is one of the more unique presidents in American histOf}. His unusual wit combined with his uncanny ability to overcome adversity has made J:.im one of the most popular and skillful presidents to date. 
Simply by laughing and jok,ng about the many blunders he has committc:d, Reagan can

make the public forgive and forget faster than you can say "Gipper." In additi<n, Reagan is a master at shifting the blame to help him escape out of many a political jam. 
These qualities have helped Reagan rise to almost unprecedented popularity no matter what he says or does. And it is Vlith this politi­cal charisma that the President has been able to get away with many a blunder no other politician would be allowed to live with, and

mishap without any visible scars. The public invariably forgets whatever blunder was com­mitted, no matter how serious. 
A classic example of a forgotten blunder is when while attempting to deft-nd his record 
Casey owes Pettifer an apology for his remarks 
DearEditor: 

I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to Ann Pettifer on behalf of Daniel Casey if he is not wiUing to do :>o. 
That he disagrees with the v.ay Pettifer per­ceives things is fine -and "The Observer is an appropriate forum in which to present that disagreement. When one resorts to personal attacks in order to defend a stance, however, then one has gone too far. 
Casey's letter does not in any way attempt to juggle the complexities of 1:he role of wo­men in the Church, an issue with which Pet­titer is frequently concernecl, and instead turns to sarcasm and di~;tortion in a "grandstanding" fashion in order to express his intense dislike for her views.

on social programs, Reagan blurted out that 
he had never cut Social Security, when in fact, 
it was one ofthe first programs to receive cuts 
during his first term in office. 
But even though this was clearly more than 
just forgetting the facts, the President 
managed to get out of the situation without 
suffering any consequences. The President 
has repeatedly managed to avoid any trouble 
from such false statements as these. 
But perhaps the best example of a serious, 
but now forgotten blunder, was when, not 
knowing he was on the air, the president 
casually said that we were going to bomb Rus­
sia. 
A statement like this can have tremendous 
political ramifications and is not something to 
be taken lightly. Yet he simply brushed it off 
by joking about it and complaining that the 
press picked on him too much. This tactic 
struck a note in the public's heart and the inci­
dent was forgo_tten. 
Reagan's political charisma has also allowed 
him to implement contradictory foreign and 
domestic policies without having them really 
challenged by anyone. 
In the foreign realm, Reagan advocates aid to help the contras, a political party in Nicaragua which uses guerilla tactics in an at­tempt to overthrow the legitimately estab­lished government of Nicaragua. Reagan's reasoning is that the present government of

Pettifer may be right to question the Church 
DearEditor: 
The least Daniel Casey can do for Ann Pet­titer is publish an apology and a retraction to his pointless editorial ofApril 16. 
I wonder how the Caseys of the world can really doubt Pettifer's words. What evidence do they have? And why respond with such ab­surd chauvinistic slander? 
Perhaps they fear that Pettifer just may be right. Has our loving Holy Father,john Paul II, opened his arms to the women ofthe Church? Unfortunately, no. Even the Vatical II Council fell pitifully short of treating women with even a shred of decency. Surprised? It seems the superiors of the world's larger female reli-

it doesn't adhere to many democratic prin­ciples.· 
Yet Reagan supports the government ofthe Philipines, which is a blatant dictatorship void of many democratic principles which we hold to be self-evident. For instance, the Philippine government does not allow free elections or freedom ofthe press which are two very basic democratic principles in the minds of most Americans. 
Domestically, Reagan's contradictory policies can be observed right now during the budget talks. Reagan has said that federal spending must be sharply cut, and that every­one must lend a helping hand. Yet in his first proposed budget, he made a major cut in al­most every area except defense, which took a very measly one. 
Reagan is also an expert at shifting the blame in order to make someone else looklike the bad guy. For instance, he has constantly said that he will never raise taxes to balance the budget. Yet Reagan knows as well as anyone that that is what will eventually have to happen to help balance the budget. 
By saying he will never raise taxes, Reagan has put Congress in a position where they have to do it, and therefore they wiU look like the bad guys. This type ofskillful campaigning has let him escape embarrassment and blame many a time when it has finally seemed that he made a lasting mistake. 
This inconsistency has enabled Reagan to run roughshod over our political system. He 
gious orders were not even invited to partici­pate in the deliberations of the council. Also, at the council's official liturgies, these women had to remain on the outskirts of the congre­gation, which was quite a distance in a 2,000­plus congregation. 
These women were then forbidden to receive the Eucharist. Ifthey attempted to do so, they were forcefully turned back in the aisles. This is extremt;ly interesting behavior coming from a council that would write, "For it is through the liturgy, especially the divine Eucharistic Sacrifice, the 'the work of our redemption is exercised' " (Sacrosanctum Concilium). 
Given incidences like this, one can at least understand the mentality of such a narrow­minded Church hierarchy when it attempts to confront problems such as birth control. 
just as the Church refuses to deal with wo­men, it refuses to deal with birth control. 
Pretending to know the issue a priori, the Pope issues a naive "No," pretending the problem will vanish. 
Perhaps, after all, teenagers and young adults really \\ill learn to ignore their sexual desires. 
Garry Trudeau 
simply advocates or implements any policy he 
wishes and when it happens to be one that the 
public does not agree with, he always 
manages to shift the blame and avoids accoun­
tability for his decisions. 
This ability has given Reagan a tremendous 
advantage over the American public. By not 
being accountable, he can implement 
whatever policies he fancies, even if they are 
not supported by the people. He has already 
begun by proposing many undeserved cuts in 
social programs, continued high military 
spending for MX missiles and "Star Wars," and 
even renewed aid to the contras. 
The American pe~ple and Congress must be on their toes at all times. We all must make sure that our president does not implement policies that we do agree with, like cuts in education and social programs. Congress has the ability to check the president, but that won't matter if we do not play our part and write our congressmen expressing our view­point. 
Ifwe all do a little something, maybe we <.an 

keep Reagan from making a shambles of our 
country and economy in his last term. If we 
continue to let him push us around, the conse­
quences to our society and future administra­
tions could be devastating.

What happens unfortunately, as Pettifer wrote, is that "... pregnant adolescent girls, residually affected by teachings on chastity, believe that sex without birth control reduces its sinfulness." 
One would be tremendously understating the problem to say llie Church handled this problem without tact. The Church has yet to handle the problem ofbirth control. 
As long as the Church is cursed with popes convinced a priori they are infallible on all issues yet to arise, the popes of the Church will continue to err. 
As long as the Church is cursed with pontifs in the spirit of men like Gregory XVI ( 1831­1846, famous for his condemnation of the in­vention of the steam engine), who condemn instead of confront the issues of the world today, it will never really understand why wo­men like Pettifer can so accurately find the Church's faults. 
And it is hoped that people like Pettifer will still be around pointing out faults so accurate and obvious.

Rock 'n' roll is alive and (mostly) well 
Irish, English artists shine, American singer bores 
Legend returns to rock with soul 
Keith Harrison Jr. 


Record review 
A 
little more than a year ago, Warner Bros. Records chose not to extend the contract ofrock legend Van Morrison, a move as unimaginable as the Cincinnati Reds dropping Pete Rose. But now Morrison is back, with a new record company and a powerful new record titled· A Sense ofWonder. 
For those who don't know, Van Morrison is the voice behind the 1966 rock classic "Gloria," which he sang as the leader ofthe Irish rhythm and blues band Them. After leaving Them, Morrison's early solo work continued in the same raucous vein, although a soul influ­ence soon appeared and led to such hits as "Brown Eyed Girl." 
In recent years, however, Mor­
rison's records have been more 
subdued, as he deepened the soul­
fulness ofhis work and even delved into jazz fusion. The mellow Van Morrison never sold very well, however, which led to the abrupt contract termination at Warner Bros. 
But Polygram Records gave Mor­rison another chance, and he has responded with a record which successfully blends the rough­edged r&b of his early years with his more serene recent work. 
. The R&B Morrison opens the album, starting with the single "Tore Down ALa Rimbaud." Trum­pets and gospel backup vocalists punctuate each line ofthe chorus, and Morrison's singing is reminis­cent ofhis most soulful work. Not only is it a great song, but it's even getting airplay in South Bend. 
His recent problems with record companies and album sales obvi­ously led Morrison to cover Mose Allison's "IfYou Only Knew." The 
music is bluesy, and the words 
follow suit: 
Ifyou only knew what could hap­
pento 
a manfor telling the truth. 
Ifyou only knew all the scruples 
that go down in gin and vennouth. 
I wouldn't want to steer you wrong 
but ifyou want to sing your own 
song 
You're gonna have to lose a few 
Ifyou only knew. 
There are a few flaws on A Sense ofWonder. In a few spots, for in­stance, the mysticism borders on silliness. Also, Morrison includes the in­strumental, "Boffyflow: and Spike," which is the weak point ofthe album. Morrison's voice is almost always the highlight ofhis albums, so why include any instrumentals in the first place? 
But these are minor flaws. Songs like the beautifully hypnotic "Ancient ofDays" are much more representative ofA Sense of Wonder. Morrison has been making brilliant albums like this for twenty years. It's about time someone started listening.

This leftover rock not fit for dogs 
JohnMenneU 
Record review 

I 
t is fitting that the copyright of Manin Briley's new album, Dan­gerous Moments, is owned by Miserable Melodies. 
The album is filled with them. 
The sticker on the jacket that lists "sure" hits warns us that the album contains "Dangerous Moments." The only danger involved is in dying ofboredom while listening to this album. 
The first side is one monotonous and laborious love song which is broken up only by five different titles; things fare no better on the flip-side. The title cut, "Dangerous Moments," has the power and thrust ofa spent rocket booster drifting through space, a feeling that dominates the album. 
Mo~ of the songs share the same beat, and demonstrate just how little variety one man's voice can have. Briley's nasal vocals can only be described as unattractive and dull; the only way to vary the sound is to change the speed on the turntable. None ofthe songs could be described as up-beat or down­beat; they are all middle-of-the-road and insipid. The point here is that the songs aren't even horrible or offensive (a Ia Spinal Tap); they are as bland as lukewarm water. 
The one song that stands out because of its humorous content is "School for Dogs." The chorus tells the tale: 
You may be man's best friend Butifyou're badI'm gonna send you To theschoolfordogs 
The song is the story ofa pet whose loyalty Briley questions. It is noticeably different from the start, as the back-up vocals are done by a contingent of the Mormon Taberna­cle Canine Choir. 
The whole album is an unam­bitious effort. Briley seems either scared to experiment and explore with different sounds -or he is just unimaginative. It is generally shal­low, uninspiring and comparable to listening to the Emergency Broad­cast System Test; it's definitely not worth the price of an album today, and is probably not worth the vinyl it was pressed on.

Murcer ends pro career 
Langer edges Wadkins in Heritage 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Bobby Murcer, who ended his major league career with the New York Yankees nearly two years ago, decided yesterday that his fling as a designated hitter in the Florida State League had gone far enough. 
"I had fun," said the 38-year-old former outfielder after his three­game stint with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees in the Triple A league. He had one hit in 12 at-bats. 
Murcer's main purpose was to supervise the rehabilitation of Yankees base stealing whiz Rickey Henderson, who has been playing for Fort Lauderdale as he recovered from a badly sprained left ankle suffered in an spring training exhibition game. 
Both Henderson and Murcer will fly to New York today. 
"I'm ready to play," said Henderson, who was acquired from the Oakland A's in the offseason. He walked three times and stole two bases yesterd<J ·

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. Masters champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany beat hopeful Bobby Wadkins on the first playoff hole and scored his second con­secutive victory yesterday, this one in the prestigious Sea Pines Heritage Classic. 
Langer, who last week became the first German to win any of golfs major titles, needed only a two-putt par on the first extra hole to turn back Wadkirts, who was seeking his first American victory in an II-year career that has been played in the shadow ofhis brother, Lanny. 
Langer and Wadkins each finished the regulation 72 holes over the pic­

Langer played the final 18 holes in 70 and Wadkins got around without a bogey and posted a 68. 
That sent them back to the 16th, a dogleg par-4, with the title and a $72,000 first prize at stake. 
Both drove the fairway. Wadkins, however, put his second shot into the right bunker. Langer reached the front of the green. 
Wadkins blew his bunker shot some I2 feet short of the cup. Langer, using his cross-handed put­ting style, left a birdie putt on the lip of the cup, and tapped in for par. Wadkins missed on the right and Langer was a winner again, the first man since Gary Player in 1978 to fol­low the Masters with a victory the

Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse rode their way to victory over Toe Jamb, QueefJuice and Three Other Tasty Treats on Stepan 1 at 3:00. Mark Kennedy rode highest in the saddle for the Apocalypse, hitting 9­of-18 in the 21-I9 victory. Sam Dowell led the Treats with 7-of-23. 
With a scoring attack more balanced than the team's name sug­gests, The Fastest White Guy on Campus and Four Orange Pylons ran 

. over Ragin' Ray's CPA's, 21-I8, on Stepan 2 at 3:45. John Murphy was the most productive Pylon, with 6­of-9, while Carey Purcell led the ac­countants with 1 0-of-20. 
Demented Doormats were not walked on or driven over by Four Rink Rats and a Zamboni Driver on Stepan 3 at 5: I5. The Mats pulled out a 2I-I8 victory on the strength of Rick Wirth's 9-of-18 shooting. Hamil Cupero was the leader of the pack, with 6-of-14 for the Rats. 
Four Delinquents and Our Lawyer were sorry to find themselves sur­rounded by Mixed Company on Stepan 3 at 4:30. Randy Golob led Mixed Company to the 2I-I8 vic­tory with his 9-of-20 effort. Greg Wittrock was the "worst" of the Delinquents, with 6-of-14. 
Ghostbuster Bill Murray could sympathize with Sven and the Flac­cid Four, as they got slimed on Lyons II at 5: I5. Slime needed only 43 shots in the 21-18 victory, as Mike Allen went 7-of-9, Paul Brennan hit 5-of-11 and Tom Hartzell was 5-oC:

One can only hope that the players for Prepare to Meet Your Maker followed their own advice yesterday on Stepan 5 at 3:45, when they were buried by Flankin' Idiots, 2I-18. Pete White (5-of-9) and Francis Sverdrup ( 5-of-I 5) led Meet Your Maker, but Idiots Dave Palmer (8-of-20) and Larry Lemanski (7-of­I7) sent their opponents to Heavan (or wherever). 
Of course, not all of the third­round games were that close, and not all of the seeded teams had a lot of difficulty winning. Favored Rous­seau's Noble Savages finished off Badfinger... The Finale, 2I-5, at 2: I5 on Stepan 4. Brian Behmer led the savages with 7-of-I 0 shooting, while teammate Tom Arndorfer was a per­fect 5-of-5. Mike Dipaolo (3-0f-I4) had the baddest finger for the 5-of­32losers. The Savages hit 21-of-31 as a team. 
Tequila White Lightning lost the services of Tod Tamberg to illness, but the team was up against Five Guys Worse Than Tim Kempton at 
2: I5 on Lyons I2. Lightning struck more than once on the fans ofNotre Dame's redhead center, as TWL hit 2I-of-34 en route to a 2I-8 victory. 
Armed and Dangerous III had the arms to make bacon out of Pigsters on Stepan 5 at 4:30. Dave Taiclet's 6-of-14 led Aand D's balanced 21-of­4 2 attack, while the porkers also had a balanced "attack:" four players with one point and one with two points, as the team went 6-of-25.

Boxer owes much to family 
Ed Kelly works hard for his goals 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
Most everyone would probably agree that hard work pays off. Notre Dame junior Ed Kelly certainly would. 
Kelly, a 5-4, 139-pound Grace Hall resident recently captured d1e Na­tional Collegiate Boxing AssociatiJn tide in the 139-pound class by defeating Rodney Smith fwm Westpointe. The championship competition held at Westches:er University in Westchester, Pa. A{ril 
12-13 proved to Kelly that without a doubt, nothing is out of reach if}OU want it badly enough. 
"I worked harder for this than anything in my life," said the spunky Worcester, Mass. native. "To win this championship made it clear in my eyes that there is no substitute for hard work. It proved what I h:1ve always thought: hard work is the Jcey to success, and I'll never forget that." 
After watchin~ his future cham­pionship bout opponent score a knockout victory in his opening fight, Kelly quickly learned that win­ning the title would not be an easy task. 
"I realized that he was stronger than I was, so I would have to try to outthink him," said the mechanical engineering major. "He was five inches taller, but I found out that his pattern was very predictable. "He relied a lot on flurries of hooks and seldom did anything different. I tried to use a lot of side-to-side move­ments and counter-punching to combat his strength. By staying low, I also made it hard for him to con­nect like he wanted to." 
Kelly survived two second-round knockdowns en route to the 3-2 decision that earned him his title. Kelly maintains that moving, staying loose and being quick were his three keys to winning. 

After winning three fights to take the championship in the 145-pound class at the Bengal Bouts, Kelly worked to secure funds in order to take part in the Midwest Regional competition in Charleston, S.C., March 15-I6. There, he defeated fighters from Xavier and the Air Force Academy to earn the right to represent the Midwest at the na­tional championship. 
After training since September, Kelly's hard work has enabled him to raise his collegiate boxing record to 11-0; but through all of his success he finds it very important to thank all the other people that helped to make everything possible. 
"I owe a lot to my coach Sean McCormick and his family, the guys at the Michiana Boxing School, my friends here at school," adds Kelly, "and most ofall my family. They sup­ported me in every way imaginable. There are also numerous others who I can't even begin to mention, but without their help and support, my effort would never have been pos­sible." 

Westhoev~~n defends six-mile title 

ByJOHN MENNELL 
Sports Writer 
It was a better day to watch someone run six miles than to do it yourself. 
That didn't stop Jeff Westhoven from defending his men's under­graduate title in Saturday's ll'ish Spring Runs. Westhoven finished second overall to Paul Matousal; in the six-mile race in 85-degree weat­her. Matousak, also winner of the men's graduate division, complc: ted 
Steak 
continuedfrom page 12 
for the back-up spot. And Von Wyl 
and Chura both showed trteir 
capabilities on Saturday -Von Wyl 
booting a 52-yarder, and Chura nar­
rowly missing from the same dis­
tance. 
Von Wyl also made a strong cJ aim 

for the starting punter position as he 
nailed a 60-yard kick. Both he and 
sophomore Dan Sorenson 
impressed observers with their 40­
yard~-per-kick averages. 
For Faust, these positive re:;ults 

from the special teams were an espe­
cially welcome sight considering 
that even the long-snapper and 
holder positions are being manned 
by new personnel. 
"We were very pleased with the 

kicking game," said Faust. "That was 
one big thing today. We wanted to 
see the punters, kickers, and snap­
pers under pressure. 
"We've got new snappers 

(sophomore Tom Freeman and 
walk-on John Grieb), new holders, 
and new kickers. Von Wyl, Sorenson, 
and Chura all did a very good job." 
Perhaps the most encour~.ging 

aspect ofthe scrimmage was the: fact 
that there was only one injury: a 
mild knee injury to split enc. Pat 
Cusack which will keep the junior 
out of action for the remaindo:r of 
the spring. Offensive guard Tim 
Scannell and linebacker Tony Fur­
janie also were pulled from the 
scrimmage early, although thi~ was 
merely a precautionary move by a 
concerned Faust, who did not want 
to risk another injury to either of 
those two recuperating players. 
Next Saturday's Blue-Gold/Steak 

and Beans scrimmage, meanwhile, 
will be the culmination of all the 
hard work of the spring seasor1. 'Al­
though many of the proj:<:ted 
starters for the fall wlll not be in uni­
form, Faust promises another hard­
hitting scrimmage. 
"It will be a heck ofa scrimmage," 

says Faust. "The players have a lot of 
pride on the line." 
A well-played Blue-Gold game 

next Saturday would be a real feast 
for any Irish football fan. 
the course in 32:08. Westhoven finished in 32:25, seconds ahead of third place finisher John Raven. 
Colleen Donnelly won the under­graduate women's division with a time of 44:07. Mary Ambrose, who finished 50th out ofthe 139 racers in the six-mile, won the women's graduate division. 
Guy Locksmith found the key to victory over the 57 other runners in the three-mile race on Saturday. His time of 16:25 earned him a the un­dergraduate division tide. Two ot­her undergraduates filled out the top three positions overall. David Hipp finished second and Peter Simms third.
