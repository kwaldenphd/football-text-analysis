. National Rice Month, Food History Month to be celebrated 
ByJOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
From the mountain bike rest­ing in the corner of the entrance to the brightly colored display promoting National Rice Month to the sounds of Creed complementing a meal, North Dining Hall has been awash with new ideas. 
"The dining hall is not only about eating, but also about entertaining," said John Glon, North Dining Hall manager and previous general manager of the food service support facility on campus. "We want to make this a hang-out place for stu­dents." 
One such way to keep stu­dents entertained has been through various food-related contests and promotions. Glon and his staff have been busy offering educational and nutri­tional information related to rice in September to honor National Hice Month. Other rice-related endeavors include a cooking class led by Executive Chef Denis Ellis on preparing difl'erent rice combi­nations, and a contest in which students guess the amount of rice in a jar. The person who comes closest to the actual amount will receive a CD play­er. 
"We want to give information to the students that they may be able to use later in life. Our goal is to help impart knowl­edge while also making it entertaining and fun," Glon said. 
Eighty students participated in the Rice Hace held this week, another addition to National Rice Month activities. The par­ticipants ran from North Dining Hall to South Dining Hall, picked up a secret item, then returned to North Dining Hall. The person or team that com­pleted the race closest to the

Bishop, Foley demand Smith's resignation 
By MEGHANN£ DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
Erik Smith, former Student Union Secretary, was persuaded to resign Sunday night after serving at the post for the past five months. 
"It caught me completely off guard," said Smith. 
Pat Hallahan, chief of staff, informed Smith that there were problems with the minutes that he records and asked him to resign at an impromptu meeting late Sunday night, said Smith. 
Before resigning, Smith asked to meet with Libby Bishop, stu­dent body president, and Trip Foley, student body vice president. Hallahan 

informed him Bishop and Foley were not available Sunday night or Monday. Hallahan could not be· reached for comment Thursday night. 
Foley said that this should not have come as a shock to Smith. 
"We had had talks throughout the year and we had decided that this was the best decision," Foley said. 
No formal memos were given to Smith concerning his job performance, Smith said. 
Smith's job as secretary was to record the minutes for Student Senate, Campus Life Council and Executive Cabinet. Foley and Smith had discussed the format, font style and length of the minutes pre­viously, Smith said. 
The former secretary said those changes were made as requested and was under the impression that the minutes were acceptable. Following the Sept. 12 Senate meeting Bishop told him they were 
what she was looking for, Smith said. "They never told me they worried about my ability to do the job," said Smith. 
Smith mPt with Foley and Hallahan Monday before the CLC meeting. Bishop was not in attendance due to a doctor's appointment, Smith said. 
"I went in thinking we could sit down, work things out and reconcile our difference," Smith said. 
He said he was informed that if he did not resign actions would be taken to remove him, regardless of his approval by the Senate. 
Foley denied that Smith was given the ultimatum of either leaving on his own terms or being removed. "We [Bishop, Smith and I] came to a con­sensus," said Foley. 
At Tuesday's Senate Oversight Committee meeting, senators were informed that Smith would likely be

Speaker addresses SMC's Catholic identity 
. Symposium identifies Catholic aspects of College campus 
By SARAH NESTOR Saint Mary's News Editor 
Many Catholics follow the doctrine and beliefs of the Church but often do not reflect or question why the doctrine is taught and followed, Monika Hellwig told the Saint Mary's community Thursday. 
College students, f acuity and administration gathered on campus for the "Catholic Identity Symposium," led by Hellwig, executive director for the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. 
The purpose of the discus­sion was to delve into those issues affecting Catholic col­leges and how they particular­ly affect the identity of Saint Mary's. 
"This is a very significant topic for Saint Mary's College, our Catholic identity and how it affects our campus," College President Marilou Eldred said. 
Prior to Hellwig's lecture, attendees viewed a video pre­sentation of students and fac­ulty sharing their thoughts on Catholicism at the College. 
"What is so interesting about the comments is that they were all grateful for what they have found at Saint Mary's, but not analytical or inquisi­tive of what they have found," said Hellwig.

play. I think that it is a good idea and that many people will pre­fer it," said sophomore Eric Wooldridge. 
Food selection and variety have also become a priority. An increase in healthy choices, 
soy milk, are now 
native on the menu every day. Greater selections of fresh fruits, grilled vegetables, fish and grilled or roasted meats have added healthy variety to the dining hall menu. 
Glon said that many of the changes students have been seeing came from student com­ments. Comment cards and verbal suggestions are taken very seriously by the dining hall staff, which works together with hall rectors, the Student

Keg theft 
Keg stealing is the latest college sport to hit off-campus living since the invention of playing cups on the back porch. And believe us, as unwilling participants we should know.

stand marathons. 
Employing the biggest, badest, guy you know to be your "keg bouncer" and of course this means free beer for him all night long (we are now accepting applications). 
Rent a guard dog, preferably one big and mean but still cute enough to interest the opposite sex, to pro­tect the keg. 
Or you could get a decoy keg of Natty Light, because who really wants to drink that anyway. 
Always stay in the vicinity of your keg, no matter how tempting it is to wonder to the party twenty houses away. 
If need arises to go on the defense here are some tried and true methods for the recovery of the keg: 
Send your quickest friends to run after the keg thieves. 
Make sure you take off any cum­bersome shoes and fly after the keg (high highs all not the most con­ducive shoes when such a situation occurs). 
And this we know from experi­ence, "PUT DOWN THAT 40, it makes you a lot lighter and agile." 
Remember to cover your own house because you don't need the thieves coming back in and taking advantage of the remainder of your partying supplies or anything else for that matter. 
Most importantly do not let this ruin your night, because there's always the 'Backer waiting for you. 
When hosting a party remember that it is always about having fun but sometimes there are unfortu­nate incidents that occur, such as having your keg stolen. In the end it is about the memories you make and you'll always have a story to tell the grandkids. 
Heck, your license plate could be stolen next weekend but fight the social hierarchy and have a good time. And by the way has anyone seen an extra tap hanging about.

said Hellwig. 
While Hellwig generalizes Catholics into two categories, she explained that no one fits perfectly into either group. 
"There is polarity in the Church, not between bad and good guys, but between Catholics in the Church," said Hellwig. "There are people who greatly fear we will lose the core teachings, and still believe in the Church before the sec­ond Vatican council. Then there are people who have gone deeper into Scripture and read the historical context."

pie affect Catholic identity because there are varying opin­ions on the correct way to operate as a Catholic college. 
'Tm not coming here with a magic potion, because it is something we have to struggle through," said Hellwig. "We have to take responsibility but there is not an easy answer." 
Hellwig divided the aspects that affect Catholic identity on campus into two categories, one being the quality of life on campus. into which she includ­ed the interrogation between study, socialization and prayer. 
"What distinguishes Catholic institutions from secular col­leges is the interrogation of prayer," she said. "There is a concern for everyone on cam­pus, from the president to the janitor, because we are all formed in the image of God." 
The second category, the educational and intellectual quality of the campus, relates to the curriculum construction. educational goals, understand­ing of community dimensions and the importance of stimulat­ing the imagination. 
"A critical aspect of Catholic identity of colleges is that we not think of the future as what position we will have or how much money we will make, but to see the future not in terms of a career but as a vocation," said Hellwig.

Bush looks for authority from Congress 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
President Bush asked Congress Thursday for authority to "use all means," including military force if necessary, to disarm and overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein if he does not quickly meet United Nations demands that he aban­don all weapons of mass destruction. 
At the U.N., Iraqi President Saddam Hussein delivered a defiant written message taunting the United States while claiming that Iraq has no chemical, bio­logical or nuclear weapons and saying he welcomed inspections to prove it. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell said that Saddam's latest state­ment itself represented a back­ing away from his earlier promise to grant weapons inspectors unfettered access. 
The proposal Bush sent to Capitol Hill would give him broad war-making authority. "If you want to keep the peace, you've got to have the authoriza­tion to use force," he told reporters in the Oval Office. 
The president worked to build support for a vote by Congress before lawmakers go home to campaign for the Nov. 5 elec­tions, and legislative leaders said the vote could come in two weeks. Bush's proposed resolu­tion says Iraq has repeatedly violated U .N. resolutions and international law by possessing chemical and biological weapons, seeking nuclear weapons, repressing the Iraqi people and consorting with ter­rorists. 
Although Democratic leaders predicted quick approval of a resolution on Iraq, they said they might want to make changes. 
uwe don't want to be a rubber stamp, but we do want to be helpful and supportive," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. "Congress has a role here, and we'll assert that role whenever it is necessary or appropriate." 
Some Senate Democrats, who met behind closed doors Thursday evening to discuss Iraq, assailed Bush's proposal. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said the measure was "incredibly broad" and unacceptable. 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he would like the resolution to specify that Bush needs a U.N. resolution backing the use of force. "Going alone has some very significant risks," Levin said. 
Republicans disagreed. 
"One veto in the U.N. Security Council shouldn't obstruct us doing what we have to do," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. 

President George W. Bush Insisted Thursday that military force must be used If Iraqi president Saddam Hussein does not relanqulsh all weapons of mass destruction. 
GOP leaders praised Bush's October. It reads: "The president is proposal. 'Tm perfectly happy As drafted, Bush's resolution authorized to use all means that with the language," said Senate would authorize him to use force he determines to be appropriate, Minority Leader Trent Lott, R­unilaterally if he deemed neces­including force, in order to Miss.

U.N. weapons inspectors gear up for return to Baghdad 
Associated Press 
VIENNA 
U.N. weapons inspectors gearing up for a return mission to Iraq will have to overcome daunting obstacles to shed light on Saddam Hussein's nuclear pro­gram, the chief nuclear arm inspector said Thursday. 
Four years after they were pulled out of Baghdad, the International Atomic Energy Agency's core team of 18 nuclear inspectors will rely heavily on new sleuthing technology if they're deployed to uncover evidence Saddam may have concealed, head inspector Jacques Baute told reporters. 
Although the nuclear inspectors have been in and out of Iraq since 1991, enduring sandstorms, scorpions and subterfuge, the stakes have never been higher: Their findings could stoke or undermine the U.S. effort to galvanize global support for an invasion. 
"We're like policemen trying to find one murderer among millions of peo­ple," Baute conceded. "The probability seems quite low. The group of inspectors is small, while the country is quite big." 
"But if you use the right techniques, the chances become quite good," he added. "A nuclear program needs a 
large infrastructure. That's something that benefits us." 
The Vienna-based IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, put its team on alert after Iraq's surprise announce­ment this week that it would accept the inspectors' return. 
The agency says the team could leave as soon as the U.N. Security Council clears the mission and visa and travel arrangements are nailed down. 
In New York, Hans Blix. the chief U.N. weapons inspector. told the Security Council Thursday that if all goes well at talks scheduled with the Iraqis in Vienna for Sept. 30, he could have an advance team on the ground by Oct. 15 and that some early inspections could be con­ducted soon afterward. 
With council approval, Blix later told reporters, "will go there with a small advance team as soon as possible. We will select some sites that we think are interesting to go to in the early phases, so it's not like it takes two months before we can send any guys out there in the field. It will be much earlier than that." Blix said. 
Blix had recently said his inspectors would need several weeks from the time they arrived in Baghdad until monitor­ing could actually begin.

Hurricane Isidore Heads Toward Cuba: 
Hurricane Isidore gathered strength and moved slowly Thursday toward Cuba's western tip and its small Isle of Youth, prompting the government to board up schools and move tens of thousands of people to safer areas. Isidore, the second Atlantic hurricane of the 2002 season, was expected to drench Cuba's western half through the weekend, with a possible 2 feet of rain. 
Greenspan to be knighted by Queen: 
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan will receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II next week, Buckingham Palace said Thursday. Greenspan, who has helped steer the U.S. economy for 15 years, will be honored for his con­tribution to global economic stability. Because he is not a British citizen, Greenspan cannot use "Sir" in front of his name, but he can put the letters KBE after his name.

Experts warn on food supply threat: 
A year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States remains vulnerable to bioterrorism aimed at farms that produce the nation's food, a panel of scientists said in a report released Thursday. "It's not a mat­ter of 'if.' It's a matter of 'when,"' said R. James Cook, a committee member from Washington State University. "While there may be a very low proba­bility now, what about in 20 years?" 
West Nile kills 23rd adult in Illinois: 
The death toll from West Nile virus in Illinois climbed to 23 Thursday in what is by far the worst outbreak in the nation since the disease was first detected in the United States in 1999. The Illinois Health Department announced anoth­er death and 33 new human cases of the virus, bringing the state's total to 457. The most recent death was that of a 73-year-old woman from Chicago. She died Tuesday. 
Doctor accused of molesting 2 people: 
A doctor who once headed the Presidential Advisory Council on AIDS and HIV has been accused by state regulators of sexually molesting two patients at his office. Dr. R. Scott Hitt, an AIDS specialist and gay activist, said he touched one patient inappropriately in August 2000 and crossed a boundary with anoth­er patient one month earlier, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California. 
Detroit Hit With Syphilis Epidemic: Detroit has been hit with the biggest outbreak of syphilis in the nationan epidemic that has led to a shake-up in the state Health Department. Health offi­cials said the reason for the crisis is that city and state officials became lax in their battle against the disease after a drop-off in cases during the 1990s. Detroit had 245 new cases of syphilis this year as of July 30, and the number is likely to reach 500 by year's end.

resigning and were asked to review the process for impeachment as stated in the constitution, should he not resign, 
said Rick Harris, a senator f r o m Siegfried Hall. 
" W e didn't have t h e 

s t r a i g h t Smith word," said Fisher Hall Senator Neil Vargas. "Trip asked us to go over that to see that we had the same interpretation of the constitution... 
Article IV. Section 1, No. 4 of the constitution states that any official appointed and approved by the Senate is subject to removal for miscon­duct of office following a two­thirds vote by the Senate. 
Harris said that it was con­fusing at Tuesday's meeting as to what the misconduct pertained to. 
"Eric did a good job while he was secretary and in my opinion there has been no evidence presented to me that would constitute a removable or impeachable offense," said Harris. 
Smith met with Bishop on Wednesday to submit his let­ter of resignation. During the meeting, Bishop suggested that he rephrase his letter because parts of it were too harsh, Smith said. 
Bishop couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. 
Bishop informed senators at Wednesday's Senate meet­ing that Smith had submitted his letter of resignation. The letter was not provided to senators because Smith resigned to Bishop -not the Senate. said Foley. Senators received an e-mailed version of the letter from Smith Wednesday night following the meeting. 
In his resignation letter, Smith said, "Officially, I am resigning to spend more time on the real reason I am here at Notre Dame: my studies. I also feel that I need to give more of myself through gen­eral community service." 
He also wrote that he could perform the job correctly and would be an asset to the bod­ies that he would serve. 
The letter also said, "I sup­pose that there is a difference of opinion where it matters most, however, and I am not being allowed to continue the job asked of me." 
Smith said the minutes for Senate have never been late. He admits that he was at fault for not sending the minutes to senators via e-mail before the meetings as requested. 
"Our conflict was where my style and Trip's style did not meet in the middle," said Smith. 
Smith said he decided to be professional and resign and hopes he can work with stu­dent government again. 
"I don't want this to be messy. All that was messy was the way it was handled. Student government is not about this type of thing. It shouldn't be this political. It's about serving the needs of the students and taking them to the administration to work referred to his previous expe­rience as district secretary for the community service-based organization Key Club in high school. 
Smith has been replaced by freshman Emily Chin. Chin signed up to become involved with student government at this year's activity fair and had not previously been in the student government office, said Foley. 
Bishop said one of her quali­fications was being student body president last year in high school. when she was making her official recom­mendation of Chin to the Senate. The Senate approved Chin without question or the usual formal letter of recom­mendation from the student body president. 
Chin attended this week's Campus Life Council and Executive Cabinet meetings, said Bishop.

Evidence found during a search of Salt Creek confirms missing Indiana University stu­dent Jill Behrman was placed there, investigators said Wednesday. 
At a press conference near Salt Creek, investigators said they are consulting with the IU Geological Department and with crews on site about the possibility of using ground-penetrating radar to find Behrman. who disap peared while riding her bike in May 2000. 
Investigators now have addi­tional hope they will find Behrman, FBI Special Agent Gary Dunn said. 
"We found items that once again reinforce to us that Jill was placed here, and that gives us that much more encouragement that we're going to find what we're looking for," Dunn said.

Notre Dame Federal Credit Union will help make it a reality. 
Search crews have spent the past week draining and search­ing for evidence in Salt Creek. Natural conditions have stifled work as rain, mud and water seepage from the ground fed back into the creek bed. 
Dunn said the 27 person Salt Creek crew spends 10 to 15 min­utes removing one worker stuck in the sludge on average. Wednesday's effort saw two workers stuck in the sludge. 
Bloomington Police Department Detective Marty Deckard said while parts of the creek bed are now showing, pools of water dot the 1.4-mile stretch of the creek. Workers have been concentrating on the few hundred yards south of the north dam. 
"We've exposed an area of land that has been under water for hundreds of years. I don't expect that mud to dry up any more," Deckard said. "You end up with mud up 6 inches above the knee, stuck and it stinks."

IN BRIEF 
U.S. Leads Oil Boom in 'Other Gulf' 
In the run up to a possible U.S. led offensive on Iraq, U.S. oil companies and strategic planners have their sights on another gulf West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a booming back­water surpassing Saudi Arabia in oil exports to the United States. 
Giant U.S. oil rigs and tankers offshore, and American oil roustabouts sporting coveralls and the flat drawls of Oklahoma and Texas onshore, are vanguards of a U.S. led oil boom in the region. It's one the United States is acknowledging as a strategic interest to be safeguarded militarily. 
..It's like the Persian Gulf in the 1960s," said Paul Michael Wihbey, a resource special­ist who has led Washington-and Jerusalem­based lobby groups in urging the United States to turn from Mideast to West African oil.

Currently, Saint Michael's provides a direct drop-off service to each residence hall for students who use the wash/dry/fold clothes plan, but business direc­tor David Bartholomew worries that students are unaware of the additional services the laundry offers. 
"It appears that many students think that the laundry just provides a wash/dry/folding service for everyday laundry," he said. "Often students think, 'Well.

Tyco executive free on $100M bond 
A.uociated Press 
NEW YORK 
A judge allowed former Tyco International Ltd. chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark Swartz to remain free on bail Thursday, pending a hearing on whether assets pledged for the bonds came from alleged multimillion dollar fraud. 
State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus set a Sept. 27 hearing to discuss the source of the money, which prosecutors contend was stolen from the company and should not be used for their bail. 
Assistant District Attorney John Moscow also said, "We expect to bring additional charges against additional defendants." He declined to elaborate. 
Meanwhile, a person with knowl­edge of the case told The Associated Press on Thursday that Tyco is in the process of selling the posh Fifth Avenue apartment and its antiques and furnishings that Kozlowski allegedly bought with Tyco money. 
The auction house, Sotheby's, has been in the $16.8 million home once to look it over, but it has not yet been appraised, the person said. 
Kozlowski and Swartz were charged last week with enterprise corruption and grand larceny for allegedly stealing some $600 mil­lion from Tyco. They face up to 25 years in prison on each of those charges if convicted. 
Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz had complained earlier this week that the men's personal assets had been frozen, and money offered by relatives and others for the bail had been rejected by prosecutors as possible proceeds of the crimes with which they are charged. 
Kozlowski's ex-wife, Angie, was expected to post $10 million in cash later Thursday on Kozlowski's $100 million bond, said his lawyer, Stephen Kaufman. 
Swartz's lawyer, James Mitchell, said his client would post $5 million security on $50 million with shares of Tyco stock, either Thursday or Friday. That was 4.02 million shares of Tyco stock, worth $6.7 million, based on Wednesday prices.

Others, such as senior dance minor Sara Pendley, found Bariel a competent and encour­aging instructor. 
"She really helped out all the dancers. She gave us comments and helped us correct our tech­nique. and she was really nice about it." Pendley said. 
Thursday's instruction served as a supplement to the compa­ny's performance tonight in the O'Laughlin Auditorium, where, Bariel said, it will be reaching back to its African roots. 
"I find that this company, because we're a repertory com­pany. we have so many choreog­raphers and so many different styles of dance. Llke, you'll see in the concert that there are four different choreographers' works in one evening. So we get the most recent contemporary modern to the oldest style of modern or jazz, because we do things that are very balletic modern and things that are more jazzy modern and things that are very modern modern. So we have this huge range," Bariel said. 
The evening's show will open with "Children of Passage," choreographed by Donald McKayle and Ronald Brown. and originally set to the live music of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Described by Bariel as a "spiritual ascent," it finds strong basis in African movement and tells the story of lost souls who are led by sprites to their ances­tral heritage. 
"Promontory," another aspect of the show. will be performed by an all-male cast, challenging the traditional male roles in dance and society. The dancers nurture each other, wrapping their arms in comfort and strength. This piece demon­strates the subtle power of the men. who execute lengthy one­legged balances and strength­draining lifts that demonstrate the versatility of the show. 
Sheri "Sparkle" Williams. who has danced with the company since its origin, explores the plight of the dancer on a quest for personal perfection in her solo entitled "Growth (A Part of a Bigger Picture)." 
"It is the raw experience of a dancer coming into their own, where they've come from, how hard they worked. The first thing she says is 'Stamina, resis­tance,' and it's all about that struggle of the dancer trying to reach that peak, reach their excellence," Bariel said. 
Choreographed by Debbie Blunden-Diggs, the Dayton­based company's artistic direc­tor, "In My Father's House" out­lines a religious journey that begins with entering a place of worship and ends in joyous cele­bration, set to gospel music pro­vided by Kirk Franklin and the Family. 
Involving such a fusion of styles, the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company aims to broad­en its appeal to the entire com­munity. Dieckgrafe hopes that the company will offer more than simply aesthetic enjoyment to the audience, providing it with a strong multicultural art­form. 
"I think it's really special that this company has a lot of roots in the black tradition of modern dance, and I think it offers us a cultural insight into that," Dieckgrafe said.

Students crowded into Saint Mary's Regina Hall dance studio Thursday for a master tech­nique class offered by the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company. 
Led by company member Monnette Bariel, the Saint Mary's community received a lesson in the Horton tradition of modern dance. 
"The opportunity to be exposed to a professional-level technique and different styles ­there's something about the hype of it being different, having someone special brought in that makes it really exciting. The newness of it and the adventure is good for the students," said Indi Dieckgrafe, director of the College's dance program.

Ana Kleva, director of University Health Services, said that it took at least 10 minutes for help to reach Northbrook, though some near the scene estimated that help did not actually arrive for nearly 20 minutes. Regardless, Notre Dame Stadium officials need to re-evaluate their emergency response procedures. 
The six doctors employed by the University in the Stadium's two emergency stations on game days simply are not enough. Six years ago, when the stadium only held 50,000 and had just one level of seating, that may have been adequate. Now, with over 80,000 people in the Stadium and an upper and lower deck, public safety measures in the Stadium need to be updated. 
The personnel supplied now is functional for the occasion-
to be sitting near Reilly began performing CPR and requested a defibrilator, the ushers were unable to obtain one. 
Of the 800-plus ushers in the stadium on a Saturday, only 20 carry radios to coordinate responses with medical service workers. Those 20 ushers are spread very thin over the 7 2 sections in the stadium. 
Even if it is merely consists of placing an usher with a radio at each section entrance, the Stadium needs to update its policy on safety. While Saturday's events may have been unavoidable, University Health Services should see it as a message that there are problems with the current system. 
Those 10 minutes or more that it took paramedics to arrive with defibrilators and proper equipment could mean saving a life next time. 
So just give me his name and I will kill whomever it is you want dead. 
I'll get away with it, too. 
In fact, to make it even more interest­ing I'll get away with it without even denying that I killed him in the 
John Litle 
first place. You're reading this think­ing I'm joking, but 
Frankly
I'm not. Think 
Obnoxious
about it. 
First off, let me set the stage. I'm going to hang around parties where I know" there'll be a good chance he, or one of the other persons I've been com­missioned to do in, will be socializing. I'll stick to the walls, making sure to have a beer in my hand all the time, but rarely drinking anything from it. I'll probably spot him from across the room, noticing either that his speech has started to slur, or he's stumbling and leaning on the wall or such. That's when I'll make my move. 
I'll head over, just start to make some small talk, friendly banter, you know the stuff. "What's your major?," "Where do you live?" I'll get him another drink so he doesn't have to wait in that big long keg line. A little later on the party is breaking up, it comes time to go. What the hell, I'll give him a ride home. And why wouldn't he accept; I've been nice all evening. 
That's when it will happen. I'll save you the details, but sometime between when he gets in my car and before the next day when he doesn't show up in his dorm, the crime will have occurred. I'm not going to deny the fact that the guy is dead, you see; it just wasn't murder. When you ask me if I murdered the guy, here's what I'll explain. 
First of all. you should have seen what this guy was wearing. Clearly he must shop at Goodwill, and no, not for the chic, "I shop at Goodwill" cool clothes, just nasty unkempt frumpy clothes that say to the world, "I am miserable, I hate my life." I got the message loud and clear from what he was wearing. This kid did not want to live, he was begging for it. I just gave him what he wanted. 
What? That's not a satisfying answer? Well, it doesn't matter either, 
that night. I had a beer the whole time I was there. I know I drove him, but I drive drunk all the time, and plus, when I got him to the place, I took out a bottle of Jack Daniels and I "caught up." We were both drunk. No one's at fault here. We were both victims. 
Hey, it was con­sensual, too. You doubt me? We were in the car and I said, "Hey man, I'm going to kill you." 
He said, "Ha ha man, go ahead, ha ha." 
It was a little slurred, but that is definitely what he said. I don't need anything other than that, so you just need to back off. 
I know I don't need any more evidence, but there's still more. You know about his past don't you? This isn't the first time he's done it. No, last year, I heard he tried to take his own life. Yeah, when someone has a past like that, you know it's not possible to murder them because they like it. It's what they want. 
You guys need to back off. Everyone always jumps on blaming the accused, but you're not adequately questioning and challenging the victim. You just need to be objective. With all the evidence I've shown you, how could you possibly think there was a murder? It's completely clear. It was consensual. I'm innocent. 
make sense, but when you apply the same exact excus­es to a murder it seems ludicrous? Perhaps it is because we just don't want to believe that rape occurs on our campus. 
Perhaps it is because we don't want to think of someone we know as having committed this crime. 
Perhaps it is just an awful betrayal we seek to impose on the 
women of our communi­
Regardless, I urge you to think about accepting such excuses and what it

UNICEF's world is unfit for children 
The U .N. Child Summit convened in New York City last May to promote the welfare of children. Two intriguing concepts of child welfare emerged. 
First, only a coalition of the United States, the Holy See and various Muslim and African nations prevented the inclusion of a right to abortion in the Summit's final action document, "A World Fit for Children." 
Abortion, of course, protects children· by killing 
Right or
them because they 
Wrong?
are not fit for the world. The Vatican and Muslim nations had acted together to oppose 
U.N. endorsements of abortion at Cairo and other conferences during the Clinton Administration. 
The second odd concept of child wel­fare surfaced when it was disclosed at the Summit that UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, had financed the 1999 publication and distribution by the Mexican government of a book called "Theoretic Elements for Working with Mothers and Pregnant Teens." 

The book states: "Reproductive health includes the following compo­nents: counseling on sexuality, preg­nancy, methods of contraception, abor­tion, infertility, infections and dis­eases." 
An accompanying workshop book tells mothers and teens about ways to obtain sexual pleasure. On "sexual relations with a partner," the book says, "Here we should insist there is (sic) no ideal or perfect relations between two or several people ... This is why we encounter many differences among women. Some women like to have relations with men. And others with another woman." 
UNICEF spokesman, Alfred Ironside, said the book was, "a product of the Mexican government supported by UNICEF financially." He described it as. "a training manual for people working with adolescent women to prevent teen pregnancy." Ironside and Carol Bellamy, UNICEF executive director, said the book had been withdrawn from circulation. Leonara Valdes, a for­mer official with the Mexican govern­ment department that produced the book, denied that claim and said the book is still being used in some Mexican states. 
UNICEF is no stranger to controversy over such matters. Since at least 1966, UNICEF has promoted contraception, 
sterilization and other birth-reduction programs. In 1996, the Vatican Mission to the 
U.N. suspended its "symbolic" contribu­tion of $2,000 a year to UNICEF. "The new involvement of UNICEF in the areas of concern" the Vatican Mission said, "had forced the Holy See to take this visible step." The Vatican charged that UNICEF had participated in the publication of a U.N. manual "advocat­ing the distribution of post-coital con­traceptives to refugee women in emer­gency situations" and had become "involved in advocacy work" on abor­tion legislation. "Post-coital contracep­tives" are not really contraceptives. They cause abortion early in pregnan­cy. 
The Vatican also said that UNICEF workers in various countries had "dis­tributed contraceptives and counseled people on using them." Archbishop Renato Martino said the decision was made after UNICEF announced that it would distribute "contraceptives and drugs to terminate pregnancies" to refugees in Rwanda and Zaire. The Vatican still refuses to contribute to UNICEF. 
In October of 2000, Archbishop Saenz Lacalle of San Salvador denounced from the pulpit an "insinuating and grotesque" 170-page sex-education booklet designed by UNICEF and El Salvador's Ministries of Health and 
Education for training adolescents on 
sexuality issues including contracep­
tion, homosexuality and abortion. 
These comments are not meant to criticize the little kids carrying the UNICEF donation cans on Halloween and the many persons who send UNICEF "holiday cards." Last year in the United States, UNICEF enlisted 2.5 million "Trick-or-Treaters" to forego asking for candy and instead to raise nearly $4 million for UNICEF. The "hol­iday cards" raised in the United States another $13 million for UNICEF. The kids and the users of the cards want to help needy children, which UNICEF does in various respects. 
But it would seem to be time for truth-in-labeling, for full disclosure that UNICEF's idea of promoting "A World Fit for Children" includes the prevention of children coming into existence and the distribution of aborti­f acients which kill children because somebody thinks they are unfit for the world.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Get the facts before you get some 
The subject of birth control is a very weighty issue. Many women, especially college-aged women, choose to take the pill as a form of contraception. 
Whereas I do not think it's necessarily the duty ofthe University, a Catholic institution, to provide birth control in the form of the pill, condoms or the like, I do not think that women should be discour­aged from using these methods to prevent pregnancy and disease, as Becket Gremmels suggested in his Sept. 18 letter. 
Yes, this is Notre Dame, but no, you can't stop students from hav­ing sex. 
Rather than admonish women for having sex and condemning them for using contraception, however, it should be encouraged for them to practice safe sex. Sex, when undertaken with responsibility and with the right forms of contraception, can be very safe. 
I'd like to point out some inaccuracies in Gremmels' letter. He claims that 3 out of 10 condoms fail. When used properly, condoms are 87 percent effective. When used with spermicide, the percent­age increases. Even more effective -and more recommended by doctors to women between the ages of 20 and 30 -is the pill. Birth control pills, when taken properly, are 99 percent effective. If women are responsible enough to take the pill properly, then the pill is only 1 percent defective. Used with a condom. the pill is even more effective. 
I am astonished at Gremmels' claim that for those whose pills fail, the pill is abortifacient. First of all, the pill is a preventive measure. To give Gremmels a little health lesson, the pill tricks a woman's body into thinking she's pregnant and it prevents the egg from being fertilized. Usually if a woman's pill fails (though if taken prop­erly this will almost never happen), the pill does not abort the fetus. She will most likely miss her next period and will know that she's pregnant. Ask any doctor, and he or she will tell you the same. 
Yes, Notre Dame's sex policy is Catholic. And I am not one to tell the University to act against its mandate as a Catholic institution. Men and women of this college can go obtain birth control on their own -for the most part, it's inexpensive and easily used. As for the claims Gremmels has made, rather than shake a finger at those who are having sex and tell them, "Birth control is not the answer," inform them of ways to avoid unwanted pregnancies and disease.

GUEST COLUMN 
Patriotism entails criticizing the government 
KENT, Ohio 
During the past year there has been a lot of talk about patriotism. As we all display our American flags (often incorrectly) and cheer America on in the fight against terrorism, there has been a lot of debate about what patriotism really means. 
Notice that the definition M lchael Collins 
does not include words like 
government or flag. It only 
refers to the country. It 
Daily Kent
also does not include the 
Stater
word hate, only love and 
devotion. 
Yet oflate all these other words seem to have been added to the definition of patriotism in the minds of citizens. One cannot be patriotic if one disagrees with the govern­ment. One cannot be patriotic if one burns the flag or flies it upside down. 
In order to be patriotic, you must hate those who do not agree with our government, or those who aren't in our country. 
These definitions are not true patriotism. Our government is not our country and neither is our flag. Our country stands alone, independent of these other things. Our flag is only a symbol, granted it is a very powerful symbol. but it is still a symbol nonetheless. Although the government runs our country. it cannot stand alone. It relies on the consent of the governed. If there is one object or organization that can be defined as our country, it is our constitution. 
Our constitution creates and defir.es our coun­try. It gives the values that we as Americans should hold closest to our hearts. Our govern­ment can change, our flag can change, but only the entire country working together can change the constitution. Our constitution creates our most sacred values like freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of religion. These are the ideas that give birth to "love for or devotion to" my country. These are the things that make me feel patriotic. 
Our flag is a symbol of our freedom. That free­dom includes the right to fly the flag upside down or even to burn it. The code for displaying the flag states that the flag should only be flown upside down "as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property." Many people feel that our freedoms are in a state of "dire distress." not by planes flying into buildings, but by our own government. When they burn the flag, they are not saying that they hate our country. They are saying that they believe our own government is destroying the freedoms that our country holds most dear. They believe that our freedom itself is indeed burning. 
Our freedom of expression gives us the right to question our government's actions. Citizens who blindly accept the battles we are fighting are not exercising that right. Many seem perfectly happy to take that right away from us. This is not patri­otism. To not exercise the rights that make our country great is to risk losing them. The patriots are the ones fighting for the ideals for which our country stands, not those mindlessly bobbing their heads in agreement. 

Whether you agree with the government's actions or not isn't what is important. It is the questioning itself. I do agree with some of the government's actions, and I disagree with oth­ers. But it is the fact that I am actually forming my own opinion that makes me patriotic. 
The next time someone talks about patriotism, take a moment to stop and think about what the word really means. You may find patriots in places you did not expect.

By MARIA SMITH Scene Writer 
Domer Dogs 
What is it that m'a'kes people love their dogs so much? Is it the drool? The noise? The cost of getting rid of fleas? Of course, the answer is that despite any of these things, all dogs off er something invaluable and rare --unconditional 
love.  And  no  dogs  get  more  love  in  
return than the six livin g in dorms  on  
Notre Dame campus.  

Between lonely freshmen looking for a friend and older students missing their own puppies, the dorm dogs get plenty of attention. The entire campus knows and loves these furry friends. 
Anyone who lives with a dog long enough begins to talk to their pet.like_ a little person. Dogs are very much hke ht-tie people --they have their own tastes, favorite pastimes, and personalities. Here at Notre Dame, our dogs represent all dif­ferent aspects of the dog spectrum. 
Farley
What's the most recognizable face on campus? Father Hesburgh? Father Malloy? How about Farley? The little light brown Pekingese can be seen almost every warm day lying outside on the grass or stretch­ing her leash across the side­walk looking for bits of bologna sandwiches and other treats from students on their way back from North Dining Hall. 
Farley has lived in Farley Hall since December 2000. Sister Carrine Etheridge took her in after she was found by the Notre Dame lakes in the cold with her little sister. Etheridge was initial­ly a little reluctant to take her in, but by now the dog has become an institution of Farley Hall life. 
Farley may appear lethargic at times while lying on the lawn but she wakes up for football games and parties like any Notre Dame girl. Farley has her own shirt for football games as well as a Notre Dame cheerleading outfit and loves running around the benches. 
The girls dress her up for the dances. including a grass skirt and walnut shells for last year's luau. This year, she and her owner are going to Farley's "A Perfect Match" as Lady and the Tramp, which has yet to be announced. However, Etheridge does not trust her alone at parties since an incident that occurred last year. 
"Those Siegfried boys," said Etheridge. "They had citrus vodka in squirt gun.s, and they squirted her... she came m licking her coat, and pretty soon she-just passed out. I escort her to the dances now." 
Farley is automatically popula.r around campus. "I go for walks, and 1t used to be, 'Hi, Sister,"' said her owner. "Now it's, 'Hi, Farley.'" 
Despite living at a top university, Farley is not an intellectual animal. "She's not really God's brightest dog," said Etheridge. However, Farley has learned to sit, lie down, dance, and 
watch the door after parietals. "We're 
going to train her to detect boys," said 
Etheridge. 
Eli 
No one can walk into Fisher without 
running into Eli, Fisher's droopy-eared 
Basset Hound and Beagle mix. She's 
lived there since Nov. 4, 2001, when two 
doctors donated her to Father Rob 
Moss, hoping she would get more atten­
tion than at her old home. 
The 2 1/2 year-old dog is quiet and 
complacent for her age, but she perks 
up at the word "outside." She loves to 
go for walks, and will play with 
McGlinn's dogs Lucy and Gus. 
"Sometimes Gus will act all tough, 
like, 'Oh, I'm the male,"' said owner 
Betsy Bright. "But Eli won't back 
down." 
Nevertheless, Eli is usually a sleepy 
dog. "Friday night, one of the freshmen 
came from a party and asked to take 
her for a walk about midnight," said 
Moss. "So she went out and ran around. 
That was unusual for her... she slept 
most of the weekend after that." 
Like any dog, Eli enjoys the treats res­
idents bring her. She isn't a picky eater, 
and enjoys everything. "Once she stood 
up against the counter and pulled dow~ 
an entire pineapple upside down cake,' 
said Moss. "Another time, I was coming 
home ... and some people ran up to me 
~ . .-:-.:,'" :­
-~1:f 
., ........ _,.,  -~ C 
~ '«i' 
-~­
and told me she'd torn apart her bed and eaten some of it." 
Eli can usually be found lounging across the stairs of Fisher Hall, but don't be intimidated. She likes to be petted, and she'll never bite. 
Honey 
Stanfora Hall's Berney was the first dog to move into a dorm after the University ruled that rectors could have pets in the fall of 1999. Father Thomas Gaughan found her on a Golden Retriever rescue Web site and she first moved in March 2000. Honey recently returned from minor surgery at the vet, and can cur­rently be recognized by her giant satel­lite dish collar and bald spots on her head and leg. 
"She's smart; she's going to try to hide behind the chair and lick her stitches," said Gaughan as the dog walked around the apartment. "But I still see you, Honey." 
Unlike her neighbor Farley, the 2 1/2 year-old Golden Retriever and Sheltie mix likes staying with her owner more than meeting and greeting on the quad "She likes hanging out with dad," said Gaughan. 
Honey also loves going on trips and taking car rides. "She gets excited when she knows I'm getting ready to go out," said Gaughan. "If I ask her, 'Can you stay here and watch the room?', her eyes droop and her head drops, like, Tm not going, am I?'" 
Like all the dorm dogs, Honey gets lots of treats from residents. ''I've had resi­dents send her home-baked dog cook­ies," said Gaughan. "I never get cookies, she always gets them." 
Outside, Honey loves to chase chip­munks and rabbits and stalk squirrels. "She'll get down and sort of follow them before she chases them . . . when the

Ajax has never sniffed out boys after parietals, but he has caught other illegal intruders. "He used to go to this one door every time we went out," said Rakoczy. "Finally I knocked on it; it Contact Maria Smith at turned out the girl was keeping a cat in msmith4@nd.edu there." 
Despite his brave name and brave bark, Ajax isn't an outgoing dog. "He likes Eli, and he likes Honey," said Rakoczy, "but he doesn't like every dog." 
A dog of unusu­al tastes, Ajax prefers mint-fla­vored things like cough drops, gum and candy canes to dog treats. "Once last year he found one of those giant thick candy canes; he thought it was the find of the year," said Rakoczy. "I think the girls leave them around for him. All the dogs are really pretty spoiled. 
"He's great company for me squirrels go up a tree, she does what we call the 'Honey dance,' sort of hopping around the tree and trying to climb it." 



In the winter Honey sometimes wears reindeer antlers. "That's about the only time I dress her up," said Gaughan. "She runs around in the snow, and it's pretty funny to watch. During finals, it's a good stress relief." 
Lucy and Gus 
Lucy and Augustus, better known as Gus, are the newest dogs to the campus. Owner Betsy Bright almost did not take the job as rector of McGlinn when she heard that she could bring only one pet under 50 pounds. Lucy, a Black Labrador, weighs 68 pounds, and Gus, an Akita and Husky mix, weighs 102 pounds. After hearing about the dogs, Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman made an exception to the rule and allowed them to stay. The dogs love their new home. "They're spoiled rotten and loving every minute of it," said Bright. 
Lucy was seven months old when Bright's boyfriend's brother decided he couldn't keep the dog and needed to find her a new home. "Black Labs need a lot of attention," said Bright. "He didn't realize how much work she'd be." Gus, who was something of a miracle puppy, moved in a few months later. 
Gus was born to a mother who had supposedly been spayed and was not breathing when he was born. He was small and the other puppies would not let him eat so he was hand-fed until Valentine's Day, when he moved in with his new family. 
Lucy and Gus are inseparable now, but they weren't at first. "I used to take Gus to work with me every day," said Bright. "Lucy would try to eat him." Now, the dogs are almost always together, either 
curling up next to 
each other for 
naps or keeping 
an eye on each 
other outside. 
Lucy and Gus used to accompa­ny Bright when she volunteered as a minister of care in St. Norbert Parish in Chicago. Bright said her dogs always had enormous thera­peutic value. "I think every dog has a potential to be empathetic and sympathetic to your every need," she said. "I've had girls come in here saying they've had a bad day, and they don't even want to talk about it. They just ask if they can sit here with the dogs for awhile. Twenty minutes later they 
get up and leave, 
and they feel a lot 
better." 
Lucy and Gus are both active outside dogs. Lucy loves to swim and is a talent­ed Frisbee player, while Gus helped Bright's brother Billy train for a marathon in Chicago. "I throw the Frisbee and she'll run out after it," said Bright. "She's like a wide receiver ... I have to spell some words in front of them like w-a-l-k, or w-a-t-e-r, or defi­nitely F-r-i-s-b-e-e. They're smart, they know a lot of words." 
Unlike most dogs, Gus and Lucy's favorites treats are health food. They don't like lettuce, but they love baby carrots, peanut butter, green peppers and grapes. "Watching them eat grapes is hilarious," said Bright. ·'They don't want to break the skin of the grape and hurt it, and yet that's exactly what they want to do, because they want to eat it. It takes Gus about five minutes to eat a grape." 
Gus has moved right into the dorm occasionally barking at suspiciou~ intruders such as new FedEx men. "You can see his white face in the window watching the lawn outside," said Bright. "We joke that he's watching the O'Neill boys, protecting our ladies." 
Telamon Aj,ax
Pangborn Hal 's cocker spaniel, Telamon Ajax, was named after the Greek hero of the Iliad who engaged Hector in single combat and rescued Achilles' body from the Trojans. "He's a little wimpy dog," owner Heather Rakoczy said. "So he needed a big name." 
Ajax had lived with Rakoczy for 5 years before he came to Notre Dame in 1998, the year before rectors were first a~lowed to keep pets. Hakoczy brought him to the dorm as soon as possible. 
For the first year he lived in the dorm,

WOMENS GOLF 
Irish begin season at Michigan State 
By ANDY TROEGER 
Sports Writer 
In the past few years, Notre Dame has made an increased commitment to its golf programs with the building of the Warren Golf Course and the hiring of full­time coaches John Jasinski and Debby King. 
The womens golf team hopes to continue to show the results of this improvement as it begins its season by heading to the Mary Fossum Invitational at Michigan State University this weekend. 
Head coach Debby King is opti­mistic that her squad will improve in her second year at the helm. 
"We had a scoring average last year of 324," King said. "Our goal this year is 312, and I think we can reach that." 
This year's team will rely on a combination of returning golfers and a number of quality freshmen that will compete for varsity time. 
"The freshmen's scoring aver­ages are quite low from their summer competition." King said. "If they play that well now, they could jump into the lineup, and indeed some of them already have." 
Two freshmen, Katie Brophy and Sarah Bassett, will start in th~ top two positions for the Irish this weekend. Both hail from Spokane, Wash., but while they competed against each other in high school, they made their deci­sions to come to Notre Dame independent of each other. 
One of the upperclassmen join­ing them will be junior Shannon Byrne, who recently won the Notre Dame Campus Championship. Also competing for the Irish will be sophomore Karen Lotta, whose 79.8 average led the team last year. 
Rounding out the squad for the Irish will be 2000 Notre Dame Invitational Champion Rebecca Rogers and freshman Lauren Gebauer.

No. 7 Irish seek to avenge last year's loss 

 Notre Dame ready for Big East rival Rutgers 
ByJOE LICANDRO 
Sports Writer 
Payback will be on the mind of the Notre Dame women's soccer team this weekend. Last year, Rutgers shocked Notre Dame 2-1, marking the first time an Irish womens soccer team had ever lost a game to Rutgers. 
Tonight at 7:30, the 7th­ranked Irish will have the opportunity for revenge when they host the Scarlet Knights. On Sunday, the Irish, who enter this game with a record of 4-2, will host another Big East opponent in Seton Hall. Game time is set for 2 p.m. to immediately follow the Irish men's game against Providence. 
Three weeks ago, the Irish won their first two opening Big East Conference games against Providence and Virginia Tech in impressive fashion. They are hoping their strong conference play will continue this week-

Notre Dame has faced some of the toughest competition in the coun­try. Two weekends ago, the Irish lost to defending national Carli Lloyd caught the

the Irish for two goals in 
week," said Waldrum. "Players like Melissa Tancredi and Amanda Guertin really need to step up again on offense. Amy Warner needs to keep playing consistently like she has all season. Our midfield has to dominate. Ashley Dryer and Randi Scheller have to really play well for us to win." 
The Notre Dame offense came to life in Sunday's game against Maryland. After falling behind 2-0, the Irish stormed back with five goals in the final 25 minutes for an unbelievable 5-2 victory. The Irish may need another similar performance this weekend against a strong Rutgers defense. The Scarlet Knights, who enter today's game with a record of 4-4-1, have posted three consecutive shutouts. 
After three straight weeks of trying to discover the right combination of players on defense, Waldrum believes he

has finally found a strong defensive lineup to replace injured starters Vanessa Pruzinsky and Gudrun Gunnarsdottir. Midfielders Kim Carpenter and Mary Boland, who started the first games of their career at defense against Maryland Sunday, will hold on to the outside fullback posi­tions. Sophomore Candace Chapman will move from her traditional outside back posi­tion to the inside to assist freshman Catherine Sigler. 
"We're going to go with the same defensive lineup we played against Maryland," said Waldrum. "I thought they all played really well, especially for the first time ever playing together. We need them to really play well again this weekend."

that we have an offense that 
can do that." 
Despite a strong Walsh 
offense backed by a relentless 
defense, Badin quarterback 
Erin Zachry was able to guide 
her offense on a few key plays 
that turned the tables in their 
favor. Zachry completed seven 
of nine passes in the first half, 
including one to receiver 
Stephanie Heath who followed 
through to Amy Marshall for 
the Bullfrogs' first touchdown. 
"We knew our receivers could 
run really crisp routes," said 
Zachry. "It was all just a matter 
of pulling it off." 
Going into the second half, a pumped Badin defense upped its game to shut down Walsh. The Bullfrogs had a triad of power in linebackers Betsy Schroeder and Cindy Adimari and safety Jen Carter. The three had a combined nine tackles in the final five minutes of the game, including a key tackle by Carter on a Walsh fourth down. 
"We really got fired up at the end," said Schroeder. "With this team, there's always something to be fired up about." 
The game was clenched by Badin in the last six minutes with a touchdown by Heath fol­lowed up by a one-point conver­sion pass from Zachry to Heath. 
"We really just relaxed, fell into place and had fun ," said captain Katie Bares of the turn­around performance. 
Schroeder felt that only good times were ahead for Badin. 
"We played our game tonight," said Schroeder. "This is what real Badin football is all about."

"They  were  very excited  

about the game,,. Clark said. "They're a good team in their own right, and they played us tough." 
Justin Detter put the Irish in front with a goal in the 32nd minute to give Notre Dame the 1-0 lead. The lead was short­lived as Bradley answered with Preston Good ·s goal just one minute 15 seconds later. 
Notre Dame regained the lead when Chris Riley scored 
18:50 into the second half. The braves Ryan Glynn tied the game in the 77th minute before Tim Regan scored the deciding goal less than five minutes later off an assist from Ryan Raschke. 
"We did some good things, and there are some things we need to work on," Clark said. "It was tight, they really domi­nated for about 10 minutes in the second half. It was one of those games that seesaws, when there are spells when we're in the games and spells when they're in the game." 
Irish goalie Chris Sawyer tallied a season-high seven saves, while Bradley outshot the Notre Dame 22-10 and had a 6-4 corner kick advan­tage. 
"Sawyer was tremendous," Clark said. 
The game was delayed because of intense rain and lightning, which marks the second time this season the Irish have had a game stopped for lightning. 
The Irish don't have time to dwell on this loss because they face Big East rival Providence Sunday. The Friars lost 3-0 to Rhode Island Thursday night, dropping their record to 1-5 overall and 0-3 in conference. 
"We have a game Sunday, so there's not too much time to sit and lick our wounds," Clark said. "It's a Big East game and every Big East game is a tough game. We've got to get this ship back on an even keel."

CROSS COUNTRY 
Breaking away 
. Irish look to continue success in National Catholic Championships 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
Every September, both the mens and womens cross coun­try teams welcome squads from many of the nation's Catholic colleges and universities to the Burke Memorial Golf Course for the National Catholic Championships. 
And every September, with about 28 colleges in attendance, the Irish dominate -both men and women, team and individu­ally. They expect their winning streak to continue today. 
The 20th-ranked Irish men have won the last seven teams titles, while the fifth ranked women's squad has claimed the title each of the last eight sea­sons. 
Because of such success, this race has come to be, in a sense, an experimental meet for the Irish, one in which the coaches can play around with the lineup to see who will lead the team in the upcoming season. 
"It's an opportunity for us to gain a little confidence and to run as a group," Irish mens head coach Joe Piane said. "We approach this race totally dif­ferently than we will the one in two weeks, the Notre Dame Invitational. This is a great opportunity for our kids to develop confidence." 
The Irish lineup will consist of the runners who finished in the top seven at their first race of the season two weeks ago and the race will give them an opportunity to run together as a team. 
"I won't say it's a workout, but it's going to be what we call a fast continuous run." Piane said. "What we really want to work on tomorrow is running as a group." 
The women's team will also be focusing on running as a group, but coach Tim Connel1y doesn't plan to run all of his top runners. 
"This is one of the real early­season meets," Connelly said. "What we're doing with this meet is trying to develop our depth. We're going to hold out some of our top kids." 
Seniors Jenn Handley and Jenn Fibuch, freshman Molly Huddle and sophomore All American Lauren King will sit out the National Catholic Championships. In their place, Connelly wants to put some of the younger runners in order to give the less experienced more experience. Even without the top runners, the Irish are not expecting to finish anywhere but first. 
"We want to win it. We don't take it lightly," sophomore Megan Johnson said. "It's so early in the season. We're all trying to run as a team. run as a pack, work together. We want to have a really strong pack near the front of the race." 
"I think that the athletes we

 for the true testament 
The first question Tyrone Willingham was asked at his weekly press conference was in reference to the signifi­cance of fac­ing anoth­er black head coach in this week­end's game a­gainst 
Michi­
gan State. 
He an­swered in his usual straightforward manner. 
"I think I consistently said that my situation here at Notre Dame, the fact that two coaches of African-American decent will go against each other this weekend is significant, but it also points to a shortcoming in the system and that is disappointing." 
It is disappointing. And I won't be the only one to say that.

Not this time, not this year 
After five consecutive losses, the Irish are looking to turn the tide and win 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
With just under eight min­utes left in the game, with the wounds from the previous season's victory still tender, with the memory of a slip that cost them the game still fresh in their minds, the Irish fell back into a nightmare. 
One year ago, during the third game of the season, Notre Dame was facing Michigan State. With eight minutes left the score was tied at 10. Then it happened. · Spartan quarterback Ryan Van Dyke connected with Charles Rogers, hoping to con­vert a third-and-six into a first down. Instead, he won the game ·and left Notre Dame 0-5 against Michigan State in their last five contests. 
''I've never beat Michigan State since I was here," said S h a n e 
Michigan State, Notre Dame head coach Bob Davie stated quite clearly what Michigan State had and what his team lacked -explosiveness. 
Tht~ Spartans, for the second year in a row, had scored on the big play and the Irish watched as their team fell flat. 
In 2001, it was Van Dyke's pass to Rogers. Vontez Duff just couldn't catch the young receiver and Walton was left holding nothing when he made a last-ditch, diving grab for Rogers. Rogers was left holding the football -in the end zone. 
"I didn't make the tackle," Duff said after the game. " ... It's all about making plays and I just didn't make that play." 
Had that been the first time Notre Dame had been burned on a Spartan play, it would have hurt. But the fact that it was the second year in a row was so much worse than that. 
During the

one final chance to beat Michigan State and leave Notre Dame with the memory of a victory instead of the pain of defeat. 
The Embarrassment of defeat 
Notre Dame has lost to 
Michigan State five years in a 
row. The Irish have not 
recorded a victory against the 
Spartans since 1994. Bob 
Davie faced off against Bobby 
Williams five times. He lost 
five times. That's the third­
longest Irish losing streak to 
one team. 
"It's ridiculous," said Irish center Jeff Faine. " ... It's very frustrating and this team is ready to flip it around." 
In 1997 it was a blowout. The No. 17 Spartans defeated the Irish 23-7 in front of a Notre Dame stadium crowd of 80,000. In 1998 it was worse. With the home crowd behind them, the Spartans scored 45 points on the way to a victory against Notre Dame. That was the first year fifth-year seniors such as Walton were at Notre Dame. That was the first time they watched their team lose. 
But it didn't get any better. The next three years Notre Dame teams fell one after the other to Michigan State. The Spartans didn't need a Trojan horse. They just walked onto the field and, after four quar­ters or play, they would have caught the Irish off guard at some point and come home with the victory. It was a 10­point difference in 1999, a six­point difference in 2000 and a mere touchdown in 2001 that separated the victors from the losers. And every time Notre Dame had the same position -the Irish are the enemy. 
Playmakers 
After last year's loss to 
fired the pass 
to Herb 
Haygood who ran for the 
touchdown. Tony Driver had 
fallen on the Spartan Astroturf. 
Haygood was never touched. 
So when the same slant pat­tern on the same side gave the Spartans the win again last year, it was like reliving a nightmare. 
"It's always in my head that that last play they always seem to catch a slant and go score on it," Irish receiver Omar Jenkins said. " ... I couldn't believe that it happened." 
"They had a stud running back and a stud quarterback and wide receiver and a tight end," Irish linebacker Courtney Watson said. "We gave up things here and there and shouldn't have been that close.... We're taking that per­sonal now and we're just not going to let that happen." 
Something to prove 
Now, 12 mpnths, one new coach and a new playing sur­face later, these two teams will face off once again. And they both have something to prove. 
Under the leadership of new head coach Tyrone Willingham, the Irish want to prove to Michigan State that they are a new team. That there is something inexplicable that is part of this program that will make it the first team in six years that will not fall to the Spartans. 
Over the summer, Jenkins met some Michigan State fans and they were already talking trash. They were questioning how the Irish defense would contain Rogers. They reminded Jenkins that no one in Notre Dame's program has defeated Michigan State. But Jenkins had a response ready. 
"You'll see. Something spe­cial 's going to come out of 
this," Jenkins told the Spartans. 
For the Irish, they hope that something special is a win. Michigan State has been a thorn in their side long enough. It's time to take con­trol. 
"We're all hungry to beat Michigan State," quarterback Carlyle Holiday said. "We

But as early as Saturday, the loss was prompting the Spartans to start over this week and prove to the nation that they can win, starting with a victory against Notre Dame. 
"We have to get ready for

"It was very frustrating out there," said Spartans head coach Bobby Williams after the wide receiver Arnaz Battle. "We're the hunted right now, we're No. 12, we're going to see their best shot." 
Ta king the field 
On Saturday, thP Spartans and the Irish will spar once 
again and the bookies have given the Spartans a two-point advantage. 
The Irish wiJJ travel to East Lansing to the noise and the yells of Michigan State. They will travel with an alumnus as their coach. But even that may not help. 
"I've always been on the other side of the stadium," Willingham said. "So the sourids, the dynamics are totally different. ... It's going to be loud. Every movement that we make will be echoed by their cheers or boos or jeers or whatever they decide to throw at us." 
Michigan State will be look­ing to hit Notre Dame, and hit hard. The Spartans will be looking to make the big play one more time. 
"We're not going to let it come down to one play," Watson said. "We're not going to let it come down to one drive or one series. We're going to do what we got to do from the beginning of the game and just take care of our busint1ss and so it won't have to come down to that."

QUARTERBACKS IRISH RUSHING IRISH PASSING 
Willingham will be returning to his alma mater and coaching on the other sidelines for the first time and he knows the sights and sounds of East Lansing. He has led the Irish to 3­0, the first time that has happened in six years.  Holiday has been, to say the least, inconsistent. He threw 226 yards one week but only 50 the next. However, he settled into his role against Michigan and proved that he is danger­ous on the run and on the pass. If he can stay off the ground, he will be a chal­lenge for the MSU defense.  Led by Grant, the Irish rushing game showed major improvement last weekend against Michigan. Despite a fum­ble, the Irish gained 157 passing yards. The Irish are gaining an average of 14 7 rushing yards a game and scored two touch­downs last weekend.  The Irish receiving corps is averaging 13.5 yards a reception. If the offen­sive line and the running backs can protect Holiday and he can get a pass off, the Irish pass gamr could be a force to contend with. However, Holiday was sacked six times last week.  
Williams is only 15-12 overall, giving him a .555 winning percent­age. However, he seems to have Notre Dame's number. The Spartan head coach has defeated the Irish both years his team has faced off against them.  Smoker can throw -especially to Rogers. The veteran quarterback averages eight yards a pass and has completed more than 56 percent of his passes. However, he's already thrown three interceptions this season and does not use a variety of receivers.  If last week's perfor­mance is any indica­tion, the Irish run shouldn't face too many problems. The Spartans allowed over 150 yards of rush offense and didn't recover either of Cal's fumbles. However, the Spartans did have six tackles for a loss.  Cal passed for 246 yards against the Spartans last weekend and completed 57 percent of its passes. However, Michigan State is averaging an interception per game. If the real Michigan State pass defense arrives, it could spell trouble for the Irish.  
Willingham has the advantage in this catego­ry. Although Williams has managed to beat the Irish, Williifgliam has more experience and ha5 had more success than his Spartan counterpart. Bis team has been pre­pared for anything an opponent throws at them.  Both quarterbacks have experience with their ~liiW.S1 Sfl19~xf.Ji<\~ h~d piore l exp(1r1enqe i:n ~fchigan.

SPARTAN RUSHING SPARTAN PASSING SPECIAL TEAMS 
The Irish rush defense is only allowing 85 rush yards a game. They managed to shut down Chris Perry last weekend but had trouble with Purdue's Joey Harris. Every fumble Notre Dame has forced, it has recovered. And now Watson is back.  Notre Dame's secondary continues to be solid. It shut down the passing game and totaled four interceptions this season, holding opposing teams to a 43 completion per­centage. The Irish have intercepted five times this season and returned one for a touchdown.  The Irish special teams have not lived up to their potential recently. They allowed a blocked field goal last weekend and Setta missed two the weekend before. However, Sett.a can still be considered danger­ous from as far as 60 yards out and Duff is always a threat on returns.  Notre Dame has a vendetta to settle. The Irish have lost to the Spartans five times and they are out to prove that can win against this team. ln addition, they have an alum as a coach who has played for years in Spartan Stadium.

The Irish run defense continues to shut down opponents' run games and the Michigan State offense hasn't seen 'such a tough defense yet this season.

Notre Dame's desire for a win may draw focus away J.r.om the game and Michigan State is used to winning this series.  


It's going tu be a game of intangibles. Both teams have been inconsistent this season -Notre Dame on offense, Michigan State on defense. What it comes down to is which team can focus their emotional energy into physical energy and take home the victory. Notre Dame wants it more.

KEY MATCHUP 
NOTRE DAME MSU RECEIVER SECONDARY CHARLES ROGERS 

Big Michigan State passing plays have been the determining factor in the last two Irish losses to the Spartans. 
The Irish secondary has been the strong point of its defense this season, but Walton, Duff, Earl and Sapp will have their work cut out for them against Heisman potential Rogers. Rogers had a phenomenal season last year and his size will present a challenge.
