BOG discusses Strategic Plan 

By SHANNON NELLIGAN 
News Writer 
Mary-Jo Regan-Kubinski, co­chair of the Strategic Plan, pre­sented the possibility of increased student involvement and awareness in the Strategic Plan at Monday's Board of Governance meeting. 
The plan was developed to tackle major areas on campus which need improvement. The plan was established last year and will continue through the 2005 academic year. 
"Eleven groups, composed of faculty and staff, discussed the current needs of the college and came up with four major arel!s of improvement -now we need student input," said Regan-Kubinski. 
These areas of improvement have been translated into four major goals for the college to complete within the next five years. The goals are to educate women to make a difference in a complex world; to cultivate leadership and enhance com­munication; to recruit, retain and graduate a vital and diverse student body that ensures the college's leader­ship in women's education; and to develop and focus resources to advance the mission of Saint Mary's College. 
Akmaral Omarova, Student Trustee, who also attended these meetings, explained that this is a crucial time for student involvement because it is a pro-, ject that will continue over the next several years. 
Omarova also reiterated that, "Even though students don't see the long range of this plan -it will directly effect them." 
The Board discussed ideas on how to promote and encourage student involvement. These ideas included a student guide to the strategic plan and the possibility of creating a direct link to the document in the form of an icon on network computers. 
Student body president Michelle Nagle also encouraged leaders of the class boards to dedicate part of their meetings to this topic. This will create a larger awareness of the plan because the students' peers will be explaining it and there­fore it will not be a foreign idea developed by the administra­

ND aluD1na can1paigns for congressional seat 
ByJASON McFARLEY News Editor 
lt only took a few days on Notre Dame's campus in 1972 for Kathleen Cekanski Farrand to realize she was in the right place. 
In the opening days of the semester that year ­the first t h a t University officials 

a d m it t e d Cekanski Farrand women as undergraduates -a large ban­ner at the all-campus picnic greeted Cekanski Farrand, a first-year law student in the third class of women to gradu­ate from Notre Dame Law School, and her female peers. It read simply: "We're glad you're here." "I remember the impact of seeing that banner," the 1973 law school graduate said. "It was like the campus literally opening its doors and extending its hand to us." Some three decades later, Cekanski Farrand, a former rectress at the University and today a prominent local attor­ney, hopes the U.S. Congress will be just as accommodating. Cekanski Farrand, a Democrat from Mishawaka, announced her candidacy Aug. 18 for Indiana's 2nd District 
congressional seat which U.S. Rep. Tim Hoerner will vacate in 2003.. 
The newly expanded district encompasses 12 counties, including St. Joseph, where South Bend and Mishawaka are located. 
Cekanski Farrand became the fourth Democrat to declare her candidacy for the 2002 election. 
Her campaign will be a grass­roots effort that focuses on the district's constituents, she said. 
"We do not see this campaign as a sprint which focuses on. which candidate can raise the most amount of money the fastest," she said in her Aug. 18 announcement, "But rather, we see this congressional campaign as a marathon of meeting peo­ple and taking time to discuss their concerns." 
"It's important to meet as many people as we can and lis­ten to what they're saying," Cekanski Farrand said in an interview with The Observer this month. 
Her family-centered cam­paign also will center on infus­ing traditional vaJues into gov­ernment, she said. 
"People my age and older remember a party of the peo­ple," the 53-year-old said. 'Tm campaigning on the core values of vision, courage and commit­ment. When I try to tie up what my campaign's all about, it's about rekindling that spirit, because I just don't see it as much as it could be."

INSIDE COLUMN QUOTES OF THE WEEK 
Students 
demonsrate fair weather pride 

American pride, who knows what it is? Until two weeks ago you never saw people randomly waving an American flag or saying that they were proud to be an American. This makes me question whether or not people really are proud and know what it means to be Americans on a day to day basis or if it is something we all take for granite. 
Driving down Grape road for instance I saw a Jeep which had a giant American flag waving from the spare tire in back. It is safe to say this is not an event you would have seen three weeks ago. Again the flags hanging from various stadi­ums in the United States ­not something we have seen before, and certainly flags being handed out at a Notre Dame football game is defi­natly something not seen before. 
While all this American pride does rally the nation in times of tragedy it is safe to assume that Americans, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students included, do not exhibit American Pride 365 days a year -face it we don't even do it with respect now. After the flags were used at Saturday's game how many ofus threw them on the ground and discarded them, simply because they were a nuisance to hold? What ever hap­pened to not letting the American flag touch the ground? 
I was appalled Saturday to see so many flags, even though they were paper, on the ground only to be stepped on and torn apart. I was also com­pletely distraught to see people around me rip­ping the flags in half to throw them up in the air as confetti. After the terrorism our country has faced where is our respect for this symbol of our nation? 
If you did not want the burden of holding the flag through out the game you should not have taken it -or after the pre-game tribute you should have folded it up and put it in your pock­et. In any case those who call themselves Americans should not have ripped up our flag or thrown it on the ground for someone else to step on. These were again the same people at half­time who stood up while ~I am proud to be an American" was being sung. 
Americans need to learn what it is to be an American daily and not just when we are called to defend our honor. We should be proud to have the flag hanging in our windows or to be wearing it on our shirt -but instead it is a symbol that is rarely thought about. 
We like many in the country are fair weather Americans, who like convenience. When it is brought to our attention and we are tested Americans do step up to the plate and defend what we believe. However, this is only when times are rough. Do we really understand what everyday things we take for granite? 
It is clear that America has united and rallied to defend our honor in the last two weeks we need to take time to evaluate our everyday lives and have pride in everything we do daily and not just when our country is being challenged by ter­rorists.

Glenn speaks to high schoolers 
COLUMBUS, Ohio 
Astronaut and former Sen. John Glenn and Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell addressed 229 high school students at Ohio State University about the importance of citizenship and voting especially in regards to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Students rep­resenting eight central Ohio high schools filled the Michael Moritz College of Law Auditorium for a Youth Summit as a part of the Kids Voting 2000 program spon­sored by the John Glenn Institute. Although the focus of the day was the importance of voting and getting involved with politics, Glenn and Blackwell used most of their time to talk about the terrorist attacks and the effects they have on students. Glenn began his speech by saying the world had changed a lot in the past couple weeks. "What has changed is hatred: pure, unadulterat­ed hatred," Glenn said. "That is inconceivable, almost as inconceivable that people could turn an aircraft into what turned out to be horizontal missiles."

'Crossfire' returns for another week 
WASIIINGTON 
"Crossfire" co-hosts Tucker Carlson and Bill Press engaged the George Washington University student body in friendly banter to warm up for a live broadcast from campus Thursday. Citing packed audiences, a Hatchet article and intelligent questions from the students as rea­sons to keep up the new town hall meeting format, they announced the show would call GW home for one more week. Shows Thursday and Friday continued a trend set earlier in the week -Republicans and Democrats cast­ing aside political arsenal and mostly agreeing on a wartime cause against terrorists. Sens. Joseph Biden, Jr. (D-Del.) and Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) outlined the diffi­cult road ahead for the country Thursday night, two hours before President George W. Bush's speech before a joint session of Congress. "Crossfire" guests Reps. Mike Castle (R-Del.), John Mica (R-Fla.), Jim Moran (D-Va.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) discussed possible American responses to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Bush's speech during Friday's broadcast.

Crime rate falls in NYC after attack 
NEW YORK 
Violent crime dropped sharply in New York City last week compared with the same period a year ago, according to figures released Monday. 
Officials linked the 17 .5 per­cent drop in part to the stepped-up police presence fol­lowing the terrorist attacks. 
"Manhattan has got to be the most policed area in the nation right now," Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said. 
The Sept. 11 attacks "kind of transformed the city," he added. "This thing has scared a lot of people in the city and the people who commit criminal activities, I would imagine, are no different than anybody else." 
The city had four homicides from Sept. 17-23, compared with 10 during the same period last year. Other violent crimes -rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, graucl larce­ny and auto theft -also decreased. 
The previous week, when the city was nearly brought to a halt by the attacks, violent crime dropped 34 percent com­pared with the year-ago period. 
Crime has fallen in the city throughout the year. There were 446 homicides citywide as of Sept. 23, compared with 508 during the same period in 
2000. 
Kerik said he believes people who died in the World Trade. Center attacks should not be counted in the city's murder statistics. 
"As far as I'm concerned, it's a war crime," he said.

Tornado kills 2 Maryland students 
By ETAN HOROWITZ Diamondback staff writer · 
COLLEGE PAilK. Md. 
A fast-moving tornado ripped through College Park yesterday, killing two campus students, forcing the evacuation of most of Norlh Campus, destroying buildings and wreaking havoc throughout the campus. 
Gov. Parris N. Glendening vis­ited the campus last night and declared a state of emergency in Prince George's County. The campus is open today, but classes are canceled. 
Capt. Chauncey 13owers, of the Prince George's County Fire and EMS Dt~partmcnt, said two female students who were dri­ving on University Boulevard were killed after the tornado picked their vehicle up and threw it into the rear of Easton l I all. 
Porty-seven people, none with life-threatening injuries, were taken to area hospitals, Bowers said. 
Bowers also said the tornado destroyed the North Woods Buffet, the tennis bubble on Universitv Boulevard and trail­ers temporarily housing the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute, located behind the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center. The campus day care center also sustained severe damage. 
Five people were rescued from the debris of the trailers located behind the Arts Center, Bowers said. Search dogs and thermal imaging cameras were used to make sure no one else was trapped in the rubble. 
At least 2,500 students were displaced yesterday when six dorms were evacuated for more than five hours due to damage from the storm, campus

CHICAGO: 
spokesman George Cathcart said. Students were allowed to return at about 11 p.m. Residents of University Courtyard were unable to return to their residences last night and the campus made no contingency plan to house them. 
"We do have damage in prob­ably six resident life buildings," Cathcart said. 
"None of it is really serious it seems at this point -trees on porches, [roofing materials] pulled loose, broken windows." 
Bowers reported moderate damage to the dorms. Many dorms lost power yesterday, but Cathcart said most power had been returned to the dorms last night. Power at the Courtyard had not been restored last night and PEPCO reported 17,000 customers in Prince George's County without power. 
"The damage is really severe," PEPCO spokesman Makini Street said. "We've got crews working into the night." 
Cathcart confirmed the two fatalities and said that other campus injuries were "mostly cuts and nothing serious." Some injuries were treated at the 
University Health Center and others were transported to Washington Adventist Hospital. 
Calvin Meadows, a meteoro­logical technician with the Baltimore-Washington office of the National Weather Service, said a tornado estimated to be traveling at about 40 miles per hour moved from Stafford County, Va., through Washington and into northern Prince George's County. He said the tornado touched down in Beltsville at 5:20 p.m., in College Park at 5:24 and in northern Laurel at 5:45. Meadows confirmed the fatali· ties and said there were reports 

of damaged houses, downed 
poles and overturned cars . 
throughout Prince George's 
County. 

Meadows said the tornadoes were not a surprise and warn ings were issued at about 5:10 
p.m. for Northern Prince George's County. He said high pressure over the past several davs has caused moisture over the Eastern Sea Board. 
That moisture, combined with a cold front, triggers a tornado. The area around Denton Hall and the Arts Center looked like a war zone. Guard houses were destroyed, trees strewn along the roads, light posts foiled, and trucks, cars and other vehicles overturned with windows blown out. 
A group of three construction trailers, maintained by Turner Construction, which has been working on the Arts Center, were ·completely destroyed along with cars parked along­side them. The trailers normal Iv house 45 offices, officials s·aid. Campus President C.D. Mote Jr. said seven people were inside the trailers at the time the tornado hit but were all accounted for. Some of the peo pie suffered injuries. 
Mote was sitting in his office when the tornado hit. He said he saw it move across the President's residence. He then left the building and went over to the Performing Arts Center where his wife was. Mote also toured the area where the trail ers were destroyed. 
"It's total devastation," he said. "[The tornado was] impressive in its voracity."

A..sociated Press 
ISLAMABAD 
With Osama bin Laden exhorting followers to stay "steadfast on the path of jihad" -holy war -the hard-line Taliban government warned the Americans yesterday that they were "igniting a fire that will burn them" if they attack Afghanistan. 
In signs of an intensify­ing showdown over Afghanistan's refusal to surrender bin Laden, the prime suspect in the dev­astating terror attacks on the United States, the Taliban drastically cur­tailed the activities of the remaining United Nations relief workers inside Afghanistan, and neigh­boring Pakistan pulled its diplomats out of the Afghan capital, Kabul, in what could be a prelude to severing diplomatic ties. 
The Taliban, who con­trol more than 90 per­cent of Afghan territory, have been battling a northern-based opposi­tion alliance for control of strategic areas north of Kabul. Heavy exchanges of mortar and artillery fire could be heard Monday in the Panjshir Valley, 45 miles north of the Afghan capi­ta!. 
The United States and its allies have increased contacts with those forces in preparation for a possible assault on both bin Laden's bases and his Taliban hosts. 
Bin Laden's latest call to arms came in a state­ment provided Monday to Qatar's Al-Jazeera satel­lite channel, which the exiled Saudi multimillion­aire and accused terror­ist mastermind often uses to communicate with the outside world. 
"I announce to you, our beloved brothers, that we are steadfast on the path of jihad with the heroic, 
faithful Afghan people," said the· statement, signed by bin Laden and dated Sunday. 
Bin Laden called on "our Muslim brothers in Pakistan" to do their utmost "to push the American crusader forces from invading Pakistan and Afghanistan." 
The Taliban have rebuffed U.S. demands to hand over bin Laden in the wake of Sept. 11 sui­cide strikes that toppled the twin towers of the World Trade Center and wrecked one wing of the Pentagon. Bin Laden has twice denied involvement in the terror attacks.

As another deterrent, some classrooms at Bentley have technology that allows teach­ers to capture a student's e­mails or instant messages and display them on a large screen for the whole class to see. 
The software doesn't censor which sites a student can visit on the Internet. Instead, a pro­fessor can choose whether classes have access to the entire Internet or just the school's internal network. Professors can also block out e-mail and instant messaging. 
Babson math professor Joe Aieta said his students have told him the temptation to use the Internet during class is too great when it is at their finger­tips. That's why Aieta occa­sionally limits their access. 
"They think they can keep up with the classwork while send­ing aiid receiving messages," Aieta said. "But they acknowl­edged that it didn't always work so well."

Study: Drunken driving rising 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The number of people killed by drunken drivers increased last year for the first time in five years. according to federal data released Monday. 
Overall highway deaths increased slightly in 2000 to 41,812, up from 41,717 in 1999. according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. forty percent of those, or 16,653, involved alcohol, u_p from 38 percent, or 15,976, the previ­ous year. 
It is only the second time alcohol-related deaths have increased since 1986, when 24,045 people were killed. The number of deaths rose 4 per­cent from 1994 to 1995, although an overall rise in the number of deaths kept the per­centage of deaths that involved alcohol at the same level.

We continue to grieve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States. Feehng numb, angry, and sad are all normal expressions of adjustment to loss. There is no single right way to get through a tragedy like this. One way is by connecting with others and exchanging stories about how we have been affected. Catastrophic tragedies can also trigger feelings of grief related to our past experiences with loss and trauma. Understanding and dealing with grief that comes up from both current and past losses is important for making sense out of our reactions ... and for healing. 
Drop in this Wednesday September 26th at 4:00 to connect 
with other students who are grieving. Come hear about how we can grieve, cope, take care of ourselves, and take care of each other. Come for yourself; come for your friends.

U.S. military restarts exercises in Vieques · 
Associated Press 
VIEQUES, Puerto Rico 
F-18 jetfighters dropped non­explosive training bombs on the Vieques range Monday in the first full-scale military exercises since the United States declared war on terrorism. 
Protesters toned down their demonstrations against military training on the island range in a show of solidarity with the victims of the attacks in New York and Washington, and on l'vlonday the 20 protesters on hand prayed for peace. 
"We think war isn't the solu tion," said Maria de los Angelos Fonseca. "The problem· is that now the United States can say Vieques is necessary." 
Nevertheless, some other pro­testers cut through 60 feet of Navy fence on Sunday night. No one was arrested, and th~ Navy said the fence was quickly repaired. 
Opponents say the Navy bom­bardments harm the environ­ment and residents' health. The Navy denies its exercises harm Vieques, where 9,100 people live in a civilian sector separat­ed from the firing range by 10 miles of forested hills. 
The Navy has used Vieques for six decades, training sailors for major conflicts from World War II to the Gulf War. 
On Mondav, F/A-18 Hornet fighter bombers dropped 500­pound and 25-pound inert bombs on the Vieques range, said Navy spokesman Lt. Corey Barker. 
Earlier, the guided missile destroyers USS The Sullivans and USS Spruance fired inert 5­inch shells at the range. 
Understanding Our Grief ... in the wake ofoyr nation's tragedy & other losses we have experienced Support Group Wednesdays 4:00 -5:15 

The Navy had used live bombs until a Marine jct dropped two bombs off target in 1999, killing a Puerto Rican guard on the range and igniting a storm of protest that contin ues. 
Those fatal exercises involved the USS John F. Kennedy, the aircraft carrier participating in the current exercise with about 12,000 sailors and its battle group of cruisers, destroyers, frigates and attack submarines. 
The training on Vieques has taken on a new significance since President Bush warned the U.S. military to be ready for conOict. 
Most protest groups agreed not to invade Navy lands out of unity with the attacks' victims and for security reasons. In the past, h.undreds of people were arrested for trespassing, prose­cuted and jailed. 
At the gate of Camp Garcia. where protesters often congre· gate, the Navy posted sailors with a machine gun mounted on the back of a truck. 
In a nonbinding referendum in July, nearly 70 percent of Vieques voters said the Navy should leave immediately. A binding federal referendum scheduled for November would ask islanders whether the Navy should leave in 2003 or stay· and pay $50 million for infra­structure and public works pro­jects. 
A House defense bill currently under consideration in Washington would cancel the November referendum and require the Navy to continue training on Vieques until an equivalent site is found. 
A vote is expected this week.

~ What is the Catholic position on War? 
In rhe past two weeks as the shock of the great tragedy of the terrorist at­tack on New York and Washington has given way to outrage and anger, the question ofwar, even a new kind ofwar, has become the central focus of our nation. There is among us a dawning awareness of the coming conflict. What is the Christian response to such horrific aggression? The Church always presumes against war. In the first centuries of the Church, during the age of Roman persecutions, Christians preferred mar­tyrdom to military service. Christians were essentially pacifists. They remem­bered the words of our Lord, "But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." (Mc. 5:22) However, after the conversion of Constantine s.nd the Roman Empire to Christianity, and especially as the Em­pire faced succeeding waves ofmilitary invasions, Christian thought began to seek a balance between the presump­tion against violence and the need to defend society as a whole and especially the innocent. The Just War Theory which the Church employs even today has its roots in St. Augustine and still heavily influences modern thought on the proper limits of military engagement. It seeks to minimize both the occasions of armed conflict as well as limit the destructiveness of such conflicts when they do occur. 

To declare war justly, the theory demands the following limits. All dip­lomatic alternatives must be exhausted. War may be engaged only as a defen­sive measure, to correct a wrong suf­fered. It may be waged only by a legiti­
mate political au­thority rather than by independent groups or organiza­tions within soci­ety. Lastly, a war may be justly fought only if there is a reasonable ex­pectation of suc­cess. 
Once a war has been declared, the Just War Theory places demands on the ways in which war may be fought ever, during the past century we on numerous occasions have flaunted these principles. Saturation bombing in Germany and North Vietnam, not too mention the nuclear assaults on Japan, are lasting examples of the tar­geting of civilians. 
This is an extraordinarily complex issue which stems from the Church's historical attempt to grapple with the Gospel ofJesus and the example of the early Christian community on rhe one hand, and the practical need to pro-
Today the Church recognizes the legitimacy of Christian's pacifist's conscience as a fidelity to the Gospel. It also appreciates the need to defend one's nation against all unjust attack. 

as well. Because a just war can only be defensive in nature, all targets of ag­gression must be limited to military personnel and equipment. The prin­ciple of proportionality requires that the good of victory must not be out­weighed by the destruction employed to achieve it. 
The principles of the Just War Theory shape the way we think ofwar, today more than ever. It is hard to imagine the U.S engaging in a war to­day that is not defensive. The modern smart bombs were designed, at least in pare, to limit civilian casualties. How-

vide for a defense against aggression. Today the Church recognizes the le­gitimacy of Christian's pacifist's conscience as a fi­delity to the Gos­pel. le also appre­ciates the need to defend one's nation against all unjust attack. 
As we prepare for an extended conflict against people whose be­
liefs have justified wars of terror, we should, in the spirit of the Gospel, be tireless in our efforts to seek non-vio­lent means of achieving and preserv­ing a new peace. When military solu­tions are required, we must seek to limit them, as much as possible, to actions which do not seek vengeance bur are clearly aimed at preventing future trag­edies of terror.

Pass on diversity and hospitality 
Bike-Aid taught me more than how to fix a flat in under two minutes or how to draft off of fellow riders. Biking approx­imately 70 miles per day, six days per week, I had the chance to visit almost 60 different com­munities this sum­

better and how to appreciate diversi­ty. 
When we arrived in Kansas City. Mo., Bike-Aid teamed up with a group called Hate Busters, who would join us for the ride across Missouri. This group works to call attention to hate crimes and to show that people of different races and religions can live and work together in peace. The Christian Foundation for Children and Aging invited all 35 bikers to stay at their headquarters in Kansas City. The Heart of America Indian Center made tacos for our dinner. All of the faith communities in greater Kansas City gathered for a human family reunion the following night to kick off our Missouri ride. 
At the dinner, a woman who told us to call her Mom greeted us. The burly African-American woman, who later revealed to us that she is the mother of 12 children, gave each of us a huge hug when we met her. embracing us as though we were her own children. With her amazing gospel voice. Mom McFarlane sang her rendition of "Pass it on" and set us all smiling. swaying and reaching out to one another. "I shout it out, from the mountain top. I want you to pass it on," she proclaimed to us. We were to pass on the love and hospitality from that community in Kansas City to all people we were to meet on the way to D.C. 
The next morning our ceremony on the south steps of City Hall was bathed in bright sunlight. Television and news­paper reporters vied for our attention. A phalanx of motorcycle police raced ahead to block every intersection for the next three miles so that we could get out of the city safely. Whistles and cheers came from doorways. street cor ners and cars, from people of different colors, ages and incomes. From my bike that morning, the world looked perfect and united. It was a Camelot moment. 
We stayed in Warrensburg that night. where home stays were arranged. By twos and threes we went home with strangers who by morning were family. The following night we were hosted by the Women's Democrat Club and invited to a concert in the park in Sedalia. Christians United for Racial Equity (CURE) invited us to dinner in Jefferson City. and we lingered there long. The focus of the Bike-Aid ride, "viewing the 
U.S. through an anti-racist lens," matched well with CURE's goals and beliefs. 
The next morning we biked 75 miles up Highway 94, where the Marthasville Community Club fed us and offered us beds for the night. It was a free night, so bike maintenance, letter writing and phone calls finished my night off. and I fell fast asleep by 10 p.m. 
As the sun was rising a few of us were already on our bikes. heading for St. Louis. hoping to be1,1,t the heat expected that day. The Pilgrim Congregational Church had a feast prepared for us that evening to celebrate the end of the First Annual Heart of America Interfaith and Interracial Bicycle Tour. which is what the Bike-Aid and Hate Buster dual ride across Missouri was ofiicially titled. Youth Against Hatred and Violence per­formed a short concert for us following dinner, where they sang folk music fit­ting into our theme of racism. 
Then came a special guest. Yes, Mom McFarlane drove all the way across Missouri Lo once again sing the same song she always sings, "Pass it on." The song worked its usual magic on us and literally sent chills up my spine. I know that every note she hit and every word she sang came straight from her heart. The Hate Busters departed the next morning to head home to Kansas City, and Bike-Aid headed for Washington, D.C. 

This is only the experience I had in one of 11 states that I biked through this summer. and I wish I could share more. I've come to believe that diversity and hospitality are twin virtues in this world. I'm a Roman Catholic and a Caucasian. and I come from a low­income background. If I were to always rely on people who are just like me. I would learn very little about the world. I can't describe how humbling it was to be welcomed by such a variety of churches. families and communities across the country. I never before imag­ined that complete strangers could be so hospitable. 
Bike-Aid made me think about life at Notre Dame in a different way. We might not have the most diverse student body, but we can learn from the stu­dents who are here from different coun­tries or from minority students to whom we have never talked before. We all walk on the same campus and pass by one another day after day, but how often do we step outside of our comfort zone and meet someone new? 
Our differing races, faiths and eco­nomic backgrounds may set us apart from one another. but they can also bring us all together to share our insights. our burdens and our aspira­tions. Pass it on.

Taxes burden the common man 
Sitting down to write this column, I had no idea. what I should even Lalk about. I talked to friends who all had some pretty good ideas. but when I think about it everything seems to have a lesser importance after Lhe events of two weeks ago today. 
John Litle 

First off, I am not writing about the World Trade Center; 
Frankly

Mike Marchand pretty 
Obnoxious

much said everything I wanted to say Monday. 
Instead I will write about something that affects us all and is completely unrelated. As one wiser than myself said, we've been reminded that we're human, but that doesn't stop us from living our lives. So without further adieu ... 
Taxes are choking the life out of the com­mon man. Believe it or not, there was a time when one person's wages could comfortably support an entire family. Now, I look at my pay stub from my summer job (I am in a low, low tax bracket mind you) and notice that anywhere from $100 to $200 is missing each and every pay period. 
This of course begs the question "What has Uncle Sam done for me in the last two weeks that is worth $200?" As you might have guessed, the answer is nothing. Nothing that the government has done for me is worth that much money in two weeks. Period. And I'm really not paying that much. This makes me angry. 
At the beginning of this year, there was much controversy raised over George W. Bush's executive order stopping the funding of abortions overseas. Much hullabaloo went into this, but no thought. You see, the real question is why am I paying for any overseas parenthood clinics, abortive or not? That's your money and mine they are just giving away; it didn't just appear out of thin air. Same goes for a few of the other controver­sies brimming in the past few months. Everyone goes into situations like stem cell research with the idea of "Where should we spend this money?" instead of the obvious question "Should we spend this money at all?" 
Personally, I think there are four things that I am willing to pay for my government to do for me. 

First, I will pay for national dcfonsc. That is something we all take for granted but that is very imporLant and can't be provided by a free market. We should fund thLc, sector and fund it well. 
Second is infrastructure. Things like roads and bridges just can't really be provided for everyone fairly unless the government han­dles them. 
Third is education. I think it is important to fund education but to use a free enterprise system of education which would include a take-it-or-leave-it vcmcher system (that is, if a school accepts a voucher, it may not accept any other monetary payment in addition). 
Lastly, I will pay for primary government funciions. That is, making, enforcing and interpreting laws. A free market can more efficiently provide everything else. If I feel generous I can donate money to the overseas parenthood clinics of which I approve. I don't need a big government intermediary decid-· ing which charity causes for me to support. 
That in mind, I will get back to my original point. The common man cannot survive when the government steals from him all he can earn. Income tax relief does nothing for the common man. It is payroll tax that needs reformation. Tax-free day is mid-May now. That's half a year working for the govern­ment. So they can do what? Spend it on some guy who's never bothered to get a job, waste it on flu shots in Uzbekistan and pay off every nation in the world that can do nothing but criticize and complain about the United States while at the same time accept­ing millions of dollars in "aid" every year. Well, I'm not buying it, and you shouldn't be either.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Band performance thrills and inspires 
I have been a close observer of marching band performances, usually at Notre Dame Stadium, but have never been as thrilled, proud and emo­tionally involved as I was last Saturday, thanks to the remarkable perfor­mance of the Band of the Fighting Irish and the magnificent show designed and executed by Dr. Kenneth Dye in cooperation with counter­parts at Michigan State. 
While every marching and behind-the-scene member justly deserves praise for their musicianship, marching and demeanor incorporated into such an unusual and challenging ceremony, I particularly cite Tambre Paster for her skillful mastery of the true role of a drum major, that of absolute marching, formation and musical leadership. Such was specially significant as she, a student, (not a faculty band director) conducted the massed Notre Dame-Michigan State bands, while the hands of four assis­tant directors locked to her tempos and the eyes of hundreds of musi­cians and more than 80,000 spectators watched, sang and even cried a bit at the emotion generated by the exceptional performance of Sept. 22. 
I was particularly moved inasmuch as 1 too led the band through the tunnel for the first time as Notre Dame drum major when we made our Stadium entry in 1942, the first since our country entered World War II. I know the feeling. I also know the humility and the pride. Thank you and your staff, Dr. Dye, thank you Tambre, thank every one of you bandsmen. and women for being Notre Dame and making it all happen again. We won that war of 60 years ago you know, and together we will win this one too. 
For God, Country and Notre Dame.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
This is not a time for peace 
I was deeply saddened and outraged by the tragic ter­rorist attacks in our great country against innocent men, women and children on Sept. 11. 
I was inspired by the courage, selflessness and spirit of the American people -from the heroes aboard United tlight 93, to the NYPD firefighters, to the small groups of Boy Scouts waving American flags in my town last Saturday. 
Then I read your editorial section on Sept. 17, specifi­cally an article from Mr. Aaron Kreider. I was stunned by the perspective of this graduate student that terrorists are reasonable people not to be blamed because the United States and allies controlled world economic and political systems spawning conditions for such behavior. In addition, he implies the key elements of this control, the U.S. CIA and military, should not be allowed on Notre Dame's Catholic campus. Mr. Kreider's sweeping gener­alizations attempt to take advantage of the terrible tragedy to quickly pass judgment on our government, intelligence agencies and military without coherentjusti­fication. 
Terrorists are not reasonable -they are psychopaths who are often very calculating. Early investigation reveals that unlike Mr. Kreider's description of destitute individuals suffering under U.S. oppression, these attack­ers are middle-class, well financed individuals with a fanatic hate for America. Michael Radu, a senior fellow at Foreign Policy Research Institute, specializing in the study of revolutionary and terrorist groups worldwide, writes that "the problem [these fundamental terrorists have] is not U.S. policy toward Israel, the Gulf or any­where else, the problem is the United States itself -not what we do, but who we are." 
A biographer of Osama bin Laden was asked in a recent interview, what could America do to satisfy bin Laden? His answer: "Move to another planet." Why? Because he foars what America represents: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of economic opportunity. While it is true that we must address the terrible economic conditions reflected in many parts of the world, the sources are primarily remnants of com­munism. colonialism. tribalism and religious fascism ­not "U.S. oppression." In fact, the United States has done more than any country in the world to improve living and working conditions for millions living in third world countries. On the other hand, what has Bin Laden done? If he were interested in helping, he would use some of his massive fortune to improve their status, not to feed a global terrorist network bent on destruction. 
Mr. Kreider's implication that Notre Dame should pro­hibit ClA recruiting and military ROTC is extremely self­serving. Is Mr. Kreider saying that the U.S. should not have an intelligence capability or military? Or that Notre Dame men and women should allow others to perform these vital roles for our country? 

I believe as we look back on the tragedies in New York and Washington, we will see the dismantling of the CIA's human intelligence capabilities in the '70s as a leading cause of our inability to stop the madmen -a disman­tling fueled by people like the author Mr. Kreider quoted, Mr. Agee, who later defected to Cuba. Finally, as an Notre Dame graduate of ROTC having served 27 years with the Air Force, I can verify that there is not a finer institution in this country than the U.S. military. I have seen the courage of fighter pilots under incredibly dan­gerous conditions going to great extremes tu avoid civil­ian casualties. I have seen the selflessness and character of thousands of our airmen conducting humanitarian relief operations around the clock throughout the world. 
Make no mistake, forces of evil have attacked and wounded our great country. They have challenged our very foundation as a freedom loving people. They are not reasonable people. As described in Ecclesiastes, 'To everything there is a season, and a time for every pur­pose under the heaven ... a time to kill, and a time to heal ... a time of war and a time of peace." This is not a time for peace.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Beta Band tone down psychedelic sound 
By SAM DERHEIMER 
Assistant Scene Editor 

Psychedelic trip-hop folk. lt doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But then again, neither do the Beta Band. And 'psychedelic trip-hop folk' may just be the best way lo describe the eclectic sound of this foursome of indie rockers from Edinburgh. 
Now, after a debut full-length album which the band themselves referred to as "F---ing awful" and "rushed," the Beta Band are back, slightly more mature (though not much}, and poised for a new assault on pop-rock. 
Hot Shots II marks a significant change in style 
and songwriting for the Beta Band. Rather than the dense, epic soundscapes that once cluttered Beta Band albums, Hot Shots cuts the lard, and is drasti­cally more focused -without losing any of the 1:asy melodies or hypnotic grooves that made past albums such underground hits. 
"We tried tQ condense the songs down from 15 or 30 minutes to four," lead vocalist Stephan Mason said to a Sonicnet reporter. "We wanled to make them more exciting to listen to rather than a pain in the butt." 
The effort is blatant. Mason, along with band­mates Robin Jones on drums, Richard Greentree on bass and John Maclean as DJ/sampler, have finally achieved a quality of sound that has seemed so elu­sive to the band in the past. llot Shots is a much

that  make  the

unique remain, only more refined, more direct. Smooth, spatial architecture is the rule on Hot Shots, rather than the exception. 
The band seemed to take an almost minimalist approach to writ­ing songs like "Gone" and "Squares." Soft, mellow guitar and piano compliment each other, and 
create an eerily com­forting sort of sound. 
Of course, it wouldn't be a 13eta Band record if there weren't a few funked­out psyche­delic jams as well. In "Broke," Mason whis­pers, "A sim­ple truth is all I ask for ... no· reply" above pulsing stereophonic throngs mixed with soft gui­tar and chimes.

"One," exemplifies the band's creativity and willing­ness to go against the conformity of modern rock. 
After opening for Hadiohead during their North American Amnesiac tour, and having their music prominently featured in the film "High Fidelity," Beta Band are paying their dues and slowly climb­ing the rungs of rock exsposure. This politically charged, groove oriented indie rock band has a serious future, and Hot Shots II puts them well on their way.

ALBUM REVIEW 
V marks the next step in the evolution of Live 


By TOM O'CONNELL Scene Music Critic 
Besides being a talented rock group, Live is known for its intense spiritual themes. Live has long been a band of searchers, mixing values and styles from both east and west. The band's fifth release, Vis defi­nitely an exploratory album. Unlike so many other bands, it asks questions instead of just giving answers. In this self-reflexive album, Live speaks candidly about its own personally journey -and it's not just a generic story of an average anonymous struggle. 
Being careful to avoid pretension, the band has no

answers. But after all, it's the journey, not the destination that really matters. 
Mixing hard rock, tripped-out rap

interludes and peaceful ballads, V does not lay down a series of radio-friendly easy hits. Singer/guitarist Ed Kowalczyk 
Radioactive Records
is an extremely charismatic front man, and fans can only hope he has what it takes to pull off an album like this. 
Rating
Luckily, he does and guitarist Chad_ 
Taylor, bassist Patrick Dahlheimer and drummer Chad Gracey provide Kowalczyk with plenty of support. 
From the earnest opening track "A Simple Creed," Live let their fans know just what they have in store for them. With eerie guest vocals from Tricky, the song sums it all up nkely; "We gotta love each other." Amen. 
"Deep Enough" is a pseudo-comic song full of bitter sexual tension. Though hurt, Kowalczyk can still laugh as he makes fun uf his ex's elderly new boyfriend: "Are those replacement hips?/ Is that a Swatch watch?" 
"People Like You" is an anthem for the music lover who will not com­promise. Refusing to conform to the empty mainstream glitter of today's popular music, the song gives hope for a better musical future. "Whatever it's gonna take/ Good luck, keep it real/ Where are the boys from LIVE?" 
Live has built its reputation and devoted fan base in part because of their mesmerizing live shows. "Transmit Your Love" speaks of their love of performing and how it keeps the band and their fans in tune with their message. "Transmit your love to me and/ Silently make me whole again." "OK?" begs the lis­tener to give up his 20th century 

"necessities" and find a way to live a no frills life, free of materialism. 
However, not everything on V is such an angry. hard tune. "Call Me A Fool" and "Nobody Knows" take the album down to a simmer, making good use of Kowalczyk's smooth and casual vocal abilities. In 1997, in a critical review of Live's third album, Secret Samadhi, "RollingStone" told the band to "Save the string section for the fifth album. boys." Well guess what? They did. And they did it well. "Overcome," a gorgeous ballad overflowing with quiet piano and a beautiful string ensemble, may be on par with Live's biggest hit, the 1994 classic "Lightning Crashes." 
What separates Live from so many other bands is that they are not afraid to make music that they know won't hit the top spot on the charts. They've already been there with 1994's six-times platinum Throwing Copper. Now, like REM, U2 and Pearl Jam before them, Live has spent some time in an experi­mental stage. 
It's always a conflict when a great band goes exper­imental. Part of you appreciates that they can evolve out of what made them famous, but sometimes you just wish your old friends were back. It takes guts to be at the top and then change direction, especially when everyone else is telling you to keep going straight. Sales may fall off, but at least you have your soul. To Live, that's far more important than money.

MEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 

Kangaroo defense hops ov~r Manorites 
By MATT FURRIE, KATIE KINNER and ANTHONY BISHOP Sports Writers 
Amidst the wind and rain. Keough's defense was just strong enough to pull off a 7 -0 victory over Morrissey. 
"I thought it was a really good first game," said Keough quarterback Andy Hess. "We executed our base offensive set.s and played extremely well on defense." 
The Kangaroo defense was on top of its game. By the time the game was over, it had picked off two passes, forced two fum­bles and sacked Morrissey quarterback Rick Ysasi three times. 
"Our defensive backs did a good job of keeping their quarterback in check all game long," said Hess. "Brian Adams and James Waechester were especially key with their interceptions." 
The first quarter of the game went by quickly ¥.ith each team's defense control­ling the tempo. But with the start of the second quarter, it began to rain, and with it came the first scoring opportunity. 
Following a Morrissey punt, Keough was set to start from its own 20. Two plays later, halfback Clay Nuelle broke free and trotted up the sideline for a 75-yard touch­down run. 
"The offensive line did a great job," said Nuelle, a freshman. "They blocked off the whole right side and I saw a opening so I took it and ran has hard as I could. Next thing I know I scored." 
The half ended with the Kangaroos up 7 ­0 after each team's defense dominated the rest of the half. 
The second half opened up with a reju­venated Morrissey offensive attack. Freshman halfback, Edward Hernandez Ill, got his first carries and made several impressive runs picking up much needed yardage. 
Despite this new attack, the results were still the same for the Manorites. 
Several well-orchestrated drives ended up in great field position, but none yielded any points. 
Coming into the final minutes of the game Keough was still up seven, but again their defense was being put to the test. 
Morrissey quarterback Ysasi, 5 of 11 passing, had put his inside the 10 after proving to be quite elusive in the pocket. But yet again Keough 's defense rose to the occasion. 
After nearly recovering a fumble inside of the 5 on second down, they came back and sacked Ysa.si on third down. The game ended with Nuelle being pulled down just yards short of the end zone. 
"I thought we played extremely well," said Morrissey coach Andy Baulm. "Unfortunately, they were able to break it open on the one big play and score. We'll do some fine tuning and stay hungry for a win next week." 
Keenan 6, Stanford 0 
An early touchdown may have proved decisive, but in a game plagued by 16 penalties and dominated by the run, it didn't seem to be the score that mattered. 
In Keenan's 6-0 victory against Stanford on Sunday, it was a battle of who hit hard­er, who made fewer mistakes and who wanted it more. 
Keenan scored on its opening drive despite three personal fouls. Freshman 
quarterback Patrick Downey scored  a  
touchdown on a six-yard run.  
Staying focused  was important in  a  

game filled with penalties, according to Keenan captain Brent Morlok. "We did a good job keeping our heads in the game," he said. Griffin penalties led to their defeat, according to Dave Dilworth. 
"I felt like we spotted them six points and started off in a hole and were never able to get our offense going," Dilworth said. 
Neither team was very successful on the offensive side of the ball, as both quarter­backs secured only two completions each. The running game was the focus for both teams. 
Running back Tom Corr shouldered the load for Keenan rushing on 11 carries. 
Stanford's Dan Campion and Mark McNamee had seven carries each, includ­ing key rushes on Stanford's final drive in the fourth quarter. 
Campion also doubled as a defender, grabbing one interception. 
Corner Greg Borchardt also contributed strongly to Stanford's defensive stand, holding Keenan receivers to two catches. 
"Our defense played well, we shut them down," said Dilworth, but the offense never got off its feet. 
Keenan linebacker Tim O'Brien was a key player in stopping Stanford's quarter­back Nick Befera and the option attack of Campion and McNamce. 
O'Brien tallied sacks on both of 
Stanford's second half drives, including 
their !inal attempt at tying the game. 
On Stanford's Iinal drive of the game, Keenan defenders insisted they had knocked the ball loose from the arms of Stanford's Campion on a second and five, but the referee signaled no fumble. 
While subsequent penalties allowed Stanford to continue towards the end zone. Keenan's veterans took charge and ended the drive with a sack by O'Brien and an interception on third and long by Matt Hotze. 
Junior O'Brien and the other veterans 
"did what they had to do to win the game," 
said Morlok. 
Dillon 6, Alumni 0 
In a rebirth of the Alumni and Dillon 
rivalry, neither team wanted to back 
down. It was a heated battle in which the 
Dillon Big Rod finally took control. Scoring 
a touchdown early in the game, Dillon led 
6-0 and never looked back. 
During Alumni's first possession, the Dawgs quickly showed the opposition that they meant business. They gradually marched down the field with quick run­ning. 
However, before they could capitalize off of these runs, an interception ended any threat of a score. He was taken down with 
·a hard hit by offensive lineman Larry Rooney. "The interception really took some wind out of our sails," Rooney said. 
A crowd of cheers and smiles quickly turned into a crowd of grimaces and groans. The fans of Alumni, or the "Dawg Pound" were quieted by Dillon for the rest of the game. 
On the ensuing drive by Dillon, Alumni received a personal foul, giving the Big Red 15 yards and the first down. 
That sparked the offense to march the rest of the way, winding down with a 2­yard run by Jason Visner to score the touchdown. The PAT attempt after the touchdown never made it to the goalposts, keeping the score at 6-0. 
After that, the two defenses tightened up. Both offenses began drives well, show­ing signs of a scoring opportunity, but the defense shut them down, stopping the offenses from getting into a scoring posi-


Neither team could set up a passing attack, as each team's offense could only muster two completions. 
Alumni drove close within scoring range late in the game, but the Dawgs fumbled to end the drive. The fumble and the inter­ception were both in Dillon territory. 
"The interception took away some momentum, and the fumble by [running­back Alex] Roodhouse may have been the final dagger," said Alumni captain Nick Linstroth. "We're just going to move on and prepare for Keough next week." 
Alumni faces Keough at 2 p.m. next Sunday and Dillon faces off against Keenan at 3 p.m. Both games will be at the southern Riehle field.

Bledsoe still in hospital after violent tackle 
JAPANESE BASEBALL 
Rhodes sets season home run record 
As,cx;iated Press 
TOKYO 

It took 37 years and a fastball over the middle of the plate for an American to finally equal Japan's single-season home run record. 
Former major-league outfield­er Tuffy Rhodes hit a solo shot into the right field stands at Osaka Dome on Monday for his 55th homer of the season, tying the single season mark set by the legendary Sadaharu Oh way back in 1964. 
After rounding the bases, Rhodes bowed his head and tipped his cap to the roaring crowd of 48,000. Some fans waved placards depicting Rhodes in his black and orange Kinetetsu Buffaloes uniform. 
Few thought that a foreign player would ever be allowed to break Ob's hallowed record. 
Even though he's of Taiwanese ancestry. Oh is revered in Japan. He helped lead the nation's most popular team. the Yomiuri Giants. to nine straight Japan Series titles between 1965 and 1973 and finished his career with 868 homers over 22 sea­sons. 
The last time a foreign player came dose to breaking Oh's record was in 1985 when Randy Bass of the Hanshin Tigers hit 
54. Bass' last two games of the season were against the Giants, who were managed by Oh at the time. 
Not surprisingly, he was walked six times in nine at-bats. At one point, Bass stood at the plate with his bat held upside down in protest of what many considered to be a conspiracy among teams to keep an American from breaking Ob's record. 
But Japanese baseball has come a long way since then. The success of players like Ichiro Suzuki, Hideo Nomo and Kazuhiro Sasaki in the major leagues has given Japanese players the confidence to go head-to-head with Americans like Rhodes. 
Hard-throwing Daisuke Matsuzaka -who at 22 wasn't even born yet when Oh hit his record-breaking homer -gave up Monday's home run to Rhodes in Kintetsu's 7-6 victory over the Seibu Lions. Matsuzaka is considered talented enough to possibly join other Japanese in the majors one day. 
With five games remaining in the season, the odds of breaking the record appear to be in Rhodes' favor and Oh, who now manages the Pacific League's Daiei Hawks, has repeatedly said it's time for someone to take his place in the record books. 
For a while, it looked like Rhodes would suffer the same fate as Bass. Rhodes hit his 54th homer on Sept. 13 and then went almost two weeks without hitting another home run. 
"I put a lot of pressure on myself over the past six games, but I finally got one," said Rhodes, a 33-year-old native of Cincinnati. 
The Buffaloes sit in first place in the Pacific League standings, 3 V2 games ahead of the Lions and are bidding for their first pennant since 1989. Coincidentally, they will play their last two games of the sea­son on Sept. 30 and Oct.1 against Oh and his defending champion Hawks at Fukuoka Dome. 
Playing in his sixth season with the Buffaloes. Rhodes is the elder statesman among Japan's foreign players. Before this sea­son, his best year was 1999, when he hit 40 homers.

Drew Bledsoe spent his second day in the hospital Monday and was expected to miss at least two games because of internal bleeding in his chest following a tackle. 
The New England Patriots' quarterback was in stable condi­tion after being taken to Massachusetts General Hospital on Sunday night. Doctors used a chest tube to alleviate the bleed­ing. 
Bledsoe was knocked out of the game by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis in the fourth quarter of New York's 10-3 win.

The Belles will play come rain or shine. For the fifth consecutive home game, the Saint Mary's soc­cer team has to play under ques­tionable. weather, but this time they're ready. 
"We 're comfortable with our field." junior captain I-leather Muth said. "It's no help that we've had rain every time we've had a home game, but I think we're starting to get the hang of it and starting to be able to overcome it." 
The Belles will take on the Scots of Alma in a match that promises to be a fight to the finish, even if the predicted rain makes an appearance. The Scots have faced a similar MlAA schedule as the Belles, with similar results. They come into today's match 0-4 in the MIAA, just behind the Belles who are 0-3 in the conference. 
"I think [Alma] is a little under­estimated in our conference," Johnston said. "It's going to be a tough battle. They're playing real­ly tough right now." 
The past four home games the Belles have hosted have been marked by cold rain. The first three games against Hope, Calvin and Kalamazoo resulted in Saint Mary's losses, but the most recent game had different results. 
Saint Mary's claimed its first win of the season, a 4-3 home vic­tory against Rose-Hulman on Sunday. 
Strong Saint Mary's play con­nected for four goals, but all three times Rose-Ilulman scored, the ball found its way to the net because of Saint Mary's errors that were compounded by the weather. 
"I think some of our mi.-6takes [Sunday! came because we mis­judged because of the weather," Lynn Taylor said. 
Today they arc looking to stop those errors. 
"Keys to winning are minimizing mistakes and ball possession, [both of which are] playing to our strengths," Johnston said. 
In addition to minimizing their mistakes. the Belles are hoping home field advantage helps with the win. 
"That's a strength of ours [that] we're going to capitalize on and run them all over the field," Muth said. 
Alma plays physical soccer, a kind of game the young Saint Mary's team has been working to improve on all season. The Belles' MIAA opener against a physical Hope team was a surprise to many of the first-year players, but Johnston believes his team is ready for physical play. 
"They're fairly physical," he said. "We're used to that now. A lot of our freshmen are accus­tomed to the style of college play." 
Action gets under way today at 4 
p.m. on the Saint Mary's soccer fields.

Holiday 
continued from page 24 
at the media attention surround­ing Notre Dame's newest starting quarterback. 
But Notre Dame's offensive woes arc no laughing matter for Davie. He spent a sleepless Saturday night watching game film of Notre Dame's 17-10 loss to Michigan State. And after studying that film for hour after hour, he and the rest of the Irish coaches. believed it was time for Holiday to have a chance to con­trol the Irish offense. 
"There's a lot more pressure, but that's what I've come here for," Holiday said. "I like pres sure. I like competing and hope­fully I can get some points on the board." 
In Notre Dame's two losses, the Irish have only managed to score two touchdowns. Each touch­down was set up not by pro­longed offensive drives, but by solid special teams play. Against Nebraska, Shane Walton's blocked punt gave the Irish the ball on the Husker four-yard line. And against Michigan State, Julius Jones returned a punt 56 yards to the Spartan six-yard line. 
"The bottom line -and it is a bottom line -is we're just not scoring enough points," Davie said. "l thought Matt Lovecchio played good at times Saturday. In some ways, it may not be the most fair thing, but the bottom line is we're not scoring enough points." 
Offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers broke the news to Lovecchio and Holiday just before Monday's practice. The coaches didn't tell the team until after practice. 
"Like anything else, the quar­terback gets too much blame and too much credit," Rogers said. "[Matt's] fi.rst comment to me was, 'Coach we're not scoring points, something has to be done."' 
"It's the coaches' decision," LoVecchio said. 'Tm just going to go with it and work as hard as I can to do what I have to do to help this team and get better ... I think the responsibility of being the quarterback at Notre Dame, you've got to move the ball down the field and you've got to score points. We didn't do that Saturday and that's the bottom 
lin ,.
e. The Irish feel more confident starting Holiday now as opposed to the beginning of the season because he has some game expe­rience. While he only played two series against Michigan State, Holiday played several series against Nebraska, leading Notre Dame on a 64-yard game -its longest of the game -that cul­minated in a Nick Setta field goal. 

But Holiday was promoted because Notre Dame hasn't made any big offensive plays. Notre Dame's longest passing play was a 19-yard completion to David Givens in the·season open­er. while Tony Fisher's 35-yard run against the Huskers is still Notre Dame's longest play from scrimmage. 
And against Michigan State, Rogers was conservative in his play calling the Irish attempted only one pass over 20 yards and rushed on first down 15 of 18 times. 
"It's our whole mentality right now," Rogers said after Saturday's loss. "I just think we're a little fragile right now as far as [the passing game] is con­cerned. I just think there's a lack ·of confidence until you start hav­ing some success ... You try to take care of the football, you try to run the ball, you try to keep the defense out of bad situations and all of a sudden, you're in a shell and you're not a very excit­ing offense." 
"We've got to try to get some more explosions, some more big plays," said Davie. "We need to take the next step, and hopefully this will work." 
The Irish hope Holiday can add that excitement. While Rogers said the offense will not have to make many changes, he did say that Holiday would probably be the only quarterback to play Saturday. 
Both Davie and Rogers stressed that Lovecchio still has the possi­bility to earn his starting job back. And while Davie said Jared Clark is still in the quarterback mix, Rogers was a little more blunt about what it would take to see Clark in the game. 
"Hopefully, we're ahead by a lot of points," he said. 
But for now, the spotlight is on Holiday, not the other two quar­terbacks. He took his turn on the sideline last year while LoVecchio ran the offense and he watched from afar as Lovecchio answered the media's questions. Now, it's his turn.

MEN'S SOCCER 

Irish to take on Braves 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Spores Writer 
The men's soccer team heads to Peoria, Ill., tonight for a_con­test with No. 22 Bradley (4-2-1). 
After dropping a 3-0 loss to Rutgers Saturday, the Irish will be looking to get back into the win column before picking up with Big East play again this weekend. 
"It's always tough [to lose]. especially because we're a young team," co-captain Greg Martin said. "But our heads are up right now. We've got a big game against Bradley, and then this weekend we get back to Big East competition, so we're defi­nitely ready to go and things will be line." 
Notre Dame better be ready to go again, as Bradley brings a very talented team to the lield. The Braves return seven starters from a 2000 squad that went 15-7-2 and earned the program's first NCAA tourna­ment bid. They have a very high-powered offense led by a pair uf All-American forwards, Gavin Clinton and Hamid MehreioskoucL The duo com­bined for 26 goals and 24 assists last season, ranking them third in the nation as a returning scoring duo. 
"We're going to have to be very disciplined because they are a very good team," head coach Bobby Clark said, "They're a very blue-collar team in that they are very hard work­ing, so we are going to have to work just as hard to win." 
The Irish defense should be well prepared for the Bradley offense, having already faced some of the nation's most potent attacks in the likes of Furman and Clemson. 
If there were one area the Irish would want to exploit, it would be the Braves' inexperi­ence at the goalkeeper position. Bradley lost .its three-year starter at the end of last season, and the most experienced returnee is fifth-year senior Nate Adams. who has only nine career appearances. 

This could benefit Notre Dame's leading scorer, forward Erich Braun, who is very aggressive at taking scoring opportunities when he gets the ball. Braun has taken 17 shots on goal in the team's first five games. 
In the only other match-up between these two teams, the Braves came into South Bend last season and handed the Irish a 3-1 loss on the strength of two goals from Glinton, Bradley is expecting its largest soccer crowd ever in anticipation of tonight's rematch. 
"This is what it's all about ­going on the road during the season against the good teams and getting results," Clark said. "It would be a tremendous step forward for the program if we could get a result out of this."

Farley a·nd Lewis have something in common: they both fell prey to Walsh's tough defense in two tied games during the past two weeks. Tonight, they'll each be look ing for more offensive produc­tion when they square off against each other on West Riehle Field at 8 p.m. 
"Our offense had some tro11­ble getting together in the first half,· and once we got it together in the second half, we couldn't convert," said Lewis free safety and team captain Caitlin Murray. "We have a good group of experi­enced receivers who can be lethal if we get on the same page." 
If the Lewis offense does plan to convert tonight, it will have to go through a Farley defense that intercepted Walsh Hall four times two weeks ago. 
That defense, coached by Alumni residents Irish Thompson and Chris Cordes, includes freshman comerback Heather Kimmins, who con­tributed two of the intercep­tions. 
'Tm hoping our defense will keep up what we've been doing and get the offense jump-started," said Kimmins. 
That Farley offense nearly put the baJl in the endzone, but the touchdown was called back, according to Farley cap­tain Beth McKay. 
Trying to prevent touch­downs of any kind will be Lewis' defense, led by line­backers Kara Helmig, Becky Camillus, and Becky Ward, even be able to field a team for the game. 

"I don't know if we're even playing at this point because a couple people can't make it," said Ross. 
On the other side of the ball, the Chaos feels optimistic about lhe rest of their season. 
"I think that we're looking pretty good," said co-captain and quarterback Mandy Reimer. "I think we've made a lot of progress since the first practice." 
Cavanaugh also has another strategy that the players believe will lead the team tovictory. 
"The key to beating Off­Campus is to dress warmly, wear receiver gloves and pray it doesn't rain," said Reimer. "And if it does rain, we're all going to wear cleats." 
Cleats or no cleats, Off­Campus isn't taking this game too seriously. 
"[This season'sJ been a lot of fun so far," said Ross. "We all get to play the whole game." 
McGlinn vs. Walsh 

For McGlinn, The Wild Women of Walsh will not be their only opponent this Tuesday on Reihle Field. The Shamrocks will have to battle their own inexperience in game situations. 
Going into Tuesday's game, McGlinn will only have played one game, a loss to Cavanaugh, while Walsh will have three games under its belt. 
"We've had a scheduling disadvantage this year," said McGlinn co-captain Christa Gray. "Our chemistry is good, but our nerves in game situa­tions has hurt us a little." 
Despite the perceived disad­vantage, the Shamrocks think they are ready for the game. 
"Our coaches have scouted 
[the Walsh] games, and we've 
had a chance to practice 
against their offenses and 
defenses," said Gray. 

McGlinn has been able to 
get in several practices this 
past week. They will also 
bring good communication 
and determination to the grid­
iron Tuesday night. 

On the other side of the ball, Walsh hopes to garner its sec­ond win with stalwart defense. 
"Our defense held Lewis 
scoreless, and we won against 
one of the best offenses in the 
league [Howard]," said Walsh 
co-captain Alison Troy. 

Walsh quarterback and co­captain Lauren Walsh and freshman wide , receiver Carrie Campbell will be head­ing the offense for the Wild Women. 
"Our offense is starting to click well. We've had quite a bit of improvement and we hope to carry the momentum into our next game," said Campbell.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Veselik, Ducks stamp out Crime 
By AARON RONSHEIM and MATT DeNICOLA 
Sports Writers 
On a rain-drenched Sunday afternoon at McGlinn Fields, the Howard Ducks defeated Off­Campus Crime 18-0 Sunday. 
Judging by the team's success in inclement weather Sunday, the Ducks didn't mind the rain at all. 
"We were definitely in our ele­ment," said Howard junior Jenna Spanbauer. 
Howard evened its record at 1­1 while Off-Campus dropped to 0-2 on the year. 
One of the keys to Howard's win was the play of Jill Veselik who returned to the Ducks roster this year despite moving off cam­pus. 
Veselik completed 7-15 passes with two touchdowns. She also had one rushing touchdown and added one reception. 
"I am really happy with the way we played," Veselik said. "The coaches did a groatjob play calling today." 
"She is definitely our leader," running back Katie Crawly said. "She sees the field so well and keeps the defense off-balanced. We are so glad she came back for one more year." 
After a slow start, the Howard offense began to click. On its third possession Veselik hit Crawly on a swing pass. Crawly turned a five-yard pass into a 50­yard touchdown as she sprinted down the sideline past Off­Campus defenders for 6-0 lead. Howard failed on the one-point conversion. 
The Ducks opened the second half with an impressive four-play scoring drive. 
The drive was capped by an impressive 30-yard scramble by Veselik. After being surrounded by Off-Campus defenders she escaped down the right sideline then cut all the way across the field to evade defenders as she sprinted into the end zone just inside the left pile-on. 
''It was amazing." Crawly said. "She does everything for us." 
Howard added another touch­down on a 15-yard pass from Veselik to freshman Megan O'Keefe. 
Veselik overshadowed a great performance by the Ducks' defense. The Ducks' defense didn't even let Off-Campus cross into its territory, and Off-Campus quarterback Abby Ross was 3-11 with tv.·o interceptions. 
"With the way our defense played it makes my job look easi­er," said Howard defensive coor­dinator Chris McBride. 
Lewis 0, Walsh 0 

The defenses can rest now and the offenses can get to work. 
Forty minutes went by in Sunday's game between Lewis and Walsh, which ended in a 0-0 tie. There were two halves, four quarters and countless unsuc­cessful drives toward the end zone. But in the end, the score­board did not change. 
Coming into the game, neither team knew what to expect from the other. 
"They played a different offen­sive set than we had ever seen," said Lewis captain Caitlin Murry. "It took just short of a full set to get used to it." 
The story was the same with the Wild Women. 
"The defense really stepped up," said Captain Alison Troy. "It really was a battle." 
In the beginning of the game, the Walsh offense came out fir-

8 
ing, and the intensity did not let up. In the second half, the Wild Women drove the ball right to the goal line, threatening to score. With four downs to score, Walsh looked certain to put points on the board. However, Lewis' goal line defense prevent­ed the score. 
"We really put up a fight on that goal line stand," said Murry. "That was really key." 
Lewis played tough third down defense. On one drive. the Lewis freshman inside linebacker made a huge stop on third and short, which forced the fourth down. 
"I think that was the turning point," Mun-y said. "It seemed to spark our defense and discour­age their offense." 
Despite the innumerable stops the Chicks made, they were unable to score. The execution from Lewis was off throughout the game. 
"When the quarterbacks were on, the receivers were off, and vice-versa," said Murry. "It was just that kind of day." 
But, credit the faltering offense to the Walsh defense. The cor­nerbacks stayed tight with the receivers, the rushers put con­stant pressure on the quarter­back, and the linemen rarely let a rush slip through. 
"It was a big day for the defense," said Troy. 
Despite the lack of offense, nei­ther team was disappointed with their performance. 
"I was happy with our perfor­mance," said Murry. "We were just on the verge of pushing through ... hopefully we can get on track."

WOMEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 
Bulldogs tame Lions, win 12-6 
By MATT MOONEY and BRIAN LONG 
Sports Writers 
The first play set the tone. 
When Badin sophomore quarterback Erin Zachary went deep and connected with wideout Amy Marshall, the Hullfrogs established a trend that would continue through­out their 12-6 victory over Lyons on Sunday. 
"We wanted to give our !young] quarterback some confidence. We had nothing to lose and wanted to go for it," Bullfrog Molly Norton said. 
Though Lyons prevented a score with a goal line stand. they could not stop the Bullfrogs' next drive. Marshall again plagued the Lions as she 1.ook the ball on an end around and scrambled untouched into the endzone. 
The Bullfrogs would add another touchdown in the sec­ond half, and Lyons never mounted a significant charge. 
Badin had the crucial edge of field position. While the Bullfrogs often found them­selves deep in their opponent's half of the field, Lyons had trouble advancing the ball. 
"Our defense did a good job of holding off their offense," said Norton. "It set up our offense and gave us opportuni­ties." 
Badin's offense put the team in a position where, even if it didn't score, it still pinned Lyons deep in its own territo­ry. Unable to muster anything against the Bullfrog defense, Lyons either punted or turned the ball over on downs on four of their five possessions. 
"Mentally, it took us awhile to get into the game. We had some penalties that hurt us and we had a short fourth down we didn't convert on," junior Lion Sarah Jenkins said. "But we're still opti­mistic. Last year it took us three games to score and we still came back and made the playoffs." 
Lyons' lone score in the con­test came off the game's only turnover. 
Near the end of the second half, sophomore Meghan Barloco picked off a Badin pass. Lyons managed to avoid the shutout as they put togeth­er their only sustained drive of the day. Quarterback Jenkins hooked up with Roxie Terevino on a short touch­down pass. A failed three point conversion ended the game. 

Afterward, Bullfrog Molly Norton said, "Our offense found its niche [in this game]. We had trouble in our first game. But we put in a lot of hard work in practice and it paid off." 
Welsh 18, Pasquerilla West 0 

Welsh Hall is back in the saddle. 
Despite the "rebuilding year" label that was slapped on the Whirlwinds, the reign­ing champs added another vic­tory on Sunday, putting away the Purple Weasels of Pasquerilla West 18-0. 
Welsh, now 3-0 on the sea­son, used an intricate offensive attack coupled with a tena­cious defense to overpower PW. 
Just two plays into the game, PW was already playing catch­up. Two Lauren Hoeck passes, for 18 and 42 yards, and the Whirlwinds found themselves up by six. 
The Weasels were not able to gain control on offensive either, as Welsh captain Vanessa Lichon intercepted a PW pass on the next posses­sion. 
Again, the Whirlwinds scored, taking advantage of Hoeck's cannon arm and a productive group of wide outs. 
PW, after giving up the quick strikes, settled down defen­sively. The offense, however, was unable to get anything going throughout the entire game. 
"We never really found our rhythm on offensive," said sophomore quarterback Leslie Schmidt. 
The lack of rhythm can be attributed to the Welsh defen­sive unit. A relentless pass rush was the key as several players, including Kat "El Gato" Wolohan, recorded sacks for the Whirlwinds.

Football takes back seat to bigger things in life 
Saturday was a special day in Notre Dame Stadium. For any­one that was there, vou don't need me to tell you that. 

It started with a ceremony to honor and pray for the victims and families of the victims of the :er­rorist attacks of two weeks ago. 
A collec­tion was taken from all the fans in atten­dance, and while no numbers are vet available, it will be amazi~g to see how generous 80,795 people can be. 
Maybe the most moving dis­play of all came at halftime, 


when two rival bands stood shoulder to shoulder, play­ing Amazing Grace. 
By these accounts alone, the Notre Dame­Michigan State game was a suc­cess. As a 
Marian High School mom told me a week and a half ago, while she watched her son play again, football helps bring back a sense of normalcy to all our Jives. 
As we've been shown these last two weeks, football takes a back seat to the bigger things in life". 
But in terms of football, in terms of the game played on the field, most people in Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday walked away confused. 
The Irish dropped their fifth straight to Michigan State. Notre Dame hasn't beaten the Spartans since Sept. 17th, 1994, when all of us, players and fans alike, were still stoked about drivers' ed. 
The offense did improve since that Nebraska game. It produced 280 yards and a 100­yard rusher in senior Tony Fisher, who outperformed MSU Heisman candidate T.J. Duckett. 
Senior split end Javin Hunter continued to impress everyone, reeling in any balls thrown within a few feet of him, high­lighted by a Charles Woodson­esque one-handed grab for the only Irish touchdown. 
But despite the improvement, the last half of that last sen­tence remains the offensive Rubiks cube still waiting to be solved: 
The Irish only scored one touchdown. 
The season touchdown tally now stands at two, with the longest "drive" being LoVecchio's six-yard scoring pass to Hunter on Saturday. 
The Notre Dame offense has only converted six of 29'third downs this year, a rate of 20.6 percent. 
And as long as I'm going to get statistical, I might as well go nuts and give voice to what a lot of Irish fans are wonder­ing. 
Consider the following num bers: in the Michigan State game, Notre Dame faced "first and 10" 31 times. 
They ran the ball on 26 of those occasions, including the first 15 in the first half (streak only broken by the six-yard touchdown tuss), and the first eight first downs in the second half. Notre Dame didn't pass on third down in the second half until they trailed 17-10 in the fourth. 
Conversely, Notre Dame 
But it's hard to deny that the offense is very predictable right now, and despite its marked improvement l'rom game one to two, the points still aren't coming. 
At that same press confer­ence, l stood inside an ever­tightening wall of reporters around quarterback Matt LoVecchio. I didn't ask any questions. I could hardly move or make out any faces. 
I can't imagine what it must have felt like f'or him or the players who thought post game boos were being directed at them. 
I hope that no one involved in Notre Dame football has to feel that again soon. 

There's just too many good people in the program for that to happen.

FOOTBALL 

Holiday to start against A&M 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Ao;sociate Spores Editor 

Irish head coach Bob Davie· named sophomore quar­terback Carlyle Holiday the starting quarterback for Saturday's game against Texas A&M. 
"We need a spark and we need some points," Davie said. "Carlyle is a guy who I think deserves the opportu­nity to provide that spark." 
[n Notre Dame's two losses to Nebraska and Michigan State, the Irish have been noticibly missh1g the capabili­ty to make big plays on offense. 
Davie hinted Sunday he was considering a change in quarterbacks. 
"Did we generate enough offense? No," hfl said. "Did we generate enough big plays? No. Was that Matt !LoVecchio'sl fault? That's a tough question to answer." 
Early Monday morning, Davie and the rest of the Irish coaches tried to answer that question. They ultimately decided that it would be better to start Holiday in place of LoVecchio to try to shake things up. And Holiday felt the effects immediately. 
Normally after practice, Notre Dame head coach Bob Davie is surrounded by about 10 reporters. While the rest of the football team files into the locker room, Davie patiently waits outside as he fields question after ques­tion about the Irish football team. 
But Monday afternoon, things were different. 

Only one reporter stood in front of Davie, who minutes befor_t: had announced that Holiday would start against Te=·&M.. ~he r?st were all crowded around Holiday, 
who d his weight from foot to foot as he stood with his han s--claspedj:iehind his back and answered every question hurled his way.

heavyweights tonight at Alumni Field. 
If anything, tonight's con­test will answer questions for the Irish. Though it enters the game at 5-0-1, Notre Dame has not shown much brilliant play over the first weeks in the sea­son, barely eking out games against less-touted opponents, including this past weekend's game against Villanova, where the Irish took almost 25 minutes of overtime to finally put away the over­matched Wildcats. 
Nebraska has recently rung up huge victories over lightly-regarded Northern 1-owa and EvansviUe. The Huskers did, however, take down top-ranked North Carolina in an exhibition match Aug. 25. 
Irish head coach Randy Waldrum knows that his team must pick up their level of play to beat the Huskers. · 
"We've got Nebraska coming in here on Tuesday, and we have to play better if we're going to have a chance against them," said Waldrum after this weekend's games. "Somebody really needs to step up and lead this team if we want to get where we need to be." 
Irish senior captain Mia Sarkesian described Nebraska's style of play as 
"direct." The Huskers will 
not try to finesse Notre 
Dame, and their "attack­
ing" style will require the 
Irish to concentrate on 
their focus. 
"We need to come out 
with intensity," said 
Sarkesian. "We need to 
play quickly." 
The Irish have been prac­
ticing to counteract the 
aggressiveness of the 
Huskers with discipline 
and skill. 
"We've been definitely 
preparing for them," said 
Sarkesian. "They're con­
stantly kicking and pres­
suring you." 
To effectively contain the Nebraska offense, the Irish will need to tighten up on defense. The back line is still looking for a cohesive set up among the Irish's many talented defenders, including junior Vanessa Pruzinksy and senior cap­.tain Lindsey Jones. and

O'Neill tops St. Eds for first-ever win 
By MATT LOZAR and JOE 
HETTLER 
Sports Writers 
Sept. 23, 2001 will go down in the history books of O'Neill Hall. 
The Angry Mob earned their first-ever interhall football victo­ry Sunday, winning 14-7 against St. Edward's. 
"They wanted it and they played with a lot of desire," said O'Neill coach Morgan Creppel. "The guys worked hard and they executed well." 
The Angry Moh mainly ran a ball control offense, but was able to pass the ball when they needed to. 
Quarterback Troy Mont­gomery only threw three passes. He completed each one to Kyle Johnson, two of them for touch­downs. 
"I don't deserve the credit anymore than anyone else," said Johnson. "The offensive line and quarterback were the reason for the great execution." 

Montgomery and Johnson con­nected on the winning touch­down. a 15-yard pass to put O'Neill up 14-7. 
"Kyle Johnson made a couple of great catches," Creppel said. "It was perfect execution," said Enterline. 
On' their first drive of the game, O'Neill called eight run­ning plays before a 25-yard touchdown pass from Montgomery to Johnson put them up 7-0. 
"We need to come out with a little more intensity," said St. Ed's captain Nick Sciola. "We knew they would come out fired up." 
SL Ed's came right back to tie the game at seven on a perfect 30-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Dan Tarsha to Kevin McNamara.
