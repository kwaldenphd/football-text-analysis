"January and February are always our busiest time of tho year," said Sally Dernngoski, Director of Athletics at HecSports. "Since nearly half of the people that come into the building head into the fitness room, it gets extremoly crowded during peak hours."

I had not expected 
Editor
coming into my sen­ior year. 
I had imagined that my four years at college would be similar to my four years of high school. Freshman year everyone is new, a little anxious, not sure what to expect. But by senior year, everything is just groovy. 
Senior year -by far my best year of high school (partially because the legal age to enter Louisiana bars is a mere 18 years). My senior year, everyone was friends with everyone -social barriers practically melted away. It did not matter anymore what group one had belonged to previously, everyone became pretty much just part of one big group. Everyone was pretty relaxed. 
This is what I had expected of Notre Dame. But I failed to calculate into my formula one vital factor. No one is inter­ested in meeting anyone new by senior year. I expected senior year to be a blur of hanging out with frfends. going out to the bars. meeting people. a general atmosphere of fun. And for the most part, it has been -except for the meet­ing people part. 
Being at home made me realize the completely difl'erent social atmosphere I exist in at Notre Dame. Walking into a bar at home, I will run into at least one person I know who will be more than happy to talk to me, no matter how long it has been since we last talked. They will immediately introduce me to the people they came with, and I will become part of that group for the time being. But at Notre Dame, I see people that I once knew, people from freshman or sophomore year, people who I had class with or did a project with, and we pretend we do not know each other. Casual acquaintances seem almost non­existent. It is so unlike being in southern Louisiana, where the most casual of acquaintances gives you a big hug upon greeting and enthusiastically asks, "How are you? How is everything?" Here, there are people you know and people you don't know. 
If you are with a·friend introductions will take place, but there is little chance of you ever talking to that person again in the absence of the friend who intro­duced you. Introductions are a casual courtesy but completely insincere. Though very polite, people who you are introduced to are rarely ever truly friendly. This is because people are so comfortable in their social groups that they have no desire to branch out and meet new people by senior year. People are tired of meeting new people, and are completely satisfied with knowing only the people in their own social groups. 
I generally like meeting new people ­or I used to at least, before I got here, where people are nice but not friendly. And with only a few months til gradua­tion, I have articulated yet another rea­son why I cannot wait to leave the shad­ow of the Golden Dome, a dome that looks friendly and warm, but in reality is nice and cool to the touch.

Group protests inauguration 
By ERICA RANGEL 
News Writer 
As the nation marked lhP beginning of its )pader's second term Thursday, some Saint Mary's faculty members. starr and students used the day as an opportunity to bring political issues to light. 
The Saint Mary's Peace Not War group gathered Thursday afternoon at Dalloway's Clubhouse on campus for an Anti-Bush Inauguration demonstra­tion. The event took place at the exact time Bush was being inaugurated. 
"The Peace Not War group was formed just before Christmas by SMC faculty members who were concerned about the ongoing war in Iraq," Sister Elena Maltis said. The group currently has 74 faculty, staff and stu­dent members. 
"We arc a single-issue group with many differ­ent values and beliefs feeding into it. We agree that we are against the war and that the troops should be sent home." said Professor Zae Munn. a Peace Not War member. 
The demonstration last­ed just over an hour as faculty members shared their thoughts, poems, stories and experiences with the group. 

KELLY HIGGINSfThe Observer 

A Saint Mary's professor speaks Thursday at an anti-Bush Inauguration demonstration In Dalloway's Clubhouse. 
"I believe that instead of being inaugurated, Bush should go before the tribunals for the slaughter of thousands and thousands of inno­cent victims," philosophy professor Ann Clark said in her speech. 
Psychology professor Joseph Miller talked about and blamed "highly informative" media such as Fox and Clear Ch anne I, for falsifying and putting spins on sto­ries. 
Munn shared her expe­rience of protesting on street corners with her 'llonk for Peace' sign around her neck. "Lots or people do honk. and it's a wonderful thing." she said. 
Each individual present 
at the demonstration wore a white ribbon to symbolize those who havP died in the war. They then performed the Din of the Dead. which con­sisted of everyone simul­taneously reading shents of names of those who have died. There were over 6,000 Iraqi and American names. 
"It's hard to be anti­Bush and mobilize on this campus because we arp the minority," said Lyndsny Bergen, Saint Mary's College Democrats acting president. "I think it was really great to have this, especially with all the faculty members."

"We are giving you roast beef instead of hamburgers ... better meals and more variety," said Dan Patterson, operations man­ager of South Dining Hall. "I just don't think students understand [the value of] what they are get­ting now." 
Prentkowski said he is not cer­tain that the current meal plan has sufficient funds to both maintain quality dining hall operations and grant additional Flex dollars. 
"Offering a 10-meals-per-week meal plan option really comes down to a matter of economics," he said. 
These funding problems mir­ror those that arose when Flex 10 was considered in the past, Prentkowski said. 
Until the fall semester of 1998, all resident students had a 21­meals-per-week meal plan. That year, the current ID card system was implemented, allowing for debit payments. Thus the Flex 14 meal plan was born, accom­panied by 200 flex points. As a result, that year Notre Dame's campus welcomed a renovated South Dining Hall, Reekers and Burger King.

FRANCE 

Holocaust me111orial to honor 7 6,000 Jews 
Associated Press 
PARIS -With name after name engraved on pale stone walls, a new monument in Paris' Jewish quarter pays tribute to the 76,000 Jews rounded up in France during the Holocaust and sent to Nazi death camps. 
France marks the 60th anniver­sary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland with memories, a monument ­and a national outcry over far­right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's remark that the Nazi occupation of France during World War II "was not particularly inhumane." 
The "Wall of Names," shown to reporters Wednesday ahead of an inauguration by President Jacques Chirac next week, is part of a renovated Holocaust memo­rial that has been transformed from an archive center and expanded. 
A simple plaque is the monu­ment's heart-wrenching compan­ion piece. From the sea of 76,000 names. it says, only 2,500 people survived, it says. 
Ten experts spent 2 1/2 years gathering information from Gestapo documents and research from French families to come up with the list. 
Under columns for each year of the deportations, the engravings list the victims alphabetically and include their dates of birth. Some unidentified victims are referred to simply as "a child." 
The wall is meant to remind visitors of the millions of individ­ual tragedies in the Holocaust, officials said. 
"In the list of all 76.000 names. there is also 'a name plus a name plus a name."' director Jacques Fredj said. 
The memorial also is a reminder of a dark period of French history -France's wartime collaboration with the Nazis. 
In 1995, Chirac became the first president to acknowledge that France was responsible for systematically persecuting Jews during the war. In one case, 13,152 Jews were rounded up in a bicycle stadium in Paris in July 1942 and sent to death camps. 
Fredj mentioned Chirac's acknowledgment -and the work of a commission to help compen­sate Jews for assets seized during the war -as a sign that France was coming to terms with its past. The memorial's renovation was funded partly by the govern­ment.

Airlines face extreme deficits, losses 
Continental, Delta cite high fuel costs and low fares for financial predicame11t 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA -Delta Air Linns Inc. blamed high fuel prices. low fares and hefty charges as it reported the worst annual financial per­formance in the industry's history on Thursday, culmi­nating with a $2.2 billion fourth-quarter loss. 
Continental Airlines Inc. cited similar difliculties and posted a smaller-than­expected $206 million loss, bringing cumulative fourth quarter losses reported so far by five large U.S. air­lines to $3.17 billion. 
A year earlier the same live carriers, which include American. Northwest and Southwest. reported a com­bined fourth quarter profit of $33 million. The soaring cost of jet fuel was a hugn drain on the industry in 2004, undermining the growth in passenger traf1ic as well as carriers' efforts to reduce labor expenses. 
Delta shares plunged 58 cents, or 9.8 percent, to close at $5.37 in Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Continental shares fell 8 cents to close at $9.37.

McCalister's class year was also in contention. The Student Government Association constitu­tional policy requires that all can­didates be at least second semes­ter sophomores. However. the statement issued declared McCalister's class status was not a determining factor in last night's vote. 
'The committee considered Ms. McCalister's outstanding qualifi­cations; however, her competency is not presently in question and had no effect on our decision," the statement read. 
Despite the extra meeting and final resolution, the two original tickets are ready to campaign and take on their desired roles as stu­dent body president and vice president. 
Fitzgerald and Siegel are run­ning under the campaign slogan "You have been heard." 
The pair are presenting a plat­form they hope addresses current student concerns such as creating a permanent forum for all stu­dents to voice their opinions, making a personal, visible and always available student govern­ment. increasing support of activi­ties on campus and helping to establish an "all inclusive" Saint Mary's identity. 
Both Fitzgerald and Siegel have had a noticeable presence on campus. Fitzgerald ran for stu­dent body vice president last year with Sarah Brown as her running mate, but the pair lost in a runoff election. Fitzgerald, who was class president her sophomore year, is a member of Board of Governance and is a political sci­ence and philosophy double major. Siegel held an SAB Marketing Co-chair position with what she believes is a fresh per­spective on student government She is an economics and English double major. 

The pair is hoping to make a change at the College in the midst of the transitions taking place. 
"We recognize this as a tremen­dous opportunity," Siegel said. "We have the chance to uphold the rich traditions of the College, represent the best interest of our fellow students, and to help lead the institution in its new direction would be an honor." 
Fitzgerald believes she and Siegel will allow students to feel as though they have been heard. 
"We take that central message of 'You have been heard' very seriously," she said. "The chance to give back to a college that has provided us with a liberal arts education, and the chance to lead this student body is something we do not want to miss." 
Mitros and Mcllduff are running under the campaign slogan "M & 
M: We're 'nuts' for you!" 

The running mates are hoping their ideas of promoting a greater understanding and appreciation of Saint Mary's to show how the College became what it is today, integrating diversity awareness into student government, working on increasing enrollment and retention and providing stronger representation with administra­tion will help them win the major­ity vote. 
Mitros and Mcllduff also have experience they believe will help them successfully accomplish these goals as student body presi­dent and vice president. Mitros is the junior class treasurer, was the sophomore class treasurer and is a humanistic studies major. Mcllduff is the current chief of staff to the student body presi­dent, is on the SGA executive board and is an intended business and communications double major. 
Both women believe their expe­rience will help them perform in such coveted positions. 
"We both have had a lot to do with student government, so we know the system," Mitros said. "We have seen things we've liked and things we haven't so we'd like to try to change some things while still highlighting the history of the College." 
Mcllduff echoed her running mate's sentiments. 
"Being Sarah Catherine White's chief of staff, I know what works and what doesn't," she said. "I think we could make the transi­tion fairly easily." 
But while the two platforms gear up to campaign over the weekend, some students are still in the dark about who they are at all. 
"It seems extremely early [for elections]." junior Staci Vanlue said. "I don't even know who is running. I don't even know their platforms." 
Sophomore Erin Luter also felt uninformed about the upcoming election. 
"I don't know about anyone campaigning, except I think I've seen a couple of posters -but not as many as last year," Luter said. "I think it is really important to know things about the person who is going to represent you."

American Idol has strong debut 
AP 

'American Idol' judges, from left, Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson speak to media during the Television Critics Association winter press tour In Los Angeles Monday. 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-TV viewers couldn't wait for their "American Idol" fix, turning out 33.5 million strong for its season debut. 
No other show this season has attracted so large an audience. and it represented the third­highest ratings night of enter­tainment programming in the Fox network's history, Nielsen Media Hesearch said Wednesday. The 33.5 million was a prelimi­nary estimate. 
''I'm as awe-struck as any­body," Fox entertainment President Gail Berman said. "We thought we would do well, but nothing like this." 
Berman and the show's pro­ducers were busy earlier this 

week trying to dampen expecta­tions, saying they anticipated the talent contest to lose some of its popularity in its fourth season. 
Last year's season debut was seen by 29 million people, Nielsen said. The season opener even eclipsed last May's finale: 
31.4 million people saw Fantasia Barrino crowned the third cham­pion. 
The two-hour debut Tuesday night featured auditions in Washington, D.C.. with the heart­warming story of Regina, who sold her wedding ring for a chance to get on the show and was rewarded with a trip to Hollywood. 
"In the end, this may sound a little corny, it's the people's pro­gram," Berman said. "People just love this show. They feel a part of it. because they're the folks who make the choice who wins." 
Anticipation may also play a part in its appeal, she said. Fox has resisted the obvious tempta­tion to hold more than one con­test a year. That's a costly deci­sion because this season Fox has sunk to a distant fourth in the prime-time ratings among the young audience it craves. 
"It's always been hard," Berman said. "It would have been great to have it on in November. Perhaps I wouldn't have read so many nasty stories about myself." 
Even one of Fox's rivals offered his admiration on Wednesday. 
"It was pretty impressive," said CBS Chairman Leslie Moonves.

SPAIN 
Church reinains anti-condoins 
Officials reverse bishop's advocation ofcontraception to fight AIDS 
Associated Press 
MADHID -The Catholic Church in Spain backtracked from a leading bishop's groundbreaking statement in support of condom use to fight the spread of AIDS, saying instead the church still believes artificial contracep­tion is immoral. 
A ruling Socialist politician involved in health care issues said she was mystified by the church's about-face in the space of 24 hours. Gay groups said they regretted the church's return to old policy after its "attack of lucidity." A liberal theologian said the church had quickly backpedaled after the Vatican reaffirmed its opposition to condoms. 
The Vatican states that con­doms. being a form of artificial birth control, cannot be used to help prevent the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
On Tuesday, Bishop Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for the Spanish Bishops Conference, said "con­doms have a place in the glob­al prevention of AIDS." He spoke after a meeting with Health Minister Elena Salgado to discuss ways of fighting the disease. 
His comments were front­page news in major Spanish papers. The United Left party called the policy shift "his­toric." The church had locked horns with Spain's progres­sive-minded Socialist govern­ment for moving to legalize gay marriage, streamline divorce proceedings and make it easier for women to have abortions. 
But on Wednesday night the conference issued a statement saying the bishop's comments "must be understood in the context of Catholic doctrine, which holds that use of con­doms is immoral sexual con­duct." 
VIETNAM 
WHO warns of bird flu outbreak 
Associated Press 
IIANOI -llealth experts fear a repeat of last year's bird flu outbreak after six people died in Vietnam within three weeks and neighboring Thailand reported its first case among poultry this year. 
Outbreaks among poultry have been reported nationwide in Vietnam. and health experts say the pattern looks worrying similar to last year, when the virus spread rapidly just before the Lunar New Year holiday, or Tet. It quickly appeared in nine other Asian countries, killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 100 million birds and jumping from poultry to people in Vietnam and Thailand, where 26 and 12 people died respec­tively. 
"It has a higher fatality rate than the Ebola virus," said Hans Troedsson, WHO representative in Vietnam, where more than 70 percent of those infected have died. 
"Since Tet is a time when peo­ple are traveling and more poul­try is going to the market, more poultry is being slaughtered, and poultry is more consumed and transported, there is, of course, a high risk of the spread of the virus and infection," he said of the holiday that starts Feb. 9. 
WHO and other health experts have expressed concern that avian influenza could evolve into the next global pandemic ­killing millions worldwide -if the virus mutates and human­to-human transmission occurs. There is, however, no evidence of that having occurred yet. 
The health agency has also cautioned against transporting poultry from places affected by bird flu into areas hit by last month's tsunami that killed as many as 220,000 people ­although numbers have varied drastically -and left thousands homeless. It stressed that infect­ed poultry must be "kept out of the food chain, including emer­gency food relief activities."

Laborers continue toiling as their forefathers did in massive, centuries-old salt mine 
Associated Press 
KHEWRA-At Asia's oldest 
salt mine, the march of technol­
ogy stopped generations ago. 
Bare-chested laborers use hand 
drills and gunpowder to blast 
away the pink and orange-col­
ored rock crystal, lucky if they 
earn a couple of dollars a day. 
The mineral wealth of Pakistan's craggy Salt Range has been exploited for cen­turies by rulers from Alexander the Great to the British colo­nialists of the last century. But as the economic importance of salt has dwindled, so has progress. 
The vast and ancient Khewra mine 80 miles south of Islamabad, the capital, is a period piece: stuffy. colonial­era offices inscribed with the names of the 32 chief mining engineers since 1872, and backbreaking, manual methods of excavation. 
The mine is a maze of tunnels .dug on 17 levels with glistening chambers of rock salt that repeat­edly shudder with

measures seven years ago. when tractors replaced trains to carry excavated salt out of the mine. He claims safety was compromised. The mine's man­agement contends the tractors make it easier to gather salt from the rock face. and arP actually safer because they are easier to control. 
Four protest leaders, includ­ing Malik, are facing trial. accused of attacks on govern­ment officials and setting fire to state property, which they deny. They face jail terms of between four years and life. They are free on bail, pending the ver­dict, due Jan 27. 
A recent report by the International Labor Organization, a U.N. agency, said more than 100 people die annually in Pakistani mine accidents. Mine officials said that last year, a worker at Khewra was crushed to death by a falling chunk of rock as he prised it from the mine ceiling with an iron bar. 
Yet Khewra's methodically 
excavated tunnels 
are said to be 
much safer than 


they collect the 
chunks of salt. 
The work force comprises 685 miners, all descendants of 14 local families who were granted hereditary rights to a job there by the British. The tradition was kept up by the Pakistani state enterprise that now manages the mine. 
Mohammed Buksh, 56, an eighth-generation mineworker, said working practices were much the same as when he started 40 years ago. 
"I want to get out of this job. It's hard work and it doesn't pay enough. Things haven't changed-we're still using our hands and manual tools," Buksh said as he took a break from stacking rocks in the oppressive heat of the mine. 
He works alongside his son Shezad, 24, and three cousins, by the light of a lamp mounted on a gas cylinder. For three years they have been digging the same cavern. It is now about 30 feet high and wide, and 120 feet deep. 
Buksh complained that the mine management withdrew mechanized rock-cutting and bore machines in 1998 to save money. The team gets 164 rupees ($2. 7 5) for every ton of rock salt excavated. If they work hard, he said, he can earn about $50 a month -a poor but living wage in Pakistan. 
Azmad Malik, 55. a former deputy chief of the salt workers union, said miners staged a protest over the cost-cutting 
sector is paying attention to safe­ty," he said. 
"The miners are living in medieval conditions," said Farooq Tariq. secretary-gener­al of the trade-union-affiliated Labor Party of Pakistan. "They have no advantage from tech­nological advancement. They just use their bodies and labor." 
Muhammed Saifullah Qureshi, the chief mining engi­neer at Khewra, concedes that little has changed since British times -and that little is likely to. 
Speaking inside his colonial­vintage office, complete with a polished desk bell for summon­ing his secretary, Qureshi said it doesn't pay to modernize because industrial-grade salt produced worldwide is cheap and the mine has been operat­ing in the red for the past 10 years. 
During the colonial era, salt's importance as a commodity was such that the British monopolized production, and the right to gather it freely was a rallying cry of the independ­ence movement. 
Qureshi said that at the cur­rent rate of excavation -about 350,000 tons of rock salt a year -the mine would last for at least 350 more years. 
lie hopes to increase exports of high-grade rock salt which is appreciating in value, can b1~ used to make ornaments and accounts for 10 to 20 percent of the mine's output.

Five years ago when the University hired athletic director Irish athletes have also succeeded off the field, winning Kevin White, Notre Dame sat in 23rd place in what was then numerous academic honors in addition to their on-the-field the Sears Cup.

Editorial
When White was hired, University President Edward Malloy made it clear to the new athletic director ­compete for a top-five finish in the Directors' Cup. Malloy want­ed White to have success not just in football, but in Notre Dame's other 23 sports as well. 
And with this fall's women's soccer national championship leading the way. White is well on his way to achieving that goal. 
In fall sports, White has both hired and retained some of the most highly-regarded coaches in the country. Every fall sport with the exception of football finished the season ranked in the NCAA top 25. Women's cross country finished fourth in the nation, and the men finished 11th. At what is traditionally a 
Anti-Bush bracelets 
During my time abroad in London, a recurring joke among my friends was how easily one can spot an American tourist. Primarily based on the cloth­ing (ski jackets with bright colors) and general demeanor (smiling or drinking Bill Rinner or both), one could inquire if they were A Voice of indeed American Reason and receive the invariable answer "Yeah, how'd you know?" 
If one steps outside the boroughs of tourist trap restaurants and bars, the difference of appearance is so pro­nounced that an American walking into a locals' pub elicits inevitable glares, dull whispers and perhaps even a snide comment or two. 
I can only imagine the week after Nov. 2, when the election results struck the old world with shock and awe. Particularly among young European students, the venomous anti-Bush stance is even more pr'eva­lent than one might find at the aver­age Berkeley coffeehouse or sociology department lounge. 
So how must one travel or study abroad when Americans can be spot­ted a mile away and the election results gave President George W. Bush the largest percentage of the total pop­ular vote since 1988? Several enter­prising young America·ns have devel­oped the idea of blue bracelets, Lance Armstrong "LIVESTRONG" -style, that advertise to the world that the wearer is, in fact, not some wacko resident of "Jesusland" who was inspired by Bush's glaring stupidity. But I digress; the time for pointing out the overreac­tions of the "Anyone But Bush '04" crowd has come and passed, and the world must focus on the next four years of Dubya leading the free world. 
The bracelet inventors hope their product can insulate American tourists from foreign hostility, spitburgers and improperly poured Guinness pints, or 
This year, the Irish finished 6-6, well below expectations. This is the biggest downfall of an athletics program in which the Olympic sports are thriving. 
Before Notre Dame and White get to where they ultimately need to be, football must return to national prominence. And Notre Dame must carry its Directors' Cup momentum through the spring, not just finish at the top of a preliminary set of standings. 
But for now, White and Notre Dame should take pride in the most recent standings -and view them as a promising progress report on the state of Irish athletics. 
simply help foster solidarity among Democrats at home. Their efforts deserve praise, at least from the inse­cure Americans who no longer have to resort to sewing the Canadian flag onto their backpacks. Media attention has made them so successful and prof­itable that red bracelet Republican equivalents have popped up as well. 
The bracelets, rapidly approaching the "tipping point" level of popular attention and discourse, only fuel the over-hyped red-state/blue-state ideo­logical tale both parties have grasped. Sure, America was divided in the last election, but the road to healing the rifts both at home and abroad does not lie in clothing campaigns that hearken back to the glory days of middle school conformity. I hesitate to make a "MoveOn" joke, but even the most stri­dent liberals still reeling from the election results should brainstorm ways to avoid perpetual loss at the polling booth. Three simple steps can guide Democrats to greater political relevance when the odds are against them. 
Step one: Leave the blue bracelets, blue headbands and blue Soma at home before venturing out into the American public sphere. I'll be more impressed if you engage me in civil discussion and debate than if you wear the bold statement that, yes, you did in fact vote against Bush. 
Step two: Be self-constructive and acknowledge the Democrats presented a platform so unimpressive that one of the least popular incumbents in histo­ry won reelection with a larger per­centage than former president Bill Clinton could ever muster. As comfort­ing as claims about the bigotry, stupid­ity or inability to vote in their "best interests" may seem for explaining why Republicans win, the way forward is to alter the platform, not to mince words or hire a better cheerleader. William F. Buckley helped modern-day conservatives more than any non-
so 2004 

elected figure of his era when he mus­tered forces to marginalize and even­tually jettison the far-right John Birch Society from mainstream conservative ranks. Could Democrats benefit from a similar purge or at least distancing themselves from the Michael Moore wing? 
Step three: Never lose your pride in being an American when traveling abroad. The perceived loss of American prestige was so prevalent that I wonder if the infamous "court of world opinion" already declared us unfit to rule until we elect a linguisti­cally gifted Democrat as president to placate the postmodern European masses. Ironically, the greatest fuel for international condemnation of America is the lack of confidence and overstated self-flagellation displayed by its very own citizens. The more we allow dissenting world opinion as the source of policy change, the more active their voices will become in con­demning American institutions until we curb them to satisfy our foreign counterparts. 
Had Sen. John Kerry sque.aked out a win in November, every passionate critic of Bush would have claimed vic­tory, in some small part, due to their efforts. Thankfully, no foreign critics can convince themselves the protest marches through Trafalgar Square and fair-weather allies turning their backs were just what America needed to realize that Bush should get the boot. Bracelet symbols of solidarity only pay homage to the false deity of "world opinion" that produced more heat than light in guiding our election toward its desired end.

Poetry

rain driv1~s me indoors I pore through tlw phont~­book in search of the ess1mce of a city. I recently happpned upon the listing for "Clowns." Tlwre I found Buttons the Clown. (;igglns, .Jolly Molly and Peppermint and Friends (these might include tlw rather hip Cool Mint). I also came across Bubbles, who advertises himself as "Portland's Happiest Clown." Bubbles' rather large adver­liSI'lllf'nt dwarfs the smaller listing just inches below for "the Original Bubbles tlw Clown." I sensed some bitterness in this name, as if it represented a vain atWmpt to lash out at the apparently far more successful Bubbles who, in addition to bning happier, has also usuqwd a dwrished title. 
This apparent squabble gave me cause to consider the reverence sur­rounding down mun1~s. There can be only one Bubbles, Binky or Bingo. To assume the name of another clown is to initiate a turf war of sorts. You can only step on so many giant red boots lwfore you're ripe for a pie in the face. Such names make it hard to take clowns seriously. In our day clowns have been relegated to starring roles in childrnn'sbirthday p1,1.rties and the circus. Centuries ago their forebears entertained royalty, often using humor to cloak stark criticism of a ruler's policies. Apparently in those days the rulers themselves were not so glaringly clownish. Nearly every culture going back over 4,000 years to the Egyptians and Chinese has had some form of jester. Throughout this history clown humor has combined smiles with an often poignant hint of sadness. 
I'm not sure whether "Gentle BitT the Clown" does the same. He offers his services for "Birthdays, Picnics and Promotions." After reading this adver­tisement I imagined a forward-thinking young executive who "thinks outside the box" walking into his boss's office. 
"David, we are very impressed with your work performance. You've been a real team player. We'd like to make you a .Junior Assistant Associate Hegional Vice President. To help cele­brate your promotion we've brought in Gentle Biff the Clown. Perhaps you remember Bif'f from the company's family picnic." At this point Gentle Biff emerges from a file closet, firing con­fetti into the air while juggling a collec­tion of ivory-handled letter openers. 
"Of course I remember Gentle Biff, he appeared at my daughter's birthday party. I didn't know he did promo­tions." 
Well he does. And he also boasts a "Magical Umbrella Fun Cart." What this is eludes me, but it sounds like something one might find referenced in an LSD-inspired 1960s rock song: "I want to take you on a ride through the rain I On my Magical Umbrella Fun Cart." 
If Biff doesn't do the trick one might call "Eartha the Ecological Clown." Portland is perhaps the only American city that could sustain an ecological clown. I consider myself an ardent environmentalist but wonder how much fun an ecological clown could offer, "''m sorry I can't do any balloon sculptures, kids. Couldn't find any bal­loons made from recycled tires. But I can make some funky designs with granola in this giant bowl of yogurt. Check it out." Long after children bore of tie-dying their old clothing and acquiring parasites from Eartha's "Magical Mound of Compost" the les­sons of recycling and proper disposal of face painting products will long endure. It's simply too bad they weren't fun. 
But at least Eartha, like great jesters of the past, is willing to offer social cri­tique. Days after letting my fingers do the walking I met a band of clowns in the image and likeness of Eartha. It was past midnight, and I was sitting on a friend's front porch with a dozen other people. As we carefully selected less-than-necessary brain cells to dis­pense with, three people appeared out of the darkness, hopped off their bicy­cles. and walked up the steps. They were dressed like clowns. Some might have argued I was also dressed like a clown, but that was not intentional. It never is. 
The clowns sought to entertain in exchange for beer and cigarettes. One asked to use the bathroom and in our impaired judgment we led him inside. He returned in a gorilla costume and began grooming the audience as his 
companions entertained with song and 
dance. 

They sang a variety of songs, some 
lewd but funny, other simply lewd, and 
still others striking out at social 
inequities. I heard that oldest of dia­
tribes: "The rich stay rich while the 
poor get poorer" intoned by a man in 
face paint with a giant red nose. The 
clowns had recently moved from 
California (no real shock) and liw~d 
communally, paying their rent by 
repairing bikes and working as ama­
teur clowns. I hoped for their sake the 
bike business was doing well. 
They also s(Jld videos decrying the abuse of workers and the environment and left us with a self-made documen­tary highlighting their own experierlCI~s at various protests. As anarchists they believed in a society approximating nothingness, which is to say they protested anything that dared exist. There is something undeniably holistic about that position. 
A similarly holistic approach to life marks classic clowning. It remains all too absent in our contemporary world. We seem to have lost the ability to lind both humor and pathos in nearly any situation, and to see the often vital link between them even in the face of injus­tice. Perhaps the time has conHi to send in the clowns.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dante students fight back against College Park owners 
I was forwarded the Jan. 12 article by The Observer regarding the College Park Apartments flooding. The information that Patty Hussworm, the College Park Apartment representative for the owner, Tycore Limited of Chicago, gave to The Observer is far from accurate. These Notre Dame students in the 10 or so damaged units were (and some still are) homeless purely for Paramount's poor and nearly criminal management. 
I am a father of one of those students. My daughter is still without a clean and suitable apartment and without a bed. Her bed was ruined by the Paramount contrac­tors. along with all of her other furniture. The apartments did not flood because of heat being off as Hussworm told The Observer. 
My daughter hired a professional inspec­tor, a master plumber, to inspect her apartment and all the other damaged apartments before Tycore and Paramount could do anything themselves. 
The inspector has provided his statement that all of the pipes which bursted were upstairs units because of contractor and owner/construction negligence, improper building materials and nothing to do with the interior heat, which was on. not off, in the downstairs units. 
lie also said he is aware this has hap­pened several times in the past several years at the same apartment complex and will likely happen again at College Park. 
Hussworm and Tycore have been threat­ening all these students -who are the tenants -with lawsuits to pay for con­struction repairs and all other damages since the problem occurred. Russworm decided to notify the tenants, all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, of College Park's problem many days after Russworm 
knew about the flooding apartments. 
Elizabeth Cain, Notre Dame senior accounting major, was not notified of her possessions sitting ankle deep in water until Jan. 2, and Paramount knew of the flooding by Dec. 29 or 30. 
The students were told it was holiday time, and Russworm was busy during that week, thus the tardy call about the flood­ing. The flood in all of the first-floor apart­ments occurred from the pipes freezing in the wall chase above the second-floor apartments, which was open to the attic in all cases. 
The flood occurred on Dec. 29. Kristin Boyd, homeless tenant and Notre Dame senior class officer, said she had to fight hard to get Tycore to even secure a mold and bacteria test. She has now been told one test was done on her apartment, one of the 10 damaged, yet College Park Apartments will not give Boyd, or any ten­ant, a copy of the mold report. 
All these students were told to find their own housing, and they must pay for their own housing, and damages on clothing, bedding, computers, etc., from the con­stant flow of running water from the sec­ond-floor apartments down to the first­lloor apartments which sustained all the big damage. 
This situation is far from over. 
The College Park owners do not ·know what they are doing, have shown no regard for their tenants and possessions. Now that they have threatened these Notre Dame students, the students are unified, are together and will fight back.

War in Iraq con1pletely justified 
I have been reading a lot of negative articles about the situation in Iraq lately. To those of you who think Iraq is the new Vietnam. who think no weapons of mass destruction negates any reason for going to Iraq, and who think the insurgency is winning and the war is unwinnable, please read Lieutenant Colonel Tim Ryan's recent letter to Americans. lie is a soldier in Iraq, and his letter will open your eyes to the real situation there. 
It is amazing to me how quickly people forget what has happened in the recent past. Read Prime Minister Tony Blair's and President George W. Bush's speeches asking for the authoriza­tion of force against Saddam, and you will find the full and com­plete case for war, of which weapons of mass destruction are an integral part but by no means the full justifica­tion. 
Search for speeches by senators (especially those who now denounce this war as a disaster) in the mid-90s who were howling for Saddam's removal, even if that meant the use of force. 
Read the Duelfer report in full to see the real conclusion about Saddam's intentions. 
Search for news articles from the late 1940s predicting we would fail to secure Germany even after winning the war. 
Oh yeah, and take a second to remember who the enemy is-brutal. inhuman terrorists who oppose any kind of democratic society in the Middle East. 
If you get all of your information about the war in Iraq from reading prominent newspapers and the evening news, then quite frankly, you are being duped. The war was the right thing to do, and it is currently going very well, as far as you can say that in times of war.

Ring in new yearagain 
Do you ever wish you could spend New Year's Eve with your Notre Dame friends? Well, even though you probably missed your chance to ring in the traditional New Year, you're not too late to throw a Chinese New Year Party. February 9 marks the beginning of the year of the Rooster, the 4,703rd year in the Chinese calendar. This important day in Chinese culture commences with Maureen Malloy a 15-day festival ending on the full moon. While Times Square and Dick Scene Writer Clark may not be part of your soiree, you can incorporate Chinese traditions such as brightly colored lights, homemade paper lanterns, small gift exchanges and delicious food in your festivities. After you try making some of these traditional recipes, break out your chopsticks and pop the "Joy Luck Club" in your VCR while ringing in another new year.

THEATRE REVIEW 

When Catholicism is 
"Late Nite Catechism" is religion wit 
By CHRIS HAMMER Scene Writer 

"Late Nite Catechism 2 (Sometimes We Feel Guilty Because We Are Guilty)" transformed the Decio Mainstage Theatre into a Catholic grade school classroom and turned the clocks back for those in the audience who spent many an hour in such a classroom. From the religious and patriotic bulletin boards to the unwork­able slide projector, from Sister's desk -complete with a collection bank for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith -to the slate chalkboard with "JMJ" (Jesus, Mary and Joseph) written at the top, the only things missing to complete the parochial school classroom were the rows ofuncomfortable student desks. 
But that omission was intentional -the classroom was the entire theatre, not just the stage, making the audience Sister's pupils. Yes, that means audience par­ticipation -and if you think you can hide from Sister's attention, you will be as successful as you were in grade school. Sister, played by Kimberly Richards, called the class to order promptly at starting time, a warning to those who may be habitually tardy, and started her catechism lesson. 
Richards had spot-on mannerisms; her deadpan style was enhanced with her reactions to members of the audience at our expense, both figuratively and liter­ally. If she noticed someone chewing gum, she would make him spit the gum out, if two members of the audience were particularly close, she implored them to "make room for the Holy Spirit." 
Throughout these ad-libs, Richards gave a grade-school lesson on sin and pun­ishment, creating her own Catholic "Chj actions brought people closer to heaven 
or damned them to hell. But more th Nite Catechism" highlighted a Catholic appreciated by-so many in the audienc Chesterton once wrote, "It is the test about it." "Late Nite Catechism" passes t ously funny even when dealing with such serious matters, does not detract from bu

Classic 100 coming soon 
PAC will begin series of top films this fall 
By BRANDON HOLLIHAN Scene Writer 
These days, it seems everyone has a Top 100 list. A scan through theE! Channel or Vlll almost guarantees the discovery of a Top 100 list pertain­ing to celebrity culture, complete with magazine writers and second-rate comedians struggling tbr a decent joke. ESPN, in honor ofits 25th anniver­sary, ran a list of the top 100 sports moments of the past 25 years through­out last summer. 
And it appears Notre Dame cannot escape the ranking bonanza either. This spring, the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center will test its plan for the "PAC Classic 100," a series of "one hundred classic American and International films to be screened in the PAC." The actual series does not begin until next fall, but this spring semester will offer students an oppor­tunity to view some of the films that faculty members of the film. television and theater department consider among the elite. 
John Haynes, executive director of the PAC, developed the series as a way of giving students an opportunity to develop a basic history of film­making throughout their four years at Notre Dame. 25 fillns of the 100 films will be shown each year. with the cycle repeating after the fourth year. 
"There's talk of having yearly memberships for the 25 films, with a dis­count lbr the entire package," said Jon Vickers, manager of the Browning Cinema at the PAC. 
The program also hopes to award students who complete the entire PAC list, including plans for an annual banquet. which may feature a Hollywood VIP. 
The F1T department created the "PAC Classic 1 00" by merging at least 10 major film lists, including the American Film Institute's Top 100. the Top 100 list for the National Society of Film Critics, the library of Congress List and even the Vatican's Top 45 Films of all-time. All lists lead to some sort of debate, and the PAC's will be no different, leaving out several acclaimed films. For instance, "Pulp Fiction" and "Star Wars"-two films ranked within the American Film Institute's list-did not make the cut for the "PAC Classic 100." 
"By combining film lists, we had to narrow down 400 films, and we want to bring in things people haven't seen," Vickers said. 'This list is a good topic for debate, because how do you narrow down a list of 400 fillns?" 
The majority of films will be screened Saturdays at 3:00 p.m., with some fall fillns occupying a Sunday time slot so as to avoid home football games. 
The spring screenings begin Saturday at 3:00p.m. with Fellini's "8 lfl," a film following a famous movie director's struggle to create his next mas­terpiece . 
"ri'he director] just goes through this wandering process, trying to dL<>­cover the film he wants," Vickers said. "It's avant-garde, and it's an insight into filrrunaking through a non-American, non-formula film style." 
Tickets for all screenings are $3 for students.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN 

Roddick wins in four sets, advances to third round 
Associated Press 

MELBOURNE, Australia -It takes one to know one. 
In a highly hyped showdown between the two biggest servers in tennis, Andy Roddick antici­pated exactly what Greg Rusedski would offer. And Roddick pounded out a 6-0, 3-6, 6-2. 6-3 victory Thursday to reach the third round of the Australian Open. 
"I felt like I was seeing the ball from early on," Roddick said, "and I tried not to second-guess it." 
The second-seeded Roddick owns the record for fastest serve, at 155 mph, and led the men's circuit in aces the last two sea­sons. He slammed 11 aces against Rusedski. 
But the big difference in the match was Roddick's returns. He hit winners with almost as much speed as they had coming off Rusedski's racket. 
So has Rusedski's serve lost its zing? 
"No, not at all," said Roddick, who shared the record for the fastest serve with Rusedski until twice breaking the mark last sea­son. "My returns normally aren't that good -I couldn't believe it. 
"You always want to return like that. It was just clicking for me." 
With the exception of one bad game, Roddick gave top-ranked Roger Federer something to think about with a nearly flaw­less performance. The 2003 U.S. Open champion, now working with new coach Dean Goldfine. committed only eight unforced errors and dropped serve just once. 
No. 3 Lleyton Hewitt did more running, coming back from a set and a break down to beat James Blake 4-6, 7-6 (8). 6-0. 6-3. Blake's fortunes turned when he cut his racket hand at the end of the second set. · Venus Williams continued to play well in her bid to return to the top of the game, beating China's Peng Shuai 6-3, 6-1, while No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport and No. 3 Anastasia Myskina both had nervous moments before advancing. 
Davenport appeared to be still overcoming bronchitis that restricted her buildup before earning a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over 99th-ranked Michaela Pastikova. 
"I just wasn't ready to be at my very best at the beginning," Davenport said. "She caught me on the back foot." 
Myskina had problems with her serve and trailed 3-1 in the first set, but regained control in a four-game streak and then didn't face a break point in the second set while ousting No. 114 Tzipora Obziler 6-4, 6-2. 
Myskina next plays 25th-seed­ed Usa Raymond, who last year upset Williams in the third round en route to the Australian Open quarterfinals. 
Roddick, meanwhile, will face a third straight left-bander in Austria's Jurgen Melzer. 
One poorly played game cost Roddick the second set against Rusedski, the runner-up at the 1997 U.S. Open: He started and ended the eighth game with dou­ble-faults. Before that. Roddick hadn't lost a point on serve in the second set. 
Rusedski served out at love next game. leveling at one set apiece with an ace. That was as close as he got. 
Rusedski lost 10 of 11 of his ftrst net approaches, but finished at just over 50 percent -43 of 83 attempts. He figured he wouldn't beat the young American from the baseline. 
"I tried to stick in there any which way I could," Rusedski said. "At one set all, I had a few chances, but I didn't play enough returns and didn't serve well 
enough.  I  just  wasn't  good  
enough."  
Hewitt  weathered  Blake's  

opening barrage, then cranked up his own serve and ground­strokes to set up a third-round match against 25th-seeded Juan Ignacio Chela, one of the four Argentineans advancing Thursday. The others were French Open finalist Guillermo Coria, No. 9 David Nalbandian and No. 12 Guillermo Canas. 
Seventh-seeded Tim Henman and former top-ranked Juan Carlos Ferrero also advanced in straight sets. 

Blake was one point from a two-set lead over Hewitt before he unraveled. 
After failing when he served for the second set at 6-5, he clubbed two service returns into the net to give Hewitt a set point at 7-6 in the tiebreaker. 
Blake smacked a backhand winner with his a service return to level at 8-8, then mimicked Hewitt's trademark celebration -pointing his fingers at his face and screaming "Come on!" 
Hewitt won the next two points, the second when Blake's desper­ate tumbling shot landed long. Blake lost his racket in the fall. cutting the webbing between two fingers on his right hand. He regained his feet as if to play the rest of the point without his rack­et. 
Hewitt broke to open the third set, starting a six-game winning steak. 
"There was a lot of momentum swings out there," Hewitt said. "Things fell my way towards the end."

WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
NC State's Yow diets to recovery 
Respected women's coach treating cancer with new food plan 
Associated Press 
RALEIGH, N.C. -North Carolina State coach Kay Yow decided she needed a new approach to treat her recurrence of breast cancer, the latest in a variety of ailments to hit her in the past year. 
The Hall of Fame women's basketball coach decided to fol­low a new dietary plan -no meat, no dairy products, no sugar and all organic food. So far, that's her only treatment after having the tumor removed last month. 
"For a Southern gal like me, it's a complete overhaul," Yow said Thursday before returning from a two-game absence to lead the Wolfpack against Miami. "It's nothing I'm used to doing." 
Her players wore pink laces in their right shoes -pink is the symbol for breast cancer aware­ness -for the third straight game, and Yow received a rous­ing ovation when she was intro­duced before the matchup with the Hurricanes. 
While she missed those games to start her new program, State (13-4, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) went 1-1 under longtime assistant Stephanie Glance, including a 76-75 over­time victory over No. 23 Vrrginia Tech. The loss was by two points to ninth-ranked North Carolina. 
''I'm just so proud of my team and my staff," the 62-year-old Yow said. "They embodied everything I believe in and the history of my program." 
Yow first was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987, and her oncologist, Dr. Mark Graham, said it was a recurrence. Yow had treatment for skin cancer last year and also had a bout with pneumonia. 

"My immune system is just not working like it ought to do, and that can be because of what you're putting in it," she said. 
Having the cancer come back after 17 years is not rare, some­thing Graham had to tell to another patient earlier Thursday. She has been healthy for the past five years after beating the iden­tical type of cancer that Yow has. 
"She wanted me to tell her that she was cured of breast cancer," Graham said. "I had to tell her she was not totally out of the woods." 
But the prognosis remains pos­itive for Yow, who's cancer-free at the moment in tests per­formed by Graham. If it returns, Graham said Yow probably will undergo traditional treatment such as radiation or chemother­apy. 
"As she's sitting here, she is disease-free, and we'd like -to keep her that way,'! Graham said. "All cancer is not created equal, and Coach has an excel­lent chance to do well with this cancer. The people that have a recurrence like this have a long life." 
Yow has no plans to miss any more games, saying she hopes her new diet will give her even more energy. She has a 666-304 career record in 34 seasons, including a 609-285 mark in 30 years at State, 
She was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002 and coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal. In 1998, she led the Wolfpack to their only Final Four appearance.

FOXBORO, Mass. -Adam Vinatieri approached the ball, drove it toward the uprights and got mad when the field goal missed. 
And that was just during a workout last spring. 
"There's no one out here except for us two." said Josh Miller, who had just signed as the New England Patriots new holder and punter. "We were also at 58 yards. So I said, 'OK, that's what I'm part of and it's pretty cool.' " 
Vinatieri takes every kick seriously -whether it's an extra point in a regular-season blowout or a field goal that wins the Super Bowl, whether he's in a dome or driving snow. 
His foot may be the differ­ence again in the AFC champi­onship game between two strong defenses on Sunday in Pittsburgh where snow show­ers are in the forecast, some­the air than any of the other thing he grew up with in things that that kick meant," Yankton, S.D. Vinatieri said.

NFL 

Vinatieri is reliable in playoffs 
going to guarantee anything in the future." 
Plenty has worked out well in his nine seasons since join­ing the Patriots as a free agent in 1996. 
This season he led the NFL in scoring and made 24 of his last 25 field goal attempts. He's kicked 17 game-winning field goals in the regular sea­son and playoffs and, from inside the 40-yard line, he's missed just 21 of 203 kicks. 
"He's as good at what he does as (Michael) Jordan at what he does," Miller said. "If he's as good at his trade and used it somewhere else, he'd change the world. But he's a kicker and he has to just settle for being the best kicker." 
Heinz Field in Pittsburgh is known as a tough place to kick. Last weekend, Doug Brien of the New York Jets missed two field-goal attempts late in the fourth quarter and overtime, and the Steelers won.

Six Ga111ecocks charged vvith stealing tea111 equip111ent 
Associated Press 
COLUMBIA, S.C. -Six cur­rent and former South Carolina football players were charged Thursday with steal­ing $18,000 worth of equip­ment from Williams-Brice Stadium last November. 
Offensive lineman Woodly Telfort is charged with grand larceny, a felony. He admitted to investigators he took a $4,000 laptop, according to an arrest warrant. 

Quarterbacks Syvelle Newton and Dondrial Pinkins have been charged with a misde­meanor, petit larceny, along with defensive lineman Freddy Saint-Preux and safety Rodriques Wilson. 
Arrest warrants say all four players took action photos of themselves from the South Carolina locker room area of the stadium and have con­fessed to the theft. 
A warrant is pending for a sixth player the school did not identify. 
A total of $18,000 worth of computer and video equipment and framed photographs were taken from the stadium on Nov. 22, shortly after the Gamecocks were told they would not go to a bowl as pun­ishment for an on-field brawl with Clemson. 
"Regrettably, a few of our student-athletes made a very poor decision during the course of a frustrating situa­tion, and they must now face the consequences," athletic director Mike McGee said. 
Newton is a rising junior and started several games for South Carolina last yea.r. Saint­Preux, who was injured much of this season and Telfort, who saw extensive play as a reserve in 2004, will be sen­iors next year and have already been suspended for the Gamecocks opener Sept. 1 against Central Florida because of their involvement in the brawl with Clemson. 
All three will now be sus­pended at least until the charges are resolved, McGee said.

AR rs 

Dodgers' pitclzer signs a two-year deal at $19 million 
A»ociatcd Press 
I.OS AN<;I·:LJ~S -Even Eric <;agn«' was worried about the l>odgPrs' overhaul. 
Now lw sounds happy with it after agn~eing to a $19-mil­lion, two-ynar contract and SI'Ping how the team shapes up. 
"I was searPd. too, liko all tlw fans. about all tho moves, like wlwrc arn Wll going, what anl we trying to do?" Gagne said Thursday. "When we signnd Derek Lowe, I thought, OK, that's where we're going. 
"Talk about team chemistry, talk about J>enlk Lowe, he's a world champion. Talk about .ll'l'f Kont, lw's an MVI'; J.D. l>n~w. lw's just getting started, and bringing back Odalis Perez." 
(;agne shook his head and said, "I think it's just amazing what we did with the team." 
Sp1~aking at a Dodger Stadium news conference after signing his new contract, Gagne obviously was pleased with the deal he struck with the Dodgers. After winning the 2003 NL Cy Young Award while earning $550,000, he was not happy when he had to g(J to arbitration last year. lie askod for $8 million, but arbi­trators ruled in favor of the club's ofl'or of $5 million. 
The Dodgers' new regime of owner Frank McCourt and general manager Paul DePodesta didn't have much time to avoid sending Gagne to arbitration last February. They took control of the team less than a week before his hear­ing. 
"Eric's contractual situation was really the first issue I dealt with as general manag­er," DePodesta said. "I came on board and within the first week, his arbitration case had been settled and it was some­thing that was really the pri­mary issue of the day. 
"At that point, we made some statements and I had conversations with both Eric and Scott (agent Scott Boras) that we didn't want to go through that procflSS again." 
The Dodgers have parted company with some of the team's best-and most popu­lar -players since McCourt took over 11 months ago, including Paul Lo Duca, Adrian Beltre, Shawn Green, Steve Finley and Jose Lima. 
McCourt was determined to keep Gagne, who convert~d a major league-record 8'4 con­secutive saves from Aug. 28, 2002·, ;to July 5, 2004. 
"Needless to say, we made a lot of decisions this offseason, none more important than the decision to sign Eric," the owner said. "I don't think we just signed a closer, I think we to take it to the next level and win the World Series." 
Gagne had a 7-3 record with a 2.19 ERA last season. He had 45 saves in 4 7 chances while appearing in 70 games, strik­ing out 114 and walking only 
22. He pitched three innings in two games of the NL division series, which the Dodgers lost to St. Louis 3-1. It was the team's first postseason appear­ance since 1996. 
signed someone who brings the attitude that you need, in a,ddition to the talent, to win year in and year out. 
"If I were to pick one player in all of baseball that personi­fies the attitude of the team I own and operate, it's this gen­tleman." 
Los Angeles has a $12 mil­li.on -option for 2007 with a $1 million buyout, but Gagne has the right to void the option and ' "'J :L . 
become a free agent. 
In the meantime, the 28­year-old reliever is glad he doesn't have to be concerned with the business side of the game for a while. 
"I'm just happy it worked out. Instead of talking about contracts and all that stuff. we can talk about baseball," Gagne said. "We made the playoffs last year and that was great, but this year we've got

Colts receiver Reggie Wayne scores a touchdown against Denver during Indianapolis' first-round playoff victory in the RCA Dome. The city's proposal for a new stadium was rejected by the State House Speaker on Thursday. 
Plans for a new Colts dollle put on hold 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -House Speaker Brian Bosma said Thursday there is no chance the Legislature will approve Mayor Bart Peterson's pro­posal to expand gambling to help finance a new Indianapolis Colts sta­dium. 
The mayor challenged Bosma to come up with a better plan. 
"If somebody has a better idea,.J'm willing to listen to it," Peterson said. "What we need is $46 million a year to be able to pay the debt service on this new stadium." 
Peterson last month unveiled a plan for a new 63,000-seat stadium, which would have a retractable roof and could be expanded to 70,000 seats to host a Super Bowl. The facility is pro· jected to cost between $550 million 
IN BRIEF 
French probe Armstrong doping allegations 
ANNECY, France -French authori­ties have opened a preliminary inquiry into doping allegations made against six-time Tour de France win­ner Lance Armstrong in a book pub­lished last summer. 
Judicial officials confirmed the probe Thursday but declined to give details, describing the case as confidential. 
Philippe Trouyet, commissioner of the judicial police in Annecy, said Thursday that the investigation had been compromised by revelations in the media, and added that it would likely soon be dropped. 
The investigation centers on an interview with Armstrong's former British assistant, Emma O'Reilly. 
Shortly before last year's Tour de France, O'Reilly made allegations in a book "LA Confidential, The Secrets of Lance Armstrong." She claimed that Armstrong sent her on long road trips to pick up pills and dispose of used syringes. 
and $700 million and is seen as the key to keeping the Colts in Indianapolis once their lease with the RCA Dome, the NFL's smallest stadi­um, expires after the 2013 season. 
Under Peterson's plan, Colts owner Jim lrsay and the NFL would con­tribute $100 million in loans. The city also would ask the Legislature to approve pull-tab machines, which resemble slot machines, for horse racing tracks in Anderson and Shelbyville and an off-track betting parlor in Indianapolis. The latter was the apparent deal-killer for Bosma. 
"As far as I'm concerned, that pro­posal's dead," said Bosma, an Indianapolis Republican. "He ought to find another (funding) mechanism." 
Peterson, however, said he's con­vinced his proposal is still the best option. 
According to Thursday's edition of Le Parisien newspaper, O'Reilly flew in from Liverpool, England, in July to confirm to French magistrates what she'd told authors David Walsh and Pierre Ballester in the book. Delgado meets with Mets for three hours 
NEW YORK -Carlos Delgado met with the New York Mets in Puerto Rico for a second time Thursday, a three­hour session that included the team's ownership and the first baseman's agent. 
Delgado plans to meet Friday with Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks and general manager John Hart. He also is being courted by Florida and Baltimore, although the Orioles have not been mentioned prominently in recent days by his agent, David Sloane. 
Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon and general manager Omar Minaya were at Thursday's session with Delgado and Sloane. 
"Having Jeff Wilpon join us for this meeting made it possible to discuss the 
''I've spent the last two years think­ing through this very difficult issue and thinking through all the alterna­tives," he said. "For the speaker to suggest that I have to come up with an alternative isn't going to help get this stadium built. And if we don't get the stadium built, we're going to lose the Colts." 
Peterson said his plan, developed after lengthy discussions with the Colts, would guarantee the team would remain in Indianapolis for the next 30 years. It also would allow expansion of the convention center adjoining the RCA Dome. He said the plan doesn't rely on an increase in income, property or sales taxes. 
Bosma said creating what he called a "casino" downtown in one of the most family friendly cities in the Midwest would not work. 
issues regarding our respective pro­posals that we felt needed clarifica­tion," Sloane wrote in an e-mail. He said his side had a "better understand­ing" of "the challenges making this deal presents." No news is daily news in NHL labor negotiations 
After two days of negotiations, the NJ-IL and the players' association appeared no closer to a deal that could save the hockey season. 
Representatives from the league and union met for 4 1/2 hours Thursday in Toronto, the second straight day the sides held discussions in an attempt to end the four-month lockout. 
The sides also held a five-hour meeting in Chicago on Wednesday. but they remained divided on the idea of cost certainty, a concept the play­ers' association says is an unacceph able salary cap. 
Following the two-day session, the only thing the sides appeared to agree on was that they are still far apart.

Belles set to host lone swim meet of winter 
Saint Mary's will take on Kalamazoo at the Rolfs Center 
By ANNA FRICANO Sports Writer 
ThP Belles host their only home swim meet of the season today as they take on confer­Pncn opponnnt Kalamazoo CollngP at tho Holfs Aquatic Cnnt«H on the Notre Dame campus. The all-women's event marks the llrst of a pair of con­ference meets for Saint Mary's that will help to determine the team's standings before the MIAA Swimming and Diving Championships in mid­February. 
The current MIA/\ standings put Kalamazoo College in third place, behind Calvin and Hope, who rank f'irst and second, respectively. Saint Mary's cur­rently stands in sixth place. A victory over Kalamazoo College would give the Belles as many conference wins as Albion, who now holds the fifth-place spot. 
The Belles will be faced with a difficult challenge competing against a strong Kalamazoo team. In their last conference meet, the Hornets defeated Alma College by a score of 148­
90. However, the Belles have a more recent victory, albeit not as large, over Alma defeating them last week. Saint Mary's has yet to compete against the Hornets this season. 
Sophomore Nicole Korte as well as juniors Kelly Nelis and Sarah Nowak, all of whom have been consistent finishers for Saint Mary's in the freestyle events. will be essential to compete with a strong Hornet freestyle swimmer. Sophomore Elizabeth Garlow of Kalamazoo College holds top spots in thrne of the MIAA's rankings of the best swimming and diving per­formances of the 2004-05 sea­son, all of which are in freestyle events. 
Tonight will also mark an especially significant night for the only two fourth-year swim­mers on the team. Senior night will honor seniors and eo-cap­tains Michelle Stanforth and Ashley Dyer. Dyer will gradu­ate in the spring with a degree in Women's Studies and Biology. llailing from Clive, Iowa, she has earned three varsity letters during her career with the team. Dyer was named the 2004-05 SMC pres­ident. and has boen honored on the AII-MIA/\ honor roiL Stanforth, from Kokomo. Indiana has also achieved three varsity letters with the team. A mathematics major.

Irish ready to compete in NY Duals Sunday 
By MATT PUGLISI 
SportS Writer 
After more than two months of individual competition. including prestigious international tourna­ments such as the World Cup in November and the North American Cup in both December and January, Notre Dame finally takes to the strips as a team when the Irish travel to the Big Apple to fight in the New York Duals Sunday morning at 8 a.m. 
In addition to host New York University, Columbia, St. John's, Yale, Stanford and bitter rival Ohio State .are all slated to attend. 

"It's going to be a really good tournament," freshman epee Greg Howard said. "I think our two biggest competitors are Ohio State and St. John's, but a lot of the other teams like Columbia and Yale aren't as strong all around, but they have very good individual teams, so that's going to be tough for us -but I think we're in good shape." 
The match against the Buckeyes will mark the first of three consecutive weeks the top­ranked Notre Dame and Ohio State programs lock horns-the Irish host the Buckeyes next weekend while Ohio State returns the favor a week later. 
The men's squad shouldn't have too much trouble remem­bering what happened the last time the Irish visited New York last January. 
Entering the New York Duals on an 87-match regular season winning streak dating back to 2000. then-No. 1 Notre Dame knocked off Yale (21-6), Columbia (14-13) and New York (18-9) before crossing swords with then-No. 4 St. John's. 
The Red Storm proved too much for the young and inexpe­rienced Irish, topping Notre Dame 6-3 in all three weapons for an 18-9 victory. 
The loss halted the Irish win­ning streak at 90 regular season matches and snapped the third longest streak in the program's storied history-Notre Dame won 122 consecutive matches from 1975-80 and 98 straight from 1984-88. 
The women dominated compe­tition lasi January in their most recent New York Duals appear­ance, trouncing Yale (21-6). St. John's (18-9). New York (24-3) and Stanford (24-3) before escaping with a 14-13 nail-bitter against Columbia. 
Following Sunday's team sea­son-opening tournament, the Irish return home to host the Notre Dame Duals .Jan. 29-30 at the Joyce Center before traveling south to Columbus. Ohio the fol­lowing weekend to compete in the Ohio State Duals Feb. 5 to kick off a brutal schedule.

Belles visit Tri-State for must-win contest 

By KEVIN BRENNAN Sporrs Writer 

With Wednesday's 64-63 win over Kalamazoo, the Belles moved into a three-way tie with Kalamazoo and Tri-State for fourth place in the MIAA. Saint Mary's will visit Tri-State Saturday at 1 p.m., looking to fur­ther cement its place in the con­ference. The Belles view the con­test as a must-win game. 
"This game is even more important than the last one," guard Allison Kessler said. "We are currently in a three-way tie. Hopefully, a win Saturday can help us come up and be alone in fourth place." 
With the regular season wind­
ing down, each successive game 
makes the postseason picture a 
little clearer. The Belles have 
made it a priority to finish the 
regular season in front of Tri­
State and Kalamazoo. 

"Our goal is to finish fourth 
because then we get to host our 
first-round game in the confer­
ence tournament." Kessler said. 

Belles' goals on Saturday will be an offensively explosive Tri-State squad. The Thunder top the con­ference in scoring, putting up an impressive 79.6 points per game. Senior center Nicki Bergman leads the Tri-State attack, averag­ing 12.9 points per contest. 
"They are a very up-tempo team," Kessler said. "They like to push the ball and shoot a lot of three's." 
The Thunder defense has not 
been quite as effective. Tri-State 
full court presses its opponent the 
entire game, but ranks last in the 
conference in team defense. The 
Thunder surrender 87.3 points 
per game. 

"We just want to break their 
press and get easy shots -get 
some layups," Kessler· said. "We 
want to match their tempo and 
try to slow them down as much as 
possible." 

The Belles did an excellent job 
of this the last time these two 
teams clashed. On Dec. 11, Saint 
Mary's defeated the Thunder 95­

The Irish allowed three power play goals to the Huskies in Tuesday's game, in a performance eerily similar to several others throughout the season. Notre Dame's 80.4 percent penalty killing rate is currently the worst in the CCIIA -and a far cry from last season's conference-lead­ing 87.3 percent. 
The Irish will need to fix their killing woes quickly, with the Badgers currently connect­ing at a 24.3 percent clip ­third-best in the nation.

Defeating Notre Dame's solid doubles teams will be a tough chore for the Buckeyes, who are also taking the courts for the first time this season. 
Ohio State graduated four seniors last year, and expect to rely on the experience of senior veterans like captain Lindsey Adams and last sea­son's MVP Emily DeCamilla. Adams and De Camilla both scored 18 wins last spring and look to break the 20-win mark this season. Last sea­son, the Irish bested the Buckeyes 5-2 and have won eight matches in a row against Ohio State.

I played for [Wisconsin coach Mikel Eaves when he was an assistant coach with the Philadelphia "Flyers, and we had been talking for a while about getting the series going again. 
"You can benefit a great deal from playing a good team at this point in the year." 
In its games against Wisconsin last season, both at Madison, the Irish came away with a 2-2 tie and a 3-1 win over the fourth-ranked Badgers. This season, the story is much different as Wisconsin comes into the Joyce Center as one of the top teams in the country, while Notre Dame sits in last place in the CCHA. 
Poulin says his team still has a chance to make some noise late in the season, however. 
"You're playing one of the top teams in the country ­what better way to send the message that you're still alive and kicking," he said. "That's what I told our guys,. we're still going to be a force down 
saw a win against the Irish was in 1990, when they won 7-2 in Columbus. 
After facing Ohio State, the Irish will host Vanderbilt, whose team has already seen its share of success this sea­son. At 2-0, the Commodores have posted wins against Michigan State (7 -0) and Virginia {5-2). 
Thompson said although the Commodores look to be tough opponents, the team feels it is more than prepared for any challenges it might face. 
"I feel like our team is espe­cially close this year and that will make us a stronger team," Thompson said. "There are times when you have to find it within yourself to come up with more to win. Knowing your team believes in you is huge, especially when you're in a tight match."

MEN'S TRACK 

Competition kicks off on Friday 
By NATHAN DYER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track and field team kicks off its home season tonight as it welcomes DePaul, Loyola, Western Michigan, Hillsdale College and Michigan State to the Loftus Sports Center. This weekend is the first of three consecutive weekends of home meets. 
After last week's away meet at Central Michigan, of which only a limited contingent of runners attended, Friday's meet will be the first meet for many of the younger team members. Likewise, this will be the first meet of the season for all of the distance runners, as none participated at Central Michigan. 
"This meet will be used as a measuring stick to determine our progress up to this point in the season," assistant coach Tim Connelly said. "This will be the first competition for a lot of people, [and] we have a lot of runners experimenting with running differ­ent races." 
This is not to say the meet will not be competitive, as many look to run qualifying times for the Big East indoor championships. Defending Big East champion Selim Nurudeen ran like the defending champion at last week's meet, and looks to improve this week. 
Running out of Friendswood, Texas, Nurudeen has won three consecutive Big East titles in the 110-meter hurdles and last year won the 60-rneter hurdles. This year Nurudeen is looking to defend his Big East titles and take a shot at Nationals, where he finished in the top 10 at the 2004 NCAA Outdoor Championship. 
As for the distance runners, sen­ior Ryan Johnson looks to lead a talented group of runners into their first meet of the season. Johnson captured the Big East out­door crown in the steeplechase in 2004, and looks to add more titles to his name as the season evolves. The meet starts at 5:30 p.m. tonight with the long jump opening the field events. Track events begin at 7 p.m. with the running of the women's 500-meter.

Irish start indoor season 
By RYAN KIEFER 
Sports Writ~r 
Slowly but surely, the Notre Dame women's track team is being revealed. 
Each week, coach Tim Connelly is putting forth a lineup closer and closer to the one he hopes will win the conference title later this season. That line­up will come into even greater focus tonight. After sending a partial squad to Central Michigan for last weekend's sea­son-opening meet, the Irish will have a majority of their athletes competing in their first home meet tonight at the Notre Dame Indoor Opener. 
Ranked No. 11 by Trackwire.com, the Irish are coming off a solid performance last weekend in which they cap­tured three victories, and record­ed personal best performances in the weight throw and 60­meter dash. While last week­end's meet focused on jumpers, sprinters and throwers, tonight's meet will have a broader empha­sis. 
"We will be well-rounded this weekend," Connelly said. "We're adding some middle distance and distance runners and we're moving some sprinters to differ­ent races. We feel we'II be a fac­tor in all events." 
An issue the Irish have faced in the early stages of the season is the question of training intensity. The Irish have decided to contin­ue hard training in the initial stages of the season in an effort to be in peak condition for the Big East and NCAA meets.. Sacrificing performance in early meets is often a result of such a training schedule. Connelly made it clear that competitiveness should be the goal at every meet. 
"It's expected that the athletes compete hard in every meet. They are not totally rested for this weekend, but we feel they are in a position to give a great effort and hit some times that will qualify them for the Big East Championships," he said. 
Tonight's meet will feature sev­eral Midwest schools including Western Michigan, llillsdale, Loyola (Chicago) and DePaul. While none of these teams are ranked in Trackwire's top 25, they bring some quality athletes that will present a challenge for the Irish tonight at Loftus Center. 
"There will be an increased level of competition [tonight[." Connelly said. "It will be more intense, and I think our kids are ready to take this step up."

top-15 teams. 

''I'm happy with the way things are going," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "But we're coming into another really tough stretch with a couple more ranked teams." 
This stretch begins with Rutgers, who is coming off a 74­40 drubbing of Providence. 
Led by freshman Matee Ajavon's 13.7 points per game, the Scarlet Knights have knocked off the likes of then-No. 1 LSU, then-No. 8 Tennessee and then­No. 4 Texas, all in just one week. 
Rutgers is also undefeated in Big East play, but they have played St. John's, Pittsburgh, Georgetown and Providence, four of the weaker teams in the league. 
The Scarlet Knights have bene­fited from the return of senior guard Cappie Pondexter, who has played in seven games after missing the first semester of play. 
She was a third-team All­American as a junior, and a unanimous selection to the All­Big East first team. 
However, the point guard is not the only weapon the Scarlet Knights have this season. Junior forward Michelle Campbell is averaging 13.1 points per game to go along with 6.1 rebounds. 
Rutgers has historically played the Irish tough. Last season, the Scarlet Knights upset the Irish 69-55 at the Louis Brown Athletic Center, known as the RAC. 
Rutgers beat Notre Dame later in the season as well, upsetting the No. 2-seeded Irish in the sec­ond round of the Big East tour­nament, 51-45, despite playing with just eight players. 
The Irish hope to end this streak Sunday afternoon, as they try to extend their two-game winning streak. 
Notre Dame was led Wednesday night by Courtney LaVere, who played for the first time without a knee brace since her arthroscopic knee surgery in December. LaVere recorded 13 points, all in the first half, and 10 rebounds, for her second double­double of the season. 
All-American Jacqueline Batteast has led the Irish all sea­son, putting up 19 points on 7­for-13 shooting Wednesday. Batteast has had scoring help from point guard Megan Duffy, who scored 17 points Wednesday night. Freshman Charel Allen added a career-high 17 points off the bench as well. 
The Irish offense has been very balanced all season. 
"I think we're starting to get a little more comfortable," McGraw said. "I think different people are stepping up and play­ing well, we're having a lot more options." 
Tip-off is Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. at the Joyce Center.

Home away from home 
Irish look to extend five-game win streak in the MCI Center 
By MATT LOZAR Spons Wrirer 

In the middle of their three­game road trip, the Irish get to travel to their second home. 
Riding a two-game road Big East winning streak, the Irish (12-3, 4-1 Big East) face the Hoyas (11-5 3-2) in the MCI Center Sunday, a building where Notre Dame has won its last five games. 
And there have been some memorable ones. 
In the 2002 BB&T Classic. Notre Dame beat No. 9 Maryland and No. 2 Texas dur­ing a week where th·e Irish defeated three top-1 0 teams and jumped from unranked to No. 10 in the AP poll. 
The season before, Notre Dame and Georgetown played the longest game in school his­tory -a four-overtime classic where the Irish prevailed 116­111. 
"How can you forget? It feels like we played an entire day there," Irish senior Jordan Cornette said. "Georgetown loves to give us games and we love to give them some." 
Chris Thomas -then a freshman -played all 60 min­utes and his feet reminded him in the locker room afterwards.

The Irish come into Friday's game having lost their most recent match, 6­2, against Michigan Tech in Green Bay, Wis., on Tuesday night. Notre Dame coach Dave Poulin said his team missed a r.harH'P to gain some positive monwn­tum against a Michigan Tech squad that had only won two games before fac­ing the Irish. 
"We were really disap­pointed," Poulin said. "The reason that you schedule non-conference games is to

Talent and confidence make for a potent combination. 
Fortunately, these commodi­ties are coming in bulk this sea­son for the talent-laden Notre Dame team. 
Although the Irish graduated Alicia Salas, ranked No. 22 nationally last season, the team has proven itself capable of great success already this year. 
"Everyone has been playing 
so well lately in practices." sophomore Christian Thompson said. "We have so much talent on our team. I think everyone is excited to see how far we can go this season." 
The No. 21 Irish will face their first test of the season at Ohio State Saturday and are set to host No. 6 Vanderbilt on Sunday at 12 p.m. 
Thompson anticipates that both matches will prove to be challenging, but believes the team is more than capable of holding its own. 
"I think Ohio State will be hard because it's the first match of the season, and Vanderbilt has a great team," Thompson

By AMANDA MICHAELS 
In Focus Writer 

Only in the political arena could a duty performed in the name of efficiency turn into a drawn-out and com­plex process -irony at its finest, and exactly what stu­dent government leaders entered into when they took on the awesome task of restructuring the student union constitution at the beginning of the 2004-05 school year. 
After months of sometimes heated, sometimes philo­sophical, sometimes nit-pick­ing debate, a constitution granting a drastic reorgani­zation to the student union was approved the night before its new leaders were to take office. 
Even with flow charts to guide the way, the new sys­tem can be disorienting, including for those acquaint­ed with the old one. 
But while a confusing organization is never a plus, the restructured constitution produced a student union with more across-the-board student representation and power -an agreeable bene­fit to the addition of more layers of bureaucracy. 
To put the new system into· perspective, the old one must be clarified. 
Prior to this year, the stu­dent body president was truly the head of the govern­ment. Under the president was the vice president, who chaired the Student Union Senate, which was comprised by a set of standing commit­tees. 
The president was also connected to the Executive Cabinet, made up of a repre­sentative group of govern­ment bodies including the Office of the President, the Student Union Board, the Hall Presidents' Council, the Club Coordination Council, the Class Councils and the Off-Campus Council. 
The Judicial Council presi­dent was the student body president's link to the Judicial Council, as the stu­dent union treasurer was the bridge to the Financial Management Board. 
In this organization, the power to legislate was large­ly isolated in the Senate, while the power to imple­ment fell to the president ­with the guidance of the Executive Cabinet. Then-stu­dent body president Pat Hallahan found this division to be hurting the productivity of the student union, and led the charge for a massive overhaul. 
Though the revamped con­stitution features many sweeping changes, one of the most noticeable is the trans­formation of the Executive Cabinet into the Council of Representatives. Members from every governing body sit on COR, and because of 
this complete representation, the group was originally granted both the power to approve the budget and amend the constitution. The latter power has since been transferred back to the Senate. 
COR joins the two divisions of the new system together ­the policy branch and the programming branch. 
The policy branch, presided over by the student body vice president, is comprised of the Executive Policy Board and the Student Senate. The presidentially-nominated chairs of the six standing committees (University Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Affairs, Diversity, Gender Relations and Oversight) sit on the Executive Policy Board, and at least one senator must sit on every committee. 
This design forces the Office of the President to work more closely with the Senate's standing commit­tees. 
The programming branch is led by the chief executive assistant -formerly the chief of staff. Previously the chief of staff was solely in charge of running the Office of the President. 
The rest of its members are made up primarily of the sec­ond-in-commands for the bodies most concerned with programming: CCC, SUB, HPC, Class Councils andOff­Campus Council. 
As current chief executive assistant Dave Baron explained, the Executive Programming Board assigns a specific role to the student leaders who once lacked a defined function. 
The fusion of legislative and executive powers into the Student Senate may cre­ate a relatively weaker stu­dent body president and less immediate results, but subse­quent decisions will have been funneled through a group of men and women representing every under­graduate at Notre Dame. 
Likewise, the division of the government bodies into two different branches and their reintegration in COR may create more levels of bureau­cracy, and thus more debate and red tape, to drag ideas through. 
Delegating specific func­tions to each branch, howev­er, can lead to increased effi­ciency if utilized correctly, and the slower process of approval ensures that every proposal that makes it out bears the approval of the widest band of representa­tion the student government could afford. 
Though it took up the stu­dent government's time for almost a year, the effort pro­duced an imperfect yet decidedly better and certain­ly laudable result.

These two proposals were attractive enough to gain stu­dent support while addressing the important issues of dorm cohesion and off-campus safnty; so why have the initial visions become so drastically different'? 
The initial visions were too inflexible, leaving little wiggle room for the inevitable adminis­trative revisions. Basing your eampaign and the initial push of your term on a spneifie issue that the administration has soundly and repeated rejoetod is setting up for failure, and docs nothing to remedy the sit­uation. Had tho Office of the President started with broader coneepts that could be eventu­ally refined to solid proposals, it might have made more head­way toward its goals and with the Board of Trustees.

In his State of the Union, Istvan emphasized the impor­tance of focus, and listed a number of things he would like to aehieve before leaving olliee, including forming an ad-hoe committee to foeus on the caus­es and potential remedies of eating disorders at Notre Dame, bringing a national newspaper to eampus for student reader­ship and making eourse packets available for purchase with a student account. 
As far as visible results go, all three are entirely possible and desirable. However, Istvan and Bell should hope to lcavn behind a legacy of more than just myopic suceesses. 
A renewed "focus" on the eampaign ideal of reducing stu­dent apathy, or a broadening of the ot'f-eampus security lens could prove to be lasting priori­ties long after the next new leaders take oftice on April 1.

When they took office in April, student body president Adam Istvan and vice president Karla Bell were novices to stu­dent government which they claimed was not a flaw, but an asset. They promised to bring a fresh approach to gover­nance that would address the. average student's needs and combat the rash of apathy on cam­pus. This was reflected in their campaign platform promises of bringing DVD rentals to LaFortune, Fair Trade coffee to the dining halls and SYRs back to the dorms. 
Of these pledges, Istvan and Bell delivered two out of three. While the first two were accom­plished efficiently near the start of the fall semester, the third -the keystone of their cam­paign platform -was soon confir'med as too ambitious and potentially damaging to campus social life to pursue. It was abandoned in silence -leaving a hole in the voters' expectations and in the term's plans. 
Taking the SYR's place as a hot-button issue gone stale was the SafeBus plan, the center of Istvan, Bell and chief executive assistant Dave Baron's fall off~campus security report to the Board of Trustees. Though the Trustees embraced three lesser safety measures in the report, they criticized Istvan, Bell and Baron's decision to bring the SafeBus idea to their attention before propos­ing it to the Campus Life Council and the Office of Student Affairs. 
Their vision for the remaining months of their term -a BOT report focusing on creating a welcoming environment for diversity at Notre Dame -seems thus far to be correcting the mis· takes of their first report by focusing more on overarching concepts and student concerns than detailed plans. But without specifics, it's a bit too early to give the gold star. 
Istvan, Bell and Baron earn points. for cultivat­ing strong relationships with other student gov· ernment bodies, securing a visible, if minor, legacy for themselves and learn~ lng to navigate the intri· cacies of the new student union constitution. But because they struggled with the details of their plans, they could not deliver on their biggest promises to students.

Overall: A-Effort: A Results: B 
The senators have had a mixed term thus far, with great results like wrapping up the long TCE battle and directly responding to the basketball ticketing problem; a number of small victories like the non-discrimination amendment; and a slew of great ideas currently stalled in committee. Hopefully the group will be able to continue their forward momen­tum and push many of those works-in­progress into resolutions before April 1. Committee on Gender Relations: B 
This committee ran a successful Sexual Assault Awareness Week cam­paign that synthesized the use of statis­tics and open, cross-gender discussion to address a sensitive issue. If it approaches the upcoming Eating Disorders Awareness Week in a similar fashion, it should be able to make head­way with Notre Dame's silent affliction. Committee on University Affairs: B+ 

This committee was a major force in securing Fair Trade coffee and the Ticket Share program. It has strong projects in the works, including drafting a resolution to put a student on the Board of Trustees, addressing concerns about the Counseling Center and seeking to reduce punishment for parietals viola­tions instead of abolishing parietals. Committee on Academic Affairs: A-
This committee capped off three years of work in conjunction with former presi­dent Jeremy Lao and academic delegate Jeremy Staley with the creation of the Student Course Evaluation System. It is also bringing a College Readership pilot program to campus in February, and is working to improving the way class regis­tration times are assigned. Committee on Diversity Affairs: C 
This committee's major projects ­
Gay, Lesbian, Questioning Week and Diversity Awareness Week -have not yet occurred, so it currently has little to show for its work. It did, however, push through the commendable non-dis­crimination amendment to the constitu­tion. Committee on Residence Life: A· 
This committee is arguably the most accomplished-of the six. It has worked to get the dorm printer pilot program off the ground, made significant headway toward reversing the laundry and vend­ing price hike, met with the bookstore about securing a student discount and brought student concerns about ticket­ing and parking to the administration. Committee on Oversight: B 
This committee is the hardest to assess, because they have had the dif­ficult and tedious task of sorting through the kinks of the new constitu­tion without visible results. But they have passed an amended senatorial attendance policy, and will bring two resolutions to the floor next week. regarding issues of presidential atten­dance at policy board meetings and the schedule of meetings for the Executive Programming Board.

B 

Unlike the Senate, the Council of Representatives does not possess the power to pass legislation, which makes for an indefinite presence and little direct impact on students. But the council has fought its relative lack of political power by making use of its true functions -as a discussion forum and sounding board for the student body president. 
In that vein, the council played a key role in the solidifica­tion of several of Adam lstvan"s projects this term. Discussions from COR meetings helped Istvan refine his off-campus security proposal for the Board of Trustees and his Ticket Share solution to the shortage of men's basket­ball tickets. However, because the value of these objectives is debatable -for example, much COR dicussion was devoted to the SafeBus, which the Trustees were unenthu­siastic about -the council must be careful not to waste its time with the unrealistic. 
Furthermore, despite their help in shaping Istvan's plans, many council members did not offer significant plans of their own -hurting the president's chances to truly repre­sent the needs of the student body. The council should take advantage of its potential to guide and mold the president as much as he guides and molds the council. In order for COR to make the most of its time and purpose, it must be proactive in engaging many members' original ideas.

Following a year when many perceived SUB as not adequately responding to students' interests, this year's programmers refocused on the basics, most importantly SUB's accountability to the student body. They deserve credit for organizing a variety of cre­ative, well-attended events, such as the Fireside Chats series and new Battle of the Bands. The board also ran successful, fair and user~friendly student ticket lotteries for away football games. On the everyday scale, accountability was achieved. But because SUB has not yet brought major performers or large­scale events to campus -the only factor that matters in the eyes of many students -doing well with the basics isn't doing enough.

Group fights efficiency obstacles 
Members emphasize dialogue but lack productivity 

JOANNA PAXTON/The Observer 
David Moss, left, assistant vice president for Student Affairs and co-chair of the CLC's social concerns committee, speaks at a meeting. The council is composed of facutty, administrators and students. 
By MADDIE HANNA In Focus Wri tcr 
Given tho diversity in the age, rolns and interests of its mem­bers, the Campus I .ile Council has made admirable strides toward more productive and informed dialogue, but greater etliciency must be achieved before their ideas can bo realized. 
CLC, which brings together stu­dents, faculty, administration and rectors biweekly to discuss issues and propose changes to Student All'airs, often falls under fire for lhiling to produce visible results. 
This year has beon no excep­tion. as the three committees that comprise the CLC have focused on tasks described as "attain­able," but have yet to attain any­thing. 
According to Adam Istvan, stu­dent body president and CLC chair, the composition of the organization often restricts its productivity. A two-thirds vote is required to make a recommenda­tion to Student Allairs, but mem­bers of the administration com­prise just over one third of the group, so student-backed issues are easily stalled, he said. 
"It's an interesting group in that it's hard to get anything contro­versial through -we can't just go !,'llllg-ho and try to implement our policies as students," Istvan said. 
Last semester, CLC made no recommendations to Student Affairs. Istvan did not express concern at this slow pace, emphasizing the research and dialogue components. 
"The discussion is more impor­tant than actual policy recom­mendations," said Istvan, who admitted that CLC is "not the most effective way to recommend things to Father Poorman." 
Because its term begins at the start of fall semester, CLC faces a dilferent calendar than other stu­dent government bodies that begin their new terms in April. 

"We're basically robbing our­solves of two, three months of productivity -you don't have a chance to get things rolling," Istvan said. · 
CLC has made successful pro­posals in the past. By November 2003, the group had already managed to approve a widely respected resolution to investi­gate resident assistant training. This measurn both addressed an important campus issue -at the time, RAs were being fired because of scheduling conflicts ­while earning credibility for itself as a group. So a lack of action should not be pinned solely on matters of time or group compo­sition. 
CLC is comprised of three task forces -vending, security and social concerns. These commit­tees are all currently in the research stage and are confident­ly pursuing what they view as attainable goals. 
The vending task force is inves­tigating the recent increase in laundry and vending prices on campus, aiming to write a pro­posal regarding this issue by the beginning of spring semester. 
The security task force is trying to raise awareness of crime and safety issues around campus ­goals related to those outlined in Istvan's Board of Trustees report, and thus an avenue for increased productivity. 
"I think the realistic goals that we're shooting for right now are finding a better way for students to regularly be aware of instances involving crime and security serv­ices, possibly through a section in The Observer or a ListServ e­mail," Alex French, O'Neill sena­tor and committee chair, said.

Although the Campus Life Council has little to show after a semester of meetings, most of its time has been spent building toward more concrete accom­plishments that should material­ize this spring, due largely to the efforts of dedicated committee chairs who handled a great deal of legwork. The council's mem­bers have done an excellent job of using their biweekly meetings as a forum. To take the next step, the council needs to instill a sense of urgency into its conver­sations and focus on implement­ing more visible changes to the Notre Dame community. 

standing of social diversity and create a means of increasing diversity awareness on Notre Dame's campus. 
Cavanaugh senator and com­mittee chair Jordan Bongiovanni explained that although the com­mittee was initially interested in instituting a mandatory social awareness class for all Notre Dame students, it is now realizing much more research is needed. 
Bongiovanni said while the committee might not be able to take action thi'i year, it will com­pile, organize and translate the information for future groups. 
The nature of CLC's dialogue and the dedication of its mem­bers to researching their goals suggest that there should be more to show for their efforts. Though the group's position as an intersection of student desire and administrative action naturally makes productivity more difficult, CLC members need to reassess their approach to the problems, and find the missing link between dialogue, research and results.

Government in brief.. 
Graduate Student Union looks at parking issue 
Over the past semester, the Graduate Student Union has taken action on several issues important to graduate students, as well as encouraged an expansion of the GSU's main goals. 
One of the lirst issues the GSU addressed in tho year was con­cerns about adequate parking. The group is eonducting a survny to determine student satisfaction with the parking program. The survey data will be used to help promote graduate student inter­ests in parking lot re-organization. 
GSU presidnnt John Young said the Graduate student coupon book was another positive program the GSU had sponsornd. 
GSU is also developing plans to assist in lobbying eiTorts to sup­port House Resolution 34.12, a resolution that would modify Internal Hevenue Codn, and the rnncwal of the lligher Education Act. 
The organization also gave sup­port to AllianeeND. an unrncog­nized student group supporting gay and lesbian diversity. The club petitioned the GSU for financial aid in October, which GSU optnd to approve 17-5.

Financial Management Board faces changes 
Adjusting to the 2004 revi­sions to the student union con­stitution, changing how The Shirt fund is distributed and completing a smooth spending review wen1 highlights of the Financial Management Board's activities last semester. 
FMB distributes funding to student organizations and clubs, controls student business operations and also ovnrsees The Shirt project. 
This year marks a change in the policy regarding The Shirt fund. Originally, all Notre Dame students were able to requisi­tion money from The Shirt fund, but this year only under­graduates could petition for money. 
The 2004 studnnt union con­stitution revisions also brought changes to FMB's structure. Where there used to be only two class treasurers on FMB, all four elass treasurers now sit on the board. 
The snmester ended as the new FMB conducted its annual spending review, which indicat­ed that there was a surplus in funds. 
-Paul Spadafora 

Club Coordination Council facilitates activities 
The Club Coordination Council is the organization that facilitates the various activities of all under­graduate clubs, associations and societies at Notre Dame. 
'The main goal of the CCC, how­ever, is to allocate student activity money to the dubs and organiza­tions that will best serve the ND community," president J.R. Garcia said. 
As mediator for the University's extensive collection of clubs, the CCC distributes pertinent informa­tion regarding the issues and activities of undergraduate clubs, recommends funding allotments, serves as an overseeing represen­tative for all undergraduate clubs and promotes etl'ective collabora­tion between various student groups. 
Despite the inauguration of monthly spending reports by the CCC, however, clubs have not wholly complied. In fact, progress has bnen somewhat slow, Garcia said. 
The CCC is currently in the process of creating and maintain­ing a Web page that would allow clubs to submit progress reports so the CCC can better assess its needs. -Katie Perry 

Hall Presidents Council encourages events 
Charged with encouraging unity between dorms while also promoting their individuality, the Hall Presidents Council plays a unique role in campus life. 
"The goal of the council is to be a meeting place and a sounding board for each dorm,"co-presi­dent J.T. Arseniadis said. "We act as a link between the halls and the administration, namely the Student Activities Office....It is a place where halls can convene to discuss collaboration and ideas of how to make dorm life better." 
HPC's focus for the first semes­ter was on hall programming, as the council worked to allocate money to individual dorms to be used to assist in signature dorm events. 
The council has also focused on eliminating extreme dorm com­petition and uniting the dorms. 
Currently, the HPC is working with the Student Athletic Advisory Council to promote sports other than men's basket­ball and football. They plan to have each dorm adopt a team of their choice, hoping this will increase game attendance and athlete appreciation.

"Tho platliJrm we ran under was 'Hinging in Change,' and I think we're doing that," White said. "We're addressing a new era at Saint Mary's with a new College pn~sident. nnw traditions and new buildings on campus. Things arc going wnlllbr us right now." 
J\nd looking at the new and revived programs White and Moran have worked with, tho cam­pus community would have to agree. 
On Nov. 18, Whito gaw1 tho soc­ond annual State of the School 1\ddmss, following in the fool'itops of last year's student body presi­dent, Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl. 
BOG has also teamed with the ()fTice of Civic and Soda! Concerns to bring students the option of Serviee Sundays -an organi:t.ation 

where students can volunteer one day a month without making a largo commitment to one commu­nity organization. 
White and Moran have also rein­stated the "Big Sis, Little Sis" pro­gram, which usod to be a part of tho Saint Mary's campus. 
"We team up sophomores with li-oshmen in their dorm and set up a sort of mentoring situation for each freshman," White said. "Dr. Mooney had this program when she attended Saint Mary's, and she still keeps in touch with her big sis." 
Besides adding new programs, White and Moran have also been working with issues of diversity, organizing fomms and seeking stu­dent feedback about i'i..'iUes impor­tant to the College. 
J\t this point in their term, White and Moran have also taken the time to invite staff members to their weekly BOG meetings in order to stay up-to-date with all events hap­pening around campus. 
And for anyone who thinks White and Moran haven't been working hard, it's time to think again. 
In addition to sitting on various campus committees, heading com­mittees of their own and leading the entire BOG, the two also had the added pressure of planning Mooney's inauguration. 
Together with other boards, White and Moran took on the responsibility of planning an entire week of events for students, faculty and staff, dealing with everything from events to music to organizing the senior class to be decked in their graduation cap and gowns at the event. 
The "Big Sis, Little Sis" program that kicked off Dec.· 3 also took a lot of planning on the part of White and Moran. 
As spring semester begins, White 

and Moran are simply hoping thoir 
last few months in office will run as 
smoothly as their first. 
"It's been an adjustment," Moran 

said. "But, we're enthusiastic. 
We're a small school so we can't do everything, but we can try." 
White said she also plans to 

make the best of the time she has 
left in office. 
"We're realistic about what we 

can aceompli'ih in one term, but we 
want to set others up to succeed 
when we're gone," she said. "Time 
is a factor. We have to be realistic 
and flexible when we're working 
with student schedules. But, we 
have a duty and we were elected to 
represent the students and get 
things done, and that's what we're 
going to do."

During their campaign, student body president Sarah Catherine White and vice president Mary Pauline Moran claimed they were ready to take charge and lead Saint Mary's into the future with the plat­form, "Ringing In Change." 
But in addition to spending a good deal of time planning, working with and welcoming new Saint Mary's President Carol Mooney to campus, the women held up their other campaign promises as well. They provided an approachable and welcoming student government through a variety of activities and office hours, connecting and ener­gizing the upperclassmen and underclassmen and putting a larger emphasis on approaching student needs and concerns realistically. 
White and Moran deserve recog· nition for overcoming budget cuts to lead the Board of Governance without losing any Saint Mary's tra· ditions. They also revived the Big Sis/Little Sis program that was present 30 years ago, teaming up sophomores with freshman to help ease them into the College. 
However, these goals were not particularly ambitious.Meetlng expectations is only commendable when those expectations are set high in the first place, and White and Moran have mostly favored steady leadership over exceeding the status quo. 
With only a few months left in their term, White and Moran need to keep ringing in change with the upcoming opening of the new stu· dent center -but should not stop there If they want to leave a lasting legacy. 

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Student leaders overcotne budget cuts to 1 ring in change' 
Fund constraints force BOG to look to larger programs to achieve promised goals 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
In Focus Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance, led by student body president Sarah Catherine White and vice president Mary Pauline Moran, has kept its promise to "ring in change" despite the con­straints of a campus-wide budget cut. 
"We do not foresee the budget cut causing any difficulty in terms of student government funds," Moran said. "Our treas­urer, Molly Welton, has been dili­gent in making sure all of the [Student Government Association's] allotted money is properly distributed to serve the entire student body." 
According to Welton, the budg­et cut has had a positive effect on student government. It has caused BOG to be more careful with the expenditure of funds, resulting in larger events, such as the Emerson Drive and Blessid Union of Souls concerts, rather than smaller, more frequent events. 
"Because student government's money comes directly from the $150 per student fee, we have refocused our goals so that we're spending our money in ways that it will reach the most students on out campus, and so far l am nml­
  j. 

ly pleased with the results," 
Welton said. 
BOG is composed of 10 boards 

dealing with the areas of admis­
sions, campus foods, alumnae, 
campus dubs, off-campus stu­
dents, mission, public relations, 
technology, women's issues and 
Holy Cross College. 
When White and Moran were 

elected last spring, they promised 
to properly welcome College 
President Carol Mooney and 
oversee the completion and 
opening of Opus Hall, the new 
on-campus apartment complex 
and the new student center. They 
also pledged to provide an outlet 
for increased student volun­
teerism. 
'This year student leaders are 

continuing to lead the student 
body down exciting new avenues. 
These women are in tune with 
campus life and are witnessing 
the progress of a more active stu­
dent body," White said. 
Through cooperation amongst 

the entire Board of Governance 
and the student body, all three 
goals were successfully achieved. 
Mooney was welcomed to the 

College through an ovent called 
"Dessert with Dr. Mooney," jointly 
organized by BOG and tho 
Hesidence llall Association. 
During the program, each resi­
dence hall was able to share an ' evening of dess·ertS and discus­
. . 
' 
sion with their new president. 
BOG has worked to give stu­dents a commitment-free oppor­tunity to give back to the South Bend Community through the creation of "Service Sundays." BOG mission eommissioner Mary Beth Swygart was the primary organizer of this monthly volun­teer excursion to the Christ Child Center. 
BOG has made old traditions new again through the rninstate­ment of the "Big Sis. Little Sis" program, which pairs oach lirst year student with a sophomore. 
As Saint Mary's students anx­iously await the tentatively scheduled March opening of the new student r.enter, BOG is mak­ing plans to utilize it, as Women's Issues commissioner Katie Kelly is co-coordinating the opening or a Womeh's Center in tho building. 
BOG has worked diligently through Kelly and the Student Diversity Board to promote dis­cussion about the definition of a Saint Mary's woman by holding Identity Forums opnn to tho entire studnnt body to increase opnn and honest discussion. 
Based on its suecess thus far, the BOG should continue l.o achieve il'> goals for tho rnst of its term.

B+ 
Despite a bumpy fall semester with the Student Activities Board Pride Week T -shirt debacle, the Board of Governance has continued to thrive this year under the leadership of student body president Sarah Catherine White and vice president Mary Pauline Moran. The 10 boards that comprise BOG have worked together to overcome a lower budget than was expected due to a drop in enrollment. Treasurer Molly Welton has done well putting money into big events and pinching pennies in between. As well as planning the stu· dent side of new College President Carol Mooney's inauguration, BOG has continued to Increase student volunteerism, joined together upper and underclasswomen and allowed students to increase dialogue through a vari· ety of open forums and discussions. However, the board could have done far more if it had not lost several consecutive meetings to the T-shirt issue. While it Is important for BOG to listen to students' concerns, it must retain the same balance in its discussion topics as It does with its funds.

.... STUDENT ACTIVITIES BOARD 
Group makes progress in face ofT-shirt debate 

By APRIL THOMAS and ANGELA 
SAOUD 

In Focus Writers 
Despite recent controversy with the Pride Week T-shirts, the Student Activities Board has continued to provide students with a variety of activities and lead the student body with two recent awards. 
The group faced criticism in September after the board sold a shirt depicting a brown-haired Caucasian woman. Some members of the Saint Mary's community felt the image did not represent all Saint Mary's women. After these concerns were brought to SAB's attention, the board held a series of identity forums and discussions about what it means to be a Saint Mary's woman. 
While listening to student feedback, SAB decided to issue a school-wide apology. However, some students felt as though SAB had tried to gloss over the controversy and held a silent protest and petition signing. 
Another apology was issued to stu­dents shortly thereafter, specifically geared toward the T-shirt debacle. 
But with the controversy dying down, SAB has been able to pave the way for more positive progress. 
The group was named an "All-Star Delegation" this semester at the National Association for Campus Activities Mid-America Conference ­an award based on attendance and participation in specific conference events. 
Individually, representative Donna Lubbers received the region's "Outstanding Undergraduate Student Award" for her leadership and involvement at Saint Mary's. 
In addition to being leaders in the campus community, SAB is also 
responsible for bringing quality entertainment to the college. 
This semester, SAB organized Write the Troops, SMG Singled Out, come­dian Kyle Cease's visit and free movies like "50 First Dates" and "13 Going on 30," as well as planning the annual Jamaica Shaka and Twilight Tailgate. 
But the group's goal was providing big names, such as Blessid Union of Souls at the. TailgatB. 
In October, SAB also arranged a small-scale concert with the well­known country group, Emerson Drive. 
SAB is continually planning events aimed at improving the quality of campus life for Saint Mary's stu­dents.
