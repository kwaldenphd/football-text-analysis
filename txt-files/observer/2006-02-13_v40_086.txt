INSIDE COLUMN 


Getting to -work 
Sunday: the dreaded day when the weekend is drawing to a close and you remember all of the things you have been putting off. After recounting the weekend's festivities you know that the work has to begin. A pile of work lies Deirdre Krasula before you, and you sit down to start, but honestly, Sports Writer you know that something else will once again get in the way. 
The list of things that deter you from doing work is endless. Technology was supposed to make our Jives easier, but ifyou askme, it's only complicated it. Instant messages constantly popping up when you are trying to fmish that paper, Facebook walls that need con­tinual checking, a phone eall that just has to be made -this Jist could go on forever. 
It seems that the only skill I have truly come to perfect is the art of pro­crastination. 100 pages to read tonight? I'll get to that just as soon as "Grey's Anatomy" is over. It's not like TV networks have helped the matter either. It seems that there is always some new show coming out. My room­mate is obsessed with "Ameriean Idol;" I on the other hand am not as big of a fan, but if it's on in the room and I hap­pen to be walking through, I'm done for. I will sadly admit to the fact that I have been known to sit down and watch an episode here and there of "Skating with Celebrities." It's just such great cinematic genius you can't tear your eyes away. I have known people who have been consumed by "Lost." I do believe that a few of them disap­peared for a few days and reemerged having successfully fmished watching the entire first season. Needless to say, they are not available on Wednesday nights if there is a new episode on. 
I have tried to lock myself away from all possible distractions. The second floor of the library seems like as good a place as any to get work done. I've attempted to loek myself away up there in a futile attempt to study. The place is like a black hole. I have spent hours in there trying to cram mountains of information into my head without even realizing that I knew the person sitting two feet away from me. It's one of the few places where ifI sit down and say that I am going to work, some of it actually does get done. Unfortunately, it's also a place where I have a tenden­cy to lose track of the world around me. During study days I went to the library in flip-flops only to emerge four hours later and discover that there were about four inches of snow on the ground. 
Most of the time, though, I can't bring myself to truck to the library, I spend the majority of my time in front of my computer "doing work." I was recently introduced to a Harry Potter quiz online that has eaten up precious hours of study time. When you get down to it, I spend more time saying that I'm going to do work than actually doing it. I admit to my problem, though I doubt that I'll ever really change my ways, no matter how hard I try. 
Come to think of it, I never did fmish that paper.

Notre Da111e Debate Tea111 hosts national tournalllent 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER 
News Writer 
Dozens of students from uni­versities around the country came to Notre Dame this week­end to debate topics ranging from affirmative action to reali­ty television and to sightsee around a campus seeped in tra­dition. 
The Notre Dame Debate Team hosted the Irish Invitational national debate tournament Friday through Sunday. In the tournament, 75 teams of two students apiece competed for top honors in

was reported -calls to the University's toll-free hotline had "virtually ceased" as of Thursday, Crnkovich said. 
Donors possibly affected by the breach were sent a letter Jan. 20 and an e-mail Jan. 21 from Vice President of University Relations Louis Nanni, who advised the group to take appropriate safeguards by visiting a newly-created support Web site and call the toll-free number established by the University. 
Gordon Wishon, chief infor­mation officer for the Office of Information Technologies, said Jan. 22 the University was working with two inde­pendent forensics firms to analyze the server but said the source of the intrusion might never be determined -especially if the hack orig­inated overseas or if several relay sites were involved. 
The ongoing investigation also includes a broader examination of how the University safeguards all confidential information. 
"The Data Oversight Committee, established over one year ago, is taking addi­tional steps to secure University data," Crnkovich said. "This Committee con­tinues to assess the current information technology infra­structure, business processes and acceptable use policies, and make recommendations and improvements for data protection while striking a balance for ease of use and sharing of information in the most optimal manner."

more than 50 classrooms in DeBartolo Hall -a large increase from last year's tour­nament, which hosted only 27 teams. 
The Notre Dame Debate Team is composed of students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross and competes in several national debate tourna­ments each year. The team hosted the event but did not compete. Instead, members organized the tournament and helped competitors find their way around campus. The event was free and open to the public. 
"It was great to show the other kids the school and give them an opportunity to see our campus," said senior Tim Fiorta, captain of the Notre Dame Debate Team's parlia­mentary team. "Everyone ­the coaches and the team mem­bers -were really happy with the way the tournament ran." 
While the Irish Invitational began in the mid-1990's, this was the first year the tourna­ment included policy debate. 
"Policy debate requires a lot more research," Notre Dame Director of Debate Susan Ohmer said. "We put parlia­mentary debate in classrooms on the first two floors of DeBartolo so people stopping in could see the all the different topics, and policy debate was on the third floor." 

Case Western Reserve University won first place in the Varsity Policy category. In Varsity Policy, competitors debate the same topic over the course of the entire academic year. The topic this year con­cerns relations between the United States and China. 
Ferris State won first place in the Varsity Parliamentary cate­gory. Parliamentary debate top­ics changed each round and included current events such as the war in Iraq, immigration policies, affirmative action and US foreign aid to Africa. 
More than 20 schools were invited to the Irish Invitational, including Miami University of Ohio, Marquette University, the University of Illinois and the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
"People love coming to Notre Dame," Ohmer said. "They love going to the bookstore to buy mugs and T-shirts ... this year we [gavel authentic Notre Dame footballs to the top speakers in each category, and they were so excited. I love it."

CHINA 


Business of love gains popularity 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -The gateway to mari­tal bliss has a frosted glass door em blazoned with two candy-apple red hearts and lots of computers. 
Introducing the Beijing Military and Civilian Matchmaking Service, one of a growing number of Chinese companies that are marry­ing high technology and low-tech tradition to spawn romantic unions. 
Homance and marriage have changed drastically in China after 25 years of breakneck economic growth and looser social controls. 
In a country now wide open to Western influences, even Valentine's Day is making inroads, with chocolates, dinner dates, flow­ers and cards all becoming popular expressions of affection on the occasion -dubbed Qing Hen Jie, or Lovers' Day. 
For centuries, families relied on village matchmakers. Then came communist-era unions, sanctioned -and sometimes arranged -by government companies for their employees. 
Today, the search is driven by personal choice, sped up by the convenience of the latest technolo­
gy. 

"China is now l'rne and transpar­ent. Everyone has tho freedom to find their partner," said Wang Peng, a divorced 43-year-old who was making his first visit to the Beijing service.

white students with popped collars -and one Ilispanic student. ­
Notre Dame football also sclrved as the subject of sever­al skits. In a parody of the Superfan sketches from "Saturday Night Live," Superfans of head coach Charlie Weis predicted "Da Irish" would beat Georgia Tech in the opening game of the 2006 sp,ason by a score of 256 to negative four. They opined that Notre Dame jun­ior football wide receiver Jeff Samardzija would emerge vic­torious in a game against a team of sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. 
One of the most well received skits centered on Sergeant Tim McCarthy, the famous pun announcer at Notre Dame football games. In the skit, McCarthy is pulled over by the police for driving under the influence when the policeman finds a dead prosti­tute in the backseat. The McCarthy impersonator tries to use his jokes to get out of an arrest, but is led away by a police officer while saying "Hemember, if you get behind the wheel while hammered, you just might get nailed in the prison shower." 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's girls were also the brunt of many jokes. In a skit titled "Indiana Jones and the Basilica of Doom," Jones embarked on a quest to obtain the Golden V-virgin­ity -which lay under the protection of HesLife. He found the Golden V and replaced it with an item of equal worth -a case of Keystone Light. When Indiana returned from his mission with the Golden V, he was surprised to see his young sidekick already had two and asked where he got them. The sidekick replied, "I went over to Saint Mary's. They give them out for free." 
ResLife was another popu­lar victim of the Hevue's humor. Keenan resident Michael Varley sang "REScape," a song to the tune of Enrique Iglesias's "Escape." Varley sang, "You can run, you can hide, but you can't escape HesLife." In another skit, a Keenan Geisha berated a lower Geisha for breaking parietals. 
Two skits transferred com­puter or Internet programs into real life. In "Facebook Party," a male Notre Dame student sent the "Facebook guy" to poke a potential love interest, and later a "beauti­ful bus" ran the girl over. The skit ended in a confrontation between Facebook and MySpace. 


Members of Keenan 4 North brought the computer game Oregon Trail to life. As they traveled along the trail, they discovered "wild fruit" -rep­resented by a flamboyantly gay man wearing a "Gay? Fine by Me" shirt. 
The Keenan Revue is known for testing the bounds of pro­priety, and this year was no different. One skit showed severely disabled people com­peting in the Special Olympics version of Global Guts.' The Keenan Revue News displayed a picture depicting University President Father Jenkins as the lead actor in the sequel to the movie "The Forty-Year­Old Virgin." 

Notre Dame sophomore Kathleen Karrenbauer attend­ed the show Friday night. 
"I think I liked the Oregon Trail part the most, and [I liked I the fruit scene because that was so unexpncted," Karrenbauer said. "The hand­icapped one I really dido 't know what to think ... It was funny, but at the same time, I was like, 'I can't believe they just did that.' But that's the whole point of the Keenan Revue."

Cable legislation could lower bills 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Most cable TV subscribers would save money if allowod to pay fm only the channols they want, a Fedenll Communications Commission study said Thursday, reversing the agency's earlier f'inding that con­sumers wouldn't bonofit. 
The analysis by FCC staff' provides nnw support f'or consurrwr groups and conservatives pushing for a pirk-and-ehooso pricing system to replaco thn bundled serviens offered by the cable industry. Cable compa­nies fear that would diminish their wide distribution. 
The study gives added ammuni­tion to lawmakers and rogulators who see "a Ia carte" as a way to dean up raunchy telovision by giv­ing parents more control over tho channols their children watch. 
"I am pleased that tho commission has coneluded that 'a Ia carte' ofTer­ing could roduco consumers' cable bills by as much as 13 percent," said Sen. John McCain, B-Ariz., who plans to introduce legislation next wenk to create and promote usn of the Ia carte system.

selection of speakers tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
"The Vagina Monologues" was a primary point of con­cern in University president Father John Jenkins' January speeches on Catholic charac­ter and academic freedom, as Jenkins questioned the play's continued presence -per­formed annually each February -on campus. The president did not issue a firm policy in favor of or against the "Monologues" and other events, but said he hoped to make a decision

"I fail to see, however, how the annual performance of 'The Vagina Monologues' is the appropriate means to these ends," he said. 
While the panel discussions, already in the works in late December, were not direct results of Jenkins' speech, the variety of viewpoints they offer will potentially satisfy some of the criticisms leveled at "The Vagina Monologues," said Gail Bederman, history professor and organizer of the panels. 
"My impression is that a lot of the people who object to 'The Vagina Monologues' ... say that students are not get­ting authentic Catholic teach­ings when they see the play, so, I thought, 'Let's have a dis­cussion right in the theatre after the performance,"' she said. "]In the panels] there will be orthodox Catholic takes, feminist takes, anthro­pological takes, sociological 
takes .. . This way the audi­ence gets clear doctrine along­·side an under­standing of the ways that the Church wrestles with the difficul­ty of living in modern society."

and sociology professor Jackie Smith; Tuesday's includes the­ology professors Mary Doak and Reverend Paulinus Odozor and anthropology professor Carolyn Nordstrom; · and Wednesday's includes theology professor Mary Hose D'Angelo and .Jean Porter, as well as a second appearance by Nordstrom. 
OnP of the theologians par­ticipating each night will pres­ent the orthodox Catholic doc­trine on sexuality, while the other will "discuss how theolo­gians are dialoguing with cur­rent experience," Bederman said. 
The panels will begin at 9:15 
p.m. in the same venue as each night's 7 p.m. "Monologues" performance ­101 DeBartolo Hall tonight and Tuesday, and 102 DeBartolo on Wednesday. Bederman said she hopes even those who may shy away from seeing "The Vagina Monologues" will engage in the subsequent discussions. 
The student organizers of "The Vagina Monologues" responded positively to the addition of the panels. 
"We welcome the academic discussion and 
more comfort­
able with the presence of this show on cam­pus knowing that the theologi­cal perspective will be clearly presented in conjunction with each performance." 
They are, however, more ambivalent when it comes to the change in setting from last year's DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. Even though organizers said they appreciate the dialogue gener­ated by this year's show, they face the difficulties of staging a play in a classroom and not a theatre and regret the lack of fundraising opportunities in the new academic environ­ment, Weisenbecker said. 
But the change in fundrais­ing policy has lifted a degree of stigma from the event. This year, Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Right to Life will not be protesting the performance, as the group has in the past. 
"[Right to Life's I problems with the event were always in the fact that money from ("The Vagina Monologues"] was going toward the YWCA 
and the SOS, which are groups that on the national level have an anti-life sentiment," said club secretary Ian McDole. 
Bederman said while the current situation may not please everyone or drastically 
lessen the  con­ 
troversy  sur­ 
rounding  the  

play, it takes a step toward pre­serving academic 
freedom on campus. 
"One of the things that should happen at Notre Dame is dialogue between people that have conflicting opin­ions," she said. "With the panel discussions, we are con­fronting speech that is per­haps problematic not with censorship, but with more speech."

All the film screenings were either sold out or 
 nearly sold out, Laina said, and turnout for the various panel discussions was also strong. Due to high demand, organizers added a second screening of "Brokeback Mountain" to the schedule and tickets sold out in two hours, Laina said. The quality and diversity of the films shown this year played a role in the success of the film series, Laina said. The presence of two of the films' directors ­Miguel Albaladejo. director of "Cachorro" and Don Roos, director of "Happy Endings" -on campus to speak first­hand about their work was also significant, Laina said. Junior Mac Russell saw every film at the event's inauguration two years ago and attended two screenings -"Brokeback Mountain" and "Happy Endings" -this year. He said he made the effort to go to the film series out of his own desire to see the movies and to show sup­port for AllianceND, Notre Dame's unrecognized gay/straight student group. 
"[The series has] only been getting bigger -more social events, [morel movies ... I'm always amazed at the 

issues of

ty," Sainz said. "That's not what it's about. It's about films." 
After attending several different screenings and panel discussions over the course of the film series, graduate student Theresa O'Byrne said her favorite 
movies were "Saving Face" and "Happy Endings." 
A member of AllianceND, O'Byrne said since the event is spurring controversy it was especially important that she attend to show her sup­port. 
''I'm a big supporter of academic free­dom and it's always been an issue for me 

through my college career," O'Byrne said. "Part of inquiry and part of academ­ic discussion is to look into these things that are poten­tially explosive." 
O'Byrne said she does not like the fact that the name of the film series was changed, but she was heart­ened by Jenkins' willingness to engage in open discussion about academic freedom. 
"''m pleased that he's at least brought this up -at least had the courage to stand up and bring this to the floor and [not] sweep it under the rug," O'Byrne said. 
Senior Tiffany Thompson attended the 7 p.m. screen­ing of "Brokeback Mountain" Thursday wear­ing an orange "Gay? Fine by me" T-shirt. She said she has attended at least one film during the series every year. 
. "I think [the name change] is kind of silly," Thompson said. "I don't think it is a huge thing but I didn't think it was necessary either ... We're doing the same thing." 
Freshman Sean Gaffney also attended "Brokeback Mountain" Thursday and said he was there first to see a good film and second to find out what all the dis­cussion was about. 
"I guess it's kind of a big controversy and it is always good to be knowledgeable about what is being talked about," Gaffney said. 
Laina, who will not be at Notre Dame next year, said the future of the film series 

"It is important that ifstudents and alumni feel that this event is important ... lit is] valuable that they express those views to the president. " 
Martin Laina film series co-chair 
is "very much up in the air" and will depend on the outcome of the discussion of Catholic character and academic freedom at Notre Dame. 
Laina said he took an organizing role for the event because he wanted students at the University to have the opportunity 
to see quality films and hopes it continues in the future. 
"It is important that if stu­dents and alumni feel that this event is important ... [it is] valuable that they express those views to the president," Laina said.

Skating sweethearts skip celebrating love 
Associated Press 
TUHIN, Italy -Apolo Anton Ohno and his girlfriend, Allison Baver, both happened to have their short-track races sched­ulod for tho day after Valnnlirw's Day. 
Sorry. Allison. 

Amnriea's speedskaling sweethearts have an agree­nwnt: Tlwre'll be no celebrating tlwir two years together at the Olympies on Feb. 14. 
"I don't know. (;iris like Valentine's Day, so that was kind of tough, but, like -we race llw next day, so ... " she said Tuosday, hor voiee trailing on· wistfully. 
''I'd like it," she added, "lweat~s~;. Italy, you know ­romantrc. 
Ohno, who made a sensation­al dobut at the Salt Lake City Olympies in 2002 by winning a gold and ll silver in the rough­and-tum bin sport, has bnen foeusml intensely on training, living in a spare apartment at the national Olympic center in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
And ko1~ping distractions at a minimum. 
"Compntitions, our pn~para­tion, our limo and our focus are much difToront than most peo­ple," he said. 
"Dating is hard" for an ath­lete, he said. "It's very hard." 
Asked at a crowded news eonfflrence what he has been doing since arriving in Turin, Ohno's answer was as span~ as his lifestyle when preparing to compete. 
"My activities have been going to the ice rink, eating, slooping. training. and this is pretty much tho only thing out of the ordinary," he said. "We'vo been trying to keep it pretty simple every day." 
Later, answering questions from smaller knots of reporters, Baver alluded to Ohno's Spartan reply. 
"It's part of his personality. 'I'm eating,' that's it," she said. "lie's not concerned about any­thing else except training, com­poling." 
There was one revealing moment by Ohno near the end of the news conference. As he walked offstage, he slowed as he passed behind Baver, who was still answering quostions, and touched her gently on the head. 
Baver. 25, will compete in the 500, the I,500 and the 3,000 relay. Ohno, 23, will compete in the 500, the 1,000, the 1,500 and the 5,000 relay. 
Ohno, who was wearing a trademark blue bandanna, even said he was "not sure" if he would march with the U.S. team at the opening ceremony on Friday, two days before tho 1,500 final. That would certain­ly be a hugo disappointment to fans of the skater who has almost rock star status. 
"Tho whole opening cere­monies process for athletes is vory long. It's like eight hours long -a lot of standing a lot of walking, a lot of waiting," he said. 
"If I feel like I may get sick or I may get too tired, then I'll probably sit back,'' he said. "I would love to participate, for sure." 
Ohno said he intensified his training because some athletes see their results "go downhill" after winning a medal. 



Day ignites mixed emotions 
Authors lament, explain the many negative aspects of the holiday 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Last Feb. 14, Liz Tuccillo called directory assistance to get a phone number for a store. Big mis­take. 
A message greeted her: "Happy Valentine's Day." It was the last thing Tuccillo ­43, single and the eo-author of "He's Just Not That Into You"-wanted to hear. 
"It is a painful holiday," says Tuccillo, whose humor­ous 2004 best seller coun­soled women in dead-end relationships. ''I'm looking up tho phone number of a store, and I have to be reminded that I'm single!" 
Lots of people hate Valentine's Day. Many are sin­gle. But oven people in com­mitted relationships can have a rotten time. 
For some, it's because their partner, out of carelessness, forgetfulness or something worse, doesn't come through with that romantic gift or thoughtfully planned date. Others might be going through a difficult momnnt in their relationship. Valentine's Day is like a huge magnifying glass hovering over all those warts and pimples. 
"Basically, no matter who you are, Valentine's Day will give you something to be stressed about," says 25-year­old receptionist Bennett Madison. It's kind of like the stress at Christmas, he explains, but worse: "It's got that added layer of romance. Just one more thing to make you feel inadequate." 
Madison has spent a lot of time thinking about this. In fact, he's written a book, too. woman Hoehelle Adams. Tho It's called "I IIate Valentine's boginning of tho ynar is Day." already busy with singles

Unless you've been cooped up in your basement for the last few weeks engaged in an epic Dungeons & Dragons campaign, you no doubt know that the Winter Olympics have reared their frost-bitten and frozen soot­encrusted heads this week. The Olympics offer a great oppor­tunity for all the nations of the world to come together, forget their political headaches and remember how America is better than them in a vari­ety of athletic events. 
This year's games are being held in Torino, Italy, and those Italians started the festivities off with a banging opening ceremony on Friday. Opening ceremonies in recent Olympics have proven unsatisfying, as if lacking a certain something. Well, the Italians have figured out what that "something" is: flaming rollerbladers. Yes, you know your Olympic opening ceremony is off to a good start when a legion of blazing extreme athletes is an integral component. 
The ceremony also includes the tradi­tional parade of all the countries' ath­letes. It is a great time to drink in the spectacle and pageantry of these games. I would be lying if I told you I didn't get a little misty when Liechtenstein walked out to the tune of "Funkytown." This is what sport is all about. The American Olympic Team made their appearance sporting some berets that can only be described as "jaunty." 
Per usual, there are a few select ath­letes that the media latches onto like

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
some sort of latching device, and they become the poster boys and girls for the U.S. Olympic Effort. This year's notables include Bode Miller, Apollo Anton Ohno and Michelle Kwan's groin. Kwan, who backed into the games despite not qualifying, will not compete due to a nagging groin injury. No doubt countless American hearts are broken by this sad news, as Kwan will never be able to win that elusive gold medal. Furthermore, all those hearts will be female, as the men of America will be preoccupied with activities such as scratching, burping and not watching figure skating. 
Bode Miller has put a bad boy edge on these Olympics, as he has recently been embroiled in controversy stem­ming from talking about skiing while drunk. When asked to elaborate on that 60 Minutes interview, Miller said, "Raflghbk," and then vomited all over his skin-tight neon blue Spandex jump­suit. 
Of course, due to the immense nature of the Olympics, there is a lot to take in -almost too much in fact. There is round-the-clock coverage on NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, XYZNBC and NBCNBC, so it's easy to get overwhelmed. But do not worry, stop crying. You have just got to narrow down the field and only watch your favorites. It will be OK; we will get through this together. 
Maybe you are into the more graceful sports, in which case you might want to check out ice dancing. I am not exactly sure how that differs from figure skat­ing, but I am hoping that the key differ­ence is that crosschecking is allowed. Of course, I am probably wrong, and the difference is just more sequins. 
Or perhaps you like to take your cof­fee with two creams and danger. If you like living on the edge, you will want to see freestyle skiing. It is like regular moguls skiing, but it has been XTREME-icized by adding 360 degree jumps and flips throughout the course. It's the love child of Picabo Street and Tony Hawk, the XTHEME love child. 

What event am I looking forward to the most, you ask? Short track speed­skating. That is right, not long track, but short track speedskating. Apollo Anton Ohno's specialty, this is the event where four to six skaters compete by racing in circles around a track rough­ly the size of a half dollar. It's great because with so many skaters and so little room, there are plenty of opportu­nities for some good old fashioned bumping and pushing. It is like Holler Derby on ice. Many times races end in one giant folderol (thanks, English major!) when one skater falls, thereby taking out several members of the field in one swoop. This is why I like speed­skating; it teaches you valuable life les­sons. In the 1,500 meter Race of Life, sometimes you are gliding along, you can see the finish line racing towards you, and all of a sudden, some guy from South Korea comes out of nowhere and blindsides you. That's life. 
No matter what you choose to take in during this two week extravaganza of Spandex and chapped lips, be sure to remember the spirit behind the Games. These amateur athletes compete sim­ply for the purity of the sport. There are no entourages, agents or shoe deals at the Winter Olympics, just some guys heaving rocks and rubbing brooms at them.

Freedom to choose? 
As the debate about Catholic charac­ter and identity continues on this cam­pus, I think that it is important to raise certain questions. 
The first point I have is the move­ment of "The Vagina Monologues" from a legitimate perfomance space to a lec­ture hall, limiting its capacity to serve as a philanthropic gesture. 
I ask the University to consider what messages are really being sent to stu­dents. Is this not a more pernicious kind of censorship, the relegation of "immoral" or "on-Catholic" events to a second or even third-class status on campus? Does it also resemble the tac­tics the Bush administration currently employs with protests, barring them from view of the greater public? If the answers to the above questions are yes, then the overall conclusion is academic freedom is in peril at Notre Dame. 
Now the obvious retort to the above response would be that Notre Dame, as a private, Catholic university, has a right to pick and choose which view­points it allows on campus. That would

be fine and good if Notre Dame did not also receive federal money in the form of ROTC scholarships, student financial aid loans and other grants. 
The use of federal money by private universities raises a serious question: if you are in some part being funded by taxpayer money, how independent or separate from the "secular" can you claim yourself to be? If all of the money for my tuition, books and living expens­es came expressly from the University itself, I would be more inclined to capitulate to University President Father John Jenkins' position. However, it doesn't, and the same is the case for a significant number of stu­dents. 
In fact, one of the largest scholarship programs on this campus is ROTC. ROTC is a program that trains students to be military officers and ultimately, when the time comes, to participate in war. In the case of the Navy and other ROTC programs on campus, we have the University's tacit endorsement of war and its agents, even though our

military is currently in the midst of a war that Catholic officials have deemed unjust. Given these facts, it seems to me that more issues of academic free­dom and morality on this campus are to be determined by money than they are by "Catholic character." 
Lastly, I'd like to point out that the University theatre shows many films which are out of keeping with Catholic character, including "The 40-Year-Old­Virgin," a film that endorses, among other things, premarital sex and scato­logical sex acts. While I liked the film, I can't help but notice the double stan­dard it calls attention to: it's okay for discussions of male sexuality, even the need for men to have sex before mar­riage, but God forbid that women be given the same chance to do so. For those of you that shudder at the word "vagina," have no fear. The inquisition is already here.

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Jenkins' thinking in line with Catholic teaching 
As an alumnus of Our Lady's Univorsity, formor Sports Editor of The Obs~rver, and a Homan Catholic hus­band and father of three daughtors, I am writing in rnsponsn to Fathnr John Jenkins' invitation for comments on his addressns concerning Acadnmic Frn~dom and Catholic Character. 
I am pleased by and gratnful for the position that Jenkins has taken regard­ing the Quncr Film Festival and "The Vagina Monologues." Neither of these events have any place at the University of Notre Dame or at any other Catholic educational institution. lndoed, I corre­spondnd with the previous administra­tion to nxpress this same view. 
The reason that such evnnts do not lwlong at Notre Damn is simple: those events aro contrary to tho fundamental reality that is tho basis of our Catholic faith. namely. the truth about human sexuality. · 
As ably explained in 2004 by Bishop ll'Arcy, "The Vagina Monologues" is "oll'l~nsivo to women; it is antithetical to Catholic tf'aehing on the lwautiful gift of human sexuality and also to tho tnach­ings of tlw church on tlw human body n~lalive to its purpose and to its status as a lfnnpln of the lloly Spirit. Tho human body and tho human pPrson, in the tra­dition of ttw church. must never be seen as an ohjnct." 
Concerning tlw Qtwnr Film Fnstival, it 1:annot bn ignored that thn past prnsnn­tt~rs havn indudnd dissident Catholics such as Sister Jean nino (;ramkk and Fatlwr Holmrt NugPnt, who worn per­sonally orderod by Pope .John Paul II to havn no pastoral contact wilh homosex­ual pPrsons because sw:h dissidonts 
wero promulgating "errors and ambigui­ties" concerning human sexuality. 
In that regard, as explained in the Catnchism of the Catholic Church (para. 2357): "Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as aets of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.' They arn contrary to the natural law. They closn the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine atl'eetivc and sexual complimcntarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.'' 
Indeed, the Catechism refers to homo­sexual acts as "sins that cry to heaven," together with murder, the oppression of th~ poor, widows or orphans and injus­tice to the wage earner (Catechism, para. 1S67). 
In mnsidering such statements, it. must be rnmembnr<HI that the Church teaches infallibly on matters of faith and morals. Beyond any dispute, the Church,s teach­ing on homosexual activity is a teaching about moral behavior, and hence infalli­bln. 
It is precisely the fundamental moral truths about homosexuality, which are, at best. obscured by the Queer Film Festival and "The Vagina Monologues." At worst, allowing such events to be held at thn University is to coopcrato in the eommission of sin. It is to "give risn to social situations and institutions that arn eontrary to the divine goodness," and to create the "structures of sin." At worse, it is a "social sin," which may lead por­sons to do evil (Catnehism, para. 1 S6S­1869). 
Indeed, the Chureh teaches that one cooperates in sins committed by others when we praise or approve their aets. or when we do not hinder them when we have an obligation to do so (Catechism, para. 1868). The presence of these events on the campus of Notre Dame obliges us as people of faith to oppose them. 
I am aware of the counterargument to this position, namely that the suspension of university support for thesn events violates the principles of academic free­dom, and I lind it completely without merit. 
Institutions of higher learning must indeed foster intellectual inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge, actions that nour­ish in a collaborative environment that supports the open exchange of ideas. In that regard, I must add that following my graduation from Notre Dame, I have earned both a Master's in Philosophy (University of Illinois, Urbana­Champaign, 19941 and a law degree (Case Western, 2000) and have complet­nd my coursework toward a Doctorate in Philosophy (Catholic University of America). I have taught numerous phi­losophy coursns as an adjunct profnssor, and I have a robust appreciation for aca­demic freedom, properly understood. 
In the contexts of classroom study and pnrsonal research, no scholar or student should be restricted, save by the bound­aries of his or her respnetive mind and inclination and aeademic discipline. I Iowever, the ultimate object of study is the understanding of the truth. A path of study that has been shown to be !'also docs not merit further pursuit. In this vein, neither the Queer Film Festival nor "The Vagina Monologues" meet these 

'Vagina Monologues' revisited 

I rm:nntly trind to nxplain to my 30­
ynar-old daughtnr about the hoopla at 
Notrn Damn owr "Thn Vagina 
Monologw~s.'' llPr response was. "It's so 
'SOs!" 
I thought about this for a whiln in light of the past wenks' twnnts and tri~d to inHt!{inn thn rnaction of the thrm~ out­standing lmtdt~rs of the women's move­nwnt who clind rncnntly. Thn struggles of Contta Scott King (advocate for human and c:ivil rights). Wtmdy Wasserman (playwright and linninistl and Bntty Fri~dan (the mother of the womon's movnrnent) for equality had such a vital inllucncn on all of our livns today. These pionnnriug womnn would probably have rmu:tnd to the eurrent discussion in the same way as my daughtnr. 
Women today take for granted the eoneessions that these heroic women fought for during the '60s and '70s: equal pay. nqual rights, child wclfarn. ndueation and entry into the men's world of business, medicine and the mil­itary. Most of all. they wanted women to havn ehoiees: choices about their bodies, their lives and their families. 
But although we have "come a long way, baby," why are we still questioning if we aro moving forward or going in reverse? Should we stand eontentcdly by and bneome passive, or should we continue to fight for our equal place at thn table as our role rnodnls bnli>re us did? 
Let's not be smug. A reality eheck would indieate the following: a male's median wage in a profnssional full time jobs is $5X,SOO; a woman's is $40,29S. Mon in full time serviee jobs earn $26,000 while women earn $19,000. As of 2004, Indiana ranked 2S in all states with people living below tho poverty linn, and 11.8 percent of those are womnn. Although women have made gains in wages, they arn still working longer hours for that gain. Disparity in wages among women dill'ers according to race, agn and education. Women will not rnceive parity in wages until 2050! 
These sobnring statistics are also a Inns li>r discussing the current contro­versy about acadomic freedom and the Catholic character of the University. Is tlw rnligious framework of our campus rPquirnd to turn a blind eye to the eco­nomic consequnnces of our decision about "The Vagina Monologues?" The elimination of a fundraising component means that the local non-protit organi­zations YWCA and SOS lose a signiticant amount of money. Why would the uni­versity object to an organization that provides services that embody the Catholic social teaching it is trying to impart to its students? 
At the YWCA, one sees the lessons of Catholic ideals in the smiling faces of the children who finally feel secure from abusive or addictive homes. They eat three meals a day, attend school regu­larly and have a quiet, safe shelter from the experiences they have had to cneounter so early in their lives. The Y provides a safety net so that these chil­dren might have a better chance in life. 
You see hope refieetcd in the eyes of the women who have sought refuge from angry, violent men and the sanctity of marriage. These women have taken the very courageous. difficult step out of relationships that are dangerous and harmful to their childron. They have turned away from addictive drugs and alcohol and are learning to walk forward on their own. These women arn learning new skills and new ways of living and being with their families and finding ways of increasing their self­esteem. In the process, they are finding some empowerment in their own lives. 
Coretta, Wendy and Betty would be applauding what the YWCA is doing for these women and children, 
and so should Notre Dame. They would nncourage us to support their efl'orts to empower women. They would also lind 
it ironic that our campus discourse is 
narrowed to a discussimi of women's "plumbing" after almost 50 years of their fight for the whole woman's oqual 
placo in the world. Is the question of sponsorship really an effort to control 
resources about and for women? 
Haven't we oarned the right to be able to talk openly and explore ideas within 
the contines of the university setting? 
At this university, we should be dis­cussing and focusing on the social and economic (in)justice issues that concern all of us: poverty. hunger, school nutri­tion, healthcare and available higher education and job training. We should not punish the women and children at the YWCA and the people who use the services at the SOS by depriving them of funding because of our fervor about whether or not "The Vagina Monologues" should be performed as part of the intellectual debate on cam­pus. Is that refleetive of the social teach­ings and values we want this community -faculty, staff and students -to embody? 
It's so '80s. Let's get over it!

criteria. Those evnnts do not take placn in the contoxt of classroom study or nvnn in an open exchange, as they present a one-sidod view of human beings. Furthermore, as demonstratod above, the view that they present is fundamen­tally 11awed; it stands in opposition to the truth. 
This issue is not a matter of censor­ship. Persons arc free to meet and to dis­cuss the issues raised in thn Queer Film Festival and "The Vagina Monologues." They arn frnc to. use their own private property to show such films or dramatie performances. Ilowever, as a Catholic institution, Notre Dame is obligatnd to uphold the truths of thn Church and the faith. It eannot condone tho pcrformanee of these events in its faeilities or on its property. 
Likewise, it is absurd to suggest that such events might bn t:ondorwd bncaus11 thny raise money for charity. As the Church unambiguously teaches, an evil means eannot be pursued to ad1ieve a good end. 
In closing, the Queer Film Fnstival and "The Vagina Monologuns" have no place at the University of Notre Dame or at any other Catholic educational institu­tion. They do not merit the sponsorship of Our Lady's University. 
And I am very, very glad to see that Jenkins is dealing with these issues in an entimly proper pastoral and administra­tive way in the light of faith and sound philosophy.

Keenan Revue offensive 
Arter hearing a lot of extrmnely posi­tive buzz, I was excitnd to attend last Friday's Keenan Hevue. llowevor, I was appalled when I saw "Global Guts: Speeial Olympics Edition" listml as one of the aets in the program. The act mocked disabled individuals, going as far as to rofer to them at "tards.'' I real­ize the show is meant to be light-heart­ed and should not be taken seriously, but making fun of the handicapped is not at all funny under any eireum­stance. It is simply a display of incredi­bly poor taste. It is a travesty that this 
 University, which will not sponsor "The Vagina Monologues" or the Queer Film Festival, has no problem endorsing this kind of cruel humor. I am disgusted with those who wrote this act, horrified that the rector of Keenan IIall allowed it to be performed and truly saddened that there are students at Notre Dame who are ignorant or insensitive enough to find this funny. I sincerely hope Keenan Hall uses a little more tact when putting together next year's Hevue, but I detinitely will not be attending.

Kick off your Sunday shoes 
PEMCo changes direction; performs upbeat, entertaining version of 'Footloose' 


Ren (Will McAuliffe), left, moves from Chicago to the small town of Bomont, where a dancing is banned. He explains his love of dancing to his classmates. 

The Bomont youth decide to rebel against the ban on dancing In "Footloose." The show is the ninth musical performed on campus by PEMCo since 1997. 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 

It's a song, it's a movie, it's a ... musi­cal? 
The Pasquerilla East Musical Company (PEMCo.) performed "Footloose" on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night at Washington Hall. Based on the 1980s film starring Kevin Bacon, the musical entertained the crowd with strong performances and an upbeat sensibility. 
"Footloose" tells the story of Ren McCormack (Will McAuliffe), a Chicago native who is forced to move to the small town of Boman with his mother Ethel (Kathleen Sullivan) after his father leaves. Under the influence of the strict Reverend Shaw Moore (Joseph Garlock), the town has a num­ber of strict rules in place, including a ban on dancing within the city limits. Hen, along with the Reverend's rebel­lious daughter Ariel (Callie Hoffman) and the rest of his classmates, fights the rules to prove he is more than just the town troublemaker. 
"I wanted to do something really upbeat, funny and with lots of danc­ing," director Jenny Radelet said. "I was also drawn to the fact that it's fair­ly modern and has all those great songs from the '80s. Plus we thought since 'Footloose' was a pretty popular movie, the name would draw a big audience." · 
In an interesting twist on standard musicals, "Footloose" blends pop songs from the 1980s with original music. While the original compositions aren't as immediately recognizable as songs from more famous musicals, all of the songs are decently entertaining, Some, such as the rollicking "Mama Says (You Can't Back Down)" and ''I'm Free/Heaven Help Me" are better than others, but all of the songs are peppy and upbeat, much like the musical itself. 
The musical includes '80s pop songs including "Almost Paradise," "Let's Hear It For the Boy" and "Holding Out for a Hero." The musical does a good job of integrating the songs without feeling too forced. While these songs do make the musical a definite sing-along crowd-pleaser, they can make it seem a little bit cheesy and can be distracting at times because they are so recogniza­ble and the original songs are not. 
One of the best parts of "Footloose," much like the movie upon which it is based, is the dancing. 
"For a choreographer, 'Footloose' is a dream show," said senior Natalie Martinez, the show's choreographer. The show includes everything from Temptations-style diva numbers to country line dancing." 
Coupled with the generally upbeat music, the dance numbers were high­energy, athletic events. They ranged from the expected "Footloose" style of dancing to a great line dancing scene, and even included a dance set during gym class. 
The performers pulled off the clearly intense routines with apparent ease, and they were all well-choreographed in spite of the diverse range of styles. 
The dancing seemed different from what you get in most musicals, which was one of the definite strengths of the performance. 
"The music of Footloose doesn't lend itself to your typical musical theatre choreography," Martinez said. "It's the type of music you blare on the radio or dance to at a party. As the choreogra­pher, my goal was to keep the dancing spontaneous and fun while at the same time challenging and impressive." 
PEMCo's cast was definitely the most impressive part of the performance of "Footloose." The energy of the cast proved absolutely infectious, and every scene was clearly the result of a lot of practice and a deep love of performing. 
While the whole cast truly does a great job, there were some significant standouts in the performance. Will McAuliffe, as Ren, was a solid leading man with great dancing and singing 

skills, and he was complimented by Callie Hoffman's powerful voice and presence as Ariel. 
Joseph Garlock, who played the antagonistic Heverend Moore, was not only a convincing adult, but he brought emotional depth to the otherwise sim­ple story. 
Ariel's trio of friends, including Husty (Regan Harding). Urleen (Andrea Laidman) and Wendy Jo (Pam Williams), were terrific performers and provided some of the best comic moments in the musical. 
Jack Calcutt played the hilarious over-the-top country character of Willard Hewitt and provided some of the night's biggest laughs. 
"There's a moment during the first refrain of "Let's Hear It For the Boy" when Jack gets this goofy, amazing smile on his face after feeling the rhythm for the first time," Radelet said. "Every single time it happens, I die laughing and just thank God for musi­cal theatre." 
Overall, PEMCo. put on a fantastic show with what is an entertaining, albeit somewhat cheesy, musical. The energy of the show, the great singing and dancing and the exuberance of the cast made it a performance worth watching.

Despite Violeta's wish to havn a gay son, Pedro makes it abun­dantly clear to his gay friends that he does not want Bernardo being inrlu­lmeed into maintaining a homosexual lif'ostyle.

WINTER OLYMPICS 


Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Faced with the loss of its biggest Winter Olympics star only two days into the Turin Games, NBC tried to keep Michelle Kwan -in the broadcast booth. 
Kwan turned down the job offer, saying she didn't want to be a distraction for remaining members of the U.S. Olympic figure skating team, NBC Sports spokesman Michael McCarley said Sunday. 
The star withdrew from the Olympics on Sunday because of a strained groin muscle, ending her quest for her first gold medal in what was expected to be one of the most compelling stories in Turin. 
NBC Sports had first contacted Kwan's agent in January, when it had appeared unlikely that she would be competing, McCarley said. NBC Universal Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol made Sunday's offer only an hour after her news conference, when she had come to NBC's studios to be interviewed by Bob Costas. 
Women's figure skating traditionally is the most-

Roddick sends U.S. into 
Davis Cup quarterfinals 
SAN DIEGO -Andy Hoddick beat Homania's Hazvan Sabau in straight sets Sunday to send the United States into the Davis Cup quarterfi­nals. 
The victory gave the Americans an insurmountable 3-1 lead in the best-of-five opening round, then James Blake made the !'ina I 4-1 with his closing singles victory. 
Blake and the doubles team of Mike and Bob Bryan provided the first two U.S. victories, then Blake capped the round with a 6-1, 7-5 win over Horia Tecau in what essentially was an exhibition match shortened to two sets. 
The United States advanced to play Chile, which beat Slovakia in the first round. 
Hoddick, who lost a big early lead and the match after becoming nau­seated in Friday's opening singles against Andrei Pavel, defeated Sabau 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. 

watched Winter Olympics event, and Kwan is its biggest star. More women than men usually watch the Winter Games, and that's due largely to fig­ure skating. 
"It's like a lead actor leaving a series," said Marc Berman, television analyst for Media Week Online. "It's not positive." 
NBC broke into its overnight rebroadcast of its prime-time coverage at 4:20a.m. EST to report Kwan's withdrawal. 
"She's probably the most significant athlete at these Olympic Games," said skating analyst Scott 
.. 
-... 
Hamilton. "And so for her to pull out is a gigantic story, and a loss for the 
U.S. team because so 
much of the focus  was  
going to be on her."  
Even  if  Kwan  had  

stayed, national champion Sasha Cohen was likely to be the U.S. team's best hope for a gold medal in f'igure skating, McCarley said. Viewers tune in because of the Olympic experience, not necessari­ly becausn of athlntns they knew beforehand. 
"Stars nmerge during the games themselves not before," McCarley said. 
Oberholser wins Pebble 
Beach National Pro-Am 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -Arron Oberholser was shaky down the stretch Sunday until a big break turned into an unlikely birdie, allow­ing him to coast the final three holes Sunday and win the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
Oberholser enjoyed a proud, peace­ful walk up the 18th fairway on his way to an even-par 72 and a five-shot victory, matching the largest margin in the 77 -year history of the tourna­ment. Sweeter still was capturing his first PGA Tour event on a course he has played countless times since he was a kid. 
The 31-year-old Oberholser grew up in San Mateo and played college golf at San Jose State, and there were cheers of "Go Spartans" throughout a final round of warmth and sunshine on the Monterey Peninsula. 
Oberholser finished at 17-under 271, five shots ahead of' Hory Sabbatini.

Ohno wasn't around to do anything about it. falling out af'ter almost falling down in the semifinals. 
"I put a lot of dedication and timn into this sport. To not even make that linal and be able to ehallnngn thosn top skaters, it hurts," hn said. 
Ohno stumbled with 1 1/2 laps to go in his smnifinal heat and wound up last across the line among those still skating, hunched over with his hands on his knnes. Ills split-second mis­take ruin~d any chance of dnl'ending his Olympic title in a much-anticipated showdown against Aim and Leo. 
"I was a bit disappointed I couldn't race against Ohno," Ahn said. "But thern are lots of other talented athletes and I did what I had to do." 
China's l.i Jia.Jun won the bronzn. 
"It really brnaks my heart to watch that," said Allison Baver, Ohno's tnammate and girl­friend. "I know he's the best skater in the world and he real­ly didn't have a chance to show that. But the Olympics aren't over." 
Indeed, Ohno still has three events left to match or beat the gold and silver medals he won in Salt Lake City. As they say in this wacky sport, "That's short track." 
Consider what happened in 2002: Ohno crossed the line second in the 1,500 final but won gold when another Korean skater, Kim Dong-sung, was dis­qualified f'or blocking the Amnriean on the last lap. The ruling thrillfld U.S. fans but out­raged South Koreans.

"I wasn't sure how close the 
guys were behind me, so I 
decided to just pick up the 
speed a little bit," Ohno said. 
"We had a little bit of contact 
that caused me to get too far

Ohno stuck down his left hand 
in an attempt to stay up, send­

23-year-old American never

on the turn while the rest of' the 
six-man field went on by. 
Even though one of his com­

With Ohno out of the way, Ahil

of the night. 
"It is a shame," Alm said. "All the Koreans were obviously expecting a raee between myself and Ohno. So in that sense I'm disappointed for the Koreans."

Irish upset North Carolina, edge Wake Forest 
Thompson twins fall in doubles but rest ofsquad pummels No. 10 Tar Heels to earn victory in Chapel Hill 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Wrirer 
The Irish improved to 4-0 on the season with wins over No. 10 North Carolina and No. 23 Wake Forest over the week­end. 
Sunday's 5-1 upset over the Tar Heels was proof the Irish can compete with the nation's top programs. The victory marks the first time Notre Dame has defeated a top-10 ranked program since the 2001-02 season against No. 7 usc. 
The Irish got off to a strong start against North Carolina as they tiJOk the doubles point with wins at the Nos. 2 and 3 positions. 
At No. 2. the pairing of soph­omore Brook Buck and fresh­man Kelcy Tefft topped Caitlin Collins and Tanja Markovic in a comeback. At No. 3, the duo of seniors Kiki Stastny and team captain Lauren Connelly secured the victory after defeating the No. 50 ranked 
squad  of Meg Fanjoy  and  
Austin Smith 8-6.  
Juniors  Christian  and  

Catrina Thompson suffered the lone doubles loss, as the nation's No. 1 pair fell 8-3 to Sara Anundersen and Jenna Long. 
First off the courts in singles was freshman Katie Potts after topping the Tar Heels' Charlotte Tansill 6-2, 6-0 at No. 6, giving Potts her eighth consecutive win this season and fourth straight victory in dual matches. 
Catrina Thompson, ranked No. 24 nationally, defeated No. 28 Long 7-5, 6-4. Thompson now holds a 13-6 record on the season, including seven wins against nationally-

No. 22 Notre Dame 4 No. 23 Wake Forest 3 
During Saturday's 4-3 win over the Demon Deacons, Notre Dame's fate depended on a dutch win from Potts at No.6. 
After posting a S-2 advan­tage in the deciding third set, Potts failed to hold serve on her first attempt to close out the match against the Deacon's Sierra Poske. Poske then held serve to bring the contest to S-3, only to fall short in breaking Potts next attempt to serve out the match by finishing 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-4. 

The Irish accounted for the other three points from the coveted doubles point and two wins in singles from No. 4 Tefft and No. 5 Stastny. 
In doubles, Notre Dame swept all three matches. 
The No. 1 ranked Thompson sisters sparked the team's momentum as they defeated Ashlee Davis and Alexandra Hirsch 8-1 at No. 1. They were followed by a win from Buek and Tefft at No. 2. The Irish underclassmen defeated the Demon's Ana Jerman and Christian Tara 8-3. 
The win not only secured the point for Notre Dame and gave the pairing its sixth consecu­tive win, it was also Buck's 40th career doubles victory. Completing the sweep in dou­bles were Stastny _and Connelly, who defeated Sierra Poske and Christine Simpson 8-6 at No. 3. 
In singles, Stastny walked off the court first with a 6-0, 6-2 win over Jenna Loeb at No.5. 
Tefft's 6-3, 6-4 victory over Tara at No. 4 gave the Irish a 3-0 lead in the match. 
However, critical losses from Catrina Thompson, Christian Thompson and Buck at Nos. 1, 2 and 3 gave the Demons a possibility for a surprise comeback. 
In the final match, Potts answered Wake Forest's rally with her victory over Poske, pulling out the win for Notre Dame.

playoffs. 
''I'm really happy that we won the game, and I'm happy for our crowd because we've had some good crowds in here on Friday nights and we've disappointed them in the past," Irish head coach Jeff Jackson said of the series' Friday home game. 
The Irish started strong Friday and opened up a 2-0 lead by the beginning of the second period, but Ferris State cut the lead to one with a late­period goal at 14:27. Notre Dame hung on to end the stan­za with the lead, but an Irish bench minor for too many men on the ice at 1:50 of the third gave the Bulldogs a power play. 
Ferris State controlled the puck in the Irish zone and worked the puck to the left post, where Irish goalie Dave Brown made the initial save. While Brown was sprawled against the post, the rebound came to Bulldogs sniper Greg Rallo on the right side of the crease with a wide-open net. Rallo shot the puck low into the net when Brown -still on his back -shot his glove out across the goal and snagged the would-be tying score out of Ferris State's hands. 
"They were pressuring us pretty hard," Brown said. "It was good to get the big save and try to help the guys with the momentum a little bit. "[My teammates! are going hard at the other end, and I wanted to do my part to give them the confidence that I'm back there for them." 
Brown made 26 saves and only allowed the lone goal of the game on a screen shot from defenseman Adam Welch at the point on a Bulldogs power play. The shot broke through a tangle of players in front of the net and was buried over Brown's right shoulder. 
"Without great goaltending, you can't do anything," Jackson said. "David has been outstanding since Christmas, and he was pretty good before Christmas. He's been the dif­ference maker for us. When you get a save like that, it ral­lies your team and it's gener­ally a momentum changer." 
three minutes later, defense­man Wes O'Neill added a game breaker. At 6:00 of the third period, O'Neill stepped up and unleashed a shot from the high left slot that deflected off a stick and hit the twine just under the crossbar. 
Left wing Mike Walsh fin­ished off the Bulldogs with a lucky bounce and a great move one minute later. Walsh collected a breakout pass that deflected off the linesman's skates in the neutral zone. Walsh split the two Bulldogs defensemen and slipped the puck between the post and pad on the low right side for the 4-1 lead at 7:17. 
"[Walsh] plays the same way all the time -he plays physi­cal, he plays big, he can skate well," Jackson said. "He has good skating skills, and I was glad to see him bust through like that. That's a big time goal; a professional type goal." 
It was not the lone goal for Walsh on the game, as he had already lit the lamp early in the second to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. Right wing T.J. .Jindra and Walsh advanced into the Bulldogs zone on a two-on-one. Jindra cut to the center and dished a backhand to Walsh on the right side. Jindra fought through the defense to set up a screen, and Walsh sent a wrister in on the low right side at 4:33. 
Erik Condra got the Irish on the board first at 12:48 of the opening period on a power play goal. Notre Dame worked the puck up high around Ferris State's zone until Mark Van Guilder dished off to Condra. Condra stepped in and shot from above the circle to put the puck in the top right corner. 
"To get on the board early with' a power play was really crucial for the entire team's confidence," Walsh said of Condra's goal. "Once we had that, everyone was like 'All right, we're going to win."' 
Notre Dame continued its dominance over its ranked opponent on Saturday night with a power play-laden 3-2 victory. 
The Irish once again got to an early 2-0 lead, with an emphasis on "early." 
Jason Paige scored 46 sec­onds into the game off a rebound from a Walsh shot. 


Paige roofed the puck over Bulldogs goalie Mitch O'Keefe's shoulder. 
Josh Sciba then added to his Irish goal lead with his 14th of the year when he created the two-goal lead at 16:02 of the same period. Sciba scored off a dish from Condra. 
Ferris State tied the game in the second with two power play goals at 12:23 and 16:21. 

The goals came from Mark 
Bomersback and Eric Vesely. 
But Van Guilder secured the game winner on an Irish power play with only seconds remaining in the period. Van Guilder collected a pass from Condra in the middle and slipped the winner past O'Keefe for the 3-2 win at

Early on in the mateh, the Irish were tied with the Cardinal at 3­3, but freshman foilist Mark Kubik's 5-3 win over Hichard Fulton ignited a live-bout win­ning streak that gave Notre Dame a eomfortable margin it would not relinquish the rest of the mateh. The run included a big win by junior sabrn Patrick Ghattas over freshman Teddy Levitt. (;hattas' 12-0 perform­ance at the UCSD dunls pushed his record to 51-5 for the year. 
In the women's match, the Irish and Cardinal were also tied at 3-:~ before an 8-bout winning streak put Notre Dame alwad for good. The run ended when Stanford's Eva Jellinson defeated Irish sophomore Mariel Zagunis 5-l in their sabm bout. 
Zagunis, last season's national runner-up and a 2004 Olympic gold medalist, lost just her sec­ond bout of the season. She lin­islws the regular season with a 46-2 record, and her .952 win­ning percentage is the best all­time record for a Notre Dame women's sabre. 
"She was maybe a little bit sltwpy, and sometimes with bouting sabre, it is like Hussian roulnttn, when you wake up it is too late," Bednarski said. "It's likn winning in tennis 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0; if you are losing one set sometimes, you an~ still champi­on." 
Tho Irish women's team also toppml Army 21-6, Cal Tech 26­1, UC San Dingo 18-Y, Cal State­Fullerton 22-5, and Air Force 22-5. Junior sabre Valerie Providenza led the women's effort with a perfect 15-0 record at the event and improving her record to 54-8 on the season, the third most wins in Notre Dame history by a female sabre. 
"She fenced very strongly. For a long time, I will say that I did not see her in such a good form," Bednarski said. "She had great speed, great concentration, and it was a big step forward." 
The men's undefeated day included wins over all the same squads, as the Irish defeated Cal State-Fullerton 22-5, UC San Diego 20-7, Cal Tech 25-2, Army 22-5 and Air Force 18-9. 
The victory over Air Force included sophomore epee cap­tain Greg Howard's 5-4 victory over All-American Tim French. The win was the highlight of Howard's 9-3 day, and he finish­es his season with a 44-9 mark. 
"It was very well seen that the kids worked hard, were very well prepared," Bndnarski said. 
But he hesitated to put much emphasis on the win. 
"It doesn't say a lot about our future," he said. "We will say that we were very well pre­pared, but our rivals are pretty strong and will try not to be beat again." 
The Notre Dame men's 29 wins tin a school record set in 1996, and the team's overall sea­son bout reeord of 630-180 shat­ters is a Notre Dame high for wins, eclipsing the '96 team's 606. 
The women's team's marks of 29 wins and 660 bout wins are both tied for fourth best in pro­gram history.

"We need to improve our defense," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "Our rebound­ing has been a problem all year long. We had the same problems we've had all year. We've just got to keep working to fix them." 
DePaul guard Allie Quigley and forward Khara Smith led the Blue Demons past the Irish with precise shooting and forceful rebounding. Quigley, who led the nation in three­point percentage as a fresh­man last year, connected on 4­of-5 from behind the arc and 8-of-12 overall en route to a 26-point performance. Smith dominated the post, scoring 12 points and adding 19 rebounds. The 19 rebounds, which tie for the most ever against the Irish, are the high­est total by a Notre Dame opponent since Wendy Scholtens of Vanderbilt hit the mark on Jan. 8, 1989 in an 84­64 Commodores victory.

Sweep smell of success 

Irish take two games from Ferris State to get back in the hunt for home ice in the playoffs 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The Irish have been gaining momentum since mid­December, but it took a Michigan State setback last weekend to refocus a team firing on almost all cylinders. 
Notre Dame {9-12-3 CCHA, 11-16-3 overall) swept the No. 20 Ferris State Bulldogs (9-10-5, 14-12-6) 4-1 and went 3-2 in its home-and­home series on Friday and Saturday night. 
The sweep pushes the Irish into a tie for ninth place with Alaska-Fairbanks, which swept Bowling Green in its weekend series. The two teams now trail Northern Michigan and Ohio State by just one point for seventh place, a crucial spot as the No. 8 team earns a home berth in the first round of the

FENCING 
Victory is svveet cap for season 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

Notre Dame has a lot to be pleased about as the regular season comes to a close. 
The Irish fencers, ranked No. 1 in the women's poll and No. 2 in the men's, completed two 6-0 sweeps at the UC-San Diego Duels over the weekend, fmish­ing the regular season with twin 29-1 records. 
"Frankly speaking, we will say that it was a very strong per­formance of the young team," Irish head coach Janusz Bndnarski said. 
The event's biggest matchup pit­ted the Irish against No. 9 Stanford. Notre Dame had strong performances in both the men's and women's sides, winning 1 7-10 and 20-7, respectively.

Strong doubles set the tone for success in first home matches 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish snapped a three­game losing streak this week­end, winning all three of their matches at the Eck Tennis Pavilion to improve to 4-4 on the season. 
Notre Dame topped Purdue 6-1, Wisconsin 6-1 and Bradley 7-0 to rebound from a difficult road trip early in the season. 
"A 'W' is always better than an 'L,"' head coach Bobby Bayliss said. "I think some of the guys needed to win some matches and I think that was good." 
Notre Dame 6, Purdue 1 
The Irish came out strong against the Boilermakers with a win in the doubles competi­tion, and they never looked back. 
In the first doubles match, Eric Langenkamp and Andrew Roth won 8-5 at No. 3, but Ryan Keckley and Barry King fell 8-5 at No. 1 to leave the point in the hands of· Brett Helgeson and Sheeva Parbhu. 
Parbhu and Helgeson won 8-3 at No. 2 to put the Irish up 1-0 going into the singles matches. 
"I thought Purdue came in and really played hard against us," Bayliss said. "We surpris­ingly won the doubles point quickly -they usually play great doubles, and we got the false impression we might be in for an easy day." 
In singles, Keckley won 6-1, 6-4 to offset a loss by captain Patrick Buchanan by a score of 6-4, 6-2. 
Stephen Bass won 6-4, 6-4 at No. 1 to put the Irish within one point of victory, and Parbhu clinched the win for the Irish at No. 2 with a 6-2, 6­2 victory. 
King won at No. 3 despite dropping the second set with a score of 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.

Blue Demons crush Irish 
Irish set possession record but lose big to No. 15 DePaul 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame set a new school record for fewest turnovers in a game Sunday at the DePaul Athletic Center-and lost by 29. 
The Irish (14-9, 5-7 Big East) turned the ball over only six times but shot just 25 percent from the field Sunday and suffered a 79­50 drubbing at the hands of No. 15 DePaul (19-5, 7 -5). It was Notre Dame's worst defeat since Tennessee beat the Irish 89-50 in the NCAA Tournament on March 17, 2002. 
Unfazed by Notre Dame's ability to maintain posses­sion, DePaul attacked to the very end, scoring on fast break opportunities and long three-pointers in the final minutes to cap off a game in which the Blue Demons shot 51 percent
