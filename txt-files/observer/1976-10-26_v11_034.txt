Law Society survey encouraging 
by Patrick Cole Senior Staff Reporter 
In a recent survey by the Notre Dame Law School Placement Of­fice, over 80 percent of the students participation in the survey have found jobs--68 percent throur;}q~ e Law School Placement Offic.... .... J 25 percent through their own efforts. 
The results are tentative since all members of the Class of 1976 have not responded. Twenty-four per­cent of the students have not answered their questionnaires. 
Law firms employed 55 percent 
of last year's graduating class, the most of any type of employer. Twenty-one percent work in state, local and federal branches of the government; 10 percent accepted judicial clerkships and four percent are employed by both corporations-and accounting firms. 
Of those who have accepted an offer for work, a third of them earn between $16,000 and $18,000 as a starting salary. Twenty-one stu­dents are earning between $13,000 and $15,000 in their first year of em employment. Another 15 percent 
are making between $10,000 and  $13,000. 
Eight students or nine percent of the graduating class are earning over $18,000 in their first year of employment. 
High Placement Rate 
According to Mildred Kristowj­ski, placement director of the Notre Dame Law School Placement Of­fice, upon graduating about 80 percent of the law students have found jobs.

"We place better than a lot of other schools," Kristowski stated. Last year in the Class of 1975, 88 percent of the 107 students found employment. 
During the past year, almost 100 

interviewers  visited  the  Notre  
Dame  Law  School  to  look  for  
employees.  This  includes  law  

firms, government agencies and corporations from Sept. 22, 1975 to May 6, 1976. 
In addition, 220 employers con­tacted the Law School Placement Office requesting that interested students send resumes. 
Employers Speak Out 
Interviewers come from all over the country to talk to Notre Dame law students about employment possibilities. In October, the interviewers have come from Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas and Miami as well as those from 
the Midwest and the East Coast. In fact, many prestigious firms come to Notre Dame such as Shearman and Sterling, a Wall Street-based firm and Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, a law firm in Washington D.C. 

John A. McLeod, an interviewer from Jones and Day, talked about the qualities he looks for in a Notre Dame law student. "There are a number of things we look for: a sense of maturity and responsibil­ity, common sense, the ability to get along with others and the ability to solve complicated prob­lems," McLeod indicated. 
McLeod, a 1969 graduate of the Notre Dame Law School, empha­sized the need for a lawyer to be able to express himself and a "sense of purpose. of knowing where they are going." 
David Minnick, an interviewer form Lillick, McHose, and Charles, a law firm in Los Angeles, stressed the. need for students to be able to deal with people. Minnick, how­ever, did not base his criteria solely on grades. 
"When you look at the overall picture, a low grade average may be a good one when seeing the other factors involved," he said. 
In evaluating students for em­ployment, "law firms are going to the second-year-student summer internship or summer associate to see how promising a student's potential may be," according to Robert McCartney, an interviewer from Eckert, Seamans, Cherin and Mellot law firm in Pittsburgh. 
"When you have this refer­ence," McCartney pointed out, ''this is better than how a student does in school. If I talk to a student who doesn't have internship exper­ience, then we have to look at his grades," he said.

Decision '76 
Candidates make last minute election efforts 
by Richard Pyle Associated Press Writer 

President Ford, stressing econ­omic themes in this last pre-elec­tion visit to crucial California and other Western states, promised Monday to hold down federal spending because it contributes to inflation that is ''just another high tax." 
He also d..:clared during a visit to Seattle, a city troubled by high unemployment, that his recent proposal to require aircraft noise reduction would result in 250,000 
new jobs for the aircraft construc­tion industrv. 
In Plains: Ga., Democrat Jimmy Carter made preparations for his own coast-to-coast trip that will keep him moving in search of vo~es until the eve of the electiOn showdown with Ford on Nov. 2. 
Aides to Carter said the Demo­cratic nominee would issue a statement on the environment be­fore his scheduled departure for South Carolina and Illinois Tuesday morning. 
He will visit eight states, includ­
ing six of the largest where 
strategists for both campaigns believethe electionmay be decided. Pol_ls show Carter slightly ahead slightly behind or running neck­and-neck with Ford in these areas. 
These states include California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsyl­vania, and Texas. Fora is covering much of the same ground on a campaign-closing barnstorming tour which -like Carter's -is accompanied by a media blitz of radio and television appearances. 
Live programs 

Ford, touring California on Sun­the experience to merit voter approva, Ford argued that Carter would imperil United States secur­ity by slashing $5 billion to $7 billion from the defense budget -a measure that the Democrat insists can be carried out simply by cutting waste. 
Ford said, "I don't challenge Mr. Carter's good intentions but I do challenge his programs.'' 
In a speech to be braodcast on the Mutual radio network, the President promised to restrain federal spending because it con­tributes to inflation. "I don't believe the American people inflation is just another high tax," he declared. 
Ford cited Department of Labor consumer price index figures show­ing that during his administration. the annual rate of inflation has dropped from 12 percent to les-s than 6 percent.

WSND-FM: A dangerous precedent 
Dear Editor: 
The administration of the Uni­versity has established a dangerous precedent. Since its inception, the student workers at WSND-FM have had complete control of all programming and policy decisions. We have recently been informed, however, that this is merely an illusion. 
Last week, we at WSND received a request from an administrator that our FM station not carry Notre Dame Hockey games. Through a bureaucratic grapevine we were to find out that this request was, in fact, an ultimatum. Had WSND­FM gone through with its original intention to broadcast Notre Dame Hockey games we would have faced personnel removal and se­vere budget cuts. 
For the first time in the station's history, we have been the victims of censorship. The administration has, in effect, told us that we may do as we please; as long as what we do pleases them. We at WSND feel that this precedent destroys the value of the station to the student staff and their audience. 
The Provost of the University maintains that the University has always had the power to establish station policy, because it is the station's licensee. Why didn't they exercise this option six years ago when WSND-FM began to cover Notre Dame Hockey? Father Burtchaell's reply to this question was that the University was un­aware of our broadcast­ing of hockey games. This, to us, is a definite indication that control of the station has been in student hands. But, the University ad­ministration has taken it upon itself to stifle the diversity which has been a traditional part of WSND­FM's programming. 
As station manager, I have reluctantly decided to yield to the pressu;e exerted by the adminis­tration. Quite frankly, they've got us by the budget!

Supports 
WSND-FM 
Dear Editor: 
As a graduate of Notre Dame (class of '73) and an alumnus of WSND, serving as news director for two years, I feel compelled to express my opinion of the adminis­tration's recent decision to stop WSND-FM from broadcast­ing hockey games. 
The move was ill-advised for a number of reasons. First of all, for many years the students at WSND have had control of the format and content of WSND's programming, even though the station's license is held by the University. Now that the University feels that students are not intelligent enough to pro­gram WSND-FM, it would not surprise me if students start losing interest in the formerly student-run station. I. know that when I was news director we aired a number of stories which made the administra­tion unhappy. Ifthe University had ever stepped in and overruled our judgment as to what belonged on the air, I would have left WSND and let the University officials try and run a radio station. 
The fact is that WSND-FM has carried some hockey games for the past five years, although last year may have been the first time that the whole schedule was carried. How can the administration now step in and say that hockey does not belong on WSND-FM? The station has always strived to be an alternative to other area radio stations. It has been a very good alternative, providing class­ical music, jazz. bluegrass, and, yes, hockey. 
I'm afraid that I am grasping for some sort of written eloquence, unsuccessfully. But it makes me angry that the University would so seriously damage a long standing tradition of alternative pro­gramming on WSND-FM. Al­though I was never involved with The Observer, I would think it prudent for you people of the print media to watch out. ·

Hates Pro-Lifers 
Dear Editor: 

I am disgusted with those who call themselves Pro-Life. Harass­ing the candidates, picketing . at rallies, and slandering those who disagree with their own views by calling them "murderers", they have attempted to bring into the Presidential campaign an issue which is a moral issue, not an election issue. Why harass the Presidential candidates for an a­mendment? Congress and the STares are responsible for amend­ments. The President has little to do with the process. And even if he had, it is still a moral issue. Being a moral issue, it is only up to the individual to decide right and wrong. No one can judge another's moral values. Because, simply, morals are an individual affair. 
Abortion is a moral issue. It is up to the mother to decide if she wishes to bear the child. After all, she has to bear it, give labor for it, and care for the child most of its life; she does, not the bishops. Shouldn't she be the one who should decide whether or not she wished to bear it? 
I may be personally opposed but I will fight forever for the right of a woman to choose. Have anv of the Pro-lifers given considera"tion to the effects upon the country and its people if an amendment were to be passed? Are they naive enough to think that an amendment will abolish all abortions? Instead of being done in a clean hospital room by a competent doctor, the situa­tion will reverse into the twenties with all the splendor of a dirty scalpel in the hands of a backroom butcher. "Morality" may perhaps be high but mortality will be even 
highe~. 

Does Man ever learn? Is history "Watching Carter and Ford is like watching Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd!" 

doomed to repeat itself? Once 
before we had a small vocal 
minority impose its morals upon 
the whole nation. The group was 
the temperance union. The act: 
prohibition. The result: Organized 
crime. And this time? 
Paul Herbig 
No more of Mr. Nice Guy 
Dear Editor: 
When I read yesterday's Ob­
server, I noticed that a plurality of 
the student body seems to be 
incline to cast their votes for 
President Ford. This saddens me, 
but does not surprise me given the 
change of attitudes among the 
student body. Still it is not easy for 
me to forget such unpleasantnesses 
as Chicago in 1908, Kent Sate in 
1970, the My Lai massacre, the 
Christmas Bombings of 1972, the 
successful conspiracy to overthrow 
the democratic govern­
ment of Chile, the almost success­
ful conspiracy to overthrow. the 
Constitutions of the United States, 
the gross manipulation of the 
economy to the advantage of the 
great corporations, and the ad­ministration's war a­gainst the young, the black, the poor and the workers. 

President Ford, nice guy that he is, supported Mr. Nixon in all of these policies and has continued those policies. His racism is subtle but obviously there. His high moral call to the white middle class is that they should go and enjoy their affluence like pigs sunning themselves contentedly in the mud. 
His cry in his talk about taxes is that their money should no longer go to the lazy, good for nothing, poor, (i.e. blacks), but instead be used to buy new toys for the Pentagon (i.e. the B-1, nuclear aircraft carriers, etc.) to give us 'security,' as if a few more H­bombs are going to add to our security. 
His answer to energy crisis is to rape nature and have us play Russian Roulette with the gun called 'peaceful' nuclear power. Admittedly Jimmy Carter is a question mark. But there is a slim chance he might be different. Ford offers no hope, unless, of course, you approve of this country's slow drift toward fascism.

WASHINGTON--As the exciting election campaign comes to a close we must come to the following conclusions. 
Had Gerry Ford chewed gum on the second debate and walked at the same time, he would have never put his foot in his mouth. 
The best' time for Israel to get weapons from the United States is during the last three weeks of the presidential campaign. 
The best time for American farmers to get increased supports for grain is three weeks before the election. 
Vice President Rockefeller points with the wrong finger. 
Jimmy Carter does things in his heart that he could be arrested for if he did them in 30 of the SO states he's been campaigning in. 
President Ford can't balance his checkbook. 
If Ford is elected, he will probably appoint a Polish-Ameri­can to the Supreme Court. 
If Carter is elected, he will pardon the editor of Playboy maga­zine. 
Congress is respons­ible for everything that has gone wrong in the United States since Ford was sworn in as President. 
It doesn't pay to play golf in Washington with a lobbyist. 
The United States, according to President Ford, is respect­ed throughout the world and any­one who says it isn:t is tearing down the United States. 
The United States, according to Jimmy Carter, is ·not respected around the world because Henry Kissinger makes secret promises he never keeps. 
The League of Women Voters is on Eugene McCarthy's enemy list.

Carter and Playboy 
By Fr. Bill Toohey 
As I walked out of the drugstore with the current issue of Playboy (in a plain paper-bag, thoughtfully provided by a sympathetic clerk), I wondered how many thousands of other non-regular readers would be doing the very 'same thihg, all of them curious to know, "What did Carter really say in that interview, anyway?" 
Rt;;ading the entire text gives a strikingly different impression from what one was , given to expect from the news reports and comments from politicians, editorial writers and religious commentators. As a matter of fact, the effects is so very contr".ry that you become angry that you were victimized by such wholesale distor­tions in the earlier reports. It was like the unfair impressions one got from the pre-publication excerpts from The Final Days that appeared in Newsweek. 
Granted that Carter undoubtedly did a very questionable thing in submitting to an interview in a rag like Playboy (with its ads for ceiling mirrors and advice column on timely topics like sado-masochism), still the person you discover after a careful study of the entire interview is a man of integrity, honesty, humility and authentic religious faith. 
The free-wheeling interview touched almost everything: Vietnam, homosexual­ity, corporations, religion, civil rights, the media, his relationship with his wife, the judges he would appoint, taxes, how he felt about his son fighting in Vietnam, health care, and even the possibility of his own assassination. In all of this, Carter is amazingly forthright and candid. Even though the interview was far-ranging, the Playboy interviewer made sure sex came up again and again and again. And this is where Carter has been catchi~g most of the flack. 
What Carter really did was to offer a fairly standard explanation of his Baptist faith. He gave a solid exposition of the 
Concerts 
Christian teaching about forgiveness and humility. He tried to explain to his questioners that, as president, he would not be self-righteous, puritanical or reli­giously intolerant. H~ offered an extem­poraneous version of the Pharisee and Publican parable, and an interpretation of the teachings o'f Jesus, as contained in the fifth chapter of St. Matthew. 
The governor really wasn't trying to make a major point about sex at .all; he was more deeply concerned, you learn, about demonstrating that the basic Christian message is that we are not "saved" by moral performance but by God's grace. Carter did no more than admit that he is like the rest of us, a sinner. He acknowledged that he is sorry for the mistakes of his life; he affirmed that he attempts to live an exemplary life; he is certain that in the love of the Lord we are able to find forgiveness for our sins; and he personally refuses to judge others because · he knows this would call forth God's judgment against himself. 
Unfortunately, as soon as· Carter used the expression ''lust in my heart,'' he was in trouble. This sounded to many like a horrible thing for a prominent man to admit; but thi's is actually a standard formula from the language of Baptist catechetics, and could be translated into 
· our terminology as, "I was tempted." So Carter was trying; like a conscientious Sunday school teacher, to communicate some fundamental facts about the strengths and weaknesses of human na­ture. It is hard to see in this a clear sign of hypocrisy or fraud. It is much easier to acknowledge that the man who emerges from that interview is a humble and honest man who makes no claims about his spiritual superiority-over any other person. Carter comes through as a man deeply committed to Christ and the gospel imperative. He reveals himself as neither

Love, peace and togetherness. 

This was the message in the music of Earth, Wind, and Fire as they performed at the ACC on Friday. October 15. All who attended received the message loud and clear. A most impressive entrance featured the twelve member ensemble, adorned ih floor-length red capes, mar­ching into the arena, climbing onto structures resembling futuristic tepees, which ~ubsequently lowered to the stage in draw bridge fashion, revealing the heroes of the evening, they flung off their cape's andno time was wasted in getting the show 
. off to an eye catching and ear pleasing beginning. Accompanying the entrance were oceans of fog, explosions of light, and a tape of music sounding similar to something that might be heard at an affair in honor of the King of England. 
"Celebrate" was the first number heard by the unusually enthusiastic crowd, after a lengthy initial instrumental. The boys in the band got the crowd going early, and everyone was in a partying mood. The continuous excitement and near perfect music of EW&F was evident as they went right into "Feeling". 
The crowd was in the hands of the band, and when the first few notes of "That's the Way" were heard, everyone was on their feet, demonstrating various signs of ap­proval, throughout the almost flawless performance, 
EW&F have the unique ability to intersperse their hit songs with lesser known material, without losing the interest of the audience. At only one point did the concert border on becoming monotonous, and this was during the drum solos, which really were not ·necessary, and actually disrupted the smooth flow of the ·concert. However, the guitar solo was performed well, and I suppose the solos were featured in order to enable each individual instru­ment to share a portion of the main spotlight. 
those times when you're thinking of that 
"certain someone." The vitality and 
versatility of EW&F is something that 
makes their concerts so much better than 
the average showcase of soul music. 
Love is a prevalent' theme in many of their songs, and at one point in the concert they told the audience that "love is not ' only physical, but spiritual, that it knows no race. creed. or color, that it is free, warm, and cool, and that if you don't use it, you're going to lose it." Everyone in 
attendance seemed to agree. 
The band opened up the self proclaimed 

"tighter part of the show" with "Shining 
Star," and no one was seated at this time. 
·:sing a Song" was next, creating a city 
block party atmosphere in the ACC. The 
show concluded with three fire-like explo­
sions, the flashing of the words Earth, 
Wind, & Fire in neon lights, amidst 
thunderous applause, yells and foot stom­
ping. For an encore, "Get Away", 
from the recently released "Spirit" album 
was performed, and the crowd liked it as 
they soulfully rocked along with the unique 
brand of music of the group that bears the 
name of the mighty elements, Earth, Wind 
& Fire. 
The opening act, "The Emotions", 

provided an ample taste of soul to ready 
the crowd for the electric ev~ning which 
was to follow. Consisting of three girls who 
handle the singing and a backup of three 
guitars, drums and keyboard, "The Emo­
tions" served up laid· back, "old fash­
ioned" soul, reminiscent of the Supremes, 
the Ronettes, and the Marvellettes. 
The concert was a satisfying one, In 

fact, I think it would be safe to say that 
everyone got their money's worth, and 
then some, which is more than you can say 
for a lot of concerts today. 
It's encouraging to see the crowds at the 

ACC becoming more enthusiastic, but I do 
wish the ACC would come out of the dark 
ages and permit a dance concert to be held self-ri2hteous nor fanatical. 

Go~ernor Carter espoused the hope that his religious convictions will be a source of strength against doing evil while in public office; but he freely admits how easy it is for weak humans to fall. Accordingly, even though he feels he could not have been guilty of crimes such as those connected with Watergate, he is still cautious: "Not 
taking into consideration my hope for my strength of character. I think that my religious beliefs alone. would prevent that from happening to me. I have that confidence. I hope it's justified." 
The vehement criticism of Carter's interview has come from all quarters; but elements of the Catholic press have been particularly scathing in their attacks. Paul Hallett, for example, columnist with the National Catholic Register. suggests that Carter's "Playboy thinking" makes him unfit for president. "Jimmy Carter's 
' interview with Playboy,'' he writes. "Should settle all doubts that he is unfit to lead the American people. The very fact that he would give the sanction of his prestige to the scabrous pages of a publication that not only offends.decency in word and picture but actively campaigns against Christian morality shows that he · has not the regard for family morality that befits a figure whose power is as much 

Cinema 77 
moral as it is coercive." "Ford·~ personal religion may be no better than Carter's," Hallett continues, "but Ford shows more balance and discrimination. Be'>idcs. he has the experience of office. A vote for Ford would be a vote against the moral and political confusion exhibited by Carter." 
Once you try your best to give a fair and thorough reading to the Carter interview. a commentary like Hallett's. giving a vastly different impression than the one you get from the original text. onlv makes vou wonder.. ,about things like ~mcar-job and bum-rap. Each person will have to decide for himself. of course. but onlv. let l.ls hope. after taking the trouble t~ tind out exactly what the man actually said. 

Neuer Old Fashioned 
By David 0' O'Keefe 
Before I write anything about Our Hospitality. I w_ould like-to go on record as saying that doing a critical analysis of a Buster Keaton film is like dissecting a whoopie cushion. There's something inhernetly absurd and ultimately self-de­feating about the whole process, but I imagine it's good to know something more about a film outside the fact that it is very, 
very funny. 

In any event, Buster Keaton is about as p popular among the younger generation (us) as blue jea'ns. There is something timelessly endearing about his humor that makes him perenially pepular on college campuses and the sort. 
But he is not a fad; his picture isn't splattered across the fronts of sweaters and t-shirts. He isn't cuddly-cute like Charlie Chaplin or fat-and-skinny-funny like Laurel and Hardy or even irreverantly heroic like Groueho. He is steadily pathetic, merciless­ly persecuted by an unsympathetic world 

that shuts its door in his sad face. The lives of his charqcters are constant struggles, but hey never give up. And in the end, Keaton wins. 
None of this is, on the surface, very funny. But what is so funny are the methods he uses in winning. He slips and stumbles along his way, supported by his constant companions: his hat, his mutt and his simple virtue. He is innocent and unsuspecting when he isn't being threat­ened, but wh~n the cahse is on he is as crafty and calculating as his enemies. Nay, craftier. He wins. remember. 
Our Hospitality shows him at his best, Keaton plays Willie McKay, a young New Yorker who returns to the South to claim the estate left to him by his dead father. What Willie doesn't know. but soon learns· is that his father was a casualty of a long-standing family feud between the McKays and the Canfields. 
Willie leaves his aunt in New York and boards the train for the South. The entire sequence showing the dangerously delapi­dated train rolling its way across the land is riotous. At one point. a beat-looking old · man appears by the tracks and starts shelling the engineer with stones. The engineer is shocked but recovers quickly and starts firing back logs of firewood at the man as the train rolls along. Finally. as the train disappears. the old man gleefully gathers up his hard-earned firewood and trots happily back to his cabin. _ 
Willie finally arrives. and from the moment he steps off the train to the closing scene of the film we are treated to one of the funniest cat-and-mouse games imagin­able. It is all high hilarity without ever falling to the less dignified depths of slapstick and pratfall. Keaton's insistence on doing his own stunts make scenes such as the waterfall scene amHhc cliff scene in this film frighteningly suspenseful. 
Keaton's films may be old but thev are far from old fashioned. He -was not onh a comic genius but a serious film technician and director. But he was serious onlv in his determination to make his audiences laugh. and it is to his continue-d ·credit that. SO years later, they're still laughing.

Irish shoot down ducks 
(continued from page 8) 
''This was one of those days when we had a hot hand," Irish mentor Dan Devine remarked. "We got some breaks inthe first half and had really good field position most of the time." 
With 11: 11 left in the contest, the Irish backfield was completely com: posed of backups. Rusty Lisch was doing the signal calling and Brow­ner and Ferguson were the running backs. 
The final Irish tally came with 

Top twenty 

The Top Twenty teams in The Associ~ted Press college_ football poll, w1th first-place votes m paren­7:59 remaining in the game. Ferguson started the drive with consecutive runs of 24 and 14 yards. He then ended the drive with a two yard touchdown plunge. That score marked Ferguson's first in a Notre Dame uniform. 
In retrospect, the Ducks could not function offensively or defen­sively. The Irish defense gave the offense excellent field position for most of the battle. In fact, every Irish scoring drive began in Oregon territory. ~ 
THe Irish took advantage of their tremendous field position as well as the many Oregon mistakes. Notre 
Dame took command from the beginning and never stopped. The Irish were ready for this
