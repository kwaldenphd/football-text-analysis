Campus groups lobby for sports scholarships 
by Mark Rust News Editor 
Captains of the various var­
sity sports will meet tonight 
with student government repre­
sentatives to discuss ways in 
which they might influence 
the University to reinstate scho­
larships for non-revenue pro­
ducing sports. Student Body 
President Bill Roche has also 
started a petition drive to 
qualify student sentiment, and 
met with University officials 
on three occassions, but other 
than that, according to Roche, 
"there's not much we can do." 
"We just don't have all the 
information we need," Roche 
said yesterday. Fr. Edmund 
Joyce, executive vice-president 
of the University, defended the 
scholarship cut by pointing 
out that hockey, which uses 
20 of the 40 cut scholarships, 
loses ''too much'' money. 
But how much is too much is 
unclear. 
In order for the student 
government to have any effect­
ive voice in the sports funding 
decision, thev need to know 
how much the program act­
ually loses and what can be 
done to reverse the situation. 
) oyce, acco~ciing to Roche, has 
thus far declined to give them 
that information on the grounds 
that it would be "impractical." 
The University informed the athletic department in mid­January that no further scholar­ships would be offered to non­revenue producing sports ''until a firm decision has been reached by the board of Trustees.'' That decision could come as early as Friday, when the executive committee of the board meets in Key Biscayne this weekend. 
According to Dick Conklin, 
director of Information 
Services, the executive board 
is empowered -to make 
decisions for the board. 
"Fr. Joyce told me he didn't know whether the decision would be made then," Roche said. "I think they need to provide us with more information than we are now getting. If they don't make a decision on Friday then that's okay. We just don't want them to make a decision to cut fund­ing without allowing us to have some influence.'' 
Roche said he would be happy if the board decided to re­instate the scholarships. He said he would be unhappy if they decided to definitely keep the cuts without giving the students a chance to voice their opinions. 
In the meantime, no decision by the board would meari that the cuts will occur at least until the full board meets in the late spring. 

Roche said he hopes to bring some of the captains with him to the Grace Pit tonight at 8 p.m., when Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, will address some of these issues. 
Facts pertatntng to the scholarship cut controversy are sketchy: it is unclear, for instance, how much the hockey program actually loses. Three students who recently attended a meeting with Joyce con­cerning the future of the hockey program recalled Joyce using figures as varied as $60,000 and $120,000. Greg Meredith, captain of the hockey team, says the figure is closer to $90,000, depending on the accounting method used. 
But some student government officials, including Vice-Presi­dent Bill Vita and Executive Coordinator Jose Marrero, feel the real issue lies not in how much '.1oney hockey loses, but how mtn:h the University is willing to support hockey and programs like it. 
"Fr. Joyce has insinuated that students do not support hockey, but even if prices were increased to $4 and attendance doubled that still would be a drop in the bucket compared to what the University says hockey loses,'' Vita said.

0 'Mearafields questions from Faculty Senate 
by Annman'e Storz 

University Provost Timothy O'Meara, speaking to the Faculty Senate last night in the CCE, responded to a vanety of questions raised by the 36 memhers in attendance. O'Meara requested that a greatdeal of the subject matter concerning such issues as tenure appeals, faculty salaries andpay raises, and other issues be "off the record. '' 
O'Meara has, he said "reservations" about the action being taken concerning tenure appeal procedures. He feels that the "appeals committee should not apply academic standards between departments" in tenure cases, although, "a committee could say a tenure package was not handled seriously, or there was a prejudice, or something crucial missing that should have been contained in the package.'' 
Thirty-three cases were up for consideration this year -double the amount for last year according to O'Meara. 
Course evaluations were discussed by Prof. Stephen Batill, representing the committee on Student Affairs. A Faculty Attitude survey conducted early this year discovered over 50 percent of the faculty wants to ''get rid of the course evaluations completely'' and 70 percent expressed dissatisfaction with the way evaluations were used in admmistrative decisions. 
O'Meara said that "they don't appear at promotion meetings" and scores must be utilized in the department chairman's overall evaluation of a candidate as a teacher. 

All 66 departments in the University have a Committee on Appointments and Promotions which evaluate tenure packages before it ttavels successively to the department chairman, the dean of the college, and finally to a committee composed of the Provost and others 
The problem concerning cheating at Notre Dame and the financial situation faced by retired professors were also discussed ''off the reco:-d'' 
1 rwin Press, professor of anthropology, raised the issue of the attitude expressed by seniors. He feels tha~ they are "screwing off' and the administration must face this problem concerning the lack of academic seriousness in the senior year. 
O'Meara said that "teachers have to be as tough as they can be" and although "we have a problem in standards, our standards are better than most places.'' He said we are not fostering intellectual curiosity in our students. We are getting them into medical school but are we producing Catholic intellectuals?" 
O'Meara was asked to tell the senate what he feels are his accomplishments, failures and priorities as provost. In his one-and -a-half years as provost, O'Meara said he has "tried to continue the evolution of the University in the area of scholarship." He '''tries to base decisions, never with personalties in mind, but with

Roche speaks toHPC on hockey fate 
by Tom Hay Senior StaffReporter 
The future of the hockey team 
and new proposals for party 
guidelines were the topics 
headlining last night's HPC 
meeting in Lyons Hall. 
Bill Roche, student body pre­
sident, expressed concern over 
the pending fate of the Notre 
Dame hockey program. ''Hoc­
key is really in jeopardy right 
now," RQche said. "There 
are several issues involved in 
the whole athletic scene, in-­
eluding Title IX, but right now 
the urgency is on hockey.'' 
Roche admitted that he was 
not certain then the adminis­
tration would make know their 
posmon on non-revenue pro­
ducing sports, but he added 
that a decision could come 
very soon. 
"We don't know if they will make their decision this week, in May, or whenever, but right now, theoretically, hockey could get bagged on Friday," 
Roche said. 
HPC Chairman Ellen Dorney pointed out that the issue was ''not hockey versus women's sports, but hockey for hockey's sake." 
Roche initiated a petition drive to voice student opposition to the proposed elimination of hockey scholarships. ''What we're looking for is a concrete expression of student support. I hope the administration will take that into account when they make their decision on hockey,'' he said. 
Roche said he hoped the petitions will allow some stu­dent input into the decision making process, but added, "Going out to the games is certainly going to help alot too.'' 
Petitions will be available in the dining halls today, and

Italian terrorists shoot Roman Catholic activist ROME -A young woman and a bea,rded male shot and killed one of Italy's leading Roman Catholic acivists yesterday as he walked out of his law class into a hallway at the University of Rome, polic reponed. Callers to two newspapers several hours after the attack claimed it was the work of the Red Brigades, Italy's most feared terrorist gang. Vittorio Bachelet, 54, a top Italian judge, was the 11th person killed bt terrorists since 1976. He presumably was chosen for assasination because of high ranking in the governing body of Italy's judicial system. The Red Brigades have vowed to strike Jt governmental agencies. Bachelet had served as consultant to the Vatican and was a ll>ng time acquaintanle of PopeJohn Paul II, who condemned the attack as''abvminable crimes to stain the beloved city of Rtlme with blood." Bachelet was a former president of the Italian Catholic Action, a worldwide lay organization. In 1967, he first met the Pope the archbisop of Krakow, Poland, and they served together on the pontifical comission for the laity. Carter sends Marines to deter Soviets  WASHINGTON -The United States will send a Marine amphibious force into the Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea area next month in a new Carter administration move aimed at deterring any Soviet designs on the Persian gulf area, it was reported Tuesday night. The mission of the battalion .. sized force marks the first time that Marine combat troops will have been introduced by the United States into the Indian Ocean region. Previously, the only Marines assigned there were a handful serving as security guards aboard Navy ships. Administration officials said that a four-ship Navy amphibious force with 1,800 Marines, helicopters, tanks and arrillery arrived Tuesday at the U.S. Navy base in the Phillippines. The source who asked not to be identified, said that after abuur rwo weeks of exercises there, the Marine amphibious unit will then sail aboard the four ships into the Indian Ocean and join up with powerful U.S. Naval formations which have been patrolling in the Arabian Sea within reach of the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

IOC rejects call for boycott 

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) ­The International Olympic Committee announced yester­day the Olympic Games will go on in Moscow as planned, thus rejecting President Caner's call that they be moved or cancelled because of the Soviet interven­tion in Afghanistan. 

The committee also urged that members of the Olympic organizing committee in Mos­cow inform the "highest au­thorities of their government of the circumstances which have created these difficulties for so many (National Olympic Com­mittees)." 
Lord Killanin, president of the l OC, said that all 7 3 members attending the IOC general session before the Win­ter Olympics had voted to keep the Summer Games in Mvscow. 
According to the U.S. State Department, more than 30 gov­ernments--as opposed to Olym­pi(: committees--have called for movement, postponement or cancellation of the Games. 
Killanin said the IOC recog­nized the difficulties the United States Olympic Committee faced but urged it to ''(:ontinue irs efforts ro make possible the participation of irs athletes in the Games'' 
The U.S. committee had pre­sented the IOC with Carter's demands. 
The IOC had been deliberat­ing for three days, although there was .little doubt that the 

Khomeini holds key to hostages 
(AP) -Freedom will come for the American hostages in' Iran only if their release is ordered by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomei­ni~ .the leader of the embassy mthtants was quoted as saying yesterday by a Persian Gulf 
newspaper.  He  said  Iran's  
president  should  stay  out  of  
the hostage isfue.  

The militant.-., meanwhile, carne under attack from Iran's Ambassador to the Uni.led Na­tions, who said in Geneva, Switzerland that they were beginning to lose credibility with the Iranian /eople'' and had gone "beyon their task." 
In an interview with the Asso­ciated Press, U.N. Ambassador Nansour Farhang said the em­bassy seizure Nov. 4 was "nev­er condoned" by the Revolu­tionary Council. Iran, he added, "is not interested in the Shah in terms of flesh and blood. We are interested in concepts, not revenge.'' 
According w the Abu Dhabi newspaper Al-lttihad, the mili­tants' leader, who was not identified by name, said his group rejected President Abol­hassan Bani-Sadr's proposed compromise solution for releas­ing the Americans, in their lOlst day of captivity Tuesday at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. 
He said the militants would help Bani-Sadr in his role as president "but he should not interfere in issues that are not dealt with in the constitution, such as the hostages issue,'' he was quoted as saying. 
ln an interview with French radio and television, Bani-Sadr repeated he would be willing to free the hostages in a matter of days if the United States admit­ted to its past wr0ngs in Iran, pledged not to interfere in its future and recognized Iran's right to obtain extradition of the deposed shah and his wealth, Tehran radio reported. He first made the offer in an interview published Monday in the 'French newspaper, Le Monde. 
The Stare Department said the 
U.S. government would not offer any apology. 
There was no ·comment from deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, living in Panama after receiving medical treatment in the United States at the time the embassy was seized. 
''The imam blessed our ac­tion," the militants' leader was quoted as saying. ~'The imam has not changed his position yet on the release of the hostages and I cannot see how other people can change their posi­tion. If the president has a different opinion then let him take it up with the imam ... The operation still has the imam's support and is in line with his teachings. We will never do anything against his wishes.'' 
Bani-Sadr has said he and the Revolutionary Council which he heads have sent to Khomeini their proposal on releasing the estimated 50 hostages that he is waiting for a response, possibly in the next few days.

the long term policies of the University in mind.'' 
0' Meara cited faculty salaries as his first priority, recog­nizing that increases, particu­larly in some colleges, are not keeping pace with inflation. He also cited the need for faculty development money, graduate students, library improvement, "Concern with the intellectual curisoity, devel­opment, and strength of the student body'' and finally "concern about reports on the problem of alcohol on campus.'' 
Tenure procedures were another topic of discussion at the meeting. Some faculty members expressed dissatisfac­tion with "insensitivity" of the administration concerning the date of arrival of some "final notices" last year. Whether a. notice comes as a surprise or is known m advance, according to 0' Meara, depends on the de­
partment  chairman's  strength  
and  the  receptivity  of  the  
faculty."  

Michael Francis, representing the committee on administra­tion, expressed the dissatis­faction of some departments with the allocation of funds for research. Those depart­ments without graduate study seem to be receiving different amounts for research. 
Press concurred in his "fear that good teaching is being downplayed in those depart­ments withour graduate pro­grams." 
According to 0' Me<:~.ra, the $3)0,000 grant which the Arts and Letters college recent­ly acquired may be utilized in the alleviation of this prob­lem. 0'Meara was asked about what he has done to encourage the quantity of research, spe­cifically in terms of grant1ng leaves of absence and improv­ing the library. The pro­vost said he is "pushing for a faculty office building" and offers "verbal encouragement to increase the quality not quantity of research.'' 
The Faculty Senate plans to discuss and vote on recom­mendations for appeals pro­cedures in tenure cc;tses, and to pass recommendations con­cerning the use of course evaluations as a method of determining teacher quality in its two remaining meetings this year. 

members would abide by their agreement with the Moscow Organizing Committee. 
"The IOC is fully aware of, and sensitive to, the world conditions which have created the most serious challenge to confront the Olympic Games,'' Killanin said in a news confer­
ence Tuesday night.  He  con­ 
cluded:  
''The IOC  cannot  solve the  

political problems of the world, but calls upon the governments of all countries, and in particu­lar those of the major powers, to come together to resolve their differences, and I, as president of the IOC, and all members, will do everything in our power to assist in this so that the Games of the XXIInd Olympiad can take place in the right atmosphere.'' 
Killanin noted that all 142 recognized national Olympic committees are bound by Olym­pic rules and they alone, and nor their governments, can accept or refuse invitations to the Olympic games. Carter has said that if the 
Soviets do not pull their troops out by Feb. 20, and the Games are not moved or cancelled, he would not want U.S. athletes to participate. 
The president reiterated that position yesterday through press spokesman Jody Powell m Washington. Powell was responding to a report in the Washington Post that the Unit­ed States might prolong the ultimatum until May 24--the date the U.S. Olympic Commit­tee has to send in Its entry for the Summer Games. 
Meanwhile, New York stare's highest court cleared the wav for the first team from Mainland China since the 1949 commun· ist revolution to participate in the Olympics. 
In a unanimous rutin~. tht' New York Court of Appeals refused to strike down an lOC rule barring the ream from Taiwan from <:ompering under the flag and anthem of tht' Republic of China. The high 
court acted on  an appeal from  
attorneys  for  rhe  Taiwanest'  
athletes.

-Scholarships support Notre Datne's ideals 
The University's threat to eliminate scholarships to non-profit bearing sports contradicts the idea of competition on which the University prides itself. The Observer believes that Executive Vice-president Edmund Joyce has ignored studenr concern for the sports programs. We support student effort to influence the final decision andquestion the Administration's perception of the issue. 
Since the January 16 announcement of a moratorium on scholarship offerings to the non-profit bearing sports, student support for the reversal of the decision has snowballed. Following last night's Hall Presidents Council meeting, a petition was circulated as part of an attempt to convince the Administration that many students disagree with Joyce's method of solving a farcical financial difficulty. 
The questions that the Administration and the trustees must answer before makingtheir decision are these: Why are sports important to the Notre Dame community? How important are these sports to that community? Where do scholarships fit into the overall athletic picture? 
The concept of sports is important to our whole culture. The ideas of competition, self-improvement, recreation, striving far ~xcellence and simple physical fitness are integral parts of any community or society. Notre Dame, as does America, capitalizes on many virtues of what has come to be known as "good sportsmanship." 
Sports at Notre Dame have been recognized as one of many areas in which students' excellence has gained national and international respect for themselves and their school. The University has rewarded its athletes for quality competition and has emphasized the importance of peer support and fellowship. The noise level of the campus on a September Saturday night reflects the outcome of that afternoon's football game. And Fr. Hesburgh himself sat on the end of the bench at Monday night's basketball game against San Francisco. Much of Notre Dame's reputation rests on the quality of their athletic teams. 
Scholarships are a means of attracting quality athletes who help to build quality teams and quality programs. The absence of quality in any program lessens the level of competition. Scholarships have a direct correlation to the quality of a sports program, with one or two exceptions. Scholarships are necessary to continue the University's support of those ideals of competition which Notre Dame 
promotes.  
According  to Joyc e's pragmatic  reaso ning,  the value  of  
sportsmanship  and  fellowship  is  less  than  the  value  of  
financial profit.  

The Observer and the students can not deal with facts and figures which the Administration withholds. Bur the theoretical argument is clear: the scholarships must stay. Or is the deterioration of "non-profit producing" sports, such as hockey, a narrow-minded goal of the Administration?

A gratuitous insult topeace-lovers 
Dear Editor: 

It strikes me as a gratuitous 
. insult to students and faculty alike when Professor Norling accuses all those of us among his colleagues who are not confirmed Cold Warriors of undermining the common sense of our students with such "anti-Christian" ideas as a love of peace. 
But does he really believe that the faculties at West Point (where Dwight Eisenhower went to college) and Annapolis (where Jimmy Carter went) consist of ''academic ideo­logues'' ,vho similarly corrupt their students because they ''hate their own societies''?

'Odeto a Father' provokes smile ofunderstanding 
Dear Editor: 

Chris Stewarr's column, "Ode 
Tu A Father," struck a very 
sensitive nerve within me. The 
young man's expectations of 
what he had hoped his father 
wuuld be parallel those that I 
had set for my morhf'r. 
Throughout myearly icens, the tcnsitlll between my motherandi grew insurmountably, due ro my own sotd-searching. In ;;eek~ng independence and 1tkn111y, I lost all avenues of cornrnunicat ion with my mo­t her. I didn · t want a mother. I wamcd a fnend. She couldn't quickly adjust to my new de­mands on her. After all, she'd been my mother for eighteen ye:ns, how could I expect her to suddenly change? Yet, I did. And the more I expecteci her ro change, the harder it became to communicate with her and love her. 
During a conversation we had ~'ver Christmas break, my mo­ther explained how sometimes we ser up unrealistically high cxpe<.:tations of the people we care abour. h becomes so <Lfficult for the other individual w live up to those expectations, whether consciously or not, that communication breaks down and the relationship falls apart. 
For the first time I listened to what those words meant and aued upon them. The change that resulted was unfathom­able. Now, we communicate because we accept and love each other for what we are and arc trying to become. 
I described this scenario to a friend of mine at a time when I felt that the lines of contmuni­catton between us were falling down. The reacnon that it elicited was a smile of under­standing. Chris Stewart's des­cription of the father-son rela­tionship provoked the same smile 111 my heart because I understood both perspectives and sets of expectations. I sincerely hope that the son can learn the lesson that took a lot of pain for me to learn.

However, that wasn't quite good enough. The article which was written by Mary Leavitt on Feb. ll was grossly inaccurate and unsubstantiated. In my opinil)n, this article was based solely·)n gossip and hearsay. ~o slatement was released by the Judicial Board regarding 
any decisions based on the 
LeMans hall incident. I am the .bl r 
only person responst e wr such a statement, and I was not available for comment. 
Finally, and most infuriat­
ingly, the statements made by me w~ich appeared ~n the Feb. 11 arttcle, were obtamed under false pretenses. An Observer 
reporter stated to me that she was writing: a~1 article. on the Slv\(:Judic~lprocess~ and in no .way was ·it r,;la~ed to the LeMans Hall pantes. · The

SMC]udtcial Commissioner 
Demands apology from The Observer 
Dear Editor: I .I
I have recently been dis­I heartened by the Jack of discre­tion The Observer staff has shown in divulging information to our student body. Last week following the violation of party rules in LeMans Hall an article appeared tn The Observer which clear!y stated students did not want any information printed concerning the sanc­tions they received. 
Unfortunately, The Observer persisted to seek out informa­tion against the will of these individuals. On Monday an article appeared in The Obser­ver which cle~rly violated the 
confidential relationship bet­ween members of the Judicial Board and the involved stu­dents. 
I have very good reason to 
believe that no member of the
d 

Judicial Board (or involve parties) broke the confidential relationship, yet The Obsen·er by "guesstimating" what hap­pened has successfully led us to 
believe otherwise. This may
lead to serious dis::rust between the students and the Judicial Board. 
Reading Mary Leavitt's an­
icle makes it clear that the Saint 
Mary's handbook served as her only source of information and that members of the Judicial Board respected the privacy of the involved students.
I believe students should be made aware of the conse­quences that will oc~ur if the:y violate college pohcy. Thts awareness is a student's indi­vidual responsibility obtained best by becoming familiar with the college handbook--not by The Observer breaking codes of

Police rescue politicalhostages 
'.\N SALVADOR, EL SAL­\'ADOR (AP) -Anti terrorist police units assaulted the Christian Democrat Party head­quarters yesterday, freeing 10 hostages during a gunfight that left one policeman and three left-wing militants dead, wit­nesses reported. About 100 leftists seized the building and hostag~s cv:o weeks ago. 
The attack came st-veral hours after five leftist demonstrators were shot to death and more than a dozen were wounded as they and others staged a ''victory'' march that ended their week-long occupation of the Education Ministry. 
Other left-wing extremists oc­cupying the Spanish Embassy freed the ambassador, Victor Sanchez Nesa, last night, but said they would hold five other hostages "until our demands our met.''

The  police  raid  on  the

Security forces in neighboring Guatemala attacked the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City Jan. 31 when it was taken over by protesting pea­sants and 3 7 persons perished in a fire that broke out during the skirmish. Spain severed relations with Guatemala, and El Salvador's ruling junta has assured Spanish officials force would not be used to free the embassy captives here.

Gerni displays cool shooting, hot temper 
by Barb Bn'dges StaffReporter 
After chastising Notre Dame student Activities Commission­er Tim Coughlin, five-time world champion billiard player Paul Gerni demonstrated the trick-shots that have made him 
famous  yesterday  m  a  show  
at the NDpool-hall.  
Gerni,  who  showed  up  late  
to  the  1 p.m.  show,  became  

critical when students conti­nued to play pinball and pool as he performed. 
The angered Gerni threatened to leave, but Coughlin pointed our that Gerni was under con­tract. After five minutes, the disturbance was settled as Coughlin asked students to stop their other activities, and Gerni performed his billiard feats. 
Gerni has appeared at Notre Dame for the past four years. "Needless to say, he will not be back again,'' Coughlin said. Coughlin commented that he ''would like to apologize to all the people that were there for Gerni 's unprofessional be­havior. I hope they enjoyed the following show. '' 
Gerni demonstrated numerous trick shots as expounded bil­liard hints to aspiring players. 
Pocket billiards is the second most popular sport in the country. To Paul Gerni, it is a ''very classy sport'' that is growing in world-wide re-
key to Notre Dame was the 
biggest  mistake  he  ever  
made,"  Marrero  added.  
"I don't  think  the  University  
has  put  much  emphasis  on  

supporting hockey. Students were not offered season tickets in the summer along with basketball ticket offers, they wouldn't let WSND FM (a station with a broadcasting radius of 30 miles) air hockey games, and they didn't even hint that this might happen until late in the hockey season. Srudenrs haven't had time to mount a publicity drive and show their support." 
That is the opinion of many students, Marrero said, and Roche added he hopes the petitions will prove it. 
"We want to give the ex­ecutive board some statistical evidence of support.'' Roche said. ''And we want to know what is being done. Nobody will even tell us accurate 
r
1acts. , 
The student government leaders indicated that when the executive board deals with this issue on Friday, board mem­bers will have to discuss a related subject: Title IX, and its implication for future ath­letic budgets. In the mean­time, according ·to Roche, " a lot of people are upset over this."

cognition because of his am­
bassadorial efforts. 
A graduate of Purdue Uni­
versity, Gerni started playing . pool at age six in the re­creation room of his father's parish. Gerni started winning tournaments at age seven, and continued to win throughout high school and college. Gerni has been a rpofessional billiard player for etght years and his reputation has scy-rocketed. 
Gerni holds the record for 
pocketing 166 balls consecu­
tively. He became the World 
Champion trick-shooter in 1978 
when he sank 21 balls with 
one shot. 
The billiard wonder runs on 
a tight schedule. His home 
is in Kansas City, but the 
majority of his time is spent 
traveling throughout the world. 
~erni is making major strides 
m abolishing the "smoke-filled 
room, beer guzzling pool-hall" 
image for which billiards has 
traditionally been noted. 
Gerni travels abroad and an­
nually performs about 200 
shows for commercial and be­
nefit purposes, and at colleges. 
Various .national billiard fede­
rations sponsor Gerni in his 
effort to promote the game. 
Both the efforts and the re­
wards have been ~rear, claimed 
Gerni. ''I've gtven a lot to 
the game, and now the game 
is gtving back,'' said Gerni. 
Gerni is consistently the high­
est paid player in his business. 
Gerni accrues benefits from 
television shows such as Bar­
etta and the Bionic Woman 
because he devises the bil­
liard shots used in various 
episodes. A lite Beer commer­
Cial uses another one of Ger­
ni's trick shots. 
Gerni' s crusade for pocket billiards is also carried out via his articles in U.S., British, and Swedish magazines. Films are another medium in which Gerni displays his billiard tal­ent. 
''I take the tournament side and the entertainment side, and I'm right in the middle," he said. "I want to get the, audience so excited they can't wait to grab a cue.'' brian Morris, an independent promoter who accompanied Gerni to Notre Dame, produ­cing a film in the United Kingdom about ''snooker'' champion Fred Davis. Gerni will appear in the film, and has also been an advisor for another billiard film, the ''Baltimore Bullet.'' The two films will premier together in Baltimore on March 21. 
Morris said he feels that programs like Gerni' s need more exposure. He asserted that billiards in America "has big things happening,'' and that the ''universities should start getting into it." 
Morris criticized the student union for holding Gerni' s show in the pool hall rather than in a ballroom setting where Gerni usually performs. "The 
very thing they're trying to get away from is happen­ing here." 
At present, Gerni has just finished planning a "jailhouse invitational" tournament to ~e held at Leavenworth Pf niten­tiary in Kansas, whid. will pit ''the greatest pros and cons against each other.'' 
Gerni is proud of the new billiard image he is helping to spread, and he likes the chal­lenge of the game. "It's the kind of /arne that'., ea~v co learn an difficult to nasrer.'' he said.
