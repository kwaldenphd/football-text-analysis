We can smell the love in the air. ;V~
But in southern California, love is not Rolando de Aguiar the season's aroma. All Viewpoint Editor that Los Angelinos can 
smell is fear-the fear -------­of riots and hatred and bigotry. And the odor is spreading quickly. The media, The Observer included, continues to tell us all about the case, over and over again, reminding us of what happened to Rodney King a couple of years ago. Amid baseball and birds and bees, a jury is sequestered somewhere in L.A., thinking about King and Officers Koon and Powell and videotape and driving drunk and Black and White. And that jury cannot help thinking about the riots. The National Guard has arrived in South Central, awaiting word from the courthouse. Because if the jury decides that King's civil rights were not violated, then something very frightening will undoubtedly happen. The violence will start all over again. Where were you when you found out that Los Angeles was burning last May? I vividly recollect watching Nightline, seeing buildings burn and people beaten, and I haven't been within 2,000 miles of Los Angeles since Ron and Nancy were in the White House. Were I a juror in this trial, I could not forget those images o violence. What must those jurors, who live in Los Angeles and who saw the riots through the peepholes in their own front doors, think when they know that they will cause violence by making a certain choice? How will their decision-making be affected by that knowledge? How should it be affected? Throughout the King trials, this country has shown itself to be fundamentally divided along racial lines. If the L.A.P.D. and its officers escape this trial, violence will erupt, and that horrible racial rift will deepen and widen. But by considering the consequences of a decision for the officers, the jurors can make an effort to mend the wound. Even if it were possible, this jury should not remove its decision from the context of violence and hatred which surrounds the entire King ordeal. Some would argue that the American system of justice has survived two hundred years because of a commitment to the sanctity of law, and an idea that all men and women are created equal inside the courtroom. But that image of our system is a pipe dream. How long have the Rodney Kings world been less equal in the courtroom than the Koons and Powells? How much have the jurors thought about the consequences of their actions? And how many springs have been tainted by the odor of hatred?

WORLD 


SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -The country's human rights situation has improved under a 1991 peace accord, but grave violations continue, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.The report by the U.N. observer mission, based on complaints received over an eight-month period, indicated that torture and kidnappings have stopped, but that murders continue.. Last month, a U.N.-sponsored panel blamed security forces for most of the human rights abuses during the 12-year civil war between leftist rebels and the government. 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa Nelson Mandela appealed to white and black leaders Tuesday to agree on quick multiracial elections as a way to end political violence like the assassination of Communist chief Chris Hani..Scattered unrest in a few black townships since Hani's slaying Saturday appeared to subside. But fear remained that blacks would vent their rage during a one-day protest strike and memorial services throughout the country Wednesday.

INDIANA Students decide prayer issue 
GOSHEN, Ind. -High school seniors can decide for themselves if they want to have prayer at their June 5 graduation, the school board said.The board's regular attorney, William Davis Jr., is a member of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, which has threatened schools across the state with legal action if prayer is permitted at gradua­tions.The board agreed to draft a policy statement to handle the issue. A preliminary version stipulates that the decision whether to have prayer at the graduation must be made by students and that any prayers must be "non­sectarian and non-proselytizing."

With none of the emotional debate delivered during previous action, the Senate voted 39-11 in sending the bill to Gov.

classes and they feel that this authority should be left up to the professors," said David Ste­fanic, visiting assistant profes­sor of history. 
"Personally, I do not have a problem with the plan because the request is completely rea­sonable," he said. "Introducing new material and testing stu­dents at that time is fool-hearty and it is asking too much from the students." 
Lecturer of Sociology, An­thropology and Social Work, Henry Borne, also agreed with the decision to try this proposal rather than study days. 
"Because of the snow day this year material to cover is al­ready backed up. Taking two more days off as study days would make it impossible to cover all the needed material," he said. "Besides, a review class period would be more beneficial to students than hav­ing no class at all. A summary day would make it easier for students to reach professors with questions concerning the final." 
"The proposal also makes it easier on professors with grading," he said. "The less that we have backed up, the more time that we can spend answering student's questions." 
Student reactions to the new proposal are mixed. 
"It is a great idea in concept, but I know very few professors who are giving tests that week anyway," said Le Mans Hall junior Shannon Schwarz. "It really is not much of a sacrifice for faculty. But, this term I am taking classes both at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame and as much as the Notre Dame study days are a luxury, I still like having class at Saint Mary's and having the opportunity to review for the exam," 
"I am very much in favor of not having tests the week be­fore exams especially since it relieves a lot of pressure and the professors have already planned the courses," said Holy Cross freshman Bridgette Far­rell. "I also feel that mandatory review sessions would be an­other good idea to consider." 
Wilkinson said that she hopes that this plan will continue and that it will change from a pro­bationary plan into a written policy for next year.

Committee member Ryan Montoya, a freshman from Alumni Hall, said that this ap· letter from the committee, -said that the workshop format was helpful because it "allowed for

Umhofer said that meeting in

"No one had impractical

Umhofer said that the com­mittee is composed of a diverse group of students, including students from different colleges, academic years and races. 
Committee members were chosen based on recommenda­tions from rectors for students who are especially concerned about the role of students at Notre Dame, according to Umhofer.

EDINBURG, Texas (AP} ­Jury selection got under way today in the manslaughter trial of a man whose truck slammed into a school bus in 1989, forcing it into a water-filled pit and killing 21 students. 
Ruben Perez, 28, was ac· cused of running a stop sign at Alton in a soft drink delivery truck. He said his brakes failed, but authorities said he was careless. 
Nineteen junior and senior high school students drowned and two others died later. Perez faces 21 counts of involuntary manslaughter. Each count carries a two-to 10-year prison sentence upon conviction. 
In a pretrial conference this morning, Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra complained that the defense subpoenaed 50 new people as potential witnesses a few minutes before the close of business hours Monday. 
Among the additional names are attorneys involved in civil litigation stemming from the accident. 
"He bad 3 1/2 years to get reasonable subpoenas and bring them to the attention of the court," Guerra said during the conference. 
However, Judge Fidencio Guerra Jr. allowed the addi­tional names, saying that just because they are subpoenaed does not mean they will be called to testify. "The record will reflect what's abuse of the system and what's not," he said. 
The judge said he intends to narrow the pool of 200 potential jurors down to about 100 today, with jury selection expected to last through Wednesday. 
The trial is expected to last at least two weeks. x >i~. The defense and prosecution will question potential jurors about extensive news coverage of the case, which has generated dozens of bittpf lawsuits and multi:riiilUon~< dollar settlements.s:;:> ·· ,.

·except the process dictated by the essentially quantitative standards of that establishment, it is not surprising that a result is the deterioration and depersonalization of the undergraduate experience. This is so with respect to the quality and availability of courses, but also in more incidental but important respects. 
Parking is more remote and dangerous. About 2/3 of the intramural athletic fields have disappeared to provide room for buildings. Architecture, incidentally, reflects the spirit.

When Fr. Malloy met with the CALL students, "The only thing they asked of me," he said, "was to pray at a location where abortions are being performed. I gave them no commitment."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Students react to claims of 'stagnation' 
European developments need examination, action 


without response to even the most heinous of Serbian actions! UN troops were not even allowed to respond with force when Bosnia's vice­president was pulled from a 
U.N. vehicle and shot point­blank. 
When we have allowed Radovan Karadzic and Slobodan Milosevic to get away with actions like these without the slightest credible deterrence, and permitted them to cow us into silence with their every petty threat, it is hardly surprising that they have continued their assault, however limited their original territorial goals may have been. 
It is very likely that Serbia began its war on its neighbors with quite specific objectives, but then discovered how easy victory came. Having met with no European armed resistance, the Serbian militias' bloodlust has expanded exponentially in an ecstatic enthusiasm for ever greater conqUest with no end in view. 
This is how it has always been. People make war out of overconfidence. After years of propaganda, American Southerners really believed that the South was sure to beat the North, despite the fact that the North had twice as many people and most of the industry. And once begun, unchecked success in war breeds even more overconfidence. Hitler. for instance, found that he could take the Rhineland, Czechoslovakia, and more, with impunity. Why not Poland, then? This is the disease that explains current Serbian actions. 
But we never learn the lesson of history. If the European Union had taken a stand and made even modest moves against Serbia when she invaded Croatia, such as bombing Serbian military bases, Serbia would probably never have even gotten to the point of all-out war on Bosnia. Lord Owen would then be in a position to negotiate. As it is, he might as well change his name to Neville Chamberlain. 
To ease their conscience, European governments talk of holding Serbian leaders accountable at war crimes trials. After it's all over, that is. But trials will not bring back the thousands of slaughtered Bosnians, or give them back their broken homes and shattered lands. How dare European leaders make hollow speeches about reactions after the fact?! 
So I have a favor to ask of Mr. Partridge and Mr. McDonald in Innsbruck. Please pass along the following message from me to the peoples of western Europe: Since you seem not to have realized, the responsibility for stopping Serbia is first and foremost a European responsibility. 
Although America's history is far from perfect, if genocidal warfare on this scale occurred in our backyard in 1993, the United States would not stand for it. Has inertia and moral bankruptcy got such a deathgrip on you that your nations are incapable of taking proactive initiatives? 
What would Serbian fascists have to do to get you and your governments to respond with real force? Is there any crime they have not committed, any monstrous act against humanity, which you would be unable to ignore? 
Perhaps if they skewered Moslem babies on spikes and paraded them through the streets of Belgrade, would that be sufficient? Or is there nothing Serbians can do, short of attacking you and endangering your own self­interest, that would force you to say: "enough?." 
If so, then the democracies of Western Europe stand for absolutely nothing but market capitalism, and are not fit to hold a place among civilized nations. This is not a conclusion I can believe; it cannot be the truth for a continent that knew Willie Brandt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill. But after two years of European paralysis before the Yugoslavian horror, it grows harder to avoid that judgment every day. 
John Davenport Graduate Student April 6, 1993 
Dear Editor: 
My thanks to William Partridge and McDonald for their comments from lnnsbruck: they ask us to forget more parochial concerns and consider European issues of enormous importance. I sympathize with their current perspective, because I grew up in Europe and often have European problems and questions on mind. 
But today when I think of the developed, strong democracies of Western Europe (including Switzerland with all of its mountain hordes of arms) I am filled with disgust and outrage beyond description. Helpless on this side of the Atlantic, I feel that I am watching the corruption of the very spirit of Europe-a corruption that comes inevitably from doing nothing to stop Serbia and its nationals in their endless onslaught and slaughter in Bosnia-Herzogovenia. 
Over one-hundred and thirty years ago, people in "these United States" (as they were called then) had to face the ultimate question of identity; they had to decide what our nation would mean in world history, what our country would stand for. To purify America from the rotting corruption we had allowed into our nation's very foundations, we fought our Civil War. 
But today in Europe, by default, Europeans have turned the other way; they are letting the rot of tribal hatred and racism infect their identities. At the very moment when European peoples should be ready to take all their rich heritages, histories, languages and cultures, and give them new life in a European Union devoted in its very genesis to the causes of democracy and justice, they are turning inward, trying to hide in mauvaise foi and believe that not responding to the evil in Yugoslavia won't affect them. 
But they are wrong. Why should western Europeans be surprised that right extremists and ethnic nationalists are gaining strength every day in their own nations, when their governments take no serious military steps to stop the most flagrant and open example of racist triumph in Europe since the Nazi holocaust?! Young militants and others with a tribal mentality learn the lesson: racist violence pays. and can succeed totally unchallenged. If your neighbor is dying of a highly infectious disease and you do nothing to cure him, it should be no shock when you contract the same illness. 
For Europe, the question of Bosnia-Herzogovenia is not just one political question among others. It is a question of to be or not to be. So far, European governments have stood by and permitted Serbian forces to slaughter tens of thousands of Croatians and Bosnians, to drive people out of their homes, put them in death camps and shoot hundreds of them at a time Nazi-style. We have stood idly by while these fascists raped thousands of Moslem women in their time off-duty from "ethnic cleansing." 
In response, European governments have done nothing but send token humanitarian relief, without even giving their aid workers the defense they need to get food convoys to their destination or rescue the shattered remains of Moslem villages. The spinelessness of efforts in Yugoslavia is an international disgrace of unmeasurable dimensions: we have backed down at every Serbian threat, and given in 

Problems more immediate to campus are issues at ND 

Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the letter written by Mr. Pa­tridge and Mr. McDonald (April 6,1993), who are currently studying in Austria, concerning the "intellectual stagnation" they have witnessed at Notre Dame. 
I, too, feel that Notre Dame students continually find them­selves confronting the same is­sues over and over again. And I wish, like Mr. Patridge and Mr. McDonald, that the students could have the opportunity to move beyond them. 
However, I do not feel that by discussing European issues, our problems will be solved. These two students do not propose a productive solution at all but rather only an empty rec­ommendation stemming from their growing European atti­tude: their proposal insinuates that European issues are somehow more important for us to discuss than the issues which affect us directly. 
Mr. Partridge and Mr. Mc­Donald are missing the essen­tial point of the argument: in order to move beyond these lo­cal, "mundane" issues to dis­cuss more global controversies, the "trivial" problems them·
1-------..1.1•--...,;--=--selves must be solved. Glossing 
over these very real problems to discuss more worldly debates solves nothing. 

I don't know how many arti­cles I have read mentioning the need to establish co-ed housing, to abolish parietals, or to establish equality between the sexes. I am always glad to see these concerns, but without concrete action these concerns will continually return as com­plaints and nothing more. 
We need to mobilize ourselves to obtain results. We need to realize that we as students are capable of change. This is our university after all. And obtaining the results is possible. For instance, in one of my classes, we discussed a perennial favorite: the need for co-ed housing. And we actually came up with some possible means to a solution. Besides the popular but rarely successful idea of petitions, we discussed the viable possibility of having organized sit-ins with men in women's 24-hour lounges and vice versa and of trial "floor swapping" between two dorms such as P.E. and Grace. 
I realize that these are only a few possibilities, but these were generated by only a few people in one class. Think of the po­tential solutions that could be developed by the majority of the student body. And think of the impact on the University if only a quarter of the students participated in these proposed solutions, let alone over half. 
It is so much easier to com­plain about an existing problem than to actually attempt to solve it. I would like to challenge stu­dents who really believe in the causes that they so often dis­cuss. to create some form of concrete action. And I further invite anyone interested to call on me for assistance. Because if we aren't fmding the results in the Administration, let us find the results within as we empower ourselves. 
And so, Mr. Partridge and Mr. McDonald, I don't believe that you should condemn your fellow classmates for their "intellectual stagnation." I think that you should be glad that they care about these stagnant problems, and you should en­courage them to solve them or even aid in the solution. 
But it seems that instead of proposing any change at Notre Dame, you suggest running away from the problems by stating, "Open your mind. Notre Dame is not the only way to live; if you are not happy with it, try something else." What an easy response and a cop-out. Attitudes like this will not promote the kind of change you seem to desire; rather they will eliminate any possibility of change. 
I would also like to point out that many of the issues that you believe Notre Dame should be discussing revolve exclusively around Europe and the Euro­pean community. During my year in Angers, France, I found most of my concerns were also European related. Do you notice a connection? People tend to discuss the problems which are most immediate to them. And so, while you discuss Eastern Europe's reformation in Europe, we continue to discuss Notre Dame issues at Notre Dame. 
In conclusion, as long as there are people out there like you who believe that these re­curring issues-such as the inequality between men and women at Notre Dame-are "trivial." this current trend of complaining with no concrete action will continue. And the problems will never be solved 
Thanks for your Eurocentric suggestions. In the meantime, I will continue my "mundane" life eating a chicken patty as you enjoy your two week vacation in Greece.

Homebased program helps autistic child

Straight Outta 'Waka 
Fear of a Cow Planet 

F 
ood, Folks & Fun. Run for the 
Border. The new flame-broiled 
meatloaf sandwich. WHOPPER, 
WHOPPER, WHOPPER!" Oh, the cow 
sleeps restlessly tonight. The jingles 

play in her head, again and again. Her moos call out to an unfriendly world. She tries not to wake her calf, who sleeps peacefully, dreaming of open fields and salt licks. Yet, she cannot help but think of her role in the fast food industry, and wonder if some smart ass will tip her over in the middle of the night. 
Have you ever heard a cow cry? I have. As a child, I dreamt that cows were looking in my window. My dad actually had to go outside and simulate shotgun noises to kill the imaginary cows. Yet, looking back, I can see that my dreams were an early foreshadowing of my role as a "messiah of cattle". 
The road that led to a love for the bovine be­gan in high school. During junior year, I had this friend named Shlomi. I called him Homie, and together we decided that we should start a club. We settled on the "Chinchilla Petting Club" 
and planned to bring a chinchilla to school on Tuesdays so that the club members could pet it. One of our friends volunteered to keep the chin­chilla in his car, and we began calling pet stores to find one of these "furry rodents of the Andes." Unfortunately, our petitioning for the club failed. We shed a few tears, but made a solemn vow to start a club during our senior year. 
Well, senior year nearly passed us by before we felt inspired to start the quest. Sitting in class, Homie slipped me a little note. On the front was a photocopy of a cow head, and on the back he wrote, "Join the cow protection club now." Sparked with an idea whose time had come, we petitioned with reckless abandon across the campus. I worked diligently on a "Cowmunist Manifesto," and after I gave an electrifying speech about cattle to the student government, we became official. We held our first meeting on April 21, 1992, and on that day the "Cow Protection Society" (C.P.S.) was born. 
We looked like a real club. We had a pledge, a handshake, a t-shirt, and most importantly, a bureaucracy. Homie assumed the role of President, while I became a vice president, and "Minister of Propaganda." The other vice president was named Chris, and his title was "Minister of Defense." Together, Chris and I kept the club from becoming a ruthless dictatorship while the President united both the militaristic and pacifist sides of the club. Every member had an office, and this could range from "Secretary of Grooming" to "Secret Agent." The secret agents reported directly to the "Commander of the Cow Vengeance Squad." 
Under "Operation: Sleeping Cow," the agents, along with troops, made sure that cow tipping was eradicated, and cow tippers prosecuted. The "Secretary of Parasitic Patrol" made sure that all the cows in the Bay Area (that's in Cowlifornia, for all of you ignorant people from 'Sconsin.) were free from lice, fleas, and ticks. The "Secretary of Miscellaneous Lactile Fluid­Containing Products" controlled everything that the secretaries of ice cream, cheese, milk, sour cream, and yogurt did not cover. 
The C.P.S. has indeed left its mark on the west 
coast, but in an effort to expand to a national 
level, I can only hope that there are some stu­
dents who will join me in a quest to continue 
education and appreciation for our bovine 
friend. I refuse to believe that the C.P.S. can just 
come into a cow's life like a bad case of 
hookworm and then depart. I dream of the day 
when we will ride cows to DeBartolo, play tag 
on the quad with frisky calves, and be able to 
shout with a mighty voice, "Indiana cattle 
poachers, beware!"

Instantly four-year old Bobby releases a tremendous shriek as he snatches a yellow block from his mother's hand. He palms the block, then hurls it against the wall as he shrieks again. His mother reveals a frustrated expression as the yellow block tumbles to the ground, then suddenly releases a shriek herself The piercing scream surprises Bobby, who stares at her for a few seconds before picking up a blue block.

They made the journey in January 1992 after doctors refused to officially diagnose Bobby with autism despite the fact that by age three-· he did not speak or look at his parents. Further frustrating the Lawtons was the day officials from "Friends" pre-school kicked Bobby out of school because they could not understand his behavior. 
After a week at Option, Bobby was immediately recognized as autistic (though doctors today still refuse to diagnose him as autistic. ) The program takes place in the Lawton household and is based on the Biblical Scripture that adults "must become as little children to enter the Kingdom of God." This is exemplified in Bobby's case as his parents and volunteers attempt to enter his world to encourage him to trust others. 
"Bobby has spent his life building a world for himself," explains Kym, whose father Dick graduated from Notre Dame in 1962. "We mimic everything he does, from shrieking to jumping around. This shows Bobby we're interested in learning about his 
world, and that it's

us."

helping someone live a normal life" he says, "It's a great feeling and 'a truly great activity." 
What makes the program so fulfilling to volunteers is the fact that they've seen Bobby blossom tremendously in only a year's time. His eye-contact has improved dramatically and his vocabulary has increased from about zero words to 20-25 words. Equally important is his increased level of interaction with others, which Kym says has increased 100%. 
The progress has taken place mainly because of the program's atmosphere, which places Bobby in a playroom for 8-10 hours each day. He and his playmate, whether it be his family or a volunteer, spend their time interacting in a room that is almost bare. The emptiness of the room prevents Bobby from running around and grabbing things. Instead, his abundance of toys, which range from Mr. Potato Head to plastic doughnut rings, are all placed on shelves posted high on the wall. This forces Bobby to ask for help when he wants a particular toy. The walls are bare with no prints or hung pictures, which would distract Bobby from focusing on his toys. Likewise, the windows are covered with plexiglass, which prevents him from looking outside. The key thing is to get Bobby to focus. The more he concentrates on how to play and trust his playmate, the more he opens up to all members of the outside world. 
But the key is to teach Bobby his world is an acceptable one that others want to learn about. "We're not necessarily trying to 'save' him, but rather teach him it's great to interact with others, "says Kym. 
This interaction is parlayed into lessons like today's, which focuses on the word "up". Bobby shows his mom that he is tired by taking off his moccasin slippers and reaching in the playroom closet for a blanket. But her presence makes him forget his drowsiness as her praise seems to wash over him like warm water. Each time he says "Up!" for his Sesame Street Ernie doll or stuffed animals, she congratulates him for saying the proper word. When he bangs his head against a huge rubber ball for self-stimulation, she does the exact same th'ing to turn the self­stimulation into a kind of two-person game. 
Does that mean each day is light 
and playful? No way. There are many 
days Bobby refuses to play and bangs 
his fists against the door to serve 
notice that he wants out. But in line 
with the program, Bobby is never told 
"No." Instead he is firmly told that he 
can leave the playroom at a specific 
hour. This is in line with the idea that 
instead of telling him what he CAN'T 
do, he is directed to what he CAN do. 
His progress has been stunning. 
Volunteer Meredith Braver, who is a 
senior Elementary Education major at 
Saint Mary's, has seen this progress. 
As she recounts, "I remember the day 
we were counting little Fisher-Price 
firemen and I started counting 1-2-3. 
Suddenly he starts counting and you 
could see such an intense 
concentration on his face. He's very 
intelligent and has such a magnetic 
personality." 
As Bobby continues to progress, the 
Lawtons realize this will be a crucial 
summer for him. Because many 
volunteers are going home for 
vacation, the. search has begun for 
students who are staying for summer 
school and would like to be a vol­
unteer. Currently, 17 of the 19 
students who work with Bobby are 
females but Kym says it would be 
perfectly fine if the situation was vice­
versa. Ten more volunteers are 
wanted for a job that Kym says the 
current ones are handling beautifully. 
"Every day is a great one with 
Bobby,"says the very loving mom."I 
am living for the day 32 years down 
the tin~ When we can sit and have a 
normal conversation with him. Until 
then, we'll continue to love him and I 
hope we'll have others who will work 
with and love him also."

Wild ride for Irish softball in weekend doubleheaders 

By DOMINIC AMOROSA 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame softball team moved to 18-11 with two doubleheader splits with DePaul and Dayton this weekend. On Saturday, Notre Dame beat DePaul 1-0, and then lost 9-7. In Monday's game, the Irish won 3-0 and then fell 8-7. 
It was a wild weekend for the Irish. Saturday's games fea­tured six hits in the first game and 22 in the second game. Monday's games featured an Irish no-hitter and then an in­credible Dayton comeback. Be­sides that, there were some Notre Dame records. 
Sophomore Andrea Keys hit the first grand slam in Irish history in the second game at DePaul, while freshman Terri Kobata pitched the sixth Notre Dame no-hitter in Monday's first game at Dayton. 
"I was really excited because it was my first no-hitter for Notre Dame," said Kobata. "As soon as we got our runs I was really comfortable. We thought we could dominate, so I wasn't too scared." 
"That was the highlight of the day," said Irish coach Liz Miller. "Getting her healthy is a big factor. Now, we have to keep her healthy." 
It was Kobata's first game since March 31 against Western Michigan. She was sidelined by a calf injury. She has a 6-3 record and ranks tenth in the nation with 8.3 strikeouts per seven innings. 
As for Keys, she was named Midwestern Collegiate Confer­ence player of the week for her performance. Besides the grand slam, she batted .400 with three runs scored and six RBI in the last week. 
"Andrea is really hitting the ball well right now," com­mented coach Miller. "She's playing well defensively too." 
"I came through when it was needed," explained Keys. "The award is a real honor. I'm ex­cited, and hopefully I can con­tinue to have a strong bat." 
At Depaul, senior co-captain Staci Alford limited the Blue Demons to three hits in the first game while improving her record to 5-4. Offensively, junior Stephanie Pinter's RBI single provided the lone run. 
"It was a great ballgame," said Miller. "Staci had them so frustrated because they couldn't do anything." 
"We played really well," said co-captain Ronny Alvarez. "Staci pitched a great ball­game." 
The second game was a com­plete opposite as the teams bat­tered both pitchers. "It felt like a slowpitch game," commented coach Miller. "That's how much of a contrast it was to the first game." 
DePaul jumped out to a 6-0 lead by the third inning. Keys' slam brought the Irish within two at 6-4, but the Blue Demons continued to hit Irish pitching. 
"We came out poorly," said Alvarez. "We fought back, but the beginning killed us." 
"We didn't play well," rea­soned Miller. "It was a frustrat­ing game, because it's not our style of play. However, we didn't lay down and die." 


The Irish committed numer­ous mistakes in the field which allowed DePaul to gain the ad­vantage. "If we didn't throw the ball around so much defensively to give them runs, we could've won the game," said Miller. 
On Monday, Kobata started the Irish out well with her gem. She struck out 11 Bulldogs and walked only one. Offensively, sophomore Sara Hayes had two hits, and Keys had a triple. 1\vo early runs and an insurance run in the sixth inning was all Kobata needed. 
As for the second game Notre Dame wasn't as fortunate. After Dayton scored a run in the first inning, the Irish responded with seven unanswered runs until the bottom half of the seventh inning. Trailing 7-1, Dayton sent 11 batters to the plate and came back to win 8-7.Three 
errors  and  a  passed  ball  
contributed  to  Dayton's  
comeback.  

"I still haven't figured out how or why we lost our lead," realized Miller. "It was the strangest thing I've ever seen. It happened so fast. It was over before we even realized we lost." 
Alford took the loss after re­lieving freshman Kara Bran­denburg with one out in the seventh. "I wasn't even worried, because it came so quickly," said Alford. 
"We just letdown," added Al­varez. 
On the bright side, Notre Dame had 10 hits, including three by Pinter. Junior Christy Connoyer and Hayes had two hits apiece. 
Fortunately for Notre Dame, they have a chance to redeem themselves this week at home. Valparaiso comes to South Bend for a doubleheader this afternoon. 
"We're looking to get some revenge, because we know we blew Monday's second game," said Miller. "This is a big turn­ing point for our team. We're either gonna be a stronger team or we're gonna fall apart." 
"We want to show people how well we're doing," commented Keys. "We want the MCC championship." 
"I have a lot of confidence that we're gonna be stronger because of Monday," added Miller. "We're going to come out and play ball every inning. We'll never relax again and assume we've won a ballgame." 
Valpraiso has split all of their doubleheaders this season. "They'll go home happy if they win one here," concluded Miller. "Our goal is not to let that happen."

The games marked the start of a busy month for the team, but Danapilis sees the schedule as a benefit after the weekend. 
"Playing every day started getting us in the groove," said the right-fielder. "We're coming together as a team by playing every day." 
Today, the Irish meet the Illi­nois team, which spoiled the home opener, in Champaign. A win is critical for the Irish who are still looking to more back into the top-25. Sinnes will start the game on the mound for Notre Dame.

Tentative play hinders Irish lacrosse against Duke 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 
The biggest opportunity of the year presented itself to the Notre Dame lacrosse team last Friday night when they traveled to Durham, N.C. to face off against No. 9 Duke. Unfortu­nately for the Irish, they did not produce the type of game they are capable of, and fell to the Blue Devils 13-7. 
As a result of the loss, the 
Irish dropped four spots in the latest United States Intercolle­giate Lacrosse Association's coaches' poll, landing in the 16th slot. 
The Irish didn't play with the same amount of aggressiveness that they've shown in previous victories. 
"We came out and played ten­tatively which isn't characteris­tic for us," coach Kevin Corri­gan said. "I was confident we'd come out and play well, but we

have no excuses, we just didn't play our game." 
The Blue Devils came right out and jumped on the Irish for two quick goals before Notre Dame could regroup and tie the game at 2-2. The Irish stayed close in the first quarter and after the first 15 minutes were tied at 3-3. 
But in the second quarter, Duke's aggressive play became evident as junior attacker Ken Fasanaro, who led Duke with four goals, scored to push the Blue Devils to a 6-4 lead at half­time. 
The key statistic of the game was ground balls, with Duke dominating 69-42. This was important because Duke kept up the pressure on the Notre Dame defense and kept the ball in the Irish zone for a large majority of the game. 
"Duke really dominated ground balls which was an indication of their aggressive-

ness which led to limited pos­sessions for our offense and pressured us to score every time we had the ball," noted Corrigan. 
Duke continued their control of the game behind strong midfield play, and stretched their lead to 9-5 after three pe­riods. But even though the Irish were not at the top of their game, they refused to give up. 
With ten minutes left in the game, Notre Dame was only down 9-6, and had several chances to tighten the contest. But Duke never let the Irish get into a settled offensive pattern, and finished the game with 4-1 run that produced the final score. 
On offense, Notre Dame was led by freshman attacker Kevin Mahoney and junior attacker Randy Colley, who both tallied two goals, while junior mid­fielder Willie Sutton assisted on two goals in the loss. 
Defensively, sophomore goalie Ryan Jewell had 22 saves against an unsettled Duke attack whose midfielders produced numerous scoring opportunities for their attack­ers. 
Notre Dame's effort, however, was not all bad news for Corrigan. 
We know we can stay competi­tive and find ways to keep it close and win even though we're not playing well," he said. 
The season, however, does not end for the Irish with this loss. They still have four im­portant games left against Midwest region foes that will determine whether Notre Dame can win the region's bid to the NCAA tournament.

Malik makes his move 
Russell on the way out, White on the way in 
By JASON KELLY 
Associate Sports Editor 
When Malik Russell was a high school senior, former Vanderbilt coach Eddie Fogler was among the coaches inter­ested in his services. 
Two years later, it appears that he finally got him. 
Russell's transfer request has been approved by the University, and he is expected to attend South Carolina, where Fogler recently accepted the head coaching position. 
Speculation has swirled for months that Russell may leave Notre Dame amid reports of conflicts with head coach John MacLeod. 
Russell played in 24 games this season before MacLeod suspended him for the final three games because of academic problems. 
While he was in the lineup, Hussell led the Irish with 54 assists and 20 blocked shots. But he was also leading in missed busses and dress code violations, and his attitude was reportedly a problem for MacLeod. 
Russell, who is finishing the semester 
at Notre Dame, was unavailable for comment. It didn't take long for the Irish to find someone to fill Russell's roster spot. 
Admore White, a 6-2 point guard from Lauderdale Lakes, Fla. verbally committed to Notre Dame after a visit last weekend. He is expected to make it official by signing a national letter of intent this week. 
Overlooked for much of his high school career, White scored 21.6 points and dished out 11.2 assists per game as a senior, leading his team to a 28-2 season. He collected 54 three-point goals during the season, and had 28 assists in one game. 
"He was overshadowed the last two years," White's high school coach Mike Bananti told the South Bend Tribune. "lie wanted to use his ability this season to gain some recognition." 
His ability attracted some big name schools, including Purdue, Boston College and Stanford. But it was Notre Dame that attracted his attention. 
"Notre Dame showed sincere interest and he likes the whole package at Notre Dame," Benanti said. 

Seniors pace baseball in weekend sweep 

By JENNY MARTEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Easter Bunny visited Coveleski Stadium this weekend and left some eggs for LaSalle and Cleveland State. Goose eggs that is. Both the Explorers and the Vikings went winless in their respective series with the Notre Dame baseball team (17­8). 
The Irish swept LaSalle in a four game series (4-3, 20-0, 6­2, 8-3) over the weekend and took a doubleheader from Cleveland State (8-3, 11-5) on Monday evening. 
The seniors led the way as Eric Danapilis, Eddie Hartwell and Chris Michalak all made their mark over the six-game weekend. Michalak (5-2, 4. 70) threw a one-hitter on Saturday blanking the Explorers in a 20­0win. 
Danapilis and Hartwell con­tributed their bats to the Irish effort with the seniors hitting .480 and .404 respectively over the weekend. In the last seven games which have all been wins for the Notre Dame team, Danapilis is 13-22 while Hartwell is 14-27. 
Notre Dame coach Pat Mur­phy is pleased with the perfor­mances of the pair of power hitters. 
"Those two are carrying us," said Murphy. "They're such a key." 
Also carrying the team is the pitching staff including Micha­lak. Over the weekend, David Sinnes, A.J. Jones, Tom Price and Marty DeGraff notched wins with strong performances. 
"We won six straight," said Murphy. ''I'll take it. We're getting better, but we still have a long way to go. Defense is suspect. We're hitting and pitching well...We're using a lot of pitchers. Price, DeGraff, Sinnes and Jones have been really tough." 


Errors were a problem over the weekend with the Irish booting the ball 11 times in the six games. 
"Our pitchers pitched well, but we didn't back them up," said Hartwell. "The defense has to relax." 
The Irish opened the weekend on Friday with a 4-3 win over LaSalle with Robby Birk scoring the winning run in the bottom of the eighth. 
Birk scored on one of Hartwell's four hits of the day in that inning, but also helped the Irish jump out to a lead with an RBI single in the fourth to drive in Danapilis. 

Notre Dame picked up two runs in the sixth when Paul Failla and Hartwell hit back-to­hack RBI singles before LaSalle tied things up in the top of the eighth with three runs. 
Sinnes (3-1, 4.45) picked up the win for the Irish with a near-complete game. The right­hander was on the mound eight innings allowing three runs on two hits while striking out 10. Michalak got the save with two strikeouts in the ninth. 
In the first game of Satur­day's doubleheader, Michalak baffled the Explorers with a one-hit shutout performance while the Irish bats came alive for the 20-0 win. 
Michalak struck out seven and walked just two in the nine­inning complete game while Danapilis (2 for 5, 5 RBI}, Lisanti (2 for 4, 4 RBI) and Haas (2 for 3, 3 RBI) paced the Irish at the plate. 
Danapilis gave the Irish more than they would need with a three-run home run in the third and a two-run single in the sixth while Bob Lisanti added a three-run double. 
Saturday's second game saw the Irish win 6-3 thanks to a four-run fifth inning. 
Failla and Danapilis had run­scoring singles in the inning to give Jones the win after the freshmen held LaSalle to one­hit in his three innings of relief work. Tim Kraus, the starter, went four-plus innings allowing two runs on six hits. 
Hartwell (2 for 4) scored in the first, but the Explorers took the lead with a two-run second inning. The Irish also scored a single run in the sixth when Birk's sacrifice fly brought Rowan Richards across the plate. 
In the final game of the series, the Irish defeated Midwestern Collegiate Conference rival LaSalle 8-3 as Price was complete once again going a full seven innings on the mound scattering three runs and nine hits. 
The Explorers picked up sin­gle runs in the second, third and fifth innings while the Irish notched that many in just the second. 
Danapilis slammed a solo homer which Topham followed with a double and DeSensi fin­ished things off with a two-run roundtripper in the inning. De­Sensi also scored in the fourth for the winning run. Insurance

Men's tennis devours competition 

By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
In a traditional weekend for excess consumption and mirth. the eighth-ranked Notre Dame men's tennis team devoured more opponents than they did chocolate, licking their chops on the rest of the MCC conference and Midwest foes Wisconsin and Iowa. 
It all started on Friday, as the Irish hosted the MCC Champi­onships, an event they have dominated since their return to the conference in 1989. This year's tournament was no dif­ferent, as the Irish captured eight out of the nine flights to capture their fifth-straight con­ference championship. 
There was, however, one upset in the meet, as Evansville's Adam King de­feated the Irish's usual five­singles player, junior Todd Wil­son, 6-4, 6-2 to win the No. 1 singles flight. It was the first time in five years that a non­Notre Dame player won an MCC singles flight. 
And despite the fact that the Irish won the rest of the singles flights and the three doubles flights with a combination of freshmen and juniors who have only seen limited action this season, Butler's Charles Daus was named the MCC coach of the year, snapping Irish coach Bob Bayliss' !'our-year string. Butler finished second in the meet with 56 points, 23 points behind the Irish. 
Freshman Mike Sprouse and junior Eoin Beirne won their first conference singles crowns with
