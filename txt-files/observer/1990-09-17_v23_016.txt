Animal rights group protests Circus Flora 
By RENEE YOUNG 
News Writer 
Members of a local animal rights group staged a protest last Friday against Circus Flora, a group which recently performed on Washington Street in South Bend. 
The protesting group, or the Coalition of Hoosiers Encouraging the Ethical Treatment of Animals, (CHEETA) hoped to encourage education on the issue of animal cruelty. CHEETA members passed out literature to circus-goers regarding what they described as the horrible treatment animals receive in training. The CHEETA organi­zation admitted that the Circus Flora treats its animals better 
than many other animal shows, but they are still caging wild

Bush calls Iraqis 'isolated'; U.N. weighs new sanctions 
(AP)-As theUnited Nations weighed new sanctions against Baghdad, Iraqi television broadcast a statement by President Bush Sunday in which he warned the Iraqi people that their leader's brinkmanship could plunge them into war "against the world." 
Hours later, thousands of men, women and children marched through the streets of Baghdad, chanting "Death to Bush, Death to America!" 
An official Iraqi response to Bush's statement called it full of "lies and contradictions," and said the U.S. president aimed to be the "dictator of the world." 
Meanwhile, hundreds of Kuwaitis continued to flood into Saudi Arabia Sunday after Iraqi troops opened a border crossing over the weekend, and Kuwait's government-in-exile accused 
Iraq of depopulating the country to resettle Iraqis there. 
The U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned Iraq's raids last week on the French, Belgian, Canadian and Dutch embassy com­pounds in Kuwait, and warned that further sanctions against Baghdad were likely. 
Diplomats also began drafting language for a new resolution to close off Iraq's air routes and punish nations flouting the trade embargo, 
U.S. officials said. 
Bush's address to the Iraqi people, with an Arabic voice­over and captions provided by the State Department, apparently was broadcast in its entirety Sunday evening. 
"Iraq finds itself on the brink of war," Bush said. But "war is not inevitable. It is still possible to bring this crisis to a peaceful end." 


President Bush 

"Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world," said Bush, standing in front of his desk with the American flag behind him. 
The eight-minute speech was followed immediately by a 25-minute response from an Iraqi TV announcer. 

Efforts to recruit and keep minority grad students aided by new director 
By SARAH VOIGT 
News Writer 
Errol Lawrence, the newly appointed assistant director of Graduate Schools, plans to use his expertise to help recruit and retain minority students. 
The scarcity of minority students on campus is a serious problem, according to Barbara Turpin, director of Graduate Admissions. 
"Compared to the minority enrollment of other graduate schools, we don't stack up very well," she explained. "We only have one new black student this year." There are about 1,500 students in the graduate program. 
"Part of the problem is that we've had no coherent plan in the past," Turpin said. "Dr. Lawrence's experience creating recruitment plans for other colleges by assessing minority enrollment and making recommendations will make him a valuable addition to the staff." 

Before beginning at Notre Dame, Lawrence worked for a year as an access and retention specialist for Lilly, Lopez and Associates, an independent consulting firm in Princeton, New Jersey. 
"Because I've developed specific techniques in the recruitment and subsequent retention of minority students, I have some ideas about what will attract them to Notre Dame," Lawrence said. 
Lawrence said that many qualified minority students do not consider Notre Dame graduate school simply because they have never been exposed to the school. 
"Notre Dame does not stand out in the black community as it does in the white community," said Lawrence. "There are very few black alumni out there." 
As an initial phase of his minority recruitment plan, Lawrence will introduce Notre Dame's graduate programs to the minority populations at other universities. "We [the members of the Graduate Admissions Staffi will meet with the director of Minority Affairs, and black and white faculty members at other schools who counsel students about graduate schools. " 
Lawrence emphasized that once minorities submit their applications, they must meet the same admissions requirements as non-minorities. Lawrence's responsibilities, however, by no means end with the minority student's acceptance into the

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), located in Indianapolis. Its purpose is to stop animal abuse in the area. 
One of PETA's main targets is factory farming, in which animals are raised strictly for profit. One example of factory farming is the raising of chickens. According to Lia Klinkhamer, CHEETA member and coordinator of Saint Mary's Language Learning Center, nine or more chickens are shoved into small coops where they spend their entire lives. 
These coops are stacked on top of each other so that droppings fall on the coops below, said Klinkhamer. When the farmers decide to kill the chickens, the animals' legs must be cut off, because their feet have grown into the wire

A "thundering rage" is building against the United States in the Arab world, and a showdown in the Gulf would end "in a catastrophe" for U.S. forces, said announcer Mikdad Morad, who usually reads statements from President Saddam Hussein. 
A group of a few hundred men later began marching in Baghdad. As they passed through residential neighborhoods, thousands of men, women and children joined them. 
Raising their clenched fists in the air, the demonstrators denounced Bush and also President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, whom they called "traitors of the Arab world" for backing the U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf. 
The U.N. resolution Sunday, along with actions by the Italian and Soviet governments, appeared to confirm a growing solidarity in opposition to Saddam, whose forces overran Kuwait Aug. 2. 
The resolution followed Friday's raids by Iraqi troops on the diplomatic compounds in Kuwait. 
Two Tunisian newspapers reported Sunday that Iraqi troops had entered the Tunisian Embassy in Kuwait as well. In Bangladesh, the Bengali-language newspaper lttefaq said soldiers stormed the residences of two embassy officials Friday. 
France retaliated for the raid on its property by expelling 26 Iraqi military and civilian trainees and three Iraqi students suspected of being secret agents. They left the country Sunday night under police escort on an Air France flight to Amman, Jordan.

Frosh football fans show true NO spirit 
Aftor a. lot of com­plaining about who should get tickets and where students should sit at Notre Dame games, the first home game arrived. One group of fans 

stood out from the Corinne Pavlis rest. It wasn't Notre 
Dame or Saint Mary's Saint Mary's Editor students per se, but rather the freshman classes of both schools. As a senior. I finally had the chance to sit in the coveted senior section. I have never been to a ND game I didn't like. I guess I figured it could only get better now that my friends and I were in sections 28 and 29. I was wrong. The senior section was not all I had dreamed it would be. Granted there were three times as many people as there should have been due to every girlfriend, boyfriend, brother, sister, friend from home, and alum who talked a student into getting them into the student section; but that wasn't the real problem. What bugged me most was the re­allY bad attitude disnlayed by the students and fans. During the National Anthem fans were swearing at one another about being in the wrong seats. I could not believe how pushy and rude everyone was. Friends and room­mates turned on one another. I could not help but look over at the freshmen section. Even though they were basically in the end zone they were really having a good time. I think the freshmen had much more spirit and a much better attitude about the game. An impressive percentage of them were wearing green shirts. I felt like I was root­ing for the wrong school wearing green in our section. I even caught them making at­tempts at starting a "wave." When I was a freshman I remember we would shout "we are" to the other side -of the stadium to which they would respond "NO". The sound was deafening. We made the cheerleaders' job easy for them. Also, we were nice to each other. We didn't care how smashed together we were. We just were glad to be together watching Tim Brown run back another kick off into the end zone. We shook our keys on third down and other "key" plays. We started waves that would travel around the stadium. After every touchdown we would high five and embrace our neighbors, not swear at them. I know I probably sound like a parent telling one of those "I remember when I wn." n. kt<l-~ype :norle,, bu~ I o::;a.n·~ help u. I paid three years worth of dues to sit where I did on Saturday and I don't want my ef­forts to have been in vain. Things got so bad for this Irish fan that I chose to head home and catch the fourth quarter on T.V. I didn't have 59,074 fans around me to share the excitement with, but I did have a cold keg and a couple of good friends. On September 29, I hope everyone takes heed of the example the freshmen set for us on Saturday . They were true Irish ns.

Committee aims to improve male/female relationships 
By ALICIA REALE 
News Writer 
Improvement of undergradu­ate male-female relationships is one of the main goals of The Year of Women, according to Eileen Kolman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies and Chair of the Year of Women Committee. 
Kolman gave a 20-minute talk Friday, explaining what the Year of Women means to the Notre Dame community and outlining the committee's goals for the upcoming year. 
The 1990-91 theme was de­cided upon by University President Father Edward Malloy. This focus is on the changing roles of women in so­ciety today. The primary audi­ence is the entire Notre Dame student body -not solely the female members. 
The committee has several goals which it hopes the Year of Women will accomplish at ND. The first is to improve re­lationships between under­graduate males and females. 
Kolman explained that an undergraduate woman will need to make future choices in order to balance marriage, a career and a family. A male does not have to worry about a family infringing upon his life, according to Kolman. 
MICHIGAN STATE TICKET LOTTERY

WHERE:  STEPAN CENTER  

You must bring Student ID and you may bring only ONE other. 100 winners may buy 2 tickets on Thurs., Sept. 20 4 pm -6 pm at Stepan. Winners will be printed in the Observer on Thursday. 
Kolman said that another goal is to focus on scholarships and research of special interest to women. The Gender Studies concentration at ND also offers an excellent opportunity for both men and women to further their understanding of the sexes. 
The committee's final goal is to "heighten awareness of what it is like to be a woman at ND , " Kolman said. After 130 years of strong male tradition the 37 percent female population is still experiencing inequalities. 
There should be more aware­ness between the sexes, said Kolman. 
Women with achievements will be spotlighted this year. Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in the 1984 election, will kick off the Student Government sponsored lecture series on Wednesday at the Fieldhouse Mall. There are also future hopes for a female commencement speaker. 
According to Kolman, this is exemplified in many aspects of life at ND: 
In 
the classroom, only 12 percent of the faculty is com­prised of women. 

In 
many departments there are no women at all. 

In 
one line of the Irish fight song, "while her loyal sons are marching onward to victory," a male bias exists. 

At 
every Sunday mass, Catholics recite the "Our Father." 


Many educational events have been planned for the month of September, including the Emma Goldman Exhibit in the Hesburgh Library Concourse. Also, a magazine celebrating women's talents is being ar­ranged by the Rector and a Resident Assistant in Pas­querilla West. 



Recyclin' Irish expand 
By MARK CAWLEY 
News Writer 
The Notre Dame campus 
produces close to 50,000 
pounds of aluminum cans 
and about 250,000 pounds 
of newspaper per year. 
Because of this, Recyclin' 
Irish, a student-run orga­
nization devoted to recycling, 
is taking an active role in 
giving the University's trash 
a second chance. 
Recylin' Irish recently 
decided to expand its 
program to include the 
community surrounding 
Notre Dame. At a press 
conference last weekend, 
senior Paul Ruesch an­
nounced the opening of the 
University's first Recycling 
Drop-Off Center, which is 

located behind the Alumni­
Senior Club. 
The Alumni Association 

provided space and publicity 
for the center. "Since it is a 
student sponsored activity, 
we would like to be in­
volved," said Charles Lennon, 
executive director of the 
Alumni Association. 
"The success of this new 

program is due in a large 
part to the Alumni 
Association," Ruesch said. 
The center is designed for use by the entire community. "Just because it is a student­run activity and because it is on the Notre Dame campus does not preclude the local community." Lennon said. 
The large recycling "boat" in the rear parking lot of the club was provided by Superior Waste Systems. This company also collects the waste material and transports it to its recycling facility in Chicago. "We began this program with Notre Dame primarily due to the severe shortage of 
landfill space," said Linda Spear, a representative of Superior Waste Systems. 
"The company hopes that this recycling program with Notre Dame will start a precedent in the surrounding community," she added. 
Last fall the Environmental Action Club helped initiate the campus-wide recycling program. A new organization, Recyclin' Irish, was created at that time expressly to support and expand the program. 
A highly organized residence hall recycling system has been established under the leadership of Ruesch. Each dormitory has a representative who works closely with glass, news­paper, and aluminum "commissioners" to coordi­nate recycling within that hall. These individuals and a team of volunteers collect the waste and take it to a central location. 
Ruesch has been pleased with Recylin' Irish's progress. "We've had phenomenal participation," he said. 
Ruesch, a self-proclaimed environmentalist, has future plans for Recyclin' Irish. He hopes to provide receptacles in University offices for recycling office waste paper. He would also like to coordi­nate a program with Food Services to recycle old Ob­server's left in the dining halls. "I am devoted to establishing a comprehensive recycling program," he said.

BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -A tanker carrying about 1 million gallons of gasoline exploded and burned Sunday on the Saginaw River, injuring most of the 18 people aboard and spilling fuel in the water. 
The fire was too hot for fire­fighters to douse, and officials waited for it to burn itself out, said Coast Guard Lt. Tom Koontz. 
One person from the ship was missing, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Gerald Backus. Gov. James Blanchard visited the site and declared the blaze an emergency, supplying state aid and assistance. 
The fire was reported at 
8:45 a.m., while the tanker was unloading at the Total Refinery Dock Facility, and was still burning Sunday evening. 
Authorities warned spectators to clear the area in case of multiple explosions. 
"A few people blew right off the boat and slammed ashore," said Bay City police Officer Kenneth Adcock. "The sky is covered with black smoke. If it blows again, it's going to be a big one." 
Witnesses said the black smoke blocked out the sun throughout the afternoon. 
The tanker, owned by Cleveland Tankers Inc. of Cleveland, was carrying about 20,000 barrels of gasoline or about 1 million gallons, said Koontz. It has a capacity of about 54,000 barrels. 
"That's the estimate. That's a lot of gas," Koontz said. 
The state Department of Natural Resources was conducting water and air pollution tests Sunday to check for environmental contamination, spokeswoman Susan Henry said.

Lawrence explained the vital retention phase of his plan. 
"Since this campus is so predominantly white," said Lawrence, "we need to sensitize minority students before they can make the transition into this new environment. It is especially difficult for those stu­dents who, say, come from pre­dominantly black schools or communities." 
The ND administration has cited the transformation of the Graduate School into a nationally acclaimed research institution as a high priority. Lawrence believes that it is essential to foster a mul­ticultural learning environment if Notre Dame hopes to achieve this goal.

CHEETA is working to eliminate such abuse. There are laws against cruel treatment of animals in coun­tries such as Germany and France, but CHEETA wants laws against animal abuse in the United States. 
In Indiana, where farming is prominent, many people don't want to discuss the subject and simply ignore it, according to Klinkhamer. 
"We know we are up for a hard fight, but we keep on 

because "it's volatile and it evaporates," she said, adding that two booms were strung downstream from the ship to contain any spilled fuel. 
Ronald Stopyak had returned home 15 minutes before the blast from working at the Bay Chemicals Co. directly across the river from the tanker. He said he raced back to work after hearing the explosion. 
"I thought the plant exploded and when I got out there I saw black smoke everywhere," he said. "I saw the employees on the ship go overboard. 
"It was really hot. I could feel the heat from across the river." 
His wife, Cheryl, said that their house was less than two blocks from the explosion and was shaken. 
"It was like a slow rumbling, it got louder and louder like thunder," she said.

multicultural, it is important for Graduate students to interact with students of different backgrounds, races and cul­tures," Lawrence said. "If the students are not exposed to other cultures, they are not being challenged to break down stereotypes created by television," Lawrence said. 
From 1984 to 1989 Lawrence worked as assistant dean of Rider College. At Rider he directed I a State funded Educational Opportunity Program, where he gained experience in the access and retention of disadvantaged stu­dents. 
Turpin expressed confidence in Lawrence's ability to implement his recruitment plans. 
"We have great hopes for him," she said. "He is the type of individual who is easy for students to talk to. I think that he'll do a great job marketing the University." 
trying," said Klink hamer. "Orice people are aware, then they can change their habits and views." 
On the Saint Mary's campus, CHEETA is sponsored by the Women for the Environment Club. Through this group, CHEETA will educate the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community on future animal issues and protests. 
CHEETA invites all interested students to come to meetings on the first Thursday of every month in the Francis Branch of the South Bend Library. Meeting times will be available through the South Bend Library.

SOWETO, South Africa (AP) -The king of the Zulus urged thousands of armed supporters Sunday to curb the factional fighting that has caused almost 800 deaths in black townships around Johannesburg. 
"Everybody must lay down their arms and take their brother's hand in friendship," Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini told fellow tribesmen in Soweto and Tokoza, two townships that have been hard hit by the fighting which began in early August. 
Zwelithini shared the stage at the peace rallies with President Tutor Ndamase of the Transkei, the tribal homeland of the Xhosas. The Xhosas have joined fellow African National Congress supporters in clashes against Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement. 
Both sides blame the other for the fighting. 
But on Friday, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said South African President F.W. de Klerk now believes some of the violence may be instigated by a "hidden hand," an appar­ent reference to right-wing whites and others opposed to de Klerk's efforts to attain power-sharing between blacks and whites. 
"I have come to this place to put out the flames of violence," said Zwelithini at the two rallies attended by more than 30,000 Zulus, many wearing wearing red headbands and brandishing axes and spears.

ND engineering to hold Industry Fair 
By JOHANNA KELLY News Writer 
In an effort to promote inter­
action between students and 
industry, Notre Dame's Joint 
Engineering Council (JEC) is 
holding its annual Industry Fair 
this Wednesday. 
Thirty-eight companies plan on attending this year, which is the most ever throughout the fair's ten-year history, accord­ing to Katherine Pirrota, presi­dent of JEC. Some major par­ticipants are Andersen Consulting, Proctor & Gamble, Merck, IBM, Boeing, and Dow Chemical. 
The career fair will be held from 11-4 in the Fitzpatrick Engineering Building. This will offer engineering majors an opportunity to speak with com­pany representatives and dis­tribute their resumes, said Pirrota. 
" I would strongly encourge sophomores and juniors to at­tend," said Pirrota. "You can make some strong contacts." 
The president of Notre Dame's Society of Women Engineers, Colleen Templan, added, "We really have a di­verse group. There's virtually something for everyone." 
An hors d'oeuvre hour will be held at the South Bend Marriot 
from 5:30 to 6:30. This will give 
students a chance to talk in­
formally with company repre­
sentatives, said Pirrota. This 
event is sponsored by the 
General Electric Aerospace di­
vision. 
A banquet will follow, where 
Meredith Ross, Senior Controls 
Engineer with Bechtel 
Corportation will speak. Ross's 
talk, entitled "What Do You 
Want to be When You Grow 
Up?" will deal with choosing 
career paths. 
Ross, who recently returned 
from a two year assignment in 
London, is a life-time member 
of the Society of Women 
Engineers. She received the 
Outstanding New Engineer 
award from the Society in 1988. 
"The reason we asked Meredith is because it's the Year of the Woman," said Templan. "We were very inter­ested in getting a woman pro­fessional engineer to speak." 
Both Templan and Pirrota mentioned that transportation will be provided for all Notre Dame students interested in at­tending the banquet. Buses will leave the main circle starting at 5 p.m. on Wednesday. 
The event will be sponsored jointly by the Society of Women Engineers and the Joint Engineering Council.

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor, Accent Editor, Photo Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Column present the views of the authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus through letters, 
is encouraged. 

Dear Editor: 
Recent remarks in The Observer note the difficulties encountered in securing tickets for the Notre Dame football matches-in particular home games. Alumni, including mem­bers of the Monogram Club, are similarly frustrated. 
Sursum corda! The B/R Savings and Groan Society at the JACC provides relief. For a mere $419 per person, anyone on our planet can obtain a home game ticket. Via the B/R­Robustelli Marketing enter­prise, anyone can buy a "Ticket to the Game" and two nights at an Elkhart hotel, bus trips be­tween Elkhart and du Lac, an "Open Bar" Legends reception, a "Buffet Dinner with Beer, Wine" etc., the "Big Game Pep Rally" AND a "Legends Tailgate Party prior to the Game" at

Given that the real cost of this novel B/R Savings and Groan Society package is an estimated $250, you can declare the near $200 difference as a tax deductible contribution to the CSC (Center of Sports Concerns). The IRS will allow this since, de facto, the University is now a wholly owned subsidiary of its Athletic Department.

Development endangers tradition 
Dear Editor: 

What can a prestigious university, rich in tradition, do with 500 acres of woodlands? 
The plans have been made by the Notre Dame administration to destroy and develop such an area. The plans for this "unknown wilderness" possibly consist in the building of a new football stadium replacing our famous one, thus ruining nature and ending part of the Notre Dame tradition. Student unity is needed against this misuse of funds which will destroy beautiful land and the caring, spirited tradition we attend this school for. 
At a slide show at the Center for Social Concerns, I learned that the destruction of five acres has already been completed. This land contained free deer, birds, raccoons and many plush green trees and wildflowers, as do the over 500 acres remammg. These beautiful elements of nature cannot remain "unknown" and must not be destroyed as I have seen far too often. 
I am from New Jersey where our motto, "The Garden State" is a distant memory. A new football stadium (or any development of the woods) would destroy Notre Dame's tradition just as chemical companies and shopping malls have torn down New Jersey's motto. The tradition of our stadium as we know it (sitting with "Touchdown Jesus" shadowing the field, etc.) would be forgotten. And our university's image as a place of social concern and Christian justice would be raped along with the thousands of trees. 
We cannot want this to happen, and it does not need to be done. If we, the students, unite behind the life of the wilderness, the land and a great part of Notre Dame's tradition will be saved.

Relations committee makes headway 
Dear Editor: 

At the end of the '89 fall semester, the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's College Relations Committee was established.This joint university committee was formed to "create an atmo­sphere in which a positive and open feeling exists between members of the two campuses." 
The committee plans to "serve as the driving force be­hind improvements in Notre Dame/Saint Mary's relations." To date, the committee consists of concerned students and fac­ulty from both campuses. 
On August 27, the committee sponsored its first event, the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Freshmen Women's picnic. The picnic was held at Saint Mary's Haggar College Center. The purpose of this was for the women to meet each other be­fore stereotypical attitudes could be set. Being its first year, the picnic was a success. It was encouraging to see not only the number of women who participated, but also the inter­action that took place. 
Now it is time to explore fur­ther possibilities. The avenue is paved for improving relations. 
It is now up to you, the student body, to make the effort. As founders of the committee, we hope to see increased involve­ment. As we pass the leadership to Susan Zielinski and Pete Jakus, we encourage you to join them in their quest to lessen the tensions, to move on to bettering relations, and to strengthen the Notre Dame/ Saint Mary's community as a whole.

Have you cleaned up your act? 
Now that Notre Dame has been without maid service for a few weeks, how does your dorm look? How do you feel about the new cleaning procedures? Did the administration handle the change well? How does the cleanliness of your room (or lack thereof) compare with that of the "community areas" in the dorm? Write Viewpoint, P.O. Box Q, Notre Dame, IN 46556 and let us know what you think. Deadline for submissions is Tuesday, Sept. 18.

on the EP is the stirring song" The Red Flag," originally written in 1889 by an Irishman and now used by the British Labour Party. This traditional tune contains inspirational lyrics and is set to the old Jacobite air of "The White Cockade," which compels one to tap one's foot to the moving music. 
The final song on The Internationale, "My Youngest son Came Home Today," has to be ranked as one of Bragg's best. Written by Eric Bogle, author of great anti-war bal­lads such as"The Band Played Waltzing Matilda" and"The Green Fields of France," this selection is dark and morbid. 
The whining recorder creates an eerie atmosphere under which Bragg's voice moans "The fife and drum beat out the time/While in his box of polished pine/Like dead meat on a butcher's tray/My young son came home today." 
The lnternationale is a great album. It out does Bragg's previous album, Worker's Playtime, and is a positive indication that Bragg is back to the excellence of his earlier records.

went the final two yards for the score. 
Michigan pulled to within four with just over four minutes remaining in the half when Watters fumbled at the Notre Dame 34 and Grbac hit a wide­open Howard for a 44-yard touchdown pass just two plays later. 
The Wolverines took the lead on their opening drive of the second half. A pair of Grbac passes to Howard accounted for 
r 40 yards and two first downs and Vaughn picked up two more, moving the ball to the

attack that gained 265 yards in the game. "I haven't seen anybody run the ball on Notre Dame like that." 
The Wolverines extended their lead to ten points just seconds later after a Tony Brooks fumble gave them the ball at the Irish 
25. Grbac hit Howard in the left flat on first down and the fleet flanker outsprinted Rod Smitq and George Poorman down the sideline and into the end zone. 
Down by 10 and failing mis­erably in its attempts to stop Vaughn, Notre Dame entrusted its number-one ranking to its previously untested sophomore quarterback.

and hit Smith for 13 yards and

"We had a lot of motion as a unit in the drive," Mirer said. "It tells us we can come back from a deficit. It gives us confidence that we can be down to a great football team and still come back and win." 
Mirer said he didn't even feel nervous when the Irish trailed 24-21. He knew there would be

"He (Coach Lou Holtz) said, 'We're right in this thing and there's no reason to feel we can't win.'" Holtz said. "He felt we didn't need to run the ball that much. We needed to throw the ball. He asked me what I felt comfortable with and those

back. Mirer launched a pass to the streaking Ismail on the right side of the field. The ball bounced out of Ismail's hands and into the outstretched arms of freshman split end Lake Dawson, who advanced it to the Michigan 40. 
"I think that certainly was a big swing in the momentum," Holtz said. 
Culver capped the 13-play, 80-yard drive with a one-yard plunge up the middle, pulling the Irish to within three at 24­21. 
Michigan drove to the Notre Dame 11 on its next possession, but Stonebreaker's interception gave the Irish what seemed to be their last chance for a comeback. However, Mirer returned the favor just five plays later when he overthrew Tony Smith over the middle and safety Vada Murray intercepted the ball, returning it to the Michigan 19. 
The Wolverines picked up one first down before they were forced to punt from their own 30-yard line. Ismail fielded Eduardo Azcona's 46-yard punt at the Notre Dame 24 and the Irish began their final drive with 4:33 remaining on the game clock. 
On third-and-six from the Notre Dame 28, Mirer threw on the run to Smith for a 13-yard gain. Watters picked up 16 on the ground, and Mirer rolled left and connected with Ismail on the left sideline for an 11­yard pickup. Mirer then rolled right, spotted Jarrell at the goal line, and hit him with the winning touchdown pass. 
"It was a heck of a football game," said Holtz. "If we played another quarter, we might have been behind at the end of the fifth quarter. It's unfortunate when you have a game like that, you have to end it after four quarters." 
Moeller might very well agree. 
for now, there are other teams and other drives. 
He cannot afford to enjoy the spotlight just yet. One DRIVE does not make a quarterback, even if it is big enough to put in capital letters. 
If this keeps up, they might have to give Mirer an entire row of lockers to accomodate the hoards of media that will follow him. 
He can only hope they will come for the right reasons. 

Ismail shined at crunch time 
By GREG GUFFEY and 
FRANK PASTOR 
Sports Writers 
Rocket Ismail might not have scored the winning touchdown Saturday night in Notre Dame's 28-24 come-from-behind victory over Michigan, but he did make the big plays in the final drive. 
Ismail,who missed half of the second quarter after he suffered a bruised sternum, caught two passes and carried once in Notre Dame's winning drive, a 9-play, 76-yard effort that ended with a Rick Mirer touchdown pass to Adrian Jarrell. 
Ismail touched the ball three consecutive times in that drive -a run up the middle for four yards, a screen pass from Mirer for another four yards and an 11-yard pass from Mirer on the left sidelines. 
"We were on the sidelines and Rick Watters said to me, This is the time when All-Americans become All-Americans," said Ismail, one of the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy. "He couldn't have said it much bet­ter than that." 
He also "touched" off the biggest play in Notre Dame's third-quarter scoring drive.

ALL ARE ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND. 
On third and 15 from the Irish 15, Mirer threw a pass to Ismail streaking up the right side of the field. Ismail tipped the ball and it ended up in the hands of Notre Dame split end Lake Dawson, who picked up 45 yards and a first down. The Irish scored five plays later. 
Ismail finished with four catches for 42 yards and car­ried six times for 56 yards. Michigan varied its kicking game, allowing Ismail just one return for 25 yards. 
Jon Vaughn settled any ques­tions about the Michigan tail­back position. 
Running behind one of the most powerful offensive lines in the country, Vaughn gained a career-high 201 yards. He gained 57 yards in all of 1989. 
"It's been awhile since I've seen a team run the ball like that," said Irish coach Lou Holtz. 
Indeed, it had been almost three years since Penn State's Blair Thomas broke the 200­yard barrier, gaining 214 yards against the Irish. 
Mirer, a lifelong Michigan fan who once told former Wolverine head coach Bo Schembechler that he would someday play for him, wore a tattered Michigan tee-shirt under his uniform Saturday night. 
Mirer told reporters that the shirt was a source of inspiration and a reminder of the game's personal importance for him. He added that he does not plan to wear an opponent's tee-shirt every week. 
Holtz compared the game to a great heavyweight fight. 
"One time, one team's on top and has momentum, and the other one bounces up. If one guy knocks the other guy down and the other guy stays down, it isn't a great fight. 
"You knock this guy down, and he gets up and knocks you down. You get up and knock him down, and it just goes back and forth." 
Notre Dame became the first team since Purdue {1962-1966) to defeat Michigan four con­secutive times....Notre Dame is now 59-9-3 when ranked first in the nation, a figure that includes 15-1 under Holtz... .Fullback Rodney Culver picked up a career-high 95 yards on 19 carries in the game. His pre­vious high was 61 yards against Purdue in 1988. 

The Observer/Andrew McCloskey Rodney Culver led all Irish rushers with 95 yards.

Reds push lead to 5 1 /2 
CINCINNATI (AP) -The Los Angeles Dodgers self­destructed, wasting plentiful scoring chances and misplaying Bill Doran's fly ball into a costly two-run double as the Cincinnati Reds reopened a 5 1/2-game lead in the National League West. 
The Dodgers needed a win Sunday for a three-game sweep that would have got them within 3 1/2 games of Cincinnati. Instead, the Reds reduced the magic number to 12 for clinching their first division title since 1979. 
The Dodgers had plenty of opportunities to take control early -they loaded the bases in three of the first four innings off Norm Charlton and Scott Scudder (4-5). They left them loaded all three times, stranding a total of 10 run­ners and scoring just twice. 
Center fielder Stan Javier then made a key misplay of Doran's fly ball to start a six­run fifth inning against Mike Morgan (1 0-14) that snapped a 2-2 tie.

(AP)-The Miami Dolphins, no longer Dan Marino and a prayer, are 2-0 for the first time since 1984 by using ball control and defense ingredients missing in a four­year playoff drought -to rout the Buffalo Bills on Sunday 
It wasn't the passing of Marino, the blocking of an of­fensive line that kept the usu­ally relentless Bills off the quarterback or the running of rookie Sammie Smith that had Coach Don Shula crowing after a 30-7 victory. 
"The first three quarters were as good as you want to be around, from the standpoint of balance, not making errors and getting the ball for our offense in good field position," said Shula, who became the fourth NFL coach to win 200 games. 
Smith scored two touchdowns on short runs and gained 56 yards on 18 carries as Miami took the lead in the AFC East for the first time since December 1985. The Dolphins, who allowed 280 rushing yards in losing to the Bills last December, outgained Buffalo 128-44 this time. 
"For us to turn it around like we did today makes me feel real good," Shula said. 
49ers 26, Redskins 13 

Joe Montana, who became San Francisco's all-time leader in career passing yardage, threw for touchdowns to John Taylor and Jerry Rice. 
Montana completed 29 of 44 passes for 390 yards, eclipsing John Brodie's record of 31,548 with a 37 -yard completion to Taylor in the third quarter. The play gave Montana 
31.551 career yards. He finished with 31,654. 
Taylor had eight catches for 160 yards and Rice six for 74. Mike Cofer kicked four field goals for the 49ers (2-0).

Matt Fitz to give the Billikens a 
1-0 lead. 
The score quieted the small but 
enthusiastic crowd at Krause, 
but the Irish continued to play 
with intensity for the remainder 
of the first half, narrowly missing 
several scoring opportunities. 
Notre Dame came out strong in 
the second period, continuing to 
harass the Billiken defense and 
forcing St. Louis to slow the 
tempo of the match with a string 
of conservative passes which 
chewed up nearly four minutes 
from the clock. 
With thirty one minutes re­
maining in the game, the Irish 
inexperience began to show as 
the defense unraveled and a 
seemingly harmless shot by 
Billiken forward Kevin Huber 
deflected off a host of defenders 
and into the net, boosting the St. 
Louis lead to 2-0. 
"The second goal was due to a mistake caused by immaturity," Berticelli commented. "We have to stop allowing the cheap goals if we expect to play with the top teams." 
Following the second Billiken score, Notre Dame managed to regain its composure, and at the 29 minute mark wingback Kenyon Meyer drilled a brilliant shot past goalie Kevin Johnston, recharging the Irish offense and cutting the lead in half. 
The Irish continued to press St. Louis, and with thirteen minutes left in regulation the team's perseverance again paid off in the form of an unassisted Mario Tricoci goal which tied the score at 2-2. 
The deadlock was short-lived as Billiken forward Steve Kuntz took matters into his own hands, dribbling the length of the field and placing a pinpoint shot into the corner of the Irish net. giving St. Louis the lead for good. 
Despite the loss, Berticelli remained optimistic about his team's future, which includes a home matchup tonight with in­trastate rival Valparaiso. 
"You saw a different team out there tonight," he said. "This game will help us get over the hump." 
Valparaiso, which returns eight starters from last year's 5-16 squad, will enter Krause Stadium today winless in nineteen attempts versus the Irish.

Moments later, Margaret Jarc, on an assist from Susie Zilvitis, tallied her second goal of the afternoon on a fast break putting Notre Dame on top 4-o: Only four minutes later, Stephanie Porter, on another Zilvitis assist, burnt the Valparaiso defenders for a 5-0 margin. 
Notre Dame, which had 15 shots in the first half (35 in the game). closed out its first half scoring when Alison Lester headed a pass from Zilvitis into the net. 
Valparaiso's lone score came with 1:10 left in the first half, as Lueene Vernerine fed Kim Heinrich, who blasted a shot past Irish goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga. 
The second half saw the Irish continue their domination, as they rattled off six more goals. Freshman Tasha Strawbridge had a second-half hat trick, with two unassisted goals and one assisted by Marta Roemer. Freshman Christie Lewis also nailed two goals (with assists from Brenda Gorski and Marta Roemer). 
Sophomore midfielder Denise Chabot added a goal on an as­sist from Tasha Strawbridge. Strawbridge's hat trick was the first of the season for Notre Dame. 
On Sunday, the Irish attack was not quite as sharp, as they rebounded from a scoreless first half to defeat the Bears of Washington University.

Bradley and Blaising only trailed a pack of five Hoya runners with another group of six Hoya runners trailing them. At the half way point, though, that had all changed.

"You can't be happy until you win. We knew Georgetown was one of the top three teams in the country. All we can do is just keep working," said a somber Irish coach Tim Connell .

The Irish women's soccer team hammered Valparaiso on Friday, 12-1. 
Jennifer Haddad, but they found a way to do it at the 
60:38 mark. Susie Zilvitis, who had been robbed by Haddad in the first half, took an assist from Alison Lester and beat the formidable Haddad for a 1-0 Irish lead. 
"Although we dominated the game, there was no chance of us losing," observed Petrucelli. "We could have made it easier if we had finished our chances, but we didn't, and that led them to believe that they could play with us, when they had no business believing that." 
"I'm happy with the way we played, but I'm not necessarily happy with the result, because we wanted to score some more goals." 
A minor controversy over the interpretation of the new NCAA substitution rules followed the first Irish score, with referee Galen Graber sticking to the book. Graber, consistent with the 1990 NCAA rulebook, said that an inured player who has been substituted may not return. General substitution rules state that once a player has come off the field, that player may not return until the next half. 
If a player is injured, the coach may remove that player and play one player short until the injured player is able to re­take the field. The coach may also substitute for that injured player. If the coach chooses to substitute for the injured player, that player removed may not play again until the next half. 
However, this slight officiat­ing controversy was only one of many between the coaches and referees on the day. 
Notre Dame's final score came with just under 10 min­utes remaining in the contest, as Alison Lester continued her two-day scoring rampage. Lester, who took an assist from Marianne Giolitto, headed a point-blank shot over the head of the Washington keeper to seal the Irish win. 
"Alison Lester was outstand­ing," noted coach Chris Petrucelli. "She was dangerous today. They did not stop her, and they never dealt with her at all." 
"This was a good weekend for us. We scored some goals and we got two good wins. Things are starting to come to­gether. We're starting to play better, and we are getting bet­ter all the time. It's all starting to show on the field." 
Next up for Notre Dame is a Wednesday evening home matchup with Saint Jose h's.

"We never gave up hope," Head Coach Lou Holtz said after the game. "We just kept our poise and moved the ball down the field. The thing I was scared of is that we scored too early." 
Holtz's fear was compounded when Desmond Howard re­
( \' 
I 
turned Craig Hentrich's ensuing kickoff to the Michigan 
41. But on the next play, cornerback Reggie Brooks intercepted Elvis Grbac's pass intended for Howard at the Notre Dame 40, preserving the Irish victory and spoiling the debut of Wolverine Head Coach Gary Moeller. 
"When we came in here," Moeller said, "we felt like we were going to win this football game, and this hurts. A couple of calls by me probably didn't prove out to be very good calls." 
The most significant of those calls came with just over ten minutes remaining in the game and Michigan looking to build on its 24-21 lead, facing a first­and-ten situation at the Notre Dame 11. Although tailback Jon Vaughn had already sliced through the Irish defense for 55 yards in three carries on the drive (22 carries for 201 yards overall), Moeller called for a pass play that was picked off by inside linebacker Michael Stonebreaker in the end zone. 
"I made that call all on my own and we just didn't execute the play," said Moeller. "It was quite honestly a high-percent­age pass, but nothing's a given in this game." 
The only certainty in any 


Notre Dame-Michigan matchup is that no lead is insurmount­able as long as there is time remaining on the clock. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 14-3 first-quarter advantage behind an opportunistic defense and a well-balanced offense. Safety Greg Davis set up the first Irish score when he recovered Vaughn's fumble at the Michigan 26. The turnover was caused by a miscommunication in the Wolverine backfield, an indirect result of Michigan's no-huddle offense. 
"We knew we had to do one thing to come in here and beat this team," Moeller said. "We had to set the tempo on both sides of the football. It seemed to be effective for the most part." 
The Irish offense seized the opportunity and drew first blood when Mirer completed a six-play drive with a three-yard option run for the opening score. 
Following a 38-yard field goal by J.D. Carlson, Notre Dame put together an impres­sive 11-play, 75-yard scoring drive to go ahead 14-3. Mirer hit tailback Ricky Watters for 17 yards and a first down and flanker Raghib Ismail for 14 yards. Fullback Rodney Culver (a career-high 95 yards on 19 carries) set up the touchdown with a 20-yard run to the Michigan two, and Tony Brooks

Mirer enjoys talking about 'THE DRIVE' 
Someone shouted a good warning in the Notre Dame lockerroom to sophomore quarterback Rick Mirer after he had rallied the Irish to a 28-24 victory over Michigan Saturday night. 
"Get ready Rick," he said. "Here they come." 
But Mirer didn't seem to mind because the reporters and TV cameras were there for the right reasons -to talk about THE DRIVE in which he led the Irish to the winning touchdown in the closing minutes of Saturday's game. 
At least they weren't here to ask him why he hit Michigan free safety Vada Murray in the numbers with a pass deep in Wolverine territory earlier in the fourth quarter (He answered anyway: "Tony Smith was wide open. I was excited and I wanted to get him the ball."). Or how it felt to lose in his first career start at Notre Dame (He made sure he didn't have to answer that one). 
Notre Dame runners hammer Hoyas 
By BARB MORAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's cross country team started off its season on the right foot, cap­turing a decisive 20-41 upset over 12th-ranked Georgetown Saturday morning. 
The Irish, who are currently,. ranked 13th in the nation, tookil a strong lead at the outset and held it until the end of the S­mile race. A pack of nine run­l ners, seven from Notre Dame, led for the first three miles. ( --When the group split at the 
I four mile mark, Irish harriers \ 
Mike O'Connor and John Coyle took the lead, followed closely:I by Ryan Cahill of the Irish and 
I; 
" 
Steve Holman of the Hoyas. 
O'Connor crossed the finish line first, with a time of 24:43.3, and was followed only two seconds later by Georgetown's Holman. Coyle, Cahill, and Patrick Kearns cap­tured the remaining three of the top five spots for the Irish. Overall, Notre Dame had seven runners finish in the top ten, including freshman Mike McWilliams, who placed ninth. 
Irish coach Joe Piane was ex­tremely pleased, though not surprised, by his team's strong performance, and expects them to continue improving. 
"It was a great meet," said Piane, "it's obvious that we were underrated (in the na­

tiona! rankings), and it's hard to expect us not to go up. The team ran very well, and once 
J.T. Burke is back in, we'll be even better." 
Burke skipped the meet due to illness and is questionable for Notre Dame's next meet, the National Catholic Invitational on September 28. 
Piane is planning to keep the Irish working hard for the next several weeks in preparation for several invitationals and the NCAA trials on November 25. The upset over the Hoyas should give the Irish a strong boost in the national rankings and begin the momentum needed to carry them into the postseason. 

Greg Guffey 
Sports Editor 
This was a time when Mirer didn't care if they stayed all night, if they asked him to replay all four quarters and discuss everything he's done from birth to his first Irish victory. He knew that once he left that room there would be little time to savor the victory. 
"I wasn't really nervous even though I had a lot on my mind," said Mirer, who wears the same number as former Notre Dame and San Francisco great Joe Montana. "I grew up a fan of Michigan and it was sweet to get my first victory against them. I knew too many guys on that team to have let them take away my first chance at victory." 
It used to be that Mirer could be the first one to shower and exit the lockerroom. He probably received more media attention in his senior year at nearby Goshen High than he did in his freshman year at Notre Dame. 
But THE DRIVE changed that.
