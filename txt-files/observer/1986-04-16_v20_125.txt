USSR cancels diplomatic meeting as protest of U.S. 'bandit action' 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -The Soviet Union yt·sterday called oti a planned meeting between U.S. Se<:retary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze bt-causc of the U.S. bombing raids on libya, an·ording to a governmt·nt statement carried hy the official Soviet news agency Tass.

Foreign reaction mixed on attack 
Associated Press 
Atlt·a.~t one U.S. ally said Monday it was told in advance about the American air atta<:k on Libyan tar­gt·ts, hut most foreign govern­mt·nts did not react immediately to news of the strike. 
In a statement released by his oflke, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said his govern­ment "ha.o; been tully consulted by year between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gor­bachev. 
"In etiect, the administration it­self has made impossible at this stage the planned meeting on the level of the ministers of foreign af­fairs of our two countries," the statement said. 
The government statement said the Kremlin had warned the United States against continuing provocative actions. 
"The Soviet government resolutely condemns the ag· gressive bandit action taken by the United States against libya, a sovereign state and a member of 
the United States all along and was notified in advance ofits intentions with respe<.·t to Libya. 
"We accept President Reagan's statement that Libya was involved in the perpetration of terrorist at· tacks," Mulroney said. 
It was past midnight Monday in Europe when the White House an· nounced the bombing raids. At British Prime Minister Margaret the United Nations organization, and demands an immediate end to it. Otherwise, more far-reaching conclusions will have to be drawn in the Soviet Union," according to the statement. 
The White House called the Soviet decision "a mistake." 
"The Soviet decision shows where they stand on the important issue of international terrorism. It also says something about their commitment to work con· structively on issues on the U.S.­Soviet agenda, including arms reductions and regional crises," said presidential spokesman Larry Speakes. 
Thatcher's office in London, press officer Mike Horne said: "Until I get full details I shall not be able to comment. I doubt if we will have any comment until tomorrow morning." Opposition leaders, however, assailed her decision. 
Elsewhere in Europe, anti· 
American protesters demonstrated outside U.S. diplomatic missions in West Ger­many, Greece, Austria and Cyprus. 



Reagan announces success in air raids as Libya retaliates 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The White House proclaimed U.S. air raids on libya a success that "struck a blow against terrorism," but libya ap­parently retaliated by aiming a hit­and-run strike at a remote U.S. Coast Guard station in the Mediterranean yesterday. 
President Reagan said "the United States won but a single engagement in the long battle against terrorism" and pledged to continue with more strikes if necessary. 
Diplomats here estimated 100 people were killed in the attack on Tripoli, including Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy's 15-month-old adopted daughter Hana. Two of Khadafy's sons, aged 3 and 45, were injured in the raid. 
But Libyan officials said Khadafy himself was not hurt. 
"We would prefer not to have to repeat the events of last night," Reagan told a group of business ex­ecutiv<."S. But he said that would be up to Khadafy, whom he labeled an arch-terrorist. 
"What is required is for libya to end its pursuit of terror for political goals," said Reagan. "The choice is theirs." 
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said the nighttime U.S. born· bings "successfully accomplished" their twin objectives of damaging Khadafy's ability to perpetrate ter· rorism and showing him the United States would strike to punish him for past attacks on Americans and to pre-empt future ones. 
An air and sea search was under way for an Air Force F-Ill fighter· bomber and its two-man crew mis­sing after the Monday night attack. 
lbe Pentagon identified the missing airmen as Capt. Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci, 33, of Puerto Rico, the pilot; and Capt. Paul F. Lorence, 31, of San Francisco, the weapons system officer. 
Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said rescue planes continued to search over the water off Libya after dark yesterday but had found "no evidence of survivors, no beepers, no strobes" to indicate where the lost plane went down. 
He said the search-and-rescue operation was not drawing fire and no other U.S. forces were in the area, despite Libyan reports of a renewed attack. 
Barely 15 hours after the bombing of targets in and around Tripoli and the western port city of Benghazi, Libya announced a retaliatory strike of its own against the U.S. Coast Guard telecommunications station on the tiny Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. 
A U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said at least two missiles were fired from an unidentified ship or plane at the long-range navigation station on 


Moammar Khadafy 
the Italian island north of the Ubyan coast. 
The spokesman, Nicholas San· difer, said a report from the island indicated the missiles landed in the water just off the island, causing no damage or casualties. 
Speakes said the United States was still assessing the situation and he could not say what the response might be. He said there were 31 Coast Guard personnel at the long· range navigation site and that they had no weapons other than personal small arms.

Americans must try to understand European reaction to U.S. air raid 
This sure isn't the '60s. 

The United States attacks libya in an overnight bom­
bing raid, and people are literally cheering. 
A banner hanging outside of Flanner Hall reads: United States-2, libya-0. The nation lets its collective frustrations out. Reagan is still a god, and Americans are wondering why the rest of the world -specifically our European allies-aren't exactly rejoicing with us in our victory. 
What's the matter? Don't they want to stop terrorism, too? Terrorist acts are taking place directly on European soil. So why have none ofour European allies, except for Great Britain, come out publicly in support ofthe raid? 
One answer is that Europeans in general are afraid ­frightened as much by the United States as they are by the Soviet Union. As a civilization whose power is in decline, Europe has been caught in an uneasy bind bet­ween the two superpowers, both geographically and ideologically. 
Europeans must exist on 

D the same continent as the Soviet Union; therefore, the threat of destruction to their homes and countries looms overhead, contributing to a more wide-spread policy of appeasement toward Russia than we have in the U.S. 
They fear any agitation which might bring the hor­rors of both World Wars ­which were fought on European soil -back down on them again. Directly at-· tacking Soviet-supported libya, they most likely think, can only increase their dan­gerous situation in world af­fairs. 

On the other hand, western Europe has ideological and historical ties to the U.S. which bind them to our national tenets offreedom and democracy. But they feel that they have no real input in U.S. policy affairs, which contributes to their sense of helplessness. European destiny, many of them feel, is being guided by the in· sensitive, nationalistic hand ofAmerican foreign policy. 
The gulf between the American and the European Weltansbauung widens. 
Who's right? Should America have retaliated or should we have refrained from escalating the violence? Neither side· American or European-fully understands how passionately the other feels about the subject. 
Last year when I was studying in Austria through Notre Dame's lnnsbruck program, Europeans con­stantly challenged my beliefs as an American. Unfor­tunately, I probably sounded more like an ideologue than any "brain-washed" Russian, because my German was only on an approximately second-grade level, and

all I could spit out were things like, "I like peace" or "Russia is not good. They are bad." 
But as my German progressed (or when I just spoke English with my European friends), I came to realize how imperialistic and strong-minded our country really seems to foreigners. Americans live on such a broad ex­panse of land that most citizens never travel outside their own country, much less learn foreign languages or alien views. Europeans, however, live close together in a multi-lingual area. 
Thus, Americans tend to become cut-off from oppos­ing views. We do not under­stand why others do not agree with our actions and policies. We do not under­stand the fervent opposition people in the Middle East and even Latin America feel toward America, which they 
USSR view as a big bully 'With a lot of money seeking to impose its own will on the rest ofthe world. 
A lack of mutual under­standing leads to conflict and often anger -like the anger many Americans probably feel toward Europe for nor supporting our actions against ter­
rorism. 
It remains for the historians to look back and judge the prudence of America's action against Libya. In the meantime, a more subtle approach to:vyard, the,com-c plexities of national psychology might prove fruitful.

WASHINGTON President Reagan lost a key battle over aid to Nkaragua's Contra n·bds yestt·rday as the !Joust· rebuffed a Republican bid to separate the aid proposal from a spt·nding bill Reagan may choose to Vt'tO. 
The llouse in a near party-line 221·202 vote thwartt·d an effort by furious Republican leaders to sub­stitute new ground rules for ones impost·d by tht Ilouse Democratic lcadnship. 
The rules drafted by the Democratk majority on the House rules t:ommittee were then ap­proved in a narrow 212-208 vote. 
Rt·publkan kadas said the deci­sion to tit· tht· Contra aid plan to an unrdatt·d S1.7 billion supplemental appropriations bill was a blatant politkal move designed to kill the aid program and leave the rebels with no U.S. support ofany kind. 
But Democrats said the GOP should be grateful for a second t:ham:e of obtaining aid for the anti· Sandinista guerrillas in light of their 222·21 0 defeat on the issue last month. 
Only one Republican joined 220 Demoaats to oppost· Reagan's posi­tion. Twenty-seven Democrats and 
17';  Republicans  supported  the  
Whitt· !louse.  
Earlier,  President  Rt·agan  im·  

plored tht· Ilouse to approve $100 
million for the rebc:ls in Nicaragua, saying Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has sent weapons and ad­visers there to "bring his war home to tht United States." 
As the House opened considera­tion of Reagan's request for military and other assistance for the rebels, the president told a group of busi­ness executives that Khadafy "has bragged that he is helping the 
Nicaraguans  because  they  fight  
America on its own ground."  
Addressing  the  American  Busi·  

ness Council on the day after U.S. warplanes bombed a host of targets in Libya in reprisal for terrorist acts against Americans, Reagan said: "I would remind the House voting this week that this arch-terrorist has sent 5400 million and an arsenal of weapons and advisers into Nicaragua to bring his war home to the United States." 
"We do not underestimate the brutality of this evil man," Reagan said. "Col. Khadafy ought not to un­derestimate either the capacity or legitimate anger ofa free people." 
Tht parliamentary jockeying came as lawmakers began to con­sider anew Reagan's Contra aid program, which was defeated in the House 222·210 last month. The Senate subsequently approved the plan in late March by a narrow mar­gin, but with several conditions on how and when the money could be sent to the counterrevolutionaries. 
As the House opened its session, a man stood in the publicgalleries and yelled at Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., 0-Mass., who was presiding. 
"The blood of the Contras will be on your conscience if you don't give them the money, Tip," he shouted, calling the speaker by his nickname. 
As police ejected the man from the chamber he shouted, "God bless America." He was not immediately identified. 
In advance of the House debate, presidential spokesman Larry Spealtes said that if the present rules arrangement prevailed, "we're going to begiven the shaft as far as an opponunity for the American people to have a vote" on the sole question of whether to approve military and other assistance for the rebels opposing the Sandinista government in Managua. 
As the Contra aid plan appeared on the House agenda for the second time in less than a month, House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R· Ill., assailed as "an abomination" the effort by Democrats to link the rebel aid to a Sl.7 billion supplemental ap· propriations bill. 
Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi said he would offer "a fairer substitute rule that would prevent the Contra aid provisions from being incorporated (in the spending bill) and would guarantee separate votes on the various Contra aid alternatives."

HPC discusses aspects ofcouncil organization 
By CHRIS SKORCZ 
Senior StaffReporter 
The Hall Presidents' Council, 
comprised largely of newly-elected 
presidents, met last night at Fisher 
Hall for what turned out to be a brief, 
organizational meeting. 
The evening's lone item of busi· ness involved the amendment of current HPC by-laws under which the HPC is run jointly by a chairper· son and an executive coQrdinator. By a 20-3 vote, far exceeding the necessary two-thirds majority, the Council voted to allow for co­chairpersons. 
The passed amendment reads as follows: "Co-chairpersons of the HPC may be elected in place of a chairperson and executive coor­dinator. The established duties of the chairperson and executive coor­dinator will be divided between the two co-chairpersons as they see fit." 
The co-chairpersons will retain one vote between them, according to the amendment. 
Following the passage of the amendment, the co-chairpersons, Joanie Cahill and Sheila O'Connor, called for volunteers from the coun­dl to represent the IIPC on the Stu­dent Senate. Three hall presidents will be chosen. Cahill and O'Connor also requested volunteers from the council to comprise the HPC Sow­der Award Committee for which five hall presidents will be chosen. 
Each month the Sowder Award Committee selects a hall for its out­standing spirit or community service. 
The HPC representatives for the senate and the HPC Sowder Award Committee will be chosen later in the week, according to O'Connor. 
Also present at the meeting were Bruce Lohman and Maria Cintron. Lohman, a member of the student committee designed to aid in the selection of the next University president, distributed surveys to bt· completed by hall residents con­cerning the criteria for the new president. 
Cintron, chairman of the Judicial Board, requested that hall presi­dents, particularly those on the South Quad, try to find a representative to serve on the Un­dergraduate Student Council. This council represents students facing disciplinary action. 

Saint Mary's events planned by Board of Programming 
By.KIM YURATOVAC 
News Staff 
Increased publicity and student involvement were among the goals set for next year by the Saint Mary's Board Of Governance at last night's meeting. 
The board hopes to achieve more awareness through increased publicity by utilizing bulletin boards, faculty updates and greater communication between students and student government, according to Student Body President Jeanne Heller. 
"We're concerned with increas· 
ing awareness," she said. 
Heller encouraged all to voice their opinions in the "Gripe Night" scheduled for this Sunday. 
The board also discussed with Saint Mary's Housing Director Pat Rissmeyer their concern for increas­ing the role ofresidence hall govern· ment. 
Heller suggested that there be greater communication and involve· ment between the hall and student body officers. 
Heller also expressed student government's desire to aid the ad· ministration in recruiting and ac­commodating minority students at Saint Mary's. She said the board is waiting to talk with the administra· tion before they talte action. 
The board also highlighted some of next year's specific plans, includ· ing Safety Week, to be held Sept. H­I 2, self defense courses and a heightened awareness ofdate rape. 
In other business, Judicial Com· m1ss1oner Sandy Cerimele an­nounced that hall elections will be held from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on April 23 in Haggar College Center. 
Cerimele said that a "Meet The Candidates" night will be held April 21 in the llaggar College Center par­lor.

Misfired Libyan missiles caused damage to cities, U.S. pilots say 
Associated Press 
Aboard the U.S.S. America, Mediterranean Sea -libyan forces may have inflicted damage on their own citizens with badly aimed anti­aircraft missiles, according to air­men who participated in the U.S bombing raid. 
The commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet also said yesterday that he was surprised libyan planes were not used to counter the U.S. strike. 
U.S. pilots and bombadiers who helped conduct the ra.ld said plenty of surface-to-air missiles were fired at them by the libyans but that most seemed to go straight up in the air and fall back down again. 
They said they saw no libyan planes and had also anticipated more ofa libyan response.

Speakes also confirmed that a truck laden with rocket launchers had exploded outside Yokota U.S. Air Force Base in Japan at 6:10a.m. yesterday but said it was too early to say whether the incident was the result of a terrorist attack. He said there were no injuries. 
American military and diplomatic installations throughout the world are on full alert, and Speakes said Americans have been constantly advised "to be prudent and cautious when they're traveling." 
An estimated 800 Americans are still believed to be in libya, despite President Reagan's previous order that they depart by Feb. I. Ap­proximately 15,000 Italians and tens of thousands of other Europeans are

Safely back aboard the U.S. aircratt carrier U.S.S. America, the airmen said much of the damage caused by the strike likely came from the libyans themselves and their poorly aimed missiles. 
The airmen and the fleet com­mander, Adm. Frank Kelso, spoke to a pool of reporters aboard the America, one of two U.S. aircraft car­riers that launched planes against libya. 
Kelso said he was surprised Col. Moammar Khadafy did not send up planes to counteract the U.S. strike in Tripoli and Benghazi. 
libya's ability to fly nighttime mis­sions is thought to be limited, and that is believed to be the reason American jets struck at night. 
Kelso voiced pride in the mission. 
"We don't like to see Americans 

also in libya. There was no im­mediate word of any threats against the foreigners. 
The spokesman refused to discuss damage to the French embassy and to several homes in an afiluent residential neighborhood of the libyan capital. He said U.S. officials did not yet know the extent of damage inflicted on intended military targets and would be analyz­ing after-action reports throughout the day. 
Speakes declined to say whether the military operation against libya was complete, but officials at both the White House and the Pentagon insisted numerous times yesterday afternoon that no new U.S. action was under way despite reports of new episodes of anti-aircraft fire in Tripoli. · 
Shultz, in a Tuesday morning ap­pearance on NBC's "Today" show, said: "we hope that this move will, on the one hand, shock people into seeing how serious (terrorism) is and, .on the other, bring about its diminution and a rallying ofpeople."

Marchers, who included some Libyans, also shouted for the govern­ment to close the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. They filed past the residence of U.S. Ambassador Hume Horan, with a truck filled with riot police trailing behind, officials said. 
In Washington, National Public Radio, quoting an administration source, said the attack was presumed to be a Libyan operation. It said there had been several intel­ligence reports that the libyans had been planning some sort of action against U.S. officials in the Sudan. 
Sudan was very close to the United States under the presidency of Gaafar Nimeiri but has mended fences with libya in the year since he was ousted in a bloodless coup on April 6, 1985. The United States is among Sudan's largest aid donors.

American protesters mark day of aid vote 
Associated Press 
Demonstrators flocked to federal 

buildings, congressional offices and 
national monuments in at kast 18 
cities Monday to protest U.S. aid to 
Nicaraguan rebds, and more than 
I80 people were arrested. 
The rallies by military veterans 
and church and anti-war groups 
were hdd on the eve of considera­
tion by the House ofRepresentatives 
on President Reagan's $100 million 
aid package. 
"The position that a nation of less 
than .3 million people of Nicaragua 
could possibly be a threat to the 
United States is ludicrous -with or 
without aid from the Soviet Union. 
or Cuba, or both," Bill Corrigan, a 
62-year-old Army veteran said at a 
Cleveland rally at a monument to 
Civil War veterans. 
The House yesterday took up Rt·agan's plan to give S70 million in military and 530 million in non­lt:thal, humanitarian aid to the U.S.­backed Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista govern­ment. 
Last month, the House voted 222­2 I 0 against Reagan's plan, but the Republican-controlled Senate later gave 'i3-47 approval of a modified version of the package, sending it bat·k to the House. 
New York City police arrested 127 people for blocking an entrance to the major federal office building in Manhattan, and two Boston protesters were arrested on charges of trespassing at the Central Intel­
ligence Agency office. 
In Washington, D.C., police ar­
rested c; 7 people who refused to end 
a vigil near a monument to slain civil 
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
in the Capitol Rotunda. 
Protesters in Atlanta greeted 
public health professionals arriving 
at the national Centers for Disease 
Control for a conference on 
violence, urging them to wear 
armbands to protest l!.S. military in­
volvement in Central America. 
About c;o anti-Contra 
demonstrators gathered outside 
City Hall in Tampa, Fla., where 
former Costa Rican Vice President 
Mario Rojas was speaking in favor of 
the aid package, and an appearance 
by a Contra official in Des Moines, 
Iowa, drew about a dozen protesters 
from a church group. 
In Boston, hundreds of demonstrators jammed offices ofthe Internal Revenue Service, forcing taxpayers to file through a police barricade to get inside, then marched through downtown to the CIA office. 
About 500 people, part of a coali­tion called Pledge of Resistance, gat­hered at the federal building in Chicago, some ofthem covered with red paint to symbolize blood. 
The Rev. Donald Schupp of Solid Rock Baptist Church, who came dressed as the Angel of Death, said the protesters were risking arrest because "we are getting into anot­her Vietnam." None was arrested.

Italian-cut blazers pushed up to the elbows at a three-quarter level are good choices. Loose and uncon· structed, with narrow, high­notched lapels, these jackets are extremely vogue. The look in men's jackets is generally focused on defining broad shoulders and nar­row waists, but for a change, we can find the elegant simplicity ofa longer, collarless jacket refreshing. Straighter in line, emphasizing 
neither the shoulders or waist, this 
look is a breath offresh air. 
Double pleated trousers of 
polished cotton, conon sheeting, or 
fine linen state something about 
your style. You are a man ofobvious 
taste. Men this season are much 
more understated than women. 
They offer an impression that is 
cool and direct... and slightly unex· 
pected. Belts and ties are more 
subtle, yet should offer a strong 
accent to the suit. Alligator skin and 
leather both come through strongly 
in this area. 

A word about color. It, probably above all else, will invite a second glance the fastest. To create a memorable image. choose a color that gets your point across. Dual tones, bronze, and fiery red are extremely prevalent colors this season emphasizing every gesture. Red in particualar is very provocative and intense. It's an aggressive color in that it raises the blood pressure and the heartbeat of the viewer. And it's incredibly chic. 
Fashion is wild. It's powerful because of what it can do and be­cause of how it can invoke reac· tions or feelings in other people. Though, as GQ's February issue so aptly put it, "You have to dress with an acceptable bow to the com­munity to which you belong," your style need not be shackled. When 
the public sees jazz, it doesn't 
clamor for just a taste. It wants to 
swallow it whole. Show off your 
jazz, baby. Show them your star

Catholics 
by Rick Detorie 


Detorie describes the ins an outs of growing up and living as a Catholic through cartoon frames, subjects ranging from private grade-school education to views ofheaven and hell. 
The book as a whole is quite funny, but after reading through it, I had mixed feelings. Emphasis was placed more on the oppressive nature ofCatholicism rather than the quirks ofthe faith. It poked fun at some aspects of the Church with aggression, pervading the book with common themes which at references made to beliefs and 
experiences. The audience is quite limited. I found few people with different backgrounds who could understand much of the book wit­hout my explanations. 
As I said before, much of the book is quite humorous. Many of Detorie's references to the Church and grade school fit well es­tablished stereotypes about Cat­holic life. But a predominance of the book's subject matter is just that -stereotypical. The nun who punishes her students is funny at

Dreams can come true, even for 'normal' people 
Chicago has always been a city of dreams for me. When I was little, I would play ball in my front yard and dream of my heroes: Fergie Jenkins, Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and other mt·mbcrs of the hopeless and helpless Chkago Cubs. When I first started playing hockt·y I wanted to be Tony Esposito and lead the Chicago Blackhawks to a Stanley Cup over thost· drt·aded Montrtal Canadicns. 
Mike Wilkins here, there and back 
In the four and a halfyt·ars I have been here, I have taken several trips to Chicago, visiting monstrous Chicago Stadium or paying homage to the Wrigley field shrine. last sum­mer Ispent a good dt·al of my time driving into Chkago to sec my girlfriend. I even came this dose to going to school there. But none of my trips to Wrigley field was more enjoyable than my most recenl one. 
Two weeks ago I wa.~ lucky enough to see drt·am in Chicago, It wasn't Ryne or Dennis Savard or one of my other modc:rn heros taking their team to glory. In­it was a neighbor of mine, dancing her way through a drea113 of her own. I went to 
see, ofall things, the ballet. A neighbor of mine from home had just made the Joffrey Ballet and was performing at Chicago's beautiful Civic Opera House. I had never been to a bal­let there before and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to sec my friend dance, visit my favorite city and pick up a little culture all at the same time. 
I must admit, I was more than a little skepti· cal about going to the ballet. For someone who's used to guzzling beers and lighting for standing room only scats in the second bal­cony at the stadium, the idea of rubbing el­bows with all those artsy people sipping~ champagne in their velvety chairs seemed rat­her strange. But I've always gone to Chicago to watch dreamers chase their dreams and this time was no different. I wanted to go this time to watch a friend whose dream had come true. 
My friend had been dancing for as long as I can remember. She left home before she was in high school, going to ballet schools to try to become the dancer she'd always dreamed of being. She's had to leave family and friends be· hind in favor ofdistant cities and strange faces. She's been slowed by injuries that threatened her career and stunned by teachers who said she would never make it. But now she has made it and she's doing what she's always wanted to do. Not many of us can say that. That alone was enough to get me to go to the ballet. 

Most of us are here pursuing some sort of goal, but at one time or another we all chased dreams. Somewhere along the line, we've had to replace our dreams with goals. Some of us arc still after those dreams: dreams of becom­ing a doctor, a scientist or maybe even a lawyer. But most of our dreams were less realistic and we've had to abandon them as reality has taken over. It's not necessarily bad to replace your dreams with more realistic goals, virtually all of have had to make that transitition. But it is a very special person who gets the opportunity to really pursue his or her dream and then be able to bring that dream to life. 
As I watched my friend dance, I thought of the long hours she had to put in and the frustration and pain that accompanies the development of a God-given gift. And I thought about a friend who graduated from here last year who is trying hard to become a writer and the patience and dedication she has to have to stick with it. In some small way I was envious of these two friends, each with a dream within her grasp while our own dreams elude the rest ofus. But in a much bigger way l was happy for them, happy to the point of sharing in the pride they must feel each day their dreams continue to become reality. 
After the performance, my mom and I took my newest hero out for a drink. It was kind of how I imagine it would be to take Rync

Whitt· you arc at it, there's another question 
which I seek insights. When we arc con­

Fasting is one way of testing the strength of

Value of coed housing evident in London 
DearEditor: 
We were fortunate enough to participate in the Arts and Letters London Program last semester. We were also the first Notre Dame students to be a part of the University's coeducational housing arrangement. Mike Ferrick's comments in the March I 4 Observer article on coed housing options offered by foreign studies programs are deceptive for those who did not experience the situation. In particular, the statement, "Guysstayed over in girls' rooms and girls stayed over in guys' rooms," is grossly misleading. 
First, the coed situation was implemented only out of necessity: the 25-occupant Residence and 65-occupant West Two Hotel did not allow segregation of men and women. Although the larger West Two was divided ac­cording to floor, parietals were technically impossible to enforce. lack of enforcement, however, did not mean lack ofresponsible be­havior. 
Among the many benefits of the London Program was the abiiity to develop close and lasting friendships as we learned to depend on one another in our new surroundings. Toget­her we coped with the challenges living in Europe presented--preparing meals, commut­ing, banking and travelling safely and wisely. Our shared experience taught us respect and consideration for one another. 

Because we acted out of consideration, we did not abuse the privilege ofsuch a living ar­rangement. Instead, we took special care to develop a close-knit community of men and women through liturgies, shared meals, and late-night conversations. 
Father Art Wheeler, rector of the Residence, commented: "I really did have the impression that the people in last semester's program had handled the living situation responsibly and maturely. So often students said to me that they considered the living situation to be healthy and that the adminis­tration's fears about cohabitation were un­founded. I'm afraid that, whatever the intentions of those interviewed, the article gives the opposite impression." 
Ferrick was correct in stating that "everybody was pretty positive" about the coed dormitory. The reason he cites, ef­fectively non-existent parietals, is not why we found the coed living arrangement so satisfy­ing. The mutual trust that staff and students enjoyed helped make the London semester perhaps the best in our Notre Dame career. We hope that future students will have the op-Sandberg out for a beer after the game. Here we were, sitting at a table in a bar in Chicago talking to someone who hundreds of people had just paid good money to see perform. I listened intently to every word she said: stories of where she had been and where she was going next. I asked her questions about living in New York City and about the pressures ofdancing at this new level. She was every bit the professional, every bit the con­queror of a dream. 
But as she sat there behind a big bowl of salad and a mug of beer, she was still the little girl across the street. Her pulled-back hair revealed the innocence in her face, a face that could just as easily have been here at Notre Dame or down at Indiana or across the street in Fort Wayne. She was just every bit as friendly and every bit a.'l normal as she was when she was just a kid dreaming of being right where she is today. 
1guess that's what makes her so special to me and that's what has won my admiration for her and my friend the writer. She is just a nor­mal girl doing what all us other normal people have always wanted to be doing: making a dream come true.

Disciplinary policy biased for athletes 

DearEditor: 
It is too bad the two students who were ex­pelled from the University last semester for breaking p;u-ietals in Lyons Hall didn't have Lou Holtz to come to their defense and tell the administration, "Let me just say this: What they did was a bad act, but they are not bad people." 
And since the issue here is "bad acts" and not "bad people," which is the 'more serious offense: beingcaught in theroom ofa member of the opposite sex after the bewitching hour of midnight, or sending a man to the hospital and destroying property while out on a drunken spree? At Notre Dame the answer depends on whether or not the perpetrators arc football players.

Ed White, who did not even attempt a shot for Managerial Units, found some consolation in the loss. 
"We wanted to lose the game," said White. "Our motive for losing was to get a better draft pick for next year."

SMC track sets record; softball team is swept 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
There was plenty ofactivity at An­gela Field over the weekend, as the Saint Mary's softball and track and field teams played host to their op­ponents. 
The softball team lost both games of a doubleheader to St. Francis Qoliet) last Saturday but swept two games from DePauw on Sunday to bring their record to 9-S. The track team dropped its record to 2-1 on Saturday, when it lost to Hope Col­lege. 
Head Coach Scott Beisel cited poor defense as the primary reason for the softball team's 16-1loss in its first game against St. Francis. 
Freshman Mary Malina's single in the second inning was the only hit for Saint Mary's. Shortstop Kris Pan­telleria, a junior, had two put-outs and three assists in the game. 
The Belles lost the second game to St. Francis, 8-1. The score was tied at 1-1 until the ninth inning, when the opponents scored seven runs. Saint Mary's failed to make a com­eback in the bottom of the inning. 
Freshman Amy Cuti, sophomore Marge Reynolds and junior Janine Adamo each singled in the game. Junior Lorri White had eight put­outs and two assists, while Pan­telleria had four put-outs and six assists. 
On Sunday the Belles played an entirely different brand of ball, defeating DePauw 10-4 and 9-2. Senior Cathy Logsdon, now 5-3 for the season, was the winning pitcher in the first game, and freshman Tammy Shelor recorded the win in the second game. 
In the first game freshman Trish Tierney went 3-for-4 with one RBI and two stolen bases. White went 3­for-3 and had five put-outs, while Malina went 2-for-3 and had two RBI's, five put-outs and one assist. 
Cuti contributed three hits and 
against DePauw, and Adamo had two hits, one RBI and seven put-outs. Malina had one hit and three RBI's, and Julie McNish, a sophomore, had two hits and two RBI's.

Spinks has new role in upcoming heavyweight bout 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. -Michael Spinks is aware of a change in his status since his upset of Larry Holmes for a piece of the heavyweight champion­ship. 
"It (being a heavyweight cham­pion) carries a lot more respect and prestige than being light heavyweight champion did," Spinks said yesterday. 
"People say, 'You're the one to beat Larry Holmes."' 
But there's a sameness for Spinks in his rematch against Holmes for the International Boxing Federation heavyweight title Saturday night at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
"It's different to a certain extent," Spinks said. "I'm the defending champion. But I'm still the under­dog. 
"I really don't know if people ac­cept my victory." 
While Holmes is favored, he is not the solid choice he was for the first fight last Sept. 1 S in which he was trying to match the late Rocky Maricano's record of 49-0. 
"I got sick to death of people as­king me what I thought my chances were," said Spinks, recalling his bid 
to  become  the  frrst  light  
heavyweight  champion  to win  a  
heavyweight title.  

"I wasn't supposed to last accord­ing to the experts ... so-called ex­
perts.
... 
Two judges favored Spinks by one point each, both scoring the 1Sth round for him. The third judge gave Spinks a three-point margin.

Bookstore Basketball XV continued second-round play yesterday despite an April snow. While spectators were bundled up on the sidelines, Good News and Bad News beared the elements against Beer Flatulence on the Bookstore courts. Michael Keegan details all the action in his story at right.

Top-seeded teams advance despite weather conditions 
By MICHAEL KEEGAN 
Sports Writer 

Ofcourse it wasn't snowing yesterday. This 
is the middle of April. Yesterday's precipita­
tion was caused by a catastrophic event that 
occurred four years ago. Believe it or not, yes­
terday's Bookstore action was hindered by the 
cosmic ray fallout caused when Bill Murray 
proceeded to blow up the Stay-Puft Marshmal­
low Man. It happens every year in April, just as 
the Bookstore Basketball Tournament gets 
underway. 

Yesterday's action saw four top-seeded 
teams brave the elements and advance into 
the third round. 
On Stepan Court 4 at 4 p.m., Unidentified Grace Defenders defeated Sphinxter and Four Other Orifices by a score of 21-1 I. Steve Takach was red hot for the Unidentified Grace Defenders. He shot 10-of-14 from the field. Dan Sernett provided the rebound power for U.G.D., pulling down 10 boards. 
Because of the marshmallow fallout, statis­tics were unavailable for seeded Showtime's game against Yank My Doodle. In the end, Showtime prevailed by a closer-than-thought score of 2 I-I8. 
On Lyons Court I 2 at 6:1 5 p.m., The Em­harassing Stains, lead by Tim Kempton, faced Kegels and Cutoffs. The Embarassing Stains won by 13 with the final of 21-8. Kempton and Skip Holtz provided the scoring power for the Embarassing Stains. Kempton was 9-of-13 from the field and Holtz was 7-of-12. For Kegels and Cutoffs, Tim Bigham and D.). Doyle missed all of their combined total ofsix shots. 
The final top-seeded team, Much More Manhood, played The Big Blue Vein on Stepan Court 5. Even though the court was slick be­cause of the weather, Much More Manhood dominated the game, easily winning, 21-8. Casey Newell, Joel Williams and Tim Brown played extremely well in the winning effort. All three combined to shot 16-of-26 from the field. For the Big Blue Vein, Paul Bowersock made four of his six shots en route to scoring halfof the team's points. 
In addition to yesterday's cosmic fallout that destroyed the recent spring-like weather, Monk Malloy's dreams of a Bookstore cham­pionship were shattered by the Still Un­touchable team. Still Untouchable defeated Four Sinners and a Monk, 21-13. Malloy's first­round heavenly touch abandoned him yester­day. He shot a less-than-inspired 3-of-10 form the field. His team only made 13 of its 4 7 at­tempts. 
In last week's action, Manangerial Units was the winner of an exciting 31-29 contest. Yes­terday, they were the losers of a less-than­excmng 21-I 3 game. Small Rodent Stimulation easily defeated M.U. with a balanced attack. Mike "Skeets" Gordon, Ed "Stub" Starichak, and Scott (no nickname available) Harder scored 17 of the 21 points.

ND golf team captures second in Indianapolis 
By FRANK HUEMMER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's golf team eagerly awaits its biggest challenge to date, namely the opportunity to compete in the very prestigious Kepler Invitational. This will allow the team to show exactly how good they are as they will challenge some of the best teams in the Midwest, in­cluding Ohio State and Ball State. 
The team comes into this weekend's outing on a high note as they captured second place at the Indianapolis Intercollegiate Golf In­vitational which took place last Sun­day and Monday. Head Golf Coach Noel O'Sullivan was pleased with his team's performance and impressed by Ball State. 
"Although our performance was not spectacular, the placement was very well accepted," he said. "Anytime we can be presented with a runner-up trophy, we will take it. After seeing Ball State's outstanding performance, they definitely have proven that they are one of the strongest teams in the Midwest." 
The Intercollegiate was held on the intimidating Eagle Creek golf course which has a par of 72 and course rating of 73.4 to go along with 6,894 yards filled with water and sand. It was also the site of the 1982 National Public Links Cham­pionship. The tournament consisted of 18 holes which were played on Sunday and then again on Monday. 
Of the nine teams that entered the Intercollegiate, Ball State's 783 led the way while Notre Dame's 812 garnered second. Franklin's 822 and Evansville's 824 rounded out the top four spots. Individually the Irish linksters were led by senior Lon Huf­fman, sophomore Rich Connelly, and senior captain John O'Donovan who all shot 162's. Norm Campbell fired a 165, John Anthony stroked a 166, and Steve Fuhrer shot a 167 to finish out the Irish scoring. 

O'Sullivan spoke highly about the leadership O'Donovan has provided the team. 
"Sometimes the team's perfor­mance does not live up to the coach's and team's expectations," he said. "But John O'Donovan, the Mr. Cool ofthe outfit, helps the younger players feel that their tomorrow will be better. Overall, he is just an out­standing captain and performer. I feel fortunate to have had him for four solid years." 
This weekend O'Donovan will lead the Irish golf team into the Kepler Invitational where last year the Irish squad placed I I th out of 24 teams. This year the Kepler will con­tain 23 teams consisting of I 0 Big Ten schools, I 0 Mid-American schools, and three independents. 
It will be played on the tough Scarlet Course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, located at Ohio State Uni­versity. The Scarlet Course is 7,042 yards long, has a par of 72, and has a par rating of 73.9. It will also be the site of the 1987 NCAA Division I championship. 
The Kepler will be an arduous test of stamina, endurance and con­centration since it is a 54-hole tournament with 27 holes being played on both Saturday and Sunday. However, O'Sullivan believes his team is ready to produce some very fine performances. 
"Our exposure on the Scarlet Course has been very extensive," said O'Sullivan. "Every one of our. players has played this course at least three times. So we have the yardages down for the tournament. 
"We haven't clicked as a team yet and now is the time. We have ap­proached the Kepler with no pressure. We are looking for a good showing. A performance in the top I 0 would be fabulous." 
The Irish will send a five-man team to the Kepler because of the 1986 Division I ruling which calls for schools to go to five-men teams. This may be a slight disadvantage for the team because O'Sullivan feels the Irish are a better six-man squad. However, the linksters will be eagerly awaiting to tackle their big­gest challenge of the season against any odds. 
Nicklaus' sixth Masters title is good news indeed 
Hello again, everybody! 

I was dining with someone a month ago who asked why the sports page never has any good news to report anymore. It was a point well taken, as it does seem that we often have to report on salary disputes, drug and alcohol problems, and other calamities. This man longed for the days when legendary figures graced the sports page for their athletic prowess, and it happened over the weekend. 
jack Nicklaus won the 50th annual Masters golf tourna­ment Sunday. The sport's greatest player won the sport's greatest tournament. All that glittered was truly golden, and things were the way they should be. 
Somehwere among the drooping dogwoods and the soaring Georgia pines that make up the Augusta National Golf Course, the 46-year-old Nicklaus reached back into his golf bag to win golfs most prestigious title for the sixth time. An unprecedented sixth time. To say Nicklaus and Masters in the same breath is to be redundant. 
Nicklaus is one of the few athletes who are recognized by their first name alone. In baseball, you need only say Reggie. In basketball, it's Kareem. In golf, all you need to say is Jack, and you have said it all. 
Oh, there were certainly contenders to this Masters title for jack, but they were more like pretenders on Sunday afternoon. Seve Ballesteros, the dashing young Spaniard, looked ready to lay claim to the title. But Ballesteros' chances splashed and skipped into Rae's Creek along with his second shot on the I 5th hole. A potential birdie became a bogey, and a potential Masters title became a dream. 
Then there was Tom Kite, whose large glasses and curly hair are more reminiscent of an accountant. He had his chance, too, steadily posting birdies and pars on the back nine. Now on the 18th, Kite stroked a birdie putt from 10 feet away, but a resilient blade ofgrass on the left side ofthe cup refused to budge, and the ledger showed one stroke too many. 

Chuck Freeby

.1\na finally, Greg Norman made his challenge. The young Aussie held the lead after the third round, and was charging down the back nine. He birdied 14, 15, 16and 17, and now had crunched his tee shot on 18. A solid approach to the green would put him in position to birdie and win, but instead Norman pushed his four-iron deep into the gallery. It was bye, bye birdie. Moments later, it was goodbye, Masters. 
Let us give these men their due. Ballesteros, Kite and Norman are all excellent golfers. However, they are not masters. Not yet. Not on Sunday anyway. 
The only man in this tournament who could truly lay claim to the title of master was jack Nicklaus, and that is somewhat ironic. The galleries at Augusta used to despise Nicklaus. He was the young man trying to knock off the traditional favorite, Arnold Palmer, and tradition is everything at the Masters. On this Sunday, though, he was Jack, the grand old man of tradition, arid the throngs cheered his every move. 
The people were silent on the par-five 15th, as Nicklaus 
perused every nuance of a 12-foot eagle putt. But the 
silence slowly broke into a building murmur and then 
erupted into a roar as Nicklaus dropped it into a hole with 
one deft stroke. The charge had begun. 
Nicklaus proceeded to the par-three 16th, where he 
played his tee shot as though it were on a string. The ball 
dropped behind the pin and then pulled back towards the 
hole, stopping three feet away. The birdie was imminent, 
and the charge continued. 
At 17, Nicklaus continued his amazing string, holing out 
an 11-footer for another birdie. Now Nicklaus came to the 
par-4 18th and the stillness of Augusta was once again 
broken by a deafening ovation as the Golden Bear strode 
up the fairway to his ball on the green, 40 feet from the cup. 
It was a tricky putt that would have to take a roller-coaster 
ride along the slick grass, but Nicklaus left it three feet from 
the cup and tapped it in. 
The par was made. The charge was over. Now all Nick­
laus could do was sit and wait for the rest of the field to 
come in. And when it did, jack Nicklaus donned the green , jacket again. 
The good old days were back. There is good news again. 
Pick of the Week. The Notre Dame lacrosse 
team will be looking to continue bringing good news this 
weekend when it faces midwestern power Denison in a 
key battle Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Alumni Field. 
The Irish are riding a four-game winning streak into this 
one after yesterday's win over Lake Forest, but they'll need 
continued fine play from senior scoring leaders Joe 
Franklin, Tim Corrigan and Tom Grote. Can they do it? 
Head on out to Alumni and find out for yourselfSaturday.·
