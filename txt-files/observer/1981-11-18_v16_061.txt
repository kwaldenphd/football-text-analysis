Soviet automotive officials have confirmed that a labor dispute occurred in 1980 at the country's largest car plant, in Togliatti, U.S.S.R, but insisted that wokers' complaints were resolved without strikes. Western news reports, quoting unofficial Soviet sources, had said in June 1980 that major strikes disrupted production at the Togliatti plant and nearby Gorky plant in late April or early May. Earlier this week factory officials told Western cor­respondents touring the Togliatti factory that a group of spray­painters held on-the-job "discussions" about their working conditions on the assembly line. Stressing health hazards oftheir job, the workers sought to have their retirement age reduced five years to 45, the pension age for workers in the Soviet chemical industry, the plant officials said. Normal (etirement age for Soviet workers is 60 for men and 55 for women. Instead of lowering the retirement age, plant officials agreed to reduce the time the workers spend inside dust-free rooms applying paint to the car bodies. -AP 
An East German research institute is developing a "memory pill" to help children with learning dis­abilities, the official East Berlin news agency ADN said yesterday. The Institute for Neurobiology and Brain Research at the East Ger­man Academy ofSciences in Magdeburg has worked on the pill for some time, the report said. It quoted Professor Hansjuergen Matthis, the institute's director, as saying transmission from short-term to long-term memory is among the most disturbed functions of the human brain. "This process is supposed to be positively influenced by the new drug," the report said. Though chiefly developed to assist children, the report said, the pill will also have a positive effect on elderly persons. -AP

"Magnetic levitation is a totally new propulsion system that will enable cities to make a quan­tum jump beyond conventional means of intercity rail and road travel," Rene Vansteenkiste, president of Budd's Transit Group, said

New York honored its own Yankee Doodle Dandy yesterday by presenting James Cagney with the key to the city. In a ceremony at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel, Mayor Edward I. Koch told Cagney, "This key opens no doors. It is the key to the hearts of7 million people." Cagney, looking dapper in a blue blazer, white shirt and red tie, had tears in his eyes when the mayor gave him the key, and he thanked Koch in a soft voice. "I'm at that age where I cryeasily," the 82-year-old Cagney said. The mayor also gave Cagney a picture ofEdwin Booth, a 19th century actor. -AP 
A teen-age son of the late Shah ofIran began studies at Mount Greylock Regional High School, a public school, as a "normal" sophomore. School Superintendent Robert Weiser called Ali Pahlavi's enrollment "a compliment to public education." Pah­lavi, 16, will study world culture, honors algebra and honors chemistry, and will study French if an advanced level is offered, school officials said. No special security is planned, according to Edward Filiault, director ofstudent affairs at the school. Pahlavi will live at a family mansion that was bought in 1979 by his older brother, Reza, when he was a student at nearby Williams College, Filiault said.

Reagan arranges sale of satellites to Arabs 
WASHINGTON ( AP) -After one retreat, the Reagan administration is forging aht·ad with the proposed sale of communications satellite gt·ar to an Arab consortium that in­dudes Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Sources told The Associated Press that the proposal, which could stir another fight with Congress on the heels of the $8.5-billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, is being revived even though some senators object w delivering the sophisticated equip· ment to a group whose membership involves hostile clements. 
Informal discussions were set at a secret session with key Senate staff aitles, to be attendee: also by representatives of the Ford Motor Co.. whose Palo Alto, Calif., sub­sidiary would produce key com­ponents of the communications system. The gear would be as­sembled by a French government· owned company, with the necessary satellites launched into orbit by the ~.S. space agency. 
The administration's move could trigger the kind ofscrap that accom­panied the sale ofAirborne Warning and Control System radar planes and other modern weaponry to Saudi Arabia last month. President Reagan narrowly won that battle in the Senate. 
The U.S. share of the satellite and 
communications gear would total 
about $79 million of the overall 
Frcnl·h contract for about S I SO mil­
lion. It would involve two working 
satellites launched by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administra­tion in the mid 1980s. 
The subcontract deal for the Ford Aerospact:. and Communications Corp. was sidetracked two weeks ago when the State Department conceded it was not prepared to answer congressional concerns about potential military application. 


President tours war rooms in Pentagon 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Two days after flying on the military's "Doomsday" President Reagan toured yesterday the Pentagon's top-secret war rooms, where defense officials direct U.S. forces worldwide during crisis. 
Reagan's visit -on the eve of making a major policy speech on medium-range nuclear missJies in Europe -was descibed as a logical followup to his_ flight Sunday on the massive Air Force 747 jet that would serve as a flying commaQd post for the president during nuclear war. 
Reagan conferred over lunch at the Defense Department with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretaries of the military services and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. 
Then, Gen. David C. Jones, chair­man of the joint chiefs, led the tour of the war rooms, briefing the presi­dent as they went.

Senate redrafts bill under veto threat 
WASHINGTON (AP) The Senate Appropriations Committee, working under a very strong veto threat from the White House, began yesterday to redraft a massive, House-passed money bill to keep the federal government in business after midnight Friday. 
Even before the panel began its work, sources said the White House relayed word that President Reagan was likely to veto the measure un­less it contained a 5 percent across­the-board spending cut. There 
appeared little chance Congress would meet those terms, officials agreed. 
But at the same time, both sides were equally agreed that Reagan had the strength to sustain a veto. Chair­man Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., of the Senate panel said if that occurs, Congress "will have to stay in ses­sion ... around the clock" rather than taking its scheduled Thanksgiving recess late this week. 
The White House said the dis­agreement was over budget cuts, largelystalled since Reagan unveiled a new austerity plan in September. 
But Republican and Democats 
alike in Congress said Reagan also 
hoped to use the situation to regain 
the initiative in fighting for his em­
battled economic program. 
"It makes him look like a macho 
man, I guess," said House 
Democratic Leaderjames Wright, D­
Texas. 
"They just want to veto a bill," said one Republican official, asking not to be quoted by name. 
The measure is necessary because Congress has not yet completed ac­tion on any of the 12 regular ap­propriations bills that fund the executive branch departments or the judiciary. An existing interim measure expires Friday at midnight. 
The House rejected a proposed 5 percent cut when it passed its own $440-billion version of the bill on Monday. 
Officials said the 5 percent cut wasn't likely to succeed in the GOP­controlled Senate, either.

At the Central Park East School, meals are served family style. Fifth and sixth grade students feed young­er children, setting up tables, serv­ing the food and cleaning up afterward, saving untouched milk and fruit for snacks in the afternoon. 
"It works out well," said Mark Lutsky, assistant director ofthe CPE lunch program. "It gives them a sense of responsibility -you don't get nothing for nothing, and if you want to eat you have to help clean up." 
"Instead of crowding up and pus­hing and shoving, it's nice to sit down and be served," said Danielle Hernandez, 12; a sixth grader, as she munched on a baloney-and-cheese hero sandwich during a recent lunch hour. 
The school newspaper, the CPE news, devoted much of its first fall issue to a look at the school lunch program, and to criticism of Reagan budget cuts in that area. One stu­dent, Monifa Edmondson, wrote that the lunchroom "has very few problems and there are some good things about it, too." 
But she's not sold on the cooks. "They just don't care. I imagine all sorts of things happening to the food," she said. "They sometimes act mean and even grouchy. Those are my opinions."

AVISIT TO THE WOODSHED 


The emperor has no clothes 
John Kennedy once said that the 
worse President Eisenhower did, the 
more people liked him. That was not really true of Eisenhower, but it seems to be the rule for Reagan. This emperor can make people con­centrate so raptly on his smile that no one notices he has, intellectually, no clothes on. The evidence of in­coherence and incompetence piles up, largely unnoticed. In his latest press conference we were treated to 
the following Reaganisms: 
I. The president said he would not repeat what he told editors about theater nuclear weapons. Then he repeated it. 
2. 
This time, though, he men­tioned the possibility of limited nuclear war and added that he is "optimistic" -presumably about its not spreading. 

3. 
Asked about demonstration nuclear explosions, Reagan managed to say he was ignorant on this subject and, nonetheless, to add a fourth government position to the confu­ston. Secretary Haig, you will remember, said that such a demonstration was still being con­sidered. Sectretary Weinberger said it was not. The White House 


"clarified" that the demonstration once was considered, but is no lon­ger. Reagan differed from all three by saying, "Well, that, there ·seems to be some confusion as the whether that is still a part of NATO's strategy or not. And so far, I've had no answer to that." Which means the White House statement should not be trusted, according to the highest White House official. 
4. Th president excused his ig­~nce by saymg, .. I have nott-been

a party to the contigency planning of NATO that has gone on now for ap­proximately 30 years." By that logic, he can have no opinion on any­thing the government did before he took office. 
5. 
He referred to two hopeful points in the Saudi peace plan ­which proved to be the same point. 

6. 
He told one of his campaign­type stories about the evil of "regulations" that keep a Medicaid patient in the hospital when she could be cared for less expensively at home. He did not reflect, obviously, on the fact that provison for having care at home as well as in hospitals would increase regulations, not decrease them. (How do you decide who should be treated where, and when?) 

7. 
When a reporter tried to move from the campaign anecdote to the specifics of the Reagan administra­tion's Medicaid proposals, Reagan had to admit he did not know what those proposals are. 

8. 
Not only did Reagan not know the specifics of the proposals of his own secretary of health and human services. When asked how he felt about them in general, he had to give this lame answer: " I feel that we have to look at these programs to see what we can do." 

9. 
Reagan made the ludicrous ­and promptly laughed at-assertion that his squabbling administration is one big happy family. 

10. 
He resorted to the Nixon device for proving that he has a sound foreign policy. He gave us the num­ber of foreign leaders he has met. 


I I . He told the press to consider what is in the national interest before

printing stories about his adinistra­
tion -a suggestion John Kennedy 
made after the Bay of Pigs failure, 
only to be criticized for seeking to 
impose self-censorship on the press, 
making it the government's spokes­
man rather than its independent 
critic. President Reagan talks of get­
ting the government off people's 
backs; but his administration wants 
to put it on the backs of those who 
criticize government in any way but 
Reagan's way. 
The performance was dazzling in one sense. He looked terrific while talking nonsense. He clearly does not know that he docs not know what he is saying; and neither does much of his audience. 
Jimmy Carter, however, at this stage of his presidency was still well­liked as a person and approved of overall. But suspicions of incom­petence were growing, hints of trouble were getting confirmed. And the same is happening to Reagan. In the Gallup Poll for October, 56 per­cent of the people still approve of Reagan's performance; yet 53 per­cent disapprove of the way he has handled unemployment, and the growing dismay over the economy is registered on inflation as well ( 48 percent disapproving, to 44 approv­ing ). One cannot stay naked forever without people's beginning to notice.

Theatre Review 
-· 

yet in Nikolai Gogol's 150-year-old satire of Russian provincial bureaucracy. The play works well even today, despite its dislocations in time, space, and circumstance, be­cause the faces offolly that Gogo! shows us are generically human ones. A fool's a fool, regardless ofhis century, and Gogo! sketchesa whole catalogue ofthem to aT. 
The "Inspector General" has all the elements ofan entertaining theatrical experience. And if a viewer were also to be left somehow with an uneasy apprehension at the play's end, that for Gogo!, re fools, it takes one to know one, then a production would have achieved the playwright's aim. 
Set in "Such and Such a Town," a place so unequivocally provincial that one might "ride for three years without coming to another country," "The Inspector General" holds up to ridicule the petty and not-so-petty corruptions ofthe town's officialdom. A recklessly crooked bureaucracy was indeed a major fact oflife in 19th century Russia, and any reader ofRussian his­tory will attest to how surprisingly little the play exaggerates reality. 
The plot is simple: the town's offi­
cials, each one a fraud ofsome stripe 
or other, learn that an inspector 
general (even, oh greatest of 

worries, an inspector general incog­
nito) has their town on his inspec­
tion list. Knowing what they do 
about their own situation, they un­
derstandably panic, then incorrectly 
identify a visitor to their town as the 
inspectorgeneral and proceed to try 
to impress and/or suborn him. The 
visitor is ofcourse himselfa shyster: 
when crooks meet crook the fun 
begins in earnest. 

Amore than adequate production 
by director Leonard Powlick and his 
large cast generally serves the play 
well. Some nineteen actors are in­
volved (and that's with several in­
stancesofdouble casting); as is to be 
expected, there's some unevenness of performance. But the cast is well rehearsed; even the less gifted add their part. Gogol's characterizations are broad, essentially caricatures, and amusing even without subtlety ofrole interpretation. 
Those players who did go beyond the obviousin their parts did so with great success and deserve special commendation. Susan Gosdick, in her portrayal ofAnna Andreyevna, offered a bravura blend oftight­nostriled gentility and lip-licking lechery, to the audience's delight. Joan Quinlan's handling ofthe bumbleheaded daughter was deft, as vacuous as Gogo! could have wished. John Davenport, in a relatively small role, won well­deserved applause for his second-act portrayal ofvanal indecision, surely one ofthe best-conceived turns of his ND/SMC career. 

The Tweedledee-Tweedledum set ofPaul Clay and Daniel Moran worked together well; Clay's Dob­chinsky was especially inspired, a man for whom it's all somehow too much. And Sean Faircloth handled the demanding role ofthe pseudo­inspector general with aplomb and charm. Ifhis moustache made him look occasionally like Groucho Marx, all to the good -Gogo! and Groucho generally work the same side ofthe street. 
The players were, as a whole most amiable, a delight to watch. And there's a bit ofa problem. Can these really be corrupt folks? 
In general, if I have one quibble with Powlick's conception ofthe play, it is that he has cosmeticized, rendered more acceptable, some fairly nasty types. This imaginary garden does have real spiders in it, ugly ones. Missing in this production is the nastiness, the real squalor, that Gogo! went to great lengths to present in his equally comic novel DeadSouls. In "The Inspector 
General" even the most miscreant 
character is likeable, beginning and 
end. 
The pleasantness extends to other aspects ofthe production as well. Thomas Left's set, while showing flashes ofthe bad taste that Gogo! (apparently with excellent reason) unfailingly ascribed to the bureacracy, is perhaps too attractive for the play, almost charming. The acres ofplastic potted palms are a step in the right direction, but Leff is in a way a victim ofhis own sense of good proponion and balance. Yet the set, even iftoo good for the likes ofthem, is entirely playable; the transformation for Act I scene II is an especially ingenious piece ofwork. 
Ellyn Brannick's costuming deserves analogous comment: some ofit is just too good. Osip, the pseudo-inspector's man-servant, is a vision in an apricot tunic, looking more like a Pan-slavic Mr. Clean than the flea-bitten character the script refers to him as. Some ofthe male characters are positively dapper. But for these lapses Brannick is more than forgiven thanks to the inspired tackiness oftwo wonderful gowns -"the flowered one" and "my but­tercup yellow." They quite take the breath away. 
What with genial players, a color­ful production, lots ofgood humor and lively pacing, "The Inspector General" is a delight to see -and I recommend it as the entertainment bargain ofnext weekend. But some­thing's missing. 
In reference to the play, Powlick quotes an old proverb: "No use blaming the mirror ifyour face is crooked." Powlick clearly realizes that ultimately Gogo! is self­reflexive, like all satirists wonh their rapiers. It's not just the folks out there, the clods in "Such and Such a Town," who are fools, but your own blue-eyed self. That's just the dimen­sion this charming production of "The Inspector General" doesn't quite serve. But for good fun, you can't beat it.

The Observer --Features 
The innocence of little children 
n this hustle and bustle ofIa1.:ademia, I recently pondered the thought of how little children view the world. Their sense ofinnocence and wonderment surpasses the kvel 
ii"iiNiWfilll:&:li1;:~J.~;ill,;~tm~ 
Gregory Swiercz Features Editor 
Reflections 
of most college students. Seeing the pure, ever-trusting face ofchildren is sad, for one day they will lose 
some, if not all of that sense ofwon­
derment that allows children to 
believe in Santa Claus, Popeye, and 
Kermit. 
I sometimes wonder how it must 
have felt to be innocent. Everyone 
has been innocent at one time in his 
life. For most, it is early in one's 
childhood. Society shows that 
"child" is many times synonymous 
with"innocent." Ifa person is called 
a "child," they are labeled as im­
mature, naive, and unknowing. 
Last week I was sitting in my 
favorite neighborhood laundromat 
reading my Faulkner. Amid the 
sound and the fury of the washing 
machines, two children gleefully 
played in the waiting area. 
After ten minutes ofplay, one of 
the children picked up a book and 
sat down in a chair next to mine. I beamed at the thought ofsomeone mimicking me. 
"Hi." 
"Hello. What do you have there?" 
"A book." 
"Ooo, that's nice." 
The little girl began to 

meticulously turn the pages, making sure to verbally describe every picture on the page. Her vocabulary limited her into depleting anything she saw as either a boy, a girl, or a cow. I chuckled after she called "man's best friend" a cow. I was impressed with her understanding of Indian culture. 
Her little playmate, intrigued by the little girl's literary expertise, sat down beside her and instantly became her echo. 
"Gimme the book," the boy pleaded. 
"Wait, we'll share," the girl 

returned. I silt:ntly thanked the girl's 
mother for she evidently is doing a 
heck ofa job ofchild-rearing. 
The two sat there describing 

every illustration, playing "can you 
top this?" With every turn of the 
page, the children became more and 
more giddy. Their voices began to 
drown out the drone of the 
machines. 
All ofa sudden, a silence fell over 

the two. I peeked over to sec them 
looking at a full-page illustration of 
the Nativity. 
The girl was the first to speak. "Look, this is you." She was pointing to a small black shepherd boy. 
Not to be outdone, the boy spotted a girl in the pinure and proudly stated "Hey look. Here's you too!" 
The two, getting bored the way children usually do, ran over and sat in front ofthe dryers, pretending the kaleidoscope ofwet garments was "Sesame Street." 
The innocence of the pair of children forced me to think about the first time I realized that I had lost my sense of wonderment. I couldn't recall it. I'm not sure that many people could. It seems that at the point ofrealizing that innocence is lost, a person begins to take life's events as facts. Attitudes and beliefs form without the objective, in­nocent review the two children showed me. It seems necessary to lose your innocence in order to ex­ist in this world. 
I hope the world fails to dispel the 
innocence ofthese two children 
from the laundromat. I hope they get 
the chance to cling to this necessary 
and worthwhile virtue. In the world 
today, there will be many obstacles 
to overcome in order for children to 
maintain their innocence. Their 
youth is fleeting; may their in­
nocence be sustained.

to be Christians ? 
n a sermon delivered recently on campus, the celebrant asked theIquestion,"Do we have time to be Christians?" Sadly enough, Idon't believe we allow ourselves the time. We take time out each day to study, eat, and sleep. We are all on schedules. 
It bas to be that way. We are tested to the point that we find our­selves in a vicious cycle oftest, recover,test, recover,... We have to do well, because we have to be marketable when this mess is over. "After I've completed this four years ofwork, I'll go on to graduate school, get a good job offer, then I'll relax and appreciate life. Then I will have time to apply my Christian values to daily activity." Sound familiar? 
In essence, we are puttinglifeon bold for a while. Yet, we are fools 
to believe that our time in the future will be any less demandin~ ofus 
than it is now. What we do now, the Christian values we incorporate 
into our lives here, represent ~ , 
the type ofChristians we will · · 
be later. 
Mike Berry
It is easy to see that as Chris· tians we are in a constant struggle with our environ­ment and society's expecta­
tions. A child is taught to be strong and cold because the world itself will be this way. Why? Why can't we teach our children that they 
need not become a part ofa cold and heartless society? 
Children are our greatest examples. They are born with such love and curiosity and feeling, but the world changes them. The world changes us. 
Like a child at an early age, we were anxious to become a part of Notre Dame. We lookedtoward to enriching ourselves spiritually and socially. We had that love and curiosity and feeling. We had energy and youth and determination, and we couldn't wait to em­bark on what would be a meaningful path. Yet the path too many of us keep is a triangular one, running from the library to the dining hall to our dorms. Each time we run to the library when we know our roommate has a troubled mind, we are telling the world that it has broken that spirit oflove and concern we had. We are saying the world is much larger than us, so we must conform to its ways, harsh as they may be. 
We don't have to be cold like the world. We can use our intel­ligence and determination to mmake the valuesofloving and caring regain their significance. We can once again be the controllers ofour environment, not the controlled. 
Theophastus said, "Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend." This is more valuable than any amount of money or riches. We have the time. Let us give ourselves the chance to use this time to be Christians, to open our hearts and cars as well as our textbooks. Let us take life offbold.

F
riday the I 3th defied its unlucky traits for those who attended the Head East -Off Broadway -Sten­cil Forest concert held at Morris Civic Auditorium. The crowd was 
By Brian Krueger 
treated to a showcase oiprogressive rock that is rarely seen in one con­cert. 
Stencil Forest, an up-and-coming band from Elkhart, Indiana, brought the crowd immediately to its feet despite the fact that most of the fans had not previously experienced the band. Trying to break out ofthe Top­40 grind that most local clubs demand, this was their first real chance to exhibit a completely original set. 
A highlight of their short set was "Celestial Voices," a resonant tunc in the styk ofYes, a major influence on the group's composer Cassella. This song brought forth the talent of Cassella's younger brother, Rick, on keyboards. 
Unfortunately, Stencil Forest was 
:ut off after their fourth song, though they had planned on playing eight. It seemed that backstage con­fusion unjustly deprived the crowd offully experiencing the band. Ab­sent was the group's hot single, "Opening Act," (which has received local radio play) and their chance to plug their debut album ofthe same name, which wil debut in mid­February. 
After a prolonged intermission, Chicago's own Off Broadway hit the stage. It was clear from the start that they intended to strip away the critics appraisal ofbeing only a studio band. They transformed "Bad Indication," a timid track offtheir "ON" album into a high energy con­cert opener. 
As the crowd warmed up, lead singer CliffJohnson supplied proof ofhis vocal ability. Two tracks of their new Quick Turns album, 
"Automatic" and "Showdown," allowed johnson to show off his unique voice. Unfortunately, their top-40 hit, "Stay in Time." was plagued by sound troubles but was carried by the roar of the crowd sin­
ging the refrain. Johnson's physical and vocal 
acrobatics during the closing num­ber sent the crowd into a rage which did not subside until Off Broadway 
returned for a well-deserved encore. 
The headline band, "Head East," failed to live up to their billing, but managed to hold the crowd with their hits ofyesteryear. Head East had been restructured recently to fill the gaps left by the departure of three ofthe band's five members which left only the frame ofdrum­mer Steve Huston and keyboard player Roger Boyd. 
Although they opened big with "Can't Stop Me," they lost the crowd's enthusiasm as they coursed 

1 into a set ofprimarily new material. People merely sat back and waited until their favorites arrived. 
"Love Me Tonight," one of those favorites, proved disappointing as lead singer Dan Odom tried to dupl­icate john Schlitt's original record­ing rather than using his own style. Nonetheless, the crowd was happy to hear some familiar sounds. 
The "old faithfuls" finally arrived as "Since You Been Gone" and "Never Been Any Reason" sent the crown into a frenzy. Odom handled 
the lyrics in character. rather than trying to synthesize Schlitt again. 
Deserving an encore, they played an energetic 12-minute version of "Elijah," but again wooed the crowd to sleep with two new songs, "Never Be The Same" and "Take My Hand" to close the show. 
It is obvious that Head East must evaluate their position to determine whether they will continue produc­ing sub-par music at the expense of their classics or ifthey will bow out gracefully, allowing themselves to retain the star status they achieved so long ago. It is my hope they adjust toward the latter. 
Although the concert was filled with ups and downs, the sheer variety oftalent exhibited on stage will stay on as a memory that will not be soon forgotten. Each band's style provided a showcase of musical flavor that can only be generated in a concert setting. The night proved to be the future , present, and past (in that order) ofprogressive rock in the U.S.

really progressed. 
"We've simplified our offense un­believeably," he continued. "As a result, we made only two mental er­rors in blocking assignments against Georgia Tech, and four against Air Force. Out of 60-70 plays a game, that's pretty good." 
Though the Irish cut out a lot of tht· backfield shifting they did earlier this year, Faust hopes to bring back some of the movement that went on between the scrimmage line and the sideline. "We eventually want to get back to platooning," he revealed. "And we almost did it in the Air Force game. But we've got to know the system a little better, and we've got to get dt:<:per to do that." 
And they've got to keep their 
momentum going ifthe Irish hope to 
take a 7-4 record to a bowl game this 
year. "These kids deserve to finish 7­

NEW YORK (AP)-Slugger Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies was elected yesterday as the Nation; al League's Most Valuable Player for the second straight year by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Schmidt, an overwhelming choice in the balloting, became only the third National League player to win consecutive MVP awards. 
A unanimous winner of the award last year when he also was named the World Series MVP, Schmidt received 21 of a possible 24 first­place votes and 321 poin~s from the BBWAA panel, consisting of two writers from each NL city. 
Like Schmidt, runner-up Andre Dawson of Montreal was named on all 24 ballots, receiving two first­place votes and 215 points. The only other player to get a first-place vote was rookie pitcher Fernando Valen­zuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who was named the NL's Cy Young 
Award winner by the BBWAA last week. 
The only other consecutive win­ners of the NL MVP award were Ernie Banks of the Chicago Cubs in 1958-59 and Joe Morgan of the Cin­cinnati Reds in 1975-76.

Roger Maris ( 1960-1961 ), Mickey Mantle ( 1956-1957), Yogi Berra ( 1954-1955), Hal Newhouser (1944-1945) and Jimmy Foxx ( I932-1933}won consecutive MVP awards in the American League. 
Although seven weeks of play were lost in the strike-shortened 1981 season, Schmidt accumulated impressive statistics. Playing in 102 games, he slammed 31 home runs and drove in 91 runs, leading the major leagues in both categories, while batting .316, the highest average ofhis career. 
It marked the fifth time in eight years that Schmidt has led the majors in homers. 
The 32-year-old third baseman had 19 doubles and two triples among his 112 hits and scored 78 runs. He also stole 12 bases and led the NL in seven offensive categories. 
The 31 homers gave Schmidt 295 for the past eight years, the top production for any major league player over that period. His 48 home runs last year set ·a major league record for third basemen, breaking the mark of 47 set by Hall of Farner Eddie Mathews. 
Montreal catcher Gary Carter was sixth this year with 77 points, trail· ing Schmidt, Dawson, Cincinnati's George Foster, third with 146, Dave Concepcion of Cincinnati, fourth with 108, and Valenzuela, who finished fifth with 90.

Barring some unexpected outcomes on Saturday, the Jan. l picture looks like this: No. I Pitt against Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, No. 2 Clemson and seventh-ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, Alabama vs. the SWC representative -SMU can win the title but is eligible for a bowl game -in Cotton.

If Michigan and Washington win, they will meet in the Bowl.· That probably would send Washington to the Holiday Bowl against the Brigham Young-Utah winner.

Houston also ltas a shot at the Sun Bowl against Oklahoma. The Sooners had said they would stay home if they lose to Nebraska on Saturday but had a change ofheart. 
There was a strong report that the Bluebonnet Bowl had locked in UCLA and Ohio State, despite a gentleman's agreement among all bowls that only the Rose could match the Big Ten against the Pac­IO. 
The Liberty Bowl has taken Iowa, with Navy now rumored to be the Hawkeyes' opponent. There had been talk of Notre Dame, provided the Irish beat Penn State Saturday and thereby guarantee them. selves a winning season. 
Tennessee and Wisconsin were locked into the Garden State Bowl yesterday. The Hall ofFame has Mis­sissippi-State and doesn't really care who the opposition is because the Bulldogs guarantee a large crowd. Navy had been mentioned as a pos­sibility there but the latest reports say it may be Kansas or even South Carolina, which could wind up 6-6 but would bring loads offans. 
The Peach Bowl will pair West
