Budget decides salary increases 
by Maureen Flynn St>nior Starr Reporter 
The percentage increase in faculty salaries for 1976-1977 cannot be determined until spring, according to Fr. James T. Burt­chaell. university provost. Burt­ehaell stated yesterday that work on next year's budget has just begun. 
"The Budget Priorities Com­mittee is just beginning its work," Burtchaell said. "They will be working all through the winter. We won't know about precise figures until next fall." 
The University Provost com­mented on a report from the Faculty Senate Committee on Faculty Affairs, in which it was noted that average Notre Dame faculty salaries lag behind those of both the Big Ten schools and other "peer institutions." 
Notre Dame faculty salaries actually rank in the midst of those of the "peer institutions," Burt­chaell said, because some of those schools pay lower salaries. The peer group used in the comparison includes Vanderbilt, Cornell, Duke, Northwestern, Indiana, Southern California, St. Louis University, Iowa, Emory and Pittsburgh. Figures were taken from the American Association of University Professors <AAUP> Summer Bulletin, 1975. 
The University Provost noted that nine out of the Big Ten schools receive funds from their state legislatures. "Institutions that have more money can pay higher salaries," he stated. 
Burtchaell reaffirmed his higher salaries and offer better

To protect valuables 
Tallarida warns students 
by Jim ('ommyn Staff Reporter 
Director of Off Campus Housing 

Fr. Thomas Tallarida called for off 
campus residents to "use their 
heads" about protecting valuables 
over the Thanksgiving vacation. 
"Students must think ahead," 

Tallarida said, "and take the 
necessary precautions, par­
ticularly if they are not going to be 
in the South Bend area for the 
break." 
Tallarida urged off campus 

students to take home most of their 
valuables or to make 
arrangements to leave them on 
campus with a friend. "All items, 
whether they are stored on campus 
or left off campus, should be 
marked in some manner," he said. 
In addition, Tallarida stressed 

the importance of having 
valuables insured. "Depending on 
parent's insurance is not enough anymore,"he explained. 
Tallarida added that students 

should notify their neighbors that 
they will be away so that mail and 
papers will not pile up making the 
house an easy target for a rob­
berty. "House sitters are another 
possibility," Tallarida suggested. 
Tallarida continued and 
discussed the South Bend crime statistics pertaining to off campus students. 
In September valuables worth $7700 were taken from off campus students' homes. In October items worth $7800 were reported stolen. 
"Thus far in November," Tallarida said, "over $4000 in valuables has been stolen." Tallarida indicated that this total comes only from two robberies. 
"Students appear to be hit a greater number of times than other residents," Tallarida said. ''They are vulnerable and that fact is showing up in police statistical reports." 
Tallarida went on to explain a new program his office has In­stituted to check each home for its crime prevention features. 
"Windows seem to be the main way of access for burglars," Tallarida explained. His staff has started compiling a checklist of where windows are located in the house, the doors and the basement. Tallarida emphasized the need for adequate locks on all parts of the house as well. 
"Leases are also a bit of a problem this year," Tallarida added. "Students don't seem to be reading the lease thoroughly before signing it." 
Tallarida cited two exculpatory 
clauses within leases students 
actually signed. Clauses of this 
type absolve the owner of guilt in 
certain matters, specifically those 
involving negligence. 
"The law frowns on this type of 
phrasing," Tallarida pointed out. 
"Some owners are still using them, 
apparently, and students who are 
unaware sign them anyway. That's 
what really gets to me." 
One clause reads as follows: "In the event that the premises are a portion of a building,containing more than one unit, tenant agrees to abide by any and all house rules, whether promulgated before or after the execution here of, in­cluding, but not limited to, rules with respect to noise, odors, disposal of refuse, pets, parking and use of common areas." 
Tallarida explained that clauses of this type do not allow the students any freedom to live his own life in any way. 
Another clause reads: "Owner shall not be liable for any damage or injury to tenant or any other person, or to any property oc­curing on the premises, or any part thereof, or in common areas thereof and tenant agrees to hold owner harmless from any claims for damages no matter how caused." 
Clauses of this type put an inordinate amount of the responsibility on the student tenant when the weight belongs on the owner, Tallarida said. 
Tallarida pointed out that not all the occupants of each house have signed the lease. "If there are groups living together, everyone must sign the lease and be responsibible for his own con­duct," Tallarida said. In the past some tenants have had one student accepting all responsibility, in­cluding financial burdens, for every one in the house. 
"In the future I expect to see only one name on any given lease only if that person is living alone," Tallarida said. 
Students desiring to move off campus for the second semester should check with the off campus housing before finalizing any plans. Students who are thinking of changing their current off campus residence should also check with Tallarida before doing anything. 
"I don't want the students to 
become paranoid," Tallarida said. 
"I just want them to understand all 
sides of the off campus· housing situation." · ' · · · ·

These glee club members do a little high kicking in last night at Washington Hall. a bicentennial salute to George M. in the concert CPhoto by Tom Lose) 
Glee Club sings at Washington 
by John Hannan Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame Glee Club sang and danced their way into the hearts of a packed Washington Hall audience last night. 
The beginning of the program was highlighted by Petrarchian verse and the traditional Glee Club fare, including one latin standard, "Ave, Color Vini Clari." 
The show picked up speed from there and moved into the first the­eatrical section with a Bicen­tennial salute to George M. Coahn, featuring a seven man group wearing garters, skimmers and vests. Composed of Cohan's famous songs and a sharp choreography, the skit received intermittent applause and cap­tured the crowd with a firework 

studded finale of "Your a Grand Old Flag." 
The second skit taken from "West Side Story," immediately followed. It was a vignette titled "Gee, Officer Krupke", featuring a human couch, a heavily accented German psychiatrist <"zocial dizease" l, and well received slapstick. 
The intermission was led into by a round of Irish songs, highlighted by "Danny Boy." 
The second half of the show opened with an arrangement of "Let Us Break Bread", by David Isele, director of the Glee Club. Isele did an interesting job of the familiar arranging Mass staple. 
The all male club was then joined by two ladies, Mary Mills and Annette Conklin, to sing Brah­m's "Rhapsody Opus 53". 
"Drill Ye Tarriers" a humorous piece, also by Isele, led into the last of the Glee Club's skits: "A Metropolitan Medley,'' performed by six of the clubbers, it featured "Chatanooga Choo Choo", "Chicago, Chicago" and "New York, New York". 
Judging the audiences reacton,

Burtchaell speaks on sex 
by Phil Cackley Starr Reporter 

Fr. James T. Burtchaell, University provost, spoke to the residents of Holy Cross Hall on the topic of human sexuality Tuesday night, stressing the commitment involved in sexual exchange. 
Burtchaell began his talk by paraphrasing two portions of the 19th chapter of Matthew's gospel. The first was concerned with verses 16 to 30, of which the central verse is verse 24: "It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." 
This applies to everything, in­cluding a home, a mother, father. and wife. as well as money, Burt­ehaell said. 
The second set of verses he paraphrased were verses 3 to 12, concerned with the subject of divorce, which Christ opposed totally. This was in direct op­
position to the Jewish law. 

In both instances Christ was doing far more than answering specific questions directed at him, Burtchaell said. He was, in effect, setting up a new religion for the .hws. "He invites them to faith to 
a person, Himself, instead of obedience to a Jaw," Burtchaell explained. 
"This is a difficult faith, he said, because it is an "open-ended faith" in which you don't know what you're promising." Following a law is much simpler because Pverything is spelled out. 
For mock convention 
Co1n1nittee announces plans 
The Mock Convention Executive Committee yesterday announced the cancellation of its Public Platform Hearing on Nov. 20. The reason the hearing was cancelled was because there are too many other activities planned for this night. 
The topic was "Decriminaliza­tion of Marijuana." The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 
p.m. in the Memorial Library Auditorium. 
The Executive Committee also announced the scheduling of the opening address speaker and the keynote speaker. 
The Opening Address Speaker will be Hobert S. Strauss, chair­man of the Democratic Natimtal <'ommittee. 
Strauss served as the National Committeeman from Texas from l!llill-1972 during which time her served as Co-Chairman of the llumphrey-Muskie Committee in Texas. In March 1970 Strauss was l'lected Treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. In December 1972 he was elected Chairman of the National Com­mittee. Strauss is married and is the father of three children. 
Congressman Donald W. Riegle Jr. will serve as the keynote speaker for the Convention.

Marriage is very similar to this type of faith, Burtchaell said. It is giving one's self completely to another person with an open-ended 
faith.  Christ  rejected  the  old  
Jewish  conception  of  marriage  
which  was  baSed  on  law  and  
allowed divorce.  

Burtchaell commented that he didn't "think that the Church should describe marriage with divorce as an evil thing". This is not an evil form of marriage, he said, but is a far less demanding form. and consequently worse people result from such a union. 
He stressed that marriage is a valuable institution which forces people to grow. He said that in marriage Christ provides a new way to be a believer. "It is one of the most important institutions for turning a person inside out, from being selfish to selfless," Burt­chaell added. 
Stx in marriage 
"Sex and marriage are one," he stated, moving to the role of sexual exchange in marriage, and sexual exchange in general. It is a surrender of privacy in which something personal is shared and becomes part of both persons, he said. 
Fidelity is the keynote in this sharing and it is possible to have in such fidelity a deeper meaning to sex than the satisfaction of physical desires, he commented. Sex releases a deeper and more fulfilling sharing than can be found 


Congressman 
Congressman Riegle was born in 1938 and first elected to the House in 1966. He was named one of the Two Best Congressman for the year 1967 by the Nation Magazine. He also was named by Time 1\htgazine in July, 1974 as one of the top 200 national leaders under the age of 45 across the United States. 
Riegle presently served as a member of the House Committee on International Affairs. He is also author with T. Armbrister of 0 CONGRESS, a best-selling diary of Congressional life. 
PPY 

in the important but rather mundane incidents of sharing and caring which take place in everyday life. 
Burtchaell emphasized that sex is very demanding because of this deepness. "If people don't get that straight they are less human beings," he said. Sex and intimacy bring permanance because "sex craves commitment," he added. 
Promiscuity is bad, he said, but an affair is worse because it is untruthful --"It pretends per­manence and belonging without the reality." There is a truth to sex which is total surrender, Burt­chaell asserted. 
Burtchaell spoke for about a half -hour to the audience of 25 residents. Following this there was a question and answer period lasting one and a half hours during which there was considerable interaction between the provost and the residents. 
In response to a question if marriage meant it was good to only love a spouse while blotting out love for all others, Burtchaell said he felt this was merely a means of disguising a method for fulfilling selfishness. 
ND-SMC marriages 

He added that people who live in religious communities can fall prey to the same sort of problem, that they can feel as though they are surrendering themselves to a group, while merely providing for their own needs.

Fr. Burtchaell commented that fidelity Is the key to marital sharing and can lead to a deeper meaning of sex than of physical desires. 
Another question was if it is true that some 80 percent of marriages between Notre Dame and St. Mary's graduates end in divorce. Burtchaell said this could not be true, because he knew over 20 percent of those married himself and they were not divorced. 
A formal study on this subject has been done only for Notre Dame graduates, of whom he said only 
1.5 percent were divorcees. He said a more comprehensive study could probably be done. 
When asked if the students would be informed if the results of such a poll might indicate that there was a high rate of divorces between ND-SMC graduates, Burtchaell hesitated and then answered yes, adding humorously "But we should forgive you to date."

Burtchaell commented, "There isn't anything wrong with con­traceptives, as long as they are not abortives." He said abortion is homicide. 
Joe Corpora, of Notre Dame Right to Life, asked if he thought the use of contraceptives leads to the practice of abortion on demand. Burtchaell said no. that the only tie between the two was that they were both methods of preventing the birth of children. 
Burtchaell stressed at several points in his talk that he feels the role of the Church should be to better prepare people for the "immense demands of marriage." "Our job is to have a much greater presentation of what marriage is," he said. 
After the talk Burtchaell mass in the Holy Cross

TV pays the salaies for the big leagues 
In the present-day crunch of soaring prices, sky-high sala­ries and tight money, TV pays the freight for most, if not all, of the big sports teams. It is responsible for the multimil­lion-dollar contracts handed out to the Joe Namaths and Catfish Hunters. It is a source of sur­vival. 
A $42 million contract with NBC saved the old American Football League and enabled it to negotiate a merger with the National Football League. The World Football League, with no major network TV, folded. 
The American Basketball As­sociation, with such interesting personalities as Julius Irving, Artis Gilmore and David Thompson, failed to get a TV t'Ontract. The result has been loss of important franchises and a mad effort to make some sort of marriage with the NBA. 
Soccer. the most popular sport in the world but not yet a great crowd-pleaser in the United States, hasn't managed to interest the networks. Hock­{'Y has similarly suffered. 
Network officials contend that hockey, like soccer, has only regional interest. 
"Hockey is the least depend­ent of all sports on network television," said Don Ruck, NIIL executive. "The NHL has the highest saturation of its seating capacity and box office support." 
The networks are at some variance on exactly what is sa­lable on the market. They all agree that the big event-the World Series, the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, the Mas­ters golf tournament, Wimble­don tennis-will continue to Iure the sponsor dollar. Their ideas run different directions when they get down to the low­er echelon. 
Carl Lindemann, sports boss at NBC, for instance, is a strong believer in presenting events without frills. "The game is the thing," he insists. He also is a stout booster of live TV-his network does con­
$6000 collected for Third World at ND and SMC 
Nearly $6000 has been raised this semester for the hungry of the Third World through the dining hall collection drive of AI Sondej and Greg Gramelspacher. 
Sondej has collected $4700 at the Notre Dame dining halls and Gramelspacher has raised $1200 in daily collections at St. Mary's. 
Sondej and Gramelspacher end collections on both campuses today. They will participate this weekend in the National Univer­sity Conference on Hunger in Austin, Texas. Basil O'Leary, of the Program in Non-Violence, and junior Chris Brinegar will also represent Notre Dame at the conference.

siderably more than the other two. 
Bob Wussler, the young head of CBS sports, argues that sports programming must be diversified enough to appeal also to the women and the young people in the house. So he has spiced up his shows with aesthetic music numbers and pretty faces. 
Arledge, the ABC dynamo who introduced Monday Night Football and is making ges­tures toward trying to monopo­lize the business, has a scatter­shot philosophy. His "Wild World of Sports" jumps from a bus-leaping contest in Cincin­nati to an auto demolition der­by in Texas. But he's not so hot on tennis. 
"People play and talk about tennis," says Arledge, presi­dent of ABC Sports, "but most people would rather watch wrestling." 
The biggest of all single sports attractions is the Super Bowl-a one-day shootout for the NFL championship-al­though it can be topped, as this year. by an exciting seventh game of the World Series. 
There is a $3.5 million price tag on the Super Bowl, over and above the regular $60 mil­lion per year contract. Sponsors must pay $230,000 a minute of advertising, compared with $100,000 per minute which NBC could demand this year for the most exciting of all World Series.

Tributes began pouring in al­most immediately after Brani­gin 's death was announced by former press aide Jim Farmer. 
"Indiana mourns," Gov. Bow­en said. "With the passing of Roger Branigin, we have lost a great public official, an out­standing American, a dedicated Hoosier." 
"One capacity Roger has that is in great short supply today is the ability to make those tough decisions," Sen. Birch Bayh, D­Ind., said. "There was no equi­vocation about Roger Branigin, and we need that kind of lead­ership in government today." 
Branigin was known for his wit and sarcasm and highly popular to Hoosiers who saw him as his "own man." When once asked if he was for the common man, Branigin replied, "I'm a Hoosier, a Baptist and a Democrat, and by God, you can't get much more common than that." 
He often answered letters in his own handwriting and some­times answered the telephone in the governor's office, taking callers aback. 
An urbane attorney, he also was known for his liberal use of the governor's veto power­once vetoing in a single day more bills than his three prede­cessors combined. All of the vetoes were sustained, in­cluding a repeal of capital pun­ishment. ' 
Branigin's administration also achieved several major successes, including the state's first minimum wage law, re­peal of the right-to-work law, creation of a state scholarship program, equal opportunity in public education and housing, also saw the creation of a De­revision of the property tax partment of Motor Vehicle In­system that returned tax mon­spection and a new Department

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii cecilia prinster 
The "Right to Food Resolution" now before Congress asserts that every person in every country has the right to a nutritionally adequate diet, and that this right be recognized as a cornerstone of 
U.S. policy. It is appropriate that in this bicentennial year we reinforce our belief in the equality of all people and renew our commitment to the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
The "Right to Food Resolution" is not a bill. It does not have legal binding power. It is, rather, a commitment to a principle to which we and our government can later be held accountable. Just as the Declaration of Independence was and still is a commitment to liberty,. so, too, the "Right to Food Resolution" is, ultimately, a commitment to justice. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were the fundamental principles of the constitution. Similarly, the right to food is a basic point of reference in legislative and ad­ministrative decisions regarding trade, developmental assistance, monetary reform, military spending and all other matters that bear on hunger. 
The right to food is a corollary of the inalienable right to life in 
that it specifies the most fundamental requirement of human 
existence and acknowledges the most basic of human needs. But 
the true dignity of human life lies far beyond the physical and in­
stinctive needs of food and shelter, which are but the existential 
conditions of life on earth. The denial of these basic animal needs 
is, then, the most dehumanizing insult to humanity, and the 
presence of hunger in our world insults the humanity of not only 
th llSe who are denied food, but also of those who deny it. 
Hunger is caused by a host of injustices The lack of food con­
tri~utes to the ph~sic~l and m_ental degradation of the hungry, 
while the lack of JUstice contnbutes to the spiritual and moral 
decay of the satiate. We, the rich, the powerful and the educated 
are the arbiters of justice for those who have not, and our humanity 
depends on the extent to which we exten<' our wealth, our power and 
our knowledge to others not so fortunate l:t, ourselves. 
Equality is a fact of existence: God gave all people the same 
potential for good and evil and the same freedom of will. Justice 
however, is a virtue of righteous humanity, whereby we not only 
acknowledge the root equality of all people, but actively strive for 
the common good by fostering and preserving the inalienable 
human rights. 

~ust as the dignity of human life lies beyond the mere facts of 1 
existence, s?, too, the worth of a society lies not in its power and 
wealth, but m the use of them. Having acquired liberty two hun­
dred years ago, we were responsible for the creative use of that 
liberty; and having since acquired power and wealth we are now 
responsible for the just and humane application of th~t power and 
wealth. We are now in the position to grant a kind of liberty to 
others: through our financial and technological aid, we can help 
underd~veloped c?untrie~ to free. themselves from the debilitating 
oppressiOn of their physiCal environment and animal needs. we 
can help them to become free to develop their minds and hearts. 
As members of a society, we, as individuals, are at fault in allowing injustice to be perpetuated in our government and its policies. If we judge that it is just for our society to hoard resources -food, technology, raw materials -to the detriment of others, we, too, will someday be judged by that standard. 
The injustice and intolerance of the world around us are demanding that we respond, but the first and primary response must come from each of us and must be seen in each of our lives. The Offering of Letters sponsored by the Nr World Hunger Coalition is one response to injustice in our world. It is a political action in support of a humane principle. At this time of thanksgiving, let us commit ourselves to sharing our blessings. Write to your congressman and senator inWashington. Urge them to pass the "Right to Food Resolution."

katie and the duke---an american dream . ,A d 
Do you remember True Grit? It was the film a few years ago that won John Wayne an Oscar for his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn-the degenerate U.S. marshal with the "heart of gold". Rooster and the Duke are back in Rooster Cogburn ( ...and tht> lady>. This time, Rooster matches wits not only with the "bad guys" but also with Katherine Hepburn as Miss Eula Goodnight, the sharp-shooting lady with a Biblical quote for any occasion. 
The storyline has.a typic~l Western plo~. Rooster is forced mto retirement by his friend, the Judge, for shooting too many suspects. He is given a chance to get his badge back when the Judge needs someone for an impossible assignment-the capture of Hawk and his murderous gang for the theft of a wago~ful of nitroglycerine. Rooster must fmd th~m before they use the nitro t~ steal a sh1p­ment of gold and he must bn~g _them ba~k alive in order to hold onto his JOb. While tracking them, he comes across a ruined settlement. The night before, the Hawk's gang had gotten the settlement's Indians drunk, killed the local church's minister and set fire to some teepees. It is here t~at Rooster meets the schoolmarm Miss Goodnight, the daughter of the old mini­ster. He tries to take her and another survivor, the Indian boy Wolf to safety but in a typical Katy Hepburn move, they end up riding along with Rooster on the gang's trail.. . . . 
It IS here that the simllanty to the typical old-fashioned Western ends. There are some "shoot~m-up" scenes betw~n the outlaws and the three, but the mam actwn is the banter between the two vetera~s, Wayn~ a~d Hep.b~rn. For the nostalgia fans, It IS ren:umscent of the verbal battles between M1ss H~pburn and the. late Spenc~r Tracy. Yet, It b~omes te~10us. Miss Hepburn hasn t the qu1ckness of her retorts as she once had and the Duke's drawl has become even longer. As a result, the lines drag and have the stilted effect of monotonous memorization. Director Stuart Millar has placed so much emphasis on the two's charisma and wit, that you could begin to have more sympathy for the outlaws. 
Wayne and Hepburn are excellent in their confrontations with the gang. They have some clever ambushes and do a little tricky shooting with a gatlin gun. At one point, Rooster, Miss Goodnight and Wolf surround the gang and scare them away from the wagon of nitro long enough for the three of them to drive away with it. They accomplish this by shooting as fast as they can into the air and calling to each other as if it were a large posse. In another scene, when they are floating down the river with the nitro on a raft, they manage to keep the gang, who are on the high banks, from shooting them by raking the cliffs with the gatlin.

The good guys win, of course, and Rooster gets to keep his badge, in spite of the fact that he's killed the suspects again. Miss Goodnight with her wit has come to his defense before the Judge and with her 
"Biblical knowledge has convinced him that Rooster is just another Joshua . They both ride off into the sunset by different ways­Katy with tears in her eyes and Duke the realization that Miss Goodnight has had the last word again. 
Rooster was particularly disappointing for this Wayne-Hepburn fan. It had such possibilities . They were destroyed by the stereotypical characters, the unimaginative dialogue and the lack of action that might have salvaged the film as a good-old-fashioned-popcorn~ating Western. Maybe, the biggest disap­pointment was the fact that these two stars of old Hollywood had grown old like everybody else.

ND Archives provide scholars with treasure 
by Phil Cackley Staff Reporter 

The Notre Dame Archives is a scholar's treasure grove con­
taining  one  of  the  nation's  best  
collections  of  records  and  
documents  on  the  history  of  

:\merican Catholicism and is the repository for all historically valuable documents pertaining to Notre Dame. 
The Archives are located on the sixth floor of the Memorial Library and. according to Fr. Thomas Blantz, University Archivist, can be distinguished from a library generally in that libraries deal with published materials, while archives usually contain un­published materials. 
The unpublished materials in the Notre Dame Archives include letters. reports, minutes of meetings, photographs and other records. documents and personal papers. Many published materials relating specifically to Notre Dame are housed in the Notre Dame Collection. located in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections on the first floor of the Library. 
Blantz said {he Archives contain both rna terials directly or in­directly pertaining to Notre Dame and papers deserving preser­\·ation. because of a general historical value. 
Included'. in this latter category are many documents dealing with the his tory of American Catholicism. There are collections of papers and records, particularly from the 19th century, from the dioceses of New Orleans, Vin­cennes. Cincinatti and others. 
These collections comprise close to two-thirds of all the materials in the Archives, Blantz said, and are 
Need assessment will highlight 
a significant depository for in­formation on American Catholicism. "Some say we have the best or perhaps the second best collection in the nation," Blantz stated. 
Notre Dame acquired much of this material through the efforts of Prof. James Edwards, who came to the University in the 1870's. He spent a lot of time travelling to the bishops of various dioceses, convincing them to preserve their personal papers and the diocesan records. 
In cases where bishops could not preserve these documents themselves, Edwards suggested that the papers be donated to Notre Dame. For a time the Archives were even called the Catholic Archives of America. 
In addition to these collections, there are papers of persons in­directly connected with Notre Dame, such as General William Tecumseh Sherman and Orestes Brownson, a 19th century author and philosopher for whom Brownson Hall is named. 
Most of the materials in the Archives, especially the older material, are unique, Blantz ex­plained. There exists only one copy of a letter from General Sherman to President Lincoln, or from Orestes Brownson to Fr. Sorin, for instance.

The Archives receive a good deal of use from people on campus, Blantz said. Students use the historical records while writing papers on Notre Dame history for 
courses. 

Additionally, there is use by persons wishing to utilize the files of campus publications such as the Obst>rver and the Scholastic, which 
are  kept at  the Archives for  in­ 
formational purposes.  
Blantz  said  the  majority  of  

researchers using the Archives are local people, or from on campus. 
Other significant collections in the Archives include the papers of Paul Butler, the National Democratic Chairman at the time Adlai Stevenson ran for president; Frank Walker, post-master general under Franklin Roosevelt; and Cardinal O'Hara of Philadelphia, who was a Notre Dame president. Both Butler and Walker were Notre Dame graduates. 
aids are prepared. There are three types of aids: 1) a folder listing which gives general description of the material in a storage folder; 2) an item listing which lists each 
document or letter, the date of it, and who the letter is to and from; and 3) a calender listing which gives a summary of each document and a Jist of all the proper names mentioneed in the document. 
These finding aids help "the researcher to more conveniently find what he wants," Blantz 
commented.  This  can  be  
especially  important  with  a  
collection  such  as  the  Sherman  

papers, which has about 10,000 separate papers in it, stored in ninety boxes, he said. 
With some of the more frequently used collections, the entire collection has been microfilmed to make it more available to researchers. Both the 
Sherman and Brownson collections have been microfilmed, in addition to the New Orleans Diocese collection.

ND to host alcohol education conference 
by Dave Gill Staff Reporter 

Students, faculty members and administrators from 63 major universities in the United States and Puerto Rico will be meeting this weekend on the Notre Dame campus to discuss programs on alcohol education and the prevention of the use of alcohol. 
The seminal, entitled "University 50+ 12: A Fresh Look at the Old Sauce", is being co­sponsored by the National Institute on Alcolhol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Notre Dame Student Government. 
The clinic will begin on f<'riday evening with the welcoming ad­dress given by Brother Just Paczensy, Vice-President for Student Affairs at Notre Dame and will end Sunday afternoon with regional workshops. .The contingent from each school consists of one liason member and one student representative. The etudents will be housed in campus dormitories. The Ombudsman Service is including in the registration packets places of interest to visit during the weekend to give the dcommittee members a student's eye view of life at Notre Dame. 
During the seminar, there will be several films and ~iscussions open to student viewing and par­ticipation. On Friday night, from 1\:00 p.m. to 9:30p.m. there will be several films in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Education. Saturday morning, from 9:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., a panel discussion by students will be given in the auditorium of the CCE. Students Body President Ed Byrne will be the moderator of the group and Notre Dame's student representative, Diana Merten, will be on the panel. 
Saturday afternoon, form 2:00 
p.m. to 5:00 p.m., a apnel of university representatives from across the nation will discuss their individual programs and ideas on education and prevention in the use of alcohol. 
Saturday night, Drs. Richard and Shirley Jessor, from hte In­sititute of Behavioral Science, University of Colorado, will give a 
Turbotrain derails injuring 39 
ELWOOD, Ill. <AP) -Thir­ty-nine persons were injured Wednesday in the first derail­
ment  of  one  of  Amtrak's  sleek  
high-speed  turbotrains.  
The train collided with  a  truck  

while enroute from Chicago to St. Louis. It carried 111 per­sons, about half of whom were part of a contingent headed for the state capital on behalf of Mayor Hichard J. Daley. The mayor's sister-in-law, Cecilia (;reen, 65, was among those 
treated for injuries. 
Seven of the injured were ad­mitted to hospitals and three suffered injuries described as serious. 
The train was one of only five of Amtrak's new $2.7 million turbo units in operation nation­wide. Damage was estimated at close to $1 million, said .James Taylor, Amtrak's re­gional vice president. 
The Chicago-St. Louis turbo run was one of the first of its 
kind put into operation two years ago. Turbo trains can reach speeds up to 120 miles per hour but run slower be­cause of track conditions, an Amtrak spokesman said. 
The train, which left Chicago at II: 10 a.m., was traveling at about 73 miles per hour when it collided with a truck. 
The truck driver was identi­fied by hospital officials as Carl Steandmeyer, 48, of Joliet, who was treated for minor injuries and released. 
Elwood is about 45 miles southwest of Chicago. Steandmeyer said trees and other growth obstructed his view of the crossing and he saw the train only at the last mo­ment. He swerved and attempted to turn the vehicle parallel to the tracks. "I'm thankful to be alive," he told reporters. Amtrak officials said the truck ran into the side of the second car in the train in which most members of the Daley contigent were traveling. Four cars derailed and tottered on the brink of turning over. "There was a ter~ibl,e moment or two when we d1dn t

Phone books finally here 
Off-campus students may pick up their phone directories today and Friday in the LaFortune ballroom, according to Paul Heynolds of the Student Union Services Commission. Phone hooks may also be picked up next Monday and Tuesday at the same location. 
The directories should be picked up during the following hours: today from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Friday from 1p.m. until 2:15p.m.; Monday from noon to 1 p.m. and Tuesday from 11:30 p.m. until 2 p.m. 
The pick-up procedure has changed from last year, according to Reynolds. This year Student Union sent a letter to each house advising the residents that the books were now available. This 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., was scheduled to be in Concord to­day, meeting with state Demo­cratic leaders as part of an ef­fort to "catch up with" other presidential candidates entering New Hampshire's February 
primary. Bayh also is scheduled to be in Franklin, Berlin, Laconia, Dover, and Portsmouth during a three-day sweep of the state. 
In a Manchester news confer­ence Wednesday, Bayh said he expects to make a "credible 
showing" in the New Hamphire presidential primary, the first in the nation. Bayh said the 
letter must be presented in order for the students to receive their directories. 
Students from the Campus View and Turtle Creek apartments will be required to present their Notre

U.S. gets ingredients 
WASHINGTON <AP> Americans are going to be told for the first time which chem­icals are added to their beer, wine and liquor. 
The Food and Drug Adminis­tration told Congress on Wednesday that ingredient la­beling of all domestic and im­ported alcoholic beverages will be mandatory Jan. 1, 1977. 
"While we recognize that the issue of ingredient labe.ling of alcoholic products is a very complex matter," FDA associ­ate commissioner Sam D. Fine said, "we do believe that it is in the best interest of the con­sumer to have these foods la­beled as informatively as pos­sible and we are in favor of having their ingredients de­clared on the label." 
Michael F. Jacobson, head of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, which raised the labeling issue three 
years ago, told a House sub­
committee that some in­gredients in alcoholic bever­ages cause allergic reactions in 
some people, and some have proven fatal. 
"In the mid 1960s, several brewers in the U.S. and abroad began adding cobalt sulfate to their beers to maintain a nice foamy head," he told the House Government Operations con­
"Unfortunately, cobalt had never been tested in the pres­
ence oi alcohol -a com­bination that proved to be dead­ly to at least 50 beer drinkers," Jacobson said. 
The chemicals prevent or promote foaming, kill bacteria, preserve flavor, prevent dis­coloration and, with the addi­tion of caramel coloring, can make a thin beer look thick and rich, he said. 
Jacobson predicted that the labeling would add one cent to the price of six-packs of beer and about one cent to the price of a bottle of wine. 
Bureau of Alcohol Director Rex D. Davis said Jacobson's request had the backing of the brewing industry but was vigor­ously opposed by liquor and wine makers.

Ford moving towards NYC help 
WASHINGTON <AP) -Pres­ident Ford moved one step closer Wednesday toward rec­ommending federal help for New York City but said the city and state must first deliver on their own promises. 
"If they continue to make progress, I will review the situ­ation early next week to see if any legislation is appropriate at the federal level," Ford said in his latest statement on New York's financial crisis. 
Ford said he would veto a bill in the House that would provide

Europe. The terrorists were shot under a tough new law that required personal approval of the sentences by Franco. 
But Franco appeared to weather the storm of inter­national protest and denounced the rest of Europe for a "leftist conspiracy" against his govern­ment. 
When World War II broke out, Franco repaid his German· and Italian backers with staunch verbal support and with one division which suf­fered heavy casualties on the Russian front. 
Franco's anti-Communist views began to pay dividends after the war as Western Eu­rope and the United States banded together to fight inter­national Communism.

loan guarantees for the city. House leaders promptly sus­pended action on the bill, say­ing it was futile to proceed in the face of Ford's veto threat. 
The New York Assembly was meeting Wednesday to consider some parts of the state's finan­cial plan, including tax in· creases. 
Time for averting default through federal help may be running out, however. New York City could default on its debts as early as next week, without help, while Congress is

"disappointed that we couldn't get an answer from the Presi­dent." He said there is no al­ternative to getting quick feder­al approval of the self-help pro­gram to restore the city and state to financial soundness. 
A Ford administration source said that as a condition for fed­eral help, Ford first wants the New York Assembly to act on a proposed $200 million increase in city taxes. 
Once that is done, the source said, Ford may consider a plan to help the city obtain cash over a three-year period, pre­sumably through loan guaran­tees. 
In his statement, Ford said, "I am convinced that if New York continues to move toward fiscal responsibility, all parties concerned can look forward to a satisfactory resolution, de­spite the current obstacles." 
On the other hand, he said, "should New York leaders fail to implement their intentions, New York City could still be forced into legal default."

Americans who White House and CIA mounted telligence appropriations sub­"there are at least nine names properly" in deciding to make collaberated with CIA, and an eleventh-hour effort to block committee.

CIA Director William E. Col­by wrote a letter to Senate Armed Services Chairman John Stennis, asking him to persuade the Senate to reject all sections of the report except the recom­mendations, or at least strike a11 names mentioned in the re­port, a Senate source said Wednesday. 
An administration source who confirmed the Colby letter to Stennis said a similar message had been sent to Sen. John House aides circulated among Republican senators a 2112-page briefing paper drafted by Mit­chell Rogovin, Colby's special legal representative. Rogovin argued that revelation of the names in the report "will place those persons and their families in danger, will have long-range effects on United States in­telligence activities, and ap­pears to violate the fundamen­tal due process of those individ­uals." 
The document, a copy of which was given to The Associ­harm exists if the names are divulged." The briefing paper also asks that each of those in­dividuals "have the opportunity to acquaint himself with the text of the report and to offer such evidence as is available to justify deletion of his name. 
The last-minute lobbying campaign came as Colby held a rare press conference at CIA headquartersal, calling it "an eleventh-hour attempt to inter­fere with publication of the re­port."

FBI admits to King harrassment 
WASHINGTON <APl -A top FBI official testified Wednes­day there was no legal justifi­cation for the 25 separate at­tempts by the bureau in the 1960s to discredit the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a civil rights leader. 
James B. Adams, associate deputy FBI director, told the Senate Intelligence Committee there is "no statutory basis or justification" for the attempts which included sending King !ind his wife an anonymous let­ter which King took as a sug­gestion he commit suicide. 
Adams said, however, he be­lieves the FBI was justified in investigating King because of the possibility that Communist influences were being brought to bear on him and on the civil rights movement. 
He said he can find no basis for King's conclusion that the FBI -prepared letter and the tape recording that accom­panied it suggested King kill himself. But he acknowledged under questioning that inter­pretation is "a possibility." 
"I certainly would say it was improper and I can't justify its being prepared or sent," Adams said. 
The letter read in part: "Kin&. there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is ... You are done. 
There  is  but  one way  out  for  
you."  
In  addition  to  the  letter,  the  

committee on Tuesday made public evidence that the FBI in­stalled a total of 16 electronic bugs and eight wiretaps on King and promoted a candidate

Adams  said  the  wiretaps  

were authorized by then-Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
Later, committee staff mem­bers said the FBI had justified the bugs under what it consid­ered to be its general in­vestigative authority. 
Staff members said Kennedy and his brother, then-President John F. Kennedy, told King at one point that continued FBI in­terest in his activities arose out of a fear or a suspicion that he was being influenced by some­one the bureau felt was subver­sive. 
Chairman Frank Church, D­Idaho, said that when the New York field office issued a memo saying that the person was not thought to have Communist leanings, it was told emphat­ically by FBI headquarters in Washington that tt was wrong. 
A directive from the late FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's of­fice said the bureau did not agree with the finding that the investigation should be dropped. While there was no evidence that the person was not a Communist, "neither is there any evidence that he is anti-Communist," the directive said. 
Adams testified that the bu­reau's controversial Coin tel pro activities, which were halted in 1971, began with an effort to "neutralize the Communist par­ty in the United States. 
He said the FBI never asked any attorney general or any one else for authority for the programs, which were later ex­panded to include so-called New Left, white hate, black revolutionary and other groups, including the womens' liber­ation movement.

Irish battle Russians in Garden 
by Rich Odioso 

Fabled Madison Square Garden, the self-styled basketball capital of the world, will be the scene tonight for a preliminary summit meeting between Notre · Dame's Adrian Dantley, an avowed Olympic candidate. and the defending Olympic champion Russian basket ball team. 
Dantley won't be all the Irish bring to their 9:05 tilt <WSBT radio -960 l. Notre Dame sports its deepest team in years and all ten of the Irish players are making the trip figure to see action. 
For Coach Digger Phelps it will be an important test for his team against a Russian squad that stood 4-5 on its American tour before last night's game at Wake Forest. The Russians have lost by varying margins to five of the best teams in the country: Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Marquette and Providence. The Irish will be out to prove that they are worthy of consideration with the nation's best, but they have some han­dicaps working against their quest. 
One, shared by the other schools, is the international rules the game will be played under. The Russians are intimately familiar with these regulations which include in­creased freedom in physical contact and steps without drib­bling, a foul lane with increasing width as it approaches the baseline, a 30-second shot clock and no ten-second rule and no need for the referee to handle the ball on violations. 
The second handicap., shared by the more recent Russian op­ponents, is the experience the Soviets have piled up on their tour. The Russians will have ten games under their belt while this will be 
Final cuts were held Tuesday, selecting the women's basketball team. The 21-member squad will play a 15 game season beginning with Grace College here on Dec. 13. 
Players returning to the squad from last year are: Mary Clemency, Judy Shiely, Brynne Murphy, Becky Banasiak, Patty Coogan, Maureen Maloney, Kathy 
Anderson,  Barb Frey  and  Anne  
Berges.  
New  members  include:  Liz  

Berry, Eunie Sullivan, Bonita Bradshaw, Carol Lally, Jane O'Reilly, Anne Bond, Sue Fondi, Marge Meagher, Molly McGuire, Anne Adams, Laura Dodge and Kathy Dickinson. 
The team is again coached by Jeanne Earley, and newcomer Sally Duffy. Duffy played basketball for Ohio Domincan, trying out for the U.S. Olympic team her senior year. She also has nine years coaching experience behind her. 
Earley ill confident of a strong

Notre Dame's first outside test. The Soviets were beaten handily by Marquette and Indiana but more recent games against teams Jf similar caliber, Maryland and North Carolina, have been much closer. 
The final disadvantage is unique to the Irish. Notre Dame, despite being over 4,500 miles closer to New York than Moscow will still be allowed to take only ten players to the Garden under the controversial new NCAA ruling similar to the 48­man road rule in football. The Russians of course will have their full complement of players, making the Irish in effect visitors on American soil. Games under international rules are often foul­prone and it would not be sur­prising for the Irish to get in serious personnel difficulties. 
The Russians are led by Sergei Belov, a 6-8, 190 string bean who is one of the greatest shooters on the planet. His range is comparable to a Vostok booster and lately he's been hitting at over a 30 point per game clip. Some have taken to calling Sergei the "Jerry West of Europe." 
Sergei is not to be confused with 

Aleksandr Belov who is no 
relation. Aleksandr scored the 
disputed winning basket at Munich 
and was subsequently drafted by 
the New Orleans Jazz of the NBA. 
Sergei is much the superior player. 
As usual, the Russians have 

tremendous size. Their frontline 
includes Alzhen Zharmukhamedov 
(6-9), Vladimir Shigili (6-9), and 
Juri Pavlov (6-8). Zhar­
mukhamedov is nearly as strong 
as his name is difficult to 
pronounce. If additional help is 
needed the Soviets have a 7-2 
Mongolian on the bench who is 
second-cousin to the Abominable 
season this year. "We're going to 
have a lot more depth than last 
year. All the kids we have, have 
the potential of being starters," 
she said. 
She cites the strength of the team 

in its speed. "We don't have much 
height, but we have alot of speed," 
she claims.

excellent people at the key position. "We are rather fortunate to have Jack Brownschidlee and Paul Clarke at defense. Jack is one of the finest offensive and defensive skatersin the WCHA and we are very happy that he chose to remain at school this year rather than compete with the Olympic team." 
Smith went on to add that Brownschidle also possesses a great instinct for defense, something else that a defenseman must have. This relates to Schafer's reference of the "miracle split second position" where only instinct and the ex­perience of years of playing will help. "You have a spot where the man from tthe other team may be in the corner, on the opposite side form the goalie and you think that he is out of the play," Schafer explained. "Well if there is a good pass and suddenly the man is in the next to the goal with an open shot. You have to just feel which way to go, and it has to be done in an instant. And its that instant that will decidewhethera goal is scored or not." 
Obviously its a tough position, and this year, the Irish have had some porblems at this position. Smith attributes this primarily to inexperience. "Pat Novitzki played wing last year and is now just fully learning the new position. 
Roger Bourque and Paul Clarke are rounding themselves back into the seing of . playing again after missing much of last year, so we judgement call merely adds to woes of defense. 
Another problem the Irish defense has encountered this year is in coming out of the zone.

Smith attributes this to an over-eagernesson Bourque's part, but has to be corrected in the future. 
This weekend, when you go to the ACC for the hockey games, try to appreciate some of the problems that the defenseman has trying to prevent goals.
