CANCUN, Mexico--Hur­ricane Gilbert, one of the most destructive storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday, shatter­ing windows, drenching the land and cutting off the Carib­bean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel. 
Thousands fled from the storm, which has killed at least 14 people elsewhere. The Jamaican Embassy in Wash­ington said the storm left 500,000 people homeless in that island nation. 
The hurricane's 160 mph winds ripped over Cozumel is­land earlier Wednesday. Ham radio operators in the area said Gilbert knocked down a radio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blew the roofs off buildings. 
The winds leveled slum areas in Cancun on the Mexican mainland, where many people live in cardboard shacks, the operators said. In Quintana Roo state, huge 'WdVes lashed at Caribbean resort beaches, and trees were downed by the punishing winds, Mexican offi­cials said. 
"The sound of the wind out­side is horrible," said recep­tionist Pablo Torres at the Hotel Carrillos in Cancun in a telephone interview as the storm approached. "You couldn't leave even if you wanted to." 
There were no immediate reports of casualties in Mexico. 
The National Hurricane Cen­ter in Coral Gables, Fla., said a hurricane watch was in effect along the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along the coast of northeast Mexico· from Tampico north. 
"Residents in these areas should be ready for quick ac­tion should warnings be re­quired" today, the center said in a statement. 
At 6 p.m. EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.3 north, longitude 88.8 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan, about 60 miles east­northeast of the provincial cap­ital, Merida, the statement said. The storm was about 600 miles southeast of Brownsville. 
Gilbert's winds had decreased to 140 mph as it moved over land, but the center said wind speed was expected to rise once the storm moved back over the warm Gulf of Mexico waters. It said the hur­ricane was moving west­northwest at 15 mph. 
Gilbert is a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage. 
Only two Category 5 hur­ricanes have hit the United States--a 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hur­ricane Camille, which devas­tated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people. 
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, reports from New Orleans said. Resi­dents along the gulf coast of Texas, 560 miles to the north, stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate. 
The government oil monopoly Pemex said it evacuated 5,000 workers from platforms in the Campeche

ND prof in coma after heart attack 
By REGIS COCCIA Senior Staff Reporter 
A Notre Dame professor suf­fered a heart attack early yes­terday morning while driving to the University and is in a coma at St. Joseph Medical Center. 
James Danehy, 76, emeritus professor of chemistry, was driving north on Hill St. through the La Salle intersec­tion at about 7:30a.m. when his car went over a curb and stopped, said Lt. Richard Kil­gore of the South Bend Police Department. 
Danehy was removed from on La Salle. Transpo Super­visor Ron Singleton adminis­tered cardio-pulmonary resus­citation to Danehy, Kilgore said. 
Cpt. Richard Redwine, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, assisted Singleton. Danehy was taken by am­bulance to St. Joseph Medical Center. 
A hospital spokesman said Danehy is in very serious con­dition in the coronary care unit. The hospital listed him in "guarded condition" Wednes­day night. 
Danehy, a 1933 Notre Dame graduate, has served as a chemistry consultant since re­ceiving his master's degree 
his car by Jim Phelps, an em-and doctorate in chemistry ployee of Hi-Speed Auto Wash from the University. 
Alumnus bitten by dog while resisting arrest

Two Notre Dame alumni were arrested for disorderly conduct at an off-campus party Friday night and one required medical treatment for head in­juries inflicted by a South Bend police dog.

IN BRIEF 
The 75th Diamond Jubilee Celebration of the Indiana Association of Realtors at the Century Center, Sept. 15-18, will yield more than an increase in tourism. As a gesture of good will, the realtors will also contribute to St. Joseph County's Shelter for the Homeless. "We're in the business of selling homes, but we realize that there are many less fortunate than ourselves or our clients. We felt the donation to the shelter was an appropriate way to repay the citizens of the South Bend-Mishawaka area for their hospitality," said President Jack White. Art Linklet­ter will kick off the Diamond Jubilee Convention on Sept. 16 with an inspirational speech entitled "Yes, You Can."

American drinking and driving views are warped 


The trend has been to consider drinking and driving as a pair, a sort of "fire and gasoline" treatment. I want to look at them separately, more like "apples and oranges." 
I spent last year studying in Innsbruck, Austria, which I know everyone is already really sick of hearing about, so I won't dwell on my experiences there but rather on an. ob­servation I made there. 
The first night I went out to an Austrian bar I looked around and noticed that the crowd seemed pretty young. Mter talking with some of these people, I realized they were indeed quite young. I knew the laws there were differ­ent or else I wouldn't even have been in this particular establishment at all, but I didn't realize that the drinking age, if you could even call it that, is only fifteen. Only technically, people say. It's never enforced. 
My surprise at discovering this was easily surpassed by that of my Austrian friends when they found out that we in America can't enter a bar and have a drink until the age of 21. 
A second observation I made is that none of these young people are driving home. Great, I thought, good for them. The truth, though, is that they can't drive. You can't get a driver's license until your eighteenth birthday and even then they are very difficult and expensive to obtain. Mter you have it, you remain a proba­tionary driver for a few years. Gasoline and insurance costs in Austria make ours look like loose change. 
Cultural differences can explain this. Austrians and Germans invented beer. It is the cheapest item (by volume) on any menu, cheaper than pop, juice, or mineralwater. So for them, beer is a big social beverage. People drink it all the time, and as I stated above, they begin drinking it at a young age. Children who are in restaurants with their parents can get served when they're 12 or 13. 
As far as the driving issue is concerned, Europe is also very different than America. Most cities were planned with the pedestrian in mind. Public transportation is incredible and easy even for foreigners to figure out. 
The way that many things are done in Europe struck me as very "backwards." In the cases of drinking and of driving, however, we are the ones who need to make a change. 
As you all know, here we learn to drive and then we learn to drink. On the whole, we do a pretty poor job of both. By the time a person begins to drink legally in this country they have already been drinking for probably four or five years. They've also been driving all this time. Even if the powers that be want to fool them­selves that we really don't drink until we're 21, that still means that we've had our licenses for five years.

What is really screwed up in this country is the priorities. Drinking is taught to be a taboo and then a sort of birthday gift from the gov­ernment. Driving, on the other hand, is taken for granted and ridiculously easy to obtain a license for. Considered strictly separately, driving is more dangerous than drinking and should be treated as the responsibility and privilege that it is. 
By the time Austrians and other Europeans earn their drivers' licenses, they already know how to drink. Their laws against drinking and driving are more strict than ours, but at least in this area we are moving in the right direction. Anyway, their driving rights are too hard­earned and too precious to them for drivers to jeopardize them in any way. 
Driving is something we take for granted. Drinking is something Europeans take for granted, but so what? The very de-emphasis that Europeans put on drinking alcohol is what leads them to treat it so responsibly. 
I told a small untruth at the beginning of this article--! am going to talk about drinking and driving in their lethal combination. To loosely paraphrase and translate Berthold Brecht, let us say it for the thousandth time, so that it won't be said one time too few. Just don't do it. Es­pecially to all those road tripping to Michigan State, have fun, drive safely, and come back alive.

SMC students encouraged to use security escort service 
By MIMI TUOHY Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Campus security, voting registration and freshman elections were the main issues discussed by the Saint Mary's Board of Governance Wednes­day night in Haggar College Center. 
Richard Chlebek, director of security, attended the meeting and answered questions from board members regarding cur­rent student issues. Chlebek en­couraged students to use the es­cort service offered by the security department. The ser­vice, which began last year, al­lows any student who is off campus and feels that she is in danger to notify security for a ride home. 
"If a student calls for help getting back to campus, we will always cooperate," Chlebek said. "This is a very positive program, and the students

mobilized by campus security in order to enforce campus policies on parking and tick­ets." 
"In addition, students who have not registered their cars will be automatically regis­tered soon," he said. "A decal will be placed on the outside of the car window, and the student will be charged $100 for neglecting to register earlier." Vice-President for Student M­fairs Lisa Hill acknowledged the importance of Chlebek's at­tendance. "He officially an­swered some important ques­tions that needed to be asked," she said. "Hopefully, relations were improved between secur­ity and student government tonight." In other business, Hill announced that next week student government is sponsor­ing an opportunity for students to register for the 1988 presidential election. 
Anyone interested in helping at the registration should at­tend a meeting this Sunday at 9 p.m. in Regina North lounge, she said. 
Elections Commissioner Michelle Agostino said that freshman elections are cur­rently scheduled for Sept. 20.

Shuttle launch date delayed because of Gilbert 

Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.-­NASA said Wednesday it was delaying setting a launch date for the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight because of the possibility that Hurricane Gilbert could disrupt opera­tions at the flight control center in Houston. 
Also cited was uncertainty about a small hydrogen leak detected in the shuttle's main engine propulsion system, a problem not considered serious. 
Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate administra­tor for space flight, said the plan is still to launch in the last week in September, but a firm date would not be set before Friday. 
The hurricane, which is churning in the Gulf of Mexico with winds up to 160 mph, is on a course that could possibly

"We don't know where the hurricane is going, but we thought it best to wait a day or so, or whatever it takes to make a decision," Truly said. 
"Even though Houston doesn't get hit, it is a threat to Houston, and we have people

there who have to turn atten­tion to their homes and families, just as other people along the Texas coast are doing," Truly said. 
Once a shuttle is launched, the mission is controlled from the Johnson center. Earlier storms that have hit that area have caused some flooding there, disrupting communica­tions. 
The decision to delay was made after more than 150

shuttle managers and en­gineers and outside experts spent two days reviewing the shuttle's systems and the readiness of launch and flight control teams. 
Truly said he polled the 15 key NASA and contractor managers at the conclusion of the review, "and there wasn't a dissenting vote to launch.... We're in a very positive situa­tion." 
"If the subject doesn't resist, the dogs are trained to clamp down on them," Kilgore said. "If the subject resists, the dogs may release their hold and bite them again." 
A police officer was pulling the dog off Abood when Fink kicked the dog in the ribs. Both men, who graduated from the University in 1985, were then charged and taken into police custody, Kilgore said. 
Abood was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, while Fink was charged with battery for as­saulting a police dog, said Kil­gore. 
Police transported Abood to the Memorial Hospital's emer­gency room, where he received treatment for bites on his head and back. He and Fink were then taken to the county jail, where they were released on a $250 bond, Kilgore said. 
Both men are scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 3, said Kilgore. 
Eyewitnesses said at least seven or eight police cars and a canine · unit arrived at the scene to break up the party. The large group dispersed when police entered the premises.

P.O. Box Q 
Protestants began Belfast violence 
Dear Editor: 
While Mr. Tom Varnum, in his View­point article of Sept. 13, "Belfast: a flicker of hope," maintained an ad­mirable objective evaluation of the par­ties involved in the situation in Nor­thern Ireland, I believe that his failure to acknowledge certain historical facts led to an inadequate conclusion. 
Varnum fails to note that the pres­ence of the British army in Northern Ireland was initiated in response to ex­cesses on the part of Protestant­dominated paramilitary security groups in the turbulent late 1960s. Minor reforms begun in that time per­iod under Northern Irish Prime Mini­ster Terrence O'Neill led to rising ex­pectations on behalf of the Catholic population. These hopes included such basic rights as a one man, one vote elec­toral policy and a non-discriminatory housing policy. When, due to the paranoia of the ruling Anglican­Protestant class, these basic goals were unattained, much of the population channelled its frustration into marches of demonstration, which were greeted with violent suppression. 
It was at this point that the British army was called upon to maintain a semblance of order in the statelet. In­itially, the army was welcomed by the Catholic population as their defenders against Protestant violence. However, while Britain may have used her army to maintain order, she felt no need to use persuasiveness on the political level to continue O'Neill's reforms. The po­litical situation stagnated, but the desires for the basic elements of a more just society did not disappear from the minds of the Catholics. The British army then became the obvious hard target, necessary for any terrorist cam­paign, for the newly revised IRA. 
Varnum is correct to criticize the term "freedom-fighters," as it is a term that reinforces the notion that freedom can, in any context, be most expediently bought through bloodshed. This notion should be considered anat­hema, particularly to Christians. 
To proceed from this point and simply say that no one is to blame is to avoid drawing a conclusion. Certain­ly, it is the final decision of the IRA to bomb or not to bomb; but when a British government coins the phrase 
Doonesbury 
7HANK5_ 
etV/5. IT'S GR&AT 7D 8£3 
"acceptable level of violence," cannot remain consistent on policing policy, and continually puts the problems of a substantial part of her nation on the back burner, it is not unreasonable to believe that the IRA is strongly encour­aged to continue its activities. 
All nations are extremely sensitive about capitulating to terrorism. In this instance, it is clear that a more respon­sible British attitude as well a more Christian attitude from the leaders of Northern Ireland could have prevented them from a situation in which some level of capitulation is inevitable. If those responsible for the governing of Northern Ireland wanted to be thought of as acting just toward their citizens, they should have begun acting so before it became a necessary condition for the cessation of violence.

· I am writing in regards to the letter by Liam M. Bruen, protesting the Ac­cent article featuring Morrissey Manor. Mr. Bruen attacks the use of the word fraternity in the article, en­titled "Like a fraternity, only better," as a disservice to both Notre Dame and Morrissey. I agree with Mr. Bruen that many fraternal organizations on cam­puses nationwide "represent one of the last bastions of institutionalized elitism and racism." However, the article does not call for comparisons between Mor­rissey and organizations on other cam­puses. The word fraternity is simply used in a pure form to demonstrate the camaraderie and brotherhood of Mor­rissey. The author, Dan Strutzel, never claims that Morrissey is a college fraternity in every aspect of its defini­tion. Thus the title, "Like a fraternity, only better." 
Mr. Bruen also vehemently ex­presses his discontent with the choice of Morrissey as the subject of the fea­ture. While I understand that Mr. Bruen may not be as interested in the article as a Morrissey resident, I cannot com­prehend his disgust with its publication. The Morrissey article is not an isolated incident, but rather a part of an Obser­ver series featuring each of Notre Dame's 26 resident halls. What perplexes me is Mr. Bruen's criticism of the single Morrissey article as op­posed to the entire series. Should the letter be viewed as animosity directed towards Morrissey, or am I to expect another letter regarding the recent Breen-Phillips article? In either case, I find this perspective extremely self­centered. Are students only to take in­terest in those activities on campus in which they directly participate? 
The only features which Mr. Bruen feels should be reported are those which every single member of the Notre Dame community considers in­teresting. If the previous statement is true, then either the students will be spending a great amount of time writing editorials or the Accent page will be vacant. So, Mr. Bruen, the next time you find an article in The Observer which does not interest you, please do not take pen in hand proclaiming your­self ''a majority.'' Simply do what other students do: turn the page.

Alumni article lacks compassion 
Dear Editor: 
Mter reading Mr. Rob Hennig's Viewpoint column of Sept. 9, I am con­vinced that people can find something to complain about in any situation. In his article Mr. Hennig expressed petty complaints about the presence of alumni on campus during football season. Unfortunately, many alumni were probably offended by this assort­ment of misplaced quiblings. Such a lack of respect for other human beings displays an obvious selfish character who has a need to blow off steam at anyone, with no regard to their feelings. 
As students at the University of Notre Dame, we hold a privilege that many people are denied. We have all chosen the second largest tourist attraction in Indiana as our home for four years. The campus is beautiful; full of history and tradition. Many students are here be­cause of Notre Dame's widespread reputation for providing a high caliber education. One of the added bonuses to life at Notre Dame is the excitement surrounding the sports programs, es­pecially football. Lastly, Notre Dame is the choice of many students because it is a fine Catholic university. 
This last fact should tell us that we, 
as a university, should act in a Christ­
ian way; thus our attitude toward 
alumni, or any visitor to our campus, 
is, and should be, an extension of our 
Christianity. We do not provide 
hospitality toward our alumni simply 
because they support us and they have 
earned respect, although these reasons 
are good ones, but more importantly 
because doing so is pure common cour­
tesy and reflects our Christianity. I am 
honored to be part of a university which 
is so widely respected and supported. 
I am embarrassed by Mr. Hennig's un­
grateful and misplaced remarks in his 
article. 
One of the arguments Mr. Hennig stressed was that alumni arriving on Friday afternoons before football games distract us from taking advan­tage of this time to fulfill our educa­tional obliglltions. Let's be honest about this, Mr. Hennig, and realize how pro­. ductive these Friday afternoons are-­whether alumni are here or not. Start­ing in the early afternoon, parties, bands, and loud music blare across campus. These distractions do not come from alumni. I would not classify (nor in the spirit of the festive weekend, would I condemn) a bunch of drunk men in togas yelling in my window late on Thursday night as conducive to 
studying. 
Another point in Mr. Hennig's article 
which was out of place was his com­
plaint about alumni comin~ to see their 
old rooms. Personally, I thmk it's great 
to get a knock on my door from someone 
who li'ved in my room 45 years ago. 
Quite to the contrary of Mr. Hennig's 
article, I feel that Notre Dame football 
weekends would not be as exciting if 
there weren't so many people and so 
much going on. Perhaps alumni do not 
behave or dress as we do, and perhaps 
they do have privileges. They do not 
receive our alcohol policy in the mail, 
however I do not find their behavior 
offensive. More often than not, the ob­
noxious drunks are not the alumni 
walking around with beer cans "glued" 
to their han<ils, but the present students 
funneling beers out on Green Field. 
I myself am offended and hurt by Mr. 
Hennig's article, as were many other 
1
people, I am sure. I believe that alumni 
1 
should be treated with thf acceptance and respect we give to each other; the same respect and acceptance I hope we will receive when we, too, are proud Notre Dame alumni.

Residents take pride in Walsh's uniqueness 
MARIA JUKIC accent writer 
W
alsh Hall was estab­lished on a tradition of pride and spirit, and it con­tinues to manifest these qualities today. 
Reverend Thomas E. Walsh, after whom Walsh Hall was named, was the president of Notre Dame from 1881-1893. His ac­complishments are worthy of the honor bestoyed upon him. Walsh assumed the presidency at the remarkably young age of 28. He served the University until his un­timely death in 1893 at the age of forty. 
Under the leadership of Walsh, Notre Dame made its first appearances in national collegiate athletics. Many buildings were also erected, including St. Edward's Hall, Washington Hall, the science hall, the chemistry hall, and additions to the administra­tion building. 
Walsh Hall was erected in Walsh's honor in 1908. The construction of the hall was a unique approach. The build-ing was the first Notre Dame dorm to have sinks in individ­ual rooms and the only hall to have built-in closets. The hall was considered one of the most modern and elaborate college dormitories of its time. 

Walsh Hall presently houses just under 200 women but was originally built to hold 100 freshmen men. During World 
War II, it housed men in the Naval Reserve Officer Train­ing Corps as well as other midshipmen. Walsh Hall was also one of the first residence halls, along with Badin, to become an all female dor­mitory for undergraduate wo­men in 1972. 
One of the most requested halls on campus, Walsh is known for its beautiful ex­terior and comfortable rooms. The residents of Walsh take special pride in their hall. Said sophomore Eileen Col­lins, "Walsh is unique be­cause it is not too big, each room is different, and it is close to a lot of historic places on campus." 
Walsh also boasts several intramural sports teams in­cluding football, softball, and basketball. Although not an athletic powerhouse, involve­ment is great, and the hall spirit is unbeatable. 
Co-presidents Mary Mul­vaney and Leslie McCloskey are planning many activities for this year. A blood drive is being planned, as well as various social events and ac­tivities to increase social awareness. 
Besides all the tangible characteristics of Walsh Hall, one of its best qualities is the sense of friendship and com­raderie among the residents. According to Mulvaney, "This is the best dorm on campus, not just because of its great location but because of the great sense of community." 

Young talent in 'Young Guns' 

Courtwy of T_..tlelh Century Fox lou Diamond Phillips, Keifer Sutherland, Emilio Estevez, Casey Slemaszko, Charlie Sheen, and Dermot Mulroney are the Regulators, young kids hired to protect an Englishman's ranch against the mob, In "Young Guns." 
' \ 

CHRIS HASBROOK accent writer 
I
f you have been out to the movies lately, you'll know that there are some good 
. shows playing along with the 
ever-present psychotic­
teenage-killer flicks. One of 
the better movies currently 
showing is "Young Guns," a 
drama set in New Mexico 
around 1870. 
Emilio Estevez (of "Repo 
Man" fame) turns in an ex­
cellent performance as 
William H. Bonney, who is 
better known to you history 
flunkies as "Billy the Kid." 
Estevez plays the young Bon­
ney who is taken in by a kind, 
old Englishman and given a 
job as a cowhand. He falls in 
with the other five 
"Regulators" (as the 
cowhands are known) who 
are played by such notables 
as Kiefer "I'm Donald's kid" 
Sutherland, Lou Diamond 
"La Bamba" Phillips, Charlie 
Sheen, and two other little 
known actors, Dermot Mul­
roney and Casey Siemaszko. 
Now if you are thinking that this is going to be an­other "Breakfast Club," hold on to your Rambo dolls be­cause this film is loaded with action! The plot soon gets thicker than South Bend's ethanol stench when the Regulators lose their English

employer to a hail of gunfire 
from L. G. Murphy and his 
bad men. 
It seems Murphy wants to hold the sole rights to the cattle business in New Mexico and does so by bribing every sheriff and lawmaker includ­ing the governor, only to find out that the six Regulators have been deputized by the only law-abiding justice around. The six set out to apprehend Murphy's men, but soon become Justice, Jury and Hangmen when they wipe out a good portion of the bad guys. Of course, in America this is a no-no, and before they can figure out what. to do next, most of the Old West is looking for them. 
The only weak point in the whole movie was the music. It seems someone switched the music of "Top Gun" with the score of "Young Guns" because I got the feeling that I was about to see Kenny Loggins singing "Danger Zone" in an F-14 while straf­ing the New Mexican Plains. Rock and roll is great, but not in an Old Western, and certainly not if it sounds like anything Loggins ever wrote. Beyond the music, this was a most worthwhile flick to see, especially if you don't have the option of watching it on cable TV next spring .

Irish volleyball heads for Colorado tournament 
By GREG SCHECKENBACH 
Sports Writer 
The Irish women's volleyball team will play in the Holiday InrvUniversity Park Classic tournament Friday and Satur­day night at Colorado State University in Ft. Collins, Colorado. The tournament par­ticipants are Colorado State, Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo, and Houston. 
This is the type of tourna­ment Head Coach Art Lambert wants for his team. 
''This is a great opportunity to call attention to our pro­gram," says Lambert. "We will get the exposure of a top twenty team while gaining valuable experience from es­tablished programs." 
Notre Dame is coming off an impressive second place finish at the Saluki Invitational at Southern Illinois University.

They recorded victories against Iowa, Southern Illinois, and tourney champion Arizona. The only drawback was an early match upset loss to Bowling Green. The team's overall record is 4-2, which is very respectable considering their schedule thus far. 
The Irish are facing stiff competition in this early season tournament. They will face highly-touted Colorado State on Friday night. Colorado State is coming off its best season ever with a 27-6 record and a sixth place finish in the National Polls. It was also their fifth straight appearance in the National Tournament. 

The Rams, who are 5-2 and ranked 13th nationally, are led by All-American setter Cindy Cox-Bellin, and outside hitters Jo Haas and Jill Johnson. Haas, who is 6-3, will be formidable challenge for the Irish hitters at the net. Because of her great agility, they will probably have to change their style of play. 
"Colorado State is definitely the favorite to win the tourna­ment just because of the home court advantage," says Lam­bert. 
Colorado State broke the NCAA attendance record last year by filling the stands with an average of 2,200 fans. This should not affect the Irish Friday night since they played

Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo is currently undefeated with eight wins and are ranked 15th in the AVCA National Poll. They return three starters from a team that finished with a record of 19-12. 
"Cal-Poly is a perennial top­twenty team and I expect them to be just as tough this year," stated Lambert. 
Houston has tradition on 
their side. They return only two 
starters from a team that went

previous matches. Lambert ex­

could possibly make their first

Saint Mary's tennis handles UW I Milwaukee 
By MARY KATE COYLE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team garnered a 7-2 victory on Tues­day, as they took on the Uni­versity of Wisconsin in Mil­waukee. With the exception of first flight singles and doubles, the Belles won every match in straight sets. 
"Everyone played well," said Head Coach Deb Laverie, "but I was upset with the doubles because they went in with a complacent attitude. I think they all learned a valu­able lesson that they must keep up the intensity level at all times." 
The freshman tandem of Marie Koscielski and Ellen Mayer, at third doubles, dis­played excellent form, winning in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. 
"They played good, aggres­sive doubles," said Laverie. "They were the only doubles team that kept up their momen­tum throughout the match." 
On Wednesday, the Belles kept their winning streak going, by wiping out Goshen College, 9-0. 
"I was happy because we were stronger going into the match," said Laverie. "I was glad everyone kept the inten­sity up, even though we had a strong lead. " 
The Belles will host the Saint Mary's Invitational this weekend at Leeper Park. The teams competing include But­ler, Xavier, University of Cin­cinnati, DePaul, Valparaiso, Transylvania and DePauw. 
"I don't think we have had the ability in the past," said Laverie, "but this year we have the chance to finish in the top three. If we play to our poten­tial, we can win it."

SMC volleyball drops home opener 
By KRISTINE GREGORY Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team opened its home schedule Tuesday with a tough loss to Hope College. The Belles managed to win only one game with scores of 14-16, 15-10, 6-15 and 12-15. 
Saint Mary's came out looking strong and jumped to a 13-8 lead in the first game, but Hope fought back. Through a tremendous effort, they edged the Belles, 14-16. 
Saint Mary's bolted to a 5-0 lead in the second game. Team­work and concentration led the Belles to a solid 15-10 win. 
The first few points of the third game were intense and close, but Hope College proved to be too much for the Belles as they ran away with the win 6-15. 
With one more chance to stay in the match, the Belles held their own as Hope and SMC ex­changed the lead six times. Despite the strong Belle effort, Hope prevailed and took the game and the match 12-15. 
"A lack of intensity and con­centration were our downfall," commented sophomore Melissa Phillips, "We just weren't together as a team." 
Saint Mary's will have a chance to pull themselves to­gether Friday as they travel to St. Xavier.
