Notre Datne bound for Bayou, BCS matchup 
Irish to face LSU in the Sugar Bowl 
By KEN FOWLER 
News Writer 
It will be "local flavor" ver­sus "national flavor" as Notre Dame will face Louisiana State in the Sugar Bowl at the Louisiana Superdome Jan. 3, and Sugar Bowl CEO Paul Hoolahan lauded the matchup as "just what the doctor ordered" for the struggling New Orleans economy. 
"If I had written this script, I couldn't have written it any better," Hoolahan said in a teleconference with media Sunday night. "This is going to be a tremendous atmos­phere." 
The Sugar Bowl was widely expected to select the Irish. 
The Tigers earned their bid after Southeastern Conference (SEC) foe Florida jumped from No. 4 to No. 2 in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings and earned a spot in the BCS National Championship Game against undefeated No. 1 Ohio State. The SEC champion plays in the Sugar Bowl annually, except when it makes the national title game. 
With its compensatory selec­tion and first at-large pick, the Sugar Bowl grabbed the local favorites from Baton Rouge and the national pow­erhouse from South Bend for the first bowl game in the Superdome since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.

Aidan Project raises awareness 
Sophomore's battle with cancer inspires event to benefit patients, educate ND community 
By JENNIFER METZ News Writer 
Diagnosed with cancer on Sept. 25, Notre Dame sopho­more Aidan Fitzgerald was forced to miss the majority of the fall semester, but he returned to campus this week­end to take part in an e"vent created in his name to raise awareness about cancer in young adults and youth. 
The Aidan Project drew more than 200 participants who sat on the floor of the LaFortune Ballroom from 11 a.m. to 2 

p.m. Saturday to make fleece blankets and hats for a local cancer unit at St. Joseph's Memorial Hospital. 
The finished blankets, dis­played on a table at the entrance of the ballroom, were tied with a tag that read, "The Aidan Project. This blanket was made with love and with care, for each who receives one knows it comes with a prayer." 
Sophomore Chris Esber, Fitzgerald's roommate, said he and his friends were "shocked" to find out that their 19-year­old friend had cancer. They started the project -which was sponsored by Circle K, Knott Hall and the Class of 2009 -to raise awareness about cancer, especially cancer that affects young people. 
"The situation was definitely on [Esber's] mind ... he couldn't believe it happened to his roommate," said Jake Teitgen, a Circle K member. "We decid­ed we hadto do something." 
Teitgen, along with fellow Circle K members Cigi Low and Nicole Koors, helped Esban 
"We did the blanket project last year with Circle K," Esber said. "This year we've made [the collaboration] bigger, responding to this situation." 
Koors said organizers put up more than 100 posters in resi­dence halls and LaFortune to publicize the event. 
"This is the first time I had heard about someone in our age group developing cancer," Teitgen said. "This project is all about awareness and preven­tion."

Health Center nears completion 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
University Health Services will return in January to its former location behind the Main Building after a year-and-a-half absence and $9.5 million of ren­ovations. 
Throughout the overhaul, Health Services has operated out of the old Security building, where Notre Dame Security/Police was located until it moved to the recently con­structed Hammes Mowbray Hall. 
Ann Kleva, director of University Health Services, called the renovations to the Student Health Center building "absolutely phenomenal." 
The updated facility will be much easier to navigate than the old one, Kleva said, and it will have an improved healthcare

Tovvle tabbed for Marshall 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
Senior Meg Towle's passion for and dedication to promot­ing international health as an essential foundation for peace building will take her to the United Kingdom next year as one of the 43 Marshall Scholarship recipients for 2007. 
Towle said she will use her all-expenses paid scholarship to pursue a M.S. of humanitar­ian studies at The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, associated with the University of Liverpool. 
"I like how the program at Liverpool is about -'How do we get public health to work on the ground?"' Towle said. "I think it will be so cool to be there with people from all over the world and to draw from others' experiences. It will definitely be an interna­tional learning experience." 
She expects to complete the 
M.S. in one year and said the scholarship allows for some flexibility as to how she will use the second year. 
"For now I'm saying I'll probably stay on at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, but I could get there and find some other fabulous program," she said. 
Towle said she learned she had been selected for the prestigious award on Nov. 8, the same day she was inter­viewed by a committee in Chicago.

Bands con1pete, raise 
money for charities 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 

Three bands took the stage at Saint Mary's Student Center Lounge Saturday night to battle for studio time and raise money. 
The Battle of the Bands, organized by the Saint Mary's Dance Marathon Committee, was held to raise funds for Riley's Hospital for Children and for the upcoming Dance Marathon in the spring. 
Dance Marathon commit­tee leaders said they were proud of the event's success. The committee's co-presi­dent, Pauline Kistka, said if they broke even financially, the event had raised some awareness in the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities. 
Katius, a pop/punk band from Dayton, Ohio, won the contest and the prize -a recording session with Peak Audio Productions. 
The three bands played to a crowd of about 50 stu­dents, mostly from Saint Mary's. 
Katius' members were mostly high school students, with one St. Clair Community College sopho­more. Katius' connection to Saint Mary's was through one of their member's, who has two sisters at the College. Katius impressed the judges with their per­formance of their original

All I want for 

Christmas 
What's that? I'm in college so I'm not supposed to love Christmas toys any­more? 
I don't believe you. But, even if I am too old to drool over the best merchandise in the Toys 'H' Us 
catalogue, I've  Fran Tolan  
always said  
that you can never be too old  Sports Writer  
to \'.rite a col­ 
unminThe  

Observer ranking the greatest toys ever. 
I've always said that. 
Anyways, let's get this list started. 
My list will rank the greatest Christmas toys ever made. Each toy's ranking is in parentheses. Please understand that toys fall under a huge variety of categories and there's no way I'll be able to cover all ofyour favorites. I'll try my best though. 
Let's begin with the Christma.c; main­stays, the toys that seem to have a per­manent place under millions of trees every year. There are the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls (6). G.l. Joe action figures (5), the Pogo Stick (11), Barbie dolls {8), liteBrite (14) and Lego building blocks (17). 
Of course, there are also the annoying fad toys that show up tor one December and bring about the worst in parents like Sinbad and Arnold Schwartzenegger. A list of ChrLc;tmas toys wouldn't be com­plete without these. They include Tickle Me Elmo (16), the creepy Furby doll (20), and the Tamagotchi (15, because who wouldn't want to clean up an electronic animal's poop during the holiday sea­son?). 
Then we have the toys that every kid wants after watching an awesome movie featuring that toy. The best of this group are the Red Rider B.B. gun from "A Christmas Story" {13, although nowa­days, this may only be considered a toy south of the Mason Dixon line), the TalkBov voice recorder from "Home Alone 2" {7), and the tricycle ridden by that little girl in "The Shining" (just kid­ding, that didn't make the list). 
The rest of the list can be considered a hodgepodge of great memories from the childhoods of people far and wide. Creepy Crawlers (19), Nerf balls (18), Polly Pocket (12), Lincoh1 Logs (10), lionel trains (4), Hot Wheels cars and tracks (3), and those sweet Nerf guns (2) hold special places in many of our hearts. 
You're weleome ifIjust gave you a fla.c;hback to the glory days. 
Note that, in making this list, I disquali­fied generic toys like bicycles, sleds, video games and board games. Also, I steered clear of educational toys because they generally are not fun to play with. Finally, I am sorry if this list is somewhat gender­biased. Actually, no, I'm not. 
Without further ado, I will name the greatest Christmas toy of all time: The Hess Truck. That's right. With a new design every year since 1964, the Hess Truck ic; an affordable, must-have for tons of people every year. 
This year's Hess Truck comes with a helicopter and a flatbed truck, all equipped with flashing lights. The great song on its commercials clinches the top spot for thLc; one-of-a-kind toy. "For Christmaaaaaaaaaaaasss this year ... the Hess truck's here!"

Swedes guard Christmas goat from vandals 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden ­For 40 years it has been torched, vandalized, had its legs cut off and even been run over by a ear. Rut otn­cials in the Swedish city of Gavle are guaranteeing that this year's giant straw Christmas goat -the vietim of Sweden's most violent yule tradition -will survive unscathed. 
The 43-foot-high goat-a centuries-old yule symbol that preceded Santa Claus as the bringer of gifts to Swedish homes -has been burned down 22 times since it was first set up in Gavle's square on Dec. 3, 1966. 
But for its 40th anniver­sary Sunday, officials think they have finally outsmarted the resourceful vandals by dousing the battered ram· with flame-resistant chemi­cals normally used on air­planes.

ND Air Force ROTC spreads holiday cheer 
Field Day benefits underprivileged children 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
A Field Day ushered in the Christmas season at Saint Mary's Saturday as underprivi­leged children visited with Santa Claus and watched per­formances by the Undertones and the Notre Dame Porn Squad Saturday at Angela Athletic Facility. 
Members of the Arnold Air Society {AAS). the service organization associated with Notre Dame Air Force ROTC, and the Silver Wings, the Arnold Air Society's civilian counterpart, hosted the event. 
Notre Dame junior Christine Rini, the organizer of the event and an AAS member, said the children came from various "centers" in the area. 
"Some were from low-income families that go to after school programs," Rini said. "Others were from homeless shelters, and some came from emotion­ally disturbed families.'" 
Volunteers from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's assisted chil­dren with making gingerbread houses, decorating cookies, painting faces and making Popsicle stick reindeer. 
The children had the opportu­nity to take their picture with Santa and then his elves hand­ed out presents, Rini ~aid. The presents the children received came from the Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program. The AAS paid for everything else, includ­ing pizza, supplies and trans­portation. They hired a charter bus to transport children to and from the facility. 
Rini said the Field Day had been in existence for approxi­mately the past five years, but said this is only the second year the event was held in Angela Athletic Facility. 
In the past, the Field Day was held at the Armory, but Rini said the distance from campus was a problem in getting volun­teers from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
"This location is excellent because the basketball court is a relatively closed-off area and it's easier to get volunteers to come out [to help us]." Rini said.

Professor vvrites book on St. Nick 
Story traces modern versions of Santa Claus to medieval roots 
Special to The Observer 

"Saint Nicholas in America: Christmas Holy Day and Holiday," by Rev. Nicholas Ayo, C.S.C., professor emeri­tus in the Program of Liberal Studies at Notre Dame, was recently published by Corby Books. 
The book makes use of ancient and medieval sources as well as more modern and widely familiar poems, sketches and stories to bring Saint Nicholas into sharper focus while avoiding the quarrel of secular and reli­gious holiday makers. "Christ in Christmas," says Father Ayo, "is rooted in every child's memories of an astonishing intervention of love in their life, found, of all places, in their stockings.'' 
It may be difficult to dis­cern in the heroic and daunt­
"ing figure of the fourth cen­tury Bishop of Myra, the "jolly old elf" of Clement Clarke Moore's endearing and sentimental "Twas the Night Before Christmas" poem. The saint whose feast the Catholic Church cele­brates on Dec. 6 may well have been such a pleasantly avuncular gentleman, but he is also remembered as a powerful leader who rescued many young women from sexual slavery, intimidated vengeful emperors, came between the executioner's axe and the neck of a con­demned prisoner, plucked despairing seafarers from perfect storms, and over­whelmed a threatened famine with a miraculous abundance of grain. 
Writing of these older and more stirring accounts of his patron saint, Father Ayo remarks that "it does not take much imagination to wonder if the Santa Claus, who descends upon our roof, or the comic book superman, who swoops down upon our city, owe some of their inspi­ration and the cut of their figure to the original aerial wonder.-worker, good Saint Nicholas." 
He also insists that these older storie.s are far more than hyperbolic folk tales. In recalling the story which inspired Gentile da Fabriano's 15th century painting, "Saint Nicholas Saves a Ship from Sinking," Father Ayo observes that "here is prayer tested and grace pledged whatever the trial. The presence of the Church in Bishop Saint Nicholas overcomes the sink­ing feeling that human life is doomed and we are about to perish in the vicissitudes of history or the personal disas­ters of our lifetime without rescue from a saving God." 
High praise for the book came in an early review by University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy, who recommended its "marvelous blend of scholar­ship and effective narration," adding that Father Ayo "has traced the stories connected to good Saint Nicholas {gen­erous spirit and miracle worker) with the develop­ment in the cultural context of secular America of the Christmas season tradition of jolliness and gift-giving for which Santa Claus is the most popular carrying image.'' 
Undoubtedly, the infectious joy of this plump, ebullient and snowy-bearded saint dis­guises the deadly serious mission he comes to accom­plish, but of course the same could be said of the adorable Baby whose birth he so con­spicuously assists us in cele­brating.

One dead in Islamic religious clash 
BEIRUT -Violent clashes broke out Sunday between Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the capital, leaving one man dead from gun­shot wounds and 21 others injured at a time when tensions throughout Lebanon threaten the country's fragile sectarian and political balance. 
Tension has been running high in Lebanon, particularly since Friday when Hezbollah supporters began an open-ended sit-in in Beirut in an effort to bring down the govern­ment of Prime Minister Fuad Saniora. 
Saniora, emboldened by Arab and interna­tional support for his U.S.-backed govern­ment, vowed on Sunday to stay in office despite the ongoing protests. 
Amid the sound of revolutionary and nationalist songs blaring from protesters' tents set up in the heart of Beirut, a Mass was held at Saniora's office in memory of Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel, who was assassinated by gunmen in a Beirut suburb last month. 
Chavez anticipates election victory 
CARACAS -President Hugo Chavez sought another six-year term Sunday in an election that weighed the popularity of his oil-funded hand­outs to the poor against fears of increasingly authoritarian rule by one of the Bush adminis­tration's most outspoken overseas opponents. 
Chavez anticipated a crushing victory over tough-talking political veteran Manuel Rosales who has galvanized the opposition by promising to unseat a man he accuses of edging the coun­try toward totalitarianism. 
Voters waited for hours in snaking lines, and elections officials predicted a record turnout. An independent AP-Ipsos poll last month gave Chavez a double-digit advantage.

Bush: Changes, troops needed in Iraq 
WASHINGTON -While President Bush acknowledges the need for major changes in Iraq, he will not use this week's Iraq Study Group report as political cover for bringing troops home, his national security adviser said Sunday. 
"We have not failed in Iraq," Stephen Hadley said as he made the talk show rounds. "We will fail in Iraq ifwe pull out our troops before we're in a position to help the Iraqis succeed." 
But he added: "The president understands that we need to have a way forward in Iraq that is more successful." 
The White House readied for an important week in the debate over Iraq: Bush planned a meeting Monday with Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, the Shiite leader of the largest bloc in Iraq's parlia­ment, and awaited the recommendations Wednesday from the bipartisan commission.

Prison guard charged with sex crime 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -A female former cor­rections officer has been charged with felony sexual misconduct after police say she had sex with a 16-year-old male inmate at the Northeast Juvenile Correctional Facility.

Wiley was released from jail on a $3,250 bond and was ordered not to contact the boy. Wiley faces up to four years in prison if she is convicted of the charges. 
Hopefuls prepare for 2008 bid 
Sens. Clinton, Bayh step-up exploratory efforts for White House candidacy 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton met on Sunday with New York's Democratic governor-elect to solicit his support for her likely White House bid, the latest indication she is step­ping up plans to join a growing field of potential contenders for 2008. 
One rival, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, announced Sunday he was establishing an exploratory committee to raise money for a possible presidential run. He expects to decide over the Christmas holidays whether to seek his party's nomination. 
A top aide to Clinton said he did not know when the former first lady would decide about pursuing the presidency or set up an exploratory committee. Clinton aides, however, have begun interviewing possible campaign staffers in recent weeks, Howard Wolfson said. 
Clinton, who long has topped national polls of Democratic hopefuls, spent two hours with Gov.-elect Eliot Spitzer at his Manhattan home. 
"We just had a great, .wide-ranging meeting on so many issues that affect the city, the state and the coun­try," Clinton said as she left the meeting.

IN BRIEF 

Calderon confronts wealth disparity 
MEXICO CITY -As a man who touts creating jobs as the cure-all for Mexico's ills, President­elect Felipe Calderon couldn't be taking office at a better time. 
The economy is projected to expand by as much as 4.8 percent by year's end -its fastest growth in six years -thanks to exploding busi­ness in the construction, automobile and service industries. High oil prices have poured money into government coffers, the peso has remained stable and Mexico is on track to create 1 million jobs this year. 
That makes things much easier for Calderon, who took office Friday promising to build an economy that creates enough jobs so that mil­lions of Mexicans don't have to cross into the United States. 
"Mexico has all it needs to be a country that receives investment and generates employment for its people," Calderon said, voicing optimism in his inaugural address as president. 
The vast divide between rich and poor has fed the social tensions that have rippled across Mexico since Calderon won the July 2 election by less than 1 percent. 

Niche citrus industry still reeling 
JESUIT BEND, La. -Last year's hurricanes flooded Ben Becnel Sr.'s citrus groves with salt­water, thrashed three of his greenhouses and workers' quarters and destroyed or otherwise damaged hundreds of orange trees. 
And he was one of the lucky ones. 

Further south in Plaquemines Parish, Katrina and Rita laid waste to entire communities, destroying houses and livelihoods and threaten­ing the future of the state's prized, niche citrus industry. 
"We've lost a lot before," with hurricanes and freezing temperatures killing trees, if not groves, agricultural agent Alan Vaughn said. But this is different, he said: "With freezes, you could go back and plant trees. Now, the grove is the low man on the list, when you have to rebuild your house." 
With harvest under way and the parish's week­end-long orange festival set to begin Friday, farmers like Becnel, with navel oranges and sat­suma mandarins to sell, are trying to fill strong demand, while older producers such as 73-year­old Gerald Ragas are struggling to start over. 


Pfizer reacts to rising pressure 
Company plans to slash staffafter ending development of key cholesterol drug 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Pfizer Inc. will likely slash staff and accelerate merger and licensing deals as the pres­sure on it to improve its financial performance inten­sified after the weekend's announcement that the company ended develop­ment of a key drug, analysts said. 
Analysts differed on how much they believed Pfizer stock would fall when it opened on Monday. Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said she believed the dividend yield of roughly 4 percent would keep shares from a free fall, but another analyst estimat­ed the stock could plunge to $20 a share.

"I don't think it really hit me until I called my brother, who's a freshman here (at Notre Dame). and was like 'Well, you can come visit me in England next year,"' Towle said. "It's just been kind of surreal." 
She said her application process wasn't an extremely long one; she found out the deadline for the scholarship was Sept. 1 as she was in the process of packing up boxes to go back to school at the end of the summer. 
She approached the applica­tion with the same energy and spirit that has enabled her to do so much with her time at Notre Dame: she said she dug through some boxes to find her computer and just got to work. 
"My first loves are Latin America and Africa," Towle said, and she hopes her study in England will contribute to her ultimate goal of working in international health. 
She said she is especially interested in studying HIV and AIDS in conflict-ridden areas and looking at healthcare for refugees and displaced popu­lations, "especially women's health." 
Towle said her passion for international health was sparked in high school after she traveled to La Paz, Bolivia as part of a medical mission trip with a team of doctors from Kansas, her home state. 
She said her dad, who was traveling as part of the mis­sion, told her that he thought it sounded like a wonderful opportunity and if she could fundraise the money for the trip, she should get on board.

Notre Dame intending to major in pre-med, but decided 

 after freshman year to double major in anthropology and international peace studies. "I was more interested in the health of communities than of individuals," she said. An honors student, Towle has earned a spot on the Dean's List every semester. She was also named one of only 20 Presidential Scholars at Notre Dame when she was a freshman. According to Notre Dame's Office of News and Information, the Presidential Scholars are "recognized as top academic students and potential leaders" in the Notre Dame community. Outside of the classroom, Towle's activism in interna­tional health issues and com­munity education and empow­erment has been evident. During her freshman year, Towle and fellow classmate Steve Cartwright founded LeadND, a program that pro­motes leadership development and service learning among local middle school students. Now in four local schools, LeadND relies on a large num­ber of "wonderful volunteers" from Notre Dame and mem­bers of the local community who have supported the vision of the program, she said. 
Towle said being involved 
at Notre Dame. 
"It's been like a full-time job for me these past few years," Towle said. 
She and Cartwright joke "that we are the grandma and grandpa of the program ... we are currently in the process of transitioning the leadership," she said. 
Other formative experiences during her undergraduate career include time spent studying abroad in Mexico last spring and researching and working in the African nation of Lesotho last summer, Towle said. 
While in Mexico, Towle taught global health to middle school students and did a research project on how glob­alization has affected HIV I AIDS in Mexico, especially the migrant population, she said. 
During her time in Lesotho, she did research on communi­ty-based health and worked at Touching Tiny Lives (TTL), a child's safe home and HIV I AIDS outreach program found­ed by a Notre Dame graduate impacted by his Peace Corps service there, Towle said. 
"TTL is not an orphanage; the whole goal of the program is to re-unify (children with their families)," she said. 
She said she was especially interested in exploring how transmission of HIV from mother to child might be pre­vented. . 
Towle said that a UROP grant enabled her to employ the help of a translator while in Lesotho to aid her in her research. She said that her translator allowed her to "learn so much more by cut­ting down on the language barrier."

Towle said the Foundation "does a lot of fundraising and there is a big effort in further­ing education about issues that affect Lesotho." 
Towle said she would love to see similar Foundations based on the Touching Tiny Lives model directed at supporting other countries. 
Despite all of her academic accomplishments and involve­ment in the local and interna­tional communities, Towle is humble about being chosen for a Marshall Scholarship. 
"This is the effort and sup­port of so many people and a sign of how awesome of a place Notre Dame is," Towle said. ''I'm thankful for that." 
Marshall Scholarships were established in 1953 by an Act of Parliament to enable future American leaders to study in the United Kingdom, to pro­mote an understanding and appreciation of Britain, to con­tribute to intellectual develop­ment in a variety of fields and to motivate scholars to serve as ambassadors from the United States to the United Kingdom and vice versa.

Nevv study questions fast food in hospitals 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Having fast­food restaurants in children's hospitals influences patients'­families to eat fast food and to think that it's relatively healthy, new research sug­gests. 
At least 59 of the nation's 250 children's hospitals have fast-food restaurants, the study found. That is a trou­bling phenomenon, particular­ly given rising obesity rates, said the study's lead author, Dr. Hannah Sahud, a pediatri­cian at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. 
"We're giving two different messages by being in the health care profession and promoting health and saying obesity is a huge medical prob­lem ... and then implicitly encouraging it," she said. 
About 17 percent of U.S. children are considered obese and many doctors think heavy consumption of calorie-laden fatty fast food is partly to blame. 
Sahud conducted the research while at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, which has one McDonald's inside and another across the street. 
Parents of children who got outpatient treatment at Children's Memorial were much more likely to buy McDonald's food on the day their youngsters were treated than parents of kids treated at Chicago-area hospitals without McDonald's, the study found. 
Parents Of kids treated at Children's also were twice as likely to rate McDonald's food as relatively healthy than those whose kids were treated else­where. 
"I was shocked ... that they actually perceive it to be healthier," Sahud said. 
Her study appears in December's Pediatrics, sched­uled for release Monday. 
"Hospitals should be walking the walk, not just talking the talk," said Dr. Sarah Barlow, an obesity specialist at Saint Louis University and Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Cen.ter. She was not involved in the research. 
Children's Memorial spokes­woman Julie Pesch said the hospital chose McDonald's many years ago as a special treat for sick kids going through difficult treatment. 
Pesch said balanced diets can include an occasional fast­food meal, but acknowledged the study shows "doctors and families that we must continue to talk about what constitutes a healthy diet for kids." 
The researchers queried 200 pediatric residency programs ill 2002-03. About 30 percent, or 59, had fast-food restau­rants in their . hospitals. McDonald's alone or in combi­nation with other fast-food restaurants were located in 22. 
The researchers also sur­veyed 386 parents and other adults leaving three Chicago­area hospitals after their chil­dren had outpatient visits. They were Children's Memorial; Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital in Maywood, which uses McDonald's branding but has no McDonald's restaurant; and the University of Chicago's children's hospital, which has no McDonald's restaurant or branding on site. 

The study found that 56 per­cent of participants at Children's Memorial had fast food on the survey day,. com­pared with 29 percent at Ronald McDonald and 33 per­cent at the University of Chicago. Most at all three hos­pitals who had fast food that day chose McDonald's. 
McDonald's has restaurants in more than 30 U.S. hospitals, said spokesman Bill Whitman. 



Pediatricians criticize advertising targeted at children 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Inappropriate advertising contributes to many kids' ills, from obesity to anorexia, to drinking booze and having sex too soon, and Congress should crack down on it, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. 
The influential doctors' group issued a new policy statement in response to what it calls a rising tide of adver­tising aimed at children. The policy appears in December's Pediatrics, scheduled for release today. 
"Young people view more than 40,000 ads per year on television alone and increas­ingly are being exposed to advertising on the Internet, in magazines, and in schools," the policy says. 
Advertising examples cited in the statement include TV commercials for sugary break­fast cereals and high calorie snacks shown during chil­dren's programs and ads for Viagra and other erectile dys­function drugs shown during televised sports games. 
The statement also is critical of alcohol ads that feature cartoonish animal characters; fast-food ads on educational TV shown in schools; maga­zine ads with stick-thin mod­els and toy and other product "tie-ins" between popular movie characters and fast­food restaurants. 

These pervasive ads influ­ence kids to demand poor food choices, and to think drinking is cool, sex is a recreational activity and anorexia is fash­ionable, the academy says. 
Interactive digital TV, expected to arrive in a few years, will spread the prob­lem, allowing kids to click on­screen links to Web-based promotions, the new policy says. 
In response, the academy says doctors should ask Congress and federal agencies to: 
+ 
ban junk-food ads during shows geared toward young children; 

+ 
limit commercial advertis­ing to no more than 6 minutes per hour, a decrease of 50 percent;

+ 
restrict -alcohol ad.s to showing only the product, not cartoon characters or attrac­tive young women; 


+ prohibit interactive adver­tising to children on digital TV. 
The academy also says TV ads for erectile dysfunction drugs should be shown only after 10 p.m. 
Jeff Becker, president of the Beer Institute, an industry group for breweries, said par­ents have more influence than advertising on teens' decisions to drink. He also said brewers work to ensure that beer ads appear in adult-oriented media. For much of the sports programming where beer ads appear, most viewers are at least 21, Becker said. 
"The American Academy of Pediatrics is wrong to blame alcohol advertising for the actions of underage teens who willingly break the law to drink illegally," he said. 
Critics of advertising restric­tions say it's a free-speech issue. But the academy notes that several Western coun­tries, including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and Greece, limit ads directed at children. 
"What kind of society exploits its children and teenagers for money? This is an example of where public 

health re(llly has to trump capitalism," said Dr. Victor Strasburger, lead author of the policy statement and an ado­lescent medicine specialist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. 
Advertising aimed at chil­dren has come under increas­ing scrutiny in recent years, particularly because ofdata showing that growing num­bers of U.S. children -now about 17 percent-are obese. 
Spokespeople for Viacom, whose holdings include TV's Nickelodeon network and MTV, declined to offer immedi­ate comment on the report. Viacom has urged its market­ing partners to advertise healthier products, and is among media companies that have been involved in discus­sions with federal agencies and advocacy groups about advertisers marketing to chil­dren. 
While hard scientific data linking advertising with chil­dren's health ills is lacking, Strasburger said there's com­pelling circumstantial evi­dence suggesting there's a connection. 
Last year, the Institute of 
Medicine agreed that evidence suggesting that TV ads con­tribute to childhood obesity is compelling and said industry should market healthy foods to kids. 
And in September, the Federal Communications Commission said it will study potential links between TV ads and rising rates of obesity in 
U.S. children. The food industry has start­ed to respond. 
Two weeks ago, McDonald's joined nine major food and drink companies in vowing to promote more healthy foods and exercise in their child-ori­ented advertising. And last year Kraft Foods said it would curb ads to young children for snack foods including Oreos and Kool-Aid. 
Harvard psychologist Susan Linn, a co-founder of the Campaign for a Commercial­Free Childhood, praised the academy's policy and said it doesn't overstate the effects of advertising on children. 
''I'm hopeful that policymak­ers will listen," Linn said. Self­regulation in the food industry, without a nudge from govern­ment, won't work, she said.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Each Zahm resident unique 
I would like to compliment The Observer for running the two-part series of stories investigating some of the changes which have taken place in Zahm Hall over the past couple years. 
Before I attended Notre Dame, an aged alumnus told me, "The only thing better than going to Notre Dame is having graduated from Notre Dame!" And despite all of the illicit fun I had there as an undergrad, despite all of the playful jibe I received as a Zahm resident and despite all of the times I had to just stand in front of the Office of Residence Life and Housing and shake my head in bewilderment, I grew from the experience and now can enjoy the best part -being a Notre Dame graduate. 
Alums of Zahm or any other dorm gather and shoot the bull about how "wild" or "crazy" their college days were -right up to the often touted Regis Philbin. I recall his visit to campus clearly, when I was a freshman in Zahm in fall 2001, when, in front of all the lights and cameras, he barged into his former room, 222, jumped in the loft and told all those present what a "crazy" time he had in that room, breaking all the old, silly rules. 
People love to reminisce and tell stories about old tradi­tions or "how things used to be done," mostly because it's a way of reliving those moments without actually having to do them again. Here are two suggestions regarding "stories": 1) they are probably exaggerations, and 2) noth­ing in the present, in reality, can top those memories. 
So what does this mean for the current men of Zahm? Enjoy the elevated status which goes with being a resident in the House. Some will call it a "bad boy" or "whipping boy" image or claim that "it really worries the parents." If you actually believe those things, then you are taking col­lege, and the whole living situation at Notre Dame, way too seriously. Guys living with guys, girls living with girls -the two allegedly not enjoying each other and staying the night together-now that is a joke the rest of the young people in America laugh at (and are extremely puz­zled by, all the same). 

So if Zahm's image counters who you are, fight it; if it doesn't have anything to do with you, ignore it; if it is everything you think you want out of college, embrace it. My point is this: anyone who lives in, or has lived in, Zahm makes choices about who they want to become. Some try to destroy its image, and some have worked very hard to perpetuate it. 
To assume that every resident should align with one ide­ology and not be uniquely creative is outlandish. To force every resident to align with one ideology is not only repressive, but also counterproductive to the educational process. After reviewing The Observer's articles on the changes within Zahm Hall, it appears that the hall's administrative figure, the rector, believes that he should dictate its direction, like a surrogate parent. 
Perhaps what is misunderstood here is that the urge some of the men of Zahm feel to be fraternal, and at the same time be set apart from the typical Notre Dame com­munity, is a normal male attitude during formative years, as is the appeal of bucking authority. I know it exists, because I have been there. The last time I checked, though, college was supposed to be an educational experi­ence for the students, without all of the coddling mentali­ty. 
But that's the way it goes at Notre Dame. So love it'while you can, lead it where you will and leave it when you're ready (or get kicked off campus!). Either way, you will have enough stories to tell all of those freshmen when you are a senior, and hopefully half of them are true. 
And picture this, men of Zahm: life only gets better after you graduate from Notre Dame.

'Animal' term assessed 
Animal nature shouldn't be denied 
It may be in everyone's interest to take a step back from the debate sparked by Daniel Amiri's thought­provoking Letter to the Editor on human nature ("Encourage chasti­ty, not 'free talk,"' Nov. 21), and in true Catholic fashion treat it on a universal scale. 
That being established, and with all due respect to Pope John Paul II, I must assert that his words should be taken within the frame­work of Christian philosophy. If I may be so bold as to use a decided­ly non-religious source, I humbly submit this quote from Wikipedia.org for the consideration of all interested parties: "Humans, or human beings, are bipedal apes belonging to the mammalian species Homo sapiens (Latin for 'wise man' or 'knowing man') under the family Hominidae (known as the great apes)." 
My reflection upon this passage is that while we possess the mental capacity to reflect and improve upon our spiritual nature, we should not neither deny nor debase the animal nature we also possess.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"By swallowing evil words unsaid, no one has ever harmed his stomach." 
Winston Churchill former prime minister Pope's words can be manipulated 

David Spellman ("We are not animals," Nov. 30) recently joined the debate sparked by Amiri ("Encourage chastity, not 'free talk,"' Nov. 21) and Renfro ("Stating the obvious?" Nov. 29) on the nature of mankind. While Spellman's point is certainly stated in most proper Catholic Doctrine, I must ask him this: if the late pope did in fact state that mankind are not, nor never will be animals 'while he [the pope] was most seriously ill and dis­abled in the exercise of his highest func­tion,' then could we not argue that he was very much out of position to make such a judgement, as he himself was bereft of his highest function, which I can only assume is another word for reason? 
But this is almost beside the point of my argument, which is that ifone wishes, one can quote from and extrapolate on the words of the pope in such a way as to make it seem that almost anything is true. For example, on Oct. 28, 1994, the pope made a statement to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences lauding research on the Human Genome. The pope, His Holiness John Paul II, said that it is "an accepted fact that for all living species including man, DNA is the vehicle for hereditary characteristics and their trans­mission to successive generations," the key words being "all living species, includ­ingman." 
Man, in other words, as said by the Holy Father, is a species. That he said this is

incontrovertibly true. Let us now turn to the Oxford English Dictionary, that bastion of our great mother tongue. According to the OED, a species is "A group or class of animals or plants (usually constituting a subdivision of a genus) having certain common and permanent characteristics which clearly distinguish it from other groups." A species is a group or class of animals or plants. 
If we apply that most chief among our human faculties, reason, we can see that if 
(1) mankind constitutes a species and (2) a species is a class of animal or plant, then mankind must he either animals or plants. We have already seen in the section above that mankind are either animal or plant. Considering the quote from the pope pro­vided by Spellman, namely that "a man, even ifseriously ill or disabled in the exer­cise of his highest functions, is and always will be a man, and he will never become a 'vegetable' or an 'animal,"' animals are eliminated and we are left with only one option for the nature of mankind: non-veg­etative plants. 
Neither a vertebrate nor an arachnid nor a cephalopod, neither a broccoloid nor a rutebegatine nor a tomatodate, mankind is left to the domain of sea algae and mushrooms.

Band funding not so simple 
I truly hope tbat I am one of many people replying to Joe Anderson's Letter to the Editor ("Band overlooked," Nov. 29). This letter was a bla­tant insult to the band and I am truly disappointed that it came from one of the ushers, for whom I hold nothing but respect. 
Your letter was disrespectful of the planning and effort that goes into every single Notre Dame game that holds a band performance. Do you think that the band does not want to support our team at every game? If those are indeed your thoughts, you disregard the fact that we are part of the Band of the Fighting Irish. 
I must remind you that we have limited funds and a 380­.member band. This includes, as all those who traveled to USC can attest, airfare, hotel fees, transportation for large instruments and many, many more behind the scenes fees that few in the band, much less the general public, will ever know about. In order to travel to bowl games, some of the money from the bowl is set aside for the band. This is not the case for USC. 
My point is simply this: Robertson should not point fingers at a band who "should understand their responsibili­ty." We understand our responsibilities, and we are only human and need funds as well as the resources to undertake a trip as large as USC. This year we had, thanks to coach Charlie Weis, enough resources for 75 band mem­bers. Maybe in future years there will be more. Perhaps, in order to assist the band in traveling, Robertson would like to make a donation?

True point lost in semantics 
I am writing regarding Alex Renfro's Letter to the Editor ("Stating the obvious?" Nov. 29) and Ryan Bravo's letter ("An attempt at reso­lution," Dec. 1) I write because of how dis­couraged I am that these individuals, who are presumably representative of others who agree with them, found it necessary to com­ment on Dan Amiri's assertion, in his well­written exhortation to the Catholic practice of chastity, that "we are not animals." 
We are mammals, which are a class of ver­tebrates, which are a phylum of animals. I congratulate those who have mastered the science of logic to such degree as to grasp the consequent implication. However, it also takes a "severe disconnect from reality" to think that Amiri's statement of the obvious -that we, unlike dogs, cats and birds, are capable of freely choosing how we act -somehow undermines his argument. 
The issue of contraception is one that does gravely need to be discussed, especially with respect for the Catholic understanding of the matter -one that is characteristically and wrongly dismissed, in the words of Joey Falco, as "putting on Bible Blinders" ("Disloyal fathers," Nov. 20). Though I disagree with Falco, I applaud both he and Amiri for taking the time to share their views; I am one who hopes that respectful and honest discussion ultimately leads to the truth. That issue aside, the debate about whether we can say "we are not animals" is an outrageous distr~ction from a subject of actual consequence. 
Indeed, the condescension implied in Renfro's and Bravo's comments is insulting. It suggests that people with intelligence could not possibly hold the view that human beings are different in significant ways from the rest of the animal kingdom. Bravo's comments resolved nothing; they merely reduced the level of dialogue to name-calling. To pull out a dictionary in this context indicates a severely hyper-inflated ego, as does introducing a let­ter with "I can't believe I'm writing this let­ter." Perhaps, then, it should not have been written. 
Both Renfro and Bravo knew exactly what was meant by Amiri's statement, and their subsequent need to patronize the rest of us with their "enlightened" views on what it means to be human is, in short, dishearten­ing .

CD REVIEWS 

Genuine Rice releases emotion-fill~d album 
Incubus explodes creatively with 'Light Grenades' 
By CHRIS McGRADY Scene Critic 
Perhaps there is such a thing as audio nicotine, and this album will have the lis­tener either smoking two packs a day or chewing enough Nicorette to choke a horse. Incubus' newest effort, "Light Grenades," is the type of CD that once it makes its way to a person's stereo, may stay there for months. This album doesn't simply ask to be listened to -it demands it. 
The members of Incubus compare their music to art. When lead singer Brandon Boyd was asked to describe his style of making and performing music, he said, "I am tapping into a place in you that is unex­plored, and very dangerous, but I think essential to the creative life of an artist." Incubus stays true to this form and contin­ues to push the proverbial musical enve­lope, never settling into one style of music for an entire album, not to mention an entire career. 
Rather than allow the band to slip into a on the album is going to be good. It

rut of "don't fix what's not broken," Incubus continues to change its sound, and has done so since its beginning. The band, orig­inally formed in 1991 (while the members were in lOth grade), consisted of Boyd, Mike Einsiger (guitar), Alex Katunich (a.k.a. Dirk Lance, bassist) and Jose Pasillas (drums). Later they added DJ Lyfe (Gavin Koppel). Since then, the only things that have changed are the presence of Katunich, who has since been replaced by Ben Kenney and the replacement of DJ Lyfe with DJ Kilmore (Chris Kilmore). 
For the first four years of its existenc:e, Incubus spent most of its time touring and slowly making a name for itself, honing a sound from the likenesses of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn. and the Deftones. With the release of "Fungus Amongus," Incubus departed from the musical homogeneity of the pop-rock scene and found its own niche in a crowded genre. At times sound­ing like metal, at times like fluid pop and at other times funk. Incubus stretches its musical identities to the max, and "Light Grenades" proves this can be deftly done. 
It's evident early and intelligence.

the chorus's repetitive nature is altogeth­er unsettling, and in a way that detracts from Hice's aesthetic of lovelorn sullen­ness. 
"Me, My Yoke and I" functions in the same way. Normally, the raw quality of Hice's voice adds to the overall effed of his music. With this song in particular, the formerly deliciously desperate vocals become unnecessary whining. 
Hice characteristically expresses him­self throughout "9" with both whispers and yawps, as heard in particular in "Dogs," the album's fifth track. "Dogs" exemplifies Hice's ability to create an uncommon intimacy with his listeners, and the closeness of his feelings and expressions benefit "9" as a whole. 
Other strengths of the album include "Coconut Skins," with its wryly dirty lyrics and welcome acoustic guitar, and "Grey Room," which returns triumphantly to Rice's earlier musings on love's disap­pointments. These two tracks depart musically from others like "Me, My Yoke and I" and use Hice's talents to emphasize his overall themes. "Accidental Babies" is also a highlight, with its seemingly asi­nine series of questions that ultimately create a sense ofloss and longing. 
"9" is an album ridden with its own troubles. But its strengths, which stem from the appeal of Hice's raw earnest­ness, override its frustrating weaknesses. By the peacefully lengthy final track, "Sleep Don't Weep," Rice has drawn in his willing listeners with intoxicating tales of bitter loss, and with that. he succeeds.

A step behind 
Late rallyfalls short, Irish lose to Tar Heels 2-1 in NCAA finals 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate SportS Editor 
CARY, N.C. -After 26 games, Notre Dame finally met its match. North Carolina dominated the previously unbeaten Irish for most of the game en route to a 2­1 victory and a National Championship Sunday in the Women's College Cup fmal at SAS Stadium. 
''I'm not disappointed in my team, but I am disappointed for them," Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum said. "I thought we had a good chance to win this one." 
The quicker and stronger Tar Heels outshot the Irish 20-9, con­trolled possession for most of the game and took a 2-0 lead early in the second half. Notre Dame made a late run, scoring with 10 minutes left in the game, but could not complete the come­back. 
The deficit was the first time the Irish seniors had been down 2-0 in their careers. 
"I thought we responded to being down okay," Waldrum said. "But we shouldn't have gotten down like that in the first place." 
The Irish ~ere denied their second National Championship in three years, while North Carolina won its 18th NCAA title and its first since 2003. 
Notre Dame finished its season 25-1-1, while the Tar Heels set a school record for wins with 27 against one loss. 
The sellout crowd of over 8,000 was clad mostly in Carolina blue and the Tar Heels even took a pep band on the 25 minute trip down I-40. But Waldrum said the hostile atmosphere had nothing to do with the outcome of the game. 
"It was loud, but once that whistle blows the crowd doesn't matter all that much," he said. "Maybe when you're right down near the goal and they start yelling you can hear it, but it shouldn't effect you too much." 
The Tar Heels scored their first goal with 28 minutes left in the first half. Forward Heather O'Reilly made a run down the left side with no Notre Dame defend­ers in sight. Irish goalkeeper Lauren Karas ventured well out of the box to try to cut O'Reilly off. 
Karas went for a slide tackle but whiffed and O'Reilly put the ball easily into the empty net for a 1-0 lead. 
The defensive breakdown put the Irish on their heels. "For the first fifteen minutes or so, I thought we were all right," 

Waldrum said. "But that first goal, the way it happened, took the wind out of our sails a little bit." 
The Tar Heels almost added to their lead with 18 minutes left in the half on a shot from just out­side the box by forward Whitney Engen, but Karas made a diving save to keep Notre Dame in the game. 
North Carolina continued to pressure the Irish net, forcing Karas to make another diving save with one minute left before halftime. Forward Sterling Smith beat Irish defender Kim Lorenzen and got a shot off, but once again Karas made the play to keep the deficit at one. 
Notre Dame had a solid chance to score just before the half, when forward Brittany Bock flicked on a free kick with her head but midfielder Amanda Cinalli couldn't get to it before Tar Heel keeper Anna Rodenbaugh smothered the ball. 
At halftime, North Carolina had outshot the Irish 10-2. 
Immediately after the break, the Tar Heels scored again. Forward Casey Nogueira streaked into the. box and headed a perfect cross from Engen into the net for a 2-0 lead with 43 minutes left. 
Notre Dame made a game of it in the last 10 minutes, scoring with nine minutes left to play. Sophomore forward and Hermann Award winner Kerri Hanks lofted the ball into the box, where Bock emerged from a crowd to head it into the net and cut the lead to one. 
"Getting a goal gave ~s some confidence," Cinalli said. "Unfortunately, we couldn't get in another one." 
After the score, the Irish went into an all-out attack mode, send, ing nearly every player forward and generating several more chances. 
"Sometimes you play better when you have nothing to lose," Waldrum said. 
The best Irish opportunity after the goal came with eight minutes left. A flip throw-in by freshman Michele Weissenhofer bounced around in the box, but Rodenbaugh managed to coral it and end the threat. 
Hanks also had one last effort for Notre Dame, earning a free kick just outside the box with one minute remaining, but her shot flew just to the right of the net. 
"It was really close," Cinalli said. "Itjust barely missed." 
While Waldrum was pleased with the late rally, he wondered aloud after the game why his team didn't wake up until the game was almost over. 
"I like our intensity in the last fifteen minutes," he said. "But we should have played like that for the entire game." 

Notre Dame 2, Rorida State 1 
Notre Dame scored twice in less than two minutes late in the first half, then held off a furious Florida State comeback attempt to win a 2-1 thriller Friday to advance to the final against the Tar Heels. 
Notre Dame freshman mid­fielder Courtney Rosen put the Irish up 1-0 with nine minutes left in the first half. Rosen, who had come into the game for Weissenhofer five minutes before, took a pass on the right flank, juked a defender and rock­eted a shot past Florida State goalie Ali Mims. 
"I heard [Mims] was a little ten ­tative with the ball in the air," 
Rosen said. "So I was like, 'why not?' and I let it fly." The goal was Rosen's second of her career. 
The Irish scored again barely two minutes later, with a corner kick by Hanks landing right on the head of Bock, who knocked the ball toward senior Jill Krivacek. Krivacek and a Seminole defender both went for the ball, which went off the Florida State player and into the net. 
Krivacek was credited with the goal. 
"I was right there and I had good enough position that whichever of us touched it, it was probably going in the net," Krivacek said. "But she was the one who headed it, not me." 
The Seminoles (18-4-4) had controlled possession for most of the half, but were unable to gen­erate many chances. Florida State had more corner kicks than Notre Dame in the first half, 5 to 3, but was outshot 9-2. 
Waldrum said he was con­cerned at halftime because the Irish had not been as dominant in the first half as the scoreboard indicated. 
"Being up two is probably the most dangerous lead you can have," he said. "Sometimes you would rather maybe be up by just one, because you don't want to sit on a two-goal lead, but you don't want to give up a quick goal either." 
The Seminoles kept the pres­sure on after the break and cut the lead to one early in the sec­ond half. Senior India Trotter blew past Irish freshman defend­er Haley Ford and beat Karas. 
Trotter had started the game at left back, but Seminoles coach Mark Krikorian moved her up front after Florida State fell behind 2-0. It was Trotter's eighth goal of the year, second on the Seminole team. 

"We thought we had some matchups today with her attack­ing that would work for us, and I guess they did," Krikorian said. 
Soon after the goal, Trotter moved back to defense, a move which "relieved" Waldrum. 
"India Trotter is a great athlete, and she was really creating some havoc against us," he said. 
Florida State had a golden chance to tie the game with 23 minutes left. A Seminoles free kick flew into the box and was headed toward the net. Karas missed it, but it hit the cross bar and bounced to the ground, where the Irish keeper knocked it out of bounds. 
Florida State got two shots off on the ensuing corner kick, but both were deflected. 
"We were under a lot of pres­sure," Notre Dame defender Christie Shaner said. "We had to get organized because players were running free." 
Late in the game, Krikorian removed Mims and put a· goalie jersey on junior defender Libby Gianeskis in order to get a quick­er, more offensive lineup into the game. 
"We've been working on that for a few months," Krikorian said. "If we're in a desperate situ­ation where we need a goal, that's usually what we go to. There's no difference to me between losing two to one and three to one." 
The strategy almost paid off, with the Seminoles getting two major scoring chances with less than 15 minutes to play. 
The first, with 13 minutes left, came on a through-ball .to for­ward Kelly Rowland. Rowland was one-on-one with Karas, but the Irish keeper smothered the ball before the Florida State sen­ior could get a shot off. 
Ten minutes later, the Seminoles had a two-on-one break down the right flank, but Notre Dame freshman defender Amanda Clark, the only Irish player left on that side, managed to clear the ball. 
The Irish counter-attacked after the clear and junior for­ward Susan Pinnick found herself running free behind Gianeskis, who had moved up almost to midfield. Gianeskis recovered just in time to harass Pinnick's shot, which rolled just wide of the open net.

Senior class leaves behind impressive legacy 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 

CARY, N.C. -Somewhere underneath the tears of the Irish seniors following their 2-1 College Cup loss to North Carolina twin­kles the glowing accomplishments of a class that made its long­awaited return to the champi­onship stage. · 
Friday's semifinal victory over Florida State gave Notre Dame its 92nd win over the past four years, surpassing the soccer Class Of 1997's 91 victories for the most wins by a Notre Dame senior class in the program's history. 
The loss brought the senior class's career record to 92-8-3 over the past four years, a mark second in the country to only North Carolina's 97-3-3 stretch over that same time 
But at Notre Dame, success is measured in National Championships. Like the class of 1997, these seniors won a College Cup title as sophomores, when they defeated UCLA in a shootout at the same site as this weekend's matches. Sunday they attempted to become the first Irish team to win two titles and the first pro­gram besides North Carolina to win three. 
"This senior class for us amazes me," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said after the game. "Ever since we've been here we've been asked Carolina this and Carolina that and the aura of Carolina and all that stuff .... I think in terms of set-

ting a legac)', thic; group of seniors has been to ... two [College Cup semifinals] and won a National Championship. And that's equal to what North Carolina has done in the last five years as well." 
After the loss, Irish coach Randy Waldrum said it was hard to talk to a group that had already won one title, but was so broken because they just lost their chance to win another. 
"You never as a coach want to have that conversation. I want to be on the other side of that like [Noth Carolina coach Anson Dorrance is]," Waldrum said. "I think this group's has been special and helped us form our own lega­cy as well. I think the kids deserve to be looked at on a national scene the way that we feel like we are. We just hope that we'll be back. For the seniors, I thank them for all they've done." 
Senior midfielder and All­Tournament midfielder Jill Krivacek said that at the end of the game, the long journey of the class just began to come into focus. 
"Everything at that moment seemed to flash before us -for me at least," Krivacek said. "The four years playing with my best friends and the friendships that we developed, the National Championship in 2004, and I think now we have a little better per­spective. But it'll be a few years from now that we really realize that it was a great four years." 
In addition to the 2004 title, Krivacek said one of the great legacies left by the seniors is their dominance at Alumni Field, where they posted a 53-2-1 reeord and had not lost since Miehigan beat them 1-0 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament during their freshman year. 
"[Senior forward] Molly [Iarocci] and I were talking about this [Saturday) night," she said. "That we felt for the girls who had to go off on a loss losing at home at Alumni. I think what we took pride in as a senior class is we never had [anotlmr] loss at Alumni Field in our four years. We pro­tected our home field." 
The seniors dominated in their showing at Alumni Field, knocking off No. 8 Penn State 4-0 in front of their home crowd. 
"That game against Penn State was a great way to leave Alumni Field," Krivacek said. 
Even after stumbling in their final act, Krivacek has no regrets. 
"We hadn't played North Carolina in our four years and there's no other way to go out than to play Carolina," she said. "Unfortunately we didn't win, but it was a very good Carolina team." 
It was also a very good Notre Dame team, one that carried a No. 1 ranking and its aceompanying bullseye almost the entire season. It was the type of team that elicit­ed those same kinds of remarks from the teams the Irish brought down on the way to Cary. When the Irish beat Colorado 3-0 at home in the Sweet 16, Buffaloes midfielder Katie Griffin was thankful for the opportunity to go

"If you have to lose to somebody you might as well go out to the number one team in the nation. We've never played Notre Dame before."

Hanks, Lapira each win Her111ann trophy 
Notre Dame first to have both menIs and womenIs honoree 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Across the board, Notre Dame took home a consider­able amount of hardware this weekend. 
Sophomore forward Kerri Hanks won the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy Award for the best Division I women's college soccer player, and junior forward Joseph Lapira took home the same award on the men's side. Together, they helped Notre Dame to become the first ever school to have players win both the men and women's Hermann Trophy in the same season. 
"I think it's pretty well known that Notre Dame has one of the best programs in the country, but this certain­ly reinforces that," Irish men's coach Bobby Clark said. 
As a sophomore, Hanks became the 
sons at Notre Dame, Hanks has tallied 136 points ­only former SMU player Lisa Cole (147) and former UC Santa Barbara standout Carin Jennings (14 7) had more in their first two respective seasons. 
This past season, Hanks led the nation in both goals 
(22) and assists (21) becom­ing only the eleventh player in NCAA history to break 20 in both categories. Hanks joins former UNC and national team star Mia Hamm as the only players to ever lead the nation in both goals and assists, and Hanks hopes that the comparisons between the two players won't end there. 
"It's always been my goal to play for the national team," Hanks said. "My time is not yet but hopefully it will come later. I think more about the team now than individually. To be the best player in the world is not something I am too worried about." 
Lapira, who traveled to St. Louis this weekend to receive the Hermann Trophy at the Missouri Athletic 
Club, becomes

"I've spent 20 plus years coaching in college soccer, and I've never had one of my players win player of the year, so obviously it's a very special moment for this pro­gram," Clark said. 
Lapira led the nation in both goals (22) and points 
(50) this season, but perhaps more impressively, he did it playing with an injured knee. Lapira tore his left lat­eral meniscus in the first game of the season against UAB, but he made a joint

end," Irish coach Randy 
Waldrum said. ''I'm proud that we showed that kind of heart. You find the positives in a big game like that. I just wished we could've done it a little bit earlier." 
The Irish faced more pres­sure than they had seen all year. Tar Heels swarmed to wherever the ball was, suffo­cating Irish players and pre­venting them from establish­ing an offensive rhythm until the end of the second half. 
North Carolina outshot Notre Dame for the first time all year, 20-9. That's a hard deficit to overcome, especially to North Carolina. 
"I was quite honestly shocked that we didn't come out and have that kind [of1 intensity that we had the last 15 minutes," Waldrum said. 
Though junior goalkeeper Lauren Karas might like a do­over on the first goal, she kept her team within striking dis­tance by laying out in the air and on the ground for two breathtaking first half saves. 
Notre Dame brought a lot Sunday, but when you play Carolina, a lot isn't good enough. You have to bring everything you have, and then find something extra before it's too late. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, time ran out before they could find it.

"Some would consider it nice not to practice, but it killed me to not be able to go out there and play in practice," Lapira said. "It was kind of a day-to-day thing whether my knee would make it through or not."

"This was arguably the best season that Notre Dame has ever put together," Lapira said. "Arguably, the reason we went so far was the leadership of our sen­iors, and we're going to have to try and fill that hole next year."

Perennial Christmas favorites foster holiday spirit 

THEATER REVIEW 
'Putnam' fuses music, comedy, spelling bees 
By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Critic 
The Chicago production of "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee" is a hilarious show that loves its audience. Irresistible characters, a strong message and a wonderful way of involving viewers drive the show to its heights. 
"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee" deserves its Tony for best book. It tells the story of six middle-school students strug­gling through puberty, overseen by adults who don't appear to have made completely it through the process either, as they com­pete in the county spelling bee. "Putnam County Spelling Bee" is fueled by its charac­ters. From Mitch Mahoney, the official "com­fort counselor" serving his parole handing out juice boxes to eliminated contestants, to William Barfee, the contestant with one working nostril, a severe peanut allergy and a magic foot, to vice principal Douglas Panch, whose recovery from the 20th annu­al bee "incident" is a little uncertain, every character works his or her way into your heart. 
"Putnam County Spelling Bee" isn't afraid to interact with its audience. Before the show, audience members are interviewed and four are selected to actually perform as spellers in the show. The rest of the audi­ence is then treated not as a theatre audi­ence, but as the audience of the spelling bee. In the beginning, the host walks through the crowd welcoming the audience to the bee, certain members are pointed out as charac­ter's "family," and the first character to be eliminated is then exiled to work for booster club selling candy. The character rebels by throwing candy and chips out at the audi­ence. The interactive element of "Putnam County Spelling Bee" keeps the audience involved and makes every show different. 
Though at first glance "Putnam County Spelling Bee" seems to be solely a comedy, the musical has real depth. The central theme can be summed up in the lyric "the best spellers don't necessarily win." "Putnam County Spelling Bee" stresses the rea<;ons the spellers are there and why they want (or don't want) to win. Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre, the adopted 
daughter of a gay couple, continually fights to illustrate their ability to raise a child. Olive Ostrovsky tries to battle on despite the absence of both her parents. "Putnam County Spelling Bee," unlike most musicals, also keeps itself up to date, thanks to the cast's ad-libbed com-

Between the finals, papers and general stress of the end of the semester, the fact that Christmas is around the corner sometimes gets lost. 
But fear not. Christmas trees are appearing across campus, Christmas music is playing on the radio, and televi­sion stations are starting to play all of the classic favorites. 
There is something about Christmas movies that makes it feel like it's the holi­day season again. Whether it's because they were all we watched for a month when we were kids or because of their sweet nature, it's not Christmas without a certain few. 
10. "It's a Wonderful Life"-There can't be a Christmas movie list without this Frank Capra film starring James Stewart. This touching story reminds us of the importance of life, pure and sim­ple. 
9. "Rankin/Bass Christmas Specials"­These famous stop-motion and animated shows, including "Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer." "The Year Without a Santa Clause," "The Little Drummer Boy," "Frosty the Snowman," "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" and "Jack Frost," have played on TV stations ever since they premiered in the 1960s. Something about their simple animation and spirit­ed spins on some of the classic Christmas stories makes them appealing

year in and year out. 
8. "Miracle on 34th Street" -I remember watching both versions of this movie over and over again right before Christmas. Cynicism disappears as we all start believing in Santa Clause again, even just for a little while. 
7. "Little Women"-All right. It isn't really a Christmas movie. But it gives me that snowy and cozy Christmas feel­ing, so it's included anyway. "Little Women" is the perfect story of family love (set among some great snow scenes) that inspires you to spend more time with your own. 
6. "Meet Me in St. Louis"-This movie could be included solely because it is the birthplace of the song "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," sung by Judy Garland, but its sweet love sto­ries make it all the better. 
5. "The Santa Claus"-Starring Tim Allen, this is one of the funniest Christmas movies and definitely one of the best in recent years. The story of what happens when Santa gets replaced by the unlikeliest of men, "The Santa Clause" will warm your heart either from sincerity or laughter. 
4. "The Small One"-I have yet to find anyone else who remembers this one, but I can't resist including the movie I had practically memorized as a little girl that made me cry every time. A short 1978 Disney animated cartoon, "The Small One" tells the story of a boy who must part with his pet donkey, but the only one who will buy him is the tan­ner. When all hope seems lost, a man offers to buy the donkey, so that he can bring his pregnant wife to Bethlehem. 
3. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ­Your head may not be screwed on just right if you can resist the original ani­mated version. Dr. Seuss' unforgettable story of the mean and cynical Grinch who sets out to destroy Christmas for the Whos helps us remember that it can come without "packages, boxes, or bags!" 
2. "A Christmas Carol" -Whether it stars Alastair Sim, Patrick Stewart or the Moppets, you can't go through the Christmas season without watching some version of Dickens' classic tale. 
1. "A Charlie Brown Christmas"-In my favorite, Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the gang get past the com­mercialism of Christmas and find out, as Linus says, what "Christmas is all about." This movie is the epitome of everything Christmas. It's a childhood memory, it's sweet and funny and it reminds us that Christmas is a celebra­tion of the birth of our Savior, Christ the Lord. 

Have a Merry Christmas!

While it is unlikely the musi­cal's songs will become standards or attain success on their own -there are not many full solos -they are fun to listen to and express the feelings of the characters very well. The songs are simple, reflecting the young age of the singers, but they narrate what the characters are thinking and pack in a lot of comedy. The Chicago cast did a wonderful job. The children are all played by adults who act so well it's hard to imagine they aren't in ele­mentary school. Many of the actors also play 

multiple roles, switching from one to the other with ease. 
"Putnam County Spelling Bee" evokes laughter throughout the entire performance, all while delivering a strong message and vivid characters. A trip to Chicago is well worth getting a ticket to an 1-R-R-E-S-I-S-T-· I-B-L-E musical.

NEW YORK-Florida beat Michigan on Sunday in the only game that mat­tered. 
The Gators, who lobbied hard for this victory, were picked to play No. 1 Ohio State for college football's Tostitos BCS Championship Game, ending any chance for the Wolverines to get the rematch they so desired and thought they deserved. 
After the numbers were crunched, it was Florida ­barely. The Gators had a BCS average of .944, and the Wolverines were close behind at .934. The teams were tied in the computer rating, but Florida had a 38-point lead in the Harris poll and a 26-point advan­tage in the coaches' poll. 
The close selection was sure to set off renewed calls to scrap the Bowl Championship Series and go to a playoff. 
Southern California was a step away from the title game if only it had beaten UCLA on Saturday. Instead, the second-ranked Trojans were upset 13-9, dropping in the standings and clear· ing the way for Florida (12­
1) or Michigan (11-1). 
The Gators leapfrogged idle Michigan by winning the Southeastern Conference championship game, 38-28, over 
IN BRIEF 
UC-Santa Barbara mens 
soccer takes championship 
ST. LOUIS, Mo. -Nick Perera had a goal and an assist and unseeded UC-Santa Barbara beat UCLA 2-1 Sunday to win the program's first national title and second champi­onship in school history. 
Perera banged the Gauchos' first shot off the left post and into the UCLA goal to make it 1-0 less than 3 minutes into the game. Tyler Rosenlund carried the ball deep into the box before passing it back to an unmarked Perera, who had plenty of time to settle it and take the shot. 
The Gauchos (17 -7 -1) took a 2-0 lead in the second half. Perera col­lected a pass in the UCLA box from Bryan Byrne and flicked the ball to an open Eric Avila, who slid it into the bottom left corner of the goal. 
The UC-Santa Barbara victory came less than a day after it played 110 scoreless minutes in its semifi· nal victory over Wake Forest. 
Arkansas. 

"It's well deserved, and I'm proud of it," said Florida coach Urban Meyer on the Gators' selection. 
The championship game is Jan. 8 in Glendale, Ariz. 
Michigan's consolation prize is a Rose Bowl bid to play USC, a classic Big Ten vs. Pac-10 matchup of teams left to wonder what could have been. 
For the first time in the BCS's eight-year history, the championship matchup was a mystery heading into selection Sunday. 
When the Wolverines ended their regular season with a 42-39 loss to the Buckeyes two weeks ago, they talked about getting another swing at their Big Ten rivals. 
While Michigan was left to wait and hope, the other contenders still had games to play. 
Florida made its final case by beating Arkansas, but second-year coach Meyer became very vocal about getting a chance to play Ohio State, especially when it appeared the Gators would be left out. 
"It's an imperfect sys­tem," said Meyer of the BCS. "If you want a true national championship, the only way to do it is on the field." 
Ohio State coach Jim Tressel, however, is not in favor of a playoff. 
Tiger to build his first golf 
course in Dubai 
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates ­Tiger Woods said Sunday he will develop his first golf course in Dubai, an oil-rich city that hosts two European Tour events and has seen a recent rise in golf course construc­tion. 
The Tiger Woods Dubai will fea­ture a 7,700-yard, par-72 course, a 60,000-square-foot clubhouse, a golf academy, 320 exclusive villas and a boutique hotel with 80 suites. 
"I look at this project not only as an opportunity, but also as a great responsibility," Woods said. 
Dubai already has eight golf cours­es, including the Emirates Golf Club, which hosts the Dubai Desert Classic. Woods won the tournament earlier this year in a playoff over Ernie Els. Woods lost in Dubai five years ago when he made double bogey on the fmal hole to finish two shots behind Thomas Bjorn. 

Safin victor_y clinches Davis Cup for Russia 
MOSCOW -Admitting he was downright scared, Marat Safin com­posed himself and won the Davis Cup title for Russia. 
The two-time Grand Slam champi­on had 16 aces in beating Jose Acasuso 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5) on Sunday in the fifth and deciding match, giving Russia a 3-2 decision over Argentina for its second Davis Cup crown. 
"There were some very difficult moments today," Safin said. "It was tough to control the match. Everything worked out." 
Safm lost his opening singles match Friday, blaming the indoor carpet at Olympic Stadium. But neither the sur­face nor lingering knee injuries stopped him this time. 
"This is probably the most impor­tant win in the last two years," Safin said. "I was under pressure and I was pretty scared," Safin said.

Steelers finally find stride against Tampa Bay 
Pittsburgh dominates; Titans victorious on late 60-yard field goal 
Associated Press PITTSBURGH The Pittsburgh Steelers saw last week what happens when a hur­ried quarterback has no time to make throws, set up in the pock­et or get any rhythm going. Too bad for them they waited until it was too late in the season to figure out how to do the same. The Steelers didn't do much on offense for the second week in a row, but it didn't make much dif­ference as they capitalized on repeated mistakes by Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Bruce Gradkowski to beat the Buccaneers 20-3 on Sunday. In a matchup of two of the league's most disappointing teams, Ben Roethlisberger bounced back from one of the worst games of his three-s·eason career to throw touchdown passes to tight ends Jerame Tuman and Heath Miller _ both times after the Bucs (3-9) turned the ball over. The Steelers (5-7) entered with a league-high 30 turnovers, but this time limited themselves to one turnover while Tampa Bay gave away the ball four times _ and, with it, the game _ in lo~ing their sixth in seven games. The Bucs have scored only five touchdowns in losing all six road 
games this season. 
Roethlisberger was sacked nine times and threw two inter­ceptions last week in a 27-0 loss to Baltimore that effectively ended any chance the Super Bowl champion Steelers had of repeating. He wasn't that much better against Tampa Bay, com­pleting fewer than half of his 25 passes against one of the league's weakest pass defenses, but did throw scoring passes of 16 yards to Miller and 2 to Tuman. He also was sacked only once. 
The Bucs avoided their second shutout when Matt Bryant kicked a 27-yard field goal on the final play, promoting coach Jon Gruden to say, "I probably will get criticized for it." 
"There's kind of an unwritten rule against it but, if I had been them, I probably would have kicked it, too," Steelers line­backer Joey Porter said. 
Roethlisberger (12-of-25 for 198 yards) threw his league-high 20th interception less than four minutes in, making him the first Steelers quarterback since Cliff Stoudt in 1983 to throw that many. Stoudt had 21 intercep­tions in his one and only Steelers season as a starter. 
New Orleans 34, San Francisco 10 
Like his father, Reggie Bush was a 49ers fan growing up. 
Not on Sunday. 
With San Francisco in town, Bush's father, LaMar Griffin, attended a game in the Louisiana Superdome for the first time since his son turned pro, wearing Bush's No. 25 Saints jersey. Bush delighted his parents and everyone else wear­ing black-and-gold, showing like never before that all those elec­trifying plays he made in high school and college could trans­late to the NFL. 
"Obviously, I haven't had the flashy runs or the breakthrough game like everybody has been expecting, but at the same time, I'm adjusting to the NFL. I'm learning," Bush said. "It's the kind of a game I've been waiting for, too. It finally eame today." 
Bush tied Joe Horn's franchise record by scoring all four of the Saints' touchdowns and gained 168 total yards as New Orleans beat the San Francisco 49ers 34­
10. The victory helped New Orleans (8-4) remain alone in first place in the NFC South, while reducing the 49ers (5-7) to playofl"longshots. 
Most of Bush's gains were modest, but his stunning accel­eration, fancy footwork and leaping ability were evident in all of his touchdowns and numerous drive-sustaining plays. He finished with 131 yards on nine receptions and 37 yards on 10 rushes. 
It was fitting that Bush looked more comfortable than he had previously in his young pro career, since so many elements from his past had converged in this game. 

San Francisco quarterback Alex Smith was Bush's high school quarterback in San Diego. They won a pair of champi­onships together. Their high school coach also was at the game. And Bush said he needed an outlet after watching his school, Southern California, lose its chance for a national title by falling to rival UCLA a night ear­lier. 
"I was sick last night. I wanted to throw up. I couldn't believe they lost," Bush said. "I had a lit­tle extra aggression and I want­ed to take it out on the 49ers." 
Tennessee 20, Indianapolis 17 
Magic is in the air around the Tennessee Titans. Just ask Rob Bironas. 
Bironas kicked a 60-yard field goal -the franchise's longest ever -with 7 seconds left, and the Titans upset Indianapolis for their first victory over the Colts since December 2002 and their second straight amazing come­back. 
The team that tied for the NFL's second-biggest comeback in the final 10 minutes last week against the New York Giants struck again Sunday against the Colts (1 0-2), who had lost only four of their previous 36 games. 
With the wind at his back, Bironas needed every gust to lift the longest field goal in his short career over the crossbar for his second consecutive game-win­ning kick. He became the sixth kicker in NFL history to connect from 60 yards or better. 
"I needed that wind behind me today," Bironas said. "It was all at my back ... I let the wind take it the rest of the way." 
Peyton Manning said the wind was a big factor for the Titans in the fourth quarter, and never bigger than on Bironas' field goal. 
"The guy made a heck of a kick," Manning said. 
The Titans (5-7) didn't trail by 21 this time, but they were down 14-0 in the first half before start­ing this comeback with 10 points just before halftime. They inter­cepted Manning twice, and Vince Young threw for two touchdowns and used his legs to help keep the ball away from the two-time NFLMVP. 
Indianapolis needed a victory to clinch the division for a club­record fourth straight year and its seventh playoff berth in eight years. Seemingly easy enough for a franchise that had won 12 straight divisional games coming into Sunday. 
Instead, the Colts blew a 14­point lead for the first time coach Tony Dungy could remem­ber and lost to the Titans for the first time in eight games. 
"They make a 60-yard field goal, and you take your hat off to them. We put ourselves in that position where a field goal beats you, and it did," Dungy said.

Arizona easily tops struggling St Louis 
Cardinals win 34-20; Cowboys defeat NFC East rivals New York; Patriots edge Detroit 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -The normally soft-spoken Marc Bulger had to speak up: St. Louis had just lost to the Arizona Cardinals at home, and the Rams' mis­takes Sunday made it obvious to the quarterback that some of his teammates are no longer committed. 
"I know there's some guys in here who don't care," Bulger said after a loss to Arizona that touched off a flurry of fin­ger-pointing. 
Prized by his coaches for his . calm demeanor, the quarter­back kept his voice down and didn't single out anyone after the Rams (5-7) were whistled for a season-high 126 yards in penalties. What eats at Bulger, he said, is the repeated mis­takes throughout the season. 
"There's more than one guy in this locker room that could care less that we're losing, or thinks it's OK to make mis­takes," he said. "When we get embarrassed and you think it's OK and keep making the same mistakes, it's not OK." 
Everything seemed OK for Arizona (3-9) on Sunday. Marcel Shipp scored three touchdowns, Edgerrin James had 115 yards rushing and Matt Leinart won for the sec­ond time in seven pro starts for Arizona, which made the most of the Rams' mistakes to win for the first time on the road this season. 
"I think we're getting better every week," said Leinart, who was 15-for-24 for 186 yards and one touchdown. 
James' 50th career 100-yard rushing game came against the NFL's worst run defense. Shipp's touchdowns were his first since 2002, when he was Arizona's feature back. 
James, who had 94 yards in the first meeting against the Rams in the third week of the season, didn't mind his team­mates finishing off drives. 
"I had an opportunity to go in, and I said, 'No, let Shipp go in,"' James said, "because they've been so supportive of me in practice and every­thing." 
New England 28, Detroit 21 
The Patriots know how to finish games. The Lions just finish themselves off. 
Corey Dillon scored two of his three touchdowns in the last 8:35, Detroit turned the ball over on its last three pos­sessions and New England avoided a stunning upset with a victory. 
Dillon gave the Patriots their first lead of the second half with his 4-yard scoring run with 2:33 left, backing up Tom Brady's belief that the Patriots nearly always have a chance to win. 
"Any time there's time left on the clock, we think we can," he said. "For so much of that game we didn't play with much energy or enthusiasm." 
That's not shocking, consid­ering Detroit has the NFL's worst' record over the last six years (23-69) and is 2-10 this season. It's a surprise, though, considering the Patriots (9-3) talked all week about not tak­ing any opponent for granted. 

"Embarrassing, frustrating, but a win is a win," fullback Heath Evans said. 
The Lions took an 18-13 lead after Evans was tackled in the end zone for a safety when he fell on Brady's fum­ble. Jason Hanson's 26-yard field goal, his fourth of the game, made it 21-13 less than 2 minutes into the fourth quarter. 
The Patriots needed a touch­down and a 2-point conver­sion just to tie. Could they actually lose to a team that started the day with nine loss­es one week after the Patriots beat a team with nine wins in a 17-13 victory over Chicago on the same field? 
Well, Detroit did squander a 10-0 lead in a 27-10 loss to Miami in its previous game. 
Dallas 23 New York Giants 20 
Bill Parcells has never been crazy about kickers. 
Martin Gramatica may have changed the Dallas coach's opinion. 
Gramatica, signed last Monday after Parcells cut the enigmatic Mike Vanderjagt, kicked a 46-yard field goal with a second left to give the Dallas Cowboys a win over the New York Giants and a two­game lead in the NFC East. 
"I've got to thank the Cowboys for giving me a sec­ond chance," said Gramatica, once a top kicker who had just one field goal in three-games since 2004. 
"It's been a rough couple of years for me," the journeyman said, "being out all last year and then not making any teams this year." 
The winning score was set up by a 42-yard pass by Tony Romo to Jason Witten and came just over a minute after the Giants, wearing their red jerseys for the first and only time this season, had tied the game at 20-all on a 5-yard TO pass from Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress. 
Gramatica, who also kicked field goals of 41 and 35 yards, was signed last week after the Cowboys cut Vanderjagt, who had received a three-year $5.3 million contract in the offseason. 
But being the new guy didn't keep Gramatica from bursting into one of his over-the-top celebrations: The diminutive kicker leaped into the arms of his teammates, while coach Bill Parcells broke into a wide smile on the sidelines as the ball sailed through. 
"Gramatica made me look good," Parcells said with a smile. "For a first game back in the league, you can't get more pressure than that for the division lead." 
It didn't look so good for Parcells on Gramatica's first kick, a 44-yard attempt on the Cowboys' opening drive.

Swimmers, divers perform under pressure 
Both teams take third place-men at OSU, women at U.S. Open 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

Competing alongside some of the top college teams in the country as well as sever­al Olympic athletes, No. 20 Notre Dame finished in third place this weekend at the 
U.S. Open 

Held at the Boilermaker .Aquatic Center in West 
Lafayette, Ind., the Irish tal­lied 89 points to finish behind Open champion Auburn (427 points) and Florida (266). 
Notre Dame was led by senior Katie Carroll who fin­ished ninth in the 200 freestyle with (2:03.75) and 17th in the 200 butterfly (2:12.73). Carroll was also part of the Irish 400 medley relay team that included sen­ior Julia Quinn, sophomore Christa Riggins and junior Caroline Johnson, which fin­ished fourth at 4:20.33. 
Freshman Stacey Nerud 
turned in her best perform­ance of the season, finishing second in the 200 individual medley. Nerud's second place effort was the highest finish for any Irish swimmer over the weekend. 
While the majority of the team competed in West Lafayette, the Notre Dame divers competed in Columbus at The Ohio State Invitational. 
The Irish had three divers place within the top-20 in one-meter diving. Natalie Stitt (11th), Lucy llirt (15th) and Tiffany Robak (16th) all turned in solid performances for Notre Dame. 

The Irish men also traveled to Ohio State this weekend, coming home with a third­place finish out of 11 teams. Notre Dame accumulated 601 points over the three days, finishing behind only No. 7 Minnesota, who won with 1193 points, and host Ohio State (749.5). 
Freshman MacKenzie LeBlanc posted the highlight performance for the Irish as he won the 200 butterfly in a pool-record time of 1:48.36. Sophomore Daniel Rave also turned in a strong perform­ance in the 200 breaststroke as he took fourth place with a time of 2:02.97. 
Notre Dame posted seven top-five finishes in all, including junior Jay Vanden Berg, senior Louis Cavadini, sophomore Sam Pendergast and senior Alan Carter. 
Neither men's coach Tim Welsh nor women's coach Carrie Nixon could be r~ached for comment Sunday evening.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Huskies cruise to victory over Texas Southern 
Price puts up 20 in Connecticut's victory; FSU upsets Florida 
Associated Press STORRS, Conn. The Connecticut Huskies are making the most of an extended stay at home to start the season. 
A.J. Price scored 20 points, Hasheem Thabeet tied a Connecticut record with 10 blocked shots and the 20th­ranked Huskies blew out Texas Southern 106-55 to win their 26th straight home game. 
The Huskies open the season with 11 games in either Storrs or Hartford, none against a Big East or Top 25 team. 
"We as a coaching staff have got to keep them, hopefully, in reality," coach Jim Calhoun said. "Today you didn't beat Carolina or Pittsburgh or Rutgers or any­one else. You beat Texas Southern, who we are fortunate enough to have better players than, on our home court, and we did a good job defensively." 
Thabeet, the Huskies' 7 -foot-3 center, tied the blocks record held by Donyell Marshall and Emeka Okafor. He also had seven points and four rebounds. 
"I can see everyday, I play bet­ter defense," said Thabeet, a freshman from Tanzania, who has been playing organized bas­ketball for just three years. "I belong here is what I am think­ing, playing defense, playing hard." 
Four other Huskies scored in double figures. Jerome Dyson had 19 points, Doug Wiggins had 17 and Marcus Johnson and Jeff Adrien each had 11. Adrien added nine rebounds for UConn. Price also had seven assists. 
"He knows when to feed guys and when not to," Calhoun said of Price, a sophomore point guard. "I just thought he looked like he had some spring and he played with a lot of energy." 
Leonta Matthews had 10 points to lead Texas Southern (2­
6). 
UCLA 61, UC Riverside 38 

Tearing up and down the court is UCLA's favorite way to play. So when the Bruins encounter an opponent that slows things down, frustration sets in and their fans nearly go to sleep. 
· Arron Affialo scored 13 points to help the top-ranked Bruins beat UC Riverside Sunday, giving them a 6-0 record for the first time since they won the 1995 national championship. 
"We got a lot of aggressive guys on this team that want to get up and down," Affialo said. "It's pretty difficult (to play slow)." 
Luc-Richard Mbah a Moute had 12 points and 12 rebounds in the Bruins' second blowout victory that ended their first week as the nation's top-ranked team in 11 years. They beat Long Beach State by 30 points last Tuesday night. Josh Shipp and Lorenzo Mata added 10 points each. 
"We're a fast-breaking team," point guard Darren Collison said. "It's real diflicult for us, but we did a good job in the second half standing our ground. We're the No. 1 team and everyone is trying to beat us, and they're going to do what it takes." 
Henrik Thomsen scored eight points for the Highlanders (3-5), who played a top-ranked team for the second time ever. In 1988, UCR stunned No. 1 Iowa 110-92 in the Chaminade Christmas Classic. 
The Highlanders controlled a slow tempo in the first half and were down by 10 at the break. 
"Early we were a little anx­ious," UCLA coach Ben Howland said. "We missed some open shots from 3-point range. That was a tough game because they were very patient on offense." 
UCR was limited to four points over the final 7 1/2 minutes on baskets by Justin Bell and Michael Creppy. The Highlanders shot 30 percent for the game and committed 12 turnovers -under their 20.2 average. 
"Some of those guys haven't been getting a lot of playing time," UCR interim coach Vonn Webb said. "We got some stops, but then we turned it over, gave up some easy baskets and these kind of things break you down." 
The Bruins were messy, too, with 13 turnovers, but they shot 68 percent from the floor in the second half and got to the free throw line nine more times than UCR. 
Florida State 70, Aorida 66 
AI Thornton is so important to Florida State that Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton almost feels guilty about it. 
Still, Hamilton isn't shy about going to his team's biggest strength. 
Thornton scored 28 points, including two free throws with 4 seconds left, and Florida State upset No. 4 Florida. 
"It's a shame he has to go out and get 28 points every night for us to win," Hamilton said. "Tonight we had to go withAl." 
Thornton scored 18 in the sec­ond half, missing just once from the fioor. He finished 1 0-for-16 for the game and also had nine rebounds. 
"There's no doubt he was ready to play tonight," Hamilton said. 
The Seminoles (5-2), who had lost their previous two games by a total of 37 points, led 36-31 at the half and built the lead to 55­41 before Walter Hodge's 3­pointer with 3:02 left got the Gators to 62-59. Hodge's shot capped an 18-7 Florida run. 
Hodge hit another from long range to cut it to 68-66 with 53.2 seconds left, but Florida State's Toney Douglas blocked a 3-point attempt by Taurean Green with 4 seconds left and Thornton was fouled as he picked up the loose ball. 
Pittsburgh 74, Auburn 66 
The missed free throws down the stretch bothered Jamie Dixon far more than the final score. 
No. 2 Pittsburgh had most of a late 14-point lead wiped out and missed six straight free throws over the final 1:31, but still beat Auburn in the Panthers' first road game. 
"Not a lot of teams have a good road win like that and are 8-0 at this point," the Pitt coach said. "We won by eight on the some more free throws that might have changed some things against a very good team." 

Aaron Gray scored 16 points and grabbed 12 rebounds despite playing with a painful blister on his left foot and spend­-ing most of the second half in foul trouble. 

Gray grabbed a rebound after one of the missed foul shots and laid it in, then blocked an Auburn shot. 
"I was just trying to give my team a little bit of energy," said Gray, who developed the blister late in Pitt's last game against Robert Morris.

In another close game, the Belles came up short Saturday night, losing to Washington University 66-62 at home. 
The win improved the Bears record to 3-3 while the Belles dropped to 1-5, extending their losing streak to three.

Badgers overcome Notre Dame again 
Wisconsin knocks the Irish out of NCAA Tournament for third consecutive season 
HY PHAM/The Observer Irish middle blocker Tara Enzweiler attempts to spike the ball in a 3-0 win over West Virginia Nov. 12. 
By DEVIN PRESTON 
Sports Writer 

Wisconsin had knocked the Irish out of the NCAA Tournament two consecutive times. 
This weekend, the Badgers made it three, beating the Irish 34-36, 26-30, 21-30 at UW Fieldhouse in Madison, Wise. Although the Irish strung together some impressive plays, they were not able to keep their season alive against the superi­or Badgers. 
Before the game, Irish captain Adrianna Stasuik said that the history between the Irish and the Badgers gave the Irish an "edge" of motivation. But that edge didn't overcome the talent of 1Oth-seeded Wisconsin. 
Notre Dame's offense was led by Stasiuk who tallied 12 kills. Wisconsin freshman Brittney Dolgner dominated with 21 kills at a hitting percentage of .545. The Badgers outhit the Irish .324 to .204. 
A well-balanced offense was key for Wisconsin. The three Badgers with the highest kill counts all had hitting percent­ages above .294 -higher than Notre Dame's team leader Kim Kristoff. 
Senior libero Danielle Herndon led all players with 17 digs, playing a big role in keep­ing her team's hope of an upset alive. 
"They're all aggressive, and they're scrappy, and their defense was great, especially in the first game they were out­digging us by five or six," said WISconsin coach Pete Waite. 
The scrappy play from Notre Dame forced Wisconsin to seven game points before they were fmally able to put the Irish away. 

"We played really well," said setter Jamel Nicholas. "We exe­cuted our game plan and fought for every point." 
Although Notre Dame was able to tie the score with Wisconsin late in the game, needing only two points to take the game, it was unable to win the battle for momentum and fell behind Wisconsin later in the match. 
"It would have helped to win," Nicholas said, "but it didn't set us back at all. We came out playing just as hard in the sec­ond game." 
Wisconsin opened the second game in dominant fashion with a 6-2 run. The Irish were able to go on a 7-2 run out of a time­out and take their first lead at 9­
8. The team did not allow the Badgers to gain more than a two-point lead until late, when a service error from Kristoff pre­ceeded Wisconsin's 8-2 run to put the Badgers ahead 28-22. After a timeout, WISconsin was able to win its second game of the night off a kill from junior Audra Jeffers. 
Notre Dame lost stride early in the third game with Wisconsin leading from its fourth point until the end of the match. The Irish made an attempt to regain control of the match with a kill from Mallorie Croal kicking off five consecutive points to nar­row the Wisconsin lead to 15­13. 
But the Irish were unable to overcome the Badgers, falling 21-30 after another Jeffers kill sealed the match.

The two teams combined for only.16 penalties in two games despite a first contest dominat­ed by big checks and numerous serums in front of the nets.

"They throw pucks from everywhere,". MacMillan said. "They get pucks on net and crash the net. We seem to think that you have to create a Van Gogh to score a goal -you have to create a masterpiece. I don't understand our mentality that way." 
Irish left wing Evan Rankin, making his first appearance in several weeks, knocked starting goalie Johnson out of the game for a portion of the second peri­od with a wraparound goal 2:30 into the period for the 2-1 Irish lead. Junior Wylie Rogers, who had not played since a Nov. 24 tie with Lake Superior State, took over between the pipes, but surrendered three goals on seven shots to the Irish before Johnson was put back in the game. 
"I'm sure it was difficult,"

The goal, Notre Dame's fourth shorthanded tally of the season, gave the team a much needed spark as it pounded in two more in the next two minutes. 
Thirty seconds later defense­man Brett Blatchford secured his first collegiate goal when he put a wrist shot past Johnson's blocker side. Center Garret Regan picked up this assist, his third of the year. 
The final goal came when Van Guilder took control of the puck in the Nanooks zone. The junior right wing skated towards the middle and got off a shot as he was being tripped up. The goal ended Van Guilder's four game scoring drought, which went back to a 4-0 win over Bowling Green Nov. 11. 
"It takes a lot of pressure off, it was pretty nice to get one tonight and hopefully we can keep it going," Van Guilder said. 
Despite outshooting the Nanooks 34-22, the Irish trailed for most of the game as Alaska picked up an early goal 10 min­utes into the contest. Sophomore Ryan Muspratt ripped a shot that bounced off Brown's face mask and rang the inside of the crossbar. Referee Matt Shegos initially waved the goal off but when Notre Dame scooped the puck up and scored on the ensuing odd-man rush, the call was reviewed and reversed. 
"On the bench we all thought [the Alaska shot] had gone in," Jackson said. "That's why we have instant replay." 
Alaska held on to the lead for two periods before the Irish offense exploded in the third. Notre Dame was able to come from behind by physically wear­ing down the Nanooks and beating them to the loose pucks late in the game. ''I'm sick of watching guys stand around and fish for pucks," MacMillan said. "Too many guys want to stand there like they're holding a hoe -get a shovel." 
In the second game of the series, Notre Dame neutralized Alaska's offense -outshooting the Nanooks 33 to 19 -and stymied its defense and goal­tending version of musical chairs with speed and scoring Notre Dame lead 
to 3-1 at 4:27 

when he beat Rogers high glove side on his first shot faced. He received the pass from Lawson in the corner while he curled toward the net along the top of the right face off circle, getting the shot off wide open from inside the slot. 
Lawson added the first goal of his career at 8:15 and the fourth of the game with a slap shot from the right point that deflected off a Nanooks player and into the net just below the crossbar. Van Guilder slapped in his second of the game for the 5-llrish lead at 9:13. 
"It was kind of getting to me," Lawson said. "It's tough to get that first one, but hopefully a couple more will come." 
The Nanooks and Irish exchanged goals nine seconds apart in the 16th minute of the second period for the 6-2 final. On the power play, Alaska's Brandon Knelsen got the first goal of his career before center Jason Paige answered for the Irish with his sixth on the sea­son. 
The two teams exchanged first period goals in a slow start reminiscent of the first two periods of play Saturday. 
"We were sluggish out of the gate," Jackson said. "It was just a matter of getting back to play­ing the way we are capable of playing" 
The Irish capitalized on a turnover for the lead at 12:13 on their own blue line when Nanooks right wing Adam Naglich coughed up the puck to Mark Van Guilder, creating a three-on-two. Van Guilder drove up the left side of the ice and fired a low wrist shot at Johnson's five-hole that was saved. Van Guilder, however, shoveled in the puck seconds later from the front of the crease with an assist from Noah Babin and Garrett Regan. 
Alaska tied the game at 14:50 when the puck deflected off an Irish defender and bounced onto the stick of Nanooks left wing Kyle Greentree in the right slot. Brown was still caught on the left side of the net and Greentree slid the puck into the open low right side.

wanted for mo'st of the shot clock, until Charel Allen got the ball on the right wing. 
"I had a wide open look and it just didn't fall," Allen said. 
Although Allen missed the potentially game-tying shot, she did have one of the few bright days shooting for the Irish, posting 17 points and 9 rebounds to match a career high. Melissa D'Amico was the only other Irish player in dou­ble figures. The junior center recorded the second double­double of her college career with 15 points and 10 boards. 
In the first half, things looked grim for the Irish. They shot only 22.6 percent from the floor, including a dismal eight percent from beyond the arc. 
"We're not a very good shooting team -1-for-14 from the 3-point line," McGraw said. 
This poor shooting effort was coupled with tough defense against the Hoosiers. Notre Dame held Indiana to just 33.3 percent shooting while out­rebounding the Hoosiers in the first half 28-15. But Notre Dame's poor scoring perform­ance was enough to give Indiana a 27-22 halftime lead. 
"We played pretty well ­that's the fewest points we've given up all-year," McGraw said. "We just need to find somebody that can make a shot right now." 
For McGraw, the main half­time adjustment had to be Notre Dame's shooting game. 
"We talked at halftime about just stepping in and just shoot­ing 15-footers," McGraw said. "We can't make shots right now so it's going to be hard for us to win." 
This change worked effec­tively early in the second half, with the Irish going on a 7-0 run to start the second half. The game remained within two points or fewer for the first seven minutes of the half until another big Irish run -this time 10 straight Notre Dame points -gave the Irish their biggest lead of the night at 41­33. 
"We were getting closer in, I think that was when Charel was hitting some shots inside like 10 feet in, [D'Amico] hit some shots inside," McGraw said. "We were getting a high­er percentage shot at that point." 
But the Hoosiers responded quickly, going on their own 9-0 run over the next two minutes to bring the score close. During the Hoosier stretch, Smith took over the game, scoring six straight points of her own -four from the char­ity stripe, two from the floor ­to will Indiana back to a 42-41 lead. 
The game would remain tight until the end, when unforced Irish errors handed the game over to the Hoosiers. 
Notre Dame 61, Michigan 58 
With four seconds to play, Irish guard Tulyah Gaines sank two free throws to give the Irish a 59-58 lead against the Wolverines en route to an Irish win. 
"Tulyah's [free throws] were really, really big because that's how we won the game," McGraw said. "We don't win the game if she doesn't hit one of those free throws." 
After a turnover by Wolverine guard Janelle Cooper and a foul by forward Melinda Queen, Allen sank two more free throws to ice the lead. 
Despite winning by three points, the Irish were down by four with 22 seconds to play, but a 3-pointer by Allen brought the Irish to within one. 
Allen was one of three Irish players in double figures with 15 points, alongside Gaines 
(11) and freshman guard Ashley Barlow (14). 
Even though those three led the Irish in scoring, McGraw credited her entire team with the win. 
"The great thing was that everybody contributed," she said. "Everybody did some­thing. It was a real team effort." 
This teamwork was clear down the stretch. Freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner was able to find Barlow for a 3­pointer. 
Allen nailed threes and swiped errant passes to give the Irish the ball back. Freshman center Erica Williamson notched a steal and set the screen for Allen's three near the end. And with five seconds remaining, forward Crystal Erwin grabbed a board, giving Gaines a chance to make the game-winning free throws. 
Despite the win, McGraw was still disappointed in her team's rebounding. Michigan out-rebounded the Irish 45-32. 
"We just refused to box out, and it's really disappointing," McGraw said. 
The win was the second big comeback for the Irish in the young season, the first being an 85-81 overtime victory against Bowling Green Nov. 13. 
"Things haven't been easy for us and they know every game is going to be a dog­fight," McGraw said. "They really have a lot of inner drive and I think a lot of that comes from Tulyah. I think that she is a great leader for us. She's always encouraging the team."

Notre Dame upends No. 23 Maryland in BB&T Classic 81-74 
By BOB GRIFFIN Spons Writer 

Notre Dame guard Kyle McAlarney scored a career-high 18 points on 6-of-11 shooting and the Irish defeated No. 23 Maryland 81-74 in the BB&T Classic at the Verizon Center in Washington D.C. Sunday -their first game against a ranked opponent all season. 
It was Notre Dame's second consecutive victory against Maryland, the last coming in the first round of the BB&T Classic in 2002 when the Irish knocked off the defending champions 79­67.

That might also be a good way to describe Notre Dame's feeling toward winning a bowl game -a feat the program hasn't accomplished since the 1994 Cotton Bowl against Texas A&M. Since then, Notre Dame has played in eight bowl games,

ND shows no patience for N anooks

SportS Writers 

No. 5 Notre Dame got a polar-bear sized load off its back and swept No. 14 Alaska in a two-game series at the Joyce Center this weekend ­the same Nanooks team that beat the Irish in three straight meetings to close out last sea­son, including two losses to knock them from the CCHA playoffs. 
The Irish (12-3-1, 7-2-1 CCHA) defeated the Nanooks (6-4-4, 4-3-3 CCHA) 3-1 and 6­2 to move out of a tie for third place with Alaska in the league standings and three points behind league-leading No.4 Miami. 
"A whole lot faster, a whole lot bigger, a whole lot stronger, a whole lot better coached, a whole lot better goaltending ­a whole lot of everything," Alaska coach Tavis MacMillan said of Notre Dame's play in comparison to the Nanooks on the weekend. 
The Irish were led by junior right wing Mark Van Guilder, who regained the scoring touch he had lost the previous two weekends and beat Nanooks goaltender Chad Johnson three times in two games, and left wing Ryan Thang (two goals) and

Tealll goes 1-1 against Big 10 foes 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame split two games against Big Ten teams this weekend, beating Michigan on the road 61-58 Friday before falling to Indiana 54-51 Sunday. 
The games were both close to the finish, marked by tough defense and strong play down the stretch. Unfortunately for Notre Dame, it was only able to pull out one win. 
"I thought that was a really disappointing loss [to Indiana] especially in light of how we came out and played our last game [at Michigan l." Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I thought we had the game in hand and just really beat our­selves." 
Indiana 54, Notre Dame 51 
With only six seconds in the game, Irish guard Charel Allen lost her dribble with the Irish down three, leading to a steal from Hoosiers forward Whitney Thomas to cement Indiana's 54-51 win. 
After the steal, the Irish fouled Hoosier guard Kim Roberson. Roberson missed the free throw attempt, but the Irish could not get a last-sec­ond shot off, ending the game. 
Going into the final seconds, Notre Dame and Indiana had traded leads throughout the second half, but a turnover by Allen gave the Hoosiers the ball back, letting Indiana guard Nikki Smith nail a jump­shot to push the Hoosier lead to three. 
On the possession following the Smith jumper, the Irish could not find the look they
