records 

te1nporarily closed 
by Pat Hanifin Staff Reporter 

A recent federal law which would have opened all of a student's personal records to his inspection was amended last December to apply only to records gathered by universities after Jan. 1, 1975. Th~ date when cl?sed records will be opened hasnowbeen delayed until after _the middle of March, Dr. Philip Faccenda, university counsel said yesterday. 
The limitation of the law to records gathered from 1975 on and the 
delay we~e _d_ue to complaints from universities across the nation that ~he Initial _law would have destroyed the confidentiality prom1~ed to wnters of letters of recommendation as well as releasmg other confidential material such as parents' financial stat~ments. "~he sit~?tion this law puts the University in is in­~redibly _comphc~ted, Faccenda said. "We have forty people mvovled m this t~mg at Notre Dame as well as the Department of Healt~ . Education and Welfare and various educational ass?c1ations around the country but we still are unsure about such basics as what a 'record' is in the first place." 
H.E.W. has issued a hundred pages of guidelines on the original measure and its amendment, both of which were introduced by Sen. James Buckley, Cons.-N.Y. 
~niversities and other concerned organizations and persons have until Mar. 7 to suggest changes in the guidelines which will then be issued in final form after public hearings. According to Faccenda universities will then have "a reasonable amount of time to im­plement the new rules before they are required to open their reco!'ds." 
Faccenda stated that he expected the University would use most of the semester for working out the details. 
The initial measure contained a provision requiring schools to allow students to see a recrod within 45 days after it was requested and the final_guidelines will probably contain a similar provision. Facc~nda_ pomted out that so":Ie material might be preserved only on microfilm and that some might take time to track down. 
''We still do not know what records are or are not confidential at 
this University," he said. "There are quite a few offices in­
volved-all the ones that have dealings with individual students­
and there has never been any careful accounting made as to who 
has what where." 
An?~her matter under consideration is the question of asking or 
reqmrmg students to waive confidentiality in some cases. The law 
prohibits colleges from demanding waivers ·in connection with 
services which are necessary or required by the college. However 
the University is considering requesting waivers for such things as 
letters of recommendations. 
"Students applying here or applying to graduate schools with 
record~ from here would not have to waive confidentiality but if 
they d1d not we would have to notify the people recommending 
them on that fact so as to be fair to those writing the letters " 
Faccenda explained. ' 
H~ not~d that the Univ~rsity could not officially weight non­
confidential recommendatiOns Jess than confidential ones but 
suggested that students who retained their right to examine the 
letters would risk getting "simply bland restatements of their 
academic record that would not help the admissions committee 
decide anything." 
There has been no change in the University's records policy so 
far Faccenda said. "All records which an office would have 
released to a student before this Jaw was adopted will still be 
released. We did not remove or destroy any records after the Nov. 
19th effective date of the original law as some colleges did." 
Faccenda believed that after the analysis of present records is 
complete there will be very few which will be classed as con­
fidentia_I. "I~ is to our advant~ge to limit that class since every set 
of confidential records requires us to set up a duplicate filing 
system fo~ tho~e g~thered after Jan. l-and that costs money." 
The legislahon IS an "over-reaction" Faccenda believes, to a 
general fear that s~cret records in secret computers are beginning 
to control peoples hves. "Some people are beginning to get a little 
paranoid about this." 
However he does believe that the "basic point" of the law is good. 
"We all want to be fair and accurate in our dealings with students 
and clear up any errors that have been made." 
In the interests of this accuracy the law provides that any student 
wh_o f~els there is an error in his record may ask for a hearing to 
adJUdicate the matter. The nature of the hearing required under 
law has not yet been set down by H.E.W. 
"I do not think there would be any difficulty when the question is 
one of simple fact, such as what grade a professor actually gave a 
stude!lt," said Faccenda. "But when you get into subjective 
questwns about the accuracy of faculty or administrative opinions 
on a student then you can get on a never-ending road." 
He also said that it is possible that the new law would allow student to challenge a disciplinary action by attacking the validity of the record of that action. 
"But you have to keep in mind that the only permanent record the 
Dean of Students keeps after a student's graduation would be 
destroyed." 
.~he act wou~d allow destruction of records, Faccenda noted, 
c1tm_g a quotation from the Congressional Digest in which a sup­
portmg senator suggested that the law would best be served by 
keeping a minimum number of records. 
In addi~ion to ~~eing his file a student may also make copies of 
them. This proviSIOn was added in the recent amendment 
P~rents Confidential Statements of financial status ar~ an ex­ception to the post-January 1 release. Under the amendment these continue to be confidential. Further, parents as well as students have access to school records and parents of elementary and secondary school pupils may examine and challenge records on their children. 



Selection of St. Mary's president given to Board 
by Mary Janca St. Mary's Editor 

The selection of the next president of St. Mary's College now rests with the Corporate Board of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 
According to Acting College President Dr. William Hickey, "each member of the Board of Regents was asked to submit his or her own recommendations concerning the candidates in­terviewed by the Board to the Chairman of the Corporate Board, Sr. Kathleen Anne Nelligan, C.S.C. "The request came at the December 14 board of Regents meeting. 
A total of five candidates were interviewed by the Regents last semester. They include Dr. Paul J. Reiss, vice-president for academic affairs at For­dham University and Dr. Francis J. Mertz executive vice-president of St. Peter's College, N~w Jersey, who were presented to the Regents at their Sep­tember 20-21st meeting, and Dr. Boyd Litzinger, dean of the school of arts and sciences at St. Bonaventure University, Dr. Robert Giroux, president of Clarke Colle_ge, Dubuque, Iowa, and Dr. John Duggan, vice­president for student affiars at VassVassar College. 
Although no timetable has been set for the Cor­porate Board's selection and appointment of a new president, Hickey stated that, "as a result of the kind of discussion which occurred at the last Board of Regents meeting, there is no doubt in my mind that a presidential appointment is to be made effective at the start of the next academic year." 
Because the recommendations have been made to the Corporate Board, the Presidential Search Committee, which was responsible for initial screening and of presidential hopefuls, "is in a transition period," stated Sr. Francesca Kennedy, member of the committee and acting vice-president for academic affairs. At the present, she said "nothing is happeningg." ' 
"As far as we (search committee members) are concerned, the committee will disband and cease to function," said Student Representative to the Search 
Committee Tess Lehman. 
"The purposd of the committee has been served: to do research, to come up with the best possible can­didates and to present them to the Board of Regents " she continued. ' 
Hickey noted, however, that the status of the search committee lies with the Corporate Board. 
"The ball now rests with the Corporate Board. Were they to conclude that there is no substantial candidate, it is certainly within their rights to recommend to the Board of Regents that the search be continued, and they, in turn, would have to notify the Search Committee to submit more names of candidates to them, stated the Acting President. 
The Search Committee has on record more prospective candidates than the five submitted to the Board of Regents, he continued. 
According to Lehman, the committee received "over 250 applications" for the post. When asked why a woman was not among those candidates presented to the Board of Regents, and 
now to the Corporate Board, Sr. Francesca com­mented, "We would have liked to have found a woman candidate. We interviewed several women and were thinking of presenting one to the Board of Regents, but she withdrew her name." 
Responding to the rumor that St. Marv's would not consider selecting a president from within the college, Hickey stated, "The Search Committee was open-minded. It was established by the Board of Regents and c~arged with presenting to the Board (of Regents) candidates for the president of St. Mary's college. Once the committee was formed it (the Search Committee) advertised in the instit~tion and across the country. 
"All recommencations and names that were su~mitted .wer.e followed up by the Search Com­mittee, which mcluded names from inside and out­side this institution. Any qualified individual was free to submit his or her name." 
Gen~ral ~ualific~itons for an individual to apply as a presidential candidate required that he have earned a .Ph.J?, held an administrative position at a umvers1ty or college at some time during his academic career, and that he have some college teaching experience, stated Kennedy. 
The search for a new president began shortly after the announced March 8 resignation of Dr. Edward L. Henry, the first lay president in the history of the College. Members of the administration faculty
' ' 

students, and Board of Regents were appointed by the Regents to research and submit potential can­didates to the Board. 
Among present members of the Search Committee are Tess Lehman, student representative, Sr. Francesca Kennedy, C.S.C., administration faculty representatives Dr. Eugene Campanale ~nd Sr. Elena Malits, C.S.C., and Regents Dr. Glenn Olsen Mary Rita Hellmuth, Mrs. Kay Botyle, and Sr. M: Leonella Moe, C.S.C. 
According to Hickey, Search Committee respon­sibilities were many. 
"They had to sort and research an enormous number of applications, conduct interviews all over the c.ountry, select the top candidates, invite these candtdates to the institution and present them to the Board of Regents," he explained. 
Eac~ individual member of the Board of Regents, followmg the December meeting, was to submit his recommendations to the Corporate Board Chairman. Mem~ers could recommend as many or as few candidates as they wished, he noted. Thus, all five candidates interviewed by the Regents will also be considered by the Corporate Board. 
"The major responsibility of the Corporate Board " !loted Hickey, "is to evaluate our recommendatio~s m terms of the needs of the college the interests of all the constituents of the college, a~d the future of St. Mary's." 
Prior to selection or rejection of a candidate the Corporate Board must interview each, and bas~d on the results of the interview, recommendations of the Regents, and the detailed information supplied to it fr?m the Search Committee, make its decision, said Hickey.

DETROIT (UPI> -General Motors Corp. joined the price wars to attract reluctant customers into auto showrooms Monday by an­nouncing it will pay $200 to $500 rebates to buyers of compact and subcompact cars. 
GM, the giant of the industry, was the last member of the automotive Big Three to take the step. 
It said its rebate program, which will run through Feb. 28, w~s retroactive to Jan. 13-the same day Chrysler Corp. launched Its own "car clearance carnival." Ford Motor Co. joined the rebate game last Thursday, without a catchy name but with a simpler plan. 
BRUSSELS <UPI>-The U.S. dollar, in the fourth week of one of its worst Slumps, dropped to a 14-mo~th low _in Paris Monday and closed in zurich only a fraction above Its all time low of two weeks

Gold price rose, not spectacularly, after an early fall .. Th~ meta 
closed in Zurich at $172 an ounce, up 75 cents from Fridays rate, 
after dropping to $173.50 at the opening. In London, gold also 
closed at $175, after opening at $171. . 

Zurich dealers said there was some heavy sellmg of dollars 
during the day with little or no good news from the United Sta.tes to 
help prop it up. The Zurich market in ~r~cular leans heavily on 
U.S. trade figures and any expected deficits affect the dollar ad­versely.

Ford still prefers higher gas prices to rationing 
By RICHARD H. GROWALD 
WASHINGTON <UPI) President Ford remains con­vinced higher prices and not rationing is the way to hold down gasoline consumption, the White House said Monday. 
Asked by reporters if Ford was taking another look at gas rationing, press secretary Ron 

, Nessen replied: "Certainly not." Asked about public opinion poll reports saying the public preferred rationing to higher prices, Nessen said the Presi­dent is aware of what people are saying. "And the more his plan is looked at and compared with rationing, the more firmly he believes his is the right way." Under the President's anti­recession economic-energy pro­gram, fuel production and import taxes will cause gaso­line to rise about 10 cents a gallon, the White House has said. Nessen said the question should be not whether one prefers rationing or higher prices, but "which would you rather have -eight or nine gallons of gas a week max­imum or as much as you want at 10 He said rationing also would curtail long automobile vaca­tions, be "especially deva­stating" to the motel and hotel business and add more woe to the auto industry. "The President is not by any means convinced that a majori­ty of the public is opposed to his program," Nessen said. The press secretary said the Presient's anti-recession pro­gram is complex and needs to be explained to the public. He said Ford will have a news conference Tuesday and will make an economic speech to 800-900 businessmen and econo­mists Wednesday night at the Washington meeting of the Conference Board. 
1
Nessen said Ford would travel across the nation to make speeches explaining his program and the trips probably would start next month. 
In other White House develop­ments: -Nessen said Ford soon will "n· '.lUnce a boost in food aid to 

hungry countries. He indicated 
U.S. food aid would be boosted from under a billion dollars to about $1.5 billion but that Ford will do nothing to upset domestic grain prices. 
-Nessen said Ford is plan­ning to take various steps this week implementing parts of his anti-recession program, such as raising fees on imported crude oil. 
-Ford named former First Lady Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson and 24 other persons to be members of the American Revolution Bicentennial Adviso­ry Council. 
-Nessen discounted press reports that Treasury Secretary William E. Simon was about to leave office because of opposi­tion to the deficit spending proposed in Ford's anti-reces­sion program. Nessen said that if Simon was appalled by the billions in deficit spending, then it was equally true that "the President was shocked" by the size of it.

Goodell also said the board had written a memorandum to President Ford requesting an extension of up to six months in the clemency aspect of Ford's earned re-entry program. The program, announced by Ford last Sept. 16, is due to expire Jan. 31. 
The Clemency Board, which deals only with those already convicted and punished for civilian draft resistance or absence-related offenses within the military during the Vietnam era, has a potential clientele of 120,000. 
Goodell told a news confer­ence that his board had "experienced a tremendous upsurge in applications" since the start of its radio-television campaign Jan. 6. 
"In the last 10 days alone, applications have doubled," he said. "The total of formal applications we have logged in as of last Friday is 1,600 and we are approaching the 2,000 mark." 
A Roman Catholic leader, meanwhile, called the re-entry program "a failure ... because it is not and never was intended to be a true amnesty" and asked Congress to pass legisla­tion providing universal and unconditional amnesty. 
Father Joseph A. Francis, president of the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, said a universal and unconditional amnesty "should be passed as soon as possible during the 94th

ND department budgets face more cutbacks 
by Joan Luttmer 
Staff Reporter 

Some academic departments at Notre Dame have already over­spent their budgets for this year and are facing a very tight second semester. 
Fr. Michael Murphy, chairman of the Earth Sciences department affirmed that 97.2 per cent of their yearly budget has been spent on the first semester. He named skyrocketing maintenance and repair costs as the chief overrun. Mimeograph costs have taken a big chunk also, constituting an expense of two-thirds of the budget. To manage the second semester he plans to exert careful control over faculty traveling expenses. Fr. Murphy says that Notre Dame's faculty traveling allowances are sufficient to attend the major conferences, but this could be an area soon cut. 
Fees will be charged in some classes to defray the costs in­curred. It is a charge intended to pay for the student hand-outs that the budget formerly covered but now cannot. In the handout cases, the students many times aren't required to buy a text-these handouts serve as their text. Another belt-tightening measure will be the discontinuation of some publication subscriptions that the Earth Science Department purchases jointly with the Library. 
In cases when the budgets prove to be insufficient, the Dean of Science can pay for some expenses from the Dean's budget. Even though grants from donors such as the National Science Foundation help, it has been very tight this semester. But according to Fr. Murphy things are always close in the Earth Science department. 
The math department, on the other hand, seems to have escaped almost unscathed from last semester's skyrocketing costs. Relieved of expenses in equipment upkeep and duplicating costs the department has avoided the areas most departments find troublesome. However, traveling expenses have been rising along with phone bills. These areas are being watched and to pay for their overruns money is being allocated from other miscellaneous funds in the Math budget. Perhaps the department is in such a good position due to the reception of more grants than expected. The National Science Foundation and 4 research grants allow continuation of most projects. Dr. Warren Wong, chairman of the Mathematics Department, said things are going along evenly and that the department will probably be in the black this June. 
Professor Edward Vasta of the 
English Department has already 
made moves to make up for the 
department having spent much 
more than half its budget in the 
first half of the fiscal year. For 
instance, the annual major 
speaking engagement sponsored 
by the English Department has 
already been cancelled. No money

Hancock, February 2oth, 1975, at 
8:00 p.m. in Stepan Center. Hancock's music can be termed "sophistifunk"; he is a main­stream jazz man who has added strong influences of African music and rock to his sound. Tickets will be $4.00 general admission. There will be only a few chairs set up so that people can 
bring blankets and whatever to add to their enjoyment. 

Festival appears imminent. The characteristic donation just cannot be funded like it has been in past years. Duplicating services were again cited as problems. Last summer the price of duplicating on the 3M machines doubled and the copying charges increased 20 per cent. Limits have been imposed on the amount a faculty member may copy. Chairman Vasta is con­cerned about traveling expenses and longdistance phomnone bills. But as Chairman Vasta puts it, "Butdgets are so tight they take up a lot of thought and energy, and this preoccupation with money isn't worth the time and effort." 
The American Studies Depart­ment, like the English Department must function on the money it receives from the Dean of Arts and Letters. Dr. Weber, chairman, says the American Studies Department is definitely tightening up. Special lecturers have been curtailed and the newsletter sent to student majors has been dropped completely. As in all departments, no pesonnel cuts have been made. Everyone is also cautioned to telephone and duplicating expenses. Budgets are getting tighter and here isn't money for office supplies and new subscriptions. The American 


Are there any pre-Mardi Gras activities scheduled to "whet" the students' gambling appetites? 
The knights of Columbus are sponsoring a "N.ght at the Races" with daily doubles and exactas, scheduled for Friday, January 24, from 8:00 to 10:00 in the council chambers. 
I am considering joining the Ombudsman Service this semester. Whom can I call for more information? 
The Personnel Director of the Ombudsman Service is Tom Gib­bons, who is presently accepting applicants for the Special Projects division of the Service. He can be reached by calling the Om­budsman Service at 7638. 
I want to add a class to my schedule. Just what is the procedure for it? 
To add a class you have to pick up a slip at the Registrar's Office in the Administration building. The slip requires the signatures fothe Dean or Departmental Advisor and the Chairman of the Depart­ment offering the course. Once these are obtained the slip must be returned to the Registrar's Office along with an IBM card you will receive. Students are reminded that Thursday, January 23, is the last day to add or drop classes. 
Will there be a "Quickie" bus running this semester? 
This Friday is the first scheduled running of the "Quickie" for the spring semester. The bus will arrive at the circle at 8:30, 9:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 12:30, 1:00, snf 1:30. However there may be a change; so watch for posters and announcements in the dining halls. 
When will Darby's Place open up for the spring semester? 
Darby's Place has already opened and is holding its regular hours of midnight to 4:30. Incidently, anyone who is interested in working in Darby's should contact Bob Bode at 8720. 
NOTR: The Ombudsman Service has resumed full operations! If you have any questions or problems just call weekdays 9:30-5:00 and Monday through Thursday evenings 10:00 to midnight 7638.

Studies Department has not overspent their entire budget but costs have been such that this coming semester will have to absorb an expensive first semester. 
The Engineering Department has been economizing for the last few years. Speakers were cur­tailed a few years ago. However this year they have been hard-hit in the area of government funds. Most of their research projects have been provided grants and contracts from the government and private industry. With the present economy these projects have been slowing down. The areas of duplicating and sub­scriptions has hurt them but not too drastically. · Associate Chairman Edward Jerger did say, however, that the Architecture­Engineering program in Rome has had difficulty. With an unstable government and fluctuating dollar they haven't been able to do all they anticipated, but the program has not been cut. 
Generally almost every department has felt the pinch. The new budget is soon to be announced and a new year of penny-pinching for the chairmen who compile the budgets is anticipated. So when receiving your . engineering newsletter third class postage instead of fi.rst class, remember that such ts life in a year of recession.

In the beginning of a new semester, it is best not to forget the events of the past one. Reviewing major areas of university concern, it becomes apparent that much was left undone at the end of the fall term. We present this per­<;pective as a means of setting forth some dh·ection durin~ the months ahead. 
Student Government: The Student Government leaders suffered from a lack of direction last semester. When the occasion called for immediate action, as in the basketball ticket issue, they went to work. But the Administration has again taken to the strategy of silent running, and the areas which Student Government needs to pursue have been fairly well disguised. 
The handling of voter registration and the fall general election indicated what could be done in the area of student politics. It is an area that will become increasingly important as Notre Dame participation in the Indiana Student Association grows. The food co-op, though, has proven nothing but promises. 
Student Government has to learn to throw its weight around in areas that the Administration finds uncomfortable to discuss, such as Housing and Co­Education. 
Although a well-oiled service organization, the Ombudsman service may have to expand its emphasis into more of a research organization. The best solution may be to leave the execution to Student Government, and the research to the Ombudsman service. 

Student Affairs: The main achievement last semester, from the outlook of Student Affairs people, was the 
establishment of the Alumni-Senior Club, despite the fact that it opened quite late in the semester and released its first manager after being in operation for only a short time. 
The center ring in Student Affairs this semester will most likely be occupied by the special student committees which originated at the Trustee's meeting last October. A major pitfall lies in the Student Affairs tradition of removing all the force and vitality from student projects beforP they have even bugun. 
Academic Affairs: The search for a 
replacement for Frederick Crosson, 
Dean of Arts and Letters, should porve

rumored merger between the College of 
Arts and Letters and the College of 
Sciences.

head in February, and everybou; in­vovled knows what that means. 
The findings of the North Central Accreditation Association still ring true. There is still a need for a sharing of in­formation at all levels: the faculty still feels frustrated in the realm of in­stitutional governance, there is still a need for a heightened sensitivity towards the role of women in the University, and the library still needs much work in the area of holdine:s and financial support. 
LaFortune Renovation: Most of the work was completed over semester break, including new stairwells, offices renovations on the third and fourth floors, and extensive painting. The Huddle, though, is still in drastic need of renovation. 
Student LUe Council: After spending an entire semester on the sexuality ruling, the SLC has so mcuh back work to do that it will probably take them three months to fall reasonably behind in their schedule. What is needed is a redefinition of purpose, which the SLC should take up but not spend more than one week on. 
Student Activities: The main problem in this area has stemmed from a alck of central direction in the office of student activities. This office should be more than a money exchange. The fast for hunger showed what can be done when ideas, not just cash, are put to work in the University. 
Co-Education: The University has 
reached a point of stagnation in this area. 
There has been a general ignorance of 
the needs and roles of women in an 
academic community, and a real lack of 
communication between all parties in­
volved, resulting in an artificial co­
educational institution. 
Hall Life: The drinking rules, set early 
in the semester, have all but destroyed 
the social life that was on its last legs 
even before the rules were set. Once 
again, the question arises, "where do we 
go from here?". 
All in all, it was a semester charac­
terized by a lack of direction and pur­
pose. What is needed now is some leader 
or organization that can begin to set the 
Notre Dame Community back on its feet. 
The areas of concern are obvious, the 
motivation for attacking these areas 
conspicuoulsy absent.

biI I brink 
AnY,one that spent any amount of time in an automobile over Christmas break realized, perhaps for the first time in their life, what true torture really was. For unless you were lucky enough to be gifted with a tape deck of FM radio in your car, you were probably tormented by the ultimate testimony to God's wrath manifested on earth-AM radio. 
Whether traveling the route to and from home to school, or embarking on the long drive down to Florida for the Orange Bowl, or just driving around town, it was impossible to escape the mer­ciless cycle of those 15 or 20 regular AM songs that pounded in­cessantly on around the clock. 
It is a rather dubious distinction of AM radio that they manage to select the ten or fifteen worst songs on the charts as the core of their music programs. They then choose five or six good songs that you liked when you first heard them and play them so constantly (sometimes they just let the disc keep going around and around) that you are ultimately completely repelled and nauseated by them. The combination makes for a program of songs so devastating as to be unsafe for small children, people with heart conditions and Mormons. 
What one of us can now listen to such tunes as "Lau_ghter in the Rain" or "Angie Baby" without wondering exactly what it is we have done to disturb the gods above. How many of us have forfeited our membership in the Barry White and Helen Reddy fan clubs just for that reason? And how many can endure that worst of all social and moral injustices, "Kung Fu Fighting" without seriously contemplating committing homicide on a mass of wires and transistors? 
One can see the effects of this disease spreading throughout all listeners. Drive down any highway where travellers have doub­tless been putting up with AM junk for hours and you will see a variety of methods aimed at releasing frustrations with it. Some take the easy way out and simply drive their cars off a cliff, leaving those deadly notes to prey on whatever unfortunate lies below. Others take an ecstatic delight in manually crushing the dastardly instrument with a sledgehammer until they can finally answer "never" to that haunting question "When Will I See You Again?" 
Admittedly there are alternatives to listening to suffering through hours of agonizing AM. For one, you can turn the radio off and find out how boring your family and friends actually are. Or you can switch the channels and take your chances with the other offerings of AM. If you're lucky you might pick up an exciting local high school basketball game between Wombley High and Kyler· town Catholic, or live coverage of the annual Azales festival in Topeka, or maybe even Divorce Court. If however, you hit a streak of bad luck you may be subjected to such cultural materila as the Mississippi Educational Network, the United States Steel Children's Hour (first lessons-stocks and bonds), or Howard Cosell. And when you finally get the complete, 40-minute sound· track of the cattle being driven through the main street of Waco, Texas, you know it's time to switch happily back to Karen Car­penter and "Mr. Postman." 
One has to speculate at just why the AM radio stations persist in playing such constant trash. Surely there is no station manager or disc jockey so sadistic that they actually get pleasure out of tor­menting their audience so. And even if there was, surely there would not be a whole country full of them, as indeed there seems to be. 
There is really only one explanation. Undoubtedly it is all part of a communist plot to brainwash or drive insane the listeners of AM radio in America. Controlling all AM stations in the country from a powerful underground studio in Teaneck, N. J., the Reds con­tinually play and replay those destructive songs until our minds have been converted; either into rice, or into that blank Tabula Rasa which they may then retrain. In this way, it is only a matter of time until they gain complete domination of the U.S. 
I knew this theory was correct when the other day I heard someone call up a disc jockey and actually request Kung Fu Fightin. I knew then that they had started to get to some of us. Everyone knows that the "funkyChinaman" is Red Chinese. In fact, when you think about it, it's a little bit frightening! Soon the country will be a mass of AM minds thinking in much the same way as Congress and speaking and acting in a manner closely resem­bling the Doublemint Twins. Then we will all be easy prey for any communist antago.1ists. 
In an effort to combat such subversive influences on the AM airwaves it would be advisable for government leaders to create an AM station which plays only toe works of John PhillipSouzaand the Johnny Mann Singers to remind listeners just where their loyalty lies. Only that way can we escape the communist threat and get rid of those AM blues.

The Unreal Strain fred r:~raver 
When you return from Christmas vacation, laughter comes easy this place feels firm and comfortable; the faces of friends shine with fresh excitement. But all too soon, the laughter and comfort and freshness bend under an unreal strain, and the shiny facade of Notre Dame reveals its harsh and severe tension in the everyday drone of life here. 
For a week or two, this place has the feel of something rented out for the occasion of the return of the students. The snow lies peacefully on the ground, there is an air of grace and happiness surrounding the reunion of friends, and everything is light and music and a festival. 
But the rented fantasyland turns out to be a poorly constructed disguise. The pleasantries fall flat like the backdrop in an amateur play, and the audience turns to leave the theatre and head 'PLEASE COOPERATE . I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE!' back out into the dark streets. Fro those that know this place, know that it has never been able to cover its true nature very well.

to Joe Corpora, one of the director's of the independent student organization which has slated several activities for the day. 
Corpora, who has acted as coordinator for Wednesday's activities, noted that two million abortions have been performed since the Supreme Court decision. 
During the day the United States flag will be flown at half-mast on the campus. Bells will tool every 15 seconds between the hours of toon and one, the time that the abortion decision was handed down two years ago. 
In addition, a paid ad­vertisement will apear in The Observer, which will read: 'We the undersigned are opposed to abortion on demand and are hopeful that the right to life may be restored to all unborn children." The ad will bear a total of 2610 names, taken from petitions which circulated throughout both campuses. 
The purpose of the petition was to make people in the community aware of the aboriton issue, as well as aware of the Students for Life organization, Corpora explained. 
"The intent behind the ad is to show people and to show legislators how the members of this community view abortion," stated Corpora. He added that each person whose name appears paid 25 cents towards its purchase. 
"It's common sense that a human life amendment will not be passed by one sole thing; it will take hundreds of things to show legislators how their constituency feel." Corpora explained. 
Thus, all those whose names appear in ad are as,ed to circle their name and send a copy of the entire ad to their Senators and Representatives. 
The high point of Wednesday's commemoration will be a high Mass to be celebrated by Reb. Theodore Hesburgh, university president. The Mass, which will be concelebrated by the priests of the Notre Dame community as well as several Holy Cross priests of the South Bend-Mishawaka area, will "be a visible sign of this com­munity's commitment to the right to life," said Corpora. 
Corpora also commented that, "It is not just through politics or education, but most especially through the prayer and the grace of God that the hope of a human life amendment may be realized." 
Since this hope will be one of the 
themes of the Mass, the celebrants 
will be wearing green vestments, 
the color of hope. 
The Jerome Ganser Family, a 
three-generation family of South 
Bend, will present the offertory 
gifts. Corpora explained the "the 
Students for Life organization, as 
any Right to Life organization, is 
concerned with preserving life at 
all stages---from the moment of 
conception until natural death." 
In speaking of the Mass, Corpora 
indicated that the Students for Life 
"hope that everyone in this 
Catholic, Christian community can 
come together for an hour of 
prayer to God in hope that He be 
with us this day." 
Noting that several seminar· 
classes are generally conducted · 
during the time that the Mass is to· 
be held, Corpora indicated that he 
hoped that these classes could be from UPI and AP. In addition, WNDU-TV will videotape the Mass for future broadcast. 
Throughout the day WNDU's opinion forum, "Pulse," will feature the message of the NO­SMC Students for Life on radio and television broadcasts. 
In citing the goals of the ND-SMC Students for Life, of which sophomore Keefe Montgomery is executive director, Corpora noted that "as an organization, our goal is to work so that a human life amendment is passed. This is the mutual goal of hundreds of Right to Life organizations throughout the U.S." 
He continued, "Furthermore, we hope to educate the entire com­munity to the reality of abortion and also to what is happening in our country in regard to euthanasia and mercy killing." This goal will be partially ac­complished through upcoming lectures to be held in each dorm of both campuses. 
The proposed human life amendment which Corpora refers to is the Helmes-Hogan Amend­ment, which reads: 
"Section 1: Neither the United States nor any State shall deprive any human being, from the moment of conception, of life without due process of law; nor deny to any human being, from the moment of conception, within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws. 
Section 2: Neither the United States nor any State shall deprive any human being of life on account of age, illness, or inadequacy. 
Section 3: Congress and the several States shall have the power to enforce this article by ap­propriate legislation." 
This amendment would in­validate the 1973 Supremeeme Court ruling. According to the '73 decision, Corpora explained that "In the first three months of pregnancy, no state can deny a

Alcohol bill seen as 'solution' 
by Pat Hanifin Staff Reporter 
The new bill exempting colleges and universities from liability for injuries caused by students using alcohol would be a "partial solution" to the Notre Dame liquor problem according to University Counsel Philip Faccenda whose office drafted the legislation. 
The bill, introduced in the In­diana Legislature last week by State Senate President Pro Tempore Philip Gutman, is designed to protect the state's universities from suits based on the Bratton case which last April held that a property owner could be liable for damages caused by a minor who consumed liquor on his premises without his knowledge. 
"We sre trying to limit the universities' 'vicarious liability,' "

woman an abortion. uuring the 
next three months no state can 
prohibit a woman from abortion, 
but may set up guidelines 
governing it. Finally, no state may 
prohibit an abortion during the last 
three months of pregnancy if it is 
necessary to save the life or health 
of the mother." 
The South Bend Right to Life 
group has worked in conjunction 
with the ND-SMC Students for Life 
towards the success of the Mass. 
The South Bend Right to Life 
chapter is one of nearly thirty such 
organizations formed in Indiana 
alone during the two years since 
the abortion decision. 
Corpora also made mention of 
the march organized by the South 
Bend group. Marchers will 
assemble at the Right to Life office 
in South Bend at 320 North 
Lafayette, and will proceed to the 
office of Congressman John 
Brademas. 
"It will be a non-violent 
demonstration," Corpora ex­
plained, "We're picketing 
Brademas' office because he is 
pro-abortion and anti-life." 
Several students have already 
left for Washington to participate 
in Wednesday's national march, 
which is expected to draw 30,000­
40,000 people. Each of those 
planning to march was asked to 
bring one pound of rice to be sent to 
the drought-stricken nations of 
Africa. 
Faccenda explained. "That is, liability for actions which the school is unaware of. If a student gets his alcohol from the University that is of course dif­ferent. 
Faccenda pointed out that there were two possible responses to the Bratton case. "Obviously the best would be to lower the drinking age but the University cannot lobby for that without risking its tax-exempt status. There is also very strong opposition to 18-year-Qld drinking in some parts of the state." 
The second alternative is the vicarious liability bill. Faccenda developed this approach over the summer and the proposed legilsation was drafted by legal interns in the university counsel's office. 
"In meetings with state 
legislators we were fortunate 
enough to interest Senate 
President Gutman and several 
other influential members in 
aiding the state's schools in this 
matter,'' Faccenda said. "We 
asked them not to impose greater

liabilities on us than we could ogically be expected to bear." 
-Faccenda feels that this bill is more likely to be adopted than one lowering the drinking age because "even people opposed to any use of alcohol do not wish to open the endowment funds of colleges and universities to massive civil suits arising from student drinking." 
Faccenda also indicated that he had spoken to other universities and colleges in the state and was gathering support from them for the bill. "They couldn't or wouldn't support a lower age but they can support this,'' he said. 
An institution of higher learning would be exempt from liability for injuries due to student drinking "unless that institution or its agent knowingly and intentionally sold, bartered, exchanged, provided or furnkshed an alcoholic beverage to a person that the institution or its agent must have known was a minor, habitual qrunkard or in­toxicated person." 
The bill would go into effect 
immediately upon passage.
