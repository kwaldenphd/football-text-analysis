Students celebrate sweet victory

Suspect

Seniors left Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday feeling content after the football team defeated Boston Col­lege 16-14.
Though the Irish won by less than he expected, se­nior Matt Sushinsky said he was still happy with the out­come.
“It is always nice to win, but I think we should have won by a lot more seeing as how we were playing Boston College. But a win is a win,” Sushinsky said.
Participating in the tra­ditional Senior Day marsh­mallow fight was especially enjoyable for Sushinsky.
“The marshmallow fight was a lot of fun. It is nice that the seniors have a great tradition for their fi­nal home game,” Sushin­sky said. “It did get a little messy, but I think we all had a blast.”
Seniors rushed the field after the Irish victory, a tra­dition Sushinsky said meant a lot to him.
“For all Notre Dame stu­dents, the field is a sacred place,” Sushinsky said. “Be­ing able to go out there af­ter the game and walk on the field where some of the greatest football players have played was a great fi­nale to my four years here. 
“It also was nice to touch the grass before they decide to get turf or something.”
Senior Meghan Donoghue said a lackluster effort by the Irish did not hinder the football environment. 
“[Saturday] definitely was not the best performance I have seen in my four years here,” Donoghue said. “How­ever, I was caught up in the moment of this being my fi­nal time inside Notre Dame Stadium as a student, so I was not affected by the play on the field.”
Donoghue said the atmo­sphere in the senior student section was amazing.
“Being around fellow classmates made us all feel lucky to attend a school where there is so much co­maraderie,” Donoghue said. “Needless to say, it was a great ending to our four-year football careers.”
Senior Chris­tina Car­son echoed Donoghue’s feelings re­garding the environment at the last home game.
“All of the seniors rallied around the fact that it was the last home game,” Car­son said. “There was tons of spirit which was cool.”
Carson said going onto the field after the game was the highlight of the bittersweet weekend.
“It was fun to get on the field after the game, al­though it was not as anticli­mactic as previous years,” Carson said. 
Both Donoghue and Car­son agreed that the Irish of­fense must show up in Palo Alto, Calif., on Saturday if the team is to have a chance of knocking off the Cardinal.
“Stanford is a really good team,” Donoghue said. “Hopefully we can put on a good show­ing, but no matter the outcome, we have had a great run at it this year.”
Carson re­flected on the loss of senior running back Jonas Gray to injury.
“The absence of [Jonas] Gray will significantly hurt our running game, but hopefully we will be able to put some points up on the board,” Carson said.

Annual Riley luncheon honors Dance Marathon 

Governor addresses education


By KIMBERLY WESTPHAL
News Writer
The Saint Mary’s College-Notre Dame Dance Marathon (SMC-ND DM) executive offi­cers attended the annual Hope Happens Here Luncheon for the Riley Children’s Founda­tion in Indianapolis on Friday. 
 “The Annual Riley lun­cheon is one of my favorite events to attend because it helps put into perspective what Dance Marathon helps support,” president Rebecca Guerin said.
Junior Amy Tiberi, vice president of internal rela­tions for the SMC-ND DM, said around 1,500 people attended the Hope Happens Here lun­cheon. All of the attendees were donors to Riley Chil­dren’s Hospital in some way. Also in attendance were Riley patients, parents and doctors, as well as executives for the hospital, Indiana University and Butler University. 
“It was a reminder of what Dance Marathon does for the patients and staff of Riley,” Tiberi said. “It was renewing and made me much more mo­tivated to make this an amaz­ing year for our marathon.”
The luncheon is an annual meeting to touch base with all the donors and let them know how their profits have been put to good use at Riley Children’s Hospital, she said. The Riley Board of Governors, amongst other speakers, ex­pressed gratitude toward the donors and detailed plans for future fundraisers. 
Junior Maureen Parsons, vice president of finance for the marathon, said the lun­cheon was an opportunity for the Riley Foundation to thank those who have given to Riley over the last year, including

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie spoke about public schools and family at the “Education and the Law” symposium on Friday in the Eck Hall of Law. 

By NICOLE MICHELS
News Writer
New Jersey Gov. Chris Chris­tie drew on his childhood schooling as an example for education reform Friday in the Eck Hall of Law. 
Christie delivered the key­note address of the symposium titled “Education and the Law,” sponsored by the Notre Dame Law Review, to a packed house.  
To understand how he feels about the issue of public schools, Christie said he would need to explain his origins in Newark,  N.J., and how that re­lated to the quality of his edu­cation. 
Christie said he is convinced he wouldn’t be where he was today if his parents had not re­located his family to another school district, because the Newark public school system was not adequately educating its students.
This has driven Christie to seek ways to improve public schooling to ensure that to­day’s children will be better prepared than the previous generation to meet life’s chal­lenges, he said.  
“I can’t help thinking how many men and women in the public schools system have the talent to be the next governor of New Jersey, but they never

Strangers connected by roadside mishaps reunite
EAU CLAIRE, Wis. — A motorist who had a heart attack but was kept alive by a stranger whom just min­utes earlier he had stopped to help along a Wisconsin interstate has had a tearful reunion with that woman and the first responders who saved his life.
Victor Giesbrecht, 61, expressed his gratitude Wednesday to Sara Berg, the Eau Claire woman who performed CPR on him just a few miles further along the Interstate 94 from where he had helped her to change a tire.
“He said ‘thank you’ and we hugged, then we both started crying,” Berg told the Eau Claire Leader-Tele­gram. First responders also attended the reunion at Giesbrecht’s room at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire. Giesbrecht hoped to be released Thursday.
Powder in love letters from inmates prompts scare
WATERTOWN, N.Y. — Two inmates who tried to sweet­en their love letters, quite literally, by adding a sprin­kling of sugar to the enve­lopes accidentally touched off a hazardous-materials scare at a prison in upstate New York.
The Watertown Daily Times reports that authori­ties noticed something leak­ing out of the envelopes Friday at the Watertown Correctional Facility, and state police and firefighters were brought in.
In one case it turned out to be sugar. The other was lem­onade mix.
The Department of Cor­rections says one inmate, Jafar Torkpour of Broome County, had added sugar to a note telling a woman he was still “sweet” for her. Another inmate, Desmond McNeil of Queens, did the same thing, telling a woman his love for her was “sweet enough.”
Authorities say both men could be disciplined.

Alumnus attends 382 consecutive home games

By BROOKE KOVANDA
News Writer
Regardless of traffic, weath­er or even the possibility of his children being born, for the past 382 consecutive home football games, Notre Dame alumnus Charles “Chuck” Falkenberg has been in the stands. 
Falken­berg began attending games with his father in 1939, said Martin Falkenberg ‘90, Falken­berg’s son. Charles eventually graduated from the University in 1952, and continued his streak through the years as seven out of his 10 children went on to attend Notre Dame. 
Now, 72 years after his first home game, four of Falken­berg’s grandchildren are at Notre Dame. 
Brian Falkenberg, a sopho­more in Alumni Hall; Tommy Falkenberg, a sophomore in Stanford Hall; Rebecca Mori­arty, a sophomore in McGlinn Hall; and Danny Falkenberg, a freshman in Knott Hall, all enjoy the tra­dition that has been part of their fam­ily their en­tire lives and admire their grandfather’s unwavering enthusiasm.
The grand­children all agreed that their memo­ries, as well as their grandfa­ther’s passion for the Univer­sity, undoubtedly influenced their desire to come to Notre Dame.
“I just have memories go­ing back as far as I can really remember. I mean, just go­ing tailgating with my family, stuff like that,” Danny said.
Moriarty recalls attend­ing her first game as a fresh­man with her cousins Tom­my and Bri­an and how exciting it was to take a picture with them, her grandfather and all of their parents.
Martin said he attributes two major reasons to Falkenberg’s passion and dedication: his love for the University and family.   
“Obviously the first reason is the love of the University,” Martin said. “But secondly, it was something he did with his father. My grandfather went with him every weekend until he passed away in 1972. Then my oldest sisters were old enough to go every weekend, so Notre Dame football was something that transcended the generations. 
Most of my family who have graduated [from Notre Dame] go back every week, and it’s something we can all do to­gether. It’s a social activ­ity — we all love Notre Dame foot­ball, and we love the Uni­versity and everything it stands for.
“You know, my father is a persistent guy. Whenever I in­troduce my father at football games, I always say he hasn’t missed a game since 1939, and most people are pretty amazed at that streak.”  
Falkenberg’s daughter, Grace Moriarty ’80, said that his streak was never a goal.  
“For him, it’s just a part of his life,” she said. “I don’t think it was ever intentional.”
As for the countless obsta­cles Charles Falkenberg faced in attending game day week­ends, the alum always found a way to persevere.
“We tried to arrange dates so that they didn’t [conflict with home football games]. That was just a given, he was going to be there,” Grace said with a laugh. “We didn’t schedule things on football days.” 
Danny said even the great­est of conflicts couldn’t deter Charles’ devotion to Notre Dame.
“He’s almost missed his children being born,” Danny said. 
Saturday’s victory over Bos­ton College marked Charles’ 382nd consecutive home game and Falkenberg’s family said he has no plans of stopping the tradition. His family re­mains loyal to continuing his legacy. 
“It was all him. He was the one who started it,” Tommy said.

will because we can’t stand up for the children,” Christie said.
Christie cited numerous sta­tistics demonstrating the fail­ure of Newark public schools to provide quality education and prepare its students for college or a career. He said 23 percent of Newark’s kids who entered the 9th grade two months ago will graduate with a diploma in four years, and that 90 percent of Newark’s high school grads who go to community college need at least one year of reme­dial education to even sit in a college class.
“They’re not college or ca­reer-ready,” he said. “Though the money spent on these kids per pupil is well above the na­tional average, it only goes to­wards an abject failure.”
His primary argument is that the education system needs to be structured differently so kids from different backgrounds can benefit.  
“For the kids having problems at home, we need to change the system,” Christie said. “Why do we teach those children the same way that we teach my children and say that both should be successful? It doesn’t make sense.”
Christie said his outlook is dictated by common sense. He focused on several points, but related everything back to this need for increased practical­ity. Among other ideas, Christie said he wants a longer school day, different teaching methods and merit-based pay practices used in challenged school dis­tricts.
Despite the immediacy of other concerns, Christie said that first and foremost the focus should be on accountability.
“No place else in American success do we demand so little for accountability for the prod­uct that is produced,” Christie said.
With a va­riety of mea­sures, Chris­tie would see this demand for increased accountability institutional­ized, but not by standards mandated by any national legislation. Christie said he believes each state should be allowed to craft in­dividual state solutions to this issue.
“More stuff being decided at the local level will permit in most instances better deci­sions being made to address socioeconomic realities and to avoid one size fits all solutions,” Christie said.
Structuring national legis­lation to empower the states to pursue innovations that will better the school systems, Christie said, is the best role for the national government to ful­fill in this situation — and the best chance for bipartisan coop­eration.
He cited re­cent successes in Indiana, Il­linois and Ohio as examples of this successful cooperation.
“One thing that I think about this is­sue is that it is not partisan,” Christie said. “Given the state of politi­cal dialogue in our country shouldn’t we seize this to show that we can actu­ally agree on something? This is a moment that we can come together and do something im­portant for people who haven’t decided yet if they want to be Democrats or Republicans.”
Despite the difficulties in overcoming the enormity of the problem, Christie said he is not ready to write off the ability of public school systems to get stu­dents career and college ready.
Fr. Tim Scully, director of the Institute for Educational Initia­tives at the Center for Social Concerns, said it was refreshing to hear someone speak his mind without worrying about the po­litical response. This talk, Scul­ly said, fit in nicely in response to the positions taken by others earlier in the symposium.   
“I just find that whenever you have a frank and open dialogue by such a thoughtful public leader, raising important ques­tions, that it really does embody what a university is all about,” Scully said.
Christie said above all, soci­ety has an obligation to reform education so that every child can realize his or her full poten­tial.
“I am from there. That could have been me,” Christie said. “There is no more important moral imperative than pre­venting that, and to do that we must stop putting the comfort of adults ahead of the potential of children.”

BFA students integrate technology into art theses

By NICOLE TOCZAUER
News Writer
Hidden away in Riley Hall, eight senior design and art stu­dio majors are in the progress of completing their thesis projects for their Bachelor’s of Fine Arts (BFA) degree.
The BFA degree differs from the Bachelor’s of Arts degree due to the amount of time re­quired for studio art, accord­ing to the Art, Art History and Design website. Though paint, photography and programming compose an expected mix of me­dia, many of this year’s seniors decided to integrate technology into their theses as well. 
Senior Ryan Geraghty, an in­dustrial design major, delved into the world of audio technol­ogy to develop his senior thesis, titled “HUSH.”
“HUSH stands for Honed Ul­tra Sonic Harmonies,” Geraghty said. “Essentially, I’m making a cone of silence.”
Geraghty said the original focus of his project was to help people fall asleep.
“I dealt with insomnia in high school, so that was important to me,” he said. “Later, when I in­terned through ISSLP in Nepal with the Fair Trade Company, I was exposed to Tibetan singing bowls. They create a powerful noise that immediately relaxes you. It was then that I realized how little we know about sleep.”
Geraghty researched the topic further and found noise pollu­tion to be a major factor in re­laxation and focus.
“By 5 years old, we learn to tune things out,” he said. “This actually inhibits the amount of processing you can do. Silence is important.”
Geraghty decided to combine parametric speakers, ultrasonic frequencies and noise masking to create his own white noise.
“Instead of sound going all directions, these cause them to become muted or directed into a beam,” he said. “With HUSH, you point it at yourself and ev­erything gets muffled.”
Though the initial idea was meant to address sleep issues, the project would be most appli­cable in the work place, he said. Geraghty said HUSH would be useful for a library in an urban environment.
While Ger­aghty focused on the combi­nation of au­dio and art, senior Aman­da Carter de­cided to work with visual media.
Carter, a graphic de­sign and Ger­man double major, de­cided to create a children’s video game. The game, “Stray,” focused on a sheep that walked with two legs instead of four and was designed to discourage bul­lying among younger children, she said.
“The sheep realizes along the way that his boring four-legged sheep friends actually have their own unique skills that help him solve puzzles and rescue other sheep,” Carter said. “Children can empathize with someone who is different and realize these differences are what make each of use a unique and con­tributing member of a commu­nity.”
Carter said the interactive world of video games was the perfect way to reach her tar­get audience. She worked with two software developers, Notre Dame senior Brian Rockwell and Duke University senior Dan­iel Koverman, to make the game a reality.
“We don’t have a game develop­ment program here, but the fun­damentals I learned in various programming and interactive design classes gave me a head start,” Carter said. “Through this project, I’m learning how to work together with program­mers and how to adapt my graphics to an interactive en­vironment.”
Nicholas Gunty, a paint­ing major, also used visual technology as the founda­tion of his se­nior thesis. His paintings high­light the dynamic between pho­tography and painting in photo-realistic renderings of light, he said.
“It’s a matter of dichotomies . the dualistic characteristics of photography and painting, but also of light,” he said. “We often see light as an instant, but it’s temporal and can be also some­what linear with long exposures in photography.”
Gunty said he thought of the idea one night while photo­graphing cars traveling up a hill in Toledo, Spain, while studying abroad. 
“I looked at the LCD screen and thought it would be a cool painting,” he said. “It was then that I began to flesh it out and figure out where it could go.”
Gunty said crafting a thesis is difficult, especially in art, be­cause the further a student pro­gressed, the more narrow the scope of the project became. The positive aspect however, was a more coherent, articulate im­age. This image was essential to communicating the artist’s message through visual media, he said.
“One thing in the back of my mind as an art student has been that there is a lot of value in studying images and visual rhetoric that’s important to hu­man culture,” he said. “In this thesis, and as a senior, the les­sons have become much more evident.”
The seniors’ theses will be dis­played in the Snite Museum this spring. Geraghty, Carter and Gunty said they would encour­age others to visit the exhibit.
“We put a lot of work into these, so I’d tell everyone to go check them out,” Geraghty said. “You can see some really inter­esting things there.”

“People, including Riley’s CEO and President, spoke to the attendees, and we saw videos of what Riley is doing for kids and their families,” Parsons said. “It reminded our executives of why we spend all year raising money and awareness for Riley Hospital.”
In addition, eight Riley pa­tients were recognized as 2012 Riley Champions for their ability to inspire others and raise awareness in their communities, which made an impact on multiple SMC-ND Dance Marathon executives.
Parsons said the Riley Champions shared their sto­ries and helped others under­stand all the amazing work continually done by Riley Children’s Hospital. 
“Some of these kids would not be alive today if it weren’t for the doctors are Riley Hos­pital,” she said. “I could tell that the champions really built a relationship with the doctors and nurses who had made them feel at home dur­ing their visits.” 
Senior David Fosselman, Notre Dame DM executive, said the luncheon was an great experience for him and the other executives. 
“Two years ago I volunteered to be a counselor at Camp Ri­ley — it is a summer camp for the children at Riley,” Fossel­man said. “While I was at the luncheon, I was able to see some of my old campers and co-counselors, which was nice and unexpected.” 
Senior Elizabeth Downs, DM campus relations execu­tive, said the luncheon made her especially excited for the marathon in the spring.  
“I had a great time. It makes me really excited for the actu­al marathon because I have a newfound gratitude for where all our donations go,” said Downs. “It makes me realize that what we’re all doing re­ally makes a difference.”

Law enforcement officials spray UC Davis protesters

Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO — Protesters sitting on the ground supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement on the campus of the University of California, Davis took a face full of pepper spray at close range from an officer in riot gear in an incident that was captured on cellphone video and spread viral­ly across the Internet Saturday.
UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi described the video imag­es as “chilling” and said she was forming a task force to investigate even as a faculty group called for her resignation because of the Friday police action.
However, a law enforcement of­ficial who watched the clip called the use of force “fairly standard police procedure.”
In the video, an officer dispas­sionately pepper-sprays a line of several sitting protesters who flinch and cover their faces but remain passive with their arms interlocked as onlookers shriek and scream out for the officer to stop.
“The use of the pepper spray as shown on the video is chilling to us all and raises many questions about how best to handle situa­tions like this,” Chancellor Linda Katehi said in a message posted on the school’s website Saturday.
The protest was held in sup­port of the overall Occupy Wall Street movement and in solidarity with protesters at the University of California, Berkeley who were jabbed by police with batons on Nov. 9.
The UC Davis video images, which were circulated on You­Tube and widely elsewhere on­line, prompted immediate out­rage among faculty and students, with the Davis Faculty Associa­tion saying in a letter Saturday that Katehi should resign.
“The Chancellor’s role is to en­able open and free inquiry, not to suppress it,” the faculty associa­tion said in its letter.
It called Katehi’s authorization of police force a “gross failure of leadership.”
At a news conference later on Saturday, Katehi said what the video shows is “sad and really very inappropriate.” The events surrounding the protest have been hard on her personally, but she had no plans to resign, she said.
“I do not think that I have vio­lated the policies of the institu­tion. I have worked personally very hard to make this campus a safe campus for all,” she said.
Katehi remained in a media room for more than two hours after the news conference, even­tually walking to an SUV past a silent group of students nearly three blocks long, many of them holding up signs calling for her to step down, the Sacramento Bee said.
The statewide Council of UC Faculty Associations issued a statement Saturday saying “We are outraged that the administra­tions of UC campuses are using police brutality to suppress dis­sent, free speech and peaceful as­sembly.”
Charles J. Kelly, a former Balti­more Police Department lieuten­ant who wrote the department’s use of force guidelines, said pep­per spray is a “compliance tool” that can be used on subjects who do not resist, and is preferable to simply lifting protesters.
“When you start picking up human bodies, you risk hurting them,” Kelly said. “Bodies don’t have handles on them.”
After reviewing the video, Kel­ly said he observed at least two cases of “active resistance” from protesters. In one instance, a woman pulls her arm back from an officer. In the second instance, a protester curls into a ball. Each  could have warranted more force, including baton strikes and pres­sure-point techniques.
“What I’m looking at is fairly standard police procedure,” Kelly said.
Images of police actions have served to galvanize support dur­ing the Occupy Wall Street move­ment, from the clash between protesters and police in Oakland last month that left an Iraq War veteran with serious injuries to more recent skirmishes in New York City, San Diego, Denver and Portland, Ore.

The real 99 percent

Inside Column

“Plugged out”

The Occupy Wall Street (OWS) move­ment is particularly fascinating to watch. Similar to many populist move­ments, it has come out of nowhere, and a mix of economic frustration, media coverage and trac­tion has expanded it more than anyone could have imag­ined.
The main prem­ise of Occupy Wall Street is that the 99 percent (a group that represents the bottom 99 percent of income earners) protest against the one percent (the top one percent of income earners). What many people do not realize is that this premise comes with an inherent irony: The 99 percent’s political beliefs are so extreme that they represent the beliefs of only a small percentage of the popu­lation (one percent perhaps?). Those who Occupy Wall Street are generally part of the extreme left, a group that was politically active long before Occu­py Wall Street started. The 99 percent is not the first, nor the last, extrem­ist group to claim they represent the American people. For example, the Tea Party, a relatively small group made up of people from the extreme right, also claimed to represent the American people. 
The group that really represents the vast majority of Americans is the “Silent Majority.” Silent Majority was a term popularized by Richard Nixon to describe the majority of Americans who did not engage in the protests against the Vietnam War amidst the increasing visibility of the protesters in the news.  
As Joe Klein pointed out in a recent “Time” magazine article, there is still a Silent Majority in America. The Silent Majority is composed of Ameri­cans who hold moderate views, are not active in politics and have low voter turnout rates. The Silent Majority does not fear a government takeover of health care, but it does fear the annual rise in their health care premiums. The Silent Majority does not call for the abolish­ment of student loan debt, but it won­ders what will happen if it works hard and saves but still can’t afford to put kids through college. If there was ever a group that could be labeled “the 99 percent,” it is the Americans who belong to the Silent Majority. 
The reason the Tea Party and OWS seem more representative than they actually are is due to their high turnout in American elections amidst embar­rassingly low voter turnout by the Silent Majority, especially in primary elec­tions. The prominence of extremes, left and right, over the past few decades has fueled the rise of a new generation of partisan politicians. It is not hard to see the political effects of this influence, as moderates perpetually lose to extremes in elections, and moderates in both par­ties move to the extremes to win their party’s nomination. 
As of right now, the main issue the Tea Party protests against is mount­ing deficits, and the main issue the 99 percent protests against is large income inequality. However, the main problem with protesting against deficits and income equality are that they are both symptoms of a larger problem: a less competitive America. 
Over the past thirty years, techno­logical advancement and globalization has created a more competitive world. This is a world in which America was, and currently is, unprepared to com­pete. The less competitive America has hollowed the middle class, leading to the economic inequality that the 99 percent protests against, and it has also increased the demand for the expensive social programs that have become the main drivers of the deficits that the Tea Party protests against. Like any good physician would say: You can’t cure someone by treating only the symp­toms of a disease; you need to treat the causes.   
Treating the causes of America’s lack of competitiveness means structural reforms to health care, infrastructure, immigration, education, energy and the tax code. I could go into detail about how leaving these unreformed makes for a less competitive America, but that would require much more than an 800-word opinion editorial.
Both the Tea Party and the 99 percent have ideas on how to best reform these components of the economy. But they often don’t realize that the only way big reforms happen in America is through bipartisanship because no one politi­cal party can ever accomplish the “big things” alone. Civil Rights in 1964 and Social Security reform in 1983 were both big, extremely controversial reforms and only happened because Democrats and Republicans were able to come together. There is no shortage of big reforms that America needs, just a shortage of lead­ers able to cooperate and get them done. 
Unfortunately, coming together is impossible if groups that make up one percent of the population like the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street fuel par­tisan politicians who tear Americans apart. The will only end when the one percent groups are overshadowed by a Silent Majority of Americans determined to take their country back.

Two weeks ago, my computer crashed. 
All of the papers, projects and any other assignments I had spent count­less hours slaving over were gone. Just like that.
Despite these seemingly huge losses, I think the computer crash actually helped me more than it hurt. In a strange way, I learned some in­valuable lessons.
Sure, when it first happened, I absolutely pan­icked. It seemed like the end of the world.
How could all of the major academic pieces of my college career be gone?
But then I began to realize: It doesn’t matter. In the end, you can’t take it with you. Nothing is permanent.
And even though all of those things seem so important now, they really aren’t.
I think many Notre Dame students become too wrapped up with their grades and their GPAs. It’s certainly something I’m guilty of, too.
But I’m going to say something that may shock many of you actually read­ing this — they don’t really matter. The worry and anxiety just isn’t worth it.
Once I graduate and begin my first job (whatever it is and wherever it may be), the things I’ve learned in the classrooms here at Notre Dame, while interesting and informative, won’t actually help me in any way. Future employers won’t care about any of those papers or projects and the time I spent working on them.
Life in the “real” world cannot be taught; it can only be experienced. No matter how much we do learn from our professors, nothing they teach us can possibly prepare us for that first day at our new job or anything we will encounter in our careers.
I’m certainly not saying my time at Notre Dame has been a waste or that I have not learned anything. If anything, it’s taught me what really matters in life and what, quite simply, doesn’t.
The computer crash also taught me that it’s actually okay to be a little bit disconnected from the world around you every once in a while. Surpris­ingly, it’s really refreshing.
Sure, I have a “smart” phone, so I still had access to my email, but it was pretty liberating not to be constantly “plugged in.” 
I know the world today thrives on technology, but sometimes we really should take a break from it. Not being able to tweet or see the latest status updates on Facebook may seem chal­lenging at first, but I guarantee if you try it, you’ll find it just as liberating as I did.
Although my break from technology wasn’t by choice, I’m certainly glad it happened. It allowed me to take stock and reevaluate what really matters in my life. Some things just aren’t worth worrying or getting worked up about.
So, don’t sweat the small stuff, no matter how big it may seem — includ­ing a computer crash.

The National School of the United States

There is a tech revolution brewing in education that will change how we learn critical skills. People attack the problems of education with great ideas that require significant policy change. I have an idea the current adminis­tration can enact now that will further the educa­tion of Americans for years to come without as significant an effort. I will call this program “The National School of the United States,” or “The National School” for short. 
The National School is a completely online institution where the nation’s best teachers will record video lectures to teach classes from primary school to college. They will teach classes that are required by all 50 states as well as classes that are just plain interesting and good to take. The initial idea is to supplement education resources and give Americans access to knowledge for free via streaming online video content. What it could eventually evolve into is a whole new approach to how we educate the youth of America and give every­one an equal opportunity at education in this country, regardless of financial background.  
 This is not an original idea, but it is an original application. Video lectures are a growing movement in higher edu­cation, as well as online coursework. OpenCourseWare was started by MIT to provide course lectures free of charge online; it has also been adopted in Chi­na and Japan. The Teaching Company is a private company that puts out video lecture series on different academic subjects and charges for access. The Khan Academy is a series of educational videos and progress tracking software available for free. The University of Phoenix is an accredited university with a large percentage of virtual students. YouTube contains thousands of ama­teur and professional lecture tapings from classrooms all over the world. The technology is there; now is the time to harvest the crop. 
The National School will take the best teachers in America and give them an online classroom to teach thousands, and potentially millions, of students. There are already many awards and programs that recognize outstand­ing teachers nationwide, so it would not be hard to find recruits.  Plus, we could pay these teachers very well for the great service they would be doing for the country. These teachers would be primary school educators teaching cursive, basic mathematics, reading and writing. They would be middle and high school teachers teaching Shakespeare, algebra, chemistry, public speak­ing, foreign language and computer programming. They will be faculty at universities and colleges teaching philosophy, design, theology, biochemis­try, marketing and architecture. There is no end to the scope of what could be taught. 
You want to take science classes with Creationism as opposed to evolution? Go ahead. You want to take a class that predicates Global Warming as real? Fine. Even things such as military sci­ence, hobbyist activities and artistic endeavors could be taught.  Multiple teachers in each subject will give the depth and breadth even the most curious student would want.  Teachers will be held accountable because their content will be out there to be analyzed, commented on and judged for accuracy and popular opinion. We would create a vast suppository of freely accessible knowledge not seen since the Ancient Library of Alexandria.   
 While school is great for learning how to interact with others and learn­ing and working in groups, it’s not that advantageous over online learning. I would argue you can achieve a better education at the purely academic level by taking online classes and supple­menting them with occasional live help. Make the lecture the homework and use class time for homework exercises. 
Schools are also great for extra-cur­riculars such as arts and sports.  These are things that can’t always be taken online; however, some aspects such as proper technique when playing a saxophone or fundamentals of making a proper tackle can be taught virtually.  
At first, The National School will be a great resource for teachers nationwide to use in their own classrooms or assign for homework. What it later can become is a catalyst that makes the teaching field much more competitive, lucrative and fulfilling, while giving all students, including those disadvantaged by pov­erty, access to an education worthy of anyone. States could even experiment with using The National School as a replacement for certain school days, or as a study resource that students can use to pass tests to get them credit for classes. 
All these benefits, and we don’t have to force anyone to do anything or change a stubborn system. Education is the great equalizer and the one thing we all should be happy to pay to pass on to the next generation. 
In the meantime, I encourage the administrators of Notre Dame to look into joining OpenCourseWare or post­ing video lectures online for the benefit of those who are not as fortunate to be exposed to such a wealth of knowledge and talent on a daily basis.  Who are we to horde the tools of progress behind a wall of gold?

Letter to the Editor

Thank thee, 
Notre Dame

The girl of your dreams 
is here

Normally I use this space to distribute my pearls of wisdom regarding world affairs, but my mom told me to be more “lighthearted” this week. “You should remind people that there are a lot of good things out there,” she said. Okay, Mom. After hanging up the phone I thought about what to choose as my subject.
Soon enough, the most valuable pearl of wisdom appeared at the front of my brain. I learned it in first grade, and it had little to do with world affairs: Mom is always right.
Lo and behold, she is right again. There are 364 days a year to hear about the bombs and the blood, 364 days to witness adults act like children and 364 days to decide how we are going to fix problems that need fixing. I have every other Monday to use this space to act like I understand the issues that are too complex to fully grasp. But not today.
Thanksgiving is upon us, that single day for momentarily setting aside all that is wrong and reflecting on all that is right. Turns out, attending the great­est university in the world gives you a lot to be thankful for.
Who has it better than us? Notre Dame is a place where 365 days’ worth of thanks still would not suffice.
It’s a place where ghosts are never far. Our ghosts are not unwelcome ap­paritions that intrude and disturb, but the hospitable spirits of an immensely storied past. One cannot help but walk these grounds and know that he or she is part of something much greater than his or herself.
It’s home to South Quad and the kid wandering through on a Saturday in au­tumn, whose permanent smile endures amid the icy wind tearing through his ND Starter jacket. It’s then and there, between bites of an under-cooked hotdog, that he announces (to no one in particular) he’s decided where he’ll be going to college.
It’s a land where frat bros and soror­ity sisters are foreign and “going Greek” means the dining hall is serving gyros.
Notre Dame is a place where the per­petual glow of the Grotto permeates the black shield of the darkest nights. I’m thankful that I still haven’t gotten used to the intense tranquility of this place, and I’m hopeful that I never will.
It’s an environment that possesses the can-do attitude of its founder, a man who decided that simply erecting another school after the original one burned down would not suffice. No, the renewed University of Notre Dame du Lac needed a golden exclamation point on top for people near and far to see.
Most important of all, it will forever be the home of numerous alumni who represent an invaluable piece of history. These are the people to whom we owe our gratitude, because the objects on this campus amount to nothing without the tradition that gives them worth. Yes, Notre Dame makes great people. But let’s not forget that great people con­tinue to make Notre Dame. 
So, for the graduates who think that Notre Dame’s current students don’t appreciate its history, I promise that’s not the case. We see the weathered class rings on your fingers. We know that our dorm parties are happening in the same rooms that housed our parents and grandparents. We know that whether you graduated in 1949 or 2009, you’ll always point out the ways in which we have it better and easier now. We know that the Alma Mater still makes you cry. We know the standard that has been set and the legacy we have to fill. To all of you, from all of us — thank you.
Back to my earlier question: Who has it better than us? Nobody. Praise thee, love thee, thank thee, Notre Dame.

Mr. M. Marszowski of Dillon Hall,
I saw you dancing at Transpo and you were amazing. I was talking to my room­mate, who said, “He waltzes ‘Like a Star’ — he definitely ‘Lights Up My Life’ and makes me feel ‘Redeemed.’” I wanted to ask you if you wanted to dance the night away ... as my roommate’s date for our SYR. Did I mention that she’s the girl of your dreams? She’s tall, blonde and beautiful. But wait! That’s not all, there’s more! She’s also smart, funny and intelligent. You’re guaranteed to have a wonderful time, with nothing to lose and everything to gain! Oh by the way, it’s on Dec. 2, and we live in Lewis Hall. Bis dann!

By KEVIN NOONAN
Scene Writer
Clint Eastwood’s latest directorial ef­fort “J. Edgar” brings new meaning to the phrase, “The whole is less than the sum of the parts.”
Helmed by Eastwood, a two-time Os­car winning director, starring Leon­ardo DiCaprio, a three time Oscar nominated actor and Hollywood’s cur­rent can’t miss golden boy of dramatic pictures, and written by Dustin Lance Black, who won an Oscar for his origi­nal screenplay “Milk,” this biopic of for­mer FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and one of the most infamous men in American history seemed poised for greatness.
Yet the film mires in mediocrity. East­wood chooses to shoot the whole film in an awkwardly dark light, almost giv­ing the impression of black and white. While he was probably trying to imply the dark times and troubled soul of the film’s protagonist, it instead takes focus away from the actual film and makes for a visually dull movie.
Speaking of visually dull, as the film takes place in the form of Hoover as an old man recounting his life story to an FBI public relations writer in or­der to glorify his legacy, it requires the main characters in the film to look like they’ve aged significantly. However, the aging makeup effects that DiCaprio and his costars undergo just look silly.
DiCaprio gives a typical, stellar per­formance from beginning to end. He’s a good actor, there’s no denying that. Still, I’m tired of seeing him play the exact same character in every single film. DiCaprio can portray an emotion­ally troubled and morally questionable yet quietly heroic protagonist better than anyone else.
He did it in “Shutter Island,” “Incep­tion,” “Blood Diamond,” “The Depart­ed,” “Gangs of New York” and now “J. Edgar.” 
The next big film on DiCaprio’s slate is Baz Luhrmann’s remake of “The Great Gatsby,” in which he’ll play, hold your breath, the emotionally troubled, morally questionable yet quietly heroic Jay Gatsby.
Despite how good DiCaprio’s perfor­mance was in the film, all I could think about was every other time I’ve seen him do the exact same thing.
This, however, is nowhere close to what really drags this film down. It may hold it back from being great, but if that had been all that was wrong with this movie it would have been a very average film.
No, the biggest problem with the film was the misleading marketing of its subject matter. I walked in expecting a historical biography of one of the most powerful American men of the 20th century, because that was what I was led to believe by the film’s advertising.
What I saw, however, was a misguid­ed attempt at a “Brokeback Mountain” style love story.
As something of a history buff, I knew quite a bit about Hoover going into the film, and so I knew about his rumored affair with his number two man Clyde Tolson, played in the film by Armie Hammer aka the character who played the Winklevoss twins from “The Social Network.”
I expected the film would touch on the affair, and would have been disap­pointed if it had not. What I did not ex­pect was for Hoover’s closet homosexu­ality to be the center point of the whole movie, and the lens through which the story is told.
There is no homophobia here; “Broke­back Mountain” was one of most criti­cally acclaimed love stories of the last decade. But the reason it was so well received was because it was well done and did not shy away from its subject matter when marketing the film.
If all viewers had gone into the film expecting a John Wayne-style, shoot-‘em-up western, they would have been in for a bit of a surprise.
And even worse than the poor mar­keting of the film is that the story is not handled well.
Eastwood chooses to use a cross dressing scene as one of the emotional turning points of the film. It was a risky decision, and for it to work well it had to not only make sense in the greater scope of the film, but, like all emotional scenes, it also had to make the audi­ence truly feel with the character. It did neither of those things, and therefore felt flat and awkward.
All in all, “J. Edgar” is a disappoint­ingly and uncharacteristically below average effort for both Eastwood and DiCaprio, and one that truly does not do justice to such an intriguing and im­portant man in American history.

Jaguars fall short in Cleveland

Seattle wins two games straight, a first in 2011

Associated Press
CLEVELAND  — One mea­sly yard proved to be too long for Jacksonville.
The Jaguars’ comeback came up short. They couldn’t take the final step.
Rookie quarterback Blaine Gabbert threw an incomplete pass into the end zone on the game’s last snap, capping a curious sequence of plays by Jacksonville in the closing seconds and giving the Cleve­land Browns a 14-10 win Sun­day over the Jaguars.
Gabbert, who had some good and bad moments, threw behind wide receiver Mike Thomas in the middle of the end zone with the ball bouncing off Thomas’s out­stretched hands, denying the Jaguars (3-7) a victory that was within reach.
“Plain and simple, I have to make a play,” Gabbert said. “I have to find a way for us to score. That’s on me. I have to learn from that and get bet­ter. At the end of the day, it’s my job to score a touchdown.”
After Browns kicker Phil Dawson missed a 38-yard field goal with less than three minutes left, Gabbert drove Jacksonville from its own 29 to Cleveland’s 5, helped along by a pass interference call against the Browns. But with the end zone and a thrilling victory right in front of them, the Jaguars got bogged down when they couldn’t afford to.
On third down, Maurice Jones-Drew picked up 3 yards and a first at Cleveland’s 2 with 33 seconds left. Coach Jack Del Rio elected not to use his only timeout, and by the time the Jaguars snapped the ball again, 20 seconds had elapsed. Jones-Drew then picked up another yard and Del Rio called time with 8 seconds left.
Del Rio said the play took too long to run.
“We were way too deliber­ate,” Del Rio said. “You get lined up in that situation for sure. It wasn’t a matter of the timeout after that play, it was a matter of how long we sat there to get that (first down) play off. It was not what it needed to be.”
On second down, Gabbert’s pass to the back corner of the end zone bounced off wide re­ceiver Jason Hill’s chest with 3 seconds left. Browns cor­nerback Joe Haden believed he got a hand on Gabbert’s throw.
Then, on the final play, Gabbert couldn’t connect with Thomas, allowing the Browns to escape.
Gabbert wasn’t going to second-guess anything that happened. He just wants to learn from the experience.
“Hindsight is 20-20,” said Gabbert, who went 22 of 41 for 210 yards. “Everyone is going to have their opinion and think they have the best play to call, but it’s our job to go out and execute. We’ve got to put the ball in the end zone.”
Jones-Drew rushed for 87 yards and a 6-yard TD.
Del Rio was asked why he didn’t give the ball to his best player on the last play.
“You can make a case for doing that,” Del Rio said. “You can guess any number of plays when you don’t con­nect. We had two guys with the ball in the air in the vi­cinity — missed opportuni­ties.”
Jones-Drew didn’t second-guess the late-game deci­sions. He reasoned that wouldn’t change the final score.
“It hurts every time you lose, especially when you have an opportunity to win,” he said. “We’ve just got to keep work­ing. Somehow, some way, the locker room has to get tired of losing. That’s on the of­fensive side. Ten points is not going to win the game in this league at all. Our defense has been good week after week. We’ve got to make plays.
“If you can’t make plays, there’s no need to be playing football.”
When the Jaguars moved inside Cleveland’s 10, quar­terback Colt McCoy took a knee on the sideline, closed his eyes and the young quar­terback asked for some help from above.
This week, the Browns got it.
“There’s nothing wrong with praying,” McCoy said. “We deserved this one.”
Last week, the Browns lost 13-12 to the St. Louis Rams when Cleveland botched a snap and reliable kicker Phil Dawson missed a 22-yard field goal try. This one nearly ended under similar circum­stances as Jacksonville’s fi­nal drive was set up by Daw­son missing a 38-yarder that sailed over the top of the right post.
“Everybody played their hearts out and it’s about time it went our way,” said Browns linebacker D’Qwell Jackson, who covered Thomas tightly on the final play. “We knew it was up to us. Right there. We had to make the play and we did.”
McCoy shook off an ap­parent shoulder injury and threw a 3-yard TD pass to Josh Cribbs in the fourth to give Cleveland a 14-10 lead. But Dawson’s stunning miss with 2:49 left gave the Jag­uars (3-7) a final chance and Gabbert, who had some good and bad moments, nearly pulled off the comeback.


Associated press
ST. LOUIS — Sam Bradford slumped in a chair outside his locker stall, still in uniform long after teammates had showered and dressed.
Even though there are plenty of reasons for the struggles, the St. Louis Rams’ quarter­back is taking the team’s of­fensive woes personally.
Bradford was sacked five times, lost two fumbles and threw an interception in the Seattle Seahawks’ 24-7 victory on Sunday.
The Rams were held to 185 yards, their second-lowest to­tal of the season and the best effort of the season by the Se­ahawks.
“I’m beyond frustrated right now,” Bradford said. “I’ve never been on a team that has been in this situation. I don’t like it. I hope this is the only time in my career that I’m ever in a situation like this.”
Steven Jackson had a tough day, too. Running behind an injury-filled line, Jackson was held to 42 yards on 15 carries to end a run of three straight games of 125 or more yards.
The Rams (2-8) opened without starting tackles with Rodger Saffold (pectoral) and Jason Smith (concussion). Practice squad callup Kevin Hughes was called on to play after fill-in tackle Mark Levoir injured his right shoulder in the first half.
“We just couldn’t get it to­gether,” Jackson said. “We knew they were pretty good against the run. As the in­juries occurred and things went down, we became pretty much isolated to doing certain things.”
Wide receiver Sidney Rice completed a 55-yard pass to open the game, caught a touchdown pass and drew a pass interference call to set up a field goal in the first half for Seattle.
Chris Clemons had three of Seattle’s five sacks of Brad­ford and also forced the Rams quarterback to fumble twice, both of which led to touch­downs.
“We did a lot of the things that we talked about as a team that we couldn’t do if we want­ed to win the game,” Bradford said. “So, obviously, we have to take those things into account and not make those mistakes.
“We just have to keep going, keep fighting.”
Marshawn Lynch scored for the fourth straight week, al­though he missed on a third straight 100-yard game, fin­ishing with 88 yards on 27 carries.
The Seahawks (4-6) won on consecutive weeks for the first time, following up on an upset over Baltimore, and have won 12 of 13 in the se­ries.
Seattle improved to 2-4 on the road in a game notable for sloppy play and 19 punts, including a season-high 10 by the Rams’ Donnie Jones.
Lynch scored on a 3-yard run in the third quarter, five plays after Bradford fumbled at the St. Louis 25, and Justin Forsett broke several tack­les on a 22-yarder on third-and-11 to clinch it with 4:21 to go. The play came three plays after Red Bryant inter­cepted a pass tipped at the line by Brandon Mebane.
With under seven minutes to go in the first quarter, the Rams had two interceptions, a blocked punt and their first touchdown in the opening quarter since Jackson scored on a 47-yard run on St. Lou­is’ first offensive snap of the season against the Eagles.
After that, they couldn’t get going. A defense that totaled four sacks kept it close for a while, but the Rams never made it to the red zone and crossed the 50 only three times.
“I thought the defensive guys were battling their butts off,” coach Steve Spagnuolo said. “It’s hard to play de­fense when you’re behind and it’s hard to win games when you only score seven points.”
Seattle took a 10-7 lead on Steven Hauschka’s 19-yard field goal to end the half, one play after Justin King was called for interference in the end zone against Rice.
Rice executed a flea-flicker on the game’s first play, hit­ting Mike Williams in stride with a step on King for a 55-yard gain to the Rams 30. On the next play, Jackson was intercepted by Chris Cham­berlain.
The Rams didn’t take ad­vantage of that turnover, but Quintin Mikell’s pick on the Seahawks’ next series set up Brandon Lloyd’s 30-yard touchdown catch. Lloyd fell down on his route and then sprang to his feet to catch cornerback Richard Sherman by surprise.
Rice made his second big play on a 14-yard catch that tied it 7-all midway through the second quarter.
The Rams’ 10 first-down snaps in the half produced minus-2 yards.

NFL

Cutler injures thumb in Bears’ victory over Chargers


Associated Press
CHICAGO —  Jay Cutler led the Bears to their fifth straight vic­tory Sunday. It could be his last game with Chicago for a while.
The Chicago Tribune reported later Sunday that Cutler broke his right thumb during a 31-20 victory over the San Diego Char­gers and was expected to miss six to eight weeks.
The Bears would not confirm the report. Cutler’s agent, Bus Cook, did not return messages from The Associated Press.
The Tribune reported that Cutler was injured trying to prevent a touchdown on a 64-yard interception return by San Diego’s Antoine Cason in the fourth quarter. Cutler got knocked to the ground by line­backer Donald Butler.
He stayed in the game and wound up with 286 yards pass­ing, throwing for two touch­downs and running for another.
Cutler took longer than usual to come out for his postgame news conference but showed no visible signs of an injury. He and coach Lovie Smith did not men­tion it.
Losing Cutler clearly would be a huge blow for the Bears. They’ve made a big leap into contention in the NFC after they appeared to be coming apart, and without him, they’ll have to go with backup Caleb Hanie.
The reports about Cutler clearly overshadowed every­thing else on a day when Chica­go (7-3) handed the Chargers (4-6) their fifth straight loss, their longest slide since an 0-5 start in 2003. But it wasn’t easy.
Philip Rivers threw for 280 yards. For most of the game, he looked more like a Pro Bowl quarterback than the guy who had been turning it over at an alarming rate. But two late in­terceptions helped preserve the win for Chicago.
“I played against Philip and San Diego many times, and they’ve always had a high-powered offense and they’re not going to give up,” said Cut­ler, who lost four of five against the Chargers when he was with Denver. “They’re going to come back and fight. Philip is a smart quarterback. He knows where weaknesses are in defenses, es­pecially in the third and fourth quarter, so we knew we were going to be in a battle even though we kept scoring.”
The Bears were leading 31-20 when Cason returned his in­terception 64 yards to the Chi­cago 16 before being pushed out of bounds by Matt Forte, with help from Cutler. But instead of driving for a touchdown, Rivers sealed the loss when he tried to squeeze a pass to Vincent Jackson in the end zone but got picked off by Major Wright.
Rivers also was intercepted by Chicago’s Corey Graham in the closing minutes, giving the quarterback a league-leading 17 INTs, on a ball that he was trying to throw away.
Rivers said in hindsight he never should have thrown the ball that Wright intercepted, “but once it leaves your hand you can’t bring it back.”
Can the Chargers bounce back? They’ve been known to make late surges under Norv Turner, and they’ll need another one if they’re going to save this season.
But time may be running out.
“Absolutely,” Jackson said. “We only play 16 regular-sea­son games. We’re not like NBA; we’re not like hockey, so each and every one is precious.”
Playing the first of four straight games against AFC West opponents, Chicago got strong performances from Cut­ler and Johnny Knox to remain tied with Detroit for second place in the NFC North.
Cutler was 18 of 31 with an interception and did not get sacked, even though there was more shuffling on the line. Ed­win Williams replaced the in­jured Chris Williams at left guard.
Knox had three catches for 97 yards, including a twist­ing touchdown reception in the third quarter that made it a 14-point game, although he did slip on Cason’s interception. Earl Bennett came up big, too, with 75 yards receiving, and Roy Williams chipped in with 62 yards.
Devin Hester had a 37-yard punt return and a 22-yarder that set up a second-quarter TD run by Marion Barber. And along with his contributions on offense, Knox returned a kickoff 53 yards, leading to a TD catch by Kellen Davis late in the first half.
Charles Tillman had a key strip and fumble recovery, and the Bears extended a turn­around that seemed highly un­likely just a few weeks ago. Cut­ler was getting pounded, and the defense was giving up big plays.
The Bears got all they could handle Sunday after intercept­ing Matthew Stafford four times and forcing six turnovers in a lopsided win over the Lions a week earlier.
Rivers completed 21 of 31 passes, with Jackson catching seven for 165 yards.
San Diego had just tied it at 17 on a 5-yard TD catch by Jackson early in the second half when Cutler ran it in from the 1 after a 42-yard pass to Knox.
In a flash, it was a 14-point game.
Tillman stripped Ryan Mathews on the Chargers’ next play from scrimmage and made the recovery, giving the Bears possession at the San Diego 37.
Two plays later, a spinning Knox hauled in a 24-yard pass from Cutler in the left corner of the end zone with his back to the quarterback, making it 31-17. Nick Novak kicked a 48-yard field goal on the first play of the fourth quarter, but the Char­gers did not pick up a yard the rest of the way.
Rivers threw two incomple­tions after Cason’s big inter­ception return before getting picked off by Wright. And after the Bears worked 7½ minutes off the clock before punting, Graham got his interception with just under two minutes re­maining.
“It’s all on our defense,” Roy Williams said. “That’s it. Chi­cago football is defense and spe­cial teams. They keep kicking it to Devin. Devin’s giving us the short field. If he doesn’t score, we’re on the 40-yard line, we’re on the 30-yard line.”

Irish seek success in championships

Belles incur two losses over weekend


By PETER STEINER 
Sports Writer
After facing two tough teams in Manchester and No. 16 Denison, the Belles emerged from this weekend’s Manchester Tip-off Tourna­ment without a victory.  
Though they were playing in the tournament for the first time, the Belles (1-2) knew they would have their hands full, Belles coach Jenn Henley said.
On Friday night, tourna­ment host Manchester (2-1) defeated the Belles 66-54. After Baldwin-Wallace pre­vailed over Denison (2-1) on Friday, the Belles faced the Big Red in Saturday’s conso­lation match, but lost 81-74.  
The Belles entered the tournament with high hopes after knocking off No. 25 Wheaton in the season opener, but started out slow against Manchester, shoot­ing 30.4% from the field and suffering seven missed la­yups.  However, with four steals and a third of their 23 first half points coming at the free-throw line, the Belles kept the game close and went into halftime down by just three points.
Within five minutes of the second half, the Belles had turned the ball over five times, and Manchester es­tablished a 10-point lead.  After three consecutive jumpers by the Belles, the Spartans’ lead was reduced to five, but Saint Mary’s surge was not enough.  Soon Manchester’s lead was back to nine, and it never looked back.  
Saint Mary’s top scorers in the game were senior guard Patsy Mahoney with 15 points and senior forward Jessica Centa with 14 points. 
After the loss to Manches­ter, Saint Mary’s moved on to play Denison, who lost a close game to Baldwin-Wal­lace 54-53.  
With six lead changes, the game went back and forth be­tween the Belles and the Big Red. With 11 minutes left in the half, Denison’s lead reached 12.  The Belles never gave in, though, and with 18 seconds remaining they cut Denison’s lead to three points on a three-pointer from senior guard Mag­gie Ronan.
However, after a Belles’ foul, the Big Red connected on both free throws to secure the vic­tory.
Powered by three pointers . the Big Red made 12 of 16 shots from beyond the arc . Deni­son proved to be too much for Saint Mary’s to handle. Deni­son’s bench outscored the Saint Mary’s bench 48-4.  
Senior forward Kelley Mur­phy scored a game-high 23 points for the Belles. With 30 total points in the tournament, Centa was named to the all-tournament team.
In the upcoming weeks, the Belles look to recover from the tournament loss and prepare to play the last games of their nonconference schedule before moving onto MIAA play.
“I’m hoping that we are well-rested and mentally ready to get going as we head into Thanks­giving, getting ready for finals and things of that nature,” Hen­ley said.
The Belles will attempt to get back to .500 when they play An­derson at home Tuesday.

Both the Irish men’s and women’s teams will race for the national title in the NCAA cham­pionships on Monday at Indiana State in Terre Haute, Ind. They are both making at-large ap­pearances in 31-team fields. 
The championship meet fea­tures winners from each region­al meet, plus at-large teams. The men’s team earned an at-large invite to the meet after finishing fourth at the Great Lake Region­al. The men placed 25th at the 2010 NCAA championships, and all the runners from the men’s team will try to become Notre Dame’s first All-American run­ner since Patrick Smyth earned the honor in 2008.
Sophomore Martin Grady has paced the Irish this year, culmi­nating with an all-region per­formance. Junior Jeremy Rae and senior Jordan Carlson also earned all-region honors in the race.
Despite strong finishes from Carlson, Rae and Grady, the Irish placed just fourth in the regional meet.
“Individually, I want to finish in the top 80,” Rae said. “Team-wise, we would like to finish in the top 20.”
Seniors Kelly Lynch and Joe Miller, junior J.P. Malette and sophomores Walter Schafer and DJ Thornton look to join Carl­son, Rae and Grady.
“When it’s the last race, you tend to give in to the pain,” Rae said. “It’s going to be painful, but we need to fight through it.”
Notre Dame will face stiff competition in the toughest meet of its season.
“We’ve got to see a lot of good teams throughout the season,” Rae said. “We’ve faced some re­ally good teams in all our meets other than the National Catho­lic [championships]. We’ve had some good workouts in the past few weeks.”
Junior Jessica Rydberg led the team in every race she has par­ticipated in and was a major fac­tor in Notre Dame’s last NCAA championships race appearance in 2009, where the Irish came in 23rd place.
“We definitely want to finish in the top 20, maybe even in the top 15,” junior Rebecca Tracy said.
Notre Dame finished fifth last time out in the NCAA Regional meet, while Rydberg finished 10th, earning all-region honors. Freshman Gabby Gonzales also garnered all-region honors.
Tracy finished 34th in the con­test, crossing in 21:28. She has set her goals higher this season.
“I want to run as close to 21 minutes as possible,” Tracy said.
Seniors Molly Hirt and Rachel Velarde and sophomores Alexa Aragon, Kelly Curran and McK­inzie Schulz will also race at the meet.
“We’re trying to keep it to­gether as a pack,” Tracy said.
The Irish will meet many other ranked opponents at the meet. Compared to the field at the Notre Dame Invitational and the Wisconsin adidas Invitation­al, this field will also feature top competition. The Notre Dame Invitational featured six ranked women’s teams; the Wisconsin adidas Invitational featured 18.
“We faced some good competi­tion at the ND Invite and at Wis­consin,” Tracy said. “We learned a lot about how to start out and hopefully built some confidence along the way.”
The men’s 10-kilometer race begins at 12:08 p.m. on Satur­day, while the women’s six-kilo­meter race starts at 12:58 p.m. Both races will be held in Terre Haute, Ind.

champions in four sets. Notre Dame overcame 24 kills from Big East Player of the Year Lola Arslanbekova on the way to victory. Arslanbekova’s pro­duction came on 56 attempts as the Irish held her to a .268 hitting percentage thanks to the blocking efforts of Eppink, freshman Toni Alugbue and ju­nior Marie Roof.
Senior captain Kristen Dealy, also named to the all-tourna­ment team, notched 13 kills in the victory while sophomore Andrea McHugh posted 11. The sophomore duo of Sammie Brown and Maggie Brindock piloted the Irish attack, com­bining for 40 assists.
On Sunday, the Bearcats de­nied Notre Dame’s bid for its 10th Big East championship title with a straight set victory in a match de­cided by just a few points. On a day when the Irish could not seem to get over the hump, small runs by Cin­cinnati proved to be the dif­ference.
“We fought hard today, but we just couldn’t get a break when we absolutely needed it,” Brown said. “That’s the difference in the match.”
The loss makes the Irish a long shot for an NCAA tourna­ment bid, as Sunday’s match was likely the last for seniors Dealy and libero Frenchy Sil­va. The co-captains have been starters since they entered the program as freshmen in 2008 and have made their mark on a young team.
“It’s hard to overstate how impor­tant those two have been to our program through their years here,” Brown said, “So it was def­initely a bittersweet ending for them. They’ll really be missed.”

last-gasp heave down field. Despite losing, Spinelli said he was satisfied with how his team fought throughout the game.
“I’m really proud of our guys,” Spinelli said. “It’s a lot for a small dorm to get here and to play against the big boys … I’m just proud of our performance today.”
No. 3 Sorin started the scoring in the first quarter when junior running back and receiver Ryan Robin­son took a direct snap and powered his way into the end zone from one yard out. Robinson was primarily a receiver during the regular season, but had more op­portunities Sunday from the running back position, rush­ing for 47 yards.
“It’s something we had worked on a little bit last week,” Spinelli said. “We knew we needed to find a way to get [Robinson] the ball that wasn’t necessar­ily from throwing the ball to him. So that’s what the focus was, to get the ball into his hands.”
Dillon responded on its next drive with a 22-yard touchdown run from junior running back Terry How­ard. The score was set up by a fourth-and-one conversion by Howard from the Sorin 47-yard line and an 18-yard rush by Fink. The Big Red, howev­er, missed the extra point and trailed 7-6 heading into half­time.
But Dillon scored on its first drive of the second half when Fink found junior receiver Matt Enzweiler for a 65-yard touchdown strike.
“It was just another per­fect pass by Fink,” Salvi said. “On both of his touch­down passes he made per­fect throws …We didn’t pass that much in the first half, but then he played really well in the end.”
The Otters came back on their next drive with a strong rushing attack led by Robinson and Spinelli. Facing a fourth-and-five from the Dillon 49-yard line, Sorin went to the air. Feeling pressure from the out­side, Spinelli stepped up in the pocket and got off a pass just before being hit. The pass, al­though tipped by Dillon, found its way into the hands of Rob­inson, who took it 49 yards for the score. The extra point gave Sorin a 14-13 lead at the end of the third quarter.
Dillon turned it over on its next two possessions in the fourth quarter, but Sorin couldn’t capitalize on the mis­cues. The Otters missed a 23-yard field goal with just over three minutes left to play. 
The miss set up Dillon’s game-win­ning drive, which includ­ed a 20-yard completion from Fink to Salvi on fourth-and-10, kept the Big Red alive with a minute to play. The two connected again two plays later on the touch­down to give Dillon the win.
Having lost to the Otters in last year’s title game, the Big Red were thrilled to get revenge against Sorin, Salvi said. 
“The way that the revenge happened was, honestly, prob­ably the best way you can do it,” Salvi said. “In the final minute you get a touchdown, and then an [interception] at the end. That’s the best way you can do it.”

Though Saint Mary’s came up short at this weekend’s two-day Patrick Woehnker Invitational at Wabash College, Belles up­perclassmen won points for the team with strong individual per­formances and the team placed sixth out of seven.  
DePauw led the seven women’s contest with 634 points, far ahead of Saint Mary’s 168. 
The top 16 finishers in every event earned points for their team; the win­ner earned 20 points while each of the next 15 gained correspond­ingly fewer. The top eight teams in relay events scored points, start­ing with 40 points for a first place vic­tory.  
Although the Belles (1-3, 0-3 MIAA) trailed every squad except Rose-Hulman (1-1) in the points race, Belles coach Mark Benishek was pleased with many of the times his swimmers turned in.
“[Senior captain ] Audrey Dal­rymple had some strong swims in her events,” Benishek said. “Our distance swimmers, [junior] Liz Palmer and [senior captain] Me­gan Price, had a great meet. Both girls lead the team with person­al best times. Overall, it was a strong showing by the Belles.”
Dalrymple delivered the swim of the weekend for the Belles and earned 17 points for a sec­ond-place finish in the 100-yard breaststroke (1:10.29). Dalrym­ple also took fourth place in the 200-yard breaststroke (2:33.34) in between finishing seventh in the 200-yeard IM (2:20.95) and eighth in 400-yard IM (4:55.25). Her fellow teammate and se­nior captain Katie Donovan also scored in the 200-yard IM (2:23.87) for a 10th place fin­ish. 
Dalrymple and Donovan teamed up with Palmer and Price for the 800-yard free­style relay for fourth place (8:28.06).
Price and Palmer both placed in the 500-yard freestyle with personal records. Price fin­ished in 10th place (5:31.95) and Palmer brought in points for the Belles for 16th place (5:41.43). Price also picked up four points for Saint Mary’s with her swim in the 1650-yard freestyle (19:13.66), good for 13th place. She joined Dono­van, junior Kristyn Ger­beth and freshman Anna Nolan for the 200-yard freestyle relay team that finished fifth. 
Freshman Julianne Divine took the place of Donovan in the 200-yard medley, and the Belles finished seventh (2:02.16).
The Belles will have a quiet Thanksgiving Break before they resume competition in December.
“We will be resting the team for the Calvin Invite in two weeks,” Benishek said. “The team has been training hard for this meet, and their hard efforts will be shown at Cal­vin.”
The Belles return to ac­tion at the Calvin Invitational in Grand Rapids, Mich., from  Dec. 1-3.

MACKENZIE SAIN/The Observer
McGlinn senior receiver Kate Tucker reins in a pass over Cavanaugh senior defender Maggie Fahrenbach during the Shamrocks’ 13-6 win over the Chaos in the Women’s Interhall Championship on Sunday.

continued from page 16

Cavanaugh looked poised to turn the game around in the second half, as junior corner­back Rosemary Kelly inter­cepted Miller on the second play of the half. The Chaos had a first-and-goal, but were quickly stopped by the Sham­rock defense, which twice stymied the Chaos within the two-yard line to force a turn­over on downs.
“It was the most clutch play our team has had all year,” Miller said.
Despite the deflating goal-line stand, Cavanaugh man­aged to keep the game very close. The Chaos scored on their next possession, with Cink hit­ting senior receiver Megan Rob­ertson for a 10-yard touchdown pass.
McGlinn turned the ball over on downs on its next possession, giving Cavanaugh the ball with two minutes left on the clock at midfield. The Chaos, however, were not able to capitalize, as a long fourth-down pass from Cink to senior receiver Brittni Alexander fell incomplete, seal­ing the win and the champion­ship for the Shamrocks.
The loss was a difficult way to conclude Cavanaugh’s season, but Fahrenbach remained proud of her team’s effort.
“They were just able to throw the ball deep on us, since they had good receivers and a quar­terback who threw some beau­tiful passes,” Fahrenbach said. “But, I think we were able to bring it back in the second half, and we played our hearts out as best we could.”
For McGlinn, the game rep­resented a perfect conclusion to a great year, especially for the team’s seniors, who will leave Notre Dame with two interhall championships.
“We had the trophy in the hall three years ago, and we’re glad to finally have it back,” Miller said. “We’re really excited that the seniors get to go out on top and that the younger girls get to experience how much fun it can be to win in the Stadium.”

“We packed in the zone, and I thought it was pretty effective for the first four minutes of the second half,” she said. “They missed some shots and turned it over a little bit, and we kind of got back into gear a little bit bet­ter. But they found her pretty quickly after that four min­ute stretch.”
The Irish used the scoring run to pull within two, but the Bears quickly answered with a 10-1 run of their own to pull away from the Irish for good.
Adding to the difficulties presented by Griner, Baylor sophomore guard Odyssey Sims scored 25 points while notching six assists and six steals. Junior forward Des­tiny Williams had a double-double for the Bears with 15 points and 13 rebounds.
“I have to say that we came into the game expecting that [Griner] would score, but I was disappointed with the way we guarded the other players,” McGraw said. “I thought we struggled to con­tain the ball, we put them on the line way too much and we didn’t play the kind of defense that we hope to play this year.”
Senior guards Natalie No­vosel and Frederica Miller both fouled out for the Irish, who com­mitted 30 team fouls in the game. In the tour­nament’s first three rounds, the Notre Dame de­fense forced the opposi­tion into a Preseason WNIT re­cord 69 steals, but the Irish were able to secure only 9 steals against Baylor on Sunday. 
The Irish also came up short on the boards against Baylor and were outrebounded 37-52, a deficit that is especial­ly deflating for the Irish, junior guard Skylar Dig­gins said.
“Defen­sively, our number one goal was to board, but we didn’t,” she said. “We missed some box-out as­signments and things like that. We’ve got to stay disciplined.”
In a losing effort, Novosel led the Irish with a career high 28 points, while Diggins contributed 27 points, four re­bounds and three assists, but also turned the ball over seven times. The only other player to score in double figures for the Irish was sophomore guard Kayla McBride, who added 11 points to the cause.
For a team with champion­ship aspirations, the loss could pay dividends for the Irish in the long run, McGraw said.
“I think this was a good learning experience, and we have some great film to watch,” she said. “We can improve a lot. It’s great that it’s in Novem­ber and we can look ahead to what we want to be and know that we’re not there now.”

“It can’t get much better that this,” Rust said. “Down to the last second, in overtime, one just squeaks in with 1.1 sec­onds left. The game was a thrill ride the entire time.”
Before the game, the Comp­ton family, for whom the build­ing is named, dropped the puck during a ceremonial face-off. The Comptons were just a few of the donors in the arena for the Dedication Game.
Boston College (9-4-0, 7-2-0 Hockey East) struck first with 12.5 seconds left in the first pe­riod.
When a scrum in front of the net caused the puck to squirt into the crease, Irish sopho­more defenseman Stephen Johns jumped at a chance to cover the puck. The action was ruled illegal and Boston College was awarded a penalty shot.
“I could talk a lot about the officiating tonight but I don’t think I should,” Jackson said.
Eagles junior left wing Chris Kreider started right, then swerved left before beating Irish junior goaltender Mike Johnson over his right pad.
The penalty shot was the first one Notre Dame (9-2-2, 6-1-2 CCHA) allowed since Dec. 4, 2009, against Miami (Ohio).
The Irish evened the score at 6:54 in the second period when Tynan whipped a wrist shot from the top of the left face-off circle past Milner. The goal set off a frenzy in the full-capacity crowd of 5,022 that immedi­ately began tossing glow-sticks onto the ice.
“Anders, Tynan [and junior center] Riley Sheahan played an exceptional game. [Senior center] Billy Maday played well,” Jackson said. “We had a lot of guys that played really, really well. There were a lot of positives and a lot of guys el­evated their game.”
Notre Dame took a 2-1 lead with a play originating from the defensive zone. Freshman right wing Austin Wuthrich led the Irish into the neutral zone before finding Sheahan with a cross-ice pass. Sheahan cen­tered the puck to sophomore defenseman Shayne Taker, who finished the play with a back­hand flip for the score.
The goal was Taker’s second in as many games for Notre Dame.
“He’s getting some confi­dence,” Jackson said of Taker. “We were hoping for that. He’s shown a lot of poise with the puck and a lot of confidence, which is great.”
The Irish kept up the pres­sure in the third period, firing the first eight shots on goal in the final frame. Notre Dame finished with 35 shots, while Boston College amassed 34 shots. Johnson finished with 32 saves on the night.
“Mike is not intimidated by anything,” Jackson said. “When he thinks too much is when he has problems. He was focused.”
With just 2:10 left in the third period, Boston College knotted the game on a goal from fresh­man left wing Johnny Gaud­reau. Johnson stopped an ini­tial Boston College shot, but the rebound skidded to the right. Gaudreau was there to bang home the game-tying goal.
The final two minutes went by goalless, and the game went  into overtime.
The Irish are now unbeaten in their last nine games and hold the top position in the CCHA standings.
“We still have a long ways to go before I think we’re capable of being the type of team we can be,” Jackson said. “We need to get some secondary scoring on our team.”
The Irish earned the Lefty Smith-John “Snooks” Kelley Memorial Trophy for the sec­ond year in a row and the sixth time in the last eight meetings.
“They played with a lot of passion,” Jackson said. “They played well. That’s certainly as good a team we’ve seen this year, no question.”
The game marked Notre Dame’s fourth overtime contest in its past six games.
“We’re getting to be too good at it, which is not good for my health,” Jackson said of the overtime games.
Notre Dame returns to action when it heads to Kalamazoo, Mich., for a rematch with CCHA foe Western Michigan.

Irish senior guard Natalie Novosel controls the ball in Notre Dame’s 98-43 victory over Hartford in the Preseason WNIT semifinals Thursday.

Irish capture victory in final game of Abromaitis’ suspension

By ERIC PRISTER
Sports Writer
Irish coach Mike Brey said he was worried about getting through the first four games without his top returning scorer.
But in their final contest without fifth-year forward Tim Abromaitis, the Irish had four players reach double-figures on their way to a 93-69 win over Delaware State on Friday.
In addition to Abromaitis, Notre Dame also played without sophomore guard Eric Atkins and junior guard Joey Brooks due to illness, and was left with just seven active scholarship players.
 “I’m happy that we got through and we’re 4-0 without [Abromaitis],” Brey said. “I did not expect that we were going to lose a couple other bodies too. I hope it’s a blessing in disguise . I think it will be because some other guys have had to play long minutes, and we found out about them and they made plays. I think it can help us in the fu­ture. I hope that future is Mon­day night.”
Senior guard Scott Martin re­corded a career-high 23 points and added five rebounds to lead the Irish. He said that with Abromaitis out, different play­ers have had to score for Notre Dame.
“[It’s going to be] a relief [to have Abro­maitis back],” Martin said. “It’s been a little stressful. We’ve been a little worried where produc­tion was going to come from, so thankfully we had different guys stepping up on different nights. With [Abromaitis] back, it gives us different options offensively and defensively.”
Junior forward Jack Cooley recorded his first career double-double with 11 points and a ca­reer-high 17 rebounds, includ­ing 10 on the offensive end.
“That’s phenomenal,” Cooley said. “Seventeen . that’s a ton. I didn’t honestly keep track of it for a while until [assistant coach Martin] Inglesby told me, ‘You have 14,’ and I was like, ‘14 what?’ And he was like, ‘Rebounds,’ and I was like, ‘Oh, snap, I should get on that.’ He told me I should get 20, and I was like, ‘I got this.’ I got caught a lit­tle short, but 17 isn’t bad.”
Sophomore guard Alex Dragicevich and junior forward Mike Broghammer also tossed in career highs with 18 and nine points, respectively, and sophomore guard Jerian Grant matched his previous best with 17. Freshman guard Pat Con­naughton made his first career start, scoring nine points to go along with seven rebounds in the victory.
“[We learned] about every­body, except maybe the veteran guys, especially Dragicevich, Grant, Connaugton, Brooks,” Brey said. “During this stretch, I think those four guys really gave us good stuff and they’re all going to be part of the dance. I think Broghammer, tonight, he was moving the best he’s moved in a while, and we’re going to need his physicality.”
Abromaitis’ return will likely not be an easy one, Brey said. The Irish will take on No. 25 Missouri in the semifinals of the CBE Classic in Kansas City, Mo., on Monday.
“We’ve got a heck of a chal­lenge Monday,” he said. “They’re really good, really fast. We’ve got to change some tempo on them — ­­we can’t run around with them all 40 minutes. I knew we were going to play dif­ferent guys without [Abromai­tis]. I didn’t know it was going to be this much musical chairs. It’s paid off, and different guys have had to make plays, and we’ve still found ways to score the ball, which has been interesting to me. Again, it’s all good stuff, but I’m done with basketball camp, where everybody plays equal minutes. I want to get my nucleus back.”
Martin said it will be nice to have Abromaitis back, but the offense will not change upon his return.
“[The offense] doesn’t change at all,” he said. “The great thing about this system is everyone can step in and fill a role. We run the same things, we have smart players top to bottom, so guys are able to just step in and keep things rolling. [Abromaitis] is probably the smartest of all of us, so he’ll step in and keep it go­ing.”
But one thing is definite: When the Irish take the court Monday night against Missouri at 7:30 p.m., Abromaitis will be on the floor with his teammates.
“The leg irons come off, baby,” Brey said. “He is free at last.”

McGlinn captures title with 13-6 win over Chaos


By MATTHEW DEFRANKS
Sports Writer
Towels waved. Glow-sticks flew. Foghorns blasted. Donors attended. Compton rocked.
And the Irish won.
No. 4 Notre Dame beat No. 3 Boston College 3-2 in overtime behind sophomore right wing Bryan Rust’s overtime goal with just 1.1 seconds remaining during the dedication game for the Compton Family Ice Arena.
“I’m grateful that we won with so many instrumental people in the building watch­ing us play,” Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. “We wouldn’t be in this building if it wasn’t for a lot of those people. Tonight was what we hoped this build­ing would be. The band and the students were pretty incred­ible.”
Rust led a three-on-two odd-man rush flanked by sopho­more left wing Anders Lee and sophomore center T.J. Tynan. Rust took an open wrist shot that hit Boston College junior goaltender Parker Milner be­fore sliding into the net for the game-winner. The entire Notre Dame squad rushed the ice and celebrated in the corner while the crowd released a deafening cheer.
“I was flying through the neu­tral zone, went up the left wing. I knew there wasn’t much time, cut to the middle, put my head down and just ripped one,” Rust said. “I got lucky and it found its way to trickle into the net.”
The goal was Rust’s second of the season.

In a matchup of high-powered offensives, defense proved to be the deciding fac­tor as No. 6 McGlinn’s defense slowed No. 1 Cavanaugh’s passing attack to claim the women’s interhall champion­ship, 13-6. 
Cavanaugh (8-1) received the ball first and looked to utilize its strong passing set, but a series of incompletions and untimely penalties forced a three-and-out.
McGlinn (7-2) started with good field position and used a series of strong runs and short passes by senior cap­tain and quarterback Lauren Miller to move quickly down the field. Miller, narrowly evading pressure from Cava­naugh’s defensive line, then connected with senior receiv­er Kate Tucker on a 12-yard touchdown pass to give the Shamrocks a 7-0 lead they would never relinquish.
After stopping Cavanaugh deep in Chaos territory, McG­linn again utilized field posi­tion to its advantage. The Sham­rocks needed only two plays to move 46 yards to the end zone, as Miller completed a 29-yard pass before she found Tucker again in the left corner of the end zone for a 17-yard touchdown pass.
“I just put the ball where I thought Kate was going to be, but Kate was really the one who worked for both of those touch­downs,” Miller said. “She got up there and made both of those clutch plays, [even] though she was double-covered on both plays.”
Cavanaugh looked to strike for a quick touchdown to end the half, but McGlinn junior safety Caitlin Day intercepted Chaos senior quarterback Rebecca Cink’s pass to keep Cavanaugh scoreless at the half.
“I think it was hard for us to get behind early, especially when they had a really good quarterback,” Cavanaugh senior captain and defensive back Mag­gie Fahrenbach said. “Starting off rocky in the first half defi­nitely put more pressure on our offense.”

Dillon defeats Sorin 19-14 in title game

Irish fall to No. 1 team in final

By JOSEPH MONARDO
Sports Writer
After advancing easily into the final round of the Pre­season WNIT, outscoring their opponents by a combined 140 points in three games, the Irish came up short against Baylor 94-81 in Sunday’s champion­ship game.
No. 2 Notre Dame (3-1) uti­lized a stifling defense to lead the charge through the first three rounds of the tourna­ment, but was unable to find an answer for No.1 Baylor (3-1) in the title game. Junior center Brittney Griner led the Bears by racking up 32 points on 14-18 shooting from the field, while grabbing 14 rebounds and re­cording five blocks for her third double-double of the year. 
“We expected coming in that she was going to be able to have her way inside, and we tried a couple of different looks on her, but it didn’t really matter,” Irish coach Muffett McGraw said. “She shot the ball ex­tremely well. She’s an incred­ibly talented young lady.”
In their first away game of the year, the Irish jumped ahead in the early minutes and were able to stay with the Bears for a large part of the first half, trailing 18-19 with just under 10 minutes remaining in the opening stanza. However, Bay­lor used an 11-2 run to open up a sizeable lead that it would maintain until halftime, when the Bears held a 47-36 lead. 
The Irish opened the second half with a 15-6 run during which they had success defend­ing Griner, McGraw said.

Another interhall champi­onship game between Sorin and Dillon. Another close finish at Notre Dame Sta­dium. But this time, Dillon finished on top, 19-14. 
Trailing 14-13 with 41 sec­onds left in the fourth quar­ter, Dillon junior receiver Will Salvi hauled in a 32-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarterback Kevin Fink to set the score at 19-14. The play, though, wasn’t exactly how No.5 Dil­lon (6-1) drew it up.
“I was not going to run that route,” Salvi said. “Then I looked at [Fink] beforehand and told him I was going to run a [slant-and-go] instead of a hitch. It was a nice little au­dible, and we got it done. It was perfect.”
The touchdown, which capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive, turned out to be the game-winner after Dillon freshman defensive back Ted Williams intercepted Sorin ju­nior quarterback Ted Spinelli’s

Notre Dame nearly became the lowest-seeded team in Big East history to win the con­ference tournament over the weekend.
In a rematch of the regular season finale, the fifth-seeded Irish dispatched fourth-seeded Syracuse 3-1 (27-25, 25-17, 21-25, 25-19) before upsetting top-seeded Louisville (25-22, 22-25, 25-21, 25-19) in the semifinals. Notre Dame’s run came to an end in the final contest of the tournament, as the Irish fell to a determined Cincinnati squad 3-0 (25-22, 25-21, 27-25). 
“I thought it was a great showing for the team,” Irish coach Debbie Brown said. “Ob­viously we’re disappointed not to have won, but I’m proud of how we stepped up.”
On Friday at Marquette’s AL Maguire Center, the Irish avenged their defeat to the Orangemen a week before, a match in which Syracuse need­ed a win to clinch a berth to the Big East tournament. This time, the Irish were the ones desper­ate not to stop the program’s streak of 17 straight first-round Big East tournament victories, and that showed on the court.  
Freshman Jeni Houser, who was named to the Big East all-tournament team, paced the Irish with 17 kills, slugging at a prodigious .533 rate. Junior Hilary Eppink contributed 12 kills and an efficient .429 hit­ting percentage.
“Houser has really come into her own as a hitter,” Brown said. “She just hits the ball so hard. I think she’s matured a lot over the season. There’s a learning curve that comes with being a freshman.”
The Irish again reversed their regular season result against the top-ranked Cardi­nals on Saturday, defeating the Big East regular-season

Senior Day slugfest

Notre Dame grinds out 16-14 victory over Boston College to earn eighth win of 2011

By CORY BERNARD
Sports Writer
On an emotional night for its seniors, Notre Dame gutted out a close 16-14 victory over deter­mined underdog Boston College, utilizing staunch defense and three field goals from fifth-year kicker David Ruffer.
Irish coach Brian Kelly said he was pleased to see his team emerge victorious in a hard-fought game.
“It’s a pretty happy locker room, a great win for us,” he said. “The kids persevered and played hard for four quarters. We asked them to play hard for four quarters and they did that tonight — just a satisfying win as a football coach to see your team battle. We’ve overcome a lot of things, and it’s just a re­ally nice victory for our football team today.”
Junior running back Cierre Wood led the Irish rushing at­tack with 98 yards on 26 carries, as Notre Dame (8-3) outrushed the Eagles with 161 rushing yards to Boston College’s 80. The Irish outgained the Eagles by a total count of 417 yards to 250.
Wood’s total pushes his rush­ing mark to 1,001 yards on the season, Notre Dame’s first 1000-yard rusher since Darius Walker in 2006. Senior receiver Michael Floyd snared 10 catches for 92 yards to pace the aerial assault and went over 1,000 yards re­ceiving for the second straight season.
The Irish did not leave the contest unscathed, however. Se­nior running back Jonas Gray appeared to seriously injure his knee in the third quarter. Kel­ly confirmed Sunday the in­jury will likely end Gray’s Notre Dame career.
“It’s pretty apparent he’s got a signifi­cant knee in­jury,” Kelly said.
After the game, Kelly said the senior addressed his emotional team­mates.
“He talked to the team af­ter,” Kelly said of Gray. “He’s a great young man, you know, it’s just — it’s emotional when you don’t know if you’re going to be able to play your last game or not. It’s still uncertain until he gets more medical information. There are a lot of emotions in that locker room.”
Sophomore quarterback Tom­my Rees echoed Kelly’s senti­ment.
“[Jonas Gray] and I have been close a long time, and I just thanked him for everything he’s helped me with,” Rees said. “To be honest, I probably wouldn’t be in a posi­tion I am in if it wasn’t for him, so he helped me out a lot. I feel bad for a guy when he gets banged up like that, so my best to­ward him.”
Gray scored Notre Dame’s lone touch­down of the day with a 26-yard scamper that capped an eight-play, 80-yard drive to open the game. Kelly attributed his offense’s strug­gles after the opening drive to a number of factors, adding that the close score didn’t surprise him.
“Give credit to Boston College, now, they played well today,” Kelly said. “Coming in 3-7, this was their ballgame and they played hard, and Coach Spa­ziani had his kids playing hard, but the field position was diffi­cult to manage, and the weath­er. The weather conditions were hard and blustery, so we had to manage. We knew what kind of game this was going to end up being, and it certainly turned out that way.”
After jumping to a 10-0 lead after their first two drives, the Irish offense stalled, resulting in three straight punts. With three minutes remaining in the half, Boston College finally scratched its way onto the scoreboard. Redshirt freshman quarterback Josh Bordner ran into the end zone from two yards out to cap a nine-play, 80-yard drive.
With the Eagles within three points, Notre Dame marched into Boston College territory on its last drive of the half. Howev­er, Rees tossed a pair of incom­pletions and Ruffer entered for his second field goal of the game, making the halftime score 13-7.
Kelly praised Ruffer’s abil­ity to overcome an early-season slump and once again play well.
“His perseverance, sticking with it,” Kelly said. “[Fresh­man kicker] Kyle [Brindza] is going through that same men­tal wall, if you will, of breaking through. David stuck with it, broke through it, and he’s been obviously great the last month.”
In the second half, Notre Dame’s offense again struggled, leading to three punts and a turnover in the third quarter. The turnover, an interception by Boston College junior defensive end Max Holloway, put the Ea­gles in Irish territory with 5:25 left in the third quarter. Howev­er, Notre Dame’s defense forced a three-and-out, one of six such drives for Boston College on the day.
Kelly said his team dealt with adversity throughout the week, having to practice without sev­eral key players. He said despite the setbacks, the defense played well.
“The defense played very, very stout today and found a way to win,” Kelly said. “We had Har­rison Smith in the infirmary last night, getting [intravenous fluids.] We had Zack Martin out. Stephon Tuitt couldn’t play because of illness. R.J. Blanton didn’t practice for two days be­cause of illness, and I didn’t give you all the injuries ... My point is this: those kids stepped up in November and with a lot of guys out, found a way to win.”
Though they allowed a 72-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter to cut their lead to 16-14, the Irish easily covered the ensuing onside kick attempt with 1:57 remaining to all but eliminate the Eagles’ chances.
Though still a sophomore, Rees said he can appreciate a senior-day victory.
“It means everything,” he said. “It’s great. You can’t give a senior anything better than a win. I’ll be in that position one day, and I would want to go out on a win, and two years in a row now where we put together a win for them — you see the guys get emotional. It really shows how special Notre Dame is and how much it means to all of our guys.”
Floyd said the significance of competing in his final home game had not yet registered.
“It feels great,” he said. “I don’t think the emotions will hit until you leave this place. I don’t really feel that emotional right now, but I guarantee once you leave this university it’s all go­ing to hit you.”

quarterbacks: Tommy Rees played worse than his stat line indicates, as his receivers bailed him out often. Rees’ de­cisionmaking is still suspect, as shown on his third-quarter interception.

C

running backs: Cierre Wood was es­pecially effective in helping the Irish control the clock and prevent an Eagle comeback. Notre Dame will sorely miss Jonas Gray in the backfield.

B+

receivers: Robby Toma played well again, but the receivers struggled to get open for Rees. Even worse, effort was sometimes lacking, as rarely did receiv­ers extend their routes. 

B-

offensive line: Wood and Gray had room to run, but the Irish did occasionally have problems protecting Rees. Still, this unit has been a pleasant surprise during the 2011 season.

B+

defensive line: Stephon Tuitt’s absence hurt the Irish, who struggled to pres­sure Boston College. To be fair, Aaron Lynch’s blocker held him on nearly ev­ery play and was never called for it.

B

linebackers: Manti Te’o had a stellar 12-tackle performance, and Jamoris Slaughter played exceptionally well at linebacker. Notre Dame did struggle to cover outlet passes, however.

A-

defensive backs: It was a fairly medio­cre effort for the secondary. While the Eagles didn’t complete a lot of passes, their second touchdown drive was all too easy at that point in the game.

special teams: David Ruffer and Ben Turk played really well, and this grade isn’t fair to them. But the punt-return unit is simply terrible, and this grade is way too nice to them.

Stanford is this season’s measuring stick

coaching: It wasn’t pretty, and the of­fensive playcalling was highly suspect, but give Kelly and his staff credit for winning a game that would have been a loss just two years ago.

After surviving a light three-game stretch of ACC opponents in November, it all comes down to Saturday for Notre Dame.
When the lights go out in Palo Alto, Calif., the regular season will be over and we will know if the Irish were able to salvage the 2011 season.
The game is virtually meaning­less for Notre Dame in terms of bowl slot­ting — win or lose, the Champs Sports Bowl is the likely destina­tion. But it means so much more than that when you look at the big picture.
If the Irish fall to No. 4 Stan­ford, no one will be surprised, but it will be a disappointing finish for a team unable to shake the thunderclouds that hovered above Notre Dame Stadium in the loss against South Florida.
Currently standing at 8-3, it simply has been a disappoint­ing season for Notre Dame. Irish coach Brian Kelly made it quite clear during fall practice that a Bowl Championship Series berth would be the indicator of a whether or not 2011 was suc­cessful.
With the exception of the 31-13 victory over Michigan State on Sept. 17, Notre Dame’s 11 games can be placed in three categories. The blowout wins in which the Irish did exactly what was expected of them (Purdue, Air Force, Navy and Maryland), games they gutted out a win against an inferior opponent (Pittsburgh, Wake Forest and Boston College) and flat-out disappointments (South Florida, Michigan and USC).
“We’ve overcome a lot of things, and just a really nice vic­tory for our football team today,” Kelly said after Notre Dame’s 16-14 win over Boston College, the eighth win in nine games and the 12th in 15 games for the Irish.
But really, Notre Dame has not needed to overcome many “things” — rather, it has needed to overcome itself, with 10 turn­overs in the first two games, the second of which was a colossal fourth-quarter collapse at Michi­gan, and a mind-bogglingly flat performance against USC.
The combined record of teams Notre Dame has beaten is 39-47. Take out Michigan State, and it’s 30-45. It’s hard to find any adversity that has not been self-induced.
But, as unpredictable as the 2011 Irish have been, the his­torical narrative of this season can still have a positive spin on it with a win at Stanford.
Thanks to the losses of Okla­homa State, Oregon and Okla­homa, the Cardinal once again have a path to the national championship game. If they beat the Irish on Saturday, the SEC West logjam could take care of itself and Stanford would make the championship game, which gives Notre Dame an incredible opportunity this weekend.
Beat Stanford, finish the regular season 9-3 with wins over two top-10 teams (Michigan State and Stanford), and sudden­ly it’s a potential 10-win season. Not bad at all, especially when you consider it is only year two of a completely new system. Kel­ly proved last season how critical end-of-year momentum is when it comes to recruiting. (With­out a 4-0 finish, Aaron Lynch, Stephon Tuitt and Ishaq Wil­liams might be at Florida State, Georgia Tech and Penn State, respectively.) The outlook would also be very bright heading into a 2012 season that features the most daunting schedule in recent memory.
The end of the 2011 volume of Notre Dame football is quickly approaching, but the final chap­ter has yet to play out.

When Boston College senior punter Ryan Quigley pinned Notre Dame at its own five-yard line in the first quarter, it was an excep­tional kick. When Quigley made the Irish start at their own three-yard line on his next punt, it was a trend. After Notre Dame started its fifth drive inside its own 10-yard line, it had become standard.
“The field position was difficult to manage, and the weather. The weather conditions were hard and blustery, so we had to manage,” Irish coach Brian Kelly said. “We knew what kind of game this was going to end up being, and it cer­tainly turned out that way.”
Notre Dame, however, overcame the bad field position with strong defense in its 16-14 win over Bos­ton College on Saturday.
In Notre Dame’s first 13 drives, not counting the last drive after Boston College’s onside kick, its average starting field position was at the 19-yard line. The three final Irish drives each set new game-high marks for starting field po­sition — first at the 35-yard line, next at the 39-yard line and then, after the onside kick, at the Eagle 48-yard line.
“It was a battle all day,” senior linebacker Darius Fleming said. “Those are the games you like to play in. You like to play when you have to stay on your toes. You can’t go out there and slack off at all be­cause it can cost you the game.”
Conversely, the Eagles started just two drives inside their own 20-yard line. On average, Boston College (3-8, 2-5 ACC) started at its 30-yard line.
“Those are situations we prac­tice for every day,” Fleming said of the field position. “Those are things the defense is aware of and we’re prepared for those kinds of situations.”
The defense responded in a big way, holding the Eagles to 250 to­tal yards of offense, with just 80 yards coming on the ground.
“Everybody was getting to the ball,” junior linebacker Manti Te’o said. “Everybody was trying to make a big play. Everybody was do­ing their assignment. That’s what makes good defense. Everybody is one-eleventh of the defense.”
Notre Dame (8-3) held Boston College sophomore quarterback Chase Rettig without a completion for 10 straight attempts during the second half.
“We missed a couple, they put some pressure on us and the com­bination of those, we got ourselves off rhythm,” Eagles coach Frank Spaziani said.
The Irish allowed two touch­down drives longer than 70 yards, but also forced the Eagles into six three-and-out series.
“We did a good job playing as­signment football, stopping the run, keeping big plays off the stat sheet,” graduate student safety Harrison Smith said. “There were definitely plays we wanted back, especially on those two drives. Overall, we did a good job.”
Despite forcing nine Boston Col­lege punts, Notre Dame was un­able to muster any punt return yards, registering six fair catches on the day.
Although the Irish racked up an impressive 417 total yards, they did not have a drive longer than 55 yards after opening the game with an 80-yard scoring drive.
“You can’t get frustrated, be­cause we didn’t get ourselves out of that position,” sophomore quar­terback Tommy Rees said. “If we would have moved the ball down the field then, you don’t leave it where they are punting and have a chance to put you inside the ten. Obviously it’s not the most ideal situation, but we could have done some things to help ourselves out.”
Notre Dame punted eight times on the day, including five in their seven second-half possessions.
Junior punter Ben Turk aver­aged 44 yards per punt, including a long of 55 yards.
“I think he did really well,” Irish coach Brian Kelly said of Turk. “As you know, the kind of game it was, I think he had eight punts, they had nine. College football has all these things, and it’s not al­ways about up and down the field. Sometimes you got to block and tackle and grind it out and find a way to win. I just like the way our guys now understand how to win games.”

RB Wood earns 1,000-yard season

By MATTHEW DEFRANKS
Sports Writer
Irish junior running back Cierre Wood eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark for rushing with a two-yard plunge late in the fourth quarter Saturday. Wood became Notre Dame’s 16th back to achieve the feat and the first since Darius Walker in 2006.
Wood and senior running back Jo­nas Gray were trying to become the first duo in Notre Dame history to each rush for 1,000 yards. Gray left the game with a serious knee injury 209 yards short of the mark.
“We won’t have the MRI results, but it’s pretty apparent that he has a significant knee injury,” Irish coach Brian Kelly said Sunday. “The MRI would probably confirm what we know as to be, as I mentioned, a sig­nificant knee injury.”
Ruffer on hot streak
After starting the season 2-for-6, Irish graduate student kicker David Ruffer has hit on eight straight kicks. Ruffer nailed three attempts Satur­day, including the eventual game-winning 27-yarder with 8:08 left in the fourth quarter. Ruffer also had to deal with a 20 mile per hour wind.
“We made it a game plan to aim down the middle and smoke it,” Ruffer said. “You start playing games with the wind and you’re usually go­ing to lose.”
Kuechly sets record
Boston College junior linebacker Luke Kuechly entered Saturday’s game needing just seven tackles to claim the ACC’s all-time tackles re­cord.
 Kuechly earned the mark when he tackled senior receiver Michael Floyd early in the second quarter.
“I think he’s the best football player in the country,” Eagles coach Frank Spaziani said. “Week in, week out, play in, play out, he shows up. I know he’s up for a lot of awards, and I think he’s deserving of all of them. I think he should get them.”

Grounding the Eagles

After introducing 38 seniors and their families at Notre Dame Stadium as part of Senior Day festivities, the Irish got off to a hot start, scoring a touchdown on their opening possession. From that point forward, however, it was up to the defense to carry Notre Dame past Boston College, who regularly put the Irish in terrible field position and held the offense to field goals instead of touchdowns. Despite a shaky offensive performance and a late comeback attempt by the Eagles, Notre Dame pulled out a victory in the seniors’ last home game. The Irish travel to face No. 6 Stanford in the regular season finale Saturday.
