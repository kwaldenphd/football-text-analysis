:floundering campaigns 

.Kennedy, Bush seek revival 
(AP)-Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy feverishly courted 
New York while Texas Yankee 
George Bush sought revival in 
his childhood Connecticut yes­
terday on the eve of primaries 
which threatened to shred their 
once-impeccable credentials as 
serious presidential conten­
ders. 
Despite his claim that New 
York--where a whopping 282 
Democratic convention dele­
gates were at stake--would put 
his withering challenge to 
President Carter back on track, 
the latest polls indicated that 
Kennedy would reap only ruin 
from the Empire State. 
The New York Dailv News said that while Kennedy ran about even among the state's Jewish voters--about one-third ·of the total--he still trailed the president by 20 points, or 56 to 36. 
At least two Kennedy aides were .erepared to tell him to quit tf he loses New York badly. But Kennedy said he wouldn't do that, since he was ''chemically and viscerally'' suited to nothing less than a fight to the end. 
On the Repub!ican side, front-runner Ronald Reagan was already a winner in New York, where the GOP contest effectively boiled dov.rn to a choice between his slates of delegates and those who were uncommitted. There was no preferential vote in the GOP ballotting, in which a total of 123 delegates were allocat­ed. 
Reagan had nine delegates already, since they were un­contested. Bush had 6 uncon­tested delegates, but was head-ro~head against Reagan for only 31 more in 11 of the

Democratic Party 'gag' tape causesofficialsembarassment 
WASHINGTON (AP)-If the Republicans needed any help in lampooning Presidenr Car­ter, they could have gotten · it last weekend from none other than Democratic Party head­quaners. 
Callers who dialed a cenain telephone number at the Democratic National Commit­tee heard a recorded spoof of the president, complete with background banjo music, taped excerpts from Carter speeches and at least one raw expletive from a country-rock star at a Carter concen. 
Embarrassed Democrats said the message, entitled ''Quest for the Presidency 1976, " was all a terrible mistake. 
It was a party tape, they said, and was beang used in a live test of telephone equip­ment for a dial-in message service at the Democratic Na­tional Convention in New York next August. 
When party officials dis­covered yesterday that people had learned of the gag tape and were dialing the number at Democratic headquarters to lis­ten to it, the tape was quickly yanked. 
"We were just testing out the equipment,'' pleaded Bob Hirschfeld, chief of broadcast services for the committee's news department. "We 
' .
weren t expectmg anyone to call during that time. That number has been out of service for at least a year and a half. " 
Hirschfeld said he erased the entire three-minute tape. "It will never be on agaan,'' he said. 
On the tape, heard by re­porters before it was ·removed from the tJlayback machine, a serious-votced narrator said Carter obtained "seed money" to start his 1976 presidential campaign by-signing on as a donor for the ''Atlanta Sperm Bank."

ConcerningIran 

U.S.warns against retaliation 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 
f:
United States warned Iran sterday against· punishing e American hostages held in 
ehran as retaliation for the 
eparture of the deposed shah from Panama. 

Insisting that the decision of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to leave Panama for Egypt was made by the former monarch alone, Carter administration of­ficials also tried to cool tempers in Tehran by offering to improve relations once the 41/z-month-old hostage crisis ends. 
The officials said the Soviets pose a common danger co U.S. and Iranian interests in the Persian Gulf and reaffirmed an offer to discuss American aid after the 50 American hostages are liberated. 
The shah's sudden departure from Panama on Sunday upset ''the hell out of people'' in 
Tehran, a senior administration official acknowledged. And yet he dismissed a threat by Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkahi, an · Iranian prosecutor, to put the Americans on trial and then jail them. The official said this 
was "not a very possible or 
probable outcome. '' 

Even so, the administration 
issued a warning through State 
Department spokesman Hod­
ding Carter that ''the Iranian 
government is aware of the 
consequences and condemna­
tion that would take place" if 
the hostages were tried. 

A White House official, who asked that he not be identified, indicated the administration does not attach "the same degree of concern'' to the trial threat that it did when Iranian officials earlier suggested the Americans could be placed be­fore courts. 
''The concern we would feel has not changed," this official said, "but our assessment of the problem is certainly less than it was before. ' ' 
For the most part, officials within the administration in­dicated they felt the ultimate fate of the American hostages would not be affected by the shah's move ~o Egypt. He left Panama after two presidential advisers, Hamilton ) ordan and Lloyd Cutler, held quiet nego­tiations with those in his entourage. 
The Iranian government had

submit documents requesting his extradition for alleged mass murder and corruption during his three decades as Iranian monarch. . 
U.S. officials said medical reasons led the shah to accept Sadat's long-standing invitation to reside in Egypt. The shah's doctor's say he requires sur­gery to remove an enlarged and

JETMORE, Kan. (AP) More than 100 travelers huddled in this small southwestern Kansas town yesterday after spending the night on pews behind the pulpit when they were stranded by one of the worst blizzards in the state this century. 
The 135 unexpected over­night guests at the United Presbyterian Church, including a baseball team from a Colora­do junior college. were amoung thousands who took refuge from the snowstrom across the state at motels, National Guard armories and evena city jail. 
The storm also left up to a foot of snow in the Oklahoma panhandle, where rescue crews freed dozens of people stranded in snowbound vehicles Sunday night. "The area is paralyzed," said Phil Shideler of the National Weather Service in Topeka. Winds up to 45 mph accompan­nied the fast moving strorm and reduced visibility to near zero in some spots. 
''You could write a novel about this," said the Rev. Stan Adamson of the church in Jetmore, which has a popula­tion of about 1 ,000. He des­cribed how two mothers and their children were seperated from other families in their party when their car made it to 
] etmore,  but  two  other  cars  
became  marooned  nonh  of  
town.  
''They  were  really  worried  

because there were children in the other cars. The mothers were here from 6 o'clock until about 9:30 and the sheriff came in carrying the kids. It was quite a poignant reunion. There were a lot of tears and kisses.'' 
The 22-member baseball team from Trinidad State Ju­nior Colle~e was also stranaed overnight 1n the church. ''The baseball team even found a bunch of teen-age girls, and they played cards most of the night. Playing cards in the church,'' Adamson said laugh­ing.· "Fortunately, we're Uni­ted Presbyterians, and we don't mind that."

"What is happening is not a generalized inflation. It is not a wage-price inflation, but a price-wage inflation," Alpero­vitz said. Typical inflation is a 
result of wages driving PP prices, while at this time, prices are driving up wages. Alpero­vitz analyzed the cause of price hikes and concluded that super-inflation in the four basic necessities was the largest fac­

centration on tighter budget­ing, one of the four thrusts of Carter's plan, closes down on house development, rather than opening up the field, Alperovitz said. The solution to the hous­ing problem will come by 
planning housing on the nation­al and local levels. The plan­ning does nor mean concentra­tion on construction, but on all aspects, including credit control and tax incentive, he conclud­ed. 
In the health sector, Alpero­vitz sees third panies as the 
reason for medical costs piling up. Alperovitz suggested a 
solution would be to look into a, national h~atth care pro­gram.

Oilin Gulf 
Explosion sears offshore site 
GALVESTON, Texas (AP) ­
An explosion and fire seared 
an offshore drilling platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico early 
yesterday, killing two men, 
mjuring 29, and leaving four 
persons missing, officials said. 
The rig, drilling a gas well 
about 100 miles off the upper 
Texas coast, erupted mto . flames in the pre-dawn hours, sending men in the crew of 41 scurrying for safety. Only six escaped mjury. 
The Coast Guard in Galves­
ton said a fixed wing aircraft, a 
helicopter and the cutter Pont 
M.o"!'oe were searching for the 
mtsstng crewmen, who were 
said to have been in the 
vicinity of the explosion. 
Wild well fighter Red Adair put a crew on a nearby rig to assess the damage and deter­mine how best to put out the. raging fire. 
The cause ctf the explosion was under investigation. 
The survivors were taken by boat to another rig five miles away to await medical person­nel airlifted from the coast. 
Helicopters ferried them to John Sealy Hospital in Galves­ton. All 29 injured, many on stretchers, had arrived by 
noon, said Sealy spokesman 
Miles Kanape. 
.Fourteen were treated and 
released Kanape said, and 
others were admitted or held 
for observation. The injuries 
ranged from burns to ''mul­
tiple trauma'' involving frac­
tures, abrasions and cuts, he 
said . 
A medical corpsman who had flown to the scene told some reporters that many men were injured when they donned life jackets and jumped into the water. However, a company spokesman said evacuation capsules were used. The plat­form itself is about 100 feet above the water line. 
The drlling platform is oper­ated by Pennzoil for a group of owners, but Pennzoil had only one man on the rig, said com­pany spokesman Bob Harper in Houston. The others were con­tract workers for Pool Offshore Co., located in Harvey, La. 
Rescue operations were hampered by high winds and waves as a cold front moved through the area. 
At one point, a: helicopter trying to transport the most 

seriously injured hai to be tied to the platform to keep from being blown overboard. But at about 7:15 a.m. it managed to lift off with the first of the injured for the trip to Galves­ton, which took more than an hour. 
Harper said many of the men got off the platform via two evacuation capsules, which he said "look a lot like flying saucers.'' Each holds 28 persons. 
-The capsules are completely sealed and have a small power unit aboard that allows persons -­inside to lower the unit mto the water and then move at rela­tively slow speeds. 
"Our boats picked them out of the capsules,'' Harper said. "We had a 185-foot work boat and a 90-foot standby boat at the ri~. That's standard proce­dure.' 
One 19-year-old survivor, Gary Owen, who worked for a caterer, told his father he had ridden the evacuation capsule. 
Y oungOwen, who suffered cuts on has. elbow and kneecaps, would not discuss his expenence.

halftime advantage. The North 

Quad challengers held their 
biggest lead, 33-24, at the very 

outset of the fourth quarter. It 
was shortly thereafter when the 
momentum turned completely 
around. 
Keenehan scored eight of his 

ten points in that fourth-quarter 
stretch, while Dix, having trou­
ble connecting from the floor, 
hit all of six free throws in that 
span. 
''For the first three quarters 

the ball just wasn't going in at 
all," Berryman sa1d. "They 
played a really tough man-to· 
man defense, which drove us 
out of our offense. They cut off 
our passing lanes and they cut 
off our driving lanes." 
But when Howard finally got 

its passing and driving lanes 
back, it was Keene han that 
~elped his squad capitalize on 
lt. 
"Keenehan really came through amazingly,'' Berryman said. "He was a freshman playing like a senior. He had two super drives at the end that showed lots of guts for a freshman that was working with all juniors. ' ' 
Keenehan, meanwhile, felt that it was Howard's defensive play that sparked the come­back. 
''In the first game against Grace (52-39 Grace win last Wednesday) we weren't agres­sive at all,'' Keenehan said. "We started playing aggressive defense in the fourth quarter, and that's when we got it going. We came up with a lot of steals, and were able to ge_t our

Dix led a balanced Howard attack with 12 points, while Paul Mazanec and Keenehan had 11 and 10, respectively. Tim O'Connor led all scoreres and hit 15 for Grace,. while teammate Rich Damberg had 11. 
' 'I guess if we had to lose to anyone, I'm glad we had to do it to Howard,'' Grassey said. ''They have some real class players. Dix and Mazanec, for example, are both all-state players from high school.'' 
In the women's interhall championship, Breen-Phillips edged Walsh, 22-19, in a close struggle the entire way. Jan Schlaff led the victors with 12 points, while Carrie Luepke had eight for Walsh.

... Fallon 

(continued from page 8] 
the Physical Education De­partment and guided the Irish wrestlers for 18 years. In 1957 he added tennis to his coaching duties, a job he has come to cherish more and more as the years pass. 
"Maybe I'm mellowing out as I get older," admits Fallon, "but I've enjoyed coaching more the last couple of sea­sons, mostly because of the types of kids we've had the great leadership. I find a high positive correlation between good leadership, a good cap­tain and the success of the · team. We had that last year with Mark (Trueblood) and 
again (Harris)." ·  this year  with  Carlton  
A  whole  lot  of  internal  

leadership and a little dash of Tom Fallon--the secret to Notre Dame's success for the past 25 years. "You name the cap­tain," he says, "and I'll tell you whether or not it was a good season.'' 
Fallon knows what his job is, and does it well. "I find that when you get to the college level ofcoaching, most of these k:-:ts games are set. There's not a whole lot you can do about individual technique. Take (Mark) McMahon (this year's number one singles player), for example. It would take m~jor surgery to give him a big serve,'' he says with a smile. "But it's amazing what attitude can do. Sometimes when these kids get really enthused about it, they play better than they're capable of. I don't think the coach is as much a motivator as the team's morale and the leadership of the captain. 
''You name the captain, and I'll tell you whether or not it was agood 
season.'' 

''The job of a college coach today is to offer the best in the way offacilities, opportunity to develop, organization, a good schedule and a certain amount of discipline." 
As the 63-year old coach reflects on his tennis career, certain moments highlight the Fallon era. What would any coach remember better than the year his team won it all? 
"You'd have to say the Nation­al Collegiates in 1959 was the best,' ' he smiles of the first of two unbeaten seasons. "Actu­ally, we tied Tulane under the scorin$ system they had then.'' But hts is quick to point out, ''We'd have won hands down ifwe'd had the present scoring system, but they'd only let you take four players at the time.'' 
Since then, Fallon has wracked up an impressive 350-131 tennis record, second only to retired baseball coach Jake Kline on the all-time Notre Dame coaching victories list. Including his wrestl~ng wins, Fallon totals 412 behmg Kline's 552. Add to that four Eastern Collegiate Champion­ships and 21 (on the w9:y to 22) winning seasons, and lt spells nothing but success. 
Fallon realizes that there are a number of teams 10 the country that his teams could never compete with ... but they do, nonetheless. "The kids don't mind losin¥. to Michigan 9-0," he says, ' because they know that they'll never im­prove playing weaker oppo­nents.'' 
At present, the university allots two full scholarships for Fallon to divide as he pleases, three grants fewer than the NCAA's maximum limit of five, a situation he is willing to live with. · 
''If we had a full scholarship program here, there's no doubt 10 my mind that we'd be nationally ranked every year, but I'm not sure it's wonh the

the NCAA championship their freshman year and them go pro. As a coach and a teacher, I'm not sure I want that guy. The high turnover rate hurts the other guys on the team, and that guy isn't getting out of college what a student-ath­lete should--a meaningful de­gree. 
· "Most top-20 schools have gone all the way in terms of time and money,'' he adds. For example, they now have about five indoor tournaments during the winter. At the last NCAA meetings, I asked a guy from Princeton, 'How can your kids afford that much time away from school? The mini­mum amoUnt of time you'd be 

missing would be about 10 
days.' But Princeton says they can do it. UCLA says they can do it. In all justification, I couldn't take these kids away from school for that long. '' 
It seems that every week we hear about another athlete or group of athletes that received credn for a course he or she never took or has someone else take an exam or some other unethical (not to mention ille­gal) tactic, somehow connected to making their team the very best. In the long run, both the school and the athlete suffer.
