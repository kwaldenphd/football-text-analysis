Faculty approves harassment policy 
By PAUL PEARSON 
Associate News Editor 
In its monthly meeting Tues­day, the Faculty Senate passed a discriminatory harassment policy by a vote of 22 to 4 with one abstention. 
The policy, which will be sent to the Academic Council, pro­hibits discriminatory harass­ment, which it defines as ha­rassment that is "accompanied by demeaning expressions con­cerning the race, sex, religion, sexual orientation or national origin of the victim(s)." 
The policy defines harassment as any physical attack, threat, persistent badgering or verbal attack intentionally inflicted to cause harm to the person or property of another person. 
Under the policy, cases of ha­rassment by students would be reported to the rector if it oc­curs within a residence hall, or to the Office of Residence Life if it occurs outside. Cases of ha­rassment by faculty members would be reported to the chair of the academic department or, in cases involving the chair, to the dean of the college. 
According to Frank Connolly, who presented the proposal, the policy is not aimed at the restriction of offensive speech. "The simple expression of an idea, no matter how offensive, is not harassment," he said. 
Connolly believes that the pol­icy will not be abused by people making inappropriate charges under the policy. "Unless you could charge intimidation, in­tent of hostility and persistence, you're going to get anywhere (under the policy)." 
One senate member said that he would not vote for the policy because he feared its use "in inappropriate or even frivolous cases." 
The policy was originally drafted by a committee created by University Provost Timothy O'Meara and chaired by Eileen , dean of Freshman Year of Studies. This committee then asked the Faculty Senate to consider it. 


Anti-abortion protesters released from custody 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­More than 100 anti-abortion protesters agreed to identify themselves and post $250 bonds Tuesday in exchange for reduced misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass. 
The agreement between at­torney Russell Sanford and the St. .Joseph County prosecutor's office followed the protesters' initial refusal to provide their names and addresses as eondi­tions of their release. 
They were accused of tres­passing at the Womfm's Pavil­ion, a clinic where abortions are performed, and faced contempt of court charges for violating an injunction against demonstrations on the clinic's property. 
The protesters were to be re­leased from custody with credit for time served, but later may be assessed fines and court costs, Sanford said. 
The Fort Wayne-based Northeast Indiana Rescue group postponed indefinitely another protest it had planned for Tuesday at the clinic, where 107 of its members were ar­rested on Friday, spokeswoman Gloria Carrel said. 
The prosecutor's office said three of the protesters had been released earlier after identifying themselves and posting bond. One is getting married, another had a death in the family and the third was ill, a spokeswoman for the prosecu­tor said. 
The rest remained in custody at a National Guard Armory, which St. Joseph Superior Judge Jeanne Jourdan used as 

Sexual revolution leads to porn 
By MARY MURPHY 
News Writer 
The sexual revolution has lnd to hard pornography d.-basing women and children through images of incest and sadomasochism, said Judith Heisrnan at a lecture last night at Ttwodore's. 
"I may be touching a raw nerve," said Hllisman, author of "Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination of a People." 
Heisrnan, a counselor for the dtlpartment of Health and Hu­man Services, presented a dif­ferent perspective of the sexual revolution and pornography during her lecture "Sexual Hev­olution and Public Versus Pri­vate Space Behavior," paying particular attention to private vnrsus public space behavior. 
Before progressing with her prnsentation, Reisman asked the audionce to be open minded in viewing the slides and their relation to the sexual revolu­tion. 
"A lot of our problems are that the essence of porn or erotica is private space behavior in public space forms," Heisman said. Private space behavior is primarily nudity or "at risk" behavior, she explained. 
In a study of 6,000 images of children in pornographic publi­cations, Reisman found that 838 cartoons and 1250 visuals overlap sex and violence. 
With this in mind, she asked, "How can you say pornography doesn't have an effect on kids? That's the most nonsensical thing I've heard of. Everything we visually imbibe has an effect on us," she exclaimed. 
AI Kinsey, who wrote two books on sexual behavior, said that America was too uptight, too repressed, and that society has been lying about its sexual practices, Heisman told the au­dience. 
Kinsey said that 10 percent of the population is homosexual and humans are basically bi­sexual. Kinsey's philosophy is we should have as much sex as possible and in as many ways as possible, she continued. 
He often used children as sexual experiments. For example, in a study on sexual stimulation, 45 percent responded with twitching, 22 percent sobbed or were rigid, 17 percent had convulsions and cried. Yet, Kinsey concluded that all children had a "definite pleasure from stimulation." 
Reisman found the danger of this conclusion is that "no mat­ter how young and how much you scream, you can't be harmed if you're harmed sexu­ally." 
In another chart, Kinsey said that a 4-year-old had 26 or­gasms in 24 hours. 
The problem with these find­ings, Reisman said, is they were based on falsified data. "Kinsey is a liar." she pro­claimed. 
Reisman discussed other aspects of pornography which were dangerous to the human psyche such as the portrayal of children in incestuous relation­ships. 
Reisman noted that in magazines like Hustler, women are constantly portrayed with thinned or shaved pubic re­gions. She warned, don't be fooled; the publisher is trying to attract you to children. 
"There is a lot more direct eroticism flowing through a

a courtroom Monday afternoon for a mass hearing for the protesters. 
Members of the group have blocked access to abortion clin­ics in Fort Wayne, Kentwood and Niles, Mich., and have been arrested, but this is the longest that people from Northeast In­diana Rescue had been held, Carrel said. 
Sheriff Joe Nagy said city and county officials would be ready to handle another protest. It is costing his department $1,950 a day to provide meals, the extra officers and a nurse for the people being held at the ar­mory, he said. The only addi­tional cost will be meals if more people are arrested, Nagy said. 
Carrel said people refuse to give their names in order to identify with nameless victims of abortion. 
Most people taking part in Friday's protest are from the Fort Wayne area, have been trained in civil disobedience and knew what they were facing when they decided to risk ar­rest, said spokesman Bryan Brown of New Haven.

Crayons create new, beautiful colors 
In the beginning, God created Crayons. He cre­ated three crayons: red, blue, and yellow. And He was pleased. 
In Redtown lived a crayon named Rosy. Rosy grew up like a typical red Jeanne Blasi child. She only attended Asst. Production Crayolithic schools, was a Manager colorball cheerleader and ------­dated all the muscular "fat crayons." 
Rosy graduated from St. Crayons H.S. with honors and proceeded to The University of Colors. Now CU had a diverse Crayola body; red, yellow, and blue crayons all attended the university. Rosy never knew a crayon of another color, but she assumed they were regular crayons, created by Crayola God, just like her. 

When Rosy started her freshman year, she didn't understand why the red, blue, and yellow crayons were so prejudiced against each other. They were all crayons, some were just different colors with different cultures; no one crayon seemed better than the other. 
Rosy once discussed it with her red friends who said, "Oh, I'm friends with lots of yellow and blue crayons, but I don't think we were meant to mix with them. I'm not prejudiced, but I mean, just imagine what would happen if a red and a blue crayon fell in love and had children. The poor thing would be an unheard of color and everyone would per­secute it." But Rosy didn't understand their narrow-mindedness. How could two beautiful colors bring forth anything but a better color? 
Rosy was especially upset by their attitudes since she was "scoping" on a hot yellow dude in the waxing hall. She finally got the courage to ask him to her colorfest and the two had a great time, in spite of everyone's staring and whispering. 
The two continued dating throughout col­lege, and in spite of endless persecution, mocking, and being told how immoral they were, they got married and had a child. They named him Orange. 
Gaining courage from Rosy, other red and yellow crayons hooked up in spite of the prejudice . And soon orange crayons became prevalent and the ignorant prejudiced crayons came to accept Oranges' as equal {although it never should have come into question anyway). 
Yellows and Blues soon followed suit and

Reagan says Nancy book full of lies 
 LOS ANGELES -Ronald Reagan says a new biography of his wife, Nancy, is filled with lies. By the end of the day Monday, 150,000 new copies were ordered. That's in addition to the 600,000 already in or en route to bookstores around the country. Kitty Kelley's "Nancy Reagan: the Unauthorized Biography" portrays the former frrst lady as an abusive skinflint who ran the White House and carried on an affair with Frank Sinatra. Kelley claims that Reagan himself was with another woman on the day his daughter was born and that he and Nancy tried pot when he was governor. 
Democrats Launch 1992 Budget 
 WASHINGTON-House Democrats are introducing a $1.45 trillion budget proposal that boosts education and poverty programs and makes no tax changes. Republicans oppose the plan as unnecessary, contending it makes only minor changes in the spending outline Bush unveiled in February. The Democratic plan rejects cuts Bush proposed in 12 benefit programs, including re­ductions over five years that total $25 billion for Medi­care, $995 million for a welfare program and $698 million for guaranteed student loans.

Soviet withdrawal begins 
 BORNE-SULINOWO, Poland-The Red Army today began its long-awaited pullout from Poland after nearly 4 7 years of occupation. The pullout began at a formerly top-secret Soviet military base. A train, carrying members of a missile brigade that is being disbanded, was the first phase of a permanent pullout whose timetable was still a source of contention today. The Soviets say they will not vacate Poland before the end of 1993. Soviet troops have been a continuous presence in Poland since 1944, when they pushed back the German army, then stayed on to prop up a series of pro-Moscow regimes..

But, each color had to struggle to remove the inherent prejudices in some narrow­minded crayons who still had difficulty ac­cepting other colors and some still think they are better than others.

Thousands of Iraqi civilians flee, taking UCA seeks reform of refuge in support camps on the border 
Salvadorian values 
HIYADII. Saudi Arabia (AP)­A Saudi general confirmed Tuesday that his country has set up a refugee camp along the northern border just inside Iraq and that it is housing more than 13,000 men, women and children. 
Maj. Gen. Abdelaziz Al­Sheikh, deputy commander of joint Arab forc!ls, said hundreds more refugees are continuing to drift toward Saudi Arabia's 550-mile border seeking help. More than 200 arrived Tuesday. 
The refugees in the Saudi eamp are mostly civilians and not war casualties, a)-Sheikh said in an interview. "They are looking for safety. They are not happy with the regime in Iraq." 
"We're looking at it from the humanitarian point of view," al­Sheik said. "They asked us to help. We have very close rela­tions with the Iraqi people. This is historieal." 
Al-Sheikh said the problem was an international one, but that the Saudis were giving the refugees tents, clothing, food and medical eare. 
"We don't know what will happen to them when the coali­tion forces withdraw." he said. The allied forces in occupied Iraq will pull out when a l ,440­member U.N. peace-keeping

means the creation of a com­munity aware of "its potential and its problems, its values and its problems." The university objective is the eventual "social transformation of the Salvado­rian reality." 
Beirne connected his experi­ences in El Salvador to Notre Dame by explaining that a large, Catholic university, such as Notre Dame, must keep a constant eye on both theory and practice to ensure consistency. Also, the university must always know the community it serves. It must ask "who needs us most?" the "socially mobile Catholic population" or "the new immigrants; the homeless. the chronically poor?" 
The large, Catholic university must challenge its "students to reexamine their basic values and live with the consequences of this examination." Also, the university should be a "forum for discussion of the major Is­sues of our day." 
He said that the job of the UCA is to influence a country the size of Massachusetts, while Notre Dame has a far larger country to influence.

Siwinski: tactical errors led to fall of Polish communists 
By ANNMARIE ZELL 
News Writer 
Woldzimierz Siwinski, vice president of Warsaw University, identified the forces of history, domestic resistance, economic failure, and geopolitics, as being contributors to the collapse of communism in Poland. 
In a lecture titled, "Why Communism Collapsed in Poland," Siwinski claimed that throughout Polish history, the communist hold in Poland has been weak. 
He referred to several tactical mistakes by the communists, especially those occurring post­WWI which contributed to this relatively weak communist po­sition in Poland. For example, the communist anti-state stance was against Polish ide­als, according to Siwinski. 
In 1918, after WWI, Poland was "carved" out of three sepa­rate states: Russia, the Austro­Hungary Empire, and Prussia. The Communist anti-state stance worked against the self­determinism and nationalism of the country, according to Si­winski. 
Another significant commu­nist tactical error, according to Siwinski, was their anti-peas­ant stance. Siwinski said, "the communist treated the peasant as the enemy." He felt that this position was "very unaccept­able" because the peasant was the basis of the Polish economy. 
In support of his point that historically Poland always had anti-communist roots, Siwinski cited the many rebellions stages in Poland. These include the October rebellion of 1956, March rebellion of 1968, June rebellion of 1976, August rebellion of 1980 and the final rebellion of 1988. 
Domestic resistance in the form of "civil society" was the second identifiable force which led to the collapse of commu­nism in Poland. "Idealistically". said Siwinski, "communism is a very strong state, and there is no civil society. However, the Poles did not give up civil soci­ety." Swinski cited the family and the church as two institu­tions through which the Poles maintained civil life and a na­tional identity. 
While Poland was communist, Siwinski claimed that the Poles maintained a national identity, separate from Communism. "The Polish were very opposed to the foreign invaders. There was a 'we' (Poles} and 'they' (Russians) attitude." 
Poles, according to Siwinski, maintained that their culture was superior as well as differ­ent and separate from the Rus­sian. Therefore even if a mem­ber of the intelligentsia were communist he wot necessarily feel united with the Russians because he was one of 'us' (Polish} and not one of 'them' (Russian}, added Siwinski. 
Siwinski indicated that other Poles joined the Communist party for their careers, but he assessed, "relatively few actu­ally believed in communism." 
The third force leading to the collapse of communism in Poland, according to Siwinski, was economic failure. Siwinski claimed that the communist system was fairly "successful in implementing extensive eco­nomic growth. Poland ran out of communist ways to deal with the economic problems -the only solution was to change to a market economy," Siwinski said. 
The final cause of the disinte­gration of communism was geopolitical forces. Siwinski viewed the threat of Soviet in­tervention as the largest factor blocking the collapse of com­munism in Poland. 
Therefore, when the Soviets indicated (through conferences, particularly one held in June, 1988 in Alexandria,Va, and through U.N. statements} that they were not going to use force to maintain Soviet control in the satellites, the political si­tuation was ripe for the fall of communism in Poland. 
However, Siwinski noted that many Poles believe that "it was because of no kind heart" that the Soviets allowed Poland to become independent. Rather, the Soviet Union wanted to equal the United States in mili­tary power and for economic reasons could not afford the expenses of maintaining control in Poland. 
Siwinski conceded, "although , the majority have been against communism from the begin­ning, it doesn't mean that the transformation to a market economy will be easy." In fact, Siwinski expects Poland will experience, "many ups and downs." 
According to Siwinski, communism makes people more passive and dependent on the state which will make the change to a market economy very difficult. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Kellogg Institute for In­ternational Studies. 
Sesquicentennial events unveiled at HPC meeting 

By STEVEN KRAUSS 
News Writer 
Newly elected Hall Presidents' Council (HPC} representatives met last night in official capacity for the first time since taking office. The new officers were welcomed by a number of pressing issues. 
Katie Pamenter of the Sesquicentennial Committee revealed the schedule of events for next year's celebration of Notre Dame's 150th anniversary. The first set of events will take place over the weekend of October 31st, and will include a Halloween dance at Stepan Center, as well as "The first homecoming at Notre Dame in twenty years." 
Special features of the home­coming will include a float competition, a special pep rally, and a crowning of homecoming king and queen. In addition there will be a gigantic homecoming parade featuring not only students, but also "shriners and other members of the South Bend community," according to Stephanie Ferry, homecoming committee chairperson. 
The second half of the Sesquicentennial celebration will take place the week of March 16 -21, immediately following Spring Break. Events will include a Class Night and Dessert Fest at the dining halls, a battle of ND campus bands, as well as nationally known musicians and comedians. Special events for St. Patrick's Day will also be organized. 
A representative from Christmas in April reminded hall presidents that the service project will get under way this Saturday, April 13th, beginning at 8 a.m., rain or shine. Everything is progressing according to plan, and a large turnout is expected. 
Finally, there will be a meet­ing for Freshman Orientation '91 commissioners on Sunday, April 14th, at 7 p.m. in the Montgomery Theatre in LaFor­tune. All commissioners who have been appointed by Sunday are expected to attend.

Also,  these  magazines  
publish  "child  magnets,"  
material  meant  to  attract  

children. She showed a slide of a Playboy coloring book in which a child had actually colored one of the pages. 
When you demean a people you can laugh at them, and you can do just about anything, Reisman commented. "Beware of what you laugh at." 
"Anybody who tells you this is a victimless crime, you tell them they are behind the times," she said. 
Reisman challenged the audience to think of pornography material in terms of proxemics, or spacial behavior. Proxemics is the way people and animals use space in relating. 
Lovers, for example, usually have 0" to 3" space between them, whereas friends have a social space of approximately 1', and far public space can reach thousands of feet. Therefore, she concludes private space behavior in a public space forum is a "mismatch, " which results in dysfunctional behavior. 
According to an article appearing in USA Today, Playboy magazine is "U.S.A.'s most widely read men's sexual education resource." 
Reisman finds this fact disturbing. She asked the audience, "How many of you remember the first time you saw a picture in Playboy magazine and the circumstances surrounding that instance?" 
She said she found, in a three year study on how children are depicted and affected by pornography and media violence, most people can. This again manifests the 
Man protests by tying body to train cars

Thomas Adams. 29, chained himself to one of the 26 rail cars for three hours Monday at the CSX Transportation freight yard in suburban Walbridge. 
Adams, a member of Stop Trashing Our Resources in Michigan. was protesting plans to dump the soil in a Toledo­area landfill. His group claims Michigan is deregulating some hazardous wastes so they can be shipped to out-of-state land­fills. 
The Frankenmuth, Mich., man was charged with criminal trespassing, disrupting public service and vandalism. He was being held in lieu of $9,000 bail. 
Capt. Larry Pilzecker, a jail supervisor, said Adams refused to eat breakfast and lunch Tuesday. He said the staff wouldn't take any action unless Adams' fast becomes a medical emergency. 
Joann Schiavone, a spokeswoman for a Toledo­based group called Hazardous Environment Leak Poison, said Adams refused food and water to protest his incarceration.

impact of visual images. 

To prove that visual images are more immediate than the printed word and are impossi­ble to erase from our memory, she showed two slides at once. In every case where the slides have been showed side by side, the audience has immediately recognized the slide of a man and a woman, remembering many details of the image. Conversely, they did not re­member "The American University" printed on the other slide. 
Reisman noted that the memory bank for images is different from the memory bank for cognitive thought. This, Reisman states, is because cognitive information cannot be processed at the same time one processes visual information. 
So much of how we view ourselves is "defined by the media, because visual communication has enormous impact," Reisman said. 
For example, during wars, men and women are portrayed with enormous respect. Cross­culturally, the images are of men and women with arms outstretched and as protecting, powerful, purposeful people. 
Reisman showed that art is often propaganda by presenting two opposing images of Stalin. She said, the way in which people are cartooned allows us to hate, disdain, and have been historically used to turn people against each other." Reisman urged the audience to constantly bear in mind the use of art to debase as opposed to love, or to honor as opposed to harm people. 
The modern problem, according to Reisman, with propaganda is that it helped to spin off the sexual revolution, particularly Playboy magazine. 
Reisman concluded with a look towards the future. "·We can't go back, we have to go forward to a time where men and women can relate, love, and trust one another." 
The lecture was sponsored by the Student Union Board.

Hard times lead man to kill family, self during trip west 
RENO, Nev. (AP) -A Michi­gan man who brought his fam­ily west in search of a better life had 87 cents to his name when he shot to death his wife and her three children and killed himself, investigators say. 
A Detroit newspaper reported today that the man, David Greenwood, 32, had a history of mental illness. 
The bodies of Greenwood and his wife, Elizabeth, 31, were found near their pickup Satur­day on an isolated dirt road about 25 miles east of Reno. The children, ages 2, 8 and 10, were found in the front seat of the truck. 
The family left Pontiac, Mich., about two weeks ago. Nevada state investigators said 87 cents was found among the victims and that Greenwood apparently had been despondent because he did not have a job. 
Deputy Coroner Gayla Addington reported relatives said the Greenwoods had been married about two years and were having financial

problems. A family member said they were passing through Nevada on their way to Oregon, Addington said. 
The Detroit News reported today that Greenwood had a history of depression and at­tempted suicides. 
According to court records, Greenwood was diagnosed as suicidal and dependent on alco­hol and treated at two mental health centers for about a month in 1986, the newspaper said. The court records said he had tried to kill himself four times before being hospitalized, the newspaper said. 
In Pontiac, neighbors said the family abruptly packed up some belongings on March 21, put their three-bedroom home up for sale and headed west. 
The Greenwoods were known in the working-class neighbor­hood about 35 miles from De­troit for doing odd jobs for elderly and handicapped neigh­bors, such as shoveling snow and checking in on ill neigh­bors. 
David Greenwood rebuilt three old bicycles for the chil­dren, neighbors said. The older two children were his wife's by a previous marriage. 
"They were the most polite kids I'd seen in so long. It was always, 'please' and 'thank you,"' said neighbor Shirley Ri­ley. 
The couple met while working at a machine shop, Riley said. Just before Christmas, Green­wood quit because he was al­lergic to a coolant, which blis-

tered his hands, and his wife quit last year because of foot surgery, Riley said. 
"Even with a cast on her foot she'd come out and shovel our snow," Riley said. 
Although most neighbors ex­pressed shock over the killings, Mrs. Greenwood's half-sister, Kellie Deuling, 19, of Newaygo, Mich., said she was not sur­prised. 
"I suspected it," she said. "They were really into religion. David was freaky when he talked. David scared me. didn't like him. She wasn't heavy into religion, she just agreed." 
Shirley Riley's husband, .Jack, said Greenwood bought a gun after Christmas, but it was not considered unusual because he liked to hunt. 
Daniel Byrd, the older chil­dren's father, said David Greenwood was jealous, drank heavily and did not let him visit the children. 
"I gave each one $5 when they left, even Liz and Dave," said another neighbor, Peggy Stacy. "I hugged and kissed them all goodbye. I told them they were taking a chance." 
Mrs. Riley said she urged the Greenwoods to leave the chil­dren with her until they were settled, "but Liz said, 'No, it's a family adventure."' 
"I tried to talk them both out of it," Mrs. Riley said. "But they were happy. They kissed me and said goodbye."

Census reveals continued Government report: Exxon oil spill segregation in communities continues to disturb environment 
MIAMI (AP) -Nearly a third of the nation's urban blacks still live in neighborhoods that are at least 90 percent black, according to a study of figures from the Census Bureau. 
In a study based on a com­parison of 1990 and 1980 fig­ures, The Miami Herald re­ported Tuesday that more than 
9.1 million blacks -or about 30 percent -still live in virtual racial isolation. 
That was down slightly from 34 percent in 1980, it said. 
"Any way you look at it, blacks are still very segre­gated," said University of Chicago sociologist Douglas Massey, co-author of several segregation studies. "At this rate, blacks will stay segregated for a long time." 
The study also found that 68 percent of the nation's white population lives in nearly all­white neighborhoods, down from 76 percent in 1980, the newspaper said. 
"We've known for some time how intractable the residential segregation phenomenon is," said Bill Tidwell, director of re­search for the National Urban League. "We know now that those historical patterns haven't been broken." 
The study did find that 13 states with large black popula­tions, as well as the District of 
Corrections

An article in Tuesday's Ob­server mistakenly said that only one percent of the current Notre Dame faculty members are ethnic Americans. Accord­ing to Notre Dame Report #16 (April 27, 1990), 11 percent of the current ND faculty mem­bers are ethnic Americans. The Observer regrets the error. 

 
In Tuesday's Observer, the last line of a national brief 


Columbia, showed at least some decrease in the percentage of racially isolated blacks during the 1980s. 
Texas had the largest de­crease, followed in order by Florida, California, Illinois, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Virginia, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
It also found that 44 of the nation's top 50 metropolitan areas showed some declines in black isolation. 
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was guardedly optimistic. 
"For the foreseeable future, segregation is a way of life in residential living," Hooks said. "There will be no dramatic change quickly, but there are some positive seeds being planted." 
But the sociologists warn that some of the apparent im­provement in many cities may not be real. Rather, it may be caused by an influx of poor Hispanics into once predomi­nantly black neighborhoods. 
Indeed, metropolitan areas that showed the most apparent improvement are in Florida, Texas and California, where most of the Hispanic immigra­tion of the 1980s occurred.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) ­The federal government said in its first comprehensive report on the damage from the Exxon Valdez disaster that the crude oil spilled two years ago con­tinues to harm wildlife. 
The report, filed in federal court Monday, dropped the se­crecy surrounding estimates of the long-term toll that were withheld because of lawsuits against Exxon Corp. and the state by governments, fisher­men and native Alaskans. 
The 19-page report is a summary of preliminary find­ings in dozens of scientific studies conducted since the tanker ran aground March 24, 1989, dumping 10.9 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. 
Exxon spent $2.2 billion cleaning up the spill. Four weeks ago it reached agree­ment on a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. government and the state. The settlement still needs approval from the Legis­lature and a federal judge. 
In recent months Exxon has run a nationwide campaign presenting the sound as largely recovered from the spill. 
But Monday's report said that crude from the nation's worst ~ oil spill contaminated sediment 330 feet below the sound's surface, and that contaminated clams and other invertebrates continue to affect marine mammals. 
"There are indications that injury is continuing," said Paul Gertler of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Gertler said the information will help the public judge the proposed settlement. 
Exxon officials in Alaska hadn't seen the report and had no immediate comment, spokesman Joe Tucker said. 
The report said the spill killed up to a half million birds -in­eluding several hundred bald eagles, several hundred thou­sand more chicks, up to 5,500 sea otter, and 200 harbor seals. The spill caused no widespread die-off of fish or shellfish, but its long-term impact may still be serious, researchers found. 
At least 26 archaeological sites were seriously harmed, and hunting and fishing essen­tial to native Alaskans' lifestyle were severely affected, the re­port said. 
Gauging complete damage will take years. 
"In many cases, it's far too early for us to be able to say how long it's going to be before those species can recover," Gertler said. 
State officials had opposed release of the studies because of the lawsuits. But on Monday, Attorney General Charles Cole said he didn't see anything in the report that might prejudice the state's case. 




ND/SMC Right to Life group plans picket, other anti-abortion actions 
Special to The Observer 

Students at the University of Notre Dame will participate in Pro-Life Week this week through a variety of activities to increase student awareness. 
"Rose for Life" stickers will be distributed during the week outside the dining halls, and 100 small wooden crosses will be planted in the Fieldhouse Mall on Thursday to call atten­tion and prayer to the unborn victims of abortion. 
Several students have signed a statement, to be published in an advertisement in Thursday's Observer. It says that "every human, born and unborn," is a "unique and unrepeatable being made in the image of God and entitled to that most basic of rights, the right to life." 
Flatly opposing "the so-called right to an abortion -a right which so ignores the rights of others that it allows us to de­stroy them," the statement also laments "the havoc that abor­tion wreaks on its many vic­tims." 
The statement continues that "the taking of a human life can never be the answer to the problems besetting women" and urges "the serious en­gagement of those problems through constructive, rather than destructive means." 
On Friday, students will picket peacefully at the Women's Pavilion, an abortion provider at 2010 Ironwood Circle. Rides will be provided for interested students at 1 p.m., 1:45 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. from the University's main circle. 
One hundred and four anti­abortion demonstrators were arrested last Friday on criminal trespassing charges. 
The events of Pro-Life Week are sponsored by the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's College Right to Life organization. For more information, call Maria Rhomberg, president of ND/SMC Right to Life, at 283-2613.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Committee on Cultural Diversity seeks applicants 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of the University of Notre Dame Student Govern­ment Board of Trustees Committee on Cultural Diver­sity, I would like to take this time to encourage interested members of the student body to get involved with the 1991­1992 committee. Because of the fact that out of the nine committee positions available, six will be vacated at the end of this year, the committee has initiated an application process, t>nding on Wed. April 17, at 5 
p.m. Applications for the 1991­92 committee can be obtained at the Student Government office in LaFortune Student Ctmter. 
This committeo, formed at the lwginning of the 1990 school term. was designed to inVI~stigate the issues concern­ing Ethnic-American students on campus. After approxi­mately four months of careful research. the committee drafted a n~port corn posed of the rec­ornmmldations relating to is­suns such as financial aid, a Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Minority Affairs. Intellectual Life, Student Life, etc. 
This n~port was then submit­ted to the University Board of Trustees during one of their campus meetings on Feb. 7, 1991, in hopes of gaining uni­vnrsity support. and providing an outlinn for the changes nec­essary for making the climate at the university conducive to cultural diversity. verses cui-

tural visibility. Since that time, the members of the Student Government committee have followed up their initial actions by holding numerous meeting with members from almost ev­ery branch and department of the administration. 
Even though these meetings continue now, and have been scheduled throughout the re­mainder of the school year, the committees efforts will not stop here. By, assuming, in the fu­ture, a more active, creative and visible role, this organiza­tion will continue its efforts in promoting the adoption of the recommendations presented within the report. 
The members of the Student Government Board of Trustees Committee on Cultural Diver­sity, in search of new committee members, seek individuals of diverse backgrounds, variant opinions, but most of all those persons burning with the desire to promote positive change to­ward the goal of making all in­dividuals feel as though they are truly members of the Notre Dame community. Therefore, we strongly encourage every member of this community to consider getting involved with the efforts of this body.

Smoking task force's policy is archaic and inconsistent 
Dear Editor: 
Reference is made to The Ob­server story (April 8)on the smoking task force created by Father Malloy. The long ex­pected witch hunt has begun. Its overture was the banning of smoking in some of the more "progressive" dorms on campus and, more subtlety, by the removal of the hall ashtrays in our own beloved Carroll hall. No one asked the smoking resi­dents how we felt about the matter. 
We were nauseated to learn about Sorin Hall's "adequate compromise's where smoking was banned everywhere but one side of the front porch. This is not adequate and hardly a compromise. This policy is reminiscent of how Blacks, an­other group that ignorant, ar­rogant people tend to feel supe­rior to, were made to sit in the back of the bus in the pre-civil rights era. This is archaic! Is this how Notre Dame solves its inter-personal problems? By driving out anyone who doesn't fit the mainstream, so-very­nineties, upper middle class ND profile? Are they trying to cre­ate a super-race of production line Dorner clones? Apparently so. 
We wonder if the alumni, and all the money thl'ly spend here on the football weekends, will be asked to put out their cigars, pipes and cigarettes in front of the bookstore. Probably not. Is it a mistake that the Joyce ACC, the Morris Inn and the Huddle-campus spots very popular with wealthy, and sometimes very generous alumni-are being "considered separately"? No, of course not. But then again, inconsistent policy is nothing new here un­der the Dome. How many alumni had their beers taken away on South Quad last foot­ball season? Our guess is not many. 
The argument will undoubt­edly be made that tobacco is unhealthy and its use annoying to others. If health is the big concern of the administration and the non-smokers of the University then why not ban beer? After all, alcohol is un­healthy and alcoholic products bear Surgeon General's warn­ings as well. If consideration is the goal, we ask you how an­noying is a screaming drunk or the smell of liquor-laden puke next to your tire as you come out of The Linebacker or Senior Bar? The smoking task force could be the vanguard of a new American Temperance move­ment born right here at ND! Won't we all be so proud. 
The fact that the Kurds being killed by the thousand and our most feared enemy since World War II on the brink of civil war were beat out for the headline on the front page by "Official Policy on Smoking Created by new Task Force" seems to il­lustrate the dream world that a lot of the Notre Dame commu­nity lives in. Do non-smokers think that when they get out into the workplace that all their co-workers (and bosses) won't smoke? Will they ask them to take it outside to the correct side of the porch? Again, probably not. Their kids are going to go to bed awfully hun­gry if they do. 
The Powers-That-Be are ask­ing to know how we feel about the issue. Well, we fear that given the current trend of per­secutions that this will not be a venue of discussion and com­promise but a quick way to railroad us. We don't expect sympathy; we don't want it. Keep it. But we're not afraid to defend an unpopular position. We are nice, and yes, consider­ate people we smokers. Neither I nor any of my friends that smoke have ever told someone to buzz off who asked us to put out a cigarette. However, we also have never felt guilty about smoking in a designated smok­ing area where we knew we weren't bothering anyone.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Sexuality should not dominate co-ed housing debate 
Dear Editor: 
I found myself at first pleased, and then disturbed by Paul Corintha's March 22 Jetter concerning co-ed housing. Mr. Corintha's perspective on co-ed housing was truly original, showing its author to be a man of treat insight into the ways of the world. But I was sorry to discover that Mr. Corintha, a man who so clearly has his finger on the very jugular of the co-ed housing debate, nonetheless failed to take the opportunity to seize this, to coin a phrase, political "sacred chicken" firmly with both of his hands, and choke the life out of it. 
Mr. Corintha made three particularly relevant points. As he says, it is ludicrous to blame the housing situation for the state of gender relations on this campus. The root of the problem can be traced instead to the fact that men and women here communicate in the first place. None of this would be an issue if only we were not daily confronted by members of the opposite sex. 
I strongly recommend each and every one of you out there that you avoid your gender counterparts as much as pos­sible. It's always worked like a charm for me. It is also a fact that many of our older alumni, who did not have the benefit of being given a chance to "form meaningful relationships with women," are nonetheless perfectly adept socially. It has always warmed my heart to see these brave souls, clad in their traditional Irish plaid-n­polyester, standing around in the stadium parking lot, drinking themselves into oblivion. "These men," I think to myself, "are men who un­derstand women. And they are certainly, certainly not 'social morons.'" 
But by far and away, Mr. Corintha's best point is that Notre Dame is already the greatest university in the world, and that it has absolutely nothing to do with this. As Mr. Corintha sees, Notre Dame is great because of its success at promoting one incredibly insightful and all-embracing principal concerning human nature: people should be treated like the lust-filled swine they really are. 
In light of this, it seems to me that simply resisting the push for co-ed housing, as Mr. Corintha has bravely elected to do, is not enough: it is time for all good Catholics across this campus to insist that God's law is not broken-or at least, that the people breaking it are too worried about getting busted to enjoy themselves. 
Therefore, I suggest that the following measures be taken immediately: 1) the abolish­ment of room visitation rights; 
2) the immediate removal of men and women into separate quads, enclosed by electric fences and patrolled by gender­sensitive guard dogs, as opposed to their being merely in separate dorms; 3) the abolishment of the campus forces that are known as "co-ed classes"; and finally, 4) the abolishment of dorm dances, which were always just thin excuses for dance-floor "elbow sex" anyway. 
Considering the fact that, after reading Mr. Corintha's arguments, the need for all these reforms was clearer to me than ever before, I was for some time bewildered as to why he himself had not made such recommendations. A closer reading or the text of his letter, however, provided me with a disturbing and tragic clue concerning the origin of Mr. Corintha's hesitancy to go all the way-he himself may well have been a victim of temptation. 
In one of his closing passages, Mr. Corintha's words become achingly, nay, throbbingly reminiscent of Augustine's Confessions: "Everyone (and not just Catholics) who has had premarital sex knows there is something wrong with it-our conscience reminds us of this, even if the agents are not ex-actly cognizant of the exact reasons for its wrongness. Continued abuse of the inher­ent goodness of sexuality, of course, tends to mute the beckonings of conscience." 

No one could or would make such claims as forcefully and authoritatively as Mr. Corintha unless they spoke from long, hard, warm experience of the world. I pray that he recognizes that any fornicating he may have engaged in, at any time in your life, was not your fault; it was the fault of a university that has forgotten its principals, lost sight of the fact that no human individual alone is strong enough to whip the chains of temptation, to toss off their overwhelming urge to go out and "jump somebody's bones". I can only assume that he fell into this temptation for the obvious reason-he lives off campus, away form the immediate guidance of the Administration. 
Why is it that the noblest souls of any generation must

suffer so hellishly so that they might bring the rest of us light in our moral darkness? The sacrifices Mr. Corintha's has made so that all of us might better understand. I only hope and pray that we treat Mr. Corintha's arguments with all the reverence of which they are due. 
One final point, and then my tribute to Mr. Corintha's way of thinking will be at an end. It is very true that co-ed housing will not magically cure all of our male/female difficulties, and that there are definite trade-offs involved. We must all think this through carefully. But this emphasis on sexuality and on fears that, if placed in close proximity, men and women will inevitably act on their basest emotions, strikes me as pathetic and sad. 
In considering the question of whether or not Notre Dame should have co-ed housing, the acceptability of pre-marital sex is in a certain sense not at issue: no one has discussed doing away with parietals, or allowing free and rampant sex with no consequences-not yet, by a long shot. There is no proof, moreover that placing people under the same floor, while retaining parietals and the Catholic prohibition against pre-marital sex, will lead to any more transgressions of those codes than already occurs. 
The real question is, whether or not having co-ed housing would be an effective means of improving the genuineness of male/female relations at Notre Dame. Judging from the sorry state of affairs at many schools which do have co-ed housing, the answer may well be "no." But let us at least consider the issue from the appropriate standpoint, rather than becoming so fixated on sex and sexual fears that we are unable discuss it intelligently.

Dear Editor: 
I am writing to express my disappointment in the turn-out for the recent St. Mary's/Notre Dame Freshwoman's dinner held in the Saint Mary's dining Hall. Both St. Mary's and Notre Dame's Freshman Boards worked together with the goal of improving the relations be­tween the women on the two campuses. we, the board mem­bers, and hoped to start a rela­tionship that would be carried on throughout our four years and to minimize stereotypes among our community. To im­prove the relations, we felt a dinner at which we dyed Easter eggs for a local shelter would be ideal to fulfill our goals. 
Unfortunately, due to forces beyond our control, the dinner could not be held in a totally neutral environment: therefore, the dinner sponsored by the SMC Freshman Board we held in our dining hall. I understand the inconvenience it may have been for the Notre Dame women to attend; however, the weather was beautiful and the shuttles were running. Of the 1200 freshwornan among the two schools only about forty attended. I am deeply disap­pointed since both boards were so supportive of the idea. 
I appreciate those who made the effort to attend. I carne away from the dinner saying "I am sorry to realize that I wasted a whole semester stereotyping Notre Dame women. I feel I made new friends. Friends that I could call to have dinner with or to talk to." It was an experience that our whole community could have benefitted from if they taken advantage of it. hope my letter will encourage people to "break the barrier" between the two schools. I also hope those who are taking our places in office next year will recognize our effort and con­tinue to work for better rela­tions. It's well worth the effort!

"If a team throws together Tim Singleton and a Division II player of the year, and we don't know about it. it won't get seeded." 
Once the field is narrowed to 16 teams, the committee meets again and reseeds the h~ams to attempt to create balance in tlw bracknts. And not too long after that, a new Bookstore champion will be crowned. 
Some of the top teams vying for thn top spot: 
Adworks. Same name, same levnl of competition, different faces. Derrick .Johnson, a fluid 6-5 swingman, is the lone constant on this team that narrowly lost to Malicious Prostitution in last season's championship game. c;orw are Tony !Hen, Kevin Knyes, Cedric Figaro and .Jim Dolan (to "Tequila White Lightning"). In their plaetl is a qukker team with as equal or better tahmt. 
Former varsity basketball player Kevin Ellery is the major acquisition, adding his prowess around the hoop to "Ad works." Also joining "Adworks" is Dorsey Levens, an All-Tournament selection with "Soul Sonic Foree" last season. 
"We're smaller," said .Johnson. "We're all about the same size across the board, but we'n1 a little quicker (than last year). I think we can do it (advance as far as last year).

former two-time Bookstore MVP, is one of the guards. He filled in for "Tequila" when former Irish quarterback Jake Kelchner went down with an injury last tournament, and will return this year. Linebacker Brian Ratigan rounds out the lineup for this group. 
Just 
Chillin'. Ray Griggs carried this team to the round of eight last year. A question concerning this team has emerged however. Dave Clar, one of the keys for "Chillin'," tore several ligaments in his ankle and will miss the tour­nament, so it remains to be seen who will replace him. "Chillin"' will also miss Griggs for a few games while he is at football practice. 

Other 
teams to watch in­clude the "Gauchos," who re­turn All-Tournament pick Ray Vasquez, "Paradise Jam," "Multiple Scoregasms" and "Fast Break." 


Here then, is the way this writer sees the whole thing winding up. 
"Adworks" will be off and running, and with their speed and athletic ability will blow many teams out, even when Levens is at practice. 
"Tequila White Lightning," with its tremendous size also should have its way with its opponents, all the way to a direct collision course with "Adworks." 
The championship will be yet another good game, with Dolan going against his former team. "Adworks'" speed and "Tequila's" size will be in direct contrast. The key will be guard play for "Tequila." If their guards can stand up to the pressure "Adworks" is sure to show, and can get the ball inside to the big men, "Adworks" will have its work cut out for them. 
If "Adworks" can force ··~· turnovers and turn the game into a track meet, however, they will have a chance to steal the game from "Tequila." Another key matchup will be Kevin Ellery against Jim Dolan, Ellery's coach on the basketball team. Ellery is used to playing taller players, so he will be able to fight to at least a standoff. 
Yet another factor to con­sider is the weather. If stiff winds or wet conditions dictate a slow pace, "Tequila" will be at an advantage. 
This game is very, very tough to pick, but if I had to choose, I would pick ... "Adworks." "Tequila White Lightning X" is a solid club with good guards, but I just can't see them matching "Adworks" back­court. So Derrick Johnson, in his final Bookstore Tournament, will get a championship.

It is safe to say that Bookstore Basketball has exceeded the dreams of even those who still think the Cubs will win another World Series. The biggest sign of a good tourney is one in which people remember the event rather than the winners. 
It's a tournament as old as Digger Phelps' reign at Notre Dame, and it will likely be here long after he leaves. It's outlasted three Irish football coaches, the USFL, the ABA, the Senior Baseball League and soon the WLAF. It's the dominating event in a lackluster spring festival known as An Tostal. 
It's the only event that can draw Commons owner Pasquale to campus, bragging about how he sponsors the two-time defending champs. And Pasquale is probably the only owner who makes the team pick up the check after the last call. 
It is a tournament that allows university presidents and former hoop stars to show they can still shoot the jumper. It is one that shows Father Time waits for no one, including Father Malloy. 
It is a jock-dominated event which everyday students actually win once in a while, evidenced by Joe Scott's legendary performances the past two years. At the very least students have a better chance of winning than Halley does of seeing his comet. 
It is a tournament which manages to attracts some of the worst, intimidated referees in the history of organized basketball. James Naismith rolls over when he hears one blow his whistle. 
Other than the Dodge NIT, it is the only tourney which waits to see who wins in order to seed the final 16 teams. It is unmistakably the only tourney which allows teams to pick first-and sometimes second-round opponents. 
It is the only tourney whose strengths so far overshadow its weaknesses. It is the only event on campus, including those twice-weekly lectures by always in demand Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, that can draw a bigger and more enthusiastic crowd than the Tuesday specials at Coach's. 
In a day of greed and money, it is a tourney which is still played for just fun and a trophy. At least unless the score is close and the crowds are big. 
It is a tourney that keeps with every other campus event and makes fun of Ricky Watters whenever possible. It is one in which crowds cheer Bubba Cunningham after building up a fall of hatred over football tickets. 
It is a tourney in which teams without a snowball's chance in hell of even making a basket, let alone winning a game, pay five American dollars to make fools of themselves. Most succeed. 
It is a tourney which became so big that it outgrew its name by moving the finals to Stepan. But Stepan Basketball just didn't have the same ring. 
It insists on no more than one past or current basketball player, or three total football players on a team. The executive brain trust is still deciding on whether a team can have more than one chemical engineering major. 
But this is supposed to be a party. 
Light the candles. Strike up the band. 
Happy Birthday, Bookstore Basketball.

Victims of Terror 
Snite sponsors French Revolution-era letter readings 
By SCOTT SMORON Accent Writer 
You've read about the Terror, now hear the letters by those who nxperienced it. 
A dramatic reading of letters written by French prisoners during thn Heign of Terror will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, April IJ and 10, at the Snite Museum of Art. The readings will begin at 3 
p.m. in the Ninnteenth-Century Gallery and will last approximately one hour. Charles-Louis Muller's masterpiece, 'The Last Roll-Call of the Vietims of Terror," will serve as a backdrop for the reading. 
The reading has been organized by John Shields of the Snite. He was motivated to stage this reading by the recent availability of letters written by victims of the Terror and their relevance to Muller's masterpiece. 
"Since we have first-hand documents from prisoners, we can add a new dimension to the art," said Shields. "The prisoners were allowed to write letters to loved ones, but the letters wound up bning eonfiscated and put in boxes." 
Letters written by Queen Marie-Antoinette, the poet Andre Chenier, and Charlotte Corday, the patriot and murderess of Mar at. will be featurnd. 
The letters explore the hopes and doubts of these prisoners as they face the prospects of being set free or being put to death. Their dreams for freedom and fears of death are common to us all, and thnir historical significance should be of interest to many students. 
"Anyone may be interested in this," said Shields. "Art, gov­ernment, history, there is something for every student." 
Staff, staff assistants, and students will be assisting Shields with his presentation. Reservations are appreciated due to the limited number of seats at each reading. Reserve your own place by calling 239-5466.

My entire section is sick. 
This probably doesn't sound too surprising. After all, South Bend's wonderful weather. easy-going academics and qual­ity dining can be tough on your immune system. Some days Notre Dame seems like a flu colony. Still, this is a special problem. Antibiotics won't help. It's a computer virus. 
I'm serious. My Macintosh, as nice as it is for composing columns like this one, is a health risk. It's the carrier of a horrible infection that is affiict­ing most of my section. They're missing classes, skipping meals and rarely sleeping. Worse, it mutates almost weekly, making it impossible to contain. As soon as the section builds up a resistance to one strain, say Tetris, another one appears. 
The newest variety is a super­virus that is virtually resistant to traditional treatment. It's called NFL Challenge, and gradepoints are falling. Conversations like this one are becoming typical: 
"This is amazing. It inter­cepted me five times-" 
Don't you have a midterm tomorrow?"What? Yeah, sure, but listen to this: Last week my 
starting  quarterback  gets  
injured on the first play!  Can  
you believe that?"  

Chuck Young Fresh Perspective 
It all started innocently enough. A guy down the hall put a copy of Risk into my computer and made a habit of playing. It wasn't long before he was hooked, and since a real good game of Risk requires two players. it was contagious. 
Soon someone was at the computer day and night. It was like having a third roommate. I started planning to write my papers during "Cheers," the only time I knew the Mac would be free. I even considered bor­rowing a Nintendo to distract them long enough for me to write my column. 
Understandably, for a while I thought they were possessed. I considered asking Father Griffin, who lives down the hall, to perform an exorcism on my computer's hard drive. He could earn a few bucks, sell the story to 60 Minutes, and maybe get his column syndicated. 
But after witnessing their ob­session for a few weeks. I de­termined that it must be a men­tal illness. What could I do? I 
tried calling Counseline, but they didn't have a tape for peo­ple with computer game addic­tions. 
I have a friend in Grace who ran into a similar problem. 
"My section was addicted," he told me. "I could be sleeping, studying, talking to my girl­friend, whatever, but someone was always playing Tetris. It wasn't malicious. They just couldn't stop. It was like rooming next to the LaFortune Anytime banking machine. 
"Anyway, one day I was trying to study and the noise from the game was driving me crazy. So I asked this guy, Greg, if he would please stop playing while I studied. He didn't pay any at­tention. Maybe he was so into the game he couldn't hear me. So I went up to the computer and shut it off-and he went nuts! 
He started beating on me. Not your normal male-bonding type of beating. A real pummeling. He kept hitting me and shouting about his high score. 
"It had gone too far. I deleted the game the next day. "Of course, now they play Risk." 
Risk is a computerized ver­sion of a famous boardgame that allows would-be war mon­gerers to conquer the world in the comfort of their very own living room. All the fun of rav­aging continents while destroy­ing thousands of your own people, without the hassles of living in underground bunkers and dodging enemy Smart mis­siles who outscored you on the S.A.T. 
During the war, Risk was re­ally popular in my dorm. The guys all wanted to be little Sadaam Husseins or George Bushes. I'm not sure which. I don't think they really cared. I talked to one of the five-star generals yesterday. 
"Hey, Chuck, do you want to play some racquetball?" 
Yeah, that sounds great, I said. (He was healed! He wanted to do something away from the computer.) 
"O.K. Let me go get it." He came back with a disk and loaded a game. The screen showed the rearview of a rac­quetball court and two players with racquets. 
"Here, you can serve. This is a great game. You can even hook up it up to a modem so you can play people in other dorms." 
Look out, ND. It's spreading. 
Ed. Note: Chuck's column appears every other Tuesday in The Observer. Honest.

Buffalo evens series in shoot out with Habs; Rangers and Penguins lose too 
(AP)-The Buffalo Sabres got even in the Adams Division semifinals by beating the Montreal Canadiens at pinball. 
The Sabres got more of the fortunate bounces Tuesday night as they beat the Canadiens 6-4 in a game that saw six of the 10 goals hit a de­fender's stick or skate before going into the net. Buffalo won its second straight home game to even the series after Montreal took the first two at The Forum. 
Buffalo led 3-2 after one pe­riod, with each of the five goals going into the net off a de­fender. Tony Tanti and Rob Ray added second-period goals for a 5-3 lead and Dale Hawerchuk scored on a third-period power play. 
Stephane Richer scored twice for the Canadiens. 
The teams have combined for 40 goals in four games, 10 more than they had in the Canadiens' six-game victory last year. 
The other Adams Division series is also even at two wins each. Hartford scored four times in the first 15:55 and held off Boston 4-3. 
Both Patrick Division series are also tied 2-2. Washington edged the New York Rangers 3­2 and New Jersey whipped Pittsburgh 4-1. 
The Norris and Smythe Division series resume on Wednesday night. In the Norris, it's Chicago at Minnesota and St. Louis at Detroit, while in the Smythe, Los Angeles is at Vancouver and Calgary visits Edmonton. The Blackhawks, Red Wings, Canucks and Oilers have 2-1 leads after winning on Monday night. 
ADAMS DIVISION Sabres 6, Canadiens 4 

Montreal took a 2-0 lead on deflected goals 16 seconds apart. But the breaks quickly evened out for the Sabres, who had three pucks hit Montreal defenders before going into the net. 
Tanti scored the first "clean" goal, beating substitute goal­tender Andre Racicot just 16 seconds into the second period with a wrist shot. 
Buffalo fired 43 shots at starter Patrick Roy and Racicot, who entered the game after Pierre Turgeon's weak backhander deflected off Montreal defenseman Alain Cote and past Roy at 12:30 of the first period, then left after Ray's goal 1:44 into the second period made it 5-2. 
Whalers 4, Bruins 3 

Hartford, which fell apart in the third period in Game 3 on Sunday night, held on this time after scoring all four of its goals in less than 16 minutes at the Civic Center. 
John Cullen had the Whalers' first goal and set up two by Mark Hunter for a 3-0 lead. After Dave Christian made it 3­1, Zarley Zalapski's goal at--------....... 
15:55 completed Hartford's scoring. 
Petri Skriko added Boston's second goal late in the first pe­riod and Ken Hodge cut the deficit to one goal with 5:32 left, but Peter Sidorkiewicz made several key saves to preserve the win.

goals from defensive specialist Dave Tippett and enforcer Alan May to beat the Rangers at the Capital Centre. 
Tippett set up Kevin Hatcher's game-tying goal 25 seconds into the first period after Bernie Nicholls' first-period goal gave New York an early lead. 
Tippett put the Caps ahead to stay at 15:31 and May's goal at 
9:27 of the final period -his first since December -proved to be the game-winner when Mark Janssens scored with 5:28 to play. 
Devils 4, Penguins 1 

New Jersey scored twice while totally dominating the first period, then held off Pittsburgh in the third at the Meadowlands. 
Claude Lemieux and Peter Stastny scored in a 55-second span during the first period, when New Jersey outshot Pittsburgh 15-3. Mario Lemieux cut the lead in half during a 5­on-3 power play at 4:41 of the third period, but Chris Terreri made 15 of his 28 saves in the final period. John MacLean and Claude Lemieux added late in­surance goals.

Arkansas to investigate basketball team Henderson attempts to 
break records in opener 
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) ­A University of Arkansas stu­dent-faculty board took dis­ciplinary action following its investigation of a sexual inci­dent involving four basketball players and a woman in an athletic dorm, officials said Tuesday. 
But details of the board's action were scarce a day after it was released to the players. 
University officials remained mum in the face of criticism that action against the players was taken slowly. They said federal law prohibits talking about disciplinary action, even in generalities. 
A 34-year-old Springdale woman who said she was sex­ually assaulted Feb. 27 in the school's athletic dorm impli­cated four members of the basketball team. The players admitted having sex with the woman but said she consented. Police said the woman was le­gally drunk. 
Prosecutor Andrew Ziser said the woman decided not to press charges and he said there wasn't enough evidence to prosneutn. 
Coach Nolan Richardson sus­pnnded playnr Darrell Hawkins for the first three games of next season for having a woman in his room. Hichardson refused to say if he disciplined the other playnrs. 
Ziser relnased two statements on Tuesday from men who said they saw the woman the night of the incident. A doorman at a bar rncalled the woman dancing with s1weral players and then leaving with Hawkins. 
And Harvey Bryant said the woman repeatedly invited him to have sex with her. 
The woman's lawyer, Doug Norwood, said the woman didn't pursue charges because the prosecutor made it clear he wasn't going to press charges. 
"She knew not to beat that dead horse," Norwood said. He said the woman may file a civil suit against the players, the university and possible its board of trustees. 
The woman told police she thought she consented with one player but didn't think consent had been granted for the others. 
Her original statement said 10 to 26 men were involved, but the only name she was sure of was Hawkins. At another time, according to the police report, she said she had sex with 15 people. 
The woman told police she was led downstairs about 4:30 
a.m. and thrown out of the dorm. 
Chancellor Dan Ferritor, in the face of criticism from the public and media, revealed last weekend that he urged athletic director Frank Broyles on Feb. 28 to have Richardson take strong and immediate action against the players involved. 
Jim Blair, chairman of the board of trustees, said the university would have been better served if Ferritor's recommendation had been fol­lowed. He said a coach -un­like anybody else connected with the university -can ig­nore due process and bench or suspend a player for any rea­son.

Blair said he has received 
letters and calls from people 
accusing the university going 
easy on the players. 
He said the thirst by some members of the public for ac­tion against the players re­sembled a lynch-mob mentality. He said racism played a part in the criticism. The players are black; the woman is white. 
Marshall Carlisle, who rep­resents one of the players, said he and lawyers for the other players were considering an appeal of the board's decision. 
"You and I both know we would not be concerned with an appeal unless some discipline has been issued by the J­board," Carlisle said. 
University spokesman Jim Treadway said the school was forbidden by the 197 4 Family Educational and Privacy Act from discussing the board's action at all. But he said some general information, including what type of action was taken, would be released after the appeals process is complete. 
Asked if the need for an ap­peal means disciplinary action was taken against the players, Treadway said: "I think that would be a safe thing to assume based on what I'm saying." 
The usual appeal process won't be followed in this case because Ferritor said he can't hear the players' appeals, if filed, Treadway said. Ferritor's daughter, Kim Wood, 27, is an academic counselor in the athletic department, and advised at least one of the players in preparation for the board's review, Treadway said. 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -The Minnesota Twins are Rickey Henderson's favorite team to run against. 
They also happen to be Oakland's opening night oppo­nent Tuesday, when the Ath­letics' leadoff man resumes his quest to become baseball's all­time base stealer, health permitting. 
Henderson, 32, needs just three more base thefts to over­take record-holder Lou Brock (938). He is one shy of "Sliding" Billy Hamilton, who stole 937 bases between 1888 and 1901, the year baseball's modern era began. 
Of Henderson's 936 steals over 11-plus years in the major leagues, 83 have come against the Twins. He also has swiped 14 off Jack Morris, the Twins' starting pitcher who left Detroit to join Minnesota as a free agent. 
Henderson has been bothered in recent days by tendinitis in his left shoulder but was ex­pected to play in the opener de­spite missing the A's last five exhibition games. 
"He has made progress every day, and I think he will be ready to play," A's manager Tony La Russa said after watching Henderson work out Monday. "He is a great player and he knows what ready means." 
Henderson. who has com­plained about the A's refusal to renegotiate his contract, was noncommittal. 
"We will see," he said. 
Henderson, last season's American League MVP, has had plenty of base-stealing oppor­tunities thanks to his hitting ability. He hit .325 last season, with 159 base hits and 28 home runs. 
He stole 65 bases and was caught just five times last sea­son. 
Minnesota catcher Brian Harper nabbed him on one of those occasions but Henderson has been successful against Harper 16 other times. 
The 14 bases Henderson stole while Morris was on the mound are second only to the 16 he has swiped against Floyd Bannister. 
Tuesday night's opener also marked the start of the Athletics' drive for a fourth consecutive AL title. 
Their starting pitcher, Dave Stewart, entered the game with wins in his last 19 starts in April dating to 1987.. Last year, he was 5-0 with a 1.32 ERA in April. 
The month of April also has been a big part of Oakland's success story. The A's have gone 48-20 in April over the past three seasons.

Tony Barone leaves Creighton to coach Texas A&M Creighton to begin search Barone becomes 4th coach in 2 years 
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Creighton University athletic director Dick Myers said Tuesday that the Bluejays will begin immediately to find a new basketball coach to replace Tony Barone, who resigned to take the job at Texas A&M. 
"I would like to have this thing resolved by the end of the week if we could," Myers said, hinting that he favored naming a new coach from Barone as­sistants Dick Fick and Rick Johnson. 
"We have two viable candi­dates here in Dick Fick and Rick Johnson and both have expressed an interest in the job. That doesn't eliminate an out­side search, however, and we are looking into the legal rami­fications that we would be re­quired to conduct an outside search," Myers said. 
"If you have a program that is doing well and Tony left for the right reasons, it makes sense to try to maintain continuity in the program if possible," Myers said. "My preference would be to stay internal if I feel we have qualified candidates and I think we do." 
Myers confirmed late Tuesday morning that Barone resigned to take the A&M job in College Station, Texas. 
"It is both a sad and happy day for Creighton University," Myers said. "Obviously, we are saddened that we are losing not just a great basketball coach but a tremendous human being in Tony Barone. We are happy for Tony and his family because it is a gre-at opportunity at Texas A&M." 
"The business that I'm in is not as logical or as consistent as one would like it to be," Barone said in a news release issued by Creighton. "The rea­son for me accepting the posi­tion at A&M is based on two things: Number one, it's time for me to leave. After six years it's just time to go and I can't give you a list of reasons as to why. Number two, this is a tremendous opportunity and you don't get many of them. I think A&M is one of the last 'sleeping giants' in intercolle­giate athletics." 
Fick said he wanted to be the Bluejays' next head basketball coach if Barone left. 
"If Tony is gone, obviously I'm very interested in the job," Fick said. "We've got great kids here. I've recruited most of them, and I would love to coach them." 
Fick, a graduate of Lewis (Ill.) University, has been Barone's top assistant in his six years at CU. Johnson, a Kearney State graduate, also has been on the Bluejay staff for six years, the last two as a full-time assistant. 
The Bluejays this past season won their second Missouri Valley Conference champi­onship and qualified for the NCAA tournament for a second time in three years. 
In his six seasons, Barone led Creighton to a 102-82 record, three straight 20-win seasons, two MVC regular season titles (1989 and 1991) and two MVC post-season tournament cham­pionships (1989 and 1991). The Bluejays played in the NCAA tournament in 1989 and 1991, and in the National Invitation Tournament in 1990. 
The 1990-91 team finished 24-8, setting a school record for wins in a season. 
"Creighton University has been the most enjoyable experi­ence in my coaching career," Barone said in the news re­lease. "For the last six years I've been fortunate to coach some of the finest young men I've ever been associated with." 
"He has made some tremen­dous strides with our basketball program over the last six years," Myers said. "He promised to bring the program to a 'Cadillac' level and he cer­tainly has done that." 
"We've made a lot of strides in the program and the way the kids come across in the com­munity," Fick said. 
Fick said Creighton signed four players to national letters of intent last November -Mike Amos, 6-foot-10 center, Min­netonka, Minn.; Jason Bey, 6-2 guard, Chicago; Neal Fitzger­ald, 6-5 forward, Naperville, Ill.; and Joel Frakes, 6-foot guard, Stevenson, Mich. 
"It's very important that we take care of the kids who are here and the kids we've signed," Fick said. 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -Tony Barone, pledging to guide the program toward national prominence, became Texas A&M's fourth head basketball coach in the past two seasons on Tuesday. 
"There are very, very few sleeping giants in this business and I don't think there's any question ... that this basketball job is a sleeping giant," said Barone, who led Creighton to three consecutive post-season appearances and 20-win sea­sons. 
Barone, 44, said the next level for the A&M program was to be among the top 25 teams in the nation. 
"I know you're going to jump on that as a statement, but I firmly believe that the potential of this club is in that particular realm," said Barone, who was given a five-year contract. 
Barone replaces Kermit Davis Jr., who led the Aggies to an 8­21 record in one season as head coach. Longtime coach Shelby Metcalf was dismissed during the 1989-90 season and replaced by assistant John Thornton. 
Davis, considered a young coach on the rise after a sue­

cessful stint at Idaho, replaced Thornton, but was forced to resign last month after a 3­month internal investigation uncovered eight NCAA rules violations. 
Barone said he would have no comment on the program's recent history. 
"If you would just indulge me I'd like to look to the future," Barone said. "The past is one of those things I have no opinions about. I have no knowledge of anything that went on here. That's good for me." 
Barone was the only one of five candidates interviewed by athletic director John David Crow. 
Barone said he felt no added scrutiny about the possibility of an NCAA probation over the violations. 
"The NCAA rules are set up and there are no shading of the rules so I don't see that as any extra scrutiny," he said. "I do a real good job with things I can control. I do a really poor job with things I can't control. What we need to do is move on." 
Barone said he was familiar with some of the coaches in the Southwest Conference, including Texas' Tom Penders, Houston's Pat Foster and Rice's Scott Thompson. 

''I've had a relationship with Tom Penders in the past and I'm sure it will get worse as time goes by," he said. 
The Aggies ended last season with nine scholarship players from Davis' program. Three non-scholarship players round­ed out the roster. 
Barone said he would con­centrate on bringing in players who would compete both in the classroom and on the court. 
"I don't think it's unusual to expect your kids to go to class and be competitive in the classroom," Barone said. "I have a blueprint and I hope the blueprint is a good one and we're going to use it here at TexasA&M." 
The Aggies 8-21 season this year was only the third 20-loss season in the 79-year history of the program and the first since 1955. Under Metcalf the Aggies won six Southwest Conference titles in 27 seasons. 
Texas A&M is scheduled to build a new $3 5 million, 14,500-seat arena in the next two years.

+American Red Cross 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) There were echoes of St. Andrews in 1984 as Tom Watson and Seve Ballesteros sat side by side at the Augusta National Golf Club course. 
''I'm playing well enough to win," Watson said after a practice round for the 55th Masters. 
"I feel good about my game, good about the week, good about my chances," Ballesteros said Tuesday with more than a touch of his old, long-missing confidence. 
"I do not care about finishing second or third or fifth, like has been happening to me the last five or six years," Ballesteros said. 
"I have a feeling my time must come soon." 
The optimistic statements from both players were unso­licited and, in view of their recent performances, some­thing of a surprise. 
Each has been in a slump, Watson one of epic proportions and Ballesteros in a something milder low. 
But each was sounding, and acting, very much as they did seven years ago when they hooked up in a stretch duel on the Old Course at St. Andrews, 
Watson and Ballesteros ready 
when Ballesteros denied Watson's bid for a third consecutive British Open title. 
This time it is Nick Faldo of England who is going for three in a row, an unprecedented third consecutive Masters title. 
And the tall Englishman with the elegant, repeating stroke is on Watson's short list of those likely to succeed on the difficult, undulating greens of Augusta National. 
"You have to go with the players who are playing well at the moment," Watson said, looking ahead to the Thursday start of the first of the year's four major championships. 
"(Ian) Woosnam is playing very well," Watson said. 
"Seve is swinging well again. 
"Faldo is playing well. 
"Greg Norman, he's about ready to do well here. They've been writing him ofT. When that happens, good players tend to come back strong. 
"And that's my short list," Watson said. 
With the exception of himself, all are foreign-born: Ballesteros from Spain, Woosnam from Wales, Faldo from England, Norman from Australia. 
Pressed for some American choices, Watson added: "(Paul) Azinger, Rocco Mediate both are playing awfully well. 
"And," he said, "there's Old Folks, Jack (Nicklaus). He won at 46. He can win again. Jack's playing well. 
"And the thing about him is that he doesn't make many mistakes." 
Ballesteros, winner of two Masters and three British Opens but in a mild decline for the past couple of years, had a much shorter list. 
"Jose Maria Olazabal," Seve said of his fellow Spaniard. "He's the best player in the world." 
There was a long pause be­fore he continued. 
"It would be too bad for him to finish second after me," Ballesteros said, and shrugged. 
"It has been quite a long time since I have felt this good about my game, about my mood, about my chances," he said. 
"My confidence is very high." 
So is Watson's. 
"I feel good about the year," he said. "I've only played two bad rounds all year, in Los Angeles and in the last round of the Players' Championship. 
But his putting, the five-time British Open winner admitted, remains questionable. 
''I'm OK on the long putts. The short ones, well, I still have some trouble. I tend to freeze over them sometimes," said Watson, who won this title in 1977 and 1981. 
"I think I can beat it," he said. "It's a matter of being in competition and putting it to the test." 
Watson, who won his last major title in 1983 and nothing at all since 1987, has shown hints he is on the rebound with a second-place finish at Phoenix, a top-1 0 at New Orleans, a spot among the contenders until the poor last round of the Players. 
"It's getting closer," he said. 
Fiji government makes next Monday holiday 
SUVA, Fiji (AP) -The gov­ernment of this South Pacific island nation declared next Monday a national holiday as a tribute to its rugby team. 
The Fiji rugby union team has won tournaments this season in Hong Kong, Scotland and Australia. It beat New Zealand in the final of the Hong Kong tournament last month. 
Minister for Information Hatu Inoke Kubuabola said Tuesday the international success of the sevens team deserved the tribute of a national holiday and an official program to commemorate the occasion. 
"The Hong Kong final was a spectacular victory for Fiji but was also a tremendous boost for our country's image," he said.

Boxer in Florida 
dies after debut as professional 
OCALA, Fla. (AP) -A boxer who collapsed after losing his professional debut died Tues­day -the first fight fatality under the jurisdiction of the Florida State Athletic Com­mission. 
Alan Lonnie Goldstein, 26, had been in critical condition since undergoing more than three hours of brain surgery at Munroe Regional Medical Center soon after the fight Sunday. 
Bill Mansfield, the hospital's director of public relations, said Goldstein died of brain damage apparently inflicted during the fight. Doctors said the boxer suffered massive bleeding. .. Don Hazelton, executive di­rector of the state commission, said the blow that caused Goldstein's death couldn't be pinpointed. 
"Six months ago, six years ago, the first punch of the fight, the last punch of the fight -we have no idea," Hazelton said from his office in Tallahassee. 
Goldstein, a middleweight who had recently moved to Miami from Indianapolis, fought 36 amateur fights. His pay for Sunday's four-round bout was $200. 
Hazelton said the commission will await findings from the Marion County medical ex­aminer. He said the death was Florida's first in professional boxing since the commission was founded in 1984. 
Goldstein's manager for the past two months was Mike Dundee, a member of one of boxing's most famous families. Dundee said his fighter was in excellent shape going into the bout and appeared to be OK when it ended. 
"All he had was a slight bloody nose and the start of black eye," Dundee said. "When the guy upstairs rolls the dice, there's nothing I can do." 
Pitted against Richie Smith of Miami, who went into the fight with an 0-4 record, Goldstein began to tire in the second round and was knocked down twice, Hazelton said. Goldstein recovered to win the third round on each judge's card, then went down again late in the fourth round but quickly got back up as the fight ended. 
"What it was was two tired young kids at the end," Dundee said. 
"(Goldstein) came to the corner and he was standing up. I began to take his gloves off and he started to fall to the canvas. I couldn't get the stool under him because it was so unexpected. At that point he became comatose." 
The bout was part of a six­... fight card at the Ocala Hilton. Hazelton did not attend but said reports he received left him confident that the Goldstein-Smith bout was con­ducted properly. 
"It went textbook the way it's supposed to go," he said.

High school maintenance man gets to live fantasy 
SANFORD, Fla. (AP) ­Fantasy collided with reality as high school maintenance man Randy Harvey bellowed "Saaaafe" in his first call as a major league umpire on open­ing day at Detroit's Tiger Stadium. 
Harvey normally is mowing a baseball field on a weekday afternoon, not making major­league calls on one. Harvey, 30, is a groundskeeper at Lake Mary High School when not calling high school and college baseball games. 
But on Monday, he got the thrill of a lifetime as the second base umpire for the Tigers-New York Yankees game, won by Detroit 6-4. 
Baseball had to turn to old­timers and college umpires as substitutes for the striking umps. An agreement was reached early Monday but it was too late to prevent substi" tutes from working most open­ing day games. 
"It's a day I'll never forget," said Harvey. He didn't have much time to be nervous. 
Yankee slugger Don Mattingly came sliding into second base on a steal attempt in the first inning, and Harvey unhesitatingly called him safe. Tiger shortstop Alan Trammell, taking the throw, jumped up, stared at the ump and said, "Great call." 

"It felt good on that first play with Trammell saying 'Great call,"' Harvey said. "Hey, he was letting me know I was doing my job. 
Trammell and Mattingly might have had second thoughts if they had known Harvey never attended umpire school. 
"Not only was I the only re­placement guy who never went to ump school, I'm the only black," Harvey said. 
He cited his experience in the defunct Senior Professional Baseball League for providing him an opportunity to work in the majors. 
"A couple of general man­agers wrote and praised my work," he said. 
The longtime dream was nearly quashed when the labor settlement was reached, but it came too late for the regular umpires to reach the ballparks. 
"He was about as excited as a boy can get when they told him he was going," said Oscar Merthie, 69, Harvey's grandfa­ther. 
Merthie and his wife, Lillie, who raised Harvey since he was 3 months old, shared the mo­ment. 
"Now he has done it all: Little League, high school, college, Senior League and pro ball," Oscar Merthie said. 
Retired American League umpire Bill Deegan, who worked the plate and headed Harvey's crew on Monday, said he "liked Randy the first time I saw him work. He had the size (6-foot, 235 pounds) and the voice. He doesn't show timidity. He could work in the bigs." 
For Harvey, getting back to reality will be difficult.
