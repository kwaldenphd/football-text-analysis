Students protest parietals with campout 
. Protest draws 300 students to South Quad 
ByPATMcELWEE News Wrirer 
Sleeping bags were unrolled on South Quad Monday night as students vowed to stake out a claim to respect on the issue of parietals extension. They planned to spend the night outdoors in protest of what many see as an unwillingness among administration officials to take student viewpoints and concerns seriously. 
Students began drifting into the section of South Quad cor­doned off by Notre Dame Security/Police around 9:30 
p.m. The three students responsible for obtaining per­mission to hold the protest from the Office of Student Affairs -Seth Whetzel, Adam Graham and Mike Praff ­were the first on the scene. 
At one point, as many as 300 protesters were on the quad. 
Whetzel saw the protest as a way to overcome what he calls a vicious cycle. 
"You hear a lot about the student body being apathetic," Whetzel said. "But I don't think it's apathy as much as an inherent sense of frustra­tion. Students voice their opin­ion to the administration, and then it's ignored or even squashed. Next time, you don't want to waste your time." 
Similar feelings of frustra­tion were expressed by Stuart Greene, a professor with a seat on both the Faculty Senate and the Campus Life Council. He came out in sup­port of the student protest. 
"I think [the protest] repre­sents a real frustration among the students that they're not being heard, and if they're heard, they're not being lis­tened to," Greene said. 
Many students brought blan­kets and some came with

INSIDE COLUMN 

For Mom and Dad 
Today, my parents celebrate their 25th wed­
ding anniversary. 

On the first day of May, 1976, my mother and father stood together in the of sight of God, their families and their friends to profess their love for one another as they took the vows of marriage. In the presence of all gath­ered in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart that Saturday, they pledged their commit­ment to one another and promised to face together whatever joys and sorrows life might send their way. 
Today, 25 years later, they continue to stand by one another, representing love, faithfulness and gen­uine mutual respect. In a word, I believe they are a model of all a strong mar­riage should be. 

Through their relationship with one another, my parents have taught me what it means to give oneself to another human being. 
My mother told me once that if she had known how my father would change and what type of man he would evolve to be 25 years later. her then-25-year-old self might not have married him in the first place. But love is a choice as much as an emotion, she explains, and that choice means that she accepts each unexpected fault together with each newfound strength. At the end of the day she finds that her marriage is not exactly what her 25-year­old self envisioned, but she regrets nothing. 
My father regularly visits Notre Dame for board meetings and has done so since my freshman year here. Not one of these visits goes by without my dad commenting how much this University has impacted his life. But it is not the education he received here, the pres­tige of being an alumnus or the excitement of being able to come back for football weekends that is causes him to cast such a sentimental eye on his years under the dome. 
Notre Dame is important to him, he tells me at each visit, because "It gave me your moth­er." It is always my mother who is the first rea­son why he is grateful for his time here. Indeed. my father has always shown a genuine appreciation for my mother and expressed a belief that he has been blessed to be able to share his life with her. 
These are just the two examples that stand out most in my mind of the ways in which I have witnessed my parents' devotion to one another through the years. There are many more. 
For the past 25 years, there has been no 'I,' in my parents relationship -only "we." They have worked together, laughed together, cried together. succeeded together. failed together and overcome together. They have challenged one another to become more than either could be alone, and they have buHt a Hfe that neither would exchange for any of their childhood dreams. And they have done all this by holding fast to the vows they shared with one another, 25 years ago. 
Nothing that I can write here will every fully express the admiration I have for my parents, today and every day. I can only say thank you, Mom and Dad, and congratulations.

U. Illinois students protest campus paper 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 

Students marched to the Illini Media Company parking lot Friday to protest The Daily lllini's decision to publish a controversial advertisement against reparations for slavery. 
The protesters. members of a large­ly black student group called The Initiative, said the advertisement is racist and that the DI promoted dis­crimination on campus by running it. 
"The way that you all have handled this has been unprofessional and dis­respectful and adverse to the initia­tives and goals of the UIUC adminis­tration," said Clay Garrett, law stu­dent and member of The Initiative. "The University has strived to pro­mote diversity and remove hostility from this campus, and the DI has gone and undone that." 

The advertisement, "Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery is a Bad Idea -and Racist Too," was written and paid for by David Horowitz, a right-wing political activist who was formerly associated with the Black Panthers and now believes repara­tions are racist. The ad suggested that reparations have already been paid and that blacks owe a debt to the United States. 
Members of The Initiative gathered on the Quad midday Friday to rally before the march. The group then marched to 57 E. Green St., the park­ing lot of the Illini Media Company. the parent company of the DI. There, the group attempted to present its demands and speak to DI Editor-in­Chief Kat Schwartz. Among other things. The Initiative demanded a printed apology or retraction for the running of the Horowitz ad. 
The decision to run the ad was made by Andrew Savikas, who ended his term as Editor-in-Chief in March. 
Savikas said he chose to run the ad because he believes in a marketplace of ideas and allowing all opinions to be heard.

Researchers find SAT link 
MINNEAPOLIS 

University researchers analyzing the validity of the widely used Scholastic Aptitude Test presented their findings to the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology Saturday in San Diego, Calif. After compar­ing SAT scores with a student's first-year grade point average at a variety of two and four year colleges, researchers determined that test scores correlate with a student's performance in college. "We located inore than 1,700 studies, representing over a million students, that had looked at how well SAT scores predicted first-year grade point average," said Sarah Hezlett, manager of the research team and a University of Minnesota graduate student. "People who do better on the test have higher GPAs in their first year of college," she said. Hezlett said the SAT predicts GPA for a student's later college years, along with study habits, persistence and degree attain­ment. Researchers compared SAT scores with state nursing board exam scores, finding that the SAT pre­dicts success in entering the nursing profession.

Tension remains high with police 
COLUMBUS, Ohio 
Ohio State University students once again faced off against the Columbus Division of Police during the early­morning hours Sunday in two separate disturbances. The events followed a riot April 21 and massive preventive efforts by Ohio State. The events that led up to rioting began escalating on East Norwich Avenue when students overflowed into the street. blocking traffic. Several peo­ple surrounded a car, rocking it while the gathering crowd of spectators chanted 'Tip it! Tip it!" and threw bottles. Throngs of people lined both sides of the street. 
jeering and throwing bottles as nearly 80 police officers dressed in full riot gear assembled at the comer of Norwich Avenue and Indianola Avenue. "This is ridicu­lous. They all should be thrown out of school," said Interim Vice President for Student Affairs Bill Hall, as he watched the crowd grow. Columbus Police gathered on Indianola, and the police began to move down the street around 1:35 a.m., dispersing the crowd with tear gas, knee-knockers and flash grenades.

Peace Corps denies inadequacies 
ByTIMLOGAN Senior Staff Writer 
The Peace Corps defended its efforts Monday to locate missing volunteer Walter Poirier, a 2000 Notre Dame graduate who disappeared in Bolivia Feb. 22, and pledged to continue look­ing until he is found. 
In a state­ment released Monday, the organization said that FBr 

Poirier

investigators had praised the Bolivian government and police's methods and dedication in the search for Poirier, which began March 5. 
"We are pleased with the FBl's as.sessment of the investigation to date," said Otarles Baquet III, acting director of the Peace Corps. "We continue to share in the frustration and anguish of the Poirier family that the investigation and search has yet to yield useful infor­mation regarding Poirier's where­abouts." 
The statement came in response to Poirier's congressman, Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) who has criticized the efforts. He called them "haphazard" and co­signed the letter with Massachusetts senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry. Two weeks ago, Meehan asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to put FBI investigators on the case. On April 19, six were. 
Meehan specifically criticized investi­gators' failure to transcribe interview tapes and access Poirier's Yahoo! e­mail account to look for clues to his whereabouts. The Peace Corps state­ment addressed Lhe e-mail question. 
"Early in the investigation, the Peace Corps attempted to gain access to Walter Puirier's e-mail account," Baquet said. "We have been unable to do so, however, as his right to privacy is protected by the law unless there is evi­dence ofa crime." 
There has been much speculation in the media, and by Puirier's parents, that the volunteer was kidnapped. or perhaps was killed in a mudslide. The Peace Corps noted that there is no evi­dence supporting either scenario. Its statement did not suggest any scenario at all. 
Investigators have very few hard facts to go on. They know he was last seen on Feb_. 22, at a meeting with his pro­gram director in La Paz, Bolivia's capi­tal. Poirier was working on eco-tourism development and regularly traveled between La Paz and several different villages in the Zongo Valley, two hours away. Poirier's wallet was found in his home, but that is not unusual, as Peace Corps volunteers often travel without their wallets, according to Susan Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the organization. 
The investigation has included ground and river searches and ongoing questioning of those who knew or might have encountered Poirier. Investigators have monitored hospitals, jails, transportation centers and border crossing-s since he was declared missing March 5. The volunteer's picture has been broadcast ,on Bolivian television and printed in newspapers, and the Peace Corps has offered a reward for information that might help the search.Poirier arrived in Bolivia in June and spent his first three months receiv­ing training in language and life skills. He began work in August. 
The two months he has been missing is the longest period of time any volun­teer has been unaccounted for in the organization's history. according to Buchanan.

[University meal plan}." said sophomore guard Karen Swanson. 
Like the football and the basketball teams, the base­ball student-athletes try to balance their time on and off the field -and are some­times left with little time for meals. 
"We get a lot of team meals together at the clubhouse." said freshman baseball play­er Javier Sanchez. "If our game ends at 8 p.m., we just have sandwiches in the lock­er room." 
Most athletes' entire after­noons are spent at practice, yet they still need to accom­plish the academic workload of any other student.

Some University professors are understanding of an ath­lete's schedule, while others are not.

who have a reputation for being very flexible with rigor­ous schedules," said Karen Swanson sophomore basket­ball player. 
Student-athletes also have tutors at their disposal, for any subject in which they might need help. This is to make -sure that each athlete stays afloat academically. 
"We get a lot of help with tutoring. I can tell my advisor who I want for tutoring for any subject," said sophomore fencer Matt Fabrican. "If I have a CORE paper due, I could go to them, but I basi­cally use it for math." 
Along with course advising, student-athletes are also guaranteed the first two days of DARTing so that their aca­demic and athletic schedules do not conflict. 
Once in the class, many student-athletes cannot meet every deadline while traveling or participating in tournaments. Like other students, student-athletes ask for extensions when needed. Some teachers will work with the students when tests and papers con­flict with athletic events. 

"During March Madness I maybe went to school three days this entire run. [The professors) organized the make-up midterm exam. giving me extensions with the work due and even helping through the email," said senior women's bas­ketball guard Imani Dunbar. 
Because of the demand­ing schedules, the academ­ic advisors direct athletes to certain professors who will be more accommodat­ing. 

During the first semester. Swanson did not take advantage of her advisor and she had a bad experi­ence. After that experience, she feels that it's necessary to consult her advisor. "It can make or break your 
academic success," said Swanson. 
However, at the same time, athletes might abuse their professors' willingness to accommodate them with assignments and tests. Some student athletes will say they're going on a tourna­ment just to get out of a test or paper, said Fabricant. But Swanson disagrees. 
"I've never done that and I've never seen that [abuse on extensions]." 
Many students, be it athlete or not. receive extensions on their papers if they have a good excuse. Student-athletes take advantage of this oppor­tunity when their schedules leave them with less time to complete the assignments or study for a test. 
"I feel like a lot of these athletes go to these profes­sors more than the regular student," said Battle. "I did poorly on my second test. I didn't understand the materi­al and I had more work in other classes so he let me take the test again."

to contribute as much during group work. 
"Yeah, to the point it's not a perk [to be an athlete). people don't want this person in my group -nobody wants to be viewed as a dumb jock -I see academics as impor­tant as athletics -if you just write me off that's your loss," said Dunbar. 
Student-athletes see that other students have much more time to complete assignments while they hard­ly have time for practice, dinner and the coursework. Although some students might think that athletes have it easier in class, some would disagree. 
"I think it's a burden on me [as a student athlete] because of the time con­
straints. [The students] are more ahead of the game," said Sanchez. "They can go to the library at normal times -they can do these things. Whether they do these things or not is anoth­er thing." 
Books 
In August and January, students run in and out of the bookstore, complaining about the $300 or so that they just spent on books they probably won't read. 
They pace back and forth between the rows of books, searching for each class's required texts. Scholarship student-athletes need just to walk towards the student­athletes section of the book­store. 
"They've checked your schedule and they pull the books that you need and then they have it set aside in boxes," said Swanson. "You do have to return them, but you save so much money ­and they're all brand-new." 
Along with books, academ­ic services supply student­athletes with laptops so they can complete their work on 
the road.

Student-athletes are seen in a different light because tof the emphasis on sports at Notre Dame. 
"The main difference is that people look at you in a more favorable light. In a classroom, the teachers say it's OK to give that person an extension because she's an athlete," said Swanson. "People are more willing to accept if you have a few shortcomings." 
Local establishments around town have the Women's Basketball poster up. so they recognize the women. Because of NCAA restrictions, the women can not get discounts, but the people treat them really well. 
"Even if you're trying to get on campus, they say, 'oh, it's a woman basketball player.' We just get the wave to go ahead." said Swanson, "I feel bad saying that because people have major issues getting on campus with their cars, but that's how it is."

But some athletes resent the "dumb jock" image that is placed on student-athletes because for some, acade­mics are just as important as sports. 
"Professors understand that student-athletes also scored 1300 or 1400 on their SATs, but then there are some that need the extra help to make it," said Battle. 
Some student-athletes might need the extra acade­mic help from academic ser vices and from their own professors. Other students also know that athletes trav­el a good part of the year and that they won't be able

Socialists lose in Senegal election: 
Allies of Senegal's president claimed victory Monday in weekend legislative elections, wrest­ing control of parliament from the 40-year grip of the opposition Socialists. Unofficial results compiled by independent and government media appeared to back the claims by the rul­ing coalition of President Abdoula.ye Wade. 
Junta in talks with opposition: 
Myanmar's ruling junta said Monday it was pursuing reconciliation with democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, insisting the overtures to the Nobel Peace Prize winner were not a "public relations stunt." The statement was the clearest sign yet of the junta's desire to end the political deadlock since the generals refused to hand over power to Suu Kyi's party after it won gen­eral elections in 1990.

ISLAM QALA 
Tens of thousands of anguished Afghans fleeing drought and war are being turned away by neighbor­ing nations or forcibly returned to an inhos­pitable land where half a million people are refugees in their own country. 
The United Nations warns that the result will be catastrophic. 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers, arrived in Afghanistan on Monday from Iran, and made a tor­turous three-hour road journey from the Iranian border to Herat in western Afghanistan. 
Lubbers said on arrival that it is crucial that fight­ing stop between the rul­ing Taliban militia and rebels led by Ahmed Shah Massood so that refugees can return to their coun­try. 
"We think it is really insane ,to see the drought and the miserable condi­tions in Afghanistan and you still go on fighting," he said. "My plea to both the Taliban and to commander Massood will be to stop fighting at least for six months or one year to give us an opportunity to help." 
He said the United Nations would like to see more aid but "it is too sim­ple to blame the interna­tional community. There is a sort of hopelessness because there have been so many diplomatic and foreign missions and still the fighting continues." 
Lubbers was driven up to the border in a white Mercedes and then walked across the frontier, a deso­late, barren, wind-swept desert where dozens of trucks loaded with fruit, sugar and tires roll across into Afghanistan. 
He was met by a Taliban guard of honor and U .N. officials. A small boy pre­sented a red flower to the former Dutch prime minis­ter. 
Taliban deputy minister for martyrs and refugees, Rehmatullah Wahidyar, told reporters that they need camps "so that there will not be any more need for our people to cross into Iran and into Pakistan." 
Most of those at the Safed Sang camp in Iran, which Lubbers visited, are likely to be deported. 
The Iranian government has deported 20,000 Afghan refugees this year, said Hans-Christian Poulsen, U.N. regional coordination officer in Herat, in western Afghanistan.

nurse calls others to action 
By MYRA McGRIFF Saint Mary's Editor 
Mary Lightfine brought the volunteer organization Doctors Without Borders to life Monday during a presentation of her work at Saint Mary's. The longtime volunteer nurse explained the aim of the project and passion for the work through slides and stories of her expe­rience. 
Lightfine hoped to reach out and convince her audience that caring for others was a vital part in improving conditions around the globe. 
"l want to get you to care about the world, care about your neighbor. Take that step to learn more," said Lightfine. 
Lightfine began by discussing her dream of going to Africa, and her wish to help people. These passions pro­pelled her into nursing and, in 1993, the program of

She told the story of a dying man that walked to the refugee camp and the only help she could offer was a bath. The man's wife chanted while washing and an interpreter present told Llghtfine the women was saying "God bless you." 
"I said don't God bless me, God bless you," Lightfine said. "This is my job; you carried him here. I gave her hope and I gave him some dignity."

stereos, playing Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead and other bands reminiscent of the protest era of the 1960s and '?Os. As midnight approached. more and more students began to emerge from the comfort of their dorm rooms to the grassy area around South Quad's flagpole. 
The group of nine on the Quad at 10 p.m. grew to about 100 at 11 :30 and to about 200 at midnight. Many of the campers were expected to remain on the quad until the sleepout's 10 a.m. end today. 
The students spent time together, even fe}l asleep together -activities they could not do in their dorm rooms under the current visit­ing hour regulations. 
Brooke Norton, student body president, attended the protest and was happy with the turnout. 
"I think the students have shown unity tonight. It's a really important thing that they've come together to sup­port this cause," Norton said. 
Several priests also ma.de appearances in support of the campout. 
All students in the area, however. did not support the protest or agree that parietal hours should be extended. One biology major, walking through the area, complained that an extension would make it more difficult for those who want to study or sleep. 
"It's frustrating when you need to study and others in easier majors are having a drinking party. It really puts people in a difficult situation to be the loser that studies and has to go into a room and say, 'Guys. can you quiet down?' It really makes you the bad guy, and I don't think that's fair," said the student, wishing to remain anonymous. 
Others criticized the motives of the protest, drawing com­parisons to the current Harvard sit-in demanding a living wage for Harvard work­ers. The issue of parietals extension was seen as much more inconsequential. 
Whetzel addressed this, say­ing, "At Harvard, they're a lot more open and they allow their students to do things like this." 
Parietals are the 
overnight protest. 
A letter also ran in yester­days Viewpoint section outlin­ing the organizers position and calling on students to sleep uut in protest. 
Notre Dame's police force planned to have an enhanced staff available last night, but would not give an exact num­ber of officers. Rex Rakow, director of Notre Dame Security/Police, said that offi­cers would do whats neces­
sary to  keep the peace and

Last night's protest was organized in response to a vote in the Campus Life Council (CLC) last week that went against a student-spon­sored resolution on parietals extension. 
The vote divided between students and faculty in favor and rectors and Bill Kirk, the only administrator on the council, against. 
The failed resolution stated support for extending pari­etals one hour from midnight to 1 a.m. on weekdays. 
A similar resolution was passed by the _CLC supporting an extension of parietals on weekday mornings -from 10

There were four officers sta­tioned on the

"I've been here 14 years, and I've learned that we've got the greatest students in the world," said Officer Dan Kavanaugh. "When they believe strongly in something, they know the right way to go about it." 
Notre Dame landscaping had planned to run the sprinkler system for thl:l first time around 10:30 p.m., but promised to shut them off upon learning of the planned protest.

Saint Mary's creates new academic theme

Saint Mary's College will be "Crossing Borders and Crossing Boundaries" in the 2000-2001 school year. 
As this academic calendar comes to a close, a commit­tee of personnel at Saint Mary's has decided on next year's academic theme. "Crossing Borders and Crossing Boundaries." The committee consisted of pro­fessors and staff from the First Year of Studies Office, the Office of Academic Affairs, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and Leaders of a New Indiana.

The theatre department has already agreed to par­ticipate in the with the play they choose to perform in the coming academic year. It will push its audience to think beyond the conven­tional norm. 
This metaphor of crossing borders and boundaries may be used beyond the class­room with events around campus. 
"The beauty {of this theme] is that it can provide a lens for all students to look through when visiting the art gallery, attending the spiritual lecture series and Multicultural Affairs lecture series. "Crossing Borders and Crossing

Ex Corde is a Catholic necessity 

Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the constitution on Catholic higher education issued by John Paul II in 1990. will go into effect in the United States this month. The Vatican and the American Catholic bishops have worked out an 
application of Ex Corde to the United States which emphasizes dia logue rather than confrontation. 
The requirements of Ex Corde as spelled out in the bishops' 


Application are Charles E. Rice hardly oppres­sive. The contro­versy has focused Right or on the rights of Wrong?faculty and of the universities them­selves. But Ex Corde and the applica­tion are really a students' bill of rights. The local bishop has a duty to "watch over the ... Catholic character of the university." The bishops do not run the place but "they should be ... participants in the life of the Catholic university." The bishop is concerned with the rights of all involved, includ­ing students: "Catholic students have a right to ... instruction in authentic Catholic doctrine and practice [and) to be provided with opportunities to practice the faith." Students' rights are implicated also in the requirement that "The university should strive to ... appoint Catholics as professors so that, to the extent possible, those committed to the witness of the faith will constitute a majority of the facul­ty. All professors are expected to be ... committed to the Catholic mission and identity of their institutions." 
The most controversial point in the application is that "Catholics who teach the theological disciplines in a Catholic university are required to have a mandatum granted by compe tent ecclesiastical authority." The mandatum is not an appointment. It acknowledges merely that a Catholic theology professor "is a teacher with in the full communion of the Catholic Church." 
All these requirements protect stu­dents' rights through the principle of truth in labeling. A university that claims to be "Catholic" ought to be such as that term is defined by the pope, the only person on earth with the authority to define it conclusively. But what will be the effect of Ex Corde? It is fair to speculate that, in addition to the emerging technologies of "distance education," potential stu­dents will have four main alternatives: 
1. Some major Catholic colleges and universities will reject Ex Corde for­mally or in practice. Some will be committed to the model of the secular research university, especially in fac­ulty and student recruitment. 
They may have a Catholic presence and student groups and individual faculty with Catholic interests. They will profess their "Catholic" character, especially to potential Catholic donors. But the evidence of that character will become anecdotal and marginal because the institution will be cut off from active communion with the Church. Those "Catholic Lite" univer­sities will be pretentious and expen­sive. They will retain an upscale con stituency. But for those who want the real Catholic thing, they will not be worth the money. As secular, they will never be among the best. As "Catholic," they will become irrele­vant. 
2. 
Some Catholic colleges and uni­versities, including some major research universities, will accept Ex Corde and will seriously try to imple­ment it. 

3. 
Institutions such as Franciscan University of Steubenville, Christendom College, Ave Maria University, Thomas Aquinas College in California and others enthusiastically accept fix Corde. They offer on a smaller scale an excellent Catholic lib­eral acts education at a much lower 


cost than the major institutions. 
4. Catholic centers at secular insti tutions may be a window on the future, enabling students to integrate their studies into a Catholic intellectu­al and spiritual life. For in-state stu­dents at state universities, this may be a way to achieve a sound Catholic for­mation without heavy debt. One example is the Newman Foundation at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. where 12,000 of the 35,000 students are Catholic. The Foundation includes St. John's Catholic Chapel, the Newman Library· for research and study, residence halls for men and for women, with a dining hall, computer lab and 350 stu dents in residence, and four religion courses which students may take for university credit. The chapel seats 800, with six Masses on Sunday and three each weekday, including a Spanish Mass. 
Such centers fill a need, especially for non-wealthy Catholic students. 
"It is certainly easier," said Father Hesburgh two decades ago, "just to be a great university, and not to worry about being a Catholic university as well." But the great universities were Catholic in their origin. Only a Catholic university can really be great, because, as Ex Corde put it, "by its Catholic character a university is made more capable of conducting an impartial search for truth, a search that is neither subordinated to nor conditioned by particular interests of any kind." 
This is a time for choosing, for truth in labeling, requiring every college or university that claims to be "Catholic" to put up or shut up.

suddenly attuned me to the fact that the presence of boys in my room for another hour during the week would completely enrich my life, along with solving gender issues on campus. What boy wouldn't respect me more if he could stay long enough to watch not only Almost Famous but also half of Dirty Dancing? Clearly, no guy would sexually assault or disparage a girl with such amazing powers of procrasti­nation -especially if she wasn't even in the room with him (because she was at Lafortune or the library or a charming off­campus establishment). 
What was wrong with me? I have no idea -but I do know that I owe this exemplary young woman my heart-felt gratitude. Without her loving input, I may well have made the horrendous mistake of personally deciding that I can deal with parietals and should really write some of the 40 pages I have due on Wednesday instead of sitting on South Quad all night. Her deferential and polite response to my choice to turn down her flier sharply contrasted with the appalling lack of respect that administrators show for student opinion. To my mystery savior: thank you so much for helping to encourage respectful dialogue at Notre Dame.

Understanding ultimate and those who play it 


In his personification of a frisbee that appeared in yesterday's edition of The Observer, Jeff Baltruzak wrote in a column, 'Tm associated with people that don't ever wear shoes and go to Phish concerts all the time. Maybe that's why ultimate hasn't become a major sport. Football players all wear cleats after all." 
Over the past four years. there have been recurrent references, both in Scholastic and The Observer, to the Notre Dame ultimate team as bare­foot, longhaired, pot-smoking degen­erates who litter the quad like empty Heineken bottles after a Phish concert. 
Although I expect that few people (apart from those that are close friends of members of both the men's and women's teams) are aware, both squads traveled this past weekend to Ohio State University to participate in the regional tournament. Regionals consist of the top 16 teams from Ohio, Illinois and Indiana competing for two bids to the national tournament, held in Boston on Memorial Day weekend. My hopes to make back-to-back appearances at nationals ended yes­terday when we lost a tight game 17­16 to OSU. 
As a team, we have been training and practicing since September and have traveled to tournaments from Stanford University to UNC­Wilmington nearly every weekend since spring break. In contrast to the implications of Mr. Baltruzak, we did not invest all of that time and travel those distances to frolic around bare­foot or get stoned. 
To return to Notre Dame the day after a heartbreaking loss that ended our season to find that the University paper has printed such remarks is both saddening and terribly insulting. 
lf I were to write a column to The Observer, even in jest, criticizing the appearance of the Notre Dame football team or comparing them to the legion of kids who toss footballs around after class, I doubt it would take more than an hour before my car was vandalized, the windows in my house broken and my personal safety threatened. The simple fact is that I would never do such a thing. 
Although I may not agree with this University's obsession with Division I athletics, as a student athlete I would never, even for a second, criticize or make fun of any member of one of these teams. The amount of personal sacrifice and strength required of them is substanJal and I have an enormous amount of respect for any person, no matter what his gifts, who commits himself completely to any worthwhile endeavor, be it playing Notre Dame football or teaching English at L~ Casa de Amistad. 
It is unfortunate that my sport has a cloudy reputation that has been per­petuated by close-minded nonsense such as that proposed by Mr. Baltruzak, and perhaps furthered by the relative silence of the ultimate club. As I prepare to graduate from this fine (albeit frequently regressive) institution and my role as a member of the Notre Dame ultimate team is fin­ished, I would like to encourage the Notre Dame community to continue to support those students who partic­ipate in clubs and organizations that frequently go unnoticed, and further­more, to not tolerate mindless drivel like Jeff Baltruzak's being said, much less printed.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Cave takes smoky style to limit on No More 
By GEOFFREY RAHIE 
Scene Music Critic 
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds has been known throughout the '80s a.nd '90s for crafting heartfelt, poetic compositions that appeal to the artsy crowd. No More Shall We Part is the group's first album of new material since 1997, and it seems as if Cave and his band are feeling especially reflective. The album is a tribute to love and its joyous and often crushing qualities. 
The disc kicks off with a beautiful piano line by Cave that is reminiscent of early Tori Amos. The piano in "As I Sat Sadly by Her Side" flutters in and out, weaving textures that a guitar would be hard­pressed to copy. Almost all of the tracks are based around Cave's piano playing, leaving the listener feeling as if Cave could have performed all of these songs solo in a smoky piano bar. 
But that is not meant to take anything away from The Bad Seeds. Cave's band is versatile and cha!­

lenging throughout the entire effort. This large band consists of two guitars, drums, bass, organ, violin and female backing vocals. The ensemble accentuates Cave's piano figures and vocal stylings. The violinist Warren Ellis is the biggest treat of the bunch, weav­ing in and out of the song struc­tures with earthy string work. 
The sentimental value of the album's lyrics does not bring the disc down, but rather gives the release a different feeling from other rock albums. Cave describes his love with so many words that the lyrical content does not get overdone: "A wicked wind whips up the hill/ A handful of hopeful words/ 1 love her and I always will/ The sky is ready to burst." Cave's words are a nice break 
from the over-simpli­

fied words of currentNo More Shall rock music. However, the record is hard to take in

By SAM DERHEIMER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
They are a dying breed. Heavy metal acts. Not rap/metal, not alternative rock (whatever that might be any­more). We're talking good 'ol straight head bangin', authority hatin' thrash rock. 
Long gone are the days when "Head Hanger's Ball" religiously aired Pantera and Anthrax to an audience ready to rip the furniture up from their own homes and trash the place. But based on its variety of hard-hitting, abrasive heavy metal. no one ever let the Miami-based quartet Endo in on the fact that the show was actually cancelled years ago. 
With its debut album, Evolve, Endo is crashing its way into a rock scene starving for anything with substance. Tackling subjects such as social alien­ation, depression and just pure unadul­terated anger, Endo has struck a cord with a pissed-off and discontent American youth. Former Nirvana front­man and alternative rock legend Kurt Cobain said it best: "Teenage angst has paid off well." And Endo is cashing in. 
More than anything, Evolve is the physical manifestation of the relentless and blind rage of lead singer Gil Bitton. 

Heavy metal may not be as prevalent as It once was, but from the pounding intensity of Endo's debut album, Evolve, It ls counting on a major revival. 

melodies and changed up a few of the instrumenta­tion on a few tracks, he would be able to write a killer disc. The band should be commended for hav­ing backup singers, but the two ladies do not even need to sing on the majority of the tracks. There is a difference between an instrument used for ornamen­tation and one used for domination. Their instru­ments -their voices -should be used for ornamen­tation. 
On a whole, the album is interesting to listen to. There are not many artists writing music like Cave. The work is reflective and thought provoking, but it also becomes tedious. Cave should be commended for his efforts, but maybe pushed a little harder to write more accessible music. 

ALBUM REVIEW 
Heavy sound and angry attitude define Evolve 

Combine this with the pounding riffs of gui­tarist Eli Parker, a throbbing bassline pro­vided by bassist Zelick and the heavy beats of drummer Joel Suarez, then mix in just enough elements of hip-hip and techno to sound current, and say hello to Endo. 
The difference with Endo -and the difference in heavy metal music in gen­eral -from the metal bands that once 
ruled the air waves, is the addition of the completely twisted and demented. Acts like Marylin Manson have moved from sideshow freak acts to full blown musical influences. 
Both stylistically and lyrically, Evolve is wrought with traces of Manson's touch. "Listen" crackles with the very same emotionally angst-ridden senti­ments that made Manson's anthology of deranged righteousness, Anti-Christ Superstar, the Bible of social outcasts it is today. "Sell, sell everything's for sale/ hey there kid you're lookin' kind of pale/ victim of society's hell/ sell your soul for the dollar bill." 
The spacy. futuristic throngs and neo-industrial riffs that open "Suffer" don't have nearly the effect of adding dimension to the song they were included to produce. Bitton howls about the glory of dispair as his band explodes behind him in a thick frenzy of power cords and metallic energy, but ultimately, no redeeming or origi­nal rock 'n' roll quality is ever uncov­
erect. 
"Malice" literally erupts in standoff­ish anger and paranoia -before Bitton ever utters a single word. Though, not to be outdone, Bitton soon crashes into a song already volcanic 
enough with the thunderous chorus, "F*** your perfection!" Spoken as a true outsider. 
There is no doubt that Endo is com­prised of four young and talented rock musicians. The problem is, you can only ride so long on pure anger. Rarely do thrash bands portray much in the category of staying power. And unless Endo linds its nitch, its debut could very well also be its farewell. 
For now, teenage angst may be pay­ing off well enough, but Endo would be doing itself a_ big favor by paying even closer attent10n to the second half of Cobain's words, "Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old."

and the Buffalo 
Sabres rediscov­ered their offense to avoid going down three games, beating the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-1 Monday night. 
The Sabres 


trailed 2-0 in the Woolley series and 1-0 in the second period until solving rookie goaltender Johan Hedberg twice in the third period. The Sabres added an empty-net goal in the final minute. 
Hedberg limited them to one goal in two Pittsburgh victories in Buffalo. 
Curtis Brown tied it at 13 :04 of the second period. and goalie Dominik Hasek then shut down Pittsburgh's ineffective offense before Woolley, a former Penguins player. got what proved to be the decisive goal at 9:51. 
Miroslav Satan carried the puck into the Penguins end, shot and missed, but grabbed his own rebound, allow­ing Doug Gilmour to steer the puck from behind the net to an open Woolley at the right side of the crease. It was Woolley's first playoff goal since June 8, 1999, during the Stanley Cup finals in Dallas and gave Buffalo its first lead of the series. 
Satan then prevented any Penguins comeback. with a wraparound goal at 
13:03 off a rebound after Maxim Afinogenov faked defenseman Darius Kasparaitis off his skates with a drive to the net. 
James Patrick added an empty-net 

goal to make it 4-1. 
The Sabres regained their offense just in time -they scored on only one of their first 64 shots in the series ­and after Hedberg, cheered on by thousands of fans wearing golden foam moose antlers in his honor, turned aside a flurry of Buffalo chances in the first 30 minutes. 
The Penguins' offense badly missed five-time NHL scoring champion Jaromir Jagr, who sat out his second successive game with a shoulder or rotator cuff problem. Pittsburgh also was without Josef Beranek (arm), who effectively replaced Jagr in Game 2. 
With the seldom used Rene Corbet unable to make up Jagr's missing offense on the Mario Lemieux line, the Penguins were held to 20 shots, only 12 after the first period. 
Game 4 will be Wednesday night in Pittsburgh, where the Penguins had been 8-1-3 against Buffalo since 1996 -with the only victory coming Dec. 2 -until Monday. 
Pittsburgh had plenty of good scor­ing chances despite being outshot 9-8 in the first period, clanging three shots off the posts, before taking a 1­0 lead for the third straight game. 
With Woolley in the box after a slashing penalty well behind the play, Andrew Ference's slap shot from the right point deflected off Kevin Stevens' stick at 5:34 of the second. 
With the Sabres now in real danger of going down 3-0, they responded by outshooting the Penguins 10-3 in the period and finally tied it on Brown's deflection off Ference's leg. 
Penguins defenseman Marc Bergevin couldn't clear the puck, and Brown put a hard shot on net from along the edge of the right circle that deflected past Hedberg inside the near post at 13:04 . 
Avalanche 4, Kings 3 
Milan Hedjuk had a goal and two assists and the Colorado Avalanche held off the Los Angeles Kings Monday night to take the lead in the Western Conference semifinal series. 
Peter Forsberg added a goal and an assist to help Colorado take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Avalanche won for the first time at Staples Center after going 0-4 during the two regular seasons at the 2-year­old arena. 
Game 4 is Wednesday night in Los Angeles. 
The Kings twice fell behind by two goals in the final period only to nar­row the gap each time, the last on Ziggy Palffy's score with 40 seconds remaining. 
Rob Blake opened the scoring against his former Los Angeles team­mates with a 65-foot slap shot that got past goalie Felix Potvin just 4: 33 into the game. 
After Forsberg snapped a 1-1 tie midway through the second period. Hedjuk made it 3-1 at 8:21 of the third period. 
Glen Murray scored for the Kings on a power play 1:39 later. 
Defenseman Jon Klemm restored Colorado's two-goal pad, which proved to be just enough, when he scored 34 seconds later. 
The Avalanche got their two goals on only three shots in the final period. 
Luc Robitaille had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles, which scored its first two goals on the power play. 
Klemm's first goal of the playoffs came after Alex Tanguay muscled around Jere Karalahti in the left cir­cle and threw the puck into the crease, where it bounced off the skate of Kings defenseman Mattias Norstrom and straight to Klemm. 
Murray chipped a backhander past Patrick Roy for his third playoff goal. 
Hedjuk scored his second goal of the postseason at the end of a 2-on-1 with Forsberg. Hedjuk beat Felix Potvin on the glove side at close range. 
Hoy faced 25 shots, 14 when the Kings dominated the action in the third period. The Avalanche took 21 shots at Potvin. 
Forsberg put Colorado ahead to stay when he knocked in a rebound over the sprawling Los Angeles goalie. 
Robitaille 's third goal of the post­season and first of the series came with the Kings holding a two-man advantage. After Blake was whistled for roughing Scott Thomas, Adam Foote drew a holding call, giving Los Angeles a 5-on-3 advantage for 1 :54. 
Seconds after Palffy's shot from the right side of the crease bounced off the left post, he slid a centering pass that Robitaille redirected into the net to tie it 1-1 with 39 seconds left in Blake's penalty and 3:43 remaining in the first period. 
Blake's goal, also his third of the postseason, came on a long shot that he didn't even seem to hit cleanly. At first, Potvin dropped to his knees and appeared to have squeezed the puck between his pads, but it somehow rolled across the goal line. 
The early score came on Colorado's fourth shot of the game. 
Colorado captain Joe Sakic, the NHL's second-leading scorer this year with 54 goals and 64 assists, went out with a shoulder injury after five shifts in the first period and did not return. Sakic had stitches between periods in Game 2 to close a wound caused by a Kings player's skate.

Minnesota's Anthony Peeler and Terrell Brandon, both scoreless in the first half, hit back-to-back 3-pointers with less than six minutes left as the Timberwolves rallied from a 10-point deficit to make it 75-73. The Spurs outscored the Wolves 22-11 the rest of the way, including a pair of baskets by Robinson that pushed the Spurs' lead to 79­73. 

"There was a tough stretch where we got into a slump there," said Robinson, who had 14 rebounds. "Coming back down the floor, I felt pretty good so I put them up there.

NATIONAL LEAGUE 

Piazza's dinger powers Mets past Astros in 8-2 home win 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 


Radke, Twins take down Pettitte, Yanks in 2-1 Will 
Associated Press 
Mike Piazza's three-run homer capped a five-run sixth inning and helped Steve Trachsel get his first win with the New York Mets, 8-2 over the Houston Astros on Monday night. 
After losing five of the final six games on a nine-game roadtrip, the National League champion Mets returned home with the worst record in the league. A rare offensive outburst and solid pitch­ing by Trachsel (1-4) helped straighten New York (10-15) out for at least one night. 

The Mets entered as the lowest scoring team in the majors with 81 runs in 24 games. The eight runs were the most for the Mets since beating Atlanta 9-4 in the home opener on April 9. It was also four more runs than New York had scored in Trachsel's first four starts. 
It took until the sixth inning for the Mets to break through against Scott Elarton (3-3). 
With the score tied at 1, Jay Payton led off with a double. Elarton retired the next two hitters and looked like he would thwart yet another Mets rally ­New York stranded eight runners in the first four innings. 
But Benny Agbayani worked a walk after falling behind 1-2. Timo Perez fol­lowed with a hard single off Elarton's foot, scoring Payton with the tiebreaking run. An RBI single by Edgardo Alfonzo made it 3-1 and ended Elarton's night after 123 pitches. 
Piazza, ejected for the first time in his career during Sunday's 12-1 loss at St. Louis, let out his frustration from the Mets' recent slide against reliever Kent Bottenfield. Piazza drove a 2-2 pitch off the scoreboard in right-center for his eighth homer to make it 6-1. 
Trachsel, a disaster at the start of his Mets' career, had his best start of the season. He allowed one run and six hits in six innings to lower his ERA from 

10.42 to 8.28. The right-hander, who signed a $7 million, two-year deal in the offseason with New York, struck out seven and walked one. 
Lance Berkman homered off Trachsel to lead off the second, drawing boos from the frustrated Shea Stadium crowd. 
After Todd Zeile's RBI single in the third tied the game, Trachsel pitched out of a first-and-third, no-out jam in the fourth. He struck out Chris Truby, got Jose Vizcaino to pop to shortstop, and retired Glen Barker on a groundout. 
Associated Press 
Brad Radke pitched his second complete game of the season and Doug Mientkiewicz hit a tiebreak­ing home run in the seventh inning as the Minnesota Twins beat the New York Yankees 2-1 on Monday night. 
Radke (5-0) became the first five-game winner in the major leagues by outdueling Andy Pettitte. Radke allowed six hits, including Tino Martinez's home run in the fourth, struck out four and walked one. 
The Twins improved to 11-2 at home and snapped the Yankees' three-game winning streak. 
Mientkiewicz, who extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games, drilled Pettitte's pitch into the bank of folded-up football seats in right-center field to give the Twins a 2-1 lead. Pettitte (3-3) had retired 15 of his last 16 hit­ters before Mientkiewicz. 
Pettitte gave up three hits and one walk in his second complete game of the season. He struck out a season-high eight. 
Pettitte, who lost to the Twins for the first time since 1998, had allowed 45 hits in 36 1-3 innings in his first five starts. 
The Yankees hit several balls hard against Radke, but many times right at a Twins fielder. Matt Lawton made a leaping catch against the right-field wall in the fifth to take an extra-base

hit away from Alfonso Soriano. 
The Twins (17 -6) have had 18 quality starts and are 16-2 in those games. Radke, a 20-game winner in 1997 who won only 12 in each of the last three seasons, has pitched at least seven full innings and allowed three runs or less in every outing. 
Yankees manager Joe Torre made a last-minute switch in the lineup, flip-flopping Martinez and David Justice in the fifth and sev­enth slots. Martinez responded, getting three hits -including his fifth home run with one out in the fourth to right field that tied the game at 1. 
The Twins took a 1-0 lead in the second Mientkiewicz's RBI single to drive in David Ortiz, who hit a double. 
Chuck Knoblauch walked to lead off the game amid hearty boos from the Metrodome crowd. Knoblauch, who played for the Twins from 1991-97 as a second baseman, made three putouts in left.

inning that made it 4-0. 
Roberts (4-0), forced into the rotation after Sidney Ponson went on the disabled list two weeks ago, allowed three runs on four hits in six innings. The right-han­der is 3-0 with a 2.37 ERA 'in his three starts, defeating Tampa Bay twice and winning in Detroit. 
Roberts didn't pitch in the majors last year and was signed as a minor league free agent in November. He has accounted for one-third of the Orioles' 12 wins this season. 
Chad Paronto pitched two scoreless innings and Ryan Kohlmeier worked the ninth for his fifth save.

The Devil Rays used an RBI double by Fred McGriff and a run-scoring groundout by Guillen to close to 4-2 in the fourth. The Orioles got an unearned run in their half on a two-out throwing error by shortstop Felix Martinez and an infield single by Anderson.

Sweeney went 3-for-4 with two RBIs for the Royals, who won the season series 4-3. 
"Good riddance to Mike Sweeney," Toronto manager Buck Martinez said. "We just can't figure out Sweeney. We tried every approach." 
In seven games against the Jays, Sweeney went 13-for-27, a .481 pace, with 10 extra base hits and eight RBIs. For the season, he is batting .292.

To be able to concentrate on the on-field aspect of the game has proven essential for many of the so called "elite athletes" who fail upon entering the profes­sional ranks. In recent years, top NFL draft picks such as Curtis Enis and Ki-Jana Carter have seen their careers end prema­turely. 
"The NFL is not playing around any more," Jones said. "If you don't produce, you're not going to be there. They're not going to pay you all this money to have you sit on the bench and be a backup." 
With a career as a professional athlete vulnerable to ending at any second. Jones stresses to his clients the importance of not spending frivolously. 
"In the pros everything is accelerated because you have all the time, all the money to act on your intuition," Jones said. "In pro sports there's really no 'I can't do this.' There's no bound­ries and you have to have the right mindset." 
Where many athletes falter and end up penniless is in the transition from an athletic career that awards paychecks in the five figures to an alternate working life that has smaller, more reasonable, salaries. Jones thinks that if athletes can survive this transition, they can be set for life. 
"It's kind of hard to go from making $20,000 a month to making $4,000 a month," said Jones, who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit Lions in the NFL. "It's a lifestyle change and that's another thing that we do. For us. we want to make that transition as smooth as possible. If you save the majority of that money, money's not the issue. That's a freedom that everybody should have." 
By taking care of its clients, Jones' company has proven suc­cessful and expanded. While rap stars such as Master P have failed in attempts to combine the entertainment and sports indus­tries, Columbia Records was eager to enter into the business relationship that formed So So Def Sports. 
"We went and approached them and the only reason that they really looked at our firm was the fact that we had been in business for eight years," Jones said. "We had already done $75 million worth of contracts before we came to them. They knew that we were a proven product in the marketplace." 
With such success already behind him at age 31, Jones has returned some of his attention to his alma mater, a place he Houston in the WNBA. But once Ivey met Jones, there was no decision to make. 
"I think he understood me and what I was going through. His being from Notre Dame was per­fect," Ivey said. "It's kind of a continuation from my coaches and who I've been working at at Notre Dame. I didn't even look at anybody else, honestly, after I talked to him." 
Jones found the WNBA negoti­ating process interesting. While contracts are flexible in the NFL and agents deal with team rep­resentatives. the WNBA presents a completely different animal. 
"The WNBA is unlike any other league because all the deals are negotiated with the league," Jones said. "In the NBA and pro football you negotiate with the individual teams. The reason they have you negotiate with the league is to keep the salaries down." 
Many WNBA players like Ivey,

Tigers sport losing record in April for 8th consecutive year 
Associated Pre.s 
New year. Same slow start. 
For an eighth consecutive season, the Detroit Tigers (8-15) 
have a losing record in April. 
The last time they were above .500 after a month was 
1993, which also is their last winning season. 
"It better get better soon," Bobby Higginson said, "or it's 
going to be over for us before we get to June." 
Detroit was expected to struggle this season, especially 
when it decided to trim about $5 million from the payroll to 
bring it to about $50 million. 
However, when low-budget teams such as Minnesota find 
ways to win, it makes it tougher to make money issues an 
excuse. 
Seeing former Tigers Luis Gonzalez, Juan Gonzalez and 
Hideo Nomo enjoy success this season doesn't help either. 
"We were criticized when we brought those guys here," 
said general manager Randy Smith, bristling at the criticism 
of his moves over six years. "And now we're criticized for let­
ting them go. It shouldn't be able to work both ways." 
Because of a lack of talent and depth, Detroit's margin for 
error is minuscule. 
The Tigers got away with some foolish baserunning in a 6-1 
win over Tampa Bay on Sunday, but such mistakes have hurt 
them against other teams. 
"We can't afford to make mistakes and still win, like some 
other teams can," Todd Jones said. "Our mistakes seem to 
turn into two or three runs for the other teams and all too 
often, we haven't made teams pay for mistakes against us. 
"I don't really know who we are yet. We show glimpses of 
decent play, then we show glimpses of playing horribly." 
Several key players have not been playing well. . 
Jones is 0-2 with five saves and a 7 .56 ERA, after becommg 
the first Tiger to win the Rolaids Relief Man Award last sea­
son. 
Damion Easley is batting .193 and Deivi Cruz is hitting 
.215. 
Center fielder Juan Encarnacion has compounded his prob­
lems defensively by batting .231. 
The Tigers only significant move in the offseason was trad­
ing catcher Brad Ausmus along with relievers Doug Brocail 
and Nelson Cruz to Houston for catcher Mitch Meluskey. out­
fielder Roger Cedeno and starter Chris Holt. 
Meluskey will miss the entire season with an injured ri~ht 
shoulder, which also ended his season after 10 games with 
the Astros two years ago. 
Cedeno, counted on to be a leadoff hitter, is batting .171. 
Holt has been relatively solid with a 2-2 record and 5.40 
ERA. 
Meluskey's injury was just the start of the Tigers' health 
problems. 
Dean Palmer, who hit a three-run homer Sunday after com­
ing off the disabled list, has played just sev~n g~mes. _Ace 
Brian Moehler started once, but has been sidelined smce 
April 6. Both have shoulder problems.

weeks with a broken bone in his left wrist, after leading the

Jones said. "That's really what I'm all about and why I'm coming back to Notre Dame now." 
An arrangement already exist­ed between Washington and Jones during the NCM basket­ball season. As the Irish advanced to the championship, the WNBA draft, only two weeks after the Final Four, drew closer. But, as she was still playing, Ivey was not allowed to hire an agent. 
But Ivey was prepared. She had discussed possible agents with Washington, her point guard coach who plays for "If you're 
out of the first round you're basically making about $35,000 a year," Jones said. "It's a means to cure your off-season life and if you have the ability to play or coach then why not make money doing it." 
However, with the entertain­ment connections that So So Def offers, Jones could see Ivey mak­ing money in the off-season from venues away from the court. 
"There's a lot of things we can do with her that we couldn't do with somebody else, from the fact that she came out of Notre Dame and she's halfway attrac­tive," Jones said.

ROWING 

Irish take second in Big East Challenge 
By JOHN BACSIK 
Sports W ricer 
The women's rowing team had something to prove this weekend in Worcester, Mass. 
It wanted to show the Big East and the rest of the nation that it was not to be taken lightly as an opponent. and it was determined to make some rumblings in the water. 
The Irish took second place overall in the inaugural Big East Howing Challenge held on Lake Quinsigamond. The team com­peted against eight other Big East schools, including nationally ranked Syracuse and Rutgers. 
With temperatures in the 60s and mild winds, the Varsity Eight squad competed against talented squads from both Syracuse and Rutgers. The Irish battled Hutgers most of the way for sec­ond place, but they could not keep pace down the stretch, coming in a close third. 
The second Varsity Eight was not to be outdone by Rutgers though. They went ahead of the Scarlet Knights early, and came within one second of upsetting Syracuse. 
"Syracuse jumped out to an early lead, but we pulled close within the last 400 meters," said senior Leah Ashe. "This was one of the best races I've been involved in all season." 
Despite its youth and relative inexperience for some with row­ing, the Novice Eight has been far from a weak link for the Irish. They took second in their race in Worcester. coming within one half second of the Georgetown squad. 
With two boats entered in the Varsity Four race, the Irish placed third and fifth to complete the afternoon. 
The team continues to face tougher competition as they attempt to qualify for the NCMs. 
"Our main goal in the begin­ning of the season was to qualify for the NCAAs," said junior Katherine Burnett. "It was a bit abstract at first. but as the sea­son went on, we started to believe in it more and more." 
Finishing ahead of the higher ranked Rutgers was a step in the right direction for the team, and this momentum will be key as the team heads into the Central Region Championships. 
"The strength of this program is its ability to continuously strive for the best," said coxswain Claire Bula. "No one in the NG\A even thought we'd make it into the rankings this season." 
The squad hasn't seemed to mind their role as underdogs though this season. 
"When someone throws down a challenge, we just dig deeper," said Bula. "When it comes down to it, it's all about heart."

Notre Dame keeps top poll spot 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame baseball team has maintained its No. 1 ranking in the Collegiate Baseball magazine poll w hi 1 e a l s o moving into the top spot in the Baseball America poll and jumping to a No. 2 rank­ing in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll, after winning five of six games last week to yield an overall record of 40-6-1 for the Irish. 
Notre Dame nearly gained consensus No. 1 status but Louisiana State (35-13-1) jumped from fifth to first in the coaches' poll, after a 5­0 week for the Tigers that included a three-game sweep at Alabama. Notre Dame -which was ranked fourth in last week's coach­es poll -actually received the most first place votes in this week's coaches poll (15 of 41, with LSU receiving 
14) but the Tigers collected 956 total points, followed by the Irish (930). Miami (904). last week's No. 1 Stanford (894) and Southern California (810). 

Each of the rankings is 
the highest ever for Notre 
Dame in each poll. 
Notre Dame maintained the same point total in the Collegiate Baseball poll 
(473) while LSU climbed from third to second place in the CB poll (rising from 463 points to 469) and Stanford (33-13) dropped from second to 6th. follow­ing a 1-3 week. The other top five teams in this week's CB poll include Cal State Fullerton (33 -11), USC (32­16) and Miami (35 -11). 
The Irish moved atop the Baseball America poll while Nebraska (35-12) fell from the top spot into fourth, after losing three games last week. LSU. Miami and USC round out the top five in the current BA poll. 
Notre Dame nearly joined Georgia Tech and Stanford as the only teams in 2001 to be ranked No. 1 in all three polls during the same week, with the Yellow Jackets holding that distinction in the preseason polls and again on Feb. 5, Feb. 26 and March 5 while the Cardinal were a consensus No. 1 on April 9 and 16. 
Notre Dame -which owns the nation's fourth­longest active streak of con­secutive seasons with 40 wins with 13, currently leads the Division I ranks in team ERA (2.51) while ranking just behind Stetson (40 -6) for the nation's top winning percentage, at .862. The Irish have won 19 of their last 20 games while batting .338 as a team dur­ing that 20 -game stretch. 
The Irish rolled to 20 vic­tories and just two losses during the month of April ­highlighted by three-game sweeps on the road versus two of the top teams in the Big East Conference. defending champion Rutgers and St. John's (for perspective, the previous five ND teams combined to post just two three-game road sweeps in Big East play). 
The baseball team last week became the fourth Notre Dame sport to earn a No. 1 national ranking in 2000-01, with the others including the women's soc­cer team. the men's fencing squad and the national championship women's bas­ketball team.

Mike Dunleavy's job is safe -for at least another week, anyway. 
The Portland Trail Blazers' late-season collapse, which ended with a first-round play­off sweep by the Los Angeles Lakers, brought speculation that the coach would be the fall guy. 
President and general man­ager Bol> Whitsitt said Monday that nothing has been decided, and took the blame for the making a series of personnel moves that backfired. 
"The things that didn't work out, that's my responsibility," he said. ''That's my fault. I'm in charge of everything that goes on in this organization, and I feel bad." 
Dunleavy, the 1999 coach of the year. met with Whitsitt after Sunday's loss and again Monday afternoon, and Whitsitt said he would decide soon what changes to make. 
"We tried to both talk about the season, the last several years. where we are, where we're going. but the main thing is, we both agreed the

best thing is. let's get out of here for a week or two," Whitsitt said. 
'Tm sure Mike's as frustrat­ed as I am and more so, because going into the season, we were all trying to get to the top of the mountain." 
For the first time in his seven seasons with the Blazers, Whitsitt's job status also was uncertain. But Whitsitt said he had been assured by owner Paul Allen that he will return next season. 
"I think Paul's just like all of us: he's very disappointed, 
times when you strike out," Whitsitt said. 
Despite an NBA-record $89.7 million payroll, the Blazers never quite came together as a team, and their lack of unity showed on the court in some ugly losses to inferior teams. Counting the playoffs, Portland lost 10 of its last 13 games, and the only victories came against Golden State (twice) and Vancouver. 
They never were a threat to the Lakers in the playoffs, los­ing by 13, 18 and 13 points. In the last game, the Blazers played without Dale Davis and Stacey Augmon, who were sus­pended for an altercation in Game 2. 
"It's a shame," Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire said. "It's some­thing we're all going to have to take into the summer -a long summer -and think about."

Belles drop final 2 contests of season 
scoring five  runs before the  
By MOllY McVOY  Belles  put  a  run  on  the  
Senior Staff Writer  board. They scored two in  
the first and one run in the  
The Saint Mary's soft ball second, third and fourth  

team ended its season in the same fashion it played most of their season. It had solid pitching and some hitting, but not quite enough put together to bring out a win. 
The Belles dropped their last double header to Goshen College Saturday, 4-0 and 8­3. 
"I think the pitching was decent, but we just didn't have it at the plate," head coach John Kovach said. 
Junior Kristin Martin pitched the first game, going seven innings, while giving up seven hits and three earned runs. The fourth run came on an error by the Belles. The Belles recorded six hits. but none came home for a run. 
"We just could never get anything put together," Kovach said. 
Junior Rachel Deer and senior Cindy Traub both went 2-for-3 in the game. 
"It seemed that when we did get runners on, we had them on with two outs," Kovach said. "We also had a couple of really good defen­sive plays against us, and then, as hitters, I think we started trying to do too much." 
Goshen recorded one run in the first and third innings, and then put two runs on the board in the fifth to make the final score 4-0. 
Senior Anne Senger pitched her last game at Saint Mary's in the second game against Goshen. She gave up 13 hits and five earned runs. The three unearned runs came off errors by Saint Mary's in the sixth inning. 
"Even without those unearned runs, we were still in a 5-3 hole that we had to come back from," Kovach said. 
Goshen took the early lead, 

We'rejust trying to change the lives of a few kids. Four thousand inner-city kids in Newark, NJ, to be exact. We have this crazy idea that summer schools, after-school programs, trips to a eladership camp and comprehensive medical care will give our students a fair shot. 
We're not trying to change the world, but we're pretty sure our students will.

innings. 
"They just jumped out to an early lead against us," Kovach said. 
The Belles recorded their first run in the fifth inning on an RBI ground out by Traub. Freshman third baseman Mandy Hayes scored the run after walking to start the inning. 
Goshen struck back in the 
sixth with three runs, 
although all of them were unearned. 
~There were a couple cases where Anne made a really good pitch but the batter got enough of the ball to drop it in," Kovach said. "That's really frustrating if you're a pitcher." 
The Belles added two runs in the seventh inning to close out the game. 
Deer was hit by a pitch to start of the inning, and Traub moved the runner to third on a single. Traub then stole second base and fresh­man Sandy Harmon recorded an RBI ground out and fresh­man Katie Friggie brought in the second run with an RBI single. The game ended 8-3 in favor of Goshen. 
The Belles ended their sea­son with a 14-19 overall record and a 4-10 record in the MIAA. 
"Overall, I was pretty pleased with our pitching this year," Kovach said. 
"I was impressed with a lot of freshman players. Libby Wilhelmy ended the year with a 6-1 record for us." 
Despite a losing record, team captain Cindy Traub was pleased with the team's performance. 
"I think that our season, although peole may not see it as a success with our wins and losses, was a success because of the way we were able to deal with adveristy on and off the field."

than results, was amazed. 

"I was shocked," Tierney said. "We went in there 
for fun and ended up doing really well. The whole 
day was a blur." 

Senior Matt Johnson, who joined the team from 
Notre Dame. claimed the first place finish in the 
men's collegiate division. with a time of 37 minutes. 
But the medals didn't end there. 

Mary Pendergast grabbed a second place finish, 
followed by seniors Colleen Sullivan and Lori 
Schulte. Schulte joined Tierney last year as one of 
only two members on the team. 

"Last year we just did this for fun and it was just 
Lori and I," Tierney said. "It grew and now we're 
out there with the rest of these colleges. It's great." 
Hildebrandt, who wants the focus to remain on the 
student athletes. cannot go without mention. She 
came home with a gold medal for winning the entire 
triathlon. 

Although bringing home the medals was a major 
victory for each athlete. it was a great success for 
Saint Mary's as a school as well. With this victory, 
the Belles have their name out there as contenders 
and they plan to make use of that. 

"All of [the other participants] are going to spread the word," Hildebrandt said. "We already had a par­ent come up to us to ask about Saint Mary's." 
This is only the second year of the club's existence. Hildebrandt started the club last year as a personal project, as well as a way to encourage enrollment at the college. After completing their first intercolle­giate triathlon. the team still has places to go. 
"[The athletes] have been seriously training since Christmas break, but we still have a far way to go," Hildebrandt said. 
The team is done participating competitively until September. but the training will continue. According to Hildebrandt, workouts will focus more on biking now that weather allows for long outdoor rides. 
Next fall. the team will be short most of its mem­bers and its coach. Pendergast will be the only returning member. Hildebrandt. who is leaving Saint Mary's to train fulltime, will be replaced by the new assistant athletic director. 
Despite its losses, the team is already registered for two races in September.

in every game. Its last four 
losses have been by a com­
bined five runs. 
Notre Dame's exceptional 
mental toughness can be 
attributed to the excellent 
work done by head coach 
Paul Mainieri and his coach­
ing staff. Since attaining the 
top ranking one week ago, 
the Irish have displayed no 
signs of a letdown. 
"Everyone on the team has 
put the rankings in perspec­
tive," said O'Toole. adding, 
"we don't play tight." 
Taking the mound for the Irish will be sophomore Pete Ogilvie. Sporting a 3-1 record, Ogilvie has been a pleasant surprise for the team this year. He has developed into a reliable mid-week starter who cur­rently boasts the team's low­est ERA at 1.20. 
And while the odds defi­nitely seem to be stacked in Notre Dame's favor, the Irish have every reason to be cautious of their oppo­nent. Hecent midweek games against Ball State and Valparaiso have resulted in losses to an inferior team. 
Today, Notre Dame will try to make sure that doesn't happen again. 
"I think we will win if we do the small things; make defensive plays and get key hits," said O'Toole. He added. "I think its going to be a good game -there's definitely some bad blood between us."

So Def Sports. an Atlanta-based firm that repre­sents professional athletes. 
Recently, So So Def expanded beyond its usual clientele of 
NFL players and signed gradu­ated Irish point guards Niele Ivey and Coquese Washington. Ivey was the starting point guard on Notre Dame's national championship team this past spring. Washington, who played under Irish coach Muffet McGraw during the early 1990s, served as an assistant 
coach. 

Jones' firm also represents 
former Irish football stars 
Shawn Wooden, Allen Rossum 
and Autry Denson. So So Def, 
which is affiliated with 
Columbia Records, has rela­
tively few clients and. as such, 
is able to focus more individu­
ally on the athletes as people. 
"When I was in the pros I saw so many guys who were getting ripped off," Jones said during a last Friday. "So many false insurance scams and deals that weren't going through. people were losing a lot of money. What I planned to do was come from a Godly perspective and bring integrity back to this game. If you have one piece missing out of your life, then you don't have integrity. Our job is to make sure that you have that integrity." 
Jones and his associates at So So Def sports serve young clients starting out in the pro­fessional leagues from the start, helping them get situated and concentrate on their jobs.

Belles triathalon club returns with 5 medals

Sometimes unxpected victo­ries can be the most reward­ing. 
For the seven Saint Mary's and Notre Dame athletes par­ticipating in the Southern Illinois triathlon. those unex­pected victories made a last­ing impression. 
The Saint Mary's triathlon club made its first trip to par­ticipate as a club team at Southern Illinois University expecting little, hoping only to finish the race with more experience. 
But it came home with five medals and three first place finishes. 
"The [athletes] weren't going out there to win." head coach and participant Gretchen Hildebrandt said. "For them, mentally and physically, this was a great first step.n
