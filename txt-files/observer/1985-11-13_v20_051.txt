As winter begins to set in, so does student apathy 
The woods are lovely, dark and deep. ButI havepromises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, 
And miles to go before I sleep. -Robert Frost, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening 
It's that time of year again. Fall break is over. Thanksgiving is just out of reach. Christmas is unrealis­tic. And students are becoming restless and bored with the routine oflife in the Notre Dame community.· 
The evidence is all around us. 
Classes are past the midway point. Most everybody has used up all their unexcused absences. By now, stu­dents have their professors pegged and vice versa. As 
B.B. King said, "The thrill is gone." 
At work, people are less enthusiastic about their jobs. Restless. Looking for something new but not expecting to find it. 
Social life is becoming predictable. Freshmen, having finally made it to the wonderful world ofcollege ­with the obligatory wild parties and togas -have become wisened old veterans who nod stoically as they recite the difference between an SYR and a for­mal. 
Student government isn't as fun as it used to be. 
Look at all those issues that ignited the collective student mind a few weeks ago. Student Senate disband­ment. The Dillon Decision. The Healy recall referen­dum. The South African issue. Parietals. 

The referendum on the disbandment of the Student Senate wasn't held last Tuesday, as was originally planned. Nor was it held yesterday. It might be held next week, or maybe not at all, depending on what the Hall Presidents' Council decided last night. 
Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson responded to what he termed an "incendiary" resolu­tion from the Student Senate to define the limits of the University's jurisdiction over students with a nicely­worded, well-thought out response, closing with, "I am more than happy to respond to the request and hope my clarification is helpful." Ssssssss. Out go the flames. 
The movement to hold a recall election for Student Body President Bill Healy and Vice President Duane Lawrence has fizzled. What was once a group of emotionally-motivated students demanding their right to representation eventually became an exercise in cooperation and the rebirth ofsome sense ofunity wit­hin the Healy administration.

Students protesting apartheid, the systematic dis­crimination and oppression of people in South Africa, were shouted down at the Notre Dame football game with chants of "More investment!" and "Go to hell!" Whatever happened to integrity? Or even class? 
When concerned student leaders published convinc­ing pleas in The Observer for students to write Tyson about unfair implementation ofthe parietals regulation, only a handful ofstudents took the time to respond. 
This kind ofattitude could justify the statement, "Notre Dame students aren't just apathetic; they're pathetic." 
But that would be a defeatist attitude. It's not that bad. This lack ofmotiva­tion, if you will, can be blamed on the depressing weather that is beginning to settle into the area, or all the construction students have to walk around on the way to class, or the seemingly in­finite distance between breaks or even weekends, or the long lines in the dining hall at 12:55 when you have 
,,.,.J a 1: 1 5 class. It's all these things and it's none ofthese things. 

Even though life at Notre Dame has seemingly become temporarily stagnant academically, socially and politically, this doesn't mean the party's over. This is what is called a lull. 
The campus is just catching its breath. 
The same thing happened last year at this time. The most controversial topic in the letters section of The Observer a year ago was whether the "Women of Notre Dame" calender was sexist. How easy it would be to replace this phrase with "USC cheerleader picture." The rhetoric is the same. Not what you would call demanding. 
The year before that was even worse. This date in 1983 graced the campus with the burning question of whether more laundry facilities should be made available to men. Yawn. 
Eventually, precedent has shown us that things will pick up. Just sleep late when you can. Drink plenty of orange juice (cold and flu season is just around the corner). And sharpen your steely knives for the next round ofcontroversy.

General claims overthrow of Liberian government 
Associated PreS!I 

A fugitive general claimed yester­day he had overthrown Liberia's government, but a man identifying himself as head of state Samuel Doe said by telephone from the ex­ecutive mansion that he was still in charge of the West African nation. 
The U.S. embassy spokesman in Monrovia said that the center of the Liberian capital was calm at mid­afternoon and that Doe loyalists had taken the government radio station back from the rebels. He said some soldiers who apparently were rebels were still on the streets. 
The London bureau of NBC, said Its staff telephoned the executive mansion in Monrovia and inter­viewed a man who said he was Doe. 
"The situation here is under con­trol, and I'm still in power," the man said. "I want to appeal to the Uberian people to be calm and all those that came with (rebel leader Thomas) Quiwonkpa to put down their arms and report to the nearest police officer." 
He said loyalist troops had killed "about 15 rebels" who attacked the executive mansion before: dawn. 
The U.S. embassy spokesman, Ric­hard Gilbert, said in a telephone: in­terview with Associated Press Radio in Washington: "as fur as we know all Americans are safe. We've advised people to remain in their houses, off the streets." 
Gen. Quiwonkpa was among the leaders of the bloody 1980 "sergeants' coup" that brought Doe to power, but his former comrade accused him of plotting two years ago and Quiwonkpa fled the country.

In the Student Senate story yes­
terday a portion ofVice President 
for Student Affairs Father David 
Tyson's letter to Bill Healy, stu­
dent body president, was lnad­
vertantly omitted. The following 
is the complete text ofthe letter: 
"I am writing in response to your letter of November 4th and the Student Senate Resolution 
N.B. 1. I trust that you will com­municate my response to the Senate. 
"I will attempt to be clear with respect to the University's posi­tion on sanctions taken against groups away from the University. Any member of the University community, student, fuculty, or administrator, can bring embar­rassment or disgrace to the Uni­versity by their actions by virtue ofthe fact that they are identified as members of the community. However, it is quite a different matter when members of the community take it upon them­selves to act as agents of the Uni­versity by flying flags, entering contests on behalf of the Univer­sity, etc. In the latter case, the University has and will continue to impose sanctions on these parties when their actions, on be­half of the University, are in op­position to the values and principles which are at the foundation of Notre Dame's mis­sion. The sanctions imposed are 
contingent upon the cir­cumstances Involved and the judgement of those charged with the decision-making. 
"There have been Individual students in the past who have engaged in activities away from the campus that have been dis­paraging to the community and have been adjudicated by ap­propriate law enforcement offi­cials and the courts. In these cases, the University has not imposed further sanctions. These cases, on the other hand, are quite different from a student or group of students who de facto set themselves up as agents ofthe University. In my opinion, the Office of Residence Life has been consistent and fuir when examin­ing complaints that are brought to our attention from other cities or campuses. I should also point out that I am much more con­cerned with the fairness ofadeci­sion which is not always guaranteed by consistency. 
"In closing, allow me to say that I am perplexed by the tone of the Resolution In that I have always responded to Senate re­quests for clarifications, etc. Regardless of the Incendiary tone ofthe Resolution, I am more than happy to respond to the request and hope that my clarification is helpful."

Coffee drinkers face three times greater risk of heart problems 
Associated Pre!l8 
BALTIMORE · A person who drinks five or more cups of coffee a day ha.~ an almost three times greater risk of having heart problems than a non-coffee drinker, ac(.'(m.ling to a study of more than 
1.000 doctors released Monday. 
findings from the study, which tracked 1,1 :\0 white males who graduated from The Johns Hopkins Mt·dical S<:hool here between 194H and 1964, were presented in Was­hington at the 5Hth scientific ses­sions of the American Heart Association. 
Information on drinking habits was obtained from the graduating physicians at five-year intervals for up to 25 years. No information was obtained on whether the type ofcof­fee was caffeinated or decaffeinated. 
A person who drinks at least five cups of coffee daily has a 2.8 times greater risk of having heart problems than the non-drinker, the study found. 
Even when other risk factors · smoking, high-blood pressure, cholesterol levels and age · are con­sidered, the study determined there is still a 2. 5 times increased risk, the researchers reported. 
Other studies into possible links betwc:en coffee consumption and coronary heart disease have resulted in COI[ltradictory findings, said Dr. Thomas Pearson, an associate professor and director of the Johns Hopkins Precursors Study. Some found a link, while others did not. 
Aspokesman for the National Cof­fee Association, Bill Brooks, said l 0 of 12 major studies found no relationship between coffee drink· ing and heart disease. In one of the two studies that did, the findings were later reversed, he said. 
American coffee drinkers consume an average of 3 cups a day, the association said.

Sweetener linked to seizures 
Associated Press 
BOSTON· A new report suggests that NutraSweet might trigger epilepsy in some susceptible people and recommends that doctors ques· tion seizure victims about their con· sumption of the popular artificial sweetener. 
In a letter in the latest issue of the British journal Lancet, Dr. Richard Wurtman describes three cases in which people had their first epllep· tic seizures after drinking large amounts of soft drinks that con­tained NutraSweet. 
Wurtman theorizes that the sweetener · known generically as aspartame · lowers levels of chemi­cals in the brain that protect against seizures. 
In his letter, Wurtman said the three cases "can only suggest an as­sociation between aspartame and seizures." But he added that they are "compatible with evidence that high

Healy added he didn't see any problem in establishing the commit· tee, which would consist of the stu· dent body president, HPC representative to the CLC, judicial coordinator, Student Activities Board chairman, and the five student senators if the proposal is passed in its current form. 
During the meeting, Lawrence an­nounced that Notre Dame is well short ofits goal in fundraising efforts for the United Way. According to Lawrence, the goal was for each stu· dent to average S3 in donations, but contributions thus far are much less than that amount. 
In other business, Junior Jamie Cantorna addressed HPC on efforts 
to  start  a  halfway  house  for  ex·  
offenders  in  South  Bend.  He  ex­ 
plained  that  the house  will  be  

patterned after one established by Vanderbilt University in which stu· dents live with the ex-offenders.

crease in power for any of the other 
three bodies ofstudent government, 
according to Lawrence. The student 
body president, the HPC, and the 
CLC already exercise the same 
duties, he said. 
"It is not as though the CLC or the HPC will be taking the place of the Student Senate. The duties have aJ. ways been there, they have just been doubled up (with the senate)," Lawrence said. 
Lawrence said that the "student voice" has always been the student body president, as evidenced in the recent jurisdiction controversy con· cerning the Dillon tailgater in Ann Arbor. Lawrence also said that the role of initiating administration policies concerning the students has always been the role ofthe CLC, as it is officially recognized by both the aspartame doses may produce neurochemical changes that, in laboratory animals, are associated with depressed seizure thresholds." 
Officials of G.D. Searle & Co., which makes NutraSweet, said Wurtman's findings were not scien­tifically controlled, and the apparent link could well have been due to chance. 
"We have every confidence in its safety, and our confidence is based on the research," Dr. John Heybach, Searle's director of medica.! and scientific affairs, said of NutraSweet. "It's the most extensively researched food additive prior to its approval in history." 
Wurtman, a physician at Massac­huseus Institute of Technology, has been a frequent critic of aspartame since it was introduced in 1981 as the tabletop sweetener Equal. Now it is used in dozens of products, in· eluding pudding, chewing gum and diet soft drinks. 
Eight students would be needed to live with eight ex-offenders, once the house is established. Ap· proximately S75,000 is still needed by the group in order to begin operation, according to Cantoma. 
Cantorna said a general informa· tiona! meeting will be held Nov. 18 in the Center for Social Concerns at 7p.m. 
Badin Hal.l President Judith Windhorst brought up the issue of University Food Services concession stands during home football weekends. She views the stands as competition for concession stands run by student organizations and halls, who use profits for student use. Healy said the issue is being looked into. 
Senior Mark Herkert, who is seeking to have the University implement courses to promote aJ. coho! awareness, a.lso addressed HPC on his efforts. He told HPC he spoke with Father William Beauc· hamp, assistant to University Presi· dent Father Theodore Hesburgh, who will speak "with the ap­propriate people," according to Herkert. 
Board of Trustees and the ad­
ministration. 

Lawrence added that the allocat· 
ing of the student activities budget 
always has been done by the budget 
committee under the jurisdiction of 
the student body president. 

In a budget dispute earlier this year, the administration ruled in favor of the budget committee over the senate, said Lawrence. 
The final duty of the senate, con· firmation of cabinet positions, which Lawrence said is a "rubber stamp," will be assumC"d by the HPC. 
The senate, in its present form, only has been in existence for five years. The last senate was es­tablished in 1969 and voted itself out ofexistence within three years. 
Although Lawrence and Howard are responsible for the actual amendment, Healy, Student Ac· tivitles Board Manager Lee Brous· sard, and judicial Coordina~or Karen lngwerson also sponsored the amendment.

16 Argent-ne officers on trial for negligence during Falklands War 
Associated Press 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -A military prosecutor on Monday accused former armed forces chiefs of negligence in Argentina's humiliating defeat by Britain in the Falklands War and asked that they be given prison terms ofup to 12 years. 
Sixteen army, navy and air force officers are on trial for their part in the war that began April 2, 1982, when Argentina invaded the Falklands, a British colony, and ended 74 days later when British troops recaptured the islands off Ar­gentina's southern coast. 
Air Force Gen. Hector Canale, prosecutor for the Armed Forces Supreme Council, recommended 12-year prison terms for ex­president and former army com­mander Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri and former navy chief, Adm. Jorge Anaya. He called for an eight-year sentence for the former air force

Neal said the dust and noise have been an inconvenience but they were an expected part ofthe renova­tion. The biggest inconvenience, she said, has been for the Student Ac­tivities Board because ofthe student groups and businesses that had to be shut down or relocated. 
Shananigans had to be moved into the Scholastic office and Right to Life was moved into the Student Govern­ment offices. 
The Dome's darkroom had to be moved to the Fitzpatrick Hall of En­gineering and the Morrissey Loan Fund has been temporarily rel­ocated to the third floor of the Ad­ministration Building. 
Some of the inconveniences caused by the renovation are already being felt by the student businesses.

They were the three members of the ruling junta of the military governmnent in power at that time. Other recommended sentences in­clude prison terms of three to four years, but not all have been dis­closed. 
Canale's charges marked the start of final arguments in the two-year­old court martial and the first time all 16 defendants sat as a group before the Supreme Council, the na­tion's highest military tribunal. 
Defense Minister Roque Carranza called the proceedings "the most important military trial in Argentine history." 
"It is necessary to establish all responsibility for military conduct" in the war, he told reporters at the army's logistics command headquarters in the northern Palermo district, where the trial is being conducted. 
Reporters and the general public are barred from attending the ses­sions. Some representatives of the Defense Ministry and the commit­tees defending the accused agreed to brief reporters on the proceed­ings .with the condition they not be identified. 

Argentina lost 712 combatants in the war and Britain 255. 
The court martial was initiated in November 1983 on the recom­mendation of a military commission that found the junta led Argentina into war "when it was not prepared for a confrontation of such charac­teristics." 
It also accused military leaders of "incomplete and defective plan­ning" and of "failing to take advantage of concrete (diplomatic) opportunities for an honorable and feasible solution to the conflict." 
The military ruled Argentina from a coup in 1976 until December 1983, when the elected civilian government of President Raul Alfon­sin took office. 
French AIDS patient dies despite new treatment 
Associated Press 

PARIS -A french doctor who helped develop a new treatment for AIDS announced Monday that one of his patients had died, but he said the experimental program has shown great promise and is being expanded. 
Dr. Philippe Even of the Laen­nec Hospital in Paris . said the patient, a 38-year-old French male homosexual, died Saturday. The man "had suffered from full blown AIDS for at least a year," and first underwent experimen­tal treatment with the drug 

cyclosporine three weeks ago, · Even said in a telephone inter­
view. 

He described the man as "a 
desperate case" and said his 
death had not been unexpected, 
given the advanced stage of the 
the· case and the patient's mul­
tiple infections. 

Even and fellow researchers 
Dr. Jean-Marie Andrieu and Dr. 
Alain Venet announced at a news 
conference Oct. 29 that 
cyclospodne had proved ef­
fective in fighting AIDS, or ac­
quired immune deficiency 
syndrome.

Moreau unmasked 
MARY BERGER 
features writer 
Ever heard ofa "Come as your favorite 
sinner or sin" party? What about one with 
Jim jones, Kool-Aid, Faustus and choc­
olate cake, in attendance? 
Where do you think such an event 
could be found? Dillon? Farley? 
Think again. This time about Moreau 
Seminary. 
You know the place. It's that concrete 
fortress across St. joseph's Lake with the 
immense steel cross in front ofit and all 
the locked doors that this reporter found 
great difficulty penetrating. 
It is also the place some 72 seminarians 
studying to become priests of the Holy 
Cross Order call home. 
Mike Tomsovic ofChicago is a col­
lt:giate thc:re in his third year of under­
graduate study. "I was taught by priests of 
the congregation of Holy Cross in high 
school," he explained. "I'd like to return 
to my high school and teach English." 
jim Skypeck, a candidate at Moreau 
earning undergraduate philosophy hours 
was called to the cloth ever earlier. "I 
developed the concept of becoming a 
priest in elementary school," said 
Skypeck. "I was attracted to the Holy 
(:ross congregation by its diversity of 
mission and sense ofcommunity. I would 
~omcday like to be a retreat coordinator 
or be involved with college chaplancy." 
The men living at Moreau arc either in 
their second year of undergraduate study 
or in one of the phases that follows receiv­
ing IH undergraduate credit hours in 
philosophy. First-year undergraduate 
students in the program live in the Old 
Collegt·. 
Onc might think that the men living at 
Moreau Seminary would feel lonely, or 
alienated from the rest of the NOtre Dame 

community a.~ a resulr of the seminary's 
hx:ation. Tomsovic and Skypeck are quick 
to contradict. 
"We are encouraged to be involved 
with both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's so 

we arc notloncly," said Tomsovic. "We 
arc cncouragcd to bring our friends to our 
anivitics here." 
Tomsovic has certainly answered his calling to a social life. He plays both clarinet and bass clarinet and is a member of the marching band, the concert band, and "other various musical ensembles." He is also the editor of the band's newspaper. 
All of the seminarians are required to do some social work for which they are not paid. This service is called an apost­olate and is worked into the men's daily schedules. 
There are various ways the men offer their services. Tomsovic has been a Sunday schoolttacher and ha.~ played basketball with handicapped children. "I lndergraduates are encouraged to work through the Center for Social Concerns," he added. 
The Moreau community ha.~ various at:tivitir~ to promote fellowsrln 1'1'l!lolf thesell'" 1.1ri:m~ accordin11.  Skypcck "We ha\ morning and evcOIII)' prayer and daily mass. We eat our meals together and must do the dishes once a week" There are also other household chores which the students complete together. 
In addition to these daily duties, there arc weekly events for the seminarians and !heir guests "just to be together" said Skypeck. 
"Every Thursday we have a soiree," he explained. "We have a mass, a rather good dinner, and evening prayer. The soiree then follows until the last person leaves." The costume party previously mentioned was the soiree on Halloween night. 
"I think there is more ofa sense of community here than in a dorm," said Tomsovic." 
Life in the seminary is different from 

living in a dorm in other ways, too. 
"All ofour rooms are singles. We don't have parietals. We do have 'house obediences,'" explained Tomsovic. "We also have better food," Skypeck added. 
House obediences are the household chores the men are required to do, of which there are four types. The social commission is in charge of keeping the recreation rooms clean. Keeping the cars running and taking care ofthe kitchen are the stewardship commission's respon­sibility. The mission and education com­missions take care ofthe library and seminar rooms, while the prayer commis­sion keeps the chapel clean and the pews polished, among other things. 
"We are encour­aged to be involved with both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's so we are not lonely." 
"The building is a seminary ofyes­
teryear, though," one seminarian said. "It 
wa.~ built so that every sound can be heard 
by everyone, including snoring." 
"Even though we don't have anything 
like parietals, we have respect for others," 
explained Skyspeck. "Because sound does 
travel so much and guys are studying or 
trying to sleep, we'll go to one ofour 
rec-rooms or the dining room ifwe have 
friends over." 
Overall, the men living in Moreau don't seem to feel isolated from the rest ofthe Notre Dame community. They have their fun and they have their goals. "We have a real community within this house," said Skyspeck, summing it up.

Ticket dilemma shows how students are treated 

I walked into my apartment the other day and was startled to find my roommate sprawled out on the couch, his rear end propped up on five pillows and an ice bag placed gingerly across his nose. 
Mike Wilkins 

here, there and back 
"Skip a car payment?" I quizzed. 
"Worse. I went to the ACC." 
"Football players on a rampage again?" 
"No, I went to the basketball stadium." 

"I heard Digger has been pushing the boys pretty hard." 
"I wouldn't know, I couldn't tell from where I was. I went to the ACC to check out our seats for basketball season, you know, just to see ifthey were as bad as we really thought they were." 
"And?" 

"Well, I walked up into the bleachers and found our seats and sat down and started watching practice, but Icouldn't see anything. Tim Kempton looked like he was one foot tall and David Rivers just looked like a fly buzzing all over the place." 
"Pretty bad, eh?" "That's just the beginning. I went to get up out ofmy seat and I, well, 1..." "You didn't fall off of the bleachers did you?" I asked disgustedly. "No. I got splinters in my butt." 
I laughed, but the humor of the situation seemed to escape him. 
"It's not funny. I mean it, I went to get out of my seat and I got these splinters in my tail. It hurts like crazy. I want my padded seat back." 
"What happened to your nose, scrape it on the rafters?" "No, while I was up there I got a nosebleed. Must have been the altitude." 
"Get serious." 

"This is serious. This is our fifth year here and we finally have a chance to see a truly gifted basketball team. And where are we sit­ting? In the bleachers. We won't be able to tell the difference between Barlow's baseline jumpers and Royal's slam dunks. Something is wrong here." 
"But they ran out of student tickets in the padded seats. Then they ran out of student tickets period." 
"Well, that's a crock. You would think after following that team for four years, we would get a better treatment. I mean, I went to all those games -games against teams that sounded, and played, more like they were a large dorm than a small college. Now I get a chance to see a true national contender and I am not even close enough to tell what color we are wearing." 
"Come on, the seats can't be that bad." 
"The point isn't how bad the seats are, the 
point is that we should not be punished just 
because we already have our degree and have 
decided to come back here for more school. 
The Double Domers should be getting first 
pick of tickets. We should at least be sitting with the seniors instead of with the sop­homores. We've paid our dues. We've backed the team for four years. Our butts deserve padded seats. Besides, we won't be able to see Stupid Cheerleader Tricks." 
"Just be glad you're not a freshman. Some of the freshman didn't get tickets at all." 
"That's even worse. It just goes to show where the students rank around here: some­where between the alumni and the pond scum -and I thinkwe are closer to being in the pond than being in the padded seats. 
"So what are you going to do?" 

"I'm going to clean my binoculars, pack my nose with cotton and stuff a pillow down the back ofmy pants. And ifthat doesn't work, I'm going to go down and sit in Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski's seat. And I'm going to bring about 200 freshmen with me. He took our seats, the least he can do is give us his." 
"Great idea. Think it will work?" 

"Sure. We'll call it the Pond Scum Section. Even if we don't get to sit there, at least they won't have to change the name."

Theatre going holds many advantages over movies 
When you are looking for something to do on a weekend night, how often have you con­sidered going to the theatre? If you are like most people, you probably have not given it much thought. And that is really unfortunate, foe the theatre can be a great experience. 
William Wilson 

the word most mangled 
It is really quite strange how people who give no second thought to going to see a movie will not even begin to consider going to see a play. What is the basis for their prejudice against theatre? 
Everyone should support their local theatre organization, and there are many ways to do this. The most obvious and simplest is to at­tend performances. While I don't mean to take anything away from movies, there are many things about the theatre that make attending a play worthwhile. For one, theatre offers a live performance with real people. This can be quite exciting. Going to see a show with a date and saying to him or her that you know the person onstage is quite impressive. You might even be surprised and see one ofyour friends onstage, which would explain why he or she seemed to disappear for a few hours each night for several weeks. In addition, how many people can go to a movie and honestly say they know Harrison Ford or Clint Eastwood? 
One ofthe most exciting things about a live performance is the ability of the audience to look for things other than what is going on in

the spotlight. In a movie, we can see only what the director wants us to see. But in the theatre, we can look at different things and look at the whole play from a different perspective. In ad­dition, the audience has the ability to affect the performance and make the performance strong or weak. This cannot be done while viewing a movie. 
Most people think the theatre is too "heavy." This is not true. While many plays have some strong message, they are at the same time funny, sad and very entertaining. One need only look at the recent production of "End of the World" by Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre to know that this statement is true. 
And not every play has some deep social message. Many have been written for simple entertainment. In fact, nearly every play has just as much potential for entertainment as a movie. And let us not forget many plays have become movies, such as "Amadeus." Some people feel they don't want to go see ·a play because they know nothing about it. Yet people will still spend four dollars to go see a movie they know little about. All one needs to do is to ask someone what the play is about. We are lucky here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's because we can easily call up the box office or the theatre department and ask about the show. 
Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre is only one of the many local theatre organizations we will encounter in our lifetimes. When we go home over the summer, we can find at least one theatre ~n up in our hometowns which would love our .,upport. 
Another w:w ~o support your local theatre is to become involved in working on a production. Anyone who has done this can tell you that 1l is au experience unlike any ot-
Garry Trudeau 

her -to work for several weeks and turn out a product that sparkles is a great feeling. If you think there is a Dustin Hoffman inside you bursting to get out, tryout for a role in a per­formance. One does not need to worry about the leading role; there are several supporting roles which are just as important. If you are not an actor, there are many other things which you can do: one can work on lights, sound, stage crew, set construction; the list is endless. 
But attending performances is the best way to support your local theatre group. You don't need to get dressed up to go, unless you are going to see a show on Broadway, and even here dressing up is not a requirement. But for most ofus, we can wear to a play exactly what we would wear to a movie. And at the same time, one can get dressed up and go to dinner before the show, making for a great evening. The price usually is not that large of a factor either. Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre usually charges four dollars for a play which is less than or equal to the cost of one movie admission. ­
So the next time you are looking for some­thing to do, why not try a play? During the rest of the year, Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre is putting on productions, all ofwhich should be great. Forget any bad experiences you have had with high school drama. To find out more about these productions, call the theatre department at your school. And don't forget to support your local theatre groups when you go home over semester break or for the summer. They too will be offering excellent entertainment worth your while.

Women priests will be 
necessary in the future 
Dear Editor: 
Terry K.ibeltis' article In the Nov. 11 Obser­ver was very thought-provoking. Though I do not profess to he a "woman's-llbber", I agree that the Catholic Church should reconsider its position on the Issue of woman as priests. In this day and age, when the number of priests and seminarians Is rapidly declining, I believe women priests will be a necessity for the Church to survive. I have no doubt that the ability of women to be priests is as good, or even better, than many men. Ifthe Catholic Church truly wants the best for Its followers, then it should allow the priesthood to be open to all. The old traditions of the Church are beautiful in many ways, yet through Vatican II and other such reform movements, they must be changed for, the good of the people. After all, the Church Is the people of God. Contrary to the belief of many, the people of God are !loth men and women.

Student thanks friends who helped in bad time 
/Jear Editor: 
In August of 19H3. I entered the University of Notre Dame. Driving up Notre Dame Avenue, I was awed by the sight of the Dome, and by all the people coming to school. But the thing that impressed me most was the way the uppercla.~smen attempted to help the freshmen make a smooth tram;ition into col­lege life. 
This spirit and kindness best exemplified it­self to me this past week. On Monday, Nov. 4, my sister Joan committed suicide. It is a tragedy when a 17-year-old dies, and it seems even more so when it Is someone in your own family. 
The spoken words, the flowers, and the cards were all greatly appreciated. The list of people who displayed such kindness is too long to name everyone, but I would like thank two people in pi,U"ticular. To Father Edward "Monk" Malloy goes my deepest thanks. He had the unenviable position of being the per­son to tell me what had happened, and was a great comfort. And to Pam Butler goes my love. She will never know how much joy I felt when she walked Into the church. 
So to all of those in the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community, I extend my thanks to all of you who helped me through this difficult time.

University has acted to defeat own objectives 
Dear Editor: 
I would like the readers ofThe Observer to reflect on the following statements regarding the recent actions of the University against two parietals violators. 
Any community which overtly seeks to stimulate the essentially positive and com­munal aspects of human beings in its society, which seeks to promote the expression of compassion among Its people in an effort to Increase cohesion, and which prepares legislation to achieve these tenets, must do so In a just and cautiously reflective manner. 
Christian communities strive to achieve thesr goals. Notre Damr strives to realize these goals as a Christian community; however. the University recently has acted in a manner counter-productive w these goals. 
The University has told two students to 
temporarily leave the University because one 
student was promoting and exercising com­
passion by consoling a fellow student. The 
University ignored the intentions of the stu­
dents and parochially looked only at the inad­
vertent violation of parletals regulations. In 
addition, the social ramifications ofa parietals 
violation can, unfortunately, be slanderous. 
Anyone of authority, from the security 
guard to Associate Vice President for 
Residence Life John Goldrick, from Vice Presi­
dent of Student Affairs Father David lryson to 
University President Father Theodore Hes­
burgh, who had any chance to exercise under­
standing in the situation, failed to do so, and in 
a manner counter-productive to the cohesive 
and compassionate ideals for which a Chris­
tian community strives. 
In an effort to enforce a rule which the Uni­
versity validly deems constructive and 
positive, it has alienated many students and 
faculty through Its ignorant and unreflective 
actions against those students involved. 
The University had the compassion and in­
telligence to judge the intentions of the stu­
dents as honest and innocent. The University 
failed to employ compassion and intelligence 
in Its ultimate decision. The University has not 
acted as a cohesion-seeking authority. It has 
rather made abominable the very notions of 
compassion and understanding. 
Therefore, the University should reverse its 
judgment and reverse its actions against the 
students. A constructive and compassionate 
community should not remove its law 
violators, it should act rather to rectify the 
situation; and in this case, the violation was 
unintentional and completely unharmful. 
The University should learn from those it 
has dismissed in this case what it means to be 
compassionate. It should apologize to the stu­
dents and faculty in order to regain the 
ground it has lost be alienating itself, and so 
learn the importance of reconciliation.

Blumb should 'get clue' before hurting morale 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to talk about a couple ofthings pertaining to Notre Dame football. First, I want to say Tom Galloway's article was good. You students who booed Steve Beuerlein at the Navy game are total zeros. He is a Notre Dame player -you should be ashamed ofyour­selves. 
Second, I would like to comment on Jeff Blumb's article about facts and whatever else on Nov. l. I understand that The Observer is an independent newspaper and their reporters have the freedom to write what they want, but get a clue guy. I am not disputing any ofthe facts, that is not the point. The. point is that you are bringing down Notre Dame morale. People are aware of your facts and your efforts are negatively affecting fans. You keep saying that the Irish could possibly go undefeated the rest of the season, but that Is very unlikely. Duh. So what are you saying to the players and students, "Get ready for a loss"? Sure, going undefeated is not easy -its not easy for anybody. We have got a good thing going, why do you have to tiy and ruin It? I don't think criticizing Gerry Faust in the middle of the season benefits Notre Dame football and fans. 
Although The Observer is independent, I wish the sports people would be positive about Notre Dame football. Don't coat your articles with candy, but don't do it with salt either. Build on our positive points. Increase student morale. The power of positive think­ing does wonders -unlike telling somebody they are not very good or they are just lucky or wait till next year.

Cancel of referendum in students' best interest 
DearEditor: 
urely, headlines have blared the negative word "postponed" in reference to the nesottatlons and work being done within the Hall Presidents' Council. The word does not accurately reflect the activity and has caused the HPC to fall victim to condensed press coverage. 
The postponement was not a result ofa loss of the two-thirds majority needed to send the proposal to the student body. It was done as an act of concern for the governmental structure and the opinions ofthe student, not as a result of the Inadequacy of the HPC. Wit­hin this action may also exist the effort to avoid the creation of a senate as a campaign tool to be promised and abolished every few years. The conflicting views within HPC which have arisen during negotiations have 
made the membel'!l a'WlU'C of the rough transi­
tion they would face under the proposc:d 
amendment -that of establishing HPC as an 
increasingly political body, rather than a 
single voice within the political structure. 
Such a realization is good cause for alarm. 
Top priority in the minds of the hall presi­
dents Is the respect of their constituents. To 
lose this would be to lose the effectiveness for 
which they strive. No other elected student 
body better represents the frustrations, satis­
factions, motivations, concerns, and spirit of 
the Notre Dame student. It Is a prlviledge 
which they respect and do not want to 
jeop~dlze at any cost. Have faith In the deci­
sions ofthe HPC. 
No document or organization will ever be 
flawless. No hasty action will ever be free from 
reconsideration. The price of a belabored 
reconsideration is too h.igh to pay when the 
effects of a carefully considered decision can 
be enjoyed within a reasonably short period 
oftime. 
Kathy McCarthy Breen-Pbtllips Hall President 

Students did not treat Hickey with politeness 
DearEditor: . 
William Hickey, the director of Univel'!lity 
Food Services, calls the Night Oak Cafe "more 
of a headache than anything else." I would 
have said unhesitatingly "Right on," except 
that more annoying to him must be the man­
ner Kurt Weidmann, The Observer, and ot­
hers went about having the "Night Oak Open" 
sign removed. 
Sure, the sign looks tacky over the entrance 
to a gothic-romantic style hall. However, 
couldn't protestors have gone politely to 
Hickey fil'!lt? How about judging h.is motiva­
tion as selfish pride or profit? How about a few 
words of appreclation for a director and staff 
that have worked in an unselfish and un­
heralded manner to turn around the manifold 
aspects of University Food Service? How 
about some sensitivity and gratitude from the 
people who prattle so much about their per­
sonal and social concern?

With the loss, Notre Dame's record drops to 10·17, while the Boilermakers' victory gives them a 26-3 mark. 
Throughout the game Purdue played with the confidence ofa team with 25 wins against an opponent that is still trying to build a com­petitive program. They were very confident, almost cocky · and with reason. 
Statistically, they beat the Irish in almost every category. Purdue had six service aces to the lone Irish ace, set at at .500 compared to Notre Dame's .284.

Michigan will be one of Midwest's toughest 
Assoclatcd Press 
Michigan Coach Bill Frieder, who perhaps has the best college basket­ball team in the Midwest and maybe in the nation, gets skittish when talk turns to Top Twenty rankings. 
"You're not going to get me to talk about the ratings. They're nice for the fans and all that, but I'm not going to get caught up in it," he said. "The nice thing about our sport is that it's all decided in March and then there's no doubt who's No.1." 
The Wolverines were Big Ten Conference champions and ranked second nationally at the end of last season. They had a 26-4 record and won 1 7 games in a row losing to Vil­lanova, the eventual NCAA cham­pion. 
This season, they return all five starters. 
There's no weakness in a lineup that boasts 6-foot-11 senior Roy Tarpley, the Big Ten's most valuable player, at center, and guards Gary Grant and AntoineJoubert. 
Add 6-7 freshman Glen Rice, Mic­
higan's high school"Mr. Basketball," 
to that group and Frieder's only fear 
is that his players might be 
overcome with their own celebrity. 
"That's my biggest concern," he 
said. "These kids have got to go out 
and win it on the floor. They can't be 
affected by what they read in the 
papers or hear on television." 
The Big Ten sent a league record 
six teams into the NCAA tourna­
ment, but Illinois, 26-9, was the only 
team to do well, before losing in the 
Eastern Regional semifinals to Geor­
gia Tech. Coach Lou Henson has 
four of his five starters back, includ­
ing stellar guards Bruce Douglas and

Associated Press 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. Rookies 
Stephane Richer and Kjell Dahlin 
scored a goal apiece and rookie 
Patrick Roy kicked out 26 shots 
Tuesday night to lead the Montreal 
Canadiens to a 3-2 National Hockey 
League victory over the New York 
Islanders. 
Richer scored the only goal of the 
first period and Dahlin connected in 
the second to give the Canadiens a 
2-0 lead. Roy made the lead stand up 
with some sharp saves in goal as 
Montreal extended its .unbeaten 
streak to five games ( 3·0· 2 ). The vic­
tory also snapped New York's four­
game unbeaten streak. 
Richer scored his ninth goal ofthe 
season when he knocked in a 
rebound, following a shot by Chris 
Nilan, from the side of the net at 
12:08 of the first period. 
Dahlin scored off a neat pass from Guy Carbonneau from in front ofthe net at 12:57 of the second period. The goal was the eighth of the season by Dahlin. 
Pat Flatley's seventh goal of the season off a rebound ofhis own shot from inside the faceoff circle at the 
15:07 mark of the second period trimmed Montreal's lead to a goal. 
But Chris Chelios made it 3-1 on a wrist shot from inside the blue line on a power play at 5:42 of the final period. 
John Tonelli scored his sixth goal of the season on a power play, with 3 7 seconds left in the game after the Islanders had pulled goalie Billy Smith. Mike Bossy and Bryan Trot­tier got a'isists.

Iowa, 21-11, replaces departed twin towers Greg Stokes and Mic­hael Payne with 7-0 redshirt Brad Lohaus. Coach George Raveling has to solve the Hawkeyes' late-season slides. Getting increased production from starting guards Andre Banks andJeff Moe could be the key. 
Indiana, which suffered through Coach Bobby Knight's first losing season in the 1984-85 conference, is the darkhorse. But the picture is brightened with Olympian Steve Al­ford having one more year of ex­perience, and the additions ofjunior college transfer Andre Harris and freshman Ricky Calloway. 
Poll on page 10 
Notre Dame, led by sophomore point guard David Rivers, likely will be the highest-ranked of the Mid­west's strong independents. 
But Coach Joey Meyer's DePaul team, better adjusted to its young coach and stronger with 6-9 forward Dallas Comegys, figures to push the Irish for that distinction. 
Notre Dame could be better than last season, when the Irish were 21­9, but a schedule that includes North Carolina, Duke, Louisiana State, In· diana and DePaul home-and-home might mask the improvement. 
A lack of outside shooting hurt DePaul last season. Freshman Rod­ney Strickland could cushion the loss of point guard Kenny Patterson and solve the outside shootingwoes.

Kansas City Royals pitcher Bret Saberbagen sbows bis style in tbe seventh game of the World Series against tbe St. Louis Cardinals on October 
Saberhagen outdistances Guidry to claim A.L. Cy Young Award 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CllY, Mo. · Bret Saber· hagen, who won two games for Kansas City in the Royals' World Series victory over the St. Louis Car­dinals, Monday became the youngest pitcher in American League history to win the Cy Young Award. 
"This is great for me and great for Kansas City," the 21-year-old right· hander said at a news conference. 
Saberhagen, only three years out of high school in southern Califor· nia, was .earlier named the World Series' Most Valuable Player. 
In his second year in the major leagues, Saberhagen posted a 20-6 record with an ERA of 2.87. With remarkable control and poise and sharp command of several pitches, he had 158 strikeouts and issued only 38 walks. 
"An award like this is definitely a team .award," he said. "If you don't have 25 guys fighting for you every time you go out there, then you don't lllave a chance." 
Saberhagen's wife, Janeane, gave birth to their first child, Drew Wil· liam, the day before Saberhagen pitched the Royals' 11·0 victory over St. Louis in the seventh game of the World Series. He admitted with a laugh that he may have trouble top· ping his storybook season next year. 
"I guess all I can do is try to win 21 games, win three World Series games and have twins," he said with a laugh. 
Saberhagen admitted that he was surprised at his big margin ofvictory in voting by members ofthe Baseball Writers Association of America. He was named on 27 of 28 ballots and received 23 first-place votes, gather· ing 127 points to 88 for runner-up Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees. 
John Schuerholz, Royals general manager, appeared with Saberhagen at the news conference and ad· mitted, "The success we've had this year is almost hard to comprehend." 
"None of it would have been pos· sible without a lot of hard working and dedicated players like Bret Saberhagen. We're very proud of him," Schuerholz said. 
The right-hander said he planned ~o work hard in the off-season and come back a better pitcher next year. 
"My curveball and my slider aren't where I want them to be," he said. "There's always room for improve· ment. Maybe I can put on a few pounds and throw the ball a little harder next year." 
Saberhagen is the first Kansas City pitcher to win the award and only the fifth from the American League West. Saberhagen, who turned 21 on April 11, was the fifth youngest pitcher in major league history to win 20 games. 
Guidry was the only pitcher named on all 28 ballots· two writers from each of the AL's 14 cities. Saberhagen was not selected by Ray Sons ofthe Chicago Sun-Times, who had Minnesota's Bert Blyleven first, Royals reliever Dan Quisenberry second and Guidry third. 
Saberhagen was the Royals' ace, leading Kansas City's charge to the AL west title, the American League pennant and World Series. He pitched complete games to win the third and seventh games of the Series, though his postseason ac· hievements did not figure In the voting, which was conducted prior to the playoffs. 
At one point, Saberhagen won seven consecutive decisions and had another five-game winning streak. 
As a rookie In 1984, Saberhagen was 10·11. 
Guidry, who won the award in 1978, was 22·6 with a 3.27 ERA, two shutouts in 11 complete games and 143 strikeouts in 259 innings this year. 
Guidry, 35, rebounded from the worst season ofhis nine-year career · he was 10·11 in 1984 ·to help the Yankees finish second in the AL East. He won six of his last seven starts and had a streak In which he won 12 straight decisions. 
Blyleven, the league's strikeout leader with 206, was third with 9 points. He was a combined 17·16 ith a 3. 16 ERA for Cleveland and the Twins, to whom he was traded in August. Blyleven had one first-place vote and four for third. 
Points were awarded on a 5· 3·1 basis. 
Others receiving votes were Quisenberry, Charlie Leibrandt of Kansas City, Doyle Alexander of Toronto, Britt Burns of Chicago, reliever Donnie Moore ofCalifornia, Toronto's Dave Stieb, and Mike Moore ofSeattle.

Experienced offensive tackle 

Perrino anchors veteran Irish line 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's Mike Perrino is a 
perfect example of a veteran player, 
whose poise and knowledge of the 
game can a decisive factor in the 
final outcome. A strong tackle, Per­
rino is part of an all senior starting 
offensive line, which has been 
playing together for the last few 
years. 
Experience can be the difference 
between winning and losing. It is the 
experienced athlete, such as Per-

Mike Perrino 

·rino, who plays best under pressure and is able to make the most of his ability, taking advantage of the op­ponent's weaknesses. 
And with this of{esive line, familiarity has not bred discontent, but rather, development of the players as a group. Perrino said he believes that the offensive front five have a distinct advantage over younger players in the crucial situa­tions. 
"We're a tight group, having played together the last few years. We work really well together," ex­plains Perrino. "In the presssure situations, we don't get flustered. When's it's fourth-and-two, we feel that's what we're here for, to get the job done." 
The Elmhurst, Ill. resident has, indeed, been getting the job done during his career at Notre Dame. Perrino has played in 32 games, 28 of which he has started. Head of­fensive line coach Carl Selmer said he is confident of the abilities of the starting strong tackle. 
"He's big and strong and a very good pass. blocker. He's a smart player, who makes split second deci­sions at a very difficult position. He makes very quick adjustments, when the circumstances call for them," says Selmer. 
Besides beingan outstandingfoot­ball player at York High School, the 6-5, 278 lb. senior was also an im­pressive wrestler. As a high school junior, Perrino was 31-4 and set a school record with 1 7 pins. He won the Illinois Wrestling Federation heavyweight title and also finished fifth in the U.S. Wrestling Federation, a natonal meet. 
Rather than risk injury, the highly recruited Perrrino did not compete in wrestling in his senior in high school year,but said that his football skills have benefitted from wres­tling. 

Lindbergh dead after tragic auto accident 
Asllodated Press 
STRATFORD, N.J.-The parents of hockey star Pelle Lindbergh said their goodbyes to their brain-dead son Tuesday after giving doctors permission to remove his organs for transplant donations. 
Philadelphia Flyers team physician Edward Viner said that the org&ns probably would be removed "within the next 24 hours" but that Undbergh's elderly parents wanted more time with their only son before allowing the operation to begin. 
"Privately, they must hope there could be a miracle ... but they're anxious not to lose the potential of helping others," Viner said of the family's decision to donate Lindbergh's vital organs. 
"From a purely medical point of view, he's been dead since 5:40a.m. Sunday," said Viner, who described Undbergh's existence as "a state of semi-living." 
Sigge Lindbergh flew from Sweden Monday to his son's bedside, where the goaltender's mother, Anna-Lisa, and fiance, Kerstin Pietzsch, have kept a vigil since the accident. 
Lindbergh, 26, was legally drunk when he left an after-hours bar and drove his red Porsche 930 into a concrete wall in front ofa Somerdale elementary school, authorities said. 

Free agents negotiate 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Major league baseball's largest group of free agents had the opportunity to negotiate with any team starting Tuesday amid indications that club owners will hold the line on big salaries and long-term contracts. 
Eleven players beat the Monday 
midnight deadline, bringing the to­
taJ to 63, the biggest number to file 
since the process began in 1976. 
As part of new labor contract 
reached in August, this marks the 
first year that players do not have to 
go through a re-entry draft, which 
limited each free agent's dealings to 
13 teams. 
Such teams as the Kansas City 
Royals, Texas Rangers, Cleveland In­
dians, Philadelphia Phillies, Los An­
geles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, 
Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros and 
even the New York Yankees, to a 
smaller degree, have claimed they 
presently have no plans to enter the 
free agent market. 
The last 1 1 players to file included 
Hal McRae, veteran designated hit­
ter for the world champion Royals, 
and infielder Bobby Grieb ofCalifor­
nia. The others were infielders 
Dickie Thon ofHouston, Tony Perez of Cincinnati, Ivan Dejesus of St. Louis, Indians outfielder Benny Ayala, and pitchers Bruce Kison of Boston, Bart johnson of the White Sox, Marty Bystrom of the Yankees, Mike Norris and Tommy john of Oakland. 
The biggest prize is slugging out­fielder Kirk Gibson, who made S68S,OOO last season and opted for free agency when the Tigers offered him a three-year deal. 
Don Fehr, acting executive direc­tor of the Major League Players As­sociation, said he is wary about the owners adopting a tougher policy on free agents. · 
"There's a new (free agent) sys­tem in effect now, and it's too early to tell if'the owners are attempting to destroy it," he said. 
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, said, "This isn't collusion or anything remotely like that. It's just a matter of everybody getting dis­gusted with the way they've been conducting business, and I'm as guilty as anyone." 
Dick Balderson, Mariners' vice president, said he isn't impressed by the available free agents this year. 
"The quality out there is not the quality there was last year or in the past," he said. 
"Wrestling was a lot of fun, but I 
knew my future was in football. It 
did help, though, for body control 
and my physical development. It 
also gave me a sens,e of balance," 
noted Perrino. 
On most teams, offc!nsive linemen 
receive little credit for their efforts 
but at Notre Dame, Perrino said that 
linemen are more appreciated. He 
also said that the success of Allen 
Pinckett brings some personal satis­
faction. 
"At Notre Dame, almost everyoqe 
is in the spotlight. Also, blocking for 
Allen the last three years, I hope thitt 
I'm partly responsible for his success 
and that I've helped him achieve his 
records. Not everyone notices, but I 
know what I have done," explained 
Perrino. 
The economics major has his sights set on Penn State this week as the Irish prepare to meet the number-one ranked team. Perrino said that the Nittany Lions must be wary ofplaying Notre Dame. 
"This is what Notre Dame is 
known for, knocking offthe number­
one teams. This is the bread-and­
butter of our season. We must play our game like we did last year. 
"I can't believe they have im­proved that much and we have got­ten worse. We have also improved a lot. There must be some doubt in their minds because it's basically the same teams as last year," notes Per­rino. 
Notre Dame will be counting on experienced players like Perrino to lead the Irish to vicltOry. 

Mike Perrino stands up a Purdue defensive lineman on a pass play earlier this season. Perrino and tbe rest of tbe experienced Irish offensive line have matured as a unit to provide tailback Al­len Pinkett large boles in recent victories.

Irish volleyball team drops match to Purdue 
ByKATHLEEN McKERNAN 
SportsWriter 
They had their moments. But un­fonunately for the Irish women, those moments were not too long or too frequent, as Purdue easily defeated Notre Dame's volleyball team 15-7, 15-l 0, 15-9 last night at theACC. 
"We played well in spots, poorly in others," Notre Dame Head Coach Art Lambert said after the loss, "and with a team like Purdue you can't do that." 
The Boilermakers, 16th-ranked in the nation proved to be too much for the inconsistent Irish. 
Purdue's senior all-America canididate Marianne Smith paced their attack with 15 kills, while teammates Lisa Reichl and Kim Cor­win contributed 12 and 11 respectively. While Notre Dame's Karen Sapp had 1 0 kills herself, the Irish hit for the paltry percentage of .153. 
"Our middle killed us both on of­fense and defense," Coach Lambert admitted. "We couldn't take care of the quick stuff in the middle." 
Notre Dame did have the momen­tum for briefperiods in all three sets. They had the lead in the first set 6-2 at one point; they also managed to retain possession for as many as three or ·four points before losing the momentum to Purdue time outs and side outs. 
Sapp's performance, Kathleen Morin's team leading 12 digs, and a strong effort from freshman Zanette Bennett kept Notre Dame in each game. Soon, however, Purdue brought in their own freshman as

Stanford makes finals with 1-0 win over Hogs

Sports Writer 
The torrential downpour of rain that stopped just before gametime soaked Canier Field, but could not stop the Stanford soccer team as they pulled out a victory last night over Holy Cross, 1-0. 
The Hogs had their backs to the wall as they could not afford to lose the finals ofthe loser's bracket, in or­der to meet Off-Campus in the championships. 
The Hogs came out strong on the offensive in the first half dominating play. 
"We had a lot of opponunities, but their defense played well. Their team would bend but would not break," said Holy Cross captain Frank Laughlin. 
Both captains felt that the rain drenched turf affected the play of the teams as time after time players lost their footing.

The Irish women's team is not likely to have any signings today. Notre Dame coach Mary DiStanislao is still waiting to hear from two recruits and could find out their decisions today.

Some policy changes needed in college athletics 
Last Saturday, fate allowed college football a reprieve, but policy changes will be needed in order to repair the sad state ofcollege athletics. 
The Georgia Bulldogs -although having had a run-in or two with the NCAA themselves over violations -took the cause ofjustice into their game with the Florida Gators and emerged victorious, 24-3. This defeat forced the Gators out oftheir number-one spot in the Associated Press poll, a situation that had angered many. 
You see, Florida has been proven guilty ofviolating over 100 NCAA rules in relation to its football program under former Head Coach Charley Pell. The Gators have broken the rules to get where they are now. Why should they be rewarded in any way? 
They shouldn't be, and that is exactly what is wrong. 
Although the Georgia victory will in all likelihood prevent the Gators -a team on probation -from winning the national championship in the AP poll, there was clearly a possibility ofthis happening beforehand. With only three more victories, Florida would have sat out a New Year's Day bowl because of sanctions against them, but almost cenainly would have emerged as the national champion in that poll generally given most weight by those across the country. 
Because of the violations, the Gators vyere placed on three years probation. They are not allowed to go to a bowl game, cannot win the SEC title and cannot be shown on television. This is all in addition to a reduction in the num­ber offootball scholarships the school can offer in the com­ing years. But this is still not enough punishment, because an analysis ofthe situation uncovers many parties that con­tinue to gain despite the wrongdoings. 
One can begin with the school itself. Although a school on probation is not allowed to appear in the UPI poll (voted on by coaches), the AP poll enforces no such rulings. Its position is to merely look at a team's record and its schedule, and to rank in accordance with those factors. Ifa team plays Division I college football, it has the oppur­tunity to be ranked, whether on probation or not. 

Eric Scheuermann 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Many do, as they should, disagree with that. A team that cheats should not be allowed to benefit from that action, as Florida"does when it is allowed to finish high in the AP poll. In fact, the question comes up as to why the team should not be forced to disband for a certain time period. Florida's success now, at least in part possible because ofpast cheat­ing, cannot help but lead to more,success in the future. 
"How long do we just keep grinning and patting the kids on the back and huning college football?" asked Douglas Looney of Sports illustrated. "Something must be changed." 
Only harsher penalties wm help to end the constant cheating that goes on. If a school and boosters of that school know that the school could conceivably lose its program ifinfractions are discovered, you can be sure they will be less likely to risk anything. 
Galen Hall, head coach of the Gators since Pell's ouster last year, also benefits a bit from the situation. Florida boast a 15-1-1 record under Hall, and has been labeled a genius by fellow coaches. But the fact remains -even if the cheating has stopped under Hall -that there are players helping the Gators win today that are only there because of recruiting violations. 
And before one passes Hall off as the white knight in this fiasco, it is interesting to note that not only was he an assis­tant under Pell at the time ofthe violations, but he was also an assistant under Barry Switzer at Oklahoma in 1974. That year's Sooner team was, strangely enough, the last team on NCAA probation to win a national championship. 
Finally, perhaps the biggest gainers in this mockery of college athletics are those players receiving the illegal pay­ments to attend a certain school. At this point, athletes risk absolutely nothing by accepting payments. Even if the violation is discovered, the player is not punished. 
Thus, a player receives the best of both worlds. He can be "taken care of' by his school, without worrying about anything happening if the school is found out. Many ath­letes that received payments at Florida are still playing for the Gators, with chances to advance to professional foot­ball. 
"The same athletes involved in violations are the same ones getting pro contracts," said Notre Dame head basket­ball coach Digger Phelps. "Take away their eligibility based on the extent of the infraction and see what happens." 
It is not hard to see what would happen. Ifa star athlete knew his college athletic eligibility would be taken away if he was found accepting payments, he would be less likely to accept this money. After all, it is usually an athlete's per­formance in college sports that leads to a professional career. 
It does "take two to tango." This way, the athlete would be punished as well as the school. 
Last week, a tradition-filled basketball program also was under seige. Repons published in the Lexington Herald­Leader alleged widespread violations of rules in the Ken­tucky basketball program during former coachJoe B. Hall's 13-year tenure. 
The way the Wildcat fans reacted to the reports is an example of what is wrong with college sports. It is the opinion that cheating is fine because the risk ofsuch action is so low. The benefits to be received far outweigh costs that will most probably never be felt. 
"I've been bred here like a fine horse," said Wildcat sup­porter Mrs. Coburn Cashman, "and ifI want to give them a thousand dollars, ifI want to give them a car, so be it. Ifthe boosters are going to give (the players) something, that's great. I think those boys work their tails off." 
That is the attitude that must be changed in college ath­letics.
