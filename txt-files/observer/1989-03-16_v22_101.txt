_I,I¥JIi:Ueiii1M,_ 
Do unto others: 


The Golden Rule applied 
When I stop and think about it, I am often incredulous at the enormous capacity people have to make fun of anything and everything. 
When I was riding up the chair lift last week during my four-day stint on the ski slopes, for example, I did not waste the opportunity to serenade my partner with an off-key rendition of "Annie's Song" when I saw someone skiing 

below me who was probably John Denver's long­lost twin brother. 
I must admit, I also enjoyed a few laughs at the expense of the ski instructors. It was diffi­~ult to keep a straight face and inwardly spec­ulate what kind of toothpaste they used to keep their teeth so white they even stood out in all the snow. 
Whatever their motives, I have never met anyone whom I haven't known to indulge in this type of so-called humor at one time or another. It's as much a part of being human as waking up in the morning. 
While most people do it in the interest of en­tertainment, rather than because of an inherent desire to be malicious, it might be useful for everyone to stop and think whether the John Denvers of this world would appreciate their quips if they could hear them. Maybe my John Denver clone believes that looking the way he does is social suicide in 1989.1f he does, I haven't helped his image problem. 
I suppose I learned my lesson the hard way, since my own name has been the cause of some less-than-pleasant encounters over the years. There have been times, in my weaker moments, when I have wished with all my heart that my last name was Smith. It's not a particularly original name, but I wouldn't have to worry about tactless phone calls at 3 am. after some­one with a few too many beers under his belt discovered my name in the directory. 
I took it personally, at first, even though I knew that chances were my charming, anonymous caller couldn't pick me out on the quad. It eventually dawned on me that this was a more tactless version of what I mentioned earlier: Man's natural tendency to enjoy laughs at others' expense. This revelation helped to boost my ego, since I now know that these mys­terious charmers weren't harboring a personal vendetta against me. It did not, however, curb my temper. 
That's when I realized that maybe sometimes I was guilty of the same thing. Granted, I wasn't obnoxious enough to walk right up to Chip or Biff or Muffy (or whatever it is ski instructors call themselves these days) and actually ask them if there was any space for rent between their ears. That's not to say I didn't sharpen

my ability to toss out one-liners when they were out of earshot. I never took into account whether that might be a sensitive subject for them, since I wasn't intending to degrade them personally. I'm just a sucker for a good one-liner, and the victims of my lightning wit happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Even though it infuriates me that some people have so little class that they are willing to dis­rupt my life to insult me, I force myself to re­member that while I have more tact than that, I've been guilty too. Nobody likes being slapped in the face for something they can't do anything about. But people seem to have extremely short memories when it's their turn to make the cracks. It's an unfortunate situation when people have to cope with being harassed for bearing a certain name, for acting a certain way, or simply for being themselves. 
Unfortunately, it happens. By now we're all so addicted to cutting each other up we'd prob­ably feel lost if we didn't do it. Standing at my pulpit and demanding that we all cease to be so callous is unrealistic. But we can at least be sensitive enough to stop and feel guilty every once in awhile. And take greater pains to ensure that the John Denver clones don't hear us when we succumb to the urge to begin crooning "You fill up my senses ... "

Cancellation stamp for National Champs 

By RON SEVERINO 
News Staff 
The U.S. Postal Service headquarters in Washington, 
D.C. has given the South Bend post office permission to issue a green pictorial cancellation stamp in honor of the Univer­sity of Notre Dame football team's 1988 National Champi­flnship season. 
The cancellations will only be 
available Friday, March 17, be­
tween 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. at 
Fighting Irish Station at the 
Century Center in South Bend, 
according to Paul Sniadecki, 
director of marketing at the 
South Bend post office. 
The only requirement for pa­
lAMERICAN j 
trons who want a cancellation will be that they bring a stamped envelope or postcard ready to be cancelled, said Sniadecki. 
A stamp is usually cancelled by affixing three black lines over it, said Sniadecki. This commemorative cancellation, however, will be green with the design of the Notre Dame leprechaun and a football, and the words, "Notre Dame 1988 National Champions." 
Sniadecki said those people not able to attend Friday's can­cellation hours can receive cancellations by sending stamped envelopes or postcards to the South Bend post office. These will be can­celled provided that the patron include a self -addressed, stamped envelope. The re­quests must be postmarked no later than March 17. 
Irish football fans can also obtain a commemorative postcard with the team picture on the front with the scores of the 1988 football season and Knute Rockne stamp cancelled with the green pictorial on the back, said Sniadecki. The cards, also available in the Century Center, will cost $1 and proceeds will benefit the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph County scholarship fund.

J-Council chooses new coordinator for 1989-90 
By JOHN ZALLER 
News Staff 
Vincent Sanchez, a sopho­more in Keenan, was elected the new Judicial Council Coord­inator at a meeting Wednesday night. 
"I'm looking forward to a real productive year and get­ting a lot of people motivated," Sanchez said shortly after his election. 
Sanchez said, "The biggest problem with the council right now is that not too many people know who we are. We've made alot of progress this year and I hope more people get inter­ested in order for the Judicial Council to become a more ac­tive body within the framework of the University." 
Sanchez pointed out that there are problems within the council, attendance being a large one, but he notM that they are closer to a better rap­port with the administration than last year. 
"Student Mfairs is really willing to listen to us,'' Sanchez said. He hopes that soon more responsibility will be given to the students. Sanchez's term is for the 1989-90 academic year.

McFarlane testifies that Reagan approved secret aid to Contras 

Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-President Reagan in 1985 not only ap­proved a secret pact to give Honduras more than $110 mil­lion for helping the Nicaraguan Contras but he also telephoned Honduras' president when the Honduran military delayed an ammunition shipment to the rebels, the Oliver North jury was told Wednesday. 
Reagan made a note of his call to Roberto Suazo that said the Honduran "will call his mil­itary commander to tell him to deliver the ammunition," former national security ad­viser Robert McFarlane tes­tified at the Oliver North trial. The ammunition then got to the guerrillas. 
Under questioning by defense lawyers, McFarlane detailed how Reagan initialed a plan in mid-February 1985 that resulted in Honduras get­ting speeded-up deliveries of rifles, ammunition and mac­hines. 
It was a "quid pro quo" ar­rangement that Reagan was advised would "provide incen­tives" to the Hondurans for hel­ping out. 
"You're going to give them tens of millions of dollars to 
cooperate?"  North  lawyer  
Brendan Sullivan  asked  
McFarlane.  

"Yes," the witness said. 
"There is nothing dirty about quid pro quo, is there?" 
"No." 
Later, reading from a previ­ously secret memo, Sullivan referred to "$75 million in eco­nomic assistance." He also referred to $35 million in ex­pedited military aid. 
The matter was so sensitive, McFarlane acknowledged un­der questioning, that the ar­rangement was discussed ver­bally by the U.S. ambassador in Honduras with Suazo and was not given to him in writing. 
North's lawyers say the Reagan administration had a policy of hiding such arrange­ments with other countries to support the Contras .

Bayh named as defendant in teen jail cell death suit 
Associated Press 
NEW ALBANY, Ind.-Gov. Evan Bayh was among 32 defendants named Wednesday in a $17.2 million federal law­suit stemming from the death of a Seymour, Ind. teen-ager in a police holding cell. 
Jonathon Reese Mitchell, 17, died of hanging in a holding cell at the Seymour police 

headquarters a few hours after 
being arrested Feb. 4 at a local 
arcade. 
The suit seeks an injunction 
preventing the city of Seymour 
and Jackson County from 
housing juveniles in jail until 
the conclusion of the lawsuit. It 
also asks the court to require 
the city and county to rectify 
what are referred to as uncon­
stitutional conditions at the 
jail, such as jailing juveniles 
with adult offenders. 
The suit also alleges Mitchell 
was arrested for public in­toxication and resisting arrest without probable cause and ~ that the arresting Seymour police officer used unnecessary 
force. 
The suit was filed in U.S. Dis­
trict Court in New Albany by 
Jeffersonville attorneys Larry 
Wilder and David Mosley.

O'Meara calls for University to seek international prominence 
By KERRY SCANLON 
News Staff 
The St. Edward's Hall Forum featured Provost Timothy O'Meara respond­ing to the question "Should Notre Dame become the Princeton or the Harvard of the Midwest?" 
According to O'Meara, Notre Dame should not be viewed as a school of the midwest, or a Harvard or Princeton, but as a school known on the international level. 
According to O'Meara, during the first half of this century the University con­centrated on developing a good undergraduate pro­gram as well as attracting excellent students. The last half of this century there has been an increased focus in teaching and research, said O'Meara. O'Meara said that research is very important, because " .. .it is necessary to think beyond frontiers and influ­ence the society around you and the Church." 
According to O'Meara, in order to become a highly respected university, the' University must become stronger in the life of the mind and in the exchange of ideas. 
O'Meara also noted that Notre Dame must continue to emphasize Catholic values and to exchange ideas so thinking can grow. "Being distinctive will be what brings us forward and being a Catholic University will make that happen," he said. O'Meara said that this distinctiveness would be necessary to expand the mind and the thinking of the Church. 
The University and its stu­dents should increase their dimensions in international interests, according to O'Meara. This is necessary to provide an expanded in­terest and awareness of dif­ferent cultures. 
University President Fa­ther Edward Malloy and O'Meara have been actively involved with a planning board for a future university in Australia that will be modeled after Notre Dame, said O'Meara. 
O'Meara said he would also like to see an increase in the size of the MBA pro­gram and the graduate pro­gram as a whole, while keeping the undergraduate program at the same level. 
Terrorist claims responsibility for planting a· bomb in the U.S. Vincennes skipper's van 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO-A caller with a Middle Eastern accent told a radio station Wednesday that a group called Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was re­sponsible for the bombing of a van driven by the wife of the USS Vincennes' skipper.

newsroom Wednesday mor­ning. The caller claimed to be a member of the group, which also claimed responsibility for the crash of a Pan Am jetliner last year at Lockerbie, Scot­land. 
Station officials said the call was immediately reported to the FBI. 
According to KNX, the caller said the group threatened to carry out additional attacks against Vincennes skipper Capt. Will Rogers and his fam­ily. The caller also said the bombing was linked directly to last year's downing of an Iranian airliner by the Vin­cennes. 
Fred Reagan, an FBI spokes­man in Los Angeles, confirmed, that the bureau is investigating the call. 
"We're looking into it," Reagan said. He declined to elaborate. 
Guardians of the Islamic Revolution is an Islamic group that made persistent claims to international news organiza­tions that it was responsible for the crash of Pan Am Flight 107· last Dec. 21.

Gorbachev works to stop Soviet food shortages 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW-President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev called on the Communist Party Wednesday to take urgent steps to ease chronic food shortages--the So­viet Union's "biggest wound" --but he indicated the problem would exist for years. 
The party's policy-making Central Committee began a two-day meeting largely devoted to agricultural reform, including a search for ways to increase the food supply and improve traditionally dreary rural life. 
The 58-year-old Kremlin leader, himself the son of a southern Russian peasant, said conditions in some regions of the countryside were at a "critical level," with mass migration of their population to cities. 
Productivity on Soviet farms is so low, he said, the Soviet Union still must go abroad to buy "large quantites of grain, meat, fruits, vegetables, sugar, vegetable oil and some other staples" to meet domes­tic demand. 
Gorbachev, once the party's overseer for agriculture, called for "an agrarian policy that will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the land, and dependably solve the food problem." 
"Further delay in this matter 2,250 representatives in the new Congress of People's Deputies. 
Despite the publicity touting this campaign as the Soviet Union's first multicandidate election, the Communist Party chose to nominate just 100 people for its 100 seats. Party members had suggested more than 31,000 names. 
The deputies elected by the party in a secret ballot include most members of the 12-man ruling Politburo, 26 workers and seven collective farmers, the official Tass news agency reported. 
The food problem is likely to produce far more discussion at the Central Committee plenum, since the party's con­servative agriculture chief, YegorK. Ligachev, apparently disagrees with Gorbachev on a solution. 
In recent appearances, Ligachev has skipped lightly over Gorbachev's plan to lease state-owned fields to farmers, making them "masters of the land" and providing an incen­tive to produce more. 
Instead, Ligachev has em­

of the policies," Agee said of publishing the names. 
Agee dispelled accusations that he endangered lives by publishing the names as "repeated attempts by the CIA to discredit me." 
Agee lived as a virtual out­cast after he published "Inside the Company." He was the ob­ject of media scorn as well as CIA surveillance, he said. 
"George Will called me a 'soiled bit of flotsam from the 60's' and (then-director of the CIA George) Bush tried to have me imprisoned in the 70's," he said. 
Agee's lastest book, "On the 
Run" is his memoir of the 
years following the publishing 
of "Inside the Company." 
After the lecture, Agee said 
he waited 12 years before 
leaving the CIA "partly be­
cause I came to this Univer· 
sity." 
"Clinical Medic;al Ethics: A Review of the First Decade" 
MARK SIEGLER, M.D., F.A.C.P. 
Director, Center for Clinical Medical Ethics University of Chicago -Pritzker School of Medicine 
Auditorium Center for Continuing Education Friday, March 17, 1989 4:15-5:30 p.m. 
Mark Siegler, M.D., F.A.C.P., is professor of medicine, the University of Chicago. Dr. Siegler, director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago-Pritzker School of Medicine and fellow of the Hastings Center, has written numerous books and articles on ethical issues and serves as a consultant on ethical issues to the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, and on occasion to the National Institute of Health. 
the traditional system that has left consumers standing in line for meat and vegetables. 
Tass, reporting on the first day of the plenum, said Gor­bachev called the country's continued food shortages, which necessitate the rationing of meat, sugar and other staples in many regions, "our society's biggest wound." 
Tass did not immediately provide a detailed account of Gorbachev's remarks on the new measures being con­templated in agriculture, but its initial report indicated the Kremlin leader was resigned to ongoing food shortages in the next several years. 
No one has proposed allowing farmers to own outright the land they till, or the breakup of the giant collective and state farms that have been the back­bone of Soviet agriculture since the days of Stalin. 
Gorbachev told the Central Committee collective and state farms have "huge poten­tialities" that can be exploited with the right management techniques. 
"Here at Notre Dame, country sits next to God in the motto. When I graduated, I was blindly patriotic, a conform­ist." 
''There is a schizophrenia here," he added. "Notre Dame has an Institute for Peace Studies, yet they give an honorary degree to a President 
who  is  in  charge  of  death  
squads  in  El  Salvador,"  he  
said.  

"I came out of this Univer­sity with no political experi­ence. We didn't have speakers like me here in my time. The speakers then were very patriotic, as was the Catholic teaching I grew up on," Agee said. 
Agee urged students to press University officials to prevent the CIA from recruiting at Notre Dame. 
"You may think that there is nothing you can do, but active opposition to the CIA's crimes can be successful," he said.

Among the measures en­dorsed by Gorbachev was an "extensive transition to leasing," or allowing work col­lectives and individuals to work state-owned farmland in exchange for a fee. He also said "more flexible prices" for crops purchased by the state would go into effect Jan.1, 1990.

Apple Commission· to spend $ 1.7 million on advertising 

Associated Press 
YAKIMA, Wash.-The Wash­ington Apple Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to spend nearly $1.7 million for advertising to reassure consu­mers that apples are safe, despite nationwide concerns over Alar use. 
The commission, which represents growers of the na­tion's largest apple crop, voted to take $1 million in emergency funds and borrow the rest from banks to purchase advertising in major markets around the country. 
Concerns over the suspected carcinogen showed little sign of abating as Eddie Albert and other Hollywood entertainers held a news conference to urge mothers to demand that their grocers carry chemical-free warned the apple commission to be careful about the content of its advertising. 
"We assume they are not going to be impugning our in­tegrity," said Paul Allen, a spokesman for the non-profit Washington, D.C.-based environmental . group. "That would be a great mistake on their part." 
The goal of the NRDC report is not to hurt farmers, but to change the policies of the U.S. environmental Protection Agency and make it easier to ban certain chemicals, Allen said. 
Apple commission spokes­woman Vicky Scharlau said the advertising, to begin later this month, will seek only to reas­sure consumers that apples are safe and that the present sys­tem regulating chemicals is ef­fective. 
growers at the commission meeting. 
The NRDC report, released in late February, contends that eating Alar-treated apples in­creases the cancer risk in children. The report has been attacked as alarmist by the federal Environmental Protec­tion Agency and the findings have been disputed by some scientists and the apple indus­try. 
But public fears have led school districts across the country, including those in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, to ban apples and ap­ple products from cafeterias. 
Alar is the marketing name for daminozide, which is manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co. The industry con­tends only about 5 percent of the crop is sprayed with the growth regulator, which keeps

Blatant injustices in Northern Ireland 
Having grown up in Belfast, Northern Ireland most of my life, and having ex­perienced first-hand what it is like to live in a country that is a garrison for a foreign army, I ask you, the Irish­American community here at Notre Dame--that before you go out to celebrate your Irish heritage, before you talk about the "Luck of the Irish" and sing "Irish Eyes are Smiling," stop for just a few minutes to reflect upon the situation in Northern Ireland, for there, many Irish eyes are not smiling. 
What is occurring in Northern Ireland is an issue of grave human, le­gal and civil rights violations. However, to discuss and to voice dis­content about the injustice occurring on a daily basis in Northern Ireland has never been a popular "cause" in America. 
Maura O'Siochain 
guest column 
It is "popular" for Americans to protest loudly against injustices in other countries: Nicaragua, South Africa, and now finally Palestine; However, the estimated 42 million Americans of Irish descent remain silent about the injustices occurring in their ancestoral homeland. This left me bewildered for years until I began to analyze carefully the force behind the silence. 
Mter questioning Irish-Americans about this apathy, I often received answers such as, "It's too compl­icated;" or, "Oh, didn't the Civil Rights movements make you all pretty well off?" or, "I don't support violence." 
Mter more answers such as these, I slowly became aware of the grevious sham that has occurred in the States. Irish-Americans have swallowed and digested exactly what the British gov­ernment has fed them. This being the dreadful notion that if you vociferously condemn British injustices in the North of Ireland, you are simultaneously in­dicating your support for the Irish Re­publican Army. To speak up about your abhorrence of British injustices in the North of Ireland, in no shape or form means you are supporting violence, for you may very well also abhor violence. 
An Irish-American who lobbies for the MacBride Principles for Fair Em­ployment, (if you are a Catholic in Nor­thern Ireland you are almost three­times more likely to be unemployed than a Protestant) or lobbies for a world-wide end to the use of lethal plas­tic bullets, or the strip-searching of wo­men prisoners, is in no way supporting violence, as the British government has so skillfully led you to believe. You are merely advocating justice and human rights. 
Many people whom I speak with talk about the great progress of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland. In reality, over these last 20 years of so much suffering and so much sacrifice little has changed for the Catholic in Northern Ireland, and many things have worsened and continue to worsen for us. Catholics are provided with better housing and we do have more opportunity to obtain higher edu­cation; most importantly though we have re-developed a sense of pride and dignity that had been lost before the Civil Rights Movement. 
However, in the last 20 years we have lost just about every right to which any other citizen living in the "free world" is entitled. We have lost our right to demonstrate and to assemble without police approval, we have lost the right to a trial by jury, Nationalists have lost 
the right to the airwaves and television; 
most recently we have lost the right to 
remain silent during judicial 
procedures--any silence may be inter­
preted as an automatic admittance of 
guilt. In other words we are simultane­
ously not allowed to speak and not al­
lowed to remain silent. 
From a very early age growing up as a Catholic in Northern ireland, one quickly realizes that as long as your country remains divided and occupied, nothing will change. You will always and forever be treated as a second­class citizen in you own country. 
What does it mean to be a second­class citizen? Well it begins with the fact that an army that has invaded and plundered your country over 800 years ago, continues to march upon your streets. Spend one day in West Belfast or Derry City and you will quickly realize that the British presence in Nor­thern Ireland is not of a "neutral" or "peace-keeping" nature as the British government has skillfully manipulated most Americans into believing. The sol­diers' centuries-old hatred for the Irish is still quite evident. 
But the British Army doesn't have to carry out the burden of occupation and repression of the population all by it­self. It has the helping hand of the police force--the Royal Ulster Constabulary. This police force is the same police force that was responsible for the now infamous Burntollet Bridge incident in Derry, 1969. The RUC is now allegedly reformed and less sectarian (although its membership is still 91 percent Prot­estant) just like the British Army-­neutral. 
However, it quickly becomes evident that the RUC is no more neutral today than it was in Derry, 1969, for they have no reason to be. With the complete sup­port and collusion of the British gov­ernment and army, the RUC realizes they have "carte blanche" to do unto the Nationalist population whatever they choose. This includes carrying out a "shoot-to~kill" policy upon nationalists, vicious raids and van­dalism of their homes, forcibly strip searching and torturing detainees during interrogation sessions. 
Fortunately the British and RUC vi­olations haven't gone by without world­wide condemnations from human rights and legal organizations. However, Americans do not hear about them. Just about every leading nation in the world--the United States, France, Belgium, Sweden, etc.--has questioned British abuses in Northern Ireland, including this month the Arch­bishop of Canterbury. Americans don't hear of the numerous Amnesty Inter­national reports dealing with British human and legal rights violations, the fact that Britain has just been banished from the European Committee on Human Rights for their own human rights violations in Northern Ireland or the fact that in February alone the British government has been once again condemned in a report on turture by the U.N. commission on Human Rights in Geneva; and in a U.S. State Department study. Both reports deal with "the level of assault and other im­proper practices" inflicted upon detainees in British custody. 
If the Archbishop of Canterbury can condemn British injustices in the Nor­thern Ireland legal system, then cer­tainly you as Irish-Americans should be ready to mobilize and speak out for the people in Northern Ireland who are forced to live under a system of cop­stant oppression and injustice. 
It is obvious that a United Irish­American outcry and condemnation of the human, legal, and civil rights vio­lations occurring in Northern Ireland presents a grave danger to the nature and stability of British rule in Northern Ireland. Why else are so many British resources poured into America to cover up the grim realities of life for Catholics in Northern Ireland. Thus far their ef­fort has succeeded completely: they are the victory--justice and truth are the losers. 
Almost all 42 million of you Irish­Americans are silent. Isn't it time for a change?

A curious look at American affairs 
Thomas Daugherty's article, "America Under Scrutiny," in the February issue of Common· Sense enthralled me and prompted many questions in my own mind: 
Andrea Burman 

guest column 
Who runs America? The White House? Wall Street? The Senate? Is there such a thing as balance of powers? Will John Tower drink again? Does Ted Bundy's death make the world a better, happier place to be? What did it prove? Is the death penalty the cure-all for the crime problem? Will Manson ever get paroled? 
Can one safely say that one person is more human than another? Does being ex-utero make one more deserving of human rights than one in utero? ·can one be pro-abortion and anti-war with­out being a hypocrite? Can one be anti­abortion and pro-war without being a lJ.ypocrite? When does life begin? Is the fetus a human being? If not, what is it? 
A tadpole? A plant? 

Does anarchy necessarily entail chaos? Does it entail a new govern­ment? Do humans need to be governed? Is originality a thing of the past? Why does America hate its children? Why are high schools like zoos? Does anybody really care? Why are Ameri­can children so ignorant? Why are they not challenged? 
Where's my MTV? Where's the beef? What really killed Lord Byron? When will the insanity of war stop? Is war glorious or glorified? Who is our enemy? Is Khomeini dead yet? What is sex education? What is safe sex? Is sex dangerous? Do we really care? 
Are humans only out for themselves? Could Donald Trump lend me ten bucks? Are Americans voyeurs? Are we really free? Does technology rule our lives? Can we improve on Maxi­mum Strength Anacin? What is a "recovering Catholic?" Is he a sick Catholic or sick of being Catholic? 
Is homosexuality a choice? A realiza­tion? What's in style? Is saving baby seals more important than saving baby humans? Why are humans so con­temptuous of each other? Why are we so fickle? Is pregnancy ever con­venient? Will it snow on Graduation Day? What is Velveeta? 
Is greed good? Can eternity be im­agined? Can you live with yourself that long? Where has activism gone? Why is every one wearing bomber jackets around here? Must we always follow the leader? Why does history repeat it­self? Are humans that predictable? Do dogs have an afterlife? Is communism evil? Is capitalism evil? Do you know the way to San Jose? 
Should CIA stand for Criminally In­sane Androids? Is there such a thing as silence? Will there be a sequel to "War and Remembrance"? Is there any excuse for Jackie Collins? What's wrong with being a Catholic? Is there such a thing as a liberal Republican? 
Why do people stare at road acci­dents? Is there a doctor in the house? Why are people willing to drive for miles to work for money to drive for miles to work for money to drive for miles? Are there any hermits left? Does anybody care? Is anybody out there?

Co-captain Fredrick leads Irish by example 
Junior guard tries to return to lineup after ankle injury 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
Joe Fredrick, to be sure, is one of the more confident indi­viduals you're likely to come upon. 
Some call him overconfident, even cocky. 
But when you are a junior, suddenly thrust into the na­tional limelight, called upon to co-captain a team with no seniors after starting only half of the previous season under David Rivers' shadow, confi­dence becomes a prerequisite. 
Fredrick absolutely oozes the stuff. 
On an ankle injury that kept him out of the DePaul game and possibly the Vanderbilt game Friday night: "There's no way I want to miss the op~ portunity to play in the NCAA's this year, especially after how horrible I played (in) last year('s tournament). I was on crutches Monday, taking jump shots and free throws (Tuesday), and I may run some (Wednesday). Believe me, if there's any way I can play, I will. I'm a day ahead of schedule, and our game's not until late Friday, so that will help." 
On a possible second round matchup with Georgetown in the NCAA tournament: "Not that I'm looking past Vander­bilt, but I can't wait to play Georgetown. I really, really want to face Georgetown's defense and have (Hoya star guard) Charles Smith guard me. That's where you find out how good you really are." 
On the difference between this year and last: "I think last year I took some people by surprise, like when we played at Duke (a '70-61 loss in which Fredrick scored a then-career high 23 points). But everyone was out to stop David (Rivers). This year, I know that everyone is out to stop me. That's the kind of thing that drives me." 
But after attempting only 26 field goals in his freshman year, Fredrick had a choice-­change his attitude or drive himself crazy. 
"I always felt I could play," said the Cincinnati native, who led the Irish during the regular season with a 16.6 points per game average. "But you can only believe in yourself for so long. Freshman year it was ba­sically just sit there, sit there, sit there. 
"But after a while I just figured that playing against Rivers in practice every day would eventually have to im­prove my own game enough so that some day I'd get my chance." 
Fredrick gives the Los An­geles Lakers rookie much of the credit for his success, not only on the basketball court but in the interview room and beyond the sports sphere. 
"My opportunity to practice and play against David during my freshman and sophomore years was the biggest asset I could have asked for," said Fredrick who, along with Jamere Jackson, were Notre Dame's first junior co-captains since Tim Kempton and Jim Dolan in 1984-85. 
"I always watched the way he did everything. At inter­views he spread the praise around, in practice there was never a day where he sluffed off, when he got hurt he rehabilitated faster than everyone expected, he always got the proper rest before games, always ate breakfast to start the day... Coach (Digger) Phelps was right when he called him one in a million." 
Co-captain status did not severely alter Fredrick's relationships with teammates, another tactic he picked up from his predecessor, Rivers. 
"David led by example," said Fredrick, "and that's the way Jamere and I try to do it, 
J.J. even more than I. We don't feel the need to get all rah-rah with the guys on the team. Every now and then we'll get on somebody we feel could do a little more, but we're close­knit, and the team understands that yelling and screaming just isn't the way we are." 
It's been an up and down year for both Fredrick and the Irish, and certain games during the

"Personally, going to Dayton. and finally playing well in front of my neighbors and relatives (20 points and several key bas­kets) was my high point," said Fredrick, who scored in double figures in 23 of his 27 games this season. "As a team, al­though we didn't realize it at the time, I think beating In­diana was probably our high­light. It was also a lot of fun for me to play against Jay Ed­wards. He's a heck of a player.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.--In each of the past two seasons, the Notre Dame basketball team has lost to a Vanderbilt squad led by 7-foot center Will Perdue. 
The ninth-seeded Irish won't have to worry about Perdue, now with the NBA's Chicago Bulls, when they face Vandy again Friday night in the first round of the NCAA tourna­ment's East Regional. 
Instead, the eighth-seeded Commodores look to a guard who makes a practice of hitting gamewinning shots from the most improbable places and a coach whose career will end upon Vanderbilt's next loss. 
ESPN will televise the game nationally and WSBT-TV ( Channel22) locally, with tipoff set for 9:37 p.m. at the Provi­dence Civic Center. The winner will face the survivor of Friday's Georgetown­Princeton contest Sunday. 
"They're a very, very good basketball team that obviously we won't take lightly, espe­cially since they beat YS the last two times we've played," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said of his team's first­round opponent. "If that's not enough to get us ready to play, then we'll have our hands full." 
About Vanderbilt 

Vanderbilt (19-13) lost five of its first seven games this season while playing the likes

of Michigan, Louisville and North Carolina. The Com­modores rebounded to win 15 of their next 20 before a late­season slump and finished tied for second in the Southeastern Conference. 
"Their record's deceiving," said Phelps. "They played a lot of powerhouses early in the year and they came on strong in conference play." 
Last-second shots by Barry Goheen have decided no less than three of Vanderbilt's vic­tories this season. The 6-3 senior guard sunk a three­pointer from halfcourt at the buzzer to beat Louisville, made three-pointers at the end of the half and game (one on a shot well behind halfcourt) in a one­point win over Georgia and also hit a gamewinner against Mis­sissippi. 
Buzzerbeating shots are nothing new to the Calvert City, Ky., resident. Goheen has six gamewinning shots in his Van­derbilt career and nailed two three-pointers in the final five seconds to send the Pitt game into overtime in last season's NCAA tournament. Vandy eventually won that game 80-74 to reach the Sweet Sixteen. 
"He just tnakes a lot of things happen for them," said Phelps. "You can't put Vanderbilt away; you have to be con­cerned even up to the last­second shot because they're so good shooting threes." 
Barry Booker and Derrick Wilcox also have had success with the three-point shot.

This season's SEC Coach of the Year, Newton earned his SOOth career victory this season. 
Irish Extra 
earned his nickname of "The 
Long Ranger" by setting SEC 
career records for three-point 
shots made (245) and at­
tempted (535). He is shooting 
86-of-191 from beyond the stripe 
this season and averages 14.6 
points per game. 
Wilcox, a 5-11 point guard, 
has shot 33-of-91 from three­
point range in averaging 8.5 
points per game. The junior 
also recorded 169 assists to 
break Vanderbilt's single­
season record. 
"They have a lot of confi­dence shooting the threes," said Phelps. "Booker does very well in getting open to shoot, .and so does Wilcox, who's very deceptive shooting the threes." 
Vandy's frontline players in­clude 6-9 senior center Frank Kornet and 6-8 junior forward Eric Reid. Kornet moved from power forward this season and leads the Commodores with 7.2 rebounds and 16.8 points per game this season, including an 
18.7 scoring average over the last 15 games. 
Reid also scores in double fig­ures with 10.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game. Steve Grant, Charles Mayes, Todd Milholland and Morgan Wheat add depth up front. 
With Perdue on the bench with foul trouble in last season's game at Notre Dame, Kornet's 17 points led the Com­modores to a 75-66 victory. Vandy also defeated Notre Dame 60-56 two years ago at Nashville, Tenn. 
C.M. Newton has coached Vanderbilt for the last eight years and has led the team to consecutive NCAA tournament appearances for the first time in school history. Newton coached for 12 years each at Transylvania and Alabama before coming to Vanderbilt. "C.M. Newton is one of the class guys in the business," said Phelps. "He's nothing but a gentleman and a close friend of mine." Newton's 509-374 career record ranks him 11th among active coaches in career wins, and he was named SEC Coach of the Year for the sixth time this year. He will leave Vandy at the end of the season to return to his alma mater and take care of a beleagured Ken­
tucky program as athletic director. 
About Notre Dame 

Phelps' biggest concern about his team heading into the tournament is the condition of guard Joe Fredrick. The junior co-captain sprained his ankle last Friday and missed Satur­day's 73-70 loss at DePaul. 
"It's obvious that we need Joe Fredrick healthy," said

NCAA Tournament Edition, March 16, 1989 Irish Extra page 3 
Robinson center of Notre Dame's game 
By FRANK PASTOR Assistant Sports Editor 
Last season Keith Robinson 
made his debut on the Notre 
Dame basketball team. 
Just one year later, he is a leader. 
Such is the state of this 
season's seniorless Irish 
squad, and such has been the 
collegiate career of Robinson, 
who has made his share of com­
ebacks in the past two years. 
After sitting out his freshman season under Proposition 48, the 6-9 center from Buffalo, N.Y., played in all 29 games for the Irish his sophomore year and entered this season as Notre Dame's top returning scorer and rebounder. 
Robinson has played a vital role for the Irish this season after returning from a broken foot injury suffered in a pickup basketball game over the sum­mer. He has had to bolster Notre Dame's inside game while simultaneously helping the freshmen frontline players adjust to the collegiate style of play. 
"I've t(lken on a different leadership role this season," said Robinson. "I think I'm ·more of a role player for the freshman group. Coach (Digger) Phelps wanted me to be consistent with my game this year and also help out the 
younger guys. 
"Upperclassmen like Scott 
Paddock and myself on the 
frontline had to take our time 
with them and let them learn 
the system. I think they caught 
on really well." 
Well enough, in fact, that 
freshmen LaPhonso Ellis and 
Keith Tower have been able to 
step in and give the Irish lineup 
enough depth to compete in the 
brutal and often'unpredictable 
NCAA tournament, which 
begins Friday night against 
Vanderbilt for the 20-8 Irish. 
Robinson considers that expe­
rience gained during the 
freshman year invaluable. 
"Freshman year is basically 
a learning year, and I think I 
lost that," said Robinson.

"Everybody else got that year ahead of me to establish them­selves. I was kind of left out, and I had to prove t:nyself last year. It was a lot of hard work as far as trying to catch up, but I think I proved myself last season." 
Much has been made of Propositon 48 and its effects on collegiate athletes such as Tony Rice and Michigan's Terry Mills. The controversial Proposal 42 was advanced this year as an alternative to Proposition 48. controversy. Robinson believes he has per­sonally benefitted from Proposition 48 but like his coa­ch, stands opposed to the new proposal. 
"Proposition 48 was fine," said Robinson, "but I just don't think Proposal 42 is right for a student coming out of high school. The rule doesn't even give students a chance to go to college at all if they don't make a certain grade point average or score on the SAT or ACT. 
"I think these students should be given a chance to go to the school they desire. I think they should be allowed to es­tablish themselves academi­cally first and then get ready to play sophomore year." 
Fortunately for Robinson and the Irish, he was able to return to the team following a one-year absence and averaged 9.6 points and 7.1 rebounds per game in his soph­omore campaign. Now a junior, he has led Notre Dame to a fifth consecutive NCAA 
tournament appearance, 
where the Irish face Vanderbilt 
in the first round. 
" I think we match up pretty well," said Robinson. "They have some good rebounders and some great three-point shooters. I think we're a faster-paced team than they are. It's going to be a very physical game inside, and each team is going to have to play good defense and contain people. 
"I think if we establish the 
game from the start, getting in 
the rhythm and scoring, we'll 
be fine. We just have to match

his time with me. I came on pretty strong in the Kentucky game considering the limited amount of time I played. I started to play with a lot more confidence and it started to show each game." 
Robinson finished with a 9.5 rebounding average, the best for an Irish player in 12 years. That mark paced a Notre Dame team which finished second nationally in rebound margin at plus-9. 
He also averaged 12.7 points per game and scored in double figures on 21 occasions, includ­ing 17 of the last 22 games.

P.O. Box Q 

GSU misrepresents student concerns 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the View­point article appearing in the Feb. 28 issue of the Observer written by Victor Krebs, GSU President. As one of the two Chemistry Department represen­tatives attending the Graduate Student Council meeting of Feb. 14, I feel that some of Mr. Krebs' arguments are vague and misleading. In that column he implies that the voting representa­tives were duly notified of the impor­tant issues to be voted upon through the "customary GSU memorandum." While we did receive this memo con­taining the reminder to attend and an "agenda" two days prior to the meeting, the only hint therein that a 250% officer salary increase and a 25% Student Activities fee increases would be tabled was the seemingly harmless announcement under the heading of Vice President's Report: "budget pro­posal." 
Without the essential details of these proposals being made available to the representatives prior to the meeting in which they were voted on, there was no opportunity for the Council to act in a representative capacity. According to the Preamble of the GSU constitution, the primary purpose of the GSU is to represent the graduate student body. This obviously did not occur in the meeting of Feb. 14. Ironically, the ex­ecutive board is proposing changes to this constitution which would eliminate the term "representative" from the Preamble. In light of their actions, the changes would be appropriate. 
Mr. Krebs argues that representa­tives were given a week to inform their constituencies prior to any public state­ment by the Council, implying that proper representation did occur. However, there is a huge difference be­tween notifying one's constituents of an upcoming issue and notifying them of changes which were approved without their consent. The executive board is ultimately responsible for the inability of the Council to represent the graduate students. 
At the Feb. 14 meeting, it was stressed by Mr. Krebs that an immedi­ate vote on the fee and salary increases was necessary as these issues would have impact on the upcoming elections. I allege that the board knew that the urgency was in fact illusory. After the increases were already approved, it was requested by the executive board and approved by the Council that a spe­cial meeting would be held on Feb. 21 to vote on constitutional changes that would affect these very same elections. Why couldn't the fee-'salary increases be voted upon at the Feb. 21 meeting as well? Perhaps the board was afraid that the Council might not pass the in­creases if the graduate student body knew what was happening, as a recent petition would seem to indicate. 
Furthermore, I am well aware that the present officers do not stand to per­sonally benefit (at least financially) from the resulting salary increases, and I do not believe anybody (including 
the author(s) of a recent petition) is intentionally implying they would. This is not the issue. The issue the graduate students should consider is simply stated: Who should be making these decisions which affect us all? It is ob­vious where the GSU president, Mr. Krebs, stands: "The decisions taken by the council were based on the judge­ment shared by the executive board that they were in the best interests of the graduate student body." This type of statement is very familiar to us all; only the source is surprising. As an adult, I find this attitude distasteful and insulting. The graduate student body is the best judge of what is in its own best interests, and for the president of a sup­posedly representative organization to contend otherwise is a disgrace. How can the University take graduate stu­dents seriously if their own government treats them in a condescending and paternalistic way? Since this is ap­parently the prevailing attitude of the present officers, I am at least consoled by the fact thay they do not seek re­
election. 

Kenneth Dowling Chemistry department rep. to the GSC March 1, 1989 
GSU officers deserve raise 
Dear Editor: 

The Feb. 24 Observer reported ape­tition presented by Chris Kennedy to Fr. Malloy, protesting a recent Graduate Student Union decision to raise GSU officers stipend to $1400 a year and to increase GSU activity fees. 
The Observer has already published Victor Krebs's response to Mr. Ken­nedy's accusations and we would like to express our support for Victor Krebs and the GSU representatives. What needs to be stressed, however, is the issue of pay raises for GSU officers. The current $400 a year stipend is ridiculously low. An increase to $1400 a year is only a slight improvement. The improvements in the administation of the GSU and the increase in the num­ber of Graduate Committees and GSU­sponsored events this year' are due in large part to the dedication of the cur­rent GSU officers. Their commitment is based on a desire to see the GSU mature into a serious and effective rep­resentation of Notre Dame graduate students~ The point can hardly be dis­puted given the almost complete lack of remuneration and recognition for their services. 
How can the GSU effectively repre­
sent graduate students if the officers 
must work on a voluntary basis? It's 
not simply a question of having people 
willing to work hard for the GSU; 
there's a practical question of where 
they'll get the time to do so. If GSU 
officers put in the same number of 
hours for the GSU as graduate assis­
tants do working for their departments, 
they should be paid equally. Without 
financial commitment to a well­
administered, active GSU, it will never 
represent graduate students adequate­
ly. Whose interests are served by a 
weak GSU? 

If Mr. Kennedy has a complaint about GSU procedures, why is he running to Fr. Malloy? The appropriate place to take up the issue is in the graduate stu­dent council. Any petitions should be presented to the GSU, and complaints should be resolved among graduate stu­dents. Why would anyone (and in par­ticular a former GSU officer) be inter­ested in consciously circumventing the established policies by going straight to the highest office of the University and complain there rather than at home, i.e., in the GSU? 
So Mr. Kennedy's petition (read: ac­cusation) is in fact more than a protest. It is undermining the GSU as an insti­tution. In this sense, Mr. Kennedy has caused damage to what we consider a work in progress. Moreover, his act is a slap in the face to those who dedicate a lot of time and energy to make the GSU a better organization so that we, the graduate students, can be better represented and be more actively in­volved on campus. So again, why would someone want to be so counterproduc­tive? 
Volker Frank Greg Maggetti former GS U representatives March 1, 1989 
Graduates invited to meet candidates 
Dear Editor: 
We are writing to inform graduate students that the Graduate Student Union will be holding a general meeting at 7 p.m. Monday March 20 in the Cus­hing Engineering Auditorium. During that meeting the candidates running for the 1989-90 President and Vice Presi­dent positions will explain their plans for the coming year. 
The purpose of this meeting is to pro­vide graduate students the opportunity to decide the future direction of their representative organization. All graduate students are therefore en­couraged to attend. A departmental representatives will be present at the meeting to gather votes from their respective constituencies. Elections will take place during the regular monthly Graduate Council, on March 
21. According to regular procedures, each departmental representative will cast one vote.

Iceberg Debates promote awareness 
Dear Editor: 
The Iceberg Debates represented the 
coming together of many different sec­
tions of the University community in 
pursuit of the goal of increased student 
awareness on key topics of our day. I 
would like to say thanks to all who 
helped with this project. 
I give a special mention to the con­sultant and standing committee mem­bers, the student government volun­teers, the hall presidents, the faculty judges and graduate students and the many people who worked behind the scenes. 
Congratulations to the Zahm and Stanford finalists and to all the contes­tants who have displayed in a very con­vincing manner that Notre Dame students can come together in their own forum to discuss some important social concerns. 
The student government and Center for Social Concerns sponsorship made all of this possible. I hope that through future combined efforts that this .. Iceberg will be only one of many on the Notre Dame winter landscape.

ND ticket donators receive thanks 
Dear Editor: 
Lately, I have been reading The Ob­server and wondering about our student body which has been described as a homogeneous group which holds just about every reproachable characteris­tic known to man. However, I am writing to give our students some credit--and thanks. 
I would like to thank all the students who donated their Louisville basketball or Air Force football tickets to St. Hed­wig's Outreach Center this year. Thanks to you, a group of children who normally would not have had the op­portunity, watched a game involving a team on its way to a national champi­onship and two major college basket­ball teams. Your contribution was truly appreciated by all the children. Pic­tures from both of these games are on display in Morrissey Hall's lobby. If you would like to participate in the St. Hedwig's tutoring program, contact Jeff Applewhite or Tom Veltz. Thank you again for your generosity.

Allegation on Agee found untrue

Regarding the allegation in the March 14 Observer that "for some 15 years, any mention of Phil Agee's name was prohibited in Notre Dame Maga­zine:" nonsense. 
It's not been true during the six years I've been editor. Staff members with longer tenure say it's never been true ..

"coincidental" meeting. The Kozinski's and Hardy's end up sharing a table, but the heat is too much for Tish. She storms out of the room crying; her guilt and uneasi­ness at being around Tom's wife is unbearable. Ironically, it's Maria who comforts her husband's lover in the bath­room. The irony of the situa­tions in "Cousins" is so ab­surd that it makes the movie. 
The final scene in the celebration of family, relationships, and love. 

"Cousins" is a remake of the 1976 French romantic comedy, "Cousin, Cousine," which takes an intimate look at the lives of two mis­matched couples and their families. If you enjoy comedy and romance, and you are a sucker for a happy ending, this movie is a definite "go­see."

Douglass 'threatened' by Walters, Bloom 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO--Maurice Douglass of the Chicago Bears testified Wednesday that agent Lloyd Bloom threatened to "have somebody break my legs" if Douglass stopped doing business with Bloom and Norby Walters without returning money and cars given him by the agents. 
Douglass, a defensive back, was a witness at the federal fraud and extortion trial of Bloom and Walters. The New York-based agents are accused of offering college athletes thousands of dollars to become clients and threatening them with violence when they tried to back out of the deals. 
Walters and Bloom have pleaded innocent, claiming they were cheated out of the commissions owed them when 
the athletes signed contracts  
with  professional  football  
teams.  

Douglass, who attended the University of Kentucky, said he signed a contract with Walters and Bloom and shortly after signed a contract with St. Louis agent Jim Steiner after his col­lege eligibility expired. Wal­ters and Bloom gave him money, paid for a rental car and helped him get a car of his own, he said. 
But around the time of the 1986 NFL draft, Douglass said, he told Walters and Bloom he wanted to retain only Steiner. Bloom then telephoned him, he said. 
"He (Bloom) told me that if I did not return the money and the cars that he would have somebody rough me up and I ... might not make it to the draft,'' Douglass testified. "He said he might have somebody break my legs." 
Douglass said he told his mot. her to tell police about the threat if something happened to him.

the Michigan State Tourna­ 
ment when he was a sophomore and junior, and the always  
competitive St. Louis Invita­tional when he was a junior.  
These accomplishments were  
not overlooked when he was  
voted into the tournament. Boyd, along with fellow  
seniors Jerry Durso and Chris  
Geneser, put Irish wrestling on the map four years ago.  
"Notre Dame wrestling has come an awful long way in four  
years," said Boyd. "Most of the  
credit should be given to the  
coaches." He is referring to Fran  
McCann who took the reigns  
five years ago and Rick  
Stewart who became assistant  
in 1986. Since McCann has be­come coach, Notre Dame has  
risen in both success and rankings. For the first time  
ever, the Irish were ranked in the top twenty in the final poll,  
coming in at number 18. Boyd also had nothing put  
praise for his teammates, who  
have helped him attain his Na­ 
tional Tournament goal.  
"We really appreciate the  
guys who didn't make the tour­ 
namnent," stated Boyd. "They  
gave up their Spring Break so  
they could help us practice. It  
is all a team effort at Notre  
Dame."  
Boyd has an good chance of

He has already upset the third­

season.  
"I've got an excellent chance

it comes to the Nationals."

Football renews quest for another championship 
Special to The Observer 

With Wednesday's opening of spring practice, the Notre Dame football team has begun its challenge of pursuing a na­tional title all over again. 
Even with an experienced team anchored by 16 returning starters, Irish coach Lou Holtz knows that defending last year's title will not be a simple job. 
"On paper, we should be a good team," says Holtz, "but who knows if this year's team will have the same work habits as last year's group? Who knows if the commitment will be the same? Who knows what the chemistry will be like? Those are questions that can't be answered until we get into the season. 
"We have a chance to be a better football team than last year, based on our personnel and experience. But that doesn't mean we'll have the same kind of record." 
The Irish must replace 12lost lettermen, including six starters. Offensively, Notre Dame will be missing regulars like tailback Mark Green (1,977 career rushing yards) and tackle Andy Heck (a first-team All-American in 1988). On defense, the losses include end Frank Starns (a consensus All­American), linebacker Wes

but still has plenty of experi­ence. Last year, Durso made it all the way to the quarterfinals before losing a close match to Joei Bales of Northwestern. 
Geneser, who is from Wood­ward, Iowa, has a 30-6 record this year with nine pins. He has tournament victories this year at Michigan State and at the National Catholics, where he wrestled at 177 poundS instead of his current 167 pounds. If everything goes well, Geneser looks to have his best tourna­ment ever. 
Durso, who is co-captain along with Geneser, has com· piled 127 total wins with only 27 losses, which includes 32 wins this year and 38 as a freshman. Wrestling at 134 pounds, Durso is hoping to improve and pos­sibly place. 
''The whole year comes down to this," stated Durso. "If you had to wrestle well, this is the time." 
The last entrant into the tournament is senior Pat Boyd, who is making his first-ever tourney appearance. Boyd was granted another year to wrestle because of an injury suffered junior year. Boyd (21­
5) has been ranked in the top 
... ten at 142 pounds for most of the year. Going into the Nation­als, Boyd could be ranked in the top eight, which will make his fight for the championship that much easier. 
The -NCAA Tournament is 
.. what the season boils down to for the seniors. It is now or never for Durso and Geneser, the wrestlers who made Notre Dame part of the elite. An NCAA championship would be an excellent way to finish a storybook career for two guys who have always dreamed of standing atop the winners plat­form looking down on the likes of Iowa and Arizona State. 
Pritchett (the team's top tack­ler in 1988 with 112), strong safety George Streeter and end Flash Gordon. 
The graduation losses are not huge in number, yet Holtz knows those seniors had much to do with setting the tone for 
Notre  Dame's  success  last  
year.  
"Everyone told  me we  had  

the same team coming back next year," said Holtz. "We had our first team meeting after the Fiesta Bowl in mid­January. But when we started to talk about next year, I ex­cused the graduating seniors, and some awfully good football players got up and left." 
Notre Dame returns 46 monogram winners, including nine offensive starters, seven more on defense, the top punter plus one of the top two Irish placekickers. 
Tops on the list of returnees is senior quarterback Tony Rice (70-of-138 for 1,176 yards, 8 touchdowns, 7 interceptions), who led Notre Dame in rushing last season (121 rushes for 700 yards, 9 TDs). 
Rice did not receive much preseason notice as a junior, but he will in 1989, especially after faring impressively in head-to-head matchups last fall with Miami's Steve Walsh, USC's Rodney Peete and West Virginia's Major Harris, all 1988 Heisman Trophy finalists. In the Fiesta Bowl, Rice averaged better than 30 yards per completion, threw for a career-high 213 yards and rushed for a game-high 75 yards. 

Junior Ricky Watters (30 for 71, along with team-leading 15 catches for 286, 2 TDs) is ex­pected to switch from the flanker spot he played last fall to the tailback slot he occupied as a freshman in 1987. At ful­lback, the Irish have senior An­thony Johnson (69 for 282, 5 TDs), senior Braxston Banks (31 for 129, 1 TD), who must bounce back from knee prob­lems, and sophomore Rodney Culver (30 for 195, 3 TDs). 
The receiver positions in­clude sophomore Derek Brown (12 for 150, 3 TDs) and junior Frank Jacobs (1 for 14) at tight end, senior Pat Eilers (6 for 70) at flanker and sophomore Rag­bib Ismail (12 for 331, 2 TDs) at split end. With Watters switching back to tailback, Is­mail probably would move to flanker. 
The offensive line includes four returning starters with senior Tim Grunhard and junior Tim Ryan at guard, junior Mike Heldt at center and senior Dean Brown at one tackle. Sophomore Gene McGuire will switch from cen­ter to guard, while junior Win­

ston Sandri likely will move from guard to center. Look for sophomore Mirko Jurkovic, a defensive tackle last year, to play guard in 1989. 
On defense, the Notre Dame· line returns intact in junior left tackle George Williams (44 tackles, 4.5 sacks), junior nose tackle Chris Zorich (a first­team All-American last season with 70 tackles, 3.5 sacks) and senior right tackle Jeff Aim (50 tackles, team-leading 3 inter­ceptions). 
The end spots must be rebuilt, following the losses of Starns and Gordon. The drop end slot features sophomore Arnold Ale and junior Andre Jones, each of whom started four games last year. The rush end position includes junior Scott Kowalkowski and senior John Foley, who missed all of last season with a nerve injury in his bicep.

The Irish are set at corner­back with senior Stan Smagala, junior Todd Lyght and senior D' Juan Francisco. Senior Pat Terrell is back at free safety, but junior Greg Davis is the only experienced returnee at strong safety. Sophomores Rod Smith, Shawn Davis and Rusty Setzer, all of whom played of­fense as freshmen, are possi­bilities to move to the second­ary. 
The kicking game returns junior punter Jim Sexton (38.9 average) and junior placekicker Billy Hackett (5 of 7 PATs, 3 of 4 FGs).

ANN ARBOR, Mich.--Bill Frieder's coaching career at Arizona State began earlier than he wanted when Michigan told him if he's going, go now­-before his Wolverines play in the NCAA tournament. 
"I don't want somebody from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team," Athletic Director Bo Schembechler said Wednesday. "A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan." 
No sooner had word gotten out that Frieder had accepted the basketball coaching job at Arizona State, two days before the start of the tournament, than Schembechler announced that assistant coach Steve Fis­her would lead the 24-7 and lOth-ranked Wolverines in the NCAAs. Michigan's first game is Friday in Atlanta against 21­11 Xavier. 
Arizona State had contacted Michigan to inquire about Frieder after basketball coach Steve Patterson resigned Feb. 4, Schembechler said. But he said Frieder's announcement stunned him. 

"I had no forewarning at all," he said. "We just assumed 



A

that if anything would occur, it'd be after the NCAA tourna­ment. I wouldn't have done it that way, but that's up to him." 
Frieder, who was The Asso­ciated Press Coach of the Year in 1984-85, told his players of his decision in a series of early-morning phone calls from Arizona. 
"I think I'm speaking for the rest of the team when I say we're shocked," center Loy Vaught said. "He never let on that he was leaving." 
Frieder offered to coach the Wolverines, seeded third in the Southeast Regional, through the tournament. But Schem­bechler said he telephoned Frieder and told him Fisher would run the team. 
Frieder compiled a 191-87 record--including six straight 20-victory seasons--at Mic­higan since taking charge of the team in 1980. He led the Wolverines to Big Ten titles in 1985 and 1986. 
A permanent replacement for Frieder wouldn't be named until after the NCAA cham­pionships, Schembechler said. He refused to speculate about candidates. 
New-found fame and fortune hard on Calcavecchia 
Associated Press 
PONTE VEDRA, Fla.--Mark Calcavecchia, the sensation of the early season, is having some problems with his new­found fame on the PGA tour. 
"I'm struggling with it a little bit," Calcavecchia said Wed­nesday before a final practice round for the $1.35 million Players Championship. 
The tournament, recognized as the annual championship of golf's touring pros, begins Thursday with Calcavecchia among the favorites for the $243,000 first prize. 
Calcavecchia, who won the Australian Open title late last year, leads the American tour this year with $429,112. 
He won the Los Angeles and Phoenix Opens, missed a playoff at the Bob Hope by one stroke and was third in another one. 
"I could have won four tour­naments already this year,'' he said. 
And with that success has come increased attention from press and public, a situation that is new to the man who was struggling to make ends meet as recently as four years ago. 
"It's part of the price you pay," said Curtis Strange, the 1988 U.S. open champion and Player of the Year. 
"We all strive to play well. When you do, and you win, that attracts attention. The better you play the more attention you get. 
..
"You can't separate the two." It is a problem that Calcavec­chia has to handle. 
"I'm having a little trouble with it," he said, and hinted that it could be affecting his performance. 
"At Eagle Trace (the Honda ­Classic two weeks ago), I was bombarded, people coming over to the house for two-hour interviews, the phone ringing all the time, all that stuff. .... 
"They just blew me away. I was out of it," Calcavecchia said. 
He missed the cut in that tournament and hasn't played particularly well since.

They are the leaders of the team. But what makes them even more special is their out­standing academic records. They are the GTE Academic All-Americans, selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) for being high achievers­in the game as well as the classroom.

Four ND wrestlers prepare for NCAAs 
By GREG SCHECKENBACH Sports Writer 

The time has come for the big tournament, the tourna­ment to end all tournaments, the NCAA Wrestling Tourna­ment. 
Notre Dame will send four representatives to Oklahoma City, Okla. for what promises to be the most exciting tourna­ment in years. What makes this tournament so different from past ones is that it may not be dominated by Iowa, but by a new power, Arizona State. 
The Sun Devils were vic­torious in last year's tourna­ment, ending a nine -year dynasty by Iowa. Ironically, Iowa was the runner-up in the tourney last year and is ex­pected to challenge again this year. Currently, they are the top-ranked team in the country and are very proud of it. 
"Even though most people don't win a national champion­ship in their lifetime, I got pretty used to it," stated Iowa Coach Dan Gable on winning 
It's time again for March Madness 
It's hard to believe, but it's NCAA Tournament time again. 
This is heaven for hardcore zealots cheering on perennial contenders (like Indiana and Georgetown fans), passive fol­lowers of a regional favorite (like Notre Dame fans) and sports junkies with ESPN (like me). 
And, of course, I have some views on exactly how things will transpire. If you're like me, you've been approached by

inside information could prove to be financially redeeming. 
First Round Upsets--If you go strictly according to the seeds, I think we could see quite a few big names fall early. I'll start with my Upset Special. In the Southeast Regional, No. 14 Middle Tennessee State will defeat Florida State. That's right. These are two very similar teams, more similar than people know. Chris Rainey of the Blu10 Raiders (19 ppg) is one of the most underrated guards in the country and Florida State will be looking ahead. 
Also in the Southeast, look for No. 11 South Alabama to upend No. 6 Alabama and No. 10 Iowa State to destroy No. 7 UCLA. Although I can't quite pick them to upset, watch Xavier against Michigan and Providence against Virginia. Both games will be much closer than their seeds indicate. 
While there really isn't anything glaring in the Midwest Regional, I like No. 9 Ball State (28-2, best record in Division 
l) to beat No. 8 Pittsburgh in a close one. Creighton will certainly cover the 13 and a half points Missouri is giving them, and the Florida-Colorado State game should go down to the wire, with Colorado State having the slight edge. Pat Durham of the Rams is a bonafide first round draft pick that no one has heard of. 
In the East Regional, as we all know, the Irish play Van­derbilt. Those of you who followed Peerless Prognosticators during the football season know that I wasn't afraid to pick against the Irish in a select few games. Let's say this: if Fredrick plays, Notre Dame will win by three, if he doesn't, Vandy will win by three. It's that close on paper. Both teams aren't playing especially well right now, which favors the Commodores if Fredrick isn't around to provide stretch-run leadership. 
nine consecutive national titles. 
Head Coach Fran McCann and the Irish wrestlers will try to put a dent in Gable's confi­dence. All indications are that Notre Dame has an excellent chance of cracking the top­twenty in one of the most com­petitive tournaments in college athletics. 
"We are capable of placing in the top-twenty if we concen­trate mentally," said McCann, who is still upset about the voting procedure in the recent Western Regionals where two Irish wrestlers were left out of the National Tournament. 
Representing Notre Dame will be seniors Jerry Durso, Chris Geneser, and Pat Boyd along with junior Andy Raden­baugh. All of them, except for Boyd, have prior National Tournament experience. 
Radenbaugh, who is making his second straight tourney ap­pearance, has Notre Dame's best record this year at 35-8. He needs four wins to break the Irish single season record for victories held by teammate 

Durso. Last year, Radenbaugh Radenbaugh qualified for the bowed out of the tournament in NCAA's by earning an at-large the first round and is expected bid at the Western Regionals to improve this year. where he was runner-up at 118 pounds. The loss was unex­

For Boyd, this is the first time he has had a chance to wrestle in the National Tourn­ament.

NCAA Tournament may 'revitalize' Sooners after poor performances 
Associated Press 

Billy Tubbs has a new theory. 
So what if his Oklahoma Sooners, ranked No. 1 for much of the season, stumbled through the Big Eight tourna­ment, losing in the finals to Missouri? they had nothing to gain by winning it anyway. 
"You're talking about some­thing that revitalizes everybody," said Tubbs, whose fourth-ranked Sooners begin play in the NCAA tournament Thursday. "We're playing Southern Conference, the No. 16 seed in the Southeast Regional to Oklahoma's No. 1. The game, which will be played in Nashville, Tenn., is one of 16 first-round matchups Thursday as college basket­ball's three-week champion­ship festival begins. Sixteen more will be played Friday. 
Most of Thursday's games on the surface appear one-sided. Three of the four top seeds are in action, with only second­ranked Georgetown, No. 1 in the East, off until Friday. 
Morris in another matchup of No. 1 and No. 16, this one in the West. 
On the same card at Boise, St. Mary's plays Clemson; Memphis State plays DePaul and No. 15 Nevada-Las Vegas plays Idaho, which will have the advantage of being the local favorite. 
In addition to the Oklahoma­East Tennessee game, Sout­heast games in Nashville in­clude LaSalle vs. Louisiana Tech; Virginia vs. Providence and No. 16 Florida State said Boyd. "I'm very thankful that I have been able to recover completely from them." 
This year, Boyd was, once again, injured. He sustained a knee injury half way through the season, but stated that his knee is at 100 percent for the tournament. 
"My knee hasn't bothered me at all for about a month and I don't expect it to bother me this weekend," said Boyd. 
Boyd, who hails from Mt. Pleasant, Mich., has a prep record book that is a mile long. In high school, he compiled an overall record of 168-1 includ­ing 143 consecutive victories, which is a national prep record. Also, Boyd is a member of the Amateur Sports Hall of Fame located in Johnstown, Pa.
