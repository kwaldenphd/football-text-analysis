Board of Governance (BOG) 1\lnctions Commissionnr Danielle Lerner directed pre­formatted questions to presi­dnntial and viee presidential tickets for the Hnsidenee Hall Association (HilA) and Student Divnrsity Board at "Mnet the Candidates" Thursday night in thn West Wing of the Noble Family Dining Hoom. 
.Junior Angeline Johnson and sophomore Kimberly Hodges are running for SDB president and vice president, respective­ly. Junior Amy Dardinger and sophomore Cassie Quaglia are running for HilA president and vice president, respective­ly. Both tickets are unopposed. 
The Saint Mary's Student Government Constitution says the SDB president is "respon­sible for fostering diversity of every woman on Saint Mary's campus by upholding the mis­
sion of [SOB). as well as chair­ing the [SOB] meetings and all operations and presenting regular reports to BOG. The vice president is charged with similar duties but does not report to I BOG]." 
Johnson and Hodges said they plan to continue the diversity improvements made by SDB this year at Saint Mary's. 
"I think we can further develop projects that have begun this year," Johnson 
said. 
Johnson cited the example of the Diversity Student Leadership Conference as an event that the two hope to improve and strengthen if they are elected. 
Hodges felt she and her run­ning mate's experiences this year as members of SOB would benefit their productivi­ty as president and vice presi­dent. 
Johnson and Hodges' plat­form includes plans to create a program that would invite successful Saint Mary's African-American alumnae to campus to speak to students. 
"I think diversity is impor­tant because it is an asset to any campus or organization," .Johnson said. "And I want to foster that at Saint Mary's by bringing back successful women of color to speak as examples."

Where'sthe eight ounce yogurt? 
With all the campaign promises and reforms and controversies swirling around the school, one major University problem has been blatantly overlooked. 
The yogurt. 
In the past few Eric Retter weeks, the Grab'n'Go's on campus have cut Sports Writer 
back. replacing the 8 oz. yogurt cups that had become a staple in my on-the-run lunches with a 6 oz. variety, while still registering them as two items. 
Why is this a problem? 
Cynics may say I'm upset because I love food, that, given the choice between going to a movie with Hache! McAdams or eating a free, delicious steak, I'd run red lights to get to Outback. 
Fair enough. 
But what it comes down to is a question of principle. What would happen if we had 25 percent of all aspects of our student life taken away? 
What if the University sent lum­berjacks to each dorm, armed with a chainsaw and instructed to lop off exactly 22 inches from the 88­inch twin extra-longs? 
What if, realizing that rooms did­n't have to be so big and accommo­date such luxurious sleeping arrangements, the powers-that-be moved each wall forward three feet and created storage alleys for each residence hall? 
I, for one, my legs dangling night after night from the top of my loft, would write mean things in the slowly drying concrete and walk around saying worse, the growing bags under my eyes providing me with all the justification I needed. 
In all honesty, 25 percent is a, lot. For instance, if a grown man can hit a baseball 25 percent of the time consistently, he makes mil­lions. 
Given, these examples might be a little unrealistic, but the point is, percentage-wise, we're giving up a lot. 
Maybe if weekend parietals were moved back to 9:45 p.m. for a night, everyone would realize the value of 25 pecent. 
In the end, I'm a realistic man, and I realize that not everything can go my way. Maybe the dining hall is undergoing budget prob­lems, or maybe their suppliers just aren't nice people and cut the sizes. Whatever it is, I think we could work out a solution, creating a Grab'n'Go that could make every­body happy. 
Maybe I'm just venting; maybe I'm the only person who cares. Who knows, maybe I offended someone, and if I did, I apologize. 
I get a little grouchy when my stomach's empty.

Olympic team still waiting for luggage 
MADRID -The Spanish Winter Olympic team have got off to an unfortu­nate start to the Games with several members of the 31-strong squad still waiting for their luggage to turn up after arriving in Turin Monday. 
Competitors were left without skis, snowboards and cases after their lug­gage was lost on depar­ture from the newly opened terminal at Madrid's Barajas airport, Spanish media reported on Thursday. 
"Things haven't started well for reasons' that have nothing to do with the competition," the head of the Spanish Olympic Committee Alejandro Blanco was quoted as say­ing by sports daily Marca. 
"It's sad that we are arguing about something like this before the Games .... They are looking for the luggage in Madrid." 
Ban rock concerts and football games? 

DES MOINES, Iowa ­An Iowa sheriff's decision to hand out tickets instead of arrests for small amounts of mari­juana invited a lawmak­er's slap that it would be simpler to ban rock con­certs and football games. 
Johnson County Sheriff 
Lonny Pulkrabek, who oversees the University of Iowa in Iowa City, told a legislative committee he would treat possession of small amounts of mari­juana like a traffic viola­tion, allowing hundreds of students arrested each year to graduate without a criminal record. 
"The guy that's carry­ing 50 bales of marijuana ... that's a different ani­mal," Pulkrabek said, adding he favored round­ing up intoxicated people in a locked "detox cen­ter" in lieu of the crowd­ed jail.

Wycliff 
continued from page 1 
University's offer Jan. 27 after a series of meetings last fall with Notre Dame officials -including University President Father John Jenkins -during which he emerged as "the clear front-run­ner" for the post, Crnkovich said. 
"lie [is] such an enlightened man, so passionate in his under­standing and his love of this University and its mission, and so articulate in his ability to help capture and convey the story that we have to tell," she said Thursday. "Once I had an oppor­tunity to spend time with him in thoughtful discussion, he fit on so many different levels, I would say, that we then moved on to a discussion of where the University was headed, and what we wanted to achieve, and how he would add value to that equation. 
" ... It's very important that our leadership is comfortable with his leadership." 
Wycliff informed Tribune edi­tor Ann Marie Lipinski about these discussions in early December so the newspaper wouldn't "be blindsided," he said Thursday. 
"She was very sympathetic and understood where my impulse is coming from," Wycliff said, adding that while Lipinski indicated the Tribune will hire another public editor in his place, the timeframe for doing so and any potential candidates are unclear at this point. 
"I hope someone is in place by the time I leave," said Wycliff, who -unlike ombudsmen at several other top national news­papers, including the New York Times -did not have a con­tracted expiration date for his term as public editor. He has served in that post for the Tribune since 2000, after being editorial page editor from 1991 to 2000. 
An October phone call from Starin first alerted Wycliff to the news and information position, Wycliff said, but Notre Dame was one step ahead of him. 
"Don has been on the University's radar as just an extraordinary fit as an individ­ual and as a professional," Crnkovich said. "I consulted with a number of different people as to who could fill Matt Starin's shoes ... and when I sought advice and counsel, [Wycliff's] name was the one that was reit­erated over and over again." 

Wycliff has remained engaged with Notre Dame throughout his journalism career, serving on advisory committees for both the College of Arts and Letters and the Gallivan Program for Journalism, Ethics and Democracy, as well as teaching a Gallivan "Media Criticism" course during the spring semes­ter. 
"lie's certainly been an active alum, so the time it will take to ramp up [to the Notre Dame position] will be fairly short," Storin said Thursday. "I think in addition to being smarter, more congenial and handsomer than I am. he brings some of the same things to the office, including a knowledge of Notre Dame. 
"... I joked to my staff, 'I may be able to play a nice guy on TV, but he's really a nice guy."' 
Staying congenial in the demanding role of public editor -the Tribune's reader repre­sentative, responsible for responding to their inquiries and often fiery complaints -served as a kind of preparation for fielding questions as University spokesman, Wycliff said. 
"People feel an investment in Notre Dame, and that's very much the way it is with a news­paper -people feel entitled to have a say about it," he said. "If I was going to send someone to a training school to be a univer­sity spokesman, I might tell them to be a public editor." 
Heading the news and infor­mation department with Wycliff will be Dennis Brown, whose promotion from associate direc­tor to assistant vice president was also announced Thursday. 
"Dennis will run the news­room," Crnkovich said, by over­seeing the department's staff and operations and prioritizing its treatment of campus news on a daily basis, while Wycliff will "concentrate a bit more on the big picture," Brown said. 
"[Crnkovich] and I talked on several occasions about what models might work best [for structuring the department's leadership] ... and came to a place that seemed good for the University, from her perspective and also for the experiences and the skill sets that Don and I have, as well as the rest of our staff," Brown said Thursday. "From our perspective, the tran­sition from [associate vice presi­dent the late] Denny [Moore] to Matt and now on to Don couldn't be any better, because we're

Brown joined the news and information staff in 1991 after a 15-year career as a writer and editor for newspapers including the Phoenix Gazette and San Diego Union-Tribune. Wycliff's newspaper background is also extensive, including stints at the New York Times, Chicago Daily News, Chicago Sun-Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and others in addition to the Tribune. An active member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE). Wycliff also has earned many professional honors, including winning the ASNE Distinguished Writing Award for Editorials in 1997, becoming a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in editorial writing in 1996 and being inducted into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame in 1996. 
Having spent his entire profes­sional career in journalism ­aside from one year as a Notre Dame admissions counselor -Wycliff said many aspects of newsroom life will be hard for him to leave behind. 
'Tm going to miss walking in the [Tribune] doors every morn­ing and being greeted by the security guards, who are nice guys, and the little lady who cleans the offices," said Wycliff, who has made arrangements to move to South Bend. "Sitting in on newsroom meetings, talking to people about stories, the feel­ing-even if it isn't true-that you know something not every­body else knows. I'll miss writ­ing, too, I love to write.

be. And from the point of view of someone who has covered Notre Dame's student govern­ment for three years, the finer points of the platforms just don't matter in the long run. The basic principles -more accessible government, better community relations, improved diversity services -stay the same year after year, and a good idea gets attention no mat­ter who wins. 
The candidates themselves and the style of diplomacy they bring to office are what deter­mines how much gets accom­plished. Campaign promises get handed down from administra­tion to administration until one of them is strong enough to actually make a dent in the stu­dent government 'to do' list. 
I give a nod to the younger tickets of Wells-Chamberlain and Black-Martinez and send them on their way. It takes a lot of guts (or "GUTS", ifyou're the McCune-Szewczyk joke ticket) to put yourself out there and run for election, but the leader of the student body should have more than a semester or three under his or her belt. 
On the subject of maturity, the Laws-Costa ticket might want to be careful about how they pres­ent themselves, for their actions at the debate last night were nothing short of petulant. Overly aggressive, they broadly attacked the current student government and slung a few handfuls of mud directly at fel­low candidate Lizzi Shappell. By harping on relatively minor details like eight-ounce 'To Go' cups, repeatedly labeling the Baron-Shappellleadership "mediocre" and calling Shappell out for not attending a commu­nications department meeting, Laws and Costa unnecessarily took the low road. 
Their focus should be on larg­er policy solutions -the presi­dent's responsibility lies there, not in a few more gulps of din­ing hall coffee -and on how they will expand upon the advances of this year's student administration, which hap­pened to be one of the most influential and successful in recent history. 
Laws and Costa were bull­headed and hostile -not exact­ly the people you want dealing with the University administra­tion at such a delicate and cru­cial time. "Stick-it to Jenkins"? Why not just put up a dartboard with his picture on it; it gives the same impression. Laws and Costa need to take a few lessons in diplomacy before they are ready for office. 
Shappell and Andrichik shined in the debate. Their answers were detailed and strong, and they didn't sink to exchanging blows with their fel­low eandidates to gain ground. The experience Shappell has as vice president is absolutely invaluable. New presidents often spend half their term eul­tivating working relationships with University higher-ups; she already has them. 
But there is a danger in thi<>, as Shappell and Andrichik must distinguish themselves. A con­cerning amount of their plat­form eonsists of projects or poli­cies already in the works ­they should indicate what makes them unique. 
With any luck, Laws-Costa and Shappell-Andrichik will have another shot at a debate after Monday's general election -one that will be a little deep­er than an eight-ounce coffee cup, and more genuine than a eardboard cut-out.

West Coast terror plot disclosed

W/\SIIINGTON -Under fire for eavesdropping on 1\mnrieans, Presidont Bush said Thursday that spy work strntehing from tho U.S. to /\sia helpnd thwart. tnrror­ists plotting to usn shoe bombs to hijaek an airliner and crash it into the tallnst skyscraper on the West Coast. 
"It took the combined efforts of several countries to break up this plot," Bush said. "By working together we stoppnd a catastrophic attack on our homeland." 
Some information about the foiled attaek was dis­dosed last year, but Bush ofl'ered more details. lie did not say whether infi1rmation about the West Coast plot was eollectod by his admin­istration's program to moni­tor -without eourt war­rants -some calls to tho

AP 

The U.S. Bank Tower is shown Thursday after President Bush said the U.S.-Ied 
global war on terror foiled purported terrorist plans. 
Thursday, four Senate Republican holdouts reached agreement with the White House on minor changes in the Patriot Aet, hoping to dear the way for renewal of anti-terror legis­lation that Bush says is essential in the fight against terrorist..<;. 
In his speech, at the National Guard Memorial Building, Bush said Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the reputed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, began planning the West Coast operation in Oetober 2001. One of Mohammed's key planners was a man known as Hambali, the alleged operations chief or the ter­rorist group Jemaah lslamiyah, which is affiliated with al-Qaida. 
"Hather than usn Arab hijackers as he had on Sept. 11, Khalid Sheik Mohammed sought out young men from Southeast Asia -whom he believed would not arouse as mueh suspicion," Bush said. 
As tho plot was described, the hijackers were to use shoe bombs to blow open the coekpit door of a eom­mereial jetliner, take control of the plane and crash it into the Library Tower in Los Angeles, a 73-story building sinee renamnd the 
U.S. Bank Tower. In his remarks. Bush inadvertent­ly referred to tho site as "Liberty Tower." 
The president said tho plot was derailed when a Southeast /\sian nation arrested a key ai-Qaida operative. Bush did not name the eountry or the operative. 
Frances Fragos Townsend, assistant to tho president for homeland seeurity and eountnrtnrror­ism, said Mohammed, work­ing with Hambali in 1\sia, recruited four mnmbers of the terrorist cell and trainnd il'> leader in how to usn shon bombs. 
Townsnnd said it was not elear whether there was any eonneetion bntween the West Coast plot and shoe bombc~r Hiehard Hnid, who tried to blow up a trans-1\tlantk flight in I>ncmnbnr 2001. 1\ftnr that. the Transportation Security Administration began ask­ing passnngers to takn ofT their shoes for inspm:tion.

Hostage journalist pleads for help 
Associated Press 

B/\GIIDAD Kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll appeared in a video aired Thursday on a private Kuwaiti TV station, appealing for her support­ers to do whatever it takes to win her release "as quickly as possi­ble." 
Carroll, talking in a calm. com­posed voiee and wearing tradition­al Arab attire, said the date was Feb. 2, nearly a month after she was seized in Baghdad by armed men who killed her Iraqi transla­
tor. She was shown sitting on a chair in front of a wall with a large iloral design. 
The 28-year-old freelance reporter for The Christian Seienee Monitor said she had sent one let­ter and was sending another to "prove I am with the mujahedenn." 
"I sent you a Iotter written by my hand, but you wanted more evi­dence," she said. "I am here. I am fine. Please just do whatever they want, give them whatever they want as quickly as possible. There is very short time. Please do it fast. That's all." 
Tho 22-seeond video was earric~d by /\Inti TV, a private Kuwaiti channel, and indudnd audio, unlike two previous videos of Carroll that were broadcast by /\1­Jazeera television. !\ producer at Al-.Jazeera said the station did not receive any letters with the videos it aired. 
After Thursday's broadcast, Carroll's family issued a brief statement through Tho Christian Science Monitor, saying only that "the family is hopeful and grateful to all those working on Jill's behalf."

Petitions

natures now but want to collect "several thousand" before pre­senting the petitions to Jenkins during the middle of next week, Hedfield said. 
"i think students are begin­ning to realize just how critical unrestricted academic freedom is to the mission of this Catholic university," Redfield said "We can sustain our academic repu­tation and our Catholic charac­ter only by critically engaging every intellectual, spiritual and ideological viewpoint of the Notre Dame family. Intolerance is not a Catholic value." 
Anna Gomberg, a third-year graduate student and co-coordi­nator of the unrecognized gay/straight student group AllianceND, said her group had come together with United for Free Speech in support of the Gay and Lesbian Film series ­a unity that is "absolutely" essential to furthering their cause. 
"I am really, really inspired by the way United for Free Speech and everybody around us has pulled together, made this a real conversation," Gomberg said. "We think that it's a pretty visi­ble [sign) of all of us being in one place on the first day of the Gay and Lesbian Film [series)." 
She said the event's name change -an agreement reached between the University, the Film, Television and Theatre department and student organ­izers -was a sign of the rele­vancy of the film series and that should have the right to define students' rights to academic freedom of every sort on cam­pus," the group's statement reads. 

The majority of students took the handout and kept it. Some paused to sign the group's peti­tion -Redfield estimated between 300 and 400 signa­tures were collected this morn­ing -while others, rushed or uninterested, ignored the requests. 
Freshman Michael Spencer, who stopped to sign the petition, said he better understood the issue after writing a First Year Composition paper on Jenkins' recent addresses. 
"The main issue comes down to respect, respect of Father Jenkins and for the Catholic views of the University," Spencer said. 
He said he didn't think contro­versial events like 'The Vagina Monologues' should be banned, because students have a "right to see" them. 
"But I think there should be compromise," Spencer said. "Notre Dame is, after all, a Catholic university." 
Other students passing by were less knowledgeable on the academic freedom debate. 
After being handed the Open Speaker Policy, sophomore Jake O'Neill said he "didn't know much about it." 
''I'm for [academic freedom], I guess," O'Neill said. "I don't know really, though." 
Sophomore Kristy Schlueter said she needed to do more research on the discussion before committing herself to one side or another. 
''I'm all for

taking the University away from being an academic institu­tion and it would bring it more into the realm of the Church. 
"We are hoping the petition will show the administration just how committed the students are to academic freedom." 
The majority of people enter­ing the Performing Arts Center Thursday night stopped to sign the academic freedom petition. 
Curtis Leighton, a senior col­lecting signatures at the Center, said awareness was an impor­tant goal of the night's cam­paign. 
"The Queer Film Festival is really a huge part of this aca­demic freedom [discussion], and it is important that we are here," Leighton said. 
Students on their way to class Thursday morning were handed a copy of the Open Speaker Policy outlined in duLac, a statement that United for Free Speech members believe fully supports the presence of contro­versial events like 'The Vagina Monologues' on campus. 
"Notre Dame students may invite and hear any person of their own choosing," duLac reads. "Sponsorship of guest speakers does not imply approval or endorsement of the views expressed, either by the 
sponsorship  group  or  the  
University."  
United  for  Free  Speech  

believes there is nothing in duLac to suggest students are not considered "open speakers" under University policy. 
"Until duLac changes, no one the University 

of Arizona, junior Ben Fredlake said he did­n't have all the background on the controversy on campus. 
"]But] I don't really have a problem with what Father Jenkins said," he said. 
Other students stressed the magnitude of the issue and firmly articulated their stance. 
"The fact that Father Jenkins is even letting us comment like this, I think, is really important, and it's important that both· sides are presented," senior Stefanic Dittert said. "I think we've seen a lot of the other side, like 'Oh, I agree with Father Jenkins' ... like stop. I'm in 'The Vagina Monologues,' I think it's really important that they go on. 
"I think these are issues that everyone at a Catholic universi­ty needs to be aware of, and there needs to be open debate on both sides." 
And it seems debate will con­tinue to escalate, Redfield said. She has been contacted by numerous national and interna­tional news organizations ­including the New York Times, National Public Radio and the Associated Press -and hasn't seen any decrease in activity among students. 
"This is not an issue that will die easily," she said.

freshmen Ryan McCune and Tim Szewczyk, juniors Lizzi Shappell and Bill Andrichik and sophomore Erica Wells and freshman George Chamberlain all partidpated in the debates. 
As in previous years, the ideas presented by candidates were similar -especially since a large chunk of the debates was based on pre-chosen top­ics. But the manner of' presenta­tion varied greatly, something evidenced in the opening state­ments. 
Wells and Chamberlain focused on their enthusiasm and commitment to Notre Dame. 
''I'm so passionate about this school, I have a Notre Dame tat­too," Wells said. "This is such an amazing school, but it's not ideal. What's the best way to make an impact? Why not go for it all?" 
She stressed the importance of hosting open forums, some­thing she and Chamberlain said sets their campaign apart. 
"Our campaign is really about a democracy," Chamberlain said. '']Student government] is a republic right now." 
Szewczyk -the only candi­date not dressed professionally 
sported a bandanna wrapped around his head and strummed a guitar next to McCune, who said there were "some good things about Notre Dame, and some things that are awful." 
"Hopefully, we can keep [the awful things] up," McCune said. 
Laws and Costa, who used a more aggressive debating style, criticized several aspects of the current administration headed by student body president Dave Baron and Shappell. 
"Some of these main points ... aren't getting done," Laws said. 
ning not for resume, not to net­work. Our platform is based on your ideas, based on what you came and told us, what athletes came and told us, grievances of dorms that came and told us." 
Black told a story about famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who received a call that a roof was leaking and told workers to "rise above it." 
"To those who would point to lack of experience," he said, a reference to his and Martinez's comparatively young age, "the leaders have had their chance .. . The roof is leaking. Let's rise above it." 
Shappell and Andrichik deliv­ered their remarks and ideas through the lens of experience, pledging to bring students every idea outlined on their platform. 
"We've proven ourselves in that experience -we brought you to-go cups, we brought you community relations, we have an ambitious platform," Shappell said. "We believe with current relationships [and I cur­rent projects, we have the abili­ty to bring you results." 
Ideas on how to improve stu­dent life ranged !'rom promoting better gender relations -a pri­mary Black-Martinez goal-to infusing the campus with Nickelodeon-style "Global Guts" and "Legends of the Hidden Temple" competitions, proposed by McCune and Szewczyk, who vowed to "bring back slime." 
Shappell and Andrichik said they would focus on increasing student contact with University administration and getting more students to sit on University committees, while Laws and Costa said they would push for weekly town hall forums for students to voice their concerns. 
No candidate had a concrete plan to approach the issue of academic freedom, but most came to the consensus that it was an important concern wor­thy of significant consideration. Laws and Costa took a negative approach -on par with their heavily critical tone of the night -to say the current student government isn't doing enough. 
Shappell said student govern­ment is taking a "proactive role," encouraging senators to collect opinions from their dorm communities and bring them back to meetings for discussion. 
"That is the most essential role for us to fulfill," she said. 
Candidates addressed the topic of community relations third. 
Wells said it was "not a new problem" and that she would like to see students have "more of a voice in South Bend, more community service projects [to] see that we're not just weekend partiers." 
Costa proposed a "student discount fair" to inform stu­dents of opportunities available in South Bend. 
"This is a community, a town we can embrace, a city we can embrace," he said. 
Defying convention, McCune said he and Szewczyk were not focusing on the relationship with the community. 
"Boycott the Bend!" said McCune, who made a spin on the Laws-Costa "Stick-it-to­Jenkins" cardboard cutout idea, proposing a "revealing card­board cutout of yours truly, like from Major League, for the South Bend residents." 
The candidates also answered questions on plans for Student Senate interaction, ways to improve Grab-and-Go, approaches to better gender relations, their relationships with members of University administration and their ideas for improving the bowl game ticketing system.

GM's plans lack magnitude 
Automaker struggles to cope with expensive employee benefits, Asian competition 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -General 
Motors Corp. made some 
tough decisions this week. 
Unfortunately, the automak­
er's mess requires tougher 
moves and a jolt of imagina­
tion. 
The numbers speak for themselves. Thn future cash savings from a dividend eut, a reduetion in white-eollar benefits and a cut in execu­tive pay -totaling less than $HOO million a year overall -merely skirt the prob­lems facing a company that reported a net loss of $H.6 billion in 2005. 
The issues, like two invisi­ble monster trucks in the room, are more than a quarter million workers with hugely expensive bene­fits and a management team that hasn't figured out how to design and build ears as well as those from Asian rivals that consumers arc buying. You ean't fix problems like these with financial nips and tucks. 

It's logical to expect investors and the small fraction of GM workers affected by the company's latest plans to share the pain.

TODAY'S STAFF 

Random thoughts on a winter's day 
Why can't people be more like our feathered friends? 
As I sit here writing this article it is about 19 degrees outside and my knee hurts due to a recent incident involv­ing me and a patch 
of ice. I am wonder­ 
ing why I decided on  
a college that is in  
this snow globe also  
commonly referred  
to as South Bend. I  
think the birds are  
really on to some­ 
thing ­ we should  
Mollyall head south dur­ 
Ackering the winters. I am  
not just talkingabout a six day jaunt  Nobody Likes a  
in March. Several  Dumb Blonde  
months in the sun  

would be ideal; besides, who doesn't look better with a little tan? 
The Bookstore ought to screen peo­ple before allowing them to buy appar­el. 
Currently in the Chicago Arch Diocese there are several priests being tried for alleged pedophilia. One of these men, Fr. Daniel McCormack, decided to wear his Notre Dame sweatshirt to court. That's really great press. Exactly the kind of image Notre Dame should want people conveying ­maybe someone should think about sending Saddam one for his trial too. 
The opening ceremony for the Olympics is tonight. 
This is pretty exciting because I actually prefer the Winter Olympics to the Summer. With the exception of fig­ure skating and ice dancing, it seems to me that most of the athletes in the winter games are more rugged and tough than the divers and gymnasts. That said, any event where you can listen to your iPod while competing or where a broom is in an essential part of your equipment is not a real sport in my book. 
I bet John Wayne is rolling over in his grave. 
The Duke would be mortified to hear that people are flocking to theaters to see a movie about two kissing cow­boys. Honestly, in some of John Wayne's movies he didn't even have time for romancing women, let alone men. If he were alive today to see this he would be about 98 and so there isn't a lot he would be able to do, but he'd probably send Chuck Norris to go roundhouse kick the boys on Brokeback in the face (can someone explain this recent phenomenon to me?). 
A new project for local government officials. 
Now that this whole time zone fiasco has been taken care of, I have a new idea that cari keep them busy -I think smoking should be banned from South Bend bars. We all kriow the obvious reason which is the dangers of smoking for the actual smokers and those who are exposed to it second­handedly. Additionally, I hate the fact that you cannot go grab a drink with friends without coming back smelling like an ash try. 
Why can't my fellow schoolmates just take a joke sometimes? 
I don't mean to over-generalize, but I often hear my fellow Saint Mary's stu­dents complaining about jokes about them. While I can understand why one would take offense when a school they are proud to attend is being attacked, you have got to have a sense of humor too. A Saint Mary's joke in South Bend is an easy a laugh as a blonde joke. They are funny because they are so absurd. Just as fair-haired people are no less intelligent than brunettes and red heads, students at Saint Mary's are not inferior so simply take it in stride and have a good laugh. 
Spring Training is just about two weeks away. 
I am already nervous about this coming baseball season. I thought with the White Sox sweeping the Series in 2005 I would enter this season feeling confident and at ease. Now that I have had a taste of the glory, I want more. I guess the fact that it has recently come out that our Coach of the Year, Ozzie Guillen, was hungover when he applied for his job doesn't help all that much. Let's save the cocktails and hangovers for celebration after the games, rather than before! 
So that is what's on my mind right now -it's been a long week and I can honestly say that I am glad it's Friday!

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Unique atmosphere must be preserved 
As the president and vice president of the Western Massachusetts Notre Dame Club, my wife and I received an e-mail today from a student repre­senting a group called United for Free Speech (UFS). The email informed us that UFS has been formed "to protest Father Jenkins, recent censorship of student and faculty productions," and directed us to the group's website. I took the opportunity to visit that site today. Putting aside arguments over whether Jenkins, position really con­stitutes censorship and whether or not the productions in question are immoral, it occurred to me that per­haps the strongest argument in sup­port of Jenkins is the argument that his position promotes true diversity of thought, if not on a campus-wide level, than certainly on a nationwide and even international level. 
In UFS's zest to enhance the diver­sity of thought at Notre Dame by removing all limits on what can be said within the University's facilities, what they are actually advocating is that Notre Dame become just like nearly every other academic institu­tion in America. If UFS succeeds, it will have succeeded only in diminish­ing the diversity of choices available 
to high school seniors as they decide 
which environment would be most ·conducive to their pursuit of the 
truth. 

If a student wanted to attend a uni­
versity where productions such as 
"The Vagina Monologues" and the 
Queer Film Festival are welcomed 
and encouraged, she would certainly 
have a long list of institutions from 
which to choose. Likewise, if a stu­
dent wanted to attend a Catholic 
institution where the Catholic faith is 
treated as little more than a relic of 
the school's past and where religion 
is not important enough to be allowed 
to stray beyond the walls of the cam­
pus chapel, again, she would have 
many choices. But if a student wished 
to study in an environment where the 
teachings of the Catholic Church play 
a central role in all aspects of campus 
life and where religious faith and the 
search for truth are seen as mutually 
beneficial, not mutually exclusive, 
that student would have precious few 
choices. 

If UFS sees itself as advocating that 
Notre Dame expose its students to a 
viewpoint or perspective to which they would otherwise have no access, it gives itself too much credit. "The Vagina Monologues" and productions providing the homosexual perspective are both thoroughly commonplace in American academia today, as is the general concept that academic free­dom means that nothing is off-limits (as long as it is politically correct, of course). What UFS is actually advo­cating is that Notre Dame stop expos­ing its students to a viewpoint and perspective which is nearly extinct in academia and start doing things the way Boston College, Penn State, Indiana University South Bend and countless other institutions are already doing them. That would be a shame, not so much for the alumni and current students of Notre Dame, but for the high school students of America, who would see the diversity of choices available to them signifi­cantly narrowed as Notre Dame stopped standing for something and fell in line with the rest.

Cable regretted 
I lament the University's deci­sion to install cable in individual dorm rooms. Among other things, I worry what it will do to Notre Dame's proud rosidential tradition in the time to come. 
Lounges and lobbies, the exelu­sivn domain of' the campus' cable television, become places for soda( bonding. Speaking from experitmce living in a men's dorm, any tehwised sports event has the power to draw half a hallway into the lounge li1r an cwming. Even privatn common rooms where roommates set up satellites btH~onw open-door congregations. Once all those channels arn avail­able in every room. I wonder if that camaraderie will go the way of' the Dumont Network (i.e .. dis­appear). It's long before my time, hull get the feeling that since the unfathomable age bdorn every room had intnrrwt connections, thn social atmosphere at Notre Damn has bnm1 afl'nctnd negative­ly. This sm~ms to be another irwvitahle, albl'it convenient, step in that dirnction. 
Thn news that installation is now expected to go on for as long as six weeks is troublesome for students, like myself, who refuse to own a cell phone -six weeks without my dependable, reliable, above-all audible land-line phone. At least if I want to eall home, I have an excuse to drop in on a friend who still has service. More importantly, what do I do in my own room if I have an emer­gency? What about the $144 I've paid for phone service this semes­ter'? Will I receive a refund for these six weeks, Oflice of Student Aceounts? Or will! have to give in and join the ranks of the cellular, publidy announcing my where­abouts with every next-minute ring? 

While my hopes are that these aren't the halcyon days for the sense of community I've found, one niee thing about the project is the quiet time it's brought for con­tmnplation. When the dark ages arc finally over, I may just leave my connection unhooked and enjoy the prolonged solace (and the letters, like this one, that I've been able to write without dis­traction).

Open letter to Father Jenkins 
"For as of late there has been an active cam­paign, carried on in the name of the social func­tion of propaganda for special views which are dogmatically asserted to be socially necessary." 
John Dewey, Freedom and Culture, 1939 
Dear Father .John Jenkins, 

In the weeks since your speech on Academic Freedom and Catholic Culture, the eampus has been embroiled in debate. Many have offered eloquent and passionate arguments in support of events such as the Queer Film Festival and 'The Vagina Monologues." I have been impressed by their articulate responses in The Observer, in dorm diseussions and personal talks with friends. I have even started to come to an understanding of what they are arguing against. 
I don't think even they entirely understand, however, what it is they're arguing for. 
You see, nobody is arguing that Notre Dame must sponsor every academic event, conference or performance that eomes iL<> way. I also have not heard anyone argue that "The Vagina Monologues," for example, are not egregiously opposed to Catholic teachings. 
What I have heard are many arguments that such events are irreplaceable. Again, using "The Vagina Monologues" as an example, sup­porters have argued that perf(Jrmances help heal women, edueate the campus about women's issues and stop domestie abuse. 
By claiming that "The Vagina Monologues" are the only vehicles through which such heal­ing can take place, its supporters are demand­ing that Notre Dame take a position which has clear theological implications. Let me sketch out the ramifications of their argument as follows: 
1) A<>suming that the Vagina Monologues are indeed egregiously opposed to Catholic teach­ings, 2) and accepting its supporters, position that no comparable production, which would include the Catholic perspective, could accom­plish the same goals, 3) it follows that Catholic teachings must be ignored for the said goals to be fulfilled. 4) If Catholic teachings must bn ignored. this must mean that Catholic beliefs about sexuality are not only insufficient (in which case a performance which united both secular and Catholic viewpoint<; would sullicc), but completely wrong. 5) Ifthe University agrees that "The Vagina Monologues" do indeed have an irreplaceable impact on campus, and therefore allow them to be perfiJrmcd, the implieation is that the University believes state­ment 4 is true. 
Can the supporters of "The Vagina Monologues" really ask Notre Dame to make this statement and in doing so, contradict our Catholic identity'? Knowingly or not, that is what they are doing. The supporters must either agree that "Tho Vagina Monolobrucs" could be amended so as not to completely oppose Catholic teaching, or acknowledge that in sup­porting this performance, Notre Dame would be denying part of its Catholic identity by denying part of' the Church's daim to truth. 
The samo logieal proposition holds tnw f'or all similar evcnl'>. Notre Dame could conenivably sponsor an event which was non-Catholic, but any produetion which is spedfically anti­Catholic and refuses to address rnlevanl Catholie perspectives loads to the same eonun­drum as "The Vagina Monologues." 
I am not eneouraging Notre Damn to with­draw f'rom tho sneular world. Hathor, as a lead­ing Catholie Univnrsity, we need to engagn it. But if we-with our immense intellectual, finandal and spiritual resources conli1rm with modern culture to the extent that we bngin to believe that only through anti-Catholic meas­ures can certain topics be addressed, I fear we will have settled for a position which will end up nullifying our great Catholic intelleetual her­itage.

SUB PREVIEW 

Talented authors highlight festival 

By GRACE MYERS Scene Writer 

The highly anticipated Notre Dame Literary Festival will occur this upcoming week, starting Feb. 13, bringing together diverse and highly acclaimed writers, novelists, journalists, poets and our most promising student writers. 
Laura Fox, the Student Union Board (SUB) Chair for the Literary Festival, worked diligently to gather respected writers that will appeal to everyone on campus. She worked to continue and improve the Festival's tradition of promoting scholarly and creative study of contemporary lit­erature. 
Fox said her main goal is to make this week "about a celebration and love of literature." This

lections and author of the thriller novel "Cast of Shadows" -one of the Chicago Tribune's "Best Books of 2005." The Student Night will also fea­ture Saul Williams, the renowned slam poet and former Grand Slam Champion. He appeared on HBO's Def Poetry Jam and is the author of four unique poetry collections. The Student Night will include 15 student performances. These highly dedicated student writers range from freshmen to graduate students and will perform poetry, slam poetry, prose and short stories. 
Rane Arroyo will be giving a lecture on Feb. 15 on his poetry, experimental short stories and playwriting. His lecture and workshop are co­sponsored by the Institute for Latino Studies. He is the author of five well-respected poetry books, his newest work, "The Portable Famine," focuses on his personal struggles of 
discussions and workshops given by authors of very different backgrounds and genres, and is open to all students and fac­ulty members. Fox organized the workshops to be "intimate discussions with the author," where one can speak with the author about how he or she developed their style and their work. 
The opening author will be James Salter, a novelist, short story and prose writer. The Bloomsbury Review called him, "one of the best writers in this country," and Publishers Weekly praises his work as "some of the most esteemed fiction of the past three decades." Salter's lec­ture and workshop are co-sponsored by the English Department and the Creative Writing Program. His writing focuses on human desire in its different forms, with an admirable style noted for its brevity and impressionistic tones. 
Salter will be followed by Tasha Alexander, a South Bend native and Notre Dame graduate. She wrote her fist work of historical fiction, "And Only To Deceive," and is now working on a second novel. 
The Literary Festival's Student Night will take place on Feb. 14. One of the highlights of the Festival will be host Kevin Guilfoile, a Notre Dame graduate published in short humor col-
Buzz Bissinger is the final author of the Literary Festival. He is most recognized for being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his work at the Philadelphia Inquirer on the Philadelphia Court System, his writing for Sports Illustrated and as being the author of the acclaimed "Friday Night Lights." Undoubtedly one of the most distinguished and multi-talented writers of our time, he has received numerous prestigious awards for his work as a reporter, magazine writer, sports writer, non-fiction and television writer. 
A great deal of effort has been put into this year's Literary Festival, not only by the Student Union Board, but also the English Department, the Creative Writing Program and the Institute for Latino Studies. Interest in improving liter­ary opportunities seems to be growing around campus with the creation of organizations such as Mustard, an undergraduate creative-writing club, and Notre Dame's new slam poetry team. 
This year's annual Literary Festival is sure to be a great experience for all. For the complete listing of all activities, times, locations and available workshop sign-ups, visit www.nd.edu/-sub/ndlf.html.

With recent campus debates over University President Father John Jenkin's comments on academic free­dom still fresh in students' minds, the Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spectatorships series is in full swing at the Browning Cinema. The series kicked off yester­day with two screenings of Academy Award nominated "Brokeback Mountain," directed by Ang Lee. "Brokeback Mountain" is one of four already sold-out films, with its second screening selling out in only two hours. 
The aim of the series, which for­merly went by the name of the Queer Film Festival, is to present films that make students question what a gay and lesbian film is, or even if it can be categorized in a "gay and lesbian" genre. The student organizers for this year's film series are graduate stu­dents Harry Karahalios and Martin Lain a. 
"We feel as student organizers that this is an important event for Notre Dame students because it gives stu­dents the opportunity to look at con­temporary culture and see these great films," Laina said. "The films present students with the opportunity to ask academic questions and raise ques­tions about our contemporary cul­ture." 
The six films being screened are "Brokeback Mountain," "Breakfast on Pluto," "Happy Endings," "Saving Face," "Gay Republicans" and "Cachorro (Bear Cub)." The first three films explore the complex genre of a gay and lesbian film. 
"Brokeback Mountain," starring Oscar nominees Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, follows the love story of a ranch-hand and a who fall in love herding s summer only to keep th secret over the years as married, have children cope with their feelings for er.

RYAN BLACK president 
vice president CATHERINE MARTINEZ 
Who They Are 
Black is a freshman in Knott Hall who intends to major in English. Martinez is a fresh­man in Cavanaugh Hall who intends to major in Political Science. 
In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: Their top priority is to improve Notre Dame's community relations with South Bend. They said they can resolve this issue over the next three years they will be at Notre Dame. 

+ 
First Priority: Black and Martinez want to implement an athletic mentoring program with the children of the com­munity. They said they have already spoken with athletes who would be willing to start this program. 





In Our Words 

+ 
Best Idea: Getting more children from the South Bend community involved in a mentoring program with athletes. Although programs are in place, a cen­tralized program is a good idea. 

+ 
Worst Idea: Diminishing dances. from their Web site: "Dances tend to not be a good idea to better Gender Relations. People invite friends of the opposite sex to dances, thus making it difficult to meet other students of the opposite sex." 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Natural Disaster Relief Committee 

+ 
least Feasible Idea: Tie between After-Parietals Lock-In and 'Students would be able to redeem unused dining hall meals for friends visiting from out of town.' They call this "friend meals." ' 

+ 
Fun Fact: Black is dyslexic and has short term memory disorder, something he said makes him

Bottom Li~ 
This freshman duo is inexperienced and unprepared. They have good intentions, and Martinez is a strong leader; however, they are not ready to take the role of representing the Notre Dame student body. Their plat­form is incomplete, especially in the important realm of community relations. Black and Martinez's plans for dining hall reform are not feasible, as are some of their plans to improve gender relations. These two do not seem to have a true idea of what they would be getting into if elected, and should use their sophomore years to get more involved in student government. 
JASON LAws president 


vice president BOB COSTA 
Who They Are 
Laws is a junior political science and spanish major who lives in Fisher Hall. Costa is a sophomore in Zahm Hall who is an American Studies major. 

In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: Laws and Costa said they want to join groups on both sides of the debate on academic free­dom. They said they want students to have a voice while the issue is resolved. 

+ 
First Priority: The first project for the Laws/Costa ticket would be to provide town hall forums around campus to allow students to voice their opinions and to work toward a compromise. 




In Our Words 

+ 
Best Idea: Town Hall-style meetings around campus in which students would be given the opportunity to voice their opinions on the issue of academic freedom and Catholic character. 

+ 
Worst Idea: "Stick it to Jenkins," which would consist of life-size cutouts of the University presi­dent stationed around campus that students would stick Post-It notes on to express their concerns. 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Create an Off-Campus Housing Guidebook 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: Student-only pep rallies on Thursday nights

+ 
Fun Fact: Laws was on the National Champion fencing team and was on MTV's "Next." Costa hosts a show on NDTV called "Office Hours." 

+ 
Notable Quote: "This isn't about meet-and­greet or networking -we have a responsibility to represent the students."-Jason Laws. 



Bottom Line 
Both Laws and Costa have strong personalities, and both know how to lead, with Laws serving as his class president for two years and Costa as a program director for Student Union Board. This ticket has run its campaign admirably. Costa and Laws have talked to numerous administrators about their proposals and talked to students from all dorms and all athletic teams to get input and help engage students in student government. Their efforts to reduce student apathy should be com­mended. The resulting platform is polished and ambitious, but not as achievable as Shappell and Andrichik's platform. Ultimately, the downside of Laws and Costa's commendable passion is an antagonistic attitude toward administrators that should not be chosen to represent the student body.

TIM SZEWCZYK 

Bottom Line 
McCuno and Sznwezyk arn just two more Zahm freshmen running !'or this office. Although their Nieknlodoon-based ideas are entertaining and sound like fun, this ticket has no real plans for stu­dont govnrnmnnL Tho Aggro Crag is innovative, and they elaim they have talked to a donator in Biloxi, Miss., who is rnady to give "just under live figures." Thny also proposed, instnad of "Stick it to .Jenkins," a "Stick it to Hyan," as to avoid problems with the administration. These freshmen have cre­ative ideas, many of which relate to Nickelodeon and its former television shows for children, but their interests might be better served in another arena than as the leaders of' the Notre Dame stu­dent body.

LIZZI SHAPPELL president 

vice president BILL ANDRICHIK 
Who They Are 
Shappell, the current stu­dent body vice president, is a Badin Hall resident majoring in political science and peace studies. Andrichik is a junior in Stanford Hall majoring in political science and English. 
In Their Words 
+ Top Priority: Shappell and Andrichik plan to addross the issue of commu­nity relations by working with already established connec­tions in the Law School to help students understand the ordinance that was passed this summer. They also plan to help students adjust to moving off campus by provid­ing information sessions. 
+ First Priority: "Student Choice at Grab 'n' Go" 

Shappell and Andrichik want to survey students to deter­mine which items will be added to Grab 'n' Go, per­haps including hot food items. 

In Our Words 
+ Best Idea: Community Relations plan. Shappell and Andrichik have outlined a comprehensive and realistic agenda to help students not only adjust to off-campus Jiving but also to improve community relations with the city of South Bend. 
+Worst Idea: None 
+ 
Most Feasible Idea: College Readership Program

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: Establishing a cafe in the llesburgh Library 

+ 
Fun Fact: Shappell can detect types of mint by smell. Andrichik, although a long-time Wisconsin resident, hates the NFL's Green Bay Packers. 


+ Notable Quote: "Our huge selling point is that we expoet to achieve everything on this platform."­Lizzi Shappell. 

Bottom Line 

Shappell's experience as the current student body vice president is impossible to top, and Andrichik is an articulate and complementary pickup as her run­ning mate. Their administration could hit the ground running even more quickly than last year's and eon­tinue to build on the success Shappell has achieved this year with student body president Dave Baron. The only question mark here is whether Shappell can emerge as the leader of the student body after a year in Baron's shadow, and whether Andrichik, cur­rently the junior class president, can transition smoothly to a higher position. But the pair's experi­ence and professionalism are unmatched. 
ERICA WELLS president 


vice president GEORGE CHAMBERLAIN 
Who They Are 
Wells is a sophomore psy­chology major who lives in Pangborn Hall. Chamberlain, a freshman, lives in Sorin College and intends to major in politi­cal science and psychology. 
In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: To improve Multicultural and Gender rela­tions by working with the Gender Relations Council and the MSPS in addition to finding a way to educate freshman about such issues. 

+ 
First Priority: To put stu­dent government back in the hands of students by creating open forums and giving stu­dents more chances to be heard. 


In Our Words 
+ Best Idea: Soliciting stu­dent opinion on academie free­dom and Catholic character through straightforward, accossible surveys and o-mails. 
+Worst Idea: Community bikes -bikes around cam­pus designatod for general student use. 
+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Bringing student governmont to students by periodically moving student government meetings to residence halls and by meeting informally with studenl'>. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: Open forums with rectors to give them student foodback on their perf'ormances ­rector evaluations are already in place through the Office of Residence Lif'e and Housing 

+ 
Fun Facts: If she could, Wells said she would go skydiving everyday lor the rest of her life--she's done it twice and has plans to do it again. Chamberlain can drink a gallon of' milk in under half-an-hour without immediately throwing up. 



+ Notable Quote: "We're not out thorn to just be politidans. I think being a loader is different from being a politician."-Erica Wells 

Bottom Line 

These two say they aren't politicians and it is obvious why. Wells has never been involvod in studont govern­ment, and despite her involvement in the Gender Relations Center, she is not ready to assume such a lead­ership role. Chamberlain is impressive for a freshman; however, he too has much to learn. This ticket has some good ideas, including the use of tJm GHC; however, they haven't investigated the feasibility of a lot of their pro­posals. This tieket said they only have a few proposals because that is what they think they ean accomplL'>h, but the limits they set for th(lmselves are not ones studenlo; should want their leaders to impose on their potential. 
page 4 The Observer+ ELECTI 0 N 2006 Friday, February 10, 2006 




The Observer endorses Shappell-Andrichik 
One year ago at this time. when Dave Baron and Lizzi Shappell were running for and winning the positions of Notre Dame's new student body presi­dent and vice president, The Observer didn't think they were the best candidates for the job. 
While Baron was a strong. experienced leader, Shappell lacked his polish and stayed too silent in his shadow. But that changed quickly and dramati­cally over the last 12 months, as the pair ran a professional, productive administration that led to singular praise from Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman and other administrators who are typically wary of student gov­ernment-a respectful rapport that allowed Baron and Shappell to strongly represent students at the highest level of the University. 
Far from remaining in the background of these relation­ships, Shappell equally earned them with Baron while also emerging as a leader in her own right. Her presidential eampaign this year has rein­forced this image, showing that, joined by junior class president Bill Andrichik, Shappell too can head the stu­dent body. 
The Shappell-Andrichik plat­form addresses the biggest issues facing Notre Dame today -community relations, aca­of student groups, dorms and athlet­they should be ic teams. This able to trust their

themselves into just yet. Martinez showed poise and should certainly become more involved in student govern­ment, perhaps to take a top position in a few years, but she is not ready yet. 
Erica Wells and George Chamberlain are not prepared to take office either. Their pro­posals are few and they have not researched their platform thoroughly. Chamberlain, another unusually polished freshman, has potential to do good things for student govern­ment, but he needs more expe­rience. 
Freshmen Ryan McCune and Tim Szewczyk are mildly enter­taining but offer few realistic ideas. 
Unlike last year -when there were three standouts ­the best ticket is obvious. Shappell and Adrichik are familiar with each other's lead­ership styles and complement each other's strengths. 
Shappell already has a good relationship with the new University administration ­even joining Baron as student government's first ex oficio members of the Board of Trustees -at a time when it is crucial to have a trusted liaison for the voice of the student body. 
This ticket knows its stand on academic freedom and Catholic character -believing events expressing alternative view­points belong at Notre Dame because they challenge and strengthen students' faith ­but is willing to listen to the student body's voices to come to the most appropriate resolu­tion to present to the adminis­tration. 
And the rest of their platform, particularly their plans for community relations, is not only achievable but airtight. But most importantly, because Shappell is already in office, this ticket will be able to start implementing its ideas on stu­dents' behalf with virtually no transition period. At what could become a turning point for the University, there is not a minute to lose. 
Make no mistake -Shappell would not be taking office by default. She has earned it by working extremely hard over the past year to establish pro­ductive, respectful relationships with administrators, by defin­ing her own leadership style and by developing a results-ori­ented platform that she and Andrichik will accomplish. 
The student body deserves the best possible student body president and vice president to represent them at this impor­tant juncture. The Observer endorses Lizzi Shappell and Bill Andrichik for Notre Dame's 2006-07 student body president and vice president. 

demic freedom and diversity ­presenting necessary and real­istic plans of action for each. However, Shappell and Andrichik are not the only qualified, driven candidates in the race.

crucial debate 
about Notre 
Dame's identity, 

was the right way to go about devel­oping a campaign-getting stu­dent opinion before developing ideas that are supposed to ben­efit students, rather than brain­storming in isolation. 
The ticket's desire for trans­parency in student government to pave the way for future stu­dent leaders are commendable. Laws' honesty is also refreshing -from acknowledging he did a lot of soul-searching before deciding whether to seek to the presidency to saying of his run­ning mate, "I didn't even like this kid last year when he ran." When he says his campaign is from the heart. voters should believe him. But Laws and Costa lack the relationships president and vice 
president to con­vey those voices firmly, but also professionally and respectfully, in order to be taken seriously. Laws and Costa would not be, and students would suffer for it. After the Shappell and Laws tickets, there is a significant dropoiT in the quality and expe­rience of candidates. While it is encouraging that an unusually high number of underclassmen demonstrated interest this year in taking leadership roles and improving student life, they lack the background and knowledge to succeed in the student body's highest office.

Black and Martinez say they, can address this issue during their three years at Notre Dame.,but it Iieects to be handled now. Getting students to volunteer is not a solution.

Associated Press 

THENTON, N.J. Wayne Gretzky was recorded on a wiretap talking to the alleged lin­under of a gambling ring, diseussing how the hockey great's wife eould avoid being implicated, a person with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press on Thursday. 
Gretzky, coach and part­owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, can be heard on wiretaps made within the past month talking about his wifo with assistant coach Hick Tocchot, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. 
Gretzky's wife, actress Janet Jones, allegedly bet at least $100,000 on foot­ball games over the course of the investigation by state authorities, the per­son said. 
There is no evidence that Gretzky placed any bets, according to the person. 
Authorities say from Dec. 29 through Feb. 5 ­the day of the Super Bowl -bettors placed a total of $1.7 million in wagers with tho ring run by a New Jersey state trooper, 
IN BRIEF 

Skiers suspended for exces­
sive hemoglobin levels 
TUHIN, Italy-Eight cross-country skiers eompeting in the Olympics, including two Americans, were sus­ponded for livo days after they were found to have excessive hemoglobin levels, the International Ski Federation announeed Thursday. 
None of tho skiers suspended were considered serious medal eon­tenders, and it was not immediately clear whether any would be kept from competing under the ban. It was not dear when the ban began. 
Calls seeking commPnt from the ski l'oderation and the International Olympie Committee were not imme­diately returned early Friday. 
The American athletes are Kikkan Handall, 23, from Anchorage, Alaska, and Leif Zimmermann, 22, of Bozeman, Mont. The others are: Scan Crooks of Canada, Sergey Dalidovieh of Belarus, Jean Marc Gaillard of Franee, Aleksandr Latzukin of Belarus, Natalia 
Tocchet and a South Jersey man . 
Investigators say about a half-dozen current NIIL players placed bets with the ring and are looking into whether anyon(~ involved in the 5-year-old operation, which authori­ties say had a connection to organized crime in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey, wagered on NIIL games. Gretzky is not the main foeus of the probe, the p1~rson said. 
The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified law enforenment sources, first reported or a wiretap involving Gretzky in Thursday's newspapers. The newspaper also reported that Jones bet $500,000 during tho inves­tigation, including $75,000 on the Super Bowl. 

Earlier in the wonk, Gretzky denied any involvomnnt in the ring. 
"My love for lwr (Jones) is deeper than anything. The reality is, I'm not involved, I wasn't involved and I'm not going to be involved. Am I concerned for both of them'? Sun~ there's concern from mo. I'm more worried about thorn than me. I'm like you guys, trying to ligun~ it all out," Gretzky said Tunsday.

Theodore tests positive for 
banned substance MONTHEAL -Montreal goalie Jose Theodore has tested positive for a banned substanco in pre-Olympic screening because he was using a hair-growth drug that can be used ·as a masking agent, the Canadiens' team doctor said Thursday. 
The test wasn't part of the NIIL's new testing program, so he will not be subjeet to league discipline. 
Theodore was not picked for Canada's Olympic team, but was on the preliminary 81-playor eligibility list. He is appealing tho result and his casn has yet to be heard by an arbitrator. 
Canadiens team doctor David Mulder said at a news conference that Thoodorc was tested Dec. 12. A month later, the I Iockey Canada doc­tor informed Mulder about Theodore's test result.

Pebble Beach Pro-Am gets off to a record-setting start 
Donald matches course record with a 62 only one year after Phil Mickelson set the seemingly unapproachable mark 
Associated Press 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. ­Luke Donald was in the group ahead when Phil Mickelson blistered Spyglass Hill last year for a course-record 62. He remembers being amazed at the score, and hearing how it would be a long time before anyone else could do that at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
"It only took 365 days," Donald said Thursday. ''I'm glad it was me." 
Taking advantage of weather that approached perfection, Donald holed out for eagle from 96 yards, strung together birdies and wound up matching Mickelson's record with a 10­under 62 to take a one-shot lead over Mike Weir. 
Not many could recall condi­tions so pure at Pebble Beach, where there was no trace of a cloud or a breeze and tempera­tures were pushing 80 degrees. 
No one remembered Spyglass being such a pushover, either. 
Traditionally the toughest among the three courses at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, it yielded the lowest scoring as the first round head­ed for a conclusion. 
It still required good golf, and Donald delivered. After missing a 10-foot birdie putt on his opening hole, No. 10, he ran off three straight birdies, one of those a 45-foot putt on the par­3 12th. Then came his sand wedge from 96 yards to a hole location on the front shelf of the green that dropped for eagle, and another birdie on the 15th. 
"Not much was going wrong," Donald said. "I didn't really threaten to make bogey today and kept it in play." 

His round went so well that when he hit 6-iron into 12 feet on the ninth hole, it was the same putt he had on Wednesday during a practice round, so he knew the break. And he knew what it meant. 
"I knew that was for 62," he said. 
And he remembers what hap­pened last year. Mickelson fol­lowed that 62 by going wire-to­wire at Pebble Beach, taking a seven-shot lead into the final round. 
But Mickelson already had a three-shot lead after the first round. Donald was only one ahead of Weir, who recovered from a sloppy start to make five straight birdies along Stillwater Cove. He missed only one fair­way and two greens, and the only thing he didn't get with a 63 was the lead. 
"I knew there was going to be some low scores today," Weir said. "But 10 under at Spyglass? I thought of the lower scores, there might be more on this golf course than Phoenix with a driver and a the other two. But Luke obvi­wedge, Donald showed there is ously played a great round over still room for someone who tidi­at Spyglass to do that." ly navigates his way around the

Mickelson, meanwhile, looks like he will end a dubious over 73. 
"You see some of his drives ... if I could hit it that far, this game would be easy," Donald said. "But you still have to get the ball in the hole." 
He twice holed putts longer than 30 feet, which always helps. And the biggest help of all was Mother Nature, who allowed the peninsula to shine like never before. More than 100 players in the 180-man field broke par, meaning Donald had plenty of work left the rest of the week.

But tho rules varied. The Mountain Wnsl Confnrnncn. for instancn, was tho only league that p11rrnittnd coaches' ehal­llliJgns. Of tlw 35 plays ehal­lnngnd, only l'ivn calls worn rnvnrsnd. 
"That may not sound likn a lot, but if you have live plays that eould ehange the gamn if not eorrect11d, that is a prntty strong pereentage," said Charles Broyles, chairman of tho committee and coach at Pittsburg Stal!1 University. "We thought that providing a r.oach 's challnnge would act as an additional safnty net and give the coaehns morn involve­mont in the process." 

Coaehns would eall timeout to make a challenge. If the call was ovnrturned, the team would keep its timeout and retain its challenge until they lost one. If the call were uphnld, the team would be charged a timeout and the coach couldn't challenge again.

The playing rules oversight panel must still approve the rneommnndations. 
Another change would not allow thn visiting team to doterminn if replay will be used in nonconference games. Last ynar, Southern California opted not to have replay when it played at Notre Damn. If approved, that option would not exist next season. 
llalpin also said that the committee discussed contin­gnncy plans if there are techni­havn any complaints with the way it was last year," Hutgers coach Grog Schiano said in a telephone interview.

"If you're willing to risk a timeout for it, it's probably worth it," he said. "llaving instant replay in any form is better than not having it. Let's make a good thing the best we can make it." 
The committee also made several recommendations to shorten games, -such as 15 minute half-times -which are more frequently going beyond four hours. 
If approved, halftime would bp, shortened from 15 to 20 minutes and the game clock would start when the ball is kicked -not when it is touched by the receiving team.

OLYMPICS 

Olympic organizers refuse to identify who will light flame 
Former Italian sports heroes are rumored possibilities for symbolic moment in Opening Ceremonies 
Associated Press 
TURIN, Italy -It is always the question on everyone's mind leading up to the Olympics, long before a single medal is earned or a record shattered. 
Who will light the 0\ympie flame? 
Italian organizers, as offieials traditionally do at each Olympics, remained tightlipped about the identity of the final torch bearer for Friday's open­ing eeremony at the Olympie Stadium. A crowd of 35,000 was expected to watch the event live, with an estimated 2 billion more tuning in world­wide. 
Humored torchbearers inelude a pair of Italian Olympic heroes: cross-country skier Stefania Belmondo and skier Alberto "La Bomba" Tomba. Neither was shy in the run-up to the 2006 Games about their designs on the honor. 

The ceremony promises an event filled with "Hhythm, Passion and Speed" -includ­ing a performance from the sublime Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, and the promise of inline skaters with ridiculous helmets shooting six-foot red flames. 
The official Turin Web site promises the fiery sight, dubbed the "Sparks of Passion," will evoke "the world of myths and. at the same time the look of cartoons, infecting the stadium public and televi­sion viewers all over the world."

Notre Dame set for Windsor meet 
ByJORDAN BELTZ 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame returns to aetion this weekend as it heads north of the border to partieipate in the Windsor Invitational in Windsor, Ontario. The Windsor Invitational is the final meet before next weekend's Big East Indoor Championships, which are being held in Akron, Ohio. 
The Irish are eoming off of a strong showing in the Meyo Invitational, a meet in which the team set three new pro­gram records. Junior Kurt Benninger came up just short in challenging reigning nation­al ehampion Mike Woods, a Miehigan senior, in the 3,000­meter run, but Benninger's time set a new sehool reeord and qualified him for the NCAA Indoor Championships on Mareh 10-11 in Fayetteville, Ark. 
Benninger was not the only Irish runner to turn in a strong performanee. Sprinter Maryann Erigha qualified for the NCAA ehampionships in both the 60-meter dash and the 200-meter dash.

Freshman pole vaulter Mary Saxer once again performed well, taking home second place in the women's pole vault with a vault of 3. 95 meters. 
"My goal for the remainder of the season is to just get back to where I was last sea­son," Saxer said Thursday. "I want to be able to eonsistently elear the heights that I was clearing when I was at my peak last year." 
Notes:

ties on Thursday. Executive producer Marco Balieh, who has worked in the past with U2 and Pink Floyd. said the show would demonstrate the "pas­sionate way in whieh the Italians live life -the way they ..drive, the way they dress. 
Designer Giorgio Armani designed the eostumes used for the protoeol eeremony present­ing the host eountry's red, green and white flag; super­model Carla Bruni will earry the flag before it is raised above the stadium. 
Other highlights: Fake cows on rollers share the stage with daneing trees in a tribute to the Alps and their farming eul­ture. A recessed row of bench­es in the middle of the stage will allow athletes to stand front and eenter. 
Olympians will enter in the traditional parade of nations, a segment lasting more than 30 minutes in which athletes from some 80 countries parade by. 
But these Winter Games eer­emonies feature no ice of any kind, not when temperatures in the 40s render outdoor sur­faee unusable. Expeet some snow -or at least white-elad dancers sporting balloon-like giant bubbles. 
The lighting of the Olympie flame, regardless of who gets involved, is always a highlight of the ceremony. 
Four years ago, the members of the 1980 U.S. hockey gold medal team reunited to handle the honors. Japanese skating great Midori Ito, tears stream­ing down her faee, ignited the flame at Nagano in 1998. The 1994 Lillehammer Games 

began with ski-jumper Stein Gruben sailing through the night sky, toreh held high as the world watched. 
In Atlanta in 1996, a trem­bling Muhammad Ali famously lit the torch. 
Whatever happens, a replay of the last Winter Olympies held in Italy -the 1956 games in Cortina-is unlikely. 
The opening ceremony crowd watched in disbelief as skater Guido Caroli tripped and fell while heading to light the Olympic flame. 
He managed to keep the flame burning during his spill a half-century ago, and even enjoyed a role in getting this year's flame to Turin. Caroli aeeompanied skier Kristian Ghedina as he relayed the torch through Cortina in January.

Anahei111 loses in contract battle 
Jury decides that Angels were legally justified in changing name 
Associated Press 

SANTA ANA, Calif. -A jury ruled Thursday that the Angels did not breaeh a con­traet with the city of Anaheim when the baseball team changed its name. 
Jurors rejected the eity of Anaheim's argument that the baseball team violated a stadi­um lease and cost the city where it plays at least $100 million in revenue by changing the name last year from Anaheim Angels to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The jury, which deliberated for a little more than four hours, also found the team did not violate a state law requir­ing good faith and fair dealing. 
"I was trying to create some­thing positive and more inclu­sive ... whieh we believed was our legal right to do," Angels owner Arte Moreno said. "Long term, we're going to have a healthier franehise that can compete. 
Anaheim Mayor Curt Pringle 
Anne-Here's to your 80s prowess, coordinating 
... and the ONLY slightly embarrassing picture of you! Huzzah! 
was disappointed, adding the case was about more than just a name change. It was "to make sure the identity of our community, both in Orange County and in the eity of Anaheim, was preserved," Pringle said. 
The city sued the Angels for breach of contract in January last year, shortly after Moreno ehanged the name. 
City officials said the change cost Anaheim at least $100 million in lost tourism, publiei­ty and so-called "impressions" _ buzz the city gets eaeh time its name appears in the national media in eonjunction with a major league baseball team. 
City officials also elaimed The Walt Disney Co., which sold the franchise to Moreno in 2003, agreed to call the team the Anaheim Angels and signed a 1996 stadium lease agreement committing to that. 
Although the lease language said only the name shall "include" the word Anaheim, the city said Disney promised to call the team the Anaheim Angels in exchange for eon­cessions, including stadium repairs and the use of the sta­dium itself. 
Moreno maintained that changing the name did not violate the contract because he kept Anaheim in it. He said he wanted to use Los Angeles to capitalize on the seeond­largest media market in the nation, adding the new name would attract more publicity, broadcasting contracts and sponsors.

Irish travel vvest to San Diego for Duals 

Team set to face Cal Fullerton, Air Force, Stanford and others 
fly DAN MURPHY 
Sports Writer 
Notrn Danw will finish up its regular season this week­nnd by traveling to the University of California at San Diego (UC San Diego) this Saturday to take on a host of top competitors. 
With All-American fencers from Air Force and Stanford competing at the annual San Diego Duals, the Irish will have a good opportunity to prepare for the upeoming NCAA Tournament. 
Cal State Fullerton, UC San Dingo and Cal Tech are among the other teams in the strong field that will chal­lenge the Irish before the team nmbarks on its postsea­son national title defense. 
The NCAA Tournament 

begins March 4. 
The Irish have reason to be hopeful this weekend, as they have improved statisti­eally in many categories since last year. 
The men's foil and sabre teams have seen the most dramatie leaps in winning pereentage, going from .694 
to  .724 and .750 to  .798,  
respectively.  
The women's epee  team  

also has improved steadily throughout the year thanks to contributions from senior Becea Chimahusky and jun­ior Amy Orlando. 
The men are ranked No. 2 nationally, and the women own the top spot in the polls. 
After the San Diego Duals, the Irish will be back in action Feb. 25-26 for the Midwest Fencing Conference Championships. The Midwest Hegionals of the NCAA Tournament follow a week later.

said. "We did a pretty good job on her last time we played her, and we played a lot or defenses, so I think that's what were going to do again. The biggest thing with her is we can't let her get good position." 
Notre Dame will also look to contain guard .Jenna Hubino, who scored 25 points in the tnams' previous match-up. 
"Hubino just went off on us last game," McGraw said. 
While Hubino and Smith attract the most pre-game attention, McGraw has empha­sized her team must stop everyone on the well-rounded DePaul team. 
"They're a very good team," she said. "We can't focus on just one or two people." 
Sunday's rematch comes at a point in the season when the Irish, who are currently ninth in the Big East, need to play well to keep their NCAA Tournament hopes alive and keep from slipping out or the top-12 in the conference, where they would be ineligible for the conference tournament. 
"I think there's a sense of urgency now," McGraw said. "We've kind of had our back against the wall for a while now. I think that's why we had that fierce comeback against Villanova. We know how impor­tant every game is." 
The Irish's road back to .500 will go through unfriendly ter­ritory, as DePaul has been 11-1

The team will practice today before Saturday's match against Purdue and Sunday's double­header with Wisconsin and Bradley. 
"It's been good to take a step back and get a little rest and start fresh," Bayliss said. "With matches Saturday and Sunday, we certainly didn't want to work them very hard physically any­ways and I think that is the right thing to do." 
Three of Notre Dame's four losses have been 4-3 heart­breakers, and two came against top-10 teams. All four were road matehes. 
However, the close losses once were blowouts. Bayliss said that the competitiveness of the team this season in front of its home crowd. 


"It's a tough place to play," McGraw said. "They get a great crowd, a really hostile environ­ment. It's going to be very dilli­cult, maybe the most difl1cult 
is a sign or how far the team has come. 
"Two years ago when we played Duke at Duke, it was a very one-sided," he said. "Just a year ago here on our courts, it was 6-1, and this year at Duke we found ourselves in position to win the match. One way to look at it is to realize the progress that's been made and feel good about it." 
The Irish arc young, espeeially at the top of the lineup, with junior Stephen Bass and sopho­more Sheeva Parbhu splitting time at the No. 1 and 2 posi­tions. Barry King, a junior, has been successful at the No. 3 spot, and Brett Helgeson, a freshman, rounds out the top­four. 
Ryan Keckley has been consis­tent at No. 5, going 5-1 so far in the dual match season. 
No. 6 has seen a number of players rotate in and out of the position, including lrackli Akhvlediani, who is still recov­ering from an injury sustained 
environment we've bnen in this year." The game will be broadeast on ESPN2.

The team's ability to rotate players-particularly at the bot­tom of the lineup -should help for the three matehes this week­end, Bayliss said. 
"I think with three matches in two days, one of the lkey points is the ability toI rotate one of the players in who haven't been playing regularly, giving them a little more playing time to make sure no one is worn out or gets injured," Bayliss said.

By DAN MURPHY 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame travels to Tobacco Hoad this weekend to take on two ACC tennis pownr­houses. The No. 22-ranked Irish will faee their toughest challenge to date in the spring snason against the strong opponents. 
After defeating both Ohio 

State and Xavier 7-0 on Jan. 28, the team remains unbeat­en but also largely untnsted up to this point.

The Irish first faee the ITA No. 25 Demon Deacons of Wake Forest Saturday in Winston-Salem, N.C. Thn next day, the tnam makes tho short trip to Chapel Hill to take on another ranked opponent, No. 10 North Carolina. 
In both matches the Irish

Ferris State goaltender Mitch O'Keefe will pose a strong threat for the Irish scorers as he has posted an 11-7-5 record this year with a 2.60 goals against average and a .906 save percentage. 
The Bulldogs are equally as dangerous on offense, coming off 7-2 and 4-2 wins over Western Michigan last week­end. The Irish must neutralize Bulldog center Greg Rallo to be successful on defense. The senior has 15 goals, 17 assists on the yea"r. 
Notre Dame is taking this weekend in stride and hopes to make a statement in the stretch run of the CCI-IA sea­son. And to do so the team looks to continue to play to their strengths -power plays and faceoiTs -and improving their offensive weakness. 
"I think our power play has been pretty good moving the puck and I think we're coming together, our kids are working hard," Pooley said. "We want to improve everything, that's where we are at right now." 

Notes: 

+ 
After this weekend, Notre Dame will have played eight games against teams currently ranked in U.S. College Hockey Online's national top-20. That elite list includes five top-1 0 teams -No. 2 Miami (Ohio), No. 7 Michigan, No. 8 Colorado College, No. 9 Denver and No. 10 Michigan State. The Irish also faced No. 18 Nebraska­Omaha and No. 19 Lake Superior State. 

+ 
Although eight of the 11 teams in the CCHA are ranked, Notre Dame still can earn an opening round series at home with a strong showing down the stretch.

Notre Dame has two games with fifth-place Ferris State 
Team lost two games to Michigan State by one goal last weekend 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The Irish are used to taking to the ice against some of the best teams in the country -it's unavoidable when they play in a powerhouse conference like the CCHA. This weekend will be no exception, as Notre Dame (9-16-3, 7-12-3 CCHA) faces the No. 20 Ferris State Bulldogs (14-1 0·6, 9-8-5) in a home-and-home. 

"We've been playing good hockey and in college hockey there's not much difference between [the two] teams," Irish associate head coach Paul Pooley said. "A power play goal here, a five on five -faceoff goal here and all of a sudden your winning some games." 
Prior to last weekend's sweep at the hands of Michigan State, the Irish had gained points in every one of their series dating back to the last weekend of November, when they suffered a two­game sweep at the hands of Ohio State. Currently the icers are tied for ninth in the league with Bowling Green and Alaska-Fairbanks -the two teams left on Notre Dame's schedule after this weekend. 
"I don't think we need a 

sweep, we just want to keep progressing as a team," Pooley said of the team's need to get a jumpstart up the standings. "That's our main priority ­going into the playoffs feeling good about ourselves." 
An area in which the Irish have been trying to improve has been on offense. In the last four games they have lit the lamp only four times and were shut out by Ohio State two weekends ago. 
To combat this, Pooley and

Chi-town showdown 
Irish face DePaul in road rematch; won last meeting, 78-75 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
The Irish are hoping their second meeting with DePaul will have the same end result as their first one. 
Notre Dame (14-8, 5-6 Big East) will travel to Chicago Sunday, where they will take on No. 17 DePaul (19-5, 6-5) at 
5:40 p.m. in a nationally tele­vised rematch of their Jan. 17 game. Notre Dame won that game, 78-75, coming back from a 12-point deficit in the second half. 
The Irish, who have found themselves behind more than ten points in nine of their last 12 contests, will look to play strong from the opening whis­tle. 
"We're getting down too big of a hole early, and that's what we need to avoid," Irish head coach Muffet McGraw said. "That's why we've been chang­ing the lineup, trying to find a group to get out to a good start, and,we really haven't done that yet. 

Senior guard Megan Duffy will head Notre Dame's lineup. She averages 15.7 points and 
38.7 minutes per game. Senior Courtney LaVere also should start, avPraging 14.6 points a game the past three contests. 
But McGraw said the Irish will rotate their players in the first half and play the hot hands towards the end of the game. 
"Everybody goes and plays in the first half, and whoever plays the best plays in the sec­ond half," McGraw said. 
The Blue Demons will chal­lenge with center Khara Smith, who is currently fourth in the Big East with 17.9 points per game. 
"She's a tough matchup; she's a really good player," McGraw

By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
There's no place like home for the Irish. 
After a grueling stretch of three road matches in four days, the team returns to its home turf at the Eck Tennis Pavilion for three matches this weekend. 
The Irish are 2-4 this season -with three losses coming to top-1 0 teams -but 1-0 at home after notching a 7-0 shutout of William & Mary on Jan. 29.
