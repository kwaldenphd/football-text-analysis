'Dillon decision' to affect student life for years to come 
"Husb, children, whars that sound? Everybody look whars going down." -Buffalo Springfield 
Some residents of Dillon Hall had a tailgater in the parking lot outside·Michigan Stadium a couple ofweeks ago and sang the famous Dillon fight songwhile the "Big Red" fla8 flapped in me breeze above me party. 
Administrators heard of me event and took discipli­nary action against the entire dorm. Residents have been forced to forget about one oftheir two hall dances this semester and are required to participate in a com­munity service project. 
Apparently, the University officials who imposed this punishment interpreted the party as a hall-sponsored event, even though no hall funds were used to finance the festivities nor was the party advertised as a Dillon 
tailgater. John Goldrick, as­ 
sociate vice president for  
residence life, would not  
give specific details about  
the rationale behind me  
punishment. Nonetheless,  
the hall and the campus ap­ 
pear to have accepted it.  
Something is very wrong  
here.  
The main issue this situa­ 
tion addresses is whether  
the University's rules, as put  
forth in du Lac, have juris­ 
diction beyond the boun­ 
daries ofthe campus.  
Father Joseph Carey,  
Dillon Hall rector, said he  ~Ai(  
believes they do. He offered  loiQrfi/OCf  
as precedent for the Dillon  
decision a 1983 incident in  

which a Notre Dame senior entered a "Wet Willie" con­test in a Daytona Beach bar. 
The senior, outfitted in Irish regalia and body paint, stripped off his clothes on stage in an effort to win the contest. He didn't win. lnst~ad, he returned to campus to find the administration threatening him with expul­sion. 
During an eleventh-hour meeting between then Dean of Students James Roemer and a packed chapel full of students at Morrissey Hall, Roemer decided not to expel the student, but ramer had him make a formal apology to the Notre Dame community. 
This is poor precedent for the Dillon decision be­cause no formal punishment was taken against the stu­dent. Instead, his actions, which were indisputably out of line, were met with compassion and understanding from the administration. The University made me right decision and was able to avert addressing the problem ofdu Lac's jurisdiction.

With the Dillon decision, however, the hard line has been drawn. The administration is implying that Notre Dame's rules apply to students at all times, wherever they might be. 
This decision has not been made with a great amount of grace. By not responding to inquiries for the rationalization behind the decision, the University has denied students the compassion that accompanied the I983 incident. · 
They have replaced understanding with a dangerous precedent of closed­mindedness. Their failure to explain their decision threatens the spirit of com­munication that is essential to the mutual respect and understanding between stu­dents and administrators. They seem to feel they don't have to explain themselves. 
Maybe they don't. 
Student leaders have failed to respond to this challenge. The days when student leaders questioned the validity of such deci­sions have apparently ended. Instead, the student 
/OI:t body is confronted with an attitude ofcomplacency and blind acceptance -and the 

unconditional surrender of the rights of me student in decisions that will have reverberations for years to come. 
Something must be done. 
The Student Senate should put this on their agenda. The Judicial Council should go through du Lac and see if the administration's decision is in the spirit of that document. And the Healy administration should adopt an attitude of confrontation, rather than appeasement, on this issue. 
Dillon Hall should challenge the forfeiture of their SYR. The hall should perform the community service, but only if accompanied by a statement that says the service is being done voluntarily and not as an act of punishment. 
This is an important decision the University has tried to slip by students. It is more than just an issue of some guys being punished for singing a dirty song and drink­ing beer. More than just an SYR has been forfeited. Along with the dance, me acceptance of this punish­ment would be a forfeiture of our rights as individuals. This cannot and must not be tolerated.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa Police said yesterday that five more blacks were killed in anti-apartheid violence, and Bishop Desmond Tutu said he wondered if advocates of peaceful change should "sit down and shut up" and let the rioters prevail. 
Tutu, the black Anglican bishop of Johannesburg and Nobel Peace laureate, though frustrated by per­sisting violence, said he would not abandon his advocacy of peaceful protest "because we love this land." 
Police battled rioters around johannesburg, Pretoria, near Cape Town and outside Port Welizabeth on the Indian Ocean coast.

Career program offers observation, action 
By CANDICE BECKER 
News Staff 
Interested in spending a week of your Christmas vacation working in your future career? If so, the Notre Dame Alumni Association has the program for you. 
The association is sponsoring a Career Exposure Program, a chance for juniors and seniors who have had the necessary prerequisite courses to spend a week working for a firm in their field, according to Marla Micelli, director of the program. 
"This program offers juniors and seniors a chance to explore the areas they area looking at and to see other professionals in action," she said. 
She said this is the second year for the Career Exposure Program, and last year 22 students participated. 
The program is strictly volunteer on both sides, Micelll said. The stu­dents volunteer their energy and skill, and the employers volunteer their time and work space. 
For logistical reasons, it is best if the students participate in the program in their particular area, said Micelli. Otherwise, problems with housing may arise. 

Micelli wrote to the Notre Dame: Alumni clubs across the United States soliciting interest in the: program. They responded by in· forming her of the types of workers they could use. 
The following clubs sponsor the program in their area:

Witnesses said the fire destroyed approximately 100 shacks, leaving approximately 1,000 of the es­timated 50,000 camp residents homeless. The government provided tents. 
Police said they found the bodies of two blacks who were burned to death near New Brighton, a black area outside Port Elizabeth, 600 miles south ofJohannesburg. 
Police said they shot two blacks to death and wounded two in a crowd hurling gasoline bombs near Cape Town. In Evaton, a black area 30 miles south of Johannesburg, a government worker with a shotgun killed a black man among a crowd attacking a government vehicle, police said. No details were available. 
To speak out in favor ofviolence is an offense in South Africa, where 5 million whites dominate and deny the vote to 24 tnillion blacks through apartheid, South Africa's in­stitutionalized racial separation. 
Tutu spoke at a news conference after returning from Britain, where he met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and leaders of the opposi­tion Labor Party. 

Tutu was discussing his "attitude:" toward prospects for peaceful change In South Africa when he told reporters, "I sometimes think that we (advocates of peaceful protest) should sit down and shut up, and let those that say violence: Is the answer go ahead. But ofcourse we: won't do that because we love this land." 
He then repeated earlier state­ments that there is a point beyond which even the church would adv· ocate armed revolution against South Africa's white: rulers. 
By unofficial count, more than 750 blacks have died in unrest that began Sept. 3. 1984. Police say ap· proximately a third died in violence: among blacks, usually mobs attack­ing blacks viewed as collaborators with the whites. 
The rest, say police, were kllled by police or the army, which joined In trying to put down the riots II months ago. 
Panel looks into MOVE fire, siege 
WHYY-TV after the Fraternal Order ofPolice failed in its latest legal chal· lenge against the Philadelphia Spe­cial Investigation Commission. 
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, who will testify before the panel, appointed the 11-member commission to probe the city's attempt to serve warrants on four members of the back-to-nature group and to evict it from its fortified west Philadelphia rowhouse. 
Seven adults and four children died in the fortified MOVE house in a fire that began after police dropped a bomb on it. The fire was allowed to burn out ofcontrol for more than an hour, destroying 61 rowhouses, leaving 250 people homeless and 

causing  more  than  Sl 0 million in  
damage.

MOVE has fought authority since 1973, when It demonstrated at the Philadelphia Zoo on grounds that caging animals violated their rights and freedom. 
Homes where the group has lived in the city were littered with animal excrement artd garbage, and dogs and cats were allowed to roam. MOVE members displayed guns and used bullhorns to harass neighbors with rhetoric.

Rolling Stone's overturned by Spin 

Tim Adams 
features copy editor 
T 
hey say a rolling stone gathers no moss, don't they? 
Well, I don't think "they" have 
seen an issue of Rolling Stone · the 
magazine, that is · lately. 
How boring it Is! Who wants to 
see a five-page fashion spread 
featuring Anthony Michael Hall? 
Gee, the last time I checked, he 
hadn't released an album or single 
yet! Oh, I get it ·he has nothing 
whatsoever to do with music, so it's 
supposed to be cool to put him in 
the magazine. Silly me! 
Anyway, there has been anal­
ternative to Rolling Stone recently, 
and that's a new magazine called 
Spin. Now it's not God's gift to 
music journalism or anything, but it 
does attempt to be different, at 
least. 
Different? With people like 
Madonna, Pat Benatar, and Keith 
Richard..~ on the cover? OK, it does 
lure you into buying it by featuring 
big-name rock stars on its cover. 
But inside each issue is something 
very different than the cover story 
would indicate. 

been signed to Sire Records. Anot· her pet group ofSpin, the Beastie Boys, opened for Madonna on her Like a Virgin tour. Guadalcanal 
Diary's most recent album, Walking in the Shadow of the Big Man, did so well that Elektra Records signed them and rereleased the album on their label. These groups do have a following. 
All this is well and good, but do 
people really like the magazine? 
Juniors Todd Taylor and Bob Manning replied with a definite "no." They had never seen Spin before, but agreed to read an issue. Taylor said, " Why would someone want to read a magazine with a guy wearing a skull ring on the cover?" 
"It's a poor imitation ofRolling Stone," Manning added. "But I did think the 'Rockstars and Models' article was good. It ought to be a yearly magazine instead ofa monthly." 
Was there anything Taylor liked it all up when she said, "It's pretty vulgar · but I like it!" 
One Notre Dame student, junior Brian Peters, had a different opinion on Spin. Peters has been a regular reader of the magazine and is a fan of underground music. "It covers the scene that's happening now," he said. "It's up to the moment, and no other magazine does that." 
As for Spin's bad points, Peters said, "They should dedicate more space to the independent scene, because that's where the future of rock is now. I don't like Spin having to copout with having mainstream acts on the cover. They also review only records they really love or really hate, like Motley Crue. They should cover more." 
In each issue, there is enough material on mainstream groups to satisfy almost every taste. One plus ofSpin magazine is that it strives to cover all musical styles, thus satisfy­ing a big cross-section offans. Anot · her unique aspect ofSpin is that it lets musicians write articles for the magazine. David Lee Roth wrote a 
feature on cruising, and how to do it. Black Flag's Henry Rollins has written two articles, one having to do with 7-11 stores. Noted west coast punk producer Geza X wrote a three-part story on how to make and distribute your own record. 
Stylistically, Spin tries to be hip and funny. The publisher, Bob Guccione Jr., son ofPenthouse publisher Bob Sr., is cocky about Spin and he certainly lets it show. His introductory section "Topspin" sounds like a Sammy Davis Jr. ap­pearance on "The Tonight Show" with all the superfluous praise about Spin writers, photographers, and everyone else on the staff, including himself. 
When Spin first came out, Guc· clone bragged that it was a refresh· ing change in the music magazine industry. Maybe so, but the quality seems to be declining with each issue. My basis for saying this is that the time I spend reading each issue has fallen to about 1~ minutes, as opposed to the ho~r I spent on the first issue. 

Spin is good in the respect that it features almost 100 percent music. No articles by Thomas Wolfe which run forever, no articles on dead junior high school cheerleaders. 
Opinions on Spin are still decidedly mixed. Many people can't stand it. But many people love it. And many more, like me, find some parts ofit great and some parts terrible. There is, however, much room for improvement, and lots ofpotential. 
I still wonder ifGuccione will succeed as his father has done. Probably not to such an extent, although there is a market for dif· ferent and risky music journalism. Spin has withstood its first six issues without collapsing. I think it will be around for a while. At least we'll know it's in trouble when it begins to feature nude pictures of Madonna.

ttenhon Domers: Are you sick 
and tired ofall those mundane 
clubs you've been hearing about for 
ages? Do you long to deviate from 
your friends in the activities you 
pursue? 

When was the last time you per­
formed in precision drills in com­
petition? Or visited local military 
academies to inspect the troops? Or 
really practiced drill and 
ceremonies? 

Not recently? Perhaps never? 
Then you obviously haven't dis­
covered the advantages ofone of 
Notre Dame's more obscure or­
ganizations: the Irish Marauder Drill 
Team, led by Contact Commander 
Colleen Kain. 

The Irish Marauders are a 
"platoon that marches in competi­
tions across the country, perform­
ing precision drills against other 
universities," according to First 
Sargt:antJoe Schweninger. "These 
drills involve marching with dif· 
ferent movements that involve 
weapon maneuvers," he added. 
Last year the team competed at 
Tulane University, Purdue, the 
University ofIllinois, and others. It 
also makes road trips throughout 
the year to Lemans Military 
Academy in Indiana and other 
similar institutions to present ex­
hibitions and to inspect the cadets. 
"Later in the afternoon we eat with the cadets and explain what ROTC is all about," Schweninger explains. 

Schweninger feels that member­ship in the Irish Marauders provides insight into army life. "When we graduate we are going to be army officers, so it's good to know how to lead men and execute commands with confidence. We really get to learn D & C (drill and ceremonies)." 
Although the team has not placed highly in competition in recent years, they prefer to emphasize the learning aspect rather than the actual competitions. 
ND/SMC clubs 
Schweninger sums up this belief. "It's a great way to meet other 
'
people in ROTC. The best aspect of the team is most definitely the sense ofcamaraderie that you share with others. It's a great learning experience." 
Membership in the Marauders is open to any army ROTC cadet, excluding seniors. Practice is held twice a week from 4:30 to 6 p.m., at Stepan on Mondays and at the ACC on Tuesdays.

Do not look to Geneva with high expectations 
"We will bury you" 

-Nikita Khrushchev " ...As you say, live and let live" -Mikhail Gorbacbev As evident by the two quotes, Soviet thought on the superpower relationship bas seemingly undergone a substantial reversal since the years of shoe-banging by Khrushchev at the United Nations. 
Evan Farley in through the out door 
The Soviet Union has mounted a massive public relations campaign aimed at dispelling their image as the "evil·ftllpire" and ponray­ing the Russian bear as a mere cub that is clip­
ping its own claws while across the ocean the recalcitrant eagle sharpens its talons. The war of the words before the Nov. 19 and 20 sum­mit between the world's two most powerful men has been fought for many months, with the newest Soviet salvos having put-to-shame the catchiest jingles written on _Madison Avenue. Are the Soviet's earnest in their proposals, or are they giving us the same gifts wrapped in fancier paper? Before: you answer yes to either question, consider these next 
few points. 

 Be careful not to be mislead by Ule plen­titude ofproposals containinggrandiose num­bers and percents. Numbers can be easily twisted to make any proposal seem charitable, with the case in point being the new Soviet proposal to reduce long-range and medium­range nuclear weapons by 50 percent. On the surface it seems like a startling and revolution­ary proposal, yet many r~rvations quickly 
emerge. A loophole in the offer is that the Soviets could pick and choose less valuable systems to scrap while maintaining their force of SS-18's highly accurate and their 1 0 war­head carrying ICBMs that are potential first­strike weapons. The Soviets also made the offer in hopes of controlling weapons that could strike at the homelands of the super­powers, which would mean that medium­range U.S. Pershing Il's based in Europe would come under the proposal's jurisdiction, while the Soviet counterpart force, the SS-19, would remain untouched due to its inability to reach American soil. One must realize that although offers such as this may truly signal a Soviet wil­lingness to bargain, one should endeavor to look past the numbers and see what is really being offered -fancy figures on paper or 
meaningful reductions. 

 Read into the context ofnew developments and avoid taking them at face value. Soviet in­transigence about the militarization of space is unfounded though catchy. The anti-satellite system recently tested by the United States is simply a missile fired from an F-1 5 aimed against a military target in space and is no of­fensive threat. The only militarization ofspace possible in the near future is the mid-course stage of an ICBM as it proceeds on its deadly mission. An elegant Soviet offer to ban development ofnewstrategic weapons would do no more than seek to halt the future deployment ofthe land-based MX and Midget· man missiles, the sub-based D-5 missile and the Stealth bomber, all at early stages of development, while the Soviets proceed with deployment of their new SS-24 and SS-25 ICBMs. The moratorium on nuclear testing did nothing to affect the Soviet nuclear force 
posture since they rushed to complete their year's testing before the eve ofthe fortieth an­niversary of the Hiroshima bombing, while seeking to prevent the United States from hoi­.ding two very important tests dealing with "Star Wars" research and the Trident missile program. Their condemnation of the U.S. ASAT system test failed to point out that they have had an operable (though somewhat clumsy) ASAT system for years. All of their proposals seem stabilizing and beneficial to 
superpower relations, but unfortunately are obviously one-sided when viewed even su­perficially. 
 Do not expect too much from the Geneva talks. Much ofthe Soviet public relations cam­paign has as its focus the building up of ex­pectations through propagandawhile banking on U.S. intransigence on some of the previously mentioned proposals to make it ap­pear the "bad guy" in the eyes ofthe world. As one might remember, the United States used the same tactic successfully against the Soviets a few years ago concerning the "Zero Option" and the deployment of Pershing ll's, and now the Soviets are using the strategy against the U.S. on the "Star Wars" issue. Presi­dent Reagan has remained adamant in his refusal to abandon space defense research, while the Soviets have made their 50 percent weapons reduction proposal contingent on the United States' abandonment of even the most basic research into the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Soviet Union is clearly trying to box the United States into a corner where their are two unpleasant options: abandon­ment ofthe talks followed by world-wide con­demnation; or abandonment of the Defence Initiative and the possibility to significantly in­
crease national security. With such stances being held by the Soviets, it is hard to see any meaningful agreements coming out of Geneva. 
 A wolf in sheep's clothes...Gorbachev and company may drink Coca-Cola, wearing Cal­vin Klein designer suits, listen to Bruce Springsteen, and watch Miami Vice, but they are still Soviets and such social aspects make them no more likely to compromise Russia's geopolitiCal position than President Reagan's drinking of vodka or development of a penchant for cabbage and caviar would make him any less concerned about U.S. national in­terests. Wearingcowboy hats and telling jokes does not make one sincerely peaceful (although it seems to work for one Western leader), and the American populace must realize that under all ofthe glitter, we are still faced with a Soviet leader who, though dynamic, may be all the more dangerous for that same reason. 
"Ideas are weapons," said Victor Lenin and 
·ifthis is so, the Soviet and American citizeni-y must head for the shelters as we near the date of the opening of the summit. Are the Soviets really prepared to bargain? Early indications cast much doubt on this statement, although of course no one can answer with absolute cenainty except Gorbachev and a few of his top aids. So when the American public sits back and digests the propaganda soon to be force fed to it, let us hope that the meal was worth sitting at the table in Geneva and that after all of the hoopla, we don't come away saying, in the words of the soon to be famous political scientist, "Where's the beef?"

Notre Dame fails to help eliminate apartheid 
Each day more are arrested, burtS:ed from their homes, and killed. With each new dawn South Afri<;a becomes a slave to both apar­theid and total chaos. Desmond Tutu's cries for peace are challenged by the cries of militant youths calling fo.r weapons. This country on the southern tip of Africa is savagely torn. The dagger of divisiveness has failed to create"'a neat incission; the police battle the youths, mourt'ledbattle the govern­ment, blacks battle whites, and tragically, blacks battle blacks.

save the whales 
Below this apparent havoc is a government which insists that it is committed to attaining peace through .compromise and negotiation while, in fact, re:fusing to engage in active dis­course. The government of Pretoria, reiterat­ing its confidence in the present form of segregation, has implicitly assured the world that deplorable prejudices legally carried out within its boundaries will continue. Yet, after the protests, the rallies, the empty words, the funerals, the states of emergency, all that remains are dead bodies. South Africa has cer­tainly become one ofcivilized man's greatest moral attrocities. 
As this horrifying drama unfolds daily, out­siders must ask themselves what they can do to eradicate such injustice. The inevitable answer to this question, it seems to me, is simple: a moratorium on all current invest-

ments with companies i:hat have vested inter­ests in South Africa, followed by complete divestment. This course of action should be taken immediately (ifit isn't already too late) by all investors in South Africa, including the Univerisity ofNotre Dame. 
Through investments, Notre Dame and ot­
hers lend tacit legitimacy to the racist regime 
of South Africa. More importantly, however, 
Western investments are the "legs of apar­
theid;" they bolster the South African 
economy and reinforce the Pretorian govern­
ment. Notre Dame and others have neglected 
the "immeasurable moral dimension of a 
policy toward South Africa." Investors, Notre 
Dame included, consider their relationship 
toward companies in South Africa in a purely 
economic sense. They refuse to acknowledge 
that their irresponsibility leads to the ex­
ploitation, death, and destruction ofan entire 
race ofpeople. 

Representative Stephen J Solarz of New York asserts that "our corporate presence must be seen in the context of a brutal racist system that denies fundamental rights to the vast majority ofits people." We cannot, in this case, assent to the basic capitalist tenet, profit at all cost. We must recognize the implica­tions of such investments and consider responsibly the role of and our relationship toward corporations in South Africa. 
Critics claim, however, that the corporate sector, by adhering to rudimentary principles ofmorality (i.e. the Sullivan Principles), is not aiding the apartheid regime but actually hel­ping the blacks. The argument that divest­ment of American economic interests from 
South Africa will hurt the blacks, by creating greater unemployment and decreasing their standard ofliving is misleading. Ifinvestments continue at such a great rate, many blacks may still have jobs, but the ruling white minority will continue to become disproportionately wealthier. In South Africa, the trickle down theory is nowhere to be found. If more revenue is ascertained by a corporation benefitting from U.S. investments, these profits are not equitably distributed among the many poor employees, but horded by the 
white management. Furthermore, Solarz cor­rectly points out that "Like oppressed peoples everywhere, (the blacks) are surely willing to endure temporary economic setbacks to ac­hieve dignity and freedom." 
States have recognized the injustices precipitated as a result of their investments; 
both New Jersey and New York have passed legislation for div~stment. Countries have acknowledged the same fact; France and Sweden have divested from South Africa. Notre Dame, on the other hand, refuses to ac­c~pt responsibility for its behavior. Notre Dame even refuses to believe that what they are doing has any moral implications what­soever. Father Hesburgh clears his conscience by deploring, much like President Reagan does, the "repugnant" apartheid government; but he, the Board ofTrustees, and the United States government stubbornly refuse to prove "that we are committed by deed, as well as by word, to the elimination ofapartheid."

ND students should be aware of apartheid system 
This week is Apartheid Awareness Week at Notre Dame and it seems to be an appropriate time for a note ofexplanation. Members ofthc Anti-Apartheid Network have been distribut­ing information sheets and having petitions signed in the dining halls and have been some­what surprised few students arc aware ofwhat apartheid is and what significance it has for members of the Notre Dame community. I was personally disappointed with comments such as: "I like apartheid" or "Apartheid is good, why change it?" 
Patrick A. Mullin 
guest column 

Apartheid (pronounced a-par-tate) is a system of radically discriminatory laws which separate the white minority (pop. 24.2 million) and allow the whites to exercise political hegemony over the Republic of South Africa while denying the black population citizenship. 
Apartheid, after the accession to power of the Afrikaaner-controlled National Party in 194H, came to mean "separate development."This means the ultimate goal of the South African whites is to remove all blacks from South Africa and let them form their own. independent countries out ofwhat are now the black "homelands" (bantustans) that lie on the outskirts ofSouth Africa. 
What the whites obviously have in mind is maintaining control of the agriculturally and minerally rkh heartland of South Africa while leaving the blacks to take care of themselves in the wastelands that constitute the bantustans. "White areas" presently constitute H7 percent of South Africa, though the whites only represent 16 percent of the country's population. Massive population resettlements have taken place over the years; non-whites from "black spots" all over South Africa have been and continue to be deported from the areas in which they have lived for decades, in order to make room for new white commmunitics. 
Blacks arc loaded on government trucks with all their belongings anu taken to shanty towns in the bantustans. There, they find little or no economic vitality, yet the South African government expects them to be able to make a living for themselves. Poverty and its worst consequences, hunger and malnutrition arc widespread -especially among children · and the government provides little in the way of social services (besides a paltry monthly stipend) to improve conditions. Worst of all, the government intends to eventually make the bantustans independent countries thus relieving the whites of all their obligation to the blacks. 
But blacks are needed in white South Africa; they provide the bulk of the work force in industry, mining and urban services. They are the horse that pulls the carriage of South African industrialization and western-style prosperity. Without cheap, black labor, South Africans would not be able to reap the profits of one of the world's richest deposits of mineral wealth ( esp. gold and uranium). 
So, the white-controlled government has instituted what are known as 'influx control' laws that regulate the movement of blacks in and out of the 'white areas.' Blacks must find work within 72 hours or they will be subject to forced removal back to the bantustans. The greatest demand, of course, is for strong men to work in industry and mines. Thus women, 
children, and older people are  considered  
'superfluous  appendages'  and  forced  to  
remain in the bantustans.  

Men leave home for a year at a time · usually only coming home for Christmas-while wives and children are left to take care ofthemselves in the desolate 'homelands.' They often go for months without hearing or receiving any money from their husbands. 
All blacks are required to carry passbooks at all times and must present them upon demand. If they are caught without these passes, as hundreds ofthousands ofblacks are every year, they are thrown in jail for weeks at a time, often to the complete ignorance of their relatives. "Pass laws" have been the object ofa great deal ofprotest because ofthe categorization and dehumanization which they represent and help to implement. 
Apartheid's most basic mechanism for control and oppression is the exclusion of non-whites from a share of political power in South Africa. Despite the fact that for white South Africans public policy-making is carried out through a western-style, representative democratic, blacks are, and (until 1984) "coloreds" and Asians were denied the right to vote and be represented in the republic. 
When participation in political power is denied, groups that have been deprived of normal means of influencing political decision-making tend to turn to protests and demonstrations to express their opinions. The South ·African state, supponed by the police and military, has been quick to stifle dissent of this form by making political demonstrations against apartheid illegal, and by jailing -under the charges of "treason" and "communism" · those involved in such protests. 
Dissenters, especially the leaders of the numerous anti-apartheid movements (such as Nelson Mandela, Allan Boesak, Steve Biko, and -Beyers Naude ), have been subject to: banning, which restricts travel and contact with other people (to one at a time) and bars writing, appearance at public meetings, and contact with the media; detention without trial; torture; and death in prison ( 6'i people since 
1963). 
Other aspects of apartheid include dehumanizing laws similar to the "Jim Crow" 
P.O.BoxQ 
Joyce has served ND well in past 33 years 
Dear Editor: 
lbis is in response toJeff Griffin's assenions 
reKafding Father Joyce and his future hiring 
practices. Obviously. this student knows very 
little about the man and his many contribu­
tions to this university. 
Joyce has headed the faculty board in con­trol of athletics for 33 years. Notre Dame has amassed one ofthe most successful records in intercollegiate athletics, and a large percentage of their athletes graduate and ob­tain advanced degrees. Joyce also oversees the fiduciar matters of Notre Dame. He has held this responsibility during troubled times, that saw many colleges close and tuitions skyrocket. ReKafding his capabilities in han­dling his many duties, which may include hiring personnel for imponant university positions, Joyce's record is readily available and speaks for itself. What is often left silent, and smothered under letters such as Griffin's, is who the man Is. 
Joyce Is one of the most caring and Chris­tian individuals that I have ever met. Making such comments about a human being who is so totally and sincerely committed to this school and the student body amounts to slander in my opinion. He truly cares about the members of the Notre Dame community, and he does not deserve to be used as a scapegoat because a coach did not live up to the expectations of the fans. 
Griffin, if you are going to judge this man's capabilities in fulfilling his many respon­siblliities based upon four or five football seasons, then I think the only aspect of this issue that is attributable to high school is your mentality.

all Saint Mary's women The Observer·should be 
DearEditor: 
In response to Jean Rozum's editorial com­ment concerning the "interesting" conversa­tion between a Notre Dame woman and a Saint Mary's woman, we propose that the problem lies not within the minds of Saint Mary's women, but in the minds that take such casual comments and apply them to existing stereotypes. 
Perhaps Rozum's "creative" dialogue is fac­tual as she emphasizes, yet this husband­seeking woman that she depicts can obviously be found at any college campus across the country. It is disturbing that this conversation is made into such a major issue simply be­cause the one woman happens to be from Saint Mary's. 
Saint Mary's women do not need to be told where the "core" of our problem lies from a mere freshman who has been in the Saint Mary's-Notre Dame community for a few short months. We believe that IfRozum were to talk to a few upperclasswomen from both institutions, she would discover that most stu­
more careful with ads 
DearEditor: 
I am writing to inform you of my disgust with an advertisement which appeared in the Oct. 4 issue of The Observer. This panicular advenisement was on page 14 and occupied approximately two-thirds ofthe page. It's title was "IS Notre Dame Still Catholic?" and was apparently sponsored by Fidelity Magazine. I am disgusted with this advertisement and with The Observer's decision to print it be­cause it is sensational propaganda unfitting for a newspaper ofas high a caliber as The Obser­ver. Statements used in the ad such as "find out what happens to the babies after they go through the meat grinder and end up at Notre Dame" and "the research is going on right now in the shadow of the Golden Dome" are, simply put, cheap shots at Catholic emotions. 
My instincts tell me that this advertisement was intended to sell magazines and not to reform modern Catholic education at Notre laws which segregatec American blacks from whites. Racial intermarriage was until recently forbidden, and restaurants, rcstrooms and other public places are labeled "white only." 
Hopefully, members of the Notre Dame community will take advantage ofthe movies, lectures, and information tables on campus this week to inform themselves in more depth about apartheid and the effect it has of fellow humans in South Africa. The "Rally Against Apartheid," which will be held on the steps of the administration building this Friday at 4 p.m., will also provide an opponunity for expressing opposition to apartheid and solidarity with those who are standing up for the rights of non-whites in South Africa (this includes numerous whites). 
In addition to trying to Increase awareness, 
..

members of the Anti-Apartheid Network are raising the question ofwhether the University should withdraw its stock in companies that operate in South Africa or take some form of action to demonstrate that apartheid is incompatible with the christian values it seeks to propagate. Similar self-questioning has been going on in schools around the country. 
Disinvestment is an important issue because it presents a rare opportunity for us to take significant action on our (hopefully) shared beliefll in the rights ofall human beings as equal creations of God. For Notre Dame to come to a consensus which reflects the true feelings of all members of the community on the disinvestment question, everyone should inform themselves on the basic pros and cons. 
Take advantage ofthis week to learn more.

Dame or elsewhere; however, this point is 
basically moot. The fact remains that his ad· 
verisement is blatant propaganda. 
Whether the individual who wrote the 
"hard-hitting sequel" actually has evidence to 
the effect that Notre Dame is contributing to 
the unethical fetal experimentation is not the 
point, either. Even if he or she did possess 
such evidence, this advertisement would still 
be blatant propaganda. 
My complaint lies mainly with The Obser­
ver. Although one could cite the First Amend­
ment or the people's right to information in 
this instance, I would hope that The Observer 
would have too much self-respect to print 
such garbage, no matter what the advertise­
ment revenue might be.

ND community invited to join Friday's rally 
DearEditor: 

In light of the current crisis in Southern Africa and the evil nature of the apartheid sys­tem, we, along with 123 other signees of this letter, believe that Notre Dame should revise its investment policy towards that country. We invite the student body and faculty to par­ticipate massively in this Friday's 4 p.m. rally to be held at the steps of the Administration Building.

Women's Soccer Club wants .500 record, varsity status 
With fall break two weeks away, the Notre Dame Women's Soccer Club hopes to even out its fall out­door record with its final matches against Marquette University and Wheaton College. 
In this past weekend's match, the Irish beat 
Nazareth College, 2-0. The two scores were by 
junior Kerry Haverkamp and freshman Susan Haling. 
In discussing this season, Karen Moritz said that this year's team has been relying heavily on the freshmen players and that the freshmen bring new enthusiasm and competition to the team. 
"The amount oftime a player gets is based on the participation in practice," says Moritz. "Once someone joins, they are on the team and playing time is based on their attendence to practice." 
The team hopes that by reaching the .500 mark, it can achieve varsity status. 
"The enthusiasm for soccer is there," says Moritz. "And hopefully if we have a decent year, the ad­ministration will look into moving us up to varsity. 
"In reviewing this year, I would say that this year hasn't been that rewarding, because we just haven't played to our potential," says Moritz. "We have a lot of good individual players but we just couldn't gel together as a team. On the other hand, though, this year has been more fun because we have a lot more dedicated players and this causes a lot of compte­lion, which makes every player better." 

Tom Yoon 
Club Corner 

After the final match against Wheaton, when the weather gets much colder, the soccer team will move inside and has an indoor season in which it plays about I 5 games between November and February. 
WATER POLO: When the Notre Dame Water Polo team traveled to the Wisconsin Tournament last weekend, it went into the tournament with high hopes even though it was competing against teams in the Big Ten. 
The Irish came away with second place, beating Northwestern and Wisconsin by identical scores of ll-8, but losing to Ohio State in the finals. 
It was Notre Dame's second loss to Ohio State in two weeks. In the Loyola Tournament earlier this year, the Irish lost to the Buckeyes and eighth­ranked Loyola, while defeating Northwestern. 
"By getting second in the Wisconsin Tournament, our future for the regional tournament looks real good for next spring," says junior Steve Guenther.

The Blue Jays, who won 99 games this season, were just 24-26 against left-banders, and Howser hoped to take advantage of that.

Redskins with only 3:30 left to tie the Irish, 2-2. Regulation time and two 10-minute overtime periods then expired with no winner. 
The Redskins started the scoring for the day when Ron Deger put one past Notre Dame goalkeeper Hugh Breslin at 23:45. The Irish came back, however, and six minutes later, co-captain Chris Telk evened the score at one. 
Telk was playing in his first game after missing four contests with a knee injury suffered against Mic­higan State on Sept. 20. He has two goals and one assist this season. 
In the second half, Sternberg got his third goal ofthe season to put the Irish on top at 79:44. Notre Dame then held offthe Redskins until Slus­her got his goal. 

The Irish outshot their op­ponents, 19-9. Breslin was forced to make six saves, as was his Miami counterpart, Eric Whittnable. 
On Saturday, the Irish were forced into a hole immediately by Wright State, as Hylton Dayes scored for the tournament's hosts only 28 seconds into the match. The Raiders then went up by two goals eight minutes later on another goal by Dayes before the Irish could recover from his first attack. 
The rest of the scoring belonged to Notre Dame, as the Irish came back for a 4-2 victory. Marvin Lett got the ball rolling with a goal at 9:14, and Miles tied the game with his shot at 18: 11. Mark Bidinger tallied before the first half was out, and Bruce McCourt added a point to the Irish total in the second period. 
Breslin made six saves on 11 shots, while Raider goalkeeper Mike Kolschetzky stopped two of l 5 Irish shots on goal.

game. The coach did comment, though, that the volleyball team needs to adapt better to the op­ponent's game plan. 
"We seem to have trouble playing slow teams," said Lambert. "We need to adapt better to this because most of the teams in our league are slow teams." 
St. Francis went on to beat Saint Mary's in the second match, 12-15, 15·5, and 15-12. Sophomore Kara Tekulve of Indianapolis led the. Belles in serve attempts with seven, as did Feldman, a freshman from Naperville, Ill. Reidy, a 5-9 inch junior from Lake Bluff, Ill., had five kills. Mergens, a sophomore from Chicago, had 27 assists. 

In the second game, Suth led the Belles with nine pass attempts, with only one error. Feldman had three kills, while Mergens had 21 assists. 
Mergens paced· the Belles with nine perfect serve attempts and 31 assists in the third game. Feldman led in kills with four.

Farley still has undefeated record in women's interhall flag football 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 
The lean, green Farley flag football 
team was driven to the precipice of 
defeat on the turf of Cartier Field 
Sunday evening, but like so many 
games before this, Farley was able to 
come out on the winning end of a 
20-14 score over Pasquerilla West. 
Farley, now 5·0, scored first, aided by a long jaunt down to the three· yard line off of a fourth-and-six op· tion play. The extra point attempt failed and with eight minutes remaining Farley led, 6-0. 
PW however, did not waste any time in its comeback. With two minutes left, PW's lightning running back, Nancy Evans, scorched 45 yards down the sidelines to tie the score at six. PW's point-after attempt failed and the halfended in a tie. 
Farley regained the lead on the first play ofthe second half when its superb quarterback, Marilu Almeida, threw a perfect 60-yard touchdown pass. Farley then ran the option for two points and led, 14-6. 
Evans, once again busted loose in the open field, however, rambling i3 yards on a fourth-and-three play to make it 14-12. The two-point con· version was good and the score was tied once again at 14. 

Farley took the lead for keeps with 
4:04 remammg when Almeida tossed a 20-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was no good, however, and PW took possession 
with four  minutes left trailing by  
only six.  
In  the  final  minute,  with  no  

timeouts remaining, PW completed a 55-yard pass down to the Farley three. Before they could run another play, however, the time expired, and Farley had a hard-fought 20-14 vic­tory. 
Earlier Sunday evening, Pasquerilla East, the only other un­defeated team, aided by the arm of quarterback Colleen Donnelly, defeated Lyons, 22-14. 
PE scored on a three-yard touch· down pass to take an early 6-0 lead. The conversion was good, and PE led,8-0. With two minutes remaining, Lyons' quick running back, Robin M~Hugh, rambled the last 30 yards of a 35· yard option pass touchdown to bring the score to 8-6. With 1:20 remaining in the first 
half, PE scored again, this time on a long bomb to take a 16-6 advantage. 
Early in the second half, PE put the game away on a 30-yard touchdown pass from Donnelly that opened a commanding 22·6lead. 
With five-and-a-half minutes left, 
Lyons closed the gap to 22-14, but it 
was too little too late as PE picked up 
its fifth win ofthe year, 22-14. 
In the other game Sunday, Lewis was able to pick up its first win ofthe year, but it took five overtimes to do it. The final was lewis 24, Walsh 18. 
Results from Thursday's action saw PW nip Lyons, 18-14, Farley trounce Badin, 21·0, and Breen Phil· lips edge Lewis, 6-0. 
In last night's action, BP crushed Badin, 22-0, to raise its record to 3-2, and Farley dealt PE its first defeat, 14-0. In the process, Farley upped its record to a perfect 6-0. 
Tomorrow, Lewis ( 1-4) will play Badin (0·5), BP will meet PW (3·2) and Walsh ( 1·4) will confront Lyons (2·3). 
The final slate of regular season games will be played Sunday. These contests feature PW against Badin, BP vs. PE, Farley vs. Walsh, and Lyons against Lewis. All games are played on Cartier Field.

The Notre Dame soccer team will be looking for its first home win today when the Irish play host to the Marquette Warriors at 3 p.m. on Alumni Field. 
The Irish, 3·i ·3 after a win and a tie at the Wright State Tournament in Dayton, Ohio, last weekend, have a 0·3· 2 record in home games. The Warriors are 9-3 overall. 
Notre Dame has been playing well, lately, according to Head Coach Dennis Grace, so the team's record may be deceiving. But last season, the Warriors ran over an Irish team that finished the year at 12-6-2. Marquette took the Irish, 4­
1, in a homecoming match in Mil· waukee. 
The Warriors have a lot of 
strength returning this season, too, 
since their top three scorers from 
1984 still are playing. 
The team is led this season byJose Itarte, a senior co-captain from San Sebastian, Spain. Itarte has 11 goals and seven assists so far. The other co-captain for the Warriors is senior James Tutaj, who recorded two goals and one assist against the Irish last year. 
Other scoring leaders for Mar· quette are sophomore Todd Fitch (eight goals, three assists) and junior Tom Comiskey (six goals, three as­sists). 

Topping the scoring chart for Notre Dame is freshman Tom Ger-


Iacher, who has three goals and four assists. Freshman Joe Sternberg has added three goals and three assists, and senior tri-captain Dave Miles has been credited with two goals and three assists. 
Today's game will be the last home contest for Notre Dame until Oct. 30. 
The Irish have played in several close contests this season against

ByPHnWOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 

Law student Paul Matousek ran six miles in 31:59 last Saturday to win the 1985 Domer Run. 
Approximately 180 runners participated in the three· and six-mile runs sponsored by the Office of Non-Varsity Athletics. About 220 runners ran in last fall's races. 
Freshman Matt Laboe finished the three-mile course in 16:21 to take the crown in that event. Classmate Edwin Quinn came in third in 1 i:39, while junior Dave Hipp was second in 17:05. 
Sophomore Tom Shallow was the first undergraduate across the line in the six-mile event. His 35:24 was good enough for third place overall. Law student Robert Cessar was second in 32:58. 
The top female finishers in the six-mile event were juniors Maureen McKenna and Coleen Donnelly, who won the women's

Blue ,Jays beat Royals, 6-1, behind Stieb's solid pitching performance 
TORONTO · Dave Stieb held Kansas City to three hits through eight innings and the Toronto Blue Jays, showcasing the blend that brought them their first-ever divi· sion title, beat the Royals 6-1 last night in the first game of the American League playoffs. 
The Blue Jays, the AL East cham· pions in just their ninth season, scored all their runs in the first four innings and finished with 11 hits in the first AL postseason game outside the United States. 
The loss in the opener ofthe best· of-seven series saddled Kansas City Manager Dick Howser with an 0-10 record in the postseason as his Royals crumbled under the Blue Jays' early mix of speed, power and agressiveness. 
Stieb shut out the Royals through eight innings. Tom Henke, the Jays' surprise bullpen star this season, gave up two hits to lead offthe ninth, and Willie Wilson scored the lone Kansas City run on a fielder's choice. 
The game featured the two start· ing pitchers who led the league in earned run average. But while the top-ranked Stieb, with a 2.48 ERA, looked every bit the part, the Blue Jays ripped Charlie Leibrandt and sent him to his earliest exit of the season. 
Stieb, whose lack of run support during the season produced a mis· leading 14-13 record, gave up a two· out double to George Brett in the first inning and a one-out single by Brett in fourth. A pinch-hit double by Dane Iorg in the eighth ended a streak a 12 straight batters retired by Stieb. 
Stieb allowed only one other run­ner, a walk to Pat Sheridan in the fourth, and struck out eight. The hard-throwing Stieb fanned eight different Royals, all except Sheridan, before Henke came in to pitch the ninth. 
The only troublespot for Stieb, in fact, carne while he was warming to start the second, when a young woman bolted out of the right-field seats, ran to the mound and hugged the startled pitcher. Stieb did not seem shaken, and pitched a l-2-3 in­ning. 
Leibrandt, meanwhile, lasted just two fuU innings and was driven from the mound in third with the bases loaded and no outs. The Blue Jays, who were 0-2 against Leibrandt during the season, ripped the 1i · game winner for five runs on seven hits. 
Game 2 is scheduled for this after­noon, with Kansas City lefty Bud Black, 1 0·1 5 during the regular season, facingJimmy Key, 14-6. 
Alot ofthe pregame attention was devoted to Howser's plan to pitch left-banders against Toronto, and the weather. Neither got in the Blue Jays' way. 
Game time temperature was 63 degrees · balmy for this city · and the winds that usually whip off Lake On· tario at Exhibition Stadium were mild. There was a little bit of rain during the player introductions, and a very light sprinkle in the third in·
