Saint Mary's searches for new VPs 
Incandela, Tiefenthaler engage with students, faculty, administrators in forums 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Edirqr 
As two of the top three Saint Mary's administrators prepare to step down from their positions this spring -marking a new era at the College -students and faculty have the opportunity to meet two candidates vying for the position of vice president and dean of faculty at open forums this week. 
Saint Mary's religious studies professor Joe lncandela and Dean of the Faculty at Colgate University Jill Tiefenthaler, a Saint Mary's alumna, will partici­pate in two open forums today and Thursday, as well as closed sessions specifically for faculty members. 
The candidate visits are part of a broader search to fill the vacancies soon to be left in the heart of the adminis­tration by current Vice President and Dean of Faculty Pat White and Vice President of Student Affairs Linda Timm -a gap that will give College President Carol Ann Mooney significant shaping power over the school's future. 


The search began when White announced on Jan. 28 that he 


was leaving the College to head Wabash College in Crawford­sville, Ind. 
T h i s announce­ment occur­red only days 
Timm after Timm 
announced she would leave Saint Mary's to serve as president of Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, WIS. 
The vacancies left by Timm and White's departure will be filled prior to the start of the 2006-07 school year, said Mooney, who hopes to name the vice president and dean of faculty before the conclusion of the spring semester. 
Although the specifics regard­ing the search for the vice presi­dent of student affairs have yet to be publicly released, Mooney, the search committee chair, said she plans to fill the position before August.

Runners prepare for Holy Half 

By KATIE PERRY Assistant News Editor 
Nearly 400 runners will participate in the second annual Holy Half Marathon this Sunday in a race spanning 13.1 miles -that's 52.4 laps around a regulation track, more than 192 treks across Notre Dame's famed foot­ball field or the length of 138,336 LaFortune quar­ter dogs. 
"We have four times as many entries this year than we did last year," race coordinator Kathleen Coverick said. "I think that ND kids love a challenge -and this race definitely gives them something to go after." 
Coverick said most of the 383 entries are students, however Notre Dame fac­ulty and staff members ­as well as other local run­ning aficionados -will also lace up their sneakers for Sunday's race. 

Proceeds from the Holy Half's $12 entry fee will benefit Catholic Charities' Operation Helping Hands in New Orleans -a group that provides relief servic­es to people who have incurred heavy losses in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, namely the elder­ly and uninsured. 
Coverick said the event has already raised approx­imately $1,300-in addi­tion to the heart rates of those training for the physically demanding

Duerson sentenced for battery 
Former ND trustee, football captain fined 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
Former Irish football cap­tain Dave Duerson, who resigned from the University Board of Trustees last February, was sentenced Monday on a misdemeanor 
charge of domestic battery that took place I a s t February on the Notre Dame cam­pus. 
St. Joseph 


C o u n t y Duerson Superior Court Magistrate Richard McCormick ordered Duerson, 45, to pay a fine of $950 plus court costs in addition to a· $50 state-required fee. He will not face any jail time or probation. 
Duerson was charged with two counts of battery and two counts of domestic battery in February 2005 after he pushed his wife, Alicia, out the door and into a wall out­side their hotel room at the Morris Inn, police said. The couple, from Highland Park. Ill., was on campus for the winter Board of Trustees meeting. 
On Jan. 17, Duerson plead­ed guilty to the domestic bat­tery charge in exchange for the dismissal of three other

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Leaders urge further input from members 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL 
News Writer 
Only three days into their new positions, members of the Council of Representatives (COR) focused on establishing goals for the upcoming year at the group's meeting Monday night. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell urged COR members to bring issues to her atten­tion as they settle into their roles. 
"We set the agenda for COR," Shappell said. 
COR serves as a cabinet for Shappell. The Student Union Constitution defines the group as "the venue for leaders of student organizations to meet and advise the student body president." 
Student body vice president Bill Andrichik echoed Shappell's call for input. 
"[COR] is especially useful for groups like CCC (Club Coordination Council) and HPC (Hall Presidents Council), typical programming bodies," Andrichik said. "This gives you your policy voice."

Mouth grills become hot and flashy new trend 
CLEVELAND -The hip­hop culture is sinking its teeth into a new fashion trend. Individual gold­capped teeth have given way to grills and fronts ­removable mouthpieces made of gold, platinum or silver and sometimes stud­ded with jewels. 
The trend has been boosted by hip-hop icons such as Nelly and rappers like Paul Wall. 
After Nelly's 2005 hit "Grillz," which glorifies the trend, young people all over scrambled to wrap their chops around a shiny grill. 

Jacob Owens, a 17 -year­old South High School stu­dent, snagged a diamond­studded silver grill a cou­ple of months ago for $200. 
"Everybody is getting grills," Owens said while hanging out at the food court at Tower City. He chose silver to set himself apart. 
Owens sheds his grill to eat and at bedtime, but wears it for hours at a time to match his earrings.

More than 400 mathemati­.cians will gather at the Notre Dame Saturday and Sunday for the 2006 Spring Central 
Sectional Meeting  of  the  
American  Mathemat ical  
Society.  

A conference highlight is the 2006 Erdos Memorial Lecture, "Inhomogeneous Random Graphs," by Bela Bolloblis, professor at the University of Memphis and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, at 5:10 
p.m. Saturday in Room 101 DeBartolo Hall. The lecture is free and open to the public. 
The Erdos lecture is an annual invited address made possible by a fund created by Andrew Beal, a Dallas banker and mathematics enthusiast. The lecture is named for the late, prolific mathematician Paul Erdos, who published more than 1,500 papers and developed the theory of ran­dom graphs. 
A random graph is a collec­tion of points, called vertices, in which some or all of the points are connected by line segments, called edges. Graphs can be used to model networks such as the World Wide Web (in which Web pages are the vertices and links between pages are the edges) and social interactions (in which people are the ver­tices and edges connect people who know each other). In one interesting graph, the vertices correspond to movie stars and two vertices are connected by an edge if the stars involved have worked together on a film. The graph is the basis for the trivia game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon." 
Bollobas' lecture concerns graphs in which, for each pair of vertices, whether an edge is drawn between them is decid­ed at random. These random decisions are made in such a way that there can be a wide variation in the number of edges that come out of the dif­ferent vertices in a graph Gust as there can be a wide varia­tion in the number of links to a given Web page or in the size of a given person's social network). The study of ran­dom graphs has led to many interesting discoveries about the properties of graphs in general.

University n1edalist passes on 
Special to The Observer 
Mary Elizabeth Carney of Lake Forest. Ill.. a recipient of thn University's Laetare Medal, died Sunday. 
A Notrn Dame benefactor and the wife of Thomas P. Carney, 1937 Notrn Dame alumnus and chairman emeritus of the Notre Dame Board ol' Trustees, Mrs. Carney, a native of Indianapolis, had suffered a stroke three years ago. 
In addition to her contribu­tions to the University, Mrs. Carney was aetive in numerous community service organiza­tions. She. served as president of the Saint Mary's Mother's Club, of the League of Women Voters of Lake Forest, the Lake County League, the Lake Forest-Lake Bluff Community Associates of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Lake Bluff Garden Club. She also served as secretary of the Lake Forest Caucus and as a member of the Gordon Community Center Board. The Carneys were awarded Notre Dame's highest honor, the Laetare Medal, in 1986. 
Mary E. McGuire and Thomas 

P. Carney were married Oet. 3, 1942, and years later she con­fessed that she could not imag­ine not being married to him. In a 1991 Chicago Tribune arti­cle, the late Msgr. Jack Egan, a friend of the Carneys, spoke of the couple's conspicuous love after half a century of mar­riage. 
"I always felt (Thomas) treat­ed her as a beautiful woman he was courting and hoped he would be able to marry," he said. "That gentle considera­tion for her, as if Tom didn't have any task more important than being her husband." 
Survivors include her hus­band and four children, all Notre Dame graduates. Thomas Jr., ('67) of Lake Forest, Ill.;' Sheila Hopkins ('74) of Hingham, Mass; James ('75) of Brooklyn Park, Minn; and Janet O'Brien ('77) of Glenview, Ill.

race. 
Senior Tim Stawicki prepped for the Holy Half with the help of a routine he found in Runner's World magazine that includes "some sprints, some fast[er] medium distance runs and the ever-important long run." 
"I've been training officially for about six weeks," he said. "But you could say that I've been training for the past two thousand plus days since I [first] started running." 
Stawicki completed his first marathon in Dublin during the fall of 2004 and went on to com­rience. 

"I have actually never run a half marathon, having jumped directly from the 1 OK to the full marathon in terms of racing," he said. 
Senior James Ehlinger said Sunday's race would be "a good first step" towards his ultimate goal of running a full marathon. 
"I wanted to force myself into better shape," he said. 
Ehlinger followed a nine-week training regimen that included a combination of long runs, speed work and cross training. Though he did not completely "stick to the schedule," Ehlinger said he still feels prepared for the race. 
forward to completing the Holy Half for my own personal achievement." 
Stawicki said he was unable to run the Holy Half last year, and "just had to sign up" for this year's race. 
"Personally, it was a way to get started training for some more marathons without the hassle of having to devote three hours on Sunday to running 20 miles," he said. "This involves a significant decrease in time devotion -about half as much, ironically." 
The 13.1 mile course follows two loops around the Notre Dame campus and is modeled off last year's route -which GPS watch to try to make it as accurate as possible this year," she said. 
The race will begin at 10 a.m. between South Dining Hall and Welsh Family Hall. Coverick said those still interested in running the Holy Half can register via e­mail at holyhalf@gmail.com or beginning at 8:30a.m. Sunday. 
The event is co-sponsored by the Notre Dame Women's Running Club, Circle K, the Class of 2008 and the Class of 2006. Coverick said a Council of Representatives grant would also help cover expenses.

Australia to sell uranium to China 
CANBERRA -Australia agreed Monday to sell China uranium for nuclear power stations despite concerns that Beijing could divert the material to atomic weapons. 
The countries' foreign ministers signed two agreements containing assurances that China will not build bombs with uranium from Australia, which has 40 percent of the world's known deposits. No official estimates were available Monday but the deal is expected to generate billions of dollars in annual sales. 
"These agreements establish strict safe­guards, arrangements and conditions to ensure Australian uranium supplied to China, and any collaborative programs in applica­tions of nuclear technology, is used exclusively for peaceful purposes," said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.

Only simpler tissues -skin, bone, and cartilage -have been lab-grown and trans­planted in the past. This is the first time that a more intricate organ has been mostly replaced with tissue grown from the patient's own cells. 
"This suggests that tissue engineering may one day be a solution to the shortage of donor organs in this country for those need­ing transplants," said Dr. Anthony Atala, the lead researcher. l-Ie said he believes the work provides a model for growing other tissues and organs.

SIERRA LEONE 

Taylor accused of war cri~es 
Ex-president ofLiberia pleads not guilty to 11 brutal offenses amongst hostile crowds 
Associated Press 
FREETOWN -Former Liberian President Charles Taylor pleaded not guilty Monday before an interna­tional war crimes tribunal. denying 11 counts of help­ing destabilize West Africa through killings, sexual slavery and sending chil­dren into combat. 
Taylor at first told the court he could not enter a plea because he did not recognize its right to try him. 
But after Justice Richard Lussick insisted, Taylor said calmly and slowly: "Most definitely, your honor, I did not and could not have committed those acts against the sister republic of Sierra Leone." 
Lussick accepted that as a not guilty plea and instructed aides to set a start date for the trial. 
However, Lussick did not say where the next hear­ing might be held. 
As the hourlong hearing ended, Taylor stood, smiled and blew kisses to relatives who were in the courtroom. 
Although Taylor made his first court appearance in Sierra Leone, Special Court officials have requested that an interna­tional court in The Hague, Netherlands, host the trial. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has expressed fear that Taylor supporters could use the. trial as an excuse to mouot another insurgency in her country. 
Taylor said through his lawyer that he feared for his safety in Sierra Leone but wanted to be tried in the region, in part because it would be easier for defense witnesses to appear here. The court's chief prosecutor has said Taylor has no reason to fear for his safety. 
Desmond de Silva, chief prosecutor of the inde­pendent, U.N.-backed war crimes court trying Taylor, 


has dismissed such con­cerns. 
Taylor is the first former African president to face war crimes charges. He was brought to Sierra Leone last week after briefly escaping custody in Nigeria, where he was staying since 2003 under a deal to end Liberia's civil war. 
Security was tight at the court, with bulletproof glass and dozens of U.N. peacekeepers from Mongolia·and Ireland pro­tecting Taylor and officials 
who  received  death  
threats.  
Taylor  showed  little  

emotion as a court official, Krystal Thompson of the United States, read the indictment. l-Ie sat at a table, wearing headphones and flanked by two securi­ty officers. When the offi­cial read "murder, a crime against humanity," he laced his fingers on the table before him. 
More than 100 people, including Taylor relatives and Liberia's ambassador, were in the courtroom. Most reporters watched on closed circuit TV from elsewhere in the complex. 
Taylor was represented by a court-appointed lawyer, Vincent Nmehielle of Nigeria, because his own lawyers had not com­pleted proeedures neces­sary to appear before the court. 
Taylor met with his 
lawyers for the first time Monday morning shortly before his court appear­ance. Two lawyers from Liberia and two from Ghana "gave him our advice and he will consid­er it. We consider our mis­sion accomplished," said Kofi Akainyah, a Ghanian member of the team. 
Many were suspicious when Nigeria's govern­ment announced Taylor's disappearance last week, just days after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo reluctantly agreed to hand him over from the exile haven he had been offered under an internationally brokered peace agreement ending Liberia's 14-year civil war. 
9/11 conspirator could face death 
Associated Press 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -Afederal jury found al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui eligible Monday to be executed, deciding that his lies to FBI agents led directly to at least one death in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
The only person to face charges in this country in the nation's worst ter­rorist assault, Moussaoui now faces a second phase of his sentencing trial to determine if he actually will be put to death. That phase is to begin Thursday morning. 
Moussaoui sat in his chair and prayed silently as the verdict was 

read. He was asked to stand but refused. "You'll never get my blood, God curse you all," he said afterward. 
The nine men and three women of the jury will hear testimony on whether the 37 -year-old Frenchman, who was in jail at the time of the attack, deserves to be executed for his role. 
The testimony will include families of 9/11 victims who will describe the human impact of the al-Qaida mis­sion that flew four jetliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsyfvania field. 
Court-appointed defense lawyers, whom Moussaoui has tried to reject, will summon experts to suggest he is schizophrenic after an impoverished childhood during which he faced racism in France over his Moroccan ancestry. 
"By this verdict, the jury has found that death is a possible sentence in this case," court spokesman Ed Adams said. 
On the key question before the jurors, they answered yes on whether at least one victim died Sept. 11 as a direct result of Moussaoui's actions. 
Had the jury voted against his eli­gibility for the death penalty, Moussaoui would have been sen­tenced to life in prison.

Scandal-plagued Republican DeLay intends to resign 
Former House majority leader expected to step down in May or June, will not run for re-election

WASIIINGTON -Former

bying scandal that ensnared 
sonw of' his f'ornwr top aides and 
cost tlw Hepublican his leader­

to Congress and intends to 
resign, Hepublkan oflieials said 
Monday. 
Tlwy said DPLay would leave 
his seat in May or .June. 
It was not dear whether or

name from tlw November ballot, 
but if' lw did, party officials 
would presumably be able to 
select a replaeenwnt who could 
then run against Democratic 
nomirwe Niek Lampson. 
Also undear is exactly when 
DeLay reached his decision, but 
one official said the congress­
man began informing dose asso­
ciates late last week. That was 
around the same time as a see­
ond former DeLay aide, Tony 
Hudy, pleaded guilty in a federal 
corruption investigation that has 
reached into DeLay's oflice. 
DeLay was expected to dis­
close his plans Tuesday at a 
news conference in llouston,

"lle'll wsign," a limner senior

In an interview with The 
Galveston County Daily News in 
Texas. DeLay said his decision 
was based partly on troubling 
internal polling rnsults, inducting 
a poll taken after the March 
Hepublkan primary that showed 
him narrowly ahead of' 
Lampson. 
"Hven though I thought l could win, it was a little too risky," DeLay told the Galveston pap1~r. 
Tho congressman told Tirnn magazine Monday that he plans to make his Virginia condomini­um his primary residence. "I 1:an do more on tlw outside of' the II ousn than l can on the inside right now. I want to eontinuo to light for the conservative causn. I want to continuo to work for a Hnpubliean majority." I>nLay told thn magazinn for its onlinn nd i­lion.

IN BRIEF 
Duke Energy expands into Midwest 
CHARLOTTE -In a deal that creates one of the nation's largest utilities, Duke Energy Corp. on Monday closed its $9 billion acquisition of Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp., the company said. 
"The merger positions Duke Energy to meet future energy challenges and to grow," Paul M. Anderson, chairman of the board and formerly chief executive officer for Duke Energy, said in a statement. 
Last May, Duke Energy agreed to pay $9 billion for Cinergy, forming a company with about 5.4 million customers and $70 billion in assets. 
Cinergy Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers becomes the new chief executive officer and Anderson will retain his title as chairman. 
Duke Energy and Cinergy shareholders over­whelmingly approved the acquisition in early March. 
The North Carolina Utilities Commission approved the deal last month to remove one of the final regulatory hurdles. The commission also placed more than 70 conditions on the com­pany, including a requirement that Charlotte­based Duke Energy give North Carolina cus­tomers a $117.5 million across-the-board cut in their electricity bills for one year. 
Market climbs despite late selling 
NEW YORK -A late-day selloff left stocks mixed Monday as investors put aside their enthusiasm over acquisitions and evidence of a moderating economy and cashed in profits from an early advance. 
Reporlo; showing an unexpected slowdown in manufacturing growth and an upswing in con­struction spending fed optimism about the economy's health and a possible end to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. The early buying sent the Dow Jones industrials up 138 points and had the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes near multiyear highs. 
The market's momentum waned late in the day as nervous investors chose to play it safe and take money out ofstocks and bonds. 
The mixed economic news nonetheless showed that the economy, while tapering, con­tinues to move forwar-d at a healthy pace, said Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan, Beck & Co.

Pentagon releases transcripts 
Associated Press 
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE -In 2, 733 pages of declassified documents released Monday to The Associated Press, men accused of helping terrorist groups or Afghanistan's former Taliban regime pleaded for freedom while U.S. military officers often painstakingly tried .to find holes in their stories. 
The previously classified transcripts were the second batch of Guantanamo Bay detainee hearings released by the Pentagon in response to a lawsuit by the AP. They identi­fied more of the prisoners who have been secretly held without charges for up to four years while the U.S. military deter­mines how dangerous they may be. 
Most of the men said they were innocent and would pose no threat if set free. 
"My conscience is clear," said Algerian detainee Mohamed Nechla, who was accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia. "If I left this place my only concern would be bread on the table for my wife and children." 
Zia Ul Shah, a Pakistani accused of being a driver for the Taliban, said he hated his American captors at first but his feelings softened after he learned about the Sept. 11 ter­rorist attacks. 
"In the beginning I did not like Americans at all," Shah said. "I had never seen Americans. In the beginning when I came here the interro­gations were tough and I start­ed hating them more, but then ... someone showed me pictures

Egeland had been scheduled to visit southern and western Sudan from Sunday to Thursday to assess relief operations. Instead, he went to southern Sudan, which has an autonomous government.

The U.S. State Department criticized Sudan's refusal to per­mit Egeland's visit, calling the decision "deeply disturbing." 
Citing the "crying humanitari­an needs" in Darfur, spokesman Adam Ereli said it was hard to understand why Sudan rebuffed Egeland. 
"This certainly sends the wrong signal about where the government of Sudan stands on the issue of humanitarian relief in cooperation with the interna­tional community to address the problem of Darfur," he said. 
Egeland noted that he had been barred from visiting Darfur in 2004 "when ethnic cleansing was at its worst." 
The United Nations has described Darfur as the site of the world's gravest humanitari­an crisis. The 3-year-old conflict setting the Arab-dominated gov­ernment and militias against ethnic African tribes has left some 180,000 dead -most from disease and hunger -and displaced another 2 million from their homes. Sudan's govern­ment and rebels in Darfur have made little headway in peace talks in Ahuja, Nigeria.

Don't blame me 
I probably should not write this article. I should probably take a moment, calmly collect my thoughts and speak more soft­ly. But how many other libertarian­themed articles do you read? If you are a libertarian, you prob­ably read a bunch. If you are not, however, this one is probably it. 
So in the wake of the Senate's recent vote to raise the ceil­ing on U.S. borrowing authority to $8.965 trillion (an increase of $781 billion from last year) I have to say something loudly. 
I cannot take it any­more. 
The vote passed the Senate along most­ly party lines, 58-42. The legislation was the fourth time since 2002 that the gov­cmmcmt needed to borrow more money than allowed so as to again avoid default­ing on the federal debt. Now, according to the Congressional Budget Oflice, American taxpayers will be shelling out $217 billion this year on the interest accumulating on Washington's loans alone. 
Now, I am no fan of Bill Clinton and his sneaky rhetoric about a "budget surplus" (ima!-,Tine, if you will, paying $20 for a gal­lon of milk, and instead of giving you change, the cashier excitedly proclaims he now has a "budget surplus"-if that's a surplus, I'm Batman), but what has happnned in the last six years? Does any­one out there besides me care that the Bush Administration's fiscally irresponsi­ble behavior is abhorrent? Reprehensible? Atrocious? 
And, the truth is, I blame you. 
Libertarians are very keen on the notion of personal responsibility. As a lib­ertarian, I see politics as the following choice: more government or more liberty. 

Scott 
Wagner 
Live and Let Live or Die 

The problem is, when you consistently choose more government, it equals less liberty for me. You do not vote in a vacu­um. Voting is exercising political force; it is a form of' violence, like it or not, and my grandchildren will be paying for your irresponsibility. 
Today, the United States proudly claim (yes, that verb is plural) almost half of the world's military expenditures. In 20 years, Medicare will consume nearly 40 percent of our nation's GDP (not federal budget, GDP). Our country is the world's most powerful "superdebtor." Does it truly matter how quickly we can destroy Saddam Hussein's country when our "leaders" have sold so many Treasury bonds to China? 
Debtors used to be thrown in jail when they could not pay for their poor choices. If debtors' prison still existed, there would be no one lel\ in Washington and I would be a happy man. However, instead of throwing them in jail, we are giving them permission to take more and more money that they have no intention of repaying. With reelection rates as high as they are, politicians feel far too safe in the hal­lowed halls of Congress. They do not fear their constituents anymore. 
I am tired of the bickering between the wings of the Republierat Party. I saw a poster in O'Shaughnessy that asked for grassroots volunteers to light the extreme right wing and elect progressives into office. Because, obviously, once we kick the irresponsible, big-government imperi­alists out of' office, the world will be better with the irresponsible, big-government socialists who will happily replace them. 
Dear liberals and conservatives: Please stop fighting. You are both to blame for this mess. Bill Clinton killed plenty of civilians in Iraq during his reign, and under George W. Bush, federal spending on education has increased by 70 per­cent. Please cease the rhetoric, the apolo­getics, the spin. It is time to take responsi­bility for your politicians. I am tired of' them, their lies and the fact that you keep voting for them. 
I am not going to commit the sin of claiming outright that most Americans are capital-L Libertarians. However, I do believe that most Americans do not want "progressives" in Washington. Most Americans do not want imperialism, or foreign nation-building or more socialism. On a broad seale, we historically distrust our smiling leaders -and with good cause. I am convinced that most Americans want peace, freedom and to be left alone; and while the majority of Americans may or may not be Libertarians, those sentiments themselves are strikingly libertarian. 
Remember, politicians do not seek oflice simply to represent the voice of the voice­less. Leo Tolstoy wrote: "In order to get power and retain it. it is necessary to love power; but love of' power is not connected with goodness but with qualities that aw the opposite of' goodness, sueh as pride, cunning, and cruelty." Unfortunately, the people best suited to lead a nation are those who do not want the job. 
I am not proposing some sort of cure-all solution, because one does not exist. I am simply asking-well, demanding-that you respect the choice that you have: more government or more liberty. Considering Novel Laureate Friedrich Hayek's wise words that "in government, the scum rises to the top," I ask you to be very, very wary. 
The hand that fi~eds you can just as eas­ily strangle you to death, and, if !-,Tiven the chance, it will.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Keep the coach, build the program 
This letter is concerning the decision to not renew Steve Bender's contract as head basketball coach at Saint Mary's. The decision to not renew his con­tract has come as a great shock to many people inside and outside of the Saint Mary's community. The basketball program has had its ups and downs (more downs than ups) in the past years on and off the court, but this year was dif­ferent. The team was happy and competitive; it had its best season record­wise and was positive about last season and the upcoming one. The program finally had a strong foundation to build on. I am by no means implying that Bender was the single factor in the above successes, but he was a factor that strongly impacted those successes. He was -and still is-committed to his team as well as his assistant coaches even though the athletic department chose to not renew his contract. 
Saint Mary's athletic department has a "revolving door" for coaches. A coaching position at Saint Mary's is only offered as a part time position which does give some reasoning why the department cannot keep coaches. This does not apply to why Bender's contract was not renewed -he is a teacher and does not need another full-time job. It seems a coach is also never guaranteed any more than a one year contract. If this is the case, this allows the athletic department to cut the coach after one season. If the athletic department has a hard time keeping coaches because of this reason, why would it not renew the contract for one who created so much success for the basketball program? 
Support the canned food drive 
I want to thank all of those people who have volunteered to take part in Notre Dame's second annual Canned Food Drive this Saturday. I thank you for your support in advance because I appreciate the fact that you realize the importance of this effort. You realize how much of an impact this campus-wide collection has on those families genuinely lacking the necessities of life right here in Northern Indiana. 
According to the Northern Indiana Food Bank Web site, more than 118,000 Indiana families live in poverty and are therefore at risk of hunger. Last year, in our first annual campus-wide Canned Food Drive, 6,500 pounds of food were collected for the Northern Indiana Food Bank, setting the first benchmark for the event. This year, with your help, we expect to surpass 10,000 pounds of food, a substantial contribution to the Northern Indiana Food Bank. 
The Canned Food Drive will be taking place from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. outside of Stepan Center this Saturday. Volunteers will work two-hour shifts in which they will drive out into the neighborhoods of the community to collect cans door-to-door. WVFI will be DJing the event as groups return to campus to drop off their collected food. At the conclusion of the Canned Food Drive, University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh will say a blessing over the collected food. Last year, I participated, and it was a very rewarding experience. The community appreciates our efforts to fight hunger in Northern Indiana, and if you come out on Saturday, you will see for yourself just how much two hours of your time can positively impact the lives of so many people. Thanks again to those who have already volunteered to come out Saturday. If you haven't signed up and are still interested, contact your dorm service commissioner as soon as possible or e-mail jcorker@nd.edu.

How can any sport build a program if it keeps getting new coaches? Why would the Saint Mary's athletic department not want to renew the contract of a coach who has led a team with the best record it has ever had, stayed posi­tive, created a strong bond among teammates and gotten them enthusiastic about next year? I have heard no reports of rule breaking or unethical inci­dences among coaches or players that could justify the decision of the athletic department. Why is the athletic department taking away a good thing? If Saint Mary's has to rebuild a program every year it is going to get harder and harder to get competitive recruits to come and play for the school. If nothing changes and the athletic department has the opportunity to do away with coaches as they please then the athletic programs will never attract competi­tive athletes to play for the school and raise the bar. The athletic department is working against its idea of making athletics more important at Saint Mary's. Athletes want to be a part of a strong competitive program, and until Saint Mary's builds a program it will stay in the rut it has been in for many years.

'Diplomatic immunity' 
This week will be a busy week for college athlet­ics as men's basketball plans to wrap up its season with the Final Four in Indianapolis, ending an exciting NCAA Tournament. However, when it's all said and done, that will be the least important topic in college sports because another event has 
Ronnie Turner 
come to the forefront. 
Accusations have arisen at University of Duke University that mem­Houston bers of its men's lacrosse The Daily team assaulted an exotic Cougar dancer hired to perform at an off-campus party. The alleged victim, a student at North Carolina Central University, claimed that she was pulled into a restroom, beaten, choked and raped by three men. So far, the players aren't talking, but Duke president Richard Brodhead decided that he would suspend the highly ranked Blue Devils indefinitely pending the results of a rape investigation, saying the suspension is not a punishment. I would have to agree; it's not punish­ment enough. 
Police collected DNA samples from 46 lacrosse players last week, excluding the 47th player, an African-American, because the victim said her attackers were white. Not surprisingly, the lacrosse team has been known for past scrapes with the law; 15 of its members have previously been charged with offenses ranging from under­age alcohol possession to public urination. Many times, the players escaped criminal convictions through deals made with prosecutors. 
It's a shame that more wasn't done by the uni­versity. There's a high probability that someone on that team had something to do with the alleged rape or that they know someone else who did. If these lacrosse players truly want to proclaim their innocence, then they need to cooperate with the authorities. Likewise, ifuniversities truly wanted to make its athletes better citizens, it would stop making concessions for them and let them answer to the law when they commit crimes. 
We've all heard the same stories before. We know about the athletes who get arrested for drunk driving, speeding, theft, drug possession and sexual assault.·What we're not hearing enough about are the athletes who receive ade­quate punishment for their crimes. Instead, they're getting brokered deals to accompany sus­pensions from their teams. 
One well known cases stems from the University of Colorado, which, in 2004, was sued in federal district court for allegedly contributing to a situa­tion in which the plaintiff was gang-raped by CU football players and recruits. The case alleged that the CU Athletic Department marketed its program to recruits through alcohol use and sex with female CU students, while overlooking criminal activities, such as rape. The judge dismissed the suit in the spring of 2005, but some top CU heads had resigned over the embarrassment. 
It's about time universities' officials stopped cod­dling their athletes. Because ifthey don't deal with them properly now, they may have to deal with them later when it's their daughters who are being sexually assaulted.

Professors gripe about student e-mails 
With seemingly the whole world centered on the Internet, it is no surprise e­mail has fast become a popular form of communication. However, some students fail to realize how they come off in an e-mail and that it can have a negative or positive affect on how they are perceived by professors and can even affect grades. 
"Many students have no idea how their e-mails read," said 
Rachel Gorr

Marvin Hill, Northern Illinois University professor of business administration. "Do they ever use spell check? Do they use nouns and verbs in a consistent manner? Alas, God did not cre­Northern ate everyone equal. One week of reading student e-mails will Illinois demonstrate this to all concerned." University 
While e-mail does allow students to contact teachers outside Northern Star 
of class, some fail to use proper English, punctuation or tone. 
The failure to do so may lower the professor's opinion of the 
student and can even be found offensive by professors. 
"My biggest gripe about student e-mails is the lack of attention paid to basic 
grammar and spelling," said Kay Forest, associate professor and chair of the soci­
ology department. "Sloppy e-mails read like sloppy papers or poor exams. This is 
especially defeating when the student is requesting leniency in grading or some 
other reconsideration of his or her course performance or a job recommenda­
tion." 
Students should pay attention to the appropriateness of the questions. Questions 
too in-depth should have been asked in class, or were answered in class and have
l 7 
no place in professor e-mails, Forest said. Requesting lecture notes or asking about the importance of a missed lecture also are complaints of professors. While Hill does not have specific guidelines for his students to follow when e­mailing him, he has received many inappropriate e-mails. 
"For example, 'I missed class today. Did you cover anything important?"' Hill said. "This is a mass lecture where we never, never take roll. The response: 'No, we didn't cover anything important, just went in and talked about unimportant material that we intend to include on the exam.'" 
No matter how perfect the grammar, how eloquent the salutation or how profes­sional the signature, not all questions are best suited for e-mail. This is why, in this information age, professors still hold office hours and allow questions in class. 
"Anything that takes me longer than five minutes to answer, however, triggers a request for a face-to-face meeting," Forest said. "I often find that a brief meeting after class can resolve most issues that exceed e-mail treatment, particularly when I need to ask follow-up questions. Generally I reserve office appointments for conversations about a student's grade in the course or other confidential infor­mation."

In their second game of the day, the Irish came out strong against the Frozen Snappers women's team. The already fatigued Irish squad was strug­gling against the physical play from the Snappers, but Beuke, with her fourth goal of the weekend, put the Irish up 1-0 during the first period. 
Notre Dame's Julia LaPointe took advantage of a power play, scoring the only goal of the second period to put the Irish ahead 2-0. Notre Dame's strong offense dominated the entire third period, putting six more goals on the scoreboard for the Irish. Knoedler had a hat trick in the third period, and Law, Beuke and Kehler each had a goal. Freshman defender Liz Lefebvre record­ed two assists and solid defen­sive play. 
Irish goalie Stack, with con­sistent play and several spec­tacular stops in the first and third periods, withheld the efforts of the Snappers to earn a shutout. The final score was 8-0. 
Men's Volleyball 
Notre Dame traveled to Sheboygan, Wis. for the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association tourna­ment to take on the top teams in the Midwest and qualify for Nationals in April. After vault­ing into the Top-25 rankings, the Irish were motivated to prove they belonged among the nation's elite. 
During pool play on Saturday, the No. 21 Irish were up against some of the strongest opponents of the season. In the early morning, Notre Dame took on No. 15 Minnesota. 
In this first match, the Irish were determined to set the tempo for the day and the rest of the tournament. Quickness and intensity carried Notre Dame to upset the Golden Gophers 25-22, 25-21. 
Next on their schedule was the fifth-ranked Fightin' Illini. The Irish and Illini had split matches already this season, but behind solid passing and consistent attacks, the Irish stunned the Illini in a quick 25-21, 25-20 victory. 
Notre Dame continued pool play against Bowling Green State. The Irish won 27-25, 25-14 to go on a three-game winning streak. With this win, Notre Dame clinched second place in its pool behind No. 2 Lakeland College, which previ­ously defeated the Irish in February. 
After a mental letdown against Ohio Northern, the Irish finished the day with a 3­1 record and earned a first­round bye in the gold bracket. 
Their first opponent was the Flames of the University of Illinois-Chicago. Although sluggish throughout the match, the Irish were able to defeat the Flames 25-20, 25-21. Advancing to the quarterfinals, the Irish faced conference rivals No. 8 Marquette. In February, Marquette defeated Notre Dame in two close matches. 
Be-hind aggressive serving from Dan Zibton and Drew Williams, the Irish easily took the first game 25-18. Marquette tried to make adjustments to help its cause, but with every strategic move the Golden Eagles made, the Irish had a counterattack. With perfect passing and defense from Frank (Ryan) Dax, the Irish rolled on to a 26~24 victory, topped off by an eight-footline bounce by junior James Foresman. 
For the second straight tour­nament, Notre Dame advanced to the semifinal match to face No. 1 OW-Oshkosh again. 
In both previous matches against the Titans, the Irish fell behind early and lost. On Sunday afternoon, however, the Irish did not let that hap­pen again. 
In the first game, the Irish jumped ahead to a 5-1 lead, which they held for most of the game behind accurate passing and smart offensive attacks. The Titans finally caught up to the Irish and tied the game 21­21, going on to defeat the Irish 25-21. 
Game two played out much like the first, as the score was tied at 11-11 when the Titans put together a mini run to go up 15-11. 
From there, the Irish played catch-up. Unfortunately, the Irish lost a tough second game 25-19. 
Notre Dame finished the tournament with a 5-2 record and upset victories over the No. 15 Minnesota, No. 8 Marquette, and No. 5 Illinois, ending up in third place. It marks the best finish Notre Dame has ever had at the MIVA Championship tourna­ment. 
Senior Ryan Goes was recog­nized as an All-Conference Team Honorable Mention. This is the first time Goes has been recognized to the All­Conference Team and the first Notre Dame player to do so in the last two seasons. 
The Irish finish their season in Salt Lake City, Utah over Easter in Nationals, competing against the top 50 teams in the nation. The Alumni Club of San Diego hosted the rowers and coach. 
Women's Water Polo 
The Notre Dame water polo club competed at Miami University (Ohio) this weekend against several top-10 teams. 
On Friday night they played the Illinois Illini, winning deci­sively, 9-6. The Irish opened play Saturday with a 9-2 loss to top-ranked Michigan State. The club then beat Purdue, 11­
6. The Irish ended their week­end Sunday losing to Northwestern, 9-7. 
The Irish look to avenge this loss to the Wildcats this week­end at Rolfs Aquatic Center. Notre Dame will also host Wisconsin.

INDIANAPOLIS -Game, set, match -and a cham­pionship, too -for Joakim Noah and the Florida Gators . 
The tennis star's son dominated UCLA with 16 points. nine rebounds and a record six blocks Monday night to key a 73­57 blowout for Florida's first national title in bas­ketball. 
The championship for Billy Donovan's team comes 10 years after Steve Spurrier led the Gators to a title in that "other" sport. Spurrier is long gone, and the days of Florida being only a foot­ball school appear to be, too . 

For 40 lopsided minutes, the Gators (33-6) were too big, too long and too quick for UCLA. which came up a win short of its 12th national title on a night when legendary coach John Wooden watched from a hospital bed in LA after being admitted for an undisclosed illness that was said not to be serious. 
Florida and Noah won by putting on a thorough dis­play of versatility and unselfishness, a trademark of this team all season. 
The Bruins (32-7) were on a defensive tear coming

BOSTON -During Maryland's last visit to this city, for a regular-season game against Boston College, coach Brenda Frese took her team on a surprise bus trip. 
The destination was undisclosed. 
The players were puzzled. 
But when they unloaded at the new Boston Garden, the site of the NCAA women's Final Four, the message was clear. 
"If you want to come back here. the next time will be for the Final Four," Maryland guard Shay Doron recalled on Monday. a day before the Terrapins play Duke for the NCAA title. "That feeling was unbelievable. You just want to get back here no matter what." '

into the championship game, shutting down LSU's Glen Davis in the semifi­nals and allowing a total of 90 points in the last two games. Florida, though, was just too much to han­dle. 
Noah capped it ofT with a monster dunk with 1:09 left. When the buzzer sounded, he laid flat on his back at halfcourt and let the confetti rain on him. His teammates were in a pile a few feet away and Donovan was sharing hugs with his longtime assistant Anthony Grant. 
The Gators won this by taking it right to UCLA early, looking to Noah, Corey Brewer and senior Adrian Moss down low, making the extra pass in the key and finishing with 21 assists, 10 of them from their frontcourt 
The scrappy junior Lee Humphrey, the only non­sophomore in Florida's starting five, spotted up for a couple open looks against a collapsing defense early in the second half. 
Humphrey's first 3, 80 seconds into the half. gave Florida a 39-25 lead and forced Howland to call timeout. A sloppy offensive possession ensued, then Humphrey came back with another 3. 

Average MLB ticket prices

NHL 
Avalanche takes lead in division 
Denver tops Chicago 4-3 in comeback win 
Associated Press 
DENVER -For 59 minutes, the Colorado Avalanche were on their way to a bad loss. The final 58 seconds of regulation changed all that. 
Dan Hinote and Rob Blake scored in the last minute, and the Avalanche moved within three points of the Northwest Division lead with a victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday night. 
"This was big because we needed these points," Blake said. "I got a power play at the end and Danny made a strong move down the wall, put the puck to the net and it went in." 
Blake scored two goals and became the 17th NHL defense­man to score 200. Andrew Brunette added a goal, and Joe Sakic had three assists. 
Calgary lost one point off its division lead by falling in a shootout to Detroit at home Monday. Both the Flames and Avalanche have seven games remaining. Colorado will play its final three games on the road. 
"It was a tremendous sense of relief to see the last goal go in," Colorado coach Joel Quenneviile said. "We were thinking before if we could get it to overtime, then we get a free point and then we got a really lucky break after that." 
Curtis Brown, Patrick Sharp and Rene Bourque had goals for the Blackhawks, who are out of playoff contention. 
"We made a generous gift to them," goalie Nikolai Khabibulin said. "They really needed one and we gave it to them." 
Brown gave Chicago a 3-2 lead with 5:21 left in the third when he took a centering pass from Bourque from behind the net and sent a backhander over goaltender Peter Budaj's glove. 
But with 2:03 remaining, Michal Barinka was sent off for cross-checking. Blake tied it 3-3 at 19:03, sending the puck through a pileup in front of the net and past Kbabibulin. 
Hinote scored from a tough angle after Sakic had dumped the puck into Chicago's zone. Hinote skated along the right boards and sent a shot off the back of Kbabibulin's right pad and into the net with 12 sec­onds left. 
"I only get the lucky ones," Hinote said. "I knew there was about 15 seconds left so I just wanted to throw it to the net and maybe get a faceoff down there. I wasn't trying to score from there." 
"He's right," Khabibulin said of Hinote's goal. "That puck shouldn't go in. I'll take the blame for that one." 
Chicago outshot Colorado 9­6 in the first period and showed some grit after Khabibulin gave up a rebound goal to Blake at 5:09. Sakic's wrist shot was stopped but the puck bounced right to Blake, who tapped it in for his first of the night.

against the Cougars Tuesday. 
"We might make a couple of ehangcs and givn some guys a chancn to play, not beeause we'rfl taking an opponent likely, but more because some of our guys have some nicks and bruises and we want to rnst them up," he said. 

One of those changes will be to start freshman Jeremy Barnes at shortstop instead of senior Greg Lopez. Barnes started at designated hitter Sunday against the Panthers and drove in the winning run in the ninth inning. 
Mainieri said that Lopez's starting spot is not in jeop­ardy, but he wants to get Barnes' bat into the lineup any way possible. 
"Lopez is a little sore and we want to rest him a little bit," Mainieri said. "I always felt that IBarnes] was a start­ing player and had the capa­bility to be one of our best hitters and all-around play­ers. The problem is that we had a full starting infield coming back and they're all good players." 

The Irish pitching staff has been a catalyst in Notre Dame's winning streak, throwing two shutouts and allowing a little over two runs per game over the seven contests. 
"When you look at our three weekend starters, Samardzija, Manship, and Thornton, I'd put them up against anyone in the coun­try," Mainieri said. "Then Wade Korpi has really emerged as a solid fourth starter. 
"I also like what I've seen out of our bullpen." 
The Cougars have struggled this season, going just 3-17, but almost upset Kansas State on the road March 28, falling 8-7. 
"Kansas State is one of the best teams in the country," Mainieri said. "[Chicago State) could be a very tough game." 
Ball State is 14-11 this year and 5-1 in the MAC. The Cardinals beat the Irish last year, 14-5, at Frank Eck Stadium. 
After the midweek games, Notre Dame will travel to Tampa, Fla., for a three­game Big East series against South Florida. The Bulls are new to the conference this season, and the Irish have only faced them once before, in South Bend in 2001. South

Non-conference foes loon1 for Irish 
Squad can continue seven-game streak 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

The Irish will try to extend their seven-game winning streak this week with non­confnrence games against Chicago State today and Ball State Wednesday at Frank Eek Stadium. 
Notre Dame (17-8, 5-1 Big East) is coming off a three­game sweep of Pittsburgh at home last weekend and has­n't lost since March 25 at Georgetown.

"It sure is a lot more fun to win than lose," Notre Dame eoach Paul Mainieri said. "I'm sure the players are aware that we've won sever­al games in a row and I'm all for thinking about it, but you can't rest on your laurels. Just because you won the last game doesn't mean you'll win the next one." 
Mainieri said he will make some lineup changes for the midweek games, especially

SMC won't speak on Bender issue 
Players met with Mooney Monday 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Saint Mary's Director or Public Information Melanie McDonald said Monday that the College could not com­ment on the speeirics or the decision not to renew the contract of first-year head coaeh Steve Bender. 
"This is entirely a person­nel manner," she said. 
The Observer reported in Monday's edition that Bender was not retained as coach after leading Saint Mary's to its best conference record in program history this season. 
Several players met with College President Carol Ann Mooney Monday to discuss the situation, said a member of the team who wished to remain anonymous. Specifics of the meeting were unavail­able to The Observer. 
It remained unel11ar what members of tho coaching staff would return to the team for thn 2006-07 season. 
McDonald said the athletic: department would providn any support to baskntball team members ncedP.d during tlw transition period. 
"Our athletic dirnetor. Lynn Kachmarik, has always pieked up where ever any­thing has left o!T, so I'm sure she is in complete control of the situation," MeDonald said. "And this will not be a major detriment to Saint Mary's or to the basketball team." 
Bender led Saint Mary's to an 11-15 record this season and a 9-7 mark in Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) play. 
Bender was unavailable for comment Monday, and tele­phone calls made to players by The Observer were not returned.
