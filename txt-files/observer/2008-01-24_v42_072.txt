15 student fihnsdebut at festival 
Introductory classes allowed to participate 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 
Fifteen students will have their Notre Dame cinematic debut as the 19th annual Notre Dame Film Festival begins tonight in the Browning Cinema of the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. The films will be screened for University and general audiences. 
Film, Television and Theatre (FIT) professor Ted Mandell said this year's selection of films is an especially creative and entertain­ing group. 
One new feature of this year's festival is the addition of films from students in the Introductory Film class. 
"Many years we don't have the opf)ortunity to screen projects from the Intro class because of time constraints due·to the num­ber and length of advanced proj­ects," Mandell said. "This vear we were able to get a few of those in there. 
"They add a unique energy to the festival. It's great for students just starting out to have their work shown to a large audience." 
The three-day festival will fea­ture films created entirely by stu­dents in their FTT courses. Most of the films are produced in groups of two to three students and are the result of a semester's worth of work, Mandell said. 
This year, the festival will screen 15 films -two more than last year -due to the short length of sever-

Actors fro111 London visit ND for the week 
Members will perfonn 'The Taming ofthe Shrew' 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
After 33 years touring nation­wide, the Actors From the London Stage will be returning to Notre Dame this week to perform "The Taming of the Shrew." The company, which is based in London, tours American colleges and univer­sities through the patronage of the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. The University initially established the part­ne·rship in 2000, company

Sexy slip

Student..<> found in violation of this policy 
shall be subject to disciplinary suspension 
or permanent dismissal." 

In 2008, thi<> may seem slightly comical, but because we attend a Catholic institu­tion, the rules mirror Catholic tradition. 
An attention-grabbing contradiction has since become apparent. 
Inside my history notebook, which I pur­chased at the Notre Dame bookstore, I found an advertisement oflering to save me up to 93 percent on magazine subscrip­tions. The first magazine adverti<>ed is Cosmopolitan. On the cover, next to Grey's Anatomy's Kathnrine llnigl, are the head­lines: "Naughty Sex: 8 Hot New Positions We've Never Published Befim!" and "The Sexiest Thinhrs To Do Afu~r Sex." Below that, Glamour magazinn. with a headline nmding "30 Things Every Woman Should Know About Sex By Ago 30." 
Interesting. 

By no means am I against naughty sex, nor do I partieularly care whether maga­zinfls describing it am advertis"i1d in my notebook or not. But it made me think about the filet tlmt a university that bans sex on it<> campus would allow these adver­tisement..'i in notebooks bearing it<> mune. Hmnmnber, tl1is i'i the university that ordered P<mgbom !!all to change a sign because it "took the Christ out of Chri'itmas." 
Maybe I'm reading too much into this. An i<>sue of Entertainment Weekly, with a picture of the Sopnmo fiunily, is also adver­tised. I don't think the University means to advocate the acceptability of organized crime. Maybe the University figured it would gain morn money from the adver­tisement than it would lose in donations from radical Catholic donors who took offense. 
Maybe the University never saw the adverti'iement before it went in the note­book. Maybe the University just doesn't care what Cosmo thinks about apres-sex antics. 
But it got me thinking. 

I don't tl1ink this will cause the University to unveil a vigorous anti-sex campaign, nor do I think it will repeal parietals and edit duLac. I don't want it to either. Does the University care? Should I care? (If you're wondering, I don'U'm all for Cosmo and it's feminine secrets. Its an invaluable resource for all men; its like Michael Strahan stumbled across Bill Belichick's playbook. Guys can learn what girls really think.) 
I don't know what to tl1ink about it. I don't know whether it never reached the desk of any university official because it's so inconsequential and insignificant and my imagination is blowing it out of propor­tion, or if a fierce battle raged inside a busi­ne&<> manager's head as to whether to allow the ad and whether the revenue was worth the risk. 
It made me think twice, but as of now, I've gotten nowhere productive.

Woman takes 55,000 pennies to the bank 
SHREVEPORT, La. ­Vicki Armstrong has been saving her pennies for almost 19 years and she was making 'plans this week to cash them in at a bank ­all 55,000 of them. 
She knows the $550 won't make her rich, but says the symbolism reinforced frugal spending habits. "It helped me be a little bit more con­servative in my lifestyle," said Armstrong, who is planning to retire at the end of the year from Christus Schumpert Highland Hospital, where she works as a maternity technician.

Armstrong has been stor­ing pennies in vases, bowls and the occasional shoebox. In 1993, The (Shreveport, La.) Times reported she had squirreled away 14,000 pennies. Armstrong resisted the temptation of cashing them in and kept saving.

Funds under the umbrella of the CCC include the Contingency Fund, for a single club seeking additional funds; Club Collaboration Fund, for two or more clubs seeking funding for an event; and the Council of Representatives Collaboration Fund, for a club and another student body organization also seeking funding, Robbins said. 
Clubs are grouped into subdivisions: academic, athletic, cultural, per­forming arts, social serv­ice and special interest, Robbins said. Each divi­sion can have up to four representatives elected from clubs within their division. 
Elections for division representatives are occurring next week. Robbins said it is "impor­tant that students active in clubs join the council so that each division may be properly represent­ed." Allocations for next year will be made in March.

Cardinal George to speak at conference 
Special to The Observer 
A theological conference specifically designed for undergraduate students will bring Cardinal Francis George of Chicago and other speakers to Notre Dame on March 31. 
The conference, "Christ is Risen! So Now What?" has been organized by the Center for liturgy and the Notre Dame Vocation Initiative (NDVision), which held a similar conference on vocations for undergraduates last year. 
"We thought it important to assist and encourage theological discussion of issues of personal concern to undergrad­uates," said David W Fagerberg, direc­tor of the Center for liturgy and one of the conference organizers. "In this con­ference, which will take place a few days after Easter, we want to address what appears to be a false dichotomy between those who pray and those who act-that is, between the student drawn to a con­templative retreat and the student more inclined toward service and pursuing justice. We wish to show that both these demands of Christian discipleship have their source in the empty tomb." 
The conference will consist of three presentations, all in the ballroom of the LaFortune Student Center. 
Joan Neal, executive vice president of 
U.S. operations for Catholic Relief Services (CRS), will speak on "A Life of Service" at 4 p.m. A graduate of Loyola University in Chicago, Neal holds a mas­ter's degree in pastoral studies and a certificate in biblical spirituality from Catholic Theological Union. She directs CRS domestic programs and advocacy, overseeing six regional offices across the country and working in partnership with dioceses, parishes, colleges, universities and other Catholic organizations. Before joining CRS in 2002, she was president of her own management con­sulting firm whose clients included Catholic agencies, dioceses, organiza­tions and parishes in the Midwest. 
Rev. Cyprian Consiglio will speak on "A Life of Prayer" at 7:30 p.m. Father Consiglio is a musician, composer, author, teacher and monk of the Camaldolese Congregation. For 10 years, he lived at New Camaldoli Hermitage near Big Sur, Calif., serving as liturgist, choir director and teacher. Deeply interested in comparative reli­gion, he frequently visits India to study and teach. He divides his time evenly between his home in Santa Cruz, Calif., and travel for performing, teaching and leading retreats. 
Cardinal George will speak on "Easter: The Font of Prayer and Service" at 9:30 
p.m. A native of Chicago, he oversees the second largest Catholic archdiocese, after Los Angeles, in the nation. Recently elected president of the American bish­ops conference, Cardinal George has taught in several seminaries and served as vicar general of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the religious order to which he belongs. He holds master's degrees in philosophy and theology from Catholic University of America and the University of Ottawa, respectively, a doctorate in American philosophy from Tulane University and a doctorate in sacred the­ology from the Pontifical Urban University in Rome.

In choosing what films to screen, FIT faculty looked at the combination of writing, shooting, editing and acting-all the ele­ment'> that make up a strong pro­duction, Mandell said. 
"We spend a lot of time in class discussing ideas, working on script<;, analyzing rough euts, and polishing rn-edit<>," he said. "The final film is the result of both ere­ative collaboration among stu­dent<; as well as the battle to beat the deadline, which lurks at the end of every semester.

voluntflnrs to schools that both sustained major damage from the hurricane and currently employ ACE teachers. 
"ACE wanted to serve the Catholic schools still affected by Katrina and give an oppor­tunity to open students' eyes to what happened," said Greg Hobinson, a sophomore who works for the ACE program and participated in the trip. 
The students first traveled to Jackson, Miss., and went to dif­ferent Catholie schools to help out in any way they could while meeting tnachers and students who lived through the catastro­phe. 
"We would wake up, have a quick brnakfast, and then went to thn grade school where we would do jobs for them. They had a shed that rw!~ded to be elearnd out for storage. They didn't have the manpower to do it thnmsnlves," Hobinson said. 
Latnr in the day, the students intnradnd with the childrnn.

Thn day-to-day routine con­tinued as tho students traveled New York, L.A., and London ­the centers of film and television -and it's difficult for students to be able to get in touch to those kinds of places, so bring­ing them here is invaluable," said film and television profes­sor Christine Becker. 

"This gets students in direct eontact with professionals who are doing what our students are interested in [pursuingJ." 
AFTLS tours 10 universities in the fall and eight universities during the spring. Besides Notre Dame, the eurrent tour of "The Taming of the Shrew" will travel to Massachusetts, Texas, California and Mississippi, Atkinson said. 
Many of the actors in the troupe have been trained at prominent companies such as the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain and 
a great deal of time. 
"The filming process was a bit tedious because we did multiple takes of eaeh shot," DiPiero said. "We actually had to shoot the film twice in its entirety after the first take had some lighting issues and was not up to our standards.'' 
DiPiero and Rohman's film is the comedic story of a stolen iPod that leads to a not-so-chance encounter between a boy and girl looking for love. 
Junior Mark Weber, who co­directed the film "The White Tree" with senior Julian Owyong, said the greatest challenge in making his film was the aetual filming proeess beeause their script required a large cast. 
"With a large east, we had to eomplete most of the shooting in one day in only a few short hours," Weber said. "We had to be very efficient with both our actors and our crew to get every­thing shot." 
'The White Tree" is based on real events that occurred at Jena High School in September 2006 
along the Gulf Coast. 
"We did odd jobs. We painted benehes, eleaned a lot of win­dows, and again, in the after­noon we were working with the kids," Robinson said. 
The volunteers traveled as inexpensively as possible, Robinson said. The $100 fee per person eovered the van fare and basic food. 
"We didn't use a lot of expenses," Robinson said. "We got three vans to drive down, and ate a lot of peanut butter and bread. Throughout the trip we would stay in high school gyms, which I imagine didn't cost money. The ACE program has good relations with sehools in the area. Parents would give us dinner everywhere we went. They were very hospitable." 
An important part of the service trip was learning about the disaster and its aftermath. Various survivors spoke to the students about their experi­enees. 
"We heard from some ACE teachers, and a couple who had their house destroyed in New Orleans," Hobinson said. "We heard from a teaeher who is living in a trailer on her front yard, whieh is what most peo­ple are still doing down there. It's a huge deal to have gotten into your house. People are still waiting after two and a half years." 
AftPr working in the schools, the volunteers traveled into the heart of New Orleans. 
"It was a really powerful day," Hobinson said. "Seeing how mueh devastation there Shakespeare's Globe Theater. 
"While we do not tour interna­tionally, AFTLS actors present two performances in London fol­lowing their time in the United States," Atkinson said. "These shows are held at the presti­gious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and enable the actors' colleagues and eountry­men to see their work." 
The actors are cast in Britain where they rehearse for several weeks before coming to the United States, Atkinson said. 
The AFTLS makes minimal use of props, lighting or sets in its productions.

where racial tensions erupted in the Louisiana high school. 
"The events at Jena High framed a powerful story which I thought the students at Notre Dame, black and white, eould learn from," Weber said. 
Weber said he hopes students who see the film will understand "that racial tension is still an issue we faee in our society today, and it is up to us youth to change that."

While the trip lasted only a week, the students plan to eon­tinue aiding the cause back at Notre Dame. 
"We are trying to figure out how to keep the trip alive," Robinson said. "We are giving a presentation around Mardi Gras to spread awareness, and looking back on how much the kids loved it, we are trying to arrange a pen pal program.

BAGHDAD -A thunderous blast tore through a vacant apartment building in northern Iraq on Wednesday, killing at least 17 civilians and wounding more than 130 in adjacent houses just minutes after the Iraqi army arrived to investigate tips about a weapons cache. 
Hescue crews searched under toppled walls, collapsed ceilings and piles of debris tossed by the explosion that blew apart the empty building, which Iraqi authorities said was used by insurgents to stash weapons and bombs. 
The hunt through the wreckage stretched for hours, raising the possibility the final casualty toll could climb. The huge blast went off just after the troops arrived, and no soldier was reported killed.

Utility officials say such shutdowns probably wouldn't result in blackouts. But they could lead to shockingly higher electric bills for millions of Southerners, because the region's utilities may be f(Jrced to buy expensive replacement power from other energy companies. 
Already, there has been one brief, drought-related shutdown, at a reactor in Alabama over the summer. 

Mexican cop found guilty in drug case 
McALLEN. Texas -A former Mexican police commander was convicted Wednesday of helping run the notorious Gulf cartel's drug smuggling oper­ation. 
Carlos Landin Martinez was found guilty of nine eounlc; including drug trafficking, conspiracy and money laundering over alleged cartel activities from 2005 to 2007. 
Prosecutors said Landin oversaw an operation in which traffickers wanting to use lucrative smuggling routes across the border into South Texas had to pay Landin a "piso," or tax, to move drugs in cartel terri­tory. Landin was the Gulf cartel's second-in-com­mand in Reynosa, a Mexican dty south of McAllen, prosecutors say. 
Drugs came across on people, on rafts and through a tunnel that opened up through a manhole in IIidalgo, Texas, among other means, according to investigators. The proceeds from drug sales all over the United States were then smuggled back into Mexico, authorities said.

Afghan president warns of terror 
Karzai delivers bleak message at World Economic Forum amid fears ofglobal recession 
Associated Press 
DAVOS-Afghanistan's president warned Wednesday that the whole world could suffer from the "wildfire" of terrorism engulfing his region, a grim message for a meeting of political and busi­ness leaders already fretting over the threat of global recession. 
Formally opening the World Economic Forum, Hamid Karzai gave a sober­ing rundown of recent attacks attributed to Islamic extremists -among them the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and bombings in Afghanistan and Pakistan that have killed hundreds, including many children. 
With militant violence still on the rise in the two nations six years after the ouster of the Taliban, "it seems like the mutant of extremism is dan­gerously unleashed across the region," Karzai said. The trend "bodes terribly badly for the whole world," he said. 
In an apparent allusion to Pakistan -whose president, Pervez Musharraf, originally supported the Taliban -Karzai called terrorism "a venomous snake that some among us tried to nurture and befriend at the expense of others, which I hope we realize now was a mistake." 

Musharraf, now a U.S. ally in the war on extremist with Rice "went very well," nomic anxiety, told an audi­many seemed to share a groups, has often been saying there was "total con­ence of chief executives, glum mood that the world accused by Karzai of not sonance and unanimity of politicians and others that the could be sliding into reces­doing enough to shut down views" on joint efforts to fight U.S. economy is resilient and sion. sanctuaries for Taliban fight­terrorism. will remain an "engine of "We're in Round 1 or 2. ers in Pakistan's tribal region How to stem terrorism is growth."

said, adding that overall 
applications submitted for

"In terms of numbers, 
though we are down, the total

ever before," he said. "And 
we're excited about the 
opportunity that these 
changes present to us." 
A favored system 
The University has long­
endorsed a non-binding, non­
restrictive Early Action pro­
gram which allows applicants 
to submit an application for 
consideration on Nov. 1, an 
earlier date than the Dee. 31 
regular admission deadline 
that the majority of appli­
cants choose to meet. 
Under the Early Action pro­
gram, candidates are notified 
by mid-December of an 
admissions decision of either 
admit, defer or deny. 
Deferred applicants have 
their files re-evaluated in the 
regular decision admissions 
process and are notil'ied 
along with the regular deci­
sion applicants at the end of 
March. Students denied 
under any admission program 
may not reapply within the 
same academic year. 
Notre Dame's Early Action is unique from other schools in that it is designed to give prospeetivn applicants a clear admissions decision in time for the student to have many options to make the right col­legn selection. Saracino said high school counselors have always "praised" the admis­sions proeed u re the University offers. 
Prospective high school stu­dents also favor this compo­nent of the admissions process at Notre Dame because it helps them pre­pare well for the havoc of col­logo applications in general. llnnry llodes. an narly-aetion admit from Hoekhurst lligh School in Kansas City, Mo., said Notre Damn's early admissions process made applying to colleges, "a lot nasier." 
"The college admissions process is so crazy and com­plex. and we are always being advertised with e-mails and notifications," he said. "Notre Dame is very clear on when to apply even when it's lyour] number one choice, the online application is very friendly and easier to usc."

"In this day and age of glob­alization, it is imperative that we create world leaders that will make a positive impact when they return to their home countries," Medina said.

I can think of no better place to prepare these young men and women than the University of Notre Dame."

IN BRIEF 
eBay CEO to step down in March 
SAN FRANCISCO -Meg Whitman will soon step down as chief executive of eBay Inc., the online auction company that went from wobbly startup to multibillion-dollar household name in her 10-year tenure. 
Whitman, 51, had been reported to be plotting the move and handing the job to John Donahoe, 47, who has been heading eBay's core auction and e-commerce busi­nesses. She confirmed her March 31 depar­ture as eBay reported fourth-quarter earn­ings Wednesday. 
Whitman will remain on eBay's board of directors. 
"With humor, smarts and unflappable determination, Meg took a small, barely known online auction site and helped it become an integral part of our lives," said Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and chair­man. "We're all enormously grateful that Meg dedicated herself to stewarding eBay through its 10 most formative years." 

GM and Toyota even in global sales 
DETROIT -General Motors, a symbol of American industrial might and the world's top seller of motor vehicles since Herbert Hoover was president, has finally been caught by a foreign rival. 
GM conceded Wednesday that Toyota Motor Corp. pulled even last year, each of them selling about 9.37 million vehicles, in another sign that the balance of corporate power is shifting from West to East. 
It's the first time GM has been anything other than the exclusive global sales leader since 1931. 
The figure of 9,369,524 vehicles sold around the world was a 3 percent increase from 2006 for GM. But Toyota's strong sales growth in the United States in recent years -and declining sales for GM in its own backyard -finally closed the gap. 
Earlier this month, Toyota reported global sales of about 9.37 million vehicles for 2007. The Japanese automaker said Wednesday it would not release more pre­cise figures, so who's No. 1 remains unclear. 

Wall Street pulls off comeback 
Potentially massive decline avoided by largest turnaround in over 5 years 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Wall Street pulled off a stunning come­back Wednesday, surging higher in late trading and wiping out what looked to be yet another massive decline. The Dow Jones industrials, down more than 323 points in earlier trad­ing, ended the day with an advance of just under 300 points. 
Such volatility has become a hallmark of Wall Street's performance in recent months amid the ongoing housing and credit crisis and growing fears of reces­sion. And, after five straight days of pullbacks, a rebound was to be expect­ed. But analysts saw some positive signs in the day's trading. 
The Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to lower its benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage point to 3.5 percent, while met with some skepticism, did give intrepid investors a reason to buy Wednesday. 

"You might say this is a belated reaction to what the Fed did this week, com­pounded by hopes for the Fed to do more next week," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.

If llillary had left Bill when he didn't have sexual relations with that woman, I could have suggested a pretty good hus­band. 
Back in 1998, he was 51 years young, wealthy, and good­looking. lie was a politically ambi­tious liberal. lie and Hillary would have made great bodfi1llows. 
Who is contest­ant number one? Willard Mitt Homney. 
Of course, sinefJ 1998, a few things have changed. 
Today, Ilillary and Mitt couldn't be mueh farther apart. While I Iillary whines about the "Hnpublican attack machine," Homney invokes "llillaryCare" as shorthand fi1r the big-government uni­versal health earn plan that he loathes. But-at loast. in political terms­Homney and Clinton would still look pretty good together. 
After all, both would do just about any­thing to bocorne president of the United States. And both arn fighting back chal­lenges from maverick, anti-nstablishment candidates with tnrrifyingly similar, dis­honest taetical maneuvering. 
It's pretty easy to get the impression that Mitt just continues to trot out whatever message he believesis most politically expedient at the time. 
In Miehigan, Homney sounded almost Edwards-ian as he asserted, ''I'm going to fight for every single job. I'm going to rebuild the industry. I'm going to take bur­dens off the back of the auto industry." 
Please. As Romney asserted that he would "fight for every single job,'' he blamed only higher emissions standards for the decrease in jobs rather than acknowledge that the free trade he so ardently supports might play a role. 
In Florida, meanwhile, Romney is run­ning an ad in Spanish, which includes a laughable "Soy Mitt Romney, y apruebo este mensaje." Romney's efforts to appeal to the Latino community would be admirable-if he hadn't also repPatedly appealed to the anti-illegal immigration wing of the Republican party by emphasiz­ing his desire to establish the United Statns as an English-only country. 

Most prominently, Mitt has become a member of the Christian Coalition. 1990s­Mitt was-to use his words-"ell'nctivPiy pro-choice." 2008-Mitt bemoans his de facto pro-choiceness as "the biggest mis­take" he's "ever made." While 1990s-Mitt asserted that "as we seek to establish full equality for America's gays and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective lead­ership than" Sen. Ted Kennedy, 2008-Mitt spends little time talking about the impor­tance of gay right.:;. Except. of course, when he's spPaking of the importance of limiting them to protect "traditional" mar­riage. 
Does anybody doubt that Mitt would say anything and twist any rhetoric to be pres­ident of the United States? 
But Mitt's not alone. Consider the llillary campaign's maneuvering in the last month: While apologizing for the invoca­tion of "teenage drug use" by Barack Obama, HiJlary Clinton's chief strategist Mark Penn managed to up the ante by reminding voters that the drug in question was cocaine. 
Earlier tllis month, meanwhile, Clintim called Barack Obama's opposition to the Iraq war a "fairy tale"-even though a popular YouTube video from 2002 shows the then-state senator warning the coun­try not to give the president a "carte blanche" and trumpeting increased inspections instead of war. 
Even her emotions seem disingenuous and calculated. She's become notorious (thanks, of course, to Jon Stewart and YouTube) for an overdone laugh that she uses to get out of tough questions. And some -though not all -insist that her near-crying earlier this month was a calculated maneuver to appear more human. The very fact that that so many assumed she was being disingen­uous suggests that she's gained a repu­tation for embracing Romney-like cal­culative-ness. 

Does anybody doubt that llillary would do anything to be president of the United States?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Domer dating: 'Man up' 
Man up! While reading Aristotle in La Fun the other day (the only place lively enough to keep me awake to power through the Politics). I could­n't help but overhearing a single girl talking to her best guy friend about her frustration with Domer dating (or lack there oD. I am so tired of hearing students complain about how screwed up gender relations are at Notre Dame. 
This is not to say that gender rela­tions are normal; they're not. It's true that there is a lack of dating culture at Notre Dame, but this defi­cieney is self-inflicted. People like to blame our abnormal gender rela­tions on everything from the Notre Dame "family" mentality"to the cold weather keeping everyone in hiber­
nation for winter. Girls always com­plain that guys never ask them out on dates but are far too suspicious of any guy who may try to strike up a conversation (especially if he is less than attractive). Guys, on the other hand, insist that all the cute girls already have boyfriends and that Notre Dame simply doesn't attract the same "talent" other schools do. 
Since I am a guy, I'll speak to the guys. Guys, there are far more girls here than guys (especially if you include the all-girls school across the street). There are many single, cute girls just dying for a genuine guy to simply take them out on a date. Stop giving excuses, man up, and ask a girl out for coffee, lunch, or even dinner. She might say no, 

but she might say yes. You might go on a second date, or you might not. You might end up with a girlfriend, or you might end up with a new friend. 
As much as people complain about dating here, it's a lot harder out in the real world. Don't go your entire college career never having gone on out on a date. Man up, fellas. This girl wasn't looking for a long-term boyfriend that would come through with the ring-by-spring at the end of senior year. All she wanted was a date. I hope she gets one.

was supposed to be the one with all the vocation. Plus, he was Faithpoint a varsity tennis play­er, and took Regis Philbin's daughter to an SYR -neither of which: granted, elimi­nates anyone from the priesthood. It just didn't seem to fit. But what contributed to my surprise more than anything was the certain fact that we hadn't ever-ever­had we? -no, absolutely not, in four years in Alumni Hall, talked about a voca­tion to the priesthood. What, in God's name, was happening? He told me later. 
He had been reading the Gospels. 
The Gospels are not about keeping the status quo. We acknowledge this frequent­ly enough. But perhaps we fail to acknowl­edge how difficult a reality this is. Most of us reasonably crave stability and pre­dictability, including and especially in our relationships. 
But the first pages of the Gospels serve as fair disclosure that all bets about pre­dictable outcomes are off. In them we hear the story of the baptism of Jesus, during which John hesitantly pours water from the Jordan River upon Jesus, only to have the skies open, the Spirit descend upon Jesus in the form of a dove, and a voice thunder from the heavens, "This is my Beloved Son." And the Church calls this the beginning of "Ordinary Time?'' (Yeah, and my walk outside this morning felt a lot like "Spring Semester.") John enjoyed upsetting the norm as much as anyone. Yet even he seems, well, stunned, as the full­ness of the Gospel breaks into the world in the person of Jesus. 
If we read these early Gospels carefully, we might detect a hint of startle in this rebel's voice -as if John is beginning to glimpse the full reality of who Jesus is, but can't quite absorb it all at once. In fact, we catch John saying about Jesus: "I did not know him." "I saw the Spirit come down like a dove upon him. And I did not know him." 
What is John talking about? How can he possibly say he does not know Jesus? Of course John knew him. In fact, outside of Mary and Joseph, maybe nobody knew Jesus, and all that Jesus was to become, better than his cousin, John the Baptist. For this reason John was born: to prepare the way of the Lord. It was John who jumped in Elizabeth's womb when Mary arrived pregnant with Jesus. (So John knew Jesus before Jesus knew Jesus!) It was John who pointed to his disciples, while Jesus was but a silhouette in the morning horizon, "There is the one we have been waiting for!" Yet, still, the erup­tion of the awesome power ofthe Gospel into John's life leaves even John occasion­ally overcome: "I did not really know him." 
Think about any significant relationship you are in, or have been in. The deeper the relationship, the better. Think about how the relationship first began. The other person was interesting to you in some way. And so you began to spend time together -all the while coming to know the other person more fully. If it is your best friend, you perhaps come close to being able to say: "I know you. I've come to know who you are." You come to know their family. Their most deeply held convictions. What they think about God. Where their wounds and sorrows are. It's one of the most beau­tiful things we experience as humans -to come to know another person like this. 
And then, one day -it happens. The person you know, almost inexplicably, does something, says something, implies something, and you stop dead in your tracks, and say, "Where did that come from?" Sometimes, it's a good change the person surprises us with. Sometimes, it's a hurtful change. Sometimes, it's a sudden change. Sometimes, the change has been developing for months or even years, and finally one day, it becomes manifest. And sometimes, the person you are watching all this happen to is -you. 
Such moments, we must admit, are often threatening, for we prefer security and comfort and the familiar. And when a per­son changes, our security and comfort are often threatened, especially if that person is our self or a close friend. The problem is the Gospel often evokes just such changes in those it reaches. There is hardly a Gospel story in which the person who encounters Jesus does not change in some remarkable way. 
So, here is one great lesson from these first days of "Ordinary" time. Once John recognizes the work of grace in his friend's life -even though the grace was reveal­ing in Jesus realities beyond even John's untamed imagination-John does not hinder this new reality, but chooses to spend his life empowering Jesus to become who he is called to be. 

I suppose the point is this. When people in our life -including ourselves -begin to grow in unanticipated ways, this can stir up all kinds of things in us-fear, insecu­rity, jealousy, over-protectiveness. All of these feelings are normal, and even some­times justified. ButJohn challenges us, as people of faith, to realize that grace is con­stantly transforming each one of us ­including our best friends, our roommates, the people we encounter so frequently that it becomes hard to see them anew-into new creations. 
Each one of us lives under a sky that is continually opening above us, trying to persuade us of our deepest identity: "You are my beloved child." This is no small calling: It has the power to carry us down paths of freedom and challenge that we have not imagined. So be generous­with yourself and others. Who knows where Jesus is leading you and them?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Contraception doesn't equal abortion 

First, I'd like to say that the Catholic Church promotes using fami­ly planning as a method of birth control acknowledging that a couple is still open to life. How is that any different from other forms of birth control? I'm not saying it justifies abortion, but what I am say­ing is that currently, people do decide when to create life and when not to. By being abstinent, you are deciding not to create life, and even having sex while using any form of contraception, the possibili­ty of life is always there. So to say, "If you claim the right to decide when life begins you will predictably claim the right to decide when it ends, as in abortion and euthanasia," is still just "predictably." It doesn't mean someone is right to make such a jump, but we also live in a world where we mix pro-life with anti-abortion. Pro-life is pro­helping foster children, anti-death penalty, pro-improving the adop­tion system, pro-economic justice, and pro-social justice. 
The truth is that our world is becoming increasingly small due to improvements in health care and technology. The result is that you can not tell everyone to just pop out kids all the time because then we'll all have huge families, the world will get overpopulated, and we will all fight over resources. Wait, we already do that. Not that huge families are bad, but years ago, having many kids was part of a necessity for survival. We are surviving, far longer than ever in human history, and we do not need to have a litter of kids because most of them will live to reach adulthood. So, let's try this, every married person: Abstain from sex for two weeks out of each month, then you'll only have kids five percent of the time. That, however, deprives us of our sexual being, and in fact, simplifying sexuality down to sex down to reproduction deprives us of our sexual being. 
Did God not create the clitoris? Does sex not feel great? Is there not pleasure involved? Well, there is, and to deny that the impor­tance of pleasure in building a relationship with another person and God is to deny a piece of us that is God-given. Contraception only impedes, but doesn't do away with, the possibility for life. Now, abortion, that clearly ends life, and I am anti-abortion due to abor­tion being done not out of love for our neighbors as Jesus loves our neighbors. The point I'm trying to make is that the Catholic Church could do a world of good if it considered just for a moment that con­traception doesn't equal abortion. Their form of contraception, fami­ly planning, has the same results as others -that it prevents preg­nancy from occurring most of the time -but people can still get pregnant.

So much for best laid plans.

On another day, the crew accidentally took some shots with a gradient filter on the lens, resulting in unusable film and a reshoot on a dif­ferent day. 
Doxtader said the experi­ence of planning, budgeting and shooting a film helped shed some light on the chal­lenges of the film industry, for good and for bad. 
"You are essentially your own writer, director, cine­matographer and editor, and that allowed us to fully con­trol every aspect of the process," he said, although he also noted that assistance from classmates helped him com.plete his film. 
"One thing that's really great about the FTT depart­ment's approach to produc­tion is that it is extremely hands-on and collaborative. Everyone worked on every­one else's picture, which allowed us to really get a feel for filmmaking. The other members of the class were really helpful and creative."

Associated Press 
MELBOURNE -It's fine for Roger Federer to talk about the tension and nerves players feel before a Grand Slam semifinal. He is about to play in his 15th in a row, after all. 
But while it might reas­sure Novak Djokovic to hear that the man he'll be facing in his first Australian Open semifinal experiences some nerves too, he'd better be wary of the rhetoric. 
"I remember when I made my first Grand Slam semifinals or my finals, I was so nervous," Federer said in an almost confiding tone, after beating James Blake 7-5, 7-6 (5), 6-4 on Wednesday. "Now it's been so many that it's almost become some sort of a rou­tine. That's helped me a great deal being able to cope with those moments." 
Federer has a brilliant conversion rate, reaching the last 10 Grand Slam finals and winning 12 of the last 18 dating to his first at Wimbledon in 2003. 
The momentum and experience gives Federer the edge, he says: "Maybe they blink a little bit in those important moments, whereas maybe usually they wouldn't." 
At 26, Federer is the old­est of the men's semifinal­ists, and will meet the youngest in 20-year-old Djokovic on Friday. The third-ranked Djokovic beat No. 5 David Ferrer of Spain 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 to complete a run to the semifinals at all four majors. 

Rafael Nadal, who will play unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the other semifinal, is the longest-serving No. 2 in ten­nis history, and he's only 21. Nadal knows something about catching Federer on a bad day in a Grand Slam, though, after beating the Swiss star in the last two French Open fmals. 
Still, Federer prefers to see the No. 2 and No. 3 players as potential rivals at the end of each major. 
"It's great that Rafa made it through, as well, with Novak. It's good for tennis," he said. "It's not just one guy, but it's a few guys now who have been playing very consistently. 
"It's going to be interest­ing to see. I'm excited play­ing against Novak, no doubt." 
Djokovic has two fellow Serbians in the women's semifinals. 
No. 3 Jelena Jankovic ousted defending champion Serena Williams, and No. 4 Ana lvanovic beat Venus Williams 7-6 (3), 6-4. 
It's the second time in four majors that the Serbian trio has made it to the semis, repeating their run at the last French Open, and gives the end of the women's draw a dis­tinctly eastern European accent. 

IN BRIEF 
Ravens hire Cam Cameron as 
new offensive coordinator 
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -Cam Cameron, coming off a 1-15 season as head coach of the Dolphins, was hired Wednesday as offensive coordi­nator of the Baltimore Havens. 
Cameron, 46, was fired by Miami earlier this month. His only victory came against the Ravens. He's the first assistant hired by new Ravens coach John Harbaugh. 
Cameron was the San Diego Chargers' offensive coordinator for five seasons before his one-year stint in Miami. In 2006, the Chargers led the NFL in scoring with 492 points. 
The Dolphins finished near the bot­tom of the league in yards and points last season, and Cameron was fired Jan. 3 by new Dolphins executives Bill Parcells and Jeff Ireland. 
The Ravens went through several offensive coordinators under former coach Brian Billick, who was fired Dec. 31. 
Rockies give SS Tulowitzki 
six-year, $31 million deal 
DENVER -Troy Tulowitzki went into spring training last season just hoping to secure a spot on the Colorado Hockies' roster. 
That won't be a concern this sea­son. Tulowitzki and the NL champi­ons finalized a $31 million, six·year contract on Wednesday that includes a club option for the 2014 season. 
"It's surreal," Tulowitzki said. "It's awesome." 
The 23-year-old slick-fielding shortstop showed up for his news conference wearing a black suit, white shirt and purple tie, and was flanked by teammates Matt Holliday and Garrett Atkins. 
Tulowitzki said he's just getting over the sting of being swept by the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. 
However, the team's success played a big role in committing to a long-term deal. 

Subpoena of former All-Star 
Knoblauch still not served 
WASHINGTON -Former major lea­guer Chuck Knoblauch had not been tracked down as of early Wednesday evening by federal marshals trying to serve him a subpoena from a House panel investigating steroids in baseball, a committee staffer told The Associated Press. 
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because staffers were not authorized to make public comments on the matter. 
Knoblauch, a four-time All-Star who played for the Yankees, Twins and Royals from 1991·02, originally was asked to appear Thursday for what was supposed to be the first of five dep­ositions or transcribed interviews scheduled by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 
Those sessions are in preparation for a hearing Feb. 13, when the witnesses are scheduled to include seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens.

opponent's home venue. The result often is a contest against a lower­echelon team, commonly called a "body-bag game." 
Notre Dame will have to schedule several "one-off' games to fulfill Athletic Director Kevin White's goal of seven home games, four road games and one neutral site game each season. 
"This is part of our commitment to play more games in South Bend," Heisler said. 
This time, at least, Notre Dame found a way to play an extra home game against a solid team on an upward trajectory. 
In fact, it appears South Florida jumped at the chance to play in South Bend. 
"Our football program and fans deserve this type [of] matchup," South Florida Athletic Director Doug Woolard said in a statement. "It fea­tures one of the most storied pro­grams in college football history against a young program that has risen to prominence at a record pace." 
Besides South Florida's strong showing in the 2007 season, the Bulls have a major recruiting advantage that should help them build future competitive teams. Central and south Florida are hotbeds of high school talent, and the opportunity to play and live in the temperate climate of Tampa can woo players averse to colder weath­er. 
The agreement between the two schools appears to have been in place for some time, but South Florida and Notre Dame only openly acknowledged it after the Tampa Tribune's report. On Wednesday, Heisler could not confirm the date of the game because his files on Notre Dame's future schedules were "in boxes" stored away. 
Still, neither side is rushing to sign an official contract, which would include all financial and broadcast terms ofthe deal. 
"We frankly have not been wor­ried about signing contracts for a game down the road to a great extent because so many of the media things and language in the contract become [obsolete]," Heisler said. "For instance, the creation of the Big Ten Network and the Big Ten's latest agreement with ABC, ESPN and the Big Ten Network cre­ates a whole new set ofrules related to footage, Web sites [and] coaches' shows." 
Heisler said the use of video on new media platforms, which are changing rapidly, creates a particu­lar problem when trying to sign a contract three years before a game. 
"All that's just gotten way more complicated. Web sites in particular are a huge item in use of footage," Heisler said. "Part of this is getting NBC involved on any of these rela­tionships so that there's a complete understanding of when an institu­tion comes to South Bend what can they do." 
NBC owns the broadcast rights to all Notre Dame home football games. 
As for the Big East, Heisler said Notre Dame has yet to plan exactly how it will fullill i1s goal of playing three teams each year. 
"All that ha'> not completely been put in place," he said. " ... I don't know that there's a school in the conference that we haven't had con­versations with." 
Notre Dame will have some 
return games against Big East 
opponent.'>, but tlmre are likely to be 
more home-only games announcPd 
in the future. 
"We'll end up with some home­
and-home situations, but we can't 
do that with everyone in the league 
probably," Heisler said.

goals and 25 assists. 

Joining Yeatman on the attack will be junior Ryan HolT, who netted a team-high 40 goals for the Irish last year. Even more impressive than Hoff's scoring might have been his accuracy -he posted a .500 shooting per­centage on the season. 
While the Irish graduated only three starters from last year's squad, midfielders Lucius Polk and Brian Hubschmann will be key loss­es. Hubschmann, an honor­able mention selection to the All-America team. was among the top three for the Fighting Irish in points, goals and assists. 
Polk was also a solid offen­sive contributor for the Irish. tallying 18 goals and seven assists. 
"We've definitely lost the most in our midfield," Corrigan said. "We have to solidify and prove ourselves in the midfield this season." 
Pacing the midl'ielders will be senior Michael Podgajny, who has 70 points in his career at Notre Dame. Playing alongside him will be senior Taylor Clagett, a face­off' specialist, who has a .595 winning percentage in his career. 
The Irish face a tough schedule that includes three NCAA Tournament teams from last season -Loyola, Albany and North Carolina. In addition. the Irish will partici­pate in the inaugural GWLL Tournament at the conclusion of the regular season. 
"It should be fun, and a great environment to play in," Corrigan said. "It's a great way to end the regular season and experience tournament pressure without the one and done of thn NCAA Tournament." 
Notre Dame begins its sea­son Sunday with an exhibition at home against Hobert Morris. Thn Irish will open the regular season Feb. 16 at Loyola.

trip to include an educational aspect. 
"One of the things I'd like to do is get our guys in a course this summer on Ireland so they have some feel for it," Brey said. 
This idea did not sit well with sophomore guard Tory Jackson, who said he wanted to spend his spare time doing "anything fun." According to Jackson, taking a class about Ireland does not qualifY as "fun." 
"I may skip out on the trip," Jackson said. "Don't tell anybody, but I might skip out." 
Despite Jackson's strong objec­tions, Brey said he'll force the guard to join the trip anyway and pondered changing his name to suit the Irish population. 
"Oh, he's going," Brey said. "His name may be Tory McJackson for the two weeks we're over there." 
The team will hardly be alone. Anthony Travel is currently organizing travel options for oth­ers wishing to make the trip. 
"I just think it's just so natural," Brey said. "And we'll have a Jot of fans tagging along on some golf trips, some excursions going over there." 

Brey said the trip will be a good learning experience for his team, especially this year's freshmen, who have seen limited minutes all season. 
"It's going to be great for our basketball program because we'll get ten days of practice which we'll start at the end of summer school," Brey said. "For our freshmen who aren't playing, think about it for them, their sea­son starts Aug. 1, not Oct. 15, and we can get them in games there because those games aren't counting for the NCAA Tournament. We can look at dif­ferent lineups and experiment. It's just a great head start for next season."

Appleby followed every Notre Damn hockey game except one last season live on the play-by­play Gametracker, not caring about the eight-hour time differ­ence between Ramadi and South Bend. He called his wife, Betsy, who sat in the front row next to the Irish bench every game, for the starting lineups before he settled in to watch the game sta­tisties flash onto his computer screen. 
"It gave you a break. You do your job everyday, you see stuff that is just ridiculous," Appleby said. "You sec II umvees being blown up and parts of Humvees that have been blown up. That was your time to get away."

MEN'S lACROSSE 

Squad looks to build on last season's success 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 

Heturning most of the starters on a powerful offense and the toughest defense in program history, Notre Dame will try to use its mix or talent and experience to make another championship run this season. 
The Irish return seven starters from last year's 11-4 campaign. After losing three of its first five games to strong non-conference oppo­nents, Notre Dame reeled off eight straight wins to elosc tlw regular season. 
The streak included a per­feet 5-0 record in Great Western Lacrosse League competition, earning the Irish their lOth GWLL title. The Irish advaneod to the NCAA Tournament with a No. 8 ranking, but fell in overtime to eventual national champi­on Johns Hopkins in the first round. 
Notre Dame enters the sea­son with high expectations, 
ranked fifth in the Lacrosse Magazine preseason poll. 
"Our guys have very high aspirations," Irish coaeh Kevin Corrigan said. "We return a lot of experience op. a strong offense and defense." 
Heturning in net for the Irish is senior captain Joey Kemp, a preseason All­American selection and the 2007 GWLL player of the year. A four-year starter for Notre Dame, Kemp has a 26­11 record and 7.43 goals­
against  average  for  his  
career.  
Senior  Sean  Dougherty,  
another  preseason  All­ 

American, anchors an Irish defense that gave up a pro­gram-best 6.66 goals per game last season. 
Two-sport athlete Wi II Yeatman, the 2007 LaxPower rookie of the year, will return as the leader of a strong Irish attack. Yeatman, who also plays tight end on the football team, led Notre Dame in points as a freshman with 21

Irish set to tap their roots 
Hoopsters lo.aking forward to Ireland trip this summer 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Part of being an athlete at Notre Dame_ means sacrificing the possibility of spending a semester abroad, but this August, coach Mike Brey will give his squad a taste of over­seas travel when it heads to Ireland to participate in the Inaugural Emerald Hoops Program. 
The Irish will compete in a tournament Aug. 13-25 against the national teams from Ireland and Poland while the coaching staff' will take part in clinics set up by the Basketball Federation of Ireland, which developed the program. Under NCAA rules, each program is permitted to take one foreign trip every four years. 
"We were in the rotation for a foreign tour and we said, 'Where do we want to go'?"' Brey said. "To me, always, the Fighting Irish and Ireland was a

For some on the team, like junior forward Zach Hillesland, the trip represents the first opportunity in their lives to leave the United States. 
"Coach Brey was like, 'You guys are probably going to be like rock stars over there,' and I think we'll get a lot of that with (junior guardJ Kyle [McAlarney] with that Irish name, and over­all it should be a good experi­ence," llillesland said. 
McAlarney, who felt the need to clarify that he is of Irish descent, said he was excited to explore Ireland in his spare time. 
"I just want to walk around, enjoy the sights. I heard it's. beautiful over there," McAlarney said. "Eat some Irish food, visit some Catholic church­es, and take the time out to just enjoy it."
