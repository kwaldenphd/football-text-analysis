Board of Trustees--After five years of planning, argumentation, and equivocation, the Boards of Trustees of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College this year decided to work for a merger of the two schools to be im­plemented over the next three or four years. The Park-Mayhew Report, presented in December of 1970 will provide the basis for the merger, which will begin to be felt in the fall of 1972. There are many problems to be wroked out and many egos to be soothed before the merger is complete.

Narcotics raid nets four Notre Dame Students--John T. Bren­nan, Donald Badger, Mark Hennahan, and Donald Holbert, were arrested in a series of coordinated drug raids by local police on December 17th. Hen­nahan and Badger have been since acquitted in the local courts, Holbert was never brought to trial, and Brennan awaits trial in felony court. The case brought the first big test for the new Judicial Code and its "imminent danger" clause. Few will argue that the system worked perfectly.

In a hard fought race at Notre Dame, Barkett and his run­ningmate Orlando Rodriguez beat Mooney and Dan Sherry on the second ballot with about 53 percent of the vote. The election was complicated by the entrance of several strong minor can­didates, most notably Eileen Fitzpatrick, who took 12 percent of the vote on the first ballot. Girls were held to be valid candidates for the office by the Student Government Judicial Council,

Princeton Plan Fails---In a massive ·show of student non­support and apathy, only 48 percent of the student body turned out to vote in the Prin­ceton Plan referendum October 3rd, which would have ~iven students a week off to campaign for the candidate of their choice in the November election. The proposal required the positive vote of 50 percent of the students. Less than that voted, and the proposal was beaten 3 to 1.

Mter fuming alumni and disgruntled nuns settled down, the campus returned to normal and the incident was

7. 
Krashna Lonstitution Defeated--Dave Krashna ran for SBP on a platform that included elimination of the Student Senate by means of a new Constitution. The Senate, however, proved more durable than Krashna, and the Constitution was defeated in a referendum on December 9th. Only 35 percent of the students voted. In order to pass 60 percent had to vote. Of those voting, it was 3 to 1 in favor of abolishing the Senate 

8. 
Ann Marie Tracey Elected to the SLC--Former Saint Mary's Student Body President Ann Marie Tracey was elected to the North Quad student seat on the Student Life Council. Because she was not a Notre Dame Student, Miss Tracey had originally been denied permission to run by the Student Government election Committee, chaired by SBVP Orlando Rodriguez. The move caused heavy criticism of the committee, whose ruling was reversed by the Student Senate. Miss Tracey won over­whelmingly. 

9. 
The Black Studies Con­troversy--One hundred black students lead by Dr. Joseph Scott petitioned University Provost James Burtchaell in March to change the status of black studies from a program to a department. Scott complained that the reliance on other department heads to hire faculty for the black studies program made it im­possible to hire the needed faculty. The conflict was resolved by giving black studies faculty appointments the top priority in any department hiring new faculty in the Arts and Letters College. 

10. 
Annexation Loses-An attempt by the city of South Bend to annex the University of Notre Dame, St. Mary's College and Holy Cross Junior College was defeated in the South Bend Common Council by a 6 to 3 vote. University of­ficals had vigrously opposed the annexation proposal for tax reasons.

The class· of '74 has shown their concern about their academic life by the fact that no other Freshman in the history of St. Mary's College has achiev~:d such high academic standing ( 27 percent of the first semester freshmen attained a grade point average of 3.0 or better or above). Because of this concern, we as future Sophomore class President and Vice-President, would like to aim our yearly activities from a social outlook to one stressed towards academic goals. During Freshman year even though we attained such high academic standing we were mostly involved in social affairs; as sophomores, with most of the students concentrating on their majors, we would like to work for the develop-. ment of a better and more concrete academic life. 
The next plan that we would like to contribute does not concern all, but it concerns many. We know from the experience of living with our fellow classmates that many girls who come to college are very naive of many of life's situations. We have found that sex is an integral topic which many girls are mis-informed. Also, the girls really have little opportunity to have their questions answered. We feel that better counseling should be available in this area as well as others for those in need of it. It is one of our aims to make this possible. 
Our last point is concerned with the building of a closer association not only between St. Mary's class and hall governments, but with that of Notre Dame's governments also. This including extended lobby hours, more hall activities, and organized open-discussions on pertinent topics. 
Since the complete 
Since the complete academic merger of Notre Dame and St. Mary's for the '71-'72 school year will be finalized on May 14thand May 15th, and our class and possibly the present Sophomore class will be getting our degree from the University of Notre Dame, we seethesethings as quite feasible. 
We realize that all of this is more said than done. However, for any of this t11 ever be accomplished it must be initiated by your hard-working, reliable officers. We strongly feel that we can meet these demands. Please give us your support for your Sophomore class President and Vice-President. ·

First girl secretary 
Market Club elects officers 
The Notre Dame marketing 
club has recently elected new 
officers for the coming year, 
including St. Mary's student Beth 
Culligan, the newly-elected 
secretary of the chili, is the first 
SMC student to become an of­
ficer, according to outgoing 
president Robert F. McCarthy. 
The other new officers are: Bill 
Lind, president; Mike Lamb, vic~ 
president; and Pat Monroe, 
treasurer. Miss Culligan is an 
economics and business student 
at St. Mary's, while the other 
three officers are marketing 
majors at Notre Dame. 
McCarthy felt that the election 
of a female student as an officer 
for next year's club was 
"somewhat of a breakthrough." 
"Beth Culligan was extremely 
active and participated in all of 
the events sponsored by the 
marketing club this year, and 
we're certain that she is going to 
be a real asset", McCarthy 
commented. 
McCarthy cited her role next 
year as instrumental "because 
Peace pledge well accepted 
Saying he was "extremely 
gratified with the turnout", Paul 
Dziedzicexpects the number of 
peace pledge signatures to top 
the 1100 mark. 
Dziedzic emphasized that the 
peace pledge campaign was a 
strictly non-partisan student 
effort. It was designed to provide 
students with a means of con­
vincing national leaders and 
candidates that they will carry 
their desire for peace to the polls. 
The peace pledge campaign 
was a "constructive, action­
oriented process," Dziedzic said 
adding that it is the "best thing to 
come out of thP. national 
moratorium." The peace pledges 
will be presented to President 
Nixon and all the members of 
Congress on June 1. 
Due to the lack of time in which 
to organize, Dziedzic expected 
only about 500 signatures. He 
noted the "fine" efforts of the 35 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's 
students in surpassing their goal. 
According to Dziedzic, the 
campaign was financed entirely 
by private donations and not by 
student government funds. As 
Ombudsman, Dziedzic is willing 
to help organize any non-partisan 
campaign, regardless of it int­
tent. 
Citing some of the problems the 
campaign encountered, Dziedzic 
said, "Some people thought we 
were an FBI front or a vanguard 
for a peace candidate." In an­
ticipation of the political ac­
tivities next year, he said that the 
Ombudsman's office would 
divorce itself from politics, 
engaging only in non-partisan 
student efforts.

she will be able to continue the efforts that we started this year to combine the business areas of both St. Mary's and Notre Dame." 
He also reflected upon the accomplishments of the 65­member organization during the past year. Primarily, the projects undertaken were "designed to integrate classroom activities with the business world." 
The former president said "From all indications we have received, this year has been a most successful year, principally because it has been the most active, and it has included the most people." . _ _ __ 
One of the club's first ob­jectives was to increase its base for membership. The success of this was witnessed in the turnout for the ali-day marketing sym­posium last February. The at­tendence was well over 400 people, making it the largest crowd ever for an event spon­sored by the business club. 
The symposium was a part of the Gilbert Lecture Series, which sponsored three other events during the year. The first of these was a speech given by a vice president of Manhattan Shirts on the subject of sales activities and advertising. He presented the movie Second Effort in order to relate "sales to football per­severance." 
Abell gets phone call; Ruane awaits Provost 
Last night at 10:30, Observer Thursday night editor Joe Abell received a mysterious call. The caller claimed to be University Provost Rev. James Tungstead Burtchaell. The reason for the call was to inform the staff that the Provost was accepting the Observer's challenge to an arm wrestling contest. 
The challenge appeared on the editorial page of yesterday's Observer. The Observer challenged the Provost to an arm wrestling contest in front of the Fieldhouse. The loser would have to enter the building while it was razed about him. The challenge resulted from the Provost's comments while on the WNDU radio program Contact Notre Dame, where he said he would raze the Fieldhouss if the Ob­server staff was inside. 
Upon receiving the call, the newspaper office became ex­tremely joyous and Don Ruane, Observer managing editor, was chosen to represent our vested interests. Editor-in-Chief Glen Corso was heard calling Ruane "an imminent danger to Rev. Burtcbae!Vs arm". Ruane was chosen because the Observer's six and under arm wrestling champion from Roosevelt, Arizona, could not be raised from a deep sleep. 
McDermott in a preliminary dual. He then drew against Ob­server Executive Editor T.C. Treanor, who lost a coin flip to determine the right of opposing Burtchaell. Prior to the match with the Provost, Ruane com­mented, "Yeah, I'm from South Jersey and us South Jersey kids is tought." 
The magic hour of 11:00 rolled around, the hour at which the caller said he would show, and the office cleared. The entire staff proceeded to the parking lot for the emminent battle with the Provost. Ruane posed for photographers and expressed his confidence for victory. He said, "I will be victorious because I ain't gonna be in that building when it comes down." 
As the staff waited for the appearance of Fr. Burtchaell, SBP John Barkett showed up. He agreed to referee the match-up. Other campus luminaries ap­peared as they waited for Fr. Burtchaell to show. Mark Win­nings, ex-8BVP and members of the Badin Hall community also came as the crowd swelled to witness the impending show down. 
But the Provost never showed. Or, the person who placed the call never showed. Nonetheless, the staff retired back to the office, disappointed that the Provost 
Ruane, however, had to beat never came. A good time was had Observer Night Editor Jim by all.

WASHINGTON 

a 
<UPI) -The Senate Armed Services Committee has decided 
that age 75 is too old for the draft. 
The committee announced it had voted to reduct the age limitation for conscription from .75 to 65. In actual practice men over 30 rarely are subjected to the draft, but an upper limit left on thz books in case of an all--out war would require most able-bodied men to serve. 
The committee passed a proposed two-year extension of the Selective Service Act, which is now due to expire June 30. The panel's proposal also would exempt men who have served 20 years in thz armed services. The present limitation is 25. 
Another provision would permit the prosecution of draft dodgers until they reach the age of 31. The statute of limitations now runs out after seven years for men who fail to register. 
A&L Advisory Council seeks new membership 
Ed McCartin, president of the Arts and Letters Advisory Council, announced today that he is accepting applications for membership in next year's Advisory Council. Anyone in­terested in applying should contact McCartin before 6:00 P.M., Monday, May 10, at 3186. ­
The council serves as a ready source of student opinion for the administrative staff of the liberal arts college. The president of the Advisory Council has an ex of­ficio seat on the Arts and Letters College Council, the highest policy-making body in the college. Students involved in the Advisory Council are responsible for organizing Meet-Your-Major Night activities and for selecting the recepient of the Charles Sheedy award for teaching. They also assist in the selection of four student representatives to the College Council and the AL representative to the Academic Council. 
Any freshman, sophomore, or junior presently enrolled in the College of Arts and Letters is eligible to apply. McCartin noted that while the scope of the Ad­visory Council may appear small, the work that it performs is important to students in the college. "With the establishment of a permanent curriculum committee next year to review complaints about the non-liberal character or poor academic quality of courses offered within the college, the student advisory council will be central in academic reform."

Uncle Stephano 
My uncle Stephano is in the Mafia. Before I go any further let me say that my uncle Stephano (or as he is called by the FBI and friends, "Steve the Slit") is on my mother's side of the family, not my father's. This is said mainly so my father won't have an excuse to call me up and tel me I am an idiot like he did after the "First Tuesday" show, back in December. 
I talked to my uncle Stephano that last time I was home, during spring break. Most people don't realize it he told me, but the Mafia suffers duringj economic recessions just like any other business. 
"Thatsa what ehey donna unnerstan," he said "we gotta make living justa like anyone else. When times are bad, people got less money to spend on whores, .and dope and stuff like that. Even da gambling falls off, guys don't wanna lose the little bt a money dey got. The loan sharkin' business is worse still. So many guys borrow money and than a can't pay it back. Ita gets messy sometimes, there'sa so many guys that we gotta persuade to pay us back." 
My uncle gets very mad when they put the words "rep.uted Maf~a chieftan." before his name in the newspaper. He gets mad because It hurts his TV reparr shop, located in a small rustic village that has an eight-lane highway running down the middle of it, is staffed by my uncle and two assistants and my uncle's brother­in-law. 
Only the two assistants know anything about TV repair, and my uncle is con­vinced they are both crooks. Every time they come back from a job he carefully checks the big tube and tool box they carry to see if anything is missing. 
Sometimes this gets to be embarassing, because if my uncle thinks something is missing he will get out a butcher's cleaver and try to cut the assistants ears off. 
"You lousa pigs, I cutta your ears off if Ia catcha you," as hechases them around the shop. The assistants usually run into the bathroom and lock the door and then try to explain the discrepancy to him. 
It is very difficult to explain to a potential customer why the owner of the store is hacking at a door with a meat cleaver, without sounding very stupid. 
This is why my uncle hired his brother-in-law to work. His job is to take care of all the irate customers that come into the shop. This is a very difficult job sometimes, mainly, because my uncle's brother in law doesn't know anything about televisions radios, or stereos. 
"You say that your record changer sticks, even though the fellow from here gave it a complete lubrication job for only 29.95? Gosh, well, sometimes that trouble comes from the vertical line control being out of whack. What? Of course I know that you're talking about a stereo not a TV. The vertica~ line control ~ontrols ~e changer I'm telling you. What did you call me buddy? Listen do you like you Wife and kids? Yeah, well, would you like to see them remain healthy?" 
My uncle usually doesn't have too many problems with customer relations. Every once in a while, though, a custom~r doesn't get .the messag~. He st.ar~s t~ insist that my uncle should send the reparrman out agam because his set sbllisn t working. Most times, if the guy asks nicely, my uncle will send the guy back. Rarely will he ever send him out a third time to the same house though .. 
"Whatsa that you a say Mista? My man didn't do a good enough job on your TV? Whatsa wrong with it? Is that all? Listen you got two TV.s? Ok, then take the other one and turn the volume all the way up so you can hear it in your den and then switch on the other one and you gotta picture. You no lika that idea huh? Whata you gonna do if I no send my man out? Oh yeah? OK, I senda him out. Larry," he said "turning to his assistant," go out to that baccalla's house on Forest Ave. and taka this with you." 
He turns to a large steel cabinet behind him and takes out a small hammer. 
"Smasha all the tubes in his TV and then accidentally put your foota thru his picutre tube. Ifhe isn't watching you too close, then piss all over the inside of set," I think that'll fix him." 
My uncle also extends very easy credit. He does this, he explained, because he is in the business already. The only problem he has is that sometimes has problems 
My uncle also extends very easy credit. He does this, he explained, because his is in the business already. already. The only problem he has is that sometimes has problems collecting. . 
In one case he sent a lender a pair of size four shoes for his birthday. The puzzled man called my uncle and asked him why he sent him shoes that didn't fit. 
"Oh don't worry," my uncle told him chuckling gently," they will fit you." 
"I tried like hell to get my feet in them but they just wouldn't go," the caller explained, "but I want to thank you for remembering my birthday." "Oh don't thanka me", my uncle said, "bya the way you gonna be home tonight?" 
"Yes," the caller said. 
"Thatsa good. A couple of a my men are gonna stop by to collect the money you owe me," my uncle said. "Well Stephano there's a little problem there, I don't have your money." "Oh, well thatsa all right, then, you gonna get a chance to enjoy your birthday 
gift." 
"What do you mean?" 
..Well whena my men come over tonight they gonna break botha your feet and whena they finish you gonna be able to get them in a size four shoe." 
In the past few months though my uncle's loan business bas grown enoumously 
and be no longer bas time to personally direct all of the operations. He hired a guy 
that came to him highly recommended, Harry Finkelstein. 
Harry is a very funny type of guy, be doesn't like to talk to people, so be writes 
them, letters. Once there was this guy that had borrowed a huge amount of money. 
The guy was a real big wheel, and bad a good credit rating. Rumors began to fly 
though that he was in big financial trouble, so my uncle told Finkelstein to caD in 
the loan. 
Harry wrote the guy several notes, asnd got obscene replies. This dist~ 
Harry greatly because be is a very moral person. Finally in a last ditch swap­
weation move be went over to see the guy. 
"Hi! Hou are you doing? I represent Stephano Calabria and Associates and I'm 
hear to talk about your fmancial arrangements with them." 
"Go to hell," the big shot said as be slammed the door in Finkelstein's face. 
This bothered Harry quite a bit. He went out to his car and composed a note 
saying that unless the big shot paid the next thing that came under his door would 
be two gallons of gasoline followed very closelyby a lighted match. . 
Finkelstein realized that this might not scare the guy, since the losses would 
probably be covered by insurance. He pondered for a while and then wrote "Dear 
Mr. Bigshot-your uncooperative attitude has forced me to take extreme 
measures. Ifyou do not pay your load tomorrow by twelve o'clock noon then I wiD 
have two very strong men kidnap you and take you to a warehouse. Once you are 
at that warehouse I will will have another man chain you around the neck and give 
you a meat cleaver and then set the warehouse on fire. "Yours truly, Harry 
Finkelstein." 
My uncle isn't aU bad though. Just like many other American men he has a 
mania, every time be sees something that strikes his fancy be buys it. ~~habit 
gets to be a pain every once in a while. A suburban house rarel~ has facilities for 
caring for Glla Monsters, Gorillas and Crocodiles. Invariably after keeping these 
pets around for a while, my uncle was forced to sell them. After my Aunt threatened to turn him in to the FBI, my uncle stopped buying pets and started collecting things. 
He called me one day, very excited and asked me to come over and see the new thing he had bought. He refused to tell me what it was and told me he wanted it to be a surprise. 
"How do youa lika it," he asked me. "Isn't it a real beauty? This thing handl~s 
justa lika my car, real smooth and easy, and it's guaranteed never to get stuck m 
the mud. I can even drive it to work, wbo'sa gonna get in fronta me with this 
baby?" 
The purchase of a Sherman Tank greatly facilitated my uncle's loan collecting. 
Ralph the Rat would drive it p in front of the deadbeat's house and Harry would 
pop out and begin a slow countdown. 
"0.K. commence firing upon my orders, 10-9-8-7-6-... " he rarely had to go beyond 
five before the deadbeat would come out of his house with a packet of bills clutched 
in his hands screaming hysterically. 
My uncle is starting to get kind of old though and more and more retirement 
thoughts are creeping into his thinking. 
"Wouldn't it be nice to buy a bouse down in Florida," be told me the other day," 
and have Ralph the Rat sitting up on the roof with a machine gun to greet visitors 
and Louie the Louse answer the door with a pistol, while your Aunt and I were in 
the back sitting in thsun?" 
Ed Ellis 
In Search of Hanoi 
Life is a frail commodity, and man has striven for as long as he has been in exestance to possess it in all its meager manifestations. It seems that in order to justify life, each man must, at least in his own mind, be thankful. Th~s is not at all easy, and many people have fallen by the wayside because they either deluded themselves into thinking their own contribution significant, or they gave up trying. 
We must remember, of course, that very few men are actually capable of making a noticeable contribution to the world. These are men of great ts;rmy. The masses of mankind are left to demean the leaders, either openly or sub­consciously, in order to justify themselves and their own lives, either openly or subconsciously, in order to justify themselves and their lives, or if they don't demean them, they strive for supremacy in some other way. 
And like a herd of famished wolves, clawing at each other for a chunk of meat, men strive. In sports, academics, finance, politics, literature, they strive, the competitive impulse as much a part of them as the color of their hair, or the size of their feet. Those who don't strive are outcasts, like the old wolf who has no teeth, or only threelegs. Perhaps Darwin's natural selection makes it necessary, but the competition is often sad, since many men are not equal to the task or to each oth~r. 
One of the most pitiful sights in all the Cosmos is that of a person who has trted and failed. He is worthless, at least in his own mind, and as a result, is able to make no real contribution to anything. Here is a victim of the existential dread; he has sustained a total loss of confidence in himself, and often an even more total loss of the desire to live. 
Another sad sight, usually provoking more people to anger than to pity, is that of the man who thinks he has succeeded, but whose success is inflated by his own distorted view of reality. Both this type and the victim of the dread are themselves victims of the ceaseless race for individual supremacy that goes on in society. They are deprived of their humanity, to their own shame and their conqueror's glory. 
So what is left? Those who don't compete are outcasts. Those who do compete will look forward to success -if they are lucky -but, if not, either hollow self­esteem or the existential dread is their lot. 
Is the system to blame? Hardly. The system was set up eons ago by men just as those who play the game today. It is man who is to blame; man in all his vanity, stupidity, inherent worthlessness. Should there be a strugle? Certainly, for man will always struggle. No one can change that man will even stride to eliminate his natural impulse. If the competitive impulse were to disappear tomorrow, many, many people would be very, very happy. But, then, there would be no leaders, no ne to inspire mankind to improve himself. And then, we must remember that the impulse to strive will not disappear tomorrow, or anytime we will ever see. 
So what is left? Not much. Man must strive, for that is his nature. Those who 
succeed are burdened with advancing those who have not, and those who have not 
can only despair, for that is their lot in life. 
Despair, of course, is unnecessary, since even the leader must eventually realize 
his limitations. If all the losers would do so, then the existential dread would be 
beaten and all could work to their own individual capacity. But, then, that would 
not satiate the competitive drive. 
Best of luck, world. I'm in the same boat as you.

The Bitter End T.C. Treanor 
Uncle Bass gets the Dread! 




"I can't wait! I'm famished!" exclaimed Rodan, eagerly flicking hunks of his People's sandwich into his mouth. 
It was the seventeenth anniversary of H. L. Mencken's death, and all the old Observer Features Crowd was gathered in the anteroom of Cosmo's to mark the bitter event. Rodan the Observer Features Creature was sitting to the left of me massive and passive but capable of moving hi~ considerable bulk into rapid action at any time. To the right of me sat Paul Welte, the Observer Features Poet. He was softly playing a flute he had left over from Buckminster Fuller day. He had hoped that if he had played the flute well enough the master himself might have spoken to him but he didn't. 
Ed Ellis was sitting across from me. He didn't particularly like Mencken, but he savored the Bathtub Bootleg Gin smuggled in from the 1920's, as, indeed, did we all. 
The day was so bright that it cast a pallid pallor over the entire anteroom. The room was dark, but not dramatically dark; the dingy and smudged carbon-walls and carbon-tables bespoke if not squaler, then certainly indifference. 
-A fly buzzed sleepily; landed, got up, landed, got up, disappeared. 
There weren't too many people there; aside from ourselves, only a few ghosts from the American Mercury. They sat back listlessly, lacking the solemnity of somnabulance or the permanence of the sepulcher. I stirred my ice and Bootleg Gin and watched Rodan eat. It was certainly interesting. After he swallowed a piece of his People's Sand­wich, all his throat muscles contracted around it, forcing it further and further down until the ripples of those muscles were no longer visible. There would be a noise like a septic tank being plumbed, and he would go for his next bite. 
"I hope the rest of us get our food soon," I com­mented to my compatriots. Paul Welte continued to play his flute. Ed Ellis nodded a desultory nod. I doubt that Rodan heard me, since as a Tyran­nasourus Rex he is twenty feet high. 
Quasimodogertonocaion, said the rabble in the room, in their languid way. 
I turned my head toward the general direction of the noise, looked away, looked back again. I couldn't believe it! Not after all this time! 
"It's Bass Rumore!" I said excitedly and the whole table clamored up to get a l?ok at ~im. 
It was indeed old Uncle Bass, dressed as always in his ragged peagreen trenchcoat and battered felt hat. It was indeed Uncle Bass, but his step was slower, his demeanor more hesitant, than we had ever known it to be before. His ghostly eyes, set back in the indistinguishable black mass that served as his face, were even more vague than they were usually, and when he raised his hand in greeting, it trembled visibly. 
"How ya doin', Uncle Bass!" Ed said ap­preciatively and cheerily, "Have some Gin!" "No thanks." His voice was hushed yet querelous, and it trembled as perceptably as his hand did. 
"No Gin!" Ed was taken aback utterly. I have to admit we all were. It had been a cold day in Gehenna since last Bass Rumore refused a glass of Gin. 
"Wooo ... " he was quiet; then, suddenly, he sat down. Almost as suddenly, he jumped up and asked, "Is it all right if I sit down?" 
"Yes, of course," Paul Welte said with some 
abstract wonderment. Turning to me, he said, "I 
wanted to ask you how you did in your last outing at 
the polls." 
It had been almost a week, but people were still 
asking me about it. "I lost so badly that I made the smking of the Lusitania look close," I suggested. 
"Speaking of the polls," Rodan said from his regal place of business, "I think we ought to hammer out the platform for next year. It's im­portant that we address ourselves to Monster's Liberation. We've ignore<.i the monster situation on campus too long." 
"I think that we ought to get, for culture a little bit 
more."posited Paul Welte. 
"We must keep a base in political reality," I suggested. "Do we have men in each hall?" but Bass Rumore was shaking his head. 
"What's the matter, Bass?" asked Ed, and Paul 
Welte was forced to throw in, "the matter that you 
are reading." That confused Bass for a little while. 
2-:.>. __., 
"What are you trymg to win?" Bass asked finally. 
"The next election, and more power," I an­swered, but Paul Welte, recognizing the cosmic implications of the question, said, "We are fighting the good fight, and the prize is the soul of man!" 
''Wbat a lousy trade," muttered Uncle Bass. 
"I beg your pardon?" I asked. 
Bass looked around agonizedly. "If...if..." And then his words failed him. Ed brightened up. "Hay!" he said, "Bass has got the dread! The existential dread!" 
"A little poetry," I suggested to Paul, since I felt that poetry might be appropriate in such an existential moment. 
He thought for a minute and sang out: 
"Old Bass has got the dread, 
"He'll wish that he were dead, 
"It's been so long since he's been wrong, 
"And now he's got the dread. Toot, toot!" 
The last two notes came over the flute which he had laid down earlier but took up now. He looked up brightly, but when the rest of us didn't smile, he began to diminish his personality. 
"I had considered the same problem-the total worthlessness of the human soul-myself," said Rodan seriously. "In fact, I had composed my own Polemic Against Man (PAM) in honor of Mencken. I was going to read it during the ceremonies later, but since it doesn't appear that they shall start for a while, I shall treat you all to a premature ren­dition." 
"How long is this?" I asked. 
"Just a couple of paragraphs." 
"Proceed.'' 
Rodan's Polemic Against Man 
Rodan cleared his esophugus. "Polemic Against Man, by Rodan, the Observer Features Creature," he began. 
"The subspecies Homo Sapiens has had a short but arrogant history, and it is to the amusement of the rest of the natural cosmos that you continue to assert superiority in the face of your own depravity. You are, for example, the only subspecies to rise in the World's history only to be faced with an overabundance of your kind. More germane, you are the only subspecies to nse up unaware of how to deal with such an overabundance. 
"The subspecies, Homo Sapiens, is without a doubt the weakest the world ever produced. Its members killed only when they were sure of their own safety, and then did so without compunction. The suicidal valor that marks every other species in the Animal Kingdom is entirely absent in the race of man, and we every day see the result: war, famine, pestilance, overpopulation, misery, depravity. Since the first day of his life a man demonstrates selfishness beyond compare. He learns to modify that selfishness only when it is connected with punishment and pain." 
"What would you posit as a solution to man's 
depravity?" I asked. 
"I would suggest we eat them all," Rodan said. 
We all digested this for awhile; then we, as if by 
unanimous consent, all turned to Bass Rumore. "My Polemic Against Man," he began softly, "would be a less powerful thing." Bass Rumore's Polemic Against Man 
He stood up. I remembered: he always liked to make a speech. Those vague white eyes grew glowing and proud, and they stared out of the cavernous black head like beacons. He grew strong and good, and he took on a vigor and a dignity and a depth that he never had in real life. He was not in a dingy anteroom, but somewhere in Tennessee, doing battle against Scopes and Darrow and all the infidels. 
"When the Lord Jesus Christ," he said, "laid down His life, He laid down a law of love to go with it. He said to his followers: 'Brothers, you have lived a life of sin, but if you live like me and die like me, you shall be free. And to live like me and die like me, you must share you land and your people and your soul, and help your brothers on the side of the road.' 
"Brothers, our brothers are on the side of the road now! They are suffering and they are dying and they are crying; they are in-" 
"Pathos, bathos, fears, and tears," Paul Welte suggested. 
"torment; the torment of self. When a man hates what he is, we must love what he is. But we stand with our hands in our pockets, and hurt, and-hurt, and see the exterior ugliness without ever touching the indefinable unique inner beauty that must be there. 'Twas ever thus, and' his voice lowertd dramatically, and surprisingly, broke, 'Twill ever be thus.' " 
There was a moment of silence before Ed Ellis said, "That was a scoop of goop." 
I was forced to agree. All that pandering for the sympathy of the rabble seemed to me to be an utter waste of time. And the speech smacked of sickening self-pity. I was forced to speculate that it came about as a result of his earlier breakup with the Phantom of the Opera. 
"What are you going to do now?" Paul asked Bass. 
"I'm going to have a lobotomy," he said with a voice both proud and shy. He indeed brougbt his hand up to his head in a protective gesture. 
Well, too bad. If that's what he was into, that was his own concern. I figured that if all he could conjur up with his frontal lobe was that hunk of self-pity, he could probably do without them. 
Rodan apparently thought the same way, because he smiled and said, "congratulations. Be careful of yourself before the big day." 
"I will," Uncle Bass said in an almost childlike voice. "I will." We watched him go. "Son of a bitch," Ed Ellis said. He was suitably impressed. 
"What the hell," I said prophetically. "It's all determined anyway. What we do and where we go is a function of the endocrine system within us and the economic system outside of us." 
"That's right," Paul Welte said. "Man will survive," he said, "for he has an indeterminately loud voice," and for a moment it sounded as though he was going to say something really great, say something for the ages, but just then they wheeled in the body, and the Mencken day ceremonies began.

Reflections of a Student Body President 


The Student Government Office on the third floor of the Student Center was not my idea of a spring vacation site but that cool March 12 night found me working in the Student Body President's office for the first time. It was a Friday-one of the many weekend nights I have spent in LaFortune­and I was looking forward to the weekend only because I was excited at the prospects of learning more about my new job. After reading through dozens of files, I began to appreciate the vastness of the operation: to appoint 10 or so Cabinet members each with specific projects to preform, to have ultimate responsibility for $82,000 in student money, to be the person looked to as the "voice" of the student opinion on every issue imaginable, to help 20 hall presidents help 5,000 people, to increase attention to the off campus student, to expedite what turned out to be the co-ed unification, and on and on. My mind just wandered and wandered from topic to topic and the stark reality of what lay ahead staggered me that weekend. 
The lonesome spring break at Notre' Dame did little to bolster my sprits, though I trad my confidence back after a couple of days. It was incredibly dull here-the squirrels never owned the campus more than they did those 11 days. It was for­tunate though since I had a number of make-up assignments to begin. I also organized my plans for the month of April and established the procedure for Cabinet appointments. As much as everyone hated it I rejoiced at the return of the sun tanned students who visited my home state (Florida) and the neighboring isalnds. 
That joy turned to sadness after a few days. Telling someone he has been rejected for such and such a position is a hard thing to do. Not only does it cause hurt feelings, but also some interpet it as a personal affront to their talents no matter how delicately and sincerely things are handled. In any event, the April . 1 inaguration date was fast approaching and I had a Cabinet to appoint, so I moved ahead. I am very pleased with the results :as the first "30 days" will demonstrate. · 

April 1st is 'April Fool's day, but I ignored the symbolism in the tradition. Beef Slovak did not really take over the Student Government office as the The Daily Rag led some to believe; on the contrary, my entry into office was a very low-key affair. After spending spring break here, the inaguration was anti­climactic. 
The 1st 30 days were not however. Our "kick-ass" executive coordinator, Bob Weaver, molded the Cabinet into a fine working unit and Orlando Rodriguez's experience and enthusiasim aided Bob's efforts. I kept slipping reminders into everyone's mail boxes about getting staffs, begining work on platform planks , keeping everyone informed as to what was going on, and other things as my mind clicked away. It must have worked just by the record they've compiled so far. The Academic Commission pushed for course description brochures in the Arts and Letters and Departments and met with great success. Just recently it announced the distribution of a questionaire on the academic aspect of Notre Dame. The Ombudsman has deal with imminent 'danger , cockroaches in LaFortune, summer job ads, ::~n .academic grievance! committee, and mary others in the over 100 calls that office has handled thus far. The Hall Life Commission has already sent out two Interhall Newsletters, initiated their Hall Fellow "recruitment" and 
organized a Freshman Orientation system surpassing any yet in my three years at Notre Dame. The Off Campus commission not only mailed the first off campus information !brochure in a fong time, but has progressed on a program to raise housing standards and has resear­ched a legal aid service which should be announced soon.

We jointly presented a motwn m the Student Life Council to re~uce the membership and though it failed, the Council has seen fit to order a :e-evaluation of its structure, our major mtent.

of war. Just how far do I as Student Body Presdent go in asserting my personal beliefs without representing the student body? Do national problems share equal attention with local issues? The "voice" I spoke of before is a burden of respon­sibility considering many interpet everything I say as the words of 6,000 students. That's why it's important I not lose touch with you and you not with me and I ask that you constantly remind me of this. 
There has been a couple of other disturbing features to my 1st month in office. The recent SLC elections elicited a 1number of untrue statements and ac­cusations which caused me more disap­pointment than anything else. People never seem to stop playing politics, I'm afraid, when there are so many important issues to be concerned with. This is not Washington, D.C. It is Notre Dame and all of us have a long ways to go if we truly desire to improve life here. I just ask we do it honestly and sincerely and reasonably. 
Another disturbng thing is com­munication. If the Observer ever prints an incorrect statement or if an editorial may not clearly state a position, students begin forming opinions one way or another, about one or what one does. The power of the press is indeed strong so I hope it continues its efforts to fairly portray the happenings at Notre Dame. 
After a taste of the office, I am still convinced our priorities are hall life, academic reform, the minority students, and co-education. They are four comple projects, but I feel confident that we can 
make great progress in all four areas.Co­education especially will require our energies if we are to avoid the problems other schools have encountered. Working with Kathy Barlow and Miss Underman, moreover, should make co-education a much more enjoyable and efficent effort. 
Parting thoughts? Well, I would do it 
over again if I had the chance. I also want 
to thank everyone again for the help I've 
recieved those last nine months in 
Morrissey Hall, in the Hall President's 
Council, in the campaign, and in the last 30 
days. And lastly, I hope all of us find in 
1971-72 the peace of mind and heart we so 
earnestly search for in our lfe journey. 
Happy summer.

Quiet Year 
The year rolls out in considerable quiet, a liquid progression of days and nie:hts. sie:nifyine: nothine:. meaning nothing. Nationally the last days were bitter ones for anti-war protestors. In Washington, they were badly outmaneuvered, as they had been badly outmaneuvered all year. As the academic year closed, Nixon had never looked better. Or stronger. 
It is a strange and intriguing contrast from last year. Last year closed with a massive and powerful strike. It closed with rhetoric -hard, inflammatory, bitter and more than once emotional. And it closed with four dead in Kent, Ohio, and five dead in Jackson, Mississippi. 
This year, the quiet and the passivity seemed to indicate that students were ready to cut their losses-and their aspirations. ­
At Notre Dame the contrast was no more evident than in the choice of student 
body presidents. Last year, Dave Krashna, the dramacist, Dave Krashna, the 
idealist, Dave Krashna, the man who pledged himself to "change the social 
condition here at Notre Dame" -last year Dave Krashna won the most crushing 
electoral victory ever recorded at Notre Dame. This year the student body 
president is a man named John Barkett-a man noted for his calmness, his 
cerebral deliberateness, his collectiveness under fire. 
Two assemblies serve well as a general guideline to the mind of students on 
this campus. The first was held last year in Stepan Center during theheartof the 
Cambodian crisis. A packed house narrowly voted to support the most militant of 
three proposals-to strike for a week against our Cambodian incursion. 
This year, SBP Krashna revived-or attempted to revive-the General Assembly 
of Students. But for two of its scheduled three meetings, the sessions were 
cancelled for lack of a quorum. In the only meeting executed, the sole radical 
proposal-a proposal to have separate black housing on the University campus­
lost overwhelmingly. 
Something has happened to the student body. 
It would be sophistic to say that it has been scared by what happened at Kent 
State and Jackson. Courageous men marched in last year's demonstration, and 
courageous men would not be discouraged by the inevitable accident of death. 
Nor would it be complete to blame the change on the recession. In a 
moratorium mass last year, seven men publicly and up to a hundred men 
privately, risked their well-being by destroying their draft cards. It is difficult to 
imagine those same people thwarted by the possibility of unemployment. 
But where the the brave words, now? Where are the bold promises, now? 
Something has happened to the student body, and as the most important moves 
in Notre Dame's history since its inception reveal themselves before us, that 
student body reacts-not with a bang-not with a whimper-but with a yawn. 
And the yawn is the most deadening of blunders. 
What will happen next year is hazy, and what we should do about it is even 
more hazy. Only one thing is certain. We will have to wake up. We will have to 
vote more than six per cent off-campus in the next Student Life Council election. 
More than twenty-five per cent will have to vote in the towers. We will have to 
speak, and speak loudly, and perhaps even demonstrate. For next year is the 
year in which we will begin to co-educate, and begin to determine what we will be 
after we co-educate. 
We have seldom had two more clearcut paths open to us-nationally and locally 
-than we have now. Now, we have before of us the choices of potence and im­
potence. And in this, its last editorial, the Observer endorses potency.

Netmen win two 
By E.J. Kinkopf year. 
The Irish Eye
Observer Sports Writer "We have no outstanding 
The Notre Dame racqueteers national stars, but we have good ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The year in sports -fond memories 
added two abbreviated victories depth. This is evidenced by the 

to their extended win streak Wednesday afternoon. 
The Irish netmen defeated the Valparaiso Crusaders 5-1 in a rain shortened outdoor contest. 
Then they moved indoors and disposed of Northwestern 8-zip, while upping their record .to 21-5. 
The Irish "B" team got the nod against Valpo, and Bernie LeSage, the regular number four man, Greg Murray, Tony Early, Dickie Murray and Greg Reid responded with singles victories. 
Coach Fallon said the doubles matches may be rescheduled for next week, if they can be squeezed into the busy Irish schedule. 
The starters then breezed right past the Northwestern Wildcats. Buster Brown, Mike Reilly, John Allare, LeSage, Brandon Walsh and Rob Schefter all recorded wins. 
The doubles combinations of Reilly-LeSage and Allare-Early followed with victories. 
Number three doubles was cut short, with Walsh-Murray and the Northwestern combo each earning a game victory. 
The netters still have five dual matches left on the schedule, plus the central Collegiates June 7th to 12th. The NCAA Cham­pionships also loom in the near future. The racqueteers will host them from June 14th to the 19th. 
Since this is the last publication of the Observer I asked Coach Fallon to evaluate the team's performance up to this point. 
He said he was really delighted 
with the team's fact that we can play our "B" team and still come out on top. Like Wednesday with Valpo and with Marquette a couple weeks ago." 


"Tiger" Tom was most pleased with the overall team effort. He stressed the dedication they had, practicing indoors, even during the dinner hours. 
"John Allare had the best in­dividual record, but it was still more a team effort this year. And I guess the highlight of the season so far would have to be beating Indiana twice." 
At this point Indiana is the Big Ten leader with a !HI slate in the conference. 
With such a great spring behind them, I asked Coach Fallon to evaluate the racqueteers' chances in the NCAA's. 
"Well, we're no national power. We had an unpublished gaol this spring of twenty wins, and if none of our matches are rained out, we should achieve that goal. And to end up in the top twenty nationally would be great." 
He also felt the tourney would be the strongest in years and maybe the strongest ever. 
"The West Coast dominance will be challmged. UCLA must still be considered topps, but schools like Trinity of Texas, Miami and Georgia should prove 
to  be  more  than equal  to  the  
Bruins."  
And  then,  of  course  there's  

Brown, Reilly, Allare, LeSage, Walsh, Schefter and Murray. And those guys aren't too bad either. 
Although there are still a few athletic contests yet to be played this Spring, for all intents and' purposes the year in sports is well nigh a thing of the past. What a wonderful year it was! So many memorable games -so many great plays py some un­forgettable players ... The was the Purdue game in the rain. Ara had promised a victory and the Irish responded by demolishing the Boilermakers 48-0. The Spartans were thumped 29-0 at East Lansing-the first time Notre Dame had bPAten MSU in Spartan Stadium since 1949. 
The largest crowd in Missouri sports history saw the Irish roll past the Missouri Tigers, 24-7. Ed Gulyas scored the key TD on a flat pass that Mizzou just missed picking off. It could have been a different ball game. 
Denny Allan shoved across from the two for the winning touchdown against Georgia Tech and Scotty Hempel's clutch field goal kept the Irish unbeaten string alive against a fired-up bunch of Bayou Bengals. 
So. Cal played the role of spoiler in a monsoon in L.A. but the Irish would have a chance to act that part themselves in 33 days. 
The Cotton Bowl-for the second straight year. Against the Texas Longhorns, winners of 30 straight football games. Notre Dame took them apart, 24-11. The game that afternoon in the Cotton Bowl will become a part of the Notre Dame football legend. 
In December, Johnny Dee's cagers, knocked off the Kentucky Wildcats in Louisville, 99-92. 
January ~3,1971: Barely three week~ after the Cotton Bowl and a Fighting Irish team again played the role of g.Iant killer. The UCLA Brums, c_Qllege basketball's premier team, came to the Convo with an umblemished record. They left with the only defeat they were to suffer during a season in which they racked up the school's fifth straight NCAA hoop crown. 
But ~~at Saturday in South Bend, the Irish were number 1. Another truly great moment in Irish sports history. When the clock read 0:00 the Irish had won 89-82 and their delirious fans poured out onto the court to swarm their heroes. 
Twice within a month Notre Dame teams had reached heights of glory never bettered by any other Irish club. Twice in a month we were priviliged to see sports history in the making. 
And in the first week of February the Notre Dame hockey team, in only its third year of existencE upset Denver 4-2. The Pioneers went on to finish second in the NCAA hockey championships and the victory by Coach "Lefty" Smith's charges proved justhowfarthe Irish hockey program had come in three years. 
One can look back on these triumphs with pride. Yet one feels a tinge of regret, too, because so many of the young men who played important roles in the athletic dramas of the past year have played their final game for the Blue and Gold. 
Some of the finest athletes in Notre Dame history will graduate this June. 
Although injured much of the season, Larry DiNardo, perhaps as no other athlete this year, was a perfect Notre Dame man. Co-captain of the '70 eleven, DiNardo was a two-time All American guard and an honor student. An instructional film on on how to play guard could be compiled from the game films of Larry D. 
And skinny number 7. That gutsy kid who had come off the bencb as a sophomore to quarterback the Irish to a tie with the national champion So. Cal. Trojans. Joe Theismann started 25 games at quarterback for the Fighting Irish and led his team to a record of 20 wins, three losses and two ties. And their first Bowl victory since the days of the Four Horsemen. The South River Roadrunner also surpassed Hanratty and the immortal Gipper in the N.D. record book. 
For the past three years, Irish basketball fans have been privileged to watch the greatest player in Notre Dame history. Austin Carr rewrote the record book during his years at Notre Dame and put the Irish in the national basketball limelight. 
Austin's shot, his moves, were things of beauty. Not only a fabulous basketball player, Austin was a wonderful person. Softspoken and ever so modest, Austin was a leader to his teammates. As captain-elect Doug Gemmell remarked, "When Austin says "Let's go!", you feel like jumping through the roof". 
And there was Collis Jones. Collis never missed an Irish basketball game. Although he played in Carr's shadow, Jones became a star in his own right. Like my Dad, a knowledgable basketball man, says, "Carr is in a class by himself but a guy like Jones can play on any body's team too." 
El Sid. I only talked with Sidney Catlett once but I wish I had the chance to get to know him. He's a sensitive, warm, individual and a fine basketball player. The.fans loved Sidney. 
The first of what will undoubtedly become a long list of Irish hockey stars leaves the du Lac campus in a couple of weeks. Phil Witliff owns just about every scoring mark in the Notre Dame record book right now. Phil was with the icers when they were a club team and he captained them when they played, and beat, the bestoppositionthe country had to offer. Witliff has carved his place in Notre Dame hockey lore. 
Then there's Tommy Ciaccio. A name a lot of sports fans on campus may not even recognize. But little Tom (he never weighed wmore than 126 pounds during wrestling season) has won more wrestling matches than any grappler in Irish history. I won't forget Tommy. 
Nor will I forget my favorite cheerleader, Molly Tiernan. It's going to be a lot harder to fill that little lassie's uniform than Joe Theismann's. Be still my beating heart! 
There are so many other seniors who have contributed so much to Notre Dam's athletic prowess during their years here. There's Gary Kos, Tim Kelly, John Pleick Charlie Horan Tom Sinnott Rick Wohlhuter, Phil Krill, and Scotty Hempel. There are guys like Ja~kie Meehan and John Roselli, Tom Eaton, Chuck Zloch, Jim Hinga and a fellow named Pete Schivarelli. And there are many others that I havent mentioned. All of them are fine athletes and fine men. 
Then there are the seniors who chronicled the happenings of the Irish athletes in the Observer and the Scholastic. Terry O'Neil, a first rate sportswriter, second to none on this campus will receive his diploma in in June, along with Mike Pavlin, my first boss at the Observer. ' 
And a _wonderful guy named Terry Shields, who preceded me as sports editor, will be picking up his sheepskm, too. If he had spent the time studying that he did putting out a sports page he'd have graduated cum laude. A more dedicatedt sincere, hard-working guy you couldn't find. Everyone who comes to Notre Dame should be lucky enough to make a friend like Terry Shield. 
I've just about run out of memories now. And out of space, too. 
You know, it really ha.s been a great year.
