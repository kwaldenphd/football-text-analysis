N. VIets To Consider Deescalatlon 
PARIS (UPI)-Hanoi's chief spokesman in Paris said Wednesday North Vietnam is prepared to discuss the withdrawal of troops from South Vietnam as soon as the expanded Paris negotiations get underway. 
Spokesman Nguyen Thanh Lc was commenting on Tuesday's Washington statement by Defense Secretary Clark M. Clifford that the United States and North Vietnam could start withdrawing their troops within 40 days, or before President Johnson leaves office. 
"The Americans will be able to raise this and any other question." 
Lc said the issue of withdrawal of troops from South Vietnam had not been discussed so far in U.S. North Vietnamese talks seeking to set up rroccdural rules that would permit the long delayed conference to begin. 

North Vietnam has never even admitted it has troops fighting in South Vietnam and some observers believed the statement of readiness to di~cuss Clifford's suggestions might mean Hanoi merely was ready to d1scuss the pullout of U.S. troops. 
North Vietnam, however, was believed to have withdrawn some troops from the South as a goodwill gesture following the U.S. bombing halt Nov. I. hut this has never been officially confirmed. 
The North Vietnamese spokesman coupled his statement with a new blast at the United States, claiming the U.S. Air Force has repeatedly violated President Johnson's bombing halt order in carrying out both reconnaissance flights and bonbing attacks on the North. 
Lc claimed that between Nov. 2 and this Monday, the Air Force carried our 600 reconnaissance nights. He also charged that U.S. artillery sduth of Jhe Demilitarized Zone has been shelling North Vietnamese territory.

Warmed by the Christmas cheer and merriment, I've slept these past few nights with visions of sugarplums etc. dancing in my head. Early this morning, however, I was jarred from my sleep by the clinking sounds of chains being dragged across my room and the eerie appearance of a mysterious visitor-the Ghost of Notre Dame 
!1uturc. 
Through some sort of supernatural media we blurred by the years and arrived in 2001 (my ND Odyssey). The view from the Dome, while immediately startling, was still strangely familiar... 
... After a 50 year struggle the Holy Cross brothers have finally gained complete control of the Board ofTrustecs.Rome applauded the victory. Meanwhile the pope issued two brilliant statements on contemporary affairs, "if men were meant to fly they would have been born with wings" and "2349 angels can dance on the head of a pin." The remarks were not made ex cathedra, but rather ex post facto. Church officials everywhere are perplexed ... 
...SUMMA is racing into its final phase ... 
... The final addition to the cluster college complex has been announced and Princeton will move up to South Bend over the next six months. This marks the seventh men's university to surround St. Mary's, and should increase the social odds significantly. Still, a rumor cirulatcs that "half of the SMC girls stay home each weekend." Maybe someone is trying to say something ... 
.. .In a bold and imaginative thrust, the administration staged a sit-in in the SDS building backing the drive for curtailed theology and philosophy requirements. The SDS complained bitterly ... 
...In order to decrease Playboy on campus the university has ordered that the Scholastic insert one nude fold-out in each issue. Editor Patrick O'Michael Connor beamed at the decision ... 
... A Sophomore Y car Abroad in South Bend will begin next year ... ... Chris Murphy just retired after 30 years of heading the ND Travel Bureau ... ... The Studebaker has been hailed as "Car of the Future" in Canada ... 
...The SLC has finally finished preliminary arrangements and will turn to the issue of parietals at their next meeting. Great hope and confidence have been placed in this body ... 
... Meanwhile Univerity President HAL, a former actor, h'as been programmed to reject any petitions for parietal hours and repeatedly spurts out the coded message "there will not be girls in the dorms as

"The Watch" 
A countn folks style Christmas story in the big city. 
lllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~=JIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII~III.IIIIIIiJitlll 
Christmas had always been a special season for Maureen and Bill. Their small apartment on 14th Street always seemed warmer during the holidays, their food always seemed to taste better, and their Jove for each other and for their child seemed to grow stronger. They would exchange presents on Christmas eve, never anything expensive, but each would revel over the small gift as if it were the frankincense and myrhh of the wise men. 
One Saturday afternoon shortly before this Christmas, Maureen took her son, young Billy, uptown to shop for presents. They went into several of the large and classier department stores on Park and Fifth avenues, but only to window shop, for Maureen knew that she couldn't afford anything in those stores. Strangely, Billy hadn't been asking for anything and everything that he saw. He seemed to be waiting for just the right gift at just the right moment. 
Leaving the high price worlds of Fifth Avenue, they travelled over to Macy's on 34th street and Sixth. This was more in Maureen's price league, 
and also Macy's had a Santa Claus who could extort from Billy his inner-most wishes. Sitting up on the old man's knee Billy was frightened and reserved as most children are at that time, but 
when  asked  what  he  wanted for  Christmas, he  
replied clearly  and  with  decision,  "  a  watch."  
Maureen  was  relieved,  for  she  quickly  

envisioned a six dollar Mickey Mouse special, but when touring the jerelry counter, Billy firmly pointed to a seventy dollar Swiss timepiece as if he had had this one picked out from the start. Maureen smiled at this naieve dream, and although it might have been due to her maternal affection and wish to please, it seemed to her that there was something about Billy's demeanor which signified that this was the only watch acceptable, and that a watch could be the only gratifying gift. For a moment Maureen was upset because of her delimma, but soon she and Billy were walking off, the Mickey Mouse special being the only seemingly possible solution. 
Several days later Maureen still had not purchased young Billy his present. She had tried to buy the inexpensive watch a few times, but here memory of Billy's attitude towards the Swiss watch paralyzed her from making the more economical purchase. Her husband had questioned her in passing about what gift they were to give 

the child, but she had shrugged him off and said 
that she would find something. 
Christmas eve came, and not having found an 
answer to the problem, Marueen found herslef 
again at Macy's looking at the key to her boy's 
happiness. The crowd was huge, in typical fashion 
for this time of year in New York department 
stores, and several times Maureen was pushed 
practically on top of the desired object. She knew 
that she did not, nor would not ever have the 
money for such an extravagance, no matter how 
much the desire. Yet there was one way, and the 
next time that the crowd surged, Maureen grabbed 
the swiss watch off the counter and quickly 
stuffed it into her purse. 
She headed for the door, dreaming of what a 
wonderful Christmas it would be,and getting just 
beyond the portal, breathed a sigh of happiness 
and relief, when suddenly, a man grabbed her by 
the arm and wheeled her roughly around. Maureen 
felt her heart sink, for the ignominy of being 
caught as a thief, and the reality of jail and 
separating from her family seemed to be 
imminent, but the man had only mistaken 
Maureen for his wife, and si1e was still free. 
When she got home, her husband was waiting for her and asked her if she had as yet bought a present for young Billy. Maureen begged the question, somewhat ashamed and still not certain of how to explain her new treasure. Jubilantly, Bill interrupted to tell her that the boy had told him that a watch was what he wished for, and took from] her that the boy had told him that a watch was what he wished for, and took from out of his pocket one with Hopalong Cassidy printed on the fact that he has just purchased just this evening at a local drugstore. After this revelation Maureen spent some time debating her new problem. Soon however, she had the stolen watch wrapped and ready to be mailed back to Macy's, wiili a nameless explanatory note enclosed. 
Young Billy paraded around the apartment this Christmas eve, ineffably happy with his new Hoppy watch, and Maureen and Bill made great fusses over ties, handkerchiefs and perfume. Maureen had no idea whether the apartment seemed warmer, or that the food tasted better, or that their love grew stronger because one watch had been discarded and another given, not did she care. She was happy in the love of her family.
