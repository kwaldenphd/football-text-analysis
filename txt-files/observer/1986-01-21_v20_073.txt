In Brief 
The campus computer store, which is now vacant due to the financial problems of General Micro, will have a new company take its place, said Roger Schmitz, dean of engineering. Schmitz, who also serves as assistant to the provost for computers, said they expect to have a new company within two weeks. He said various alternatives are under consideration. Among them is the ac­tual location of the store. The old store, located in the basement of LaFortune, was occupied by General Micro, a national computer supply company specializingin Apple products. When they declared bankruptcy in December oflast year, they were forced to close the campus store. Schmitz said the replacementcompany "will no doubt handle a broader range ofproducts, in addition to Apple." He said he . was reluctant to give many more specifics because all the al­ternatives have yet to be explored. But he said that a new company will be found. · The Observer 
Heavy snowfall of up to 17 inches hit parts of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania unexpectedly early yesterday, cut­ting electrical service to nearly 50,000 customers, closing schools and snarling morning traffic. "Snow was expected but the amount of snow that fell was unexpected," said National Weather Service forecaster Jerry Orchanian in Charleston, W.Va. "We've had acci­dents all over the place," said Pennsylvania state Trooper Richard Marshall in Greensburg, Pa. The weather contributed to two Pen­nsylvania traffic deaths, police said. -AP 

Eastern Airlines said yesterday it will lay off 1,010 flight attendants and cut the pay and privileges of the remaining 6,000 in an effort to ward offcreditors' threats to declare default on its $2.5 billion debt. The attendants' union said an "all-out war" had been declared. "It is absolutely essential to get this company back on the financial footing it needs," said company President Joseph Leonard, adding that Eastern hopes to eventually recall the fur­loughed attendants. Eastern will maintain its flight schedule, he said. Earlier this month, Eastern's creditors ordered the Miami-based airline to get major labor concessions or face default on its $2.5 billion debt to about 60 lenders, including Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank and a number of European banks. Eastern's $6.3 million profit last year was its first since 1979. Eastern Chairman Frank Bor­man said the airline has lost $335.5 million since 1960. -AP

Chicago deserves to celebrate after 'bearing' difficult times 
All right. Forget from what part of the country you are. Just consider this question carefully and answer it truthfully. 
What city ~eally deserves a Super Bowl victory Sun­day? 
The answer, if you are really honest, is of course, Chicago. And this is not stated after considering who has the best players, offense, defense, etc. Some of us don't even pretend to be knowledgable about the technical aspects ofthe game. 
No, even people who hate the Bears, call them ar­rogant, and would like to see the destruction of every copy of "The Super Bowl Shuftle," must agree that Chicago has fallen under hard times as far as its image lately. More than whatever city the Patriots hail from, Chicago needs something to go right. 
Perhaps only a native of the Chicago area can really understand. But to help, pick up a copy of today's Chicago Tribune. There you can most likely read about the latest city official in­dicted in the recent FBI un­dercover investigation of suspected corruption in Chicago government. 
The latest "victim," Cir­cuit Court Clerk Morgan Finley was allegedly paid S25,000 from an under­cover FBI agent posing as a businessman, in return for his efforts in discrediting a rival business. 
Then of course, there is Operation Greylord, now well over a year old. Several judges are still waiting in line to be tried for bribery and various other crimes, such as fixing tickets for drunk drivers. The highest ranking judge of the circuit court, Richard LeFevour, just began his 12 year jail term in Kentucky. 
Add that to a City Council that hasn't agreed on anything for about four years and the embarrassment of having lost the Second City title, and you've got a city that deserves to celebrate in bars well into Monday morning. 
Patriots fans will point to the blatant selling of the Super Bowl, most of it using Bears players, who are milking this long-coveted moment in advertisements for all they're worth. 
Well, making money, legally and illegally, is what prominent Chicagoans like to do best. Recent events have proven that. The Bears are capitalizing on the Super Bowl just the way any normal Chicago per­sonality would: blatantly, quickly, and for as much as they can make. 
Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko wrote yes­terday that he belives the rest of the country pities

Chicago, a city that's been sitting around and waiting for a national championship from someone for years. 
That doesn't seem to hold true at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. For every proud Chicagoan, there's a sneering East coast native. However, it's interesting to note that many ofthose Patriots fans will head to bars in Chicago to watch the game, where hopefully they'll be quickly discovered. Too bad about those Indiana liquor laws. Watching the game in a South Bend bar would be a little less dangerous. 
Meanwhile, Chicago has five days left to enjoy its day in the sun. And no other city could enjoy this week so much. Today the city's Ric­hard J. Daley Center will be temporarily renamed Bears Plaza as a video screen will play highlights ofthe season. Fans will be able to have their pictures taken with cutouts of their favorite players. Sunday before the game a pep rally will precede a broadcast of the game to the crowd. And ac­cording to costume retailers, bear outfits, black sunglasses and blue greasepaint are selling out. 

Whether the team wins or not, the city will settle down to business Tuesday (after Monday's ticker tape parade). But this past week, Chicago got a shot of great publicity that even its citizens appreciated. Hopefully attention focused in that direction will be turned to everything else the city has to offer. 
So for those who still are not convinced that Chicago deserves to win Sunday, maybe the fact that the Bears are favored by ten-and-a-halfover the Patriots may help. 
I didn't want to have to resort to that kind of persua­sion.

Taking away the car parking privileges ofchronic traffic violators was among the topics discussed at the joint meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Governance and Program· mlng Board last night.

Citing lack of student help on weekends, difficulties with assigning overtime to librarians, and availability of resources for over· night use, Kollman announced that library hours would not be ex· tended, per student requests.

TRIPOLI, Ubya · All Ubyan high school students are required to un· dergo Intensive military training that includes preparation for pos· sible suicide missions, the military commander of a boys' school said yesterday. 
Agroup of Western reporters was taken to All Awarith High School In downtown Tripoli, where they watched uniformed students per· form military drills and firing ex· ercises with four Soviet-designed, BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. 
One of the students was Seifeddin Khadafy, the 13-year·old eldest son of Colonel Moammar Khadafy, the Ubyan leader who has warned that suicide squads would strike in the United States and Israel if the two ever attack this country.

The first of those three shops is The Irish Gardens Flower Shop, which will be located in the northwest corner of the basement. This is the only store returning from the old group of shops which resided In the basement last year. 
The second shop managed by the SAB will be named The Ticket Stub. According to Hoover, this shop wiU deal only with ticket related events. "Last year," Hoover noted, "we had a lot of trouble at Roc du Lac whenever a bigconcert was In town. The ticket lines would be so long that people in the shop who wanted to buy records would end up going somewhere else to buy their records rather than wait in those lines. As a result, we didn't sell too many records." 
The Ticket Stub Is also consider· ing selling tickets to concerts In the surrounding area and also to events in Chicago, but these plans are stiii tentative, according to Hoover.

The reporters were not allowed to question the students In· dividually, but the demonstration II· lustrated the increasing militarization of Ubyan society un· der Khadafy's rule. 
The school's military commander, Major Saeed Ali Awedat, told reporters that all Ubyan secondary students · both girls and boys · un· dergo two hours of military training a week as a compulsory part of their <·urriculum. The training also In· eludes one month during each sum· mer vacation. 
Asked whether the students also train for the suicide commando mis· sions that Khadafy has threatened to launch against the United States and Israel, Awedat replied: 
"Yes. All Ubyans are training for suicide missions. We are all ready to launch such operations. 
The Cellar, the third shop to be run by the SAB, will be mainly a record store. "What The Cellar will be geared toward is college lis· teners.

Ex-prisoners to live off -campus with students in ND, SMC project 

By LYNNE R. STRAND 
Staff Reporter 
In August of 1986, 10 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students will be able to move into adowntown South Bend home with several former In­diana prisoners. 
This house, sponsored by the Dis­mas of Michiana, is a local answer to "one ofthe biggest social problems," said FatherJack Hickey. 
Hickey, the founder of the first Dismas house in Nashville, em­phasized that "a house without the students wouldn't be the same. There will be a big impact on academia which might help some (former prisoners) on their voca­tional choices. It will be a learning experience." 
"It's a chance to dosomething for someone else," noted Jim Roemer, director ofcommunity relations. 
According to Roemer, the benefits for prisoners include "immediately coming out of prison to live with youngpeople, beingpart of a community and family, having good conversations about the world, attaining writing skills and jobs, and seeing wonderful personal examples." 
"There are also as many benefits for the students," continued Roemer. "Students can live off­campus with a purpose, know what's going on in the community, and

don't see how this has anythingto do with anything we do," he said. 
"This is a Board ofTrustees matter and I don't think we should be in­volved with it at all," Ginty said. "I think we should be directing the energy of the people here to other things." 
Kevin Howard, Hall President's Council chairman, said students should try to inlluence the Board of Trustees. "If there was a majority (favoring divestment) it would get on the A.P. (Associated Press) and make national news. It would be an embarrassment to Notre Dame. We could try to force their (the Boardof Trustees) hand," Howard said. 
"I don't thinkwe should come out 
with things like these that insinuate 
the Board of Trustees are bad 

band together for someone else. The 
students won't mind working with 
former students." 

The community will also benefit from the Dismas house, said Roemer. "Prisons are revolving doors which only costs the com­munity more. Most prisoners only learn to be better criminals." 
"Most people don't think about what happens when priSoners are let out," said Jane Anne Riedford, a Dis­mas house student group leader. "There are really no decent programs to bring them back into the community. 'Ex-convict' is a ter­rible term to carry when looking for a job. No wonder prisoners are back in after six months. 
"Prison in itself couldn't reform anyone," Riedford said. 
"Statistics say that prisoners with families don't go back to crime," said Kathy Royer, coordinator for service/social action groups at the Center for Social Concerns. 
Ideally, an equal number of men and women will be accepted into the Dismas house, Roemer said. He also noted that the prisoners will not be released early from prison and they are screened out for any sexual offenses. "There never have been major problems like assault and bat­tery in the other two Dismas houses located in Nashville and Memphis," Roemer said 
The Dismas house is "a nice

people," said Ginty. I don't think we should make them look had." 
Steve Taeyaens, student senator, disagreed with Ginty. "I don't think we're trying to make them look bad. We're trying to give them some in­put into their future decisions," he said. 
The senate also changed student government election rules to allow non-monetary, public endorsments from student leaders and official or­ginazitions. Previously, such endors­ments were forbidden. 
Duane Lawrence, student body vice president, introduced the change saying "the people who are most informed ·on the issues should be allowed to say one way or anot­her who they favor." 
Ginty didn't think the rule needed to be changed. He said that although he didn't know why the rule was in­stalled, there must have been a good re;150n. "I don't think :mnmt· !Ja, 
residential home in South Bend's finest neighborhood at the turn of the century," noted Roemer. "The house's construction is beautiful and livable. It will be fixed up to very fine standards," Riedford said. 
Near downtown, the house is a 1 0 minute car ride or a 15 to 20 minute bus ride to both campuses. A car may be supplied, "so a student doesn't have to own a car," noted Hickey. 
"The house will be cheaper than a dorm," said Riedford. Each occupant will pay $21 0 per month. There will be one student and one prisoner to each room. Breakfast and dinner will be provided by community families Monday through Friday. All dinners are mandatory, Riedford said. 
The Dismas house project was in­itiated by Notre Dame student, Carol Gales, who spent her Summer Service Project at the Nashville Dis­mas house. A local businessman, T. Brooks Brademas and a group of in­vestors are financing the purchase and construction of the house. 
Hickey will be visiting numerous classes this week to recruit students. Applicants will be interviewed next week and be notified oftheir accep­tance by March 21, he said. 
Hickey noted that the Center for 
Social Concerns  will  hold  an  in­

With saDctions, America acts as Isreal's puppet 
Imagine standing in the Vienna airport on Dec. 27. You and your family are preparing to return from a joyful holiday visit. Standing at the T.W.A. baggage counter, you are patiently waiting to check your luggage while you laugh about the memories of another en­joyable holiday season spent in Austria. Sud­denly, you see several masked men burst through the front doors and point their machine guns at you, your family and your fel­low passengers. 
BillKrais 
save the whales 
Five minutes later the floor is splattered with blood; bystanders fall to the ground in hysterics; others hide their faces in horror. In just a couple of minutes, what was once a pleasant holiday scene has turned into a dreadful bloody massacre. Your blissful feelings of minutes ago have been fatally inter­rupted by a reckless band ofterrorists. 
Yet again terrorists have struck in a seemingly indiscriminate manner, consider­ing no one an innocent bystander. This is a crisis of epidemic proportions which is puz­zling world governments. World govern­ments are scratching their heads in bewilderment, because it seems that much of the Western world is being held hostage. Everyone is asking himself the same question: "What can be done?" 
As expected, President Reagan has proposed a precarious resolution: he has decided upon economic sanctions against Libya. There are two evident problems with this solution. First, it assumes that Libya is guilty for all terrorist activity. The State Department itself said the evidence against Libya is "circumstantial." It does not seem to be prudent public policy to aggravate rela­tions with the Arab world over "circumstantial" evidence. Second, as the United States' Western allies have astutely pointed out, economic sanctions do not work under these circumstances. . Critics of Reagan's decision point to former President Carter's grain embargo of the Soviet Union, imposed after the invasion ofMghanistan. The only loser then was the American farmer. 
In actuality, European allies have much to lose by imposing economic sanctions against Libya. Italy alone exports over S2 billion worth of goods to Libya; the Italian economy would be greatly affected by such sanctions. Overall, European exports to Libya total SB billion. Certainly Europe's hesitancy toward sanctions must be considered economical!Y· The United States has little to lose and little to gain by imposing sanctions against Libya; neit­her is dependent upon the other's business. So Reagan's proposal achieves no significant solution. It irritates an unstable government, Libya, and it isolates the United States, as no allies have rushed to Reagan's side. 
Why then does the United States become involved in the first place? The terrorist strike was intended for Israelis, not for Americans. And while five Americans were killed in the massacre, citizens of other countries were gunned down as well. So, why does the United States get involved? Is the United States simply a puppet of Israel, or is Reagan truly seeking justice? I must believe that the former is true. The Israelis whined and whimpered for a couple of days; they expressed disappoint­ment at the world's failure to join their call for revenge. After some arm twisting, Reagan and company rushed once again to Israel's rescue, changed their philosophy cohcerning this particular incident, and again assumed the role ofworld policemen. 
Even if it was politically proper for the United States to become involved, it has chosen inappropriate means for achieving its ends. Nevertheless, a policy of economic sanctions against Libya, whether or not it is responsible for fostering terrorism, is not bad in itself. Libya has proven itself economically unreliable and politcally unstable. Very few benefits can be derived by the United States from transactions with Libya. 
The fear I have, however, is the United States will go beyond economic sanctions and react militarily, either by itself or via Israel. European allies are not even willing to impose sanctions; they would certainly scoff at any proposal which involves a military solution. Again, the United States would isolate itself and may even prompt a maniacal world leader to respond. And his response promises to be shattering, for his provocations already have been. 
You may say, even ifthe Libyans are not sup­porting these terrorists, someone is, and something must be done. I could not agree more. We must work together to stop these senseless and random slayings of apparently innocent men and women. Yes, we must work together; we must negotiate with them. Even if it means Reagan has to swallow his pride, the United States government and other govern­ments which have been the targets ofsuch at­tacks must sit down with terrorist leaders and negotiate reasonable settlements with them. 
For instance, I am convinced that this sum­mer's hijacking of the commercial flight from Athens to Rome, whose path wa..o; diverted to both Algiers and Beirut, could have been avoided had Israel and the terrorists tried to reach a settlement. Their demands were reasonable; they wanted 700 prisoners who were being detained by the Israelis for no ap­parent reason to be released. Israel balked and the terrorists reacted. And they reacted violently, allegedly killing one man. But that murder was a message to world leaders. With that murder, the terrorists said, "Look, we have demands too, and we want them met, just like you guys; but you refuse to listen to us. Okay, so now you will listen, especially if it is one of your own whose life is on the line." And with a sneer and a pull of the trigger, a man fell dead to the ground, all because world governments, particularly those of Israel and the United States, would not listen. 
Economic sanctions, military maneuvers; these are not the answers. The United States and other countries must bring themselves to negotiate with these people and hope that peaceful settlements will result. Isn't swallow­ing a little pride and granting several conces­sions -like the release of700 prisoners held by Israel for no reason -a small price to pay when 
the  lives  of  innocent  people  arc  at  risk  
worldwide?

P.O.BoxQ 
Democracy will put halt to apartheid dissenters 
Dear Editor: 
"Nonetheless, everyone rejects this posi­tion and St. Thomas justifiably calls it stupid." 
Luis de Molina; Concordia 
Chris Edwards' recent column reminded me of my all-time favorite response to a philosophical argument, that given by Luis de Molina above. I believe that there are many rea..<;t>ns why Edwards' arguments may jus­tltlably be called stupid, but I also believe his remarks may justifiably be called irrespon­sible, callous and just plain illogical. 
To begin with, Edwards proclaims that it is clear to everyone that the blacks in South Africa do not deserve freedom from the in­stitutional injustice ofapartheid because they arc such miserable failures in so many ways. 
He points to their inability to make their 
"homelands" pay economically, to their in­
abilities to maintain their own health and to 
their inept management of their own educa­
tion. The implication ofthis argument is, quite 
plainly, that freedom should not be granted to 
blacks until they meet the conditions he stip­
ulates. This position seems to me to be par­ticularly vile. The basic human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not belong only to humans that are economically efficient. Rather, these rights belong to all humans because they are human. When one makes such basic rights conditional, one im­mediately excludes some people. This exclu­sion of a group of people from rights due to them by their very nature is a serious in­justice. Edwards argues for the continuation of this injustice of exclusion which lies at the heart of apartheid by arguing for conditional freedom. 
Later in his column, Edwards condemns the "black side" for the supposed widespread cus­tom of"neckery." Only two paragraphs later, he speaks highly ofthe South African army as a great army fighting for a righteous cause. He does not mention that through all of its righteous support of the South African government, the army has ldlled thousands of people. His statement that this army's actions are righteous and further incredible state­ments that the South African government is a democracy and that the law forcing black South Africans to carry identification cards is 
really an effort to. protect the jobs of these blacks show Edwards to be irresponsibly one­sided on the issue ofapartheid. One wonders where he gets his information; one wonders if he is actually serious in what he writes; one wonders how a Notre Dame student could hold such an irresponsible and if I may state my personal opinion, stupid position. 
South Africa a democracy, indeed. 
joe Merchant Grace Hall 

Argument on apartheid showed author's bias 
Dear Editor: 
Chris Edwards' recent guest column was so full of misinformation about South Africa that even an apologist for that nation's history and system of apartheid would probably not care to use Edwards' views in a debate among literate persons. 
Webster defines democracy as a "government by the people; rule of the majority; a government h which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a sys­tem of representation usually Involving periodically held free elections." When Ed­wards is able to demonstrate that South Africa operates by these standards, then there will no longer be a need for "people who support the blacks in their drive to end apartheid."

esc programs offer a new view of world 
The future is of primary concern to people who live and work in the academic world, The goal of stu­dents is to prepare for "life". As stu­dents move through the tangle of intellectual pursuits they sometimes forget that while they are "preparing" they are also living. They love and laugh. They are able to find time for parties and dates bet­ween the long nights with the books. They ponder the large questions of life while muddling through such details as laundry and roommate problems. It is clear that one cannot wait to live, and the best preparation for life is risking involvement. 
Fortunately, here in the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community we have an opportunity to integrate the preparation for life with involve­ment in the real nitty gritty issues that life presents. Through the Center for Social Concerns there are a variety ofservice/social action op­portunities available -over 24 or­ganizations both on and off campus have tailored programs to suit in­volvement by students. 
Some programs demand as little as one night a semester while offering students a new view of the world. Other opportunities are more demanding. They range from working with children to visiting older adults; from repairing the houses of the poor and elderly to of­fering CPR instruction and an oppor­tunity to donate blood. Some programs offer students an oppor­tunity to take stands and make state­ments about issues that are important. Some of the service/social action opportunities are organized and regular. Others are one time events that happen in response to an urgent need. Sometimes there is just the place for one student to work in one special area or with one special person. 
The exciting and invigorating ef. feet of these opportunities is that it enables members of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community to break out of the protective bubble that surrounds those who are "preparing" for life and allows the wonderful,. frightening living world to invade and color that preparation. 

Helpline offers hope 
Through Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns and the program HELPLINE, several engineering stu­dents from the University worked together to aid a paraplegic who needed an access ramp built in his home. In two days, the students built and painted the ramp, contributing halfof the cost of the materials. 
The connection for the aid was made through HELPLINE, a com­munity service established for the purpose of helping people find aid by assisting them in defining their problem and providing resources and options for clients as possible solutions. 
Concerned students, like these engineers, are volunteering their time and talents by applying them to this community. In doing so, they are becoming a valuable resource for HELPLINE's clients, providing the aid that they need and cannot get through any other agency or or­ganization. 
This is one example of how the Center's Service/Social Action Group Coordinator, Kathy Royer, through contact with a community agency, has been able to direct stu­dents into a satisfying productive service activity.

Big Brothers/ Big Sisters 
Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is a non-profit social service organization primarily funded by the Notre Dame Student Activities Board, in conjunction with the United Way of St. Joseph County. 
Big Brothers/Big Sisters directly addresses the needs of a youngster in the South Bend community who is experiencing uncomfortable · "growing pains." These youngsters demonstrate a need for some kind of adult companionship, to supple­ment those within the home. It is here that Big Brothers/Big Sisters makes a match. The purpose is to es­tablish a one-to-one relationship to provide the child with the guidance and friendship needed. 
Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's provides a setting in which the student and the child can meet and enjoy them­selves. Activities range from cookouts to rollerskating parties, and add some flavor to the personal meeting the student and child ex­perience on their own. 
The Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program represents all back­grounds. What all big brothers and sisters share is a · desire to help children through their loneliness, confusion and boredom of youth at adolescence. Each student and child duo is matched based on interests, backgrounds, personalities and general compatibility. Tilis es­tablishes the foundation for a growing friendship. 
The gift of shared time and friendship can last a lifetime, and the price is just a few hours a week. Please share the experience with us 

Fun and Learn 
The Fun and Learn Program is a recreation/socialization program for six to 16 year-old children who are experiencing difficulties in school. The children have learning disabilities in any or all ofthe follow­ing areas: reading. writing. math, memory, coordination, comprehen­sion, controlling behavior, organiz­ing. attention span, speech, team work, making friends and social skills. The program seeks to develop self-confidence and self-esteem; and to challenge children physically and mentally through recreational ac­tivities. It is not a tutorial program. 
Three program teachers plan ac­tivities which focus on the following concepts. RECREATION -team work and cooperation. SOCIAUZA­TION -appropriate behaviors, per­sonal interaction with volunteers. AFFECTIVE -communication, ac­ceptance oflimitations, coping. The children are divided into two groups, by age, to better meet their specific needs and interests. Volun­teers are needed every Saturday from 9 to 11:30 a.m. to support and work with the children as they at­tempt to develop these skills. (Located on Saint Mary's campus, transportation from Notre Dame is provided.) 

Red Cross 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Branch of the American Red Cross became an official organization in 1981 and is under the jurisdiction of the St. joseph County Chapter ofthe American Red Cross. The branch currently has 45 members serving the ND/SMC community in a variety of ways. First, we provide first-aid stations for both varsity and non­varsity sports, and for certain other events such as An Tostal and the Domer Runs. At these events, first-aiders are present to handle injuries and assist people in any way pos· sible. In addition to providing first­aid stations, the branch operates its unique ·"Quick Response Squ:td." Using our blue van in conjunction with Notre Dame Security, we are able to respond to mt;dical emer­gencies on campus between the hours of 6 and 11 p.m. and to provide non-emergency transporta­tion to the hospital ifnecessary. 
The ND/SMC Branch also is available for any disaster relief services that may be needed in the St. joseph County area. 
Lastly, the ND/SMC Branch provides first-aid training in all areas of lifesaving, in~luding CPR, stan­dard and advanced' First Aid and Water Safety. 

literacy Center 
The Uteracy Center, located in St. Paul's Memorial United Methodist Church, 1001 West Colfax, began this September to provide illiterate adults with an opportunity to ac­quire basic learning skills -reading, writing, spelling and math. 
The assistance ofNotre Dame and Saint Mary's volunteers in this program has been invaluable. The patient, persevering work of these volunteers with individuals has been admirable and has contributed greatly to the forward thrust of the program. 
Because of schedule changes, some ofstudents will not find it pos­sible to volunteer second semester. No doubt, other generous social­minded students will replace them. 
Classes at the Center are held from 1-3 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Interested students may volunteer for one of these days. The van leaves from the Ubrary entrance at 1:15. If interested, call Sister Marita or Sister Evodine at 259-5427 beforr 9 p.m. 


SAVE 
Student Advocate Volunteers for the Elderly is a service organization that helps meet the needs of the el­derly in the South Bend area. The primary work ofSAVE for the last 1 0 years has been to visit the lonely el­derly, although in many cases SAVE volunteers have cleaned houses, shoveled snow and done yard work and other miscellaneous odd jobs. 
Because of the diverse needs of the elderly, SAVE offers a warm, rewarding experience to any person who has a desire to help others. 
Students benefit by working through an organization that is part of the Center for Gerontological Education, Research and Services. This offers the volunteers awealth of information, giving them insight into society as well as valuable train­ing to experience the elderly effi­ciently. 
Legal Services 

The Legal Services Program of Northern Indiana is a private non­profit corporation providing free legal representation to low income individuals in northern Indiana. Legal Services assists people who cannot afford a private attorney with legal problems in areas such as housing, public benefits, consumer, health and family law. Sever funding cutbacks forced Legal Service to restructure the client interview sys­tem as to provide maximum legal representation with minimum per­sonnel. Volunteer intake workers now conduct these client inter­views.· 
Volunteers are trained to record background information for statisti­cal purposes and financial informa­tion for eligibility purposes. The, and most importantly, the volunteer listens to the client's statements and capsulizes the legal problem into a narrative for a staff attorney to review. Nearly all of the interview­ing done by volunteers is over the telephone. 
Being a volunteer with Legal Services is interesting and challeng­ing work full of. learning oppor­tunities.

Juveniles between the ages of 12 and 17 are required to at­tend this four week session in which they hear from respected com­munity leaders and converse in small discussion groups. This program is unique in that in most areas of the country, juveniles will merely receive a slap on the wrist for their offense. Through the clinic, they will hopefully become more aware of the harmful effects of shoplifting on both themselves and the community. 

Thomas More 
The Thomas Mon· Sr>ot·t~ of Notre Dame was founded to promote understanding of More's principles,ideals and standards in everyday life. The society serves as a forum for research, education, and discussion to foster an awareness and appreciation of More and of Christian humanism he advanced. Since Notre Dame shares in More's Catholic Heritage, The Thomas Mores Society studies the wisdom of Roman Catholicism, a wisdom More valued so highly that he upheld theses principles with his very life. 
The Society sponsors regular 
seminars on some contemporary 
issues studied inlight of Catholic 
principles and lectures on some 
aspect of More's life. Through active 
community services, members of 
the society also teach catechism in

Each AAS squaddron plans their own activities in accordance with these projects. This year, the Ben­jamin D. Foulois Squadron, here at Notre Dame, is very active in all projects. The members have written letters to their congressmen (in ac­cordance with the JNP), have been attending Cardinal Nursing Home bi-weekly, helping run such ac­tivities as Oktoberfest and Bingo Nights and have been visiting the Boys' Club weekly, involving the kids in arts & crafts, sports and cheerleading.

NSHP 
The Neighborhood Study Help Program is the largest volunteer service organization on the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's campuses. We tutor South Bend area school children from kindergarden to the high school level. Each tutor is as­signed one child. The tutor visits the tutoring site twice each week for ap­proximately one hour. This program allows Notre Dame Saint Mary's stu­dents to help children academically as well as socially and emotionalyy. Ttors work at helping the children develop skills they may lack and showing them that learning can be enjoyed in a relaxed informal atmo­sphere. This program offers students a nice break from studying and campus life. 
Questions? Please call Tom Pigott ( 283-I656), Martha Massman ( 283­3864 ), Annie Shaughnessy ( 283­40 I 2) or Connie Lee ( 284-5 462)

STEP 
The Student Tutorial Education Program is dedicated to helping the residents of the South Bend Juvenile Facility to develop both socially and educationally. As tutors, our major goal is to motivate the residents to complete and Improve their school­work, and to teach them better study habits; however, the one-on­one structure of the program allows the tutors to develop a special relationship with their assigned resi­dent. The evenings we tutor are Monday and Thursday from 7 to 9. The participants in S.T.E.P. may tutor on either one of these nights ­whichever is more convenient. Transportation to and from the Juvenile Facility is provided for through the Center for Social Con­cerns.

Plunge participants gain insight from experience 
The Urban Plunge program is a 
unique learning experience course 
at the University of Notre Dame 
which enables students to gain a 
glimpse of inner-city life -its 
problems, but also its possibilities. 
It is a 48-hour immersion into the 
kind of life that most Notre Dame 
and Saint Mary's students have never 
seen. For two days during the first 
week ofJanuary, students go to ur­
ban areas across the nation for brief 
encounters with persons and or­
ganizations working for social 
justice in the United States. Caring 
individuals, concerned com­
munities and willing agencies allow 
a new perspective on urban poverty 
to emerge for those who have harl 
little contact with the unemployed, 
the homeless, the hungry. 
The Plunge has three goals: 
I. To enable students to ex­perience and learn for themselves the problems of injustice, poverty and apathy in the urban areas of the United States. 
2. 
To increase awareness of and contact with persons who are working to improve situations, and to evaluate their strategies. 

3. 
To gain fresh insights into issues 


Misa en Espanol 
On the first Sund:~, of ev.ery month, while school -in session, the Center works with a group of hispanic students in presenting a Mass celebrated in Spanish. This is done in order to give the hispanic community a cance to worship in ac­cordance with their own cultural traditions as well as offer an .oppor­tunity to non-hispanics to learn and experience these traditions. Celebrants are Spanish speaking members of the Notre Dame com­munity or an occasional visitors from hispanic countries. A special feature of these masses is a choir with guitar accompament. The Mass is held at II:00 a.m. in Farley Hall Cl:>apel. We invite all Faculty, stalf and students to join us in these monthly celebrations. 

Summer Service 
Summer Serice Projects are available to Notre Dame students who will be returning to campus next fall. The projects are intended to provide Notre Dame students and alumni an opportunity to address the injustice ofpoverty. Project sites are cities where there is a Notre Dame alumni club; the 1985 SSP sites included Puerto Rico and Alaska. Usually, students are placed in or near their home towns. 
The Summeer Serive Projects are underwritten by Notre Dame Alumni Clubs and the James F. Andrews Scholarship fund. Social Concern Scholarships (tuition credit of up to n ,200) are awarded to eligible Notre Dame students who devote 8 weeks in the summer to a project that serves the poor.

VORP 
VORP is a United Religious Com­munity Program headquartered at DuComb Center, 1015 E. Madison St., South Bend. DuComb Center provides alternative sentencing programs and VORP fits into its program. 
VORP is an alternative process available to judges and probation of­ficers for dealing with criminal of­fenders, especially those involved in property offenses. VORP can offer a partial or a total substitute for incar­ceration. 
A trained community volunteer contacts the victim and the offender separately, explains the program, and solicits participation. The volun­teer sets and facilitates a face to face meeting in which facts are reviewed, feelings are aired, and a restitution contract is negotiated. 
For information on volunteering call Daniel Stoltzfus, coordinator, at 232-4817 or 288-8192.

Kerry Gill (Notre Dame '87) 
believe that Kerry speaks· for 
most of us in characterizing her 
recent experiences with the Social 
Concerns Seminar, now in its fifth 
year. This year 24 students traveled 
to Was.hington, D.C. over the fall 
break to explore the relationships 
between social concerns, public 
policy furmation and the Catholic 
traditions concerning peace and 
justice. 
This year the three issues around 
which the seminar was organized 
were South Africa, the nuclear 
dilemma and the environment and 
corporate resj,onsibility. 
Once again, Congressman 
Romano Mazzoli (Notre Dame '54) 
and his aid, jane Kirby (Notre Dame 
'80), provided invaluable assistance 
in helping to put together a program 
which exposed students to elected 
political officials (Rep. Henry Hyde 
and Sen. Lugar), government offi­
cials, private non-profit organiza­
tions (Center fur Defense 
Information, Environmental 
Defense Fund) and faith-based com­
munities (Center of Concern, 
Sojourners, Network). The local 
Notre Dame Club also extended its 
hospitality in the furm of a Sunday 
afternoon barbeque. 
In reflecting upon the week, the

Holy Cross Justice and Peace Center 
The Holy Cross justice and Peace Center is an agency which provides four basic things. The Center dis­tributes, with other private and public agencies, direct aid to the poor of South Bend. This is done primarily through rental and utility bill assistance. The Center coor­dinates a variety of activities to ed­ucate the people of the South Bend area to issues of social justice. The Bail Bond Project, directed by the Center, assists the Incarcerated who are without financial means to post bond. Fir. : ,,,,1 most importantlv Lh\: Justtce and Peace Center provides for its volunteers from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's a com­munity in which social justice issues can be examined, explored, and acted upon. The justice and Peace Center is a community, primarily of volunteers, who seek to learn what it is to profess a faith that does justice. The Center is supported by the three local provinces of Holy Cross religious: the Sisters of the Holy Cross, the Midwest Province ofHoly Cross Brothers, and the Indiana Province of Holy Cross Priests. 

Community for the Lay Apostulate 
CILA, the Community for the In­ternational Lay Apostulate, was es­tablished in 1961 and is one ofNotre Dame's oldest and most prestigious service organizations. Originally formed as a support group for stu­dents doing service projects interna­tionally, CILA has evolved into a diverse organization, complete with three community service projects and an active Education Committee. And CILA still has students doing summer service projects. 
Locally, CILA students volunteer time at El Campito, a day care center fur children here in South Bend. Stu­dents also travel to Corvilla House, a home for the mentally handicapped. Each year CILA volunteers work at the justice and Peace Center. 
death or nuked, and that the blacks tn South Af.--tca are going to dte anyway." 
And also hope: 
"Enthusiasm might best express the personalities of both Peter Henrlot and Sister Pinkerton. They seemed to be livingfor their work and workingfor what they belteved in. It was very en­couraging to see what strides they bad made. They were ex­amples ofCbrlsttan teaching in actton, wbicb I feel is the most important aspect of Chris­tianity. They bad seen a need and attempted to satisfy it by immersing themselves in tssues and activities wbtcb showed Christian concern for the poor and needy." 
I think the root of this frustration came from a sense that man) <>f the men and women that we spoke to 
The Education Committee spon­M>rs lectures and discussion groups on such topics as economic justice and the troubles ofnorthern Ireland. Students currently are working on a project with Potawatomi Indians of 
the area, and are making plans for a winter workshop. 
Other CILA activities include Masses and a spring retreat. This past fall we travelled to Appalachia during Christmas break. Last sum­mer we sponsored students who did projects in Puerto Rico and Mexico. 
Thinking globally and acting lo­cally. This is a kind of theme that CILA uses. CILA holds general meetings approximately every six weeks, and all our a.ctivities are al­ways open to anyone interested. 
Exposure to governmentbrings valuat51e insights 
had lost touch with the human fac­tor within the reality they are facing. Speaking ofone such encounter, Sue Yadion comments: 
"He bad been gtven certain numbers and their interpreta­tions, took them as basic tenets of life, and trted to incorporate those tnto poltcy. Samewhere along tbe line, people became numbers, foretgn poltcy became a game, and world destruction became that much more discus-sable, therefore posstble." 
But as an Important corollary to this feeling was the sense that this human factor has not disappeared from the scene totally, and as a mat­ter of fact. rxio;ts very powertully in 
thetr own Lhristian tradition 
.mough the exl'ucnce of this week I feel the studt.-ms were exposed in a unique and very real manner to some of the very difficult struggles faced by us as we live in this world.

There is a certain room in the west end ofthe ACC in which an aura of tradition exists. On the walls of this room are 56 years ofmemories with names such as Dominic Napolitano, Roland Chamblee, and Many Roddy. 
It was in this room yesterday where a group of over 100 Notre Dame students met to begin the Boxing Club's season. For the next six weeks these students will train for one ofthe top amateur boxing tournaments In the nation · the Bengal Bouts. 
This is not just a boxing tournament. It was set up in 1930 by Dominic "Nappy" Napolitano as a fundraiser for the Holy Cross missions in Bangladesh. And to this day its purpose has remained the same. 
"Everyone recognizes the cause we are here for," noted Club President Ed Kelly. "We are trying to help feed people." 
To prepare for the tournament, the coaches and club officers first teach the fundamentals, then progress into sparring. And as with any sport, safety is an important part ofthis process. 
"All are required to wear headgear, 14-ounce gloves and mouthpieces," said Club Treasurer Kevin O'Shea. "And they are not allowed in the ring until they have demonstrated that they know the fun­damentals." 
The coaches for the club include Sean McCor­mick, faculty supervisor Professor Charles E. Rice, retired boxerJack Mooney, Andy Pernelli and Kelly, who won the 138-pound division National Col­legiate title last year. 
Several boxers to look out for this year are Tom Newell, Ed Garagan, Jeff Anhut, Edgar Riley, Pernell Taylor, Mike Mazza, and all the boxers who par· ticipated in the club's fall novice tournament. 
Club officials were very surprised and enthusias­tic about the turnout for the first meeting. But they stress that there is still room for any other interested students. The more who stay with the program, the better the Bengal Bouts will be.

game for good with four fuuls only minutes into the second half. 
This rest on the bench probably suited Rivers fine after having had to chase around Hofstra's Frank Walker for the entire game. The 5-1 0 fresh­man point guard for the Dutchmen turned in a stellar performance, con­trolling the tempo in the first half and trying desperately to keep his team in the game after Notre Dame began to execute in the second half. On the Hofstra end it was Walker darting inside, dartmj.! dutside, can­ning 15-footers one lime and off· balanced hook shots the next for a grand total of 19 points to lead his team in scoring.

Club. The team is currently the only club in the na­tion competing as a varsity team. This catch does not affect the team unless they make it to the final four tournament at the end of the season. 
The Irish opened their season in the pit Thursday against ninth-ranked Ohio State. After dropping the first two sets by the identical score of 15-5, the Irish ran up a 7-1 lead in the third set, only to let it slide to a 15-13loss. 
Friday the team traveled to Ann Arbor to take on Michigan. A shaky fifth set almost cost Notre Dame the game, but the Irish battled back from 8-1 and 12-4 deficits to take the set, 1 5-13, and the match. 
"We have alot to improve on," said rookie Head 
Coach Bill Anderson. "Just returning from break and 
playing two games did not help us. But we'll im­
prove, and we should do very well." 
The team is off until the 29th, when they hit the 
road to play Western Michigan.

The ski club opened up its season in a 14-team meet at Caberfae Ski Area in Cadillac, Mich. over the weekend. Because of bad weather conditions the team had to leave early without the final results'. But according to men's captainJim Jordan, Notre Dame was battling with Michigan and Michigan State for the top three spots. 
"We did really well this meet," he said. "Our top five men are very strong, and Kathy Skendzal is the best skier we have."

And after Royal slammed home an your-face dunk off a feed from Hicks to make it 81-57 Irish, Phelps once again cleared his bench. "This was an educational game for us," said Berg. "Even at the half I figured it would be a 20-point win for them. They were just too big and too in­timidating underneath." 
And Donald Royal really wanted to do it.

The Notre Dame basketball team fell from 13th to 16th in this week's Associated Press college basketball poll, released yesterday. 
North Carolina, scheduled to face the Irish Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., opened its new arena with a three­point victory over Duke and followed that with a two-point road victory over Marquette last weekend, and was the unamimous choice as the No. 1 team in the poll. 
The Tar Heels, 19-0, have been on top ofthe poll in each ofthe regular­season polls but this was their first week as a unamimous choice. North Carolina received 1,240 points from the nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Last season, Georgetown was a un­amimous No. 1 choice six times and St. John's was unopposed for one week. 
Duke, one ofthree teams to suffer its first loss of the season last week, was second in the voting with 1,089 points, 20 more than Memphis State, 17-0, ofthe Metro Conference. 
Georgia Tech, the third Atlantic Coast Conference team in the top four, was next with 1,058 points. Fifth-ranked Oklahoma, 17-0, had 997 points, just two more than Mic­higan, which suffered its first defeat of the season last week -73-63 to Minnesota -and fell from its No. 2 ranking last week. 
Rounding out the Top Ten were Kansas, 889 points, St. John's, 754, Syracuse, 674, and Nevada-Las Vegas, 669. 
North Carolina opened the 22,000-seat Dean Smith Student Ac­tivities Center Saturday with a 95-92 victory over Duke. The Tar Heels traveled to Milwaukee that night for their nationally televised game at Marquette and overcame a nine­point deficit with four minutes remaining to hold the No. 1 spot. 
Syracuse, fourth last week, dropped to ninth after losing a Big East Conference game to Geor­getown, 73-70, and a nationally televised game at Louisville on Saturday, 83-73. The Orangemen,
