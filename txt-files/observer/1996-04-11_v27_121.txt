Passing the dating test 
Long before the movie,  Jillian Paliocca  
Singles, popularized the  News Copy Editor  
"Bless You Test," women  

had been using it to grade their dates. It was only with the release of this film, however, that men found out about it. 
Some women would argue that men should not be given the advantage of knowing what tests they are expected to pass, but that seems unduly fair. Others are in favor of revealing the secret. And here it is. 
You, the unsuspecting male, have been tak­ing pass/fail exams on every date. There. Now you know. But perhaps you were perceptive enough to realize this on your own. 
On the other hand, maybe you never fath­omed that your every action was being assessed on every date. Perhaps you've been failing consistently for some time in that arena, never realizing all the ramifications that were wrapped up in a sneeze. Instead of pulling your attention from the movie screen to whisper a "bless you" in her ear, you kept right on watching. After that, it was all over. 
The truth of the matter is this. Most women are strict when it comes to this stuff. If you are especially stunning or suave, you may have emerged in good standing despite multiple screw ups. But not all women grade on a curve. It would be advantageous for all of you to know how you are being evaluated. 
And if you can't at least be trained to recog­nize the tests -whether you choose to partici­pate or not -you might as well stay home and hug your filthy couch because its the only soft thing that will consent to get that close to you. 
A+ behavior (what she's looking for): 
• 
Always say "bless you." After every sneeze. Saying it once doesn't count for the whole night. 

• 
Unlock her car door and open it before you go around to your side. Even if its sub-Arctic outside. Especially if its sub-Arctic outside. 

• 
Definitely pick her up. A car would be preferable to a bike or skateboard. 

• 
Ask her questions. It's nice that you like to relive your high school Varsity basketball days, but do it on your own time. 

• 
At one of those nutso off-campus extrava­ganzas, trailblaze a path to the keg and fill her cup for her. 

Point deductions (what can kill your grade): 

• 
Never expect her to walk to D6 from North Quad and wander the rows with you while you swear you knew where your car was. 

• 
Don't wait until you pick her up to say: "So ... What do you wanna do?" Better yet, don't ask her at all. This date was your idea. You figure it out. 

• 
I know you love your filth-mold-beer satu­rated hat. Leave it at home for the night. You look better without it anyway. 

• 
Don't look at your watch. This gesture reeks of boredom. 

• 
For God's sake, don't feed her alcohol. 

• 
Improper placement of hands. Enough said. 

• 
Don't distort your face into a grimace of horror when you get the check. She knows it was expensive. Chances are she feels bad enough already. 

• 
Be consistent. If you are going to hold her hand, don't drop it as soon as your buddies are on the scene. 

• 
Don't be a lingerer. When the date is over, it's OVER. Go home. If you are going to kiss her, then do it. Don't waste her time trying to get courageous.

Shooting parallels Stephen King plot 
SPOKANE 
Police have found disturbing similari­ties between the plot of a Stephen King novel and a real-life classroom shooting that baffled investigators earlier this year. The Spokesman-Review reported Wednesday that a copy of King's novel "Rage" was found on the nightstand of Barry Loukaitis. The 15-year-old is charged with murdering his algebra 

teacher and two classmates Feb. 2 at Frontier Junior High in Moses Lake. The book, which King started writ­ing in high school and later published under the pen name Richard Bachman, is about a teen-ager who holds his algebra class hostage with a .22-caliber revolver. The protagonist, Charlie.Decker, kills his teacher and another instructor and for several hours toys with the idea of shooting the school's most popular boy. Loukaitis carried a .22-caliber revolver and a hunting rifle, which he used to kill algebra teacher Leona Caires and students Manuel Vela, 14, and Arnold Fritz, 15, police said. Loukaitis reportedly asked his classmates, after shooting Caires: "This sure beats algebra, doesn't it?" a quote straight from Decker in the King book. 
Vietnam cops outmatched by bikers 
HANOI 
The prime minister has called for a ban on large motorcycles in an effort to halt daredevil youths from racing through city streets late at night. Thrill-seeking teen-agers in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and other cities began organizing illegal races several years ago. They have defied police efforts to halt them by getting ever big­ger bikes. Racers and bystanders have been injured and killed, but the youths persist. Police have made dozens of arrests over the years, but many of the racers are the children of government and party officials who quickly arrange for their release. The Saigon Newsreader, an English-language newsletter, quoted an unidentified traf­fic policeman Wednesday as saying, "Their vehicles are faster than ours, and they are even more daring than us." Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has ordered authorities to start prosecuting offenders, the newsmagazine Tuoi Tre (Youth) said this week. 

Brain shrinkage may be unique to men 
PHILADELPHIA 

Men lose brain tissue at almost three times the rate of women, curbing their memory, concentration and rea­soning power, a University of Pennsylvania researcher said Wednesday. "Even in the age range of 18 to 45, you can see a steady decline in the ability to perform such (attention-oriented) tasks in men," said Ruben C. Gur, a professor of psychology in psychiatry. Gur said shrinking brains may make men grumpier because some of the tis­sue loss is in the area of the brain that deals with depres­sion. "Grumpy old men may be biological," said Gur, who is continuing to study whether there is a connection. However, one researcher not affiliated with the study said Wednesday that other recent studies contradict Gur's fmdings on shrinkage. Gur found that the most dra­matic loss was in men's frontal lobes, which control attention, abstract reasoning, mental flexibility and inhi­bition of impulses and the temporal lobe governs memo­ry. Gur theorized that men lose more tissue because they have lower blood flow than women, particularly in the frontal lobe region. To compound matters, women's brain metabolism -the rate at which the brain breaks down sugar-slows while they age, while men's brains keep working at a vigorous pace. 
Grain prices continue to skyrocket 
CHICAGO 

Wheat futures rocketed to the daily limit in most con­
tracts Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while 
corn futures set new all-time highs as investors panicked 
about tight supplies. Soybeans futures also rose sharply, 
mostly in sympathy with the grain gains. Wheat futures 
rose the 20 cent trading limit as traders focused on 
reports of extensive frost damage to soft red winter crops 
in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Anecdotal evidence showed 
many farmers were plowing over their fields in favor of 
other crops. "With a demand situation like this and 
short-supply driven market, there's nothing stopping this 
market," said broker Jason Roose. Corn futures soared to 
a sixth consecutive day of all-time highs before falling 
back. Wheat for May delivery rose 20 cents to $5.49 3/4 a 
bushel; May corn rose 9 1/2 cents to $4.44 1/2 a bushel 
after rising as high as $4.46 1/2; May soybeans rose 15 
3/4 cents to $7.94 1/2 a bushel.

Mock Trial claims national ranking 

Observer Staff Report 
After placing first and second in regionals, two Notre Dame Mock Trials teams advanced to the national Gold Flight compe­tition where they placed 11th and seventh respectively. 
From the regional competi­tons, the top five teams advance to the national compe­tition which is composed of 64 teams from 18 regions. Once the teams reach nationals. the names of each team are chosen at random to be placed in one of two brackets known as nights. After that point. the teams only compete against closing statements. The case that the teams dealt with is the same that they have been using throughout the year. It was a murder case which involved a police officer using excessive force on a young Cuban who had been pulled over on a sus­pected DUL While in earlier tri­als the man had not died, for the nationals, the teams had to debate under the condition now that he had died. The first team, led by Captain Mike Edney, fin­ished with a record of 4-4, earn­ing them 11th place in their flight, and the second team, led by Captain Dave Horan, finished with a record of 4-3-1, earning school to compete in the Gold Flight competition. 
Edney also received the All American Attorney Award for earning the second highest point total in the four rounds of competition. In each trial, at­torneys were rated for their ef­forts and given points accord­ingly, with five points being the maximum for each triaL After four trials, Edney received 18 out of 20 possible points.

combination of states," ex­plained Leege. 
Dole's campaign strategy should also focus on electoral dynamics. "The Republicans needs to mobilize all of his fol­lowers," Leege replied. Such strategy should include de­pressing turnout among Democrats and encourage crossover voting. 
Each campaign will, accord­ing to Leege, attempt to bring up pseudo-issues in an effort to affect the other party. "A real issue is the environment. Re­publicans have realized it's not a very good issue to run against," he said. 
Best examined six factors that increase Clinton's chances of winning the presidency. As the sitting president, Clinton holds a huge advantage. "Incumbent presidents who have held office for one term have done tremendously well," Best explained. "Clinton con­trols the agenda and has access to television coverage 24 hours a day." 
Further helping Clinton is the state of the economy. "Most economic indicators are far better now than they were four years ago. This bodes well for Clinton," he continued. 
Clinton's veto power will also be useful in the next few months. "The public thinks that the Republicans have gone too far in health care, medical care, and education," explained Best. The election gives Clinton a chance to reflect this. 
Most importantly, Clinton is an effective campaigner, ac­cording to Best. He described Clinton as "more youthful, en­ergetic, and charismatic," which is especially damaging to someone like Dole. 
Again the issue becomes how the candidates define and pre­sent themselves to the Ameri­can public. "We [the voters] must be sensitive enough to ask to what degree are they [the candidates] touching on the problems pertinent in society," Arnold stressed. 
While the 1996 presidential election will hinge upon the in­dividual images each candidate sends to the voting public, the panel agreed that November is still a long way off, and a defi­nite favorite is difficult to pick. Likely, the eventual winner will have answered the question that Arnold closed with: · 
"Which candidate seems to 
be looking far enough, accu­
rately enough, and truthfully 
enough ahead?"

an authority on matters of homosexuality. 
Silva said his presence on the committee is important because in his presentation before the Board of Trustees, he will be "putting a face to a .gay person," just as Haley will be "putting a face to an African American woman." 
"We are the people who are strongly influenced by the policies," Silva said. 
"It will be real people talk­ing to people," he added. "And that's what gets things done." 
Likely, co-president of the African-American Student Al­liance and a chairperson for the Black Student Union, said she will focus on what stu­dents can do to improve the state of multiculturalism at Notre Dame. 
She will draw from her 
experiences of having 
worked with an organization

"We're not just handing over the problems to the Board," Likely noted. 
In addition to making rec­ommendations to the Board of Trustees, Likely said she will not just point to areas needing improvement in the administration, faculty and curriculum. "We also want to let them know what stu­dents can do," she said.

are to be stopped from becoming dealers. 
In essence, Phelps said the sense of hope which was lost in the mid­dle of this century must be brought back to the inner cities if they are to be saved from despair. 
By taking the time to participate in ordinary community service pro­grams, and particularly by dealing with young inner-city children, Phelps said, students can help to fight the drug problem in America's cities and towns. 

CAMPUS MINISTRY... ...CONSIDERATIONS 
ORDINATION THIS SUNDAY 
My friend, Ed Obermiller, C.S.C., will be ordained a Holy Cross priest this Saturday, April13, at 1:30 p.m. in the Basilica. 
It will be a great event, ordaining Ed to serve others and remind­ing us that we are all called to serve others in one way or another. If you have never been to an ordination, this might be a good chance to go. Even ifyou have been to an ordination, it is anoth­er great chance to celebrate God's love and to be attentive to the way that God may be calling you to live your life. 
No doubt, the ordination will remind me ofmy ordination as a Holy Cross priest, a little over two years ago. 
Although there have been some tough times, the past two years have been two of the happiest years of my life, filled with chal­lenges and meaning. 
I have been blessed to live and work with Holy Cross priests, brothers, and sisters who try to be servants of others. Mostly by their example, they teach me to let go ofmy life more and more. 
At Notre Dame, I am blessed to work with men and women, married and single, who teach me about what it is to be a·servant. 
I am blessed to work with and live among students who try to listen to God's call. By celebrating the Eucharist with them, I have been called to recognize Christ's presence. By hearing their confessions, I have been called to grow in honesty with God, myself, and others. By baptizing them or receiving them into the Church, I been called to grow in appreciation of the Church and challenged to make it more welcoming. The students and gradu­ates I have helped to prepare for marriage are signs of God's love to me, and inspired me to try to be a better sign of God's love myself 
Through being a Holy Cross priest, I feel like my life has mean­ing. Through being a Holy Cross priest, I am recognizing the meaningfulness of the lives of people who answer God's call in other ways. 
With great appreciation for the many other ways to answer God's call, I ask you to ask yourself ifyou feel that God may be calling you to be a priest, brother, or sister. Never be afraid to explore this possibility. 
-Fr. Bob Dowd, C.S.C.

In addition to teaching with­out pay, Fanning made a num­ber of gifts to the University,

Hale testifies on loans, Whitewater

Whitewater witness David 
Hale testified for the first 
time Wednesday that he was 
informed of a planned meet· 
ing at the governor's mansion in which Bill Clinton and James McDougal were sup­posed to discuss a 

loan. 
Under renewed question­ing by prosecutors during his eighth day on the witness stand, Hale said he was told by McDougal -Clinton's Whitewater business partner -around Jan. 10, 1986, that the meeting was io occur on a Saturday at the governor's mansion. Clinton was governor at the time. 
Records from the gover· nor's office show that a meeting was on Clinton's schedule so that he (~ould · sign unspecified personal business papers. 
The White House had no immediate comment on whether the meeting took place. Whitewater prosecu· tor Hickman Ewing dt}Clhu}d to comment on the question. 
McDougal "said he was going by the governor's man­sion to discuss our loan," Hale testified. 
"He said, '1 am going by to talk about it with Clinton on Saturday."' 
Hale didn't spedfy what "our loan" was. Whitewater prosecutor Hay Juhn was not permittfld by the judge in the case to go into any more detail.

I have a confession to make. I'm twenty-two years old, and I've never been inside a Black person's home. I should also probably mention that of the hundreds of friends I've cultivated over a lifteime, only one, Emily, is African­American and one, Vickie, is Korean. The three of us were on the cross-coun­try team together in high school. I've long since lost touch with both of them. As it turned out, these friendships didn't do much to dispel whatever ethnic or racial stereotypes I might have uncon­sciously embraced as a kid; Emily hap­pens to come from a single-parent home and is a superb athlete, while Vickie's family runs a convenience store in Toronto's west end. 
Living in Toronto, one of the world's truly cosmopolitan cities, I attended schools so racially segregated that Notre Dame seems a paragon of cultural diver­sity by comparison. Surrounded pri­marily by white friends and classmates, and living in primarily white neighbor­hoods, I never gave much thought to race. I didn't have to. 
I first became race conscious the sum­mer of my senior year here at Notre Dame, a fact some find amusing given the poor state of race relations on cam­pus and the school's lack of committ­ment to attracting and maintating a het­erogfmeous student body. I was one of maybe thirty students enrolled in a six week course on American Slavery. Feeling no personal sense of guilt over the issue of slavery (Canada never adopted slavery as an institution). it never occurred to me that the interplay of class dynamics and subject matter would create an emotionally charged atmosphere, forcing the issue of race to a head. 
For the first time in my life I became conscious of how it feels to sit in a room and feel dill'erent, set apart from most of the students in the class by virtue of my skin color. I rarely participated in class discussions, afraid of saying the wrong thing and exposing myself as insensitive, ignorant, or even worse -racist. My silence, entirely self-imposed, had its roots in a profound discomfort and sense of shame. No student of color ever discounted a white student's contribu­tion on the grounds of his or her race, but it was hard for me to speak all the same. 

Exploring the roots of my discomfort, I found myself wrestling with difficult questions. Before immigrating to the United States, my grandparents lived on a large sugar mill in Havana, Cuba. If they had been born a few years ealier, would they have been slave-holders? I'm not sure I want to know the answer to that question. My grandparents are Catholic, God-fearing, people who go to Church each Sunday and still volunteer in their community though they are both in their seventies. Yet my grandmother, who holds an advanced degree in math­ematics, still insists African-Americans have inferior brains because they are denied sufficient meat and protein as children, while my grandfather remem­bers to lock his car door only when he sees a Black man walking down the street. Three years ago my grandmoth­er was exempted from jury duty when she agreed with the statement "A black man running down the street has proba­bly just committed a felony." When I think about history, circumstances, and slavery, I cannot say with certainty they would not have been slave-owners. Kind, paternalistic slave h.olders to be sure, but slave holders all the same. The same is true of my parents, and even myself. I cannot say with absolute conviction that had I grown up in the south in the nineteenth century or lived in Germany during the Second World War, I would not have succumbed to the dominant racial ideologies of those times or places. To believe otherwise is to deny the historical and social contexts which made slavery and genocide seem rational to millions of average people. 
This realization fills me with shame. Long ago I gave up trying to change my grandparents' beliefs, accepting them as the remnants of a different time and way of life. But, sitting silently in History class day after day, I realized that for me race holds more meaning than I had previously dared acknowl­edge, even to myself. It is something each of us must confront when we walk through the dining halls and see the rows of tables, segregated by skin color, or see the racial epithats carved into the desks of the Hesburgh library. It is painfully obvious in letters to the editor and student protests over the artwork in the main building. It becomes impossi­ble to ignore when thirty-five students take a class on American Slavery taught by a white, male graduate student. 
Luckily we didn't ignore it, addressing the issue of race directly during a heat­ed classroom confrontation. I was relieved to learn others wrestled with the same difficulties, and even the pro­fessor admitted his own discomfort at describing the horrors his ancestors inflicted on the great-grandparents, great-aunts, and uncles of most of the students in our class. The discussion both validated our feelings and allowed us to acknowledge how systemic racism and discrimination, the enduring lega­cies of slavery, are still operant within universities and other institutions, dic­tating who holds power in academia and even which courses are taught and from whose vantage point. 
I have forgotten most of the names, dates, and historical events we studied in class, but I have not forgotten my own discomfort surrounding the issue of race, nor what it felt like to be one of a handful of people in the class who were visibly different from the others. 
I cannot change the fact that I am privileged, nor do I wish to. While my racial identity and class membership have protected me from the institutional and personal prejudice and discrimina­tion confronted by many marginalized groups in our society, my parents have also worked hard to provide my sister and I the tools and resources we enjoy. Very few of us have been given the world on a silver platter. 
But while I will not apologize for my opportunities, nor will I neglect the responsibilities they confer upon me. At

• LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Student shamed by racist past, accepts modern responsibilities 
Parkview Juvenile Center, where I work as an intake-probation officer two days a week, race is a volatile issue. Many of the workers, who are white, use their power and authority to intimidate clients, who are often black. Differences must constantly be confronted at Parkview, where, all too often, staff dis­plays a lack of sensitivity to the issues that first bring families into contact with the agency, including the effects of drug and alcohol addiction, family violence, child abuse, poverty, and racism. In this context it becomes impossible for juve­niles and their parents to ask for assis­tance in understanding and demanding their rights and in taking advantage of the full range of services to which the law entitles them. Many of the juveniles who would most benefit from these resources fail to take advantage of them because they must be accepted along with racism and biased judgments levied against the young person and his or her family. 
Is it fair that I have the power to make decisions that will affect people's lives, even though I often cannot understand the personal and social forces that con­strain them? I don't know. But I can choose to use that power as responsibly as I can, continually reminding myself of the differences that separate us. These differences, which often include race, also encompass social class and level of education, themselves related to race in complicated ways due to institutional racism. 
Directly acknowledging the different elements of our identities and how these intersect to shape the way we experi­ence the world prevents us from denying the existence of racism in our society. Rather, it allows us to begin to see each other as unique human beings, whose ethnic, cultural, economic, and sexual identities offer to enrich our own experi­ence of the world by learning to see it from different vantage points.

Students gather in aThursday Night TV tradition 
By SARAH DYIAG Accent Copy Editor 

icture this: you're sit­
ing in your neigh­
or's dorm room 
munching on popcorn 
and chatting with 
your friends about all 

the work you should be doing. Suddenly, everyone gets quiet and turns to stare at the TV as that somewhat annoying TV theme song ­turned top ten hit comes on. Thursday night TV has begun and the truth is, if you're not plopped in front of the TV catching the latest "Friends" episode, you're going to be left out of the "Smelly Cat" jokes all week long. (Not to mention what you'll miss out on if you don't catch "Seinfeld" and "ER.") 
This Thursday Night addiction is, of course, not a new phenomenon. Those of you experienced Thursday TV watch­ers will recall that, for years, Thursday has been THE night to forget all of your work and veg out in front of the tube. Think about it-years ago (we're talking when your parents actually watched the Thursday Night T.V.) we had "Taxi," "Cheers," and "Hill Street Blues." And of course, we all remember the days of "The Cosby Show," "A Different World," and "Cheers." The fact is, Thursday nights have always been good and many of us have always watched them. Some even contend that Thursday nights are the only nights with any good TV at all. 
The big question is, why? What makes Thursday Night so different from all the others? In general, it seems that Thursday nights are the easiest nights to blow off work and accomplish nothing. Freshman Kelly Beisenstein says, "Thursday night is kind of the beginning of the weekend and it is a nice way to relax after a long week." Her roommate, Laura Reding agrees and further explains that "On Thursday nights most of the freshmen in my section come to my room and we all watch "Friends" and "ER" together. It is a good release at the end of the week when you are sick of studying." 
Perhaps it is the anticipation of the weekend that gives Thursday its wide­spread popularity, and maybe it's the general end-of-the-week exhaustion that allows us to give in to the indulgence of a night of sheer procrastination. Then again, it could be that the shows are just good. Whatever the reason, when eight o'clock rolls around, books close with a resounding bang and groups of friends across campus settle in to escape to a reality where people in general have lives that are, as Beisenstein relates, "so simple and fun. They don't have any responsibilities." 
For proof of the wide-spread populari­ty of these shows, one needs only to ven­ture into the T.V. room of LaFortune as the Thursday Night line-up begins. There's not an empty seat in the room. Though most people do not stay for their full three hour fill, there is a constant crowd of people watching at various times throughout the night with the more popular shows being "Friends" and "ER." 
For some, Thursday night T.V. has become a kind of ritual gathering. Take, for instance, those who choose to get their dose of Thursday night T.V. in Room 1 of Sorin Hall. Here, Aran, Mark, Michael and their pals leave the T.V. on for the full three hours as their friends sporadically join them for favorite

shows. Packed tightly into the small room, the crowd can get a bit noisy dur­ing commercial breaks,-twelve conver­sations at once causes quite a commo­tion-but all eyes turn attentively to the 
T.V. while the shows are on. Though the group does not admit to being complete­ly addicted, they gather every week to catch their favorites. 
Currently, these Thursday night favorites begin with "Friends," which, as Megan McNally observes, is popular 


The Observer/Michelle Sweet 

because it's "funny and only a half-hour and it relates to people our age." Following "Friends" usually comes the not-so-popular "The Single Guy." While many students agree this is a lame attempt at comedy, many people leave it on anyway. After all, how much work can you actually get done in a half­hour? However, the recent premier of "Boston Common" may finally make this half-hour worth watching (though as of now, it seems doubtful.) 
Following this half-hour of pretending to watch or do work while actually rehashing Ross and Rachel's latest cri­sis/kiss-and-make-up, all attention returns to the tube as "Seinfeld" begins. After a half-hour of the comedic antics of Jerry, George, and Cosmo Kramer, the 9:30 "Caroline in the City" can some­times be a let down, but once again the philosophy that "It's just a half-hour" seems to reign. 
After enjoying two hours of these sometimes hilarious sitcoms, most stu­dents stick around (and those who actu­ally went and did work during those two hours return) for "ER." According to Reding, "TV is so addicting that once they hook you with "Friends" it's easy to watch straight through to "ER." For many, this exciting hospital drama is even better than the ever popular "Friends." While "ER" lacks the cute, humorous, and somewhat frivolous sto­rylines of "Friends," most find its semi­realistic, ever exciting drama quite entertaining. 
Of course, the Thursday night TV ritu­al does not end with the closing credits of "ER." Most Thursday addicts also find it necessary to choose a favorite charac­ter, most of which come from the "Friends" cast. For girls, the winner is Chandler. Most agree that he is the "cutest and funniest" member of the cast although Ross's recent romantic involvement with Rachel has moved him into a close second. As for guys' favorites, Rachel wins out (and not for her attempts at humor) though Monica and Phoebe also get many votes. 
In addition, most Thursday addicts find it necessary to discuss, rehash, crit­icize and comment on the shows for with your friends the next day ... sighing over Ross and Rachel's first kiss or laughing at Seinfeld's 'soup Nazi.' You talk about those things for weeks because they're more exciting than real life." 
Being more exciting than real life is something all these Thursday night shows certainly have in common. Although the ever-hip cast of "Friends" sometimes encounters the daily prob­lems and annoyances of real life, the key to the show's popularity lies in the impression that life is almost always fun and everything always works out. (Not to mention the fact that three of the main characters are a masseuse, a cof­fee shop waitress and a chef who each have wardrobes three times the size of the average person. Apparently, the responsibilities of life have not yet set in for this twenty-something crowd). 
As Thursday Night rolls on, the shows get closer to reality, but never too close. "Seinfeld," while touching more upon the realities of life, has the same easygo­ing, fun outlook of "Friends" with Cosmo and George keeping things from getting too serious. The most realistic of all the shows is obviously "ER," but even this show escapes some of the realities of life-emergency rooms are hardly ever that busy, probably never that fun, and certainly not that conducive to intimate relationships. But who's really com­plaining? The truth is, people live real life every day and know that it's not always that exciting. These Thursday Night shows give us a chance to escape the boredom of our own lives and dwell on other people's problems regardless of how unrealistic of overdramatized they maybe. 
So when that annoying theme song comes on this week, join the ranks of the dedicated Thursday addicts and find out for yourself. But watch out-it will suck you in. Before you know it, you'll be the one singing ''I'll be there for you...'' and talking about TV characters as if they were people you know. Don't worry about getting too attached-when you can't catch the latest show, there's always the VCR. And with a line-up this good, it looks like the Thursday night shows are definitely going to be around 
LaFortune is a favorite meeting place for Thursday night TV watchers, who come for vari­days. As one Thursday Night addict puts for a while. ous segments of the three hour line up.

A 
hoy! There is, quite simply, no band out there like the Barenaked Ladies. For eight years now, they've been bucking trends and genres with their mix of pop, jazz, country, uh, some folk, and ... just about everything else. On their new album, Born On A Pirate Ship, Canada's finest exports have pigeonholed themselves just a little bit with four­teen songs that establish a more cohesive sound than they've had to this point in their career. 
Not to imply, of course, that they sound like any other band. Even when they play straight-up four beat rock, there's no sound like it. Take a normal rock riff, such as the one that carries "The Old Apartment," and throw in the lyrics "Why did you paint the walls?/ Why did you clean the floor?/ Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?" You have to wonder if they could play a formula song if they tried. 
There are many things that set the Barenaked Ladies apart from the buzz-bin singles circuit. Chief among them is their cleverness. Song structures that are just a little bit left of cen­ter with a mix of mordant and childlike wit will make any lis­
feeling Taj Mahal I 
the Phantom Blues 
e man with the 
coolest name in the 
game is also one of 
roots music's biggest trea­sures. Phantom Blues, Taj Mahal's 31st release, is jam packed with heavyweight names and heavyweight vibe. Taj has been hanging with all the right people and it shows. The man who brought you "Big Legged Mommas are Back in Style" and, with Danny Glover, narrated the story of "Brer Rabbit and the Wonderful Tar Baby" continues to reinterpret roots classics in his own inimitable manner. 
Taj has never been a hard-core blues artist, and Phantom Blues is as much phantom folk, R & B and funk as it is phantom blues. With one of the tightest bands in the business, Taj pays his dues to some of his musical ancestors. (In fact, there is only one original on the album, the delightfully folksy "Lovin' in My Baby's Eyes" in which Taj's voice, deep and rasping, is captivating while Heartbreaker Mike Campbell con­tributes on guitar.) Fats Domino's "Let the Four Winds Blow" gets the Taj treatment-a few parts shufne, a few parts zydeco-with a little help from David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) on accordion. Sonny Thompson and Freddie King's "(You've Got To) Love Her with a Feeling" is covered with true Delta sincerity. Even if Taj was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and lives in Hawaii he still knows the blues. A very plugged Mr. Clapton keeps the sound dirty and raw. Bonnie Raitt gets into the act with the riotous "I Need Your Loving Every Day." There ain't much to the song besides the title and a whole lot of fun. Pretty much the same can 

blues 
(out of five) 

tener sit up. They are at the peak of their creative powers here, a feat considering that they've been more cleverly fun than any other band out there for a while. 
The sound is unified, but even so, the mix is evident. "I Know" is a basic rock tune until the bridge, when a mix of grunge and Latin flavor backs up the unusually intense vocal work of Robertson and Page. ]here's even a power ballad here, "Break Your Heart." This may be as close to formula as the Barenaked Ladies get: Page, for once, is completely straightforward about his message and, aside from a horn section, nothing really makes the song stick out to the casual observer. The question is, is it a parody, or is Steven Page serious about his attempted Steven Tyler-esque vocal histrion­ics? 
No matter. Even if they aren't kidding, it works. Barenaked Ladies will be in Stepan Center tonight and it may be your last chance to see them before everybody else is let in on the secret. Check them out. You're gonna thank us for it.

be said for Jesse Hill's "Ooh Poo Pah Doo"-it may be goofy but it sure does swing. Perhaps the high­light of the album is a fine take of Doc Pomus's classic "Lonely Avenue." 
Taj can also get a little funked up when he wants to-he finds the perfect grove in the Jon Cleary penned "Cheatin' on You" as he tells his tale of love betrayed over the stabs of the Texacali horns and the sweet harmonies of the ubiquitous "Sir" I larry Bowens and "Sweet Pea" Atkinson (Was Not Was). Although Taj covers funk and the blues with aplomb his voice is best suited for soul. His rendition of "Fanning the Flames" and "Don't Tell Me" would even stack up against such operators as AI Green. Phantom Blues ends with the very dispensable "Car of your Dreams," a song Taj describes as humorous and frothy. Having said that, it must also be admitted that it does have a killer brass riff. 
While not a classic album by any stretch of the imag­ination, Phantom Blues is another welcome release from someone who could teach Bootie a thing or two about music and the cool.

Radiohead The Metro, Chicago April 4, 1996 
''WHttever makes you happy, whatever you 
want. ..." Life's simple pleasures are the 
source of true happiness. Hot-dogs at the ballpark, lemonade on a sultry August day, warm apple pie at Thanksgiving dinner, and Radiohead in concert, to name a few. 
During the twilight hours of Holy Thursday, amidst the eigarette smoke looming eerily around the rafters and the stench of old beer at the Metro in Chicago, Hadiohead and opening band David Gray put on a show that woke up the heavens. They played in front of a sold out crowd, as the Metro fit every possible body into the club. The Metro marked a strong change for Hadiohead who, less than a year ago, was touring sta­diums and arenas as the opening act for R.E.M. In con­trast to the summer tour, everyone at the show knew Hadiohead. There were no remarks like, "I heard that on MTV a while a go," or "Didn't I hear that on the Clueless soundtrack?" The capacity crowd of 1,100 was eomprised of the diehards, the ones who have bnen with Hadiohead since the beginning. 
Very rarely are bands able to play in an environment suited properly to their style, but the small club in Chieago utTered a strong compliment to the personal nature of both David Gray's and Radiohead's music. They were able to work the crowd, speak to the crowd and almost relate to the crowd. They did not feel obli­gated to have hours of music stripped from them. In­stead, they poured their music from the depths of their !warts and souls. 
David Gray put on an excellent performance to warm up the crowd for Hadiohead. His style of music is a very similar to Hadiohead's-whining guitar, wailing

synthesizer and powerful lyrics. Gray is a true talent; he worked the crowd without overstaying his welcome because he realized who everyone was really there to see. He played an hour of solid music, teasing the au­dience's appetite. 
The hunger was appeased when Thorn Yorke (hair and all) took the stage with a brilliant two and a half hour set. They successfully found the formula for mix­ing new songs with old songs. They played a few famil­iar songs from either Pablo Honey or The Bends, then mixed in a new song potentially from their next album (which, rumor has it, is due to hit stores within the next year). Following that relatively obscure song, they plunged back into their old music for fear of los­ing the crowd. They had nothing to worry about because their new stuff is good ... really good. 
They played favorites such as "Planet Telex," "Bones," with such unbridled passion that it was electrifying. Their stage presence during these songs, as well as every song throughout the entire set, was remarkable. They truly appeared to be enjoying what they were doing. The enthusiasm of lead singer, Thorn Yorke, was quite contagious with his witty English voice and unyielding honesty and passion for his work. The rest of the band showed that Radiohead was not a one man band by putting in brilliant performances of their own. Blaring guitars, electronically synthesized sounds, pounding drums, a deep bass and even some string instruments, the band offered a collage of sounds. 
Radiohead also played the more well known songs, such as "High and Dry," "Fake Plastic Trees" and "Creep." Yorke's more memorable lines came when he

exclaimed with a hint of sarcasm, just prior to playing "Creep," "You may have heard of this song ... NO! S-t. you guys don't watch enough TV. This song's called Creep." The band was then barraged by screams and the cheers of the 1,100 fans. The songs captured an honesty that is often not found in music today. 
The show ended with a three song encore, which concluded with a memorable performance of the haunting "Street Spirit (fade out)." The eeriness and passion of the song successfully summarized the aura of the show as well as the pain that seems to underlie much of Radiohead's music. 
Radiohead puts on an incredible show that leaves the audience longing for more. Every so often a really good live band comes along. Well, it's about that time and Radiohead is certainly that band.

Pitching woes continue for Cubs as Rockies rally 
Associated Press 

DENVER 
Larry Walker and Andres Galaragga hit back-to-hack RBI doubles with two outs in the eighth inning Wednesday as the Colorado Rockies rallied for a 10-9 win over the Chicago Cubs. 
Mike Perez, the fifth of Chicago pitch­er, entered the game to protect the Cubs' 9-8 lead and promptly hit Walt Weiss and Ellis Burks. Doug Jones (1-1) came on and got Dante Bichette to ground into a double play. But Walker and Bichette followed with doubles to send Colorado to its 200th franchise vic­tory. 
Curtis Leskanic (1-0) pitched the final two innings for the win. 
Bichette went 3-for-5 with three RBis, and Ellis Burks and Andres Galarrage homered for the Rockies. 
Luis Gonzalez and Scott Servais hit back-to-hack home runs in the third inning for the Cubs, and starter Jim Bullinger hit a two-run homer. 
Gonzalez hit a three-run homer to right-center off Colorado starter Bryan Rekar, who then gave up a solo shot to Servais, his fourth and second in two games as the Cubs took a 6-1 lead. 
The Rockies came right back by scor­ing four runs in the bottom of the inning on two-run homers by Burks and Galarraga. 
In the fourth, Bullinger hit his second career homer to give the Cubs an 8-5 lead, but Coloraro got two runs back in the fifth on RBI singles by Bichette and Vinny Castilla. 
The Cubs tied it with an unearned run in the sixth inning on pitcher Lance Painter's three-base throwing error on Wendell's sacrifice bunt. 
Phillies 7, Pirates 6 
PITTSBURGH 
Benito Santiago hit a three-run homer off rookie reliever Francisco Cordova and the Philadelphia Phillies overcame Jeff King's two homers and five RBis to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-6 Wednesday. 
Reliever Russ Springer struck out the side in the Pirates' eighth with the potential go-ahead run on base before Ricky Bottalico fmished off the Phillies' two-game sweep by getting his third save. 
Phillies starter Mike Grace (2-0) wasn't as effective as he was in limiting the Rockies to a run in eight innings on April 3, but won his second consecutive start despite allowing five runs and eight hits in six innings. 
Lenny Dykstra doubled and scored a run to finish 4-for-8 in the series with a homer, two walks and three runs scored. The Pirates fell to 0-2 at home after starting the season by winning four of five. 
The Phillies took advantage of John Ericks' shaky pitching and two Pittsburgh errors to score three runs in the first, but trailed 5-4 following pair of two-run homers by King and Jay Bell's RBI single in the fifth. 

Orlando Merced, 0-for-18 in the Pirates' first six games, went 4-for-4 with singles ahead of both King homers and a double before Bell's RBI single. 
King, who went 3-for-4, also had a run-scoring double in the eighth before Springer struck out Charlie Hayes, Carlos Garcia and Dave Clark with run­ners on second and third. 
With the Pirates leading 5-4, Todd Zeile and Mark Whiten chased reliever Jason Christiansen (1-1) with con­secutive one-out singles in the seventh. Santiago followed with a three-run shot, his second, off Cordova, who unexpect­edly made the Pirates' roster after going 40-6 in the Mexican League the last four seasons. 
Dykstra, off to his best start since 1990, again was the catalyst as the Phillies, who used a two-run first inning as the springboard to Monday's victory, took a 3-0 lead in the first. 
Dykstra walked and stole second, and a rattled Ericks promptly allowed Mickey Morandini's single. Rookie catcher Jason Kendall threw wildly as Morandini stole second -the Phillies' 12th steal in seven games-and Gene Schall followed with a two-out, two-run double. 
Cardinals 4, Expos 1 
ST. LOUIS 
Rookie Alan Benes, making his fifth career start, pitched a four-hitter Wednesday to lead the St. Louis Cardinals to a 4-1 win over the Montreal Expos. 
Benes (1-0), the younger brother and teammate of Andy Benes, took a shutout into the ninth before Rondell White led off with a homer. Benes, 24, struck out a career-high 11 -six looking -and walked two in his first complete game. 
In his first start on opening day, Benes was roughed by the New York Mets for seven runs in 3 1-3 innings. He limited the Expos to three singles, including two infield hits by Mark Grudzielanek, before White's homer. 
Ray Lankford homered for the Cardinals, who won despite going 0-for­8 with runners in scoring position. St. Louis is batting just .183 this season with runners at second or third. 
Lankford, who led the Cardinals with 25 home runs last year, hit his first off rookie Jose Panigua (1-1) to open the third. 
St. Louis added three runs in the eighth, with two coming in on a throw­ing error by Expos reliever Dave Veres. 
Ron Gant walked and Willie McGee bunted on to open the eighth. After fielding Gary Gaetti's bunt, Veres thought about throwing to third before throwing the ball away trying to get Gaetti at first. Both Gant and McGee scored on the play, and the Cardinals added a third run on a double by Pat Borders. 
The Cardinals missed an opportunity to blow the game open early, leaving the bases loaded in the first and stranding two more in the second. St. Louis stranded 14 runners in its home opener.

There are other, independent reasons for the establishment of such a program. Ireland has an extra­ordinary tradition in literature (in both .English and Irish), a unique historical position in relation to British and European historical development and an influence, disproportionate to its size, on the history of the United States. It is rhe only West European nation that has also been a colony; a knowledge of its history is

necessary for understanding of British history since the seventeenth century; its medieval culture is integral to an understanding of medieval and pre-medieval Europe. Thus, such a program would enrich a student's knowledge in a variety of directions. 
For the concentration in Irish Studies, the student will take (a) four area studies courses spread across 
Ireland
English, History, Government, and other departments, and (b) three courses in rhe Irish language. These would meet the college's foreign language requirement. In the senior year, the student would submit a cap­

ning five batters. When all was· said and done, both Davis and Lidge had combined for eight and two-thirds innings of two­hit relief with nine strikeouts. 
Down 6-0 in the first, Notre Dame didn't get back into this with hitting. Instead, perhaps intimidated by the much bigger Irish, Cougar pitcher Matt McDonald walked six batters in one and two-thirds innings. The key moment came with two outs in the first. 
The Irish had the bases jammed when Wagner stalked to the plate. McDonald threw four straight balls to Wagner, forcing in the first run, then walked Restovich next for another run. 
But Wagner and Restovich weren't doing their damage by bases on balls. In fact, their

Lately, signs of spring have been all around. 
Flowers are beginning to bloom, the major league base­ball season is in full swing, and the sun has even made a few cameos in the South Bend area. 
That list can now be extended to include Bookstore Basketball. 
The annual rite of spring on the Notre Dame campus began yesterday with 40 scheduled preliminary games. While no seeded teams saw action, the day did see its usual share of the types of things that charac­terize the early rounds of Bookstore. 
For example, the traditionally under-dressed squad known as Tighty Whities V: Frightening at Best made their first ap­pearance of the tournament. Theirs was a brief run, as the squad fell to Don't Tell Us Our Business Devil Women 21-9. 
"One day, we decided to wear underwear and play basket­ball," said Tighty Whity Jamie Waters. "We wanted to win. We are crushed and absolutely devastated but we're the epit­ome of Bookstore Basketball." 
Some may dispute that claim but the team definitely put on a show. The same can be said for the participants in the 5:30 game game that was played on Stepan 2. In fact, their showed lasted until 6:45. 
The squad known as B.T.P. which consisted of former Walsh residents defeated Hot Wax, a team of ex-Lyons girls by a count of 21-12. 
As always, the final count 
was important but fact that the game featured two calls to N.D. Security for injuries is what will most be remembered. 
"It was a lot of fun and no one was seriously hurt," said B.T.P's Becky Cantwell. "The game lasted awhile but we expected it to take close to three hours so we're happy." 
Even many of the squads who didn't advance to the offi­cial first round were happy with their effort. For a few fans and spectators, there were plenty of shots being taken, not all of them jumpers. In a day where many of the match-ups were pre-arranged so friends could slug it out with other friends who are on an equal skill level, nothing less was really to be expected. 
The prelimanary rounds con­tinue today starting at 4 pm.

The Class of '96 Presents 
By STEPHANIE BUEK Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Combining novice and know­how, the Saint Mary's College tennis team has found that ver· satility plus experience adds up to a successful season. 
In their third home match of the season, the Belles blanked the University of Chicago 9-0 last Wednesday before heading into Easter vacation. 
Freshman Caroline Graham, #3 doubles, said that SMC had an edge over the competition in the form of mental consistency. 
"It just wasn't (the University of Chicago's) day," Graham said. "They were yelling at themselves. We were a little more focused. We were a little more intense." 
For the past three matches, the Belles have had to adjust to changes in their line-up to ac­commodate various illnesses and injuries to team members. Last week's match proved no different, as the team again called upon freshmen Betsy Gemmer and the team of Caroline and Morey Graham to move into the #5 singles and #3 doubles spots, respectively. 
According to junior Ashley McArdle, #4 singles, while an ever-changing line-up can be frustrating, Saint Mary's has the personnel to create a solid roster with many different combinations of players. She specifically cited the fresh­men's outstanding versatility. 
"I think we're pretty sound

through the whole line-up," McArdle said. "We knew (the freshmen) had the ability, and in the last three matches they've had a lot more confi· dence; they know they can play at that level. The freshmen have done a great job stepping up." 
Morey Graham agreed. 

"I think (the changes in the line-up} have influenced us for the better," Graham said. "We have all been put into situa· tions and dealt with different positions. We've dealt with it and we've produced." 
Producing has meant supporting each other as a team. Junior Kate Kozacik, #l singles, credits a substantial part of the Belles' success to team unity. 
"We are all genuinely proud to see everyone move up in the line-up," Kozacik said. "There's no team conflict, there's no pettiness, no bicker· ing. People get along well, and that makes it easier to step into doubles with someone who maybe you haven't played with before. It allows us to just play the game." 
According to Belles Head Coach Katie Cromer, Kozacik, a team co-captain with Anne Underwood, reflected the team's versatility in her play at the #1 singles spot. 
"Kate's biggest asset, her main strength, is her ability to adapt her game," Cromer said. "She has enough repertoire in her game that if one thing isn't working, she can change it. If her forehand is going out, she can underspin the ball to cor­rect. When Kate steps on the court, she has a game plan." 
Now 13-5 in match play and awaiting an updated ranking in April, SMC's game plan is to win in the next two weeks. Well past the midpoint in their season, the Belles head into the toughest part of their schedule. This afternoon, the team trav· els to Michigan to play Division II Hillsdale, and Saturday they face Wheaton College on the road. According to McArdle, wins at these matches will give SMC at good look at the Midwest Invitational Tournament in Madison, Wise.

At the No. 6 singles spot, sophomore Molly Gavin squeaked out a victory over the Longhorns' Anne Pastor, 7-5, 7-6. 
In the doubles competition, the Irish dropped their first match, but claimed wins at the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles spots. Seniors Wendy Crabtree and Holyn Lord, ranked nineteenth nationally, lost out to the eleventh-ranked pair of Cristina Moros and Farley Taylor, 4-6, 5-7. The pair con­sisting of junior Erin Gowen and Hall won 6-4, 7-5. Sophomore Kelley Olson and Velasco claimed the win for the

tough sets, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. "Basically, we were excited that we won," stated Velasco, "Everyone just played really well." The team then headed to North Carolina to take on the Blue Devils. The match was much tighter than the score showed, according to Louderback. Duke claimed a quick 4-2 lead against the Irish in singles competition. The only Irish players to win their singles matches were the freshmen. Hall squeezed out a close match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Velasco quickly silenced her opponent, 6-3, 6-0. The doubles competition was shortened due to inclement weather and time constraints, so the Irish did not really get a chance to rally back. In the end they fell to Duke, 2-5. The netters did not have a chance to recover as they had to face Wake Forest the next day. In the singles competition, the Irish were strong in the middle of their line-up. At No. 3 singles, Crabtree annihilated Wake Forest's Nicola Kaiwai, 6-0, 6-0. Then at the fourth position Velasco captured a close victory over Maggie Harris, 6-7, 6-2, 7-6. Gowen pummeled the Deacon's Cristina Caparis, 6-3, 6-3. The doubles competition started off heading in the right

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Certain co-workers may be feeling rambunctious. They are liable to be stubborn, too. Steer clear of them as much as possible. A letter or phone message brings new hope. 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21 ): You and a newcomer seem to speak the same language. What about forming a business partner­ship together? You will need to con­sult lawyers and accountants before formalizing the deal. 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Home or family-related finan­cial interests require your attention. Playing games in romance would be a mistake. You feel gung-ho about a 

•
secret plan. 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Go ahead and throw yourself whole­heartedly into a new project. Your faith and energy will carry you to victory. The news from overseas may be disconcerting. A romantic interlude is best postponed. Be patient. 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Forge ahead with an ambitious plan. Your efforts will provide a strong foundation for a wonderful organi­zation. Influential people like your style and let you know it! A flexible approach helps you seize unexpect­ed opportunities.

Sweeping the region

Region. The 26th-ranked Irish pushed their regional record to a perfect 10-0 with a 7-0 victory over the Purdue Boilermakers yesterday. 
The squad's overall record improved to 15-8 and they picked up their fourth win in a row in the midwest region. The young Boilermakers looked tough coming in, post­ing a 13-4 record, but they provided little trouble for the Irish. 

Captain Mike Sprouse dis­cussed playing the role of the favorite. 
"The big thing keeping us focused has been that we have taken a lot of hits on the national level," Sprouse said. "So, we have a feeling of relief when we come in the region even though we are favored." 
The Nos. 2 and 3 doubles combinations earned the first point of the day for the Irish. Veterans J. J. O'Brien and Ryan Simme got the ball 

Freshman Brian Patterson once again had a strong performance as the Irish knocked off Purdue, 7-0. 
rolling with an impressive win at the No. 3 slot defeating G. T. Cozad and Steve Brizendine 8­1. 
The dynamic duo of Jakup Pietrowski and Brian Patterson picked up their thir­teenth win of the season as the Boilermaker team of Jason Smith and Jamie Gordon could only manage two games. 
Pietrowski explained why he and Patterson have an out­standing 13-5 record. 
"We compliment each ot~er's game. Brian is very athletic and covers the net on my serve. We're very solid and we keep the ball in play." 
"So, a team is going to have to play pretty well to beat us." 
Purdue's freshman tandem of Derek Myers and Christopher James picked up an 8-4 win over the Irish's top team of Sprouse and Jason Pun. 
On the singles side, the Irish ­dominated from top to bottom. Only one match went three sets. 
Boilermaker freshman G.T. Cozad, coming from a top­notch high school program at Chaminade College Prep. in St. Louis, Missouri, commented on the match. 
"We came in knowing that Notre Dame was going to be a tough squad, but we gave our best throughout the match. Things just did not seem to fall for us today, at all." 
Purdue is a young team lead by freshman in their top three positions. Sprouse easily han­dled Chris James , 6-1, 6-0. At No. 3 singles Pietrowski bat­tled Gordon in the first set to 6-4, before taking over in the third 6-2. 
Also dominating in the sec­ond stanza was Patterson at No. 4 singles. He needed a tie breaker in the first, but his

Freshman catcher keys victory over Chicago State 
By T. RYAN KENNEDY SportS Writer 

It didn't take long for Notre Dame to answer a six-run, first-inning rampage by Chicago State yesterday at The Eck. The Irish scored five runs on just two hits in the first two innings, then pep­pered the Cougars for four runs on eight hits late in the game for the 10-7 win. 
While freshman Jeff Wagner and George Restovich performed the wood­work, it was Pat Davis who calmed the Cougars early on. In just one-third of an

inning, starter Craig Allen had allowed four hits and six runs. Coach Paul Mainieri had his finger on the panic but­ton. Then Davis, who had made only four appearances all year previous to today, rose to the occasion. · 
"As confident as I normally feel, I didn't think we'd hold them to only one run for the rest of the game," said Mainieri. "Davis and [Brad] Lidge pitched great. Both had been waiting their turns patiently, they got the oppor­tunity and they took advantage of it." 
"I was throwing a lot of strikes out there," said Davis. "I was concerned [about the early deficit], but I knew we would start hitting the ball and score some runs." 
Lidge was also stellar from the mound, allowing only one hit and fan-

Jun~or Erin Gowen claimed a victory at No. 5 singles for the Irish against Wake Forest, 6-3, 6-3. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough as Notre Dame fell 4-5 to the Deacons. 
Freshmen soar through ambivalent weekend 
By KATHLEEN LOPEZ SportS Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team's goal was to start their road trip off on the right foot. They did just that by de­feating the fifth-ranked Texas Longhorns last Thursday. 
The team was looking to extend their streak against the third-ranked Duke Blue Devils, but the Devils were too much for the Irish to handle. The eighth-ranked Irish then turned around and took on the eleventh-ranked Wake Forest Deacons the next day. The team lost a close match to the Deacons, and watched their record fall to 1 7-5. 
"This past week went up and down for us," stated head coach Jay Louderback. "We wanted to at least win one of the three big matches, and we did. All of the matches were close ones. 
"Texas was a great win for us. Duke was close, and we lost a tight one to Wake Forest." 
The Irish started the week­end out strong, as they claimed a tight victory over the fifth­ranked Longhorns, 5-4. The Irish saw some strong play from the freshmen. Freshmen Jennifer Hall, ranked twentieth in the country, faced the eighth-ranked player, Farley
