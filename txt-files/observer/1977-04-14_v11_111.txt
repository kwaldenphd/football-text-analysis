After this year, RA's will be appointed only after applicants have proven a financial need for the job, according to Fr. Terrence Lally, assistant vice-president of Student Affairs. 
Lally said that five out of eight ND students fit into the financial need category. Rectors will be allowed to pick "the very finest'' candidates from this group, he added. 
Lally noted that RA jobs will still go to the best qualified, but he added that "a lot of qualified people" who don't need fnancial aid aren't going to get a job. Student Affairs, Lally said, has its primary responsibility to those students who need financial aid. 
"There are kids leaving college with debts, we want to help them," Lally said. "I personally agree with the need factor being a criteria next year. Grants in aid, scholar­ships, and employment are desig­ned to aid this need." 
Rectors may still want to debate this issue, Lally added. He said most rectors do not see financial need as important a criteria as merit. 
Fr. Raymond Holtz, rector of Morrissey, said, "I think the first 

Tavern problems discussed with owners, neighbors, city 
by Katie Kerwin News Editor 
Student Body President Dave Bender and Dean of Students James Roemer met yesterday with the South Bend Board of Public Safety, concerned citizens, tavern m\ ners and other interested parties in an attempt to find a solution to noise. litter and nuisance problems in the Corby-Eddy tavern area. 

Members of the Northeast Neighborhood Council, which has been fighting the bar-related prob­lems for years, were present at the meeting in the Board of Public Safety meeting room in the County­City Building, as well as Col!ncil­man Roger Parent, who represents the area and Division Chief Glenn Terry of the South Bend Police. Representatives of The Library, Nickie's and Bridget McGuire's Filling Station, all bars in the area in question, also attended. 
The session was arranged follow­ing a recent increase in neighbor­hood complaints, which prompted a letter from Parent bringing the matter to the board's attention again. The board agreed at a meeting on March 23 that a cooperative effort was needed to solve the problem and invited the various groups involved to come together with the board to discuss the matter. 
Friction between bar owners and consideration is to get qualified people. Then; if it's a choice between two people equally quali­fied, it should be based on financial need." 
Sally Duffy, rector of Lewis, said she did not favor next year's plan. "I think RA is a skill position, and should be treated as such," she said. 
Other rectors, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed with Holtz and Duffy. One pointed out that RA jobs were basically differ­ent than other jobs given to 
Vol. XI, No. 111 
students who need financial aid. He said, for example, that a student did not need be as highly qualified for work in the dining halls. 
Lally said he thought the rectors had many good arguments to present. They have from now until next fall to present a different proposal, he said, and "maybe they can change things." Lally added that until recently he was in agreement with the rectors. 
However, Lally said most rectors were uninformed about the respon­sibilities of the University to those in financial need. He also disag­reed with rectors who claim they might be left with no qualified applicants next spring. 
An announcement that RA jobs would be given out only to appli­cants who needed financial aid was made early last fall by Bro. Just 
Paczesny, vice-president of Stu­dent Affairs. This agreement had been reached during a meeting of University officers in Feb., 1976. 
The reason this financial need system wasn't used in the RA 


patrons and those living in the residential areas surrounding the bars has been a problem for many years, but recent increases in noise, litter, parking violations and public nuisances caused by patrons leaving the bars have spurred angry residents to further action. Frustration resulting from years of fruitless efforts to curb the problem has compounded their annoyance. 
Stricter enforcement of existing laws was generally agreed upon by neighborhood residents, bar owners, board members and Roem­er as a necessary measure for alleviating the problems in the Corby Eddy area. As board mem­ber Louvenia Cain summed up the situation, "We seem to have indentified the main problems as litter, noise, open beverage con­tainers (being carried out of bars) and double parking. Enforcement of the law is the solution." She remarked that if police cracked down on the area, "within one month it would be cleared up." 

Roemer also spoke strongly for enforcement of laws regarding underage drinking, public intoxi­cation and disorderly conduct. He stated that he not only favored more strict enforcement of the law, he would encourage it. He warned that students who find themselves in ·violation of the law should not expect much sympathy from the University. 
"They will have to abide by the laws. If not, they'll pay the penalty," Roemer said. He added that 5tudents must learn to deal with the law and that an arrest and spending the night in jail might be "a good educational opportunity." 
Roemer said that University rules do cover off-campus situa­tions of this nature and that a new code is not needed to cover them, as had been suggested by Kanser earlier in the meeting. He also responded negatively to Kanser's suggestion that bar owners turn offenders over to Roemer for disciplinary action. While he said he would be willing to deal with students who bar owners felt had chronic problems, but had not broken the law, he would prefer to see law-breakers arrested. 
Roemer also reminded the resi­dents of the many community service projects Notre Dame stu­dents are involved in, including Logan Center and the Neighbor­hood Study Help program. He pointed out that those causing trouble in the bar areas constitute only a small part of the total student body. Roemer offerend a personal commitment to "do his best to support the neighborhood association in their efforts." 
Bender reiterated Roemer's tone of concern and support. "Student Government has a commitment to see that justice is done and there is obivously an injustic here." He

selection process this year, Lally said, was his own fault. This fall Lally urged all students to apply for RA, regardless of their financial situation. Lally said then that he believed 80 per cent of the applica­tions would not be rejected. 
But this year, under the new system, less than SO per cent of the applicants would have been accep­ted. In Lewis Hall, for example, six out of Duffy's top seven choices would have been rejected because they did not need financial aid. 
The rectors, when they learned less than half their selections would be approved by Student Affairs. petitioned against the new system. Apparently, Lally said, the rectors had forgotten or "not taken ser­iously" the decision of Feb., 1976. 
The rectors' petition contained two proposals. First, the rectors temporarily wanted to return to the RA selection system of former years. Second, they wanted to form a task force to study the situation for next year. 
Paczesny agreed to the first proposal two weeks ago. Accord­ing to Lally, this means that Student Affairs abandoned the criteria of financial need for this year's selections. 
Because of this change in policy, several ND students were left in the dark. Some students were

Security releases intruder after Farley incidents 
by Tam Byrne 
c.mp..F.dltGI' 
An unidentified intruder appre­hended in Farley Hall last night, after barging into the rooms of several residents, was reportedly releasted later after questioning by campus security. 
Although security officials re­fused to comment on the incident to the OIJBervm, a Farley resident who called security at 1 a.m. was told by Officer Galloway of security that the man had been let go after questioning," and had not been turned over to city police. 
"He told us that South Bend police had no jursidiction over campus matters," said Kathleen Kelly, who was in her room when the intruder entered. She added that no statements had been taken by security from her or the girls in her section who had seen the man. 
Witnesses described the man as between 20 and 25 years old, shabbily dressed and extremely dirty with an unpleasant odor. "My roommate couldn't see him be­cause she didn't have her contacts in," remarked Farley resident Nan­cy Cox," but she could smell him." He also carried a large screwdriver. 
Several witnesses also reported that the intruder appeared to be under the influence of drugs. Farley rectress Sr. Jean Lenz 
commented that "he really seems 
to be sick." 
According to Lenz, the episode began when the man suddenly entered the room ofsome freshmen on the first floor of the hall and 
began talking to them. He left the room after a few minutes. but the students were uncertain how to react and failed to notify Sl.."CClrity immediately. It was not until the man visited rooms on the hall's second floor that security was alerted. 
The intruder reportedly inquired on tht> second floor whether he was in a women's dorm, and knocked on several doors. He then entered one open room while its occupant was on the telephone, and announ­ced that he wanted to search under the bed for "pieces of a woman's body.'' He later made a similar remark, saying that he was from maintenance and that pieces of a woman's body had been stuffed down the toilet." 

He then proceeded to the third floor and entered the room of Kathleen Kelly and Marge Meag­her, where he stated he was from security and expressed concern for their safety. "Our door was open and he just walked in and stood there," said Meagher. She repor­ted that the intruder, while holding the screwdriver, told her and Kelly

The assembly first approved the allocation of funds for activities for off-campus and day students, with the stipulation that if the monies were not all used this year they could be carried over to next year. Until this time these students did not benefit from the activities funds, although they contributed to them.

Bicycle club to hold meeting 
The Notre Dame Cycle Touring Club will hold their first meeting of the semester tonight at 7:00 pm in the basement of LaFortune. This meeting is open to all persons interested in bicycling for pleasure or racing. 
The club sponsors weekly rides leaving every Saturday from the library circle at 9:00 am. These rides, usually conducted in conjun­ction with the Midwest Bicycle Association, are through scenic backroads of the Michiana region. Ride distances are determined individually since there are always two or three alternative routes from which to choose. Distances vary from a minimum of 10 to 25, 35, 
and even 60 mile loops. 
The club also conducts how-to sessions on bicycle care and main­tenance, proper riding ha~its, where to ride, and other topics of interest. These sessions are con­ducted at regularly scheduled monthly meetings. 
In the planning stages are a short race around the campus, a summer: 
tour over part of the "Bikecenten· nial Trail" and a fall tour over October break. The club is also in the process of negotiating for cycling discounts at local bike shops. For more information contact Russ at 288-5192 or Paul at 8933 .

'Lacks direction' 

SLC members defend viability of group 
AN TOST AL IRISH WAKE COMMI'ITEE presents: 
by Barb Langhenry Copy Editor 

In rema::ks assessing the past year, some of the present Student Life Council (SLC) members des­cribed the council as lacking direc­tion but indicated it remains a viable organization despite its diffi­culties. 
The SLC was organized in 1968 by the Board of Trustees as a body composed of an equal number of students, faculty and administra­tive representatives authorized to consider matters under the res­ponsibility of the vice-president for Student Affairs. In a report con­cerning the future of the SLC written in 1975 it is described as both a legislative council and a consultative body. 
This year's SLC has concentrated its discussion around the issues of social space, human sexuality and its indentity. Michael Casey, chair­man and former student body vice-president, stated in a letter to  the members that the SLC, after changing its focus to an issue­oriented structure in January, "Did some research and made some recommendations" with the help of outside resource people in the areas of social space and human sexuality. 
Although members saw valuable discussion coming from the council this year, some of them commonly noted confusion as to the body's role and the organization of the meetings as two problems which hinderdl the progress of the Coun­cil. 
SLC identity unclear 
Some members view the SLC as 

hampered at the beginning of the 
year by prolonged discussion of 
identity. Bro. Just Paczesny, vice­
president for Student Affairs, 
stated that people were elected 
who did not know the background 
and there was the problem of 
explaining the SLC to new mem­
bers. 
Some of the members view the 

council as a legislative body, while 
others see it as an advisory body. 
All of those interviewed agreed 
however that it is a group neces-

sarily composed of faculty, admini­strators and students which gives these three groups a chance to share views on problems related to student life. 
Paczesny sees the group as one involved not only with the student's social life, but also their "physical and intellectual development, as well as spiritual." 
The SLC is a place that can be of assistance to making life on cam­pus more pleasant--as pleasant as it can be made under the circum­stances because the University is a large operation, Paczesny asserted. He sees the SLC as solving the problems of day-to-day living on the campus. 
Engineering Professor William Biles, vice-chairman of the faculty senate, views the council as similar to Paczesny's description. He noted the SLC as providing the advice and guidance to the Office of Student Affairs. 
Sally Duffy, rectress of Lewis Hall, sees the group as a legislative body which "did not function in that way this year." She attributed this to a lack of structure at meetings and a failure to deal with concrete issues. 
Sr. Jane Pitz of Campus Ministry 

on the other hand said, "I don't see 
need for it as a legislative body.'' 
She also added she does not see 
"SLC as an initiator of rule change 
unless it is brought to their 
knowledge by a group of students 
or another group." She did note a 
problem with identity but stated 
that each member feels differently 
about it. 
Casey also did not see the SLC as 

having a legislative function be­
cause "the body is too large." He 
noted that their purpose this year 
was to ''bring to the surface things 
that are wrong with the Univer­
sity." He also stated, "We aren't 
the body to lay definite plans in the 
areas we dealt with this year." 
Casey admitted, "Our purpose 

has never really been defined. We 
tried to do it at the beginning of 
this year but got hung up." He 
noted the council was a "recom­
mendatory" group. 
Peter Haley, south quad repre­

sentative, sees the council's pur­
pose as to look at definite student 
needs on campus on the theoretical 
and practical levels, working 
through students, faculty and 
administrators. He views the body 
as having alegislativefunction. He 
described the SLC as "more of a 
group specifically powered to 
approve rules and regulations.'' 
"Necessary policies as they arise 

should be dealt with by the SLC," 
he noted. He added that they are 
not "precisely fulfilling this pur­
pose." 
Haley stated that this may 

possibly be due to the success of 
last year's council in solving isses 
such as the revision of the Huddle 
and Crossrads Park and thus 
clearing the agenda for this year's 
council. 
Meeting organization 

Members of the council also noted meeting organization as a problem this year. Paczesny noted that "perhaps the organization part is lacking efficiently and follow­through on proposals." 
Both Duffy and Biles noted the meetings were more discussion­type meetings and this took away from the business aspect of the council. Biles noted, however, the discussions were valuable and "will eventually bear fruit." 
The move to the discussion-type meeting was made in January and Casey said it was done because "we hadn't done anything first semester and thought by changing the format to more topic-oriented meetings we would be more effec­
. ..
tive. 
Most of the members inter­viewed suggested definite agendas be set for the meetings. Both Biles and Haley suggest following Rob· ert's Rules of Order. Paczesny suggest having definite dates for meetings and definite agendas or setting of goals. Other members noted meetings should be held once a month and Biles suggested 
organizing into specific standing committees. 
Other problems cited included the lack of major issues to deal with a lack of continuity, both in carry-over from year to year for people and issues and the position of the chairman. The ideas of a student chairman having a dual role was noted as also hindering to the council. 
All of the interviewed members see the SLC as a viable organi­zation and cited no need for a change in its structure. Instead they noted the need for a change in the organization of its approach. 
Proposal for activites review Paczesny called attention to a proposal he and Prof. Michael 
Crowe of the General Program drafted that was described by Paczesny as "one of the great things presented, but never voted upon." 
This proposal calls for contin­ually reviewing and reporting on student-related activities, each activity coming up for review every five years for one semester. 
Biles stated, "This proposal could be a definitive way SLC could provide advice and guidance for student activities." 
Haley sees it as a device which would add more stability to the group. He added, "It not only improves services, but raises prob­lems with services to which the SLC could address itself." 
Haley remarked that the prob­lems and discussions this year have

Save SLC from SBP 
Today Student Body President Dave 
Bender presents his proposal to replace 
the Student life Council with a new 
Campus life Council to the student affairs 
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees. 
Bender's proposal is outlined in his column 
on this page. It is obvious both that the 
Sl.C has been ineffective this year and that 
the many problems of hall life deserve 
much more consideration than they have 
yet received. Rather than replace the one 
with the other, however, the Cl.C should 
be adapted as a subcommittee of a 
stronger, more organized Sl.C. 
The failure of the Sl.C this year is due to 
a lack of direction and confusion over its purpose, rather than to any inherent structural defect. Members of the Council are uncertain whether the Sl.C is a legislative body, an advisory council or a simple forum for discussion. Many complain that the meetings are disorgan­ized, that there is no set agenda and little continuity from meeting to meeting. Many issues are considered, but the discussion rarely results in any form of 
proposal. 
Despite these problems the SLC has the potential with its present composition to deal with vital issues. It was the SLC that made the first parietals proposal to be accepted by the Trustees. Last year the SLC provided a forum for much-needed discussion of the calendar issue--an issue affecting student life that was also of mapr concern to faculty an~ administrators. 
Under Bender's proposal, issues such as the calendar, cuniculum changes, and 8 
a.m. examination policy would be left solely to the closed-door proceedings of the Academic Council. Presently, the mapr vi-rtue of the SI.C is that it generates pubHc discussion of important questions. 
By drastically reducting faculty repre­sentation on his CI.C to one token member, Bender is effectively quashing an important voice on campus and student life. In addition to acting as a kind of neutral "buffer" between students anC.. administration, faculty members possess background and expertise that is valuable to the deliberations of the council. There are also a number of major questions that require the input of faculty represen­tatives, such as the calendar and the. upcoming debate over the mandatory senior values seminar policy.

'Reverse Discrimination' 
irma herrera &ted maIoney 
Issues of this magnitude should not be 
abandoned by the abolition of the SLC and 
the substitution of a body too limited in 
scope to deal effectively with them. 
Another principal difficulty with the proposal is that it abruptly dismisses one fifth of the student body--the off-campus students. Bender has said that their concerns are more properly handled by the off-campus commission, and it is true that the SLC has rarely considered subjects other than those related to on-campus life. But many of these issues are of interest to all students. The parietals question, for example, affects any student who visits a dormitory occupied by members of the opposite sex. Just as importantly, off­campus students may have valuable insights into the undesirable aspects of hall life and suggestions for improve­ments. 
Bender is right in pushing for a body that will focus its attention specifically on the many issues of campus (hall) life: parietals, the alcohol policy, judiciaJ boards, social space. Many of these issues have been untouched or superficially treated by the SLC this year. 
Bender also is right in trying to bring the rectors mto formal discussions on hall life. 
The best solution to the dilemma is to give the CI.C a trial run as a subcommittee of the Student life Council. The SLC has a standing committee on campus life, cur­rently composed of five Council members. SLC committees in the past have included a number of non-Council members such as the social space committee that followed up on the Committee on Undergraduate life recommendations. We suggest that Bender's proposed CLC, be adapted as the Campus life Committee of the SLC. The CLC would develop concrete proposals and present them to the SLC as a whole for discussion and approval. 
A necessary part of this proposal is the strengthening of the Student life Council. With better leadership and more organized procedures, the SLC and its membership have the potential to be an effective legislative and advisory body. We have nothing to lose by keeping the SLC and developing the CLC as a part of it. We have a great deal to lose by equating Student life with Hall life and abandoning other important aspects to less represen­tative and publicly accountable bodies.

U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether or not a medical school admissions program that gives preference, for a limited number of its admissions slots, to racial minority applicants is unconstitu­tional. If it is held to be unconstitutional, it may very well spell the end to affirmative actie>n programs throughout the country. 
The case is Bakke v. Regents of the University of California. It arises from a suit filed in 1973 by old, and a space program engineer -who was twice refused admission to the medical school at the University of California-Davis. He challenged the medical schools "special admissions" program, al­leging that it discriminated against him on the basis of his race since "less qualified" minority appli­;:ants were admitted while he was excluded. The trial court found in his favor, and last September the California Supreme Court affirmed, prompting the present appeal to the nation's high court. 
Afftrmative action and Hi :.>rity admissions programs have come under increasing attack of late, primarily on the basis that they constitute "reverse discrimina· tion," against the majority, i.e., whites. The last time the court was

Economics professor claims 

Gov't regulations hurt business 
by Mark Perry 
Government agencies and their regulations are having a severe effect on business, according to Dr. Murray L. Weidenbaum. 
Weidenbaum, director of the 
Center for the study of American 
Business and professor of econom­
ics at Washington University in St. 
Louis, spoke about the problems 
associated with the changing rela­
tionship between business and 
government in the United States at 
a lecture at the Library Auditorium 
last night. 

"In the United States there has 
been greater government participa­
tion in business decision-making in 
recent years," Weidenbaum said. 
"No business official today can 
operate without considering a mul­
titude of governmental restrictions 
and regulations," he continued, 
"and these types of management 
decisions subject to government 
control are fundamental to the 
business system.'' 
Weidenbaum added that "virtu· 
ally every major department of a 
typical corporation has one or more 
counterparts in a federal agency 
which controls or influences its 
internal decision-making." 
Weidenbaum then cited several 
examples of how these federal 
agencies and their regulations ad­
versely affect the businesses in the 
United States. 
In St. Louis, Weidenbaum said, 
the Consumer Products Safety 
Commission recalled a windshield 
cleaner fluid manufactured by Ace 
Hardware because it did not have a 
label indicating that the fluid could 
not be made . non-poisonous. 
Instead of merely asking the manu­
facturer to place this label on their

containers, the Commission order­ed Ace Hardware to pour the solvent down the drain. 
W eidenbaum said that this is the way the bureaucrat thinks; he is only concerned about his safety in his job. In this case, the label might fall off, so the bureaucrat uses the more expensive way to ensure that nothing will go wrong. 
In an attempt to relieve the present energy crisiS, Weiden­baum said that the government tried to find out why synthetic fuels were not being made. They found that with all the regulations gover­ning the manufacturing of these fuels, the corporations could not afford to make them. 
Studies also showed that the minimum wage law was having a 
severe effect ori teenage unemploy­ment, Weidenbaum said. These laws made it necessary for the companies to hire the experienced adult workers rather than the 1 unexperienced teenagers. · . 
The Equal Opportunity Employ­ment Program also affects the jobless rate, he noted. Companies take longer to place people in available jobs because they have to be sure they meet government regulations. 
A severe example ofthe effect of government regulations was the case where a clerical error forced a company out of business. Weiden­baum continued. Marlin Toy Company, which manufactures rat­tles for infants, was told by the Food and Drug Administration that its rattles were dangerous because of rattle, Weidenbaum said. The FDA said that the infant might break the rattle and then swallow the pellet, so the product was banned from the market. Marlin corrected this problem by removing the pellets from the rattles. 
But in the beginning of the fall, the FDA released its banned products Jist to various stores, and the Marlin rattles were still inclu­ded on the list. The FDA refused to correct the error in time for the Christmas season. The Marlin Toy Company was forced to lay off three-fourths of its workers and eventually went out of business. 
Weidenbaum will conclude his lecture on Friday, beginning at 
3:30 pm at Hayes-Healy Auditori­um.

said that the newly-appointed off­campus commissioner, Joe Un­gashick will be responsible for relations between the community and students, in addition to the traditional duties fo co-ordinating on-campus and off-campus rela­tions. 
Bender said Ungashick will meet frequently with tavern owners and the northeast Neighborhood Coun­cil to see what activities the student body will engage in. He added that he feels the problem is one of attitud and that he will try to make students more aware of the prob­lem. 
The meeting resulted in· the formation of a coalition to serve as a task force to continue working on the problem. According to Franklin Morse. chairman of the Board of Public Safety, who suggested the coalition. lack of communication between the different parties con­cerned is one of the main problems in this issue. 
Bender indicated that the Notre Dame student body would support such a proposal, in the interests of open communication. Ungashick will represent Notre Dame students on the coalition forum. John Roos, a member of the Northeast Neigh­borhood Council and a government professor at Notre Dame, will act as a spokesman for area residents and Rich Kanser, owner of the Library will represent the tavern owners. Eugene Dziubinski, a Board of Public Safety member, will also be a part of the forum. 
The forum is to act as a task force in order to see that the ideas brought out as the meeting are pursued and that the lines of communication remain open. "This reoccurence of meetings every four months is not solving anything," Kanser said, referring to a series of discussions in the past, which have not brought a solution to the problem. 
"I would like to see a mechanism ~me out of this meeting that would 
a.~ake students and other tavern patrons aware of the problem and that we're trying to solve it," Dziubinski explained. "We want to make communication available to

that "some people can't handle their drugs ... women have been cut to pieces." According to Kelly, he then said, "you look like the type who chould handle yourself, but I thought I'd check you out." 
The man then began to remove pieces of paper from his pocket which he said were stained with "women's blood." None of the witnesses observed blood on the scraps of paper or anywhere on the person of the intruder, to indicate that he had participated in any kind of violence. Meagher said the 

papers did appear to be the property of security. 
The man also entered the third floor room of Nancy Cox where he again attempted to remove the scraps of paper from his pockets. While in the room, a small knife fell to the floor, according to Cox. 
A male Notre Dame student visiting Farley noticed the intruder and came to the aid of the residents, asking the man for some · identification. He refused and be-' came angry, swearing repeatedly and declaring that he "could learn in a week what you learn in five

f SMC workshop on majors tonight 
The Saint Mary's College Career Development Center (CDC) is sponsoring a workshop for infor­mation on how to choose a major tonight at 8 p.m. in the Regina Hall auditorium. The purpose of this program is to acquaint stu­dents, primarily underclassmen, with the decision making process involved in choosing a major course of study. 

toughening up some sort is neces­
sary, at least everyone should be 
notified beforehand.'' 
Bauer told those at the meeting that she had been informed by agents of the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC) that there is a law which prohibits patrons from taking open contain­ers of alcoholic beverages out of bars. Plastic cups carried out of the bars constitutes a large part of the trash that litters lawns and side­walks on weekend mornings. There had previously been some confu-· sion among tavern owners and residents about the existence of such a law. In the light of this uncertainty, Bauer suggested that an additional ordinance might be passed to re-inforce the rule. 
Stepped-up. police enforcement of the law was discussed and bar owners affirmed that security per­sonell posted at exits would attempt to prevent patrons from leaving with cups in their hands. Nickie Bilello, owner of Nickie's, noted that his establishment does employ someone to stop customers from taking drinks out with them, but commented on the difficulty of enforcing such a rule, especially on busy nights. 
The neighborhood council, which has repeatedly stressed that it is not anti-student, suggested to the board that litter and noise ordin­ance warning signs listing possible fines or penalties be posted in the area to warn and inform students. 
Tavern owners also agreed to handle clean-up in the area sur­rounding their property among themselves, mapping out the speci­fic area for which each will be responsible, in accordance with a suggestion made by Theresa Bauer, a part-owner of Bridget McGuire's. Previous clean-up pledges have been concerned most­ly with only the bar property and the immediately !iUrrounding area and have been unsatisfactory to residents, for the most part. 
The neighborhood council accep­ted the bar owners' offer to hire local youths to keep the area clean. Northeast Neighborhood Council President Arthur Quigley said he 
afterward and took the man into custody. 
Lenz and several residents praised the speed with which security had responded to the call. The rectress however voiced her concern that the man would be released and attempt to repeat the offenses, unaware at the time of her statement that he had been freed. Galloway stated that· Secur­ity Director Arthur Pears would have to make any statement on the incident. 
their own clean-up, but agreed to supply bar owners with the names of neighborhood youths who could be hired. Quigley called for endor­sement of Bauer's suggestion of designated clean-up territory. 
The neighborhood council distri­buted copies of a summary of their history of grievances and a set of proposals before the meeting. Quigley outlined a series of attempts the council has made in the last four years to resolve the problem and lack of results in most cases. 
Bilello commented later on what he called an attitued of antagonism toward the bar owners on the part of residents. He also said he would 
like to be notified personally of complaints about his establishment or patrons, rather that facing accusations later. 
Mark Wagner, an attorney rep­
resenting The Library and Nickie's "---:~D~e~t=e~c~tl~·o~n~O~t;I:~X;O;t;i;c;A;il';'e;niiDieiife;c;tis~-.1
cited clean-up efforts, constructive proposals, and the fact that noise from inside is down as evidence of the bar owner's concern. He also mentioned petitions, which he said show that local residents don't oppose the bars. He called for co-operation and "non-harassing tactics." 
Residents of the Corby-Eddy locale gave testimony about the effects of noise and litter in their neighborhood. Roos, one of those who spoke, emphasized that the future of their neighborhoods is at stake. He questioned the validity of some of the signatures on the petitions Wagner had cited. Roos also favored strict enforcement of existing laws and suggested the possibility of firtes for bar owners who do no prevent patrons from leaving with drinks in their hands.

shek." This belief was expressed widely by both moderates and conservatives and it was included in the 1952 Republican platform. May traced the origin of the "Loss of China" theory through the developmentsof20th-centuryU.S.­Chinese relations. 
May attributed the myth of the "loss" of China to Americans' "feelings of a special relationship with China...an admiration for China...heightened public anxiety
of the era," and the "strains involved in conducting a limited war in Korea." 
Americans had a "psychic need for scapegoats" who were accused by "unscrupulous demagogues that no one held in check." May attributed some of this demagog­uery to a "desperate feeling" by Republican leaders after Dewey's shocking defeat in 1948 which
