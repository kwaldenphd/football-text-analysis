WORLD BRIEFS 
A woman construction worker in Cairns. Australia filed a lawsuit Monday claiming she was fired .because her good looks distracted male employees and caused them to have accidents on the job. "Is it my fault? I shouldn't get the sack because men can't keep their minds on the job," said 24-year-old Tanya Graovac, who brought the action at the Human Rights and Equal Opportu­nity Commission. Ms. Graovac, who was dismissed in June, told the paper she didn't mind "wolf whistles" and suggestive remarks from male workers but that she was not prepared to accept being fired for being too good-looking. 
One of Italy's leading museums has called the extermi­nator to halt an invasion of woodworms, officials said Mon­day.The Borghese Gallery, located in Villa Borghese Park near the Piazza del Popolo, will be closed Sept. 26 to Oct. 10 for extensive wood worm extermination, said Luigi Conte of the Ministry of Cul­ture.The museum displays paintings and sculptures dating from Roman times to the 19th century, including masterpieces by Botti­celli and Caravaggio. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The United States intends to give Hungary permanent most-favored nation trade status, President Bush said Monday. In Budapest, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the United States was negotiating toward a comprehensive pact to "support Hungary's efforts to develop a freer political system and to create and expand private enterprise," said Mosbacher, who is in Bu­dapest for talks with Hungarian officials. 
Dorothy Walker Bush, the president's 88-year-old mother, was admitted to Greenwich Hospital in Conn. with pneumonia Monday. a White House spokeswoman said."She's in stable condi­tion and is expected to improve." said Alixe Glen."She had not been feeling well last week. She had been suffering a mild respira­tory condition," Brown said. Mrs. Bush was "resting comfort­ably" Monday afternoon, Brown said. 
Actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. of "The FBI" television series, testified Monday in Charlotte, N.C. that the PTL board of direc­tors. on which he once served, was little more than a rubber stamp for television evangelist Jim Bakker."It was called a board of dimctors, but at no time did it operate like one," said Zimbal­ist. Asked if he recalled approving a $390,000 bonus for Bakker, Zimbalist said, "Oh no. oh no."

Information comp1led from Observer w~res and Observer staff reports 
Just a few short weeks ago the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban De­
velopment came under fire for wrongdoing and 
misuse of funds, problems which apparently 
have plagued the department since the Carter 
administration and are just now coming to 
light. 
Ironically, the wrongdoing was uncovered 
by the current administration and exposed 
problems which occurred largely during the 
Reagan administration. Congress. however, 
jumped at the chance to pick up the ball and 
throw shots at the executive branch agency. 
asking how and why such ethical misdeeds could 
possibly have taken place. 
What were the allegations of wrongdoing at 
BUD? In sum, that money did not go where it 
was needed. Federal money which could have 
made a sizable impact in helping the poor find 
housing went instead for development projects 
which were unneeded and benefitted only the de­
velopers. The criteria often used in the dis­
bursement of funds was who knew who, not 
where the money would be best spent. 
On the surface these problems seem serious 
and hefty indeed. The waste by government of 
billions of taxpayer dollars deserves the atten­
tion of every American, and demands an investi­
gation. What is even more serious, however, is 
that Congress is just as guilty in the BUD scan­
dal yet will probably slip by without any blame 
for its role in the sticky affair. . 
The charges at HUD are influence peddling, 
yet Congress engages in its own influence ped­
dling openly, at HUD and at other executive 
branch agencies, on a daily basis, and without 
a word of protest from the media or the Ameri­
can public. Top-level HUD officials are accused 
of being "lobbied" by powerful outside interests 
(an accusation which is true), yet Congress lob­
bies executive branch agencies daily on behalf of 
its constituents without any political backfire. 
Congressmen are encouraged and even ex­pected by their constituents to use their influ­ence in securing lucrative federal grants or de­velopment projects for their home district. In the public's eyes, the securing of a BUD grant worth millions of dollars by a Congressman for his district is not only good but will help ensure his reelection. In contrast, the same practice by those outside the government is referred to as unethical. Of course, they are both unethical. Whence the double standard? 
The HUD affair is a good example of how on a larger scale Congress has used a double standard to judge the activities of the executive branch, a standard it would never dream of ap­plying to itself. The double standard often turns up in the "criminalization" of policy differences between members of Congress and members of the administration. This criminalization dates back to the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, one of the many constitutionally suspect laws passed during the post-Watergate and post­Vietnam war era when presidential power was at its lowest point in our history (other suspect

laws include the War Powers Resolution and 
the Budget and Impoundment Act.) The Ethics 
in Government Act launched the era of the inde­
pendent counsel, or more accurately, the special 
prosecutor. 

Special prosecutors enjoy nearly limitless power to investigate alleged "ethical" lapses of executive branch officials without any thought of due process. The appointment of a special prosecutor is triggered automatically by law whenever there is the "grounds to investigate" a particular person, not whether there is probable cause that a crime has been committed. This so turns the traditional standard of justice on its head as to threaten the stability of our constitu­tionally created government, and seriously threatens civil rights often taken for granted in this country. A crime is not investigated to find a guilty party, but rather a person is investi­gated to determine if he or she has committed a crime. 
Government arguably has no greater power over the citizens of this country than the power to prosecute. The power to check prosecutors was given to the executive branch, to prevent a prosecutor from being overtaken by an excess of ambition, but independent counsels are inten­tionally freed from such oversight so that they may target executive branch officials. This has made it possible for members of Congress, most notably Democratic members, to target admin­istration officials with criminal investigations when little or no evidence of wrongdoing exists. Even if the special prosecutor. using his or her nearly unlimited resources, fails to turn up any evidence, the damage done to a person's reputa­tion is long-lasting. After being cleared of any wrongdoing after a zealous special prosecutor investigation, for example, former Labor Secre­tary Ray Donovan could only ask which office he could go to to "get his reputation back." 
Certainly not to the offices of the members of Congress. With the special prosecutor the legislative branch has usurped the constitutional perogatives of the executive {though with a certain degree of presidential acquiescence.) Congress should recognize its mistake and abolish the special prosecutor, and President Bush should begin now to protect his administration from political attacks from Congress disguised as charges of ethical wrongdoing.

'No kickbacks' with Mich. tix 
By SARA MARLEY Senior Staff Reporter 
The results of a Student Union Board investigation into alleged misconduct during the distribution of student tickets for the football game against Michigan were announced at Monday's Student Senate meet­ing. 
SUB manager Raja Singh concluded that no kickbacks were offered in return for identification cards to enter in the ticket lottery, as was al­leged in a letter which appeared in The Observer on Sept. 12. 
The letter's writer alleged that SUB members entered 
i.d.'s into the lottery with the intent of giving kickbacks to the card's holder should the student win tickets. 
According to Student Body President Matt Breslin, "No kickbacks were planned. Ap­proximately ten i.d. 's were en­tered without the person actu­ally coming into the office. None of the tickets won. It was an unfortunate incident, but it was not as serious as the inci­dent two years ago." 
Singh and Breslin believe the SUB member in question en­tered i.d. cards in the lottery without the card's holder com­ing to the SUB office but did not plan or deliver any reward for this and was unaware that such activity was not allowed. 
Due to the long hours offered for students to enter the lottery and the long lines, a number of students worked the lottery who were unfamiliar with the

ticket distribution policy. 
SUB concluded that the inci­dent resulted from the ticket policy being unclear. 
A new policy, which should be completed by the time tickets for the Purdue game go on sale next week, tentatively will allow each student to present only his own i.d. and one other. 
Also, only a limited number of SUB members wlll nave access to the list of students who have entered the lottery and fewer hours will be offered so only students familiar with ticket distribution will staff the pro­cedure. 
Singh also said that the hotel portion of the roadtrip package had to be cancelled due to a miscommunication with the ho­tel. Those tickets were sold on a first-come, first-served basis and the students who pur­chased the package were pro­vided with a game ticket and bus trip to Ann Arbor. 
Victor DeFrancis of Om­budsman (OBUD) announced the candidates for the District 1 Student Senate election to be held today from 11 a.m. to 1

The service would consist of students who ,request an escort to be accompanied to their destinations on campus from dusk until midnight or 1 a.m. 
Breslin spoke to Assistant Di­rector of Security Phil Johnson, who supports such a plan and said Security would cooperate with the service.

We are fallllly 
Notre Dame has proclaimed academic year 1989-90 to be the YEAR OF THE FAMILY. What family? Yours? Sly's? Ward and )une and Wally and the Beaver, or Eddie's family (did he really have one?)? 
The stated purpose of the Year of the Family is to focus and reflect on the family from a number of perspectives, including communica­tion, celebration, deliberation, education and action. 
One of the most quickly developing new areas of growth in the mental health field is the area of family systems, with particular emphasis on dysfunctional and shame-based family systems. 
Our first view of life and our frame of refer­ence for the world comes through what's being called our family system. Sometimes that view is quite healthy. It suggests that each person in the family, while an important member, is also a full individual in his or her own right. While each member has responsibilities to the family unit, each member also has rights and an iden­tity that set him or her apart from the family unit. 
In the fully functional family, members sup­port each others' rights and identity without smothering. Each member is committed (or learns to become committed, to the degree age and personal development allow), to the well being of each other member's growth to full, individual potential. 
In the healthy, functional family there is a balance between autonomy and dependence. Self-esteem is attained and social and sexual training is well begun. Individuals are allowed and encouraged to develop what the field calls "clearly marked ego boundaries." That means members have the right to appropriately say "no" as well as "yes" without being shamed, to appropriately say "I won't " or "I want" without guilt, punishment or abuse. 
But chances are, the experts say, the fully functional family doesn't exist. Maybe not any­where. Maybe it never did. Maybe it never will. The suggestion is that all families have some battered Leeward Islands to keep a close watch on the new storm. They said Iris, with 50 mph winds, was about 300 miles east of the Leeward Is­lands Monday night and was moving north-northwest at about 18 mph. 

The Hurricane Center said swirling weather patterns left by Hugo made further strengthening unlikely for Iris through Tuesday evening.

level of dysfunction, if compared to the pro­
posed norms of functionality and health. 
So what are we celebrating this year? A fig­ment? A non-entity? An impossibility? Just as we celebrate mythical national championships, so we celebrate the mythical family? 
Let's accept the suggestion that the fully func­tioning family is conceptual theory and does not exist in practice. Rather, what seem to exist are families in varying degrees of health. For the moment, let's accept that. 
Then for us the year of the family can be a time to deliberate on where our own families are on the functional scale and how that place­ment has affected us and our outlook on life. 
It can be a time to educate ourselves on the role family plays in our development and out­look, and make some personal decisions about how we want those developments and outlooks to continue or change. 
During the year of the family it might be of value to read some books that particularly ad­dress these issues, both so we can begin a pro· gram of recovery from dysfunctionality if such is called for and so we can begin to plan for how we will raise our own families, should we have them. Such a book list might include Fac­ing Shame: Families in Recovery by Merle Fos­sum and Marily Mason and Bradshaw on: the Family, A revolutionary way of self-discovery by John Bradshaw (Bradshaw's famed PBS series is also on videotape, and can be arranged for viewing through the Office of Campus Ministry). 
It might be of value to discuss some of these issues with a trusted advisor or spiritual direc­tor. Or join one of the groups offen~d at the Counseling Center. They have conf}dential sup­port groups for persons whose lives have been affected by the drinking or oth~ behaviors or pathologies of family members. 
Finally, we might get to a point during the year where honest appreciation and love can be communicated to our family in some new, meaningful ways and we can celebrate with Sly and his family that WE ARE FAMILY! Dysfunc­tional, perhaps. Imperfect, certainly! Broken, maybe. But, still, we celebrate that we are and we want to be family.

SUB clarifies football ticket controversy
/Jear Hditor: 
Thn Studnnt Union Board hasns its daily dndsions on a singln rritnrion: what will bnst suit tlw nPPds and wants of thn Notrn DamP studnnt body. In tlw rasn of thP Michigan tirkct lottl~ry, t~otHiut·tpd last wnnk by our organization, wn bnlinvnd that wn wnrP fulfilling this cri­tPrion. Tlw lottPry was sprPad owr fiw days to insurP that all studPnts wmild lw abln to entnr: ticknt numbPrs wPrn n~conlPd. and studPnt Ill's WPrP rnquin~d. and f'inally, if rhosnn, thn stu­dnnt would lw n~quirnd to pick up thn tirknts in pnrson with tlwir II> and tirkPt stub. In light of thn controls listPd abov1~. wn wnrn shorkPd to lwar of the wrong doing that was outlined in Mr . .Josnph Mnynr's IPtter on Snpt. 12. 11JHIJ. 
Action was taken immediatt~ly by the SUB l·:xecutive Council and Student Body President Matt Breslin to investigate the matter. and the individual within SUB was located. In contrast to Mr. Meyer's account, the action was the result of an individual rather than the entire organization, and the extent of the matter was much less severe than previously described. The result was that ten students were signed up for the lottery by an SUB member without coming to our offices in person. Of particular note, no football tickets were to be given to the SUB member if the lottery tickets were winners, thus confirming that no kick-backs were involved. Also, none of the tickets registered in this manner won the lottery. SUB does not, however, wish to jus­tify the actions of the individual by lessening the incident. In 
DOONESBURY 
rntrospnct, our system did al­
low a loophole that we did not 
foresee, and we sineerPiy apol­
ogize for any inequity it may 
have caused. 
In nwiewing our procedure 
for the lottery, we identified the 
primary problem as being a 
much greater dPmand than ex­
pected. At tlw onset of tlw dis­
tribution, our intent was to have a full-time staff person handle the pror~edurn every day. In liPu of the huge dPmand, we began to use SUB members for the distribution which resulted in more members having access to thn listings than prnviously plamwd and those members not being fully aware of our poli­eies. Wn believe that, although thn action was wrong, there was not intent on bnhalf of the individual to corrupt the sys­tem. We have also taken this opportunity to correct the loophole so that such an inci­dent will not occur again. 
In response to an additional error in the lottery, only 72 ticket numbers were published as winners when 75 sets were available. The additional three sets were sold to the alternates that were drawn and published on the same day as the original winners. 
If you have any further ques­tions regarding the details of the lottery or any other Student Union Board matter, please feel free to contact me at the SUB office, 2nd Floor LaFortune. Again, we apologize for our mistake and hope that, in the future, you will continue to trust the integrity of our orga­nization.

Dear h'ditor: 
The opening of thP 19H9-11J90 school year represents the start of a whole new tradition at Notre Dame ... recyding. Thanks to the efforts of dedicated stu­dents and the support of the University administration, col­lection bins for aluminum cans have been placed in all dormi­tories and most classroom buildings on campus. Only the start of a program which will eventually collect newspapers, glass, cardboard, computer paper, and plastics, this pro­gram relies on your continued cooperation for its success. 
The containers for cans are on all floors of most campus buildings. Please place only empty aluminum cans in these bins. A student representative will soon be available in every dorm to answer questions, promote your dorm's participa­tion, and coordinate all volun­teers. But you don't have to volunteer to help us out. All we ask is that you walk a few extra steps to the nearest collection bin, help maintain the cardboard containers, and be considerate of the efforts of 
your fnllow studr~nts. 
The nntirP Notre DamP com­munity can take pride in this program for it signil'ins a strong commitment to promot­ing rnsouren conservation and social responsibility. As politi­cians and world leaders come to grips with looming environ­mental problems, such as global warming (the green­house effect), ozone dnpletion (CFC'sJ. chemical dumping, and our national problem of landfill shortages, we as concerned in­dividuals can 'do our part'. For instance, recycled aluminum takes 95 percent less energy to produce, and whole forests can be saved through recycling pa­per products. In 1986 enough energy was saved through recy­cling aluminum to light Pitts­
burgh for six months, yet enough aluminum is thrown away in one year to replace an entire commercial airline fleet. By recycling our waste we can rPducl' tlw Pmissions of gn·Pn­housn gas1~s. thus bProming part of thP solution to a prob­lnm that thrPatnns to wrPak havor with rlimatns, growing 
an~as,  eronomies,  and  third  
world dnvdopnwnt.  
Hernember this is  our  rocy­ 

cling program. ono that is establishing an important tra­dition with implications far be­yond our campus. Your ro­sponse so far has bnen fantas­tic and wn are optimistic about the future of the "Hecyclin' lrish"--our campus wide reey­cling program. In the weeks to come we will keop you posted on where to bring other recy­clables for collection as we progress. Till then, be happy and join the "Heeyclin' Irish."

"Tiw students were under great pressure...All students from 18 and up were eligible for the draft unless they were in the sciences, particularly physics. If the students were in good standing, they could get a de­ferment." 
Fitzgerald, like Cahill. also saw his share of the war. Each approached Navy Captain Burnett, who was in charge of the cadets on campus, and through him, they each went to Harvard for a six month pro­

Fitzgerald traveled all over the world. from Pearl Harbor to France, Italy, and even North Africa. Cahill was stationed for most of the war in the Southwest Pacific. "Later," he said, "friends would ask, 'Where were you in the war?' 'The New Hebrides Islands,' I'd tell them, and they'd give me a vague, 'Oh, of course.' I told 'em, 'Hell. you don't know where the old ones are."' 
Cahill and Fitzgerald saw rel­atively little combat, but they made large contributions be­hind the scenes. Part of Fitzgerald's team, for example, Chief of the Mediterranean forces, Field Marshall Alexander. Shortly after the fighting ended in Europe, Fitzgerald was invited to Alexander's villa on the Bay of Naples. "He came over and talked to me and started to tell me about the Potsdam Meeting ... this was before the peace treaty,'' he said. "The British knew that we had the bomb but the Russians didn't know it yet-so we thought. Alexander said the Russians did know and would be entering quickly against Japan." 
It was a devastating change to be faced with the reality of war after living on Notre Dame's sheltered campus. "I impact was felt on Notre Dame's campus. According to Fitzgerald, half of the student population consisted of return­ing veterans. For Fitzgerald, the war meant, even though he received a fellowship to study in Europe in 1939, that he didn't get there until 194 7. 

People everywhere put their lives on hold for the war, and the lucky ones kept their lives. Cahill, for one, lived to battle with those who might arguably be even more formidable than the Germans or the Japanese: Notre Dame Alumni who de­mand to see Michigan State.

Bold additions to art collection 
MICHAEL BAECHLER accent writer 
The Snite Museum of Art 
added a new sculpture to its 
permanent collection this week­
end as part of the opening of 
two new exhibitions,"David 
Hayes: Sculptures, Maquettes 
and Gouaches," and"Three 
Universities Collect: 20th 
Century Works on Paper." 
The Hayes exhibit was high­lighted Sunday by the unveiling of "Griffon," the 30-foot per­manent sculpture on the southwest lawn of the Suite Museum. 
Hayes, a 1953 Notre Dame alumnus, said, "In the last 20 years there's been a resurgence of art in public places. When art is a viable part of the cul­ture, not just confined to mu­seum interiors, anyone and ev­eryone sees that piece of sculp­ture. A little bit rubs off on you. That is the culture and aesthetic of art--it's unavoid­able." 
Other works by Hayes, includ­ing other sculptures and studies on paper, will also be dis­played. The show runs through Dec. 31. Both the Hayes exhibit and the 20th Century Art ex­hibit are free and open to the public. 
Besides learning a little bit more about the enormous sculpture in front of the mu­
seum, a visit to the galleries 

will offer a viewer the chance t 
see the works of a variety of 
well-known 20th century 
artists. 

The 20th Century show is a cooperative exhibit featuring works from Indiana University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Notre Dame. Approximately 120 works will be shown representing many of the styles of 20th century art. 
Works by Picasso, Warhol, Matisse, Kandinsky, Stella, 

Pollock and Jasper Johns are just a sample of those on dis­play. A variety of styles, from etchings to watercolor to pape construction can be seen. The show will run through Nov. 12. 
Two related lectures are scheduled at the Snite Museum: "Selected 20th Century Art and Artists: Themes and Variations" by Harold Zisla on Oct. 5 at 4:15 p.m. in the Annenberg Auditorium and "20th Century Works on Paper: Stylistic Trends from Cubism t the Present" by Barbara Bartosik on Oct. 24 at noon in the O'Shaughnessy Gallery. Both lectures are free and ope to the public. 
The Snite Museum of Art is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m ..

fight off Bi11's to win 28-14 continued from page 11 DEMONSTRATION ON 
Associated Press 

OHCIIAHD PAHK, N.Y. Denver's big-play defense, sparked by interceptions from Wymon Henderson and Tyrone Braxton, helped the Broncos build a 21-0 lead and they held on for a 28-14 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Monday night. 
Denver. which had lost 10 of its last 11 Monday night road games and its last eight games on artificial turf. turned all those negatives around with some positive defense. Just as in tlwir opening victory over Kansas City, the Broncos forced turnovers and converted them into points. 
The defense, which ranked 22nd in the NFL last year, con­tributed two points on a first­quarter safety and set up 13 more points. Those points came on Vance Johnson's 9-yard re­ception from John Elway and 11eld goals of 46 and 24 yards by David Treadwell. 
The rookie also hit from 33 and 22 yards. 
That same defense began to wilt, though, as Buffalo went to a hurry-up offense -the same ploy Bills coach Marv Levy had criticized as unethical when Cincinnati used it last year. Jim Kelly led the Bills on drives of 77 and 66 yards against a sud­denly confused Denver defense. 
But the Broncos again came up with crucial plays after Elway was intercepted early in

CHICAGO -Luis Salazar had 
an advantage the rest of his 
teammates lacked. He had 
batted against Frank Viola 
before in the American League. 
Salazar hit an offspeed pitch for a two-run homer to cap a four-run fifth inning Monday night that wiped out a three­run deficit and started the Chicago Cubs to a wild 10-6 victory over the New York Mets. 
The victory reduced Chicago's magic number to eight. Any combination of Chicago victories or St. Louis defeats totalling eight will give the Cubs the division crown. The second­-place Cardinals trail the Cubs by five games. Montreal is fourth, seven games back. 
Cardinals 3, Expos 2 
Jose DeLeon pitched a strong game and Milt Thompson hit a two-run double for St. Louis, which won for only the fourth time in 12 games. 
The fourth-place Expos have won only three of their last 11 games. 
DeLeon, 16-11, blanked Montreal until running into control trouble in the eighth. 
Athletics 4, Indians 2 
Dave Stewart must be wondering what it's going to take to win one more game. So is Dennis Eckersley. 
For the second straight time, Eckersley blew a chance in the ninth inning for Stewart's 20th victory of the season and 1OOth of his career. And for the second straight time, Eckersley wound up with the victory when Dave Henderson got the winning hit for the Oakland Athletics. 
Henderson hit a tiebreaking single in the 1Oth inning Monday night as the A's beat the Cleveland Indians 4-2. 
Red Sox 6, Blue Jays 3 
The Boston Red Sox, unable to defeat Toronto at home since 1987, beat the first-place Blue Jays as Nick Esasky homered during a five-run third inning.

Saint Mary's tennis finishes second in own invitational 
BY CHRIS BACON 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team plaeed second overall in this weekend's Saint Mary's Invitational. 
The Belles ended the tourna­ment with a total of 37 overall points, receiving four second­place, four third-place and one fifth-place finishes. Butler University placed first overall with 51 total points. Of the seven teams that competed, Saint Mary's was the only divi­sion three team. 
" I felt that we played very well in this tournament. The teams provided good competi­tion. We are a NAIA-3 and NCAA-3 team. The rest are NCAA-1 schools and all of their girls are on scholarship. Because we did so well, it indi­cates that we can do well against other schools that don't have as strong pro­grams," said Belles Coach Charlene Szajko. 
" I think it's great to play Division-1 schools in the tour­nament. It gives us great prac­tice," said junior co-captain Sarah Mayer. 
In the singles competition, senior co-captain Jennifer Block placed second in the number-one singles category, after losing a close third set , 6-1, 2-6, 5-7, to Butler University. 
Mayer placed second in the number-two singles competi­tion after losing 2-6, 6-7 (7-9 tie breaker). 

"Jennifer played very well, taking her opponent to the third set. Sarah played consis­tent and she took her opponent to a tie-breaker" said Szajko. 
Freshman Denise McDonald placed third in the number­three singles category, beating her Xavier University opponent by default. 
Sophomore Ellen Mayer de­feated her Butler opponent in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. She took third in the number-four sin­gles category. 
Sophomore Marie Koscielski placed third in the number-five singles competition after de­feating her Valparaiso oppo­nent 8-3, in a pro-set. 
Freshman Natalie Kloepfer was defeated by her Akron op­ponent in straight sets, 2-6, 1­
6. She placed fifth in the num­ber-six competition. 
In doubles competition, Block and Mayer defeated Akron in a pro-set, 8-6. They placed third in the number-one doubles cat­egory. 
Koseielski and McDonald placed second in the number­two doubles category after los­ing in straight sets to Butler, 1­6, 3-6. 
Mayer and Kloepfer placed second in the number-three doubles category after losing to Akron in straight sets, 4-6, 1-6. 
" The girls did very well and they played up to their poten­tial. We are a very young team, but we have the talent and I think we can go far with this team," said Szajko.

Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's soccer team extended it's winning record to 5-0, after defeating Tri-State University, 8-0, and Wheaton College, 1-0, in last week's action. 
The team headed to Tri-State University on September 13 for a match that belonged solely to the Belles. Saint Mary's offense continually challenged the Tri­State goalie, getting off 21 shots, eight of which produced goals. 
"We exhibited superiority the entire game," said senior Mollie Meehan, one of seven players to score in the Belles' victory. Sophomore Kelly Fraleigh had two, freshman April Ehret, junior Trish Troester, senior Kathy Revane and sophomore Janet Libbing each had one. and Greer Gilliland had a goal 
and a assist. 
Saturday's game proved to be more of a challenge as Wheaton College came into town with a perfect record and the two undefeated teams battled for the right to stay that way. In the end, it was Saint Mary's coming out on top as freshman Kristin Crowley blasted home the winning goal

Irish soccer, Lyons shut out Marquette 1-0 
BY KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's soccer team climbed above the .500 mark with its third straight win Sunday. blanking the Marquette Warriors 1-0 in Milwaukee, Wis. 
Tom Connaghan's goal with just 2:50 left in regulation gave Irish goalkeeper Danny Lyons all of the offensive support he needed as he recorded his first shutout of the season and the 14th of his career. 
Lyons only needed to make 4 saves against the Warriors, who fell to 3-2-1 on the season. Consequently, it is not too sur­prising that he gives the defense much of the credit for keeping Marquette scoreless. 
"The defense played really tough," Lyons said. "It was probably our best defensive performance of the year. They had a couple shots but they were all wide, really. I didn't have to do a whole lot." 
Lyons, unspoiled by success, stayed late for practice yester­mark to gain a lead. Tom Senior goalies Jim Ambrosn We'v1~ had trouble thern in the day.
