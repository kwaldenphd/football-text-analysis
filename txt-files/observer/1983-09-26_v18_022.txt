One of the best kept secrets on the Notre 
Dame campus is the Student Government Information Bureau, 
otherwise known as Ombudsman. Says director Andy Tucker, "We 
have all the information on file that could pertain to an N.D. stu· 
dent." Ombudsman can he contacted at 239-0BUD for information 
concerning movie times, bus schedules, ticket information, and any 
other activities happening on campus. In the past, Ombudsman has 
been located on the second floor of Lafortune, but it is now in the 
process of transferring its headquarters to the first floor, next to the 
Student Activities Office. Although the move was delayed when a 
newly-ordered information booth had to he returned because of

Notre Dame students are often accused of being is­olated from the world's realities and existing in a sort of mecca oftheir own. 
Consider South Bend's location; the Midwest long has had the reputation of being behind the rest of the country. There aren't any fast lanes in South Bend; things seem to happen here long after they have hap· pened in the rest of the country. More than one new­corner has found the conservative way oflife hard to adjust to. 
Notre Dame students are, by choice, even more "protected" from the outside. We live in dorms with regulated hours of visitation by the opposite sex, DETEXes to make sure unwanted people don't invade our privacy, maids to ' clean our rooms and empty our trash. One can hardly call this common or typical. 
There is nothing wrong with this. I don't mind the extra protection, but I do believe that all this security can make us a bit insensitive to the realities of the world. 
Violence is one thing most of have been spared fro~ in our lives. Most of us arc lucky enough to be able to live in neighborhoods where violent crimes are infre· 
quent. None of us, however, experience the day-to-day violence the citizens of many nations experience, and because of this, comprehending the violence which does occur in these nations is difficult. <n lliw.thr .. 
Time and distance are reasons it is difficult for Americans to feel the full impact of violence in the world. The last war fought on American soil was the Civil War which ended more than 118 years ago. More 
recent wars involving the United States-World Wars I and II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War-were all fought outside of the United States. The fighting that is happening in countries like Lebanon and Chile is too far 
away for us to feel its impact; Lebanon is on the other side of the world but it may as well be another galaxy. Not one of us has been alive to see a war fought in our own country. Think about this.

It's been almost a decade since the Vietnam War ended. Hardly a long time, but it's rather surprising how the horrible memories have been wiped out of the minds ofso many Americans. Most ofus were too young to feel the impact of the violence in Vietnam; we only remember the grim newscasts and the magazine covers with pictures ofdead or wounded children. 
Volatile situations throughout the world have precipitated U.S. intervention and there is a real fear that one ofthese disturbances could eventually drag the 
U.S. into another war. We can't pick up a newspaper these days without reading something about U.S. in­volvement in another country. Several Marines have been killed and more have been wounded in 
~:q. Beirut. And what is going on :::;..---in Chad? 
Central America has been a growing hot spot in the last five years and has appeared 
~ ready to explode like a pow­·;P) der keg many times. . ' W The American soldiers 
~ who have been fighting a strong battle against Sal­vadoran guerillas have not forgotten Vietnam. Geographically, El Salvador 
is much different than Vietnam, hut the lessons learned in the rice paddies ofNam apply here. "We're going to do it right this time," said a senior 
U.S. military leader in El Salvador. 

The thought that someone so high up is drawing an analogy like that scares the hell out ofme. Yet, President Reagan has repeatedly denied that there is a similarity between the two countries. 
What does this all mean and how do we fit in? There is nothing we can do individually, but the story shouldn't end here. But that doesn't mean we have nothing to think about, because we do. We can't take for granted the peace that we enjoy, peace that has been denied to others. 
Notre Dame students have always shown great awareness for social concern issues; we aren't always so sure about details, but we do have a sense of justice in the world that many people lack. Let us not become so secure within our little paradises that we forget what is happening outside ofthe gates.

George McGovern answers the call for the presidency? 
Finallv the Democrats have a true liberal­Left l'a~didate for the presidency. George Mc<;ovcrn, answering the call of an invisible constituency, has for the third time declared hh readiness to accept the supreme power in America. Now we can all breathe more easily, knowing God's in his Hc;1ven and the Republic is safe. 
Max Lerntr 
The Max Lerner Column 

Con~ider the goodies the ex-senator and (in 19'2) ex-Democratic presidential nominee offers us. As president he would increa:-;e federal social spending and hence taxes. too, cancel the MX and B-1, reverse Ronald Reagan's defense build-up, clear out of El Sal­vador, smile benignly on Nicaragua, envelop Fidel Castro in a diplomatic embrace, and make a "significant cut" in aid to Israel ifit fails to meet his requirements for "negotiation in good faith" with its Arab enemies. 
Another goodie is .a turnabout in policies toward the Soviet Union and its global expan­sionism. Judging from his postttons, McGovern would be an easy mark for the Soviets in the Geneva arms talks. He would no longer interfere in the revolutionary currents ofsmaller nations, which is an interesting way of phrasing an isolationist inaction toward Soviet global designs. There isn't an unhack­neyed idea nor a workable one in the whole melange. 
As for the Korean plane shootdown, "it only under-scores the folly ofthe present cold war tensions." How this is distinguished from the present Soviet position toward their mur­derous act and toward the American protests he doesn't say. 
Perhaps I take George McGovern's 
pronouncements more seriously than they 
deserve. Shift 55 years hack to 1948, shift from 
South Dakota to Iowa, from George 
Mc<;overn to Henry Wallace, from Nicaragua 
and El Salvador to Yugoslavia ;md Eastern 
Europe, and you get one of tho~c ~tartling 
parallels that makes the course of history 
seem to run in circles. 
I recall attending the 1948 convention of 
Wallace's Progressive Party with H.L. 
Mencken. We listened to the Resolutions 
Committee report and to Wallace's responses 
to questions about the Soviets. Mencken was 
delighted with the entire performance · its 
ultra-liberal civic virtue, jts political in­
nocence and extravagance together, it~ ig­
norance of the realities of political Iite. I think 
of poor, sincere, deluded Henry Wallace 
when I try to make some sen~e of George 
McGovern. 
L:nlike Wallace, who thought he could win, 
McGovern agrees that he is a "long-shot" can­
didate. But I read his confident declaration ­
"I am ready now as at no previous time in my 
life to lead this nation toward justice, honor 
and peace" -and I think of Harold Stassen's 
unexpungeahle belief in the nation's need of 
his leadership, and I can't help asking what has 
happened to the "observing ego" that keeps 
most men who at some point have had a brush 
with the White House from making infernal 
fools ofthemselves. 
Now there are seven presidential can­
didates. We may be grateful that McGovern, as 
the seventh, has offered a guideline ofsorts for 
judging the positions of the other six, on 
spending and taxes, on defense, on Israel and 
the Arabs, on Castro, on the Russians. 
McGovern has gone well beyond Walter 
Mondalc, Alan Cranston and Gary Hart. He has 
blurted out the political credo that the liberal 
Left of the Dcmcratic Party believes. It isn't 
credible. It is a Never-Never Land of political 
fantasy. But it is there, and the pathos of 
McGovern's unending quest for the prize that 
has eluded him shouldn't blind us to that fact.

P.O. Box Q 
Japan program 
Dear Editor: 

As a member ofthe Asian Committee, I have always supported the introduction ofChinese studies at the University -it would be a definite plus for ourJapanese majors program. So I recommend by all means the general point that Francis James made in his recent column (Why Notre Dame should offer Chinese, Sept. 22). 
But I greatly regret his characterization of theJapan program: "For years it was languish­ing with very few students, but suddenly blossomed into a full scale language program ..." For your guest columnist's in­formation, the program started with 1.3 stu­dents who went to Tokyo in 1967. The next year the number soared to 24 and since then it has numbered between 8 and 15. In 1968, Japanese classes were begun with 16 students in First Year Japanese. Since that time, it has developed into a four year program. When a second teacher was brought into theJapanese section in 1975, we were able to develop majors program. 
Many students with no intention of par­ticipating in the Year-in-japan Program have enrolled in these classes -and this. long before Toyotas and Datsuns began to invade the land. Five of our ~tudents have won the Ministry of Education Scholarship Award to study at Japanese Universities. Furthermore, aside from the three major languages in our department,Japanese has had the largest num­ber of majors. The thrust of our classes is to teach the language, literature, and culture of Japan -we make no attempt to touch upon things like Theory Z. TheJapan Club has been 
functioning since 1976 not only with mem­bers of the Japanese classes, hut also with other students from Japan or interested in Japan. It has always had many members. All this would hardly give any hint of "languishing." 
I know Mr. James did not intend to slur our progr;tm, but as part of the it, I feel compelled to reply on hehalfofits teachers and students. 
Actually, all this has been a blessing in dis­guise: It has given us the splendid opportunity to inform your readers about our program. llnhelievablv, frcshmt·n still come to us at the end of the ~emester totally unaware of the 
program.

Campus comments If you were an RA, would you report an overnight stay? 

Yes, I would turn someone in. If I decided to take the responsibilities of being an RA I would go through with the commitment. Rules would never be followed if they were not enforced. 
Karen Hagnell 
Biology 
Class of '87 
No, I wouldn't. Although I under­stand the need to have restrictions, I would just give a warning. The penalties are too severe. 
Hubie McGinley Program of Liberal Studies Class of '85 
Yes. You have an obligation to turn them in. But I don't want that kind of responsibility. 
Kelly Fitzpatrick Nursing Class of'84 

It depends on how much money they would be willing to offer me. 
Linda Douglas

Class of '85 
I would have to say no. Even though rules arc very important, I think every person deserves a second chance. If I caught someone twice, I'd seriously consider turning them in.

The embattled defenders of the America's Cup decided yesterday to make no further changes on the already lightened Liberty for today's deciding race against speedier Australia 
II. The Australians, pleased there would be no alterations in the U.S. yacht's weight and sail configuration beyond those made Friday, said they would reconsider their vow to protest the final race from the start. WarrenJones, executive director of the Aussie syndicate, said that decision would be made this morning. But just as the winds of controversy appeared to the dying, so did the V'rinds on Rhode Island, Sound, raising the possibility that the closest series in Cup history will not be finished until Tuesday or later. Johan Valentijn, Liberty's designer, said the Americans decided to forgo more ballast changes after receiving the latest weather report, calling for eight-knot sout­heasterly winds for today's scheduled 12:10 p.m. EDT start. And Jones added, "We'll be lucky to get a race." The forecast was for winds to shift to the south-southwe~t and build to 10-12 knots by 3 
p.m. but then die to 5-7 knots by 5 p.m. "We're quite concerned about the winds being real shifty and light and not being able to get a race in," said Mike Neilsen, meteorogolist with the Newport Weather Center, a private forecasting service used by both Liberty and Australia II. "If they start at 2, we may never see a finish." And "not much difference" is expected tomorrow, he said. -AP 
Orioles clinch ALEast 
MILWAUKEE (AP) -The Bal· timore Orioles, behind the combined six-hit pitching of Storm Davis and Tippy Martinez and home runs by Jim Dwyer and Joe Nolan, clinched the American League East title yesterday with a 5-l victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
The Orioles began the day needing either one victory or a loss by second-place Detroit to clinch the division. Detroit beat Boston 3-2 yesterday. 
Baltimore, which last won the division in 1979, will face the AL West champion Chicago White Sox for the league championship. The best-of-five series starts Oct. 5 in Bal­timore. Chicago is making its first­ever appearance in the AL championship series. 
Davis, 13-6, gave up one run on 
three hits over six innings before 
being relieved by Martinez, who 
earned his 19th save.

Pro football roundup 

Cowboys nip Saints on safety 
Associated Press 
Linebacker Anthony Dickerson sackl·d New Orleans quarterback Kenny Stahler for a safety with I:'5H remaining in the game ye~tcrday to give the unbeaten Dalla~ Cowhoys a bizarre 21-20 National Football l.c;tgue victory. 
Outpl.tyl'll the entire: game, Oat­las. -1-0, appe1rcd to have lost the garnc when New (>rlean~ linebacker D~·nnis Winswn intercepted a Dan­ny Whitl· pass in the end zone and ran it out to the -\-yard lint·. Hut the Saints. trying to cltch the D;~lla.~ secondary n;tpping, decided to throw thc hall. 
Dickerson, who wasn't timlcll hy Stahler'~ play-acion fake, hlitzcd and c;m~ht .'itahkr in the end zone for thl' winning two poinb. 
Hookic H<tul Allegre ki<:ked a .B­yard field goal after .J:<; I ofovertime to hoosl the Hahimore Colts to a 22­19 victory over the Chicago lkars. Alle~-:re had missed a 4"i-yard Held go:tl attempt with three second~ remaining in regulation. The Bears lost a chance to win in regulation 
conIin ued from page 12 
"We kept him in there because hl"s hcen a starter for us," Faust ex­plained. "lie's a senior and a captain and he was moving the hall." 
After the: second interception, it 
was hack to Beuerlt:in, and hegin­
ning to seem like a plague ofquarter­
back yo-yos. 
"I think it was the logical thing to do," Kiel said. "Steve did a great joh and deserved to he in there." 
A Vl'ry frustrated Kiel took per­
sonal responsibility for the loss. 
"I had two interceptions," he said. 
"Everytime I had a turnover, they 
scored." 
Enough ~loating on the ohvious mistake.~. Notre Dame aho had chances to score and never reaped the henetlts of those opportunities. 
On lkucrlein's tlrsl serit~s in the second quarter, he skillfully maneuvered the team into Miami territory. Smith and Allen Pinkett, terrorizing the right side of Miami's defensive line, tallied IH and 21 yard.~ ru.~hin~ on the drive. The team was unable to penetrate the ~oal line, however, and Faust wc:nt to 
Mike Johnston to attempt a 27-yard 
fleld goal. Out of nowhere, an un­
touched Re~ie Sutton sprung for­
ward blocking the kick. 
Beuerlein's next series had similar results. He marched Notre Dame from his own 33-yard line to Miami's 
23. Once again Johnston got the call. After a faked kick was called back due to a delay of game penalty, 
Johnston was short with his 46-yard attempt. 
In the third quarter, Kiel, who ended up 9 for 21 passing with 88 yards, also experienced the feeling. After the rushing talents of Pinkett and a \6-yard reception hy Milt Jack­son brought the: Irish down to Miami's seven-yard line, the Hur­ricanes held tight. Johnston's 24­yard attemt was once again blocked hy a blazing Sutton. 
"Re~ie's heen blocking them against us all week in practice," Hur­ricane Head Coach Howard Schnel­lenherger said. "He's a quick kid. If you don't get the hall off quick, you're in trouble." 
Finally, the Irish spent the last six 
minutes of the game under Beuer­
lein's direction marching down field 
only to have the quarterback sacked 
at the three-yard line. Its hopes of 
scoring thwarted, Notre Dame suf­when Boll Thomas was wide with his extra point attempt following Chicago's t1rst touchdown of the game. 
Veteran quartcrhack Jim Hart connected with Roy Green on a 26­yard touchdown pass with 29 seconds remaining as the St. Louis Cardinals won their first game of the season. 14-11 over Philaddphia. 
Joe Crihb.~ rushed for 166 yards, bettering his previous single-game hest, to lead Buffalo over Houston ~0-1 ~-Earl Campt>ell had 142 yards in 50 carries for the Oilers. 
Quarterback Steve Grogan and rookie Stephan Starring hooked up on a 76-yard pass play with .~:S9 remaining and the defense picked off three Pitt~burgh passt:s as New England rallied to upset the Steelers 2H-2~. Pittsburgh's Franco Harris 
gaint·d 106 yards on 2S carries, giving him a career total of I 1 ..~09 yard~. second only toJim Brown. He surpassed 0.). Simpson's career yardage total in the loss. 
The San Francisco 49ers ended a six-game home losing streak by heating Atlanta 24-20 as Joe Mon­
fered its first shutout since a ~-0 loss to Missouri in 1978. 
Beuerlein ended the game with 
I~ completions in 2~ attempts and 
14S total passing yards. 
Examining the stats, the game looked pretty even -mayhe even leanin~ toward Notre Dame. The Irish had 22 first downs, picked up 33S total offensive yards, and con­trolled the hall for 29 minutes. Miami had only 19 first downs, 296 offensive yards, while controlling the hall for 31 minutes. The decisive numhers arc Notre Dame's four tur­novers to Miami's two, and Notre Dame's lack ofpoints to Miami's 20. 
Why couldn't the Irish find the secret to crossing the goal line? 
"I honestlfiion't kno$,1111 ~iel said. ''We didn't have the drive we needed to get in there." 
Faust preferred to focus on the Miami ddense and the performance of Kosar rather than the lack of Irish killer instinct.

Joe Theismann's three touch­

Seattle, 27-17, while Miami, behind 
David Woodley's TO pass to rookie 
tight end Dan Johnson, survived a 
mistake-marred first half to edge 
Kansas City 14-6. 

Ken Riley sprinted :H yards with 
an interception for a touchdown and 
Hohcrt jackson ended a threat with 
another mterception as Cincinnati 
won its fir~t game of the season hy 
stopping winle~s Tampa B;ty 2.~-17. 
Benny Hicardo kicked his second tkld goal of the game midw:1y through the final period and Min­nesota held on to nip Detroit 20-17. 
Two touchdown passes from Jim Plunkett to Cliff Branch helped Los Angeles raise its record to 4-0 as the Raiders downed Denver 22· 7, while quarterback Brian Sipe hit tight end Harry Holt with a 48-yard touch­down just 1:S.~ into overtime to lift Cleveland over San Diego 30-24. 
Pat Leahy's 26-yard field goal 8:22 into overtime boosted the New York Jets to a 27-24 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. 
   Miami 
"Miami is a good football team," he said. "You've got to give their defense credit for not letting us get into the endzone. And Kosar ( 22 for 33 and 21 S yards) played just a heck ofa game." 
Ofcourse new questions will arise from this Miami trouncing, some of which Faust can try to answer. 
For instance, will Beuerlein start 
next week in Colorado? 

"No, I don't think so," Faust said. "Steve did an excellent job for a freshman. He really hung in there. But, he hasn't had time to get to know the system yet." 
Is Notre Dame really the team that was dominated by Michigan Sate and now Miami? 
"You can call me an eternal op­timist but we're still in real good shape," Faust said. "Our goal this season was to improve over last year. We can still do that." 
Are all the questions answered? Time will tell.

the post. No matter. Shmid boomed one home minutes later and the rout was official. The weekend was not a complete loss, however. Tom Daley, Snyder, Harkenrider, and Bill Beasley scored a goal apiece as the Irish dumped Kentucky 4-0 on Friday night. Harkenrider's goal enabled him to break Kevin Lovejoy's record of scoring in six consecutive games. The goal came on a penalty kick and gave the Irish a 2-0 lead at the time. Thus, with a win on Friday and a loss yesterday, Notre Dame's record drops to 7-2 on the season.

Miami thrashes Irish in front of nation 
ByJANE HEALEY 
AssistantSports Editor 
MIAMI -All week on Notre Dame's campus people were asking the question, "Which L~ the real Irish football team?" Unfortunately, a 20­0 thrashing by Miami Saturday night seemed an appropriate answer to the inquiry. 
"We were ready for the game," a subdued Gerry Faust said afterward. "We just made errors and you can't do that." 
The errors to which Faust is refer­ring were both the tangible, recog­nizable ones -turnovers -and the intangible, mental ones -the in­ability of the Irish to muster any scoring momentum once they travelled into Hurricane territory. 
Miami's first half 14-0 lead was the product of those tangible mistakes. With 3:10 left in the first quarter, and no score on the board, Notre Dame had the ball on their own 19­yard line facing first down and 20. Irish quarterback Blair Kiel rolled right with plenty of time to throw. When he got the pass off though, it ended up in the crook of defender Jay Brophy's arm. 
The interception gave Miami pos­session on the Notre Dame 30-yard line. Eight plays later, Speedy Neal busted three yards up the middle for the first score of the game. JeffDavis added the extra point. 
In the second quarter, with t.he Irish once again deep in their own territory, Kiel and company faced third down and 10 yards to go. A missnap muffed Kiel's hand-off to fullback Chris Smith, and Miami's Winston Moss recovered the fumble on the 26-yard line. 
Red-shirted freshman quarter­back Bernie Kosar then expertly picked out receiver Stanley Shakespeare and tailback Keith Grif­
fin for receptions of six and five yards, respectively. The Irish defense held tight though, forcing a third down and seven situation. The blitzing Irish sent everyone except conerback Stacey Toran and Pat Ballage after Kosar. Reading the blitz, Kosar called an audible and a quick-release pass led wide receiver Ed Brown into the comer of the endzone with Ballage trailing be­hind. 
"The interceptions -the tur­novers -really hurt," Faust said. "It gave them good field position each time. That's what you can't do." 
The Irish did do it again, though. Miami added a field goal on the first drive ofthe third quarter making the score 17-0. In the fourth quarter, the Irish began a drive on their own one yard line. Kiel's completions to Mark Bavaro and Alonzo Jefferson brought them up to the 39-yard line. 
On second down and 10, Kiel dropped back again with a lot of time, and spotted Bavaro across the middle. Unfortunately, Miami's Ken Sisk also spotted the open Irish tight end, and before the ball got to him, Sisk grabbed it, returning the ball to the 38-yard line. 
Kiel's second interception resulted in another Davis field goal, thus accounting for the 20-0 final score. 
After the fumble in the second quarter, Faust had sent in freshman Steve Beuerlein in to replace Kiel. 
"We wanted to try and get some­thing started," Faust said. "We had planned to use more players and substitute anyway due to the humidity." 
At the beginning ofthe third quar­ter, though, Kiel reappeared at the helm ofthe offense for reasons ofex­perience. 
see MIAMI, page 8 

The thoughts of a disheartened fan 
It's sad to say, but it appears that the real Irish football team stood up -or, rather, laid down -on.'iaturday. 
Now, I will admit that, while I know football pretty well, I'm not an expert. But I do know what I, as well as millions of other people, saw on television Saturday night. 
What I saw was a football team that embarrassed itself 
on national television, not only with its physical perfor­
mance, but also with the character that it showed when 
met with a serious challenge. 
I don't think I need to dwell too much on the physical mistakes. We've been seeing many ofthem for a few years now. The costly interceptions, the poor pass rush, the sight of linemen getting knocked on the seat of their pants by someone fifty pounds lighter. Probably most annoying was the lack off execution in the clutch (fumbled snaps and dumb penalties on third-and-one) and the inability to adjust (two blocked kicks by the same man coming from the same place untouched by the same blocker). 
In short, Notre Dame was outcoached, outplayed, and outmatched. We were beaten by a team that was better than we were. More importantly, we were beaten by a team that wanted it more. Ofcourse, in five ofour last six games, we've been beaten by a team that wanted it more. 
This is the thing that is most upsetting about the last few seasons. If we just weren't as talented as the teams that we've been losing to, I could understand"and accept that, but this isn't the case. We've got so much talent we don't know what to do with it (at least that's what the .ro-c ailed football experts say), but we still lose. 
Most of the losses aren't flukes, either. We are getting beaten all over the tleld. But there is ahsolutely no reason why we should be losing games to teams like Air Force and Michigan State. And there should have been no reason for us to lose our biggest game of the year on Saturday. 
The players and coaches all know that teams will be psyched up when they play us, so why aren't they prepared for this? They knew Miami was going to be ready, so we should have been ready for them. We weren't. 
Who do you blame for the team not be mentally 

Mike Sullivan 
Sports Editor 
prepared? Obviously, a lot of blame belongs to the coaches. 
All the coaches, but particularly the man in charge, are making the players think they are better than they are. I can understand that you have to give the players a boost from time to time, but reminding them after the Michigan State loss that the 1977 team also lost its second game is going a bit too far. 
The players should have been angry after the MSU loss, but they weren't. They acted like it never happened. All they talked about was how they were still going to win the national championship. 
One day, he is going to have to stop saying, "We're a good team and we're going to bounce back." We've been hearing that for three years and the team never really has bounced back. Not that it can't, just that it doesn't seem to have the desire to come back. That hunger for winning isn't there anymore. 
It's not all the coaches' fault, though. The coaches don't mess up snaps and miss blocking assignments -the players do. They are going to have to start realizing that Notre Dame doesn't win because it's Notre Dame. It has always won because ofhard work and a winning attitude. If you don't want to win, you won't. Don't tell me that Nebraska doesn't want to win more than any poor team they might play. 
Let's stop for a second. 
If it seems that I'm being too harsh on the team and the players, maybe I am. But I think I have the same reason as those people who are, for the first time, voicing their an­ger. 
I have been very patient during the last few years, al­ways waiting for us to explode. This year I thought was the year. Everything seemed to be going right. 
Now I had questioned the desire of the team for my first couple ofyears, but I figured that it would work itself out when the Faust recruits began playing major roles. 

Michigan State started to get me wondering again. 
When some ofthe players said that the Spartans wanted it 
more, I was really upset, but I decided to write it off as a 
bad day. 

The national television performance convinced me, 
though, that I may have overestimated the players and 
the coaches. Not all of them (you could tell who wanted 
to win and who didn't just by watching the game), but 
enough ofthem to let Miami walk all over us. 
The thing that I will probably never forget about Satur­day is the sight ofthe classless Miami players taunting the Notre Dame players -and the Notre Dame players not being able to do anything about it. I know it was frustrat­ing for me to watch it, but I sure hope it was more frustrating to the players. Here was Notre Dame, for years the big kid on the block, now playing the part ofthe little weakling who can't stand up to the bully. 
I feel somehow betrayed even though I really have no right to. But, I'm sorry, I have been through this ever since I got here. 
I don't have anything against the players or the coaches, although I don't think we arc as talented as people say we are. I hope that I'm wrong about the players' attitudes. So far, there is really nothing to make me feel otherwise, though. 
I'm not the only one that feels this way toward the team, though. I said last week that the students had been pushed to the edge. The performance against Miami pushed 95 percent of them over the edge -before the third quarter ended. 
A couple of the team leaders may have said that the players were playing for themselves, but I don't think they thought that there words might come true. 
The last eight games will show us ifthe players have got anything deep inside that hasn't come out yet. Beating Colorado won't prove anything. Beating USC won't prove anything. Only the results at the end of the season will mean anything. 
Maybe, ifthe players see where this season has headed, they will show everyone the thing that they have failed to show so many times over the last few years -the desire to win.
