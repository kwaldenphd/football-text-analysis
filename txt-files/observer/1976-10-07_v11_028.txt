Vaccinations will be given 
by Kathleen Horgan Staff Reporter 
Dates for swine flu vaccination 
shots to be given at St. Mary's and 
Notre Dame will probably be 
announced early next week. The 
colds that seem to be going around 
SMC-ND campuses are said to hav­
e no relation to the swine flu. 
Officials hope to have the innocu­Iation program completed by mid­November, well before the onset of the flu season. Officials also stated that they anticipate problems with persons suffering side effects from the shots. 
In an article in the South Bend Tribune Dr. William McCraley of the county Health Department said he is particularly worried about the 18-25 age group and the persons allergic to eggs. Most of the reactions to the shots in a prelimi­nary test run were in the 18-25 age group, he explained. Also, the 200 unit vaccine dose sometimes is not sufficient for the younger age group. 
Epidemic may never materialize 
Dr. McCraley admitted that a swine flu epidemic may never materialize but he indicated that he favored the program anyway. He said the illness could be wide­spread overnight. People have no natural protection from this partie· ular strain.

Those hard-hat warnings and that oile of mud bv the south side of the Radiation Research Building are there for a reason. A $100,000 underground vault ts being con­:>tructed to house a second Van de Graff generator. 
The 3 million volt Van de ~~aff generator is part of the one mtlhon dollars worth of equiment that the 
U.S. Energy and Development Administration (ERDA), which runs the lab, is transferring to Notre Dame from Carnegie-Mellon University at Pittsburgh. 
"It will provide for a better exchange of id~as," said Dr. Neta

The facultv and advanced law students of the Kresge Law School of Notre Dame have organized a pilot program to expose South Bend high school students to "street law." 
According to program supervisor Dr. Charles Crutchfield. assistant professor of law, the purpose of the "street law" program is to "train law students to teach law in a practical sense to high school students." He added. "It's really designed to give high school stu­dents a practical course--not to make lawyers out of them--but to inform them of their rights and to titter down to the family level." 
Emphasis is areas such as crilr­inal. consumer. family. housing individual rights. and environment­al law will be offered by the program. Its goal is to develop a more positive attitude on the students' part as citizens who must deal with the law and its methods of enforcement. Additional bene­fits would be a decrease in anti­social behavior and an exposure to possible vocations within the legal profession. 
Crutchfield explained that the pilot program was originated in 

Washington, D.C., by the George­
town University Law Center. It is 
now taught in-all 15 District of Columbia schools and has been expanded to a number of adult and juvenile correctional institutions where students receive clinical credit for their work. 
The South Bend program in­volves four area schools: John Adams, Washington. St. Joseph and the Whitney M. Young, Jr. Street Academy. 
A unit approach is used bv law student teams at Adan . a11d Washington where the law subjects arc included within the structure of a previously established class. An introduction to law has been insert­ed into a Washington Career Ca~ict class. Criminal law sections have been introduced to Washington and Adam~ American Government classes. Crutchfield noted that the new subject matter "is not l'ltcndcd to substitute for any part of the course. We trv to work in those parts of the subject v. itt. the law unit as requested by the school." The unit is restricted to a total of nine teaching days under the pilot program. 
At St. Joseph and the Street Ac tdemy. the program has set up elective courses distinct from pre­exi~tin:;: ones. These electives are tau~-o ht by two and three student 
t. 'IllS 

who came with the equipment from 
the CMU lab. "ERDA decided to 
combine the two efforts and since 
Notre Dame had the larger facility, 
it made sense that we should be the 
one to move, especially_ when you remember that ERDA owns this building while at CMU the univer­sity owned the lab." 
The second Van de Graff genera­tor will allow the lab "to examine 
individual and chemical reactions
that are present for a millionth of a 
second or even less." according to 
Lab Director Robert. Schuler. He 
added that it would be "used for 
very special experiments that we 
would not have been able to do with 
our two million generator that we 
have now.''

The pilot program involves 21 second and third year law students who meet for a weekly two-hour seminar to go over the sections they will cover in their respective classes. They use a "street law" text and a teaching manual to acquaint them with knowledge of the applicable law and effective instruction techniques. 
The program has already begun at the Street Academy and St. Joseph and will start next week at Adams and Washington. "So far. the program has gotten good billing." Crutchticld stated. "It's off to a good start.'' 
The program is funded by a $25,0('() grant from the Lillv En­dowment: Inc. of lndianap~1lis. Additional financial support ·comes from the Public Welfare Founda­tion of Washington D. C. and the Cummins Engine Foundation of Columbus . Ind.

There will be an open junior class meeting today at 4:30p.m. in the LaFortune auditorium, first floor. Finances and future plans will be presented and opened for discus­sion. This will be the first of bi-weekly class meetings and will last 20-30 minutes.

the university. 
"Basically the university oper­ates the lab for the ERDA." said Schuler. 
"It's a real advantage to Notre Dame that this laboratory is located here," said Dean of Science Ber­nard Waldman. "Without these graduate programs, the only thing we would be a four year college. 
You have to be recognized.''

~lreiai1J-today-.. 
ANDREAS O'CEALLACHAIN 
Editor's Note: The present strife in Northern Ireland constitutes something of an undeclared war, one that has been dragging on for six years. One of the main catalysts of the continued bloodshed has been the Irish Repl:blicans,whose political wing, the Sinn Fein, sent Mr. Andreas O'Ceallachain to Notre Dame and other places in American to explain their cause. 
Observer: Could you explain the backgro­
und of the Sinn Fein, starting with the 
name? 
O'Ceallachain: The name Sinn Fein mean 
:·we o~r~elves." The significance of that 
IS that tt tmplies self-reliance, because we 
of Sinn Fein have always believed that the 
problems of Ireland will ultimately be 
solved by the Irish people themselves 
com!ng to grips with those problems, and 
solvmg those problems themselves rathet 
than waiting for some external Me~siah or 
relying on anybody outside Ireland namely 
the British. ' 
The Sinn Fein. and the Republican 

movement of today see ourselves in two 
says: first of all, as the latest link in the 
historic resistant to British interference in 
Irish affairs. but also Republicanism today 
tS a very revolutionary thought. It has a 
very definite ideas about what Ireland 
s~ould be like in the future. and how the 
lnsh. people should shape their own 
destmy. This is consistent with a 
democratic understanding of how the problems of Ireland should be solved resting on the will of all the Irish ' Observer: What is the role of Sinn Fein in the IRA? O'Ceallachain: Since the Sinn Fein was found~d !n 1905. it has been a political org~mzatton. After the 1916 rising and du:mg the War of Independence. the Sinn Fem embraced the IRA as the official army of the 32-county republic that had been proclaimed ?Y Pierce and Connolly and had been establtshed by the democratic will of all the Irish people. So Sinn Fein has remained the political wing of the IRA It is legal. both in the North and So~th, although many of its members are impris­oned. On the other hand. the IRA is a ~ecret ~n.d militar.y o:ganization. Sinn Fein ts a ctvtl orgamzatton, so there is no problem in talking about it. If one is a member ~f th.e IRA, he doesn't go about broadcastmg tt. Observer: You were advertised as a fugitive from the British. How did that come about? 
~'Ceallachain: The British Army has the td.ea that ~nyone prominent in the political wmg on Smn Fein is prominent in the IRA as well. That's partly the reason. Also, 1 ry to spen a lot of time in the North as

h h
brothers and ~tsters live. I'm a university 
An interview 
want to talk to somebody. 

Observer: What brings you to America? 
O'Ce~ac~ain: My main purpose in 
A.mer~can ts .to exchange ideas, just as we 
dtd thts evenmg. You know, I don't believe 
that everything 'I say in the United States is 
going to be accepted as the Gospel, and · 
that's not my objective. My objective is to 
put the conflict in Ireland into some kind of 
broader perspective. And 1 think one of the 
reaso~s people become so dispirited .and 
despatred about the conflict in Ireland is 
that ~he m~dia makes no attempt to come 
to gnps wtth the causes. You just hear 
"Five p~~ple killed in an explosion," or 
about Bnttsh officers killed in an ambush. 
~nq .e~eryb~dy s.~ys, "Isn't it shocking,.. 
Isn t tt ternble, and of course it is. My 
who!~ point is explaining to people that 
~h~kmg.your head and saying it's shocking 
tsn t gomg to cure it. What we need to do 
is examine the· causes of it. That's the 
purpos~ of my tour, not for propaganda, 
but to hsten to people and try to explain the 
causes o~ the conflict, to give them a little 
perspective. 

Observer: Since this Is largely an internal 
matter within the United Kingdom why do 
you consider is important to edu~ate the 
American public about Ireland? 

o·~~allachain: First of all, although the 
Bnttsh government claims it is an internal 
matter. the fact is, that the Labour 
Government, which is in power at the 
moment, recently held their party confere­
nee and Northern Ireland was not a subject 
of discussion. 

At t~e same time Ireland doesn't get the 
attentton as betng a major international 
issue. for a number of reasons. On the one 
hand, it seems to be a conflict between 
Catholics and Prostestants, but they have 
the same language and culture. So you scratch you head and then think, "What the hell are they fi,ghting about over there?" That's part of the problem. · 
The other reason, I believe, is the 
b:oa~er issue of injustice affronting human 
dtgmty. whether in Ireland or anywhere in 
the. wor~d .. I.f you. believe in justice, you 
belteve m .tt m Chtle. the Philippines, you 
an~whe~e ~n the world. 1 may be a bit naive 
or tdealtst~c. but if I weren't fightjng the 
problems m ~reland, I would be doing it 
some.wher~ m. the world. Anywhere 
confltct extsts m th~ world, 1 believe you 
must tackle the baste causes of injustice. 
Observer: Arc you also seeking sources of 
financial support here? 

O'Ccallachain: The organization in the 
U.S. called Irish Northern Aid, which has been opera~ing for a number or years and, of course, ts registered with the Treasury ~ept,. .. that organization has been engaged m ratsmg money to support the families of the _nearly 2,000 political prisoners in E.ngltsh and -Irish j.<l:ils. The funds are paid~trectly to the fam!lt~s. and the whole thing ts carefully scrutmtzed by your security forces. and Irish security forces because everythi~g is handled through th'e banks. 
.There ts a lot of talk of guns coming from thts country. But in no case has it everbeen p~oven that funds sent through Northern Atd have gone to buy guns or has gone in any way to illicit activities. The IRA would be in a very poor state, indeed. if it was to depend ~otall.y, or to any great extent, on funds raised m the United States. Support comes from both within Ireland and other 
parts of the world as well. ~bserver: How did you first become mvolved with Sinn Fein? O'Ceallachain: At first, 1 became interest-

1920

m epen ent m · We were to achieve total economic and political indep­
endence, or as much as possible, tod eve1op our own resources. But I r~alized 
Eamon DeValera reviewing an IRA contingent [1921]. 
myself .. I came to the conclusion that one of the reasons for the violence was that we failed to achieve an independence in the past, and failed to build an independent Ireland. I decided that if the problem wasn't solved now, that it would only be worse in 20 or 30 years. 
I came to the conviction that we would have to build new institutions for all Ireland, because the institutions had failed in the South just as much as in the North. There is a great class distinction in the South, a great lack of opportunity for the poo~. and I c~m~ from a working class famtly myself; tt ts an awareness of these economic factors, plus the political factors I already mentioned, that makes me believe 
only a total revolution in Ireland could change things. 
At the same time, I think the new institutions should not be modeled on the Soviet Union or any other totalitarian regime. We do not believe in a Communist 
dictatorship. or any other kind of dictator­ship. We do ~eli~ve .that the Irish people can produce mstttuttons that will insure social change, as well as preserve individ­
ual freedom. Observer: Ireland, for the most part, is portrayed as the serene, idyllic Emerald 
 ·., In this kind of setting, do you think you can build a broad, popular base for your revolution, or will people want to keep things as they are? O'Ccallachain: I would say that the IRA does not have the support ofthe majority of the electorate, but at the same time, nobody ha~ ever c~nducted a poll askingtha~ questton. It ts a fact, that in any soctety. past of present, only a minority of the people are politically aware. It's true that in tin.1~s of con~ict, more people become ~oltttcally consctous, but apathy is a very btg problem. We feel somewhat helpless. because people do tend to opt out of politics. 
What I would say to you is this: the si.tuation in Ireland today is not really dtfferent from any other conflict of this nature. You have those who are active in nature, who analyze and study the situati­on and then set out, by sheer stamina and education. to bring about the changes for the general good of society. 
While saying that, I must point out that as late .as 1968, the IRA was almost totally non-extstant. It had altogether about three guns in Belfast. The IRA grew out of the state reaction to the civil rights movement. It was when this movement was forced off the str~ets that.people decided we can go on gettmg our skulls bashed in, stay in our homes and forget about it, or else we can defend ourselv~s. T~ose who support us went for the thtrd optton. Observer: The latest run of violence has lasted for six years, and from this side of the ocean, looks as though it will never end. What can you see as a possible solution to the conflict? ~'Ccal~achain: That is really a very1mposstble question. Somehow the people 
could stomach the violence, if they could see that it was leading somewhere. But in the ~.S., .one gets the feeling that we 
aren t gettmg anywhere. The reason for

e as t y years, or ts tt going to be a new peace, based on justice? So I can't say that ~ext .week, or next year, or whatever, there ts gomg to be an end to the conflict. What I can say to yo.u is that if the IRA were to put

Observer: What constructh·e role can violence play In remoYing the British? O'Ceallachain: I don't believe that violence is constructive in anv wav ... it's destructive: Wh~n the Allies decide(! to go to war agamst Httler. tt was a destructive policy. but aimed at a constructive objccti· ve. and that's the point. So the IRA campaign. to that extent, is destru-ctive. But remember. England is occupying Ireland. and the means. which \'OU asked about is forced upon us. If the Ir.ish people were occupying part of England. I would expect the English to tight against us. The means. of violence as you called it or resistance as we would .:all it. is aimed at making British rule in Ireland impossible. 
Observer: What is the ultimate goal for which your moyement has been struggling for so long? O'Ceallachain: We believe that Ireland has tremendous potential--economically, politically and in many other wavs. One of the tremendous tragedies of pa.rtition has been the tremendous concentration of the symbols of freedom·-the flag. the national anthem, while the public has paid little attention to what we call the bread and butter issues--housing. education for the poor, the question generally of the wealth of the people being plowed back into the economy. rather than siphoned off into Swiss or British banks. We want to see wealth held in Ireland and invested in Irish industry. There is more land 1\'ing barren and undeveloped in the south fhan there is in all of the six counties in the North. and we want to see this land developed for agriculture. We believe that real problems concern the land, nation-building. how to restore the economy. But as long as the basic injustices continue, it will be hard to harnes~ the strengths of the people to these tssues. When the British leave, that's when the real work begins, not the solving of the problems, but the beginning of tackling solutions. Observer: Upon British withdrawal, what would happen to the Prostetants In the North? O'Ceallachain: What we would hope is that in a new Ireland. and we no longer use the phrase "united Ireland," since that 
conjures upimages of the South taking over the North. we would hope that the Pr_otestants wouldjoin with us in building thts ne"": Ireland. Y~u should not forget that dunng the Amencan Revolution. vou had many Loyalists who were at first opposed to independence, but later switc­hed allegiance. I think we can convince our fellow Protl!:stant countrymen that a new I:etand has a tremendous economic poten­ttal. and we could develop it together to win the admiration of the world. The main issue in this whole conflict is not religious. but how to restructure Irish society without British interference. ­
Observer: Would you then agree with the old Irish prophesy, that an Ireland dh ided will never be an Ireland at peace? O'Ceallachain: That, by and large is true. Observer: Thank you, Mr. O'Ceallacbllin.

Hockey team to hold Expo 
Thursday, Oct. 7 at 7pm head coach Lefty ~mith, assistant coach Rick Schaferand their Notre Dame hockey team will demonstrate the rudiments of hockey, hold a scrim­mage and give away autographed team pictures at the first annual Notre Dame Hockey Expo. 
"What we hope' to do," com­ments Smith, "is to orient fans to the game of hockey. Although it may appear complicated to a spectator viewing a hockey game for the first time. once you grasp certain basic situations the game is very easy to understand." 
Beginning at 7 o'clock Smith and Schafer will be describing the basic hockey skills and fundamental stra­tegies as they are demonstrated by the Irish skaters. These fundamen­tals will include the correct shoot­ing technique, position play, pen­alty and power play strategies and common infractions. 
ND tennis team to hos,t tourney 
The fourth annual Notre Dame Fall Invitational tennis tournament will be held this Friday through Sunday. Six schools will take part in the round robin tournev which will begin at I 0 am at the Courtney Tennis Center behind the ACC. The schools entered include North­western. Indiana State. Purdue, Illinois State. and the host Irish. 
Notre Dame, defending Eastern Collegiate tennis champion, has twice captured team honors in the fall classic, including its victory in 1975. Irish Coach Tom Fallon anticipates a strong balance down 
Immediately following this pres­entation the Irish will scrimmage under game conditions for one period while coaches Smith and Schafer comment on the play. "We will be making insights involving the finer points of hockey p~taining to situations and occur­rences that hockey fans sometimes miss during the course of the game." states Smith. 
At the conclusion of the scrim­mage the Irish will be available to autograph complimentary team pictures as well as to pose for pictures with those fans bringing their own call)eras. 
Go,ing hand-in-hand with this Hockey Expo, the Irish staff has produced a slide presentation depicting hockey situations and strategies basic to the ga'l1e. This presentation will be available to any club; group or team by calling 283-8488.

Freshman John Lundgren lead 
the  way  for  the  Irish  firing  an  
even-par  71  to  take  individual  
honors.  The  Minnesota  native  

commented afterword that he "worked hard" in shooting his round, making long birdie puts on the first and seventh holes and then holing a birdie putt on the final green for the even-par round. 
Senior Bob Belmonte registered one birdie in shooting a 74 while Tim Saurs fired a one-under par 34 on the back nine to finish at 75. Freshman Dave Knee and Indiana Intercollegiate runn~r-up Biv Wad­den rounded out the Notre Dame scoring at 373 with 76 and 77 respectively, 
Sophomore Dave Richert scored three birdies enroute to a 72, leading the non-scoring Notre 
Dame blue team to a 377 total. Mike Gennette, a monogram win­ner from last spring, toured the front nine in even par and closed at 74. 
Yesterday's convincing victory was the Irish's first in their own 
pairs will include Stehlik and Hainline. Fallon and Harris and the duo of Bruno and Horan. 
Competition among the six schools is expected to be fierce. Indiana boasts several transfer St!Jdcnts from San Diego and is also represented by Jeff True, a high school product and current city champion of South Bend. 
Conventional scoring methods will be replaced by eight-game pro sets to allow for near simultaneous conclusion of all matches. When at deuce. the next winning point will automatically decide the game.

Season injuries plague ND harriers 
by Gregory Solman 
Sports Writer 
Imagine our Notre Dame basket­
ball team suddenly missing two of 
the starting five. Think of where 
the football team would be if nine 
of the starting players were sud­
denly unable to play.. Coach Joe 
Piane of the Notre Dame Cross­
Country team has done more than 
think about it this year--he has 
experienced it, losing three of the 
teams top runners to unexpected 
injuries. 
The loss of three men, Jay 
Miranda, Bill Olmendinger and 
Steve Welch, has greatly affected

difficult to see why the Irish have 
dropped both. 
"I don't know of any team 
around that has the depth to lose 
three of their best kids," commen­
ted a bewildered Joe Piane. "Look 
at it in this light--we've lost 40 
percent of our best talent." 
Strangely enough, Piane claims 
that the sport of cross-country isn't 
normally prone to injuries. "You 
have to anticipate some sore knees

"Ed would have been one of the top runners on our team," com­mented Reinhart. 
It's hard to imagine how good this team might have been had they not been plagued with this rash of injuries. One can only guess. "I believe we would have soundly beaten Purdue, and we would have had a good shot against Michi­gan," said Pian e. "As for the Notre Dame Invitational, we were shooting to place in the top three.

Pray as they did, the injuries came. If fact, captain Jim Reinhart claims that there is hardly a member of the team that isn't presently afflicted with a minor injury of sorts, including Reinhart himself, who has been putting ice-packs on his knee after meets for a nagging knee ailment that has been bothering him for two or three years.

Women's lnterhall 

Women's Interhall football is looking good, or so the fans thought Sunday night at the big double headet on the astroturf; Walsh against Lyons,_and Badin against Lewis. Surprisingly enough. most of the stands were filled for both games. And it seemed they came to see some good football games, instead of for a good laugh, as was traditionally the case. 
There are several reasons for this improvement. The obvious reason is experience. As women's interhall begins its fifth year the girls are no longer pla-ying scrap football. Many of them are four year veterans and skilled at flag football. Evidence of this is seen in the much more accurate passing, more blocked passes and generally more intricate plays than ever before. 
During these past four years, the sport has become quite popular with the ladies, so much so that this year, Lewis hall entered a roster of 65 women for their team. All the teams are larger this year and all have at least two coaches, excepting Fr. Lally who solely coaches all of Walsh's team. 
Another reason for the improvement is the astroturf. For the first time the women are playing on the well-lit field, and the new setting definitely psyches them up. 
The better officiating also adds professionalism to the game. This year most of the games are called by at least three officials. Rich Hunter and his crew must be commended for not only their expertise, but comic relief as well . 
In any event, it all adds up to some good football. Sunday night in particular saw some fine action as Walsh barely edged out Lyons 18-16, and Lewis stunned Badin 18-6. Look for more action under the lights Thursday night as Badin and Lyons compete at 7, and Lewis and Walsh at 
8.

Who's the class of the N.L.? 

For those of you who enjoy basketball games that end with both teams scoring in the 140's, and foot­ball games in which the combatants combine for over 1000 yards in total offense, the National League Playoffs will be a spectical you won't want to miss. 
The Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds are the most explosive teamsin baseball and one need only look at the major National League . offensive statistics to predict the type of contests that will be played in this series. Five of the top eight batting averages, the top four run-scorers, four of the top five run producers (RBI's), and three of the top five homerun hitters will all be in attendance for the opening of the playoffs in Philadelphia on Saturday. Those of you planning on keeping score should bring at least three extra score sheets. It'll be a statistician's nightmare. 
It is difficult to predict what facet of the game will Qe the key to this series. The Phillies and Reds will not be able to rely on just their hitting strengths 
when they confront one another. Here is a look at the key strengths and weaknesses of each team in the important departments. 
PITCHING In a series in which the artificial turf is liable to turn red from the repeated scorching singles of Rose, Morgan, Cash and Schmidt, it will be o;urprising if anyone can go the distance. Pat Zachry of the Red is the only starting hurler with a sub 3.00 ERA for either team. Zachry's probable opponent in Saturday's opener will be Steve Carlton, who has a most impressive won-loss record and strikeout mark but a mediocre 3.21 ERA and a iendency to give up the long ball. 

I 
Tom Underwood vs. Fred Norman would be an excellent second game match-up if both could pitch in their respective home ball parks. Underwood was 12-1 last year in Vet Stadium but only 2-~1 on the road. This season he had a 10-5 record w1th a 3.35 ERA. but was hammered again on the road. Norman 
also loves the friendly atmosphere of his home parkl and will probably get a start in a fourth or fifth game, 
I 
if there is one. Gary Nolan, who is the youngest ten-year veteran int baseball. led the Reds in wins with 15. He was one of ~ seven Reds with ten wins or more, a major league record. Santo Alcala was a big surprise for sparky Anderson's club as he finished second in the league in a won-loss percentage. Anderson can call on many to eithef'start or put 
I 
the fire out in the late innings, as he has the most versatile staff in the league. Jack Billingham who had the second worst ERA in the league, Don Gullet, and Alcala could either start or finish games for the 
 
Reds . The Reds may have a slight edge with their 
multitude of starters but the Phillies are blessed with three solid releivers in Tug McGraw, Gene Garber and Ron Reed. All three were ranked in the top 15 of the Fireman of the Year race. Reed, who still holds some Notre Dame basketball records, led the staff in saves with 14 and was fourth in the league in earned run average. 
The Reds will counter with Rawley Eastwick who led the league in earned run average and was credited with a league high 25 saves. But, in this series the bullpen performances will be the key, and Rawley can't face the pressure day in and day out. He has not 

... gotten the help rom Will McEnaney that was expected. EDGE: Phillies gain slight edge here. 
OUTFIELD: With so many sonar shots to be fielded on the pastures of Riverfront and the Vet defense will 

.. 
be a necessity. Cincinnati has the best in Caesar Geronimowho also had his best year by far offensively as he hit 310. Ken Griffey can also fly over the artificial turf and was the surprise hitter of the league finishing second in the batting average derby. George Foster carried the Reds the first three months 
of  the  season  and  coasted  to  a  29  HR,  and  
league- leading  121 R BI season.  ,  
The  Phillies  also  have  plenty  of  power  in  the  

outfield, but leave the defensive chores up to Gary Maddox. Maddox finished third in the league with a .330 average and is the defending centerfield Gold Glove winner. But Greg "the Bull" Luzinski does about an 8.4 forty and plays so close to the left-field fould pole that any shot up the left field alley is a sure double. Luzinski hit a solid .304, but hit only two of his 21 homers the .last month and a half. Jay Johnstone, who usually platoons with Ollie Brown, hit 
a .318 but only against right-handed pitching. He still made almost 500 plate appearances which shows how much the league respected the Phillie right side power. Ollie Brown had an off year hitting .254 and only went "downtown" five times. EDGE: Reds hit more consistently with power and possess a superior defense. 
INFIELD: Last season, Dave Cash aQd Larry Bowa became the f1rst second base-shortstop combination to hit over .300, but this season they failed to continue that consistency. Cash hit .284 including 9-11 at season's end, while Bowa fell to .248. both continued their excellent fielding however. The Reds keystone duo may not be as slick fielding, but have all-around talent. Joe Morgan is the most complete player in baseball as he ranked among the league's elite in six of eight key offensive areas. He was the first second baseman to knock in over 110 runs in 26 years. Dave Concepcion hit a solid .283 and drove in close to 70 runs. 
At the corners the Reds have Tony Perez, who is the only man in the last ten years to knock in over 90 runs each season, and Pete Rose, the team leader and the team's MVP. Rose Jed the league in runs, hits, doubles and head first slides. the Phillies counter with Mike Schmidt who Jed the majors in homeruns for the third consecutive year with 38, and Dick Allen, who hit 15 homers in an injury-suspension riddled season. EDGE: Reds have consistent offensive production at every position. 
SUMMARY: A key to this series will be the 
performance of , Johnny Bench, who hit an a,JCmic .237 with only 16 homers and 75 RBI'S. He is notorious for coming through the clutch and could salvage a disappointing year with a solid playoff. Ron Boone of Phillies got off to a hot start, but cooled off as the doubleheaders piled up. His ability to keep the Reds honest on the base paths could make or break the Phillies hopes. 
Another key is the all-important intangible team unity. Sparky Anderson runs a tight ship. He is also blessed with the finest team captain in baseball in Pete Rose. Danny Ozark is not as fortunate as his team leader, Dave Cash, is playing out his contract. Disatisfied players can ruin a team, just ask the Boston Red Sox. Ozark must also contend with Dick Allen, the Art Best of the major leagues. 
The Reds have been in the playoffs four of the last six seasons, and have basicafly the same team that went all the way last year. Although the Phillies won 17 of their last 22 games they blew 12 games of a 15 game lead between August 24 and September 17. Look for Cincinnati to paint the Phils red in one of the most exciting four game series in years.
