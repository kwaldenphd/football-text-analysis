Roemer warns: Undercover state agents patrol in bars 

by Frank Tennant Staff Reporter 
Dean of Students James Roemer said local authorities informed him that three Notre Dame students would be issuod affidavits for their arrest. The three sold drugs to local undercover agents. 
Roemer yesterday clarified state­ments which appeared in the Observer prior to break. He does not know when the sales occurred or what substance was sold. 
The affidavits have not been issued yet. The agents usually remain undercover for tive or six months and all affidavits arc held for this time, according to Roemer. Once an affidavit is issued, the agent becomes knowm. 
Roemer revealed the purchases were not made on campus and that the undercover agents were not on campus. 
Asked about the agents on campus, Roemer replied, "I will cooperate with authorities 100 per­cent if informed that authorities knew students were selling drugs on campus." This could mean bringing undercover agents on campus. 
Roemer explained the procedure used by law enforcement agencies. Thev use new recruits on the force who arc not known as law enforce­ment officers. and they patrol the local bars students attend. Roemer warned that undercover agents blend in with college students as they are usually in the same age group. 
The only agencies able to enter campus are the Indiana State Police and St. Joe County Sheriffs. Roemer said they need not ask permission to come on campus. South Bend Police jurisdiction does not extend to Notre Dame. 
The three agencies listed all conduct constant undercover oper­ations according to Roemer. They have full time vice squads. 
"I have no sympathy at all for students apprehended and con­victed of selling drugs," stated Roemer. "People who break the law are on their own." 
While Roemer may help a stu­dent in trouble with local authori­ties in other situations, he said he would not help in the case of drug violations. 
"It would mess up his case if I kicked a guy out of school before he was tried.'' He will await the court decision and then abide by it. 
Selling drugs is a felony. Roemer pointed out the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor is that a felony is punishable by a state prison sentence. He added, from his experience as City Attorney, the prosecutor in South Bend always treats sale of drugs as a felony. 
Roemer hopes the publicity makes students more aware of the seriousness of what they are doing. He warned students to think of their futures before engaging in drug activity. "I don't know of any law school or medical school who will accept a student convicted of selling drugs," he said. "Jobs are equally hard to get when one has a record."

Junta strengthens control; Argentine media censored 
by Alfonso Chardy Associated Press Writer 

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -Many of deposed President Isabel Peron's ministers and aides as well as political leaders and union officials were reported under 
arrest  yesterday  as  the  military  
junta consolidated po wer.  
The  45-year-old  Mrs.  Peron,  

ousted early Wednesday in a bloodless coup after 21 months in office, was said to be still held in a resort area nearly 1,000 miles from Buenos Aires. 
The junta, which did not say how many persons were under arrest, named one of those seized as Mrs. Peron's private secretary, Julio Gonzalez, considered the power behind the presidency, and her main bodyguard. 
The junta also raided the metal­workers union headquarters and stormed the Communist party of­fice, arresting a number of per­sons, one of whom reportedly was wounded by gunfire. 
A brief anti-coup walkout was staged in the city of Cordoba and

Junta's activities 
Meanwhile, the junta imposed strict censorship on the local media, dissolved congress, banned political and labor union activity, seized control of the main labor federations which made up the backbone of the Peronist govern­ment, and installed military gover­nors in the provinces. There was no apparent censorship of outgoing dispatches. 
Airports and theaters were al­lowed to reopen and radio and televisinn stations returned to nor­mal programing after a day of martial music and communiques, but banks and schools remained closed. 
Traffic was normal and no curfew was in effect, although the junta urged people to stay at home at night. Embassies and public buld­ings, including the pink-painted Government House, were guarded by soldiers in battle fatigues. Tanks guarded key areas.

The junta has said a president will be named later and some observers expect Videla to be installed. The junta also promised an eventual return to "republican democracy" but set no timetable. 
Peron's whereabouts 
There has been no official dis­closure of Mrs. Peron's where­abouts, but military sources say she is staying at a luxurious rest compound at El Messidor, 900 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. 
News reports said a number of guests there left for other hotels on military orders. The reports said the only guest now is Mrs. Peron. 
She arrived in a car from the lake and ski resort of Bariloche, two houro; awa: by road, the reports said.

Conviction appealed for 12-year-old in murder case 
WASHINGTON AP-The lawyer for a 12-year-old boy convicted of first-degree murder said Thursday he will appeal the conviction since the elderly woman victim died only 
after  her  doctor  turned  off  a  
life-sustaining machine.  
"My  client  is  innocent  of  the  

murder charge," Robert W. Michels said in a telephone inter­view. 
The boy. whose name was kept secret because of his age, was convicted in D.C Juvenile Court Wednesday in the death of Gladys 
H. Werlich. 85, a Washington socialite in the 1920's and 1930's. 
Mrs. Werlich suffered a skull fracture .Jan. 13 when she was knocked to the ground by four boys who were trying to steal her purse. 
But she did not die until .Jan. 19 when DR. Michael W. Dennis of George Washington Hospital shut down the breathing appartus keep­ing Mrs. Werlich alive. 
The case has aroused special interest because of the age of the defendant and because of the 
· current controversy over whether 
again function normally should be kept alive by artificial means. 
The controversy was touched off by the case of Karen Quinlan. the coma-stricken New Jersey woman whose parents have unsuccessfully sought a court order to turn off the machines keeping her alive. 
Dennis said he turned off Mrs. Werlich 's machine after consulta­' tions with her family because a part

Despite warnings 
Senate lets Concorde land 
by Jay Perkins 
Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Sen­ate yesterday refused to prohibit the Concorde supersonic jet from making scheduled flights into all 
U.S. airports. 
Bv a 50-31 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have added the Concorde ban to a bill authorizing $4.7 billion over 10 years to fund airport development. 
The Senate then considered an amendment allowing the Depart­ment of Transportation to take $800 million from the airport trust fund to quiet existing jets that make more noise than allowed by federal regulations. 
The Senate ban on the Concorde, if it had passed, would have been permanent and would have applied to all U.S. airports. The House already has passed legislation pro­hibiting the Concorde, but the House bill would only ban the plane for six months. 
In addition. the House measure would not affect Dulles Interna­tional Airport outside Washington,

one of the two airports where the plane is scheduled to land. 
Transportation Secretary Wil­liam T. Coleman, Jr.. on Feb. 4. authorized Air France and British Airways to use the Concorde on two daily flights each into John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and on one daily flight each into Dulles Airport for up to 16 months. 
Coleman said this test period would allow the federal govern­ment time to determine if the plane were environmentally sound. 
The Port Authority of New York-New Jersey has banned the plane at Kennedy Airport, how­ever, and the airlines are challeng­ing that decision in court. 
Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., told the Senate that admitting the Concorde would be a step back­ward in the nation's effort to improve its environment. 
The plane, he said, produces far more noise on takeoff and landing than conventional jets, creates more pollution around airports than conventional planes and could harm the earth's ozone layer that protects human life from poten­tially cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. 
Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., argued that attempts to ban the Concorde were similar to attempts by some in the first years of flight "to characterize airplanes as creat­ures of the devil." 
Cannon noted those early oppon­ents of aviation are viewed today as eccentrics. Such individuals still are around, he said, but now they "have wrapped themselves in the Robin Hood-like cloak of environ­mental considerations." 
Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., also urged the Senate to reject the Concorde amendment, saying the issue had become "a litmus test in Europe as to whether the U.S. is playing a fair game." 
Percy noted Europeans nations had accepted U.S. jet aircraft when those planes were first developed even though the jets were far noisier aircraft than those in use. He said the country should admit the Concorde so that it could learn how a better version could be built. 
HERE'S HOPING THAT GOOD WEATHER PREVAILS! And so, as another Hoosier spring ~rifts in, we can once again catch some rays, play THE GAME and nd ourselves of winter colds.

UNITED NATIONS* N.Y. (AP)­The United States vetoed a Security Council resolution Thursday night that would have rebuked Israel for its entrenchment in Jerusalem and its administration of other occupied territories. 
All the other 14 members of the Security Council voted for the resolution. which was proposed by a group of nonaligned nations. 
The veto cast by U.S. Ambassa­dor William W. Scranton was the 14th by the United States in the Securitv Council and the fifth dealing with the Middle East. 
It killed a resolution that had been carefully designed to avoid a 
Fair endorsed by Hatcher for May governor's race 
GARY* Ind. AP-State Senate Minority leader Robert J. Fair of Princeton has picked up the en­dorsement of Gary Mayor Richeard 
G. Hatcher for Democratic nomina­tion for governer in Indiana's May 4 primary. 
Hatcher's endorsement was con­sidered a major boost for Fair since it guaranteed him the active backing of the Gary political mach­ine. 
It was the Fair's first major endorsement. He is running against Secretary of State Larry A. Conrad and State Treasurer Jack L. New. 
Gary. the state's thrid largest city. is the largest under Democra­tic administration. 
Hatcher. a third-term mayor, called Fair an "able candidate" and friend of Gary since he helped push through the 1976 legislature a hill authorizing construction of a downtown civic center in Gary. 
"When I make a judgement like this. it'~ because he's the bestg person,·· Hatcher told about ISO persons. mostly city workers in the city council chamber. 
By supporting Fair, Hatcher lined up opposite Lake County Democratic Chairman Robert A Pastrick, the East Chicago mayor who has been Hatcher's main rival for party power in Indiana's north­western corner. Pastrick favors Conrad for the nomination.D 
Hatcher and Pastrick have b een patching up their differences, and both had endorsed 17-term Rep. Ray J. Madden for renomination over State Sen Adam Benjamin Jr. of Gary.

He said he would campaign around the state for fair and other candidates. 
Fair said Gary has been ignored by state government, but said, ''As governor, I would see that that didn't exist. Gary would get the recognition it deserves.'' 
Fair also said it was shameful that it took a federal court order for Indiana State Police to actively recruit more black troopers. There cil.

The reference was to Scranton's oft-quoted 1968 recommendation for a "more evenhanded" U.S. policy in the Middle East.

U.S. officials said the speech contained no views that had not been stated before. 
The Israelis made clear what really angered them was that the speech came during a debate in which Israel was already on the defensive against a barrage of attacks. 
Reports from Tel Aviv said State Department officials had reassured the Israelis that despite "some unfortunate expressions" in Scra­nton's speech, Washington had made no change in its Mideast policy.

Next primaries April 6
t Candidates keep stumping for primaries 
Sen. Henry M . .Iackson of Wash­
ington sougllt urban backing in 
New York with a plan to save 
America's cities, while former 
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter looked 
for farm support in Wisconsin with 
criticism of President Ford's agri­
cultural policy. 
The locations and issues were 
different, but the two candidates 
for the Democratic presidential 
nomination had the same goal: 
votes in April 6 primaries. 
On the Republican side, Ford's 
campaign strategists were still 
weighing the effect of Ronald 
Reagan's victory in North Carolina 
-his first of the campaign season. 
And the former California gover­
nor was working at home while his 
aides negotiated for television time 
for a nationwide address next

Of the six Democratic primaries 
so far, Carter has won five and

Aid (or cities 

In New York City. Jackson urged 
increased federal aid for urban 
areas. "It may be fashionable for 
politicians to run against Washing­
ton and to argue for reduced 
federal role. but anybody who 
knows anything about it, knows the 
cities cannot survive without sub­
stantially increased federal aid... 
Jackson said in an apparent refer­
ence to Carter, who has been 
sharply critical of the Washington 
power structure. 
Carter defended his attacks on 
the federal government. denying 
that they arc attacks on programs 
for the poor and the cities. "It is 
time for a fresh approach to be 
brought to Wa~hington to phase 
out those things that arc unman­
agl·ahk." he said in Wisconsin. "It

Penn Central RR ordered to repair old Indiana tracks 
INDIANAPOLIS AP-The bankrupt Penn Central Railroad has been ordered to repair deteriorated track that forces rerouting of the James Whitcomb Riley and Floridian pas­senger trains in Indiana. 
U.S. District Court Judge Wil­liam E. Steckler issued an order late Wednesday giving the railroad two years to complete an estimated $22.7 million rehabilitation pro­gram to bring the track b<tck up to llJ71 quality. 
The order was issued after 
Amtrak sued Penn Central for 
breach of llJ71 contract giving 
Amtrak the right to run its passen­
ger trains over Penn Central track 
in Indiana. 
Amtrark said Penn Central's 
failun· to maintain the track forced 
it to reroute passenger trains to

Poisonous Bottle 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijmichae1 vii/ani 
The federal Food and Drug Administration has slid through another consumer product of questionable safety with its recent approval of a plastic bottle made of possibly carcinogenic vinyl-cyanide. 
Vinyl-cyanide or acrylonitrile is a chemical compound with identical structure to that of vinyl-chloride except that it has a cyanide molecule instead of a chlorine atom. This chemical substance falls in the shadow of vinyl chloride in that it too has questionable effects on man. As vinyl chloride is under attack by consumer interest groups, particularly the National Resources Defense Council, for its involvement in causing liver cancers, so is acrylonitrile for its damaging effects to the adrenal glands and endocrine system. Such evidence is the result of toxicity studies in vinyl-cyanide done at Harvard Medical School by Dr. Sandor Szabo. 
Unfortunately, however, according to Business Week, October 13, 1975, this d~IJ·atable new product, made by Borg-Warner Chemical Co., is good news for bottling and packaging companies. The plastic bottle is attractive to food processors for its low weight and low breakage properties. For example Coors brewery will save 25 per cent in shipping costs in reducing the container weight of its products by using this plastic bottle. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. will avoid the great expense of collection and sterilization procedures with the elimination of return/deposit bottles when they incorporate this new and questionable plastic bottle into their organization. Several other large food processors are expected to go this criticized route beginning this month, and I am sure if alcohol didn't dissolve plastic, we would see major distilleries doing the same. 
The point, however, according to Jeff Cox, Executive Editor of Environmental Action Bulletin, is that "capital interest is taking precedence over human health." The FDA approved this bottle with no evidence of its safety except two 90-day feeding studies by Monsanto Co. that showed nothing. In fact, the FDA is also basing its approval of this bottle on an inadequate 30-year-old scientific study done by P.E. Tullar at George Washington University in 1947. The study consisted of a small sample of single-sexed animals fed acrylonitrile. Based on today's more extensive and available lab procedures I would consider such a study outmoded. 
Dr. Szabo daims, on the basis of long-term, low-concentration studies of this problem, that "In high doses, the acute effects of acrylonitrile are severe shocks to the adrenal glands, including adrenal failure. Plus, the substance damages the endocrine system. It also causes intestinal ulcers. Rats given high doses die within a few hours." 
With such medical evidence it seems outrageous that the FDA should make such approvals. The pattern over the years shows that the FDA doesn't look deeply into the medical dangers involved with the incorporation of new chemical products into our food system. They should better police such manufactures before allowing anything to become part of our bod supply. 
The chemistry behind the dangers of the acrylonitrile bottle consists of the vinyl-cyanide molecules that are not completely held into the plastic. Therefore, some loosely held parts of vinyl-cyanide leak out of the plastic and into the foodstuff contains in the bottle. Furthermore, in an environmental sense, the nondegradable plastic contributes to our country's waste load, requires more energy to manufacture than glass bottles, when burnt it sends toxis gases (hydrogen cyanide, used for executions in gas chambers) into our atmosphere, it is constructed from our already limited petroleum supplies, we lack any real substance of reports on the long-term effects of acrylonitrile and hydrogen cyanide on man, and most startling is the fact that, at one time, acrylonitrile was considered to be ten times more toxic than vinyl chloride. 
At present the National Resource Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund have filed suit against the FDA for th~ir unconcerned approval to market a compound that is obviously dangerous to our health. One should seriously consider the effects that such a product could have on man if put on the national market in the form of soft-drink bottles. Lastly, our congressmen should be made aware of the great implications that could arise from this severe show of FDA deficiency in approving a substance having no concrete evidence for .its. safety...

Letters to a Lonely God 
ah, m~ foes, and ,oh, m~ friends 
Reverend Robert Griffin 


There arc some years when I feel! won't care if I never see another frisbee. This lovely, warm afternoon, I have sat in my office with the drapes drawn. A moment ago, I looked out, and sure enough, there was a kid outside my window throwing frisbees; in the autumn, they arc always throwing footballs. I wish they would go away. I don't dislike kids, I bear no grudges agianst frisbees; but kids throw­ing them make me restless. The very sight of them causes absurd images to spring up in my mind. I think to myself: I wish I were a frisbee thrown by the hand of Christ. I wish God would send me skimming high over the earth into the path of the sun, spiralling me in an arc so graceful that observers might almost think that I had wings. It is silly for a man to wish he were a frisbee, but I don't think it is silly for a man to wish that God would do graceful things with that man's life. 
I don't suppose a frisbee ever wishes it were a man sitting in an office behind closed drapes. Especially, I don't suppose a frisbee ever wishes it were a man sitting in an office, wishing he were a frisbee thrown by the hand of Christ. Frisbees are just dumb plastic discs, helpless to have any life of their own without the skill of schoolboys who give them the motions of birds. Priests, too, need the touch of the Master's hand; otherwise they arc just great, lumpish. earthy things who can 
never aspire to brush the heavens. There is another kind of restlessness that comes with the frisbees in the springtime; it is the restlessness of knowing that a school year is nearly over. when you will be off to adventures in the City. In summer, from morning until evening, there arc kids 
throwing frisbees in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. City kids can teac..·h Notre Dame students a trick or two 
about throwing frisbees. New York frisbees do spins that living creatures would need feathers to duplicate. But town frisbees or c..·ountry frisbees, those frisbees link the spring to the summer and the summer to the spring. It is only the presence of a certain kind of grace that separates the April frolic_s on the Quads from the games of August 111 the Park. 
I remember a summer evening of frisbee watching. in Washington Square, when a young girl suddenly handed me a lighted candle. When I asked her why, she simply said, "It's a gift." It was a charming gift, reminding me of Edna St. Vincent Millay, a Village poet, born in Maine, named in the middle after St. Vincent's Hospital. which was only a frisbee's throw away from Washington Square. The only appropriate words for blessing a candle are the words 0f her poem: 
My candle burns at both its ends. 
It will not last the night; 
But. ah. my foes. and oh, my friends. 
It gives a lbvcly ltght. 
1 walked around the Village that even­ing, repeating those words, carrying that candle like an altar boy in search of a Mass. I swear that at the sight of me, candles were lighted in the faces of the people I met. I was greatly admired that evening, and I admired myself for lighting a candle (or keeping it lit) rather than cursing the darkness. 
After a little while, I gave the candle to a young man who became so ecstatic that he seemed, like Simeon and Anna, to have been waiting all his life for a gift of light. He organized a religious procession around that flickering taper, as though he were a roving grotto. He wandered off through the streets, chanting the Hare Krishna, and there was a crowd of people chanting the Hare Krishna behind him. A few moments earlier, that same crowd nearly had their heads split in a near-confrontation with the Tactical Police Force, summoned in sup­port of the park constables who were forcing a man to come down from a tree. That crowd decided that candles were more fun than billy clubs, which is an insight they could have shared with moths. 
There has been a lot of poetry written about candles, but no poetry at all written about frisbees. On behalf of candles Shakespeare wrote lines like these: "Lo, how the little candles throws its beam. So chines a good deed in a naughty world," or, "All our yesterdays have lighted fools/ The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow...

Dear Clyde. 

My roommate is driving me craLy. 
For one thing he makes queer noises. When he wakes up in the morning he makes grunting. sniffling and puking noises. When he's reading or sitting he makes bird noises. 
He changes his clothes about once a wc..T k·. He has BO which could kill a horse. Ever.vthing in the room is a shelf--the tloor. the couch. his desk~ the beds. Books. 
socks. his robe. typewriter. paper. used Klccnexcs, half a dozen pairs of shoes. pants. coat~. and records arc scattered all 
over the room. If I clean the place up. he can return the room to its original condition in under IS minutes. 
He listens to music which is so ancient it bn· t even classical. It's some Dark Ages stuff with a lot of tlutes and drums and falsetto yelling. 
He farts in his sleep. 
He goes to bed about 4 a.m. and complains about my "early to bed. early to rise" habits when I want to go to bed a·t 2. He eats with his mouth O]Jen. He loves to look at porno magazines but he hasn't had a date for over a year. 
He can't hold his liquor. . 
He verbally abuses all the girls I date. He wouldn't know how to physicallv abuse them. · · 
He has the tact of a punc..h in the----. 
He is extremely ugly.

b_reak of day arising/ From sullen earth, smgs hymns at heaven's gate"? He could have written lines like that for the frisbee, but of course, he didn't. Frisbees don't sing anyway. Sometimes priests wishing they were God's frisbees don't sing much either, though hopefully, at heaven's gate, they will someday sing hymns. 
In the meantime, there is the restless­ness of springtimes to be lived through, and right now, one feels inadequate to that gift of glory. Everywhere, soon, it will be April, and you still feel as shabby as a worn winter coat. April, it is 5aid, is the cruellest month but then, ;f ever. the forsythia comes, when it seems that the earth itself is a young girl giving candles away to everyone. With the forsythia to charm us, we don't need to sail like the frisbee into the pathway of the sun, because the sunshine has come to us on every yellow shrub. At least, that's what I keept telling my~elf, in a fit of bad poetry and lousy logtc. Otherwise those kids with their plastic toys outside my window would really drive me to drink. 
Dear Digusted, 
I have it on good authority that you're 
not exactly a cuddly kitten yourself. But we 
won't get into that here. 
Remember, that beauty is in the eye of 
t~c beholder. so try a new pair of glasses. 
II that docsn t work. I know a 1ailor who 
makes great straightjackets, in case you 
really do go crazy. 
P.S. W:~trh th" n:~nlC'. Bonnie. Dear Clydcmncstra, 
I am writing to you because I have no one 
else to turn to. This is the first time I have 
ever written to a service such as vours. and 
I am really" so emharassed. · 
My problem concerns my roommate. 
Whenever we split a pizza from rood sales. 
he never pays for his half. I am the one 
who always calls and orders the pizza; and 
I_ am always the one who runs down, pays 
lor the pizza and brings it back to the room. 
But my roommate never offers to pay me 
b~c~ for his h~lf ?f the pizza. I am really 
atr~td to ask tum for the money. because he 
wetghs 100 lbs. more than I do. and he 
might explode into a rage and belt me. 1 
don't think he really means to cheat me out 
of my money. I think he just forgets to pay 
me back. But. as I have said. I am afraid to 
approach him for repayment. Can you 
help me solve my dimemna. and live the 
happy life I once lived? God bless you, Clydcmnestra, Dear Pizza, Pizza F 
Come up to my room sometime, and we 
can take care of your embarrassment then. 
In the meantime, add a little kaopectate 
to the pepperoni and cheese. After a 
co~ple of_ weeks he sould lose plenty of 
wetght, smce he seems full of something 
besides pizza. 
Then collect. 
Dear Clytemnestl'a, 
I am a bewildered freshman and after 
consulting every other counselor I know 
and getting no satisfaction, I've decided to 
write to you. 
My problem is I don't know what I want 
to be. It wasn't until four years ago that I 
stopped wanting to be a fireman, and I 
gave up on being the president after Nixon 
was forced to resign (it destroyed all my 
dreams about the office). 
When I came to Notre Dame last 
semester I had decided I wanted to be a 
drama major. But around November I got 
real interested in nuclear physics. My 
problem is I can't do math and am 
presently Dunking Calc lOS. 
My parents want me to become a 
business major or a premed, my counselor 
says to go into the general program in Arts 
and Letters, my girlfriend says to jump in 
the lake, and my dog bit me when I went 
home for spring break. 
Can you please tell me what you think I 
should do? Thanks a whole lot. 
Bewildered freshman 

Dear Bewildered, 
Anyway, have you thought of forgetting everybody and becoming a dining hall CQef? You can do anything you want in there, and somebody will eat it. . 

Indiana crime increases "GRAND OPENING" * 
INDIANAPOLIS AP -Serious crime in Indiana's six largest cities increased 14.9 percent last year, sharply above the national average, the FBI reported today. 
The national jump was 9 percent. 

The figures indicated that crime increased faster in Indiana last year than it did in 1974. while the increase slowed significantly on a national level. 
In 1974, the state crime index was 10.2 percent higher than 1973, compared with an average national increase of 18 percent. 
The preliminary FBI report re­leased today showed the biggest jump in Indianapolis. the only one of the six Hoosier ciaties to report an increase in each of the seven categories. Overall, the Hoosier capital saw a_22.5 percent jump, including 20 more murders than L l'r'4. 
Evansville registered an 11.2 percent drop. mainly due to fewer reported property crimes. 
The other four Indiana cities in 

the FBI listing reported increases ­

Councilman sues to show movie 
ROCHESTER. N.Y. (AP) -City 

Councilman Christopher Lindley 
has gone to court to win the right to 
show the movie ''All the Presi­
dent's Men" to pay off his cam­
paign debts. 
Lindlev. a Democrat, said he had 

planned -to show the movie April 7 
and has sold 390 tickets at $10 each 
to pay $3.500 in debts left from his 
successful election campaign last 
fall. 
Warner Bros .. however. told him 

he could not show the movie. he 
said. because it had an agreement 
with actor Robert Redford not to 
allow usc of the movie for political 
purposes. 
Lindley's lawyer. Thomas Dig­

man said he phoned Redford in 
Utah, but couldn't get him to 
change his mind. 
"He is a very decent. forthright 

guy." Digman said. "But he's 
antipolitical this year and said the 
movie was made for the people." 
An order issued Wednesday by 

the state Supreme Court directs 
Warner Bros. and Jo-Mor Enter­
prise~. the local theater operator, 
to show cause Monday why the 
picture cannot be screened.

Leave Angola by Saturday 
South Africa withdraws 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa AP­South Africa announced yesterday it will withdraw all its forces from southern Angola by Saturday, thereby defusing the possibility of a clash with Cuban troops in the region. 
Defense Minister P. W. Both a said the withdrawal of between 
3.000 andS,OOO troopsguarding the multimillion-dollar Cunene river hydroelectric and irrigation project was taking place following A.1golan guarantees to protect South Afri­ca's border interests. 
His statement confirmed a gov­ernment announcement over the weekend that South African troops would get out ot Angola once the government was convinced the guarantees would hold. 
It also came on the eve of a debate at the United nations in which South Africa probably would have been branded an "aggressor" in southern Angola. There are an estimated 12.000 Cuban troops in Angola.

They also said there now appears no option to a war in Rhodesia unless Prime Minister Ian Smith reverses his position and yields control to the black majority. 
A summit in Lusaka, Zambia. on the unification of the guerrilla movement in Rhodesia and the escalation of guerilla war against Rhodesia ended with a still divided African National Council. The council is the organization that attempts to speak for Rhodesia's black majority. Political talks between the council and Smith last week 
Smith, opening a new bridge in western Rhodesian town of Gwaai River, denied rumors that he had sold his farm and bought land in South Africa because of the guer­rilla threat. "You can be assured that I still have my cattle and my farm and that I own no land outside Rhodes:a and that I have no intention of leaving Rhodesia," he said.

Picks 
It's the long awaited bicentennial year and the city of Philadelphia is the focal point of the nation. Any event worth having will be held in Philadelphia this year, and the NCAA basketball tournament is no exception. 
While there haven't been any major upsets, which is an upset in itself, the tournament has been interesting and unique in its own way. When Michigan (24-6) tackles Rutgers (31-0) and Indiana (30-0) meets UCLA (26-4) tomorrow afternoon, it will mark the first time in the history of the national tournament that two undefeated clubs have advanced to the final four and the first time that two teams from the same conference have reached the national semi-finals. 
Only twice before have two undefeated teams entered the tournament in the same year. In 1971 Marquette and Penn fielded unbeaten squads only to be eliminated in regional play. St. Bonaventure and Houston entered the tournament with unblemished records in 1968, but St. Bonaventure was beaten in regional play while Houston was beaten by UCLA in the national semi-finals. 
Rutgers and Indiana are hoping to become the seventh team in history to go undefeated and win the national title. UCLA managed the feat four times and San Francisco and North Carolina each did it once. Nine teams have entered the tournament undefeated only to be beaten in tournament play, with Indiana being the most recent, doing it last season. 
So with only four of the 32 teams that entered the tournament remaining, here are The Irish Eye picks in tomorrow's semi-final games and for the national championship on Monday night. 
Michigan vs Rutgers: For those fans who enjoy "run and gun" basketball this is a dream game. With Ricky Green leading the attack, Michigan races up and down the court at breakneck speed. The only team in the nation that can match the Wolverines' overall speed is Rutgers. The tilt should be a match of speed, quickness and shooting that if nothing else should delight fans. 
Phil Sellers is the big name for Rutgers, but he's far from being the only player on the Scarlet Knight's club. Hollis Copeland, Jim Bailey, Abdel Anderson, Ed Jordan and underrated Mike Dabney are all excellent ball players. Rutgers has been criticized for playing a weak schedule and many feel that their undefeated record is a fluke, but as Coach Tom Young says, "People ask who we've beaten, and I tell them 'Everyone we've played baby, everyone.· How many other teams can say that?" 
Sellers hasn't had a good game (a good game for Phil Sellers) in the tournament yet, and he's due to explode. But the key to the tilt is the Green -Dabney matchup. Green 's a super player; he's quick, fast and can shoot with the best of them. But Dabney is a ball player to be reckoned with. Those who haven't seen Mike Dabney will go away impressed. Look for Dabney to take Green . and look for Rutgers to take Michigan by four. 
Indiana vs UCLA: A rematch of the game that opened the season in St. Louis in November. In that one the Hoosiers came out burning and destroyed the Bruins. Four months and 30 games later the two teams that started the season are ready to do battle in a game that many feel will determine the national championship. 
Gene Bartow's Bruins have a new look since their earlier loss to Indiana. Clumsy Ralph Drollinger has departed from the UCLA lineup and has been replaced by freshman David Greenwood. Since Greenwood has moved into the lineup, the Bruins have won 12 of their last 13. Another starter to enter the lineup since the loss to the Hoosiers is Ray Townsend, 
.. 
a quick little guard with a deadly shot. Richard Washington, MVP is last season's tournament, is back again and figures to be a dominant force. UCLA has improved vastly since the early part of the season and are just now reaching their peak. 
The officials will be keys in tomorrow's game. If the men in striped <>hirts let Benson act like the animal he is, Indiana will be tough to beat. But if Benson and his Hoosier teammates are forced to play basketball they could be in for a long afternoon. 
UCLA needs to win the remaining two games to avoid its worst record in I 0 years. The Bruins have won an amazing 47 of their last 48 NCAA tournament games, losing only a double overtime thriller to David Thompson two years ago. Look for the Bruins to make it 48 of 49 and Bobby Knight to kill Jimmy Wisman. UCLA by six. 
1976 NCAA Champion: UCLA has the tournament experience that so often tells in big games. The Bruins have won all 10 championship games that they've played in. Monday night they'll be 11 for 11. 
best pitcher, there were only 40 strikeouts in nine games. and that only seven of these were called strikeouts. 
"In both of those last games we were playing very good baseball, and if we maintain that I think we'll do very well the rest of the season," Kelly said. 
Considering their opposition and their grueling schedule, the Irish must play very well indeed. Start­ing with their home opener on April 4 against Northern Illinois, they must play 36 games in 31 days. They must face teams from the Big Ten and the Mid-American Confer­ence, which Kelly considers the best conferences in the area. They must also play some of the better independent schools in the area, such as the University of Detroit and the University of Cincinnati. 
Kelly feels that the long layoff 
between the spring trip and the 
season opener is a mixed blessing. 
"From one standpoint we're taking 
a chance with the weather," said 
Kelly, referring to South Bend's 
unpredicable weather. "But from 
the other side we get a chance to 
practice and sharpen up on our 
weaknesses." 
Whatever the future holds for 
the Irish ballplayers this season, 
Kelly is happy that he'll be a part of 
it. "I've been fortunate that I've 
got a good bunch of players to work 
with," said Kelly. "Everybody's 
really responded well this spring." 
"That's what coaching is a1l about,'' said Kelly, ''working with young people who want to work and to win." 
Lacrosse Club 
sweeps foes 

on Florida trip 
by Tom Bingle 

The warmth of the Florida sun 
proved beneficial to the Notre 
Dame Lacrosse Club, as the stick­
men handily defeated their oppon­
ent& on three occasions during their 
annual pilgrimage to the Sunshine 
State. 
In the opening game of the 
season, the Irish were pitted 
against their toughest competition 
of the southern swing, the Univer­
sity of Miami. The Hurricanes, the 
defending Southern Florida La­
crosse Conference Cham pions, 
brought an impressive record of 9-1 
into the contest and were aiming to 
pin a loss on the Irish. 
But the Irish would have nothing 

to do with the Hurricane hopes, as 
the stickmen scored a convincing 
11-7 victory. Pacing the Irish 
offensively was Club President Bob 
Thibodeau, who pumped in 5 goals. 
In a supporting role, co-captain 
Don Trabert and attackmen Pat 
Clynes added 2 goals each, while 
Jay Williams and Tim Walsh 
garned single tallies. 
Propelled by this boosting tri­

umph, the Irish went on to defeat 
Florida International University the 
following day, 11-6. Clynes and 
Trabert took over the scoring reins 
as they scored 4 and 3 goals 
respectively. Thibodeau main­
tained his scoring rampage with 2 
markers, while midfielders Mike 
Kinsella and Thad Naquin, on 
blistering shots, collected single 
goals. 
In the final game, the stickmen 

had to rally in the second half in 
order to overcome a stubborn St. 
Michael's of Vermont team, S-2. 
Balancing scoring was the Irish's 
forte in this game, as five different 
players netted goals. Those break­
ing into the scoring colummn for 
the first time included Mark Flan­
agan, J.P. Marchand and Jim Rice, 
while Jay Williams and Pat Clynes 
supplemented their earlier totals. 
The victories could not have been 
realized without the expertise 
play of the defense. Co-captain John Fatti, Mark Carberry, Chris Bowe, John Mandico, and goalie Steve Martinez all performed well for the "forgotten heroes," as they · held the opponents to a mere five 
goals per game.

I've seen the Hoosiers three times in person; against the Irish in a 
thriller, and against St. John's r.vice; once in a thriller before the largest 
crowd ever to witness r. college basketball game in Madison Square 
Garden, and in the opening round of the Mideast Regional here at Notre 
Dame, which the Hoosiers won in a rout. I've seen them on TV four times, 
all close games; one against UCLA an easy eai-Iy-season win, two against 
Purdue, both close wins, and a nip-and-tuck overtime victory over 
Kentucky. I've heard them on the radio, I've heard the results of their 
games broadcast over the loudspeaker at other games. I've even read 
"The Hoosiers are Number One" written on the wall of the men's room 
in the South Bend bus station. 
The men's room may be a fitting place for anything from Indiana, but it 
also shows just how widespread the Hoosier fame is. And many 
reluctantly admit now that Bobby Knight's crew has more than earned it's 
number one status. They've beaten everyone you could ask them too, and 
now people are asking them to beat teams again, UCLA and maybe 
Michigan, for example. 

Before the Mideast Regional the Hoosiers had barely earned their 
build-up. 'J.'hey had made a habit of escaping from a series of extremely 
close calls. Losing coaches came away muttering "they're human, they're 
not invincible, they can be beaten." Meanwile, they received the most 
press East of Patty Hearst. During the New York Christmas Tournament 
Indiana made headlines in all the area newspapers each day. They were 
made out to be indestructible gladiators. "Whoever scheduled us against 
Indiana,'' said Columbia coach Tom Penders, whose team had to meet the 
Hoosiers in the opener of that tournament, "must be the same guys that 
scheduled Custer against the Indians." As another coach said, "if 
someone beats them there should be an investigation." 
If someone does, maybe there will be. But don't count on someone 
beating them. I was one of the ones waiting for someone to come out on 
top in one of those Hoosier thrillers, but nobody did it. And that despite 
some unforgettable opportunities, such as when Kent Benson saved IU 
with no time on the clock against Michigan. They do it every time, and 
there's no reason to think they'll stop now. There isn't a team as tough in 
the clutch as Indiana is. 

After thirty games I'm ready to believe that if the Hoosiers are in the 
game in the waning moments, they'll win it. Mostly because of Scott May 
who though he isn't the individual athlete that Adrian Dantley is, is 
certainly more valuable to his team than any player in the tournament so 
far. But the impressive thing about Indiana is that they'll beat you with 
May on the bench, or with Benson on the bench. They beat you with 
defense, and they beat you physically. They beat Marquette with all of 
these. 

The guy who pulls all the switches is Knight, as good at coaching as the 
Hoosiers are at playing. He had AI McGuire outcoached at the opening 
tip-off, and he has the edge in Philly: 
I hate to give credit to anything from Indiana, but they have the best 
team and they deserve it. When you look at their schedule-St. John's, 
Alabama, Marquette, UCLA, and then Michigan or Rutgers-you say "no 
way." But take each game one by one and the Hoosiers are the favorite in 
each one. They'll beat UCLA in a much closer game than their last 
meeting (but then, IU excels in close games), and then they'll beat 
Michigan in an all Big Ten final. The worst part about it is having to listen 
to the natives boast of their team, but then, what else does the state have.

_The Irish, meanwhile, must wait patiently again. One has to feel for D1gger Phelps, who must be wondering just what he has to do to, how good a team he has to have, to reach the final four. In his del'ense, he made no outstanding errors in Louisville. You can't fault strategy when turnovers and errors prevent us from ever seeing that strategy. 
A lot depends on the big forward, Adrian Dantley. Because if Dantley came back, and Bill Laimbeer was back in the lineup, and ND picked up a couple good freshman, where would you rate the Irish. There's always 
hope. But for now everyone has to sit back and watch the best, which the final four in Philly may or may not be. Only the Hoosiers are sure.
