University creates new vehicle pool 
. System attempts to change off-campus transportation 
By TERESA FRALISH 
Assistant News Editor 
In an attempt to provide more ser­
vices and increase usage among stu­
dents and staff, the University has 
created a new vehicle motor pool 
over the summer as part of the 
Transportation Services department. 
"This is an honest attempt to address some long-standing con­cerns about providing safer and more reliable vehicles for all users of University vehicles," said Jim Paladino, associate director for pro­gram and resource administration at the Center for Social Concerns. 
The new motor pool, which was created at the start of this school year, transferred all of the vehicles, including cars, minivans and 12 pas­senger vans, owned by the CSC to the new pool under the control of Transportation Services. 
Any Notre Dame student or staff member now has the option to request use of Transportation Services vehicles for University busi­ness. Groups or departments on campus can now rent vehicles at the rate of $35 per day for a mid-size car and $50 per day for a van, a cost that officials feel is fair compared to other car rental services. 
"The price is extremely competi­tive. [and] the vehicles are clean and ready to provide safe and reliable transportation," said Marty Ogren, manager of Transportation Services. 
While some of the older vehicles previously in the CSC's vehicle pool were removed from service, the University also purchased new vehi­cles to add to the motor pool and has access to others as well. 
"We have 12 University-owned vehicles available for rental," said Ogren. "In addition we have on-site vehicles from a local car agency." 
The campus department most affected by the new system has been the CSC and the large number of service groups and comm unity­based learning classes and seminars operated through the Center. While 
schedulers at Transportation 
Services have been able to accom­
modate most of the CSC's vehicle 
needs, the CSC must now pay a 
rental fee for vehicles it previously 
owned. "The long term cost issues 
are a huge concern for the CSC," 
said Paladino. "The University has 
been good about making this first 
year somewhat affordable." 
In addition to increased budget 

costs, other groups have been affect­
ed by the new definition of which 
clubs are permitted to able to use 
vehicles at no cost through the CSC. 
"The Center has needed to be 

more discriminating in its definition 
of what constitutes service ... activi­
ties," said Paladino. "[It's] difficult to 
inexpensively accommodate some 
social justice activities where stu­
dents would routinely be able to use 
a few vans at no cost ... now must 
raise funds." 
Last year, administrators recog-/ nized the need to centralize all the vehicles owned by various depart­ments of the University and stream­line the process of using them. Over the summer, a committee worked to determine the best way to organize a new vehicle system. 
"They recommended that we could best use our vehicles by mak­ing tern available to multiple groups of users rather than have vehicles dedicated to one group," said Ogren. "While we realize that certain departments need dedicated vehi­cles, the goal is to use our University vehicles in the most efficient manner possible. 
Overall, students using vehicles through the new system say the changes are welcome. "The cars are in a lot better condition," said Molly Savage, president of Circle K. Savage said the CSC has been help­ful in allowing Circle K to request vehicles centrally through the club so that members do have to obtain vehicles individually. 
Danita Altfillisch, secretary of the Special Friends Club, said the new motor pool has helped to streamline the process of using vehicles for ser­vice activities. "It's easier than it has been," she said

TRICK OR TREAT 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Editor 

After seven months of planning, the first cable access show produced by Notre Dame students will air this evening. 
The show. titled "New Dimensions Television," will fill Channel 3's 5 p.m. time slot with five segments intended to appeal to Notre Dame students and the South Bend community. 
The segments include an interview with head football coach Tyrone Willingham, a spotlight on the Notre Dame Marching Band, a news segment on the Senate race between Republican Chris Chocola and Democrat Jill Long Thompson, a short polit­ical film produced by senior Brian Bircher and a roaming reporter segment that inter­views people tailgating during the Stanford football game. 
Bircher, who also conducted the interview segment with Willingham, said he antici­pates that he and other interviewers will 
talk with a wide range of people on campus. "We hope to keep it interesting and excit­ing throughout the year," he said. 
After the first round of production, Chamberland said the show is ready to air, but the process to get to this point was chal­lenging. 
"It was sort of like walking through a very large room with the lights off," he said. 
NDTV's four executive producer are senior Alex Grunewald, juniors Liam Dacey and Lance Johnson and sophomore Chris Chamberland. They, and the 50 to 60 stu­dents who are also helping with the show, are hoping that NDTV becomes popular with students. 
Even more importantly however, the NDTV producers, whose show is currently unaffiliated with the University, want to become a Notre Dame student-broadcasting club and get more funding. 
Chamberland said much of the show's

INSIDE COLUMN 
Be thankful your vote counts 
In less than one week, millions of Americans will go to polls across the country to elect the 108th Congress and hundreds of other state and local offi­
cials.  
The week before Notre Dame and  Teresa Frallsh  
Saint Mary's went  
on fall break, mil­ Assistant  
lions of Iraqis also  News Editor  
went to the polls.  
But the elections in  

this backwards country were somehow very different than next week's American election will be. 
The ballot looked somewhat like this: "Saddam Hussein" was printed at the top, and then voters had the option of checking "yes" or "no." Surprisingly enough, the incumbent Iraqi president (or corrupt authoritarian dictator, as some might call him) was re-elected by 100 percent of voters with 98.2 percent of Iraq's electorate participating. 
Of course, voting is compulsory for all males over the age of 18. One also has to wonder how many of that 1.8 percent haven't suddenly disappeared from their homes. Obviously these elections were completely rigged and totally unfair by anyone's standard. 100 percent support? I'm willing to bet there were armed guards waiting outside the voting booths for any Iraqi who dared to vote "no" on their ballot. Or the government may just have simplified matters by not even both­ering to look at the ballots at all and sim­ply declaring that voters gave Saddam 100 percent support. 
Notice the difference between the American elections and the Iraqi sham of an election? 
Contrasts like these are precisely what make it so difficult to listen to people who like to characterize the United States as "imperialistic," "oppressive," "exploitative" or any of the other fun adjectives the pundits are throwing around lately. 
Why is it that we can so easily forget and seem to take so much for granted all the freedoms that the American system of government allows us? Frankly, I'm sick and tired of hearing all the outra­geous criticism that's been leveled at our country in the last few weeks. 
Sure, America has had its share of bad leaders and poor decisions. The last presidential election was a prime exam­ple of the electoral process gone serious­ly wrong. Maybe the United States shouldn't become involved militarily in Iraq. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not an arbi­trary supporter ofany action the U.S. government wants to take and I think open political debate is one of the most important freedoms American citizens have. 
But when you criticize your country. don't forget about the millions of people in the world who can't say a word against theirs. Don't forget that you live in one of the freest countries in the world. Be thankful that, when you go to cast your vote next week, you will likely see more than one candidate on the ballot and you probably won't have to confront armed guards outside the voting booth.

In an effort to educate Saint 
Mary's students about the dan­
gers of alcohol and the policies 
of the College, the Residence 
Hall Association organized a 
week of alcohol awareness 
events. 
The College has sponsored 
alcohol awareness events in the 
past but it had been several 
years since students have orga­
nized events for themselves. 
"This is the first year it has 
been done in awhile, but with 
all the alcohol problems on 
campus and the changes in 
Notre Dame's policy, we though 
this was needed," RHA presi­
dent Jillian Kamaski said. 
Saint Mary's alcohol policy is that anyone 21 or older may consume alcohol in their dorm room, but anyone under the age of 21 is not allowed to be present if alcohol is in the room. Students are allowed to drink alcohol in their rooms only if they do not disturb other dorm residents. When alcohol is present, room residents and guests must be prepared to present proof of their age. 
Saint Mary's students visiting Notre Dame or Holy Cross College must adhere to the poli­cies of the institution they are visiting. Information on Notre Dame policy violations is shared with the Saint Mary's judicial coordinator, who han­
dies investigation of any viola­
tions. 
One of the purposes of the 

awareness week is to make 
sure that students of legal age 
remember that this does not 
give them the right to abuse the 
privilege of being able to drink 
on campus, but to be conscious 
oftheir decisions. 
"There are a lot of people who have gotten in trouble for drinking, because many stu­dents don't know the drinking policies," RHA health aware­ness chair Lauren Hofer said. "They think that because they're 21 they can do whatev­er they want. but that's not true." 
Today in the dining hall. RHA will have Fatal Vision Goggles available for students to try on. The goggles stimulate what it feels like to be intoxicated and then a series of sobriety tests will be given. 
Students who participate in the designated driver bracelet program on Friday or Saturday night will be entered into a raf­fle. 
On Sunday, RHA will finish the awareness week at 7 p.m. in Carrol Auditorium, with the movie "28 Days," followed by an open discussion on Saint Mary's alcohol policies. 
Saint Mary's policies regard­ing alcohol can be found in the student handbook.

ISRAEL 
Resignations cause Israeli coalition government's fall 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's broad­based coalition collapsed Wednesday when Cabinet ministers from the moder­ate Labor Party resigned in a dispute over funding for Jewish settlements, threatening to push Israel into a bitter election. 
The crisis ended an uneasy 20-month "unity government" formed as a com­mon front against the Palestinian upris­ing, and could sabotage U.S. efforts to win support for a peace plan. 
Sharon told parliament he would con­tinue to lead the country, suggesting he would try to govern with a narrow coali­tion of far-right and religious parties rather than call early elections. 
The crisis was precipitated by Sharon's rejection of Labor Party leader Binyamin Ben-Eliezer's demands to cut $145 million in funds for Jewish settle­ments in the $57 billion 2003 state bud­get. Compromise proposals failed and Ben-Eliezer resigned from his post as defense minister, followed by the rest of Labor's Cabinet ministers. 
Under Israeli law, the six resigna­tions only take effect within 48 hours, leaving room for last-ditch maneuvers -but politicians from both sides pre­dicted Sharon's broad-based coalition was at an end. 

"We must fight terror, but this is the day when we have to present a diplo­matic horizon," Ben-Eliezer said, refer­ring to peace talks with the Palestinians. "The prime minister is unable to present a diplomatic horizon." 
Critics accused Ben-Eliezer of partisan politics, noting that in polls ahead of Labor's Nov. 19 leadership primary he trails two more dovish challengers, and leaving the government over a settle­ment dispute could boost his standing. 
"It's the height of irresponsibility," said Education Minister Limor Livnat of Sharon's Llkud Party. 
The budget was put to parliament after the Labor ministers resigned, and it passed with the support of parties out­side the coalition -as expected -by a 67-45 vote; it must pass two more read­ings in coming weeks before it is final. 
Several officials involved in the last­minute talks said Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who led Labor for much of the past two decades and has been a key supporter of the unity government, tried to persuade Ben-Eliezer to back down. Peres then resigned along with Ben-Eliezer and four other Labor Party ministers.

The Republican gov­ernor was confronted during a campaign stop by Rep Carrie Meek, D-Fla., who said the Haitians should be treated like Cuban immigrants. 
Oklahoma teen faces murder charge: 
An Oklahoma teenager was charged with murder Wednesday for a shooting rampage last weekend that left two women dead and eight people wounded. Daniel Fears, 18, did not speak during his arraignment and the court entered an inno­cent plea for him. Authorities say Fears began shooting Saturday evening after a neighbor chas­tised him for driving recklessly near small chil­dren. 
Powell strict with UN on U.S. Iraq policy: 
As U.N. deliberations on Iraq dragged on, Secretary of State Colin Powell decJared Wednesday the United States would not permit itself to be "hand­cuffed" by the world organization. "At no time will the United States foreclose its ability to act in its interest in accordance with its constitutional obliga­tion to protect the nation and protect the people," Powell said. 
Further questioning of snipers stopped: 
Questioning of the two sniper suspects was halted when federal agents took custody of the pair, possibly preventing investigators from obtaining information about the shooting spree, a local law enforcement source complained Wednesday. Maryland U.S. Attorney Thomas DiBiagio disputed that, saying nei­ther suspect was "yielding any useful information." He also said federal law required they be taken before a federal magistrate once they asked for a lawyer.

Horrifying scenes like this are all too common in today's wars, for several reasons, Becker said. "Children are vulnerable. easy targets for recruiters," she added. In addition, children are more likely to follow orders without question, even to the point of committing atrocities. In some instances, "children were forced to participate in the massacre of villagers and the destruction of villages." Becker said. Becker also attributed the increase in child soldiers to the changing nature of war. Modern wars are more likely to be within nations, rather than between them, "blurring the line between civilians and combat­ants," she said. 
The Children's Rights Project has focused on helping to change international law to protect children from compul­sory military service. While the Geneva Conventions state that the minimum age for par­ticipation in combat is 15, Becker's organization suc­cessfully lobbied the United Nations to draft a treaty declaring that no one under 18 should be forced to fight.

International students seek voice 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
Connie Peterson Miller, assistant director for international student services, spoke at Wednesday's senate meeting about the role of international students at Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame hosts over 1000 sru­dents from about 100 countries. Only a fourth of these students are undergraduates. Miller said these students bring a mix ofdiverse cul­tures to Notre Dame, increasing the campus' overall quality of life. 
The International Student Services office seeks to serve inter­national students, scholars and their families, said Miller. The office sponsors various programs to ease the students' transitions such as Conversation Circles/Writing Labs and Conversation Exchange Partners, which strengthen their grasp ofthe English language, said Miller. 

International students wish to seek representation on campus and familiarize themselves with the culture. "They want to know the thrill, chills and spills of the American culture such as how to get a driver's license," said Miller. 
Many of these students strive to maintain and display their own culture while they are here on campus. Miller said many interna­tional students come to the office

"Law, Human Rights and Children in Armed Conflict," focused on remedies for this modern phenomenon. 
According to Becker, some 300,000 children under age 18 are recruited, many by force, to fight for governments and rebel groups in countries like Sierra Leone, the Congo, Burma and Colombia. Becker told the story of one particu­lar child, a Ugandan girl named Charlotte, who was kidnapped from her boarding 
domestically to lobby Congress for policy change. The group aims to convince lawmakers to withhold for­eign aid from governments who fail to ban the use of child fighters. HRW recently convinced legislators to ear­mark $3 million in Colombian aid for the "counseling and reintegration of former child soldiers," Becker said. She also hailed the Democratic caucus in Congress as "more interested [than Republicans]

IN BRIEF 
Boeing decides to layoff employees 
Boeing Co.'s Shared Services division, which 
handles computing, telecommunications, 
building maintenance and other in-house jobs 
for the aerospace company, plans to cut 1,200 
to 1,500 jobs in the next six months. 
The cuts, which will come through layoffs, attrition and eliminating contract workers, amount to nearly 9 percent of the Bellevue­based division's work force, spokeswoman Barbara Murphy said \Vednesday. Most of the unit's employees work in the Puget Sound region. 
The reductions come on top of the 30,000 jobs that Boeing plans to eliminate by the end of 2002 due to slashed commercial jet pro­duction and the weak airline market since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Boeing chairman Phil Condit said earlier this month that Boeing will continue to reduce its work force over the next 18 months, but the company has not released a target figure. 
Groups try to block WorldCom bids 
Nine labor and advocacy groups have unit­ed in an attempt to block WorldCom Inc. from winning future government contracts. 
The groups sent a letter to the General Services Administration Wednesday urging the government to suspend WorldCom from bidding on federal contracts. 
"WorldCom's behavior has harmed both the telecommunication sector and the larger U.S. economy and it should be punished for its actions." the letter said. 
Enron raises $3.3 million in auction 
Enron Corp. raised $3.3. million with its two-day auction to help pay off creditors. 
The bankrupt former giant energy trader will hold another auction in December, fea­turing items similar to the 10,000-plus arti­cles auctioned during the initial sale, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Wednesday. Proceeds will be placed in an escrow account for distribution to creditors.

The Finance Club of

Although Lee Svete from

to set up some of the meet­

President Tom Kolinski, a

"I think that this [the trip] provides more experi­ence to members in a week in New York and Chicago than most clubs could provide in a year of weekly meetings at Notre Dame," Kolinski said. 
Senior Grant Kreizenbec agrees, "It was great expo­sure to see finance in the real world rather than just from a book."

HAITI 
Haiti turns to spirits for help in crisis 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRJNCE 

Shaking bundles of pungent leaves and swaying to a frenzied drum beat, hundreds of Haitians flock to a temple to beg the spir­its for U.S. visas and lucky lot­tery numbers. 
At a time of deepening poverty and despair, many people in this Caribbean country see only one way out. 
"Voodoo is Haiti's only hope," says Solange Patrice, a 19-year­ol d street vendor who took Wednesday off to make meager offerings of coins and candles at a voodoo temple. "We have willing to risk your life to make it to the United States." 
On Tuesday, more than 200 Haitians did just that, jumping from a ship that ran aground in Miami with the Coast Guard in pursuit. 
The journey was one of hun­dreds each year by Haitians who brave the sea in rickety, over­crowded boats. Dozens have died in such attempts this year. And unlike Cubans who reach dry land, Haitian migrants usu­ally are returned home. 
"We are all desperate," said Marie Pierre, a 35-year-old ven­dor in Port-au-Prince's chaotic marketplace who sells leaves, candles and moonshine as offer­
The government blames the situation on the lack of interna­tional aid, suspended after the Lavalas Family party of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide swept flawed elections in 2000. Two years later, the country is locked in a political stalemate. Two-thirds of work­ers are unemployed and crime is on the rise. 
Until foreign aid is restored, people will continue to flee to 
U.S. shores, said government spokesman Mario Dupuy. 
But even in the best of times, Haiti is a country of scant resources, with much of its arable land ravaged by decades of deforestation. 

several hooks on the religion that evolved in the 17th century when the French brought slaves to Haiti. "When people feel abandoned, that desperation manifests itself in voodoo." 
On Tuesday at the Desermite temple, songs asking the gods for U.S. visas and lucky lottery numbers reverberated against the concrete blocks as believers stomped their feet. Some fell to the ground, believing they were possessed. 
"Open the door for us if it is closed!" worshippers wearing brightly colored satin scarves sang in Creole as they waved white candles. 
Practitioners believe in a 
voodoo priest or houngan. "Even though they don't have much to give me or the spirits, we will keep praying. We have to." 
Voodoo, or Voudou, as prefer­rd by Haitians, only became rec­ognized as a formal religion in 1987, under a new constitution that recognizes the rights of all religions. But this fusion of West African beliefs has long been seen as a path toward emanci­pation. 
In ·1791, an escaped slave named Boukman gathered thou­sands of followers in the forests of northern Haiti and sacrificed a wild boar. He pledged that with the spirits' help, he would

In 1966, Holy Cross College opened with a handful of students and a mission. The mission was to provic!e a personal, caring, educational environment that would prepare students to transfer successfully to the four-year institution of their choice. 
Holy Cross College now has over 500 students, a residence life program and an ever-increasing selection of course offerings, amenities and social opportunities. But no matter how much we grow, we will never lose sight of our fundamental mission. Every year, our students develop the skills necessary to transfer to outstanding colleges and universities like Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Indiana University and scores of other fine four-year institutions. 
Our mission is what has made us successful. So while many things change, our mission is one thing that will not.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Advocate a just wage for workers 
It was with considerable disgust that I read John Litle's Oct. 18 column, "Workers have one right." Particularly appalling was Litle's generalization of low-wage workers as disloyal employees underpaid because of their inability to maintain steady employment. That Litle must resort to such senseless stereotyping is indicative of a frightening ignorance of the real­ities of low-wage employment in this country. 
Had Litle taken the time to actually speak with employees prior to tackling the issue of workers' rights, his outlook would, one hopes, be far different. This very campus could have pro­vided him ample opportunity to pursue this interaction. Every day hundreds of underpaid men and women labor to create the environment we too often take for granted at Notre Dame. 
Whether it be by maintaining our beautiful grounds or by preparing meals in the dining halls, these dedicated individuals daily contribute to our college experience and should be con­sidered our brothers and sisters in the Notre Dame family. Yet. in spite of this, many Notre Dame employees earn hourly wages well below what would be required to rise above the poverty line. Is it just that the employees of a Catholic universi­ty can work full time and still remain unable to fully support themselves and their families? It is with this thought in mind that I ask all members of our campus community to demon­strate support for Notre Dame workers. We should all take the time to share with them our appreciation for all that they do and our willingness to stand with them in the fight for better working conditions.

So I'm graduating in December. "Why?" you all cry, aghast at the idea that any human being in their right mind would ever choose to leave Notre Dame before they were dragged kick­ing and screaming away. 
There are a number of reasons for this choice. One of the big ones is that it will save my father a chunk of money. Another is that it will give me some time off before graduate school. 
The main reason, however, is that at the age of 21, I have lost all drive and ambition. My greatest desire six days out of seven is to spend the entire day on my couch and never change out of my pajamas. On the seventh day, I want to go to a Notre Dame football game. That's it. I don't want to go to graduate school. I don't want to become a wildly rich or fantastically successful psychotherapist. I don't want to go to class or work or even out for coffee. 
People keep asking me what I am doing next year. I have this nice story about wanting to get a Ph.D. and go on to be either a therapist or an academic. In all honesty, I can't think of anything I want to do less than go to school for five more years. unless it's go out and get a job. 

The idea of doing one thing for the rest of my life boggles my mind. I've been doing this education thing for my entire life so far, and I'm pretty well sick of that. I don't want to do it any­more. I also don't want to do something else. I want to do nothing. 
I mean, look at what real life has to offer. I'll go to grad school, and my 
parents will stop giving me money on a regular basis. I will accrue more student loans, which people will want me to pay back at some point, along with the $25,000 I already owe for my Notre Dame education. 
I will eventually buy a house, and someone will expect me to pay a mortgage for 20 years. I will take out a second mortgage after 18 years to pay for my kids' college educations at Notre Dame, and someone else will expect me to pay that back for another 20 years. 
In the meantime, I'll marry some guy who seems great until he leaves our reception early to play PlayStation. Next come the kids, which will involve teething, colic and poopy diapers. They will get older. and I will panic constant­ly about them. Where are they? Are they being raped or murdered? What was that substance they just ingested? 
They'll go off to college; I'll be left with my spouse, to whom I haven't said a full sentence since the kids were born. We'll find that not only do we have nothing left in common, we also can't remember who we are, either. We'll take up sleeping 14 hours a day for lack of anything else to do. 
Being good Catholics, we'll stay mar­ried and continue our lives of non­speaking. telling ourselves it's a com­fortable silence. My kids will never come home, except to hit me up for money. and I will have new sympathy for my parents. 
Speaking of my parents, they'll be ready to go into nursing homes at this point. As they are divorced, I may have 
upwards of four parents to take care 
of. They'll suck up money like morphine, leaving me a measly $5.23 to 
inherit, before taxes, which I'll spend on my kids anyway. 
My spouse and I will finally pay off our house, only to 
realize it's too big for us. We'll move to a smaller apart­ment and retire, plan­ning to travel. Instead. both of us will be struck by 

cancer, that disease that kills you if nothing else does first. The kids will put us in homes and we'll die there. Alone. 
So that's what I have to look forward to in life. None of that looks that great to me. I'm not sure the real world is all it's cracked up to be. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's not. Why would I want to do this? Why would I willingly take the necessary steps? \Vhy would I not just live on my couch? · 
Seriously, I want to know.

Irish are lucky in just one way Willingham 
All those announcers and "so-called" expert college football analysts like ESPN's Kirk "Herbie" Herbstreit are right -Notre Dame is lucky. 
No, rm not talking about Notre Dame's undefeated 8-0 record. Notre Dame really is that good. But don't take it from me. After all, I'm just a lowly college sports writer for The Observer, who cer­tainly does not have the same insightful wisdom as college football gurus like Herbie, who com-· mented this week in his column on ESPN.com, "[Notre Dame] was fortu­nate to catch some breaks over its first six games." 
I certainly do not have the same extensive knowledge of the game as Herbie's fellow ESPN columnist, ex­Pittsburgh head coach Mike Gottfried, who predicted Notre Dame's "string would end this weekend against Florida State. In my opinion, Notre Dame is not even in the same ballpark as Oklahoma and Miami." 
Is that so Mike? Hmmm. The Irish crushed the 'Noles 34-24 on the road last Saturday. Had it not been for a few garbage touchdowns at the end of the game, the Irish would have won the game by a whopping 24 points. 
But I guess it wasn't luck. Mike, when Miami needed Florida State kick­er Xavier Beitia's last-second 41-yard field goal to sail wide-left in order to squeak out a one-point victory at home. I guess ifs not worth mention­ing that FSU had a week off to prepare for Notre Dame, either. 

I certainly don't have the same abili­ty to predict the future like those odds­makers in Vegas either. After all, they only picked the Noles as a ridiculous 
10.5 point favorite over the Irish. 
On second thought, maybe you shouldn't take it from the experts or odds-makers either. Just take it from some of Notre Dame's recent oppo­nents. Just ask Florida State running back Greg Jones or Air Force quarter­back Chance Harridge how tough Notre Dame's defense is. Or better yet, why don't you ask the Air Force defen­sive line or the Florida State secondary if Notre Dame's offense is really as anemic as Herbie and the rest of his buddies claim it is? 
Back to my original point -I am not really a superstitious guy. I rarely read my horoscope, but I will be the first to admit that Notre Dame is lucky for one reason and one reason only. The Irish are lucky to have Tyrone Willingham as their head coach. Call it fate or divine intervention, but had it not been for the George O'Leary resume fiasco last December, Tyrone Willingham would still be the head coach at Stanford and Notre Dame would not be undefeated right now. 
Even if Notre Dame were to lose the rest of their games this year, Notre Dame is lucky to have Willingham as 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Terming Saddam 'huggable' reveals an utter lack of taste 
I am deeply offended by Joe Muto's Oct. 30 column, "Questioning presi­dent's leadership on action in Iraq." Muto has chosen to express his opinion on the probable war with Iraq. His defense of his position is one thing, but to declare Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "huggable," indeed. to call him a verita­ble "Clark Gable ... [who] gassed his own people," shows a complete lack of taste. His declaration of Saddam Hussein as the "most adorable" of 20th century despots simply perpetuates his ignorant, crass attitude. 
After all, how can he claim Hussein's superiority over such lovable figures as Josef Stalin? With his big fuzzy trench­coat, those goofy eyes narrowed in tyrannical madness, and oh, the mus­tache! The Yalta conference pictures convey a dictator as cuddly as Santa Claus, only I suspect that had you sat in his lap and told him what you wanted for Christmas you'd have been shot or dragged off to a camp (and shot). 
But of course, who can possibly over­look the cuddliest of the evil, Hitler? With his squat, beady eyes, over­trimmed hair and a mustache to put Stalin to shame, Hitler comes across as a sort of ceremonial teddy bear for the Third Riech. Nevermind the khakis ­let's face it, the man was always busi­ness casual. That takes chutzpah, and I think Muto isn't giving the brutal terror­izer of Europe and the murderer of mil­lions the credit he deserves. Just watch some old footage. As thousands of enraptured German soldiers gaze at their fearless leader's stomping and furious hand gestures, try to resist the urge to give ol' Adolf a big hug. Go on, just try. 
How Muto can possibly overlook these lovable dictators in favor of bland old Saddam is beyond me. Memo to Muto and Hussein: That beret is so Cuban Revolution. You'll never wear it like Che; who are you kidding? 
I do wish Muto hadn't restricted the field to dictators of the last century, though. After all, where can you find a dreamboat despot like Julius Caesar? Women wanted him, men wanted to be him. senators wanted to kill him. Veni. vidi, vici, indeed. 
At any rate, I think it's clear that if Muto thinks he's got a finger on the pulse of world leader fashion, he's got another thing coming. Poor Saddam is in need of more than a regime change -somebody give that boy a new wardrobe.

its head coach. 

Is there anyone else you would want representing your University? Is there anyone else who handles praise with the same degree of humility as Willingham? Is there any­one else who handles the media scrutiny and the pressure of being a head­coach better than Willingham? Is there a greater class act in college football today? 
The answer to all of these questions is no. 

Before this season started, many of the "so-called" experts said Notre Dame would be lucky to have a win­ning record. Many of the pre-season magazines predicted the Irish would finish no better than 40th in the country. They all said Notre Dame did not have the talent and the personnel to com­pete for the national championship anymore. 
As it turns out, all the Irish needed was a coach who could motivate them to maximize their potential. 
It turns out the "so-called" experts 
were dead wrong, but who really cares 
about them anyway? It doesn't really 
matter that the "so-called" experts don't believe in us. Willingham believes in his players, and his players believe in them­selves. There's nothing lucky about that. One other 
thing-I never really believed in 
destiny before this season, but I do now. The Irish certain­ly are not 
lucky to be 8­0, but I think I speak on 
behalf of the entire student body when I write that we are all lucky to attend this University during Notre Dame's "Return 

to Glory." Thanks guys. It truly has been a privilege and a joy to cheer for you every Saturday.

Football team represents University with class 
Saturday, I was reminded why I love Notre Dame football, and perhaps even Notre Dame itself. I was watching the game at the gym while I worked out. After one set, I walked over to the television above the exercise bikes, and my heart sank. A few Florida State players were jumping around like it was Christmas, Mardi Gras and their birthdays all rolled into one. I figured Florida State had just scored a 1O-point touchdown. Turns out one of them had just knocked down a pass, on second down. Not a real spectacular play, either. it kind of came right to him. 
Later in the game, I had another experience like that I finished a set, came over to the television again and saw some ofthe guys in gold helmets trudging back to the huddle. Must have been a loss on the play, or a penalty. Not quite. The Notre Dame tailback had in fact just gotten a first down, running about 15 yards through a gaping hole, then plowing over some defensive backs for good measure. 
Then of course there was the delightful spectacle, right before the game ended, of the Seminole receiver spinning the ball to the ground after making a decent catch, though his team was down 24 points and less than two minutes remained. 
We may argue whether Notre Dame truly dominated Florida State in various statistical categories, or whether the score reflected more of that Irish luck we all are coming to love so much. What we cannot doubt, however. is that the men in the white jerseys totally dominated the opponent in one special area ­class. I truly wonder whether Notre Dame was able to wear down Florida State in the second half because of all the celebrating the Seminoles had done. I got tired just watching some of it, and I did not even see most ofthe first half. 
They say a team is a reflection of its coach, and when I see Tyrone Willingham, and then watch his team, I know it is true. I would say he should run for President, but I would like to keep him for Notre Dame. We should all be proud of how our team plays and represents us so well, and not just of how good they are at winning.

Scene takes a look at nine of the 
Scene Staff Report 
Each Halloween, Hollywood offers up the same formulaic "nubile sorority sisters in haunted house take sensu­ous showers and then walk into the dark basement one by one with their necks exposed" rubbish for mass con­sumption. But years after the latex vil­lain who can be shot, burnt. smashed, pureed and launched into space, and then magically reappear in front of a scantily clad heroine with supple, heaving breasts is left in the land of late-night Superstation specials, the truly terrifying movies of our day will live on. 
The Scene staff has assembled an all-star scream-a-than of nine of the most disturbing movies of all time, presented in no particular order. So, grab some rentals, grab some popcorn and grab your significant other (or a reasonable facsimile) and cuddle up as you have your mind blown. 
"The Bad Seed" (1956) 
Long before the Columbine massacre forced Americans to re-evaluate their misplaced faith in the idea that chil­dren are innocent by nature, the coun­try's cinema had already seen the dark side. "The Bad Seed" is one of those movies that elicits a horrified gasp from those who have had the misfortune to see it alone late at night. 
Based on the Maxwell Anderson's play of the same name, the 1956 movie looks like it belongs on a stage show more than the silver screen. But "The Bad Seed" doesn't need chalk­board-scratching violins or claustro­phobic camerawork to keep it audi­ence awake at nigh. Its concept is so dark and chilling, it doesn't need any sort of traditional scares. 
When a local boy dies mysteriously on a school picnic, suburban house­wife Christine Penmark goes to com­fort her picture perfect daughter Rhoda who was the boy's classmate and winner of a penmanship medal that Rhoda coveted. But Rhoda's per­turbing coolness when confronted with the issue is brought to a head when Christine discovers the penman­ship medal in her daughter's posses­sion. Slowly, Christine must question whether her sweet and innocent daughter could really be a bad seed. 
"The Bad Seed" takes a dark look at the nature versus nurture argument and asks some questions that are so horrific that the answers seem unfath­omable. 
~C. Spencer Beggs 
"Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) 
Evil has no face in Stanley Kubrik's last and most stunning film. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's provocative novel "Dream Story," "Eyes Wide Shut" fol­lows the beautiful but troubled couple, Dr. and Mrs. Harford (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman), through two nights of mystery and madness. Confronted with his wife's darker side, Dr. Harford embarks on a sexual odyssey, which takes him to the edge of Hell and back again. 
The slippery slope Harford dances upon culminates in a visit to "The House" -a place where beauty and magic are coupled with sacrifice and death and is far more chilling than 

any haunted one could 
be. 

The terror in this film is found within the liv­ing and lies always behind masks and with­in dreams. Audiences will not be able to name the thing that frightens them most in "Eyes Wide Shut," which is what makes this hlm a stylishly dis­turbing masterpiece. 
~Anne Hamilton 
"The Exorcist" (1973) 
"The Exorcist," directed by William Friedkin, is enough of a pop culture staple that it is often considered too simple or cliche to be truly disturbing. A 12-year old girl (Linda Blair) is possessed by the Devil and her dis­traught movie-star mother (Ellen Burstyn} calls a priest (Jason Miller) to save her. Cue infamous pea soup and head-spinning special effects. 
This view, however, does a great disservice to what's actually a very subtle story. "The Exorcist" bal­ances its unrelentingly horrific inten­sity with the mature acting of its stars and a veteran supporting cast includ­ing Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow. Partly because of that intensity, it is easy to miss the importance of almost every detail: the girl's passion for art, the divorce and the mysterious silver medallion. "The Exorcist" is a great film that was overrated for so long it has now become underrated. 


~Jack Watkins 

"Requiem for a Dream" (2000) 
Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" is a hauntingly beautiful look at the lives of drug addicts. Shot to reflect the mental states of its charac­ters, "Requiem for a Dream" varies between soporific ecstasy and tortur­ous agony. The movie follows the down spiral of four addicts whose sto­ries are intertwined but are not dependent upon one another. 
The disconcerting aspect of "Requiem for a Dream" is the way that it relates the desire for a high from drug addiction to the same tendency in sober life from another source. The payout is neither as big as the junkie needs nor as long as he requires. 
"Requiem for a Dream" is unsettling to the point that it makes one question whether the ideals toward which we direct our everyday efforts are ulti­mately as futile as those of the movie's characters. 
The grip Aronofsky's hypersensitive filming at once drifts the audience through a drug-induced fantasy and then slams them against a hard-edged reality. The movie is composed and plays like a symphony dedicated to the final destination of a futile life.

most unsettling movies ofall time 

could compete with Henri-Georges Clouzot, director of "Diabolique." A French film made in 19 55, "Diabolique" is in some ways a typical suspense film of its period: a slow start, gradual increase of tension, a fantastic climax and a major plot twist. 
"Diabolique" is about Michael Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), a sadistic boarding school principle who is mur­dered by his wife Christina (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress (Nicole Horner). The women dump his body in a pool. But when the pool is drained, no body is found. 
Christina becomes convinced that Michael is haunting the school and will somehow get his revenge. Is there a ghost or is it merely her guilty con­science? Vera Clouzet, the director's wife, is magnificent as a woman hav­ing a nervous breakdown, giving this suspense classic the punch to put it at the top of its genre. 
-Jack Watkins 
"Death and the Malden" (1994) 
One stormy evening, Gerardo Escobar's car breaks down. A mysteri­ous stranger {Ben Kingsley) takes him home and Gerardo invites him to sleep the night on the couch. That evening, Gerardo's wife, Paulina (Sigourney Weaver) overhears the men's conver­sation and is convinced that the man who picked up her husband is the same man who tortured and raped her while blindfolded 15 years before. She wants revenge. The only trouble is that she has never seen his face before. 
Roman Polanski's "Death and the Maiden" is a supremely elegant and 
disturbing film. Kingsley and Weaver are two brilliant actors and give some of their best-ever performanc­es. Based on the play with the same title, the film is beautifully uni­fied. The plot is cen­tered on one subject, at one location and in one night. "Death and the Maiden" is a must-see for audiences interest­ed in the darker and more complex side of humanity. 
-Anne Hamilton 
"Eraserhead" (1977) 
David Lynch's first fu-ll-length film, "Eraserhead," thrusts the viewer into a night­marish world of strange worm crea­tures, bleeding dinners and mutant babies. Made over the course of five years due to extreme budget limita tions, "Eraserhead," is not for the purveyor of blood-and-guts or spe­cial effects wizardry. Lynch relies instead on a sparse script and an 
eerie soundtrack to create a sense of 
unease that becomes terror in the cli­
max. While most horror films choose 
some kind of alien power or social 
deviant as the focal point of the hor­

ror, Lynch's targets are closer to home: he makes marriage, family and work horrifying. Parenting in particu­lar is made horrific through the agency of the sinister mutant baby. "Eraserhead" is best understood as a dream filled with Freudian imagery of death and sex. It is full of bizarre characters and seemingly inexplicable symbolism, making it a dark and uniquely disturbing film. 
-Jack Watkins 
"Walt Untll Dark" (1967) 
When Susie Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn) is given a mysterious doll by her husband with instructions to hide it, the recently blinded woman is sud­denly thrown into a sordid world of crime. What Susie doesn't know is that the doll contains within it thousands of dollars worth of heroin. Throughout the course of the day, Susie falls vic­tim to the deceptions of people trying to get back the doll. She finds that the only way to ensure her survival is to "wait until dark." 
Hepburn gives one of her most intel­ligent and beautiful performances ever. The film's use of dramatic irony is what makes it both great and terri­fying -most of what takes place is known to the audience but not to Susie. "Wait Until Dark" is a classic thriller that is sure to keep audiences on the edge of their seats until the final scene. 
-Anne Hamilton 
"Session 9" (2001) 
In a somber New England town, a team of asbestos removal experts is hired by the local government to pre­pare an abandoned state mental hos­pital for renovation. In a burst of con­fidence the team declares that they can complete the job in a week. 
The team leader, Gordon (Peter Mullan), cobbles together his crew, along with a newcomer. But, the strain of the job along with the group's injured past relationships and the dis­concerting ransacked hospital quickly leads the group to become separated and self-interested. 
Most notably, Mike (Stephen Gevedon), stumbles upon nine audio recordings of repression therapy ses­sions with a deeply disturbed young woman who has everything to do with the hospital's history. But as Mike slowly listens to the session, the atmosphere of the hospital takes a dark turn and bizarre occurrences begin. 
"Session 9" says more by using the things that are not explicit in a scene to get a reaction from the audience than clubbing them over the head with something overtly scary. The movie slowly boils over with angst, and by the end, audiences will most likely feel physically nauseated. 
Even so, most viewers will have trouble describing exactly what is so disturbing about "Session 9," but that's OK, because they probably won't want to talk about it anyway.

NBA 
Wizards lose to Raptors, Jordan misses dunk attempt 
Associated Press 
TORONTO Michael Jordan played so poorly he got laughed at. 
Morris Peterson scored 20 points and Jordan went score­less in the second half -and even missed a dunk -as the Toronto Raptors opened their season with a 74-68 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. 
Jordan. coming off the bench, scored just eight points in 25 minutes. After missing two free throws with 4:06 left, he missed a breakaway dunk as the ball clanged off the back 
rim. The crowd laughed  at  
Jordan.  who  turns  40  in  
February.  

The \,Vizards, down by 12, never recovered. 
'Tm pretty sure everybody is going to look at the one play," Jordan said. "I felt like I exploded pretty good. I got hit on the knee, but I still should have finished it. Other than that I felt good." 
Jordan finished 4-for-14 from the field. 
''I've never seen Michael miss a couple of free throws and a dunk late in the game like that. Normally, that's money in the bank," Washington coach Doug Collins said. 
The only positive for the new­1oo k Wizards, who shot just 
29 .6 percent from the field, was the play of Kwame Brown, who had a career-high 18 rebounds, 12 points and five blocks. 
"Everybody was fumbling the ball," Jordan said. "It was pret­ty ugly on both sides." 
Vince Carter had 18 points in his first game since surgery on his left knee in March. 
Peterson also had a career­high 10 rebounds for the Raptors, who also got a career­high 12 rebounds from new center Jelani McCoy. 
"I thought I did a great job on Jordan," Peterson said. 
The Wizards started the game with four new starters in their lineup, including Jerry Stackhouse, who had a team­high 19 points. Stackhouse, acquired from Detroit in exchange for Richard Hamilton, went 6-for-17 from the field. 
"There wasn't any chem­istry," Jordan said. "For us to come out in the first game and expect to have everything click­ing is kind of far-fetched." 
Carter had eight points, including an impressive fade­away jumper after spinning around his defender, as Toronto took a 18-11 lead in the first quarter with Jordan on the bench. 
Jordan entered with 3:50 left in the first quarter and immedi­ately stole Peterson's pass, but Washington didn't score on the possession because of Stackhouse's turnover. 
Stackhouse later shot an air­ball after another pass from Jordan. "We were all out of sync," Stackhouse said. 
The Wizards shot 25 percent in the first quarter as the Raptors led 20-14. 
After Jordan made his first shot of the gave early in the second, the Raptors went on a 14-0 run as Peterson scored seven points and the Wizards went almost five minutes with­out scoring. 
"We were terrible," Collins said. "Our screening was poor and our shot selection was very poor." 
Jordan scored all eight of his points in the second quarter as the Wizardscut Toronto's lead to eight at halftime. 
Trail Blazers 102, Lakers 90 
Rasheed Wallace scored 28 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a season-open­ing 102-90 victory over the shorthanded Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. 
Already playing without Shaquille O'Neal and Rick Fox, the Lakers were further hob­bled when they lost Kobe Bryant for several minutes in the first half after a hard fall. He returned and led the Lakers with 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
The Trail Blazers handed Los Angeles its second straight loss. It's the first time since 1990 the Lakers have opened a season

NBA 
Prosecutors respond to Jayson Williams' defense 
Associated Press 
FLEMINGTON, N.J. 

While cursing at a limousine driver, a drunken Jayson Williams showed off for friends by flipping closed a shotgun that killed the other man with a spray of buckshot pellets, pros­ecutors said in court documents filed Wednesday. 
Prosecutors responded to a defense motion to dismiss charges against Williams by giving the most complete pic­ture yet of what they say hap­pened at the former basketball star's mansion early Feb. 14. 
Williams, 34. is accused of recklessly handling the gun that killed Costas "Gus" Christofi and trying to make it look like a suicide. He could face nearly 45 years in prison if convicted on all charges, including first­degree manslaughter. He remains free on $270,000 bail. 
Last month, defense attorneys asked a judge to throw out the indictment, saying the prosecu­tor gave an incomplete account of what happened and biased grand jurors by repeating that Williams exercised his right to remain silent. 
Prosecutors said there was no misconduct and, unless such behavior is extreme, an other­wise valid indictment should not be dismissed. 
The judge has said he hopes to rule on motions by mid­December. 
Christofi picked up Williams' friends at a Harlem Globetrotters game in Bethlehem, Pa., buying a dis­posable camera to photograph the athletes. court documents said. 
When the party reached a restaurant, several Globetrotters invited Christofi inside, where he sat apart from Williams' friends. 
"At one point during the evening, the defendant singled out Gus and began cursing at him. The defendant's conduct was such that several of the witnesses were uncomfortable with what appeared to them to be an uncalled for public humiliation of Gus by the defendant," documents said. 
When Christofi got up to leave, Williams said he was only joking. 
The liquor bill for Williams and nine adults totaled $627, documents said. Two children also were present. 
Tests on a blood sample taken from Williams eight hours after the shooting found a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.11 percent, slightly above the legal threshold for intoxica­tion in New Jersey. 
An expert for the prosecution has concluded Williams was severely intoxicated at the time of the shooting, with a probable blood-alcohol concentration of between 0.18 and 0.22 percent. 
Later, guests persuaded Christofi to tour Williams' Alexandria Township mansion, and he snapped photos of mem­orabilia inside.

Get to Know Me 
¦ by Fr. Kevin Russeau, C.S.C., Director of Freshman Retreat Program 
My name is Fr. Kevin Russeau, C.S.C.. I am a Hoy Cross priest and I'm in my first year working here at Notre Dame. For the past two years I had been serving at St. Gregory the Great Parish in Phoenix Arizona. But in July of this year, my provincial asked me to move back to South Bend and to serve as the Associate Director of Vocations for our province. 
What a great time I have had so far! 

Upon my arrival in July, I was fortunate to work with NDVision for two of their four week confer­ences. ND Vision is a program that started this past summer to help high school students find their place in the Church's life and mission. Seventy of our students worked together as counselors and musicians to facilitate great discussions, skits, prayer services, and fun activities to bring home the point that each of us are called to live a vocation of holiness. 
Shortly after ND Vision ushered home the last group of high school students I went on a bus to Toronto to see our Holy Father Pope John Paul II! This was an amazing pilgrimage. Over 200 students from various Holy Cross schools and parishes (University of Notre Dame, Saint Mary Col­lege, Holy Cross College, University of Portland, Our Lady of Solidad Parish in California, Hoban High School ofOhio) gathered at a Catholic grade school about 75 minutes from the heart of1oronto. We used the school as "home base." Not only were we from many different schools and parishes, we were also from different countries. A large group from Chile was with us, a group from France and Mexico joined us, and we joined a "host" Holy Cross group from 1v1ontreal. Despite our different origins and the challenge ofhaving three languages (French, Spanish, and English) we had in common our Holy Cross heritage. 
The Congregation of Holy Cross, as Brothers, Sisters, and Priests, serve in 15 countries on 5 conti­nents. For our founding in 1837, we were sent as missionaries to be "educators in the faith." It was a great experience to come together from so many different places for a common purpose. We came to pray together, to learn more about our faith, to meet other young people excited about their faith, and we came to hear what the Pope had to say! World Youth Day 2002 Toronto will remain a fond memory for me. I highly recommend that you go on a pilgrimage if the opportunity arises -the next World Youth Day will be held in Germany in 2005! 
Since the summer (which went by very quickly) I have been unpacking and moving into my room and offices. I live in 220 Keenan Hall and I work for Campus Ministry and in the Holy Cross Vocation Office. Many ofyour have hosted me in your dorms for Sunday and weekday masses. Thank you! It is so great to be back at Notre Dame for our liturgies! 
I also direct the freshman retreat. Our first retreat was in September and it was awesome -ask around! Our next retreat is November 8-9th -a "must experience" for all Freshmen. Jes a 25-hour getaway where partici­pants meet and make some of their best friends on campus. The simple application can be picked up in room 114 Coleman-Morse or printed from our webpage "www.nd.edu/ ,.,ministry". Any questions can be directed to me russeau.3@nd.edu (E-mail me if you would like to be on our next team!) 
I spend the rest of my time in the vocation office at Moreau Seminary. I talk to young men who are exploring the possibility of becoming a priest or brother for the Congregation of Holy Cross. I am humbled and inspired by God's grace working in our young people. 
But since most people I talk to will answer their calls to live a holy life in other ways besides religious life, I also give talks about our baptismal duty to become holy! Each of us are called to live our lives so that we become saints! What a generous invitation God gives us and an awesome responsibility -one that is possible when we support each other in our community. We have a great opportunity here at Notre Dame to become holy women and men. 
I hope that I get the opportunity to meet you. Stop by my office at Coleman-Morse or visit me at Keenan Hall. Know of my prayers for you.

NFL 
Colts' Jam.es listed as doubtful for Sunday 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 

Edgerrin James might miss Sunday's game against Tennessee because of a partially torn right hamstring. 
The Colts listed James as doubtful Wednesday, and coach Tony Dungy said James would not practice this week so he could rest. James watched prac­tice from the sideline Wednesday afternoon. 
"It looks like it will be a while," Dungy said. "There's some dam­age; we've got to let it rest up." 
James was injured in Sunday night's 26-21 loss at Washington but continued to play until late in the game, when he took himself out. James had an MRI done Monday, and Dungy said the results showed a partial tear of the muscle. 
Ricky Wiiliams. an undrafted rookie from Texas Tech. could replace James for Sunday's game, which the Colts need to win to maintain first place in the AFC South. Williams said he'll spend this week preparing to be the Colts' starter. 
"lf he can't play this Sunday, then I'll get another shot to play this season," Williams said. 
Williams ran three times for 21 yards and caught a 20-yard touchdown pass to get the Colts to 23-21 after filling in for James against Washington. 
The loss of James would be another blow to the Colts' run­ning game, which has struggled all season. 
Quarterback Peyton Manning said Indianapolis would be pre­pared to play without James. 
"When a guy is doubtful. you have to take that approach, that he won't play," Manning said. "You pray and you hope that he does play, but you have to pre­pare as if he is not." 
When James has been on the field, he hasn't looked like the runner who won the NFL rush­ing title in 1999 and 2000. 
Coming off surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, James has pro­duced just one 100-yard game this season and has run for fewer than 100 yards in five straight games, the longest such stretch of his career. His 3.4 yards per carry is almost a full yard less than his career average (4.3).

Tour will recognize Masters 
. Finchem refuses to back down in Augusta National controversy 
Associated Press 
ATlANTA 
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem refused to back down from his position on the Augusta National controversy, saying the tour will recognize the Masters as an official event and he expects his players to compete. 
Commissioner Tim Finchem said Wednesday the PGA Tour will have a fully sponsored schedule for 2003, although it might lose one opposite-field event in the fall. 
He also announced the PGA Tour is changing the name of its 50-and-over circuit to the "Champions Tour" with hopes of appealing to a broader base of fans. 
During his annual "State of the Tour" message. commis­sioner Tim Finchem said the Champions Tour would have at least three fewer tournaments to keep the seniors from play­ing the same weeks as major championships and other bi.I!

events. 
The developmental tour will 
change names for the fourth 
time since its inception in 
1990. What was the Buy.com 
Tour will be called the 
Nationwide Tour, reflecting a 
new five-year sponsorship 
deal. 
The PGA Tour logo of a play 
er swinging a golf club will be 
included in the branding of all 
three tours. 
Finchem did not disclose any sponsorship deals for the PGA Tour, saying the 2003 schedule would be announced after the tour's board meeting next month. 
That brought a sharp reply from the National Council of Women's Organizations. whose leader accused Finchem of "stonewalling" on the issue of Augusta's all-male member­ship. 
"If I were his board, I would be asking who he works for: Augusta or the PGA Tour?" Martha Burk said Wednesday. "Clearly, the position he has taken is going to be an apolo­gist for Augusta." 
Burk has accused the PGA Tour of creating a double stan­dard by counting the Masters among its official events, even though the tour has a policy not to hold tournamP.nt<. on courses that discriminate. 
In an Aug. 20 letter to Burk. 
Finchem said the tour does not 
have a contract with the club, 
cannot require Augusta 
National to follow tour rules 
and had no plans to stop rec­
ognizing the Masters as one of 
golf's four major champi­
onships. 
During a 45-minute news 
conference at the season-end­
ing Tour Championship, 
Finchem declined to elaborate 
beyond the letter or be drawn 
further into the debate over 
whether Augusta National 
should admit a female mem­
ber. 
"As far as I know, there's 
going to be a tournament at 
Augusta -the Masters -and 
it's going to be on CBS televi­
sion, and our players are going 
to go play," Finchem said. 
"What else happens, I'm not 
going to speculate on that." 
At one point he said, "I know 
you're going to try to move me 
out of the confines of my state­
ment. You're not going to be 

successful." 
Later, Finchem told a group 

of reporters he was comfort­
able with the tour's position. 
"It is a position based on the 

evaluation of all factors," he 
said. 
The PGA Tour controls 45 

tournaments a year, although 
it doesn't run any of the four 
majors -the Masters. the U.S. 
Open, the British Open or the 
PGA Championship. 
It considers them as official 

events, and counts money 
earned toward the PGA Tour 
money list. Winners of the four 
majors received a five-year 
exemption on tour. 
The tour stopped playing its events at male-only clubs in 1990, eliminating Cypress Point from the rotation at the Pebble Beach National Pro­Am, and leaving Butler National at the Western Open outside Chicago. 
Some of the players rallied behind Finchem. 
Former PGA champion David Toms said while he thought Finchem could be more vocal. the commissioner should not stop counting the Masters as official. 
"That would be totally giving in to this liberal cause," Toms said. "We made a stance sev­eral years ago when we stopped going to clubs that dis­criminate. We've made our case on what we believe. Augusta National can take care of this." 
Charles Howell III. who grew up about five miles from Augusta National. said the tour should focus on its own events. 
"The tour's job is to run golf tournam~nts for us," he said. 

NFL 
Hilliard will miss season with dislocated shoulder 

Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

New York Giants receiver Ike Hilliard will miss the rest of the season with a dislocated right shoulder suffered on a hit by All­Pro safety Brian Dawkins of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
An MRI on Tuesday disclosed a tear in both Hilliard's labrum and pectoralis muscle. He will undergo surgery in about a month and will at some point be placed on injured reserve. 
The normal rehabilitation period for the surgery Hilliard will undergo is three months. 
"Ike's been a playmaker for us," coach Jim Fassel said. "He does an outstanding job on third down. He's been a guy that has been one of our consistent play­ers. 
"He has continually played well in all the games. We're going to miss him." 
Fassel said that he asked ref­eree Bill Carollo whether Dawkins should have been eject­ed following the hit near deep in Philadelphia territory Monday night. Fassel said Carollo told him that the official who made the call didn't believe it warrant­ed a disqualification. Dawkins was called for a personal foul. 
"That type of hit is covered under the rules," Fassel said. "Guys get penalized. Whether the league does anything else or not, I don't know. You hate to see players get hurt, period, especially on a play that could have been avoidable." 
Hilliard said it would be up to the NFL to say whether the hit was dirty. 
"It's not for me to determine whether or not it was a dirty hit," Hilliard said. "It was late. Dawkins is a good, aggressive player. I'm not one to shy away from contact, so I'm not going to cry about it. That wouldn't do my shoulder any good." 
"I know he's an aggressive player, but I think there is a line that he crossed. He reallv did,"

Giants quarterback Kerry Collins said of Dawkins. "He knew that (Hilliard) was defenseless. I know it's football, it's part of the game, and I'm not saying he intentionally tried to hurt him because I don't think he did.... You're not going to hear Ike say anything bad about it, but it could have and should have been avoided." 
Amani Toomer, the Giants' No. 1 wide receiver who will certain­ly feel the loss of Hilliard on the field, told the Philadelphia Inquirer the hit was a "cheap shot." 
The injury might put an end to Hilliard's career with the Giants. The teams' No. 1 draft pick in 1997 will be a free agent at the end of the season, and it's debat­able whether New York will re­sign him after drafting Tim Carter in the second round this year. 
Hilliard had 27 catches for 386 yards and a team-high two TD receptions. Despite missing almost all of his rookie season after undergoing neck surgery, the former Florida product has 259 career catches for 21 touch­downs. The reception total is the ninth-most in team history. 
Hilliard was hurt in the third quarter of New York's 17-3 loss in Philadelphia when he was hit by Dawkins after a pass from Collins fell incomplete. 
Hilliard had stretched to reach the pass, and was unable to defend himself against the hit. 
After the game, Hilliard refused to talk about the hit. which left both players on the turf. Hilliard got up first and walked straight to the locker room. Dawkins walked to the bench and soon returned to the game. 
Ron Dixon, Carter and fellow rookie Daryl Jones will be used to replace Hilliard. 
Hilliard is the second starter lost in as many games. Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton was lost for the season with an Achilles' injury on Oct. 13.

Dodgers' Brian Jordan exercises right to demand a trade 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

Brian Jordan, who hit .347 and had an NLleading 30 RBIs in September to help keep Los Angeles in playoff contention until the season's final weekend, exercised his right Wednesday to demand a 
trade. 
"This is not an expression of anger or disenchantment with the organization," Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, said from his St. Louis office. "He thinks it's a great team with great management and field staff and three million good fans. "This is about what's impor tant to him and his family." 
Turner spoke with Dodgers general manager Dan Evans about a contract extension last week and his request was denied. 
Jordan, who hit .285 with 18 homers and 80 RBIs in 128 games, was traded to the Dodgers by the Atlanta Braves last January with pitcher Odalis Perez and a minor league pitcher for outfielder Gary Sheffield. 

As a player traded in the middle of a multiyear contract, he is allowed to file a trade demand during the 15 days following the World Series. 
If no deal is reached by 
March 15 and Jordan does not 
rescind his request, he 
becomes a free agent and 
loses $11.5 million of guaran­
teed money. If he is traded, he 
loses three years of potential 
free agency. 
Most trade demands are 

rescinded by players before 
the deadline. 
Jordan, who turns 36 next 

March, is under contract for 
$9 million for next year and 
has a $10.5 million contract 
for the 2004 season that can 
be bought out for $2.5 million. 
"I don't have any problem with what he's doing whatso­ever," Evans said. "At the same time, I don't anticipate making any changes in his contract. We fully expect him to be our opening-day left fielder next season. 
"Our respect for Brian Jordan is huge. We love him on the field, we love him off the field. This doesn't change our feelings for him whatsoev­er. We understand it's his right. It doesn't mean anything has to come of this. He's doing what he has to do, it's a chess move for him." 
Jordan, hampered by injuries throughout his career. played a career-high 15 3 games with the Braves in 1999, when he hit .283 with 23 homers and a career-high 115 RBIs. He underwent surgery on his left knee Oct. 2 and is expected to be fully recovered before spring train ing begins.

The Nike camp experience will benefit Thomas well this season. Not only will the Irish rely on the perimeter game more with the absence of established big men, but Thomas will be counted on to be a leader. 
Over the summer, Irish coach Mike Brey approached Thomas and told him to take on a more vocal leadership role -a role Thomas didn't have to adopt last year, with four upperclassmen in the starting lineup. 
The change wasn't tough for Thomas, who Brey expects to join seniors Matt Carroll, Dan Miller and junior Torrian Jones in filling the leadership 
said. "Last year, I took more of a more reserved role, and its not just going to be myself speaking, the cap­tains will too. I think the guys will respect me being m o r e vocal." 
The addition of freshman guard Chris Quinn could also mean a new role for Thomas on the court as well. Brey said he wants to tinker with the Irish lineup, meaning that

said. "I think it kind of wore on 
me, especially at the end of the 
year." Thomas is eager to defer to 
his teammates and talk about team goals for the season, but he knows that his suc­cess last season means he enters this campaign as a marked man. It's a challenge he's more than willing to accept. "People are going to talk a lot more and say great things, but its not anything that I haven't had experi­ence with," he said. "It's a little bit more pressure because you're in a bigger spotlight, but I like it. I enjoy it, even though I feel like I'm disciplined enough to put out to the side and focus on our main goal."

"It's easy," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "It's part of the human shortcom­ing that we all have, if you're up 24 points with five minutes on the clock I would say it's reasonable to assume that you're going to win that foot­ball game. Therefore you're subject to slight letdowns. Our football team did that." 
This week, finishing for Notre Dame will be about more than just playing 60 minutes of football. It will be about finishing off a big upset against Florida State and not letting their focus down. It will be about not just playing foot­ball for 60 minutes, but play­ing good football for 60 min­utes.

Last year's loss to Boston College is also a lesson in fin­ishing for the Irish. Notre Dame controlled all the statis­tical categories last year, but they still lost the game. This year, they'll use that as a reminder not to accept medi­ocrity. 
"Last year we started OK, but we didn't finish a champi­onship team," Sapp said. "This year the team does a better job of finishing games a lot better and that's kind of what we're working on -starting and finishing games really well."

Back may retumsoon 
By JOE HETTLER Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's last two victories against ranked opponents have come without running back Rashon Powers-Neal. 
Powers-Neal injured his leg during the Pittsburgh game and then re-aggravated the injury in practice the next week. He was disappointed that he couldn't play the last two weeks because the week before his injury, the running back gained over 100 yards against Stanford. 
"It's real disappointing right now," Powers-Neal said. ''I'm just trying to get back to where I was so I can contribute and help the team out." 
Although the leg is still sore, Powers-Neal said he is ready to play this week against Boston College. 
"I feel that if I'm needed I can be productive," Powers-Neal said. "If I have to go, I can go." 
Hildbold receives recognition 
Irish senior punter Joey Hildbold was named as a semifi­nalist for the Ray Guy Award given to the nations top punter. 
Hildbold averages 40.3 yards per punt this year and has pinned opponents inside the 20­yard line 22 times. His long is 53 yards and he has yet to be blocked this season. 
"Joey Hildbold is one of the best punters in the nation, although his average might not show it because he is such a team player and will sacrifice his numbers for the good of the team," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. 
Faine brings the pain 
Notre Dame center Jeff Faine was named as a semifinalist for the 2002 Rotary Lombardi Award. 
Faine joins three Miami Hurricanes on a list that includes Maryland's E.J. Henderson, who the Irish faced in their first game. 
Faine has started 30 straight games for Notre Dame and has played through numerous injuries to stay in the line-up. He was a game day captain against Maryland, Michigan, Stanford and Florida State.

The Irish have been within one score of their opponents in the fourth quarter in six of their last eight games. So play­ing with a 24-point lead with five minutes remaining was something of a new experience for the defense. 
It showed in their play. 
With 1:12 remaining in the game, Florida State scored two touchdowns and recov­ered two onsides kicks. Despite the fact that the Irish still finished the game with a 10-point victory, some mem­bers of the Irish defense feel differently. 
"I myself was disappointed with the way the game ended Saturday," Sapp said. "I almost felt like we lost the game." 
The Irish defense, which has been a strength this season, showed what it could do against Florida State for the first 58 minutes of Saturday's football game. Notre Dame held the Seminoles to 93 rush­ing yards, forced two fumbles and intercepted Chris Rix
