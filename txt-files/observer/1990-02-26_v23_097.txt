Forbes dies of heart attack 
NEW YOHK lAP) -Malcolm Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine owner. motorcyclist and balloonist, was mourned Sunday as one who reveled in life and free enterprise. The self-proclaimed "capitalist tool" died of a heart attack Saturday at age 70. 
"Death happens to everyone but we never believed it would happen to him; he always de­fied the odds," said Forbes' son, Malcolm .Jr., who will succeed his father as chairman and chief executive of Forbes magazine and its parent, Forbes Inc., and as editor in chief of the magazine. 
The son formerly was president and chief operating officer of the parent company and deputy editor in chief of the magazine. 
"What he wanted inscribed on his tombstone says it all: 'While alive, he lived,' " Malcolm .Jr. said at a Sunday news conference with his sis­ter and three brothers. 
Forbes died in his sleep Saturday afternoon at his 40-acre estate in Far Hills, N.J. 
Actress Elizabeth Taylor, a frequent com­panion of Forbes, said Sunday: "I feel like a great light has been turned off. He was one of the best friends I ever had." 
Among the 1,000 guests at Forbes' $2 mil­lion, 70th birthday bash last fall in Tangier, Morocco, were billionaire developer Donald Trump, Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. 
Various estimates placed the worth of Forbes, chairman and chief shareholder of Forbes Inc., at anywhere from $400 million to

INSIDE COLUMN 

Think 'du Lac' is tough? NDwas stricter in 1885 
Day in, day out, the same complaints can be heard on eampus: 
"Parictals arc stupid." "The alcohol policy is ridiculous. "The Administration is unfair." 


Every student at Colleen Cronin some time has said Asst. Accent Editor one or more of these ----------------­
things. This may sound strange, but actually we should be thankful for the rules we have. 
I rceently seeured a copy of Notre Dame's University Hegulations from 1885. Father Corby was president and student life was mueh different than it is now. It will make you see how lenient our rules are, and maybe even appreciate them. 
The general feeling among students lately is that the Administration does not trust us. In 1885, though, trust was the furthest con­cept from Corby's mind. Hule No. 7 stated that "students arc not permitted to visit private rooms." No. 11 went a step further and determined that "unless with parents and guardians, students are not allowed to remain with visitors." Students could not takn private walks either, without parental aeeompaniment. SafeWalk probably would not have set very well with Corby. 
The time between classes is generally a social event for students now, but back in 1885 it was less fun than classes. Hegula­tion No. 3 explains that "as soon as the bell announces the bnginning or end of a College exercise, every one shall repair in silence to the discharge of that duty to which he is called." It was also stated that "silence must be inviolably observed in all places." No student was allowed to enter the "playgrounds" of other departments either. Students were told when to talk and where to walk. Imagine trying to keep from gos­siping before that 10 a.m. dass. 
Just as today, the problem of having no money plagued students of 100 years ago, though thPir mason was not quite the same. 
Hule 16 states that "no one shall keep in his possession any money exc1~pt what he re­eeives weekly from the Treasurer on Wedrwsdays .... " The ATMs had not yet sur­faced to supply those few extra dollars for that last-minute Beacon Bowl outing. 
A eouple other rules to keep in mind that might make ND life a little easier to bear: 
•"Every 
month the students must write to their parents or guardians. All letters sent or received may be opened by the Presi­dent.... " 

•"No 
book. periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into th1~ College without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies." 


Yes, some of the rules and restrictions we have now sometimes make us wish that we had gone to one of those state schools. But at least we can take walks around the lakes, and not have the obligation to write home about it.

The ruling Socialist Party in Hungary and leading opposition groups have gained enough popular support under election laws to field national slates of candidates in the first general multiparty elections in more than 40 years, a Budapest newspaper reported Sunday. They are among 12 parties that will run candidates in the elections, set for March 25, according to the newspaper Mai Nap. There are more than 50 political parties. In most eases, if a party succeeds in fielding a candidate in 25 percent of the electoral districts of a given county or the capital city, then it could put up a county list. If it had a minimum of seven county lists, then it could put up a national list.

ND Law students win court competition 
By SANDRA WIEGAND News Writer 
A team of Notre Dame Law School students, arguing a case involving the dumping of haz­ardous waste in the waters of Antarctica, won the Midwest Hegional round of a moot court competition last week. 
The team consisted of Valli Goss of Oneonta, N.Y., Patricia Kessler of Carlsbad, Calif., An­thony Martinez of Grants, N.M., and Joseph Novak of State Col­lege, Pa. 
Graduate student Gary Sug­arman served as research as­sociate. Tang Thi Thanh Trai Le, law professor, was the team's faculty advisor, and Barbara Fick, associate law profossor, sorved as a faculty assistant. 
The competition involved an "applicant" advocacy and a "n~spondent" advocacy, each consisting of two students, from each school. Each sehool's applieant team corn­petPd against another school's respondent team, Le said. 
The seonario was not that of a tri.al with witnesses, but was much like the procedure fol­lowed by tho United Nations In­ternational Court of Justice, Le said, in which two eountries present legal arguments for opposing sides. 
In addition to the team 
award, Notre Dame picked up 
awards for first, second and 
fifth place in individual oral 
performanees. Over 50 orators 
participated in the region's 
moot eourt competition, Le 
said. 
CritPria for oratory awards is 
bas1~d on a nurnbor of skills utilized during the legal argu­ments including knowledge of the law, presentation, ingenuity, clarity, poise and ability to distinguish between the oppos­ing positions, said Le. 
The topic for the competition was chosen by three or four in­ternational lawyers at the com­petition headquarters in Wash­ington, D.C., Le said. The team was notified of this year's topic in early October, she said. 
Intramural rounds took place in the Notre Dame Law School, prior to knowledge of this year's topic, to determine who should represent Notre Dame at the regional competition, Le said. 
Tho University has sent teams to the competition for a number of years, she said, and also won the regional competition four or five years ago. 
The team will advance to the final round in Washington, D.C. on March 24-28, where nine other regional winners be pre­sent to argue the same topic. 
"We are very confident," said Le, "The team is geared to working even harder" at the national competition. 
In addition to the approxi­mately 120 United States' law schools which participated in the regional rounds this year, 24 teams from foreign coun­tries competed amongst them­selves. The winner of the inter­national competition will take on the winner of the U.S. com­petition, Le said. 
The competition took place at the Detroit College of Law and was named after Philip Jessup, a former American member of the United Nations Interna­tional Court of Justice.

Mandela asks followers to fight peacefully for equality 
DUHBAN, South Africa (AP) -Nelson Mandela, seeking to end four years of fighting among black factions in Natal Province, appealed to the war­ring groups Sunday to put down their weapons and fight together for radal equality. 
Mandela, released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, still supports the low-level armed struggle waged by his African National Congress guerrilla movement. 
But he said the black-on­black fighting in the southeast­ern province hindered the battle against apartheid, South Africa's poliey of racial segre­gation. 
"Even now as we stand to­gether on the threshold of a new South Africa, Natal is in names," Mandela told an esti­mated 100,000 people who filled three adjacent soccer fields. 
"My message to those of you involved in this battle of brother against brother is this: take your guns, your knives and your pangas and throw them into the sea," Mandela said. Pangas are similar to machetes. 
Mandela and his wife, Winnie, arrived by helicopter to rousing cheers. He spoke from a 4­story-tall platform draped with huge nags of the ANC and its 
ally,  the South African  Com­ 
munist Party.  
Many  in  the  mostly  black  

crowd waved the green, black and gold banner of the African 

Nelson Mandela 
National Congress and ehanted "ANC! ANC!" 
About 3,000 blacks, mostly Zulus, have died since 1986 in the power struggle in Natal. The main combatants are the ANC-aligned United Democratic Front and Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu political group headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 

Buthelezi is a staunch oppo­nent of apartheid, but he dif­fers with the ANC over the best way to fight it. 
The ANC favors sanctions, boycotts, strikes and guerrilla attacks to put pressure on the government. Buthelezi does not endorse any of these actions and is a proponent of capital­ism in contrast to the socialist­oriented ANC. 
While the most intense battles have been in the townships around Durban and Pietermar­itzburg, 50 miles inland, the fighting has spread throughout Natal. 
Several of Mandela's ANC colleagues, including Walter Sisulu, have been in Natal since Thursday meeting with leaders of the Front, lnkatha and local clergymen. 
Mandela made several concil­iatory remarks concerning lnkatha and Buthelezi, whom he praised for demanding the ANC be legalized and political prisoners be released. President 
F.W. de Klerk on Feb. 2 legal­ized the ANC, whieh had been banned since 1960. 
Mandela also praised the Zulu leader for refusing to ne­gotiate with the white-led gov­ernment while other black groups were outlawed and their leaders imprisoned. 
Duarte

The Associated Press re­ported that Duarte's father also ran a successful candy­making business which may have helped the family finan­eially. 
The former president of El Salvador graduated from ND in 194H with a degree in dvil engineering. 
According to llesburgh, the Christian values Duarte learned at ND guided him to abandon a profitable earner in engineering and instead fight for political justice. Duartl) once said of llesburgh, "lie taught me soeial justice, and I believed him." 
Duarte lwlpnd form the Christian Dmnocratic Party in 1960 along with other liberal profi)Ssionals hoping to put Homan Catholic social doctrinn into practice through governnwnt.

officers seized power in 1979, Duarte returned to become its president the following year. 
When he was properly elected president of a country plagued by civil war in 19H4, Duarte promised to bring peace and prosperity. In three attempts at negotiations with the leftist rebels, however, he did not budge from the demand that they lay down their arms and join the political process. 
Duarte faced personal trauma due to political strug­gles when his daughter was kidnapped by opposition. lies­burgh said that Duarte felt he was letting his country down by freeing HO murdernrs from jail for his daughter's rnturn. 
Although he was not happy about the viofenee eonneeted with the Christiani government, Duarte was pleased that the political process of fair election and succession worked, lies­burgh said. 
Father llesburgh planned to be in El Salvador today for the funeral and private meetings with Duarte's family. 
The Associated Press con-. tributed to this story.

"I don't know anyone who enjoyed life so mueh or gave so much back," said Barbara Wal­ters, who was a guest at the birthday bash. 
"The whole world will miss Malcolm, who brought human­ity to the capitalist system," in­dustrialist Armand Hammer said in a statement released from Los Angeles. 
Forbes was a tireless collec­tor, accumulating toy soldiers by the battalion and buying up a dozen Faberge eggs, the hand-crafted artworks of Im­perial Hussia. 
lie was an enthusiastic ehampion of free enterprise and emblazoned his corporate slogan, "Capitalist Tool," on his helicopters, balloons, even his clothing and luggage.

Forbes was born in Engle­wood, N.J., on Aug. 19, 1919, two years after Forbes magazine was founded by his father, Scottish emigrant Bertie Charles Forbes. 
After his father's death in 1954, Forbes became publisher and editor-in-chief. The magazine rode the 19HOs bull market and the pro-business Heagan era to the greatest sue­cess since its founding.

Numerous obstacles cause delay in space shuttle liftoff 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (APl -Five astronauts boarded Atlantis Sunday night, but high winds threatened to force can­cellation of the fifth attempt to launch the spaee shuttle on a secret military mission. 
"It will be nip and tuck," said Air ForcP Capt. Tom StrangP, the shuttle weather ol'licer. 
Strange said wind gusts at the launch pad reached 30 mph, about 2 mph above allowable limits. Winds that high, he said, could blow the shuttle into the launch towPr at liftoff and de­stroy the spaceeraft. 
"We have to hope for a letup, but at this point we don't see it." Strange said. 
As the planned launch time of 
12:55 a.m. EST approaehed, launch director Bob Sieck call(~d for an extend()d hold.

hoping that the winds would subside before the available launch period of about 90 min­utes expired. 
The all-military astronaut crew arrived at the launch pad shortly after 10 p.m., just as they did Saturday night only to have their flight scrubbed early Sunday 31 seconds before liftoff. That was the fourth postponement in as many days. 
Forecasters said there was only a 40 percent chance the shuttle could be launched early Monday. 
Despite the gloomy forecast, shuttle manag{!rs in midafter­noon gave the go-ahead for the launch team to pump 528,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Atlantis' cav­ernous fuel tank for another

Arias and Cerezo were among the pallbearers for the founder of the Christian Democratic Party. Party leaders criticized the rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani as "niggardly" for not declaring a national day of mourning. 
At least 100,000 people paid their last respects to the de­parted former president, party leaders said. 
Duarte's followers, many carrying photographs of the former president and cheering. "Duarte! Duarte!" tossed flow­ers at his flag-draped coffin as it was carried from the church to a 21-gun military sah~te. 
Arias, speaking at the Mass, 
called Duarte "the father of 
Central American democracy." 
"Napoleon was a visionary 
pioneer and an untiring lighter 
for democracy," Arias said. 
Cerezo referred to criticisms 
of Duarte's 1984-1989 term as 
president but said, "I think the 
magnitude and value of his 
work still has not been fully 
appreciated." 
lie "gave his life for the cause 
of all democrats of Latin Amer­
ica," Cerezo said. 
Duarte, who tried but failed 
to end a civil war and ease El 
Salvador's scaring class divi­
sion, died at his San Salvador 
home after struggling against 
stomach and liver cancer for 
almost two years. 
Fidel Chavez Mena, who suc­
ceeds Duarte as the Christian Democratic leader, criticized the government for not declar­ing a day of mourning but added: "the people were in mourning, anyway, which is the important thing." 
Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San Salvador and Arena president, said: "Duarte was an expression of demo­cratic will. He made great con­tributions toward the democra­tization of the country."

Winter storm wreaks havoc with heavy winds and snow 
(AP) -At least eight people were killed as a result of acci­dents on Indiana roads Satur­day as a powerful winter storm. packing winds of more than 50 mph, roared through the state. 
Thn storm dumped up to a foot of snow in northern sec­tions of Indiana and reduced visibility to ncar zero over parts of the state, authorities said. 
Two different sections of In­terstate 65 and several lanes of the Indiana Toll Hoad and 1-69 ncar Angola were dosed tem­porarily Saturday due to the extreme eonditions. Dangerous roads also led to a pileup of at least 20 cars on Interstate 7 4 nPar Greensburg. 
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for cxtn~mc northwest and north central Indiana through Sunday morning, affecting 
Strong winds gusting to over 50 miles an hour prompted blowing and drifting of the snow in north and central Indi­ana. Observers in Peru reported a wind gust of 61 mph. 
About six inches of snow had accumulated around South Bend by early evening. Fort Wayne and Indianapolis had two inches each, the weather service said. Total snow 
amounts  near  Lake  Michigan  
could be near a foot.  
The  combination  of  slick  

roadways and wind-whipped snow created near-blizzard conditions and led to numerous traffic accidents, mostly involv­ing fender bender or blinded motorists driving off of the pavements, state police said. 
"We're recommending no travel at all today in the state

WELI.INGTON, New Zealand (AP)--A U.S. doctor arrived in New Zealand Monday to try to reclaim his 7-year-old daugh­ter, who is at the center of a bitter custody battle and re­portedly has not seen either of her parents for two years. 
The girl's mother, Dr. Jean Elizabeth Morgan, was jailed for 25 months in August 1987, when she refused to say where her daughter was after a U.S. court gave her former husband unsupervised access to the child. 
Morgan, a 42-year-old plastic surgeon in Washington, had claimed her ex-husband, Dr. Eric Foretich. sexually abused the child, a charge he denies. 
Morgan sent the girl, Hilary Foretich, away with her mater­nal grandparents, first to Eng­land, then to Christchurch, to prevent her father from seeing her. 
But Forctich announced Sat­urday he had located the girl in 
Christchurch,  where  she  has  
been  living  for  nearly  two  
years.  

Morgan reportedly accused him of hunting Hilary down "like an animal." 
Foretich flew from Washing­ton, D.C., into Mangere Inter­national Airport on the North Island and was to fly to Christchurch in the south for a family court hearing, according to the New Zealand Press Asso­ciation. 
"Certainly, we're going to do 
what we need to do to rescue 
my daughter," the Press Asso­
ciation quoted him as saying. 
Morgan is unable to travel to 
New Zealand because her pass­
port was taken from her when 
she went to jail. She was re­
leased in September. 
Hilary was allowed to speak to her mother by telephone Sunday for the first time in two years, her family said. 
"When she talked to her mother, she broke down in tears," said her maternal grandmother, Antonia Morgan. "We've got letters to us 
through various channels, but this was the first time she had spoken on the phone to her." 
Before he boarded the flight, 

Foretich, of Falls Church, Va., 
reportedly accused his former 
wife of waging a media cam­
paign against him. 
"I think Elizabeth Morgan and the people who follow her are very misguided people by the way they're going to make it difficult for my daughter, and it's really a shame," said Fore­tich, a 45-year-old dental sur­geon. 
"My daughter deserves to come back and have a normal life," Hadio New Zealand quoted Foretich as saying. 
The mother flung back her own charges, claiming her former husband sought public­ity himself, according to the New Zealand Press Association. 
"Eric is the one who has had 
a publicity agent for I think six 
months to a year, not me." 

"lie ha'i hunted her down like 
an animal. She docs not want 
to see him, and he knows that," 
the agency said, quoting her 
from the United States. 

William Morgan, the child's maternal grandfather, told Television New Zealand he would call the police if Foretich tried to approach Hilary. 
"lie can't do it. I would have to call the police because the court order says he can't," he said. 
The Family Court in Christchurch granted an in­terim order on Friday giving the maternal grandparents custody of Hilary.

EEC may admit new E. European democracies 
WASIIINGTON lAP) -The emerging democracies of EastPrn Europe may be granted afliliate membership in the European Economic Community as a way of en­couraging their economic re­forms, a community official said Friday. 
Frans Andriessen, vice president for external affairs and trade policy of the Euro­pean Community, said the western dernoeracies needed to do everything possible to encourage the dramatic pace of reforms under way in the fornwr Communist bloc. 
The 12-nation community has expanded its eeonomic lwlp beyond tlw original tar­gets of Poland and Hungary to include East G1~rmany, Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria, Homania and Yugoslavia. 
"If in thP WPst, we pPrsevere in our eiTorts to assist them, tlwn an economic revolution will succ()ed the political ones," Andriessen said. 
In addition to dir()ct eco­
nomic grants, Andriessen said the community was studying 
"the  possibility  to  anchor  
these  new  Eastern democra­ 
cies  to  the  Free  World  

through a form of association with the European Community if they want to." 
Andriessen's comments carne in a speech to a business conference. Afterwards, he told reporters that the pro­posal was still in the forma­tive stage and would be re­viewed further before being taken up by the community's policy-making body in late June or July. 
In a fact sheet, the com­munity said that associate membership could be granted to countries to recognize their "geographic proximity, shared political, economic and cultural values and increased interdependence." 
It suggested that one model for such association would be the existing European Free

Treasury Dept. seizes S&L giant 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Fed­eral regulators on Friday seized the savings and loan industry's second largest holder of junk bonds, a Cali­fornia institution that worked closely with indicted financier Michael Milken. 
The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision turned Imperial Savings As­sociation, San Diego, over to the Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency created in Au­gust to dispose of insolvent S&Ls. 
At the end of the year, Im­perial had $9.7 billion in as­sets, the thrift office said. High-yield, high-risk bonds represented more than 10 percent of its portfolio. The institution was $60.1 million in the red, regulators said. 
Also seized on Friday was Mercury Savings and Loan As­sociation, Huntington Beach, Calif. It had $2.16 billion in assets and was $33 million in the red, the thrift office said. 

Mercury operated more traditionally than Imperial, but had invested in several large hotel projects that went sour. 
Like several other large in­stitutions before it, Imperial ran afoul of provisions in last summer's savings and loan bill requiring it to value its se­curities at market value rather than the purchase price. 
It was forced to recognize $200 million in junk bond losses in the last quarter of last year and had indicated it expected to take a writedown of at least $50 million more in the current quarter. 
At the end of September, Imperial was the 16th largest S&L in the nation and had the second biggest junk bond portfolio, behind only Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., according to Sheshunoff Information Ser­vices. 
Of the top four junk bond holders in the S&L business, only Columbia, with $4.1 bil­lion of the bonds, remains out of the government's control. Analysts speculate, however, that it may be one of the next takeovers. Its debt has been downgraded by Moody's In­vestors Service and regulators have restricted its activities since November. 
"I think that Columbia has to be real close to the mar­gin," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial in­stitutions analyst. "I wouldn't be surprised to see Columbia popped (into the RTC) fairly soon." 
CenTrust Bank of Miami, third in junk bonds, was seized earlier this month, and City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., No. 4, top­pled in December. 
The seizures make the gov­ernment, through the RTC, the largest owner of junk bonds. 
Honest competition is 'in' for smart businesses of the '90s 
Stop dreaming and get down to work. The supply of genies has run out --in Washington and on Wall Street. 
That's the brutally tough message of the latest batch of annual reports sur­veyed for this column by William Dunk, a leading national authority on corpo­rate communications. 
Once a year, Dunk gives us his exclu­sive annual report on annual reports, and it repeatedly has kept us ahead of sueh major corporate changes as the trend toward slimming down and get­ting into cash. Last year, he presciently pinpointed a dangerous tendency to by­pass the challenges of the present while mooning about the glories of the past. 
Now, though, reality appears to be making a belated comeback in the boardrooms of America. The nation's sharpest executives reeognized that fi­naneial gimmicks were losing their ef­fectiveness even before the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and its "junk bond" empire. An anemic economy, here and abroad, means that uncompet­itive companies no longer can rely on non-stop market growth to bail them out. 
"In his 1989 report, to be out soon, Bill McGowan of MCI has it right," Dunk said. "If you read the front-cover 
Louis Rukeyser 
Tribune Media Services 
tabs, you will see MCI say, 'We're smarter; we're quicker; we're tougher; we're better."' 
As Dunk sees it, the annual report leaders this year are full of such "feisty talk" for two reasons: 
•Markets 
are flat. "All sorts of mar­kets have gone flat or are declining around the world. The question now is whether you have the ability to steal market share from two or three other guys. McGowan is simply saying he has the vim and vigor to continue taking market away from AT&T." 

• 
Money is scarce. After a decade of sandwiching debt onto our corporate and federal structures, the money sup­ply has been depleted. "For corpora­tions, that means the end of unreason­able strategies, particularly, restruetur­ings. Now companies will actually have to take market share from the others without all the cash to get the job done. You will have to be a smart operator." 


Ironically, one of the best examples of this new aggressiveness comes from a company dealing with tender infants: Gerber Baby Products. Dunk says Ger­ber "Jlashed its biceps" and "declared it was one tough operator" by announcing "in big block letters on the cover and at the beginning of the financials that it was 'Winning!"' 
A host of other companies made the same point in their annual reports a tri­fle less dramatically. Among the more important, he cites General Mills, which showed that it ranked first or second against 12 of its peers on some key stockholder financial measures, such as dividend payout rate. Elsewhere in the report, it talked vigorously and specifi­cally about "winning in the '90s," citing a host of products and two leading restaurant chains --one of which, Olive Garden, is growing so rapidly that Dunk is convinced "we will be hearing Jots more about mid-priced Italian restaurants." 
The regal look is out, in boardrooms as in Washington. Shorewood Packag­ing's executives posed playfully against their products, "as if to say they're very close to the business and know what needs to get done," said Dunk. Ray Stata of Analog Devices, faced with a $10 million drop in his company's net, eschewed fancy graphics and spelled it out in big type. ("Obviously he, unlike many, believes these reports are meant to be read," said Dunk.) Also, Warren Phillips' Dow Jones report went to type on the inside pages. 
While bright executives got the mes­sage, and got back to business, there are always, as Dunk puts it, "a few de­lightful reprobates." At the top of his sinners list is Cabot in Boston, "still back in the restructuring phase," which "has smashing pictures, no financial highlights (there's trouble!) and $14 million of income after $60 million the year previous --all this packed in an el­egant, oversized report that runs 68 pages." (Similarly, Echlin "does a flam­boyant job even though earnings per share are down 28.6 percent.") 
In general, though, Dunk detects less desire to deceive the customers, or the executives themselves, with the hope that outside forces, financial or gov­ernmental, can substitute for facing and defeating real eompetitors. It's a jungle out there, but the wisest Ameri­can corporations are girding them­selves for survival.

Larry Nance led Cleveland with 24 points, including six during the 12-0 spurt that put the'Cavs ahead 53-40 with 45 seconds left in the first half. 
Charlotte, which got 28 points and 14 rebounds from Armon Gilliam, closed to 80-76 on Dell Curry's 3-pointer with

NEW YOHK (AP) -Joe Du­mars scored 15 of his 31 points in the third quarter as the De­troit Pistons won for the 14th time in 15 games, 98-87 over the New York Knicks on Sun­day. 
The loss was only the third in 25 home games for New York, but all have been runaways. The Knicks lost at home to Phoenix by 14 points on Jan. 2 and to the Los Angeles Lakers by 21 on Jan. 23. 
Dumars made seven of 11 shots in the third period, and his last live baskets came after the Knicks had scored. All but three of his 14 field goals in the game came on shots from 10 feet or more. 
The Pistons led by 15 points 
four times in the third period, 
the last at 77-62 with 1:54 left, before Patrick Ewing scored eight of his 37 points during a 12-5 run that closed the gap to 82-74. 
But the Knicks got no closer, and none of Ewing's teammates scored more than 12 points. 
Cavaliers 102, Hornets 86 
Chucky Brown finished off a 12-0 Cleveland run with a one­handed alley-oop dunk and a free throw in the second quar­ter, and John Williams' two three-point plays defused a fourth-quarter threat by Char­lotte. 
The Hornets lost their fourth straight game and their 16th in 17 outings. They doomed them­selves with two lengthy scoring droughts, going without a point for more than four minutes late in the first half and again for

Portland  20-6  over  a  5  1/2­ 
minute span.  

A 10-2 run by the Pacers gave them a 65-54 lead in the third quarter, but Portland rallied. 
A pair of free throws by Terry Porter, who led Portland with 28 points, cut Indiana's lead to 98-93 with 5:09 remain­ing. But Person, who scored all of his 15 points in the second half, ignited another 10-2 run by the Pacers to put the game out of reach. 
Celtics 115, Nuggets 107 
Michael Smith, who has aver­aged 3.6 points so far this sea­son, scored 24 points and trig­gered a late rally as the Boston Celtics beat the Denver Nuggets 115-107 Sunday. 
Smith, a 6-foot-10 rookie forward, started the winning 13-2 run with three minutes to go when he hit a 12-foot bank shot and added a free throw. 
That erased Denver's last lead of the game, 105-102 on Alex English's layup and free throw with 3:19left. 
Boston, which had led most 
of the way, saw a 15-point lead 
vanish in the third period as 
Denver rallied for an 89-85 
lead. 
Larry Bird, who topped the Celtics with 25 points and 17 rebounds, hit a 16-footer to cut Denver's lead to 89-87 at the end of three periods.

Proposition 48 subjects find that the regulation has merit 
(AP)-It has become as much a part of the vernacular of col­lege basketball as 3-pointer, small forward and "call a t.o., baby." 
The only problem is Prop 4H has beeonw a negative descrip­tion of a high school athlete who has failed to meet the aca­dnmie minimums for immediate eollngiate eligibility. 
The current senior class is the first to have nntered college with Prop 4H in dl"t~d. 
Three of its most prominent membt~rs-Miehigan 's Humeal Hobinson and Tnrry Mills and St. John's Jayson Williams­were among the first to be de­dared ineligibln because of it. 
It has changnd their lives for­over and to listnn the them, it has changed them for the bet­tnr. 
"Every student is different as cvnry person is different," Hobinson said before a recent practice. "Certain student-ath­letes can't adjust to playing big-time sports at a big-time collngc. Ct~rtain players can ad­just. I can only speak for my­self. I like what I did that fn~shman year although I didn't like what initially happened to me. I liked that I didn't play and that I got a rhance to so­cialize with the students. 
"It is kind of a shame that players often don't gnt a chance to do that because what is col­lege except a place to come and meet din"en~nt people and those people that you nwet might be your !"ril'nds or tlw pi'Ople you

Oklahoma upsets No. 1 Missouri, Louisiana State falls to Georgia 
After beating one No. 1 team, Oklahoma is anxious to do it again. 
The 1Oth-ranked Sooners stopped top-rated Missouri 1 07-90 on Sunday for its 44th straight home victory. 
On Tuesday night, Oklahoma will play host to Kansas. The Jayhawks are No. 2, but are expected to move up. 
"This gives us an opportunity to show we can play and that we're one of the top teams in the country," said Oklahoma's Terry Evans, who had 15 points and 12 assists. 
Oklahoma (21-4, 9-3) pre­vented Missouri (25-3, 11-2) from clinching a share of the Big Eight championship. Doug Smith had 27 points and 11 re­bounds for the Tigers. 
"That's life in the Big Eight," Missouri coach Norm Stewart said. 
A record crowd of 12,157 at the Noble Arena saw Oklahoma pull away from a 49-45 half­time lead. Jackie Jones, who had 28 points and 10 rebounds, led a 15-2 spurt that made it 66-51. 
William Davis added 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Sooners. Oklahoma is 92-0 un­der Coach Billy Tubbs when scoring at least I 00 points. 
"We made the right run at the right time," Tubbs said. "In the first half. we would almost get it going, then we'd make some routs or a turnover or not a good, solid play. We frdt like WP could get somnthing going." No. 2 Kansas 70, Kansas St. 58

Stanford crushes Morrissey in IH 
lnterhall final sees undermanned Manor lose to Stanford 
By RICHARD MATHURIN Sports Writer 
A dream matchup turned sour: Stanford defeated a highly undermanned Morrissey A-1 65-45 in the men's lnterhall basketball championship. 
Both Morrissey A-1 and Stanford came into the game with undefeated records. After Sunday's championship game, only Stanford could make that claim. 
The game started 20 minutes late because only four Morrissey A-1 players came. Finally, Rod Culver appeared and Morrissey A-1 fielded a team. 
Starters Derrick Johnson and Tom Veltz were out of town, while super reserve Dorsey Levins missed the game due to a knee injury for Morrissey A-1. 
Stanford looked to make the game a Iaugher early. Leading scorer Rob Vazquez, who scored 45 points in a game ver­sus Zahm, led the charge for Stanford. He scored on a driv­ing layup and got fouled. He added the free throw niaking the score 10-0 Stanford. A shell-shocked Morrissey A-1 team called timeout. 
After the timeout Stanford scored again and led 12-0. Morrissey looked shaken, but Manor guard Kevin Kade would not let his team fold. He con­nected on a three-point bomb to give Morrissey its first points. After another Stanford basket, Kade again answered with two consecutive three­pointers to bring his squad within five points at 14-9. 
After the two teams traded baskets, Vazquez streaked out on the fast break and finished it with a thunderous dunk, which brought the highly parti­san Stanford crowd to its feet. 
The game remained close throughout the first half with Stanford going up by nine at the half with two baskets just before the buzzer by Vazquez and Chris Westervelt. 
Unfortunately, fatigue began to catch up with Morrissey A­1. Stanford began pushing the ball up relentlessly, with point guard Ray Flannery scoring and dishing off to others. Stanford scored the first four points of the second half. 

Morrissey A-1's Kade an­swered again with another three-point bomb to bring his team back to within 10 at 33­23, but that would be as close as they got. Flannery answered with a three-pointer of his own. 
Stanford continued its speed game, running at every oppor­tunity. During the next five minutes, it increased its lead to 22 points and led 49-27 after three quarters. 
The fourth quarter proved to be academic, as a fresh Stanford squad continued to run and never let Morrissey A-1 back into the game. To Morrissey A-1's credit , they continued to play hard despite the score. 
The game ended with a twenty point margin, 65-45, but could have been higher because Stanford pulled its starters. 
O'Connor qualifies for NCAAs at Invitational 
Special to The Observer 
It was a record-setting day Saturday in the Alex Wilson Invitational at Meyo Track. 
Runners set seven meet and four fieldhouse records and turned in 10 NCAA qualifying marks. 
Notre Dame senior co-cap­tain Mike O'Connor set a meet and track record while qualifying for the NCAAs in the 5000 meters, O'Connor won by more than nine sec­onds with a time of 13:57.38. 
"Mike ran a super race," Notre Dame coach Joe Piane said. "He ran with the pace very well and had a lot left for the last lap. I am very excited about his chances at the NCAAs." 
In the most impressive 
performance of the day, 
Howard Burnette of New 
York Tech qualified for both 
the indoor anrl outdoor 
NCAAs in the 300-meter dash in a time of :46.00. That was the second-fastest race this year by a collegiate runner. 
Notre Dame took the top two spots in the 500 meters. Yan Searcy won the event in 
1:03.18 followed by Kevn Wheelan at 1:05.79. Notre Dame's Doug Puffer and Pat Devanny took fifth and sixth in that race. 
Jeff Smith and Xavier Victor took third and fourth for the Irish in the long jump, while Glenn Watson was second in the 55 meter high hurdles. Rusty Setzer finished third in the 55-me­ter dash as did Joe Hoff in the triple jump. 
Notre Dame took the 
fourth through sixth places 
in the 1000 meters. Matt 
Ronzone was fourth, John 
Whelan fifth and Neil 
Mulrooney sixth. 

Connecticut new 'beast of the East', 'Huskymania'ensues 
STOHHS, Conn. (AP)-The first place team in the Big East isn't Syracuse, where they run like the Lakers and dunk like Jordan. And it isn't Georgetown, where the twin towers could block out the sun and intimidate a shooting star. 
No. the new beast of the East is once-lowly Connecticut, where eoach Jim Calhoun's no­star offense and relentless de­fense have jelled around Nadav Henefeld, a ball-hawking former Israeli soldier who has given new meaning to the words "Gaza strip." 
No matter that the Huskies 
shoot a league-low 63 percent 
from the foul line, dress only 
one senior and don't have a 
marquee player like 
Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning or Syracuse's Derrick Coleman. 
"Hey, it may not be very pretty, but it's our style," said Calhoun, whose team has won 13 of its last 14 games and is now 23-4 overall, ranked sixth in the nation and is a full game ahead of Georgetown and Syracuse in the Big East. 
This wasn't supposed to hap­pen. The Big East coaches, who are supposed to know better. picked Connecticut to finish eighth in a nine-team league. The Husky fans weren't im­pressed either and booed them on their home court twice in December. 
The booing stopped when the Huskies stole one from Syracuse Jan. 15. When they beat Georgetown five days later, Husky fans started talk­ing NCAA tournament. All re­straint crumbled into statewide lluskymania on Jan. 27 when the Huskies christened their $28.5 million Gampel Pavilion with a 72-58 victory over St. John's. 

Suddenly the Huskies were climbing in the polls, and out­of-state sportswriters were joining the horde that has cov­ered Connecticut through 10 Big East seasons without a sin­gle trip to the NCAA Tournament. 
The biggest individual story in Storrs has been llenefeld, a stoic, 6-foot-7 forward who has become a cult hero on campus. At 21, he is a veteran of the Israeli national team, a patient and inventive passer who is deceptively quick. There have even been comparisons to Celtic star Larry Bird. 
"He has some intuitions, some instincts about the game that you can teach only in your dreams," said Calhoun, who traveled to Tel Aviv to recruit Henefeld, and prefers to com­pare him to Danny Ferry. 
"The Dove," as he is known, scores 11.9 points per game and leads the team in steals and rebounds. He already owns the NCAA freshman record for steals in a season with 109, has been named Big East rookie of the week three times and player of the week once-an honor never before won by a Big East freshman, not even Patrick Ewing or Chris Mullin. 
"He's an actual hero in Israel," said Connecticut sports information director Tim Tolokan. "Without exaggera­tion, the guy's a hero." 
His aura increased when he made a 3-pointer with two sec­onds left in overtime to beat Providence, and his steals be­came known as "Gaza strips." 
Israeli newspapers call Storrs after games to find out how Nadav did. And Henefeld's seri­ous, modest demeanor seems only to encourage the love af­fair with Husky fans. 
"Nice things are being said," Henefeld said recently. "But not all of them are true."

Women's tennis team takes four victories over weekend at Eck Pavilion, up to 5-3 
By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The wonwn's tennis team slammed four opponents at Eck Pavilion last weekend. raising their record from a mediocre 1­3 to a rPspectable 5-3 in the space of three days. 
Notre Dame's first conquest took plae1· Friday, with the 25 of 27 MCC games, including 18 straight, since joining the conference last year. 

Leading the Irish in scoring, junior guard Karen Hobinson is averaging 14.4 points per game. Margaret Nowlin and Krissi Davis follow, battling each other in scoring and re­bounding stats. Nowlin has 
11.2 ppg and 6.9 rpg, neck and neck with Davis's 11.1 ppg and 
6.S rpg. 

Nowlin was named MCC Player-of-the-Week as well. after leading Notre Dame to back-to-baek wins over Butler and Detroit. Tlw 6-1 Minnesota native did not miss a shot in at­taining her 15 points versus Butll'r and then seored 21, her 
Irish coach Jay Louderback had nothing but praise fur his team's performance. 
"We had all twelve players in the first three matches, and ev­erybody had at least one win," said Louderback. "Everybody played really well." 
Louderback also noted the play of the Irish singles teams, which won an amazing five 
second highest total of the year, against Detroit. 
Adding to recent Irish honors, the squad finished sev­enth in the NCAA Division I women's basketball statistics in field goal shooting at 49.7% and sixth in three-point goals with 43.4 %. Notre Dame also received six votes in last week's national poll. 
Attempting to halt the Irish winning streak will be Xavier's Kim Blanton, who leads the team with 13.5 ppg. The Musketeers average 69.6 points a game, compared to Notre Dame's 75.4 ppg. Xavier is currently in fifth place in the conference with a 6-6 leagw) record. 
"We played strong teams and got beat. But I think it helps

NBC deal .aftermath: lasting effects on national opinion? 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame may owe Mike Tyson more than it realizes. 
When that previously untar­nished idol of boxing hit the canvas in Tokyo, Notre Dame was spared embarrassing and potentially damaging publicity on the cover of Sports Illustrated regarding its recent television contract with NBC. The editors were considering running a Notre Dame football jersey decked with dollar signs and peacock plumes. 
"We became aware that it (the contract) was a potential cover story," said John Heisler, Notre Dame's Sports Information Director. "It got to the point where they requested a jersey from us and we refused to give it. They actually re­quested one of our football players to come out and be a model, but we didn't want to be involved in something like that." 
Instead, heavyweight cham­pion Mike Tyson had his title wrested away by James "Buster" Douglas in a 1Oth­round knockout, a bigger story than the lucrative deal that the Irish signed with NBC. 
This did not stop other news­papers running eye-catching headlines, nor did it stop Sports Illustrated from includ­ing a slightly less insulting graphic than the icon-laden jer­sey. Sl depicted a seedy-looking leprechaun clutching a pot of gold, charging out of a football stadium amidst a clutter of fallen opponents. 
Three weeks after the agree­ment, the furor has died and the impact of the decision can be examined. The media's por­trayal of the event started with shock and ended with concilia­tion, but in this cycle Notre Dame may have suffered some damage. 
"Initially there was a lot of knee-jerk reaction, and I think we expected that," said Heisler. "We expected an awful lot of columnists to take their shots at Notre Dame, and that was what happened. But we could give you a surprisingly large number of them who came back and said that there was a lot more to it than that." 
This introduces speculation that Notre Dame could have handled the situation with more grace and expertise, given that the media fell into shock before settling into a more accepting position. Although the critics of the deal are still numerous, many have lessened the severity of their stance and many have outright changed their posi­tions. 
Several attacked the "greed" of Notre Dame without ac­knowledging that the additional money generated was ear­marked for student financial aid. Could Notre Dame have averted the extremity of the 
·media, perhaps stressing the 
scholarship implications a little 
more? 
"I don't think we could have 
{stressed  it  more),"  said  
Executive  Vice-President  
Reverend  E.  William  

Beauchamp, who announced the _decision with Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal at the original press conference. "We made that {financial aid) point over, over and over again, and those who chose to i

that chose to ignore it. I don't think we would really do any­thing different. 
"People are going to write what sells newspapers. That's reality. So they are going to take a particular angle. In commentary you don't write about scholarships for stu­dents." 
This viewpoint presents a disturbing consequence to the Notre Dame decision. Is the bleak reality that those sup­portive of the University will report the agreement favorably, and those critical of Notre Dame will depict the contract negatively? 
"I suspect there's some recognition here that those people who were friendly to Notre Dame understood our decision, certainly didn't criti­cize it, and some even ap­plauded it," said Rosenthal. "Those people who were not necessarily in tune with Notre Dame also chose to express their position on it, and I guess that shouldn't surprise us too much." 
Much to the University's credit, it tried to answer any questions its critics might have had, and Beauchamp even wrote a letter explaining the decision to Notre Dame alumni. 
"We felt that it was in our best interests to try to explain what had come about," said Heisler, "especially if there were questions or negative aspects that we could try to an­swer. We felt, especially ini­tially, that it was important to explain why we did what we did." 
Still the resounding voice of the media was initially one of disapproval. Chicago Sun­Times columnist Terry Boers exemplified the outspoken: 
"By putting their name on the dotted line, Rosenthal and 
friends have exposed them­selves for what they really are-a gaggle of greedy, money-grubbing backstab­bers." 
The Kansas City Star may have summed up initial senti­ment best: 
"It {the deal) was more--than wrong. It was selfish, greedy and deceitful." 
"I think the media generally is looking for a way to criticize college athletics and suggest that this is a big business, that everybody's out for the money and that it's not the innocence that some people want to make it out to be, in terms of ama­teur athletics," said Heisler. "And I don't think anybody here would argue with that." 
To be fair, there were many supportive articles on the University's decision. Newspapers across the country, including the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Examiner and the Cincinnati Enquirer have been quick to point out that the Irish do not deserve this media bombardment. The Sports lllustrated article was a balanced account, despite the graphic. 
With this mixed reaction, will Notre Dame's carefully culti­vated image, from Rockne to Holtz, from the Gipper to the Four Horsemen, be damaged? 
Some analysts think so. Norman Chad of The National Sports Daily wrote, "on and off the field, Notre Dame's holy­water image finally has been muddled" and Blaine Newnham of the Seattle Times claimed, "Notre Dame's place in college football...is unparalleled...So, now, is the gall and greed." 
The official word on campus is that Notre Dame will not lose its role. 
"I've been amazed at how there has been a tendency to blow this all out of proportion

on the world scale, even on a

scale," said Beauchamp. "I 
don't have a crystal ball to look 
into the future, but in terms of 
Notre Dame's role in intercol­
legiate athletics or Notre 
Dame's voice in intercollegiate 
athletics, of Notre Dame serv­
ing as a model in some ways, I 
don't think any of that will be 
affected." 
Aside from the slippery con­cept of the image, there have been other suggestions of repercussions arising as a re­sult of the deal. Tim Prister, Editor of Blue and Gold Magazine, has suggested that sportswriters might harbor re­sentment towards the Irish when voting for No. 1. 
"I just think that Notre Dame is in a situation where unless Notre Dame goes undefeated, clearly the only number one vote, I think that they won't get sympathy from the voters," said Prister. "The achievements last year carry little weight. The writers might put the screws to Notre Dame." 
Words like greed and deceit could also "put the screws" to Notre Dame. The best test will be time. 
"Everybody throws around the term 'greed,"' says Prister. "I think that those opposed to Notre Dame now have more ammunition to hate it. The word 'greed' has been thrown around in the media so much, I think I've seen six columnists accuse Notre Dame of being outright greedy. On the other hand, fans will be generally thrilled. I guess the Notre Dame hating faction will just grow a little bit stronger." 

Is Notre Dame destined to gnash its teeth in the doldrums of public perception? Probably not. How people view this deal in the long run might reflect how they feel about college ath­letics in general, something 4 Notre Dame cannot control.

NO hockey beats UMD, unable to close home season 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
After downing Michigan­Dearborn 6-3 the previous evening, the Notre Dame hockey team failed to win its rematch with the Wolves Saturday night. 
or course, you can't win if you don't play. 
The inclement weather pre­vented Michigan-Dearborn from making the trip to South Bend on Saturday. While the Wolves may have preferred to remain up north, Irish head coach Ric Schafer was a little disappointed at cancelling his team's last home game of the year. 
"I regret we missed our last home game," commented Schafer, whose squad upped its record to 18-13 with Friday's victory. "We're playing pretty good hockey." 
"It would have been nice to recognize the seniors who've put in four years of service," continued Schafer, "guys like Lance Madson, Tim Kuehl, Bruce Guay, Mike Leherr and them doing things that don't always get put into the news­papers." 


Schafer added that many members of the Notre Dame team are playing their best

of a second title, earned a unanimous decision over Michael Corebellini in the 167­pound division. Balint con­trolled the middle of the ring and continually forced Corebellini to the ropes. 
"I could tell I was mueh stronger by the way the punches were hurting him," Balint said. "He was running around the ring early in the game. The sluggish Irish did not get on the board until 14:22 into the matchup. At that point, Notre Dame jumped baek into the game. Curtis Janicke drew first blood for the Irish. scoring 

first round, so I worked at cut­ting off the ring-that's the key for me because I have to get in­side." 
Mark Hoss pulled off the upset of the day by earning a split decision over defending champion Mike O'Neill in the 17 4-pound division. 
McCormick was surprised by the eleven matches stopped early by the referees, but 'he did not think it took away from the excitement of the bouts. 
"A lot of lights were stopped early. so there were some mis­matches," he said. "But this is on assists from Mike Curry and Kevin Patrick. Thirty-one sec­onds later, defenseman Dan Sawyer tied up the contest with what Schafer called "a lucky break." 
"Sawyer was behind the blue line, just dumping the puck into the zone, and it hit the plexi­glass and deflected into the goal," Schafer explained. "The goalie was definitely not ex­pecting it, but it got us right back into the game." 
Curry finished the scoring in that period. His shot from just in front of the goal put the Irish ahead to stay. 
The Wolves did score once more, in the second period. By that time, however, goals by .-iterling Black and Lou Zadra had put Notre Dame up 5-2. Zadra got the only goal in the third period, giving him two for the game and sixteen on the year. 
"Zadra is showing his scoring talent," lauded Schafer. "lie is a scoring threat every time he takes the iec." 
unquestionably the best bunch of kids we've ever had. 
"Many of these kids, with the right experience and year­round training, could be awfully good lighters on any amateur level."

Irish miss free throws, lose to Georgia Tech in overtime 
Loss makes NCAA hopes questionable 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
Th11 comnbacks eontinund Saturday al'tnrnoon at tlw Joyce ACC, and now it might takn an 1w1m greatl'r rally for the horne team to receive an NCAA Tournament invitation. 
Nolrl' DamP ( 14-101. whieh had blown an 18­
point lead bnl'ore losing at the buzzer Tuesday 
to independent rival ()pPaul, watched a 14-point 
advantagP disappear on Saturday in an 88-80 
owrtime ddmlt to nighth-ranked Georgia Tech. 
What had most of the Irish players and 
coaches disheartened, however, was the way 
th11y IPt a orw-point lead slip away in the final 
minut11 of rPgulation. Joe Frndriek and Daimon 
Swnnt each missed the front ends of one-and­
orw situations with Notre Damn lnading 74-73 
and 20 snconds lnl't. allowing the Yellow Jackets 
to forcn, and tlwn dominate, an overtime 
period. 
"Coach had put emphasis on that all week. 
tPIIing us the game would come down to free 
throws," said Sweet, who scon~d 12 points off 
tlw bPnch. "Wn just missed them. It was 
dnfinitnly orw of the turning points." 
"Wiwn you'rn up one and at the line, you've 
got to make your f'r11e throws." said Irish coach 
DiggPr Phnlps. "That's the time to ice it-when 
you'rn at thn line in the last minute. If we make 
tiHlSP, then we foren thnm to shoot a three." 
lnstl'ad. T11ch's Brian Olivnr drove down th11 
bastdinn and dn1w a two-shot foul from 
l.al'honso Ellis with two sm~onds lel't. Oliver

Sm1iors Doug Biokhini and Vance Bel'klund suecessfully r.ontinu11d tlwir qunsts for a third consecutive titln Sunday in tlw quartPrfinals of the 60th annual NotrP Dame B11ngal Bouts before 1.:~50 peopiP at tlw .Ioyce ACC FiPldhousP.

Biolchini's chin was split open from a head butt during the fight. The ten stitelws required to close the wound are not ex­pected to affect Wednesday's semifinal bout against Matthew Potts, who earned a unanimous dedsion over Daniel Hoberts. 
Becklund triumphed in a unanimous deeision over Nick Bourtin in the 158-pound divi­sion. Bourtin sucenssfully eluded Becklund's punches in the first round, but a flurry of shots to the head in the third round knocked him to the can­vas. 
"I took control with the jab," 
Beeklund said. "I started out with a 1-2 punch, but by the end I put together some eombi­nations. 
"(Bourtin) had a good right. and that ean change things completely if' it eatdws you when you're not expecting it." 
Beeklund's next opponent will be David Tyndall, who knocked down Adam SPike several times before the referee stopped the eontest at 1:16 of the third round. 
"Vance will have his hands full with Tyndall." said boxing coaeh Sean McCormick. "lie has a very niee jab. lin's a tough kid."

Iowa wrestlers pound outmanned Irish 36-5 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
It was expecting far too much to think the Notre Dame wrestling team could upset Iowa, but Irish coach Fran McCann still said he was "embarrassed" by Sunday's re­sults at the .Joyce ACC. 
The third-ranked llawkeyes 
recorded two pins, a technical 
fall and two major decisions to 
pummel the Irish 36-5 before 
964 fans, the largest crowd in 
Notre Dame wrestling history. 
In 10 matches, the Irish only 
came away with one win and 
one tie. 

"These are the matches we 
need to schedule in order to 
rnach that next level." McCann said. "Hight now we anm't mentally rnady to get thern. We knew we wern outmanned phys­ically, but WP wanted to make sure we didn't get intimidatPd." 
Whether or not intimidation was a factor, the IIawkeyes racked up several wins by large margins. Iowa appearnd espe­cially strong in the final two­minute period of the seven-pe­riod matches, but McCann re­fused to blame that on fatigue. 
"Lots of times we'd keep it close, and then they'd pull away in the last period," McCann said. "To call it fatigue is a copout. It's mental fatigue if anything, not physical fatigue.
