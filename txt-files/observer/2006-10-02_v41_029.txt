Donnelly tries to drum up campus support 
Effect change, ND grad tells students 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News Editor 
With the days until the national election ticking down and races across the country heating up, double Domer Joe Donnelly, the democratic candi­date for Congress in Indiana's Second Congressional District, visited campus Sunday night to speak about his goals for the country and to encourage polit­ical activism among students at Notre Dame. 
Donnelly, who graduated from the University in 197_7 and from the Notre Dame Law School fn 1981, is currently engaged in what he called a "razor-close race" with Republican incumbent Chris Chocola, to whom he lost in the 2004 election 55 percent to 45 percent. The race has been sin­gled out for national attention by The New York Times, which used an attack ad employed by Chocola as an example of the trend in negative political cam­paigning. 
Sponsored by the Notre Dame College Democrats (NDCD), the event drew almost 50 interest­ed audience members to LaFortune -the majority of whom were students involved with the NDCD. Helen Adeosun, co-president of the

Compared to such luxurious housing, Notre Dame's dorms can start to look like Walkmen among iPods. But for now, the University is tuning out the laughs -Notre Dame likes its older dorms, and the only changes planned for soon-to­be-constructed residence halls are of the spatial variety, said Jeff Shoup, the director of the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH). 
ORLH recently established a committee to discuss the future of residential life and decide what kind of campus living environment is best for Notre Dame. 
"There are all kinds of places that have things like climbing walls and hot tubs ... but I think everyone on the committee believed that we

No, they didn't beat any Irish sports teams or outper­form Notre Dame students academically.

Racers compete to fight cancer 
By MAGGIE DUNN News Writer 
Almost 200 runners and walkers sweated through the 13th annual Saint Mary's Oktoberfest 5K run/3K walk to help raise money for breast cancer Sunday after­noon. 
The event's 186 partici­pants -ranging from Saint Mary's cross-country runners to breast cancer survivors themselves -raised approx­imately $3,650 for the cause. While everyone walked or ran to raise money and awareness, many also had personal reasons.

Fans bear -weather in victory 
Early scoring, unique plays excite crowd 
By PATRICK CASSIDY 
News Writer 
A week after its euphoric come-from-behind victory in East Lansing, the Irish football team returned home Saturday to face the Purdue Boilermakers in Notre Dame Stadium -and over 80,000 people were on hand to watch. 
Fans like freshman Aileen Villarreal enjoyed the contest, despite the less heralded com­petition this weekend. 
"This was a very important game for the students and fans," Villarreal said. "I think the fans came out pumped because of the heart the play­ers t>howed last week." 
The team gave the fans what they wantf'd right from the beginning, scoring a touch­down on their initial drive for the first time all season. The play calling for the Irish included some trickery as freshman receiver George West scored on an 11-yard reverse play. This decision would just be a precursor to an even more pivotal trick play by head coach Charlie Weis, a Jeff Samardzija fake field goal from five yards out. 
"I love Charlie Weis' aggres­sive play calling," freshman Patrick Duffey said. "lie has great confidence in his players and whether it is a fourth down attempt or a fake special teams' play, he has the guts to do it."

Brazil week promotes cultural awareness 
Organizers to screen video, stage concerts 
By COLLEEN SHULA 
News Writer 

A film viewing, a social hour and concerts headline Notre Dame's third annual Brazil week, an event beginning today that's meant to cele­brate Brazilian culture and encourage a greater apprecia­tion of it. 
"It's a very lively culture that draws a lot of people," said Juliana de Sousa Solis, a member of the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, who helped plan and organize the week. 
Events run from Monday through Thursday and begin with a showing of the movie "Favela Rising" on Monday night. The film, which has won 24 national and interna­tional film festival awards, documents social revolution­ary Anderson Sa as he rallies against the violent oppression in his Rio de Janeiro commu­nity. Irene Rizzini, visiting chair in the Study of Brazilian Culture, will introduce the film and will lead a discussion

INSIDE COLUMN 
Woe is the castigated s111oker 
Perhaps it is just my own personal background, but I had never been exposed to true prejudice in my life, at least not until I came here to Notre Dame. Recently, though, I have become aware that I

group here that suffers great persecu­tion at the hands of others. 
I am a smoker. 
At a school that is constantly try­ing to become more diverse, it always amazes me that so many people can be so closed-minded about something. As a smoker, it is rare to go more than a day without at least one person telling me how awful my habit is and list a plethora of reasons for me to quit. 
I find it hard to believe that there are many people in the country today who are unaware of the risks and consequences of smoking. After all, it is hard to ignore the flood of anti-smoking propaganda in every form of media. Every smoker knows the inherent risks, and has made a choice to keep smoking in spite of them. So when a random passerby feels it necessary to criticize my lifestyle choices, it leaves me dumb­founded and with no response ... besides to light another cigarette, of course. 
If this were the only problem I ran into as a smoker, I realize I would not have much to complain about. The real problem, though, is not as simple as having to face dirty looks from people I don't know. Rather, it is the fact that my rights are slowly being taken away from me by the government that is supposed to pro­tect them. There is a public smoking ban in place already in St Joe County, and in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio, as well. On the bal­lot this November will be a proposal to make all public places in Ohio smoke-free. 
The real issue here is not clean air for non-smokers, but the rights of every smoker in Ohio, as well as the owners of every sort of business and establishment throughout the state. There has never been a law saying that non-smokers must patronize a restaurant that allows smoking, and there has likewise never been a law forcing the owners of businesses to accommodate smokers. But now businesses are in danger of losing their rights, and so are smokers. 
Should you ever have the chance to vote on the issue yourself, remem­ber, even though I smoke, I am still a person. As November approaches, I can only pray and hope that I will not have to spend the rest of my life as a social pariah because of the prejudice of others. 
With any luck, my rights will be saved, and the tobacco ban will go up in smoke.

City official says sterilize bad parents 
CHARLESTON, S.C.-A City Council member, reacting to a video store holdup believed to have been carried out by chil­dren, says parents who can't properly care for their kids should be steril­ized. 
"We pick up stray ani­mals and spay them," Larry Shirley said in a story published Saturday by The Post and Courier of Charleston. "These mothers need to be spayed if they can't take care of theirs. Once they have a child and it's run­ning the street, to let them continue to have children is totally unac­ceptable." 
Shirley's comments come after police say a video store was held up by a group of children, including a 14-year-old girl suspected of wielding a BB gun that looked like a pistol. 
Alleged burglar does laundry, gets pizza 
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. ­A burglar who made him­self at home after a break-in overstayed his visit, police said. 
Larcellus Angelo Scott, 23, had ordered a pizza and was doing a load of laundry Wednesday when Denise Bealessio returned home from work. 


Bealessio, 51, arrived just as the pizza did. She turned the delivery driver away and was met inside the door by Scott. 
Scott attacked, but Bealessio was able to escape unharmed. A neighbor called police, who found Scott rummag­ing through Bealessio's purse. He had written one of Bealessio's checks to pay for the pizza.

Media intake scrutinized 
By AMY BARKER 
NewsWrirer 
The endless stream of media from a variety of sources can actually pose a problem to politics in America, Dr. John Pauley said in a talk at Saint Mary's Stapleton Lounge last week. 
Chair of the Saint Mary's communication department Dr. John 
"The line between fact and opinion is continually becoming blurred," Pauley said. 
Pauley also discussed the dangerous "Selected Exposure" phenomenon, which creates factions full of like-minded citizens. 
"We are reaching a point where people consume the media that matches their own prejudices," he said. 
For example, 

Pauley spoke 86 percent of

communication

"What does it matter what media we consume?," the speech began with a pres­entation of American media and its coverage of American politics. Pauley, who chairs the communica­tion department at Saint Mary's, compared the media of 50 years ago ­when there were three major networks main­streaming the news -to today's innumerable resources of information, which Pauley actually called a serious problem. He pointed out that anyone with an opinion can poten­tially publish it on the inter­net. 
istration, 
Pauley said ­and 88 percent of Rush Limbaugh listeners already approve of President Bush. 
According to Pauley, in the trend of reinforcing and reassuring, the prospect of collaborating with an opposing opinion in order to find common ground is lost. The broader the spectrum of people a person is talking to or collaborating with, the sounder their reasoning must be in order to best reach out to the audience. 
"In my opinion, the net result of selected exposure pervading our environment is disheartening," he said. 
Pauley moved into the second point of his speech by defining politics as "a system for distributing scarce resources to a collec­tive for programmatic rea­sons," and questioned the media's presentation of poli­tics. For example, 33 per­cent of citizens switched their initial presidential vote after listening to the Howard Stern show. 

"Howard Stern, Oprah, etc. are not reporters or journalists," Pauley said. "How can they be a sub­stantial source of political information?" 
He encouraged students to seek and decipher all the available information and to avoid the cultural fixation with personality, an obses­sion that is not a part of his political definition. 
Three techniques for pre­venting the problem in media consumption are lis­tening, reasoning and dia­logue, Pauley said, and stu­dents should focus on "con­scious consuming of politi­cal information and in fact, all information." 
Saint Mary's senior Rachel Sokolowski recog­nizes a problem in media consumption. 
"A lot of youth are influ­enced by the wrong out­lets," she said, "and if they can't decipher between thought and opinion then we are at a loss."

Fund created to draw-profs 
Special to The Observer 
University of Notre Dame board chairman emeritus Donald Keough, his wife, Mar­ilyn, and their children have rna de a gift to the Univ­ersity for an e n ­dow­rn en t 

in sup-Keough port of chaired faculty positions for scholars who are both world­class leaders in their field of expertise and demonstrate a commit­ment to the Catholic mission of Notre Dame. To be called Keough­H e s b u r g h Professorships, in honor of Don Keough and Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeri­tus of Notre Dame, the initiative will create two chaired faculty posi­tions and fund the University's efforts to identify and attract younger faculty and graduate students who would work with a Keough-Hesburgh pro­fessor. "The generosity of Don Keough and his family has made an indelible difference in 
the great gains of Notre Dame in recent decades, and we are deeply grateful," said Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the University's president. "We asked that the faculty chairs be named after Mr. Keough, a great lay leader at the University, and Father Ilesburgh, a great Holy Cross priest president. These two individuals worked together on behalf of Notre Dame, and the name of these chairs expresses the fruitful collaboration between lay leaders and Holy Cross religious that has so enhanced the University." 
The goal of the Keough-Hesburgh Professorships is to attract outstanding fac­ulty members to Notre Dame who may be early or late in their careers, visiting or tenured, and traditional academic scholars or individuals whose intellectual pre­eminence has been demonstrated in other settings. 
Thomas G. Burish, Notre Dame's provost, explained: "The two essential characteristics of those who will be appointed Keough­Hesburgh Professors are that they truly are among the best in their 

area of expertise, bringing both uncom­mon talent and broad visibility to the University, and that they will enhance Notre Dame's Catholic charac­ter and mission. It is our preference that such individuals be Catholic themselves, able to give witness to faith in their lives as well as provide intellec­tual leadership in Notre Dame's Catholic mission to the University com­munity." 
Part of the gift from the Keoughs has been used to create an office under the leadership of Rev. Robert Sullivan, associate professor of history and director of the Erasmus Institute, to identify Catholic scholars who are aca­demically suitable can­didates for positions at Notre Dame. 
Keough is chairman of the board of Allen & Company Inc., a New York investment bank­ing firm. He retired as president and chief operating officer of The Coca-Cola Company in 1993 and continues as a member of the Board of Directors. A member of the University's Board of Trustees since 1978, he served as board chair from 1986 to 1991.

Donnelly encouraged students in the audience to take the time over the n·ext four weeks to help canvass for his campaign. 
"We can win here, but we can't win without your help, so come put your Notre Dame skills to the test and make things happen," he said. 
The candidate then took sev­eral brief questions from the audience regarding his policy toward foreign aid, health care, foreign relations with the Middle East and the genocide in Darfur. 
He supported monetary for­eign aid, calling it "an impor­tant part of what America is," and saying it would be easy to fund if "all the waste and non­sense" in the budget was elimi­nated. 
And while criticizing the ini­tial move to enter into war in Iraq, he said an immediate mil­itary pullout was not an option. 
"Now we're there [in Iraq], and if we leave tomorrow it probably becomes terrorist cen­tral, in my opinion," Donnelly said. "I think we can stabilize the country, but we have to have standards or goals we're shooting for to get this done, which we don't seem to have right now." 
In closing, Donnelly again asked for volunteer help, appealing to the audience as Notre Dame students. 
"You say you want to be part of the Fighting Irish spirit and team -well, this is bigger than a football game gang, a lot big­ger than the game against Stanford next week [ ... 1 This is your country, guys," he said.

Saint Mary's softball coach Erin Sullivan, who directed the fundraiser, said prior to the event that she expected it to be more successful this year for a number of rea­sons.

Dozens feared dead in dam collapse 
KANO, Nigeria -Families were swept away in a torrent of water and up to 40 peo­ple were feared dead after a dam collapsed in northwest Nigeria, a state-owned radio station said Sunday. 
The dam -about one mile from the center of Zamfara state's capital city of Gusau ­collapsed Saturday after heavy rains. But surveyors were trying to determine whether to blame the downpour or structural neglect. 
Ibrahim Brini Magaja, a spokesman for the Zamfara state governor, said it was too early to determine why the dam did not hold up, but a construction firm had been asked to study the damage for clues. 
Radio Nigeria said up to 40 people might be dead and area resident Johnson Enokola, 39, said he counted seven bodies floating in the water. Police confirmed three deaths. 
Embattled Irish P.M. repays loans 
DUBLIN, Ireland -Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has repaid business friends more than $100,000 in hopes of defusing a scan­dal that is threatening to force him from power, officials said Sunday. 
Two government officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, confirmed newspaper reports that Ahern mailed checks Friday to a dozen friends who had given him about $65,000 in late 1993 and early 1994. Ahern did not disclose having received the money until The Irish Times newspaper on Sept. 21 reported details of the payments. 
Ahern, who has led Ireland since 1997, characterized the money as an interest­bearing loan -but conceded he had not repaid any of it to his long-time friends and business acquaintances.

Congress reacts to e-mail scandal 
WASHINGTON -House Speaker Dennis Hastert requested Sunday that the Justice Department conduct an investigation into for­mer Rep. Mark Foley's electronic messages to teenage boys -a lurid scandal that has put House Republicans in political peril. 
"As Speaker of the House, I hereby request that the Department of Justice conduct an inves­tigation of Mr. Foley's conduct with current and former House pages to determine to what extent any of his actions violated federal law," Hastert, R-Ill., wrote in a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
White House counselor Dan Bartlett called the allegations against Foley shocking, but said President Bush hadn't learned of Foley's inap­propriate e-mails to a 16-year-old boy and instant messages to other boys before the news broke last week.

Officers discovered the bodies, including that of a 6-year-old, Saturday after responding to a call. According to an arrest affidavit, a witness saw the bodies in the home then called police.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua ­Defense Secretary Donald 
H. Rumsfeld, coming under renewed fire for his man­agement of the Iraq war, said Sunday he is not con­sidering resigning and said the president had called him personally in recent days to express his contin­ued support. 
Speaking to reporters en route to Nicaragua for a meeting of defense minis­ters, Rumsfeld said he was not surprised by reports in a new book that White I louse staff had encouraged President Bush to fire him after the 2004 election. 
"It's the task of the chief of staff of the White House -and having been one, I know that -to raise all kinds of questions with the president and think through different ways of approaching things," Rumsfeld said. "So it wouldn't surprise me a bit if that subject had come up." 
Asked by reporters if he had recently considered resigning, Rumsfeld said, 

"No."

"A lot of people are coming into college who have never shared a room, and we put them into kind of a tight space," he said. "It's some­thing that we're aware of and hope to fix in the next few years." 
Shoup said the number of students moving off campus has been consistent in the past few years, but he believes the benefits of the new dorms may lead to more students staying on campus. 
"Right now we're just trying to make the residence halls more livable," he said. "If that means more people stay on then that's great, if more people move off then that would be their choice." 
Architecturally, Shoup said the new buildings will be designed with a gothic style -in the model of Zahm or Alumni. 
"I don't know that there's going to be significant ameni­ties or luxuries in new build­ings -I think our goal would be that there would be lots of different room sizes," he said. 
A variety of room sizes would allow upperclassmen to obtain better rooms, per­haps even some with bath­rooms, Shoup said. 
The system of progressing to bigger rooms is not unknown at Notre Dame-in fact, it is somewhat similar to the system for football tickets in which older students sit closer to midfield -but Shoup said he hopes the sys­tem becomes more pro­nounced. 
Though new dorms may seem to be on a higher level in terms of standards of liv­ing, Shoup said the pricing system would not change.

lilly debates dropping diabetes drug 
INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly and Co. said Friday it is uncertain whether it will conduct a new, yearslong clinical trial on an experimental drug for diabetes-related blindness requested by the FDA to approve the medicine. 
Lilly said it is "disappointed" with the FDA's request and is weighing whether to conduct a new three-year clinical trial for Arxxant, which many had seen as the company's next block­buster drug. If approved, it would be the first oral treatment for diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in people under the age of 65. 
The Indianapolis-based drug maker said the additional research could take up to five years to complete, including the time needed to enroll patients and analyze the data. 
"We are certainly disappointed with this com­munication from the FDA," Lilly's president and chief operating officer, John C. Lechleiter, said in a statement. 
Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan predicted Ully would drop development of Arxxant because of the additional time and expense of new testing. The drug, she said, had been shown to be only marginally effective. 
Companies struggle with pension rules 
NEW YORK -Now that corporate America's pension promises will be thrust into the spotlight by new regulations, investors should watch for accounting tricks companies may use to redu~e their benefit obligations. 
New rules from U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board will force companies to report the status of their pensions and other post-retire­ment employee benefits -as an asset or, for most, a liability if they are underfunded -on their balance sheets rather than have them buried in a footnote to the financial statements. 
That means huge liabilities could suddenly drop like a bomb onto balance sheets, putting any deficits squarely in the public view and possibly throwing some lending agreements into question because it may lead to sharp drops in corporate net worth. 
Figuring out if any maneuvering is going on won't be an easy task. Investors will have to close­ly watch companies' assumptions for such things as health care and wage inflation that are used to determine the costs of defined benefit plans, which promise retirees a monthly check. 


Fox News losing market share 
Network faces challenges from ratings, Democrats as 10th anniversary approaches 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Fox News 
Channel will mark its lOth 
anniversary this week in an 
unusual position: knocked 
back on its heels. 
The network is in the midst of its first-ever ratings slump. Cable news' most sta­ble lineup is being juggled. And the blow-up over President Clinton's interview with Chris Wallace suggests that Democrats are attack­ing Fox because they per­ceive the same vulnerability in the network as they do in the Bush administration. 
Maybe some of this was on Fox News chief Roger Ailes' mind one day last week when he rode the elevator to the 22nd floor of News Corp.'s office tower for an 
8:45 a.m. stroll through the network's ad sales depart­ment. 
Mr. Ailes? What are you doing up here, someone wondered aloud.

Loved by some, loathed by others, Fox News Channel has been the biggest success in the cable industry and profoundly changed televi­sion news since its signal turned on Oct. 7, 1996.

Mobsters suspected of hatnpering anti-terroristn efforts 
FBI concerned financial opportunities may inspire collaboration between organized crime and al-Qaida leaders 
Associated Press WASHINGTON -The FBI's top counterterrorism official harbors lots of concerns: weapons of mass destruction, undetected homegrown terrorists and the possibility that old-fashioned mobsters will team up with al­Qaida for the right price. Though there is no direct evi­dence yet of organized crime col­laborating with terrorists, the first hints of a connection sur­faced in a recent undercover FBI operation. Agents stopped a man with alleged mob ties from selling missiles to an informant posing as a terrorist middleman. That case and other factors are heightening concerns about a real-life episode of the Sopranos teaming with Osama bin Laden's 
followers. 

"We are continuing to look for a nexus," said Joseph Billy Jr., the FBI's top counterterrorism official. "We are looking at this very aggressively." 
The new strategy involves an analysis of nationwide criminal investigations, particularly white collar crime, side by side with intelligence and terrorist activity. 
"We have developed an ability to look harder and broader in a greatly enhanced way to see if there is any crossover," Billy said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
Organized crime syndicates could facilitate money transfers or laundering, human smuggling, identification fraud or explosives and weapons acquisitions, offi­
cials said. The options are many for ter­rorists groups. 
There are the five reputed La Cosa Nostra families in New York, Russian criminal enterpris­es from Brighton Beach in the New York borough of Brooklyn to Moscow, and the emerging A<>ian crime syndicates that operate in many Islamic countries with al­Qaida offshoots. 
A contract study produced recently for the Pentagon and obtained by the AP warned that the potential for organized crime assisting terrorists is growing. 
"Although terrorism and organized crime are different phenomena, the important fact is that terrorist and criminal net­works overlap and cooperate in some enterprises," the study said. ''The phenomenon of the synergy of terrorism and organ­ized crime is growing because similar conditions give rise to both and because terrorists and organized criminals use similar approaches to promote their operations." 
The traditional mafia has high­ly developed networks for acquir­ing goods and services and money, all for a price. 
The mob's potential interest in helping a terrorist has nothing to do with ideology or sympathy but with greed, said Matt Heron, head of New York FBI's organ­ized crime unit. 
"They will deal with anybody, if they can make a buck," Heron said. "They will sell to a terrorist just as easily as they would sell to an order of Franciscan monks. It's a business relationship to them." 
"If the mob has explosives and a terrorist wants them and they have the money, they could become instant friends," he said. 
Pat D'Amuro, a retired senior FBI official and now chief execu­tive of Giuliani Security, said a Mafia boss once acknowledged that the mob would help terror­ists. 
"I am aware of a high-level Mafia figure, who was cooperat­ing with authorities, being asked if the Mafia would assist terror­ists in smuggling people into· Europe through Italy," D'Amuro said. "He said, 'The Mafia will help who ever can pay."'

FEMA Katrina trailers finally cleared for use 
Units could be sold or donated to various groups 
LIVE AND STUDY 
Associated Press 
OPE, Ark. -Nearly 10,000 emergency housing trailers that were intended to be sent to the Gulf Coast to help Hurricane Katrina victims have been freed up for other uses. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency parked the trailers at Hope Municipal Airport in the months following the hurricane. The agency came under criticism when the trailers sat empty. 
FEMA officials said that regula­tions against placing the homes in flood plains prevented their use on the Gulf Coast. 
On Friday, Congress approved a homeland security spending bill that included a provision allow­ing FEMA to sell or donate the trailers to municipalities, non­profit groups or American Indian tribes. 
Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., said he would prefer that the homes had gone to hurricane victims as originally intended, but selling or donating them to cities or com­munity groups was better than letting them sit unused. 
"Allowing the homes to sit and deteriorate at the airport is an abuse of taxpayer funding and should not be an option," Pryor said in a statement. 
Pryor and Rep. Mike Ross, D­Ark., sponsored the measures in their respective chambers before the provision went to a confer­ence committee. Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., added the option to convey the trailers to Indian tribes to house the home­less. 
"I am proud that the 9,778 fully furnished manufactured homes sitting in Hope, Arkansas, may fmally be put to good use," Ross said. "These are the kind of com­monsense solutions the American taxpayers expect and deserve." 
FEMA was directed to work with the Department of Interior to transfer the trailers to tribes, depending on need. 
Indian housing has been a problem for decades. According to a 2003 survey, an estimated 200,000 housing units are need­ed immediately in Indian country and approximately 90,000 Indian families are homeless or "under­housed." 
The Homeland Security Department's inspector general has said that U.S. taxpayers could be stuck with a mainte­nance bill of nearly $4 7 million a year for thousands of trailers that sit parked at sites around the country.

Unhealthy ads riddle youth sho\Vs 
Marketers could be contributing to increasing rates ofchildhood obesity 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO --When Susan Connor's 3-year-old son started humming the McDonald's jingle, a research project was born. 
Connor knew where he'd heard the fast food giant's catchy tune -on the Disney Channel during "The Wiggles," a show for preschoolers. 
"He had absorbed that from watching TV," said Connor, whose study on food ads aimed at toddlers appears in the October issue of Pediatrics. "It would be a marketer's dream to know they were that success­ful." 
Messages for high-fat, high­sugar foods permeate program­ming for preschoolers on Nickelodeon, the study found. On the Disney Channel's shows for the youngest children and even on Public Broadcasting Service shows such as "Sesame Street," companies woo tots' loyalty by linking logos, licensed characters and slogans with fun and happiness. 
Disney and PBS promote themselves as ad-free, but fast food companies dominated sponsor messages during pro­gramming for toddlers, Connor found, making up 82 percent of sponsor messages on PBS pre­school programming and 36 percent of messages on Disney's toddler block of shows. 
The clown character Ronald McDonald appears with shows for toddlers on Disney and PBS. And the cartoon mouse Chuck 
E. Cheese pops up alongside preschool programming on PBS. 
Connor, research manager of Cleveland's Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, said adults who haven't seen children's programs lately will be sur­prised by the findings. 
Advocates said the study adds to mounting evidence that food marketers are trying to hook the youngest children as lifelong customers. Promotions go both ways with TV characters from children's shows used on the packaging of sugary cereals, fruit-flavored snacks and other foods. 
Last week, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to study links between the ads, viewing habits and the rise of childhood obesi­ty. For now, marketing of food to children is unregulated. 
Previous studies have found that kids as young as 3 who see TV ads are more likely to request and eat advertised foods high in fat, sodium and sugar. American children from infancy to age 6 watch an aver­age of one hour of TV daily, and 8-to-18-year-olds watch an average of three hours daily. They see roughly 40,000 TV ads a year. 
"It's very concerning when childhood obesity is a major public health problem that pre­school programs are still being sponsored by fast food restau­rants and food that's not healthy for children," said Susan Linn of Harvard Medical School and a co-founder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. She was not involved in the study. 
Diane Levin, of Wheelock College who is also a co-founder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, criticized Disney and PBS for breaching viewers' trust. She supports limits on marketing of junk food to children too young to make critical judgments about advertising. 
"PBS has a special responsi­bility," said Levin, who was not involved in the study. With fed­eral funding threatened, Levin said, PBS has searched for new revenue, including from spon-


Fire alarms failing to wake sleeping children 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Children in deep sleep awoke to record­ings of their mothers' voices ­calling them by name and order­ing them out of their bedrooms -even if they slept through the beeping sound a smoke alarm makes, according to a small study. 
The study reaffirms previous research that shows what works for adults doesn't always work for children, said Dr. Gary Smith, one of the co-authors. 
"Clearly, the strategy that has been tried and true and used for years ... fails miserably for chil­dren," said Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Columbus Children's Hospital. 
The study of 24 children ages 6 to 12 found that 23 awoke to the recorded voice of their mother saying "(Child's first name)! (Child's first name)! Wake up! Get out of bed! Leave the room!" Fourteen of the children also awoke to the traditional tone alarm. One child didn't wake up to either. 
The children who woke up to the voice did so at a median time of 20 seconds, compared with three minutes for those who woke up to the tone, according to the study by Columbus Children's Hospital researchers being released Monday in Pediatrics. 
Both alarms were created using a large speaker and sounds measuring 100 decibels, about four times louder than lev­els used in standard home alarms, Smith said. 
The next step, he said, is to determine why children respond­ed to the voice alarm differently, whether they were responding to their names, their mothers' voic­es or the frequency at which the sound was delivered, which was lower than the frequency of a beeping alarm. 
Nancy Baron of Columbus said her daughter Maddie, who was 8 at the time of the study, awoke to the voice alarm in 15 to 20 sec­onds but slept through the tone alarm, while neither alarm woke her son Rhys, who was 7. 
"I was totally shocked," Baron said. "It was actually a little frightening to think what would happen if this was real." 
Funding for the study came from a grant from the Ohio Department of Public Safety's Division of Emergency Medical Services and the Ohio Emergency Medical Services Board.

PBS spokeswoman Lea Sloan said sponsors' messages don't interrupt programs and don't go longer than two minutes, 17 seconds per hour. PBS doesn't allow price information, product comparisons, depictions of chil­dren's products or superlative claims, Sloan said. 
"The content of these mes­sages is either in support of public television or around learning, education and social development," Sloan said in an e-mail. "Licensed characters or mascots often reinforce a posi­tive educational message and their appearance is limited to five seconds." 
Nickelodeon spokesman Dan Martinsen said the channel has reduced food ads during its "Nick Jr." block of programs for preschoolers by 20 percent in the last two years. 
Disney Channel spokeswoman Patti McTeague said sponsor messages are accepted "only when they are connected to a pro-social message." 
Chuck E. Cheese spokes­woman Brenda Holloway said the pizza restaurant chain's play areas promote physical activity, as do its ads. 
"Realistically, our research shows most children come to Chuck E. Cheese's to play and have fun," Holloway wrote in an e-mail. "We think that our PBS sponsorship announcements do promote physical activity and social interaction through play and learning, which we believe are appropriate messages for preschool-age children."

Research finds flaw-in infant death stats 
Danger of premature births emphasized 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA -Scientists now say a third of infant deaths are due to premature births -a much larger per­
centage  than  previously  
thought.  
In  the  past,  "preterm  

birth" has been the listed cause of death in fewer than 20 percent of newborn fatal­ities. But that number should be 34 percent or more, said researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
That's because at least a dozen causes of newborn death are actually problems that go hand-in-hand with premature births, such as respiratory distress syn­drome caused by underde­veloped lungs. 
"This brings preterm birth, as a cause of death, to the kind of level that we think it deserves," said the CDC's Dr. Bill Callaghan, the lead author of a study appearing Monday in the journal Pediatrics. 
The revised statistic may lead to greater efforts to counsel pregnant women about taking care of them­selves and avoiding actions that can lead to preterm births -such as smoking and drug use. 
It also may help organiza­tions lobbying for more research into why some women who follow medical advice still have preterm babies. The March of Dimes is advocating to expand fed­
eral research into preterm labor and delivery and the care and treatment of pre­mature infants. 
At issue is how to label the causes of deaths for infants who die before they reach their first birthday. 
"Preterm birth" generally describes infants who are born before 37 weeks gesta­tion, and the term is also used as an official cause of death. Two-thirds of infant deaths occur in children who were preterm, but their cause of death is often attributed to one of the sev­eral specific problems that can occur in preterm babies. 
"The only way that an infant gets assigned ("preterm birth") is if there's nothing else on the death certificate," said Callaghan, a senior scientist in the CDC's maternal and infant health branch. "That may result in an underestimation of what the real problem is." 
Callaghan and other researchers examined birth and death certificates for about 28,000 U.S. infants that died in 2002. 
About 4,600 of those -or 17 percent -were attrib­uted only to preterm birth. But the researchers also grouped in more than 5,700 other deaths that were attributed to preterm-relat­ed conditions including res­piratory distress syndrome, brain hemorrhage and maternal complications such as premature rupture of membranes.

American soldiers come home in body bags from Iraq on a morbidly regular basis. AIDS and civil strife tear apart Africa with ruthless impunity. Fresh lines are being drawn in the sand of the Middle East, divid­ing Israel and the Arab world. Unbridled violence dominates round­the-clock news and talking heads yell louder than ever at each other about anything that can be categorized as blue or red. So why in this world of mounting tensions, violence and casualties do I champion the abolition of the death penalty in the United States-which only claimed 60 lives in 2005 -over all these other issues? 
My simple answer is this: states are killing incarcerated criminals on behalf of its citizens and the execu­tions can stop whenever their respec­tive governors say so. It's going to take a lot more than a simple phone call to stop Hezbollah from hating Israel (contrary to President Bush's comments at the Great Eight summit). It will take decades to counter the damage that has been done by pover­ty, racism, disease and civil wars in Africa, and it will take more than interim election promises by chal­lengers and incumbents alike to solve the quagmire of Iraq. In contrast, all it takes to halt an execution, to stop the killing of an incarcerated person, is a phone call by a governor. That, to me, is what makes this issue constantly relevant: the degree of control and consent over the killing of an individ-

ual expressed by the public and state governments. The concept is startling; state governments are taking these people out of cells where they are locked up and killing them as an agent of U.S. citizens. Think about that for a moment. Sixty times last year, a pris­oner was taken from their controlled confinement, escorted to the waiting method of execution and killed. For you and for me. The states do this because this is what they think we want to have happen. Therefore, they are enacting our wishes as citizens. 
That being said, many of you are already formulating extremely reason­able questions and arguments in response to this line of thought: "Why should we have sympathy for these convicted murderers and rapists? Why is it our responsibility to speak for those who have committed heinous crimes against other human beings?" A good portion of you are likely in support of the death penalty and are internally reciting arguments based on the merits of execution as a legiti­mate means of delivering justice to those who have so brutally carried out these acts. 
I understand. 

I've had these thoughts many times and have held varying opinions until I really studied the topic and found myself with a steadfast stance against the death penalty. This opinion was grounded in facts and feelings alike, both in abstract morals and beliefs and in concrete statistics and studies. It is through a better understanding of the realities of the system of capital punishment, from trial through to the actual execution, that I arrived at the undeniable conclusion that capital punishment is inherently unjust, immoral and an unwarranted burden on states and their citizens alike.

My goal is not to convert you into a fellow critic of the death-penalty. We know too well that the inevitable, well-crafted response would sway you back in a few short days. My aim is not to throw statistics and numbers into this small space and claim that they speak for themselves. If that worked, this issue would be moot and this space could be filled with articles about fresh unexamined topics such as The Vagina Monologues and over­population. 
Instead, my intention is to invite all those interested in learning more about the death penalty and refining your beliefs through well-informed conversation to interact with the new campaign on campus: Notre Dame Against State Killing, or simply NO ASK. Its goal is to inform the Notre Dame community of valuable facts and opinions on the topic as well as facilitate continued discussion throughout the school year. Any inter­ested student, faculty or community member is invited to attend any meet­ing or lecture regardless of your stance. If the statistics, opinions and discussions presented don't sway you, you are encouraged to attend and explain your views. 
I for one am looking forward to a year of educated discussion on the death penalty and the insights, per­spectives and possible solutions that will inevitably arise from the Notre Dame community.

LETIER TO THE EDITOR 
Walk the walk? 
Are we walking the walk? I'm an '88 Notre Dame graduate and keep asking myself this question over and over. A midlife crisis, perhaps; growing wiser, certainly not; finding the importance in life, huh?? I would ask everyone in the Notre Dame com­munity to ask yourselves this question: "Are you walking the walk, are you wearing your faith on your sleeve and in your actions or are you hidden behind societal pressures?" We are ND. Notre Dame is a Catholic com­munity, which was brought together by our faith. This faith should be leading us in everything we do and be demonstrated on and off the football field. Is it? 
Last week, I watched the Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game with my young children. We watched with the same pas­sion we always do, and with a family new to our area who happened to be Michigan State fans and devout Catholics. Unfortunately, we were bombarded with repeated commercials for nearly naked women "desperate" to cheat on their hus­bands. Not one commercial, but several throughout the game. I could not believe ABC was using the Notre Dame football game to promote this trash. I assured this family, that this would outrage Notre Dame and that they would make a statement on Monday. I was sure the Notre Dame com­munity would take action. I am amazed nothing has come of this. Despite contacting high-ranking Notre Dame administration, ABC sports, ESPN and writing a letter to The Observer (which was not published), silence continues. Instead we hear of people not getting tickets, Notre Dame selling sea­son ticketc; to raise more money, the book­store making big money, a need for stadium improvement<; and the need for new run­ning backs. Have we become so numb to our surroundings that we do not see the messages being pushed on our society? Have we become complacent, and feel we can't make a difference? Are we really so focused on winning or losing a football game that we cannot see the devil lurking? Does the "entertainment" of these type of shows overshadow our moral judgment? 
You may see this as a minor deal and in the big picture with the state of our world, it is. However, if we are not willing to step for­ward, raise objection, walk the walk on issues such as these, how can we begin to attack the bigger threats to our future and our children's future? The myriad of issues which need moral leadership in our world are too numerous to count. 
We are ND. But what truly is Notre Dame? Is it a football team like most folks around our country think? Or is it a faith­filled community willing to take on the tough issues, no matter how big or how small? Next time you are in the stadium screaming, "We are ND" ask yourself what this means. Ask yourself what Notre Dame truly means and stands for. Notre Dame is much more than a football team. Notre Dame is a community of students, profes­sors, subway alumni and alumni who are willing to "walk the walk" of their faith. We are a community that demands more of our society and ourselves. 
I don't have the answers, am not attempt­ing to be righteous, and am far from per­fect. However, I have a strong faith and know that together as a community, Notre Dame can and should make a difference. We need to repair much more than Notre Dame Stadium in our world.

Republican candidates wary of associating themselves with an unpopular president are finding lower-profile ways to raise money through the Fundraiser-in-Chief.

Princetonian

In his White House press briefing on Wednesday, Snow said he was the first White House press secre­tary he knew of to participate in fundraisers. His participation, he said, was "unplowed ground." At first, I admit, I found the unplowed-ness of this ground surprising; the White House press secretary seems to be the perfect person to fundraise in the President's place. Who's better to pres­ent the President's face and agenda to eager, deep-pocketed donors than the guy who's so good at talking him up? Why hasn't anyone in this posi­tion, seemingly designed to defend the White House, gone on the stumping circuit? 
Because it's unethical. 

Firstly, Snow's participation in fundraisers may constitute a misuse of taxpayer dollars. While Snow has said that the Republican National Committee will pay for his travel and accommodations at fundraising events, it's unclear whether the RNC will remunerate taxpayers for salaried time Snow is using to stump rather than serve as White House press secretary. 
More importantly, the White House press secretary is a nonpartisan civil servant whose employer is the state and not the President or the President's party. His job is to collect information about what's happening inside the White House and dispense it to the media. Sure, at daily press briefings with the White House press corps, he also fields questions about White House policy and plans. Sure, he may spin this information to appease the man who hired him, but his primary responsibility, like that of the Cabinet members, is helping the government run more effectively, not gilding the President or his party.

Dear Must See TV, I will never abandon thee 
Dear NBC Must See TV Thursday, 
In light of your apparent comeback this year, I feel I must express my con­gratulations and relief that you are beginning your return to glory. I know it's been hard for you ever since "Friends" left you, but I wanted to let you know that I never gave up hope. You stood by my side as I grew from a girl into a woman, and for that I could never abandon you. But in order to achieve a better future, we must look to our past for mistakes made and lessons learned. And Must See TV Thursday, you've made quite a few mis­takes. 
You were so strong for so long. You created the perfect formula for Thursday night success -two hours of comedy plus one hour of drama. With comedies like "The Cosby Show," "Family Ties," "Cheers," "A Different World," "Frasier," "Seinfeld," "Will & Grace" and "Friends," you dominated Thursday nights. 
Then you always wrapped up the evening with dramas like "Hill Street Blues," "LA Law" and ultimately "ER." These were truly golden times. 
You then survived the loss of "Seinfeld," but another dreary inevitabil­ity was just around the corner ­"Friends" would end sooner or later. You needed to find a new comedy that would anchor your Thursday 8:00 p.m. time

slot. You tried to find it in the Americanized British import "Coupling" 
that sounded remarkably similar to the Generation X phenomenon "Friends" but you butchered that show like. you had butchered so many before it. Before you knew it, "Friends" was in its last season and you took an enormous risk by scheduling its spin-ofT "Joey" in its 
vacant time slot. 
This is when the death knell tolled. 
Not only did you assume that "Joey" would retain the massive "Friends" audience, but you took an even greater misstep when you abandoned your air­tight formula and scheduled "The Apprentice" in the 9:00p.m. time slot. You now had one hour of comedy, one hour of reality and one hour of drama. This cosmic unbalance plummeted NBC to fourth place and I blame you. I was confused and hurt because I didn't understand why you would abandon your roots for Donald Trump's non­toupee. 
You finally figured out your folly, but not before you lost viewers to other net­works. Now you're trying to recover, and I hope you do. But you're not done mak­ing mistakes yet. I'd like to give you my advice if you let me. I may not be a net­work executive, but I know what I want. And what I want is probably what other people want. 
First, you need to bring back your two­hour block of comedy. The fact that you even consider Howie Mandel as worthy to appear on Must See TV is insulting. Next, drop "ER" and replace it with "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip." Although "Studio 60" was originally set to appear before "ER," you chickened out and took it off Thursdays when you found out it had to compete with "Grey's Anatomy." I never thought I would see the day when you wouldn't stand your ground. Shame on you. 
Finally, move "The Oflice" to the 8:00 
p.m. time slot. It's your strongest come­dy, which I hope you figured out when it won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Next, schedule "30 Rock," "My Name is Earl" and "Scrubs" in that order. This leaves you with two solid hours of comedy, while giving "30 Rock" a chance to grab the audience watching "The Oflice." 
I hope this helps, Must See TV Thursday. You're doing better. You really 


Western reflects changing times of the late 1960s

When first released, "The Wild Bunch" was controversial for its ferocious vio­lence. Taking cues from Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and other counter­cultural pieces like "Bonnie and Clyde," the bloodshed is far more prevalent than in previous films -by no means does "The Wild Bunch" contain the subdued, implied violence of John Ford pictures. Instead, the film opens and closes with viciously memorable firefights, the latter of which has become one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history. While the violence seems relatively tame by today's standards, it was revolution­ary in 1969. 
The film is anchored by Holden's quiet­ly dignified performance as Pike. In fact, "The Wild Bunch" may be the actor's finest work, which is no small feat con­sidering his resume, which includes clas­sics like "Sunset Boulevard," "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "Network" and "Stalag 17," for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

Monday, October 2, 2006 BSERVER Notre Dame 35, Purdue 21 
Full steam ahead 
Irish dominate Boilermakers on the ground, through the air in 35-21 win 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Wrirer 
Charlie Weis finally got his wish. 
Notre Dame confused the Purdue defense with a variety of straight runs, passes and play­action fakes -something the Irish had failed to do in the past two games -en route to a 35­21 victory over the Boilermakers Saturday. 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn completed 29-of-38 passes for 316 yards with two touchdowns, and running back Darius Walker pounded, ducked and wove his way to 146 yards on 31 carries -both season highs for the jun­ior. 
Walker's six touches on Notre Dame's opening, seven-play drive set the tone for the rest of the game. After keeping Purdue on its heels with four runs and two screens to Walker, Weis called a play-fake and freshman wide receiver George West took the end-around 14 yards to the end zone for the game's first points. 
Notre Dame moved the ball with relative ease throughout the game, finishing with 169 yards on the ground -more than the team gained in its last two games combined. 
"I just felt that the last two weeks, as the play caller, that we had to give up on the run­ning game because we got behind," Weis said. "I just made ed punts after the initial Irish Carlson block five yards past the 398 yards and two touchdowns. for-16.

Notre Dame's time of possession advantage Saturday. 

Notre Dame spent four weeks of the 2006 season searching for the balance on offense it left somewhere in Palo Alto, Calif. last year. Well, the Irish found it Saturday -and in doing so, reminded the country why they were con­sidered such a juggernaut heading into the season. 
For the second straight year, Notre Dame clicked on all cylinders against an overmatched Purdue team. This was the perform­ance Irish fans have been waiting for after four weeks of searching for an identity. 
The passing game was precise (Quinn was 29-of-38 for 316 yards and two touchdowns), the receivers were in sync with their quarterback (McKnight had 10 catches for 120 yards), and the offensive line got great push against the Boilermakers defensive line. 
And then, of course, there was Darius Walker. 
Walker might have had his best game in a Notre Dame uniform given the circumstances. The Irish needed to establish a consistent running game after a three-week stretch in which they gained a total of 161 yards on the ground-some­thing Walker seemed to take per­sonally given his first half perform­ance. 
Walker touched the ball on Notre Dame's first six plays from scrim­mage and finished with 31 carries for 146 yards and a touchdown. He also had nine catches for 73 yards, and was on pace for over 300 total yards at halftime. 
When a team runs the ball, it con­trols the clock. And when it controls the clock, and subsequently the momentum, it's easier to win the

game. That's why Notre Dame get­
ting 40 carries for the first time this season was so meaningful. 
With Walker dictating the pace, Quinn was able to settle into his most efficient performance of the season. Quinn looked comfortable right from the beginning, and the first-half communication problems that hampered the Irish quarter­back and his receivers at Michigan State were absent. 
Granted, Quinn was picking apart an inexperienced secondary that was overmatched by McKnight's simultaneous strength in running hitch routes and going up for deep balls. But with the accuracy he was delivering the football, many pol­ished secondaries would have encountered similar problems. 
What's more, Notre Dame's offense compensated for defensive problems that plagued the team throughout the game. The Irish gave up 498 yards of total offense and allowed Purdue receiver Selwyn Lymon to go for 238 yards and two touchdowns. 
Charlie Weis and Rick Minter will look at this tape knowing that 398 yards passing from an inexperi­enced quarterback (Saturday was Curtis Painter's lOth career start) is a concern. Notre Dame needs to find a way to put more consistent pres­sure on opposing quarterbacks so they have less time to run through their progressions. 
The Irish will likely address this in practice this week before it begins a two-game stretch against the pass friendly Pac-1 0 conference. 
But the most important thing to emerge from Saturday was this sense of offensive consistency and balance. Notre Dame's defense is still a work in progress, but given the team's upcoming schedule, it has plenty of time to work out its kinks. 
And the offense will have ample time to build upon Saturday's progress. 
Over the next seven weeks, Notre Dame plays Stanford, UCLA, Navy, North Carolina, Air Foree and Army -not exactly a murderers row of talent. The six teams are a com­bined 12-14. 
What happens in these six games should make Notre Dame fans for­get about its early season struggles. 
Written off by many experts as the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy, Quinn will build on his 13 touchdowns quickly in this time. Thirty-five touchdowns in 11 games (an additional 22 in the following six) won't be out of reach. 
Jeff Samardzija-who has been limited to some extent this season ­should get his reception totals up from the 27 he has so far this sea­son. 
And Walker, who looked slow and indecisive for three weeks leading up to Saturday, suddenly has put himself in position to have another 1 ,000-yard season. With weaker defenses than the Irish saw against Georgia Tech, Penn State and Michigan, Walker has the tough opponents behind him. 
Why is all this important? 
Because once this six-game stretch is over, Notre Dame will face its biggest challenge of the season -a trip to Southern California. The Trojans are getting better with each week, and using the momentum from their tight win at Washington State, they'll likely roll through the rest of the Pac-1 0 season. 
But Notre Dame, following its offensive execution against Purdue, could also enter the game with the same confidence that comes from eight straight victories. And if the Irish can muster the same type of balance it found Saturday, that game could get interesting.

Walker runs all over Boilermakers 
Tailback shows no sign of slump, gains 219 total yards 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 
Brady Quinn threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns, and Rhema McKnight caught a career-high ten passes for 120 yards. But running back Darius Walker carried the offense Saturday. 
Walker carried the ball 31 times for 146 
yards -both season highs ~ and rushed 
for a touchdown in No. 12 Notre Dame's 
35-21 win over Purdue. His yardage total 
surpassed his combined totals of the last 
three games, where he had managed only 
128 yards on 41 carries, and it marked his 
10th career 100-yard game. 
The performance was his second-best 
career rushing total and his first 100-yard 
game since the 2005 regular season fmale 
against Stanford when he picked up a per­
sonal-best 186 yards on 35 carries. But his 
effectiveness wasn't limited to the ground. 
Walker also caught 9 passes for 73 yards 
-both career highs -and he is now tied 
with wide receiver Rhema McKnight for 
the tnam lead in receptions with 32.

Downloading ruins full album experience 
Songs and cover art ignored with steady spread of digital music 
By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Writer 

Getting music is so easy nowadays it doesn't even take the effort of standing up. Whip out a credit card, connect to the Internet, click a button and there it is -downloaded and ready for you listen to. 
Downloading has changed the face of the music industry -the famous Billboard magazine has adjusted its rat­ing system to account for digital sales, pirating of music still puts music produc­ers on edge, and even Wal-Mart has launched a system for buying digital music (sorry Apple aficionados, its 88 cent songs are not compatible with your iPod). 
Consumers can get music faster, cheap­er and much more conveniently by downloading instead of purchasing an actual CD. But this has also changed the way we experience and how we listen to music. Our auditory culture seems to be regressing to a time where hit-singles dominated sales and determined the music industry's direction. People are lis­music players, but they mostly utilize the device's shuffle features. The entire con­cept of an iPod shuffle is not to listen to any album, but to listen to a mixture of randomly selected songs. Aptly, the Grammy's only awarded album art dur­ing its heights, from 1959-1961 and 1969-1973. This trend in reducing albums to singles sadly breaks the integrity of these albums. 

Sadly, album art has fallen to the way­

CHICAGO -The Chicago Bears showed how serious they are about contending for the NFC title, dominat· ing the defending confer· ence champions. 
Rex Grossman threw for 232 yards and Ricky Manning Jr. intercepted two of Matt Hasselbeck's passes to lead Chicago to a 
37-6  victory  over  the  
Seattle  Seahawks  on  
Sunday night.  

Grossman had another solid performance, com­pleting 17 of 31 passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions, and the Bears improved to 4-0 for the first time since 1991. Bernard Berrian had three receptions for a career-high 108 yards and a touch­down. 
The Bears also got their running game going after three sluggish performanc· es, with Thomas Jones rushing for 98 yards and two touchdowns. 
And the league's fourth­ranked defense shut down a Seahawks team that was missing injured running back Shaun Alexander. 
With the Bears leading 10-3, Manning intercepted Hasselbeck twice in the second quarter to set up a field goal and touchdown. 
Hasselbeck was 16-of-35 for 196 yards and did not throw a touchdown, after tying a franchise record with five scoring passes the previous week in a 42-30 victory over the New York Giants. He was sacked five times -including twice each by Tommie Harris and Mark Anderson. 
Maurice Morris started for Alexander and carried 11 times for 35 yards. 
The league MVP, Alexander had been both­ered by a bruised bone in his left foot before it cracked during last week's win over the Giants. Still, he hoped to play, saying the power of prayer had healed him and even jumping around for coach Mike Holmgren. A second round of tests on Wednesday showed the bone was still broken, so he sat for the first time since being draft­ed in 2000, and Morris

Mauer becomes first catcher 
to win AL hitting crown 
NEW YORK -Joe Mauer became the first catcher to win the American League batting title, going 2-for-4 for the Minnesota Twins on the final day of the regular season to hold off the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter. 
Mauer's doubled and singled against the Chicago White Sox, leav­ing his average at .347 down from a high of .392 on July 1 but good enough to best Jeter, who went 1-for­5 against Toronto and wound up at .343. 
"You couldn't really not think about it," Mauer said. "There were so many questions. Scores on the board, peo­ple saying you need to do this, do that. I've never been so nervous in my life. I'm just happy it's all over with and we're here celebrating." 
Mauer became the first catcher to win a batting title in either league since Ernie Lombardi hit .330 for the 1942 Boston Braves. 
Titans lineman Haynesworth stomps on Cowboys center 
DALLAS -Cowboys center Andre Gurode needed stitches above his forehead and beneath his eye Sunday after being kicked twice by Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth. 
The incident occurred after Dallas had taken a a two-touchdown lead in the third quarter. 
Gurode's helmet came off after the scoring play, a 5-yard run by Julius Jones, and Haynesworth, standing over him, used his right foot to kick Gurode in the head. 
Gurode said they hadn't been talk· ing or having any exchanges that led to Haynesworth kicking him twice. 
"In all my years of football, this has never happened to me," Gurode said. ''I've never seen anybody kick nobody else in the face." 
Haynesworth, who was ejected, expects to be disciplined. 
"What I did out there was disgust· ing," Haynesworth said. 
made the fifth start of his career. 
The Seattle defense took a hit in the second quarter, when safety Michael Boulware suffered a con· cussion while breaking up a pass intended for Chicago's John Gilmore at the Seattle 1. 
Sunday's game was the ninth between the two teams and their first in three years. 
The Bears thought they were on course to meet Seattle in the playoffs last season, when they earned a first-round bye, but Carolina knocked them off at Soldier Field. The Seahawks beat the Panthers the next week to advance to the Super Bowl. 
Trahan takes home State Farm title on third playoff hole 
MADISON, Miss-D.J. Trahan was­n't happy with his putting Sunday until he got to a playoff in the Southern Farm Bureau Classic. 
After finishing regulation with a par to force the playoff with Joe Durant, Trahan put on an overtime putting clinic, birdieing the par-S 18th three straight times in sudden death to win his first PGA Tour title. 
"Nothing really changed to be honest with you," Trahan said. "I was stroking the ball the same. I made the putts on 17 and 1made the putts in the playoffs. I didn't feel like I was stroking it any different or my mentality with the putter was any different. But fortu­nately for me those putts were going in, unlike the ones earlier in the day." 
Trahan won with a 5-foot birdie putt on the third extra hole after closing with a 1-under 71 to match Durant 
(66) at 13-under 275 on the Annandale Golf Club course.

Emotional MacPhail resigns as Cubs CEO 
President apologizes 
for lack of success over his twelve years 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -An emotional Andy MacPhail resigned Sunday as president and CEO of the Chicago Cubs after failing to get the team to the World Series during his 12-year tenure. 
"This is the first thing I've ever done in baseball that I did­n't have a high level of success at," MacPhail said, his voice cracking. 
The Cubs have made just two playoff appearances since MacPhail joined them in 1994 after he spent nine years with the Minnesota Twins, leading them to two World Series titles. Chicago finished its season Sunday at 66-96, the worst record in the NL. 
"The clock on the MacPhail a­meter has run down to zero," said MacPhail, who told reporters he broached the sub­ject of resigning during a team review with Tribune Co. execu­tives in midseason. "It's not just that we had a terrible season. I've been here 12 seasons and only two postseason (appear­
I ances) and to me that's not what I came here to do.
I Obviously, I've not been as 
I effective as I wanted to be."
I Marketing vice president John McDonough will take over the club's day-to-day operation on an interim basis. MacPhail will stay on through the transition and do his work for the major league baseball negotiating committee. MacPhail's grandfather and father were longtime baseball executives, and both are in the Hall of Fame. "I've been in the. business my entire life. I was born to it," MacPhail said. ''I've done just about everything imaginable in it from selling program space in Midland, Texas, to scouting in the Midwest league, to being a GM, a president, negotiating a

collective bargaining agree­ment. 
"There is one rule that applies to everything. You've got to win and if you don't win, it's subject to change." 
Since MacPhail took over, the Cubs won the NL wild card in 1998 and the NL Central in 2003, when they fell five outs short of making the World Series. 
The Cubs, who had a payroll of approximately $95 million this season, haven't been to the World Series since 1945. They haven't won one since 1908. 
"This is a baseball decision. It's an issue of making sure our fans know that we are commit­ted to winning," said Tribune Co. chairman, president and CEO Dennis Fitzsimons, adding his company has no plans to sell the Cubs. "Andy MacPhail has been committed to winning. For whatever reasons, it didn't work out.... Andy said it best, we both felt we needed a change." 
MacPhail couldn't repeat his baseball success from Minnesota despite a bigger pay­roll with a big-market team whose shrine-like home field is nearly always sold out or close to it. MacPhail was instrumental in a bleacher expansion project for Wrigley Field that was com­pleted for the 2006 season. 
Injuries played a big role the last several years, especially to the pitching staff, most notably Kerry Wood and Mark Prior. And 2005 NL batting champion Derrek Lee played in only 50 games this season after break­ing his wrist and then attending to his daughter's health issues. 
"Too much payroll has been sitting on the sideline. Nobody's fault," MacPhail said. "There has been too much of it and it hasn't been able to be applied on the field. Nothing in the way of excuses, just fact." 
But poor play was also a part of his tenure and MacPhail acknowledged that while the Cubs had done a good job of developing pitchers, they hadn't done so with position players.

Tiger wins sixth in a row 
Woods easily takes 
, 
American Express leading wire-to-wire 
Associated Press 
CHANDLER'S CROSS, 
England -Good news for the 
rest of golf: Tiger Woods is 
going on vacation. 
A streak that began 10 
weeks ago on the sun-baked 
links of Hoylake reached six 
straight PGA Tour victories on 
the rain-drenched fairways 
north of London on Sunday 
when Woods went wire-to­
wire in the American Express 
Championship. He became 
the first player in tour history 
to win at least eight times in 
three seasons. 
Threatened only by. the weather that twice delayed the inevitable, Woods closed with a 4-under 67 for an "eight-shot victory over Adam 
Scott and Ian Poulter. 
"He's dominating the 
game," Scott said. "It's not the 
first time he's done it, either." 
The trophy in hand, Woods 
had one foot in a courtesy car 
that was ready to take him 
away when he took a few 
questions from the BBC. Arter 
playing seven times in the last 
nine weeks, he was eager to 
get home to Florida. 
''I'm getting away for a little 
bit," Woods said. "As far as 
golf, I've had enough of it for 
a while." 
This might have been his 
most dominating performance 
since the streak began at the 
British Open in July, and not 
just because the eight-shot 
victory was his largest margin 
the morning...

since winning by 11 at the 
2003 Bay Hill Invitational. 
Woods had such control 
over his game that he was 
third in driving distance and 
fifth in driving accuracy, 
missing only 12 fairways all 
week. And during one stretch, 
he hit 36 consecutive greens 
in regulation, a streak that 
ended when his approach on 
the 12th hole drifted left and 
into a bunker for his only 
bogey of the final round. 
One other streak ended on 
the last hole of the tourna­
ment _ it was the first time all 
week he failed to make eagle 
on the 567~yard closing hole 
at The Grove. His chip from 
just short of the green scoot­
ed by the cup and stopped a 
few feet away for a tap-in 
birdie that put him at 23­
under 261. 
"This was a fun week," he ·said. "I hit the ball really well 
_ all 72 holes, really. It's fun 
when you can control your 
golf ball that well." 
In a week remembered for 
the death of Byron Nelson, it 
rekindled curiosity whether 
Lord Byron's record in 1945 
of 11 consecutive victories 
really is untouchable. 
Woods wasn't ready to 
touch that one _yet. 
"It's still a long way away," 
he said with a laugh. "If you 
look at it, I'm barely halfway. 
What he did was absolutely 
remarkable, and I'm just 
thrilled that I've been able to 
win six in a row twice. That 
to me is a pretty neat accom­
plishment in itself." 
Woods won the final four 
PGA Tour events in 1999 and 
his first two starts in 2000 to 
match Ben Hogan (1948) for 

the second-longest winning streak on the PGA Tour. 
He passed Nelson, Hogan, Sam Snead and Arnold Palmer with his 'third PGA Tour season of at least eight victories. Woods won eight times in 1999 and nine times in 2000. 
And he has at least one tournament left the Tour Championship. 
Woods probably won't decide until the last minute whether to play Disney in three weeks. Skipping that tournament, which has never been his favorite, would leave him one round short of being eligible for the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average. 
Asked how much that award meant, Woods replied, "Not much." 
"I've had a good year," he said. "But if you don't play enough rounds, you don't play enough rounds." 
He might come up short because of missing the cut at the U.S. Open for the first time in a major. That was his first tournament back since his father died of cancer in May, and Woods has been nearly unstoppable since then. 
The only two tournaments he didn't win was the Western Open (a tie for second) and the World Match Play Championship two weeks ago at Wentworth, a European Tour event that does not count toward his PGA Tour streak. 
Woods successfully defend­ed his title for the fifth time this year, and he is 1 0-of-15 in World Golf Championships that are stroke play.

NFL-WRAPS 
Manning's late QB sneak gives Colts victory 
Patriots use balanced offensive attack, two rushing touchdowns from Maroney to destroy favored Bengals 
Associated Press 
EAST HUTHERFORD, N.J.­Peyton Manning watched the fourth-quarter lead his Colts had just taken vanish in a flash when the New York Jets returned the ensuing kickoff 103 yards. 
Cool, calm and ever the leader, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback just jogged back on the field with a little more than 2 minutes left and took charge. 
"There truly never was any panic," Manning said. "When they ran the kickoff back, we were just getting back on the bench. We didn't have time to get mad or to panic." 
They certainly had plenty of time to ruin the Jets' victory plans. 
After Justin Miller's 103-yard dash gave New York the lead with 2:20 left, Manning led Indianapolis on the type of effi­cient drive that has defined his career -capping it with a 1­yard run that gave the Colts a wild 31-28 victory Sunday. 
Manning was 6-of-8 for 60 yards on the drive, including a 19-yard pass to Marvin Harrison and a 15-yarder to Reggie Wayne that put the ball at the 1. Running the no-huddle offense, Manning then took the ball and pushed himself into the end zone. 
"I was pumped," Manning said. "You practice those two­minute drills all the time. Everybody's played that back­yard game where you envision the last play of the game. Anytime you can do it in New York, it adds a little something to it." 
Patriots 38, Bengals 13 
Rookie running back Laurence Maroney got New England's offense rolling like old times. 
Maroney ran for 125 yards and a pair of touchdowns Sunday, restoring balance to the Patriots' off-keel offense and setting up a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals that had a familiar feel. 
"Kind of like the Patriots you guys were used to seeing," smil­ing quarterback Tom Brady said. 
Only a week earlier, New England (3-1) was so pitiful on offense that Brady uncharacter­istically waved his arms in frus­tration during a loss to Denver. The only time he lifted his arms Sunday was to signal another Patriots touchdown. 
Maroney got the biggest ones. 

Playing on the field where teammate Corey Dillon broke the single-game rushing record for Cincinnati in 2000, Maroney dodged and stiff-armed his way through the Bengals (3-1) on touchdown runs of 11 and 25 yards that set the tone. 
"We knew coming in that the running game was going to play a major part in the game," said Maroney, who ran for only 18 yards against Denver. "That was No. 1 on our list -get the running game going." 
Ravens 16, Chargers 13 
The Baltimore Ravens have a new formula for success: Keep the game close enough for Steve McNair to win it at the end. 
McNair rallied the unbeaten Ravens for a second straight week Sunday, throwing a 10­yard pass to Todd Heap with 34 seconds left to defeat the San Diego Chargers. 
In years past, the Ravens depended on their defense to squash the opposition, leaving the offense to do little else but avoid giving the ball away. Now that McNair is at quarterback, late-game heroics are becoming the standard. 
"There was no doubt in my inind we would win this game when No. 9 went out there," said Ravens cornerback Samari Holle, who played with McNair in Tennessee. "He's been through everything you can be through as a quarterback. He's been MVP. He's been in the Super Bowl. He's just got it." 
Showing precisely why they obtained him in an offseason trade with the Titans, McNair went 4-for-5 for 43 yards and ran once for 12 yards during the final drive, which began after San Diego intentionally took a safety with 3:12 to go. 
McNair never faced a third down during the march. After a 17-yard pass to Mark Clayton got the ball to the San Diego 35, McNair ran to the 23 and com­pleted a 13-yarder to Clayton. 
On second down, McNair found Heap for the game-win­ner, leaving the Ravens at 4-0 for the first time. 
"If we don't make enough plays to win early, we can make plays to win the game late," linebacker Ray Lewis said. "That's why we brought him here." 
Redskins 36, Jaguars 30 (OT) 
In the first quarter, Washington Redskins receiver Santana Moss made a spin move that left Jacksonville Jaguars safety Deon Grant sprawled on the grass at the 11-yard line. 
In the fourth quarter, Moss caught a pass and darted inside just in time to make cornerback Brian Williams whiff near the goal line. 
Then in overtime, Moss dust­ed Grant and Williams at the same time, leaving them flat­footed on a 68-yard game-win­ning catch down the left side­line. 
Three dazzling touchdowns. 
With a playmaker like that, Mark Brunell didn't have to gloat about beating his old team -all he had to do was throw in No. 89's direction and watch his old colors look silly trying to make a tackle. Brunell-to-Moss resurrected the Redskins' sea­son last year, and the combo came to life again in Sunday's 36-30 victory. 
"He's the best after the catch I've played with," Brunell said. "He's exciting to watch. There's nothing he can't do." 
Moss finished with four recep­tions for 138 yards, including TD catches of 55, 8 and 68 yards. Clinton Portis ran 27 times for 112 yards and a touchdown, becoming the first back in 13 games to get 100 against the Jaguars. 
Panthers 21, Saints 18 
Six days after their emotional return to New Orleans, the Saints were due for a letdown. 
They still gave Carolina all it could handle -until Steve Smith got loose late. 

Jake Delhomme threw a 4­yard touchdown pass to Drew Carter midway through the fourth quarter to put the Panthers ahead to stay as Carolina handed New Orleans its first loss of the season Sunday. 
"We didn't come in here thinking there was going to be a letdown," cornerback Fred Thomas said. "We came in here emotional and played." 
But Thomas had trouble con­taining Smith. 
The All-Pro caught three passes for 35 yards on a 91­yard drive. Then, with the Saints focusing on Smith and Keyshawn Johnson, Delhomme lobbed a 4-yard pass to a wide open Carter to put Carolina ahead 14-10 with 7:15left. 
"Most definitely he wasn't 100 percent," Thomas said of Smith, who missed the first two games with a strained ham­string. "The guy is a competi­tor. He gets respect from around the league. He gets much respect from me." 
DeShaun Foster's 43-yard touchdown run on third down with 1:45 left made it 21-10, with Johnson, brought in to give Smith help this season, throwing a big block. 
Texans 17, Dolphins 15 
On the brink of his first win as coach of the Houston Texans, Gary Kubiak couldn't bear to look. 
Too bad, because if he'd turned around he would have seen No. 1 draft pick Mario Williams make a game-saving play. Williams tipped a two­point conversion that would have tied the game and finally got his first sack as the Texans beat Miami on Sunday. 
The Dolphins trailed 17-9 when Daunte Culpepper found Chris Chambers for a 16-yard touchdown with 1:39 to go to pull within two. Miami went for the 2-point conversion, but the pass by running back Ronnie Brown was tipped by Williams and sailed over Chambers' head. 
"He threw it and I just reached up and tipped it," Williams said. "I was in the right place at the right time." 
The Dolphins (1-3) tried an onside kick and almost recov­ered, but the ball squirted out from underneath Keith Adams and the Texans fell on it and ran out the clock. 
Cowboys 45, Titans 14 
As long as Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn are connecting for touchdowns, they don't mind when Terrell Owens gets all the attention. 
In a game that featured the return of T.O. and the first NFL start of Tennessee rookie Vince Young, Bledsoe and Glenn hooked up on two 13-yard touchdown passes Sunday and the Dallas Cowboys beat the Titans. 
Bledsoe sees Owens, the five­time Pro Bowl selection, and Glenn, his former teammate with New England, as the best tandem of receivers he has had. Still, Owens is the one who draws extra defensive help. 
"When Owens is out there, [Glenn] gets single coverage and you can't cover him one-on­one," Bledsoe said. 
Owens did, indeed, play with his broken right hand protected by a plate and a glove only five days after his hospital visit for an accidental overdose. He caught five passes for 88 yards but also dropped a pass in the end zone he couldn't pull in with his injured hand. 
"He caught a couple balls," Dallas coach Bill Parcells said. "You were there. What do you think? I was pleased with the offense."

Saint Mary's takes third 
Belles finish behind Olivet, Tri-State on Blackthorn course 
By REBECCA SLINGER 
SportS Writer 
The Belles continued their early run of success this sea­son with a third-place finish at the MIAA Jamboree on their home course, South Bend's Blackthorn Country Club, Saturday. 
The Belles placed behind first-place Olivet {334) and Tri-State (356), firing a 76­over par 364, but stayed ahead of five other teams in the conference-wide competi­tion. 
Saint Mary's freshman Kate Doornbos led the team, post­ing an 87 {15-over par) en route to a sixth place finish. Sophomore co-captain Alex Sei posted the second lowest score on the team, shooting an 89 to place eighth overall. 
"I was hitting a lot of my balls in regulation," Doornbos said of her per­formance. "That's more than I normally do so I think that helped." 
Saint Mary's sophomores Katie Mcinerney and Meredith Fantom and fresh­man Joanna Dick, who shot 93, 95 and 99 respectively, also contributed to the Belles' 
third-place showing. Freshmen Theresa Tonyan, 
(115) and Caroline Doubek 
(134) entered the tournament as individuals. 
Belles sophomore Perri Hamma was forced to with­draw after sustaining a minor injury. 
A 30 minute rain delay forced a late start to the tournament. Doornbos said the delay made it hard to "get going" after the rain delay. 
"It did give the team a chance to rest though," Ham m a said. 

Belles were still able to put in strong performances to improve their finish by one place from the last Jamboree tournament, the Comet Classic. 
"We worked really hard on our weaknesses in practice," Hamma said. 
During last week's prepara­tions, the team played the course several times instead of holding their practice at the driving ranges.

Saint Mary's played two strikingly different matches Friday at the Adrian Triangular. 
The Belles came out strong against Albion, winning in four games (30-2 4, 24-30, 30-23, 30-23). Senior Kristen Playko led the Belles with 17 kills, and freshman Lorna Slupczynski added ten more of her own. 
The second match was lot tougher for Saint Mary's and ended in a frustrating loss to 
Adrian. The host Bulldogs posted a 3-1 victory (24-30, 30-19, 30-21, 30-141. led by 18 kills by Lindsay Eshelman. Slupczynksi post­ed ten kills in the match for Saint Mary's. 
Senior Libero Anne Cusack talley a combined 49 digs in the two matches.

defender Kim Lorenzen] won a ball at midfield," Hanks said of the goal. "Then [senior mid­fielder Jen Buczkowski! made a nice pass and I was just in the right place at the right time." 
Hanks' goal was her team­leading seventh of the season. 
The Mountaineers controlled most of the first half and got on the board before the Irish. Sophomore midfielder Amanda Cicchini rocketed a shot past Irish keeper Lauren Karas in the 17th minute, ending Notre Dame's five-game shutout streak. 
"We made a mistake and left [Cicchini] unmarked," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said of the goal. 
The Mountaineers had sever­al other first half chances but couldn't convert. 
"The defense saved our butts in the first half," freshman for­ward Michele Weissenhofer said. 
Trailing 1-0 at halftime, Waldrum knew he had to make some changes. 
"We didn't have patience," Waldrum said. "We weren't holding it long enough for the forwards to get free. In the sec­ond half, we tried to get to ball to [sophomore forward] Brittany [Bock] and let her turn and distribute." 
Waldrum said the offensive adjustment was a play the Irish had practiced during the week. 
"[Bock] did a great job in that spot for us tonight," he said. 
Four minutes into the second half, the Irish used Bock's dis­tribution to even the score. Weissnehofer took a pass from Bock on the right side of the West Virginia penalty area and put in the seventh goal of her young career. The Irish also hit the back of the net in the 17th minute of the second half, but the goal was disallowed after a foul call on Notre Dame. 
The game featured five yel­low cards and several other hard fouls. Waldrum said the quality of the two teams and the importance of the game caused the physical play. 
"There was a lot at stake and two good teams going at it out there," he said. 
The second largest women's soccer crowd in Notre Dame history -3,046 people ­watched the contest despite the rain and cold. A large student section, comprised mainly of residents of Stanford and O'Neill Halls, stood behind the Mountaineer net the whole game and heckled Bannerman. 
"I can't thank them enough," Waldrum said of the fans. "That was huge. You could tell they had [the keeper] rattled. It lifted the whole atmosphere of the stadium." 
Notre Dame 5, Pittsburgh 0 
Notre Dame started another scoreless streak Sunday, beat­ing Pittsburgh 5-0 -only allowing one shot in the process. 
With a 2-0 lead early in the second half, Hanks set up two goals for Weissenhofer less than three minutes apart to put the game out of reach. 
The sophomore then added the fmal Irish goal in the 73rd minute, taking a Buczkowski pass to the left of the net and slipping a shot between Panther's goalkeeper Alison Finch and the post. 
"I thought Kerri this weekend looked a lot more in her rhythm, the way she played for us last season as a freshman," Waldrum said. "I think today it's nice to get the goals and stuff, but I thought Kerri did a great job just being very unselfish. Some of the little seams she found, she was just finding those little spaces to get people in." 

After totaling 34 goals and 16 assists last year, the forward entered the game with seven scores this season and just one assist. According to Hanks, that relative lack of productivity had started to eat at her. Now that she helped Notre Dame keep its record unblemished, that tension has eased. 
"I was getting a little down on myself because as a goal scorer I'm supposed to score goals," she said. "But I realized as the season goes on, I don't care if I score anymore as long as we're still winning. If we're undefeated that's all you can ask for. So if someone else [scores] that's perfectly line as long as we're still winning." 
In the 31st minute, Pittsburgh midfielder Corina Sebesta fired a direct kick into the arms of Karas. The shot ended an Irish streak of 106 minutes without allowing an opposing shot on goal dating back to Friday's game. 

The Irish were able to control the Panthers, even though the starting lineup was missing regulars like Jill Krivacek, Cinalli and Weissenhofer to keep Irish legs fresh, before massive substitutions midway through the half. 
With their starting lineup in the game, Notre Dame capital­ized on an own goal when Buczkowski crossed a ball near ­Bock that Panther defender Katie Surma knocked into the net. In the 54th minute, senior defender Christie Shaner's cross found Bock's head before passing the bottom corner of the goal to take a 2-0 lead. 
Pittsburgh coach, and former Irish assistant, Sue-Moy Chin was disappointed in the out­come, but admitted the chal­lenge the Panthers faced. 
"We did a good job of playing but it was sporadic," she said. "The Irish are good. When they put you under pressure, it's hard to get out of it." 
The Irish return to action next weekend against Seton Hall and Hutgers at Alumni Field.

Bobby Clark downplayed his team's victory. 
"It's a good game to win, but I don't think I'll read anymore than that into it right now," Clark said. "There will be other big games to win. !Saturday! was an excellent win, and now we move on to the next game." 
As usual, it was junior for­ward Joseph Lapira providing the spark for the Notre Dame offense. Lapira tallied goals in the 10th and 71st minute to give him 13 on the season, nine more than the next highest Irish scorer. Lapira has scored two goals in three consecutive games, and he has five team. Rellas, with his assist on the first goal, and Thomas, with his assist on Lapira's second goal, tallied their first career points in an Irish uniform. 
Rellas, who has been the main beneficiary in terms of playing time since senior mid­fielder Ian Etherington sus­tained a severe bone bruise in his leg, has pleased Clark with his play. 
"Cory has played well all sea­son, and wherever he's been put, he's played exceptionally well," Clark said. "He has that quiet confidence and a tremen­dous work rate. He's been superb this season." 
While the Irish offense, led by Lapira, has been stellar recent­ly, the Notre Dame defense has been equally impressive as of late. Ineluding their shut-out

"Cahill wasn't overworked (against Seton Hall). but he's playing with great confidence," said Clark. "He's settled into the position, and he's giving our back four reassurance." 
Notre Dame will return to action this Wednesday night against Michigan in Ann Arbor. The Irish will enter that game riding a three-game winning streak and a four-game unbeat­en streak. 
"We're coming together as a team," Clark said. "It doesn't happen in the first couple weeks of the season, but we're building confidence and we're starting to come together."

Brown gets SOOth career win as squad beats Seton Hall 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame head coach Debbie Brown earned her 500th career win Saturday with a victory over Seton Hall -a team to whom Brown and the Irish have never lost. 
The Irish (9-5, 3-0 Big East) swept the Pirates (9-7, 1-2 Big East) 30-22, 30-22, 30-24 Saturday to win their third 
straight match. 

Notre Dame is now in a three-way tie for first place in the Big East with St. John's (4-0) and South Florida (2-0). 
Junior co-captain Adrianna Stasiuk blasted a match-lead­ing 12 kills and also record­ed 10 digs. 
It was Stasiuk's tenth dou­ble-double of the season and she now has 169 total kills ­four behind team leader Christina Kaelin. 
Senior co-captain Danielle Herndon tallied 19 digs -the 12th time this season the Iibera has led the Irish in that category. 
The Irish defense stif1ed the Pirate attack and held them to 
a .091 hitting percentage ­the lowest Notre Dame has held an opposing offense to since Nov. 19, 2005 against Cincinnati. Notre Dame shot .225 for the three games. 
Notre Dame parried a late 
Seton Hall comeback in the third game to take the match on a kill from freshman Megan Fesl that was assisted by freshman Jamel Nicholas. 
The Pirates went on a small run to reduce the Irish lead to 23-19, but Notre Dame went on a 7-5 run to close out the match. 
Seton Hall had a strong start to the first game, open­ing up a 9-5 lead before the Irish could respond. 

Consecutive kills from Stasiuk put the Irish back in the lead in a big way. The score climbed to 21-12 before the Pirates recovered and moved within four points. 
A 6-1 run closed out the opening game with a kill from sophomore Justine Stremick as the game-winner. 
A strategic timeout salvaged the second game for the Irish

By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
Notre Dame took another giant step in their ascent up the Big East's Blue Division Standings on Saturday with a 2-0 win over first-place Seton Hall at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
The Irish win, combined with other Big East results, leaves Notre Dame in a three-way tie for second place with the Pirates and Providence. All three teams trail first-place West Virginia by one point.

Notre Dame's shutout streak ended Friday night, but its win­ning streak didn't. 
ND Sophomore forward Kerri Hanks broke a 1-1 tie with a header with 16:47 left in the game for the winning goal. Senior Amanda Cinalli added an insurance score with four min­utes left to give Notre Dame (11-0, 4-0 Big East) a 3-1 mar­gin over previously unbeaten No. 6 West Virginia (9-1-2, 3-1­1 Big East) on a blustery night at Alumni Field.

Irish struggle against top-ranked opponents 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame ran hard, but in the end it wasn't enough. 
Both the Irish men's and women's teams faced tough fields Friday at the Notre Dame Invitational, but only the men were satisfied with their performance, finishing tied for fourth. 
Notre Dame's women's team came in hoping to run well, but fell behind early and had little chance of catching the seven nationally 

ranked teams and finished 12th. 
The women's field featured seven teams ranked in the top 30 -including No. 3 Michigan -lining up against the Irish. By the first mile, these top teams had taken control of the race, pushing Notre Dame's runners back in the pack. This trend only continued at the second mile with the Wolverines leading the pack followed by No. 12 North Carolina State and No. 29 Florida State.

Team hits sunflower state 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
Coming off a disappointing second-place finish in last week's Notre Dame Invitational, the Irish will travel to Lawrence, Kan. to compete in the Marilynn Smith Sunf1ower Invitational today and Tuesday. 
Notre Dame will be without junior Alejandra Diaz­Calderon and freshman Julie Kim, who are out with injuries. 
"It's kind of a week by week thing for both of them," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "Realistically, though, I expect them to be out for the remainder of the fall season." 
Fifteen other teams will take part in the invitational Alvamar Golf Club. Holt said she empha­sized work­ing Notre D a m e ' s short game over the past week of practices in order to trim down 

Holt
the squad's scores to under 300 per round. 
"This course has a lot of hills for being in the middle of Kansas," Holt said. "We worked on a lot of up and down, ledge, bump and run shots, and we worked a lot on putting, which will help at a course like this." 

In the No. 1 slot for the Irish will be senior Noriko Nakazaki, who tied for eighth at last week's tournament. Nakazaki is Notre Dame's all­time leader in scoring aver­age and is averaging 7 5 per round this year. 
Sophomore Lisa Maunu, who has started the year with two top-20 individual finish­es, will be in the second slot. 
Freshman Kristin Wetzel will be in the third slot.
