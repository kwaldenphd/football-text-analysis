Allen's unusual 'gift' causes tnvesttgatton 
TOKYO (AP) -A Japanese magazine editor expressed astonish­ment yesterday over the con­troversy about a $1,000 gratuity given to White House aide Richard 
V. Allen. He said it was the magazine's own idea to make the payment. 
"It (the controversy) is a bolt out of the blue to us," Tsugio Takamori, editor-in-chief of the women's m;,gazinc Shufu-noTomo (Housewives' Friend) told The As­sociatedPress. 
"We had no idea that government officials in the United States are not allowed to recciVl· more than $100. We did cverythingJapanesc style." 
"I am very surprised and puzzled at the uproar over this interview. We paid the S\,000 according to Japanese custom. 
"The idea ofpaying SI,OOO for this particular interview naturally originated from the magazine," Takamori said. "When the interview with Mrs. Reagan was arranged in late December, I discussed the ques­tion of giving an honorarium -as we always do in such cases -and decided that 11,000 would be ap­propriate." 
Allen, President Reagan's chiefna­tional security adviser, denied any Impropriety, but acknowledged he received the money. He said he "intcret:pted" it to avoid causing embarrassment to Mrs. Reagan and the journalists, then put it in a safe and forgot about it until others dis­covered it during an office move. 
A magazine executive said Sunday that he understood "in advance" that some of the money would be given to charity by the White House. 
The U.S. Justice Depanment is in­vestigating Allen's receipt of the money, a tact the White House an­nounced Friday after the Tokyo newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published a story that said police were investigating payments to an unidentified U.S. official. 
Takamori said the decision to make a contribution was made a month before the jan. 21 interview, during a meeting of Shr4fu-no­Tomo's editorial staff 
Takamori said payment of money for interviews is a common practice among magazines in Japan. He said prices range from 3,000 yen (about S13) for telephone interviews with "people on the street" to more than 200,000 yen ( S881) for interviews with celebrities. Long interviews with distinguished personalities can be worth up to 500,000 yen ( $2,200 ), he said. 
There arc varying opinions about the prevalence ofsuch gratuities, of­fered by Japanese news organiza­tions to newsmakers -a practice sometimes known as checkbook journalism. Some journalists here say it may be usual practice for magazines, but it is not so for newspaers. 
Although some news organiza­tions have ironclad rules against giving such gifts, there Is the risk that refusing might cause offense to the donor in this country where gift­giving is an essential part of social etiquette.

Greenwood County 



Power company seeks price hike 
8y BOB THOMPSON 
AssociatedPress 
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -Fifteen years ago several thousand residents of Greenwood County were placed in a price time warp that today has them paying 1966 prices for 1981 electricity. 
Now the Duke Power Co. has gone to court in an effort to increase utility charges for some 3,300 cus­tomers who were promised their bills would not in­crease when the utility took over the Greenwood County Electric Power Commission, the state's only county-owned electrical system. 
"We had every reason to believe that the price of electricity was going down," 

TUESilAY
when we negotiated that contract, said 

.,.FOCUSSteve C. Griffith, 
vice president 
and general counsel for Duke. 
But the price went the other direction. And today payments from those customers don't even cover the cost of fuel the huge utility uses to generate electricity in the rural county located in the northwestern pan of the state, Duke officials say. 
By early next year Circuit Court Judge George F. Coleman is expected to rule on Duke's request that it be allowed to triple rates for the 3,300 customers over the next five years. The average bill for a homeowner still under the old rate would jump per month from 1116 to about S4H. 
Duke officials, during tesUmony last week at the Richland Countyjudicial Center, asked Coleman to rule that the South Carolina Public Service Commission erred in refusing to amend the 1966 state law approving the sale of the county's electrical system to the utility. 

Witnesses called by Duke and by Greenwood 
County, which is fighting the rate increase, agreed that 
Duke did not challenge the fixed rates until 14 years 
after they became effective. 
Duke officials acknowledge that when they paid the 
county's power commission S 12.9 million for its dis­
tribution system, the utility promised its new cus­
tomers their electric bills would never be raised. 
That deal, under which Duke also agreed to lease the 
county' hydro-electric station for S250,000 a year, was 
approved by Greenwood County voters in an April 
1966 referendum. 
The South Carolina General Assembly also passed a 
law sanctioning the sale. The law stated that after the 
sale, former customers of the county power commis­
sion would pay their current rates or Duke's rates, whic­
hever were lower. 
However, it allowed Duke to increase rates 
whenever a "new connection" occurred. 
Griffith said Duke had hoped that when hoq~es and 
apartments changed hands, new tenants would come 
under higher rates. But Francis Nicholson, at the time a 
state senator from Greenwood County, helped push 
through the Legislature an amendment to the 1966 bill 
which redefined "new connection." 
The amendment said Duke could only transfer old 
county customers to its higher rates when those cus­
tomers switched rate categories, for example when a 
homeowner swapped a gas water heater for an electric 
one, or changed from oil to electric heating. 
Several thousand former county customers were 
switched to the higher rate plan under that arrange­
ment. But the utility needs of 3,300 customers, includ­
ing three industrial plants and some businesses, didn't 
change. 
Both sides are hesitant to say how those customers ·might be affected if Coleman rules in Duke's favor, but

than usual this semester, was available last night in Regina North lounge to discuss parietals, the new library and proposed college center. 
Duggan, president of Saint Mary's since 1975, also discussed the Col­lege's long-term size plans, core cur­riculum, Board of Regents and the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's relation­ship. 
He stated that he did not have "a closed mind" to any new parietal proposals that may arise by SMC Stu­dent Government's recent survey, yet he sees the issue in a different historical perspective, witnessing two changes in visitation hours since his arrival to SMC. "Let them (the 'Ad Hoc' Committee studying parietals) do their work," he added, "and let's see what happens." 
Duggan said the current parietal system, which allows visitation only during the weekend, as a chance for "women to be together with women" Monday through Friday, and, if that system was changed, he questioned, "in what sense would we be a women's college?" 
Women's colleges, Duggan con· tinued, will be needed "as long as society discriminates against women." The environment of a women's college, according to Dug­gan, helps women rebel against the "pom-pom girl" image that is "nice and friendly," an image society In­grains in women. "A woman doesn't need to fall into 
a  stereotypic  role  that  a  male­ 
dominated  society  imposes,"  he  
said.  

"For most women," Duggan stated, "the research shows they're better off at a women's college." He also cited the findings of Elizabeth Tidball, SMC commencement speaker two years ago who, through

The students of Saint Mary's and 
Notre Dame are encouraged to par· 
ticipate in Oxfam America's eighth 
annual Fast for a World Harvest on 
Thursday. 
Oxfam America is a non-profit 
agency that funds self-help programs 
in the poorest regions of seventeen 
countries. The Fast is a chance to 
unite with the poor and hungry 
worldwide. Participants involved 
will go without eating for a day and 
donate their food money to help 
people who arc struggling to 
overcome hunger and poverty. 
The purpose of the Fast is to "sensitize us to what the poor ex­perience in the world daily", said Tom Reid, Director of Campus Min· istry at Saint Mary's. The Fast is sponsored by Saint Mary's World Hunger Coalition, Student Govern­ment, and Campus Ministry. 
The Fa'it begins on Thursday and the following activities have been scheduled around meal times for fas­ters. Prayer Services will take place at Stapleton Lounge at 8:15a.m., 11:15 a.m., and 4:30p.m. 
Several lectures will be given at Staplewn Lounge starting at 11:25 a.m., with John O'Neil who will talk on "The Challenge of World Hunger to Christian Values in an Age of Nar­cissism". john Ruhe will lecture on "A New Economic Order: Pros and Cons", at 4:40 p.m.. Tom Reid will discuss, "Reflecting on Fasting as an Act ofFaith, Hope, and Love", at 12:15 and 5:25 p. p.m., and lastly, Chuck McKelvey will discuss, "A Third World ViewofHunger", at 7:30p.m.. After the lectures a Mass will be held

Leavitt stated that the aim of the commission is "to stop emigration -the mass exodus of this campus over to Notre Dame or to the bars." She .feels that a better social life at SMC is a necessity, and that the SAPB can only ameliorate the situation. 
One of the goals of SAPB's com­missioner and the ten chairmen is to co-sponsor more activities with Notre Dame's Student Union. Bill Lawler and Mary Leavitt have talked about the possibility ofa winter car· nival and speakers. 
The Saint Mary's SAPB has a J16,000 budget, an amount less than Notre Dame's Chautauqua Cof­feehouse, to work with. Co­sponsoring would be a definite benefit, according to SAPB speaker chairman Laura Nitsos. By sharing expenses and using O'Laughlin Auditorium, which seats more than the Ubrary Auditorium, the two communities would both profit, according to Leavitt. 
O'Donnell stated that possibilities of expansion into a Student Union with offices exist in the future. 
Although Leavitt said that part of the problem with scheduling events is assessing the students' needs, she feels that future commissions will have greater experience and knowledge behind them to under­stand students and to be more responsive to their wants.

the higher rates could be devastat­ing for some companies. 
Edward E. Moore, manager of Duke's Greenwood office, said he found one plant paying S 149,000 under Duke rates in 1980 for the same. amount of power that cost S39,000 for a nearby plant under the county rates. 
One supermarket under the Duke rates paid s4,755 for 107,000 kilowatt-hours, while another market under the old prices paid S2,094 for 155,000 kwh, Moore said. 
Griffith said when the original agreement was reached, Duke charged about the same for electricity that the county did. But after the t'~C approved six rate in­creases that tripled Duke's rates be­tween 1970 and 1979, the utility decided that the disparity was too large to ignore, Griffith said.

FDA approves hepatitis vaccine 

WASHINGTON (AP) -An es­timated 10 million American health workers, male homosexuals, drug addicts, and others at high risk of contracting hepatitis B are prime candidates for a hepatitis vaccine ap­proved yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration. 
The new vaccine has proven both safe and highly effective in clinical trials for protecting people against the debilitating liver disease, said Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr., the FDA com­missioner. 
'This vaccine may save people ... from 
(liver) 'cancer ... ' 
"This is the first completely new viral vaccine in 1 0 years and the first vaccine ever licensed in the United States that is made directly from human blood," Hayes said at a news conference. 
One constraint may · be the vaccine's price: an estimated S75 to n 20 for three shots given over six months, according to Merck Sharp & Dohme, the maker ofthe "Heptava:x­8" vaccine. 

Hepatitis B is the most serious of three viral forms ofthe disease. It in­fects 200,000 to 300,000 Americans each year, and the Center for Disease Control estimates it costs the nation $750 million annually in 
medical bills  and  time  lost  from  
work.  
The  disease  passes  unnoticed  

with no outward signs in most people who are infected. But after a two-to six-month incubation period, 50,000 to 60,000 fall ill with jaundice, fever and nausea, and 10,000 require hospitalization. Some 100 to 200 die of acute hepatitis each year, according to government doctors. 
Even those mildly infected run the risk of becoming chronic car­riers ofhepatitis B and falling victim to cirrhosis or liver cancer later in life, according to Dr. Donald Francis of the Center for Disease Control's hepatitis division. 
"This vaccine may save people not only from an infectious disease, but from (liver) cancer as well," said Hayes. 
Hayes and Francis said that each year, 20,000 Americans, or 5 per­cent to 10 percent ofthose infected,

research, concluded that women who attend women's colleges com­plete their college education more often, enter graduate schools in greater numbers, move faster in careers and, in general, felt more self-confident, poised and capable of assuming positions of leadership. 
As chieffund-raiser for the 57 mil­lion needed to finance construction of the new library on Saint Mary's Campus (so far, 55.5 million has been raised), Duggan explained that faculty members, students and ad­ministration serve on a "Committee on the College Center" that decides priorities for space in the new library. 
The new facility, which contains 78,000 square feet (as compared to the 20,000 square feet in the current library), a 24-hour study lounge connected with Le Mans Hall, typing rooms, audio-visual rooms, group study rooms and 560 seats (SMC's library now seats 260), will be com­pleted this spring. 
Saint Mary's will remain at its present enrollment ( 1800 stu­dents), as well as continuing to be a women's, Catholic liberal-arts in­stitution, even if the current drop in 18-year-olds continues. "We want to maintain our present selectivity" among applicants, Duggan stres<;ed. 
The core curriculum, "one of the essential elements of the Saint Mary's education," is being current­ly r~viewed by a study committee funded by the Ully Corp_, under the program "Women In the Year 2000." The group is is addressing certain problems with revision of the core curriculum a possible outcome. 
The Board of Regents, composed of sisters of the Holy Cross, SMC graduates, businessmen and both a faculty and student body member, is involved in such areas as college goals, academic programs, budget and tenure decisions. The Regents, according to Duggan, have "final authority for everything that will ef­fect the long-term health of the col­lege." 
The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's relationship consists of separate ad­ministrations that "confer often on all sorts of things," Duggan ex­plained. He hopes the new College Center will help alleviate the mass exodus from SMC to ND each 

' weekend, realizing that the non­allowance of alcholic beverages at SMC "makes social situations dif­ficult, but that's the state law." 
All Saint Mary's students are invited to visit Duggan during a Monday "open house," in the Presi­dent's Office, Le Mans Hall, until Dec. 14 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Colorado State strives for no. 1 

While most of the nation's fledgling journalists were in Evanston, Ill., getting the scoop on Nonhwestern, Bottom Ten voters riveted their attention elsewhere. See, to the Bottom Ten connisseur, the Mildcats are the leisure suits of bad football -passe. Those ofus in the know are much more interested in this year's latest fas­hion. The gray-flannel suits of bad football go by the name ofthe Colorado State Rams. 
Ah, what a breeding ground for gridiron ineptitude! Just look at your history books, sports buffs. 
Air Force went to great heights to recruit mediocre football players. They set maximum height and weight requirements. They even adopted entrance exams for admission to the school. And it paid off For years, the junior birdmen were alone on the lofty plateaus of worthlessness. 
Then there was the University of Colorado. The Buf­faloes roamed far and wide for a coach to destroy a modestly successful program. They found Chuck Fair­banks, and seldom is heard a discouraging word about the new-look team. Colorado is 2-8, but Fairbanks ad­mits this is a rebuilding year. 
Now, a new chapter is being written in the history of Rocky Mountain football. The Rams are in the midst ofa race for the Bottom Ten pennant, and they have an ace in the hole. 
Nonhwestern closes out its season this weekend when they take on Illinois. But Colorado State has two games left, and could very well become the first team in the history ofthe NCAA to go 0-12 in a season. 
Despite what seems to be a sure bet, with Arizona State and Hawaii still to come, Ram fans and school offi­cials are doing their best to help out. Consider the fact that almost 1000 of the school's 18.000 students

showed up for the final home game of the year. Also note that the stadium announcer whipped that crowd into a frenzy when he announced the score ofarchrival Northwestern's game as "Wildcats 70, Ohio State 6." 
Eight fumbles, four interceptions, 12 penalties and countless dropped passes helped the Rams fall to New Mexico, 28-16. 
Here are the standingsfor the closest poll ofthe season: 
1) Northwestern (0-10)-hoping for replay of'79 classic -0-0 tie with Illini 
2) Colorado State (0-10)-Interim Coach Chester Caddas: "We hadn't practiced well all week. We played like we practiced." 
3) Eastern Michigan (0-10) -weak MAC schedule a disadvantage 
4) Memphis State (1-10) -should get Elvis's doc­tor as team physician 
5) Georgia Tech (1-9) -sunk by Middies, 20-14 
6) State of Oregon (2-18) -lost 82-10 to Stan­ford and Arizona 
7) Virginia (1-8) -too close to D.C. to be a winner

Sports Writer 
When the Notre Dame senior football players were introduced prior to the Georgia Tech contest, Irish fans got a close look at the ef­fects ofplayer injuries as the first few seniors entered the field on crutches. Though nobody wishes bad fonune on a fellow athlete, the inevitable injuries of football provide young players with chances to play in game situations that they would not have otherwise. 
Last Saturday, mJuries to defensive end Kevin Griffith and linebacker Rick Naylor enabled two freshmen to show their skills against Air Force. Mike Gann substituted for Griffith and celebrated his first col­lege action by making four tackles. Joe Bars took Naylor's place and ended up with six tackles, five of them solo. 
How did Bars feel about playing on Saturday? "It was great! I've had some playing time on the specialty teams, but this was my first chance to see some action at linebacker. I decided to go out and prove myself, take advantage of the situation and do my best. 
"I really haven't felt frustrated 
about the lack of playing time I've 
had. When Coach Johnson (the 
defensive coordinator) recruited me, he told me that Icould 'be a part' ofthe team. On the specialty teams, I was able to be a pan. Last Saturday, I was able to be more ofa pan, and I'm happy about it." 
Bars is a product of Brother Rice High School in Michigan and has the distinction ofliving next door to the Irish basketball center, Tim Andree. Bars led Brother Rice to the state championship in his senior year and made the honorable mention list on the all-state team. 
Rick Naylor thought the freshman did a good job. "He hasn't had much experience on the first and second teams in practice, but he felt he might get some time last Saturday because Joe Rudzinski didn't make the trip. He's done a great job learn­ing the outside linebacker position, which he didn't play in high school. It's tough learning to line up against tight ends and learn the patterns." 
What were Gann's feelings towards playing against Air Force? "It was great fun! Playing before a home crowd (Mike lives in Lakewood, Col.) especially fired me up. I really didn't expect much, so I was pleased". 
"At the beginning of the season, it 
was frustrating. I arrived here in

MEN'S FOOTBALL -In two tight games this past Sunday, Off-Campus and Dillon advanced to the cham­pionship bout; the "Super Bowl" of lnterhall. Dillon qualified by downing an intense Holy Cross team, 14-6, in a game that was closer than the score shows. 
In the second match-up, Off-Campus slipped past a strong Grace squad, 7-6. The game was marked by a big defensive battle where the "virgin defense" of the Off-
