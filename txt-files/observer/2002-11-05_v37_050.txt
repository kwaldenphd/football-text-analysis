Economic slowdown halts construction 
By LINDA SKALSKI 
News Writer 
Trustees and Officers at the University decided to delay construction of certain build­ings due to a decrease in out­side donations and a tighten­ing of the University's budget resulting from the poor econo­my. 
"Our benefactors' ability to help us out is being limited by the stock market perfor­mance," said James Lyphout, vice president for Business Operations. "They are unable to contribute at the same level." 
The University has a triple A bond rating, which refers to a company or institution's financial strength and stabili­ty, and reflects the school's ability to borrow money on favorable terms. This is not something the University wants to jeopardize, according to Lyphout. 
"The University is still very strong financially," he said. "So we will be conservative with our spending." 
Financial considerations were the only reason for halt­ing construction, according to Lyphout. 
The most visible construc­tion delay is the new Security Building/Post Office Facility, for which the foundation has already been laid at the north end of campus near the Stepan Center. Construction has been stopped indefinitely. 
The delay of these projects has resulted in a domino effect that will delay other construction projects, such as a new hotel, which were already on the drawing board. 
Not all construction, howev­er. will be delayed. Renovations to the College of Arts and Letters Dean's Office, the Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts and Hesburgh Library renovations are all expected to be com­pleted on time. 
Lyphout said the next high­est construction priority is the Science Building, to be located north of the Joyce Center. Construction of the building is scheduled to start in late March. 
"We are hoping to stay on schedule, although funding is not complete," said Lyphout. "We are working very hard to get that funding." 
This delay will not cost the school anything beyond the added price of absorbing inflation, he said. 
"We have all agreed that the decision we have made is the right thing to do," said Lyphout.

EXECUTIVE CABINET 
Group debates The Shirt deal 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
NcwsWrit~r 
Executive Cabinet members met Monday night to discuss programming and the group's ongoing strategic planning process. but the status of The Shirt dominated the conversa­tion. 
Some members expressed concern that the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore has been profiteering from the suc­cess of the originally student­run project. Peggy Hnatusko from the Office of Student Activities explained that The Shirt's financial agreement with the bookstore only cov­e red the origin al order of approximately 44,000 shirts. When those shirts sold out. a new agreement was reached that allows for a much smaller payoff for student groups. 

"It's very little, compared to what we were getting," said Danielle Ledesma, president of the Judicial Council.

Hunters to kill deer at SMC 
By SARAH NESTOR 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Don't be alarmed by that sound you hear, it just might be gunfire. 
Starting today hunters will begin to reduce the overabun­dant deer population on Saint Mary's campus, hunting in the cornfields and around the Johns, Sisters of the Holy Cross environmental director said. "One of the best times to hunt is while the deer are in rut and are in small groups, instead of herds." 
During the winter deer run together in herds, which makes it easier for the herd to hear or see predators. On campus the deer have been causing accidents, going 
nature trail. Although the hunters will not be on campus everyday, these areas will be off 
limits 
through 

November.

students to avoid the area for the next month," Lindsay Evans, a Saint Mary's repre­sentative to Notre Dame cam­pus life said at Monday's 
Executive Cabinet meeting. 
Problems with the deer population began three years ago, when an environmental study of the campus was con­ducted and found that the deer population was growing at an alarming rate. Over the past year the deer population has doubled and it is estimat­ed that there are currently 80 to 100 deer around campus. 
"A hunt was conducted last Christmas vacation, but it was not a successful hunt," Judith are known to carry Lyme dis­ease, which can be transmit­ted to people. 
"I wish there was a better way to do this, but we have no alternative," Johns said. 
Johns said that other means were investigated before the decision to bring hunters on campus, including talks with the Humane Society and the Wildlife Fund. Another option was to ship the deer to anoth­er location. No one, however, was willing to take the deer, according to Johns.

Wellstone remembered 
In the divided Senate, senators argue their positions and make deals. At the end of the day the most stubborn are vic­torious. A plane crash brought agree­ment. On Oct. 25, friends and enemies, Democrats and Meghanne Republicans, halted Downes campaigning and offered their condo­
Assistant
lences for a senator 
News Editor 
from Minnesota and Ws family. 
Paul Wellstone, Minnesota's liberal Democrat, cro~d party lines and made decisions based on his convictions. While other incumbent Democrats up for reelection voted in favor of authorizing the use ofmilitary force in Iraq, Wellstone voted no, despite knowing it could cost him the election. 
For most, their political future, not their convictions determine their moves in Congress. But not Wellstone, he crossed party lines to work for the good of the people who he served. Bill Schneider, CNN political analyst, said Wellstone was a man of conviction who voted against the Democratic version of the estate tax repeal, national missile defense and permanent normal trade relations with China. 
In life, colleagues considered him a radical liberal, but in death they came together to remember his principles. Apparently, representing constituents rather than the party, makes someone a radical liberal. It's ironic how politicians will chastise individuals who do not rep­resent their party's platform when they themselves should be concentrating on serving their constituents, not their politi­cal self interest. 
There are two realities: a tragedy brings people together and a politician is always a politician. After the crash, CNN reported that President George Bush said, "Paul Wellstone was a man of deep convictions, a plain-spoken fellow who did his best for his state and his country." 
Just weeks earlier, the president cam­paigned for Wellstone's opponent, Norm Coleman. Why would the president cam­paign against someone who did the best for his state and country? The answer is simple, Wellstone was a Democrat and Bush is a Republican. 
Were politicians on Oct. 25 thinking of the Wellstone family when they grieved or were they thinking of their political positioning? Even the ultra conservative Sen. Phil Gramm, told the Pioneer Press he admired Wellstone's tenacity and con­viction. How easy it is in politics to disre­spect and despise one day and honor and respect the next. 
Undoubtedly, officials from both sides were scrambling to modify their cam­paigns, so as not to appear unsympathet­
ic. Democrats searched for a replace­ment and within hours the name Walter Mondale surfaced. Coincidentally, this fonner vice president wants to continue Wellstone's traditions. The Democratic leadership apparently justified taking breaks in their grieving in order to find a winning candidate to help maintain their one seat Senate majority. 
There are two facts which remain: a man and his family died and today an election will be held. When the political maneuvering is completed. it should be interesting to see ifthese politicians will be a.hie to see the same type of admira­tion and principles in all of their living colleagues.

Student leaders prep for today's elections 

By HELENA PAYNE 
News Editor 
The buildup of months of planning peaks today as voters populate the polls in support of their preferred candidates. 
In St. Joseph County, three prominent races have stirred up election chatter, and while most Notre Dame students are unable to vote in the local elec­tion, those students who are active in the current race take it seriously. 
The contest for the House of Representatives has been called the region's most important election as the two major politi­cal parties vie for a majority in Congress. 
St. Joseph County's new 2nd congressional district, has wit­nessed one of the most aggres­sive campaigns in the nation with the race between Republican Chris Chocola and Democrat Jill Long Thompson, replacing Democratic congress­man Tim Roemer. 
"The person who wins this district will have an important impact on Congress," said senior Erin LaRuffa, a fundrais­ing intern for the Long Thompson campaign. 
LaRuffa and senior Mark Hayes head the Notre Dame chapters of the College Democrats and College Republicans respectively, and they have also been working on their parties' congressional campaigns. 
Local voters have been bom­barded heavily during the cam­paign with attack ads linking Long Thompson to terrorism and Chocola to corporate greed. During the campaign, WNDU­TV has yanked negative spots about both candidates, accord­ing to the South Bend Tribwie. 
"As sad as it is, negative ads are more effective than positive ads," Hayes said, mentioning the struggle in this race for the candidates to differentiate themselves from the opposition. 
"Both candidates have views and opinions that fit with a lot of different people," Hayes said. "It's too difficult to be too liberal or too conservative and appeal to a solid base of voters on a national level." 
In other major races: 
. 
The contest for St. Joseph County Prosecutor is between incumbent Republican Chris Toth and Democrat Michael Dvorak. 

. 
Democrat Frank Canarecci will face Republican incumbent Rick Seniff in the race for coun­ty sheriff.

CLC debates need for international voices 
By MICHAEL CHAMBLISS News Writer 
During Monday's Campus Life Council meeting, Student Body President Libby Bishop intro­duced the idea of including a representative for international students in the council. The number of undergraduate international students has dou­bled in the last year, international students are not widely involved in student gov­ernment, and may feel that they do not have an opportunity to voice their concerns.

U.S. forces kill top al-Qaida aide, others in Yemen 
A,socia.tc:d Press 
WASHINGTON 

U.S. forces killed a top associate of Osama bin Laden in Yemen in a missile strike, expanding the war on terror with America's first overt attack on suspected al-Qaida operatives outside of Afghanistan, a U.S. official said Monday. 
Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi was one of several al-Qaida members traveling by car in northwest Yemen when a Hellfire missile struck it Sunday. killing him and five others. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the attack was believed to have been conducted by a CIA aircraft, possibly a missile-carrying Predator drone. 
The official Yemeni news agency, local tribesmen and the U.S. official confirmed the strike killed al-Harethi. Witnesses said they saw an aircraft, possibly a heli­copter, in the area. Hellfrres can also be launched by attack helicopters. 
The others killed were believed to be low-level operatives. The attack occurred in the northern province of Marib, about 100 miles east of Yemen's capital of San'a, where al-Qaida is considered active. 
U.S. counterterrorism officials have said al-Harethi, also known as Abu Ali, was al-Qaida's chief operative in Yemen and a top target of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. An associate of bin Laden since the early 1990s in Sudan, al-Harethi is a suspect in the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12, 2000. 
The CIA declined comment. On Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a Pentagon press confer­ence, "It would be a very good thing if he were out of business." 
A Yemeni official, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity, said, "Authorities have been monitoring this particular car for a while and we believe those men belonged to the al-Qaida terror net­work." 
Many al-Qaida operatives fleeing the U.S.-led war on Afghanistan have joined comrades in Yemen. After the United States detected growth in al-Qaida pres­ence there this spring, hundreds of U.S. troops deployed to Djibouti, the tiny African nation facing Yemen across the Red Sea, officials said. The Marine amphibious assault ship Nassau recently replaced the USS Belleau Wood in the waters between the two nations. 

Inside Yemen, U.S.-trained Yemeni troops deployed to suspected al-Qaida hotbeds in August. 
Besides al-Harethi, at least one more Yemeni al-Qaida operative linked to the Cole attack, Mohammad Hamdi al-Ahdal, is thought to be in Yemen, U.S. officials say. In the Cole attack, two suicide bombers slammed an explosives-laden boat into the hull of the ship, killing 17 
U.S. sailors and disabling the vessel. 
Also believed to be in Yemen are Shaykh Dabwan and Suwaid, described as al-Qaida operatives who plan and pro­vide support to terror operations, and an al-Qaida communications expert known as Miqdad, said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Suicide bombing leaves 2 Israelis dead: 
A Palestinian suicide attacker blew himself up Monday while grappling with an Israeli security guard at a shopping mall in a Tel Aviv suburb, killing the guard and another civilian and wounding 12 other people, including two infants. The bombing -the 81st by Palestinian militants in two years ­marked a first test for Israel's new defense minister, Shaul Mofaz. who was sworn in Monday. 
Saddam said to consider new resolution: 
President Saddam Hussein indicated Monday he would not reject outright a new U.N. resolution on weapons inspections. saying Iraq would examine the conditions it imposes before deciding on compli­ance, Iraqi TV reported. Saddam's remarks appeared to mark a shift by the Iraqi leader, who had maintained he would only accept weapons inspectors on terms laid down in previous resolu­tions. 

NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Sniper suspect appears before judge: 
The 17-year-old sniper suspect appeared before a federal judge for a closed juvenile hearing Monday as investigators looked into whether two more shootings are linked to a spree that left 10 dead. Police around the country have been reviewing unsolved shootings to see if they are connected to John Muhammad, 41, and John Malvo, 17, who were arrested Oct. 24 in Maryland. The wounding of two people in separate holdups, one outside a liquor store and the other outside a restaurant, could be connected with the string of sniper attacks that terrorized the region, Prince George's County police said. Both shootings took place in Clinton, the same Washington suburb where Muhammad's ex-wife lives. In addition to the sniper shootings in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., the two have been charged with slayings in Louisiana and Alabama, and are suspects in two shootings, one fatal, in Washington state. 
Ventura appoints independent to Senate: 
A steaming-mad Gov. Jesse Ventura appointed a fel­low independent to temporarily fill Sen. Paul Wellstonc's seat Monday, while Walter Mondale went on the offensive against Republican Norm Coleman in the only debate of their compressed Senate campaign. Ventura's choice of Dean Barkley, a major figure in Minnesota's third-party move­ment, leaves control of the Senate up in the air. The two major parties now have 49 members each. with­two independents. 
New church sex-abuse draft released: 
America's Roman Catholic bishops released the new draft of their sex abuse policy Monday, a plan that still would get molesters away from children ­though victims say the process is cumbersome and secretive. Worked out in talks with the Vatican last week, U.S. bishops will vote on the changes at their Nov. 11-14 meeting in Washington.

Court rejects Canada cigarette suit 
Canada lost a Supreme Court case Monday over its attempt to use a U.S. anti-racketeer­ing law to sue over cigarette smuggling. 
Canadian leaders contend R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. tried to get around taxes by smuggling tobacco into Canada through an Indian reservation. 
Other countries had copied Canada's $1 bil­lion lawsuit. The Supreme Court refused to consider reinstating the case, signaling that countries must use their own courts to pursue American companies they accuse of wrongdo­ing. 
Canadian lawyers sued under a federal law that offers successful plaintiffs tripled dam­ages. Lower courts ruled that the case was barred under an English common-law rule that bans foreign governments from using 
U.S. courts to collect lost revenues. 
The case has been pending for months at the Supreme Court. Part of the delay came after justices asked the Bush administration last spring to offer its opinion. The adminis­tration sided with H.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. cigarette maker behind Philip Morris Inc. 

Enron's cash burn rate questioned 
A group of Enron Corp. creditors say the failed energy giant's bankruptcy costs are jeopardizing their potential to recover at least some of what they're owed. 
"We are certainly concerned about the possibility that professional fees could eat up the entire bankrupt estate," Aaron Cahn, one of the attorneys representing 18 creditors collectively called the Dunhill Group, said Monday. 
A month ago Enron filed a report with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York projecting that legal and bankruptcy-related fees will reach $306 million by the end of December this year. That amount was part of an over­all estimate of $773 million in administrative costs over the same time span. 

WorldCom fraud at $7.68B 
. Thornburgh cites company's illegal reports 
A..odated Press 

JACKSON, Miss. 
WorldCom Inc. took "extraordinary and illegal steps" to paint a rosy pic­ture of its deteriorating finances, and the extent of the fraud will likely go beyond the $7.68 billion previously disclosed, a bankruptcy court-appoint­ed monitor said Monday. 
The report from special examiner Richard Thornburgh, a former U.S. attorney general, also crit­icized WorldCom's board for letting former chief executive Bernard Ebbers leverage his company stock for more than $1 bil­lion in personal and busi­ness loans. That greatly exceeds the $400 million in personal loans Ebbers was already disclosed to have been granted. 
Thornburgh said he had significant information that WorldCom employees created false internal financial reports to con­ceal their fraud. His report excluded details of the accounting manipula­tions, it said, because the company is the subject of civil and criminal pro­ceedings. audit committee, the com­in July after revealing WorldCom to keep cus­

How Does Nature Build Tissues? 
All biological tissues are subjected to a wide variety of biochemical, mechanical and electrical stimuli that result in physical changes to the structure and size of the materials.

book, very distant from me. I did not anticipate that the scholarly part of the book would become my own experience as well," Holloway said. She realized that the early death of her son and the way in which his death was poor­ly depicted in media was telling about the African American death experience. 
She recognized that like her son, many of the African­American youth were dying yoWlg. Her studies indicated that the child size caskets and caskets marketed to teens have always been marketable in part due to the amount used in the African American community. 
"The ways in which we died changed but the fact that we were vulnerable to dying because we were African American stayed the same," Holloway said. 
In order to learn about the topic. Holloway traveled all over, visiting funeral homes, grave sites, funeral museums and even a Black Funeral Director's Convention, where they displayed caskets like a car salesman would display a car. 
Through her research she found that most African­American funerals are elaborate and full of dramatic effects and rituals specific to their culture. These rituals are the way in which the African American com­munity honors their loved ones that have passed away, Halloway said. 
Holloway visited grave sites of famous African Americans, including Harriet Tubman, Louis Armstrong and Richard Wright. 
Holloway gained insight and peace through her experiences while writing the book. 
Holloway feels that the African American rituals in dealing with death and dying help them to heal as a community and go for­ward 
"I have come to believe in the healing power of ritual." she said. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Intercultural Leadership and the Office of Multi-Cultural Affairs.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Sometimes it takes another perspective to help you see outside your immediate condition. And sometimes that alternative perspective can provide with you with an appreciation that you should have had the entire time. That is exactly what happened to me this past weekend when two of my friends from back home came to visit Notre Dame. 
One may be quick to assume that their experience was less than extraordinary. After all, they made a trip from two of the gems of the east coast to come to South Bend ­certainly not a place that even deserves to be uttered in the same breath as New York City and Boston. Our bars were frequented, most unfortunately, by a majority of Boston College kids who seemed in no mood to interact with anyone but themselves. Who drives 13 hours in an RV to drink beers in Sam's Club parking lot in Mishawaka. Ind.? Oh yeah, and the very event that was supposed to be the highlight of the weekend, the football game, was a bit of a disappointment. 
Yet on the ride to O'Hare on Sunday morning, my friends had nothing but praise for this school that I have been so blessed to have attended for the past 3 1/2 years. In fact, they even expressed a sentiment of regret that their college experience was so void of the community and spirit of Notre Dame. I had difficulty staying on the road. Isn't it an almost universal sentiment around here that South Bend is the worst place in the world? And that a truly urban college experience (such as is offered by Northeastern and Columbia) would inevitably be more complete than our ultra-traditional and hyper-conserva­tive Catholic institution? · 
If any of my friends have read up to this point (which I most certainly hope they have not), I am sure that the inevitable question begs to be asked: "Is Joe Lordi about to go 'Joe Domer' on us? Is he about to get all mushy and tell us how we need to truly relish the 'Notre Dame Experience' in our final few months here at the University?" 
And to each of the questions I respond with a tentative, "Yes." Sure, I am the same kid who has had four run-ins with Residence Life and been jaded by the inconsistencies of our administration. Yes, I am that kid who walks around and says, "Go Irish," not because I necessarily believe in the credo, but because it is an amusing conver­sation filler. Oh yeah, and I am also that kid who tries to motivate the entire senior section games to sit down at football games when my legs get tired. 
Ultimately, the very notion of writing a letter to The Observer is quite out of character. But after hearing end­less appreciation for our University from my friends from home, I could not help but be moved. In fact, they helped to remind me of the very reasons that l decided to come to Notre Dame: the camaraderie shared at tailgates, the spirit displayed by a unified student section (despite a heartbreaking loss) and the friends that are so apprecia­tive of a good conversation and good times. They could not believe the abundance of life and character that is so unique to our University. 
While many people will reflect upon this past weekend as being one of the most disappointing in recent memory, perhaps we would be better served to see things with a more optimistic tint. We have it great here -maybe even better than any other undergraduates anywhere in the nation. As far as I'm concerned, a national championship is far less relevant to our collective lives than is the mys­terious "Notre Dame Experience." So let's keep that in mind -especially to the freshmen who have finally expe­rienced a loss. You'll be okay. No need to become jaded and cynical. So that's it. I just wanted to get that off my chest. 
I know that I'll look back at my college experience in 20 years and remember it as the best times anyhow. Why not just be honest with myself now? It's funny how much can be learned from a losing football weekend. One more thing: Go Irish.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
No shame in loss to 
Boston College 

As a Notre Dame student, I am a huge fan and proud supporter of athletics. I found the caption to the photo depicting Ryan Grant under Brian Kronk's "From Green to Blue" article yesterday to be troublesome. The phrase "hangs his bead in shame" had me outraged from the time I saw it. I don't think he's hanging his head in shame at all. 
Shame comes from not taking pride in what you do, not being loyal to your cause and abandoning your team. None of which Ryan Grant, or for that mat­ter any member of the Notre Dame team, did that day. The students, for the most part. were still in the stands after the clock ran out, ready to recite the "Notre Dame Victory March" and "Notre Dame Our Mother," and the team wore the colors they were proud of and fought to the very last seconds on the clock for their cause. 
I don't see any cause for shame. Like many, I was disappointed in the out­come, but although I do not play on the field, I know the loyalty was still there. 
That's why they were out on the field again for practice yesterday, with every ambition and intent to win their next game. They have remained true to their cause; they have been loyal to their family and the team remained unit­ed. How we all respond to the last game is something that will show our true colors -our blood runs blue, gold and yes. even green. 
I am proud to say that I was sitting in the stadium when the 2002 football team and family were 8-0, but even prouder to say that I stayed in the stadium when we were 8-1. 
To those talking about the green jerseys being "bad luck" and the Notre Dame's perfect season being destroyed. I urge you to look at the sea of green on Nov. 2. The weather was freezing, but we all wore our green shirts proudly that day, regardless of what happened. 
I recall the Pittsburgh game, when my friend walked into my room com­plaining about how many people were at the bookstore buying the "Return to Glory" shirts. I am positive that just as many people this weekend were elated to prove that they too are a part of it all by buying their shirts. 
rt is not the shirt, it is not the luck, but rather. it is the loyalty and faith that we have in Our Mother. our team and our family. There is no shame on Grant's face, there is no shame on anyone's face on campus and there is no shame in Notre Dame.

U.S. interests should not be subordinate to U.N.'s 
The ongoing debate over confronting Iraq on its repeated violations of United Nations resolutions is being conducted dishonestly by European champions of "multilateralism." The nations of Europe and their sycophants around the world accuse the United States of taking a "unilateral stance," ofabandoning multilateral decision-making and seeking to impose its will on the world. What these crit­ics fail to acknowledge is that the United States is doing what nation-states have always been expected to do: pursue their own policies, in their own self-interest. 
The nations of Europe, the mouthpieces of multilateralism, flare indignant when the United States declares that she will not be "handcuffed" by the United Nations, in the words of Secretary of State Colin Powell. Why? Because they believe the United States, and all states, ought to be handcuffed by the United Nations. In a world which con­tains only one superpower -which is so much more powerful than the rest ofthe world that the French are inventing new terms like "hyperpower" -weaker states have no other avenue to power than through international bodies. 
Such bodies as the United Nations allow enhanced influence by weak states and diminished influence by more powerful ones by demanding rightfully that all states engage one another civilly, for the common solution to international problems. 
Such bodies are great things. The United Nations is a great thing. Remember, though, that the United States not only played the pivotal role in creating it, but that she entered the United Nations willingly, at a time when it was obvious that America was a power of incredible proportions. The United States· continuing participation in the United Nations is a mark of her dedication to the community of nations. 
However, Europeans and other weaker states have used the United Nations to pro­ject a world order which calls for the contin­ual weakening of great states in an effort to exert influence not only over matters of purely communal interest, but also of indi­vidual self-interest. 
Read the Declaration of Independence: Legitimate nation-states exist to protect the liberties and well-being of their people. That is the primary, insoluble purpose of their existence. In matters of individual self­defense. nation-states exert their sovereign authority to act. Nation-states pursue their own policies, and when those policies are declared by legitimately elected governors and found by those legislators to be valid in their own right, they are not subject to approval by international bodies.

GUEST COLUMN 
West ignores Russia's problems at its own peril 
MADISON, WIS. 

There is a dark specter visible today on the horizon of global relations, one nation whose future can endanger the security of the entire planet. This country is not a new threat; the Matt Lynch Free World has feared it for years. 
Its people suf­fered under totali-Badger Herald tarianism for most of the last century, living in fear of all-powerful government. They have also been hit with extreme poverty over the past decade, with the despotic elite getting richer while the average citizen gets less and less. 
It is a nation of both religious and political turmoil, rampant with terror­ists and laden with a rich arsenal of "weapons of mass destruction." One spark could set this nation, its region and the entire world into unprecedent­ed chaos. 
Iraq? Not even close. North Korea? Please. Any global conflict those two states could incite pales in comparison with the potential of the most frighten­ing power in the world over the past 50 years: the former Soviet Union. 
Since the surprisingly rapid end of the Cold War and the fall of commu­nism in the Soviet bloc, the attitude of the American public toward Russia has been best expressed by the character of John Connor in "Terminator 2": "Aren't they our friends now?" 
Politicians and the public have paid sparingly little attention to Russia and its former satellites except when push­ing them to accept American for­eign policy in the Middle East, shaking their hands on largely symbolic weapons reduction or patting ourselves on the back for victo­ry in the Cold War. 
It's time to wake up. We're not out of the woods yet. 
The fact that Russia is back in the news this week for a hostage situa­tion that ended in tragedy­over 100 hostages killed by the government's own knock-out gas ­merely highlights the fact that it never should have left the public eye of the West. 

Russia still has more nuclear and chemical weapons than any other country. which is not dangerous in and of itself. The danger lies in who holds them. The Russian political situation is precarious at best, the Russian mafia makes Al Capone and John Dillinger look like the Olsen twins and its terror­ist opposition is at least as fanatical as al Qaeda. With widespread poverty set 
alongside immense and often ille­gal wealth, violent threats 
lurking everywhere and a government that strug­gles to deal effective­ly with either prob­
lem, it is no won­der many Russians Jong 
for the return of some stabil­ity under com­
munism. 
The possi­bility of a fall back into totalitarianism 
remains; 11 years of living without commu­nism is not long enough to change the minµ.set of many Russian adults. We do not for­get the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness we learned in grade school even when they are under assault. Instead, we defend them vehe­mently. Can we really expect Russians indoctrinated to believe in equality, suppression of rebellion and the ulti­mate authority of the state to embrace their newfound reality of vast inequali­ty, terrorist rebellion and the ineffec­tiveness of the state to solve these problems? 

Terrorism and the political situation in the Middle East are worthy topics of public debate, to be certain -I do not mean to argue otherwise. But perhaps our priorities in the arena of public debate are a little mixed up, like a homeowner hiring the Orkin man while his roof is about to cave in. 
If the Middle East is a tinderbox, as our politicians will tell us, then Russia is a fuel tanker. Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon may be dangerous, but the United States would rather deal with an armed Saddam who has control over his small country than an anarchist Russia with thousands of warheads up for grabs. It would rather deal with a few rogue terrorists than a resurrected Soviet Union. And, I think, it would rather spend time with both problems than take care of the pests while the house falls apart. 
Last week's terrorism in Russia is just another wake-up call. Maybe it's time to pay attention.

ALBUM REVIEW 
An,_os hits the n,_ark 
By DAVID HARTWIG 
Scene Music Critic 
Famous or infamous? The verdict is still out. but Tori Amos definitely has a thing for concept albums. The latest in a 14-year career. Scarlet's Walk, finally hits a mark that she definitely has fallen short of on recent records. This album follows the path of a female heroine. Scarlet, on a journey through every state in the U.S., focusing on the histories from pre-1492 through the European conquest of this country. 
The concept for the album itself is very interesting, but true audiophiles know that it is the music that counts. This is where Scarlet's Walk shines. After 1991's Little Earthquakes, arguably one of the decade's greatest albums, Amos' next five studio releases seemed to miss the mark both in terms of musical quality and in sheer emo­

tional intensity. On last year's Strange Little Girls, the concept overshadowed the music, with Amos covering songs that were origi­nally recorded by all male artists -mostly songs unworthy of her incredible talents. 
Though the entire album is worth listen­ing to over and over, the best tracks on Scarlet's Walk include the first single "a sorta fairytale." The path of this song includes California, Northern .Arizona and New Mexico. With an up-tempo, folksy beat, this track is definitely new-school Amos. The album's title track and "strange" are the most reminiscent of old­school Amos, with the haunting piano and ethereal voice spouting lyrics that express her profound sense of disillusionment with the world. This is seen especially on Scarlet's Walk when her lyrical tribute to some of the Native American tribes of the Blue Mountains in the Western Carolinas seems to come out strongly against a trou­bled super-power and its "free" people 
imposing social morals on I e s s wealthy nations. 
Other a I bum highlights include " pan ­cake," which fol­lows the heroine from Philadelphia through New York and Boston and up into the Northern New England states. The bluesy beat of the song drtves social­ly conscious lyrics mixed with personal commen­taries, including the lines "it seems in vogue to be a closet misogynist homophobe" and "Messiahs need people dying in their name." On "Taxi Ride," perhaps the best track on the album, Amos makes use of a strong, almost funky beat to show a lighter side. 
This is also one of Amos' more commer­cialized albums, some­thing that seems to go strongly against the con­cept. The deluxe edition includes a map that details the path each song follows along with Polaroid-like stills from the trip, a sticker book, a charm which must be some kind of souvenir, and a DVD that features videos for "Gold Dust," "a sorta fairytale," and "Taxi Ride." 
In spite of or because of the concept, this album is just plain good. In all, it's her best album since Boys for Pele. With full orches­tras complimenting some tracks and Native American prayers providing some lyrics, it is her first since little Earthquakes to showcase the breadth of her musical tal­ents and depth of her songwriting capabili­ties.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Pavem.ent gets rediscovered 
By DANIEL MCSWAIN 
Scene Music Critic 
Unrealized and sometimes violently explosive talent has a habit of striking when least expected. Nineteen ninety-two can't really be remembered as the high point of a lot of things. Most will remember nothing more than the halcyon days of middle school, the Gulf War, Generation X and puberty. It was during this time that the band Pavement released Slanted & Enchanted. It was good. People liked it. People also liked Crysta.I Pepsi. 
Ten years have passed. And in the release of Slanted & Enchanted: Luxe & Redux, a bomb bigger than any clear cola has been dropped on the musical world once again. Complete with an entire live show, the two-disc release boasts re-mas­tered versions of all the album tracks, plus a veritable smorgasbord of collector's nuggets. Containing a snazzy cover and a 60-page booklet that captures the spirit of the album, this release is obviously a labor of love. 

Labeling Pavement in a distinct genre is impossible. Their guerrilla styled distortion mixed with an off kilter and out of time rhythm section is reminiscent of the acid punk scene of the 80's. The band, which started as a rag-tag collective of five guys living in different states, could, like their sound, be called accidental. Experimental noise, psychedelia and a flair for the dra­matic that bordered on glam rock at times were no doubt important ingredients in Pavement's inimitable sound. They did their own thing, and people liked it. 
Even with all of the accompanying mate­
rial. 
the

Pavement 

Matador Records 

original album is unmistakable in its cohesion and singular vision. The fact that those 14 tracks hold together like a single, breathing, symbiotic creature is part of what makes the album such an accom­plishment. In the words of one spectator, "Pavement breathed like no band has done since." 
Stephen Malkmus, the vocally bipolar front man of the group, possesses an alien charisma, endearing and obtuse all at once. His manic rants on tracks like "Conduit For Sale!" and "Fame Throwa," on which Malkmus and company decry the evils of a greedy, dehumanizing music industry, are juxtaposed with his barbital sputtering of lyrics on songs like "Zurich is Stained." Malkmus voice is obviously untrained, but winsome nonetheless. Perfection, musical or other­wise, was not on the shortlist of Pavement's goal for this work. Communicating their unmistakable joy for making music was, and it is obviously there. 
On top of the original 14 album tracks, the re-release contains a recording of the band live from the Brixton Academy of London in 1992. "Watery, Domestic" the EP that the band recorded right after "Slanted" is also included on the double­disc, as are the outtakes from that release. Probably the tracks of most value to collec­tors and more experienced Pavement fans are two sessions done in the studio of the legendary radio personality and producer John Peel. At risk of placing the sequel above lhe original, the first Peel session boasts a live rendition of the song "Here" that redefines the original song in one of the most beautiful indie rock gems to date. 


The relative obscurity of the band could be considered one of the more unforgiv­able musical crimes of the past decade except that Pavement enjoyed their liminal existence on the fringe. The band acted out what it implored their audience, "Slow it down/ song is sacred." But now they are back to convert those who missed them the first time around.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Santana doesn't live up to legend 
By EMILY TUMBR!NK 
Sc~nc Music Critic 
With all due respect to Carlos Santana. one of the few guitar players who deserves legendary status. Shaman, hjs latest release, possesses very little to be admired. Pairing with Arista's hit-making producer Clive Davis, Santana has suc­cessfully created a record that sounds exactly like every other pop record on the market. 
As a result. it will no doubt be a huge commercial success for which Santana will probably win many long overdue awards. But unfortunately for fans of his earlier works, Santana, who is well· respected by nearly everyone in the music industry, has passed up a wonderful opportunity to alter the sugar-coated shal­lowness that is nowadays called "music." Instead of utilizing this opportunity, Santana has fallen into the common trap of attempting to appeal to the masses rather than staying true to his own talent as an individual musician. In other words, Carlos Santana has sold out. And it is the very trap that has ensnared him that has also corrupted nearly the entire music 

industry, causjng executives to sign artists who are incapable of playing instruments or writing songs, but who look awfully good on MTV. 
In order to ensure the success of Shaman, Santana invited many of these so-called musicians from every genre, including pop, rock, hip hop, opera and blues to accompany him on various tracks. These guests include Michelle Branch, P.O.D. and Dido among others. In fact, there are only four songs on the album that possess no guest artist. The accompanying artists' domination of the album leaves listeners wondering how Santana fits into the picture. He may as well be absent from these "radio-friendly" tracks. which pos­sess neither the style nor the qual­ity found on previous Santana albums. Gone are the interminable jams that characterized Santana's earlier projects, showcasing his pure talent as guitarist. On this most recent attempt, Santana's guitar, which needs absolutely no accompaniment, has been reduced to just another layer in the over-produced auditory assault that is Shaman. 
As if this weren't enough, the lyrics to most of the tracks are cheesy, shal­low and trite. Very little genuine emo­tion is conveyed through the lyrics, possibly because many of the songs were not written by the artists per­forming them. This lack of emotion could also have something to do with the fact that the lyrics were written in such a hackneyed and cliched manner that it would be nearly impossible to evoke emotion from anyone asked to sing them. On P.0.D.'s contribution, "America," in the true spirit of origi­nality that characterizes this album, the vocalist sings, "the way that we loved it was magical / truly wonderful 


I it was me and you so beautiful." Along similar lines, Seal on "You are My Kind" sings, "I need you / to cling to/'cause you are my kind/ you're all that I want / here in this life / 'til we are gone." These artists manage to get their point across in completely unoriginal ways. 
Shaman is obviously a very forced attempt to replicate the success of Santana's 1999 hlt Supernatural. The fact that it feels forced is perhaps the largest problem with this album. Rather than try­ing to feature the styles of various other artists who are inferior musicians, Santana should highlight what he knows and is good at: making the guitar speak. Hopefully he will come to this same con­clusion before deciding to make another album.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Album tries to replicate festival 
By JULIE BENDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
The month was June. The place, Tennessee. There were 70,000 people who traveled from all over the country, an excruciatingly hot sun and no show­ers. Like recent Woodstock concerts, such an event would seem a breeding ground for riots and violence. This peaceful gathering defied all, however. The love of pure music soothed every­thing over. 
This summer the first ever Bonnaroo festival was held in Manchester, Tenn. Amazingly, without any commercial advertisement, the festival sold out all 70,000 of its tickets in a matter of days by word of mouth only. 
Although the event primarily show­cased jam bands, the three days of music and camping included a range of acts. both new and old, encompassing all sorts of musical genres. Widespread Panic played two, multiple-hour sets, along with shows by the String Cheese Incident, Bela Fleck, Les Claypool's Frog Brigade, Ben Harper, moe., Jurassic 5, Norah Jones, Jack Johnson. Gov't Mule. Phil Lesh and Bob Weir and a final show closing tho event by Trey Anastasio.

has been released. For those who want to forever remember the talent they saw that week­end, or for those who weren't there and want an earful of what the festival was all about, Live From Bonnaroo is where it's at. 
The album kicks off with a Southern Baptist, handclapping jam. Widespread Panic's, ''Tallboy," featuring Dottie Peoples has a piano backbeat that defi­nitely "summons the holy ghost from the dition of "Tennessee Jed." "Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be. Baby won't you carry me 
back to Tennessee." Sung in a voice remarkably like Jerry Garcia's, these words sum up the feeling of the whole festival. 
Other songs included on disc one that radiate the feeling of Bonnaroo are the groove of Jack Johnson's "Rodeo Clowns," the cover of the Jethro Tull Jones' gorgeous "Nightingale." 

Disc Two gets off to a good start with Trey Anastasio jamming out on "Last Tube." Ben Harper is next with his com­bination of "Burn One Down" and "With My Own Two Hands." His gentle acoustics add a mellow flavor to the mix as he sings, "If you don't like my tire then don't come around, 'cause I'm gonna burn one down," drawing cheers from the fans. 
The String Cheese Incident, Bela Fleck, moe., the North Mississippi Allstars and a rare treat of the Blind Boys of Alabama singing "Amazing Grace" to the tune of "House of the Rising Sun," make this album completely eclectic. 
Although Live From Bonnaroo doesn't quite live up to the experience of seeing the festival in person, it does a good job of highlighting the key parts of the week­end. Still, it was the special moments during the weekend that made the festi­val a true experience. No album can relate what it was like to dance in the rain to Bela Fleck or to watch as a clus­ter of fans grabbed sticks and bounced a makeshift drum beat off garbage cans. No album can relate the feeling of trying to find your tent site amidst 70,000 other very similar tent sites at 4 a.m. 
Bonnaroo was an experience like none other. The CD is good, but live it was the best.

Ravens defender grounded again 
Associated rrcss 
OWINGS MILLS, Md. 
The losses and injuries con­tinue to mount for the Baltimore Ravens, who will probably be without three defensive starters and quarter­back Chris Redman on Sunday. 
Linebacker Ray Lewis and defensive end Michael McCrary, who sat out Sunday's 20-17 defeat in Atlanta, are not expected to play against the Cincinnati Bengals this week. They could be joined on the sideline by cornerback Chris McAlister, who sprained his left ankle against the Falcons. 
"It's a day-to-day thing," Ravens trainer Bill Tessendorf said Monday. "The problem with Chris is that he has to cut and change direction, and if he can't do that, it's a bad situa­tion." 
Lewis has missed four straight games with a partially separated left shoulder. Although he has lifted weights recently, the Ravens don't want to risk further injury to their Pro Bowl middle line­backer by rushing his return. 
McCrary has missed two games with a knee injury. If McCrary, Lewis and McAlister can't go, then linebacker Peter Boulware will be the lone starter from a defense that two years ago helped Baltimore win the Super Bowl. 
Redman, in his first season as a starter. is still bothered by back spasms. Even if he's healthy enough to play Sunday, he would almost cer­tainly serve as a backup. 
That means reserve Jeff Blake will probably make a third straight start at quarter­back. The Ravens (3-5) have lost both his starts and tum­bled into third place in the AFC North. 
Blake has played well at times, but the 11-year veteran threw three interceptions against Pittsburgh and lost a f11mble that Atlanta converted 

-
into a touchdown. Blake is 
believes he will start against 
the Bengals, although Redman 
has not formally been declared 
out for the game. 
"Hey, I'm just going week-to­
week, baby. Deal me a deck of 
cards, and I gotta play 'em," 
Blake said. 
The young Ravens weren't expected to be contenders this year, but their 3-3 start bol­stered their confidence and led them to believe that they could compete for the division crown. 
Their confidence hasn't waned in the face of several key injuries and two straight defeats. But the Ravens won't get back in the hunt unless they win the close games -all three of their road losses have been by three points or less. 
"Our challenge in the second half of the season is to take the lessons we've learned and turn those into three-point wins," coach Brian Billick said. "This group is capable of that, and that's where our focus is." 
Billick hasn't abandoned hope of guiding this team into the playoffs, but his objective is primarily to see improve­ment on a weekly basis. 
"Our focus is totally about the continued development of this team. I'm going to expect them to learn from the mis­takes they made, and hopefully we'll turn those losses into wins," he said. "They've been through a half a season now, they know what this thing is about, and I expect them to react accordingly."

MENS SOCCER 
Irish clinch home berth in Big East quarterfinals 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team was awarded a home playoff berth in the Big East quarterfi­nals on Monday. 
Ironically, it was the Eagles of Boston College who clinched it for the Irish. 
With the Eagles' 3-2 victory over then fifth-place Hutgers Monday night, the Irish remained in fourth in the Big East at the close of the confer­ence schedule, clinching a home game in the quarterfinal round this weekend. 
The Scarlet Knights' loss, com­bined with Georgetown's 1-0 win over West Virginia earlier Monday, means the Irish will meet the Hoyas in the first round. a repeat of last year's Alumni Field quarterfinal. Georgetown finished tied with Rutgers for fifth in the Big East, but the Hoyas claimed the fifth spot due to having beaten Rutgers, 1-0, on Sept. 21. 
But that wasn't the only good news the Irish received Monday. 
It was also announced that defender Kevin Goldthwaite was named to the College Soccer News Team of the Week for his offensive contributions to the two Irish victories ofthe past week. 
In Notre Dame's 2-1 victory over Virginia Tech Friday, Goldthwaite's header goal off a Chad Riley corner kick tied the score at 1-1 with under 10 min­utes remaining in the game. 
Goldthwaite also provided the cross pass assist to Greg Martin that scored the game-winning goal in Notre Dame's 1-0 victory over Loyola (Chicago) Sunday. 

The Irish finish the regular season with an 11-4-3 overall record. 
Those two victories for the Irish also boosted their national rankings, as the team moved up one spot in Monday's NSCAA/adi­da'i Coaches' Poll, from No. 19 to No. 18, trading places with Stanford, Irish head coach Bobby Clark's former team. 
In addition, the Irish also climbed one spot in the Soccer America poll also released Monday. The Irish moved from No. 16 to No. 15.

SENDWICH INDEX 
Irish slip to No. 3; Panthers continue to climb 
Unbeaten teams fell faster than George Bush's public approval ratings, serving up the most exciting weekend yet this season. Of course, it w a s exciting f o r every­a n ·e except Notre Dame. Virginia Tech, Georgia or North Carolina S t a t e who all tumbled from the ranks of the unbeaten. 
Former Sendwich No. 1 Notre Dame was shocked at home by Boston College. The Irish. clad in green jerseys, were out-Irished, fumbling seven times and losing three of them. The Eagles capital­ized on a "Happy Birthday" interception thrown by Pat Dillingham to Josh Ott that was easily returned 71 yards for the eventual winning touchdown. BC moved up 36 spots to No. 28 while the Notre Dame's fall was far less dramatic, dropping two places to No. 3.

zone. 
"The key is to score points to win," Willingham said. "[Boston College] did it better than we did. Therefore all the yardage really doesn't mean anything." 
The Irish have a good chance to improve their offensive statistics against the Midshipmen Saturday. Navy is the nation's 105th ranked defense, and Notre Dame should have little trouble moving the ball against the Midshipmen -provided the Irish hang on to the football. 
Yet Willingham said after Saturday's loss that he firmly believed the Irish only lost a foot­ball game to the Eagles, not their focus for the season. 
"We really, amazingly, don't have to change our focus," he said. "That may alarm some of you. But the truth of the matter is we work on not turning the ball over everyday. We work on creat­ing turnovers every day. So I think the plan that we have in place for our football team, the fundamental structure that we've put in place, will serve us well."

offense was ineffective. Courtesy of Pitt turnovers, their other two touchdown drives were for a mere three and 21 yards. 
The Panthers, however, didn't need perfection to beat the Hokies. as fresh­man sensation Larry Fitzgerald hauled in three touchdowns. Virginia Tech slid eight spots to No. 15. Previously unheralded Pittsburgh improved their record to 7-2 and rose to No. 16. 
Gators, dog owners yet
again 

The Georgia Bulldogs held a 1-11 record versus Florida while Steve Spurrier served as the Gators' head coach. The table, however. was set for Georgia this year, as Spurrier departed in the off­season and the Bulldogs, with their 7-0 record, had exactly three fewer losses than Florida this season. 
Not so fast. Rookie head coach Ron Zook and the Gators took over exactly where Spurrier left off, handing Georgia its first defeat of the season. The Gators broke a 13-13 dead­lock with a touchdown early in the fourth quarter and sti­fled Georgia for the rest of the game, holding on for a 20-13 win. The Bulldogs dropped three spots to No. 6 and Florida soared to No. 12. 
Yellow Jackets sting Wolfpack 
Everyone outside of Raleigh knew it was only a matter of time before N.C. State picked up its first loss of the season. While most suspected it might come later in the season against ACC powerhouse Florida State, the Wolfpack bowed out of the unbeatens with a stunning loss to Georgia Tech. 
New head coach Chan Gaily and the Yellow Jackets used calculated ball control to keep PhiUip Rivers and 
N.C. State's powerhouse offense. averaging 41 points per game, off the field. The Wolfpack took a 17-9 lead early in the fourth quarter on a T.A. McOendon touch­down run. Shortly after, Georgia Tech exploded for two touchdowns within two minutes of each other and held on for a 24-17 victory. 
Georgia Tech moved 24 places to No. _19 and N.C. State slid from No. 10 to No. 
17. The Wolfpack fell to sec­ond place in the ACC. with a 4-1 conference record, just behind Florida State (5-0). The two will meet to likely decide the ACC champ and automatic BCS bid recipient on Nov. 23 in Raleigh.

Hinske was voted AL Rookie of the Year on Monday and Jennings was voted the NL honor as the Baseball Writers' Association of America began announcing its awards for the 2002 season. 
"I just wanted to be staying in the big leagues the whole year," Hinske said. "The success I had was pretty surprising for me." 
Hinske, acquired by Toronto from Oakland last December in the deal that sent closer Billy Koch to the Athletics, won the Blue Jays' third­base job in spring training and hit .279 with 24 homers and 84 RBI. He got 19 of 28 first-place votes and nine seconds to finish with 122 points. 
Saints reinstate Carter 

The NFL on Monday ended the sus pension of New Orleans Saints cor­nerback Dale Carter, who had been prohibited from playing for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
"We got a little better today," Saints coach Jim Haslett said. 'Tm really happy to have him back." 
Carter, a four-time Pro Bowl selec­tion who had to sit out the 2000 sea­son for substance abuse, failed another test and was suspended indefinitely in July, only months after signing a seven-year, $28 million contract with the Saints. 
Carter and his brother, Saints wide receiver Jake Reed, called Haslett on 
Monday and said they had met with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. "It sounds like he said all the right things," Haslett said. 
The Saints said Carter was eligible to begin participating in team activi­ties immediately. 
"I expect him to be on the practice field tomorrow," Haslett said. 
Grimsely dies

Dawgs streamline Otters in 21-8 victory 
By ERIK POWERS and 
JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Spom Writers 
The Dawgs dominated early on Sunday, then rolled over and played dead for most of the sec­ond half before finally pulling away from the Otters 21-8. 
Playing in front of a sparse but spirited crowd, Sorin opened the game with a solid defensive stand. Alumni, seeking to estab­lish the run, carried on four ofits live snaps with little success. But the Otters were unable to stop the Dawgs when they needed to most as Alumni converted two third downs en route to a 65­yard scoring drive. A seven-yard run by Alex Roodhouse and two­point conversion off of a fake kick staked the Dawgs to an early 8-0 lead. 
"It's always good to get into the end zone," said Roodhouse, who finished with 14 carries for 44 yards. 
Alumni's multidimensional offense frequently invaded Sorin territory. Quarterback Chris Cottingham led a balanced attack, completing seven of 15 passes for 120 yards and a touchdown while rushing twice for 23 yards and another touch­down. The Dawgs employed play-action fakes, pitches and dives in order to keep the Otters off balance. 
Sorin appeared out of sync on offense in the first half. Quarterback Greg Carney had difficulty locating his receivers versus a stiff Dawgs defense, completing only two of six passes in the first half and throwing an interception. Carney's second completion occurred in the most unorthodox of ways, throwing under pressure to offensive line­man Mike Draz, who displayed surprising agility while hurdling one defender before being stopped for no gain. 
The Otters would not give up. Sorin controlled the ball for much of the second half, taking advantage of an Alumni team that appeared intent on coasting to victory. Taking over deep in Alumni territory after Pat Flaherty forced a fumble, Carney completed a 15-yard pass to E.J. Jones. On the next play, Carney snuck in from four inches away for the Otters' only touchdown. 

Stirred by Sorin's score, the Alumni offense awoke in order to drive to a first down at the Otter seven-yard line. But Sorin's defense held fast, causing Alumni to lose eight yards on three car­ries before missing a 24-yard field goal. 
With time running out in the fourth quarter, Sorin hoped to drive down the length of the field for the winning score. Before the Otters could capitalize on this momentum, however, Alumni hit Carney as he dropped back to pass and recovered the ball. Carney fumbled on a question­able call. The call went in Alumni's favor, and the Dawgs scored three plays later when Cottingham connected with Corey Harkins for a spectacular caWhile Sorin's season is over, Alumni faces Dillon in the next round of the playoffs. The Dawgs and Big Red will meet for the second time this season. Alumni won the first meeting 14-0. 
"We played Dillon in the semifi­nals last year," Roodhouse said. "It's a big game. We'll be up for it." 
Asher 21, Zahm 7 

At least one football team wearing green uniforms was suc­cessful this weekend. 
Fisher moved on to the next round of the interhall playoffs as the Green Wave defeated Zahm 21-7. 
The Fisher defense brought its A-game, intercepting Zahm quarterback Dan Burke five times, including an interception returned for a touchdown. 
"We noticed them [Zahm] warming up by passing on the

sidelines," said Fisher captain Tom Gorman. "Our coaches did a really good job of preparing us for their passing game." 
Despite the fact that Burke was largely ineffective, Zahm coach Nick Passafiume would not place sole blame on his team's senior passer. 
Burke didn't have to wait too long to make a mistake -his very first pass on the first play of the game was intercepted by Fisher cornerback Neil Vargas. The play was an attempt to trick the Green Wave, with Burke handing off to his running back, who then tossed it back to Burke for the pass attempt. 
Fisher was unable to score off the initial turnover; kicker Carl Elkins missed a 36-yard field goal attempt at the end of the drive. 
Neither team was able to score in the first half, and it took another Zahm turnover before Fisher was finally able to break the tie. 
On the Zahmbies' first drive of the second half, Burke was inter­cepted by freshman Fisher cor­nerback Matt Mitchell, who returned it 38 yards for the touchdown. The extra point by Elkins was good. 
Zahm immediately answered with its next drive, including a key 32-yard pass from Burke to wide receiver Mike Russell to the Fisher 3-yard line. Two plays later, Burke ran the touchdown in on a quarterback sneak, and kicker Pat Amato hit the extra point to tie the game at 7 -7. 
Fisher scored on its next offen­sive series, with a 55-yard touch­down pass from quarterback Andy Pfiester to running back Kameron Chappell. The extra point was blocked. 
Burke threw another intercep­tion in Zahm's next series, this time to defensive back Lee Gettler, who returned it 44 yards. Fisher was able to capitalize after taking over on the Zahm 18-yard line. 
Three plays later, Pfiester handed off to running back Kameron Chappell for a 1-yard touchdown run. The ensuing two-point conversion, a pass from Pfiester to Gorman, was good. 
Passafiume was disappointed in the loss, but said that the Zahmbies have a bright future.

MENS INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Dillon hopes to defend its interhall title 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Wrirer 
The defending interhall foot­ball champions unveiled a pass­ing attack to help pull out a close victory in their hunt for a repeat title. 
The sixth-seeded Dillon Big Red defeated third-seeded Stanford, 7 -6, at Riehle fields on Sunday afternoon. While the seeds indicate an upset, Dillon had the edge with a win over Stanford in week two of the reg­ular season, running for 180 yards in a 20-8 victory. Stanford cut the Big Red's rushing pro­duction almost in half to 97 yards on Sunday. Still, Dillon scored first and made a h11ge defensive stand on a late two­point conversion to secure a spot in the semifinals next Sunday. 
"I'm glad we pulled it through this week," said safety Michael Johnson, who had two intercep­tions on the day for the Big Red. "It was a team effort today for sure." 
Dillon's offense gained 123 net yards, 97 on the ground and 64 in the air. All 64 passing yards came on Dillon's first drive, an eight-play, 65-yard drive capped by a 38-yard touchdown pass to Ben Butwin on fourth and 12. 
"It all starts with the line and running the ball," said quarter­back Mark Zepf, who had his best passing output of the sea­son. "When we run the ball well, that opens up the passing game." 
Stanford was well aware of the Dillon offensive game plan, the same one that hammered them into the ground earlier in the season. 
"Our defense was planning on stopping the running game," said captain Adam Oyster. "I think the defensive line and line­backers did a great job. There was just one play here and one play there that didn't go our way, and we lost the game." 
The 'one play here' was the Butwin touchdown reception. At first a seemingly futile fourth down attempt, quarterback Mark Zepfs dart across the mid­dle to a leaping Butwin turned into the Big Red's only offensive output of the day. But it was enough. 
Stanford failed a two-point conversion attempt with 1 minute, 30 seconds remaining. 
"With it being the playoffs and everything, you want to try to win the game there," said Oyster. 
The Dillon defense created turnovers as well. Johnson's two interceptions halted Stanford drives during both the first and second half. 
"Anyone is happy when they can help the team out like that," said Johnson. 
Stanford's offense managed only 35 yards rushing and 57 yards passing, 47 of which came on their last drive, one that con­sumed the majority of the fourth quarter and culminated in a seven-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Rich Whitney. 

"We were planning on starting the game off hardnosed," said Whitney. "We wanted to run it until we saw what they were doing. But we were an inch off of anything. We didn't execute the way we liked." 
Walking past the Sorin/Alumni game on his way back to the dorm, Dillon quarterback Zepf revealed his preference of oppo­nent. "I want to play Alumni," he said. "They're our only loss this season, and we wouldn't want to get to the championship any other way than through them." 
Zepf will get his chance next Sunday. 
Siegfried 10, Morrissey 7 
Before the play, eight-seed Morrissey had undefeated Siegfried right where they want­ed them. Before the play, the high-octane. point-producing Siegfried offense had not gained a frrst down. 
All it took, however, was one turn of Ramblers quarterback Bill Bingle's arm. Morrissey's defense made only one mistake the whole game, but that was all the room Siegfried needed. The Ramblers advanced to the inter­hall football semifinals with a 10-7 victory at Riehle fields Sunday afternoon. 
"I am very happy about the result because we made it to another week and because it's one more step towards our goal," said Siegfried coach John Torgenson. 'Tm a little disap­pointed with the turnovers, but Morrissey is a very good team. They are not an eight seed. I felt they were one of the best teams coming into the playoffs." 
The Manorite offense was run­ning the ball better than it had all year on Sunday. Running back Nick Klein had 6 7 of his team's 101 rushing yards. 
"We wanted to try to run on them because it was not some­thing we were able to do with consistency [during the regular season]," said Klein. "We were happy with our running game, but we couldn't put it in the end zone when we had to." 
Morrissey gained 33 yards in the air. Quarterback Rick Ysasi, however, primarily kept it on the ground, gaining 21 yards and scoring on a one-yard touch­down run. The touchdown put Morrissey up at halftime, 7-3. 
"It's frustrating to lose that way," said coach John Caver. "l feel we did dominate on both offense and defense." 
The Morrissey offense, defense and special teams all did their part in a valiant effort by the Manorites. Morrissey blocked a punt to set up their only touch­down and intercepted Bingle twice. 
"It came down to one bad play," said Caver. "The defense can't let up and give them a big play like that." 
That bad play came on the first play of a fourth quarter Siegfried drive. Bill Bingle found wide receiver John Karp wide open behind the secondary. and Karp outran two pursuing Morrissey defensive backs for a game-win­ning, 95-yard touchdown. 
"I was running and I was at the 20 and I thought to myself, 'Why aren't you going any­where?" Karp said. 
Bingle and the Siegfried offense managed less than 10 yards outside of the big play. 
Bingle's two interceptions ended drives abruptly and gave Morrissey good field position. 
"I think we can do a better job holding on to the ball and capi­talizing," said Torgenson. "Bill struggled a little today. but he doesn't worry me because he's an athlete. He knows a lot of it rests on his shoulders."

Irish putting pain away and healing wounds 
By JOE fIE.TTLER 
Associare Spores Editor 
Teresa Borton made·her first shot 10 seconds into the game, her last one with less than a minute remaining and didn't miss any in between. 
The sophomore center scored a game-high 20 points. shooting 8-8 from the field and 4-4 from the free throw line to lead Notre Dame's to a 87-50 exhibition win over the Houston Jaguars Monday night. 
"I was happy with my play," said Borton, who also added nine rebounds. "It upped my confidence. I've had a year underneath my belt and that's helped, but I'm still a little weary because I know there are so many great players." 
Coach Muffet McGraw was also satisfied with Notre Dame's performance. 
"J was pleased with our defen­sive effort and I thought we did a good job on the boards," McGraw said. "I think it was a good test for us to see where we are right now. We have some things to work on, but I think there were a lot of positives." 
The Irish held the Jaguars to a dismal 1-of-22 in three-point 
-
shooting and only allowed them to make 24.2 percent of their shots all game. No Houston player scored in double figures. 
Freshman Courtney LaVere had an impressive debut, scor­ing 12 points while senior La'Tania Severe had 15 for the 
lr~~h. I thought both [Borton1 and {LaVere] played very well. They played well togeth~r. They 
from last season, Alicia Ratay and Jacqueline Batteast, both struggled to score. Ratay went 
0-7 from the field. missed all four of her three-point attempts and hit only one of four free throws to finish with one point. Batteast was 3-16 shooting and had 11 points. However, she led the team with 15 rebounds and added seven assists, four steals and three blocks. 
McGraw wasn't concerned with her stars play, especially Ratay's. 
'Tm encouraged by [her poor shooting] because we scored 87 points without her and we wouldn't have been able to do that last year," McGraw said. "I think that's a great sign for the rest of lhe team. That we do have someone ready to pick up the slack on any given night." 
Notre Dame's other freshman 
Megan Duffy did a solid job of 
running the offense and scored 
six points and added seven 
rebounds. 
"She's got a great presence on 
the court," McGraw said. "She's 
vocal and for a freshman you 
don't always expect that. I think 
she played with a lot of intensi­
ty. I think she motivated her 
teammates and got to the right 
spots [on the court]. I was really 
pleased with her effort."

LISA VEL TE/The Observer 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Two days after Notre Dame lost to Boston College 14-7 and one day after the 8-1 Irish dropped at least four spots in both major polls, the Irish watched the~··r.~ team tumhle again, this time fro· · third to seventh in the Bow Championship Series rankings. 
The challenge now for the Irish is responding to their first loss of the season. 
lf you ask the Irish, they aren't looking back on Saturday's loss-as painful as it was. Instead, they're focused on the rest of th,e season, an attitude Tyroue Willingham made pointedly clear to a dejected Irish locker room Saturday. 
"He told us there are still 
ons for us," Arnaz Battle said S.a.turday. "We can still go 11-1 and compete to be the best team 
in the country. That's what our goal is." 
Saturday's loss all but knocked the Irish out of the national championship picture, but the Irish still have a good shot at making one of the three other BCS bowls. 

And if there was any change in Willingham's demeanor after the loss, the Irish players couldn't see it.
