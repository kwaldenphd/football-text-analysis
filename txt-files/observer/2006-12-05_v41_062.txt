Notre Dame community mourns death of Brann 

Over 200 present at memorial mass for senior lost in accident 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Family, friends, classmates and members of the Notre Dame com­munity gathered at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart Monday evening for a memorial Mass to remember Caitlin Brann, 22, a senior killed in a car accident Nov. 10. 
With Brann's picture displayed beside the altar, senior Adria Helmich shared one of her fondest memories of her friend and fellow Pasquerilla East resident -the day Brann asked her to teach her how to box. 
"She put up her fists and started laughing ... I couldn't help but think that this was the same girl who dressed up as 'Kill Bill' on Halloween," Helmich said, calling it a "tremendous privilege, honor and blessing" to have been friends with Caty. 
"She was the friend you wanted to have," Helmich said. 
University President Father John Jenkins, who presided over the Mass, said although a few weeks have passed since Brann's death, her loss remains painful for her family and friends. Her death is especially tragic since she died at such a young age, Jenkins said, when she was full of life and hope and making plans for her future. 
In her short life, Brann accom­plished much and made many good friends, he said, and "we are grateful for the years that she had." 
Even as the community mourns her loss, the:,;: look forward to her eternal life, Jenkins said. 
"We remember her today with gratitude for her life and friend­ship, but we can't escape the sad­ness of losing her," he said. 
Brann's parents, brother and sister were present at the Mass. Jenkins said Brann's father told him that Caitlin had made plans to go to the Notre Dame-USC game Nov. 25. 
"She had a plane ticket, but she didn't have a ticket to the game," Jenkins said. "But she was a shrewd businesswomen, and she was confident that she was going to get that ticket." 
Jenkins encouraged the approx­imately 200 people who attended the Mass to call upon their faith to help them through their loss.

Lottery to grant2,500 bowl tickets 
By JOE PAIRULLI Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame students will be getting their share of the sugar when the Irish play the LSU Tigers Jan. 3. 
Of the 17,500 total Sugar Bowl tickets allotted to Notre Dame, 2,500 of those will be made available to students. According to Director of Ticket Operations Josh Berlo and an e-mail sent to the stu­dent body, the ticket office is, like last year, holding a lottery to give students the opportu­nity to buy tickets for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl game against LSU. The contest will be Notre Dame's second BCS game in a row. 
Students are allowed to bring up to four student IDs, including their own, to Legends on Thursday from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. to get a lottery ticket. 
If that number is one of the 2,500 numbers randomly cho­sen, the owner has the oppor­tunity to buy one ticket on Friday at Gate B of the Notr-e Dame Stadium Ticket Office between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. at a cost of $125. Students may bring up to four winning lot­tery tickets with student IDs. 
The one-ticket-per-winning­lottery-number limit is a change from last year. 
"At the request of the stu­dents we reduced the limit from two to one [ticket] per student," Berlo said. 
The list of winning numbers will be available online at

Loving Darlene Love 
The New York Times once said, "Darlene Love's thunderbolt voice is as embedded in the history of Rock­and-Roll as Eric Clapton's guitar or Bob Dylan's lyrics." Everyone knows Dylan and Clapton, but Chris Hine who is

singer of the greatest Christmas song e~r: "Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)." 
Love is a victim of circumstance, someone who had the talent to become a household name, but the people who handled her career, com­bined with the changing times and bad luck, prevented her from becom­ing a big star. 
Legendary producer Phil Spector discovered Love and her booming voice back in the early 1960s. She sang lead on a few of the producer's biggest hits -but as a guest lead singer on some of Spector's girl groups, not as a solo act. Eventually, Spector released some songs with Love listed as a solo artist, but they did not fare as well as Love's previ­ous releases. 
As the years passed in the '60s, Spector started to give his attention to the Righteous Brothers and the thinner-voiced Veronica Bennett, lead singer of the Ronettes (also Spector's love interest at the time). While Love was stuck playing second fiddle under Spector's control, other singers with less talent than Love found success under different pro­ducers. Had Love been in a different place during this time, her career could have taken a different direc­tion. 
Spector worked with some of the top songwriters of the day, but he did not give Love their better material. Instead, Spector would give Mann!Weil's "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" to the Righteous Brothers while giving Love songs with less hit potential. Then, as the British Invasion hit, Love was stuck singing her heart out for Spector. By the late 1960s, Spector's records were out of vogue, and Love found herself singing backup for more popular acts of the tim~. 
Nevertheless, Love did manage to make one record under Spector that ensures that countless generations will get to hear her voice. 
She recorded "Christmas" for Spector's now-legendary Christmas album. As was the case with previous songs, Spector gave the Ronettes the first crack at the song, but Bennett's voice could not summon the strength the song requires. For once, Love was in the right place at the right time. The song, featuring Love's booming vocal, has become a mod­ern classic. 
After researching Love's story, the song has a different meaning. It serves as a reassurance that even if the hands of fate and time combine to drag you down, if you struggle and fight them hard enough, you will get them to loosen their grip even if for just one moment. Darlene Love took advantage of that moment.

Manager arrested for garbage in lard 
BEIJING -A factory manager in east China has been arrested for using grease from swill, sewage, pesticides and recycled industrial oil to make lard for human con­sumption, state media said Monday in the coun­try's latest food scare. 
Ying Fuming, a manag­er at the Fanchang Grease Factory in Taizhou, a city in Zhejiang province, sold the lard at half the price of other wholesalers while promising that his prod­uct met safety standards, the Shanghai Daily said. 
The factory was shut down and local health and food authorities began an investigation this year after an anony­mous tip indicated that the plant "recycled large amounts of used grease to process substandard lard," the newspaper said. 
Haircut could get principal in hot water 
ALBUQUERQUE -The principal of Hio Grande High School could be in trouble for taking one of his students to a barber shop without permission of the pupil's parents.

"Students should not be taken off of campus by any staff member without parental permission," said Higo Chavez, district spokesman. 
Sanchez said he thought Fidel Maldonado Jr.'s hair style-the number "505" and a Zia symbol shaved into the back of his head -was a gang haircut.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Group plans to include Fo"Wlkes at meeting 
By LIZ HARTER 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) members voted to invite chief informa­tion officer Keith Fowlkes to their final meeting of the semester Monday night. 
Fowlkes wishes to visit BOG to discuss issues that arose when President Carol Ann Mooney held an information session with the Board three weeks ago. 
"[Fowlkes will] discuss ResNet and anything at infor­mation technology that we have questions about," said Student Body President Susan Mcllduff. 
Fowlkes approached Mcllduff about speaking to BOG, but the board first had to invite him to a meeting to address the issue. 
Technology commissioner Elizabeth D'Aurora announced that she has also talked to Fowlkes about ResNet, and she speculated on some topics that he might address. 
"He [will] probably talk a lit­tle bit about the residence hall clusters and why they don't have printers, and what we can do to change that," D'Aurora said. "I think it would be really helpful." 
After agreeing to invite 
Fowlkes to an upcoming meet­ing, BOG discussed the ongo­ing "12 Days of Christmas" event. Sponsored by the senior board, the event raises money to purchase presents and dec­orations for needy families in the South Bend area. 
"At the bake sale [held Thursday in LeMans Hall], they sold $400 [worth of baked goods]. and we've sold over 100 '12 Days' passes and over 100 to-go mugs," senior class president Kat Kindt said. "The sophomore board also donated $150 from their dance. It's going well." 
In Other BOG News: 
+The freshman board is sponsoring an Angel Tree that is set up in the lobby of McCandless Hall. 
+Christmas Around the World will take place tomor­row in Reinbeaux Lounge in LeMans Hall. 
+The annual Late Night Breakfast will take place Monday at 10 p.m. The break­fast is open to all students, including those who live off­campus. 
+"The DaVinci Code" and "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" will be shown in Vander Vennet the­ater this weekend.

ect." 
The "we" Woodward refers to is the group of University repre­sentatives accompanying both Jenkins and Woodward to Uganda, including Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers, Director of NDMDI Father Bob Dowel, Assistant Director in the Office of the President Tim Lyden and Africana Studies department chair Richard Pierce. 
Woodward said the group is now departing a day later than originally scheduled due to Notre Dame's Sugar Bowl game Jan. 3. 
The group is getting together tomorrow to talk to Dowd, who has been "back for about a week" from his November trip to Uganda, Woodward said. 
"I think you'll see a bigger trip in the spring," Woodward said. "For now, we're really [going to Uganda] to listen ... The first step is always listening to find out what help they need." 
In a letter 'to potential group members The Observer obtained from the Office of News and Information, Jenkins said the Millennium Village Project (MVP) has four main goals: increasing agricultural productivity, connecting people to markets and information, eradicating preventable disease and expanding access to basic healthcare and education. 
"The purpose of the trip is to explore and build relationships in Africa and specifically Uganda; to learn about the region's opportunities and chal­lenges; and to highlight our commitment to the Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative (MDI)," Jenkins said. "As a reflection of our mission as a Catholic university, I am hopeful that we can expand our knowledge and consider ways to collaborate with those who live and work in Africa." 
Jenkins described Uganda as a place of "cultural richness." Slightly smaller than the state of Oregon, Uganda is home to nearly 28 million people, 85 percent of whom are Christian. Forty different languages are spoken throughout the country, Jenkins wrote, though "English is the nation's official language and Luganda is the most widely spoken language." 
Part of Jenkins' goal in travel­ing to Uganda, however, is to consider ways to address the country's various educational, economic and health-related difficulties. 
Despite its cultural richness, Uganda has a 4.1 percent adult prevalence rate of AIDS/HIV and a life expectancy of 51.68 years for men and 53.69 years for women, Jenkins wrote. 
His letter acknowledged some of the additional problems plaguing Uganda that will likely be addressed during "a produc­tive exchange with those who live and work in Uganda." 
"Literacy rates lag behind many other countries. Only 87 percent of men above the age of 15 are able to read and write, and only 77 percent of women above the age of 15 are able to read and write," Jenkins said. "In contrast, in the U.S., 99 per­cent of both men and women 
are literate." 
According to a tentative itin­erary, the group's first event will be attending a celebration of Holy Cross final vows in the country's capital of Kampala. Other noteworthy events include dinner with the Holy Cross community and Notre Dame alumni in Jinja, touring the Holy Cross grounds and meetings with Millennium Village science coordinator David Siriri, the village council and villagers. 

"During our trip, we are arranging to meet with various people including leaders of the Ugandan community, members of the Holy Cross community and the leadership team of Uganda Martyrs University," Jenkins said. 
Jenkins and the rest of the group will visit the site of the partner village -probably located in the vicinity of Nkozi -with Millennium Village Project coordinator for Uganda Johnson Nkuuhe Jan. 9, 
Time is also set aside for visi­tors to "process Kampala, Jinja, Mbarara, Ruhiira, Nkozi [and] urban poverty versus rural poverty" in preparation for group discussions. 
Visiting the Shrine to the 45 Catholic and Anglican Ugandan Martyrs executed in 1886 -a site visited by several popes ­may also be on the agenda. 
According to the schedule, Jenkins will meet with the Bishops of Uganda Jan. 11 in Kampala for a luncheon and with the Uganda Martyrs University Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellor and Deans Jan. 12. 
The group will be spending most nights at the Hotel Africana in Kampala.

Brazil creates new protected areas 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -A swath of Amazon rain forest the size of Alabama was placed under government protection Monday in a region infamous for violent conflicts among loggers, ranchers and environmentalists. 
The protected territory totals 57,915 square miles of the Guayana Shield region, an area of Amazon forest stretching across international borders that contains more than 25 percent of the world's remaining humid tropical forests and the largest remaining unpolluted fresh water reserves in the American tropics. 
The protected areas will link to existing reserves to form a vast preservation corridor eventually stretching into neighboring Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. While the entire Guaycma Shield corridor is not yet protected, portions of it in each country are now covered.

Bush meets with Shiite leader 
President not satisfied with Iraqi efforts to curb extremist violence 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Pres­ident Bush told a Shiite political leader on Monday the United States is not happy with progress in Iraq and sought the cleric's help to curb extremists and terrorists trying to undermine the struggling new democracy. 
Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim said U.S. troops need to stay in Iraq to help deal with escalating violence. He also told Bush that Iraq welcomes help from other nations, including those in the Middle East, so long as they do not bypass Iraq's political process. . 
"Iraq should be in a posi­tion to solve Iraqi prob­lems," al-Hakim told Bush after they met in the Oval Office for more than an hour. 
Some consider al-Hakim. who lived in exile in Iran for years, a more powerful political figure than Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al­Malild.

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street rallies despite Pfizer 
NEW YORK -Wall Street surged higher Monday as investors put aside Pfizer Inc.'s decision to halt development of a key drug and focused instead on another series of takeover deals. 
Pfizer shares fell by about 12 percent after the company stopped the development of the cholesterol drug torcetrapib because of deaths and cardiovascular problems among people taking the drug during clini­cal trials. The stock was also downgraded by several Wall Street analysts on concern that Pfizer's revenue growth will now weak­en. 
The news was offset by several merger announcements that reinforced the belief that companies are optimistic about the economy and therefore are willing to take some risks. Leading them was Bank of New York Corp.'s $16.5 billion deal to buy rival Mellon Financial Corp. to create an asset management powerhouse. 
Calderon faces healthy job market 
MEXICO CITY -As a man who touts cre­ating jobs as the cure-all for Mexico's ills, President-elect Felipe Calderon couldn't be taking office at a better time. 
The economy is projected to expand by as much as 4.8 percent by year's end -its fastest growth in six years -thanks to exploding business in the construction, automobile and service industries. Iligh oil prices have poured money into government coffers, the peso has remained stable and Mexico is on track to create 1 million jobs this year. 
That makes things much easier for Calderon, who took office Friday promising to build an economy that creates enough jobs so that millions of Mexicans don't have to cross into the United States. 
"Mexico has all it needs to be a country that receives investment and generates employment for its people," Calderon said, voicing optimism in his inaugural address as president. 
The vast divide between rich and poor has fed the social tensions that have rip­pled across Mexico since Calderon won the July 2 election by less than 1 percent.

Conservative action: not an oxytnoron 
The football season and the Britney Spears/K-Fed breakup loom large as we ncar year's end and begin to assess the events of 2006, but it is also important to consid­er the progress that Notre Dame students have made toward overcoming the common view that we arc part of' an apathetic student body. Over the past 12 months, the Notre Dame com­munity saw the formation of many new student group initiatives which have been noteworthy. Some of' these initia­tives sprang from existing student clubs, like Amnesty International's fair trade campaign or the Progressive Student Alliance's "iRock for iRaq" concert to benefit Iraqi civilians. Others, like NDASK and CLAP, are the work of new organizations devoted to a single issue. Though 1 strongly dis-Forward the agree with some of thesP. groups' posi-Revolution tions, I do applaud them for heighten­ing the level of dialogue on campus and for their commit­ment to improving our university. 
In a previous column, I wrote about the necessity of enacting change on an individual basis, and these groups are doing just that. For example, on my way through the Huddle on Monday morning I saw a member of' Amnesty International speaking to another student about the AIDS crisis. The student ultimately signed a petition in support of increased action to address the epidemic. One-on-one dis­cussions are necessary for any attempt at social change to reach a critical mass of support, and individual transfor­mation is essential for enacted changes to gain social acceptance. However, it is extremely difficult for such a critical mass to be achieved without focus and organiza­tion. 
Unfortunately, no student group at Notre Dame provides the focus and organization to conservatives that the PSA and others give to progressives. Each of the student organi­zations that are widely considered conservative lack the characteristics needed to organize conservative campaigns for grassroots change on campus. Right to Life is one of Notre Dame's largest clubs, and is effective in organizing students and presenting its ideas, but its focus is limited to life issues. The Irish Rover would be another candidate, and has been successful over the past few years in present­ing a reasoned conservative viewpoint on a broad range of issues, but as a publication, student mobilization does not fall within its mandate. Finally, the College Hepublicans, while effective in mobilizing students for election activities, is only able to argue for the Hepublican position. and not a general conservatiw1 platform. What is needed at Notre Dame is a new student group which can develop dassically liberal and/or socially conservative initiatives to address the problems our campus faces and win support for those initiatives on a one-to-one basis. 

Though Notre Dame is widely believed to be a conserva­tive campus, the progressives here have done far more to push for chango in the community. As I said earlier, they should be commended for their effort and commitment. To the detriment of' the University, however, this creates stu­dent initiatives for change that are built solely on progres­sive ideas and presuppositions. A conservative student organization is necessary to argue persistently and tireless­ly for alternativn solutions which take a different approach. By strongly challenging progressive initiatives, the result­ing market of ideas will shape b11tter policies and more efll­ciPnt solutions which are better than anything one group could develop on its own. 
Similarly, conservatives on campus must do more to high­light problems which go unnoticed by existing progressive student groups and to take the lead on efforts to bring greater freedom and justice to Notrn Dame and the sur­rounding community. A conservative stud11nt organization is needed to mobilize support for more equitable treatment of' married students, a strong food bank auxiliary organiza­tion on campus and an end to the de facto ban on student businesses, among other things. Any action that a conser­vative organization would take could and should be chal­lenged by campus progressive organizations and vice versa. 
John Henry Newman, in his essay "The Idea of a University," eloquently describes a university as "the place to which a thousand schools make contributions; in which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to find its equal in some antagonist activity, and its judge in the tribu­nal of truth." If we are to achieve Newman's ideal, we need both a progressive and a conservative student organization to take the ideas articulated by the movements on campus and mobilize students for change, one person at a time. The Notre Dame family deserves better than the current lopsided system.

Clain1s regarding Zahn1 Hall unfounded 
The first thing I would like to address is that the Zahm Hall Staff works hard to make sure all240 of its residents feel a part of the community. However, the intent of my article is to clarify a few of the inaccurate assumptions made by Ian MacKay ("Zahm Hall more than just a building") in the Dec. 1 edition ofThe Observer. 
MacKay states, "TACH (There Are Children Here) is no longer running so the Foodsales money stays in the dorm and finances are up." Although it is true that proceeds are no longer being sent to TACH, it is wrong to assume that profits are staying in the dorm. After the Zahm Hall staff sadly discovered that TACH would no longer be running, we believed that it was most beneficial to send the pro­ceeds to Coach Weis' charity Hannah and Friends. In fact, Zahm has several projects in the works for next semester to increase its donations to Hannah and Friends. 
QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"Imperfection is beauty; madness is genius. And it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. 
Marilyn Monroe actress 

The second point I would like to correct is MacKay's need to remind us that "Zahm is a place lor students to live and not a business." Three to four years ago, Foodsales was nearly 1,000 dollars in debt to its vendors and was unable to benefit any charities, including TACH. Thanks to the tireless work made by the Foodsales managers and several others, Zahm Foodsales has nearly tripled its profits since the end of its first year and now has the ability to make significant contribu­tions. 
Better fact-fmding through direct dis­cussions with people who actually know about Zahm's policies and programs will prevent such overly broad and unfounded assertions in the future.

I am happy to report that this is not the case. To the con­trary, the Legal Aid Clinic remains one of the univer­sity's most significant, yet least known, community outreach programs. This semester, thirty law stu­dents and four on-site facuity members have provid­ed legal services to over two hundred low-income clients in the South Bend area. 
The Legal Aid Clinic, located several blocks south of campus at 725 Howard Street, is the Law School's teaching clinic. It plays a similar role to a teaching hospital at a medical school, allowing law students an opportunity to engage in hands-on learning by representing clients under close faculty supervision. But the Clinic is about more than teaching lawyering skills. In the best tradition of community-based learning, it allows students to see firsthand the chal­lenges facing the poor, the mentally ill, immigrants, the elderly and other marginalized groups, and to put Catholic social teaching into action by represent­ing those persons in the legal system. 
As part of their work in the Clinic, o.ur students also present public education programs on areas of the law in which they have developed expertise. This semester, the students made presentations at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Madison Center and the Robinson Center. In addi­tion, at the request of Student Government, and as reported in The Observer, our students made a pres­entation on landlord-tenant lawto undergraduate students considering an off-campus move. 
Katherine Leahy apparently mistook this last pres­entation as an indication that the Clinic now repre­sents undergraduate students (we do not) or that it has lessened its commitment to serving the poor (we have not). The Clinic does attempt to be responsive to the needs of the university community, however, and has previously accepted invitations to speak to employees about end-of-life planning issues and to international students about housing issues. · 
With respect to Ms. Leahy's concern regarding the needs of immigrants, it is true that the Clinic's capacity for immigration work has been reduced this year by the departure of one of its facuity mem­bers. I am happy to report, however, that the Law School is in the process of hiring a new clinical fac­ulty member who will focus exclusively on immigra­tion law beginning next fall. 
Earlier today, Clinic students attended the last classroom session of the fall semester. I invited the students to share with one another what they have accomplished for their clients this term. Two stu­dents recorded lists of accomplishments on the white board for twenty minutes without pausing. Our students saved houses from foreclosure, helped immigrants obtain legal status, helped reform a nursing home, secured recoveries for defrauded consumers, arranged guardianships for mentally ill clients, helped a terminally ill young mother prepare a will and provide for care for her surviving chil­dren, recovered security deposits wrongly withheld by landlords from poor tenants, helped elderly clients prepare wills, health care powers, and other end-of-life instruments, secured benefits for dis­abled children and aduits, pushed for better com­munity living opportunities for the developmentally disabled and worked to end illegal debt collection practices. That's just the beginning of the list. Notre Dame can be proud of the service that the Clinic provides.

Band does its best 

As a band alumnus, I was a bit upset when I read the Nov. 29letter to the editor titled "Band Often Overlooked." Truthfully, the line that upset me the most was, "Ifthe band wants to be thought of as so important to school spirit then I think the band shouid understand their responsibility." Being a devout Notre Dame football and band fan, I understand the sentiment that was portrayed in the article, but I believe this statement crossed the line. 
Based on personal experience, I know that all the band members wish that they couid travel to all the away games­and especially the big games -but the money is just not there to support such big trips across the country. With over 350 members in the band, it wouid be a huge financial burden on the band· program to support this costly trip to Los Angeles since the funding is not provided by the football program, but by donors and "fundraisers" like selling CDs, T-shirts and the like. Usually, the band only has enough funds to travel to one away game. Some years, the band is lucky enough to travel to two games, but one is always a close game like Michigan, Michigan State or Purdue. When I was a student, the only away trips, other than bowl games, that we traveled to were Pittsburgh and Florida State, both of which we drove to by bus. 
The band knows their responsibility and they show their loy­alty by volunteering hours of their time every week, spending over ten hours every football saturday preparing for the game and supporting the team and fans ..Band members do not do what they do for money or credits, but for the love of music and Notre Dame football (they do not receive any scholarships and only receive one credit for their time and effort). Therefore, before you blame the administration or the band for not traveling to every big game, please keep in mind that the band does its best to travel to as many trips as finances allow them to and that the band takes its responsibility to the team and to the fans very seriously.

Zahm losing respect 
I wanted to respond to the first part in The Observer's two-part series on the changes in Zahm Hall ("Zahm struggles with cuiture shift", Nov. 29). I am a former Zahm resident, now living off campus. While I now recognize the triviality of dorm rivalries and the importance placed on which dorm one ends up in, I do believe that every dorm is unique and offers its residents a special place and atmosphere in which to live, learn, and grow. That is perhaps why I was so excited upon receiving that package from the Office of Residence Life and Housing prior to my freshman year, indicating that I wouid be joining the ranks of illustrious Zahm residents. 
Things have changed, and as the first article indicated, we only hear the stories of times past, of all the crazy things that went down and all the fun that was had. Sure, we had our own fun, but my time in Zahm has left a bitter taste in my mouth and a resentful feeling toward dorm life. I disagree with Joe Cussen's comments that "visiting" and "panel­ing" were not really that bad. I participated in those activities too, and am by no means a saint. They are behaviors that are both physically destructive to the dorm and emotionally damaging to some of the resi­dents, and I see why the University wanted to stop them. 
However, Cussen alluded to the quintessential aspect of Zahm ­respect. This one word embodies all that was Zahm, and is the most regrettable aspect of the drastic changes that have taken place in the past three and a half years. The problem is that Parrish never showed (and still does not show) the respect needed to foster good relations in the dorm. He dictates his policies without making an effort to reach out to the students. I was both a Frosh-0 commissioner and dance commis­sioner during my time at Zahm, but I made one poor decision during spring break, inappropriately calling Parrish and sharing my thoughts with him. I did not use inappropriate language nor did I personally attack Parrish; I simply shared my thoughts. Upon returning to cam­pus, I immediately apologized to Parrish, but did not hear back from him until a week later when I received my letter from ResLife. Despite my otherwise exemplary record in the dorm, helping plan and coordi­nate functions, South Bend volunteer work and being active on both the Interhall soccer and hockey teams, Parrish recommended my removal from Zahm, and so it was. That is simply a lack of respect. To this day, Parrish has still not even formally accepted my apology. 
All Zahm residents wanted from Parrish was respect. There were certain things about Zahm that certainly needed to change -I have no quarrel with that. But changes could have occurred in much better ways, and in the end the residents of the dorm are worse off because of what has happened. Instead of treating us like aduits, Parrish treats us like children. The community is gone and what is left is just another building on campus, and that is just a shame.

A Notre Dam.e experience? 
As we were getting ready for our big show in the green room, one of my fellow performers in Asian Allure said, "Shows like Keenan Revue are considered a part of the 'Notre Dame experience' but shows put on by muiticuitural groups such as Asian Allure, Black Images and Latin Expression are never considered a 'must-do Notre Dame experience'." Why is that? 
Why is it that making jokes about Saint Mary's College students and Zahm Hall is part of the so­called "Notre Dame experience" but shows put on by minority groups on this campus are not? Is it merely because Keenan Revue has been running longer than these other shows? Ifso, Asian Allure celebrated its tenth anniversary this year-is a decade not long enough to be seeped into the Notre Dame tradition? 
Some say that many other shows on this campus such as the annual Welsh Family Dance Show and PEMCO musical also are not considered as "Notre Dame experiences" because there are just too many activities on campus for every such event to be considered. Although this is true, if many make it a point to go to LaFortune at midnight of Monday before finals to see Zahm's annual "bun run," then shouid we not make it more of a point to support the various muiticuitural events on campus? 
Many often describe Notre Dame students as being "too nice." Perhaps we are so cautious that we might disturb still water that we gently tiptoe around or even avoid difficuit questions. However, still water contained will eventually rot. We must disturb still water by asking difficult questions and engaging in active discussion to allow ideas to flow. 
An hour in a freshman year Contemporary Topics class is not enough to raise awareness and pro­voke active discussion. It has to be up to the students. We must make active discussion a part of the Notre Dame experience, whether it be at lunch at the dinning halls or a formal discussion in the classrooms. We must disturb still water and confront our own stereotypes, prejudices and igno­rance of other cuitures, ethnic groups and race. Most importantly, we must create an environment that is in agreement with our University's mission: to include all those who are not like ourselves, to allow every student to feel that they are part of the Notre Dame experience.

Keep fighting ticket policy 
While I am not a student at Notre Dame, for var­
. ious reasons, I follow the news at the University. In following the story on the updated ticket policy ("Ticket problems remain unsolved", Dec. 1) and the feedback carried in The Observer, I offer only one brief remark. As a student at The University of Texas at Austin, the idea of anyone having guaranteed tickets amazes me. It makes sense with the size of Notre Dame compared to the size of the Stadium, but, still be thankful for the acces­sibility of tickets. That being said, please do keep complaining to Notre Dame athletics. The more noise made, the more Notre Dame athletics must make some sort of response. I hope that if a change in policy must be made, a student adviso­ry board is given a voice in the issue. Good luck on a policy reversal!

MOVIE REVIEWS 
~Happy Feet' can't quite blend cute critters, issues 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Tap-dancing penguins? Who on earth would watch tap-dancing penguins for 90 minutes? 
Before "Happy Feet," such a question could be asked with a legitimate level of incredulity. After "Happy Feet," however, such a question seems unnecessary. 
Having remained the top grossing film at the box office since its release, it's safe to say that "Happy Feet" has at least found financial success with its blend of "be yourself' beliefs and environmental advo­cacy. 
The issue with the fllm lies in that blend­ing -something that, unfortunately, the film does not do as well as it should have. "Happy Feet" is essentially two films ­the first being a posi­long partners are those whose heart songs mesh perfectly with their own. What makes Mumble unique, however, is his "heart song" -Mumble cannot sing. Instead, Mumble tap dances. 
The overall message of the first half deals with Mumble's differences, as seen by his surrounding community and our ability to· accept the difrerences of those around us -not an uncommon moral in modern children's films. 
The cuteness factor of "Happy Feet" is very high, and, especially during the first half, is welcome and joyous. Mumble's parents, Memphis and Norma Jean (voiced by Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, respectively), are funny and good-natured, despite being in conflict regarding their social outcast of a son. The moments during Mumble's childhood are by far the cutest and most amusing -the

DiCaprio's latest highlights conflict diamonds 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
For many movies these days, it isn't enough to simply be an adventure movie, a comedy or a romance. Often when movies try to tackle too many ideas and genres at once, they manage to accom­plish nothing at all. "Blood Diamond" mostly succeeds at try­ing to be everything all

a father trying to reunite his family. Although its scope is large -and at times seems like too much for the film to handle -the final product is an interesting movie that is only mildly unsatisfying. 
Conflict, or blood, diamonds are illegally mined gems -often coming from war zones -that are used to finance insur­gency or war efforts. The issues surround­ing the trade of these diamonds set up the film's background. 
"Blood Diamond" is set in 1999 during the civil war in Sierra Leone and centers on the exploits of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). an ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe and diamond smuggler. Early on in the film he meets with Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a local fisher­man. Although both are native Africans, they have led very different lives -lives whose sole point in common is the search flict, or blood, dia­
monds. Bowen agrees to help Archer and Vandy seek the diamond in exchange for information on the diamond dealers. 
Ultimately, the movie is about discover­ing what is important and valuable in the life of each individual. To accomplish this, director Edward Zwick structures the movie as a journey for each of the charac­ters in which they grow from having per­sonal, selfish goals to sacrificing their desires in order to help others. 
While raising concern regarding the conflict diamonds and their effect on Africa is the overriding mission of the film, "Blood Diamonds" hauntingly highlights another world-crisis -that of child sol­diers. Solomon's son, Dia, is captured by the RUF, allowing the audience to witness the process by which children are brain­washed and forced to commit horrible film reaches emotional depths during this portion that the quickly resolved conclu­sion is not entirely able to counter. Seeing Mumble in a zombie-like state of depres­sion while captured in an aquarium is efi'ective, certainly, if the purpose of the film is to increase its audience's aware­ness of ongoing struggles in the environ­ment. For what has been publicized widely as a children's film about accepting differ­ences, it is, to say the least, surprising. 

The strange blending of live-action (all humans in the movie are filmed and digi­tally inserted into the animated whole) and computer animation is somewhat dis­tracting, especially during the ftlm's fmal moments. While in previous children's films, such as 1996's "Space Jam," com­bining two media is obviously intended and effective, in the CGI world of "Happy Feet," it just seems odd. 
Ultimately, where the film suffers is in its attempt to widen the normal thematic scope of a holiday children's movie. The message of preservation and protection is a timely one-however, for "Happy Feet," it proves to be too much for the film to handle.

acts of violence. One of the film's most powerful images depicts a boy soldier blindfolded and forced to shoot a man against a wall. 
Director Edward Zwick is familiar with the "action with a message" genre, having directed "Courage Under Fire," "Glory" and "The Last Samurai." While "Blood Diamond" is politically relevant and note­worthy for bringing a new topic to the movie screen, its efforts to jump between issues and genres hurt its strength as a whole. Its weakest aspect is the script, written by Charles Leavitt ("K-19"). 
Fortunately, the mediocre writing is counter-balanced by the outstanding per­formances delivered by all of the major actors. Once the audience moves past DiCaprio's forced accent, it is easy to see that his performance in "Blood Diamond" will be remembered as one of his best so far. 
Much like the topical diamonds, "Blood Diamond" certainly has its flaws. However, those flaws are far outweighed by the performances and heart, easily making the film one to see. ·

Older television shows find new life this fall 
There's an old jazzy song called "Everything Old is New Again." I know this because I danced a tap solo tD it in 7th grade. It was a sweet little number for my first ever competition dance solo and the owner of the studio choreo­graphed it for me. It was the big time, trust me. The lyrics say, "Don't throw the past awayNou might need it some rainy

old is new again." 
One can even apply these words to the current television season. Shows, techniques and even actors from the past are suddenly revived and new once more. Unfortunately, not many people are taking notice of these resurrections. 
'The O.C.": "The O.C." has risen from the dead in its fourth season, but the rat­ings prove that no one is noticing or watching. Nov. 30 brought in only 3.6 mil­lion viewers compared to the 24.3 million watching "Grey's Anatomy." It's true that the show is playing in the most competi­tive timeslot of the week, but with the for­tunate death of Mischa Barton's Marissa Cooper, 'The O.C." is having fun again. Kaitlin, Marissa's younger sister, is the ultimate scene stealer and a perfect com­plement to mother Julie. When Summer went to Brown and stopped shaving her legs, Taylor stepped in and became the new female comic relief. Her budding romance with Ryan is all too welcome, since she has more spunk and energy than the empty-inside Marissa ever did. 
"Saturday Night Live": Believe it or not, "SNL" is becoming funny again. It's been painful to watch since the cast from the Will Ferrell years abandoned ship for smoother waters, but with the talent of fresh meat such as Groundlings veteran Kristen Wiig, the 32nd season is looking promising. 
Wiig is the new powerhouse of "SNL," though this has yet to be acknowledged by the show or by mainstream media. Her straight-faced awkwardness in this sea­son's "Car Pool" sketch with Alec Baldwin created one of the greatest and funniest sketches in recent memory. Unlike the overrated Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz, Wiig never breaks, proving herself as a comedian and a professional. 
"How I Met Your Mother": This series isn't exactly old, and neither is the multi­camera format that it uses, but its core concept is -singles in Manhattan looking for friendship and love accompanied by a laugh track. No big deal. However, "Mother" takes this antiquated premise and somehow fmds a way to make it new. It's not an exact "Friends" rip-off. There are five friends instead of six, and they hang out at a bar instead of a coffee house, but "Mother" has two people that "Friends" never did-Bob Saget and Doogie Howser. 
Yes, Saget is nothing more than the nar­rator, but it's· refreshing to hear him nar­rate this series instead of "America's Funniest Home Videos." Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is Chandler and Joey

molded into one super sarcastic ladies' man. The situations are fresh, and fortu­nately the series is too young to "jump the shark" by desperately making someone pregnant. 
Sometimes revisiting the old welcomes all kinds of new. Even "The View" is renewing itself with loud-mouthed, give­away-happy Rosie O'Donnell. The electric debates between liberal Rosie and conser­vative Elizabeth are enough to keep any­one tuned in, even without drunken appearances by Danny DeVito. 
However, with a media transfixed by the happenings of "Grey's," a groundbreaking youth-oriented series is in danger of get­ting cancelled. With the full-season pick­ups of "Studio 60" and "30 Rock," the show that inspired them both is being written off as past its prime. And with the (well-deserved) media attention of single­camera comedies, one actually good multi-camera sitcom isn't getting nearly enough coverage. 
The old may be new again, but whether or not the audience will notice remains to be seen.

'A Piece of My Heart' inspects Vietnam war

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Oklahoma St. at Syracuse 7 p.m., ESPN 
Associated Press 
STANFORD, Calif. ­Stanford opened the foot­ball season full of optimism based on a renovated sta­dium, an offense that returned nearly intact and progress that was made in Walt Harris' first year as head coach. 
That quickly ended when the stadium was often half­empty, the skill players went down with injuries and the Cardinal finished with their worst record in more than four decades. 
All of that played into the decision Monday to fire Harris after his second sea­son and begin the search for a new coach who can win under the difficult cir­cumstances at Stanford. 

"This has been a tough year," athletic director Bob Bowlsby said. "In some measure this decision was not made as a result of being 1-11 as much as it was a result of not seeing the progress in some of the critical areas we would have hoped for after two years." 
Harris finished his two­year stint with a 6-17 record after losing 26-17 in the Big Game to California on Saturday. He had the shortest tenure of any Stanford coach since Rod Dowhower left after one season in 1979 with a 5-5­1 record. 
IN BRIEF 
Mariners strengthen outfield, sign Guillen to one-year deal 
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -Jose Guillen and lchiro Suzuki in the same outfield -Seattle manager Mike Hargrove has never had two arms so strong side-by-side. 
The Mariners and Guillen agreed on a one-year, $5.5 million contract Monday with a $9 million mutual option for 2008, giving Seattle a starting right fielder and a danger­ous bat in the middle of the order. 
The deal was the first formal sign­ing of the four-day baseball winter meetings that began Monday. 
Guillen missed much of the 2006 season following reconstructive sur­gery on his right elbow. The Mariners hope his addition is only a start because they want to upgrade their starting rotation. 
''I'm just looking forward to this opportunity to try to get back on board and have the success that I've had before," Guillen said. 
The Cardinal finished with the most losses in school history and the worst record since an 0-10 mark in 1960. 
Stanford has struggled mightily since Tyrone Willingham left for Notre Dame following the 2001 season. They have not had a winning season in five years under Buddy Teevens and Harris, going just 16-40. 
Bowlsby admitted it might not be "fair" to fire Harris after only two sea­sons but that he had to do what was best for the school. 
"I think the most critical assessment I had to make was does investing another year present the likely pos­sibility of making substan­tial improvement," he said. "If I couldn't answer that affirmatively, which I ulti­mately didn't, I felt it was better to make the change now than wait more time." 
Harris was a disciplinari­an who clashed with some players, including line­backer Michael Okwo, who briefly quit the team in November. Players com­plained of a communica­tion gap with the coaching staff. 
"It was maybe just a bad fit," receiver Mark Bradford said. "Maybe we didn't respond to the way that was his style of coach­ing." 

Staten Island speedway plans halt as New York waits for track 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-International Speedway Corp. scrapped plans Monday to build a track on Staten Island, stalling NASCAR's dream to bring a race to the New York area. 
"While we are disappointed that we could not complete the speedway development on Staten Island, our enthusiasm for the metropolitan New York market is in no way dampened," ISC president Lesa France Kennedy said. "We continue to view the region as a prime loca­tion for a major motorsports facili­ty. " 
France Kennedy heads ISC, the publicly traded sister company of NASCAR -which was founded by her grandfather and currently chaired by her brother, Brian France. 
Both companies badly want to expand NASCAR into the New York metropolitan area. 
NCAA appoints broker to handle Final Four ticket re-sales 
INDIANAPOLIS -Final Four ticket­holders will now have the option of reselling tickets to an officially sanc­tioned NCAA broker. 
The governing body announced Monday that RazorGator Experiences will be the official ticket, hospitality and hotel package provider. 
Besides creating travel packages, fans can now negotiate with the company to resell unused tickets. Previously, fans whose team lost in the national semifi­nals resorted primarily to ticket scalp­ing to sell unwanted seats. 
"RazorGator Experiences has the expertise and the resources to help the NCAA significantly reduce activities that taint the Men's Final Four, such as the unauthorized sale of NCAA event tick­ets, which not only limit revenue for student-athlete programs, but also put our fan base at risk," NCAA senior vice president Greg Shaheen said in a writ­ten statement.

NCAA FOOTBALL 

Schiano says he vvill re111ain with Rutgers 
Associated Press 
PISCATAWAY, N.J. -After weeks of speculation about his future, Rutgers coach Greg Schiano decided to spend at least the foreseeable part of it right where he is. 
In response to rumors he was poised to take over the troubled University of Miami program, Schiano said Monday he had told Hurricanes athletic director Paul Dee to take his name off a list of candidates. 
"Rutgers is where I am going to be and Rutgers is where I want to be. I am not a candidate for that job and I won't be a candidate for that job," Schiano said Monday. 
Schiano, a New Jersey native who was Miami's defensive coordinator in 1999 and 2000, said he told Dee on Monday not to consider him for the job. 
Miami coach Larry Coker was fired after going 6-6 in the regular season. 
Schiano has orchestrated No. 16 Rutgers' rise from one of the nation's lowliest pro­grams in the past six seasons, and led the team to its first bowl appearance in 27 years in 2005. 
At 10-2 (5.-2 Big East) this season after winning their first nine games, the Scarlet Knights are headed to a Texas Bowl matchup against Kansas State. Rutgers nar­rowly missed the Bowl Championship Series and a likely Orange Bowl appear­ance by losing Saturday night in triple overtime at West Virginia. 
As Rutgers continued to win this season and Coker's posi­tion became more tenuous, speculation grew that Schiano was one of the top candidates, perhaps even No. 1, for the Hurricanes job. 
Schiano never wavered from the message that he was happy at Rutgers and looking forward to the program's continued growth -yet he never explicitly said he would 

AFTERBURNERS 
stay at the school. 
That only fueled more rumors, which persisted through the West Virginia game and into Monday. 
"People kept asking if it was a distraction for the players during the season, but I knew once Saturday came that we needed to address it and that's exactly what happened," Schiano said. 
Schiano said Monday he had not signed a new con­tract with Rutgers, but said his agent is in discussions with Rutgers officials. He made $191,000 last year before athletic director Robert Mulcahy gave him a seven-year extension that 
maxes  out at $350,000 by  
2012.  
The  extension  raised  

Schiano's annual income from private sources from $325,000 to $625,000. With incentives, his total compen­sation is in the $1 million range. Coker, meanwhile, had three seasons left on a con­tract that paid him about $2 million annually. 
"He's maintained all along that this is where he wanted to be and this is where he's going to be. He's a man of principle and there's really no more to say about it," Mulcahy said. 
Schiano had previously hinted that money issues were secondary to Rutgers' committing to make the upgrades necessary to field a top-1 0 caliber team. 
At the top of his current wish list is an expansion of 41,500-seat Rutgers Stadium. Several home games were sellouts this season, including the final two games in which temporary bleachers added 2,000 seats to the south end zone. Season-ticket sales have already increased by 5,000 for next season, Schiano said Monday. 
He added that school offi­cials "are all on the same page with what we want to build here."

Irish skaters perform despite technical glitch 
Special to The Observer 
"Ladies, will you please stop skating," blared over the loud speakers in Ann Arbor, Mich. this weekend as the University of Notre Dame figure skating team attempted to finish their program at the Dr. Richard Porter Skating Competition. 

The determined women were resilient. and were forced to fin­ish out a three minute synchro­nized program without music due to a technical glitch as they per­formed in front of a large crowd Sunday morning. 
After several setbacks this sea­son, the Notre Dame skating team had its heart set on a flaw­less performance this past Sunday to boost morale and put its name back among the best of the synchronized skating world. But with an entire minute skipped in the music, that flaw­less performance seemed beyond reach. 
However, the young women stood with smiles on their faces in front of a bewildered crowd, wondering what their fate would be in the minutes that stood ahead. Out of breath and tired after going through the entire program at full speed, the women wondered if they would again have to attempt the program right away. 
After a silent direction from their coach, Irish alumna and for­mer team member Tracey Mulherin, the team skated to one end of the ice to pick up where the technical difficulty had thrown them off. Without a word, the team connected back togeth­er, kept smiles on their faces, and finished off the haunted themed musical program. 
They stepped off the ice, satis­fied with their performance, but worried that the technical glitch would set the team back in the ordinals. Fourteen colleges were represented this weekend at the competition, and Notre Dame wanted to be ranked as one of the best. With encouraging words from Mulherin and fans, the team proceeded to wait among the other colleges for the results. 
When the ordinals were placed on the wall, Notre Dame came out on top. Five of the seven judges had placed them first, and the other two had put them at a close second place. 
Even with technical difficulties and setbacks, the Irish skating team was determined to prove themselves this season. After a few years of disappointing losses and just missed trips to Nationals, the Notre Dame synchronized skating team is back with a vengeance, and is beginning to prove themselves to their fierce competitors. 
Next semester the club will compete in three more competi­tions, including the Midwesterns. The club is determined to contin­ue its successful ways. 
Men's volleyball 
Notre Dame traveled to Michigan State's annual Hardwood Classic this weekend. Play opened early Saturday for the Irish as they faced a pool of three other teams from across the Midwest. 
In the first match of the day, the Irish were paired against Iowa. Without middle blocker Joe O'Connell, the team burst from the gates, taking the first game quickly, 25-12. As O'Connell came into the gym, it seemed the Hawkeyes did too, giving the Irish a challenge in their second game, 25-21 victory. 
Following their opening win, the Irish first faced Kentucky. Notre Dame proved to be too much for the Wildcats as they won the match in consecutive games, 25-20, 25-17, behind the aggressive serving of Trevor Carter. The final match of pool play proved to be the match of the day as the Irish squared off against Pittsburgh. 
Despite the outstanding block­ing by James Foresman, Notre Dame ended up on the losing end of the 23-25 first game nail biter. The Irish came out with a mis­sion in the second, winning 25-12 to force the match into a decisive third game. Unfortunately, the Irish were unable to continue with the momentum, losing another close game, 12-15. 
To keep their first-place goal alive, the Irish were forced into a must-win match versus Northwestern. 
The clipboard was handed to O'Connell. who was looking to become 2-0 as coach, as the Irish took the court. Freshmen Arthur Kinsey and Ned Nejndly lifted the team through a slow start and to a first game 25-23 victory. 
After the dose initial game, the Irish were intent on making the second a little more comfortable. Behind Ted Grossestreur and the jump serves of Tim Goldsmith, the Irish finished the match and the day with a 25-13 win. 
Notre Dame moved from a field of 32 to a single-elimination bracket of 16 in the second day. They were paired against confer­ence foe Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the initial round. Both teams seemed sluggish in the early morning match, but the Irish pre­vailed 27-25, 25-11 to advance to the quarterfinals. 
The Irish found themselves playing a strong Ohio Northern squad for the opportunity to move on. The matching proved to be a defensive battle, starting with the first game. 
The Irish fought hard, but a few breaks fell the way of Ohio Northern, leading to a 22-25 loss. Notre Dame rallied together in the second, led by star libero John Tibbie, to take the second 25-22. Finding themselves in another three-game match, the Irish refused to fall. The third game was controlled in its entire-. ty Notre Dame, who paved their

way to the semis through a 15-9 win. 
With a spot in the champi­onship for grabs, the Irish hit the court against the Nittany Lions of Penn State. Strong outside hitting by senior Drew Williams and jun­ior Dan Zibton carried the play of the Irish, but it wasn't cmough as the Nittany Lions won, 25-21, 25­

Women's ice hockey 
Notre Dame traveled to St. Louis for three non-league games last weekend. Saturday night the team faced oiT against the St. Louis Surge. Notre Dame started out slow falling behind 1-0 in the first period. Once they adjustnd to the !rigid tmnpnrature of the out­door rink, the Irish steppnd up their level of' play and tied the score on a two on one pass from junior Kant Bronnan to sopho­monJ Margarnt Knoc1dler. Senior Annie Tilton added another goal on a breakaway to give the Irish a 2-1 lead. Tlw Surge ti()(l the game on a power play with only minutes left in the third period, but KrioPdhw scored again on an assist from f'reshm an Emily Chappell with 45 seconds left !,riV­ing the Irish a 3-2 victory. 
Just aflnr bnating the Surge the Irish were bcu:k on the ice to take on the St. Louis Herricanes. Notre Damll's goalie Mindy Stack was strong in net but the llerricanes scored on a first peri­od power play making it 1-0. The Irish peppered the net with shots but could not put one in. With a minute to play Notre Dame pulled their goalie and the advantage created several scor­ing opportunities, but the linal score remainHd 1-0 Herricanes. 
Sunday morning the Irish had a chance to avenge the previous night's loss in a rematch with the Herricanes. The Herricanes had some scoring chances early in the game but were stopped by Stack. Notre Dame then capitalized on a golden opportunity when Tilton scored on a 5-on-3 power play. Knoedler added her fourth goal of the weekend on the same power play and senior Julia LaPointe capped off the first peri­od scoring to give the Irish a 3-0 lead after one. Stack made some great saves and held the I Ierricanes scoreless while Tilton scored her second goal of the game. The 4-0 victory added to Notre Dame's winning record.

"When you sit down and you start talking about stuff, you watch his eyes and he asks great questions," Brey said. "You 

can make adjustments. He'd be a heck of a coach, let me put it that way." 
He's not the quickest or most athletic player on the court, "He's a great guy 
for me to talk through," Brey said. "Because Kyle [McAlarney] and I are still developing that niche, but Colin and I really have had that." 
So given Falls' willingness to put aside his own stardom for the success of the team, it's really no surprise he wanted to move along with the game after his l,OOOth point Wednesday instead of stopping to listen to the cheers. 
The surprise is that nobody else saw it coming.

Irish 
continued from page 20 
Notre Dame was unable to submit a proposed schedule to the faculty board for athletics for months. And Notre Dame still hasn't posted an official schedule. 
Notre Dame eventually hired Gia Kvaratskhelia, but not until events were fast approaching. 
And in the midst of it all, the Irish stayed at the top of the fencing landscape. 
At the Penn State Open, the premier national preseason individual duals held the first week of November, Notre Dame captured second-place finishes in all three women's divisions, and five men finished in the top-1 0 of their events. 
Senior sabreist Valerie Providenza, who entered as the No. 2 seed, went 15-0 in three rounds of double-elimi­nation competition and topped standout Penn State senior Sophie Hiss along the way to the final. There, Providenza fell to Ohio State junior Siobhan Byrne 15-10. 
Providenza, a senior from Beaverton, Ore., captured the 2004 NCAA Sabre Championship with a win over Hiss in the final and won the Junior Olympics title in that discipline the same year. 
"Finishing second was nice, although ifI had been on top of my game I should have won," Providenza said. "I lost to my friend ... but it was still disap­pointing to know I could have won, but didn't." 
Competing with a strained muscle, Providenza said she was happy with her perform­ance. 
"I wouldn't have been happy unless I made it into the top two, and after I did that, I just fenced as well as I could at that time," she said. 'The day drags on and you get tired, so all you can do is try to focus and fence the bout at that minute." 
But Providenza wasn't the only Irish woman in the finals. Epeeist Kelley Hurley and foilist Adi Nott, both freshman, made it to their finals. Hurley entered as the No. 1 seed and went 14-0 in double elimina­tion bouts. Hurley beat Wayne State senior Justyna Konczalska, who captured fourth place in the 2006 NCAA Championships. Two-time NCAA Champion Anna Garina, Konczalska's teammate, defeated Hurley in the final bout, 15-13. 
Nott was the unlikely star of the Open for Notre Dame. Seeded 11th entering the tour­nament, the freshman went 12-1 in her double-elimination bouts to surge to the No. 4 seed for the final four rounds. Nott then reached the final, where she lost to 2005 NCAA champion Emily Cross, a junior from Harvard. 

On the men's side, Irish sen­ior epeeist Aaron Adjemian went from the 15th seed enter­ing the tournament to a third­place finish. Adjemian lost his semifinal bout 15-13 to Wayne State senior Marek Petraszek, who was the 2005 NCAA run­ner-up and turns 25 years old in January. Adjemian beat Penn State junior 15-13 in the consolation bout to finish in the top-3. 
Notre Dame sophomore foilist Mark Kubik entered as the No. 4 seed and fmished the tournament in that spot. Kubik was 12-2 in pool bouts and beat the No. 2 seed, Harvard sophomore Kai ltameri-Kinter, 15-10 in the quarterfinals. 
Irish senior sabreist Patrick Ghattas and junior foilist Jakub Jedrkowiak each took seventh in his discipline. Irish senior Matt Stearns finished eighth in the sabre. 
"We were all really tired that day but did our best," Providenza said. "The day drags on and you get tired, so all you can do is try to focus and fence the bout at that minute." 
While Notre Dame's Gold Medal sabreist, junior Marie! Zagunis, didn't participate in the Penn State Open, she made her mark a month earlier at the World Championships. 
Zagunis lost 15-11 to 16­year-old training partner Becca Ward in the sabre cham­pionship in Toronto in an all­American final that broke a slew of historical records. 
Before that event, only one other American had ever won a medal in the World Championships. 
But the meeting was nothing new for either Zagunis or Ward, who train together at the Oregon Fencing Alliance in Portland, Ore. 
Zagunis beat American Sada Jacobson 15-10 in the semifi­nals before taking on Ward in the championship bout. 
And all of that was without Bednarski, who guided the Irish to national titles in 2001 -his first year-and 2003. But with Bednarski back at practices -along with Kvaratskhelia -for Notre Dame, the Irish are looking forward to whatever lies ahead. 
"It was very strange not to have Janusz at practice, but our new coach Gia really stepped up and took over," Providenza said. "Practice defi­nitely felt different for me when Janusz wasn't there. We were all very happy to have him return. 
"We're just taking it one practice at a time, preparing for whichever tournament comes next."

the 1 00-fly), Andrew Deters (third in the 1000-freestyle) and Tyler Angelo (third in the 100 and ZOO-breaststroke) are three other swimmers who will try to make the cut in Beijing. 
"These guys have consis­tently been on a big stage their whole careers," Tallman said. "They know what it's like." 
Other new team members have made an immediate impact by posting the fastest times on the team in the respective events. 
Freshman Sam Pendergast has posted the top times in the 100 and ZOO-breast­stroke. 
"We love Sam. Sam is a big, strong, powerful racer," Welsh said. "He's also very savvy and he's been getting better and better." 
Fellow freshman John Lytle has posted top team times in the 50 and 100-freestyle. 
"John is a kid that's come in and worked his tail off," Tallman said. "He's setting himself up to be where we want him to be later in the season. 
Lytle joined the Irish on the heels of a YMCA national championship last spring in the 1 00-freestyle. 
"He's done a great job for us all fall. and has been a great addition for us." Welsh said. "We're dependent upon him already." 
Sophomore Jeff Wood, a transfer student from Indiana, has stood out in the backstroke, posting the top times in the 50, 100, and ZOO-meter events. Wood post­ed these top times in the dual meet against Texas A&M, leading to event wins in the 100 and ZOO. 
"One thing Jeff has con­tributed, along with his back­strokes, is that competitive drive to win," Welsh said. 
Not only does the future look bright for these swim­mers in their individual events, but their performanc­es in the relays also are an important part of the team's overall success. Both Wood and Lytle have five relay wins this season and finished fifth along with Pendergast and senior Tim Kegelman at the Ohio State Invitational in the 400-medley relay. 
"Out of ZO relay spots avail­able, more than half are taken up by freshman," Tallman said. "This proves the depth of the class and shows how they have con­tributed to the team."

Even though the Bnlles eame out strong offensively in the second half. thny still only shot 
34.4 pereent. The difference, however, was in their defensn. Saint Mary's was able to stifle the Lady Hod shootnrs, forc~i ng them to shoot only 34.6 pereent in the seeond hall'. 
"We stepped up thn D, eaused more turnovers and ran the floor well" guard Allison Kessler said. 
Kessler, who scored 1R points and was 11-of-13 from the charity stripe, noticed a trans­formation between the Belles of the first half and the Belles in the second half. 
Freshman center Anna Kammrath was a huge pres­ence in the paint, grabbing 17 boards and scoring 10 points ­her second double-double of the season. Kammrath has dominated in the post all year and, according to Coach Henley, has been a "pleasant surprise" contributing as a freshman. 
With eight minutes remaining in the game, Belles guard Bridget Lipke sank a pair of free throws to give Saint Mary's its first lead of the night at 51­


50. Lipke played 38 minutes in the contest and notched 13 points and six assists in the loss. 
"We had to dig, dig, dig to get out of the hole we dug" Henley said. "[A) mental game is where we're at right now. We've been playing some tough games on the road." 
But Carthage responded with a 10-1 run to retake command of the game. Lipke kept the team close after the Lady Red run, but missed on a game tying attempt at the buzzer.

Irish win despite ill coach 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
In the depths of the Joyce Center, national champions wait for the opportunity to prove themselves again. 
Notre Dame went months without a definitive set of events, but this year scheduling is the last of its concerns. Earlier this semester, Irish coach Janusz Bednarski had an emer" gency appendectomy that limit" ed his work at a time when Notre Dame was in transition. His old assistant coach, Zoltan Dudas, took the head job at Princeton after four seasons at Bednarski's side.

Kessler scores ·18 in 
Belles loss at Carthage 
By DAN COOPER Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's (1 "6) traveled to play Carthage (3"2) last night and returned home early this morning after suffering a 63"61 defeat at the hands of the Lady Reds. 
With the loss, the Belles have now lost six games by a total of only 12 points. 
Saint Mary's came out slug" gish after a long bus ride to Kenosha, Wis., allowing Carthage to jump to an early 18"2 lead. The Lady Reds would lead by as much as 21 in the first half and sent the Belles into the locker room with a 38" 25 deficit at intermission. 
For the Lady Reds in the first half, everything seemed to go right. The te'!-m spot 46.4 per" cent from the floor, but were able to hold the Belles to only 
25.9 percent shooting. Leading the Carthage offense was for" ward Katie Jarger, whose 18 points was most for her team. 
A different Saint Mary's team took the court to start the sec" ond half. For the first twenty minutes of the second half the Belles outplayed the Lady Reds to the tone of a 26"12 run.
