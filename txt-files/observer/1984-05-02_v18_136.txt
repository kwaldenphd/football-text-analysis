Mondale blasts Reagans lack of respect for law in ND talk 
ByJOHN NEBLO 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Democratic Presidential Can­didate Walter Mondale blasted President Reagan for his "failure to uphold the law" in a Law Day address to the students and faculty of Notre Dame Law School yester­day in Washington Hall. 
Mondale declared he would make Reagan's lack of respect for the law "a fundamental issue of the cam­paign." 
Mondale charged that the Reagan Administration seemed to "stagger from injustice to injustice" with regard to civil rights, women's rights, and environmental protec­tion. Among his criticisms, Mondale claimed that Reagan had "trashed" the Civil Rights Commission, sup­ported racial discrimination in education, "assaulted" the legal services program, and failed to en­force EPA laws. "This Administra­tion thinks executing laws means shooting them," Mondale said. 
Mondale next attacked the "long line of officials in the Reagan Ad­ministration mired in controversy." He contends that Reagan has not set high standards of behavior for him­selfor his adminstrators, citing as ex­amples former Secretary of the Interior James Watt, formtrr EPA Director Ann Gorsuch, and Attorney General nominee Edwin Meese. 
In an obvious reference to the controversy surrounding Meese, Mondale said, "my Attorney General will be held to the highest stan­dards." Concerning Watt, he quipped, "he'd rather take a polluter to lunch than to court." 
Criticizing Reagan for violations of international law, Mondale said, "it now appears the OA planned and payed for the mining of Nicaraguan harbors," as well as other acts ofwar. 
Mondale stressed the need for all nations to obey international law. He indicated 1:\:agan's refusal to recognize any decision by the World Court concerning Central America might jeopardize American "moral authority" which, accordng to Mondale, is a vital component ofU.S. world leadership. 
Mondale never once mentioned Democratic rivals Sen. Gary Hart and Rev. JesseJackson during his 25­minute address, preferring to limit himselfto criticism of Reagan. 
Mondale did, however, patronize his Notre Dame audience by reveal­ing the "true" motive behind his visit. Said Mondale, "In 1976, I came here to speak as a vice presidential candidate and won. In 1980 I forgot to come and lost. Now it's 1984,I'm here at Notre Dame, and you know what comes next ..." 
Mondale's address was witnessed by a packed house of students and faculty as well as a small army of journalists and photographers in Washington Hall. After the address, Law School Dean David T. Link, a for­mer legal partner of Mondale, presented him with a plaque as a token ofappreciaton.

day, the ftrst election victory of his 
Democratic presidential candidacy. 
in his bid to stop Gary Hart's self­proclaimed comeback before it could begin. 
Jackson took 63 percent of the "morning" vote in the heavily black capital city. Mondale was running second and Hart third. 
In Tennessee, returns showed Mondale running well ahead of his rivals, and CBS news said it was projecting a Mondale victory. 
The two primaries, with 80 na­tional convention delegates combined, marked the end of a three-week campaign lull. They formed the leading edge ofa wave of contests to select 717 delegates over the next week and to test Hart's vow ofa comeback.

A group of approximately 20 people from the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community will spend two weeks discovering art, nature and science at the Redbud workshop summer program, in Buchanan, Mich., early this summer.

today, according to Bryan Dedrick, alcohol concerns commisionner for student government. 
"It's important that we get this done quickly," said Dedrick. Student government representatives will take the letters to the Campus Life Council meeting today at 4 p.m. in Flanner Hall's party room. 
The letter, written by Dedrick, was distributed to members at last night's Hall President's Meeting. "We're going to try to get the directives changed, and we need a show of student support," said Dedrick. 
The letter states "several obvious revisions must be made concerning the restrictions and limitations of the alcohol policy and directives. These revisions must be adopted to concur with the mutual goal of a realistic and healthy social environ­ment." 
The letter concludes "it is 'im­perative that student input be understood on issues affecting all of our lives." 

"This letter is very, very impor­tant," said Student Body Vice Presi­dent Cathy David. David also said the Campus Life Council meeting is. open to the entire student body. 
Faculty Course Evaluation forms were also discussed at the HPC meeting. "They sound like a great idea to me, but I understand that the student response so far has been weak," said Keenan Vice President Mike Prados.

Redbud campers study art, nature 
Co-ordinator of the workshop, Bill Sandusky, was quick to point out that the program is open to everyone. "There are no prerequisites," he stated. "And there is a limit of 10 people to a class so we are able to give a lot of individual attention." 
He emphasized that the program is open to every major. "It is surprising how creative some ofthe non-art majors are," he said. 
Redbud will take place from March 21-June 2. Courses offered this summer are drawing and painting, printmaking, pottery and sculpture, and field biology. Numerous guest lectures and ftlms will accompany the courses. 
The total cost, including room, board, and transporta­tion is $444. "I would encourage anyone to take ad­vantage of it," Sandusky said. "It is an unusual opportunity ideally timed at low cost."

Led by a surge in defense spending, orders to 
li.S. factories rose 2.2 percent in March, the largest increase in six months, the government said yesterday. However, analysts said the 
new report -far from showing a booming economy -actually pointed to more sluggish growth. With the volatile defense category removed, orders were up a meager 0.02 percent, providing further evidence of slower business activity in March. The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed to S195.6 hill ion in March, posting the best monthly gain since a 2.3 percent jump last September. But in the closely watched category of non­defense capital goods, orders actually dropped 1.6 percent. This category reflects industry plans to add equipment to boost produc­tion and is thus considered a good indicator of future business growth. -AP 
The share of Americans who own their own 
homes has declined for the first time in at least 20 years, the Census Bureau said yesterday. Housing costs and other economic factors were blamed by housing experts questioned about the figures. The drop in ownership between 1980 and 1983 was disclosed in a spe­cial study on homeownership trends, which also indicated that the 
ownership decline may have eased by the end oflast year. The share of ll.S. households that owned their home dropped from 65.6 per­n·nt in 19'80 to 64.6 percent last year, after gradually declining in 1981 and 1982, according to the report. -AP

National media could tarnish Dome if it reveals skeletons 
There is no better view of the University of Notre Dame than the one afforded Mary, Our Mother. Perched atop one of the seven wonders of the college world, Mary must be starting to feel uncomfortable about what· is happening to her school's reputation. 
Down below her, Notre Dame students are rushing into the Administration Building, holding up bottles of beer, chanting anti-administration and beer slogans, hanging banners all around campus, and participating in huge protest rallies that decry the University's unfair, ness and backward policies. 
Strange. Student protests and rallies are not part of the Notre Dame that is known around the country. After all, isn't Father Hesburgh's Notre Dame a model for all other universities to imitate? Notre Dame, people are told, is different. It brings in quality students, educates them in a Catholic atmosphere, and, after four years, releases them into the world to lend a strong, moral character to society.

Although protests ofanal­cohol policy will not erase completely the "Notre Dame mystique," the protests and the extensive coverage ofthem is just a sign that the mystique quickly is finding itselfon shaky ground. 
There have been little hints over the past year that the Golden Dome was beginning to become a little tar­nished. The accusations about University investments in South Africa and in companies producing nuclear weapons were the beginning. Recently, there have been a number ofsuits brought against Notre Dame by fired workers. It is obvious that people are beginning to question exactly how moral Notre Dame really is. 
Now many of the students seemed to have stopped worrying about their school's reputation. Inviting the national media to write unflattering things about their school and future alma mater is another sign that the University's leadership and purpose is being ques­tioned.ln fact, it is the stongest sign yet.

tions have not gotten more serious than the ones already asked, and the damage to the Golden Dome has not been too great -yet. 
However, the lhiversity is walking on thin ice right now. When you claim to be so righteous, like Father Hesburgh and his assistants have done over the years, you pick up many enemies who would love to drag you down. Notre Dame has picked up many enemies who doubt that the school is as near-perfect as they are told and who are just waiting for someone to come forth 
louder than the rest are 
coming from the athletic department -that part of the University that was !'raised so loudly inSports Illustrated. There have been hints from inside the department that somebody is beginning to feel an urge ro "tell all." If a person does come forth with a reliable evidence of wrongdoings, Notre Dame could find itself facing an attack far worse than any it has faced to date. 
Whether or not that person or persons comes forth from the ACC or the Ad Building, the University would be well-advised to make sure that it has nothing to hide. It has been able to weather the small attacks of its stu­dents and a few of its employees, but if the media gets some solid evidence of wrongdoings, Mary's Dome might not be too golden anymore.

Two ND students win scholarships 
and college activities and a strong emphasis on academics. Ruehlmann noted, however, "I thought that I on­ly had a decent chance to make it to the fmals because the other students were very impressive." 
Presently . a Government and ALPA major, McCaffery was active in President Reagan's California cam­paign in the 1980 election. He also took part in the Mock Convention last month and has had positions in student government and the Fresh­man and Sophomore Advisory coun­cils. McCaffery plans to use his scholarship at a public policy graduate school where he hopes to study tax policy and to do intern work for the government. 
As general manager of the Senior Bar and former Junior class presi­dent, Ruehlmann has gained the ex­perience needed to succeed in the business world. Ruehlmann plans to study at Vanderbilt Law School after receiving his B.A. in accountancy at this year's graduation ceremony. Upon graduating from Vanderbilt, Ruehlmann aspires to be a business lawyer. 
Vanderbilt Law School is widely recognized as one of the top law schools in the nation. The scholar­ship is awarded on a merit basis. Ap­plicants must be accepted as students in the Vanderbilt Law School. The scholars so selected must be, in all respects, superior stu­dents, and show outstanding leader­ship potential. 
Applicants for the Truman Scholarship must also show out­standing potential for leadership in the area of public service. Can­didates for this scholarship make their initial application to the in­stitution they presently attend and are selected by the institution to represent their school before the final review board. 
McCaffery advised those who seek scholarships in public service related fields to "get some positive experience in government and demonstrate strong leadership qualities."

Two Notre Dame students recent­
ly have received prestigious scholar­
ships in the fields of public service 
and law. 

Thomas McCaffery, a sophomore 
from Modesto, Calif., is the recipient 
of the Harry S. Truman Memorial 
Scholarship. Mark Ruehlmann, a 
senior from Cincinnati, Ohio, was 
awarded the Patrick Wilson 
Memorial Scholarship, by Vanderbilt 
Law School in Nashville, Tenn. 
McCaffery was pleasantly .surprised when notified of his award. He said,"l thought that I just did all right." 
The Truman scholarship, es­tablished by an act of Congress in 1976 to honor our 33rd President, is regarded by educators to be one of the highest awards that a college stu­dent can receive. Father Robert Austgen, Assistant Dean in the Col­lege of Arts and Letters, said the scholarship "is a continuing educa­tional scholarship program designed to provide opportunities for out­standing students to prepare for careers in public service." 
Ruehlmann attributes his success to his involvement in high school

ND ROTC protects the weak and unarmed 
The following is the second part ofa two­part series on the role of the Resen1e Officer Training Corps program at Notre Dame. 
There has been talk lately about Notre Dame becoming a leading "Peace University." I'm not <.·xactly sure what that is, but the very kast th<.· University would have to do in order to be taken seriously as a peacemaking institu­tion is to reform the ROTC programs in ac­cordan<.-e with Catholic just war ethics -a 
Michael Baxter 

Guest column 
complicated task. I have suggested that in the 
first place, it would entail training officers to 
take up as their special care and concern the 
defense of the innocent. 

In this same spirit, Gen. Douglas MacArthur once wrote that "the soldier, be he friend or foe, is charged with the protection ofthe weak and unarmed. It is the very essence of his heing." 
Similiarly, the American Catholic bishops urge military personnel to examine policies and practices in which they are involved in light of the principle of non-combatant im­munity. Defense of the innocent is central to the responsihilit.y ofany officer, hut it is espe­cially central to Catholic officers, since they are gui<kd not only by a military code of et­hics hut hy the moral vision of another separate community, the Church. 
There is a crucial difference between a cod<. of military ethics derived from the military itself and a proper Catholic under­standing of the responsibilities of soldiering. Th<.· Catholic soldier's moral duty to defend the innocent can never h<: checked by his obligation to obey orders, asGaudium et spes states so emphatically. Such a readiness to dis­obey orders could not he cultivated in the military. Every military requires a chain of command that barely tolerates even question­ing orders, not to mention disobeying them. 
This makes problems for Catholics in the military, who arc <.·ailed to question their ac­tions habitually, and to disobey immoral or­dns without compromiSl·. Conformity is an l'Ss<.·ntial ingredient to a healthy military en­vironment. 
Yet. it is incumh<.·nt upon Catholic officers to live by values that may run at cross­purposes to that environment. Is it reasonable to exp<.Tt that our Catholic officers maintain this kind of moral autonomy? I think it is. The exampk of Franz_lagerstattcr illustrates why. 
Jagerstattt·r was a Catholic Austrian peasant who trained in the Nazi army during World War II. When it came time l(>r him to enter al'tiVl' servin:, he rdused on the grounds that ht· would h<.· fighting in an unjust war. The m<.·n in his village consid<.·red him a coward. 
Jag<.·rstatter continued in his refusal and was hdll'aded hy the Nazis on August 9, 194.3. The disturbing part of th<.· story is that Jagerstat­tn's parish priest would not hear ofhis refusal and a<.'Cused him of being too self-righteous. Nor wouldJagerstattn's bishop lend him sup­port and said it wasn't propn for a person to question the state. So Jagerstatter was put in a position in which he almost had to apologize fi>r his rdusal. 
This is tht· heart of the matter about Cat· holies in tht· military and about the moral kgitmacy of KOTC at Notre [},une. It is an issut· ofallegiance to (iod and the Church, and how that might «.:onflict with an officer's al­kgianc<.· to tht· state. In this American context, th.:r highn allq~iann: would not in all likelihood lead Catholics to martyrdom like Jagerstatter's. But the allegiance is essential to our religious identities. 
"Catholic" means universal, and any moral vision claiming to he such cannot be narrowed by loyalty to the state or to any other institution of purely human design ­not when that entails the grave matter of taking innocent lives. 
This isn't merely a theoretical question about church-state relations. There is often a sharp contrast between what the military demands of its officers in the heat of combat and what the Church demands of them in spite of the heat ofcombat. And that contrast can harden into deep, personal conflict for 
U.S. military officers as easily as it can for of­ficers ofother states. 
So the issue here is pastoral. It has to do with how Notre Dame officers spend their years in the military, to what ends they devote their talents, how they contribute morally to the military and how they can become the kind of people whose moral characters won't be corroded by "military necessity" or the needs of"national security." 
The key to the moral legitimacy ofll.)TC on Notre Dame's campus lies with the ability of the programs to form people whose moral sensibilities won't be dulled by nationalism, pragmatism or any other ethical shares as­sociated with a military environment. 
This task would have to involve curriculum reforms. The principles of just war ethics would have to be incorporated into the syl­labus of each class. Strategies and tactics that conflict with these principles would have to be discussed openly. 
A military science course on weapons, for example, would certainly include a thorough section on the principle ofnon-combatant im­munity and how it applies to specific weapons. Moreover, it would be imperative that the ROTC commanders be firmly com­mitted to this Catholic perspective on military officership. They would have to be convinced of the duty of waging war justly and of the need to convey that commitment to their ll:>TC students. 
There is no clearer, more challenging op­portunity for the University to exhibit its dis­tinctively Catholic character than to reform the ROTC programs in order that they deal practically and pastorally (not just theoreti­cally) with traditional just war teaching. 
I realize that this outlook might seem to be a rather negative explanation of the role of ROTC at Notre Dame. But there has always been a presumption in the Christian tradition against resorting to violence, a presumption that all Christians, not just the so-called "pacifisits," are obliged to share. 
· The burden of proof has always rested with those who favor the use of force. Hence, the ROTC programs pose a special challenge to the Notre Dame community, in that they are designed for purposes that must continually be scrutinized by the Christian community. 
Some might argue that the IUTC programs would he unable, or inevitably unwilling, to accommodate the demands deriving from C.atholic moral teaching on waging just war. If that's the case, then the problem is not with the ethics of the Christian community, but with the capacity of the U.S. military to be a morally accountable institution. If the programs are unable or unwilling to ac­complish the task set before it by the Christian community, then ROTC's presence on campus is indeed morally questionable.

Showcase 
Movies 
Expect only horror front a horror ntovie 
by Paul Cimino 
features staffwriter 
I 
never used to go to horror movies and ifit were not for my girlfriend, I would never have known how much fun I was missing. So, when she suggested we see "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" I im­mediately agreed. Now, I don't have a very solid background concerning the "Friday the 13th" series (I have not seen any ofthe three previous theatrical extravaganzas) so I felt this would be the perfect movie for me to both enjoy and critique at the same time. I was absolutely correct. 
Everyone loves a good horror 
movie now and then. And ifyou go 
to see just one scary film this year, 
"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" 
is the movie you should choose. 
For those ofyou who are un­familiar with the "Friday the 13th" series, here is a quick overall synopsis: a possessed and deformed killer namedJason terrorizes children and adults alike at a hideaway named Camp Crystal Lake. Many people attempt, and fail, to kill him. However, at the end ofpart III, 
Jason is finally beaten and presumed dead. 
This so-called "Final Chapter" 
begins exactly where the third part 
left off. The first five minutes ofthe 
movie are filled with flashbacks and 
cuts from the earlierfilms which not 
only build your interest but serve as a lead-in to the film's storyline. As stated earlier,Jason is thought to be dead and is taken to a morgue to be autopsied. Suffice it to say that he is not dead at all -any more about the plot would ruin the suspense. 
Ofthe acting, alllhat needs be said is that it is not fantastic. But really, what horror movies do you know that deserve Academy Awards for acting quality? This movie fits per­fectly into the usual style ofhorror movies in that its plot involves a lot offun-loving teenagers, no-name ac­tors and actresses, and an expansive amount ofmood-setting music. 
Bruce Mahler (formerly ofABC's "Fridays") has top billing but don't be fooled. His part, although funny, is in no way essential to the story and, as such, is very small. Peter Bar­ton ("Powers ofMatthew Star," an­other long-run network series), a second notable, can be seen from time to time. However, he too has a small part. No other members ofthe cast are worth remembering. There is one other character ofsome im­portance -a dog who tries to protect his masters. 
The movie is rated R and for good reason. Afew years ago it probably would have been rated X. There is an overabundance ofunclean language, nudity, and, ofcourse, blood. Don't be discouraged by this rating, 




WEDNESDAY SPECIAL 3 · 8 Mixed Drinks 2 for 1 8 · 3 Bud Long necks 75¢ 
though. In fact, an R rating was to be expected because the movie has an effect which could not be ac­complished in any less vicious a fas­hion. 
Jason is a very inventive and ingenious person. Because ofthis "The Final Chapter" goes to new lengths in the quest for ways for people to die. I personally don't plan to die in any ofthe situations portrayed. The deaths and the film suffer at times from lack ofrealism but when the choice is between realism and effect, most horror movie-goers will accept the latter. Irony also plays an important part in the film. This movie is a must for any horror lovers or fans ofthe "Friday the 13th" series, well worth the price ofadmission. The last 30 minutes in particular contain the most exciting and suspenseful scenes I have seen in a long, long time. You may want to bringa friend or two along (preferably ofthe op­posite gender) because the movie is better enjoyed by groups. Oh, and make sure to go to the late showon a Friday orSaturday night because the film is greatly enhanced by the audience's screams!! 
One final word on "Friday the 13th The Final Chapter." As the title suggests, it is the final installation in the story. But don't see this as a let­down. The ending contains a twist which will undoubtedly leave you asking that famous question: "Is the party really over?"

Letters front an Italian grandntother 
by Paul Aiello 
features columnist 
T
his pastweek I received anotherletterfrom my Italian grandmot­her. As always, the top left-hand corner ofthe envelope con­tained the familiar return address: "Nana, 1717 East 2nd Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.," while the letter was affectionately addressed to her "Paul Francis." On the backside ofthe envelope, layers upon layers ofscotch tape were strategically placed, giving the appearance that extremesecuritymeasureswere taken. Knowing Nana, I understand why she does this. For she knows mailmen are always trying to st~~' the "little thoughts" she sends to her grandchildren. 
After a ten minute struggle to open the envelope, I fmally came upon its contents. As always, the note started offwith the same opening: "Dear Paul Francis, .. .Just a few lines to say hello and hope you are doing fine." Every time I read this I have to laugh be­cause Nana, like othergrandmothers, writes the way she talks. Easily, I can hear her talking to me in the same manner she does back at home. "Paul Francis, why don't you get yourselfa Iitle more to eat!"' 
Nevertheless, the best part ofNana's note came from its sup­portive nature -the kind that only a grandmother can provide. For example, on hearing that I had three tests and two papers in one week, Nana simply wrote: "Luckily, I know that you are a great guy and can take it." Following this, she then reeled offone ofher favorite mottos, "Above all, have a good time!" 
After I made it through Nana's closing which wished me to "be happy and healthy" in about twenty different combinations of words, I fmally reached another ofmy favorite parts ofher letters. Somehow, I would have to try to salvage the check or bill that she would always tape to the rest ofthe letter. With years ofexperience and great dexterity (this point has often been challenged), I began surgery to separate the money. Minutes later, mission was ac­complished. Nothing was lost and the "loot" was mine. Neverthe­less, the value ofit now seems quite trivial compared to thepriceless value ofthe letter itself. · 


Debaters beconting chantps at getting the point across 
by Frank Lipo 
features staffwriter 
T
he Notre Dame Speech and Debate Council recently com­pleted its season. Although it isn't as large as other clubs and organiza­tions that receive much publicity, it provides an excellent forum for in­terested students to display their oral skills. 
BrotherJohn Doran, director of forensics, has coached the speech and debate council for the past six years. He said, "The interest is there ifyou can tap it. Usually about 20 students stay with it to a certain de­gree ofinvolvement." He said one main problem right now is that Notre Dame doesn't have a speech department. Many ofthe com­petitive schools use their speech classes as training for competition. Some communication and theatre classes can fill this void, but there are still some training problems. 
Despite these limitations, said Doran, juniorsJohn Monberg and Paul Komyatte bad a fine season. They finished fifth in the region in debate. Alan Targprt, also a junior, became tbe first student from Notre Dame to participate in the nationals for indt.idual events. He went on to place 13th in die nation.

The season begins the first week in October and culminates in the nationals in April, in which Notre Dame competes against other schools in the Mid­west. 
For a debate team to reach the na­tionals, it must placefourth or better in the region. To reach the nationals in one ofthe individual events, a per­son must either finish in the top three at three different meets throughout the year orbe one ofthe top three in the region. Notre Dame was in a region containing schools

from Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. This year's national cham­pion, Bradley University, was also in the region. 
After T arggart placed second in the region, he travelled to Kansas State University April 13-16, with representatives from 102 other schools. There were 93 other stu­dents in his impromptu speaking category, providing a high level of competition. Targgart said, "For some ofthese kids, this is their life. Many are on speech scholarships. Some schools take speech as serious­ly as their sports. This is their only chance for national prestige." 
The participants were judged on their response to a series of topics. Each competitor was given an index card with a quote on it. They had seven minutes to prepare and give a speech. Targgart responded to such topics as "Great men are not isolated mountain peaks, they are merely the summits ofranges" and "Ifwe are to love our country, our country must be lovely." He was edged out ofthe fmal round by one rating point. 
Targgart said, "I had a really good time. I was worried that I wouldn't be extremely competitive because I didn't have the experience ofsome ofthe others. I didn't embarrasss myself, though. I look forward to doing better next year." 
Doran is leaving Notre Dame at the end ofthis semester. He is "95 percent certain" the new director of forensics will be Bill Wians, who is now teaching in the London program. Wians was an associate debate coach at Notre Dame while he worked on his doctorate in philosophy. He was also a college debater at Toledo University. Doran said W ians is a good debate man who would give support to individual events. He has broad interests in all aspects ofcollege debate. Doran said, "The program will be in good hands." . .-:.·.·.·:.·.·:.'.

Notre Dame women's tennis team soundly defeats Saint Mary's, 9-0 
Susie Panther of Notre Dame defeated Debbie Lauerie, herSaint Mary's opponent atfirst singlesyes­terdtlJ·, 7-6, 6-2. The Irish destroyed the Belles, 9-0, in this match to gain confidence as they bead to Cbatanooga, Tenn., for the NOtA Division II Cham­pionships. 
By ~~-\RY SIEGER 
\jJOrt~ Vrlter 

Net even the high winds could da·npt. n the enthusiasm on the co-rts at the Courtney Tennis Cen­ter yesterday as the Notre Dame w· men's tennis team closed out Its ~ :a!~m witt-a 9-0 victory over Saint M01r:·'o; College. 
No  the Insh will take their 23-4 se.tso record to compete for the na­ti.ma title in the NCAA Division II National Championship Tourna­ment early next week in 
.,atan<-'oga, Tenn. 

"I won't he excited until we get t.lt.re," s. id Irish head coach Sharon I ·trc " .Vith two more days of 
tctiu and some players taking ri· Is early, we've got a lot to do be­tw·:c:n now and then." 
\. '1ile the wind in yesterday's ·ompetition made play more dif­' icult it hc:lped the Irish improve heir com:entration, which will 
I ·nefit the team at Nationals. 
Susie Panther at number one 
nglt·s won an extremely com­1 ·:tative match for the Irish, 7-6, 6-2 a::ain >t Debbie l..auerie. A disagree­n.tnt in scoring caused the players 
t > cturn to the first point in the gar1c which, intensified the match. 
In first round 
"Susie played well once she got her head screwed on straight," said Petro. "Sometimes when you get mad, you play better." 
"My match was difficult because of the wind," explained Panther. "But Saint Mary's is a rival and it's al­ways nice to beat them." 
Because last weekend's matches against the University of Ohio and the University of Toledo were can­celled because of rain, yesterday's match helped the Irish prepare for Nationals in a competative, outdoor setting. Before the team leaves for Chattanooga, the Irish plan to inten­sify their training. 
Notre Dame is one ofeight teams participating in the Nationals and is amoung a corps ofthree midwestern teams travelling to Chattanooga. 
"We were invited because we did so well in California," said Irish co­captain Greta Roemer. "Since there is only one California school in the Tournament, it shows a shift of in­fluence from California to the Mid­west." 
On Monday, the Tournament opens with the Irish facing a tough squad from the University of Den­ver. If the Irish get past Denver they will advance to the second round where they will meet the University of Tennessee (Chattanooga) which is the defending national champion. If the Irish defeat Chattanooga, they will advance to the final round and a possible National Championship. 

"We can beat the University of Denver if we play well," said Petro. "But playing Chattanooga, who is the defending national champ on their own court will be difficult, so we must play our best tennis with­out a doubt." 
"We're extremely psyched to go and I think we defmitely have the ability to win," said Panther. "If we work hard and play smart we can do it." 
The Irish will enter the tourna­ment at a disadvantage. Like the rest of the undergraduate community, the Irish will be studying for their final exams in addition to fighting for the national title. So far, professors have been cooperative and per­mitted several team members to take their finals early or while they are in Chattanooga. 
In addition to Notre Dame's in­vitation the National Tournament as a team, four members of the Notre Dame lineup will compete in­dividually for the Irish. Panther and Irish co-captain Lisa LaFratta at num­ber one and number two singles,

Greg Bell drafted by Buffalo 
A..'lliOCiated Press 

'J ·te Buffalo Bills gave Greg Bell of No.rc Dame, a tailback hampered by injuries the last two seasons, the dis­tinction of being the only running back selected in the first round of yesterday's National Football League draft. 
As a sophomore Bell averaged 5.6 yards per l:arry for the Irish, gaining 512 yards on 92 c,arries, including 165 in one game against Michigan State. Bell, from Columbus, Ohio, also averaged 28.5 yards per carry on kickoff returns -the best mark by a member of the Irish in I 3 years. But, from then on the 6-foot, 210­pound tailback had his playing time limited by injuries. 
Bills Coach Kay Stephenson ack­nowledged Bell's injury-prone past, but said the Bills had Bell rated as "the top running back" in the draft. 
"He'sgot good size, he's got excel­
lent speed, he has good strength, he has maneuverability, (and) he catches the ball well," said Stephen­son. "So he has the potential to be the all-around type back that you look for." 
A broken leg limited Bell to only 22 minutes of playing time the past two seasons, giving him career marks of only 70l yards and six touchdowns -hardly the type of figures usually associated with a frrst round running back. 
Stephenson said he thought Bell's fractured leg suffered in 1982 can mend. 
"Our doctors felt we could bring him in right after the draft, put him in a cast, and there is a device that will complete the healing process in his bone," said Stephenson. "It's an electric current-type treatment, and in six-to-seven weeks he should have complete healing ofthe bone." 
Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust 

was noticably pleased by Bell's 
selection so early in the draft. 
"I'm really happy because of his 
(Bell's) frustrating career," Faust 
said. "It's a real tribute to his athletic 
ability. He is an excellent athlete; he 
can run and catch the ball well. It's a 
shame we didn't get a chance to use 
him more." 
In the sixth round, defensive back Chris Brown of Notre Dame was chosen by Pittsburgh, and teammate defensive back Stacey Toran was chosen by the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Neil Maune, a 6-5, 278-pound of­fensive guard from Notre Dame, was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the ninth round. Maune will be playing alongside Dallas lineman Phil Pozderac, another former Irish player.

An 'Items' salute: the first 'Chuckies' 
Chuck Freeby ~f~·, ~s_p_o_r_rs__w_r_it_e_r_________________~ ~~· ~~~\~ Irish Items /lf!!!Jlff:.:~ 
Hello again, everybody! 
After months and months of columns this year, it has all come down to this -the final "Irish Items" of the year (I can already see the wave of apathy rippling across the campus). After seeing hundreds of brilliant and a few not-so-brilliant performances during the year, it seems a fitting time to pass out some awards. Some of these can be taken seriously, others can be talten tongue-in-cheek ­it's up to you to decide. So, here they are: the frrst (and possibly, last) annual "Chuckies." 
Best Performance ... The Academy finds two nominees worthy of this award, as they have performed in the spotlight when it shone its brightest. 
l. Allen Pinkett -Everyone in the stadium knows he's going to carry the ball 2 5 times a game, but he still manages to gain over 120 yards an outing. His 217 yards rushing on the frozen turf of Beaver Stadium against Penn State was just an incredible display ofability. 
2. Tom Sluby -After three years of living in exile on the bench, the Gonzaga prep standout lived up to the raves that preceded his arrival at Notre Dame. He averaged nearly 20 points a game, and, more importantly, provided a leader and clutch player for the young Irish cagers. 
While both athletes are worthy ofthis column's equivalent to an MVP, the nod goes to Sluby based on the fact that he was more cru­cial to the basketball team than Pinkett was to the football squad. 
Best Actor ... The nominees are as follows: 
l. Tim Kempton in "Taking the Charge" -C'mon folks, let's be reasonable! Do you honestly expect me to believe that some lightweight guard driving down the lane can knock this big redhead down? It's like running a Volkswagen into a sequoia. 
2. Gerry Faust in "The Eternal Optimist" -No matter how the Irish looked, coach Faust always seemed to say something to the 
-effect of "We're this close to being a good team." Unfortunately, some weeks "this close" was a hair's breadth, while other weeks it was Yosemite National Park. 
3. The Irish Hockey Team in "Someone Forgot to Tell Us We Went Club" -Someone explain to me how a "club" team outdraws most varsity sports and kills most varsity opponents. Everybody from the top down seems to be happy this one-year fiasco is over. 
4.Digger Phelps in "Richard III" -First, he steals my line about "The beef is back." Now the next thing you know he'll have a Van Gogh on the coverofthe program and be using lines from the lllrd of Avon to talk about the 1984-85 season. 
And the winner is: Digger Phelps, who not only gets a "Chuckie", but a patchwork quilt to remind him of how many times he had to patch together the lineup last season. 
The Most Unheralded Freshman Performances of the Year ... Sure, everyone heard of Donald R:>yal and Hiawatha Fran­cisco during the year, but here are three freshmen who had great seasons that nobody knows about. 
I. Corinne DiGiacomo, field hockey -All this freshman did wao; tally 18 goals to lead jan Galen Bishop's stickwomen in scoring this season. Did anybody on campus hear about it? Maybe her roommate. 
2. 
joAnne Biafore, women's tennis -Another freshman who has compiled magnificent stats with a 15-2 record for Sharon Petro's netters this spring. The Irish could be on their way to a Division II national championship, but only the team will know about it. 

3. 
Charles Higgs-Coulthard, fencing -Before you scoffat the for­mal sounding name, remember that he won the NCAA champion­ship in the foil division. Don't mess with this guy if he is holding a sharp object. Any freshman who earns a national championship deserves a "Oluckie." 


The Most Tortuous Ordeals of1983-84 ... These three events tested the loyalty of even the biggest Irish fan: l. Notre Dame vs. Northwestern, men's basketball -Less than artistic wa~ the game. Less than pleased was Digger. Less than the price of admission is what the whole evening was worth. 
2. 
Midwestern City Conference Weekend, tennis and baseball -A rare ugly day for baseball at jake Kline Reid combined with a not-so­great day for tennis at the Courtney Tennis Center. With the wind howling in from the north at 30 mph, hard-hit fly balls were turned into harmless pop-ups and tennis lobs sailed to Kokomo. For fans, winning gave way to survival in importance. 

3. 
Liberty Bowl, football and ice skating -I wasn't there and neit· her were a lot ofother folks by the end ofthe game. Some games you want to keep frozen in time, but this one was frozen from the very beginning. There were a lot of people who thought the Irish shouldn't have gone to Memphis, and a lot offolks at the game who wished they hadn't (coaches and team excluded). 


Which one of these was the worst? Who knows. By now, you might be saying this column has all three events beat hands down. 
Thank-You Notes ... This wouldn't be a true award ceremony if there weren't a thank-you speech, so here goes. First ofall, thanks to my roommates for looking over several columns before they ever reached this page, so that I would not malte a fool of myself (obviously, sometimes it didn't help). Also, a big thank-you to the folks in the Sports Information Department for help in idea'> and information. Finally, thanks to all of you who read the column and passed on your complaints and compliments. I hope it wa'i entertain­ing and informative. 
Good luck on finals, have a great summer, and goodbye again, everybody!
