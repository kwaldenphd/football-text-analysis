Baranowski resigns 

HPC chairmanship 
by Jim Eder Staff Reporter 
Fred Baranowski stunned the Hall Presidents 

Council last night by announcing his resignation as 
HPC chairman and as president of Holy Cross Hall. 
Baranowski explained that his voluntary resignation is part of a self-imposed punishment for committing "a serious violation against the university." 
After having been confronted with the violation, Baranowski had met several times with both his hall rector and the dean of students before reaching his final decision. 
Baranowski elaborated on the reasons for his reesignation in the following statement to his fellow HPC members: 
"Being a student leader involves more than merely serving as policy-maker or decision-maker. It involves living with guidelines that have been implemented; it involves exemplifying principles that are consistent with University regulations; and it involves a responsibility to be honest with oneself. 
"Beecause I have violated a serious University regulation, I feel it is my responsibility to be honest with myself and the University. Perhaps I could continue to function physically as a student leader; however, I function on more than a physical basis, as I hope people around have recognized. Thus, I am resigning as Chariman of the Hall Presidents Council and as President of Holy Cross Hall, effective im­mediately. 
"I do not wish to compromise myself or the university by remaining as a student leader when I have personally failed to uphold the values protected by the university regulations. It would be hypocritical of me to support those values and regulations in our deliberations while exempting myself from those in practice." 
Most of the hall presidents received the an­nouncement in silent shock. A few expressed their feelings. 
Chuck Cardillo, president of Keenan said, "I am very sorry to see that circumstances have forced Fred to resign. He put a lot of time and effort not only into running his own hall, but also into the extensive duties that are required of the HPC chairman beyond those of the average hall president. It is not easy to represent the interests of your own hall and still conduct the business of the HPC in an objective manner, but Fred managed to treat everyone fairly and with interest." 
Phil Byrne, president of Alumni, praised Baranowski for his ability to "provide the HPC with the leadership it needed and keep its business running smoothly." He pointed out, however, "Although we suffer a loss by his resignation, we will have to ban together, elect a new chairman, and continue on with the business of the HPC." 
HPC Executive Coordinator Pat McLaughlin ex­pressed his support of Baranowski, "Although I know it must have been an extremely difficult decision for him to make, I believe it was a good decision. Fred was a veryable chairman; he had a fine sense of direction as to where the HPC should go; and his leadership will be greatly missed. He had provided a long-needed bridge between the HPC and Student Government." 
The HPC will not officially meet during the next two weeks. It will resume activity after the Thanksgiving recess. At that time it will take up proceedings to elect a new chairmann. 
In other business, the HPC formed a committee to investigate the possibility of establishing a "party house" for those halls that do not have facilities for holding large poarties. 
The committee is headed by Ed Chute, president of Sorin and includes the following other presidents: Rich C)'Connor of Pangborn, Wally Gasior of Dillion, Bill Hake of Morrissey, Steve DeCoursey of Cavanaugh, and Phil Byrne of Alumni. 
Chute said that at least ten halls have no facilities for large parties. The committee will meet with Vice President for Student Mfairs Philip Faccenda and Assistant dean of Students Fr. Terence Lally as soon as possible. 
Student Body Prsident Mike Geisinger addressed the HPC meeting requesting its help in urging students to make use of the new shuttle-bus service offered by Student Government.

Dr. Henry discusses problems 

by Paul Colgan Staff Reporter 
Dr. Edward Henry, President of St. Mary's discussed the problems of the college with about 35 seniors in Stapleton lounge last night. 
The topics of Dr. Henry's "personal contact" discussion ranged from a strong student concern with the quality of food in the dining hall to the academic and financial problems of a women's college. 
During the discussion Dr. Henry announced that next year the SMC and ND academic calendars will be the same. "You will both be coming to school a week earlier next year," Dr. Henry said. 
The discussion with the senior class was part of Dr. Henry's dialogue with the college. He holds a talk with each class once every year. The talks function as a means to improve relations bet­ween himself and the students, according to Dr. Henry. 
The SMC seniors began the discussion with a complaint about food. "We threw away several bowls of chili the other night because it tasted so bad," ex­claimed one student. 
Dr. Henry said he was unaware until now that any problems existed in the Saga food service. "There must be some im­provement from September when I received several petitions," Dr. Henry explained. "I thought it was OK until now." 
A few students felt they could go without the decorative parts of the meal such as salads and deserts in favor of increasing the amount of meat in the menu. 
Speaking as a former mess supervisor in the military, Dr. Henry said the extras were themost inexpensive parts of the menu. ":Saga is squeezed on their contract price by rising food costs." he explained. "They are trying to live within a contract price by reducing the amount of meat in the menu." 
Saga negotiated their current contract last year, and have been caught in a food price spiral that has raised costs nearly 18 per cent in the last six months according to Dr. Henry. 

Dr. Henry addresses Senior Class at St. Mary's 
Dr. Henry said he would look into the problem and asked the students to submit their com­plaints to Tom Novak at the dining hall. 
The problems of rising food costs led to a discussion of the rising financial burdens for the whole college. 
Because of the financial depression of colleges in America Dr. Henry felt that St. Mary's had to score on two points, enrollment and development, if it is to survive. 
Dr. Henry explained that 88 per cent of St. Mary's revenues come from tuition and fees. If enrollments go up they will provide a solid financial footing for the college. He admitted that SMC was currently on a tight budget because of enrollment drops after the merger attempt failed, but he expected to have a "full house" next year. "Our inquiries (for applications) are running 50 per cent over last year," he said. 
The problem with development is the fact that the student does not pay the full cost of her education. An additional $350,000 to $400,000 are needed from outside sources to support the college according to Dr. Henry. 
Raising the money is difficult because, first, St. Mary's is a women's college and second, it is a Catholic college. The prejudice against women and the lateness of of Catholic colleges in building endowments for their schools create these problems, Dr. Henry explained. "It has only been in the last decade that Catholic Colleges have raised money to build en­dowments." 
The need for development is highlighted by the fact that St. Mary's endowment is only $2% million, or one sixth of what it should be. Dr. Henry explained that for a college the size of St. Mary's it should have an en­dowment over $15 million. 
When questioned whether the enrollment problems of SMC had lowered the academic quality of entering freshmen, Dr. Henry countered, "I would dispute that point." He admitted that they lost a few superior choices but that the average quality of entering students has not changed con­siderably. 
Dr. Henry also emphasized that the quality of instructors has gone up at St. Mary's. "I think we have been more careful in screening professor in the the last 18 montsh than the previous 18." 
St. Mary's is currently seeking a foundation grant so that several faculty members can be retained over the summer to work ex­elusively on revamping courses and changing teaching methods, Dr. Henry announced.

McGovern to speak here 
David Kaminski Staff Reporter 
Senator George S. McGovern will speak at Notre Dame next Sunday, November 11, at 8 p.m. in Stepan Center. McGovern comes to campus one year after his overwhelming loss to President Richard Nixon in the 1972 election. The Notre Dame appearance will be McGovern's only other trip,this year to anywhere but his native South Dakota, where he faces reelection to the Senate in 1974. 
Sunday's appearance will be McGovern's third visit to Notre Dame in recent years. He first came to Notre Dame in 1967, where he debated the Vietnam War with Senator Gail McGee of Wyoming. McGovern and McGee were both liberal Democrats, but McGee supported the Administration's war efforts, whereas McGovern had a record of opposition to the Vietnam War dating from 1963. 
At that time, McGovern said that the war was leaving America with "a limited amount of moral, in­tellectual and emotional energy we can apply to comestic problems." 
McGovern came again in 1967 to discuss his role in the upcoming presidential race of 1968. James Bogle, then professor of govern­ment at Notre Dame, was Midwest coordinator for McCarthy for President. He tried to persuade McGovern to oppose President Johnson in the 1968 South Dakota presidential primary as a favorite son and stand-in for Eugene McCarthy. 

McGovern decided to wait and see what Robert Kennedy would do, so he turned down Bogle's suggestion. Apparently Kennedy was thinking along the same lines, because after he was a candidate in 1968, Kennedytold columnist Jimmy Breslin that he would have stayed out of the race himself and worked for McGovern against Johnson and McCarthy if McGovern had decided to enter the race. 
McGovern's next came to Notre Dame in October of 1970 to cam­paign for Congressman John

WASHINGTON <UPI>-Voters in New Jersey and Virginia chose new governors Tuesday in the first statewide elections since the Watergate and Agnew scandals burst on the political scene. 
With Republicans leaving office in both states, the Democrats had high hopes of increasing their national majority of 31-19 in gover­norships and scoring a resounding psychological victory over the beleaguered GOP.

WASHINGTON <UPI>--President Nixon plans to address the nation Wednesday night on a "very acute" energy crisis now heightened by the Middle East conflict and prospects for a cold winter, White House aides said Tuesday. 
Nixon was expected to ask Congress for broad emergency powers to institute a rationing program if it is needed. Aides to the President said he was expected to request a lowering of automobile speed limits, temporary modification of clean air standards to allow wider use of coal, a cutback on airline schedules and other conservation measures.

The xix student positions on the University Judicial Board will be filled by November 19, according to Fred Syburg, chairman of the Student Life Council (SLC). 
The two student positions on the Judicial Appeals Board will also be filled by that time, he stated. 
"We're attempting to create a pool of people of judicial tern­perament for the board," Syburg explained."Until then, we are in a position to handle any cases which may come up," he added. 
The responsibility of choosing the membership of the judicial boards lies with the Rules Com­mitee of the SLC, Judicial Co­ordinator Dave Grimmer said.

SMC student~s condition fair 
by Rick Scharf Staff Reporter 

Pamela Anne Waldeck remains in fair condition today in St. Joseph's Hospital according to hospital sources. Waldeck, a St. Mary's student, was struck by a car Friday night on the main road of St. Mary's campus while returning from Notre Dame. 
Suffering from a dislocated pelvis and head injuries, Waldeck continues to be kept in the in­tensive care unit of the hospital. Doctors will decide later in the week if Waldeck s hould be placed in traction, or can be flown home to California with her mother, who arrived in South Bend on Saturday. 
Waldeck was struck by a car allegedly driven by Peggy McDonough, also a St. Mary's student. McDonough reportedly was unaware that she had hit anyone. Indiana State Trooper Barry Edds stated that "the driver of the car was ticketed for failure of duties in an accident." Indiana law requires all drivers, in the event of an accident, to stop and render aid or assistance to any victims involved.

Students accusec of violating university rules are given three options, Macheca stated. 
"He may choose to meet the dean of students on a one-to-one basis or meet with a hearing of­ficer mutually agreed upon or appear before the University Judicial Board," Macheca said. 
If either the student or the dean of students wishes to appeal the decision, the case is brought before the Judicial Appeals Board.

One year after landslide victory 
Nixon popularity still on decline 
Editor's note President Nixon won re-election by a landslide of historic dimensions a year ago this week and was endorsed by 61 per cent of the American electorate. But this weekend the Gallup poll showed his popular support had toboganned to just 27 per cent because of the events of Watergate. The · following article tells of Nixon's promises and hopes of then and the realities he faces now. 
By ROBERT J. TAYLOR 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -One year ago, a seemingly confident and very much in charge Richard Nixon outlined a second tern1 progran1 of open government dedicated to inter­nal reform that would regener­ate a spirit of national greatness. 
Permissiveness and a govern­ment that promised more than could be delivered had brought the nation to "a very great spiritual crisis" in the late 1960s, as he saw it. 
But a leaner government that asked more of its citizens would nurture "a new spirit of independence, self-reliance, pride, that I sense in the American people," Nixon said. 
Nixon could justifiably be positive about his intentions and commanding in his sense of leadership in that extraordinary Nov. 5 interview. 
His $60 million re-election campaign was at an end with polls showing a landslide victory in store-a mandate to conduct government his way that could not be denied. He enjoyed the editorial support of over 70 per cent of the nation's newspapers. 
The polls were right. Two days later, a curiously subdued Richard Nixon retired in solitude to a White House study and, while his family partied in another room, sat by a crackling fireplace and me­thodically made notes on a yellow legal pad as election returns came in. 
They added up to the greatest presidential electoral plurality in history, a sweep of every state but one, a percentage of the vote just a hair below the all-time record. 
In the only poll that really counts, Nixon found his leader­ship approved by better than 61 per cent of the American voters. 
The victory was impressive, but from Nixon's perspective not perfect. The "new Ameri­can majority" he had sought to weld together from the suburbs and the South proved on analysis likely to be a one-shot coalition good at the presiden­tial level only. 
He did not carry either house of Congress. His party lost a governorship. And Republican National Chairman Bob Dole, suggested it was a Nixon victory, but not a party win. 
The President told a caller that where he had expected to feel elation over his massive victory, he instead had ex­perienced an emotional let­down. 
Nixon promised on the 1972 election eve: "We are going to continue to play a great role in the world because that is the only way you can have the peace we talk about." 
And he pledged that by boosting the forces of law and order, appointing stricter jud­ges, he would deal with problems such as crimes and drugs that "came as a result of those of us who basically have

a responsibility of leadership not recognizing that above everything else you must not weaken a people's character." 
Further, he would trim a "bloated" bureauacy he said was "too big" and "too expensive." "Massive hand­outs" to the people would stop, Nixon promised. 
"The people are going to have to carry their share of the load. The average American is just like the child in the family. You give him some responsibili­ty and he is going to amount to something. He is going to do something. If, on the other hand, you make him completely dependent and pamper him and cater to him too much, you are going to make him soft, spoiled and eventually a very weak individual." 
Nixon retired to Camp David in the fall and reshuffled if not actually reduced the top echel­on bureaucracy. He ended American involvement in the Vietnam War, partially by renewed massive bombing of North Vietnam. The prisoners of war came home. A legisla­tive program bearing his intentions to reduce or discard a host of federal social programs was prepared for Congress. 
His midwinter mandate, as measured by opinion polls, was 68 per cent-a near record high for any President. 
And then came Watergate. 
In short order the nearly dormant scandal over the June, 1972, burglary and bugging of Democratic National Headquar­ters 
complicity in high White House circles and a million dollar cover-up. 
Nixon was forced to dismiss his closest associates. 
The Senate Watergate hear­ings began. Questions were raised about government expen­ditures on improvements of Nixon properties. The special Watergate prosecutor eyed ille­gal campaign contributions from milk men and others. Nixon's two-time running mate Spiro T. Agnew, pleaded n~ contest to income tax evasion in October and had to resign as vice President amid political kickback charges. 
On Aug. 17, public approval of Nixon's conduct of office, measured by a poll, stood at 38 per cent. A study by Congres­sional Quarterly disclosed that while Nixon was able to keep Congress from running away from him , there had been deep increased.

Dr. Henry explained that he has equipment, and an implantable heart valve. 
The university Industrial Research Program provided the two with a faculty research grant to get started. Since then, the Indiana Heart Association and the National Science Foundation has supported the research with grants of $11,317 and $43,800 respectively. The NSF's grant came only two months ago, but the IHA has provided assistance for about 1% years. 
Research up to this point, ac­cording to Lloyd, has been aimed at the development of tools. Most of the time has been spent on valve design, computer solutions, valve construction, development of a mock circulatory system, and evalutation of disc and ball oc­cluder valves. 
The mechicanical engineer said one of the major accomplishments so far is the group's ability to go from the drawing board to an actual valve for about $100. With the low cost, the researchers can now experiment with a varietyh of designs. 
Lloyd explained that leaflet valves in the past have had material problems. With the present structure developed here believed to be sound, the main problem is to find a material comparable in lasting strength and endurance to that of the self restoring leaflets in a human heart. valve. 
The valves developed at Notre Dmae have spherical leaflets made of a silicone rubber, which Lloyd thinks is the best material yet employed by his group. The Notre Dame researchers are now making modifications in the rubber to get the flexibility desired. Later the inexpensive spericalleaflets will be changed to a moree xpensive parabolic shape, which closer approximates the natural condition. 
Plans for the immediate future include continued evaluation of all types of valves. Three main phases are involved here. Com­puter programs are written to predict what blood flow should look like. The valves are then tested under stady flow and pulsating flow with equipment being specially designed for this pur­pose. Finally, the valves ar put into a mock circulatory system which simulates human conditions for am ore realisti.c study. 
The mock circulatory system is presently being modified for future work. An accelerated valve tester is also being developed. It will subject the valves to a fatigue test which compresses 10 years of blood flow into six months.

Second lecture this Thursday 
Dixon lectures on meditation 
by Mary Kay Baron Staff Reporter 

When someone mentions tran­scendental meditation to people who don'f know about meditation, "their eyebrows go up, and they wonder if it's a kooky sort of thing to do," states Harold Plotkin, vice-president of Sweetheart Plastics, in a recent New York Times article. 
A former interest of the Beatles and the flower children, Tran­scendental Meditation (TM) is growing and becoming widely accepted. Indicative of this growing interest was the response to last night's introductory lecture on TM, which was presented by a local TM teacher, Carol Dixon, at 7:30p.m. in O'Shaughnessy, Room 118. 
Describing TM as "a simple, natural technique for the ex­pansion of the sonscious thinking capacity of the mind, whereby the mind experiences finer levels of the thinking process, reaching its full expansion in a state of pure consciousness, a state of deep inner silence and restfulness." This expansion of consciousness is a completely natural spontaneous and effortless mental technique. 
According to the speaker, the basic prerequisite to the TM ex­perience is that "we must be in a state of pure consciousness, no other mental activity." In a state of pure consciousness, one's mind is most alert, lively, and ex­panded to its full potential awareness. 
"We are systematically reducing the activity of the mind," stated Carol. "This experience eliminates confusion. People gain a more positive sense of iden­tification. This state of pure consciousness, gives thought energy, intelligence, and crea ti vi ty." 
What are the bad effects of TM? Carol, grinning, replied: "TM is bad for tension and stress because TM gets rid of it." 
Scientific research on the effects of Transcendental Meditation, as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, has greatly increased in the last two years. Significatn findings have been published in prominent medical and scientific journals. 
Even in The University of Maryland Law Forum an artical about TM as applied to Criminal Justice Reform, . Drug Rehabilitation and Scoeity in Gnereal, appears. 
The results of these studies in­dicate that during the preactice of TM the practitioner naturally and spontaneously achieves a physical state of deep rest and relaxation while mentally he remains in­wardly awake and alert.

This revolution, McGovern said, was not to be of a violent nature but a peaceful reaffirmation of the principles that our government was founded upon. At that time, McGovern also suggested that he was "seriously thinking about running for the presidency in 1972." The rest of McGovern's weekend at Notre Dame included reading with Senator Hartke at the 1970 Shakespeare Marathon, talking

"We desperately need ridership on this bus," said Geisinger, "because Student Government cannot afford to subsidize the service. It must pay for itself." 
Director of the Ombudsman Service Bill McLean also spoke to the HPC. He assured the presidents that he has people looking into the matter of room­and-board refunds for those students voluntarily living in over­crowded rooms to avoid forcing people off campus. 
The HPC clarified an an­nouncement published in last Wednesday's Observer about Mardi Gras ticket sale prizes. A $500 prize will be awarded to the top salesman and a $250 prize will go to the second-place finisher. It was previously stated that the prizes were to be $300 and $200 respectively.
