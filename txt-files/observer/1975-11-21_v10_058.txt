Chilean exiles charge Regime attempting to discredit Church 


By Cathy Cannon 
Staff Reporter 
~he arrest and imJ?risonment of two Holy Cross Pnests and t~e expu~s10n of another Holy Cross P.riest and three sisters IS an attempt by the Chilean Gover~ment to discredit the Cat~olic Church and The Co.mmittee for Peace, accordmg to three of the exiles. . . . . 
Fr. Phthp Devhn and Sister~ Helen Nelson and Pa~la Ar.mstrong to the School Ststers of Notre D~me arnved m South .Bend l~st week after the Umted States E~bassy m Santiago secured safe conduct passes whtch allowed them to leave the country. 
The three were s~u~ht by the Chilean g?vernf!lent on charges of provtdmg. refuge and medtcal a1d to member~ of ~he revolutionary Left Movement. 
Devlm said as many as 90 percent of the may be opposed to te government. 
Nelson said, "these events are being used to discredit the church, because it is the only strongopposition to the government." 
"Every other area of national life has some gov.ernment agency controllifolg i~," Devlin ex­plamed.. "The task of thes~ off1ces ~s n<?t to organize but to dtsrupt all commumty orgamzationsand keep them from functioning, Devlin said, "At one time any group of more than five people having anything other than a work meeting had to have permission " he added. ' 
'fhe Committee for Peace was organized by the World Council of Churches about a month after the Coup, Devlin said. 
"The government has been trying to get rid of the committee for months, Devlin said. "The fact that it exists is a condemnation of the system. The govern­ment should be doing the things the committee is doing," Devlin explianed. He added,"The govern­ment-owned Chilina press always tries to slant the news so that it sounds like the government is doing these things."
The three religious said they aided two of Chile's most wanted activist and their wives for humanitarian not political motives. The activist were Andres Pascal, nephew of former President Salvadore Allende who died two years ago in the military take over, and Nelson Gutierrez. The two men were helped on the condition they down their arms Devlin and the two sisters urged them to seek asylum. 
Devlin defended his decision to persuade Pascal to seek political asylum as a non-POlitical act.

James Corbet, retired professor of History, will lead an organization for retired Notre Dame faculty members, their wives and widows. 
The organization was formed last night at a meeting called by the Faculty Senate Committee on RetiredFaculty. Corbet stated, "I think it's good that we have a center to work from. A professor leaves the university at retirement and that's the end of it unless you have a problem. I'm glad we initiated the organization." 
The organization will tentatively meet in late January with sub­sequent meetings four times per year; once in early October, late November, early March and late April. 
The suggestion to organize arose from a discussion betweeen retired 

ALL A PART OF THE JOB? Twice, earlier this year, President Ford has allegedly had his life threatened. Now Ronald Reagan, minutes after announcing his condidacy for the Presidential Office, has been in­timidated by a blank-firing jokester. Joke or not, the incident brings back memories of leaders assassinated in days past. The twelfth anniversary of one of them --John F. Kennedy --fa lis this Saturday. 
Under ex-History prof 
Retired profs to organize 
faculty members and the Faculty Senate Committee, on the Report of the Faculty Senate Committee on Retired Faculty 
The report itself stems from a survey of the 81 known retired faculty members on their morale . mcome_ and economic well-being,, professiOnal and non-professional activities, and unfulfilled aspirations. From the results
' 
recommendations were made to the faculty and administration and are expected to be brought before the officers of the university according to Dane hey. ' 
The recommendations aimed at the faculty were first to provide that two members of the Faculty Senate should be members of the retired faculty elected by the retired faculty. Secondly, faculty members approaching retirement should take full advantage of counseling services available to them in the Personnel Office. 
MIAMI AP -Ronald Reagan announced his Republican presidential candidacy Thursday, and then encountered a man wielding a toy pistol as he shook hands after the first rally of his campaign. 
Secret Service agents grabbed the man, and hustled Reagan away, apparently unshaken. 
The Secret Service identified the man as Michael Lance Carvin, 20, of Porn pany, Fla. Agents had been guarding Reagan for only half a day when the incident occurred at a motel near the Miami Airport. 
The man was questioned by agents at the hotel, then taken to 
Finally, faculty should consider making additional, voluntary contributions to the University Pension fund as a way of in­creasing retirement income. 
The recommendations to the administration covered matters such as keeping each faculty member on the university mailing list even after retirement, in­cluding the Notre Dame Report, the Notre Dame Weekly Calendar, the Notre Dame Magazine, Faculty Manual and revision, and applications for faculty football tickets. 
The university should allow the maximum possible opportunity for part time teaching and guarantee that each person from the Notre Dame faculty will receive an annual income of not less than $7,000 including social security and· that figure adjusted for cost of living increases each successive year. 
At the meeting Danehey noted, "The chairman of the faculty Senate got a letter from Father Burtchaellwhich was a very warm expression of approval for this report. He commented that the 
recommendations were sound and he will personally try to get through every one of the recom­mendations." 
Discussion during the meeting also centered on the retirement policy at the university. Corbet felt the point of retirement age was of psychological importance. He emphasized the importance of a specific policy concerning the issue. "During the course of a teacher's last year, he should be offered the chance to teach one course for at le~st two years. 
Today's issue of the OBSERVER is the last before Thanksgiving. Regular publication resumes on December 2nd 
Secret Service headquarters in downtown Miami, a Reagan spokesman said. 
A Secret Service spokesman in Washington said the weapon 
.vas  a  starter's  pistol,  which  
would  fire  only blank  car­ 
tridges.  The  man  who pulled it  

on Reagan was taken into cus­tody by Secret Service agents.. 
Carvin was charged with in­timidating a presidential can­didate and with assaulting a federal officer, according to Bob Newbrand, special agent in charge of the local Secret Service office. 
Maximurn penalties are one year in prison and a $1,000 fine on the intimidation cha11ge and three years in prison and $5,000 fine on the assault of a federal officer charge. 
Newbrand said Carvin was believed to have made a threatening telephone call last week from a Pompano Beach pay booth. He said the Secret Service office in Denver received a call Nov. 10 from a person identifying himself only as Michael. Newbrand said the caller threatened to harm Reagan, President Ford and Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller unless Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme was freed. 
Miss Fromm, charged with attempting to kill President Ford in Sacramento last Sept. 5, is on trial in California. Newbrand said he believedcarvimntended to harm Reagan. "He's a big kid-6 feet, 180 pounds. You figure it out," he said. 
Reagan announced his White House candidacy in Washing­ton, then flew to Miami aboard a chartered jetliner to begin a two-day, five-state campaign swing. . 
The Miami incident occurred as Reagan shook hands after addressing about 400 supporters at a_ motel near the airport. 
Reagan did not appear par­ticularly shaken by the in­cident. He was smiling as se­curity men escorted him to a room in the motel. 
Earlier, in Washin&ton, Rea­gan formally announced his challenge to President Ford and a Washington "buddy sys­tem" which he blamed for ma­jor national problems. 
He said he wouldn't be sur­prised if other Republicans en­tered the presidential race "now that someone has broken the ice." 
Reagan flew to Miami after formally announcing his White House candidacy in Washington ­the city where, he said, many of th­e nation's woes are · being generated by a federal govern­ment that is too ' big but "powerless to solve problems anymore." 
That was the theme of his Miami speech to about 400 supporters in the ballroom of the Ramada lrfu. 
He had just finished and was shaking hands when the youth pulled what appeared to be a weapon. The assailant was thrown to the floor by security men and bystanders. 
Reagan was pulled away from the assailant by Secret Service agents and, in the process, dragged to the 1ground memen­tarily, but he was smiling and did not appear shaken when agents led himupstairs to a motel room. 
"I feel fine," he said later at a news conference. " ...I just thought someone had fallen down. It seems the man pulled out a toy gun." 
"I hope it doesn't happen again,'' said Reagan's wife, Nancy. "I think you always have to keep it in the back of your mind." 
Reagan was receiving Secret Service protection as a presidential candidate under a security system that was put into effect after President Ford was confronted twice by gun-wielding women, in Sacramento and San Francisco, during September. 
As he began the active phase of his challenge to President Ford, Reagan said he will carry his conservative message "as far and as wide as I can," seeking to woo the 40 percent of the electorate "now disenchanted with both parties."

Ill-effects of overcrowding cited 
by Christie Herlihy Staff Reporter 
Difficulties in securing business electives and the cut-throat competiton in the Accounting Department are two of the major problems resulting from over­crowding in the business school, according to business students. 
The Accounting Department, which contains 45 per cent of the business majors, is "the dynasty" of the business school, one student stated, and the swollen department fosters grade pressure . 
"There is a real pressure as far as grades go," a sophomore major said. "I definitely feel the department is trying to weed us out through examinations like that last one (Prof. Erwin) Aranowski gave us." 
Senior Accounting majors said the increase in grade pressure is a recent development in the department. 
"Although I didn't feel the cut­throat pressure when I was a sophomore," Christine Gallagher said, "I have talked with sophomores and juniors and I feel that the department is trying to cut them out. Lots of students drop accounting because of the difficult tests." 
Assistant Dean Vincent Raymond termed the charges that tests are ·being used in an elimination process as "a rumor." "The Accounting Department is actually encouraging students into the department," Raymond said. "The department attempts to give them a sample of the work they will have to be able to do as up­perclassmen and as employees of a firm." 
Raymond noted that few students complained that the test material was not covered in lec­ture or by the text. Test difficulty is impossible to measure over they years,' he added. 
Cut-throat pressure does exist within the department, Raymond conceded, but he likened the pressure to the pre-med situation. "There are many recruiters picking over the supply of students with 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 averages. There is a definite supply of majors in excess of demand." 
Only the accounting majors complained of excessively large classes, many students citing 50 to 60 students as an average class size. ''There just is not enough time to ask questions with 60 people in the class." said Jean Flannigan, a senior. "I have had to go in frequently and talk with my professors about questions concerning the lecture material." 
Gallagher agreed, "I would like smaller classes because when they are personalized you are able to get more out of them," she said. 
Raymond disagreed that a smaller class size improves class quality. "It depends on the teacher. We have some teachers comfortable with 50 students and others who feel uncomfortable. The essential thing is to match a professor's style with the style of learning best suitable to the student." 
Class enrollment statistics do not reflect the "learning-teaching process," he said. 
Large classes are tolerable for many finance, marketing, and management majors, students said. 
"The classes are not extremely large," said Sue Schoenherr, a senior marketing major. "I have twenty or so in some of my classes. 
My largest one is in Arts and Letters." 
Her business classes were not so large as to curtail questions, she added. 
"The average class is between 50 and 60 people," said Michael Ricci, a finance major. "Considering the size I think the teacher does a good job for my needs.". 
Several students specified that · the real problem of overcrowding was no.t large classes, but the fact 
As program declines 
CAP downplaying 'elitist' title 
by Mary Reher ~t>nior Staff Reporter 
Originally intended to facilitate the progress of the brighter students, the Committee on Academic Progress (CAP) has gained an "elitist" reputation in recent years, according to Sociology and Anthropology Professor Richard LaManna. 
As one of these professors recommending students for the program, he stated, "The program is trying to downplay this name now by admitting students not strictly by intelligence in academic curriculum. Students who are involved in outside ac­tivities are also taken \nto con­sideration," he noted. 'CAP is intended to fit the creative, imaginative student." 
Chairman of the program, Prof. Gerhart Niemeyer stated, "The CAP program has lately lost some of its attractiveness and usefulness since the University's curriculum has become more flexible. For example, formerly three theology and philosophy courses were required by the University. At that time CAP would help students select the courses better suited to their needs," he noted. Now, however, only two courses of each department are required so CAP does not really benefit the student in this respect as much as before, he observed, 
Another reason Niemeyer cited for the decline of CAP was the value of individual counselors when the program first began in 1961. Now, however, some 
departments themselves assign 
individual advisors to students, he 
said. 
"Counseling is no longer the prime purpose of CAP as it once was. Therefore, we want to add something more innovative to the program to make it more valuable in light of the University changes. As of yet I do not know what it will be. But it will appear on the agenda at the next meeting of the CAP steering committee in December," he stated. 
La Manna commented, "Sometimes the . program func­tions, and other times it does not. Student succeed in getting into courses in high demand," he said. "However, some studentsuse it to get into popular courses which are not necessarily the best." 
Considering the possibility of CAP students getting into courses and thereby closing the classes out to majors, LaManna said, "I have never known it to happen in lower level classes such as those num­bered 300 but CAP members do not belong in those classes anyway. I do not consider them to be that challenging," he· stated. 
Advisors do not recieve 4>-;uf­ficient feedback from stw.=:nts, LaManna observed. "Often ~'ley just come in at registratio r.. for cards to get into classes and do not sit down to talk. Writing a yearly biography is an artificial way to force then to communicate with their advisors," he said. 
Niemeyer said that for the first time, CAP students now will receive student advisors as well as tacUlty counselors. Juniors

and seniors selected by the CAP faculty advisors counsel freshman and sophomores about the University in general. Faculty advisors will continue to help students plan their curriculum, he said. 
"We try to avoid structuring CAP into an honors program since 
such programs do not work well at other colleges," according to Niemeyer. "Honors courses restricted to honors students are bad because they tend to segregate students. Also, honors courses are not necessarily better classes and may result in the death of their quality," he stated. 
that there were few course sec­
tions-which makes getting the 
eight required electives among the 
departments difficult. 
Julie Dunn, a junior marketing 
major reported to Hayes-Healy an 
hour before the 8 a.m. registration. 
"Dean Raymond hinted that the 
finance elective cards would run 
out in the first couple of minutes so 
he said he would reserve a couple 
of cards for the junior marketing 
majors. I got one of the last card­
s," Dunn said.. 
"I really feel sorry for those non­business major who try to get into a business course," she added. 
Lynn Mertensotto, also a junior marketing major agreed that the problem was not large classes but in fulfilling electives. "We had a choice of three courses which would fulfill the elective requirement. After the depart­
ment's own majors picked their 
courses there was only one 
alternative open-JBusiness Con­
ditions and Analysis. We're 
supposed to elect this?" 
One business student questioned 
whether the department was really \Understaffed as professors John Houck and Robert Williamson contended in a previous Observer 
article. 
"You wonder where the teachers are. Why isn't the current staff teaching more sections? Some professors are listed as teaching only one or two courses in the department," the student said. 
Closed out of finance courses he needed to fulfill an electivl! requirement, Joe Pszeracki, a senior management major

Ad1ninistration: break is needed 
by Kathy Mills Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame :Students could really use a break right now, accordin~ to several members of the University administration. 
"They absolutely need a break," stated Fr. Terrance Lally, assistant vice-president for student affairs. 
Lally explained, "The academic pressure has been awful this year. It's been very intense. I've only talked to one nrofessor who doesn't think there's been a noticeable chang~ in the students this year." 
He said the hall staffs had complained of more depression in the students and of more fights between roommates this semester. 
":The students are too quiet," he continued. "It's almost as if they don't have the energy levels to rant and rave." Lally attributed this quietness to tiredness, depression and irritability. 
He also predicted many students will leave campus before the break is scheduled to begin. 
Lally said he did not know whether the Thanksgiving break will be long enough to relieve the tension. "I suspect we'll see some post-vacation depression if it isn't long enough or if the students try to pack a whole lot of living into the short space," he stated. "But right now we'll thank our lucky stars for this break '' 
Dr. Emil T. Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies, said the freshmen are "more than ready" for the Thanksgiving break. 
"This has been too long for the freshmen to go without a break," Hofman noted. "They're very tired." 
He also pointed out many more freshmen are leaving campus for Thanksgiving break this year than last year. ''Almost all of them are leaving campus," he said. "There are very few remaining." 
Dr.Charles J. Arens, director of the Psychological Services Center, agreed students need a break from school now. "The academic pressure has been building up," he explained. 
Arens also said students seem 
more anxious now than they did at 
this time last year and are more 
serious this year. 
He noted there is a mid-semester 
break scheduled for second 
semester. "If a <mid-semester) 
break is necessary second 
semester, why not first 
semester'?" he added. "The 
academic pressures are no greater 
in one semester than in the other

"There is a lot of academic tension, more than ever before," stated Dr. Sheridan P. McCabe, director of the Counseling Center. McCabe also said there has been an increase in "competitive spirit" this year. "All you neeed is a critical mass of students who feel it, and it becomes a kind of con· tagion." 
McCabe said the tension is not necessarily due to more work on the part of the students but to more worry. "I couldn't say to what extent this is due to the lack of a break or to what extent the break 
will alleviate this, but a break you're away from the University, couldn't hurt," he remarked. you get a different perspective on

Benesh also said he has the im­pression that students have more pressure and more work this year than last, but he added he could not make a good judgment on it.

What's going on here at ND over the break? 
by Marianne Schulte 
Staff Reporter 
Security Director Arthur N. Pears encourage alll students to use greater precautionary measures to protect their valuables over the Thanksgiving break than they would noramally practice every day. 
"When school is not in session is the time that the campus is visited by the downtown people and students from other schools in the near vicinity," Pears attested. "This is when the trouble starts." 
Citing carelessness on the part of the student as the major cause for campus burglaries, he urges all students to lock their rooms when they leave them for any length of time other than a few brief minutes. He also cautioned students living on the ground floor rooms of their dormitories to .keep their windows locked, whether planning to leave for the break or remain on campus. 
"Valuable possessions of students leaving for break would be best protected if kept in the care and custody of students remaining on campus," Pears said. "Even off-campus students should con­sider asking on-campus friends to keep valuables for them if they are leaving for Thanksgiving." 
According too Pears, any student may leave his registered car in the D-1 parking lot over break, whether residing off­campus or on either quad on campus. He explained that although all the parking lots will be patrolled regularly, closer watch is more easily facilitated if all of the motor vehicles are together in one place. 
Campus Housing related that because if the number of students expected to remain for the duration of the break, no special vacation security measures will be enforced. However, detex locks will be in operation 24 hours a day. Regular parietal hours are to be maintained. 
Hall rectors are ·to determine whether they would like their specific dormitories opened or secured. Thus far only one women's dorm has decided to use a cvacation lock. In the case of a "secured dorm" dorm, each resident will be issued a key to be used for entrance to the hall. 
All academic buildings will remain open, although many campus services will follow revised hours in regard to closing. Most facilities will be closed all day on Thanksgiving Day. 
Darby's Place will be almost the exclusive recreational function occuring on Thanksgiving, although it will be closed for the rest of vacation starting Wed­nesday. 
Darby's will open from one o'clock in the afternoon until

The events leading up to the exile began with the captur~ of Dr. Shelia Cassady. a British national, at the Provincial House of the Columbian Fathers, on Nov. 1.

November 30. The South Dining Hall will be open for all contract 
students staying during the vacation period. The meal hours are as follows:

As the Bells Toil 
--------------tim o'reiley 
As the bells toll the death of General Francisco Franco, they ring another unwanted echo of America's greatest policy failure, Vietnam. This country spent a staggering amount of lives, time, money, and effort in a misguided effort to halt Communism. We lost there and may now be too drained to affect the deteriorating situation in the Mediterranean. 
Franco's passing attaches a new fuse to a country with an emotional, and often violent history. El Caudillo first brutally suppressed, then kept the lid on, dissident politics for the past 36 years. Various groups have been emerging from their cocoons, even before Franco's death, and moving into position for a gloves­off brawl. 
All non-fascist parties are demanding to be realized, the left unwilling to wait long. In fact, they are already pressing for the ouster of the new king, Juan Carlos. The Communists have some strength in urban areas and amongst the Catholic clergy. Their numbers appear to be increasing, and not too hesitant about igniting a new civil war. 
The people in general, want relief from the censorship and the powerful Guardia Civil. Both incoming tourists and Spaniards vacationing in other countries have whetted the appetite for a more liberal democracy. While not losing their relative prosperity, many Spaniards would like to reform Western Europe's most back­ward political system. 
Lining up on the other side are the Fascists, determined to see Franco's system stay unchanged. They have begun to gird up for a possible shoot-out with the opposition and will try to keep Juan Carlos in line. 
The young, twtested king must somehow dance and weave past all these would-be tacklers, lest Spain go down with him in another bloody civil war. Spain's present economy, built slowly and painfully after the last conflict, would be shattered. Unless Juan Carlos proves a very astute politician, this could happen in a land that has seen extreme and destructive shifts of government before. 
Portugal, on Spain's western border, seemed in the clutch of a Communist regime only a few months back. But popular uproar was such that it forced the ouster of this government, and installed a more liberal set of rulers. The Communists regrouped and struck back these past two weeks, leaving anarchy the only leader in Lisbon.

Farther east, the Italian Communists are inching toward power through natural causes. The Christian Democrats, having run Italy since World War II, now run an Italy that is inefficient, corrupt, crime-ridden, and economically troubled, (and no, the trains don't run on time). By the next elections, the Communists will probably garner enough votes to realize the "historic com­promise," where they will be let into the top echelons of the government. 
Marshall Tito of Yugoslavia is one year older than Franco was, at 
83. He has unified several regions and ethnic groups that previously fought with each other. Once Tito dies, they may go at it again. 
The Russians have caused him a lot of problems lately, too. His mixed capitalist-socialist system, relative freedom of movement for Yugoslavs, and distinct independence among Eastern European nations has irked the Soviets since the late forties. Recentl) uncovered plots show the Russians manuevering to crush this independence by armed force, if necessary. And still, ltio has no plans for his succession. 
The Mediterranean, because of its strategic importance to the Middle East and the Soviet Union, certainly ranks as a more im­portant stake than Vietnam. Yet the price of Vietnam has moved this country to shy away from such potential risks. Public opinion polls show a pronounced aversion among Americans to fighting for Western Europe, much less the poorer countries of the Mediterranean. 
In the end, all could turn out peacefully and for America's best interests. If not, however, we'll be caught carrying a beehive

Letters to a Lonely Go 
the future facing the old 
reverend robert griffin 
There is, or used to be, a small army of aging ladies who lived in a respectable establishment called the Eastland Hotel in Portland, Maine. I would meet them on visits to that Yankee town when I would stay as a guest at the Eastland. There would always be little groups of them clut­tered in chairs in the lobby, waiting for the excitement when a cruising movie star or a decadent dowager would appear, though they usually had to settle for Bible salesmen and the business representative from Upjohn's Unicaps. 
Once the estranged wife of an Episcopalian bishop had stayed at that hotel, and Eleanor Roosevelt had come to spend the night there, though she wouldn't register when the management insisted that she put the late-President's dog Fala in the hotel kennels. There really wasn't much excitement in the Eastland lobby, unless the Rotary Club was meeting, or the local high schools held their graudation dance, or the news truck came to deliver the evening paper. Still, the ladies waited in hope for events that never happened; otherwise their days were spent in looking forward to dinner time, when all of them would appear, dolled up and primped, in the hotel's Egyptian Room. Sometimes ­after dinner, a lady pianist would knock out tunes fromGershwin and waltzes from Victor Herbert on the lobby piano. By nine-thirty, most of the ladies were back in their rooms watching the evening television. 
It was risky for a single priest like me to linger in that lobby if he didn't want to become part of a dowager's diversion for that day. There was one particularly aggressive spinster named Miss Briggs, who had a reputation for being bolder than all the rest. Ifyou delayed for an instant to read the church notices or thumb through 
the pretext of needing help in unscrewing a fountain pen or adjusting a watch; after that, you were pretty well captured. If you had the time, you really didn't mind, because she was a nice lady who needed to talk to someone younger than eighty who wasn't suffering from an arthritic con­dition. 
"Are you a Portland priest?" she would say. Then, not waiting for an answer, she ­would add: "Miss Mary Lou Daggett will be appearing tonight at the hotel piano. You could sit next to me, if you like." 
I would murmur my regrets at having to decline her exciting offer. "I will be visiting my mother," I said. I don't think she expected me to accept her offer, and she might have considered me dull if I did. Her real need was to talk to someone who 
offered the refreshment of being different from the hotel cronies who lived off each other like the people on that fabled island who supported themselves by taking in each other's laundry. She also needed to be the first lady .in the hotel to chat with the priest. It gave her a temporary im­portance to be able to identify to the other ladies the New Boy in Town. 
"I suppose you are a Roman Catholic," she said, eyeing my clerical collar as though it were a union card carried by the minions of the Pope. When I tacitly confessed to being a partner in papal in­trigues, she said: "Miss Walsh's a Roman Catholic, and Miss Manning turned Roman Catholic three years ago. Mrs. O'Brien has a brother-in-law who's monsignorof a church up in Harpswell, and there's a Jesuit who comes here to see her every month since her husband died. He's a thin little man, and Mrs. O'Brien says he teaches Greek at the Catholic high school. Do you know Monsignor 0 'Brien up in Harpswell?" She asked the question as though she doubted the monsignor's existence, and as though claiming mon­signor as kinsmen were just a Catholic widow's way of putting on airs. 
"I'm an Episcopal myself," she said; but I knew, in spite of the distance of Canterbury from Rome, she was going to adopt m~ anyway, if I would let her. The problem is, with ladies met in lobbies (and every hotel has them these days, from Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles), you don't dare to let them adopt you. Fierce rivalries develop between the ladies who invite you for lunch, and the ladies who invite you for bridge. The Catholic ladies think they own you. The Protestant ladies want to question you on their hopes of immortality, and on whether, if there is a purgatory, credit cards and traveller's 
checks are accepted in payment of passage. You could love everyone of these old dolls as though she were your favorite aunt. You pity them for the loneliness that huddles them together, and you admire them for the courage that keeps them going. All of their lives at this point seem to be an escape from the nightmarish fear of the illness or the injury that will confine them forever to nursing homes. But you really don't dare let them try to adopt you. Eventually, of course, I ended my visit in Portland, by trying to avoid Miss Briggs and the tribe of elder daughters she represented. I would leave the hotel late or early, using a series of corridors and elevators offering a street exit that detoured the lobby. During my few days in town, I didn't have the time to get in­vovled. But when I finally checked out of the Eastland, I sent her a rose from the florist shop with a goodbye note attached. I knew the rose would be her prestige symbol among the ladies who would gather to hear Miss Mary Lou Daggett playing Gershwin on the hotel piano. 
And after Miss Briggs in Portland I met Mrs. Massey in New York. ' 
At ~oontime, ~o.u can see Mrs. Massey lunchmg at Patncta Murphy's tea room in the village, and in the evening she dines at the Plaza. She can quite easily walk the distance to Murphy's from her lower Fifth Avenue apartment, but at night, she needs a car for the ride uptown. Her chauffeur leaves her at the hotel, and later he is sent for to bring her home again. Most of her afternoon is spent in getting ready for dinner, but at eighty-three, she hasn't much else to do. She enjoys good food e~ten with other aging ladies like herself, widows and old maids whose family wealth has left them secure. 
Of course she doesn't always dine at the Plaza. Any fine restaurant will do as long as the service is superb and attention is paid to the dowager-type princesses who know even better than truck drivers where the best food is served these days. But Mrs. Massey does like the Plaza, even though she has French restaurants she prefers frothier Beef Wellington; and no one really knowledgeable, she says, would order the Plaza's Long Island duck. The maitre d' at the Plaza recognizes her ,and greets her as though she were expected, th­ough she has forgotten tQ make a reser­vation, and he sits her at a favorite table overlooking the Park. 
The saddest thing that can be said of Mrs. Massey is that she is lonely. It was her loneliness, I think, that made her call me up one day to suggest that I bring Darby O'Gill over the play with her French poodle, Tiffany. She had read a bout Darby in a magazine article; she had hear from a priest friend that I was in New York, so she telephoned. 
~'Tiffany wants to meet Darby," she said. She should have said that she needed a friend who was less tiresome than those she sometimes regarded as the con­temporary hags she was always running into at dinner. I really respect Mrs. Massey as a great lady, but the only way she knew how to treat her dog was to spoil her. It was only after meeting Tiffany­high strung, neurotic, untouchable-that I could really appreciate Darby for the plain, simple, good-hearted beast that he is. I really think that Tiffany embarrassed Darby O'Gill: leaping up and down on expensive sofas, barking if you dared to look at her; nibbling at liver pate and sniffing at bottled salmon. 
Tiffany embarrassed Darby O'Gill and 
Mrs. Massey embarrassed me. She would 
have spoiled me as she had spoiled the dog 
if I had let her. I could have been he;

Twelve Ceasars into doing Baked Alaskas 
on their bare midriffs. On credit charges 
billed to her, I could have hosted a soup 
kitchen for the Bowery in the elegance of

In the end, I had to avoid her, takihg 
alternative routes, as it were, "exiting from

serve her as a family. I didn't have the 
taste to be court chaplain to her friends.

The committee decided to asess a new approach in order to arouse more interest among the student body. According to Coyne, notices were placed on the dining hall tables, in hopes that students will think of nickname suggestions. Coyne felt that this process would stirup interest and creativity. 
The second plan makes the committee meetings open to members of Student Assembly, members of hall council, hall reps., hall pres., and hall vice­pres.

Irish face unknown Denvertea1n 
By Tom Kruczek 
Twice a year, from the beautiful OColorado country come a type of people that John Denver never sings about. In fact, no one ever sings about these people, and few people want to talk tQ them. 
They come into a town with a wily 
leader who possesses a unique ·trackrecord ofperformance and will do almost anything 'needed· 
to win. 
These strange people hale mostly from the re~ion of western Canada and the upper realm of the United States. 
They are the Denver Pioneers hockey team and they invade the ACC for a Friday and Saturday night series. 
Charles <Lefty) Smith admits that not much is known about these men who are more at home felling trees, and sleeping in log houses. "What we know about them comes mostly from the grapevine," Smith commented. "They never really release alot about who they have recruited, but we do know that they recruit mostly from western Canada." 
Usually, these north woodsmen play a tough brand of hockey, after all, what is there to do there other than play hockey? Smith pointed out that if the past is an indicator, they will empha size defense and "sit back and just wait for a good opportunity.'' 
Th leader of this pack is Coach Murray Armstrong who comes into the game with a 2-4 league mark and a career record of 429-179-29, as he enters his 20th season with the Pioneers. 
Armstrong has much respect for an Irish squad that is tied for 5th in the WCHA with a 3-3 record. "Notre Dame defeated a very good Colorado College team in Colorado Springs. They swept the series down there and we know how tough it is to win in the Springs. We are certainly expecting a very tough series and it will be a real test on the road for our young team." 
Young in college experience, but not necessarily young in age. According to reports, Armstrong has heavily recruited from the Canadian Tier 1 leagues. Tran­slated, Tier 1 is a loose definition of what might be called semi-pro hockey. But it isn't exactly semi­pro hockey, and although the league has given up trying to define these terms this year, and allowed Tier 1 players to compete in collegiate hockey with no age

sively. If their youth doesn't hurt them, then Bo should have his sweet revenge. Wolverines by 7. November 27th Tuas at Texas A&M: The Aggies are out to avenge last year's 32-2 
defeat and head undefeated into the Cotton Bowl. They have a strong running game and the top defense in the nation with which to do it. The Longhorns want the bowl back badly too, and led byEarlCampbell on the ground, they will stay right with the Aggies. But this looks like A&M's year. Aggies by 3. 
November 29th: Alabama vs. Auburn (Birmingham>: This will not be the contest it usually is. Auburn does not have the team with which to send departing coach Shug Jordan out on a dazzling upset victory. Bear's Tide will end Jordan's disappointing season with a disappointing loss. Alabama by 17. Arizona at Arizona St: This could mean an undefeated season for State and possibly a ranking up around five or six. This is their only tough game all year though, so don't take it too seriously. Frank Kush is 
murder on his Sun Devil players, so he should be murder on the Wildcats. State by 10. Georgia at GeorgiaTt>ch · The Bulldogs are Cotton Bowl-bound, but 
stand the risk of taking another loss into the post -season classic. Pepper Rodger's has his wishbone attack down pat, and only a fine defense can stop it. After this game, the Cotton Bowl may have wished they'd looked elsewhere in the state. Tech by 3. Army at Navy <Philadelphia): This one should be even worse than last year's 19-o ,thrashing of the Cadets. The Midshipmen defense will probably sut out the Army again. This service academy feud will be settled without a battle. Navy by 17. Florida at Miami <Fia>: If the Hurricanes are coming off a loss to the Irish, they'll get beat handily by the Gators. If they are coming off a win against the Irish, they'll still get beat handily by the Gators. Florida by 
17. Upset of the Week: USC over UCLA, on November 28th: The Trojans hold a yearly jinx over UCLA, and should have regrouped from their downfall enough to continue it. Ricky Bell keeps on proving he is one of the nation's premier runners, and the Trojans, if they can stop John Sciarra's fine offensive attack, should save some face for this year. USC by 10.

limits, it rem~ins that the Irish will 
be competing against an older 
team, agewise at least. 
Denver is coming off a bad season. The Pioneers slipped from third to ninth in the WCHA with an over all record of 12-23-1. This year the Pioneers, currently in 8th place in the league, lost twice to Min­nesota-Duluth, then came back to split with a good Michigan Tech team and split again with an ex­cellent Minnesota team. 
Armstrong lost four of the six defensemen from last year, but has more than adaquate replac;emets. Freshamn Greg Woods will be teamed with Lex Hudson at first defense. Woods is the second leading scorer on the team with four goals and six assists. Junior Lindsey Thompson, who is third in the scoring race on the team with five goals and four assists will be paired with Brian McAlister on the second defense. 
At the forward spots, Armstrong has returning almost everyone. The top scorers of Chad Campbell and Mark Falcone is the will skate with the first and second lines, respectively. Falcone is the teams top scorer wiht five goals and six assists. Campbell has three goals and six assists. 
Armstrong will probably start freshman Jim Bales in goal this weekend. The freshman has played in six games, given up 31 goals for a 5.2 goals-against average while rejecting 173 shots. 
The Irish are ·coming closer to getting healthy for a weekend series. The wounded this week will be Terry Fairholm and Geoff Collier. Collier's hand injury in the dormitory which resulted in surgery appears to have gone well, with the center from Montreal now in a cast and will be lost to the team, it is estimated, unitl January. 
The Irish are coming off a successful series with Michigan, which brought 6,693 people to the ACC fort he twogames. By Smith's admission, Notre Dame played five out of six good periods, with the bad one accounting for the 9-6 loss on Saturday. 
"We're quite pleased with the games against Michigan," Smith stated. ''It's a tough league that we are in and with the traveling, the back to back games, and and considering who we have played, we aren't all that dissatisfied with 3-3. That's not to say that we wouldn't like to be however "

The Notre Dame football team travels south tomorrow in an at­
, tempt to bring their 1975 season to a close on a winning note against the Miami Hurricanes. 
The Irish are coming off a humiliating loss to Pittsburgh and a week of reports that the Notre Dame team is dissatisfied with Head Coach Dan Devine. Dave Israel of the Washington Star, reported earlier this week that the Notre Dame team rejected a bid from the Cotton Bowl because they were "fed up with playing for 
Devine." 
Israel's report was denied by Devine, several players and Fr. Edmund Joyce, executive vice­president inchargeof athletics, but its affect on the team remains to be 

seen. 
Miami enters tomorrow's game with a 2-6 record, but has dropped a one point decision to Navy and a three point decision to Oklahoma. 
') Their other losses have come at the 
·~ 
( hands of Georgia Tech, Nebraska, Colorado and Boston College. 

Devine feels that the Hurricanes will give his Irish a rugged battle. "They're in excellent football team, very, very tough," he said. "They've played everyone very close, the best in the country. We're going right back into the rattlesnake's nest." 
The Irish will be without the services of Bob Golic, Terry

Eurick and Jim Weiler. Steve Quehl is questionable. AI Hunter and Joe Montana, both of whom missed last week's game, will also miss tomorrow's contest. 
Rick Slager will again open at quarterback for the Irish. Sophomore Steve Schmitz will start at the halfback position vacated by Hunter, Eurick and Weiler. 
Co-captains Ed Bauer an~ ~im Stock will lead seniors AI WuJciak, Steve Quehl, Pat Polen, Rick Slage, Steve Niehaus and Tom Lopienski in their final game for the Irish. 
Miami's offense, which has 
scored only 15 touchdowns in eight 
games, is led by quarterback Kary 
Baker who has completed 51 per 
cent of his passes. Baker also 
leads the team in total offense with 
864 yards and is sixth on the all­
time Miami total offense list. 
Kicker Chris Dennis leads the 
team in scoring with 47 points. The 
Miami running game is led by Otis 
Anderson, who averages 5.3 yards 
per carry. · 
The defense has been a trouble 

The Irish defense will be trying to frustrate the Miami offense this Saturday night in the Orange 
spot for the Hurricanes a~ year. 
The Miami defense has given up 
192 points this season, while the offense has only scored 137. Joe Bettencourt leads the defense with two interceptions and a fumble recovery. 
Tomorrow's game will be the ninth meeting between the Irish and the Hurricanes. The Irish hold a 6-1 advantage in the series, with

The big week is here. No more need be said except that Ohio State meets Michigan and Oklahoma faces Nebraska. Stanford meets California to decide in an important Pacific-8 match-up, and Harvard plays Yale in an Ivy League contest. Also, a revived Pittsburgh team hopes to pull off an upset over Penn State. 
Next week the action continues, with big matches between Alabama and Auburn, USC an UCLA, Texas and Texas A&M in a game which could determine the Cotton Bowl representative from the SWC. 
Here are the Irish Eye's picks for the next several weeks: 
November 22nd: I 
Notre Dame at Miami <Fla.>: The Irish have had bigger problems this week. Their saviour is the fact that Miami is really poor. That about evens out things. Notre Dame by 3. California at Stanford: These two potent offensive teams should battle to. the finish. :Each has a shot at the Rose Bowl, but Chuck Muncie gives the Bears a solid ground game that Stanford does not have, and Joe Roth has been excellent at quarterback for Cal. Give them the edge by 7. Purdue at Indiana: This game is for the pride of Indiana, and both teams have only pride to play for and very little to play with. The Boilers defense is too good, for the Hoosiers\though, so make it Pur~ue~by 7. . Missouript Kansas: Last year it was 27-3 in favor of the Tigers, and this year both teams are capable of playing real good f~tball. Both are coming off narrow defeats, and though the game doesn t m~an much, a Big Eight contest is never dull. Tony Galbreath and the Tiger offense give them the edge. Missouri by 3. 
·Penn State at Pittsburgh: Don't count on the Panther's performance last week as being an indication of their chances against the Nittany Lions tomorrow. Now, more than ever Joe Paterno knows what he h~s t? stop, and he'll have his team ready to do it. Dorsett is great, but Pitt IS not. Nittany Lions by 14. Texas Tech at Arkansas: The Razorbacks are still in the bowl picture if they win this one, so though Tech will make it close, Arkansas will make
'', 
it count. Razorbacks by 6. Nebraska at Oklahoma: The Cornhuskers have been super-strong all year, and they've got an undefeated season, ~nd perhaps the national championship at stake. Oklahoma, however, IS not a!l overrated team, they've just been lackadaisical lately. If they want this one bad enough, they can get it. It's going to be a great game, but the Huskers have more 
at stake. Nebraska by 6. . Ohio State at Michigan: tf ever a team wanted revenlle Its the Wolverines. For the last two years the've lost the Rose Bowl bidl 
to OSU, though it is extremely doubtful the Buckeyes ~ave _h~d the superior team. Gordon Bell and Rob Lyle can match Archie Griffm and Pete Johnson on the ground, and Michigan is a little better defen­

spurt that saw them tie the score at 69-69, then go on to take a 73-69 lead with 5:35left in the game. A jump shot and two free throws by Duck Williams tied the game at 73 apiece with 3:53 to go, but the Irish were hampered by the loss of Toby Knight and Bill Laimbeer , both of whom had fouled out. 
The team then see-sawed back and forth until Sergie Belov, the star of the Russian team connected to put the Russians up 77-76 with 
1:40 remaining. Dantley was fouled but the Russians had not reached the ten foul limit so there were no free throws. The Irish took the ball in bounds and fre­shman Bruce Flowers missed a shot. When they recovered the ball Sergie Belov stole the ball from Ray Martin, and the Russians had but to run out the clock to-win. ND tried fouling them, but under in­ternational rules, you can take the ball out on the side instead of shooting the fouls. The Russians did that twice to retain possession and win the £!arne. 
The Russia-ns started the game quickly, taking an 8-2 lead with Sergie Belov hitting from all over the court. But Dantley spurred the Irish on, and they finally caught the Russians at 21-21 with 9:21 left in the half. The teams stayed close until Billy Paterno put ND up by six with about two minutes left. Dantley added four points at the end of the half to give the Irish a 50­42 margin. 
Sergie Belov led all scorers with 30 points for the night. Dantley was second with 26, 18 of those coming in the first half. Alexsandr Belov tallied 19, while-Duck Martin and Toby Knight had 16 and 15 points respectively for the Irish.

Act V 

We are approaching the conclusion to our drama, a tragedy whichever way you look at it. 
In the center stands the embattled king. His subjects have turned on him, the town criers have scourged him in print, the masses have daily pressured him for explanations. Occupying the throne of the most prestigious court in the land, he is now enveloped in a haze of controversy that threatens to destroy his reign. 
Like MacBeth, he is haunted by the ghosts of his past. Like Hamlet, he is anguished by the uncertainty of his future. As in most Victorian dramas, his present is shrouded in mystery, the truth ,hidden by the wave of ambiguities that rise to the surface each day. 
His royal aides have stood by him, battling the assaults that compound daily. But the attacks are coming from all sides now, and the defenses are giving way to the endless pressure that pounds at the walls of the fortress from outside. 
The grandeur of Notre Dame football is now in jeopardy. It cannot be denied. To presume that everything is fine, and that reports of strife and disgruntlement are just a series of unfounded, isolated incidents is to ignore reality. The reports are no longer isolated, and they are rapidly becoming more than just incidents. The question of whether or not they are unfounded is certainly not irrelevent, but at this stage, it is almost immaterial. 
Since the middle of the season the reports of something amiss at Notre Dame have circulated nationwide. Lately they have increased to the point where we have either a mass assault by the media for some unknown reason, or a real problem that must be dealt with. 
This week has seen a series of articles by David Israel in the Washington Star citing player dissatisfaction with head coach Dan Devine, along with a lack of faith in him. Israel claims this was the reason the team voted against going to the Cotton Bowl.· University and team officials, along with several players, have denied this story. Yet Israel quotes players. Again, we have ambiguities. 
Stemming from Israel's columns have been a chain of other articles on this topic by writers throughout the country. It has been on the wire services from coast to coast, finding its way into countless newspapers. Notre Dame is news anytime; this is big news. The reports coincide with an article in Sport Magazine. It deals with Devine nothere,but at Green Bay but it does not help. 
There has even been a report, earlier in the year, that Devine would be fired. Rumors concerning that continue to circulate. It seems that the magnitude of the reports increase as the season prograsses. No doubt they are all over the Miami area. The Irish will have more to worry about than the Hurricanes when they get there. 
What it all amounts to is a tragic situation for Notre Dame football. We have been through years with less-than-spectacular teams, and there have always been individual writers whose anti-Notre Dame feelings have impelled them to take shots at the school. But as we reach the conclusion of the season, we find that we are now the target of attacks from all sides, and from all kinds, respected and disrespected alike. Some of the attacks are outrageous, some are laughable. Others are intriguing, and still others, half-believable. They multiply daily, they swarm around us like pesty insects that are too numerous to be ex­terminated. The Notre Dame football program, which has always stood proud and strong, is now on the defensive. Dismiss the truth or falsity of the reports <and that is not easy to do) and you still have the most besieged Notre Dame football team in recent history. 
The force of U·.e University's denials is up against the force of the ac­cusations, and what has risen from the confrontation is an aura of con­fused controversy where no one is sure of anything, and anyone can speculate everything. It is, to say the least, an unhealthy atmosphere. Rumor has replaced football as the chief concern (how much talk have you actually heard this week a bout the Miami game). Th need to be cleared up, soon. We are impenetrable only up to a t-oint, and the pressure gets worse every day. 
Camelot this court is not, and a happy ending to our drama seems less possible all the time. It is now Act V, the witching hour, when all must be confronted, or lost.
