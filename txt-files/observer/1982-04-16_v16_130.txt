Christian educationwhether formal or informal, is 
indispensable to the mission of the Church, according to Notre 
Dame President Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh. In an address given 
Wednesday to the National Catholic Educational Association con­
vention at McCormick Place in Chicago, Hesburgh said that 
"without formal or informal Christian education, it is highly unlikely 
that sufficient people will be formed in the manner that will insure 
the <;ontinual growth and expression of the Kingdom of God for 
which the Church ultimately exists." Hesburgh cited Latin America 
as a region where the lack of a Catholic educational system might 
well have hampered such things as the development of vocations. 
Describing the increasing numbers of Cath.>lic elementary and 
secondary school closings as a result from a "crisis of nerve," Hes­
burgh remarked that "one ofour greatest apostolic instrumentalities 
has been blunted and abandoned -even though the building was 
there, the need was there, the financing was available if one were 
willing to seek it, the teachers could be attracted, even though most 
would have been lay rather than religious -and still they closed one 
ofthe best gates to heaven that has yet been devised by the Church. 
All I can say is: What a shame! May we yet recover." Hesburgh called 
for a redoubling of efforts by Catholic educational professionals in 
the face ofthe decline, adding that "the Church desparately needs all 
ofyou and your enlightened efforts today if the Kingdom ofGod is to 
be more present in our day." -The Observer

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, after a two-hour briefing at Defense Ministry headquarters in London, canceled plans to leave for her country home 30 miles from London. A spokesman at her 10 Downing St. office said Mrs. Thatcher's schedule remained "tlu~d."

Authorities in Lake County' Indiana are ask­
ing the public's help in identifying the dismembered, abandoned body ofan infant found at a landfill this week. Lt. Richard Domazet of the Lake County Sherilfs Department said there were few clues to help identify the baby, which was discovered Wednesday. The body was uncovered Wednesday by a bulldozer, which apparently dis­membered the infant. "It made it virtually unrecognizable," said Domazet. "All we've got is a partial heelprint." The baby was believed to be female, but Domazet said that wasn't even positive. However, the coroner's office assured officers that the baby was full­term, ranging in age from 24 hours to two months old. Further tests are planned to help identify the child, but ifthey fail, officials may call in an anthropologist to help determine sex, age and other char/ characteristics ofthe infant, Domazet said. The police officer said the landfill was not a large one but several companies use it, making investigation more. difficult. -AP

Prime Minister Menachem Begin compiained during a two-hour meeting with Stoessel that Egypt was not fully honoring its .peace treaty commitments. Begin presented a list ofalleged political and military infractions, Israeli officials said. "We undertook to con­sider these (complaints) very seriously as a full partner In the peace process," Stoessel said. "I am optimistic for a good outcome."

Still a way to go 

We've all heard the old jingle,"you've come a long way baby." This little ditty can easily describe the progress made in women's sports in the past two · decades. Over the past few years, women have been assuming more roles in the athletic world, with the public recognizing their growing contribution. 
Complete acceptance of this fact is still far off; however. At Notre Dame, for example, their still exists an undercurrent offeeling that athletics for women are secondary to priorities like marriage and family. This attitude is .not unique to Notre Dame. 
Women athletes are still facing the criticism ofthose who believe that their place is in the home and not on the athletic field or court. Although progress has been made, people's attitudes still have a great deal ofchang­ing to do. 
One reason for the "non-accepting" attitude toward women's sports may lie in the fact that men have always had a much greater oppurtunity to make a career out of athletics than have women. Traditionally, students at Notre Dame have attended classes with athletes ha':"ing professional potential. In the past, the University has not been able to attract this calibre ofathlete in women. 
This trend is ending, however. A Division I bas­ketball team like Notre Dame can attract a greater number of high school stars than a Division III school. Similarly, scholarships are attracting more circuit ten­nis players, something dif­ficult to do in the past. The women's sport program can only grow because ofthis. 
The intensity level of women's sports has also in­creased in the past years. Be­cause of grade school and high school programs in many sports, women enter­ing into a sport at the college level are much better skilled than their predecessors. As a­result there has been a growing trend of freshman beating out upperclassmen and seniors for positions on teams. This trend has been occurring more and more in Notre Dame's women's varsity tennis team where 50 percent ofthe players are freshmen. 
An increase in the budget for women's sports has cor­responded with the growing interest. Sharon Petro, Chairman of the Physical Education Department, believes that the administration has made a commit­ment to women. She believes that the University must show that they are willing to make changes and to · spend the money necessary to do so. 
The University has not always been so obliging, however. It wasn't until January of 1980 that the Uni­versity initiated athletic scholarships for women, nearly 5 years after Title IX went into effect. Until that time, University administrators openly expressed their op­position to Title IX, fearing that it would be the ruin of men's sports by drai .ning their budget. One University employee estimated that the University paid Sl million 
in lawyers' fees to fight Title IX in court.

As a teacher, Petro has seen the attitude changes which have occurred within the classroom ·setting. Men and women in the freshmen gym classes still seem to be attacted to traditional "boys" and "girls" sports but mixing is occurring more and more. IfclaSses were not coed, for example, it is very possible that men would never see that women are as athletically capable as they are in many sports. In the same sense, many women would never realize that they can compete with men. Coeducational gym claSses force the individual into rethinking their own abilities. 
Although Petro does not see a sexist atmosphere in physical education, she does believe that females are often treated differently than men in gym classes. In the. 
.more sports like racquetball, women are often separated from men in tournaments because their instructors (male) feel that the women will be hurt in competion. One hundred and thirty years as an all­male school has established an attitude of male dominancy in the minds of .many. The "older" population still has not fully accepted . the role ofwomen in sports. Much of the progress that has taken place can be at­tributed to the efforts of people like Billie Jean King who have worked endlessly to make people aware of the 
r;~~~~~~~Q. -presence ofwomen and the "' changes that need to be made. 
Many doubt that it is possible to legislate people's attitudes; prejudices are never easily changed. Most · people will agree that only time can change these at­titudes. 
The University's· tenth year of coeducation this year has brought about a number ofspeeches about the con­tribution that women have made in the University and their important role in the future of Notre Dame. The time when women had to prove themselves has passed. The sooner our attitudes change, the better things will be for women athletes.

"The current image on the Shroud ofTurin is not magical. The image is there becau~ of the iron oxide and collogin present." 
This is the conclusion made by Dr. Robert Muggli, microscopist who spoke last night in the N~tre Dame Ubrary Auditorium. Muggli is employed by McCrone Associates, a scientific investigation firm.

Students increase, faculty unchanged 
By CINDY COLDIRON 
StuffReporter 
In the past five years the number of students enrolled in the College of Engineering has increased sub· stantially while there has been vir­tually no increase in the number of faculty members. 
The total enrollment in this col­lege has increased from 825 stu· dents in 197'5 to 1,300 in the fall of 1981. The percentage of women en­rolled in engineering has also in­crea.~ed from under 10 percent in 197'5 to over 20 percent by 1981. 
Predicting that he expected the number of students enrolled in the School of Engineering to peak soon, Dean of Engineering Roger Schmitz said that "we would be overreacting if we increased the number of faculty because we would have to decrease it when the number ofstu· dents declined." 
Dean Schmitz said that the management of enrollment could not be acomplished unless there were major changes in policy ad­ministration. These changes, he said, were not necessary. Instead, he sug­gested "better jobs in advising and counseling students in the school of engineering" as a possible solution for the current increase. 
Assistant Dean ofEngineering,Jer­ry Marley, referred to the growing engineering enrollment at Notre Dame "as part ofa nation-wide trend occuring In many universities across the country." He explained, "It may have been a question that we were merely under-utilized when we only

tist to dispute the authenticity ofthe cloth. 
McCrone made his discoveries by microscopic examination, "This is something none of the other scten· tists ever did," said Muggli. 
The investigation revealed that the shroud is coated with a film of iron oxide and collogin, a mixture commonly used as a pigment for centuries. It is not known from the investigation whether a pigment ever existed on the shroud or if an original pigment was enhanced to preserve the existing image. 
The film, much like tempra paints, was probably applied to the shroud sometime during the sixteenth cen­tury, Muggli speculates. 
Fibers from all parts ofthe shroud 
had 825 students in the school of Engineering and we are just now ap· proaching our capacity." 
Referring to the problem of being unable to shift faculty back and forth from one academic unit to another to meet student enrollment fluctua­tions, Marley stated that for the most part they have handled increased en­rollment with an increase in the size ofsections. 
"Chemical, Electrical, and Mec­hanical are the most impacted departments, but we could stand a peak load for a short time without seriously impacting the quality of education," Marley said. "From an educational quality standpoint, we do need to decrease enrollment from where it presentiJ.~~~nds."

were microscopically studied. "The blood on the fibers are quite red," said Muggli. This contradicts the fact that old blood is brown. 
Only small amounts ofsulfur were ~ound in the blood stained areas, also indicating that the stains could not be blood, according to Muggli. 
Other tests were performed on the stained portions of the cloth to determine the presence of blood. These all proved negative, "even though these same tests turned up positive when done on Egyptian mummies," Muggli said. 
Muggli does not contend that all previous evidence regarding the shroud is no longer valid, but he does emphasize that these new dis­coveries cannot be ignored. 
Dean Schmitz felt that because of this increase, the laboratory sections have been effected the most and some of the classroom methods have changed. "For example, the project-type courses where there is a need for individual contact be­tween the student and teacher are made more difficult," said Schmitz. 
Dean Marley felt that lab space and equipment were "resources that this college has been blessed with" and that with the addition of FitzPatrick Hall in 1975 this space has doubled. 
Stressing that this increase in stu­dents is not a "severe problem," Marley said that "unless the nations economy turns around, the projected strong demand for en­gineers will decline."

Wilmouth defines Board role 

BySANDYVALENZUELA 
News Staff 

Speaking on the oldest and largest commodity exchange in the world, the Chicago Board ofTrade, Robert 
K. Wilmouth, its president, presented a lecture sponsored by the Finance Club yesterday after­noon in the Hayes-Healy Auditorium. 
"Some people ~ave gotten a very, 
very  expensive  education  out  
there,"  said  Wilmouth  of  the  
Chicago Board ofTrade.  

"The Board ofTrade is often thought of as exclusively a grain market. It's not ...There's also trading in such diverse 'commodities' as. plywood, iced broilers, gold, silver, Ginnie Mae mongage cenificates, Treasury Bonds, and commercial paper ...financial instruments that are essentially the lOU's of private companies." 
According to Wilmouth, money managers in every company are in­volved in being a borrower or a len­der ofmoney. 
In 1977, 95 percent of the trade

cash markets,"stated Wilmouth. Thus, the buyers and sellers try to protect themselves from an un­favorable price change. 
"The agreement through which buyers and sellers come to is called a futures contract," Wilmouth said. "This contract states that the price is deterined competitively in a public market." 
Buyers try to 'hedge' changing in­terest rates. "Hedging is nothing more or less than a price insurance," Wilmouth said. 
Speculators, Wilmouth explained, are not as notorious as they are famed to be. Speculators are an im­ponant part ot the system. "Speculators assume price risks ... willing to be buyers at times when sellers need buyers and to be sellers at times when buyers need sellers." 
Wilmouth stated that, "Speculative investors are perhaps a market's best source of up-to-date information and analysis concerning supply and demand ...They per­form a vital role in the process of price discovery." 

Wilmouth also clarified the pan of the Board ofTrade in the silver price crash of 1980 explaining that they did impose special speculating con­ditions on the buying ofsilver. 
Art Departmentoffers The LanguageofArt 
The Notre Dame An Department will be adding a new course and offering two old ones which haven't been seen for some time this fall. 
Prof. Charles Rosenberg will be teaching a general introduction to the analysis and appreciation of art for the first time. This course, en­titled The Language ofAn (An 280) is intended to provide the student with some of the basic tools needed to understand and appreciate the structure and content of the visual ans. 
The course will consider anum­ber ofthematically organized topics, including: the relationship between material, technique and image; the deciphering ofsymbols; the status of the anist; his social responsibilities; and the issue of quality and popular criticism. 
The Language of An is intended for students who have had little or no background in the visual ans. It is not a studio course, though the stu­dents will have the opponunity to participate in one "making" assign­ment during the semester.

...Collapse 
· continuedfrom page 1 

The portion that collapsed was part of an elevated ramp leading onto the Cline Avenue Extension from Riley Road. 
The Cline Avenue Extension was being built to link steel mills on the Lake Michigan shore with the city of East Chicago. 
East Chicago city councilman Daniel Ferrersaid the project, which was supposed to be completed in the spring of 1983, had been under construction for two years. 
"Evidently they were pouring concrete on one ofthespans when it collapsed. Presumably what fell was the false work -the scaffolding that 
Law students 

sponsor weekend 

The Notre Dame Chapter of the Black American Law Students As­sociation will conduct its lOth an­nual Alumni Weekend beginning tomorrow. 
The purpose of the weekend is to honor the many acomplishments of black graduates of Notre Dame Law School, and to give information and guidance to present minority law students as well as undergraduates interested in a legal career. 
The main event ofthe weekend is the banquet, tomorrow, in the Ramada Inn at 5:30. The keynote speaker is Millard Arnold, a 1974 graduate ofNotre Dame Law School. Tickets are $3.50 and may be purchased at the door. 
--An events are open to the public. Undergraduates interested in a legal _91'eer are encouraged_to attend. 
holds up the forms for the con­crete," said Gene Hallock, director of the Indiana Department of High­ways. 
Conrad Swalwell, a 31-year-old carpenter who was working next to the bridge at the time, said workmen 
"were pouring concrete and all of a sudden the first section just buckled down." 
He said one 250-foot section fell 
to the ground, followed shortly by a 
second section. 

"The first section buckled, then about three minutes later you heard a big boom and the second secion went down," Swalwell said. "I saw three guys go with it. It was like slow motion. It just catapulted those guys throgjh the air." 
St. Catherine's Hospital in East 
Chicago treated 16 of the injured, 
said William Schenck, a hospital 
spokesman. "I don't know what the 
injuries are because the people still 
are being treated -but they're 
serious injuries," he said. 

Another accident victim was 
treated at St. Margaret's Hospital in 
nearby Hammond. 

A temporary morgue was set up at 
a steel mill infirmary near the acci­
dent site, said Willardo. 

East Chicago Mayor Bob Pastrick 
said the remainder of the bridge 
structure was in danger of collapse, 
and construction workers were sta­
tioned around the area to keep 
people away. 

Four large cranes were brought 
into the dust-choked disaster scene 
to help remove the huge, broken 
blocks ofrubble. 

A crowd of spectators covered a 
hill of dirt behind the accident site, 
looking down at the swarm of 
police, fire and rescue personnel 
picking through the pile of twisted 
metal and concrete. 

More than 100 emergency 
vehicles clogged the disaster site as 
doctors and paramedics, many still

His new immigration bill would provide for amnesty ~or illegal aliens_ dressed in surgical green-;-treated 
the injured before placing them on 
ambulances. 

The bridge spans the Indiana 
·Haror Ship Canal, which connects 
into Lake Michigan. But Hallock said 
the part that collapsed was the ramp 
bridge that connects with an inter­change and not the part over the water. 
Bill Rabb, 42, an employee at the Amoco oil refinery nearby said he saw the bridge go down 
"It came down in sections," Rabb said. "It looked like a bunch of dominos.',' 
Rabb said when he and two co­
workers ran to the site "there were 
guys lying all over." 

Willardo said there will be an in­
quest in two to three weeks, which 
also will investigate the cause of the 
accident. 

At St. Catherine Hospital in East 
Chicago, Schenck said those injured 
and admitted there were identified 
as: Charles Calhoun, 44, of Gary; 
Felix Schacki, 61, of Merrillville; 
Harry Bunkowfst; Mario Cloutier, 
39, of Hobart; Robert Pegg, 25, of 
Schererville; Kevin Riley, 21; Willie 
Newman; Fred Torrijas, 22, ofMichi­
gan City; Lloyd Peck; Harold War­
ren, 29, of Hobart; Don Hanft; and 
David Nelson. 

They were believed to be con­
struction workers or highway 
department workers, Schenck said. 
Two paramedics, Bonnie Moe and 
Artie Vasquez, were injured in the 
rescue attempt and hospitalized. 

Two other people, Don Bricker 
and John LaGura, were treated and 
released, Schenck said. 

At St. Margaret Hospital in Ham­
mond, spokesman Martin Kremer 
said construction worker Donald 
Ketchum, 26, of North Judson, Ind., 
would be admitted to the intensive 
care unit following surgery. He was 
admitted with chest injuries and a 
broken arm.

in the United States who have been here sincfY before 1980, and who have "put roots in their com­munity." Mazzoli feels that these people have done a service to the community in which they settled, if they have participated and worked hard at honest jobs. 
This provision is controversial be­cause some people feel that it rewards illegal activity. Mazzoli feels that it is "unfair to recognize that these people didn't break the law," while they were here, peacefully contributing to the growth and well­being oftheir communities. 
Further points about the bill which Mazzoli brough up regarded the question of granting asylum. He feels that the current system can't handle the some 106,000 asylum cases presently pending the INS. The bill would move the job of judging questions of asylum away from the enforcers. of the law to a separate group, within the Justice Depart­ment, but outside the INS. 
The new bill would provide greater leniency towards Amerasian children, fathered by U.S. soldiers in Asia, facilitating permission for adoption, up to age 25. It would also require that foriegn students in U.S. universities leave the U.S. for at least 2 years before adjusting their status in the U.S. 
Mazzoli pointed out that foriegn 
students who remain in the United 
States after graduation, and become 
citizens, "deprive their countries of 
their talent and skills." 

The last hearing for the bill in 
Congress is this Tuesday. Mazzoli 
expects support from the Ad­
ministration, as well as from various 
labor groups.

The current crisis in the Falldand Islands reminds us of how tenderly world peace is held together by Im­perfect men running imperfect governments. 
Edward Konrady and Randy Fahs 
President Galtleri's regime in Ar­gentina has been on the brink ofcol­lapse for a number of months. 
For over a century, the occupation of the Falkland Islands by the British has been a major topic in the Argentine press. The chance to buy some time for the fragile government was too much for Gal­tieri to pass up. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ha!! had her problems with the English economy. The Invasion of the Falkland Islands provided the Conservatives and herself with a major challange. If the government cannot provide defense, what is It doing? Any settlement that does not let Brltian "save face" will probably topple the Conservatives. 
The issue is an Important one fo1 the British. The English press I! seeing more than Argentina taking a group of islands. They see a rein· , carnation of a Hitler mentality ...-It 
the English do not stop a "power---~--.... 
hungry dictator" from taking land at will, who will? They are feeling the reverberations of Czechoslovakia's takeover (through the Munich Con­ference of 1938), and strong action Is necessary. 
A face-saving compromise can be the only solution to this problem. Thatcher and the Conservatives

know what Is at stake and will not go 
down without a major fight. 
If Galtieri loses, his government will fall, but more importantly, the new government will want to boost the country's morale. 
How? Well, if you can't beat a large country, you go after a smaller one. The Beagle Straits have been contested by Chile and Argentina for years. All ofthe legal decisions have sided with Chile. At the present time, Pope John Paul II is mediating this problem. 
Relatively powerful Argentina will probably defeat Chile, and a slow domino effect may occur. Peru, to the north ofChile, feels that Chile is unfairly holding Peruvian land north ofAntofagasta This is land that Chile received when England felt that Chile would be most favorable to English exploration ofthe world's largest natural nitrate reserves in that p~ ofthe country. 
Campus Voice 

Campus Voice is a new feature which will appear every Friday in Tbe Observer's editorials page. Each week randomly selected students and faculty will be asked for their views concerning a relevant issue. Today's question, asked graduating seniors, is "Who do you think should be Notre Dame's commencement speaker and why?" 
(Photos and interviews by Cheryl Erte/t.) 
LAURIE ZELLMER, College of Science 
"Mother Teresa because her life exemplifies tbe Christian tradition the University tries to present to us." 

An island chain reaction 
If Peru were to overtake this mineral-rich land Peru could not mobilize its army quickly, but once it did, it would have little difficulty in defeating Chile. 
Why? Well, nearby Bolivia has a navy. However, Bolivia has no direct water route to the ocean. This is a problem that Bolivians would love to remedy by taking Chilean land. 
North of Peru is Ecuador. Peru is holding land east of Ecuador that Ecuador once had and would like again. H Peru was busy with a war against Chile, it would be the perfect time for Ecuador to try to take that Peruvian land. Ecuadorians, of course, realize this fact. 
Elsewhere in South America, Venezuela is having problems with Guyana, who is having problems with Surinam, and ofcourse there is Brazil who feels that they should have the whole continent.

DearEditor: 
Editor-In-chief Mike Monk's 

editorial of April 1, "In Defense of 
Hesburgh." contained many inac­
curate statements and Innuendoes. 
Referring to the March 24 demonstration protesting Hes­burgh's trip to El Salvador, Monk portrays the protestors as a group of "narrow-minded Idealists." be­cause ofthe nature of their chants and an interview with one demonstrator. Monk Infers that chants such as "30,000 dead-no more -U.S. out of El Salvador" possessed asimplistic view which fOrced sharply-defined, but absurd, conclusions about the strife in El Salvador, specifically that the ces­sation ofU.S. involvement in El Sal­vador would "miraculously end the hostilities" there. 
Monk fails to understand the sig­nificance of posters and slogans. They were of necessity simplistic. No one could hope to cram a legitimate position into a short chant oronto a piece ofcardboard. Slogans and posters are attention­getters, as is a demonstration. Our position was essentially no dif­ferent than that presented in the letter of the El Salvador Solidarity Group, which Monk terms a "more credible" protest. 
Monk insinuates that the entire group of protestors consisted of members of the Democratic Socialists ofAmerica, but proceeds to base his criticisms of the group on an interview with a student 
who has no connections with the 
D.S.A We agree that 25 students have no business claiming to speak for the N.D./S.M.C. community. 
D.S.A. simply organized the demonstration. 
We respect Fr. Hesburgh's record on · human rights, but despite his obvious sincerity, we feel that Fr. Hesburgh was simply wrong about this issue, and we felt a responsibility to make our opinion known to both the campus and the South Bend community. 
The new Salvadorean govern· ment will be led by a coalition of right-wing parties, the strongest that of d'Aubuisson. To . believe that negotiations to end the strife will proceed better now that "one party acting out ofstrength will be: able to coordinate and oversee the negotiations," is extremely naive. 
Monk claimed that It was "fallacious and irresponsible" to believe that negotiations should have preceded the elections. But these so-called "fallacious and ir­responsible'' beliefs are held by more than 25 "narrow-minded idealists." Even the Chicago

Night life atND 
DearEditor: 
Is there something special, 1 wonder, about night life at Notre Dame, that accounts for a feverish burst of activity while the rest of the world slumbers ? 
Last semester, I lived next door to someone who slept all day but rose about 11:30 p.m. to start typing what seemed like a 600· page paper. With the onset ofwin­ter, we had snowploughs out at 4 
a.m. turning easily negotiable snow into lethal ice rinks. Just for good measure, there's always the dance of the Seven Toothless Vir­gins from St. Ed's, somewhere be­
tween 11:30 pili. and 2:00 am., 
depending on the phases of the moon. Now we have the latest toy from the Notre Dame road sweep­ing department: a four-wheeled dragon that makes a noise like a fleet of distressed Hoovers and Is launched nightly around 1:30 a.m.. Some even say that this dust belch­ing spectre is navvigated by a head·. less driver. If this is true, then it may account for the totally irra­tional concept of driving a large machine around Campus In ever 
decreasing circles at such an un­godly hour!

uring the early rehearsals, in the . process ofblocking, teaching the choreography, and developing the characters, Mousseau stressed the consistent portrayal ofthe con­cepts. All cast members, even those with no lines, in developing this con­sistency, created character sketches for their roles. Jones describes this process as "getting to now my character by determining what kind ofdialect she would use, where she was from, what she was doing in the setting ofthe play at the time, even small details like what she might have for breakfast." 
LaannDuczstczrbczrg 
features 
Mousseau would use a variety of techniques to help the cast get to know their characters. At one re­hearsal for Kelly and Jones, during a particularly intense scene between Cliffand Sally, Mousseau interrupted the action by firing questions at Sal­ly: 
"How are you feeling now, Sal­ly?" 

"I'm confused," replied jones sustaining the character ofSally, struggling to express her charac­ter's emotions. "It's all so ugly. I want to go back to the club where I'm desperately needed to sing." 
"So what are you going to do? Are you going to give it up because you can't cope with reality?" 
"How are you feeling now, Sal­ly?" Mousseau demanded again. Then he requested that they do the scene once more. It was stronger this time, more intense. 
Another way to develop sincere emotion on stage is to learn to respond to the signals conveyed by the body motions and voice in­tonations ofthe other characters. For this, Mousseau employed a warm-up exercise. 
"OK, pass energy," Mousseau in­structed. Kelly, standing opposite Jones sucked in her stomach as if 
·sh'd been hit with asoccer ball and rolled it out again as if to pass the ball back. Kelly caught it on his knee, let it slide down his leg, and 
kicked it off his toe. 

"Put it in words,"Mousseau in­structed. "Help," pleadedJones throwing out her arms for assis­tance. Kelly cringed backward as if to reject the plea and tossed his head towards herwith the retort,"I 
won't." 

"Warm-up exercises are very useful in loosening up the actors and forcing them to be creative." Mousseau explained. Some are also just plain fun. One day, while doing dance warm-ups to the beat ofa popular tune, Mousseau instructed five people to dance like monkeys, five more like teenie-boppers, five more with one hand on the floor. The resulting wild gyrations soon had everyone in hysterics. 
For a show like Cabaret, set in Europe, it was not enough that the cast members memorize their linesand add emotions, they had to 
.develop accents as well. Doon Wintz playing Ernst Ludwig and Bridget Dolan playing Fraulein Schneider became the resident ex­perts on the German accents. Raul Aportela as Herr Schultz developed aJewish or Yiddish ac­cent,Jone as Sally, a British one, and Kelly, as Cliff, an American one. Gabriele as the MC, spoke French, German, and English. 
Two weeks before opening night, rehearsals were moved to the "real stage" in Washington Hall. The full orchestra now joined the piano player Ann Berners, who had soloed for the past six weeks at all the music rehearsals. Orchestra director Bob O'Donnell, under the instruction ofMousseau, Famker, and Quinn, began to coordinate the beat, timing, and pace ofthe new instruments to the vocals and dances. "That is not an easy task," asserted Quinn. "And Bob is won­derfully patient in adapting to our needs." 
Actors also had to adjust to the stage sets. It is very hard, for in­stance, to deliver a line while trying to leap gracefully off a four­foot platform that still lacked the stairs. 
,Fink also attended these rehear­sals, her arms laden with costumes for various players to try on. She 
carried with her a stack ofindex cards to reference each member of the cast, their measurements, com­plexion type, and charactersketch. Most of the girls' costumes Fink had sewn herself; the others, she pulled from stock at the SMC theater department or costume shops in town. 
One ofthe last rehearsals, offi­cially called the "tech rehearsal" allowed Mousseau and Tim Nolan, the technical director, to set the lights. Said Nolan, "We add gels­colored plastic -to create a mood and cue the actors when certain spotlights will be on them." Usual­ly, after the whole show has been run through once, the choreog­rapher, vocal director, and direc­torwill go through their "notes" ­criticisms they observed during the performance rehearsal. "Sometimes notes can be rough," admitted Tricia Bjork, one of the Cabaret girls. "Once all the girls in the kick line had to sing·and dance their part alone in fromt ofthe whole cast. It was pretty scary, but it helped. We really improved." 
Slowly, slowly all the parts begin to blend into the whole. 
"Sure it's kind ofscary to have an audience out there," admitted Mike Kelly. "Especially with a show like Cabaret which swings from very serious to very light­hearted. You hope the audience will catch the mood change." 
"As a director, I feel that every action on stage is a reflection of myself, my interpretations, my concept," said Mousseau."l put myselfon the line every time the show is performed... 
"But," added Ramker, "every smile from the audience makes the exposure worthwhile." 
Opening night. The making of Cabaret is complete. The stage lights will go on, the cast will take their places on stage, and the mas­ter ofceremonies will appear. One story will end and another one will begin. 
"Wilkommen, Bienvenue, Welcome ... In Cabaret, Au Cabaret, To Cabaret."

here are a lot ofseniors on the Observer staffwho will soon be writing their "farewell" columns. I thought I'd get the jump on them and say some things that I've always wanted to say, but, for assorted reasons, never have.

second thoughts 
To the dining balls -I don't ap­preciate all those onions in my soup. Ifyou have a lot ofleftover onions, put them in someone else's soup, not mine. I really like your chicken cutlets and your stuffed peppers. I think your coffee is the worst I've ever tasted; try and work on that. 
To all the helpfulpeople ru whomI've never said, "Thank you.., 
-Thank you. 

To anyone who bas ever said "Only in South Bend'" -There are reports that phenomena such as 
snow (even in April), rain, power blackouts and crime have appeared in other parts ofthe United States. I have more or less enjoyed the five years I have spent here and I know lots ofpeople who share my feelings. I am convinced that you will be saying things like "only in Kansas City, only in Harrisburg," and "only in Carson City" for the rest ofyour living days. And I am glad that you will not be saying them to me. 
To anyone who bas ever said "Only atNotre Dame" -See above. 
To Gertrude the duck -I have been nice to you for five years by bringing you bread on a somewhat regular basis. I hope you will return the favor by keeping you and your winged comrades away from my car. 
To-the professor who flunked me sophomoreyear -Thanks, I needed that. 
To the priests and educators OJ Notre Dame-You have' made it possible for my life to be fuller, ric­her and happier. I'm sorry that I never told you that in person, but I thought you'd like to know just the same. 
To whom it may concern -I hope that, whereveryou go, you can take kegs with you. It will be nice to know that your lives will be fuller, richer and happier, too. 
To anyone who bas ever used the "words" mega, like, hyper, mellow, big guy, intense, ory'know to excess 
-Speak into a tape recorder for 20 
minutes and then listen to what 

we've had to suffer through for the 
past years. 

To Frs. Van Wolvlear,joyce, Res­burgh and Mr. Roemer -Keep up the good work. From what I can see you've all been pretty successful in making the University a good place to be. And I know you'll keep trying to make it better. We want it to be a good place too, but sometimes we get a little too excited when making our suggestions. I hope we have at least one future university president or dean in our class and that one of you will still be alive to hear him or her say, "Hey, this isn't as easy as I thought it would be." Oh, by the way, thanks for the education; I think it will come in handy.

Although I received so may precious fragments and colorful threads from the tapestries ofmemoryJosephine unravelled, it is the empty space she created in her heart for me that I will always remember. The present she made of herselfto me far outweighed the gifts ofher words. 
She sure could dance, that lady. Although many ofher natural rythms had been silenced by time and she had lost herpartner of66 years, she had not lost her step. She patiently coaxed me to try on her dancing slippers. 
She stepped on my heart that very first afternoon. I was so worried about my performance that I hid my weeping from her when she tearfully told me about that first waltz she danced with her husband. "My husband was a great dancer." Surely one didn't cry on opening night. Josephine cradleq my sorrow in her words "your heart is too young to be broken by an old woman like me." Her own tears had made mine understandable. She was comfortable with the empty space from which they came. 
Boywas I a clumsydancer. I kept trippingoverall my words. I was tryingso hard to choreograph ourfriendship, to avoid a wrong step, that I found it difficult to move. So I began to take my cues from Josephine. She always gave. Onedaywhen Igot to the nursing home she was selling gumdrops, gumdrops for hugs. Funny, she provided both the sweets. She was always trying to stuffsomething in my pockets with her gentle push ... 2 holy cards, an oatmeal cookie, 
· even a can ofred soda She wanted me to bake a cake. She couldn't imagine making a cake without having someone there to share the beaters or to scrape the bowl with. 
There were days when she thought all she could give me was a weak smile. She answered my questions with a faint pressing ofher hand in mine. I'll never forget how small I thought her world had become. Home had come to mean something as simple as being wrapped in her old familiar blue blanket. The faded and tattered remnant was as worn and tired as the lap it covered. But I found her greatest possessions in those impoverished circumstances. She was unafraid to admit to me that hei: heart was cracked and broken. She had drunk deeply at the well ofsorrowand was unafraid ofitswaters. She offered me a cool drink. 
I was equallyas amazed at her ability to ask me to do things for her. Shewas not embarrassed about weaknesses. She asked me to smooth her cracked and dry skin with vaseline she always kept by her bedside. I was afraid my touch might by too rough but I tried to sof­ten her wrinkled flesh. IfI could have mended that broken heart of hers with vaseline I would have tried. I wanted so badly to salve the bruises time had inflicted onJosephine. But those wounds ofloneli­ness and ofage had become forJosephine an anchor for identity and a source ofgreat beauty. Her loss, her "empty space" invited her to be compassionate toward all those who bear witness to her gently touch. I was learning to dance by becom4flg a partner. 
When I was small and read fairy tales I used to let down my hair with Rapunzel and ask,"who is the fairest ofthem all" along with the witch who was jealous ofSnow White. When reading, I sawwith new eyes and heard with new ears and yet I was never more myself. Much the same sortofthing happens to mewhen I visit)osephine. I try on the garments ofthe elderly and yet I learn much about my own naked interiors. Because ofJosephine's fading visual acuity, I ap­preciate more keenly the bright colors of the gumdrops in the glass jar by her dust-streaked window. 
I hear the slow and laborious breaths she takes with heightened sensitivity. The dance Ishare withJosephine is born from the two of us-but its fin~ configuration is greater and bigger than the bothof us. 
My relationship withjosephine can be compared to looking into a mirror. The glass is cracked and in some places itis broken but it is a wonderful, if imperfect, image. Josephine compels me to peer into the broken state ofbeing all men must reside in because the image she has ofherselfhas been reduced to these conditions. She can no longer derive her selfrec;ognition from her roles as a wife or mother. She has lost her partner of66 years. Her lap will no longer hold children. Her fingers serve herwhen whe wants to write. Her vision is obscured by aging eyes. But the beauty of the love ofthe human heart shines through the time worn shell that encases it. She is Josephine, an old woman. And I am Lizann, a young woman growing old. I hope I can dance when I am 87.

When you think of it 
v.
sitors from out of town, a young married couple named Paul and Laura with two young children, told me of friends of theirs, both Catholics, who had been married in a protestant church recently, because their parish priest had declined to do the service. 

Rev. ~obert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonelv God 
"Why was the priest unwilling to give them a Cath­olic wedding?" I asked. I knew there had to be a reason. Priests are in the business of blessing marriages; but they have to do it discriminately, according to the laws ofthe Church. "Because they wouldn't promise to have children," Paul said. "They both have good careers started. They're not sure, if their careers are successful, that they want to interrupt their lives to have a family." "It doesn't seem fair of the priest," said Laura, in the tones young women use when they get exasperated with the clergy. "I definitely believe in havingchildren, but! don't think the priest has a right to tell them they must have children. I don't think it's any ofthe priest's business." 
"My dear," I said, "I would have told them the same thing." Both ofthem were shocked by this admission, because they consider me a pretty laid-back fellow. 
"You mean," Paul said, "you'd let them go off, and be married in a protestant church, and lose their Catholic faith for the rest of their lives." 
"I hardly think their Catholic lives are over,"! said. "I would prefer to see them married as Catholics, accord­ing to the Catholic form of marriage; receiving the sacraments and the Church's blessing on their union. The Church has a respectful and loving regard for other traditions of marriage, but a priest would always prefer that Catholics do it in the Catholic way." 
"I suppose the Catholic way means forcing them to have children?", Laura said bitterly."Couples are having a lot of trouble accepting the Church's attitude." 
"I know about the problems,"! said. "Youngcouples, in their marriages, plan their families in the best way they can, I would hope, and no on can interfere with that. But ifa couple, making plans, say to a priest: 'There's no way we'll ever have kids,' the priest has to say:' I don't think you understand what the Church means by the tradition ofChristian marriage.' " 
"Barefoot in the the winter, pregnant in the summer," said Laura, with a half-impish grin. Behind the grin, I think, she has some dark image of the Church as a con­spiracy of Italian chauvinists, plotting laws to keep women pregnant all the days oftheir lives, from the bridal veil until menopause. 
"Maybe," said Paul, "it's more Christian not to have kids that you really don't want, than to have a bunch of them running around that you can't take care of" 
"People getting married have to sort out the priorities and values they will be working for," I said. "They shouldn't be surprised ifthe Church insists on_ some values ofits own." 
"The Church imposes on personal freedom" Laura said. "The Church has no business intruding on the 
privacy ofthe bedroom." I could imagine a churchman, 
an ecclesiastical voyeur, peeping out ofa 
bedroomcloset, trying to see what was happening in the 
darkness. 

"Honey,"! said, "we're talking about lovers who want 
to stand before the altar and make freely exchanged 
vows. The Church says: ifyou want to do it before a 
Catholic altar, then you must be thoughtful about the 
promises you are making. You must intend to be faithful 
to each other, without reservations and without any 
thought that you can excuse yourself later from your 
commitment, because the other has gotten old, or sick, 
or tired, and love is no longer exciting. You must work 
hard to extend your mutual loyalty until death takes 
one ofyou. Nothing in married life is necessarily easy; if· 
you consent to do it, you must do it as sincerely as you 
can, believing that God is on your side. Eventually ­
not necessarily now, or next month, or next year, but at 
least someday -you wll be expected to invite 
children, ifGod wishes, and human circumstances, like 
health, permit, to bless your home, and strengthen your 
bond ofaffection." 

"What ifyou don't want chidren?" Paul asked, "like 
my friends who don't know ifthey ever want to have 
children." 

"lflwere the priest," I said, "I would talk with them as 
patiently as I could, to see ifwe could reach a minimum 
agreement fulfilling the requirements ofcanon law. If 
they refuse to say that their marriage is open to the pos­
sibility ofoffspring -the possibility, mind you; no one 
can say on their wedding day ifthey'll have a family, 
since God makes no promisesoffertility when the mar­
riage contract is signed -I would send them to talk to 
another priest. I can't help them, but perhaps he can. 
Laura started giggling as I talked. She had tangible 
evidence, when she got married, ofbecoming a mother. 
No priest had needed to ask her ifshe would accept 
children lovingly from God. 
"What ifyou lie to the priest, agreeing to have a fami­
ly, when you know you won't?" Paul asked. 
"I hope people wouldn't lie," I said. "They hurt them­selves, when they are dishonest about serious matters." "It sounds pretty narrow-minded to me," he said. "Probably," I said cheerfully, "But when you think of 
it, it's all human fulfilling: to be faithful in love; to want to make an enduring promise; to want your love to be incarnate in family life. Childless couples can look very rich and lonely, because they've been too selfish or am­bitious to use their love in a creative human way." 
"You have no right to say a woman is selfish or am­bitious for not having kids," Laura said defensively, as one who knew how demanding family life can be. "You sound just like a priest." 
"Thankyou," I said. "I deserved that." "So you think it was okay for my friends to get married as protestants?" Paul asked. 
"Maybe they didn't have a choice," I said. "They were honest, and acted according to their consciences. Anyway, they're still Catholics." 
"Sometimes," Laura said impulsively,"I hate the Cath­olic Church." An hour later, she went to Mass, and received Communion. Someday, I must ask her what it is she thinks she's hating, when she says she hates the Catholic Church. 
Pictures on ''Exhibition Sunday' ' 
'"T1he Snite Museum was ded­
1 icated In November of 1980. 
Since that time many students have 
come through the art museum's 
doors. either because they were in 
Professor Leader's Art Trads course, 
or they came to see one of the films 
or concerts, or one of their courses 
Angela Adamson 
art 

required it. A few students, though far too few, have come simply to wander through and look at the art. The reason for the lack ofstudents wandering through is compound. First, the security guard will not al­low you to hang onto your backpack as you go through. Second, most stu­dents at this University do not have enough familiarity with art to really appreciate the finer points of museum browsing. Finally, the Snite Museum ofArt does not have ex­hibits, lectures, and events that would be interesting to the average student. 
Hopefully the situation is about to change. For security reasons back­packs will continue to be banned from the galleries. But Dr. Porter, director ofthe museum is planning on instituting evening hours on a tri­al basis. Next fall, gallery guides will be available in each of the Snite's nine galleries. These guides will have photographs and descriptive material on selected art objects. And the museum plans to institute a seriesofevents ofparticular interest to students. Astudent gallery com­mittee has been formed in order to conceive and plan these events, and act in advisory capacity for the museum. 
The firstsuch event that the stu­dents have planned is "Exhibition Sunday." Scheduled to take place from 1 to 4p.m. onSunday, April 18, "Exhibition Sunday" promises to be an interestingafternoon ofactivities. Two opening receptions will be held at that time: for the annual stu­dent exhibition, and for the 
"Ambrose Richardson, Retrospective Works" exhibit. The student show will focus on the works of 17 Master ofFine Arts can­didates. As the show is part oftheir degree requirement, the works will be representative of the artists' emerging identities as they have worked towards the M.F.A. The ar­tists will be on hand. Ambrose Ric­hardson, F.A.I.A., is a former chairman ofthe Department ofAr­chitecture, and is also the Snite Museum's architect. The exhibit is composed ofa representative selec­tion ofprofessional works, architec­tural designs and proposals, watercolors and drawings. 
"Exhibition Sunday" provides the student with an excellent oppur­tunity to visit the museum and enjoy the experience. Go see the multimil­lion dollar investment in the arts at Notre Dame which houses a fine col­lection ofover 12,000 art objects. Or just go and have a nice time being "cultured." More infomation on "Exhibition Sunday" is available by calling the museum, 239-5466. 

-THEATRE 
"Come to the Cabaret!" Tickets have been on sale for this 
weekend's production ofCabaret since April 5 but you may still be 
able to acquire a remaining one. Jeff Mousseau's spirited cast and 
crewswill be singing and dancing on the Washington Hall stage 
tonight and tomorrow night at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Cabaret 
comes highly recommended due to two things: Student Players 
remarkable record for producing quality musicals and Mousseau's 
singular talent for infusing a show such as this with an explosive 
energy. 

The alternative theatre experience opening this weekend and 
continuing, Thursday through Saturday until May l, is at the 
Firehouse Theatre at 70 I Portage Ave. The South Bend Civic Theatre 
will raise the curtain on Neil Simon'sPrisoner ofSecond Avenue at 
8:30p.m. Ifyou're a Simon fan but you''re counting your pennies, 
they will give students a discount on Thursday performances. Call 
233-0683 after 6 p.m. or 234-5696 for reservations. 
MUSIC 

The strains of music will be echoing from various points on 
campus, ranging from the sounds of Loverboy at the ACC to Dan 
Peek to a concert ofthe music ofMarc-Antonio Consoli. Peek may be 
familiar to some because ofhis former association withAmerica. 
Saturday in Stepan Center at 8 p.m., Petra will open the evening and 
from there, lay back and enjoy the musical talents ofPeek as he con­
tinues in the country-rock fusion which madeAmerica famous. 
At Saint Mary's in Moreau Hall's Little Theatre at 8 p.m., students 
and faculty wil present the music of Marc-Antonio Consoli. A com­
poserofexperimental and new music, Consoli has been workingon 
a stage composition based on a motive after Eugene O'Neill. For a 
festive evening, enjoy the free sounds of this concert. 
Ifmom and dad were asking how you've been spending your 
weekends and the best you could do was bite your lip and tell them 
··,
you watchedMasterpiece Theatre last week, try the opera. Don't 
panic! The Theatre Company at IUSB offers a production of 
Beaumarchais', The Marriage ofFigaro, Aprill6, 17, 23 and 24 at 
8:15 p.m. and April 25 at 2:15 p.m. Don't let the fact that you don't understand the words scare you. It's secondary. This opera is a clas­sic and a good one to see ifits your first experience. Brave your fears and call 237-4396 for reservations. ART 
To those ofus accustomed to the conventional style ofpainting 
and sculpture, a tour through Saint Mary's halls will reveal many new 
and innovative artists who are presently exploring the medium. 
Margo Hoff's showing culminates this experience. Hoff's works will 
be displayed in Moreau Gallery from A"pril I 7 to 30. By attending the 
opening reception Saturday between 7 and 9 p.m. you might have 
the opportunity to speak with the artist herself. 
DANCE 

En pointe at the Morris Civic, Southold Dance Theatre welcomes the talents offive guest artists, among them Ellen Costanza, leading soloist with the Cleveland Ballet, to their production ofSleeping Beauty. This production has special significance for the ND/SMC community because students and faculty from both campuses will be participating in it, some as dancers and others as administrators. Tickets for Saturday's 8 p.m. performance are S4 and S7 but Sunday's 2 p.m. matinee will only cost half-price. Drift off into fairy land for a few hours. We all need it these days. NAZZ 
Saturday, 9-11 p.m. grab your section-mates and pseudo-section­mates and listen to the band Tremor, one of the winners in the Nazz Music Competition. 
MOVIES 

As always, the cinema screen will be kept busy. At Chatauqua Friday and Saturday, 8,10 and 12 p.m., the rock musical Tommy will be showing. Ifyou haven't seen the movie before, you have heard El­tonjohn orThe Who on the radio. The film must be seen ifyou want to get the total experience ofthe music. 
Blue eyes and Blondie. Some people hoped for a Beatles reunion. Most women I know hope for a Newman-Redford reunion. Since that isn't forthcoming, see the next best thing, TbeSttng at the Engineer­ing Auditorium, 7, 9:15 and 11 :30.Friday. 
A revival ofClousseau is as immanent as the above reunion. Being There shows PeterSellers in one ofhis finest roles outside ofthe Pink Panther series. Trek over to Carroll Hall, SMC, 7 and 9:30 Saturday and watch the gentleman's gentleman make his way in the world. 
LOOKOUT How many of the choral groups on campus can you name? Glee Club ...maybe the Chapel Choir ifyou regularly go to 
10:30 mass. Chorale, one ofthe remaining mysterious five music groups, will be giving their spring concert Monday, April 19 at 8:15 in Washington Hall. 
Abiogenesis Dance Collective will be presenting their springcon­cert on Wednesday, April 21 at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. I remem­ber when the dance collective was just a gleam in Angie Adamson's eye. I would highly recommend seeing the culmination ofa semes­ter's work and three years dreams. 
"They make listening a sensual as well as aural or intellectual ex­perience for the audience. They make you listen with your body as well as your ears." The Primavera String Quartet will perform ( Thursday, April22 at 8 p.m. in Moreau Hall's Uttk Theatre at Saint Mary's. Ofparticular interest Is the fact that this group is one ofthe few all-women professsional ensembles in the country.

Simari--A true Mr. Bookstore 
This is the age of free agency in sports. It all began 
with Curt Flood, Andy Messersmith and baseball. It 
spread to hockey and, to a lesser extent, football and 
basketball. 
Unfortunately, it also has been a part of Bookstore 
Basketball almost since its inception. 
Everyone on this campus has heard stories about teams that were fairly successful, only to lose their best player to the ego-inflation of a better team and the chance to go "just one round further." 
But, happily, it hasn't always happened. This is the story ofone time that it didn't. 
Wednesday, Rob Simari became the all-time single­game scoring leader in Bookstore history. He scored 18 ofhis team's points. But "Sam Gilbert's Free Clinic" lost an overtime thriller, 26-24. 
Simari was a fairly decent player before coming to Notre Dame. His junior high school team toured Europe playing exhibitions. He was captain of a high school team that included Southern Cal's All-America offensive lineman Roy Foster. 
In one tournament or another Simari played against the likes of Maryland's Albert King and Arkansas' Scott Hastings. 
But Notre Dame is chock full ofstories just like these, and Simari was far from being one ofthe top players on campus. 
But his love for the game led Simari to the room of former Bookstore Commissioner Leo Latz in the spring of 1980. Latz and his commission were impressed with his knowledge of the game and his knack for organiza­tion. So, a short time before the ninth edition of this tradition got underway, Simari became the tourna­ment's fourth ~ommissioner. 
No one else on this campus was as involved with Bookstore. Only MCAT's kept him off the courts, despite rain, wind, cold and even snow. He put together a tenth-anniversary celebration that brought together the cornerstones upon which what has become the world's largest basketball tournament were built. 
And he never won a ~arne. 
...Clubs

for the women en route to winning the all-around competition handily. McHugh scored an 8.75 in the floor exercise, 8.15 in the balance beam and uneven bars and an 8.0 in the vault. 
Megan Zillig placed second in the vault with a score of7.8, while Cindy Salvino placed third in the floor ex­ercise and the uneven bars with respective scores of 7.45 and 7.1. Faculty moderator and field hockey coach jan Galen finished an im­pressive second in the balance beam with a score of6.8. 
Louis DeLeon had the top in­dividual finish for the men by placing first in the pummel horse with a score of 7.3. Brian McLaugh­lin had a 6.6 score in the floor ex­ercise for a second-place finish. McLaughlin had the top individual score for the men with a 7.9 effort in the vault as he took third place. 
Also taking third places for the 
team were Ed Barrett in the high bar 
. 
Skip Desjardin 
For four years he tried and, in each ofthose years, he fell short. His team lost 21-7 during his freshman year, 21-15 and 21-18 in the years that followed. As each new tournament approached, Sitnari had ample opportunity to dump his teammates-none ofwhom had as much as ridden the varsity bench through their high school careers -but he didn't. 
He played with a couple of guys who scored three points -or less -in all four games combined. But he continued to pass off, and kept on setting picks. He stuck with lousy players because they were his friends, because playing on the same team with them was fun ­even when they lost. 
It is very possible that nobody ever wanted to win a game more than Simari did Wednesday. It is even more likely that nobody ever deserved -by virtue simply of what he gave to the tournament -to win more than he did. One thing is certain, however -no one ever played a better game. 
Not Shumate or Brokaw -the concensus All­Americans. Not Hanzlik or Tripucka -today's NBA regulars. Not Lisch or Clements -the NFL quarter­backs who doubled as Bookstore stars. 
No one ever scored 18 points in one game, until Simari did it this week 
When all is said and done, Wednesday's performance epitomized everything that is good about Bookstore Basketball. A kid went out and played the game of his life, but lost, because he chose to stick with his friends and have fun rather than let the game get too important. 
Rob Simari played for the fun ofit, and can be prouder ofthat than ofa whole career worth of victories.

singles slot on the tennis court. In 
the classroom, she is a diligent pre­
med student possibly heading for 
dental school. 

LaFratta thinks the biggest adjust­ment she had to make from high school was battling homesickness. "It's wierd being so far from home," she says. 
Concerning the change to a new team and a new coach, l.aFratta had only good tales to tell. "It was pretty amazing," she says. "Half the team is composed offreshmen and yet, right away all the older girls accepted us. The captains, Tina Stephan and Carol Shukis, are always there for help." 
Head Coach Sharon Petro has played a major part in LaFratta's ten­nis game. While playing in Virginia, LaFratta played almost totally on the baseline, rarely if ever coming up to the net. "Sharon has added a whole new dimension to the way I play," LaFratta says. "I'm still a little shy at the net, but I do play the net more often now." 
In turn, Petro had some com­plimentary words for her freshman phenom. "She's a real hard worker on the court and in the classroom," comments Petro. "She excells in both areas because of her hard work." · 
So far for LaFratta and the rest of the team, the hard work has paid off. Last fall, the Irish captured the AlAW Division II district championship and LaFratta took the crown at first singles. 
The MVP award was another high­light of LaFratta's career, something she describes as "the nicest thing to ever happen to me." 
But unfortunately for the team, its spring trip to Louisiana and the following matches produced an 0-8 record. "We didn't play well," ad­mits LaFratta With a smile, she adds, "But you know the trip wasn't a dis­aster. As a team we got real close and got to know each other better. That will help the rest ofspring." 
As for the rest of the season, LaFratta is optimistic. "We always seem to ,be right up there with the other team," she says, "but we don't close the game. We need mental toughness and I think we are developing it." 
This weekend LaFratta and her teammates will be in Kalamazoo, Mich. They will face Northern Il­linois today and both Western Mich­igan and Kent State tomorrow. Not surprisingly, LaFratta predicts the team will go 3-0 this weekend and eventually go on to win the state regional tournament. 
"We should win regionals be­cause we have a lot of talent, a good team, and we are a close team," she says enthusiastically. "That's a big part ofNotre Dame, the closeness of the team, the feeling that there is more to tennis and the team than competition." 
Aside from the weather, LaFratta is very happy at Notre Dame. It is everything she expected and more. She sums it all up with a big smile, "I love it!" 
Somehow, it's not very hard to believe her.

The sleeper in this year's women's Bookstore tournameirt may have been found. 
"Varner's Virgins" could tum out to be championship material. Coached by Notre Dame basketball pbyer Bill Varner, this team shows a lot ofenthusiasm and potential. 
Varner has been trying to teach his group ofgirls some ofhis basket­ball expertise. It showed up yester­day as "Varner's Virgins" defeated "The Uncoordinates" by the score of 21-4. 
Sophomore Patrice Purcell made a strong bid for a scoring title (if women's Bookstore has One) yester­day as her ten point carried "Lane Two and the Outsiders" over "Aunt Jemima's," 21-8. 
Balanced scoring was the name of the game as "The Farley Five" downed "Body Human" 21-1. Sharon Koehler led the scoring with seven baskets, but every member of the winning team contributed at least two points. That type of balanced attack will be helpful as Bookstore moves on. · 
This result could possibly be a Women's Bookstore record. "The Fiesty Wenches" were not able to score a point against "The Double Stuff Oreos," who centered their winning attack around Maureen Milota, who had seven points in the shutout.

the year, "Twisters" barely got by "Three's A Charm," 21-17. Cheryl Sweeney put her team over the edge with a solid six point effon. 
Yesterday's action completed the first round. On Monday, the 16 teams that are left will begin battling it out to see who will be the last eight teams left. 
Golfteam returns to action after layoff 
scheduled match, the Ball State In­vitational on April 5, also was can­celled when sleet and snow struck at about 3 p.m. The Irish had com­pleted six holes on the Whispering Oaks Golf Club course, located in Muncie, lnd 
"We were even par at the time the match was called," said O'Sullivan. "It was looking good. It was a shame the bad weather came." 
With little practice under their belts, the Irish nonetheless will com­pete this weekend in what O'Sullivan calls the "very best" ­The Kepler Invitational at the Scarlet GolfCourse at Ohio State University. The 54-hole tournamnent features 24 ofthe best golf teams in the Mid­west, including squads from the Big Ten and Mid-American Con­ferences, along with several major independents. 
It will be a tough challenge for the Irish. "We've had very little practice outdoors because of the snow," said O'Sullivan. "So we'll be at ;t disad­vantage. But we'll do our very best. 
"If you have talent, lack of preparation should not hurt you," continued O'Sullivan, wh{)se team has not played since defeating Olivet on April 1. "With talent, a team should be able to perform on any given day, any given moment." 
At Ohio State, the Irish will be without junior captain Stoney Ferlmann, one of the team's top players. Ferlmann will stay here to take medical school entrance ex­ams. junior Tom Scully will take his place. 
Last year, Notre Dame finished 13th out of 24 teams at the Kepler, but O'Sullivan is quick to point out that the Irish wtal of 1184 was just

Defensive secondary 
Johnson searches for depth 
By DAPHNE BAILLE 
Sports Writer 
With five letter-winners returning to the secondary this year, defensive back coach Jim johnson doesn't need to worry about his players' ex­perience. However, the lack of depth in this unit has been a source ofconcern this spring. 
So much concern, in fact, that for­mer wingback John Mosley (6-1, 
195) has been asked to take a shot at the cornerback slot. 
"We lost two good cornerbacks in Qohn) Krimm and (Mike) Masini," explains johnson, "so we needed to find backups at that position. We looked t at the team and felt that nobody could help us as much as john Mosley. He's a very physical player -we know he's a hitter and he likes physical contact." 
In another switch in the secon­
·r-dary, senior mainstay Dave Duerson (6-3, 200) has moved to free safety, evacuating the strong safety post he held for two seasons. Duerson led the secondary in tackles last season with 55, while his 345 minutes played led the entire Irish roster. 
"Dave is definitely a leader," says johnson of the Football News third­team All-American. "He's a four-year starter and has played at every posi­tion in the secondary. Right now he feels very comfortable at free safety." 
Meanwhile, sophomore Joe johnson (6-2, 190) has moved from free to strong safety "simply because he's a more physical player -he likes to hit people," says johnson. Johnson admits the youngster is still learning, but "we think he'll do the job." 
Senior Rod Bone (6-2, 200) has seen little action this spring due to a knee injury, but the two-year starter will still be on the field often come fall. "With a year of experience be­hind him, Rod will be an improved ballplayer," estimates johnson. "He has good speed and is one of the hardest hitting defensive backs we have. He'll probably play a little at both the strong and free positions." 
Spring Football '82 
Rounding out the personnel list at safety is junior Daane Spielmaker ( 6­3, 190). "Daane has had the best spring so far among the defensive backs," praises the coach. "He gets an interception or something in every scrimmage." 
Johnson is content with four ex­cellent players at defensive back, but is justifiably worried about the cor­nerback situation. 
"Our biggest concern is depth," says johnson as he evaluates the secondary. "We've moved Stacey Toran (6-4, 195) to the strong cor­ner so he'll be playing the wide field." Toran also is learning a new position, having played the weak or boundary corner last year. He logged 300 minutes playing time as a sophomore in '81, third among the Irish. 
"Stacey is our best one-on-one pass defender," continues johnson. "He has what it takes to play the strong corner -we have all the con­fidence in the world in him." 
Unfortunately, there isn't much depth behind Toran at that corner. Senior walk-on Justin Driscoll ( 6-I, 
190) is filling the bill, and has opened some eyes with his progress. 
At the weak corner, junior Chris Brown (6-1, 185) returns as a start­er. "Chris is a good, smart football player," claims Johnson.' "He's a physical type and a good run suppor­ter. 
"Behind him we have john Mos­ley, who haslurneq out to be a nice surprise." 
These moves are an attempt to al­leviate the problems that plagued the Irish last year. "We have to eliminate the opponents' big plays -there were too many ofthem last year," johnson feels. "We'll play a lot of nickle defense, because we'll be facing some good throwing ball clubs. 
"You can't pinpoint one particular problem we had last year. We generally played well as a unit, but we got hurt by the big pass play or the long run. We discussed the problem, but couldn't seem to solve it in the games." 
johnson feels the players are on their way to finding some answers this spring. "We've been very happy with drills so far," concludes johnson. "The purpose of spring practice is to try to evaluate what we have. That's the luxury ofspring ball -we have the opportunity to see what each player can do." 
IRISH ITEMS -Tomorrow the team will conduct its first full-scale scrimmage of the spring. The workout, Notre Dame's 12th of 20, will be in the Stadium ...Former Irish kicker Bob Thomas (a '73 graduate) has returned to the campus this spring to work with the specialty squads ...Faust and his Bookstore team, "Old Men on the Block," are scheduled to make their debut Saturday at 3:00 on Stepan 5 .. .Joining Faust are assistants Tom Lichtenberg, Jim Johnson, Jim Hig­gins and ticket manager Steve Or­sini.

Women~ golf, soccer begin play 
The Notre Dame women's golf and soccer clubs will highlight this week's club action by opening up their spring seasons. The golf squad travels down to Evansville today for its dual match against the school which has the perfect athletic nickname for golf ­Aces. 
Top returnees from the fall season for the Irish (when the team defeated Loras College by 43 strokes) include juniors Louise Mudd and Moya Nickodem. Classmates Monica Paas and Karen Genesee along with freshman Connie O'Brien round out the top five holdovers from the fall season. The club, captained by Mary Beth Heslin, also will travel to Cincinnati for a match on May 1. 
Meanwhile, the Irish soccer club will host its first major intercollegiate tournament tomorrow starting at 11 a.m. on the fields behind Stepan Center. Six teams, including the Irish, will compete in the round-robin event. 
Other teams that will compete include Saint Mary's, Northwestern, Kalamazoo and two squads from Mar­quette. Thetournament is expected to end by 4 p.m. 
RUGBY -On Wednesday, April 7, the 'A' and 'B' rugby squads for Notre Dame played host to and defeated Purdue University. Mike Carrol, Mark Deflin and Mike Sosh each scored for the Irish in the 12-6 'A' win. Brian Moynihan, a graduate student and former "All New-England" selection from Brown University, was credited by the team for making the biggest dif­ference-in the match. Back Danny Pearl and serum Joel McDermott also were cited for fine individual perfor­mances in a team effort. 
joe Timmins and john Reid each scored for the 'B' squad, while Steve Schneider kicked home two more points in the 10-0 victory. Clark Keough was praised for his individual efforts for the serums. The squad travels to Chicago for tomorrow's match against a team com­prised ofNotre Dame alumni. 
WOMEN'S SOFTBALL -The softball club dropped to 3-3 after losing three ofits four games this week. "It

was very disappointing because there was no way we should have lost any ofthose games," says student assis­tant coach Bob Spahn. "The two weeks without practice really hurt us. Our talent is there, but com­munication and the fundamentals were badly lacking in the defeats."
