Secretary ofState George P. Shultz says u.s. government payment ofsome ofPoland's debts to creditors in this country helps keep pressure on the martial law government there. Forcing a default could lead Poland to repudiate its debts, Shultz added in a letter he sent to Congress on Tuesday, the second anniversary ofthe founding of Poland's Solidarity trade union. Shultz's letter, released by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., said: "Keeping the pressure on Poland has generated a net financial flow from Poland to the west. The drain on the Polish economy, together with our economic sanc­tions, is forciag the Jaruzelski regime to pay a heavy price for the suppression of human rights and freedom in Poland. By contrast, a

The South Bend job market worsened in mid­summer as a depression continued in manufacturing, construction, and wholesale-retail trade employment. Extended fuctory recalls and a scarcity ofsummer jobs contributed to 9.9 percent unemploy­ment rate in July in St. Joseph and Marshall counties, up from a 1982 low of 9.1 percent in June, according to the Indiana Employment Security Division. Despite the sharp, one-month increase, the July jobless rate was the second lowest of the year for the South Bend-' area-and a full percentage point between this year's 10.9 percent peak inJanuary and March. -South Bend Tribune

Rudolf Fischer, owner ofthe Publick House Restaurant, filed the suit Tuesday against Ethel Kennedy who arranged an elaborate seven-course dinner following the rehearsal for the wedding of her son Bobby Kennedy Jr. to Emily Black last April. Fischer charged in the lawsuit filed in Monroe Superior Court that Mrs. Kennedy still owed $7,200 for the party for 77 guests. The menu for the dinner included filet of sole, Chateaubriand of beef tenderloin, fresh asparagus, and champagne. -AP 

Rejecting a $1.5 billioncounter-offer by the Martin Marietta Corporation, Bendix Corp. Chairman William Agee vowed that the Southfield, Mich.-based firm will continue its effort to merge with the Maryland company. "We are determined to push our trans­action through to completion," Agee said in a statement released Tuesday in Detroit. Members ofthe board who were present at Tues­day's meeting in New York also unanimously recommended that shareholders of Bendix reject the Martin Marietta made Monday, Agee said. The merger action began last Wednesday when Bendix, a supplier for the aerospace, electronic and automobile industries, an­nounced its intention to merge with Martin Marietta of Bethesda, Md. But late Monday, following a special directors meeting in New York, Martin Marietta's 14-member board authorized company ex­ecutives to launch a 175 a share offer for 11.9 million shares, or 50.3 percent of Bendix outstanding common.

That phase ofthe takeover attempt would be worth 1649 million, bringing the total value ofthe transaction to S1.5 billion. ­

Joe Frank Harris, a Georgia legislator for 18 years, brushed aside charges he would be a puppet for the powerful house speaker and defeated a better-financed opponent for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.

Spread a little sunshine 
He sat alone shivering in the cold grey of that early 
August morning. Wearing only a pair of too-short 
polyester pants to protect himself from the numbing 
wind, he scavenged a cardboard box from a nearby 
garbage can and, after opening the bottom and top ofit 
with his fragile hands, fit the box over his head and 
brought it down around his narrow shoulders. The box 
covered only his shoulders and sunken chest, but it 
provided a moment of warmth and solace for this des­
titute man. 
He would remain sitting there all day and ]probably through much of the night, just as he had for the pre­vious four days. As he sat there against the marble foundation of that deserted office building at One Times Square on West 42nd Street, he crossed his arms underneath the box and allowed himself a slight smile at his own ingenuity. As the well-dressed busi111ess men and women rushed past, each stole a glance at this pat­hetic sight before scurrying on to their all-important jobs. No one stopped to give him money, or a j:1cket, or anything. I was one ofthose people. 
Further east on 42nd, near the corner of 5th Avenue, a woman stood in the middle of the sidewalk. From a distance, she might have passed for any other middle­class woman in her early 40's, but as one neared this sole stationary being on the bustling sidewalk, her per­sona exuded a much dif­ferent message. Her face was streaked with the dirt and grime of the streets, gar­nered from sleepless nights spent on the hard, grimy floor of Grand Cental Sta­
tion. Wrinkles lined her toughened skin, and accen­tuated her gaunt and drawn face. Long and unkempt grey hair dropped limply around her hunched shoulders. Several layers of clothing, probably her only posses­sions, hung from her frail and bent body. But perhaps the most telling aspect of this poor lady were her eyes; dark and mournful, so full of sadness and despair that one could not even imagine the terrible tragc:dies that had befullen her troubled life. 
She remained in that same spot hour after hour, a meek, gentle figure in a land of harshness and hostility. With her bony hands clenched in front ofher, lihoulders hunched so high as to make her neck disappear, and wearing a look ofyoung innocence, she appeared more like a little child expecting to be struck by an angry parent than a a middle-aged woman begging for sur­vival. 
In a soft voice full ofsadness and just a touch ofhope, she asked, "Change? ... quarters? ... dimes? ... nick­els? ... " each one a pleading question. 
Instead of crying for h..:r, or even giving he1r some of the loose change I had jingling in my pocket, I followed the lead ofeveryone else. I averted my eyes and rushed past. 
Near 3rd Avenue, an elderly Oriental man l~ty uncon­scious in front of a card store. Just a minute before he had been feebly making his way west along the sidewalk, hugging the gargantuan buildings in an at­tempt to protect himself from the threatening hordes that rushed past. Then suddenly, he clutched his chest and dropped to the ground He lay on his side, his mouth open, eyes shut. His body didn't so much as quiver as he lay there dying. 


As one man approached the fullen form, he nervously checked the time on his expensive digital watch and then stepped over the outstretched leg of the victim. Another one made a wide circle around the man and continued on his way. As I neared the scene, a couple of people stopped and checked for the man's pulse or any other sign of life. I couldn't stop. There was nothing I could do. 
As I strode by the old man, I heard the voice of one of those who had stopped: "Somebody call 911. I think he's dead." 
I tried hard to swallow the lump in my throat. 
I still feel the sadness every time I think of those incidents and how I fuiled to help when the opportunity presented itself so dramati­cally. Unfortunately, I fear that many of us have been guilty of this same inaction at one time or another. 
Every day of our lives we are called to help others, whether it be a destitute person in the big city or a 
\ roommate who needs a friendly shoulder to lean on. 
It certainly doesn't take a special person to help others. Anyone can do it, but often times we fuil. All it takes is a little bit ofpatience and understanding. Then maybe we can all bring a small ray of sunlight into a world that is all too often darkened by the harshness of our human existence.

4,050 arrested 

-Two die in Polish protest 
WARSAW, Poland (AP)-Manial law authorities said yesterday that riot police killed two demonstrators and arrested 4,050 in putting down Poland's biggest outbreak of violence under manial law. They promised "no leniency" for those behind the unrest that swept a dozen cities. 
Authorities in Gdansk also dis-­covered the body of a 22-year-old man with head wounds "in the region of disturbances" Tuesday called by Solidarity on the suspended independent union's second anniversary. 
The English-language service of the official news agency PAP said the man "may have been another casualty" of the protests and that an investigation was under way. 
The wife of interned Solidarity 
chief Lech Walesa told reporters in 
Gdansk after visiting her husband 
that he opposed street rioting but 
felt workers should fight authorities 
with "appropriate measures." She 
did not elaborate. 
Solidarity's underground leaders 
called for the anniversary 
demonstrations and said they were a 
test of whether the union still had 
broad support. 
Poland's martial law chief and 
Communist Party leader, Gen. 
Wojieh Jaruzelski, met with his 
Military Council of National 
Redemption and issued a series of 
law-and-order decrees, the state 
television said. 
They included: 
•prompt action on investigations against dissidents from the Commit­tee for Social Self-Defense, a key ad-
the United States. 
"Mexico does not accept any 
scheme that would restrict the con­
stitutional freedom ofall inhabitants 
to transit or leave Mexico," he said. 
"There are no walls here. The 
_ visory group to Soliduity, -and indictments "for offenses com­mitted again~t the ~t~t~ an_c:! ~iety." 


•speedy 
prosecution of people detained for participating in riots. 

• 
Appropriate "resolute" steps by provincial leaders to "ensure peace and public order." The com­munique, read by a uniformed military announcer, did not elaborate. 


Telephone service was cut in Wroclaw, Lubin -where the two demonstrators were killed -and the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, and direct dialing between cities suspended again, the Communica­tions Ministry announced yesterday. _Direct intra-city dialing was cut when the crackdown began last 
December and restored in May. 
Warsaw's governor, Gen. Miec­zyslaw Debicki, held a meeting of the Warsaw pr~v_incial defens~ com­
mtttee and declared "no Iefiiency will be shown to the organizers and participants of(Tuesday's) riots." 
President Reagan condemned the use offorce in Poland. "These events once again point up the need for reconciliation and restoration by the government of basic human rights in Poland," White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes told reporters in Santa Bar­bara, Calif 
"He (Reagan) desply regrets and condemns the use ofdeadly force to break up peaceful demonstrations in Warsaw and other cities on Solidarity's second anniversary," Speakes said. 
He said Reagan believes the two demonstrators killed in the south­west city ofLubin "can only serve to deepen the aiready extensive chasm separating Polish authorities from the Polish people."

Ek>ston reporter jailed f•Jr refusal to testify 
HOSTON (AP) -A reporter found in contempt ofcourt for refus­ing to testify in a murder trial was hopingfor astay from a U.S. Supreme Court justice or a pardon from the governor after spending his first night behind bars. 
Govenor Edward}. King promised Tuesday to "review the case thoroughly" today and consider at­torney Thomas C. Troy's request for a p:udon for Paul W. Corsetti. The Bos.ton Herald American reporter was returned to jail Tuesday evening to serve a 90-day.sentence. 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Wil­liam C. BrennanJr. could still grant a request for a delay ofthe sentence. 
Corsetti, 33, was returned to jail Tuesday night after a 24-hour delay -granted Monday by a state Supreme Court Justice -passed with no word from Brennan. 
A.sked if he had ever considered givilng in, Corsetti said, "No. I never changed my mind. I believe what I did was right." 
Cotsetti was citeo for criminal contempt in March 1981 after refus­ing to testify at a pre-trial hearing in the case ofEdward R Kopaczjr., 21, of Lowell, who was accused of mur­der. Corsetti had written a story saying Kopacz, wno was later ac­quitted, had admitted a role in the slaying. 
Corsetti said he refused to testify about the interview because he had promised not to disclose the con­versation in court. He contended that two police officers had the same information anyway. 
He was jailed after the state Board of Pardon and Parole turned down his request for parole or a reduction in sentence. The board, which is ad­visory, also recommended that King not grant a pardon. 
Year-long 
•


recess1on may end 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A new sign ofa nearing end to the year-long recession appeared Tuesday when the government reported that its main barometer of future economic activity jumped 1.3 percent in July, its fourth consecutive gain. 
Those recent increases in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators -after 11 months of declines -should mean recovery from the recession before long if the index is performing as designed. 
Both government officials and private economists reacted positive­ly to the new figure, saying overall national economic activity should be increasing substantially by the October-December quarter. 
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said such broad activity ­as measured by inflation-adjusted gross national product is "unlikely to show much change" for the current July-September period Private economist Michael K. Evans said real GNP probably is actually declining in this quarter. 
However, Baldrige said, "I believe the leading index and the recent sharp drop in interest rates are paving the way for solid economic improvement." He hailed the new report as "encouraging evidence that economic recovery is about to get under way." 
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist 
for the National A.ssociation of 
Manufacturers, had much the same 
comment, saying the new report 
"provides further evidence that 
we're on the road to economic 
recovery." 
Jasinowski said he was concerned by one index category that showed businesses' liquid assets declining in July -a sign, he said, that "business continues to face a cash squeeze." 
But mainstream economists now generally agree that at least modest recovery is close at hand -if not already here.

they have not reached the status of first -class officers." 
Terry explained that one reason for allowing officers to be armed is that the expansion of the Notre Dame campus has caused greater concern for protecting valuable property from theft. 
"We have identified our expan­sion, including the addition of the new Credit Union, the Snite Museum, and the WNDU station, as an added vulnerability," Terry stated. 
··we had to develop a long-range plan in order to have trained people who can cope with potential problems." 
In addition to some patrol officers being armed, there are other situa­tions, such as football games, in which there might be several armed guards, Terry said. . 
"There is the further possibility that on other occasions, with a con­siderable amount of control, we could conceivably have officers serving special requests of other agencies," he added. For example, groups that have events at Stepan Center and have previously hired 
county police officers might employ 
Notre Dame security officers in the 
future. 
Terry also said that the Security 
Department has been training inves­
tigators who might be using con­
cealed weapons, subject to his 
approval and that of Dean Roemer 
and others in the Administration. 
When The Obseroer first con­
tacted Roemer fur a statement on 
the issue earlier this week, he said he 
was unaware ofany security officers 
carrying guns. According to Terry, 
Roemer issued a policy in 1977 for 
the Security Department limiting 
the number ofpersonnel who could 
be armed to the Security Director, 
the Shift Commander, and his relief. 
"While there were some discus­sions in between, I don't think it was ever spelled out to the point that he (Roemer) was !lWare of my utiliza­tion offirst-class officers who would have the use of weapons," Terry stated. 
"It was going to be a subject ofdis-


LastPLO contingent leaves early 

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)-The last PLO contingent evacuated west Beirut yesterday to the machine-gun salutes of leftist comrades, and Lebanon's prime minister quickly ordered armed militiamen off the streets so the capital could return to 
normal 
The pullout -forced by the Is­raeli invasion -came two days ahead of schedule and signaled an end to the PLO's 12-year reign as a 
state within a state in Lebanon. 

President Reagan said the 800 U.S. Marines in the multinational peacekeeping force will withdraw from Lebanon "within two weeks." 
cussion before school started, but the timing just did not allow it." He said that the current policy now has Roemer's approval. 
Another area of the department's expansion involves the purchase of two new Dodge Diplomats. The pur­chase was based on a five-year plan submitted to Thomas Mason, Vice President for Business Affairs, Terry said. 
"In addition, we disposed of one car, the old Chevrolet station wago.n. We are going to keep the old Ford as a spare, and we hope :>ometime in the next few months to have the pick-up fixed so that it looks a liule better," he added. 
Overall, Terry feel!> mat the security staffs skill in h;mdling cases is improving. "We feel that we do a sufficient amount of training so that our people can cope with problems better," he stated. 
Commenting on whether more off-campus students are living in high-crime areas, Roemer said he did not get surveys of where high-
Security Dept.'s firearm policy dates from 1977 
dY KELLI HINT 
Executive News Editor 
Qualified Notre Dame security personnel have been able to carry firearms since 1977. 
During that year, the Board of Trustees voted to declare the Notre Dame security department a police agency. This decision enabled the department to authorize official police officers to carry arms. 
Assistant Security Director Rex Rakow said Security Chief Glenn Terry, along with University offi­cials, spent two days reclarifying the firearms policy. Copies ofthe policy have not been released. 
Dean of Students James Roemer assured that there would be no changes in the existing firearms policy. Roemer, along with Vice­President for Student Affairs Father 
. John Van Wolvlear, worked with Terry on restructuring the policy. 
Rakow recited the department's written firearms policy. "A firearm is used only to protect the life ofan of­ficer or somebody else," he said, "and only when all other means have been exhausted." 
When Rakow and Terry joined the Security Department in 1979, they began sending personnel to the police training academy in Indiana. 
"Officers go through 10 weeks of extensive academy training," Rakow said. "Training includes not only firearms but patrolling and other means to maintain the safest pos­sible campus." 
The department is staffed by about 49 personnel. Rakow said of these 49, 14 are authorized because of training with power of arrest to carry arms. "Terry and myselfcount for two ofthese," Rakow noted. 
Rakow said there are not ap­preciably more security personnel bearing weapons. "There are now more with the trai_11ing behind them to authorize them to do so. 
. .. Guns 

crime areas are in the city. 
"My gut reaction is that, if the statistics were available, students wouldn't pay attention. 
"I don't think they would base their decision about housing on what someone says about a par­ticular area." 
Terry said the department has no plans to patrol the Campus View area. 
"Campus View is in the county, and it is the responsibility of the Sheriff's department to handle any security problems there. It is not within our jurisdiction." 
Terry suggested that students living off-campus take some precau­tions oftheir own. 
"They ought to have dead-bolt locks and make sure that they are furnished as part ofthe contract." 
He also suggested that students consider investing in one of the more sophisticated alarm systems. In addition, Terry said he hopes that students on campus will cooperate in lessening the potential for crime. 

''Not all of the 14 will carry weapons at all times," he said. "Unless there are specific problems, the only personnel carrying weapons will be those in mobile uni­
ts." 
As of today, there will no longer be armed security officers in the Athletic and Convovation Center. Officers bearing weapons had been patrolling the building since July, 1981. "The University decided it was not needed," Rakow said.

United States imposes sales bans 
THE TAMIN6 ElF THE SHREW

WASHINGTON (AP) -The 
Reagan administration is ready to 
impose penalties on a British com­
pany that plans to ship pipeline 
equipment manufactured with U.S. 
technology to the Soviet Union. 
A Soviet freighter in the port of 
Glasgow, Scotland began Tuesday to 
load 500 crates of turbine parts 
produced by the John Brown 
Engineering C. of Glasgcow. The 
parts are intended for use in the 
trans-Siberian natural gas pipeline to 
Western Europe. 
State Department spokesman John Hughes said here that "measured" and "appropriate" punitive action will be taken by the Commerce Department against John Brown as soon as legal deter­mination is made that the parts have been shipped, even though the ex­act nature ofthe penality remains to be determined. 
In California, White House deputy 
press secretray Larry Speakes said no 
decision has been made about what 
action would be taken against the 
British firm. 

He said Commerce Secretray Mal­
com Baldrige and Secretary of State 
George Shultz in Wasington talked 
with national security adviser Wil­
liam P. Clark in Santa Barbara by 
telephone Tuesday. 
The State Department said the form ofthe penalty will be simllar to the temporary denial orders issued last we•~k againsto tw French firms after thiey obeyed French govern­ment mders to ship compressors to the Soviet Union for use on the pipelin•e. 
The two companies were tem­porarily banned from buying U.S. produc1ts and technology. 
The Washington Post andLosAn­geles Times reported yesterday that the administration will impose only limited sanctions on theJohn Brown company. The New York Times said senior ~tdministration official recom­mended to Reagan that the sanction should be softened and should be the same for all nations defying the embargo. CBS News said the sanc­tions would be less severe against 
John Brown, and that the sanctions 
against the French companies would 
be lessened. 
John Brown has been told by 
British  Prime  Minister  Margaret  
Thatcher  to  ignore  the  American  
ban.  

In Glasgow, port officials said loading of the turbines including parts made by the General Electric Corp., is expected to take four days. 
President Reagan wants pipeline construction stopped or slowed to bring pressure on the Soviets be­cause oftheir support for martial law in Poland, to prevent Western Europe from becoming overly de­pendent on Soviet energy, and to deprive the Soviets of SI0 billion in hard Western currency the pipeline is expected to earn annually.

danian association with those ter­ritories. The accord urged Jordan's King Hussein to enter the negotia­tions, but he never was willing. 
The proposals faced virtually cer­tain rejection by the government of Menachem Begin and there was no indication how King Hussein would view tllis effort to bring him into the· peace JProcess. 
Reagan said the American com­mitment to Israeli security "is ironclad," and departing from his releast:d text he added that he had followed Israel's struggle for sur­vival, recalling that the Jewish state once was only 10 miles wide in spots. "I am not about to ask Israel to live that way again," he said. 
The president interrupted his vacation and flew to Burbank to make the speech. 
Administration officials described 
the president's address as "a major 
new peace initiative." Reagan called 
for: 

•Full 
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist and security guarantees. 

•Linking 
Jordan with the ad­ministration of the West Bank, at least as an interim measure, but full Palestinian autonomv. 


The plan also asks for the im­mediate freeze on Israeli settle­ments in the .occupied territories, but does not call for dismantling any ofthem at this time.

Happiness can't come solely from others, and other things. It comes from ME. From my inside, from the heart. How? I believe that a most fundamental human wisdom is this: we are on this Earth to love. Now this all sounds a little mushy and even a little more vague (but not "uncool", damn it), so a more practical paraphrase is in order. Inner happiness is loving the people around us, in our minute­by-minute interactions with them, and as it applies to our situation in life whether we're doctors, teachers, ditch-diggers, cooks, or stu­dents. Fulfillment comes not from getting the job with the most status or money, but from finding the vocation which best permits us to use our talents and abilities to love others. 
Where do we find happiness? By making others happy! It becomes a very beautiful cycle. We love other people, and that makes us feel better about ourselves,so we show our love even more, which makes us feel even bet­ter abOut ourselves! Growing toward this kind of lifestyle means gaining a lot of things, the most important things in life: happiness, security, character, strength. It may also mean changing a lot of one's ways. But, it's not simple fighting, attempting to fulfill our urge for attention, and need for security in the ways that this capitalistic society can lead us to believe. 
That people may not be as happpy as they can be here is my concern. People are all so wonderful because we have the potential to love: ifthat potential is not being realized in so many cases it is to me the greatest of human wastes. We at Notre Dame, young, intelligent, and hard working, have so much ofthis poten­tial. Let's not waste it!

Besides sharing in the excitement that comes from the start of another school year, I have the pleasure of beginning my first column. The start ofthis new year ofgreat ex­periences will also be the ·start of this column's consideration of some very impor­tant, philosophical questions, "How can I be happy?" and "What good is faith?" These two similar questions may strike one at first as being too subjective, too broad or even too "square" for any kind of interesting, relative discussion.

So anyone who is to deal with these types of questions must feel he can do so in a manner that is practical, sensible, and easy to under­stand. Whether you will agree or disagree with what you will read, I hope to at least provoke some insightful and clarifying thought. · 
The following is an article that appeared in the December 10, 1981 edition of The Bat­talion, at Texas A&M University, which I think can best introduce you to me and my style ofwriting. 
You won't read very many letters like the one you are about to read. It is written about people and our happiness, subjects usually not encountered or treated too directly by us. The author is someone whose efforts are prompted by the beauty he sees in people. So whether you agree or disagree with what he has to say, at least know that he feels he's ac­tin~ "because he cares." 
One of the most basic feelings we have is the need to be wanted. To the extent that man is a social creature, we need to feel from others that we're living a good life. As an ex­ample: in a crowd, isn't --there a sort of deep pull to be a part of the fun and excite­ment?-And how do we-resond to those feelings? Although we don't ever totally get rid of our insecurities, true happiness comes from realizing from where and how security is obtained. 
The environment is our American, capitalis­tic society. In representing American busi­ness, and how consumer oriented businesses make their money, I'd like to talk about advertising propaganda and television. 
People working in the advertising depart­ments of our big consumer corporations are smart guys. They realize of course that in or­der to sell something, they must create and appeal to a need. What better need to appeal to than the same very basic human need to have others know we're living a good, happy life? 
Take a minute and think about television 
commercials: "After all, life is worth living, so 
buy a Buick," "Uve in Brittania," or "Have a 
Coke and a smile!" (Wouldn't it be more 
realistic to say, "Have a Coke and a burp?") 
Here are we insecure, searching people 
trying to live happy 11ves, and we are constant­
ly being bombarded with these kinds of 
advertising ploys: "Buy this and be happy," 
"Buy that and be sexually fulfilled," and "So 
and so's pregnant withJohn's baby!" 
People are wonderful creatures, but many 
in this country are cought up in believing that 
much or most oftheir happiness, and sense of 
Oil:· going,. going, gone 

It isn't the kind ofcause that Jane Fonda or Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell would take on, but someone ought to try to talk all of us into driving our cars less. We spend too much time going places that aren't any better to be in than where we were. We just can't wait to go in the car because we have never given up the dream that there's something wonderful going on somewhere else.

I know I waste more time driving than ony other way. Saturday afternoon I often take a nap after lunch and I've had the guilty feeing that it's doing nothing, but a little nap doesn't compare with a drive when it comes to was­ting time. I don't think twice about getting in the car and spending twice the time I'd spend napping in driving to a hardware store to buy glue. I know I have some glue in the house somewhere, but I'd rather get in the car and drive than look for it. 
Leaving home, driving along a road and then arriving at a destination gives us a false sense ofaccomplishment. Usuallly we haven't really done anything but bum gas. If I was careful and limited my driving to the times it was important for me to get somewhere, I bet I'd spend less than half the time on the road that I spend now. 
None ofus can imagine what the world will be like without me. I'm always wondering how things will be most different in 100 years when none of us is around. I suppose the big­gest change will be brought about by the fact that people will be doing without gas and oil. There won't be any left, so they'll have to do without. 
The biggest business in the world is oil. Fortune magazine lists the 500 biggest cor­porations in the United States and Exxon is at the head of the list. This week, Exxon an­nounced it's closing 850 gas stations. Do you think that is the first, faraway, cold wind in­dicating the end ofoil? I do. 
Exxon says that the demand for oil is level­ing off, but it's leveling off because it's getting more expensive as it gets scarce. There can be a temporary glut of oil because they've pumped too much out of the ground, but those pools of oil under us are going, going, going. They aren't oceans, they're just pools. 
Exxon has 20,500 gas stations across the country, so losing 850 doesn't mean Exxon's going out of business. But when a big, smart corporation starts cutting back like that, it's not just because it's tired of washing windshields. 
We're using less gas because our cars are lighter and their engines are more efficient. It's a good thing, too, because the actual 
gasoline wr buy at the pump is not as good as it w~ 10 years ago. A gallon of unladed 91 octane gas will push a car designed to use it about 7 percent further than unleaded gas that is only 87 octane. The gas of 10 years ago that was often as high as 96 or 97 octane, with lead in it, would push a car 14 percent further than the cheapest unleaded regular you can buy today. 
The handwriting is on the gas station wall. Closing 850 Exxon stations is only the begin­ning. There are still more than 150,000 gas stations around the country and you can bet a lot ofthem will be closing in the next 2 5 years. Starting a campaign to encourage all of us to drive less may not be necessary. The cars will just keep getting lighter and lighter, smalller and smaller and more efficient, but gasoline will get more and more expensive and there'll be fewer and fewer places to buy it. 
And then there won't be any way for me to waste time Saturday afternoon except by taking a nap.

Unless you have been in a comatose state for the past few months you are well aware of the Israeli invasion ofLebanon. I find it ironic that the world continues to allow Israel to use military force as its sole local foreign policy. The airstrike in Iraq and the siege ofBeirut are unmistakeable acts of aggression. The W es­tern world may verbally condemn the Jewish state for its actions, but if the great powers truly wanted to put a halt to the obliteration, they would have stopped vital shipments of arms and other aid long ago. 


Randyfahs 

Thursday analy~ 
The world seems to feel guilty for the per­secution of the Jews in the past, especially during the Holocaust which nearly wiped them out as a people. Unfortunately, the world seems to have missed the fact that the Palestinian refugees, especially those who survived the Beirut seige, are suffering in a way that mirrors the suffering of the Jews, a people who were kicked out of their homeland and have been subject to violent at­tacks and persecution for four thousand years. 
It is tragically ironic that the Jews, who suf­fered so many hardships for centuries as they longed to return to their homeland, could be so cruel and unsympathetic to the plight of 
the Palestinian people. Clearly this is the case as can be witnessed by the destruction in Lebanon and the close diplomatic ties that the Israelis keep with the racist and oppressive regime ofSouth Africa 
I am not granting absolution to the PLO for its terrorist activities, but I would like to paint out that the Palestinians have replaced the Jews at the top of the list ofdisplaced people. -­The Western world made a grievous mistake when it failed to provide an adequate solution to the Palestinian problem when it created Is­rael in 1948. It is an error that is being repaid with blood and misery. 
You may feel that the expulsion ofthe PLO from Lebanon will quiet things in the Middle East, but the situation will again heat up as the PLO guerillas regroup in the eight nations which have now become their homes. The Jews should take a lesson from their own past which shows that the tougher you make it for a particular national group, the stronger and more resilient they will ultimately become. No amount offorce or distance will quell the longings of the Palestinians for a homeland of their own. As one of my neighbors so elo­quently pointed out to me, ''You can never kill 
an idea with a bullet." Unfortunately, many more bullets will fly, and many more people will die before peace finally comes to the Middle East.

However, only 63 berths were decided before darkness halted play last night. Thirteen players, tied at 152, will play off for the one remain­ing berth in the match competition early today. 
Lewis quit the pro tour after three

Gerulaitis, Clerc upset 
NEW YORK (~t') -Upsets 
knocked out two of the top players 
from the men's ranks yesterday, 
while defending women's champion 
Tracy Austin crushed Catherine 
Tavier of France in opening-round 
matches at the U.S. Open Tennis 
Championships. 
Second-seeded Jimmy Connors took a first-set tiebreaker 7-5 en route to defeating]effBorowiak 7-6, 6-2,6-3. 
In night matches, the tourna­ment's top seeds,John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova made their 1982 debuts at the National Tennis 
Center. 
Fritz Buehning ousted fifth­seeded Vitas Gerulaitis 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 and Kim Warwick of Australia eliminated No. 7 jose Luis Clerc of Argentina 3-6, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1, 7-6, while Austin was beating Tan vier 6­2, 4-1 when the 17-year-old French woman twisted her right ankle and couldn't continue. 
In the fifth-set tiebreaker, War­wick took the opening point, break­ing Clerc with a cross-court backhand service return. He raced to a 4-0 lead, breaking Clerc again when the Argentine's cross-court forehand was called wide. 
Clerc won the next point, before 
Warwick volleyed a winner and hit a 
service winner. That gave the 
Australian a 6-1 lead. Clerc won the 
next two points, the second with an 
ace, but Warwick closed out the 
match 7-3 when Clerc netted a back­
hand. 

The world's richest tournament, the U.S. Open will distribute more than n .5 million in prize money, with the winners of the men's and women's singles collecting 590,000 each. 
Buehning broke the flamboyant Gerulaitis in the opening game, racing to a ,3-1 lead. But the blond New Yorker won the next two games, breaking Buehning in the sixth game and tying the score 3-3 before the match was delayed for 75 minutes by rain. 
When they returned to the center court in louis Armstrong Stadium, Buehning broke Gerulaitis' service again, then served out the set. 
The two battled through the second set, each losing serve once, before going into the tiebreaker. Buehning, ranked 56th in the world 
on the Association of Tennis Profes­sionals computer, won 7-4, giving him a 2-0 lead over Gerulaitis. 
Austin never took off her sweater in the chilly, windy weather that followed the rain. And Tanvier didn't put any pressure on this year's No. 3 seed -who is seeking her third U.S. Open singles title.

Because ofthe rain, 12 first-round matches scheduled to be played on the outer courts were postponed until today, including fifth-seeded Hana Mandlikova ofCzechoslovakia, the runner-up here in 1980, against Australian Sue Leo and No. 16 Zina Garrison, the 1981 U.S. Open junior girls champion, against Michaela Pazderova ofCzechoslovakia 
Martina Navratilova had no problems downing Laura DuPont in her opening round match ofthe U.S. Open tennis championships last night, but defending champion john McEnroe's match with Tim Gullik­son was plagued by a power outage and rain and was delayed until Thursday. 
The McEnroe-Gullikson match, which was tied 3-3 in the first set, was halted when a bank of lights on the east side of the National Tennis Center's Louis Armstrong Stadium went out. Twenty-five minutes later, as electricians worked to restore the lights, it began raining and the match was postponed. 
Earlier, Navratilova weathered a 17-minute rain delay as she took on­ly 44 minutes to trample DuPont 6­L6-1.

Baseball pennant races heat up 



Kansas City stays close . .. Los Angeles toppled ... Phi/lies, Rose falter . .. 
By The Associated Press 
In the American League, the con­tenders stayed within striking dis­tance ofeach other, as the top teams in the east all won, and the two leaders in the west both lost. No­
thing is close to being settled, espe­cially given a schedule that has Milwaukee playing Boston and Bal­timore -in second and third, respectively -13 times before the season closes. 
In Detroit, Alan Trammell drove in three runs with a two-run triple and a squeeze bunt last night as the Detroit Tigers defeated the Califor­nia Angels 5-3. 
Detroit starter Milt Wilcox, 9-7, who was reactivated from the disabled list on Aug. 9, allowed nine hits in 8 2-3 innings. He struck out six and walked two. Pat Underwood retired Rod Carew for the final out with runners on first and second in the top of the ninth to record his third save. 
Lou Whitaker put Detroit in front 1-0 in the first inning when he hit the first pitch from California starter Ken Forsch, 11-10, for his 12th homer ofthe year. 
In the second, Howard Johnson led off with a single and scored on Tom Brookens's one-out triple.' Brookens came in on Trammell's squeeze bunt. Johnson and Enos Cabell walked 
in the seventh and both scored on Trammell's two-out triple. 
But the Angels didn't lose any ground in their race to keep pace with the division-leading Royals. Texas rookie Mike Smithson tossed a six-hitter for his first major-league victory as he pitched the Rangers to a 7-3 win over Kansas City in a game that featured a near-brawl. 
Smithson, 1-1, hit Frank White in the elbow leading off the third and struck Amos Otis in the back of the batting helmet later in the inning. The Rangers were up by five runs when Otis came to bat in the sixth. On three successive swings, Otis' bat went flying -into the seats be­hind the Texas dugout, and twice in­to shallow left field. 
As plate umpire Mark Johnson thumbed Otis out of the game, both benches and bullpens emptied onto the field but no punches were 
thrown. 
White, after taking one swing in the fourth, took himself out of the game with a severe bruise where the pitch hit him. 
George Wright hit an inside-the­park homer in the third inning following a Bucky Dent single as Texas took a 2-0 lead. It was Wright's seventh homer and came off loser Paul Splittorff, 9-8. 
At Comiskey Park meanwhile. left­bander Jerry Koosman fired a four­hitter, leading the Chicago White Sox to a 6-Q. victory over Cleveland, sending the Indians to their seventh straight loss, and pulling is team to within 7 games ofKC. 
Koosman, 7-6, allowed a bunt single to Carmen Castillo in the third inning, singles to Chris Bando and Jerry Dybzinski in the eighth and pinch-hitter Rodney Craig's single in the ninth. It was Koosman's 30th shutout in his 15-year career. He 
struck out seven and walked two. 
Chicago broke a scoreless tie with four runs after there were two outs in the sixth inning. 
Greg Luzinski started the rally with a double off Cleveland starter Lary Sorensen, 10-11. Steve Kemp followed with a single to center to score Luzinski. 
Singles by Carlton Fisk and Mike Squires produced another run. Vance Law was then intentionally walked to load the bases and Aurelio Rodriguez rapped a two-run single to right. 
In the Eastern Division, Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor slammed two-run homers to power the Mil­waukee Brewers to a 7-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners. 
Milwaukee starter Doc Medich, 10-11, allowed five hits in e t ight in­nings and Jim Slaton retired Seattle on two hits in the ninth. Medich is now 3-0 since the Brewers purchased him from Texas on Aug. 
11. He walked five and struck out a season-high seven batters as he boosted his career record over the Mariners to 12-1. 
Manny Casilo singled, Richie Zisk walked and both scored when AI Cowens lined a triple over the head ofGorman Thomas in center field to put the Mariners ahead 2-0 in the first inning. 
The B.-ewers came back with three runs in their half of the first against Mike Stanton, 2-4, who made his first start since I975. Jim Beattie, the Mariners' scheduled starter, was scratched because of a sore right shoulder. 
And the two teams chasing the Brewers hung in there as well. Bal­timore downed Toronto 5-2 in the league's only afternoon game to remain five games out offirst. 
The Red Sox are four games out, thanks to Carney Lansford, who homered, doubled and drove in two. 
runs to pace Boston to a 7-4 victory over the Oakland A's in a game delayed for an hour and 1 5 minutes by rain. 
Boston starter Brian Denman, 2-1, gave up only four hits over five in­nings and was removed after the rain delay, which came with une out in the bottom of the sixth. Mark Clear, the third Boston pitcher, went the final two innings to pick up his 13th save. 
With the score tied 2-2 in the sixth, Dave Stapleton doubled, stole third and after a walk to Gary Allen­son, scored on Jerry Remy's single. 

The game was then delayed by rain. 
When play resumed in the sixth, Rice delivered a run-scoring single offreliever Bob Owchinko, 2-4, who relieved starter Steve McCatty after five innings. Carl Yastrzemski, who had earlier singled to become only the second player to get 100 hits in 21 seasons, then singled again to score Remy for a 5-2 lead. Hank Aaron also got 100-plus hits in 21 seasons. 
Lansford's ninth homer leading off the second gave Boston a 1-0 lead. The Red Sox made it 2-0 in the fourth on a fielding error by first baseman Wayne Gross. 
Dwayne Murphy singled in the top of the sixth and Mitchell Page followed with his fourth homer of the year to make it 2-2.

Grooms returns for football 
By DAPHNE BAILLE 
Sports Writer 
Guess who's back? 

Quarterback Scott Grooms has 
returned to Notre Dame after having 
spent a semester at Miami University 
ofOhio. 

Grooms left Notre Dame at the end of the 1981 fall semester in or­der to fulfill his ambition to play col­lege football. With Tim Koege·l and Blair Kiel sharing the quarterback­ing duties last season, Grooms was not seeing much playing time. A transfer to Miami seemed to be ti-t solution to his problem. 
"At that time, I wanted to go where I could play two years offoot­ball," exlains the 6-3, 200 lb. junior. "It wasn't that I didn't likt: this school or the atmosphere as a stu­dent. I wanted to play football, and I also felt a little obligation to my fami­ly and friends who also wanted to see me play." 
The Greenfield, Ohio native dis­cussed his departue plans with his coaches here and received mixed reactions. While none of the coaches wanted to see him leave, some agreed that perhaps it was the best course for Grooms to follow. 
"I had lost my confidence by not 
playing here," recalls Grooms. "I 
wanted to go to a smaller school 
where I'd be almost sure ofplaying." 
Grooms chose Miami becaus·e of its 
football tradition and good 
academic reputation, and also partly 
because his younger brother would 
be there this year. 

Once Grooms arrived at Miami, 
the reception was only lukt:warm. 
The student body and coaching staff 
were happy to welcome a blue-chip 
quarterback, but the team rt:action 
Further west, Gary Gaetti and Kent Hrbek each knocked in a pair of runs and AI Williams hurled a six­hitter to lead the Minnesota Twins to a 7-2 victory over the New York Yankees in the Metrodome last night. 
Gaetti's two-run triple and Hrbek's two-run double highlighted Minnesota's 15-hit attack against four New York pitchers. Yankee starter Dave Righetti, 8-7, took the loss. 
AI Williams, 6-7, was rocked for a 425-foot first-inning solo homer by Jerry Mumphrey, but had little trouble after that. 
Mickey Hatcher led off the Min­nesota third with a single and went to second when Dave Righetti's pickoff attempt was wild. John Cas­
was more reserved. Some of the players may have understandably felt resentment towards this athlete from Notre Dame. 
Regardless ofanybody's reactions, . Grooms set out to improve his playing skills. He began working out through quickness and weight programs, and then concentrated on spring ball. 
"I feel that I improved my quar­terbacking in the spring," reflects Grooms. "I tried to go out every day and concentrate on my passing, my release, and all aspects ofthe game. I wasn't working with the number 
Shiner injures knee, undergoes surgery 
Offensive guard Mike Shiner, al ready hampered by a broken thum he sufferred in last week's two-a-da} practice sessions, came up eve worse Tuesday. 
The 6-8, 262-lb. senior quic guard went down with partially tor ligaments in his knee during the af ternoon drills. The Sunnyvale, Calif native underwent arthroscopic sur gery on the knee at St. Joseph's Medi· cal Center yesterday morning. 
The full extent of the damage is unclear at this point, but doctor. believe Shiner will miss at lea<>t 4-5 weeks. That kind oftimetable woul see him returning after the secon or third game of the season.

"I missed Notre Dame," admit. Grooms. "I had a lot offriends here and realized that this is where should be, that this is where I wan to earn my degree. There's no doub that I made the right decision t( come back. So far it's been great t be back."

tino followed with a single, and Tom Brunansky bounced into a double play with Hatcher scoring. 
With two outs, Hrbek and Gary Ward singled and Gaetti tripled both home for a 3-1 Minnesota lead. 
The Twins added three more runs in the fourth. Bobby Mitchell and Lenny Faedo led with singles and Righetti gave way to reliever George Frazier. Mitchell scored when Hatcher reached base on third baseman Graig Nettles' error and Hrbek followed with a two-run double.
