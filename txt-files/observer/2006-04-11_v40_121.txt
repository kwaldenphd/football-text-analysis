Students scratnble for advisor appointtnents 
College ofArts and Letters reports difficulty accomodating flood of scheduling questions 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL News Writer 
As students scramble to put together class schedules for the fall semester, some advising offices on campus are so swamped that advisors are forced to turn away students seeking guidance before they rngister for classes next week. 
While the undergraduate advising office in the College of Arts and Letters had openings earlier this month, Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Letters Ava Preacher said sched­uling has become increasingly diiTieult since so many students are struggling to squeeze in last­minute meetings with their advi­sors. 
"Our priority is seeing stu­dents, so we try to see everyone who walks through the door," Preacher said. "There are only four of us in the office, though, so if we get a rush of students, we may simply run out oftime to· see them." 
About 45 percent of non-fresh­man undergraduates have majors in the College ofArts and Letters. Advisors try to pack every student into their sched­ules, but the large number of requests sometimes makes this impossible, Preacher said. 
The University's award-win­ning First Year of Studies (FYS) program has been ranked one of the best in the nation -pairing each first year student with an

College applicants break record 

By MOLLY LAMPING News Writer 
Saint Mary's received a record-breaking number of applications from high school seniors for the Class of 2010 with 1,159 students vying for a spot in the College's freshman class. And applications are still coming in. 
Saint Mary's has a rolling admissions policy, accepting stu­dents continuously as applica­tions are received. So far, 1,159 applications have been submit­ted to the Office of Admissions, Vice President of Enrollment Management Dan Brown said. 
The spike in applications rep­resents a 20 percent increase over last year's number and is the highest application total in 1 7 years, Brown said.

Writer criticizes 'DaVinci Code' 
By MAUREEN MULLEN 
News Writer 
Syndicated columnist and Catholic blogger Amy Welborn criticized bestselling novel "The Davinci Code" for depicting a version of Jesus Christ that is inconsistent with the Gospels during a lecture in DeBartolo Hall Monday. 
"The big theme of The DaVinci Code is that Christianity is the enemy to the truth," Welborn said. "But this is not new." 
In her lecture, titled "De­Coding DaVinci: The Fact Behind the Fiction of The DaVinci Code," Welborn explained that Dan Brown's

GPA of 3.7 on a 4.0 scale and 
average SAT score of 1185 out 
of a possible 1600, the College's 
incoming freshman class is very 
promising, Brown said. He said 
those numbers are relatively 
comparable to academic statis­
tics from previous years. 
"I hate defining 'best' by aver­

age GPA and SAT scores, but 
this class has exceeded expecta­
tions academically," Brown said. 
So far, 910 students have been 

admitted to the College and 340 
students have already commit­
ted to fall enrollment. 
"We don't have a wait list, per 

se," Brown said. "Our policy is to 
accept all qualified students. It 
usually works itself out." 
Brown is "very confident" that · numbers for the incoming class 
will reach 390 by mid-May, but

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Me111bers give ideas for LaFun 
Resolution proposes more storage, venues 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
The Campus Life Council 
(CLC) unanimously passed a resolution Monday recom­mending renovations for LaFortune Student Center as part of the Campus Master Plan, a 15-year plan developed in 2002 that calls for major improvements to various parts of campus. Zahm Hall senator Pat Knapp presented the pro­posal -drawn up by the Student Senate Committee on Residence Life -which called for improvements to the exist­ing social space, dining options, technological capabili­ties and storage space at LaFortune. 
"We conducted some focus groups to determine what stu­dents' needs were in all these areas," Knapp said. 
These focus groups allowed current students to reflect on what the purpose of a student center should be, while also discussing possible improve­ments or additions. 
"We recommend some 'action venues' in the future," Knapp said. "For example, a bowling alley. Some place that's really gender neutral, some place that involves more than sitting on a couch and watching TV." 
Knapp discussed improving the dining options at LaFortune by bringing in local South Bend restaurants to fill any future vacancies. The resolution men-

Mooney na111es final candidate for VP post 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's President Carol Ann Mooney has announced that Robert Lueger will be the third and final candidate in the search for the College's new vice president and dean of faculty. 
Lueger, a professor of psy­chology and former Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for the College of Arts and Sciences at Marquette University, is scheduled to address the College communi­ty during open forums April 
18 and 19. The scheduled times of the forums have not yet been announced by the College. 
Lueger's events at the College will mirror last week's open forums with the College's first two candidates -Saint Mary's religious stud­ies professor Joe Incandela and Dean of Faculty at Colgate College and Saint Mary's alumna, Jill Tiefenthaler.

Marcela

I saw a man on 
television saying Wire Editor 
hn didn't have a 
problem with immigrants as long as 
they entered the country legally. 
If this were the only misunderstand­
ing between him and my 5,000 friends 
yesterday, I wouldn't have worried as 
much, bncause there is a simple cure 
for ignorance. 
I could've just told this man there 
really is no legal action the undocu­
mented immigrants could've taken. 
I was born and raised in El Salvador, 
and I could tell him exactly what hap­
pens bPI1ind the walls of the U.S. 
Embassy down there. 
To do it thn bureaucratic-yet diplomatie way -the campesinos would have to open an account with onn of the banks afliliated with the Embassy, and pay a $100 deposit to set up an appointment four months into the future. 
The deposit does not guarantee a 
visa, though. 
The campesino-someone with a 40 percent chance of living blliow the poverty line -now needs to present his valid credit card, an employer statement, and receipts for promptly paid utilities in the last few months. 
Thn peasants I'm talking about live in rural areas, in houses made out of mud and clay, and the bus fare to the city, to the Embassy, is a luxury they cannot afl'ord. 
One hundred dollars is thus an 
insurmountable amount of money to 
thnm, and if thny were foolish enough 
to usn it to snt up an appointment at 
the Embassy, it would be money lost. 
It would bn a waste because every­body knows a campesino will never get a lngitimate visa, because every­body knows he cannot afl'ord an air­plane ticket or a hotel, and because everybody knows all the Embassy wants are tourists who can go to Disneyworld and spend $10 on a hot dog. 
They then brave the desert sun, and the roaring river, and most important­ly, the unwelcoming eyes, because at the end of the day, these are all things that a person can endure, unlike hunger and oppression. 
Yesterday, the immigrants and their friends walked under the sun again, without being scorched. 
Yesterday, 5,000 people, myself included, stepped outside in quiet har­mony, in sympathy with the millions of undocumented workers that face hos­tility in Congress. 
Across the nation, similar marches and nonviolent demonstrations took place, and as I watched the news at night-witnessing hope and a human rights movement bloom before my eyes-I concluded spring had just begun. 
The children yesterday were enjoy­ing the weather, unaware of the politi­eal unrest surrounding their parents. 
A little boy walking in front of me was nating cookies, and threw the wrapping on the floor. 
I lis Mnxican mother immediately scolded him, made him pick it up, and put it in hnr poeket. 

I felt like <:rying, because I wish that man on telnvision, and everybody in Washington could see things the way I do.

Alaskans get their pizza by air 
NOME, Alaska -Last Christmas, residents of the Yupik Eskimo village of Savoonga added a special dish to their everyday fare of whale, walrus, reindeer and berries -fresh pizza flown in from Nome, 170 miles away. 
A tiny delivery joint, Airport Pizza, opened several months earlier just steps from Nome's busy runways, and many of Savoonga's 700 residents were eager to try something differ­ent. 
Nome's first and only pizza delivery service does a robust busines.<; in the western Alaska town of 3,500. But it really stands out for its free deliver­ies via commuter plane to more than a dozen other remote, spread-out subarctic villages. 

The village council in Savoonga, on St. Lawrence Island in the icy Bering Sea, wanted a special holiday treat for young families in the vil­lage. It order.ed 50 pizzas, half topped with chicken and ranch dressing and the other half with Canadian bacon and pineapple.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group seeks to improve relations 
Shappell, Andrichik to present report to University Board ofTrustees 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL News Writer 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell focused Monday's Council of Representatives (COR) meeting on improving student/alumni relations in the upcoming year. 
Shappell and former student body president Dave Baron will travel to Washington D.C. May 4 
to present a report to the University Board of Trustees regarding their administration. Shappell asked COR for input to help prepare for their presentation and to begin the discus­sion on student/alumni relations. 
"This topic car­ries over to [student body vice president] Bill [Andrichik] and my administration," Shappell said. "It deals with the stu­
dent/alumni relationship that we're working to improve. We want to get more students on [the online alumni contact net­work] Golrish to get more in touch with alumni, and have receptions for football games." 
Senior class president Emily 
"Morrissey Manor had a reunion after a football game last fall that attracted 200 alumni, and the Alumni Center made that happen by supplying conact information. " 
Bryan Lowery Hall President Council co-chair 
Chin said while student/alumni connections often develop during junior and senior year -a time when students receive e-mails about working with alumni to get internships or to help with career options -she would suggest try­ing to connect earlier with underclassmen. 
Hall President Council (HPC) co-chair Bryan Lowery said dorms involve their own alumni in a number of ways, and the 
alumni relations," Lowery said. "It is not necessarily a priority for dorms to put someone in charge of alumni correspon­dence. But maybe a yearly newsletter for alumni to hear about what we've been up to could be beneficial." 
level of alumni involvement varies greatly by dorm. 
"Morrissey Manor had a reunion after a football game last fall that attracted 200 alumni, and the Alumni Center made that hap­pen by supplying contact informa­tion," Lowery said. 
"There are variances across the dorms for 

Junior class president Bridget Keating said the Golrish search engine made student/alumni relationships possible for organi­zations like the sailing club and Circle K service organization. She said she'd like the possibility of more clubs being able to take advantage of alumni connections. 
In other COR news: 
+COR confirmed John Bush as the Student Union Board (SUB) chief controller for the upcoming year. 
+Carolyn White was confirmed as co-director of SUB, effective next fall after her return from spring semester in London. 
+Steve Cartwright was con­firmed as a COR laison from VOICE, the student advisory board for the Center for Social Concerns. Cartwright promises to bring the perspective of the local community, since the esc relates closely with local leaders. 
"There are a number of issues, especially involving the commu­nity just beyond Notre Dame, that this group [COR] might be interested in," Cartwright said. "I might be able to bring to COR the issues community leaders bring forth as well as those of the Center."

Usually bntween 45 and 4 7 per­cent of student<; who are accepted to the College choose to attend. Because the applicant pool was so large this year, the danger of having too large a dass is a possi­bility, Brown said, although it is not probable. 
The reason for the increased application numbers could be credited to the new style of admissions at the College, Brown said. 
"We made the decision to visit fewnr high schools this year, but we did more follow-up work with students through phone calls, e­mail and instant messaging, try­ing to make the College more accessible to them," Brown said.

Faculty, administration and students will have the oppor­tunity to share their opinion of the candidates following the forum through the sub­mission of an evaluation form -a process that Mooney has deemed successful thus far. 
Although Mooney does not attend the forums and has yet that attendance is financially pos­sible for students. According to Brown, the total financial aid awarded to the class of 2010 in scholarships at this time is between $1.6 and $1.8 million. 

Incoming freshmen won't be the only new students at Saint Mary's in the fall. Numbers are also up for transfer applicants. Twenty-six percent more applica­tions have been turned in by potential transfer students than la<>t year, Brown said. 
However, the numbers for the College's Linkage program with Holy Cross College are down at the moment. For the past three years, approximately 50 student<> have participated in the program, whieh allows first-year Holy Cross students to take one elass per semester at Saint Mary's and also live on-campus at the College while enrolled as a Holy Cross student.

best-selling novel depicts "Christianity as the bad guy and we and our personal beliefs an.? our personal desires are good. 
Welborn explained that Brown is not the first to publish a work that attacks established Christian belief. 
"Beginning in the late 19th century, there were discoveries of various Gnostic texts. More recent discoveries of The Dead Sea Scrolls, or even the Gospel of Judas have, like earlier Gnostic texts, caused "people to start writing books about the hidden sayings of Jesus." 
"There were even a couple of novels written on the theme that there are other truths to Christianity not expressed by the institutional church," Welborn said. 
She cited the 1999 film "Stigmata" as one example of a contemporary work which, like "The DaVinci Code," presents misleading notions and erro­neous beliefs of Christianity. Yet, for some reason no previ­ous text has received quite so much hype and public attention as has 'The DaVinci Code," she said. 
Welborn said what troubles her is not so much the fiction of Dan Brown's work as it is the way in which our society has received it. 
"Sometimes people say to me you know, it is just a novel. If you go buy it, its on the fiction shelf," Welborn said. "Of course I realize that. Of course 'The Da Vinci Code' is just a novel. In fact, I would say that 'The DaVinci Code' is 99 per­cent fiction. Paris exists. The Louvre exists. Leonardo lived." 
Other than those basic aspects of the story's setting, there seems to be little faet to the tale, according to Welborn. 
She said that she's encoun­tered many who accept at least some assertions of "The DaVinci Code" as truth. Welborn said readers "who lack adequate knowledge of theology and history fail to real­ize the in,ventions of the author." 
Welborn believes that many people who read the book may see Brown's extensive bibliog­raphy and believe the book contains consider­able fact. Readers the Gospel? 

"The Jesus of The Da Vinci Code says that we're fine the way we are," Welborn said. "But what does the Jesus of the Gospel say? Love your enemy. Sell everything you have and give the money to the poor. Blessed arn the poor. Jesus says if you want to serve me, feed the hungry, cloth the naked, visit the imprisoned ... 
"Of course, people don't want that Jesus because that's hard stuff. That's the Gospel. And so yes, it mat­ters. 'The Da

"What bothers received her B.A.

me is the number in Honors 
of people who allow this book to shape their sense of early Christianity, shape their sense of art." Welborn said. She said she was "distressed that 'The DaVinci Code' functions as so much of a distraction to Christian truth." Its depiction of Jesus is a Gnostic Gospel-type portrayal and one that Welborn said is exceedingly inconsistent with the Jesus of the New Testament. 
Welborn said she fears the release of "The DaVinci Code" film will only propagate false teachings and worsen the situa­tion that the book has pro­duced, she said. 
"For a long time I've been quite puzzled by the popularity of the Gnostic Jesus and the Jesus of 'The Da Vinci Code' and I've tried to figure out what is the appeal. Why do people prefer that Jesus to the Jesus of

Recently she has dedicated much of her time to discussing and lecturing about Christianity as she understands its repre­sentation in "The DaVinci Code," which her book,"De­coding DaVinci," examines in more detail. 
Welborn said with the upcoming release of the film, it seems to her that "The DaVinci Code" is destined again to be a hotly debated topic in popular culture.

Returns reveal close election in Italy 
ROME -Exit polls indicated Monday that the Italian parliamentary election pitting center-left economist Romano Prodi against flamboyant bil­lionaire Premier Silvio Berlusconi was too close to call. 
Projections showed Berlusconi's coalition lead­ing in the Senate, but the two sides running neck-and-neck in the lower Chamber of Deputies. 
Based on 95 percent of pollster Nexus' sam­pling, Berlusconi's alliance won 158 Senate seal<;, compared with Prodi's 151. The margin of error was between 1 and 3 percentage points. 
Also, the projections did not account for six seal<; chosen by Italians abroad. Voter turnout was about 84 percent, the Interior Ministry said. 
Africa pledges to improve education 
MAPUTO, Mozambique -African leaders launched a campaign to get every child in school by 2015, and Britain responded Monday by pledging $15 billion in education aid to developing countries over the next decade. 
British Treasury chief Gordon Brown joined Mozambique President Armando Guebuza, former South African President Nelson Mandela and other African leaders in launch­ing the Free Education For All initiative. 
Brown's announcement follows a pledge by Britain and other members of the Group of Eight industrialized nations at their summit last year to double aid for Africa, the world's poorest continent.

Bush quells rumors of Iran attack 
WASIIINGTON -President Bush dismissed as "wild sper.ulation" reporl'i that the adminis­tration was planning for a military strike against Iran. 
Bush did not rule out the use of force, but he said he would continue to use diplomatic pres­sure to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon or the know-how and technology to make one. 
"I know here in Washington prevention means force," Bush said at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "It doesn't mean force, necessarily. In this case, it means diplo­macy." 
Several weekend news reports said the administration was studying options for military strikes. The New Yorker magazine raised the possibility of using nuclear bombs against Iran's underground nuclear sites.

rnnntings throughout the yfmr to 
knep students on track. Notre 
Damn has one of the highest 
rctnntion ratns in the nation, as 97 
percent of lirst ynar student<; come 
back for thnir sophomore ynar. 
But after freshman year, stu­
dnnts must find new advisors in 
thnir respective colleges and 
adjust to a nnw and varied set of 
resour1:ns. 
"I rnmember them not telling us 
wn nneded to dedarc our majors 
in order to get into cla'isns, then it 
was two crazy days trying to get 
that done and make sure I was 
fullilling requirement<;," said soph­
omore English major .lenni Fong. 
But Fong said after she made 
the adjustment from FYS, she has 
not had any serious problems with 
advising. 
Though students often have 
multiple advisors available within 
their respedive colleges, some 
uppnrdassmnn still return to their 
FYS advisor. 
"I do see some (older] student'>, especially if I had a good relation­ship with them," FYS advisor Mel Tardy said. "But we try and trust the other advisors with upper­d~L'>smen -it is better to go to the department (of the student's major( because they know the particular elasses and the new development'>." 
Upperda'ismen advisors prima­rily focus on helping students choosn dasses and finalize their fields of interest, Tardy said. Bn1:ausn thny each have so many students to assist, advisors after freshman year do not call students to mont on a ref.,TUlar bac;is likP. in FYS. 
In the College of Arts and Letters, students can visit the a'isistant deans to obtain informa­tion on University and college requirements as well as "an ovnrvinw of how all the pieces lit together," l'r.eaeher said. They also have major and minor pro­gram advisors, but each depart­mont dntnrminns it'i own structure -some havn one dirnetor, some have multiple faculty advisors. 
The widn degree of latitude in da.'is selection lor Art'i and Letters majors usually means morn stu­dnnts in the advising ollice right bnlim~ registration, Preacher said. 
"Many students come to us bn1:ausn they have mom than one nu~jor or a nu~jor and a minor, or a major and supplementary major, and so fi~rth, and are not sure how all their eours1~s will be counted," Prmtcher said. "But we'd like stu­dents to come to us not just for accounting purposes ... but for developmental purposes -what am their goals in building their curriculum?" In the Mendoza College of Business, advisors are availabln at both the department and eollege level. Student'> ntn 1:hoose to meet with any or the live undergraduate advisors sophomore year, and they nm d10ose to switch to a spedlie departnwnt advisor during their junior year. 
Upperclassmen in all colleges ean meet with an advisor a'> ollen a<; they choose -the extent or the rnlationship is left up to the indi­vidual student, undergraduate business advisor Doug Ilemphill said. 
Ilemphill said some 4.0 student<; never walk into the ortice with qw~stions, while other strong stu­dents eomn in twice per month. 
"One thing that makes this work prntty spedal is the personal rela­tionships," Jlemphill said. "You ean talk about (al student's ideas fi1r a partieular program, or about what they want to do with their lives aftnr graduation." 
Advisors in the College of Business have two main purposes, Hemphill said. They make sure students understand the require­ment<; for graduation, and they try to show student<; the possibilities and opportunities the University oflilrs. 

"Nobody can see all that Notre Dame hac; to oll"er," Hemphill said. "But if we talk about ideac; that we have seen or eome up with, the student hac; more to choose from. We don't want anybody to walk out the door after hrraduation say­ing 'I wish I'd known about that option, I would have done that.' 
"We want everyone to take advantage of the opportunities here." 
Nearly half of business require­ment<; must be fulfilled outc;ide of the College of Business, Hemphill said. So business students often need advice similar to the kind Arts and Letters majors seek ­advice like picking up a second major or selecting Arts and Letters dasses that will complement their area of interest. 
For students in the University's other colleges -Science, Architecture and Enginee~ing ­more extensive major require­ments reduce the amount of chokes student'> have. As a result, individual advising is not always needed. 
The School of Architecture has just one advisor, Father Richard Bullene, to whom students report sophomore year through their fifth year. Bullcne said architecture students, like business students, have a varied response to the advising system. 
"Some students just want the PIN and I need to use it to force them to sit down and go over progress towards degree comple­tion," Bullene said. "Others seek out advice on possibilities for minors and second majors, on career issues, particular study options, etcetera." 
For students in the College of Science like senior biology major Mike Tallarico, the choosing may be relatively ea'iy when looking to schP.dule classes. Tallarieo said he only visits his advisor to add or drop classes or for mandatory meetings. 
"For the most part advic;ors can answer my questions, but I usually do not have much to ask," Tallarico said. "They arc helpful but if a student is self-sufficient he or she should not really have to go to the advisor." 
Engineering studentc; faee a sim­ilar situation. Freshman .Jean Whitney, an aerospace and mechanical engineering major, does not plan to seek much adviee beliJre choosing dassns, since she has few choices. 

"Most of my classes are set as an engineer," Whitney said. "This semester I only got to choose whieh University seminar I took and what I wanted to do in !physi­cal education dassl. I think this does make an engineering advic;or less necessary for. freshmen and sophomore years." 
Preaeher said advi'iors at Notre Dame try to be problem solvers. 
"I  like  to  say that  our  oflice  
specializes  in  the art  of the  
possible,"  Preacher  said.

IN BRIEF 
Wage increase ends transit strike 
DENVER -Trains and buses started rolling again Monday to the delight of thousands of Denver-area commuters who had to find another way to get to work during a weeklong transit strike. 
''I'm incredibly happy," said Rebecca Popowitz, 22, who does not own a car and had to walk or used the slower, pared-down bus service that still ran during the strike. "Grocery shopping was a bit of a pain because I had to lug it all back home." 
The Regional Transportation District's 1, 7 50 union mechanics, bus drivers and train opera­tors walked off the job April 3 after rejecting a contract offer that their union leaders had rec­ommended. The strike shut down all train serv­ice and more than half the bus routes in a seven­county area. 
On Friday, the workers overwhelmingly approved a new contract with the same overall wage increase but a larger initial raise. 
Market anticipates Alcoa earnings 
NEW YORK -Stocks closed narrowly mixed Monday as investors looked past rising oil prices and awaited a sample of first-quarter earnings from Alcoa Inc. after the closing bell. 
There were no new economic reports to feed the market's obsession with whether the Federal Reserve will extend its series of interest rate hikes to fight inflation. Recent trading has been skittish amid investors' split opinions on how much growth the economy can manage. 
A fresh rise in crude oil pushed futures above $68 a barrel, as the market grew nervous about mounting political tension over Iran's nuclear arms program. A barrel of light crude jumped $1.35 to settle at $68.74 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
"I think one of the conundrums the market faces is that we continue to see energy prices go higher," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Co. "It's going to be hard to get the market to rally much this week with oil starting at $68." 
Hogan said the weakening bond market may also hinder investors' confidence, but added that Wall Street could see a lift from a solid cor­porate earnings. Alcoa led the way with a sharply better-than-expected quarterly profit.

Multitudes of people across the nation marched Monday to support immigration reform. Immigration ha<> proven to be a divisive and hard issue, but one that must be addressed. The Senate has stalled on a bill that would have allowed for "guest workers" to enter the eountry temporarily. The bill would also have opened up avenues for illegal immigrants currently living in the nation to pursue citizenship. 

Ian
The House has already 

Ronderos
pa<;sed a harsh bill 
tlmt calls for the con­

Liberated
struction of a seven 

hundred mile wall and changing the status of' illegal in1migration from a civil infraction to a felony. 
The stalled senatorial bill contains some very good practical logic. Illegal immi­!,'Tants exist. They do so in great numbers and have a significant role in our economy -to the tune of eleven million workers. Many illegal immigrant<> have been already integrated into American society, and the only thing separating them from their legal colleagues is a piece of paper. It is often argued that to provide any sort of' amnesty or road to eitizenship for illegals is wrong, because it chooses to allow a law to go unenforced, lets people who violated the law get oft' unpunished and encourages more people to break the immigration laws of this country. This sounds theoreti­cally valid and it is true that we should not encourage laws to be broken, but the point ultimately fails. The prior argument is one that applies theoretical reasoning to a practical problem. 
In the purely abstract, one should not allow the laws of a nation to be ignored, should punish violators and prevent simi­lar future transgressions; practically, we must deal with the fact that we have a very large number of illegal aliens working in this nation, with more coming, and that they are not going anywhere soon. A prae­tical solution to the problem L'l to allow "temporary workers" to enter the country, in order to encourage immigrants to cross legally, and to allow illegal immigrants already in the country and working a chance to make themselves naturalized. As it is impossible to remove the vast num­ber of illegal workers, this permits them to further integrate themselves into American society. If workers are intent on entering America, and arc willing to do so illegally, it makes sense to ofl'er them a way of doing so legally-hence the "guest worker" proposal. This way the govern­mrmt-can exert more control over the nation's borders. 
The I louse bill is entirely unethical. The erection of a security wall seven hundred miles long simply evolves from a siege mentality that is harming this nation. September 11 changed the way Americans viewed the world, and in many ways for the worse. It L'l important that we were made aware and more vigilant, so that such a tragedy can be guarded against. However, a sense of panic has attended the American population ever since and has a caused many Americans to adopt a scarily insular view of the world, one that centers upon feelings of constant threat and dan­ger imminent. Wall<; divide people and fos­ter ill will. The creation of the proposed barrier would only promulgate the view that America cares nothing for poor third­worlders and is desperate to keep them out. 
The proposal to make illegal immigrants felons is as appalling as it is cruel. This would create millions of felons overnight, who if caught would swell our already overcrowded penal system. Many children entered America illegally with their par­ents-are they to be felons too? Are they to suffer for obeying the commands of their parents, as any good child should? The felony proposal, as well as the wall one, is motivated by fear. America is seek­ing to protect herself by adopting overly severe measures. Harsh severity only belies vulnerability. America is only consid­ering these options because she fears ter­

rorists entering the country or immigrants 
taking jobs. 
Immigration is a good thing and should not be feared, but rather encouraged. The nineteenth century saw waves of Italian, German and Irish immi~-,rrani..'l. They at first were despised and feared by seg­ments of the population because they were dill'erent and would work for less. More than a century later, America ha'l largely absorbed these immigrants and joined their culture to the existing one to create something very unique. That is the beauty of America-Wfl are a collection of cul­tures and peoples that have synthesized to form something that belongs to no one eth­nic group or cultum. America is an idea. We should be exeitod to show it to the world and weleome its adherent<; to come join us. Sometimes changes to the estab­lished cultural or economic norm an~ unavoidable, but it would harm us more to close ourselves otl'like hermil'l. Open and friendly intercourse between nations and peoples leads to their mutual growth­just as it does in individuals. The Athenian statesman and orator Perides deliven~d the fi1llowing stunning lines on the open­ness of' democracy during his moving funeral oration: "Our city is thrown open to the world though and we never expd a forei!,'TWr and pnwent him from seeing or learning anything of' which the secret if revealed to an enemy might profit him. We rely not upon management or triekery, but upon our own heart<> and hands." Yet some in America would seek to manage and control our openness to the world using the treachery of fear.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
An open letter to Father John Jenkins 
Dear Notre Dame student body 
Hello. My name is Jason F.C. Laws and I am not a current member of MAC. I write to you as a minority Notre Dame student leader and in response to past articles about MAC (Minority Affairs Committee) and the Rob Lindley, Jr. article written last Friday, April10. 
I want to clarify my stance regarding the MAC amendment Senate meeting, at which I was in attendance. My disgust remains with the insensitivity expressed by Senate members during the discussion of the amendment to make MAC perma­nent. Thankfully, concrete examples of slipshod phrases such as "shut it down" or "it can wait" have been appropriately addressed already. Furthermore, Rhea Boyd's opening statement about the imperative nature of making MAC perma­nent, somehow and arbitrarily offended former offended members of Student Senate. At that point, I was perplexed and in complete disarray. Strangely, the significance of making MAC permanent was flooded out by political logistics, con­cerns for further amending the Constitution, unnecessary vouches for individuals' character and integrity, Lindley's playful and clever reference to the Constitution as a "punching bag" and a desire to leave the meeting at a considerate time. 
My challenge for those former Senators, our new Senators and all who read this article is that you begin to view MAC and the amendment to make the committee permanent as more than a simple document to be proposed, voted on and passed. See the faces of your fellow Domers, who are consistently underrepresented in our student body's voice. MAC members worked tirelessly this year to give a voice in Student Government to minority Notre Dame students. As Boyd stated at the Senate meeting, "this is the first year minority members of the student body have had an undiluted and uncompromised voice in Student Senate." Policy implemen­tation such as the Cultural Competency Resolution and a talk by famed rapper Chuck D gave a first real glimpse of hope to minority Domers. We began to feel that Student Government desired to include the interests or affairs of minorities in the Notre Dame Student Government mainstream agenda. However, much of that hope and trust in our student government was shattered as the MAC amend­ment was objectified and the minority members of the Notre Dame community were again marginalized. 
Passing the amendment to make MAC permanent before the end of the Baron/Shappell administration could have sent a concrete message to all minority students and the student body that Student Government is committed to being accountable for and representing the affairs of all students and ensuring each student's voice is heard. In Lindley's testimony to the Viewpoint, he assures that "It may take a week, [or] it may take months," to address giving MAC permanent status. After three years of Student Government experience, I understand the fears of the former administration to be accountable for such an imperative task or to make more changes to the Constitution. I understand, as a former member of the 2003-2004 COR (Council of Representatives}, which revised the Student Body Constitution to its current form, that a single amendment "can" wait. However, speaking as a minority student who faces the issues confronting Notre Dame's minority students everyday, the crucial changes to improve minorities' Notre Dame experience can wait no longer. 
I trust the leadership that Lizzi Shappell and her new administration brings to office. I simply offer the suggestion of increased sensitivity from leaders around the issue of giving all students a voice on this campus. Realize that a deeper look at MAC and the progress it has made symbolizes the cry from minority Notre Dame students to believe and unite wholly in our famed proclamation that "We are ND!"

I write to o~ject to your decision to permit the continued regular production of "The Vagina Monologues" on our campus. I write in this public manner to alert our faculty, colleagues and our treasured students that not all mem­bers of the Congregation of Holy Cross, to which we belong, endorse your decision. Speaking for myself, I find the deci­sion deeply damaging to Notre Dame and it<> mission as a Catholic university. It is a decision that I beg you to recon­sider and to reverse. 
When you were appointed president of Notre Dame there was hope that you might address and reverse the attenua­tion and drift in our Catholic mission that characterized our recent past. My own hope was that you would address urgently such crucial issues as faculty hiring, the develop­ment of a curriculum that truly conveys the richness of the Catholic intellectual tradition to our students and the insidi­ous effects on teaching and learning of the increasing cor­porate ethos at Notre Dame. For whatever reasons, you chose to place your initial emphasis on the regular produc­tion and sponsorship by elements of the university of "The Vagina Monologues" and "The Queer Film Festival." You 
put forth the position that "an event which has here far more deeply influenced by the reigning the implicit or explicit sponsorship of the culture than by faith convictions. university as a whole, or one of it<> units, Amidst this larger context you are 
or a university-recognized organiza­tion, and which either is or appears to be in name or content dearly and egregiously contrary to or inconsistent with the funda­mental values of a Catholic university, should not be allowed at Notre Dame." This was a position of such obvi­ous good sense that I never considered that you would retreat from it. Sadly, you have done precisely that. 
In asking why you would reverse a sound position, which you obviously had reached after much thought and prayer, one must conclude that you were influenced by those contributors to the debate who favored the continued production of "The Vagina Monologues." Presumably, you were influenced by the young women who produce this play and somehow see it as a contribution to the prevention of violence against women. Undoubtedly, you were influenced by the convictions of certain senior Arts and Letters faculty that any restriction on this play would damage our aca­demic "reputation" -and especially among those "pre­fermd peer schools" whose regard we crave. Whatever the ma'ions, I must tell you that your decision is being por­trayed as involving your "backing down." Indeed, it is hard to understand it in any other terms. 
You must know that in taking this decision you have brought most joy to those who care least about Notre Dame's Catholic mi'lsion. You have won for yourself a cer­tain short-term popularity with some students and certain faculty but have done real damage to our beloved school and it<; distinct place in American higher education. By your decision you move us further along the dangerous path where we ape our secular peers and take all our sig­nals from them. Knowing you and having conversed with you on matters relating to Notre Dame's Catholic mission in the past, I suspect that you recognize this in your own heart. Yet, you seemingly have let the possibility of some protest cause you to back off your own stated position. You were called to be courageous and you settled for being pop­ular. This is not your best self. This is not genuine leader­ship. 
In your recent "Closing Statement" you reveal a level of naivete about the process of a Catholic university engaging the broad culture that is striking and deeply harmful to our purpose as a Catholic university. We live at a time, as Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter pointed out some years ago, when the elite culture is programmed to trivial­ize religion. Furthermore, much of popular culture is deeply antithetical to religious conviction and practice. It offers a worldview completely at odds with any Catholic vision. It is a world view from which none of us can be 
sequestered and, indeed, many of our students arrive 
ready to permit the continued produc­tion and promotion of a play which, as our colleague Paolo Carroza 
rightly put it, "seems to reduce the meaning and value of 
women's lives to their sexual experiences and organs, rein­forcing a perspective on the human person that is itself fundamentally a form of vio­lence." Dialogue with this point of view is ridiculous. It 
should be contested and resis­ted at Notre Dame but never promoted. Notre Dame must 
hold to a higher view of the dignity of women and men. Might I ask that ifthis play does not meet your criteria 
of an "expression that is overt and insis­tent in its contempt for the values and sen­sibilities of this University," then what would? 
My fear is that you have been "spooked" by the fear of negative publicity ifyou were to "suppress speech on this campus." Here, it seems, you have a special opportunity to rethink your position. Know well that there is much hypocrisy abroad in the American academy on the issue of "academic freedom." Note that NYU had no difficulty recently in suppressing the "free speech" rights of the stu­dents who wanted to discuss and display the Danish car­toons. Note that folk at Brown University get by with a "speech code" that bans all "verbal behavior" that may cause "feelings of impotence, anger or disenfranchise­ment." In the American academy it is only certain kinds of speech that gets protected. And, as Professor Gary Anderson pointed out in his constructive contribution to this debate, a rather narrow range of politically correct views tends to prevail in the faculties of many institutions which influences what that "speech" is. Notre Dame presently has a wider range of perspectives represented than most institutions who are forever prattling on about their diversity. (They are all "diverse" in the same pre­dictable way!) 
Please have the confidence to shape Notre Dame into a truly distinct institution. Take up the challenge to clarify for our secular peers that Notre Dame allows-as they do not -"classroom engagement with religious beliefs precisely as religious" (as Brad Gregory put it so well). Reveal to them with the eloquence of which you are capable that the very values and convictions which allow us to consider a whole range of questions that they cannot also necessitate us to restrict the repeated public performance and promo­tion of works which are deeply offensive to our values. 
John, let me commend you for your admirable goal of seeking to find "ways to prevent violence against women." Over my years of teaching and pastoral service at Notre Dame I have sought to encourage my female students to appreciate their innate dignity and to truly respect them­selves. I have been blessed to come to know some amazing women whom I now count as dear friends. Drawing on conversations with such women about the circumstances that they find at Notre Dame leads me to suggest that your rather elaborate committee formed to pursue this goal has the whiff of a public relations exercise about it. The painful reality is that much of the violence against women in our society results from a sick view that separates sex from love and genuine relationship, from the commodification of sex, from the portrayal of women as objects, from the bla­tant refusal of some men to treat women with dignity and respect. Yet how will the committee be able seriously to address such issues when you have approved the contin­ued production of a play that reduces women to body parts? Surely you see the contradiction here? Could I request that this be an early item for consideration by this committee? 
What I ask of you in this letter will require you to dig deep into your heart and soul and to re-open a matter of which I am sure you want to be well rid. I suspect you have had moments when you wished never to hear of "The Vagina Monologues" again, and we both know that there are many other important matters to which you must attend. But careful readers of works like George Marsden's "The Soul of the American University" know that similar decisions to yours which conformed religious schools to their secular peers inexorably led them down a dangerous path to the full surrender of their religious mission and identity. Regrettably, places like Georgetown University are well advanced on this course. Don't let us merely follow them. To do so you would be a betrayal of our forebears in Holy Cross. Instead, Notre Dame must lead the way in American Catholic higher education. Please go back to your best self and to your original instincts and position on this matter. Don't embarrass those of us who want to work with you to build a great Catholic university. Lead us. 
Know of my prayers for you during this holiest of weeks.

Isci!'&fnRn I That's so 'Broke back' 
While "Brokeback Mountain" has gen­erated significant media buzz even pre­ceding it'i release, the film recently rneeived a dill"nrnnt kind of national attnntion when Gonzaga basketball fans chanted 
'Brokeback' at the opposing team. 
A'i it turns out. these wern not ral­lying cries in sup­port of gay right'i and inclusion, nor wnrn these students simply voicing their 


enthusiasm for Ang Mary Squillace
Lee's film. This inci­dent cannot even be Scene Writer attributed to a rare, 
collective case of basketball-induced tourettes. 
lnstfmd the 'brokeback' chant in the Gonzaga basketball an~na was a taunt meant to suggest that members of the opposing team were gay. 
llowever, louder than these students' shouts is a message about our society. From this event it is important to aeknowledge that even in a social atmos­phere that allows a progressive film like "Brokebaek Mountain" to enjoy critical and commercial success, Americans still harbor dangerous predispositions and apprehensions regarding homosexuality. 
Even al'ter the critics' acclaim marched across newspapers, film awards were dis­tributed, and media coverage began to die down, "Brokeback Mountain" contin­ues to hold a distinct place among college student'i' vernacular. with a decidedly negative connotation. The term 'broke­baek' has now replaced the slang use of 'gay,' or relers to something of "question­able mas1~ulinity," as it is defined at urbandktionary.eom. 
Although the success of the film allowed many Amerieans to collectively pat themselves on the back for producing and consuming such a progressive piece of art, the extremely hostile way in which a word dosely tied to homosexuality is wielded requires a reevaluation about what the reception of "Brokeback Mountain" really reveals about our socie­ty. Simply because it exists in the main­stream does not mean that our culture has evolved passed biases and close­mindedness. 
One common reaction to the film is dis­assodation. In other words, people are quick to separate themselves from having seen the film or even desiring to see the film as if making this distinction reaffirms their ultimate heterosexuality and mas­culinity. 
The primary fear appears to be is that watching "Brokeback Mountain" is either a glaring indication of one's own sexuality and masculinity, as if somehow the 134 minutes spent in the theatre will, second­by-second, drain one's heterosexuality. 
However, it's not as if American audi­ences have never seen homosexuality portrayed in art or the media. The prob­lem for most people seems to stem from the fact that in this film homosexuality creeps outside of its socially sanctioned world of stereotypes. As soon a'i repre­sentations of gay men stop being limited to the characters with impeccable fashion sense that we typically see in media rep­resentations, they suddenly become threatening. 
Instead of subsequent variations of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy's" Fab Five picking out a new wardrobe for some clueless bachelor or "Will and Grace's" Jack's affinity for Cher, "Brokeback Mountain" presents its view­ers with a depiction of gay men that not only runs contrary to the images that are most prevalent, but associates homosexu­ality with America's ultimate guy's guy­the cowboy. 
While this appears to be one of the most disconcerting aspects of the film for people who cannot reconcile homosexual­ity with a lifestyle outside of the stereo­types typically portrayed in the mass media, it is also the most important pre­cisely because it challenges this notion society has about homosexuality. 
Even among other films with prominent gay or lesbian storylines, "Brokeback Mountain" appears to be the most pro­gressive in its ability to pull homosexuali­ty out from under stereotypes, as well as put it in the context of an extremely pa.:;­sionate and tender romance. Within the lilm world similar movies have been lim­ited to independent films that don't gain a large following. 
like television representations, the depiction of homosexuality among main­stream films is often limited to stereo­types of both gay men and lesbians. Additionally, typically homosexuality is represented just by one person-rela­tionships outside of one-night-stands and college phases have not yet had a signifi­cant role in Hollywood films. 
All this considered, 'brokeback' is more than just a slang term for homosexuality or a barb. Instead 'brokeback' represents an outlet for constructing representations of homosexuality away from stereotypes and a way to keep our own predisposi­tions about it in check.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 


'Syphon Filter' sets P 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assisranr Scene Editor 
Until recently, the Sony PSP lacked a defin­ing gaming experience for the system -a sore spot for Sony's first foray into the portable gaming market. Every console requires one key game early on in its lifetime to drive sales and guarantee the system's success. For the XBox -Microsoft's first foray into consoles -it was "Halo," an instant dassic that kept the system alive in its rocky inaugural year. 
But recently, the PSP's first true break­through title has arrived. "Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror" has splashed down in the PSP's dark waters, and provides a shining path towards the system's full potential. 
The game is a third-person shooter and is set in the vein of previous titles in the "Syphon Filter" franchise. Situating the cam­era firmly over protagonist Gabe Logan's shoulders grants the player solid control over his varied actions while keeping the action in the forefront. Logan, a special-ops soldier who is brought in when things get hairy for foreign involvement, specializes in mixing stealth with Rambo-style tactics throughout

the course of the game. Action flies fast and heavy in the game, wasting no time. The first level alone features an immediate firelight, a sniper battle and several tense moments of sneaky, covert action. 
Guiding Logan through the physical maneuvers in the game, such as climbing walls, sliding down zip-lines and crawling through tight corridors, is as simple as hitting a single key. The controls have been stream­lined to fit the PSP's cramped control scheme, although they're still not perfect. 
Switching weapons and performing some of Logan's signature moves in the middle of a heated firelight is simply a little complicated. Character movement is mapped to the left analog nub, while context-sensitive move­ments are done with the directional pad, also on the left side of the PSP. Unless the player has two left thumbs, it's going to be difficult, and potentially fatal, to switch weapons or try to climb out of harm's way when bullets fill the air. 
The single-player experience is not dra­matically different from past "Syphon Filter" efforts, but that's necessarily a bad thing. The makers of "Halo" built a gaming legend by recycling popular elements from first-person o shooters. "Syphon Filter" does the same, bor­

Many laughed at the thought of "Final Fantasy" characters such as Cloud Strife fighting alongside Donald and Goofy from the Disney stable. But after the shocking smash hit "Kingdom Hearts" took the gaming world by storm in 2002, Square Enix and Disney join forces once again for "Kingdom Hearts II." 
The game starts off where "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" ended. Sora and his companions awaken from their yearlong slumber, and continue their quest to find King Mickey. Experience with the previous games is essential, as the player is thrust into this sequel with little explanation. 
The player is given immediate control not of Sora, the young male protagonist of the original, but Roxas. He shares many characteristics with Sora with the exception that he wields dual-Keyblades. Roxas explores Twilight Town, and even­tually discovers Sora and his slumbering companions in the basement of a man­sion featured in "Chain of Memories." He disappears as they awaken, but con­tinues to play a role through the rest of the story. His segment serves as a mere tutorial to the game ahead and to intro­duce new garners to the "Kingdom Hearts" control scheme. 

At first glance, the controls are nearly identical to "Kingdom Hearts" -garners control Sora's actions through a com­mand menu in real time. However, KHII adds a few new abilities to Sora's lineup, mainly the Drive Gage. With it Sora can merge with one or two members in his 'l party, becoming even more powerful and gaining some amazing abilities. 
The Drive system adds depth of the battles, and is also fairly easy to control. The player is also given more control over how the teammates act during a battle. The exact tactics that the com­puter partners employ are up to the player's discretion. 
The new Reaction Commands are an awesome addition to the "Kingdom Hearts" library of attacks -they force the player to pay attention to what's going on in the battle and adds a new dynamic to the battle. These commands allow the player to pull off visually stun­ning stunts that dramatically impact gameplay. For example, mastering Reaction commands is vital to defeating some bosses. 
One of the biggest complaints with the original was the Gummi ship. Sora used this ship to travel to the different plan­ets, and was a complete chore to control for garners. This time around, it controls

DVD REVIEW 
'Gardener' a gripping experience 
By MARY SQUILLACE Scene Critic 
In a world where popular cinema has become synonymous with the special effects-driven and action-packed formu­laic plots of the Hollywood blockbuster, "The Constant Gardener" comes as an enormous relief. Unlike most contempo­rary dramas, this f:tlm is able to take the audience on a truly gripping journey without the "race against the clock" and "world on the brink of disaster" gimmicks that have become so familiar to moviego­ers. Instead, "The Constant Gardener" replaces these conventions with a story that not only gets the viewers' adrenaline pumping, but is socially and emotionally engaging as well. 
"The Constant Gardener" tells the story of Justin Quayle (Raph Fiennes) and his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). When Justin's role as a British diplomat moves the two of them to Africa, Justin settles quietly into his position, occupying himself with his garden in his spare time. Tessa, on the other hand, picks up more perilous hobbies. Passionately invested in a variety of Amnesty International-esque organiza­tions, she takes on a mysterious project 
that appears to culminate in her brutal murder. 
Upon his beloved Tessa's death, Justin embarks on a quest to uncover his wife's secrets. As Justin begins to delve into 
The Constant Gardener 
Director: Fernando Meirelles Writer: Jeffrey Caine Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Danny Huston, Daniele Hartford, Packson Ngugi 
pans and wide shots of the Kenyan land­scape punctu­ate the film, enhancing the narrative's ability to cap­tivate its audi­

details of his late wife's personal past, he finds himself rapidly confronted with the disturbing and dangerous truth behind one corporation's ascent. 
The film, which begins with Tessa's death and then cuts between scenes from the past and present, is immediately engaging and maintains its momentum all the way to the final scene. Laced with tiny mysteries, 'The Constant Gardener" requires the viewer's full attention and rightfully captures it with its narrative. Heightening the effects of the action-ori­ented side of the film-in which a seem­ingly omnipresent villain trails Justin as he races across two continents for answers -is the distinctly emotional aspect of the film. 
Central to this emotional appeal is its focus on Justin and Tessa's relationship. The romance between the characters is more than a convention set-up in order to infuse the story with a sexy subplot. Here the character interactions emit a palpable chemistry and ultimately generate incredible sympathy for Justin, the pro­tagonist. 
The characters are also largely respon­sible for the fresh feel to this drama. Breaking with convention of popular cin­ema, Justin is a somewhat accidental hero, lacking in the self-awareness and bravado of typical protagonists. 
Fiennes approaches this role with sub­tlety in order to convey Justin's mild­mannered but emotionally complex per­sonality. Though ultimately Justin exhibits courage, it is clear from Fienne's performance that his every action is mediated not by the overwhelming sense of righteousness and masculinity that drives so many of Hollywood's heroes, but with the same sensitivity with which he tends to each one of his precious plants. 
Likewise, Weisz, proving herself worthy of the Academy Award acclamation she received in March, brings Tessa to life. Her apparent comfort with this role allows her inhabit both Tessa's uncon­tained passion and down-to-earth atti­tude. 
Nearly upstaging both actors' perform­ances are the visual elements of "The Constant Gardener." Coming from direc­tor Fernando Meirelles and cinematogra­pher Cesar Charlone -two of the minds behind the beautifully shot "City of God" -the stunning visuals of this film come as no sur­prise. Sweeping 
ence. 
However, 

the constant presence of Africa in the film's back­ground is more than just eye candy. While the events in the film are fictional, "The Constant Gardener" fulfills its social responsibility to point out some serious issues plaguing Africa. Not only does the film succeed in garnering the viewers' compassion for its lead characters, but it also effectively draws the audiences into this distant culture. It provokes, at the very least, some consideration to the needs of those living on the continent we so often forget. 
Ultimately, "The Constant Gardner" forces us to remember that it doesn't nec­essarily take a series of explosions and a rugged, muscled protagonist to put us on the edge of our seats and make our hearts pound. The film has an emotional­ly and socially significant story arc that builds to a satisfying and poignant con­clusion, one that allows the film to make a lasting mark on the hearts and minds of its audience.

Associated Press 

DURHAM, N.C. -DNA testing failed to connect any members of the Duke University lacrosse team to the alleged rape of a strip­per, attorneys for the ath­letes said Monday. 
Citing DNA test results delivered by the state crime lab to police and prosecutors a few hours earlier, the attorneys said the test results prove their clients did not sexually assault and beat a stripper hired to perform at a March 13 team party. 
No charges have been filed in the case. "There is no DNA evi­
deuce that shows she was touched by any of these boys," said Attorney Joe Cheshire, who represents one of the team's captains. 
The alleged victim, a 27­year-old student at a near­by college, told police she and another woman were hired to dance at the party. The woman told police that three men at the party dragged her into a bath­room, choked her, raped her and sodomized her. 
The Associated Press does not name alleged vic­tims in sexual assault cases. 
The allegations have led to the resignation of coach Mike Pressler, the cancel­lation of the lacrosse sea­son and the suspension of one player from school. 
The case also led to days of protests on and off the Duke campus, and some of the players have moved for safety reasons. 
According to court docu­ments, only lacrosse team members were at the party. Authorities ordered 46 of the 4 7 players on Duke's lacrosse team to submit DNA samples to investigators, who com­pared them with evidence collected from the woman. 
Because the woman said her attackers were white, the team's sole black play­er was not tested. It was not known whether inves­tigators tested for DNA other than the players'. 
Cheshire said the report indicated authorities took DNA samples from all over the alleged victim's body, including under her finger­nails, and from her posses­sions, such as her cell phone and her clothes. 
"They swabbed about every place they could pos­sibly swab from her, in which there could be any DNA," he said. 
District Attorney Mike Nifong has said he would have other evidence to make his case should the DNA analysis prove incon­clusive or fail to match a 
IN BRIEF 

Williams appeals drug sus­pension NEW YORK -Ricky Williams and his lawyer met Monday with NFL counsel Jeff Pash, seeking to have the league overturn a positive drug test that could cost him the entire 2006 season. The league, which doesn't acknowledge drug tests until there is a final determination, had no comment on the appeal. Williams' lawyer, David Cornwell, acknowl­edged that the hearing was taking place, but had no further comment. The results of the hearing won't be made known immediately but if the positive test is upheld, it would be Williams' fourth violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy, mean­ing at least a one-year suspension. Previous positive tests were for marijuana, which Williams acknowledged using. But the latest test apparently involved a drug other than marijuana. 
Crisp out for I 0 days with fractured hand BOSTON -Boston Red Sox center fielder Coco Crisp has a fracture on the base of his index finger on his left hand and will be sidelined for at least 10 days. Crisp's hand will be immobilized in a splint for 10 days and then reeval­uated, team medical director Dr. Thomas Gill said Monday. No sur­gery is needed to treat the injury, sustained when he tied to steal third base Saturday in Boston's 2-1 victory at the Baltimore Orioles. "Once sufficient healing has occurred, Coco can begin batting and return to baseball activities," Gill said in a statement. The 26-year-old Crisp, a switch­hitter who throws right-handed, was acquired in January from Cleveland after Johnny Damon signed with the New York Yankees. Crisp is batting .333 (8-for-24) with a double, triple and six runs scored. 

Lee signs with Cubs for $65 million CHICAGO -NL batting champion Derrek Lee and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a $65 million, five-year con­tract, a deal expected to be announced Tuesday. "It's fairly likely something will be worked out," agent Casey Close said Monday. "We still have to iron out some things." The Cubs called a news conference for Tuesday but did not specifY its subject, and Cubs general manager Jim Hendry declined comment. Lee is making $8 million in the final season of a $22.5 million, three-year deaL His new contract calls for a $13 million annual salary from 2006-10 and contains a no-trade clause, one person familiar with the agreement said, speak­ing on condition of anonymity. Late last week, Lee said he would break off negotiations for the rest of the season if the sides did not reach an agreement by last Saturday.

Kings' Robitaille to hang up skates 
Los Angeles' all-time leading scorer set to retire at season's end 
Associated Press LOS ANGELES Lue Hobitailln, the highest scoring left wing in Nlll. history, will retire at tho end of the season, the Los Angeles Kings said Monday. Hobitailln, the Kings' eanwr lHtdnr in goals, will hold a news eonf'nrenee Tuesday to discuss his decision. "Tomorrow is the opportunily for the Kings and Lue Hobitaille to a:knowlndgo his flail of Famn-ealilwr career and give him an opportunity to address his decision to retire from the game of hockey," said Mic:haol Altieri, tho Kings' vi1:n presi­dent of cornrnunieations.

"It came to a point after 19 years he felt it was time," said Pat Brisson, Hobitaille's agent. "Some morn­ings he wakes up and says, 'Should I or should I not,· since he is so passionate for the game." 
Hobitaille has made a eareer of breaking reeords at his posi­tion. He scored the most goals in a season for a left wing, with 63 in 1992-1993. lie is also the only one to record eight straight seasons of at least 40 goals. 
"lie's going out on his own terms," Brisson said. "He is walking out with his head up." 
The native of Montreal played on Canada's gold-medal win­ning tnam at the 1994 World Championship. Hobitaille scored the winning goal in a shootout. giving his country its first world title in 33 years. 
In January, the fan-favorite nicknamed "Lucky" broke the Kings' franchise record for goals with a hat trick in a win over Atlanta. 
"lin's given this organization so rnueh. and an identity," Brisson said. "The L.A. Kings logo is right next to Lue Hobitaille. Ilis face is recog­nized in L.A. as being one of the best athletes in this town."

Big Papi signs ne-w four-year deal 
Ortiz signs $52 million contract extension with Red Sox on Monday 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -David Ortiz agr!lf~d to a four-year contract extension with the Boston Red Sox on Monday, a deal that will guarantee the American League MVP runner-up about $52 million. 
The deal keeps his powerful bat, bright smile and sharp wit in Boston's clubhouse without the possibility of him departing after the 2007 season, when Ortiz could have become a free agent. But he loves Boston and didn't want to be besieged by suitors. 
"You have a lot of people coming right at you," he said during a news conference at Fenway Park. "I feel this is my salaries of $12.5 million from 2007-10. The Hed Sox would get a $12.5 million option for 2011 with no buyout. 
"I want to finish my career as a Hed Sox player," Ortiz said. ''I'm going to be around for a while. I'm pretty sure New England is .?oing to take this as good news. 
Hcd Sox general manager ThHo Epstein certainly did. 
"I can't think of a player who contributfls in so many ways," Epstein said. "He's a guy with a smile on his face. lie sets the right mood for the team in our clubhouse.... It was just an easy decision for us" to give the extension. 
Had Ortiz become a free

May 2004. That deal called for a $6.5 million salary this year and gave Boston an option for 2007 that currently was valuHd at $8.4 million with a $1.4 mil­lion buyout. 
While the final numbers of his new deal were not immediately available, the sides discussed an agreement that would include a $2 million signing bonus, keep this year's salary the same and add annual 

during spring 
training. 

Since Ortiz joined the Bed Sox in 2003 as a free agent from the Minnesota Twins, he and Manny Ramirez have developed into perhaps baseball's top power duo. Ortiz led the AL with 148 RBis last year. 
They combined for 68 homers in 2003, 84 in 2004 and 92 in 2005, when Ortiz's career-best 47 were one fewer than New York's Alex Hodriguez, the AL leader. Ortiz and Hamirez beearne the first teammates in major league history to eaeh have 40 homers and 40 doubles in one season in 2004. Last year, they totaled 292 HBis. 
Ortiz is one of' Boston's dub­house leaders, smiling and jok­ing with teammates. lie also is one of baseball's top eluteh hit­ters, leading the league last year with 21 game-winning HBis, while 19 of his homers gave the Hed Sox a tie or the lead. 
In Boston's first six games this season, live ol' them wins, Ortiz has one horner, four RBis and a .292 batting average. The Hed Sox had Monday oil' before Tuesday's horne opener against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
Since joining the Hed Sox, Ortiz has been the most pro­ductive addition at the plat!~ since John Henry became owner in 2002 and Epstein took over as general manager in 2003. 
Ortiz was lifth in the AL MVP voting in 2003 and fourth in 2004 before finishing second to Hodriguez in a tight vote last year. 
In those three seasons, Ortiz leads the majors with 38H HBls, is second with a .600 slugging percentage and fourth with 119 homers 
In the previous six years in the Twins organization, Ortiz spent just two full seasons in the majors, hitting .282 with 10 homers and 63 HBis in 2000 and .272 with 20 homers and 75 HBis in 2002.

CLUB SPORTS 
Men's rowing takes three of four from Purdue 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame men took three out of four races from Midwestern rowing power Purdue University at the April eighth State of Indiana Regatta. The racing, set on the turbulent waters of Eagle Creek Beservoir, included several school versus school challenges for men's and women's crews. 
In the past five years no Notre Dame men's crew has taken a race from a Purdue boat in the annual ND-PU chal­lenge. This year's racing paid witness to the dedication and preparation of each crew on Notre Dame's team. The racing began with Notre Dame's Novice 4 of coxswain Radhika Deva, (stroke) Craig Wiborg, Tomas Castillo, Johann deSousa and Matt Napierski defeating Purdue's four-man crew with a time of 7:24. Coming in third was (coxswain) Tara Morin's crew of Nick Kluesner, Dan Murphy, Brandon Carroll and Jordan Frankel, who at 7:39 finished just two seconds behind the Purdue 4. Notre Dame's power­ful Novice 8 of coxswain Bryce Chung, (stroke) Karol Grzesiak, Thomas Mazzacavallo, Andrew Matasic, Ray Schleck, Brendan McNutt, Rob Bowen, Taylor Donaldson and Matt Degnan led from start to finish and crossed the line in 5:52 with open water and ten seconds between them and the best fin­isher of Purdue's three tradi­tionally strong novice crews. 
In varsity racing, Notre Dame's second Varsity 8 battled back and forth with Purdue's second Varsity 8 and Lightweight 8 crews on an adjusted course. The race fin­ished with (cox) Julie Lambe's crew of (stroke) Scotty Campbell, P.J. McAward, Evan Donoghue, Michael Lucci, Bill Blosky, Andrew Baker, Michael Lutkus and Michael Giordano finishing in 5:02 to outdistance Purdue's best finisher (5:05) by about a boat-length. Notre Dame's top boat, the first Varsity 8 of (cox) Gigi Gutierrez, (stroke) Dan Pearson, Nick Mathew, Jake Teitgen, Joe Blakely, Tedd Hawks, Steve Maher, Kane Pithey and bowman Nick Catella, suffered the only loss of the day against Purdue's highly regarded Varsity 8 crew. The Purdue V8 (5:51). which a week ago defeated nationally­ranked Temple University in San Diego, held off the sprint of the fast-charging Notre Dame crew (5:56) to win the race by just more than a boat-length. 
Notre Dame's Varsity 8 stroke seat Dan Pearson commented, "We were greatly encouraged but not satisfied with our team results. Taking three of four races from a program like Purdue is a great step for us, but our Varsity 8 is hungry to catch Purdue's top boat. We will see them twice more this year, and we intend to do more than just give them a good race. We want to sweep Purdue by beating them with all four boats that we put out to race." 
Notre Dame Varsity coach Kurt Butler and Novice coach 
J.P. Oleksiuk were similarly encouraged and remain opti­mistic for the second half of the racing season. 

Cycling 
Eleven members of cycling team traveled to Kalamazoo, Mich. to compete in a pair of races at Western Michigan University this weekend. Building on last week's success, the Irish again claimed more wins and top finishes. 
Saturday's race featured a long flat road race that finished with multiple loops. Three team riders competed in the 27 -mile Men's D race, as soph­omore Peter Nistler, in only his second race, unleashed a strong sprint and rode away with the victory. Three Irish riders started in the 40-mile Men's C race. Freshman Andy Steves once again won the race, claiming his fourth indi­vidual victory this season. The final four Irish riders on raced in the 55 mile Men's B race. Sophomore Matt Prygoski appeared as if he would win as he approached the finish line, but crashed hard after the rider in front of him slid out in the final corner. Tim Campbell was not far behind, taking fourth place overall, and Mike Lavery finished right on his wheel in fifth place out of 60 riders. 
Sunday's circuit race, an extremely hilly 2. 75-mile loop featured two hard climbs on every lap. In the 45-minute Men's C race, Andy Steves gar­nered his second win of the weekend as he sprinted clear of all other racers up the finishing climb. Steves has claimed five wins in nine races this season. The Mens B race was an hour in duration. The team plan was to put Matt Prygoski in a situa­tion where he could use his hill climbing power. Three laps into the race, Prygoski was able to breakaway from the main pack with an IU rider. The rest of the ND team worked with IU at the front of the main field, slowing the pace in Prygoski's favor, and chasing down any threat­ening attacks. Prygoski blazed up the final climb, taking his first NCAA win. Lavery, Gisler and Campbell came in one minute later at the front of the main pack, taking seventh, eighth, and lOth in the 45 rider race. 
The team races again in two weeks at the regional competi­tion, held at the University of Illinois. This will be the final race of the season, and the team hopes to take away a few more victories and finish the year ranked in the top 10 in the 35-team conference. 
Men's Water Polo 
The men's water polo team hosted its annual Alumni Tournament in Rolfs Aquatic Center this weekend. The Irish started off the weekend slowly, losing their first game to Michigan State 9-5. The Irish beat the second ranked Spartans earlier this year but were plagued with turnovers and defensive lapses in the tournament opener. There were shining moments in the losing effort, however, with Pat Connors, Matt McNicholas and Jay Nunez contributing to the goal count. 
The Irish bounced back in a night game against the Alumni team. A shaky first quarter led to an early Alumni lead, but the Irish staged a comeback with tough defense and opportunis­tic offense. The Irish took the lead late in the third quarter and kept it for the rest of the game, for a 13-11 victory. Greg Szewczyk, Zhanwei Khaw and Tom Fletcher all contributing to the solid win. The Irish played the "B" squad Sunday morning and used the game as a learn­ing experience for the younger players on the team. 

In the tournament finale, the Irish were matched against Chicago Club Team, who had beaten Michigan State earlier on Sunday. The Irish came out fired up and ready to play as the first half ended in a 2-2 draw. With stifling defense, a well-balanced offense and sev­eral pressure blocks from goalie Scott Tagwerker the Irish went on to win 7-4. Mike Silhasek, Colin Dunn and McNicholas had outstanding performances in the win. 
Equestrian 
Molly Schmiege claimed first place in intermediate fences at Zones this weekend and quali­fied for Nationals. Schmiege will join Ke.lsey Ostberg, who qualified earlier this year. The Nationals will be held May 4-7 in Harrisburg, PA. 
In other Zone results, Heather LaDue and Alisha Wilkinson finished third and sixth respectively in advanced walk-trot-canter, and Alie Minnish took fifth in open flat. In team standings, Kansas State won the event, followed by Indiana and Wisconsin.

was great." 
In his first tournament of the season, the Administaff Augusta State Invitational, Sandman carded a three over­par 219, tying for 25th place in one of the nation's most competitive fields. 
"I really can't imagine any­one playing better golf [than Josh] right now," Irish head coach Jim Kubinski said. "With everything he's gone through, in addition to making the transition to college, he's just been outstanding." 
This weekend at the Boilermaker Invitational, Sandman got into a rhythm again, shooting a three under­par 69 in Sunday's final round to finish the tournament at four-over-par 220. That was good enough for a second place tie with fellow team member Cole Isban. 
"I always felt pretty confi­dent," Sandman said. "But I didn't think I would make as big a splash as I did." 
In addition to dealing with his back, Sandman has also had to adjust to a new swing during the last year and a half, making his performance over the weekend all the more impressive. 
"He has worked a great deal on swing changes suggested by his coach back home, along with an eye from me on occa­sion," Kubinski said. "I think we really saw what Josh is capable of with that 69 on Sunday." 
In fact, the one thing that Sandman didn't do well-putt -is the thing that Kubinski feels he's best at now. 
"Josh is a tremendous put­ter, he just didn't have it [at times this week]," Kubinski said. "He's very solid through­out the bag, but I think his strongest suit is his putting." 
Despite the obstacles of being a freshman competing against upperclassmen, Sandman has been able to hold his own. In his six rounds this year, Sandman has a 
73.17 scoring average. That places him just behind senior Mark Baldwin, junior Cole Isban and senior Scott Gustafson for the team lead. 
Sandman said his practice with Baldwin, Isban and Gustafson has been the main reason he came out of the gate so strong. 
"We've all pushed each other to get better," he said. "When we get out there [in practice], Cole and I will always play a match against the two seniors. There will always be pride on the line, and you never want to lose that." 
Notre Dame returns to action April 23 in Dade City, Fla. for the Big East Championship. 
For Sandman, it will be only his third collegiate tourna­ment. 
"I don't know what to expect right now," Sandman said. "I feel like I can compete with anybody right now. I just have to go out there and play my best."

Cardinals 
continued from page 20 
Dame won the game 4-1 on April 7 last year thanks to a three-run homer off the bat of then-Irish senior Liz Hartmann. 
The Cardinals arrive with an overall record of 9-16 (3-5 in the Mid-American Conference) after dropping a pair of games at Western Michigan. During the short series, Ball State had trouble getting to Broncos pitcher Krysten Shumaker. Notre Dame also struggled in its one meeting with Shumaker March 26, but the Irish won 2­1 in extra innings.

Fusaro said Saint Mary's goal was to go at least .500 in the eight games. With the two wins Monday, the Belles have already assured achieving that goal, as they are 5-1 in the first six contests. 
Sullivan said the set against Calvin is important for the Belles not only because they are the last two games but also because they are conference games. 
Fusaro says that Saint Mary's will look to continue the suc­cess they have had in the past three days and finish off strong. 
"Our goal was to stay intense and stay up," Fusaro said. "To be as intense and as loud in the first game against Alma as in the last game against Calvin."

Belles take third in Spring Fling 
Meagan Mattia leads team with 162 in two-day tournament 
By BECK! DORNER 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's captured third place this weekend in the annual Illinois Wesleyan Spring Fling. 
Saint Mary's two-round total of 661 was only one stroke shy of second-place William Woods University, and the Belles edged out Wisconsin Eau-Claire for third place by only one stroke. 
DePauw was largely unchal­lenged, beating the other 10 teams handily with a final score of 634. Sarah Gates of DePauw was the individual medalist with a 78 on round one and a 75 on day two that forced a playoff win against Jana Mosseson of Lindenwood. 
Senior Megan Mattia was the top individual placer for the Belles, tying for seventh with a two-round total of 162 (80-82). Many of the return­ing Belles had played the Ironwood Course more than a few times, and Belles coach Mark Hamilton stressed con­sistency and course manage­ment. 
"My advice was to play as 'clean' of a round as possi­and did my best to stay on the ble," Hamilton said. "Just try fairways," she said. to stack up the pars." In addition to Mattia's 82

"Playing tough conditions throughout this spring helped us the first day," Hamilton said. 
Saint Mary's cut seventeen stokes from their first round total to record a 322 on day two. Freshman Alex Sei's sec­ond round four-over-par 76 from the five spot led the late charge. It marked the low round for the Belles for the tournament. Her birdie­birdie-birdie finish cemented her in a tie for 13th place overall. 
Sei described her success as a combination of a few good rolls and good course man­agement: 
"I made a few great putts this spring. 
"We still need to tighten things up and be a little more precise around the greens in order to challenge the top three teams in the country," he said. "That will be our focus for the next cou­ple of weeks." 
Captain Kirsten Fantom echoed her coach's concerns. 
"For our coming tourna­ment we still need to work on our short game," Fantom said. "More practice will improve our confidence in our ability to make shots around the green, which is key." 
The Belles return to action next with the SMC/Bethel Invitational on Wednesday, April 19.
