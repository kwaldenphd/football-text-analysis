War and Peace 
Them is much negative energy in the air. 
Unfortunately, it seems to be affecting me in a 
small and subtle manner. I usually do not like 
ton much negative energy. It raises tension. 
heightens irratibility 
and sustains a violent C. R. "Teo" T codoro 
nature. Them is some-lllusrrarions Editor 
ihing that I feel that I 
must do at this time. something to prevent any 
unwanted outburst. I got to sleep. 
Ah. them. I foci a little belter. Yet, tensions 
are still prnsent. However, I really don't care so 
much anymore. I am at ease with myself but it 
soems others aro not. What is the roason for 
this unrnst'' I take a look in the Viewpoint seC'­
tion. People arnn't happy. People are laking 
offense at others. Why? In my opinion. I think 
it's over somP.thing really stupid. 
It is common knowledge on campus that the 
non-discrimination clause revision was denied 
by the Board of Pellows and affirmed by the 
Board of'Trustern,. This has caused much con­
sternation among many stud1rnts. and possibly 
among others. that the University should deny 
those of an altnrnativo sexual orientation non­
discriminati.on rights. Many ffwl betrayed and 
forgotten. Yet. that is only onr. side of the story. 
Thr. other side is probably enjoying this sort 
of' "victory" ovP.r idealogy. To further comment. 
some would even µut down those who would 
disagree with their "superior" views. 
Arcusitions of' hair and closed-mindP.d1rnss are 
common. Apparently. both sides am not willing 
to reconciliate. The negative energy still lingers 
in the air. 
I'm writing this Inside Column because the 
staff ne,\ded one last night. In most cases, I 
would earn less abouL voicing my opinion on 
such matters, but given the opportunity, I 
decided to take it. Besides. if people don't want 
to read this. then they don·t have to. 
The way I sc(1 it. here's what the Cniversity 
ol' Notrn Dame as an institution has said to the 
homosexuals and bi-scxuals present on cam­
pus: "W•\ don't like you." lley, iftlrn University 
rc~ally cared, wouldn't they still accept peoplP. 
of' a dilfornnt orirmtation. We arn not taking 
about lil'nstylc. however; Du Lac prohibits sexu­
al actiYity among its students, so if no one is 
having sex, then it is prntty much impossible to 
practic,\ a sexual lifestyle. hetcro-or homos,\X­
ual. It sc(•ms obvious, at least to me, that Jesus 
would wdcomc any person n~gardlcss. !Icy. he 
partiPd with hookers and tax collectors. 
On tho otlrnr side, if' people arc quite dissatis­
fied with this school. then why do limy not just 
leave'! Don't gel me wrong. I'm not telling peo­
pln to leave school on my account (I wouldn't 
want you to anywayI. I lowever. if you are 
going to spend $20,000-plus on tuition, invest 
!'our of your years as a young adult and devnl­
op relalionships with others, then I certainly 
hope that you arc cont,mt with where you are. 
If not. then possibly another place would be 
more acceptabl,i than Notre Dame. 
In a personal account (and this is even 
shared with one ofmy friends here on cam­
pus), I originally came from anotlmr school 
before coming to Notre Dame. I was unhappy 
with my former location. so I lel't. despite pres­
sures to stay. Why? I was not suited for tlrn 
place. The sanrn may unfortunately be said 
here. 
In genPral, I think this is all just stupid. For 
me. it's not an issue about morals and lmmani­
tatarianism. but. that it really is insignificant 
when it all comes down to it. Both sides won't 
make peace. and they waste energy pursuing a 
fruitless war of words. Maybe I am upsetting 
some by my indifference. but I am at peace. 
What can be said of you?

Students successful in work for release of death row inmate 
EVANSTON. Ill. 
Less than 72 hours after five Medill students and David Protess. a prol'essor. presented prosecutors with evidence to clear convicted murdArer Anthony Porter, he was released from prison so quickly it surprised even his supporters. 
''I've never sern it happen that fast," Protess said. 
Trying to talk above the noise of his family laughing, Porter, 44. said it was "exhilarating" to be released after spending almost 17 years on death row for a murder he didn't commit. 
'Tm trying to find a word for how it feels," Porter said. "It was like, Tm free."' 
Juggling calls from reporters and well-wishers, Porter found time on his third night ()f freedom to join his family for dinner at Old Country Buffet. 


"Right now, I'm planning to go to bed," he said Sunday night. "I'll make more plans as soon as I get used to being free." 
Porter was convictod of shooting to death teenagers Jr:rry Ilillard and Marilyn Grnen in 1982 in Chicago's Washington Park. In September 1998, Porter was 48 hours away from being exccutl'd. 
lie narrowly missed that execution because his attorney, Dan Sanders. argued to llrn Illinois Suprnnrn Court that Porter's IQ of' :>1 rendered him unable to undnrstand his death snn­tence. 
The stLidonts in Protess' class took on the Porter case Fall Quarter as investigative reporters. /\l'ter re­enacting the crime in November, they came to believe Porter was innocent. 
With Urn assistancs ol' Chicago pri­vate invostigator Paul Ciolino. thny tracked down MilwaukPP resident /\!story Simon, who confessed Wednesday morning to committing the crime. 
The Cook County state's attorney's office obtained a warrant Saturday night f'or Urn arrnsts of Simon and liis estranged wifr, Inez Jackson. who told students in a vidcotap(\d interview .Jan. 29 that slrn was with Simon at thn timn of' llrn murdnrs.

BERKELEY, Calif'. 
A University of California at Berkeley student died early yesterday morning from hypothermia and heart failure after an avalanche buried him in more than thrce feet or snow for six hours near Donner Summit. Malcolm Ilart. 21. was hik­ing with a friend and twG other LJC-Bnrkeley students Saturday .afternoon near Lake Mary when an unexpected avalanche trapped them. said Nevada County Sheriff Sgt. Bill Evans. After the victims were freed from the snow at about 
10:30 p.m. Saturday, Hart was found fully conscious and mobile. Within minutes, howcwer. he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Evans said. Doctors at Tahoe Fornst Hospital in Truckee, Calif., worked for three hours to resus­citate Ilart. but efforts failed, and he was pronounced dead at 3:21 a.rn. The other th1'ee avalanche victims. UC-Berknley students Derck Lerch and Itarry Eichelberger and Chico rns­ident Marissa Nelson, were treated for hypothermia. 
¦ UtJJVERsnv OF t\JEBRASKA Classroom still contains remains 
LfNCOLN, 1\Jeb. 
Morn American Indian remains were found in 109 Bessey Hall after the room was supposed to have bnen cleared of all such remains last April, Anthropology Department Chairman Robert Hitchcock said. It was the second time in a little more than a year that American lndian remains had been found in the room. Tribal repre­sentatives have alleged that those remains had been stored and studied there illegally by a University of Nebraska-Lincoln anthropology associate professor. That professor, Karl Reinhard, along with Hitchcock, professor Peter Bleed and researcher Berkley Bailey, joined a mem­ber of' the University Police on Friday to formally clear the room of teaching materials. Arts and Sciences Associate Dean Michael Steinman was also present. The group was preparing to seal the room so it could be blessed by American Indian spiritual leaders.·

As a gnneral rule of thumb. Mahony said. Hoemor will not appirnr at a "bipartisan" prnss conference as the only Democrat with a group of Hepuhlicans. 
"\,Vhcn you're open with people and honest, people will generally respect that," Mahony said in ref~ crcnce to some of Roomer's more Hcpublir.an positions. 
Because of the conservative nature of Roomer's Indiana dis­trict. most rank and file members understand when hA deviates from party line positions. While House Representatives generally understand such prndicaments, party leadership is morn likely to play "hardball" when their mem­bers stray, she explained. 
"[Majority Whip] Mr. Delay has been known as particularly vin­dictive," Mahony said. She cited Delay's lashing out against Hcpublican dissenters on the I louse impeachment vote includ­unfair treatment towards the numerous tickets from Zahm llall. 
"They I the Elnctio11 Committee] pretty mud1 said, "We don't want you to win," said Costigan.. "It seemed that they had their hand-picked ('.andidatc;; already ;;clcr.lcd. It was in mv constitutional rights to caII fo,: Ia rPcmmtl."

iug Representative Peter King from New York, also a Notre Dame alumnus, as evidence that party leaders bave not been as willing as Republicans to attack their own members. 
"There's nothing that mobilizes yon like being down," she said. As a minority in Congress, the Democrats have found them­
, selves very supportive of each other. 
That may not continue to be the case if the Democrats win back the congressional majority in the year 2000. 
While minority leader Dick Gephardt has kept the Democratic representatives together, wnro they to regain the majority status, that cohesion may dissolve. 
Remarks from Mass. Senator Ted Kennedy, alleging that mod­erates are "wi~hy-washy" and do not know what they stand for, may be the type of inner party division in store for Democrats if they win back the Congress. 
And, in Mahony's words, "That's not helpful."

Againsl a tablr.au of' haunting images -a riderless white stallion. a sea of sodrkn black !lags, a pale queen in tears and a simplP whiti\ burial shroud -.Jordan's bnlovcd King Hussein was laid to rest Monday undnr a gray-veiled sky. 
Dignitaries and lcad11rs from all over the world -some from states sworn lo enmity -lionized tho king, a testa­ment to tlrn enormous staturn that belied llusscin's status as tlw monarch ol' a small and unassuming desert kingdom who prnadrnd pmu:r. in a turbulr.nt region. 
Tim runeral produccid some stunning sccnr.s or rnconcilia­tion. including a handshake lrntwnen a radical Palestinian gunrrilla lr.adr.r and lsnwli l'rnsidont Eznr Wcizman. Naycf llawalmr.h's guerrillas commandeered a school in Maalot in 1974, a hostage opnration that killr.d 24 Israelis. 
The king was buried 011 a clay dominatml by exlraordinary inrngns. Ordinary Jordanians vinwcd Jlusscdn morn as a l'atlwr than a monarch, and wept from tho hnart. Gricf­strkkPn, limy pnltml his coflin with llownrs. Police had to strain lo hold back surging crowds sneking a (inal glimpse or flussnin. 
Echoing llw poignancy or Lim procnr.dings was the appc\,u·ant·n of tlrn king's riderlnss white, stallion and Noor, Uw /\nwrican-born qurn•n, glirnpsnd briPlly in thn palace

Some of the hundrmls of' dignitarins altnnding put aside prnssing problems to hasten to Amman: impnachmnnt­shadowed President Clinton, who led a dnlngation of' tlmw former /\mcrican prnsidnnts, and ailing Hussian l'rnsidPnt Boris Yeltsin, who spent only a few hours in .Jordan lwforc flying back to Moscow.

Political party proclaims corruption 
i\SSOCl.\'fh[) !'HESS 
CHILPANCINGO 
Mexico's main leftist party. appar­ently a narrow loser in a key guher­natnrin I race, called th1• el<'etion "thl' most corrupt" in tho history of Gunrrcro state and d1Jma.ntled Monday that it bo n.nnullNI. 
With 98 pcrceut of thn voto count­
ed, llw lh•mo<.:ratic Hevolution Partv 
had rrn:nivn~I 47.(1 percent to thr. in ('.ll m bent. Inst.itutional 
Hevolutionary Party's 4().9 percent. 
Tl11i lnstit111ional B\ivolut.ionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym PIU, has dominated l\1cxican politics l'or 70 wars. 
Mis.int Mndrano, Dnmocra.tic Hevolution's representative on the StatB lilectoral Council. said some 
voling stations rnportnrl suspiciously high turnout rates. Ile claimnd tho PHI had bought votes and exceeded campaign spending limits, .. 
"Tho oloction in which we partic­ipated ... is the most corrupt election • 

that has been seen in the historv of Gt1Pl'rero," Medrano said Monday at a council meeting. 
PHI insisted voting had been fair and urged all parties to rntil'y the nlnclion of its candidatn R<'nf' Juarez. Electoral officials also called the vote fa.ir. 
Many in Guorrero worrkd that th<' dis1rntll could lead to trouble in the state where the left.isl l'opular H1:vnl11lionary Army look up lll'llls in 191)6 to demand political rof'orms. l{obt•rto Torres /\guirre, tlw !'Hi's delP-ga.te on the· ~ouneil,urg!-ld Dnrnocratic Hovolution "to net with the responsibility which we should all have ut this moment." · "ft is not only whr.n rnsults am favorable that democracy works. but when Hie will of the people is truly recogniwd," Torres said. 
The Domocratil; Revolution's national president. Manuel Lopez Obrador, said the party would inves­tigato the results and that candidato Felix Salgado wo:1ld restart his cam­
paign torally support. "lle'II go I.own to town." 1.opt!Z Obrador said to applausn from support<•rs at cam­
paign lwadquartnrs. 
Thn election was a minor moralP boost f"or thi• PHI lrnf'nrP tlrn 2000 presidential clec!ion. which is likely to hn one of the closest. in Moxicun history. 
In 1')97, thn PHI lost t:onlrol of the lower house of Congress in addition to losing Mnxico City's mayoral rarP, both for tho first limn. l.asl v0ar, tho party won seven of JO gulrn.rnatorial elPctions. 
On Sunday, a rocnnt PB! dnf'nctor, Leonel Cota, won the ~ovornorship oJ' tlrn srrrnll northwest.nrn st.at,, or Baja California Sur for DemcH:ratic Hcvolution. Preliminary results shownd him leading 54.£, percent to 3 <, 1rn r 1'. en t o v n r his P H I r i v a I , Antonio Manriquez. 
It \','as the third time in tho past. y«~a.r that Dernocral.ic llevolution won a governorship with a cnnclidatn who had buen first rejected by the PHI.

¦ LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Americans Tired of 
Impeachment Trial 
and it's not Due 
to Ignorance 
Brandon Wtlliams ("Surl"s Up," Feb. 41 thinks that Amoricans are "presumptuous" because 60 percent of them want the Senate to get the impeachment trial ovor with, wlrnn only l 9 porcm1t of them havll bP!ln following Urn trial r.losely, 1u·cording to a Nm.v York Timos poll. To act in ignorance on such grave matt('rs, Williams concludes, is a dangM to the nipublic; we should avoid giving crcdonco to public opinicm whon ii is so uninl"omrnd. 
He might want to road tho Now York Times story morn caroful­ly. 
First; The story did say tl1<1t only nineteen ptirc1mt of respon­dents wero following the trial closely. But it also said that 44 purcent had been following it "somewhat,'' with 2') pnrcPnt fol­lowing "not too closely." (Civon that the vast majority of the trial hasn't been broadcast. on Urn four major non-r.ablf'\ networks, I don't find that surprising.I As for th£' penchant for making unin­formed judgments on this matter: the majority ol' respondents preferred not to express an opinion about tlrn major r.ongrPssion­al players in the impeachment process, because tlrny didn't know
'HECOMPLAINS THAT POLLS ARE TREATED AS 
AN "AUTHORITATIVE DEITY CALI.ED 'THE 
PEOPLE,'" AND THEN CLAIMS THAT IN FACT, THE 
ELECTORATE IS INCONSISTENT, PETTY, AND UNIN­
FORMED, So, LET'S REPLACE THE AUTHORITATIVE 
DEITY OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE AUTHORITY OF 
BRANDON WILLIAMS, WHO SEEMS TO KNOW MORE 
ABOUT THE STATE OF THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE 
AND WHAT IT SHOUI.D CARE ABOUT THAN IT DOF.S ITSELF•. ' 
very much about who tlw players wnrn. Now, it's too bad that so fow people knew anything about folks like TrPnl Lott and Henry Hyde, and along with Williams, I find such ignorance unfortu­nate. But, since the respondents were evidirntly willing to admit their ignorance and forego criticism in this case, it doos seem that Williams's fears of premature judgment am a bit . ., pmma­ture. 
Second: to equate not l'ollowing thP trial v,.ith lrning ignorant or the issues is a prntty big leap, given the rclontlnss covnragf' we've had over the last weeks -er, months -111-, yf'ar. The trial itself is largely a rehashing ol' i8sues and testimony that havo hmm in public view for months now. Perhaps it's not surprising that seventy-five percent of the NYT poll respondents said they hadn't learned anything new from th1! Senate trial. Most of them, howevtw, were familiar r.nough with the proc<idural issuns in the Senate to marticulatc an intnlligent position on the need for wit­nesses -whether pro or con. It's not dear to mo that they're as uninformed as Williams thinks they am. 
But still, the tired refrain echoes on: the only reason thn poopln want the trial to be over is because they don't understand the issues involved. At its best, this view is patronizing. <ispecially whnn articulated by memhnrs or thl' mndia, whos11 rnporling on this affair has been atrocious. At its worst, as roprPsontml by thr Ann Coulter school (ii' vou don't think thn l'nisidnnt desPrves cunviction, you don't ,indersland llrn issuiis}, it's dnngProus. Indeed, I suspPct tlrn latter view poses a much greater clangor to the republic than the public's exasperation with the whole Lewinsky affair, beeause it denies tlw possibility or niusoned ytit opposing positions. Williams isn't guilty of' advocating that posi­tion, but his assumption that public disgust with tlw trial sterns from ignorance is arrog,tnt and ... presumptuous. He rnmplains that polls am troat<1d as an ''authoritativo dnity i:allfld 'tho p(l()­plt,, "' and then claims that in fact, tlrn clectorato is inconsistent, petty. and uninformed. So, let's replace the authoritulive doil.y ol' Urn people with the authority of Brandon Williams, who snems lo know more about the state of tlw Anrnrir.:tn elcctontto and what it should care about than it does itself. Or did I miss the irony hfl1·e? 
I don't wish to trivialize Williams's conr,orns abo11t tho uso of polls in American politics, or to minimize the potential danger presented by those who clnim to sp(~ak for the pnople. I do wish to make dear what Williams apparnntly missnd in the Nnw York Times story: if Americans are tired of llrn whole impeachmPnt affair, it's not necessarily due to ignorance. 
Kudos to Williams for not rushing to judgment. on whntlwr Urn Pnisident should be thrown out. H's unfortunate lw can't give thr sa.mc consideration to tlrn American pcop!B. ·

Some students brought their siblings from high school to Bridget's. Other juniors went there with tlwir parents alfor Junior Parnnt's Wrekend. FriPnds celebrated twenty-first birthdays at Bridget's, and every llalloween students dressed up in costumes to celebrate t.hcre. Under-classmen lined up at the door and started to dance as soon as they heard the D.J, blast Come on Ride Thal Train or /,et me Clear My Throat ..

Olympic lnvestigation::Jieepens 
SALT !AKE CITY 
Tho city's own investigation into the Olympic bribery scandnl could provide answers to ques­tions many people in Salt Lake City are asking: Who knew what and when. 
On Tuesday, a report will be issued on the second of five investigations into the payments of cash and freBbies to International Olyinpic Committee members. 
Unlike the IOC commission report that last month focused on IOC members. the closely guarded report by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics panel looks into the role Utah Olympic boosters played in seek­ing the 2002 Winter Games. 
What hcgan as a tip to a local TV station about a scholarship for an IOC membu's child in November has grown into the biggest Olympics corruption scandal in history. 
Four IOC members have resigned, five have been ousted by the IOC executive board and must fight to remain on thfl IOC, one was admonished, and three are still being investigated. 
IOC investigators said they had found $800,000 in illicit cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and travel expenses from Salt Lake to 14 IOC members. The ethics panel reportedly has identified even more questionable spending, inclµding reimbursements to employers who gave jobs to IOC member relatives. for a total of more than $1 million. 
Gov. Mike Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff say they do not expect the report to show any new broad categories of misdeeds. It is to be given the SLOC executive corn milter! at 10 
a.m. EST and the SLOC board of trustees and public at noon EST on Tuesday. 
But the document is expected to answer whether the lavish spending truly was the work of just a few bid executives, as Leavitt claims. or Wa.«; endorsed by business leaders who served on tlie committee. Mayor Deedee Corradini or Leavitt himself, as bid and former SLOC President Torn Welch claims. 
Welch and.Dave Johnson, who worked with Welch to win the giunes. have been bfamiid up fo now for the excesses. Leavitt has described a deliberate coverup 
'IFJT CONCENTRATFS ON 
THEIR END AND GIVES 
THE FACTS, THAT HELPS US 
ON OUR END. I HOPE WE 
CAN AVOID ENDLF.SS FINGER­
POINTING,' 
D!Ck. POUNfJ lac VICE-PRESIDENT ON THE IOC INVEST/GATlON 
by a small group of executives who kept lavish spending hid­den. 
The governor said last week he gave only small gifts of proto­col and knew of nothing more. 
PrAnk Joklik, the volunteer chairman of. the bid committee who fater became SLOC presi­dent, said he and other business leaders on the bid board had been "screened" from the details and that he was dis­mayed to learn about the exces­sive spending. 
Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive on Jan. 8, the same day he demanded the resigna­tion of Johnson, who had become senior vice president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the $500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was given whPJl he resigned as president in niid.•1997 amid a spousal abuse charge. 

Cornmittoe members Spence · Eccles and Ver! Topham have saiii they were deceived, Corradini has said little about hei'role.

Besides lhe investigations by 
the 10G and SLOC ethics panel, 
three others into the Salt Lake 
scandal have been announced:

law; one by the U.S. Olympic

ib.CVice President Dick · Pound said Monday the Salt Lake panel's report may help advance the IOC investigation. · 
'"They have seen a lot of docu­ments we have not seen and talked. with a lot of people we have not talked to, so it may be quite helpful," he said. "ff it con­centrates on their end and gives thefa.c:ts, .that helps us on our end.Jhopewecan avoid end0· Jess tinger~pointing." 
the ethics panel is comprised of Gordon Hall. a former chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court; David Jordan, a former 
U.S attorney for Utah; Patricia Hanna, dean of the University of Utah college of humanities; Barbara Day Lockhart, a two­time Olympic speedskater who now is a Brigham Young University professor; and Merrill Nonnan, a forensic auditor and expeii witness in trials.

rellow freshman A111rn McGrath also put the Irish on the winner's stand with a first placn finish in the 5000 motors. Tlw race was an exciting on,i for McGrath, who earned hPr first. victory in the second race of her career. 
"It was really exciting, a major confidence booster," said McGrath. "l nm~ded to prove it to myself since I was injured during the cross country soa­son." 
Tho women's distance medley relay team completed the evening's trophy-taking with a first place finish at 12;0:t81. 
Despite Friday's slow start, the wr-ekend wouh:I turn out to bn the Irish's most successful cam­paign of thr, season. Saturday's evPnts provided gn~at competi­tion and eight Irish lirst place finishes. 
The women kept up with their winning ways Saturday. adding three morn lirst-placn finish1is to thdr collection. 
Standout .Jennifer Englehardt killed two birds with one stone. provisionally qualifying for tlrn NCAAs while winning tlrn high jump at 5'9 ;{/4". Englehardt's jump was her best indoor mark since the 1997 season. 
Sarah Lopicnski cam1\ out of the woodwork to a first-place finish in the 500 meters at 1:19.88, and teammate l\adia Schmiedt reestablished her rnign with a victory in thn 400 meters. 
Schmicdt, who had been com­monplacP on the winner's stand for the Irish. had not been lrnard from this soason dun to an injury. 
"l was a little surpris,id. I had been hurt and hadn't trained as much. I didn't know what to expect," she said. 
After a rough Friday night, tlw Notre Dame men's squad refused to bo shown up by thdr femal11 countnrparts. As in · weeks pr<'vious, Marshaun West looked to grab tlrn crowd's attention bettering his NCAA qualif"ying timn in the 200 meters by a hundrodth of a scc­ond at :21.16. 
Freshman Pat Conway walked away with his first rollngiatc vic­tory in thn mill'. posting a timn of 4:12.95. 
Conway was happy with his victory but maintaitwd humility: "I felt alright, most of tlw good guys wnrn in the Meyn Miln though, sp I wasn ·1 competing with the Obig dogs.' Also, toam­mat!l Ryan MaxwBll puslwd tlw pace and made the racn for me." 
Thn final running victory was clainrnd by Phil Mishka in thn 1000 mntnrs. IIn botternd fivn of his tnammatns with u time of' 2:27.!i(i. Mishka is tlrn lrish's middle distancP utility man, run­ning any rac:<i in a rangn between 400 m<\lPrs and 1000 meters. lln admits this makPs f'or dif1ir.ult training. 
"It's a uniqtw b!Prul. you need t)nduranc1\ but also spnnd mixnd in with it," lw said. 
Mishka's training will be ca!IPd on during tlrn Big l•:ast champi­onships. wlwrP lw could run as many as four ntl'PS.

Saint Mary's will not let this weekend's disappointments keep them down as they face two more conference games this week finish out confornnce play. 
They dropped two more tough league games to Calvin College, 62-45, and to Alma College, 83­58. 
Their two point guards, Julie Norman and Kelly Jones contin­ue lo give it their all and are consequcmtly among the league leaders in many categories. Dr.spite the often trying season, both guards stand among the top of tho league in total points scored. 
"It has been a rough season," said head coach Dave Roeder. ."My guards did well this week­end. though. and they deserve credit." 
Besides being potent on olfense, Norman and Jones pro­vide much defensive support. Jones leads the league in blocked shots and Norman is fourth in the league in steals. .Jones also is in the lop ten rebounders and percnntage 
shooters  in  tlrn  Michigan  
Intercollegiate  Athletic  
Organization,  

Norman's offensive strength lies in her three pointers, for which she is among the top tnn league leaders. Tlrnse players. along with the rest of the team, hopn to put togetlrnr all their possibilities next season and show the MIM what they can do with a little experinnce. 

Saturday and Sunday illuslrat­nd the Relles' youth once again and wern tough games from thn start. Oncn again, however, Norman and .Jones had success­fu I games. Norman and .Jonns scornd 17 and 15 pts. Hespectively vnrsus /\Ima and .Jones had 14 points versus Calvin. 
As has been typical this sea­son, Saint Mary's al\owml them­selves lo fall behind and wnre too far in adnficil to come back to pull it out. The Belles' were behind by 14 points against Calvin and 17 points against Alma at half-limn. These type of deficits arc common for Saint Mary's and are difficult to rebound from. 
Their second half of play was significantly bett,\r in both games, and llrnir opponents l!rngue did not widcrn much. Unfortunately, tlrnir improvnd play was not enough to over­come solid shooting by both Calvin and Alma. Both teams shot over .4!i0 from the lloor and over .600 from the free-throw lino.
