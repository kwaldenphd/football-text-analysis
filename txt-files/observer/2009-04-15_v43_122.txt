StaND Against Hate Week raises awareness 
ByJOHN TIERNEY A'sisranr News Editor 
StaND Against Hate Week began Tuesday with the goal of raising awareness of words and deeds that are powerful, according to Sr. Sue Dunn, the administrative co-chair of Core Council. 
"I think what we hope to do is to try to raise awareness of people's language and actions, which have at times an adverse effect on other members of the community," Dunn said. 
Patrick Tighe, a student assistant at the Gender Relations Center, which is co-sponsoring StaND Against Hate Week, said he hopes it will help bring the University com­munity together. 
"Tho goal is to promote an inclu­sive spirit at Notre Dame, for all members of tho eommunity," Tighe said. 
ReprPsentatives from Core Council. which is the week's primary sponsor, were stationod in LaFortune StudPnt Center and both dining halls Tuesday soliciting signatures for an alJicd plNlgP banner opposing hat1~-speech. according to Dunn. 
The banners can also be signed on Wednosday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30

Hal Prince, winner of 21 Tony Awards and producer and director of over 50 musi­cals, including West Side Story, Phantom of the Opera and Fiddler on the Roof, spoke at Saint Mary's College Tuesday about his "lucky" career and how the theater industry has changed. 
From the time he was 8 years old and saw his first play, Prince "was addicted to the whole habit of going to theater" and right out of col­lege he got his first job in the theater business at the age of 20. 
"I was too scared to look for a job, so I wrote a letter," he said. The letter, which he wrote to George Abbott, read, "I do not know what I could do to earn $25 a week ... so I would like to work for you for nothing. And if you can tell by my performance that you aren't paying me, please fire me." 
That letter sparked Abbott's interest, and Prince was hired to work as an assistant stage manager for no pay for the first six months. 
"I was energetic, incredibly ambitious and l think probably a painful presence to people in the office," he said of his younger self. 
Prince actually had to write the words "Watch it!" on the top of his note pad every day

Free boat ride for one 
Ladies of Notre Dame, imagine the classiest, most elegant celebration you could possibly think of. It's com­plete with fancy dresses, well­dressed (and strikingly attractive) men and downright jovial atmos­phere. 
Now take that 
Sam Werner 
image, put it on a boat (even classier) and you Associate have the 2009 St. Sports Editor Edward's Hall Yacht Dance. 
As The Lonely Island and T-Pain have proven, anything is 124 per­cent better when on a boat. That means that if you thought you had a fun normal awesome SYR, you'll have more than twice as much fun at the St. Ed's Yacht Dance (sorry, though, flippy floppies are not included, and climbing buoys is dis­couraged). 
Now, ladies, I'm sure you're say­ing to yourself, "That sounds awe­some! Too bad all the hot guys are probably taken by now." You are, however, sorely mistaken. One gen­tleman has been waiting for you. Yes, you. 
His name is Paul Macias, and he's everything you eould ask for in a date and then some. I would know -I've lived down the hall from him all year. In addition to being a model R.A., Paul is President Emeritus of St. Ed's. I'm sure you ladies know it pays to have friends in high places. 
Positions and titles are so imper­sonal, though, and Paul is much more than that. A native of Petal, Miss., Paul is a senior history major who, despite his Faeebook relation­ship status, is still looking for the right girl. 
That right girl, though, could be you. 
Look in the mirror right now. See the color of your hair? That's Paul's favorite hair color on a girl! And your eyes are just what he's looking for. 
Paul is an avid mountaineer, spe­cializing in Aggro Crag climbing, and a knowledgeable historian, hav­ing watched nearly every episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple mul­tiple times. He has accomplished more this year, than most people do in a lifetime, leading two teams to NCAA BCS Championships (in the NCAA 09 video game) and captain­ing an Olympie squad (in the St. Ed's Hall Olympics). 
After playing soccer in high school, Paul has stayed in peak physical condition at Notre Dame, leading the St. Ed's soccer and C­team basketball squads to glory. Though his bookstore basketball team bowed out in the first round, Paul scored multiple baskets in a tight loss. 
Paul has been described by some women as "rugged" and "a big teddy bear." Let's face it, ladies, who wouldn't want to go on a date with a big, rugged, teddy bear? 
He's the complete package-an athlete, a scholar, and a gentleman. Contact Paul at pmacias@nd.edu if you're interested (and, really, why wouldn't you be?).

Cash stash in bra stops bullet from piercing heart 
SAO PAULO -Police say a wad of cash stuffed in a woman's bra saved her life during a shootout in north­eastern Brazil. Salvador city police spokesman Vicente de Paula said 58­year-old lvonete Pereira de Oliveira was a passenger on the bus that two gun­men held up on Saturday. 
He said an armed off­duty policeman on the bus opened fire. In the ensuing gunbattle a bullet struck the left side of Oliveira's chest. 
De Paula said Tuesday that the 150 reals (about $70) worth of bills that Oliveira hid inside her bra slowed the bullet enough to prevent it from entering her heart and killing her instantly. 
Oliveira underwent sur­gery to remove the bullet from her left breast and was released from the hos­pital on Monday. 
Suspicious package con­tains leg, not bomb 
HILLSBORO, Ore. -A scary situation turned into a strange one when a bomb squad determined that a suspicious package left outside the Washington County Sheriff's Office contained a prosthetic leg. Sheriff's Sgt. Vance Stimler said deputies called the Portland bomb squad out to Hillsboro Sunday after­noon after noticing a can­vas bag with a cylinder­shaped object sticking out. 
With the help of a robot, the bomb squad quickly discovered the object was not an explosive. 
Stimler said deputies still don't know whose leg was inside the bag, or why it was placed in front of the sheriff's office.

Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame and Baird, an employee-owned international wealth management, capital mar­kets, private equity and asset man­agement firm, have announced a new partnership to provide gradu­ate and undergraduate students with fellowship and scholarship opportunities for the next five years. 
The relationship, which is part of the Notre Dame Corporate Partners for Ethieal Global Leadership pro­gram, annually includes an MBA fellowship, two undergraduate need-based scholarships and fund­ing for a University organization. 
Jay You, a first-year MBA student concentrating in finance, ha.o:; been chosen as the University's first Baird Fellow. Under the fellowship, You will receive $20,000 for his sec­ond year of study and the opportu­nity to work with Baird mentors. 
"Jay is an outstanding choice for the Baird Fellowship," said Brian Lohr, director of MBA admissions at Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. "He's a first-class individ­ual committed to academic excel-there are a few components of the program that are the same at every participating school. 
These include the standard distribution of three different newspapers to the school, access to online academic resources for use in and out of the classroom, marketing and recycling. 
At Notre Dame, the newspa­pers are distributed at six loca­tions, which include North and South dining halls, the LaFortune Student Center, the Mendoza College of Business, the Joyce Center and the Hesburgh Library. 
Schmidt said the dining halls are traditionally the two areas where papers are consumed the fastest, so they are looking into distributing an appropriate amount of papers to those loca­tions. 
There are over 300 local and national newspapers that have partnered with USA Today to bring the program to campuses 
For the upcoming school year, Brellenthin said they are looking to have more frequent contact with Cox so they will be notified when drastic changes occur. 
Brellenthin also said the Schmidt-Weber administration is looking to fill the position of Director of the Collegiate Readership Program, which will be a hands-on manager of the program from the University's end. 
"This [program! is a unique service," Schmidt said. "It is a benefit and convenience for students and will hopefully be sustained."

The African Student Association's (ASA) annual Africa week kicked off yester­day and will continue until Sunday. 
The ASA, the Africa Faith and Justice Network and the Kellogg Institute's Ford Program are sponsoring this year's event. 
Brigitte Githinji, ASA's presi­dent, said the goal of the week­long series of events is to broaden and enhance the Notre Dame community's per­ception of Africa. 
"The event's goal is to teach people about Africa because I think the information they have is kind of skewed," Githinji said. "People make assumptions, and what our club does is inform them that there is progress there; it's not just poverty and disease. We try to give them a more well­rounded view." 
Africa Week is the ASA's sig­nature event, and the group spends all year organizing it. 
"We work all year trying to think of ideas for the week. We start planning the year before and we're just constantly plan­ning," Githinji said. "It's a group effort and the whole club works together in plan­ning it. We form different com­mittees which then come together to work on each day's event."

Group addresses readership issues 
By LIZ O'DONNELL 
News Writer 
The Collegiate Readership Program and student govern­ment's role in contacting the class of 2013 were two items of discussion at Tuesday's Council of Representatives (COR) meet­ing. 
Chief of staff Ryan Brellenthin said the costs for The Chicago Tribune, one of the three news­papers involved in the program, will rise nearly 250 percent an issue next year. 
Brellenthin asked the council for their input on whether or not they believed the paper should be kept as a part of the program, or if they should look into other options. 
Joey Brown, president of the class of 2009, said the commit­tee should possibly look into asking for more money to be put into the budget for the pro­gram. 
Student body president Grant Schmidt said this option may not be feasible due to the tight budget student government is currently on. 
Instead, COR members agreed there is a need for a used paper rack to be added to each of the dining halls. 

With the addition of these racks, it is student govern­ment's hope members of the undergraduate population will recycle papers for later use by other students. 
Overall, the members of the council felt that student govern­ment should look into options other than cutting the Chicago Tribune out of the program. 
"Current usage demonstrates that people use the paper," stu­dent body vice president Cynthia Weber said in reference to the per day usage, which is estimated at 272 copies. 
The Chicago Tribune is the least consumed out of the three newspapers in the Collegiate Readership Program at Notre Dame, with students consuming an average of 394 copies of the New York Times per day as well as 401 copies of USA Today. 
COR members also looked at ways in which student govern­ment could reach out to mem­bers of the class of 2013 before they came to campus during the meeting. 
"It would be beneficial for us to contact the new freshmen," Schmidt said. "This is like a sort of branding thing for student government." 

~ 

President of Judicial Council Ian Secviar said it was impor­tant for members of student government to reach out so new students would have a chance to understand what the organization was all about. 
"It is important that we are changing their opinions early and often," Secviar said. "We are leaders and need a united front." 
One of the ways the council discussed contacting the incom­ing class was to place a student government card inside one of the various organization pack­ets students receive before coming to campus. 
Class of 2010 president Chris Tillett said the group should explore the possibility of send­ing out an e-mail. 
Gus Gari, the director of external affairs said student government should look into the idea of creating a logo specifically for student govern­ment. 
"The logo would give us a way of branding ourselves like the Student Union Board has," said Gari. "It would bring everything that we do together."

Ex-Ill. governor pleads not guilty 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Ousted Gov. Rod Blagojevich pleaded not guilty to racketeering and fraud charges Tuesday, defiantly embarking on a long journey to clear his name but facing seri­ous money problems and with­out a team of lawyers in place. 
"I'm glad this process has finally begun," the impeached former governor told the media throng that spilled into the street in front of the court­house after he and his brother, Robert, were arraigned on cor­ruption charges. 
"It's the end of the beginning in one respect but it's the beginning of another aspect" of the case, Blagojevich said. "That is the beginning of me being able to prove and clear my name and be vindicated of what are inaccurate allega­tions." 
Blagojevich, 52, is charged with scheming to sell President Barack Obama's former U.S. Senate seat, attempting to extort campaign money from companies seeking state busi­ness and plotting to use the financial muscle of the gover­nor's office to pressure the Chicago Tribune to fire editori­al writers calling for his impeachment. The accusations led to his ouster as governor, but he repeated Tuesday what he has been saying for months -that he is not guilty. 
The former governor appeared to be in his element as the focus of a major political story yet again. He chatted amiably with reporters, and when one television camera­man stood atop a concrete pil­lar outside the courthouse to get a shot from above, he oblig­ingly looked up and smiled. 
Blagojevich was arrested Dec. 9 after authorities said he was heard on FBI wiretaps dis­cussing swapping the Obama seat for a Cabinet post, a new job or campaign money. A fed­eral grand jury returned a 19­count indictment April 2 that alleges corruption beginning before Blagojevich even took office. 
At the 10-minute arraign­ment, Blagojevich and the only attorney currently on his case, longtime friend Sheldon Sorosky, entered a plea of not guilty. 
U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel then started a sequence of legal maneuvers that attor­neys said would most likely lead to a Blagojevich trial a year or two down the road. Blagojevich faces charges including racketeering conspir­acy, wire fraud, extortion con­spiracy, attempted extortion and making false statements. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
Prosecutors must give the defense team mounds of docu­ments and recordings made over years of investigation. Defense attorneys can then be expected to ask Zagel to throw out much of it. 
"The circumstances of these wiretaps hasn't been flushed out yet," said DePaul University law professor Leonard Cavise. "We can expect all kinds of motions to suppress evidence. They will challenge the war­rants. They will challenge whether the government had probable cause to tap Blagojevich's home and cam­paign office phones. 
The sheer bulk of evidence defense attorneys must sift through makes it all the more important for Blagojevich to assemble a full legal team quickly. 
"It's just not possible for just one lawyer to defend Mr. Blagojevich, no matter who that lawyer may be," Sorosky told the judge. 
The lack of a legal team can be traced to a lack of money. 
Sorosky told Zagel he is seek­ing prosecutors' permission to tap Blagojevich's $2 million campaign fund to pay addition­al attorneys because much more legal muscle is needed to mount an adequate defense. Outside of court, Sorosky said even that money won't be enough. 
Sorosky recalled that the blue-chip law firm of Winston & Strawn had defended former Gov. George Ryan on racketeer­ing and fraud charges and that chief counsel Dan K. Webb esti­mated the total cost at millions of dollars. Winston & Strawn defended Ryan for free, but no big-name lawyers are lining up to do the same for Blagojevich. 
"What was it that Jerry Maguire said?" Sorosky said as he entered a coffee shop across from the courthouse still trailed by reporters and cameras. 
"Show me the money," a tele­vision reporter yelled out. 
One of the city's top criminal lawyers, Edward M. Genson, had been Blagoejvich's chief defense counsel. But he resigned after the former gov­ernor was deaf to Genson's entreaties to stop sounding off on television interview shows. 
Genson law partner Terence 
P. Gillespie announced more than a month later that he would be stepping in. But he had to withdraw because he had previously represented a Blagojevich co-defendant, Springfield millionaire William Cellini. 
Attention has recently focused on the possibility that veteran defense attorney Thomas Breen might be brought in. But no agreement has been reached so far. 
Robert Blagojevich, a self­employed real estate investor, told reporters after entering his not guilty plea that he was "prepared to cope with the charges and work through them." 
His attorney, Michael Ettinger, acknowledged the case has put stress on the brothers' relationship. Rod Blagojevich brought his brother on to head his campaign fund after federal prosecutors began investigating an earlier fund chairman, businessman Christopher G. Kelly. 
"Everything is going to work out between the two of them and obviously the type of situa­tion they're both in, it's a little strain, but everything's fine," Ettinger said. 
Kelly and Cellini are to be arraigned Thursday, as is co­defendant John Harris, a for­mer Blagojevich chief of staff whose attorneys have said is cooperating in the govern­ment's investigation. Another former chief of staff, Alonzo Monk, is to be arraigned next week.

North Korea restarts nuclear program 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea said Tuesday it was restarting its rogue nuclear program, booting U.N. inspectors and pulling out of disarmament talks in an angry reac­tion to U.N. Security Council condemnation of its April 5 rocket launch. 
Pyongyang ordered U.N. nuclear inspectors to remove seals and cameras from its Yongbyon nuclear site and leave the country as quickly as possible, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. 
North Korea told the IAEA it was "immedi­ately ceasing all cooperation" and "has decided to reactivate all facilities and go ahead with the reprocessing of spent fuel," according to a statement from the U.N. agency. 
U.S. journalist retained in Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran-Iran said Tuesday its national security court put an American journalist on trial behind closed doors on allegations she spied for the U.S.-a charge Washington calls baseless. 
The unusually swift one-day trial threat­ened to anger the U.S. at a time when the Obama administration is showing willingness to engage its longtime adversary after many years of rocky relations. 
Roxana Saberi, a 31-year-old dual American-Iranian citizen, was arrested in late January and initially accused of working without press credentials. But an Iranian judge leveled a far more serious allegation against her last week, charging her with spy­ing for the United States.

Harsh 'sexting' penalties revisited 
MONTPELIER -Parents, school districts and law enforcement have been grappling with what to do with teenagers who take sexually explicit photos of themselves with their cell phone cameras and send them to friends. 
Vermont legislators are moving to get rid of one option: child pornography counts that result in lifetime listings on the state's Internet sex offender registry. 
Legislation passed by the Vermont Senate and pending in the House would remove the most serious legal .consequences for teenagers who engage in "sexting." The bill would carve out an exemption from prosecu­tion for child pornography for 13-to 18-year­olds on either the sending or receiving end of sexting messages, so long as the sender vol­untarily transmits an image of himself or herself. 
\\Omen aocused of staging take funerals 
LOS ANGELES -It was quite a send-off for Jim Davis, or so the people paying his funer­al bills were led to believe. 
They were told Davis was laid to rest at Abbey Memorial Park in Compton after being placed in an ornate, top-of-the-line casket lined with elaborate floral arrangements. Altogether, the bill to bury Davis at the palm­lined cemetery came to nearly $31,000. 
But there was a problem: There was no Jim Davis. He was dreamed up by a group of scam artists, authorities say.

Alcohol tax proposal taken from bill 
INDIANAPOLIS -Alcohol taxes would double only in Marion County -not the whole state ­under a plan advanced by the Indiana Senate. 
The Senate on Tuesday made several changes to a bill aimed at rescuing the Indianapolis Capital Improvement Board, which expects to be $4 7 million short in its operation of the city's professional sports stadiums and convention center. 
The revised Senate plan would allow Marion County to raise its alcohol, car rental, hotel and ticket taxes with the extra cash going to the board. But the revised plan wouldn't double alcohol taxes statewide as previously proposed.

Somali pirates continue hijack spree 
Bandits take more than 60 hostages, seize four more ships on Tuesday 
Associated Press 
MOMBASA -Somali pirates were back to busi­ness as usual Tuesday, defiantly seizing four more ships with 60 hostages after U.S. sharpshooters rescued an American freighter captain. "No one can deter us," one bandit boasted. 
The freed skipper, Richard Phillips, will return home to the United States on Wednesday, after reuniting with his 19-man crew in the Kenyan port of Mombasa, according to the shipping company Maersk Line Ltd. 
The brigands grabbed more ships and hostages to show they would not be intimidated by President Barack Obama's pledge to confront the high-seas ban­dits, according to a pirate based in the Somali coastal town of llarardhere.

Obama 's stance on the protection of life -includ­ing issues like abortion and stem-cell research -are seen by some to be in viola­tion of a 2004 Lnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops document titled "Catholics in Political Life." 
In his March 29 statement, D' Arcy wrote: "President Obama has recently reaf­firmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long­stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred. While claiming to separate politics from science, he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government, for the first time in history, into supporting direct destruc­tion of innocent human life." 

According to an April 11 South Bend Tribune report, a spokesperson for the dio­cese office named the anti­Notre Dame and anti-Obama protest scheduled for 10 
a.m. Good Friday in Fort Wayne, which was organ­ized by anti-abortion activist Randall Terry, as one of the demonstrations in question. 
Although Terry's efforts were not specifically men­tioned in D' Arcy's state­ment, Terry released a response on his Web site, stopobamanotredame.com, accusing the bishop of issu­ing contradictory statements on the Obama controversy. 
According to the South Bend Tribune report, Terry's Good Friday demon­stration drew at least 10 participants.

Malpass said card check neu­trality is a method in which employees are required to obtain 50 percent plus one of employee's signatures on a card to be recognized as a union by the company.

Executive pleads guilty in URS tax case 
MIAMI-The second U.S. citizen charged in wide-ranging tax probe of Swiss banking giant UBS AG pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing a false tax return to conceal a secret account at the Swiss bank holding more than $3 million 
Robert Moran, president of Fort Lauderdale­based Moran Yacht and Ship, entered the plea in federal court the same day the single charge was unsealed. Moran, who reached a plea deal with prosecutors, faces up to three years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines when sentenced on June 26. 
Prosecutors said Moran, 57, failed on his 2007 U.S. tax return to report his interest in a UBS account and did not report any income earned on the account, which was in the name of a Panamanian shell company called Winter Drive Investments. 
Moran is the second U.S. citizen charged since February, when UBS turned over dozens of names of account holders suspected of con­cealing income from the Internal Revenue Service in a deferred prosecution agreement. A Boca Raton accountant currently free on $12 million bail is scheduled to enter a plea next week to similar charges. 
Deere to reorganize, cut 200 jobs 
PITTSBURGH -Deere & Co. said Tuesday it plans to combine operations that make its iconic green and yellow tractors with another unit that manufactures products like riding lawn mowers, resulting in about 200 job cuts. 
The world's largest maker of farm machin­ery said the restructured unit will help it bet­ter meet customer needs, cut costs and boost global sales of products like riding mowers. Sales of such products have tumbled as the global economic downturn has slowed spend­ing and made it harder to get loans. And while Deere's farm machinery sales have been strong, the company has slashed its 2009 earnings outlook. 
The company's agricultural equipment divi­sion, with sales of about $3.26 billion, accounted for about 63 percent of total rev­enue for the first quarter ended Jan. 31, while sales of $558 million from its commer­cial and consumer equipment unit represent­ed some 11 percent.

Obamatempers economic optimism 
President believes his broad domestic agenda zs the path to recovery 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Aiming to assert control over the nation's economic debate, President Barack Obama on Tuesday warned Americans eager for good news that "by no means are we out of the woods" and argued his broad domestic agenda is the path to recovery. 
In a speech at Georgetown University, Obama aimed to juggle his recent glass-half­full takes on the economy with a determination to not be stamped as naive in the face lingering problems. He summarized actions his administration has taken to steady the limping economy and coupled that with a fresh overview of his domes­tic goals. 
The speech, which key aides had signaled in advance would not contain any major announcements, came as Obama nears his symbolic 100-day mark in office, important because that has become a tradition­al marker by which to judge new administrations. 
"There is no doubt that times are still tough," Obama said. "But from where we stand, for the very first time, we are beginning to see glimmers of hope. And AP

Prince eventually went on to direct his own musicals, but "knew that I had yet to express my own voice, and my own voice was pretty dark." 
After going to Russia for vaca­you," Prince said. "I found a voice." 

"You might think that it's all been gravy, but it hasn't," Prince said. "There've been long dry patches in my lifetime . . . but I've outlasted it." 
Prince said a key component in his success as a producer and director has been luck.

shows, the industry revives old ones, he said. 
Despite his numerous suc­cessful shows, ''I'm certain that not one of those shows could raise the necessary funding to be produced today," he said. "It's easy to revive something that you wouldn't put on in the first place, which is a very painful irony." 
However, Prince said eco­nomic change might end up being beneficial. 
"We need to have a moment to go back and think what made the theater what it was at its best," Prince said. And due to the economic change, "that's happening right now." 
However, he said his work with young people has taught him that the upcoming genera­tion is "ambitious, disciplined, excited and scared, as they should be, of the future." 
Prince ended on a serious note, however. 
"I really do feel privileged to be born in an earlier time," Prince said. "What I dearly hope is that we can relive that again. You can argue with me if you want, but it's how I feel. It's passionate. I really feel it."

Through the provision of clinical care and subsistence support, through the imple­mentations of HIV transmis­sion prevention programs, and through the promotion of 
global social responsibility, [TTLF strives] to catalyze processes of healing and hope for the children of Lesotho and the greater international community." 
Megan Towle, Notre Dame '07, told The Observer in a February 2007 article the Foundation's main goals are providing children a safe home, serving as an outreach program, preventing mother­to-ehild transmission of IIIV and offering academic research opportunities for students regarding the for­mation of partnerships with international non-govern­mental organizations.

NY Gov. to legalize gay marriage 
Associated Press 
ALBANY, N.Y.-New York Gov. David Paterson plans to introduce legislation this week to legalize same-sex marriage, reviving a bill that died in 2007 and still faces strong opposition despite a new Democratic majority in the state Senate. 
Paterson, talking to reporters Tuesday in Hempstead, N.Y. said "there is clearly a problem" when gays and lesbians in civil unions are denied 1,200 to 1,350 civil protections such as health care and pension rights because they're not married. 
"The timing was always right. It's just who is willing to take that step, and I am," Paterson said. "l think it is, as other states are showing, the only ethical way to treat peo­ple who want to live together in peace under the civil law. So my general feeling about all these issues is the right ethical decision will inevitably be the right political decision." 
In radio interviews last week Paterson said he believes it will eventually become law. But polls show legalizing gay marriage remains controver­sial in New York. And some gay marriage advocates are worried that bringing the issue up in New York before there's clear support to pass it could set back efforts to legal­ize it there, as well as in other states. 

Assemblyman Daniel O'Donnell, a Manhattan Democrat, said he will attend Thursday's announcement and sponsor the governor's bill, which will be identical to the one backed by then Gov. Eliot Spitzer as a civil-rights meas­ure when it passed the Assembly 85-61 two years ago. "''m hoping to do better than that this time," O'Donnell said Tuesday. 
"''m very happy the gover­nor has made this a priority," O'Donnell said. "When we got the bill from Governor Spitzer in 2007, we didn't have the votes either. I did that in 2007 and I intend to do that again in 2009." 
The Democrat-controlled Assembly passed the bill with three Republicans voting in favor, as well as some Democrats who faced criticism in their upstate districts for their support. It died in the Senate, where the Republican majority kept it from going to a vote. 
Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith supports the measure but still doesn't believe there are enough votes to pass it, spokesman Austin Shafran said. The Democrats have a 32-30 majority. 
"Most significantly, an issue of this importance demands more than a symbolic gesture and empty rhetoric," Shafran said, acknowledging the Senate doesn't have to act on a bill just because it was introduced. "We are commit­ted to the process of securing the votes for passage of mar­riage equality, and as the leader has said in the past, it will pass as soon as we have those votes." 
Mark Hansen, spokesman for the Senate Hepublicans, said Tuesday that, "Our con­ference is opposed to gay mar­riage and that has not changed." 
"I think this is an attempt to gain momentum," said the Rev. Jason McGuire, legisla­tive director of' New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, which opposes the measure. "But the simple reality is this is a very controversial issue, especially with this talk about the Senate majority being as razor thin as it is."

We are legend 
Early last semester, fellow colum­nisVconcerned citizen/love guru Bob Kessler penned an am using and provocative piece on the Saint Mary's Executive Board stipend. In it, he sug­gested a few alter­
nate uses for the $20,000 usually dis­tributed to the Board's members, among them build­ing a beer fort and installing bidets in the dorms (I support the dorm room 

ball pit initiative, Brad Blomstrom 
for the record}. Things were pre­
sumably resolved The Daft Punk following the con­troversy, and the world went on spinning as usual 0 say 
"presumably" because actually know­ing the outcome of the story would imply I read articles outside of the 
Viewpoint, which is patently false}. 
In any event, graduating seniors have started receiving mail asking for dona­tions to the senior class gift. Before I go any further, let me say that this is a worthy cause in my mind, given all that the university has done for us in our four years. Unlike the Saint Mary's cash, which stinks of the abuse of power, the senior legacy fund does not appear to be shady in any obvious manner. This year's class gift will go toward establishing an "internship assistance fund," which will allow stu­dents to defray some of the cost of spending the summer after their junior year in the white collar world's version of indentured servitude. Still, as they are prone to do, Kessler's words from last October continue to ring loudly in my ears. What else can we do with this newfound cash? Are we content to just stick it in the endowment fund without a second thought? No. Not on my watch. To borrow a line from Maximus in Gladiator: "What we do in life echoes in eternity." An unpaid internship fund is the safest use for these funds, but it is too bland for my palate. Let's achieve greatness, Class of 2009, so that every student that leaves Notre Dame after us will know us not as alums but as legends. 
The senior legacy fund's suggested donation is an exceedingly cute $20.09, with the extra $.09 providing an excel­lent way to rid myself of the nine pen­nies currently stuck to the bottom of my car's center console. With approxi­matf~ly 2,000 seniors, this implies around $40,000 to use for the better­ment of the Notre Dame community, and makes the Saint Mary's stipend look like pocket change. Outlined below is my three-part plan for achiev­ing Domer immortality: 
Build a replacement for the X Lot. Hight now, the vast majority of you are asking yourselves, "What is the X Lot?" If you are included in that group, I have two things to say to you. One, I'm sorry, and two, get with the program. The X Lot, also known as the Hadio Tower Lot, is home to the student tail­gates on gamedays and is more com­monly known as "the happiest place on earth." Like all good things, however, the X Lot's time is running short due to the new hockey arena that is planned for the site. No.1 ranking be damned, the hockey team is taking something I love and killing it. The largest chunk of the $40,000 will go toward turning that silly pavilion they just built next to the DPAC into a bigger, better X Lot. 
Secondly, a portion of the proceeds will establish a legal defense fund for those cited by the Indiana State Excise Gestapo at the X Lot. I don't care if Indiana's Keystone Cops have under­cover agents, camcorders, horses, or helicopters -when it comes to game­
day, future generations should never 
have to say, ''I'm sorry I party." 
My last, and best, proposal comes from some research I conducted over Spring Break in Panama City, Florida 
(a.k.a. America's Sodom). The largest bar/dub/den of iniquity in town boasts that it hosts roughly 6,000 revelers nightly. In a place as humid as Florida, that's a lot of body heat. Suffice it to say, I expected my evening there to be about as sweaty and sloppy as the Backer during Amen Corner (a.k.a. Callin Baton Houge, Hocky Top, and Country Roads in rapid succession). Instead, I was delighted to find an elaborate system of cryogenics sus­pended above the dance floor that, when employed, lowered the tempera­ture of the room by around 40 degrees in under 5 seconds. When I left the bar, dry and content, I was determined to bring such a marvelous contraption to Notre Dame. Thus, with the remain­der of the senior legacy fund, we will install a similar system in the Backer. No more tropical rainforest; now everyone will be able to stand in the Backer sludge with their two-inches of personal space at a reasonable temper­ature. 
This is our opportunity, 2009. With my plan, we will make it so that future senior classes will find no better use for their legacy funds than constructing statues in our honor. 
Brad Blomstrom is a senior majoring in finance and economics that hopes everyone enjoyed the free Keystones from the Easter Bunny sprinkled across campus last week. He can be contacted in person at the X Lot this Saturday or anytime at bblomstr@nd.edu

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Misinterpretations 
Cecilia Prinster's column, "Lay Down Your Stones" (April 8}, is misleading in its use of the Vatican II constitution "Gaudium et Spes" (GS). The Alumni Association president cites the constitu­tion's condemnation of "whatever violates the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, torments inflicted on body and mind, subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, disgraceful working conditions, where men are treated as mere tools for profit" (No. 26}. She notes that President Obama supports this teaching. 
However, her citation does not include the first part of that samesentence, which reads, "Furthermore, whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia or willful self-destruction... " The Vatican Council puts the "life issues" first. Later, that same document bluntly states, "from the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care, while abortion and infanticide are unspeakable crimes" (No. 51). 
We should expect our elected officials to oppose "unspeakable crimes" as their highest priority, even as they tend also to Guantanamo.

Thank you 
Dear CommUniversity Students, 
The work you did on Saturday to beautify, entertain, teach, upgrade and just improve the North East part of the City of South Bend is greatly appreciated. 
I was involved with the students cleaning, spreading mulch and painting in the parks and was very impressed with their hard work and the amount accomplished. I heard about how other projects had gone, like the students who helped the electronically challenged at the Robinson Center and the tour of the campus. I went to the cookout at the end and had a great time eating and talking. You even managed to make the day sunny and fairly warm. The Park Department and the South Bend people who benefited from your help thank you! Best wishes and could this be the first annual CommUniversity Day?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Slamming the doors 
Two men went up to the temple to pray, offers the story of the Pharisee and the Publican (Luke 18:10). The former rushes to the front of the church, boasting of his tithing and good works; the Publican remains in the back of the chamber confessing his unworthiness even to raise his eyes to the Lord. 
The protestors who have rocked the Notre Dame cam­pus are a regrettable second-coming of the Biblical Pharisees, declaring their goodness, proudly dismissing all other views. Their posters are printed, their feet are planted and they know what Jesus would do. They also know they have the support of the majority of Notre Dame Alumni, who likewise believe, absolutely, that the son of Notre Dame would slam our campus door on the President of the United States, preventing him from delivering this year's commencement address at my Alma Mater. 
I fear they may succeed. 
If Father Jenkins, occupying a Main Building besieged by jammed phone lines, thousands of e-mails and the sound of bull horns surrenders to this noise -or in the more likely event that President Obama decides enough controversy is enough -the holy war will end and Notre Dame will be left to stand alone in the debris of paper cups and grotesque flyers, blowing across a beautiful campus that has always been a place of inclusion, dia­logue and. sometimes, reconciliation. 
We are headed for a painful moment destined to stain Notre Dame's shining reputation, its values expressed by the image atop our Golden Dome, a symbol recognized around the world for the breadth and depth of the unconditional love of the VIrgin, who rises above the tallest trees in northern Indiana, and bears a posture at odds with today's protesters: her arms are open. Our Lady's welcome has always been extended to all who have ever come to the home of the fighting Irish faithful. It is the proflle of a loving Mother who, by the way, knows something about slammed doors. 
It is a sad irony that as the Obama drama becomes larger and larger, the Catholic Church is shrinking. The chorus of the devoted has diminished, more Catholic schools and parishes are closing, fewer men and women are joining religious orders, and less than 25 percent of us regularly attend Sunday Mass. 
The Roman Church has been a giant presence in the twentieth century of American culture, central to the lives of millions whose family members sought refuge there; a place where boys first flirted with girls and shyly learned to dance. Now in their senior years, millions of these teens of long ago stand in tears as the double­doors through which their family members have passed for generations, to be baptized, married and buried, are swinging shut. 
As this alarming decline of Holy Mother Church con tin-
Church was not misrepresented 
I would like to respond to Ellen Burns' April8 ("Partisan Hand") letter criticizing ND Response spokeswoman Kathleen Donahue. Burns asserts that Donahue misrepresented the Church's teaching on the death penalty in saying that there was more "room for leeway" on the question, and Burns implies that this "misrepresentation" was motivated by political bias. In response, I would like to quote a letter written by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict) to the archbishop of Washington, D.C. addressing the subject in his capacity as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: "Not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia. For example, if a Catholic were to be at odds with the Holy Father on the application of capital punishment ... he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities ... to exercise discre­tion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permis­sible ... to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia." 
Ratzinger frames the discussion in the appropriate light. The death penal­ty is not an intrinsic moral evil; while Pope John Paul II gave his opinion that its application in most circumstances in first-world nations is unnecessary, it is incorrect to elevate this opinion of his to the level of a doctrine or dogma. I would say, therefore, that Donahue was mostly accurate in her presentation of the Church's views.

Pro-life, but 
Let me start by saying that I am pro-life. 
believe that life begins at conception. Barring the extremely rare cases of preg­nancy resulting from rape or incest, or pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother, I believe that abortion is morally wrong. I believe that most of the students and faculty on this campus agree with me. That being said, I refuse to stand behind the pro-life movement on campus because I don't believe that their actions are doing anything to reduce the number of abortions that take place every day. Calling President Obama the anti-Christ ("Bleak Future," April 8) is not going to persuade a preg­nant woman to choose adoption. Having the leader of the pro-life movement go on FoxNews to discuss the issue is not going to help struggling mothers-to-be make the right decision. And protesting this year's commencement exercises in May will do nothing to ensure the health and safety of each and every human life, from concep­tion to natural death. These actions amount to political posturing, and I'm sure that they do little to prevent abortions. 
Instead, the pro-life movement should perform actions that change the minds and hearts of the general public. Go after abor­tion in the way that many non-profit organ­izations went after smoking -with a vig­orous ad campaign. Organize a fundraiser to raise money to produce and air televi­sion commercials that will encourage struggling pregnant women to choose life. Hang posters that show that an unborn fetus is a human being, no matter how far along in development that fetus is. Finally, and most importantly, engage with your pro-choice counterparts. Dispassionately discuss the issue with them. Help them to see that all life needs to be respected. I think that you will find that you have much more in common than you think. 
The ultimate goal of the pro-life move­ment is to reduce the number of abortions that take place. The only way that the movement will accomplish this goal is by convincing the general public that unborn human life is a gift from God and it should be treated as such. When the pro-life movement starts to undertake efforts that might actually reduce the number of abor­tions, I will be there to show my support. But as long as the pro-life movement con­
tinues to focus  on political actions, I will  
not.

Does Notre Dame need a union? 
First of all, I would like to thank the students of the Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP) and the faculty and staff for supporting your campus service workers. I honestly believe that with their persistence on behalf of us there have been some positive changes within our department of Building Services. For example, we now have an awe­some facilities director and we are fortunate to have a new associate director. Of course, continuous improvement takes time. For example, when a supervisor fails to treat her staff with fairness and respect, trust and productivity are eroded. Unfortunately, some staff will be afraid to speak up. Others will complain about the problem but never bring the issue forward. In such a case it is imperative that senior leadership seek out patterns of concern and halt the negative conse­quences of a poor supervisor. Does Notre Dame Building Services need a union? I don't think so provided that ineffective supervision is pro­hibited and staff are free to honestly voice their concerns. So, I say to my fellow coworkers don't be afraid to speak up! You have that right!

ues with ever greater momentum, Catholic bishops are publicly announcing the names of notables forbidden Holy Communion. 
The list includes our pro-choice Catholic vice president and Speaker of the House. If Obama's Notre Dame visit is canceled, the Bishops will have pulled off a trifecta, stiff­arming the three most powerful figures in the our nation. (Meanwhile pro-choice Catholics Joseph Biden and Nancy Pelosi are just two of the names already on the roster of mortal sinners, a document that adds to another list of damned lesser lights who, like me, are divorced, remarried and, therefore, denied the Eucharist.) 
Somewhere within this sad story we may fmd the answer to why so many faithful are becoming less faith­ful with each passing year. As my fellow alumni join the righteous Randall Terry in a rush to the front of Sacred Heart Church to boast of their good works, their con­gratulatory high-fives may obscure another drama unfolding at the back of churches everywhere: the scene of young Catholics rushing past the Publican and out the double-doors, forever.

Unions provide a voice 
In his letter, "Unions Cause More Harm than Good," (April 2) Mark Easley asserts that col­lective bargaining is simply a way for employ­ees to bully their employers into unreasonable contracts. However, this is not the case. What Easley fails to notice is that workers don't seek unions when they are satisfied with their rela­tionships with their employers; they seek them when they feel disrespected and their needs are ignored. Employers, not employees, are often the bullies, firing workers without reason, cutting hours so to avoid giving benefits, not respecting seniority in layoffs, firing employees before pay increases, and showing a general level of disrespect. The function of a union is not to be a "mob set out to bully the employer," but to provide a platform on which workers and employers can negotiate on equal footing. 
It is very possible for unions and employers coexist peacefully, and many businesses are doing well with unionized workers. What I found most appalling about Easley's letter was his assertion that if workers want to make more money, they simply need to, "get a second job, increase their skill set by going back to school, or look for a better career." The naivete ofthis statement is astounding. For most low income workers, none ofthese suggestions are even options. First, many people work multiple jobs and still find themselves living lifestyles far below middle class comfort, often in poverty. Also, the suggestion of a low wage worker going back to school is unreasonable. School takes time (meaning they can't have that sec­ond job Easley suggested) and money, which low wage workers simply don't have to spare. 
A union is a way for workers who feel slight­ed at their place of employment to bargain for fair wages, benefits, and better working condi­tions, so that they don't have to get a second low wage job and can maybe even spend time with their families and try to live a comfortable life.

Full disclosure -I'm very inexperienced with Indian food. I could probably count the meals on one hand. A friend's father is from India, so I was some­what familiar with a few of the tastes, but most of my experience at Taj Indian Restaurant in Mishawaka was very new. Luckily, I had a seasoned guide who pointed out Taj's best, and through the course of the lunch buffet, I became a fan of Indian food. 

Taj's menu tells the story of the Taj Mahal and its exquisitely beautiful gardens. The restaurant claims to take its name from the ancient Urdu translation of "The Great Palace." I'm no stickler, but every source

I was told that the ehicknn curry garlic naan (unleavened bread with would be a good fulcrum for the meal, garlic, coriander and seasoning) was a 
and it ended up being one of the best parts. This saturated boneless chi(:ken is stowed in a finely spicy gravy-like curry with tastns of onion, tomato, and ginger. Paired with the aromatic long grained basmati rice, the chicken curry was an excellent food to serve as a primer for tastebuds not very familiar with Indian food. 
Next at the buffet was the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken (cooked in a tandoor oven made of brick or clay, which uses a smoky open flame) in masala (tomato based sauce and light cream). This chicken was marinated in yogurt with herbs and spices. The chicken itself was not as palatable as the more standard chicken in curry, but pairnd with the peas pulao (basmati rice flavored with peas and dif­ferent spices), the chicken tikka masala was a good shift from the other spices. 
The sides were an excellent complement to the main entrees. The saag paneer (chopped spinach with homemade cheese, garnished with light cream) 
tongue-in-cheek humor. Songs like "Clothes Off'!" and the band's current single "Cookie Jar" (featur­ing The-Dream, who penned Hihanna's smash hit "Umbrella") showcase Gym Class Heroes' hip-hop origins, while "7 Weeks" and "Live Fornver" expose a layer of deeper meaning that many contemporary artists have abandoned. 
was very cheesy but also somewhat creamy, and along with the dal, it was a good respite from the typical Indian spiciness. The potato fritter was crispy and plain, and it served a similar purpose. 
A high point of the meal was the nav ratan shahi korma. This delectably savory dish gets its name from "nine gems," after the nine fruits, 
delicious way to salvage excess sauce. 
Dessert was an adventure, and not one I'm sure I'll repeat soon. Gulab jamun is deep fried milk balls in a honey and sugar syrup. Three very sweet words should have been a forewarning of this overwhelm­ingly sweet dessert. The fried globes were too soggy with the syrup, and it quickly ended the meal. 
One of the pleasant surprises of the selection at Taj was the mango lassi, a flavorful yogurt drink. Halfway between a milkshakc and a smoothie, this was a delicious counterweight to the earthy spices of the food. The sweet mango taste purged the palate of any curry or masala. 
Indian food can be a treat, and having such a sound restaurant as Taj in the South Bend/Mishawaka area is a boon. With a lunch buffet for just $6, at least one visit to Taj is a necessity.

Dame men's tennis coach Bobby Bayliss, and members of Jake Cinninger's family are employed at Notre Dame. The band tours in the South Bend and Chicago areas fre­quently. 
The last time Umphrey's played in South Bend was on Sept. 5, 2008, in St. Patrick's Park. Bayliss gave an interview to The Observer before the show in which he recollected meet­ing the original bassist for Umphrey's in the basement of Keenan Hall. The band started out

Umphrey's is best classified as a jam band in the tradition of the Grateful Dead, Phish and Dave Matthews Band. Nevertheless, their sound is defini­tively their own.

One of their trademarks is their ability to stop and start on a dime, completely changing the direction of a song in an instant without missing a beat. The band also

At the St. Patrick's Park concert, Umphrey's pulled out all the stops to make the show spectacu­lar, and one can expect more of the same at the Morris this Saturday. The band's live act focuses on lengthy improvisational forays in which the band members dazzle the audience with both their tech­nical chops and their artistic passion. Complex lighting displays help induce an overall effect of psychedelia. 
Despite Umphrey's reputation as a jam band, 
though, they do not succumb to looking like Grateful Dead wannabes, as their musical influ­ences range from Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa to Led Zeppelin and The Beatles. 
Tickets for the show are $25.50, all seats reserved, and are available at the Morris box office, by phone at (57 4) 235-9190 or at www.morriscen­ter.org.

Before I begin, let me just say that I love the food in the dining hall. Sure, I get tired of it sometimes, just like everyone else, but for the most part, the food is much better than it could be, and much better than it is at other schools. In fact, as I have overheard many a tour guide say, Notre Dame's dining halls are rated the second-best in the country, and I could not dis­agree. Having said this, I have one, and only one, request-berries. 
I do not mean the occasional straw­berry topping that comes with angel food eake. I also do not mean the pie filling that comes from a can next to the waffle station. I am talking about fresh berries that would exponentially improve the fruit choices given to Notre Dame students. 
Not only are there a wide variety of 
berries to choose from, such as blue­berries, strawberries, blackberries or my personal favorite, raspberries, these fruits are so universally loved that they would be a sure-fire hit each time they appeared. 
Even more than the wonderful taste, berries would offer a plethora of options for dining hall diners to be creative and make dishes that would increase the already wide variety of food choices offered. In addition to eating the berries alone, they would make great toppings for desserts, can be a valid addition to one's everyday bowl of cereal, or could be combined with the vanilla yogurt offered daily to make a parfait dessert of which onlookers could not help but be jeal­ous. 
Coming from someone who has a very difficult time choosing a salad instead of a corn dog, berries would also be a delicious way to add healthy foods to one's diet. The USDA now recommends that both males and females between ages 19 and 30 eat two cups of fruit each day, and what better way to reach that goal than to eat something as delicious as a par­fait? 
According to the Berry Health Benefits Network, each type of berry has its own unique set of health bene­fits beyond the normal vitamins that each contains. For instance, straw­berries can help prevent such illness­es as heart disease and cancer, as the body uses the antioxidants which make the strawberries red. Raspberries have antioxidants as well, but are also being used in Japan as a weight-loss supplement. And blueberries seem have been shown to have the highest levels of antioxi­dants, and can also help lower one's cholesterol, which can help prevent heart disease and stroke. 
Now, I understand that Notre Dame is in South Bend, Ind., and that the 
BLAIR CHEMIDLIN I Observer Graphics 

weather here is not exactly optimal for the growing of fresh berries (or for much of anything, for that mat­ter). I also understand that the University strives to serve as much locally-grown food as possible. I am not convinced, however, that all of the food served in the dining halls comes from the greater South Bend area, which means that berries could be imported from other, more fertile places in the United States. 
Please, Food Services, hear my request. You have done a wonderful job of creating many eating establish­ments that serve our campus well, and, in particular, you have done an incredible job with the two dining halls. I see only one thing as lacking, and have shown all of the benefits that this one addition would bring. We just want our berries.

Irish come up short in narrovv loss at 'Cuse 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sporrs Wrirer 
Despite a 10-point second half rally, the No. 10 Irish fell one goal short Saturday in their 14-13 loss to No. 8 Syracuse at the Carrier Dome, as sophomore midfielder Shaylyn Blaney's last-·minute attempt to tie the game was blocked by the Orange defense. 
The Irish (11-3, 4-2 Big East) were down 12-3 at the half, but came back to outscore the Orange (10-3, 5­
1) 10-2 in the second period.· Blaney led the comeback with four goals, three in the second half. Senior captain Jillian Byers added three goals and an assist in the game, along with two goals each from sophomore midfield/attack Kaitlin Keena and sophomore midfield Kailene Abt. Junior Gina Scioscia and sophomore Ansley Stewart both had a sin­gle goal for Notre Dame with Stewart earning two assists as well. 
Senior attack Katie Rowan led the Orange offense with four goals and two assists, fol­lowed by three apiece from junior midfield Christina Dove and junior attack Halley Quillinan. 
Syracuse opened up the match with a goal from Quillinan in the first minute of play. Blaney responded with a goal on an assist from Byers a minute later to bring the game to 1-1. 
Dove answered for the Orange by starting a scoring run with 10 straight goals in 15 minutes, bringing it to 11­
1. Dove had three total goals in the run, followed by senior midfield Bridget Looney and Rowan each with two, and sin­gle goals from Quillinan, soph­omore attack Tee Ladouceur and senior attack Awehiyo Thomas. 
With six minutes left in the half, Notre Dame managed to stop Syracuse's scoring drive when Byers scored off a low shot on Orange sophomore goalkeeper Liz Hogan to put the Irish at 11-2. Byers scored the final Irish goal of the half with less than two minutes left off of an assist from freshman attack Maggie Tamasitis. Rowan countered for the Orange by scoring her third goal of the half with four sec­onds left, moving the Syracuse lead to 12-3. 
The Irish team that came 
CLASSIIFIEDS 

back on the field after the intermission seemed like a dif­ferent one that had gone into the locker room 15 minutes before as they quickly took control. 
Keena jump-started the Notre Dame attack just more than a minute into the half as she scored off an assist from Stewart. Abt's first goal came soon after as she broke away from the pack to net her shot at 26:34. Quillinan broke the Notre Dame run briefly with her third goal of the day at 
25:45 to bring the game to 13­5. 
After Quillinan's interrup­tion, Blaney re-started the Irish drive when she netted her second game goal off of an assist from Keena at 24:47, the first of six unanswered goals. Scioscia followed with her first goal just more than a minute later before Blaney drove back up to the net a minute after put the game at 13-8. Stewart next scored with help from Sciascia, followed two minutes later by Abt with her second goal to make it 13­
10. Syracuse held off free­position shots by Blaney and Byers before Blaney came back with her fourth goal of the day at 7:21, cutting the Orange lead to 13-11. 
After stalling the game with two minutes left, Notre Dame failed to force a turnover and Rowan scored on an open net with 1:55 to play, moving them up 14-11. However, the Irish made one last scoring run as Byers netted a goal with 1:08 left and Keena scored her second goal with 58 seconds left to move the score to 14-13. 
In the final draw, the Irish worked the ball to Blaney, whose shot was blocked by Hogan with 31 seconds left. The Orange stalled and held onto their one-goal lead and win 14-13. 
Notre Dame outshot Syracuse 30-27 in the game and had 15 ground balls to Syracuse's 13, but fell behind on draw controls 18-11. Irish senior goalkeeper Erin Goodman had seven saves and Hogan eight. 
Next up for the Irish is the closing game of their four­game stretch on the road as they take on No. 11 Vanderbilt (8-4) today in Nashville at 
3:30 central time in a non­conference match-up.

Thomas accepts FlU job 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -While growing up in Serbia, Florida International forward Nikola Gacesa often heard his father talk about the way Isiah Thomas played basketball. 
"He is a big fan," Gacesa said. 
Gacesa will soon have his own stories to tell: Thomas is back in coaching, accepting an offer from FlU to revive his career and their program. 
Ending a whirlwind courtship, Thomas and FlU agreed on a five-year con­tract Tuesday -an out-of­nowhere deal that gives the former Knicks coach and president a chance to restore the reputation he built as a Hall of Fame player and tar­
nished through  a  series of  
embarrassments  in  New  
York.  

''I'm committed to growing something hero, and strongly believe that over time, we'll put a team on the floor that everyone at FlU can be proud of," Thomas said. 
Thomas hnlpnd thn Detroit Pistons win two NBA champi­onships as one of thn all-time great point guards, then coached the Indiana Pacers before taking over in New York, where an array of problems marred his tenure. 
Nonetheless, FlU moved quickly to lock up its top choice for the job. 
"Isiah will give FlU a tremendous opportunity to take the basketball program to the highest level," FlU ath­letic director Pete Garcia said. 
In New York, Thomas endured legal and personal troubles off the court, and more losses than wins on it. His Knicks were 23-59 last season, prompting a firing many fans had long awaited. The Knicks never won a play­off game in his tenure as president or coach. 
Knicks president Donnie Walsh, who fired Thomas, wished him luck at FlU. 
"I think it's a great thing for him and it's kind of what I wanted for him from the day I let him go," Walsh said. 
It was more than losses that doomed Thomas in New York. 
In 2007, a jury ordered Knicks owner Madison Square Garden to pay $11.6 million to a former team executive who alleged she was sexually harassed by Thomas, who continually maintained his innocence and was never found person­ally liable. 
This past October, there was more drama. 
Officers responded to Thomas' New York-area home after a 911 call report­ed someone had overdosed on sleeping pills. According to police reports, officers found a man passed out and gave him oxygen until an ambulance arrived. 
Authorities never publicly identified Thomas as the vic­tim, but a person familiar with the case confirmed to the AP that it was Thomas. 
Still, Thomas' hiring at FlU quickly became a galvanizing story in South Florida. 
"This is bigger than basket­ball and bigger than athlet­ics," said FlU president Modesto A. Maidiqun. "Having a nationally recog­nized coach like lsiah at FlU will have a positive impact on our university as a whole, helping us achieve additional national exposure." 
With Thomas -whose career record in the NBA was 187-223 (including three playoff seasons with the Pacers) -on board, national exposure is certain. 
"It's a testament to the direction of FlU athletics," Golden Panthers football coach Mario Cristobal said. "It's a great thing. There's tremendous amounts of excitement here." 
Thomas will face some immediate challenges: FlU went 13-20 this past season, its third 20-loss campaign in four years, and has not post­ed a winning record since 1999-2000. He'll need to move quickly on filling some roster slots, since the spring signing period for Division I players starts Wednesday. 
"If you really think about it, some of these kids that are coming out of AAU that are going to go to college for one year, that's a pretty good sell," Walsh said. '"Come down to Miami, spend a year with me.' I think he's posi­tioned to do well with recruiting there." 

Miami Heat center Jermaine O'Neal, who played for Thomas at Indiana, said the coach deserved a new opportunity. 
"He's a motivator and a teacher and he has some skills that really fit the col­lege level," O'Neal said. "He can take people and make them feel like they have a chance to be anything they want in life." 
Thomas replaces Sergio Rouco, who was reassigned Monday after posting a losing record in each of his five sea­sons as coach. 
Thomas' hiring brings another coach with strong New York ties to the Sun Belt Conference's schools in South Florida: Former St. John's coach Mike Jarvis just com­pleted his first year at Florida Atlantic. about an hour north of FlU in Boca Haton. 
"I think it is a great day for the league, to be very honest with you," Jarvis said. "Anything that will help bring real media attention to the league, it helps. It helps with recruiting, it helps with perceptions that people have." 
Thomas spent his entire NBA playing career with the Pistons, appeared in 11 All­Star games and was the MVP of the 1990 NBA finals, when Detroit won its second straight title. 
His new players, Gacesa said, couldn't be more thrilled. 
"It's an incredible feeling," Gacesa said. "I think we're still realizing how big this is for us. We still don't realize how big this is, how much knowledge and skills he can offer us and how much he can help us take this school to another level, take this school to where we are sup­posed to be."

AUGUSTA, Ga. -There were so many ways this most thrilling of Masters could have ended. 
What if Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson had carried their duel into a playoff? Now that would have turned Augusta National upside down. 
Or how about Kenny Perry, the ultimate grinder, winning his first major at an age when most players are prepping for the senior tour? Boy, that would have been something. 
Instead, it was a burly man from. Argentina who crafted an ending no one could have envisioned. 
IN BRIEF 

Pacers' Travis Diener reflects 
on becoming a free agent 
INDIANAPOLIS -Travis Diener has enjoyed his two years as an Indiana Pacer, but that doesn't mean he'll return for a third. 
The reserve point guard has a player option on the final year of his contract this offseason. He stands to make $1.7 million if he sticks around, but he'll become an unre· stricted free agent if he doesn't. 
Though he became a fan favorite last season for his quickness and hustle, Diener hasn't played much this season while backing up Jarrett Jack and T.J. Ford, and they both might be back for the 2009-10 cam­paign. Diener isn't sure what the future holds, but he is keeping his options open. 
"It's something I've got to sit down with my agent about, and at the end of the day, just make the best deci­sion that will fit me the best," he said. 
Down at the 10th green, long after Woods and Mickelson had headed for exits and dragged many of the patrons with them, Angel Cabrera barely beat the setting sun with a gimme of a putt as Perry looked on helplessly. 
OK, it wasn't Hollywood. But Cabrera sure earned it. 
When his swing got loose and produced two straight bogeys on the front side, he hung in there. When he faced a two-stroke deficit with two holes to play, he didn't give up. And, most impres­sively, when his first tee shot of the sudden-death playoff rolled to a stop behind a big tree on the first playoff hole, he never lost hope. 
"I only had a spot like this big" -meaning tiny -"and only trees, so I've got to put it through there, that's it," Cabrera said, a translator relaying his words. "Easy as that." 
Cabrera hooked his ball around one tree but struck another, and was fortu­nate to see it carom to the left and out into the fair· way, a sand wedge away from the green. He knocked it up to 8 feet behind the hole, and made the putt to save a remark­able par. Perry messed up his approach and had to settle for par, too. The third member of the play· off, Chad Campbell, 

New book in the works about Beckham's American career NEW YORK -A new book will offer an up-close-and-personal take 
on  David  Beckham's  American

Grant  Wahl's  "The  Beckham  

Experiment," due out in July from Crown Publishing Group, draws upon interviews with Beckham, and teammates and officials at the L.A. Galaxy. The British soccer superstar signed a five-year contract reported­ly worth $250 million in 2007. 
Wahl is a senior writer at Sports Illustrated. According to a statement from Crown, his book will look at Beckham's relationship with his Galaxy teammates, his marriage to Victoria Beckham and his friendship with Tom Cruise. 
The book's release is timed to Beckham's expected return to Los Angeles. Beckham, who turns 34 in May, has been on extended loan to AC Milan.

missed his 6-footer and the race was down to two. 
Only one more hole was needed. Perry found mud on his ball in the middle of the 1Oth fairway, and his shot veered left of the green. Cabrera knocked his below the hole and ­for perhaps the first time all day -he was finally the one in command. Perry's chip raced past the flag, and he missed the putt coming back. 
Perry didn't even get a chance to finish. Cabrera's putt stopped next to the hole. He marked it, took a quick look to make sure there was nothing on it, and calmly delivered the winning stroke on his sec­ond career major. 

Former Debiot Ti1!ers' _pitcher
Fidrych found ileao at 54 
EVANSVILLE, Ind. -Former pitcher Mark 'the Bird' Fidrych came to the Detroit Tigers in 1976 after going 4·1 with a 1.59 ERA the previous season with the Evansville Triplets, their Triple-A affiliate in the American Association. After a series of injuries, he rejoined the Triplets in 1980, ending 6-7 with a 
3.93 ERA. 
The 1976 American League rookie of the year was found dead at age 54 on Monday in an apparent acci· dent at his farm in Massachusetts. 
Former Evansville catcher Steve Patchin calls news of Fidrych's death "just terrible." 
Patchin tells the Evansville Courier & Press that Fidrych "worked hard­er than anybody" he ever saw and was a "total team player." 
He says, "There was no pretense about him. What you saw was what you got."

Belles grab first-round edge 
Team leads with two to play in nat'l qualifier 
By NATHANIEL LEE 
Spons Writer 
No. 21 Saint Mary's cashed in on its home-course advan­tage in the first round of the MIAA's national championship qualifier, finishing first with a 325, 13 strokes ahead of sec­ond-place Olivet. 
Three rounds total will determine the league's auto­matic qualifier for the NCAA Div. III Championships, and the Belles earned the right to host the first of three rounds by finishing the fall season in second place. No. 11 Olivet earned top honors in the fall, so it will host the final two rounds later this month. 
"There is an advantage in being at home, and we made sure that we capitalized on that opportunity," Belles coach Mark Hamilton said. "We will be mindful of that heading to Olivet's home course, but we beat them there last time, so we are

Squad tries to recover from 2losses 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's, fresh off back­to-hack conference losses that have sent the Belles below the .500-mark, will try to bounce back today at Bethel. 
The Belles (5-7, 1-2 MIAA) fell to Albion, 6-3, on Saturday and were blown out by Calvin, 8-1, last Wednesday. This comes after starting the conference slate with an 8-1 thrashing of Alma on March 28. 
In their loss to Albion, the Belles got strong performanc­es in singles from junior Camille Gebert and sopho­mores Jessica Kosinski and Betsy Reed, but consistency has eluded the young squad at times. 
"It's hard to say who will do well at each spot," sophomore lillian Hurley said. "I am hop­ing everyone can give their best. We have a much stronger team than last year, so it would be great for everyone to step it up and pull out a win." 
Gebert was able to pull out her victory at No. 2 singles with a double bagel over Cassie Simmelink. 

"Her win was not that sur­prising," Belles coach Dale Campbell said. "She has been improving steadily throughout the season. She won our only match against Calvin." 
Kosinski won her singles flight at No. 3 singles only dropping two games, while Reed followed up at No. 4 sin­gles by winning a tight match in three sets. 
"[Reed] was playing the way she knows she can play," Campbell said. "She was able to fight back after losing the second set, and fought to pull out the third set that kept us in the match." 
Again doubles was a down­fall for the Belles as they lost all three flights of doubles to open the match. 
Bethel head coach John Natali said doubles would be key for his team in the match against Saint Mary's. 
"It is crucial for teams to win all three doubles points," Natali said. "The team that wins even two of the three doubles matches has a slight advantage heading into sin­gles play." 
The Belles were up in five of their six singles matches against Albion and were not able to pull out all of them, and that lost the match for them, Campbell said. 
"We are continuing to work on improving our doubles," Campbell said. "We are also going to work on l'inishing our singles matches and becom­ing more confident. It may not always be pretty wins, but sometimes you have to win ugly." 
Saint Mary's has less than a month before it heads to the conference tournament, where the Belles finished fourth overall last season. 
"Despite our loss to Albion we want to continue to be motivated," Campbell said. "The loss was tough but we know we are close to break­ing through and that should help us the rest of the sea­son." 
The Belles will travel across town to face Bethel today at 4 
p.m. and then will host Kalamazoo Saturday at 1 p.m.

Belles break out of slump withwins 
By CHRISTOPHER MASOUD 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's posted back­to-hack sweeps of Robert Morris and Albion to end the team's two-game losing streak. 
"We bounced back well because we didn't play the way we wanted to against Alma and we just wanted to have a couple of good games against a non-conference opponent with Robert Morris," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "It got us right back to the game we've been playing all year, and our hit­ters were hitting from the top of the lineup to the bottom." 
The Belles (22-4, 6-2 MIAA) took the field Wednesday fully aware of the importance of beating non-league opponent Robert Morris for favorable playoff positioning. They dominated the Eagles (20-17, 7-3 CCAC) from start to fin­ish, taking the twinbill by scores of 3-2 and 8-0. 
Senior Cathy Kurczak and freshman Lauren Enyati led the charge for Saint Mary's in game one, driving in all three runs and giving the Belles the edge over the Eagles. Freshman hurler Monica Palicki scattered five hits over the course of seven innings to pick up the win. 
In a display of confident hit­ting and fundamental soft­ball, Saint Mary's crushed any chance of a split for the Eagles by winning their 20th game of the season in the nightcap. Wednesday's win marks the fourth straight season that the Belles have won at least 20 games, a feat that can be attributed to the leadership of Sullivan in her fourth year in the position of head coach. 
"My seniors, from the day they got here as freshman, have just changed the pro­gram and set a new tone for us," Sullivan said. "Ashley Fusaro and Katie Rashid are two wins away from 100 career wins, which no one has ever been remotely close to." 
Freshman Angela Gillis con­tinued her exceptional debut season by going the distance for Saint Mary's in a two-hit shutout. Enyati and Senior Ashley Fusaro each had three hits in a complete team effort. 
But the highlight of the week came on Saturday, when the Belles topped MIAA opponent Albion by scores of 6-4 and 8-1 in a doublehead­er. 
In game one, the Belles came back from a 1-0 deficit in the first inning by scoring three runs in the bottom of the frame to take a lead they wouldn't give up. Junior Ashley Peterson picked up an RBI after scoring Enyati on a double off the left field wall, which was followed by a sin­gle from sophomore Hayley Bojorquez to drive in another run. 
Kurczak added an insur­ance run in the fourth after reaching home on a Peterson ground-out. Palicki lowered her ERA to 2.09 and picked up her 10th win of the season by going the distance. 
The back end of the double­header quickly turned into a blowout, as the Belles pound­ed out runs early and often to set the tone. After jumping to an early 2-0 lead, Saint Mary's added three more in the fourth, highlighted by Fusaro's 15th career home run, a soaring drive over the center field fence. 
Gillis picked up her 12th win of the year by scattering four hits over seven innings and lowering her ERA to 
0.80. Gillis was named MIAA Pitcher of the Week for the second consecutive week as the Granger, Ind. native was honored for her outstanding performances against Robert Morris and Albion. 
"She moves the ball well and always hits her spots for the most part," Sullivan said. "When I told her she was the pitcher of the week again, her only response was, 'It's all because of the defense.' She's very humble." 
The Belles will host Hope (13-17, 6-6 MIAAl today at 
3:30 p.m. as they look to extend their hot streak to six games.

Irish look solid in tune-up regatta 
By BRENDAN CORSONES 
Sports Writer 
Despite victories against Brown, Minnesota and Ohio State in Columbus, Ohio, over the week­end, Irish coach Martin Stone described his squad as "not up to spned." 
No. 18 Notre Dame fared well in the afternoon. capturing two race vietories and improving on five of the six race times from the morn­ing session. 
Stone praised the second varsity eight, who were able to improve from their third place finish in the morning session to second in the afternoon, shaving five seconds off their time to clock in at 6:36. The Irish lost only to No. 3 Brown, by four seconds. and bested No. 20 Minnesota by 14 seconds. 

The second novice eight also impressed, pulling ofl' lirst-place finishes in the morning over No. 15 Ohio State and in the afternoon over Minnesota. That squad also improved its time from 7:11 in the morning to 7:04 in the afternoon. 
The other squads were not as lucky, and although Stone "made some changes" and saw improve­ment, the first and second varsity fours could manage no better than third-place finishes in the morning and afternoon. 
The first varsity four fell to 

each session. The first varsity eight was beaten by Ohio State and Brown in the morning, and Brown and Minnesota in the after­noon. The Irish clocked in at 6:31 and 6:27, respectively. 
Stone said the "very good" com­petition had much to do with the finish, and he said he still believes the two varsity tour boats could be competitive in the future. 
Stone was pleased with the per­formances of the first novice eight, however, who grabbnd a victory in the afternoon session over Minnesota after falling to Ohio State in the morning. He described the novice boats as showing "a lot of promise." 
Looking forward to the coming Big East championships, Stone was cautiously optimistic about the tournament that his team was able to sweep all six races in last year. The Irish will be looking for their sixth straight Big East Championship, and Stone said it would be "tough to be great" in all six races as they were last year. 
He mentioned Louisville and Syracuse as two teams that could dethrone the Irish and keep them from another Big East crown. 
In regard to winning all six races, he said that if it did not happen, it would not be from lack of talent.

Momentum going into the postseason is important in any sport, but it can be essential for a young team like the Irish. 
And No. 20 Notre Dame (12­

10) took that momentum by fin­ishing off the regular season in dominating fashion with a 7-0 win over in-state rival Ball State Monday. That victory was especially crucial after a 4-3 loss to No. 24 Louisville Saturday, as the weekend was a microchosm of an up··and-down season defined by youth and a daunting schedule. 
"Coming into the season we knew we were going to have some highs as well as some lows, but as long as we kept improving we thought that there was a good ehance to peak at the right time," senior Brett Helgeson said. 
On Saturday, Louisville cap­tured an early lead as their first doubles team of Simon Childs and Viktor Maksimcuk barely upset Helgeson and Tyler Davis 9-8 (7-5). Maksimcuk followed that up with a win in second singles over Stephen Havens, bringing the score to 2-0. 
Sophomore David Anderson and freshman Casey Watt tied it up with straight-set wins at fifth and third singles. respectively. 
After Notre Dame dropped fourth singles but won at sixth singles, the match came down to the duel between the two highest-ranked singles players in the Big East: No. 24 Helgeson and No. 41 Austen Childs. Youth overcame experience in that battle, as the sophomore Childs took down Helgeson in the only three-set match of the day. 
The Irish brought it all together for the match on Monday, as they swept both doubles and singles against Ball State. Freshman Samuel Keeton, in his first start since March 1 against Wisconsin, put together a good showing with a straight-set win at sixth singles. 
Notre Dame's next stop is in Tampa, Fla., where the Irish will compete in the Big East championships. 
"The team has really put in the hours on and off the court and I believe we are prepared to defend our title at the Big East tournament," he said. 
Louisville's win on Saturday clinched the top seed, leaving Notre Dame to take the No. 2 spot. The Irish will face No. 7 Georgetown on Friday at 9 a.m.

After a solid performance from the entire team Saturday at the Ole Miss Invitational, the Irish set themselves up for the possibility of a successful run at the Big East championship and possibly beyond. 
Coach Joseph Piane couldn't praise his team enough after its strong performance . 
"We have some national class kids," Piane said. "Several kids qualified for the NCAA and Big East [championships]." 
Headlining Notre Dame's effort were dominating performances in the men's 800-meter run, where the Irish took the first five places and nine of the top 12. Juniors Blake Choplin and Jack Howard led the pack, finishing first and second, respectively. 
The men's team boasted several other top finishers. Junior Jake Walker took second in the 1500, and classmate Eric Quick also placed second in the long jump.

The Irish ended their weekend 
tournament on a high-note, shoot­
ing their best round of the Robert 
Kepler Intercollegiate on their way · to a 1Oth-place finish. 
"We struggled at [the Robert 
Kepler Intercollegiate]," Irish coach 
Jim Kubinski said. "Yet, we had 
split our starters between that event 
and the one that fmished up in 
Chicago today as a preparation 
strategy for our Big East champi­
onship. We felt that each player 
would benefit from a different 
preparation arena." 
The Irish started the two-day, 
three-round tournament with a 25­
over 309, before stumbling in the 
second round with a 31-over 315 
that put them in 11th place overall 
after the first day. The Irish fought 
back on the second day of the tour­
nament, though, recording a 21­
over 305 and moving back into 1Oth 
place in the 13-team tournament. 
"I was disappointed in our finish 
but pleased with the way our play­
ers competed," Kubinski said. "I 
liked the fact that our guys gave it 
their best in spite of not getting the 
scores we had hoped for." 
Notre Dame's all-conference jun­
ior Doug Fortner led the Irish in the 
Kepler Intercollegiate, finishing 14 
over par, good enough to put him in Sophomore Greg Davis took home fourth place in the hammer toss, and freshman Joe Miller claimed top honors in the 3000-meter steeplechase. 
The women's squad also looked strong, as junior Jackie Espinoza and senior Heidi Rocha won the discus throw and the 5000, respectively. 
"Everyone did an all-around great job," Piane said. "It's nice when we go out and perform well, but right now we're starting to focus on the Big East champi­onships." 
Other notable finishers for the women included a third-place fin­ish from junior Elise Knutzen in the javelin and sophomore Marissa Treece's second-place fin­ish in the 1500. Sophomore Theresa Cattuna also finished third in the 5000.

a tie for 18th individually, his third top-20 finish this season. His best round was his first, when he shot a one-over 72 in the morning on the first day. 
"[Fortner] is a very good college player right now," Kubinski said. "He can be an elite player. His final round was also outstanding except for two mental errors mid-round. He has to learn to stay mentally alert on every shot." 
The best score on Sunday in the last round of the tournament for the Irish came from sophomore Jeff Chen, who shot a three-over 7 4 to lead Notre Dame back into 10th place. Chen finished the weekend at 16-over, which put him in sole pos­session of 25th overall. 
"Jeff finished with a heck of a round," Kubinski said. "I liked the fact that our guys gave it their best in spite of not getting the scores we had hoped for." 
The Irish scoring was rounded out by junior co-captain Olavo Batista, who finished in a tie for 55th place, shooting a 25-over 238, and by junior Carl Santos-Ocampo and freshman Tom Usher, both of whom shot plus-26 239, putting them in a tie for 59th overall. 
Next stop for the Irish is the Big East championship on April 19 in Dade City, Fla.

"We just made plays," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said of the dramatic fmish. "We won a cou­ple faceoffs, and we just had guys make some plays. The most important thing was winning the faceoffs so we had possession of the ball." 
Corrigan said Swezey's goal, especially, was the result of indi­vidual players taking the game into their hands. 
"For Duncan's goal, in all hon­esty, Pete Christman did a great job," Corrigan said. "He threw a triple team and got the ball to Neal Hicks who made a very dif­ficult catch and throw to Duncan who then made a great move and a great shot to finish it off. So there were three guys that made outstanding plays." 
The Pioneers (6-6, 1-2 GWLL) opened the scoring 12:55 into the game, with a goal by Andrew Lay. The Irish responded, though, with four straight goals to claim the lead. Junior midfield Grant Krebs and sophomore midfield Zach Brenneman scored in the opening stanza to give the Irish a 2-1 lead after one quar­ter, and two goals from Swezey extended the Notre Dame lead to three. 
After Denver's Todd Baxter cut the lead to 4-2, Brenneman found the back of the net again to restore the three-goal cushion. 
Another goal from Lay cut the lead back to two, but senior attack Ryan Hoff scored for the Irish just 22 seconds later. 
With three minutes left in the frrst half, Krebs scored again to push the lead to 7-3. The Pioneers, though, refused to go quietly, and two goals from Ben Wahler and Mark Matthews cut the lead to 7-5 at halftime. 
Denver continued its comeback attempt in the third quarter, as Matthews' second goal of the game was the only scoring in the period. 
The Irish appeared to be in the clear when junior midfield Kelly McKenna scored on a feed from Earl to make the score 8-6, but Denver's back-to-hack goals tied the score and set the stage for Swezey's game-winner. 
While Corrigan said he was pleased with his team's effort, he wasn't happy with the Irish defense in certain situations, such as man-down or directly off a faceoff. 
"We gave up a lot of goals in a lot of different ways," he said. "And that was disappointing because I think we can do better than that. But our 6-on-6 defense was very solid. We just need to do a better job managing the game." 
Senior goalie Scott Rodgers made 15 saves on the afternoon to push his record to 10-0 on the season as well. 
On the offensive side of the ball, the Irish continued to spread the ball around and cre­ate chances for multiple players. This time, it was Swezey who ended up with the hat trick, but six other Irish players have also done so this season. 
"I think the best thing we've done offensively throughout the year is share the load," Corrigan said. "We've got a lot of people contributing and that does make us hard to scout I think." 
Duke's upset win over Vrrginia Saturday meant that Notre Dame is now the only undefeated team remaining in Division I. Corrigan, though, was quick to dismiss any significance. 
"It won't matter if we lose the next three, so we're going to stay focused on trying to beat Quinnipiac on Saturday." 
The Irish will face the Bobcats next Saturday in Hamden, Conn.

Frilling led the Irish dou­bles with an 8-4 victory, after being tied 3-3. Juniors Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik followed suit, beginning their match with a 4-4 tie, and ending victoriously 8-4. Junior Colleen Rielley and fresh­men Shannon Mathews fin­ished the Irish sweep with a nail-biter of a victory, 9­8. 
"We have three very strong doubles teams," Tefft said. "We are close to playing to our potential. We should win all of our doubles points." 
The Irish never let the Aggies truly get into the match once singles play began. No. 35 Tefft fought back in her match to take the point, 4-6, 6-4, 1-0. No. 37 Frilling then took her match easily, 6-1, 6-1, and the Irish rolled through the Aggies on their way to another victory.

from the charity stripe for the whole game. 
The Bailers began the sec­ond half by missing their first four shots, and The Legends drew close. 
"We couldn't buy a basket," Bailers senior Doug Susco said. "It had a lot to do with the court too. We couldn't get our grip on the ball." 
With the Bailers up 18-17, the court was lined with spec­tators from baseline to base­line. The pressure seemed to get to both teams, as they both turned the ball over several times before Hughes ended the game on a free throw. 
"We let the game get real tight," BaUers captain John Dillon said. "We should have made the free throws but next game we'll hit them." 
No. 18 We Didn't Go to Jared's 21, The Smurfs 13 
Jared's got off to a slow start but eventually lived up to its lofty ranking to beat The Smurfs by eight. 
The Smurfs opened the game strong as freshman Grayson Duren seemed to make every shot he took. Duren scored The Smurfs' final seven points of the first half, as well as the team's first point of the second half. 
"We rely on skill a lot more than size or athleticism, so anytime we can make a couple shots we'll keep running and hoping to knock them down," Duren said. 
But Jared's closed the first half strong, as Andrew Cavanaugh scored six of his 12 points in the half, and Jared's led 11-10 at halftime. Jared's would then score the first seven points of the second half. 
"[Duren] looked like [NBA legend] Pete Maravich so we put our own little Pistol on him on defense," Cavanaugh said. "And we came out like gang­busters in the second half." 

Before long, Jared's had scored enough inside buckets to procure the necessary 21 points, and The Smurfs' hot hands went cold. 
"They were a lot bigger and a lot more athletic than us," Duren said. "Really, they were a better basketball team, so we were lucky to hang in there as long as we did." 
Going Pro In Something 
Other Than Sports 21, 3D 
Monkeys 16 
Going Pro pulled away at the end to defeat 3D Monkeys in a game that seemed to be tied for the majority of play. 

Both teams played competi­tively, never allowing the other to get on a run or gain any momentum. In the first half, junior center Kevin Brooks dominated the boards and tal­lied key put-backs to keep his team close. 
3D Monkeys broke the 10-10 tie to take the slight lead into halftime, but with the score knotted up at 15-15, Going Pro turned to its defense. The man-to-man pressure forced turnovers that led to lay-ups at the other end. 
"I think we performed at a high level, the other team played real strong, but we came back at the end and fin­ished them off real tough," said Going Pro captain Dave Crowley, a senior.

MEN'S lACROSSE 
Team edges Denver to remain undefeated 
By SAM WERNER Associate Sports Editor 
With five minutes left in regu­lation, and the score tied 8-8, it looked like Notre Dame's unde­feated season might be in jeop­ardy. Denver had just netted two straight goals, including one man-down score, and the crowd at Invesco Field was ready for their team to spoil Notre Dame's perfect start. 
The Irish, though, had other ideas. 
Senior attack Duncan Swezey's third goal of the game broke the tie with 2:08 left in regulation, and sophomore midfield David Earl sealed the deal with anoth­er goal with 1:02 to give the No. 4 Irish (10-0, 3-0 GWLL) the win in the sixth annual Rocky Mountain Showdown.

Ranked teams avoid upsets 
By DOUGLAS FARMER and 
CHRIS MICHALSKI 
Sports Writers 
When sophomore Robert Hughes led the No. 24 Steel City Ballers onto the court against The Legends of Notre Dame, the crowd expected a blowout. While the Ballers did prevail 21-18, they did not blowout The Legends by any means. 
The Bailers opened in a 2-1 ~2 zone, of which the Legends took advantage by hitting two jumpers for a quirk 2-0 lead. Soon there­after, the Bailers' more physical style of play yielded a few layups and n~bound put-backs. 
At halftime the Ballers led 11-8, with Hughes leading the effort with four points, despite only shooting 3-9 from the field. The Legends would have fared much better if they had done better than their 0-for-3 showing from the free throw line in the first half. The tmderdogs went 2-for-9

Notre Dame dropped the first game of the doubleheader, 7-3, in part because the Irish defense committed four errors. Sophomore Brian Dupra threw a complete game -six innings because the game was short­ened for the doubleheader and the Bearcats didn't bat in the bottom of the seventh -but gave up seven runs, six of them earned. He struck out six, tying a career high, and walked three.
