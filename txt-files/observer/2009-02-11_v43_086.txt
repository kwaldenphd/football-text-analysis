By AARON STEINER Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame management pro­fessor and former chair of the management department Robert 
P. Veechio died Monday. He was 58. 
Vecchio sus­tained serious IOJ uries after falling from the rooftop of his home Saturday. He was treated at Memorial Hospital in South Bend.

"He provided the foundation for the management department to attain the reputation it enjoys today," she said. "Our hearts and our prayers are with the family to which· he was so devoted." 
Other representatives from the Mendoza College of Business were not available for comment Tuesday evening. 
According to a report Sunday by the South Bend Tribune, Vecchio fell from a height of at least 10 feet Saturday morning at his Granger home.

Jenkins: University is fiscally stable 
By AARON STEINER AssisJant News Editor 
Despite the dismal state of and bleak outlook for the national economy, University President Fr. John Jenkins wrote to faculty and staff Tuesday to again emphasize that Notre Dame, while "not immune to economic pres­sures," is well-positioned to continue progress "toward our goal of becoming a preeminent research university." 
The e-mail, dated Feb. 10, is the second such message Jenkins has sent regarding the economy and its potential effect on the University. The first e-mail was sent Dec. 1, 2008. 
Jenkins said the University has been more fortunate than other colleges and institutions. 
"Unlike some of our peers, at this point Notre Dame does not face the need to freeze salaries or hiring, halt construction or reduce our work force," he said. 
"While our endowment and other revenue streams have experienced losses, we contin­ue to be positioned, at this juncture, to pursue opportuni­ties toward our goal of becom­ing a preeminent research uni­versity," Jenkins wrote. 
Still, Jenkins said that the University may need to consid­

INSIDE COLUMN 

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE STUDENT GOVERNMENT DO? 

A-Roidhad funely leak 
On Monday afternoon, baseball's golden boy Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance enhancing drugs early in his career. Bad news for A­Roid. 
Don't get me wrong, Alex Rodriguez cheats Gust ask his wife), whines, and plays ball like a girl. That has been public knowledge since he limp-wrist­swatted Bronson Arroyo during a los­ing effort in the 2004 ALCS. 
But, in A-Rod's defense, he may be 
the only man in America who han-Dan Murphy dled this week-end's debacle the right way. Sports Editor Learning from the mistakes of meat­head Roger Clemens, Rodriguez quick­ly told the world he was guilty. 
The problems with the rest of the sports world's reaction started only seconds after he came clean. ESPN's Peter Gammons, the most infallible man this side of the Pope, started the problem. 
After A-Rod explained the pressure of playing in the demanding market of Arlington, Tex., the slugger said he juiced from 2001-2003. Gammons fol­lowed up appropriately. 
Gammons: You're saying that the time period was 2001, '2, and '3? 
Rodriguez: That's pretty accurate. 
Pretty accurate? Is that like Rick Ankiel is pretty accurate? You can't "pretty" much take steroids. You are either a needle-sticking, pimple-pop­ping, law-breaking steroid user, or you're not. 
Gammons had no follow-up question. He let the sports world down more than Ron Burgundy did to San Diego. Shame on him, and shame on the rest of sports journalists who have seeming­ly completely overlooked pretty much the most obvious follow up question ever. 
Now to fry some bigger fish. 
Major League Baseball has handled itself so poorly in the past 10 years it might as well be an investment bank. Six years ago, a number of players were anonymously tested for illegal substances to decide ifthe MLB should do something about the raging drug abuse problem that had developed right under their nose. Obviously, they discovered they had messed up. 
They messed up again by not main­taining the anonymity of the tests. Leaking this story is a great way to get the players' union to agree to increase drug-testing. It's good that the league has really earned their trust on this one. 
That's not to mention that this leak conveniently sprung at the exact time that football was coming to an end. The story provided a perfect way to ignore the Pro Bowl and gear up for baseball season. 
Why would they intentionally leak bad news? Good question, but as they say any publicity is good publicity. 
Finally, to the world outside of base­ball, has no one noticed that this man admitted to breaking a United States Federal law? The substances weren't banned by the MLB at the time, so it's not quite so bad. Well, the NFL has no rule against murder, no wonder O.J. got away with it.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Willerton elaborates on Activities Center 
Proposed building, which will cost about $30 million, to be located on north end ofcampus 
By LIZ O'DONNELL 
News Wrirer 
Members of the Council of Representatives (COR) dis~ cussed the future of the LaFortune Student Center and plans for the new Student Activities Center in their meet­ing Tuesday evening. 
Ryan Willerton, the Facilities Director for Student Activities Office was on hand to discuss plans for LaFortune, and to discuss the current concept for the new Student Activities Center. 
Willerton said there are four primary facilities available for student activities: the Stepan Center; the Creek House, a local retreat facility located off campus; LaFortune; and out­door grounds available for sporting events. 
He said that there are strategic plans to ensure these places operate as efficiently as possible. 
The budget allotted to reno­vations in the building comes from a variety of sources, Willerton said. 
A portion of the budget is allotted !'or building mainte­nance, he said. 
The majority of the funding comes from six different proj­ects, which include the end of the year shipping program, the summer linen mailing, and the "Irish Express" bookstore outlets around campus during football weekends. Funding also comes from the on-cam­pus cake service, exam kits and money generated from the video arcade. 
When the funding is avail­able, Willerton said that they consider the suggestion boxes that are located in LaFortune for ideas to better the build­ing. He also said that they reg­ularly collect feedback from student managers, as well as members of student govern­ment. 
From there, if it is decided that there is enough money available to make large scale changes to LaFortune, Willerton said they will approach student government and ask them to create a panel to represent the student voice. 
One specific area Willerton addressed was the renova­tions that are projected to take place to the video arcade that is located in the basement of the building. 
"Since the video arcade is located in the part of LaFortune that is the old building, water comes into the arcade when it rains, often seeping into the basement," Willerton said. "We want to repair the leaks, install car­pets, and do it right from the start." 
Willerton also said that they are hoping to move forward with the project starting in 2010. 
Student body president Bob Reish asked Willerton about the size of LaFortune in com­parison to student centers on other campuses, sighting that LaFortune is relatively small given the size ef the campus's population. 
Willerton said LaFortune has a different focus than stu­dent centers on other college campuses. 
"The mission of the student center is to be similar to a vil­lage well where people go to find the news of the day, meet up with their friends or grab a bite to eat," said Willerton. "We could always have more room, and it would be nice to expand, but we would never give up the central location that it has." 
In addition to this, Willerton said the new Student Activities Center that will be built is to serve the purpose of comple­menting LaFortune, rather than detracting from it. 
It is projected that the cost of the center will be approxi­mately $30 million. They are 
currently waiting for  a bene­ 
factor  to  fund the  project  
before it can begin.  

The Student Activities Center will be a multipurpose facility that will host lectures, concerts and dances. It will also have a large ballroom area where Residence Hall dances will take place. It will not be a hangout area the way that LaFortune is, but function rather like the Stepan Center does now, he said. 
Along with these events, the Center will also have a meet­ing room that Willerton said will help lower the demand for meeting time at LaFortune. 
The Center is planned to be constructed 100 yards east of the Stepan Center on the North side of campus. Once the Center is in place, the 
Stepan  Center  will  be  
removed.  
When  COR  members  

expressed concern at the loca­tion of the Center, Willerton explained that while the build­ing will go up on the perime­ter of campus, it is still a part of it. 
"While you may not walk by this building everyday, it is still a part of campus," Willerton said. "The location provides easier access to off­campus students." 
While the location for the project has been selected, there are only tentative floor plans available. Current plans call for the Center to be a one-floor building.

"What's that going to mean for the future struc­ture of taxes? What's having all that debt out there going to do to interest rates?" 
Ideas differ on how best to implement the stimulus, since not all forms of government spending boost demand by the same speed or magni­tude. 
Sullivan pointed to a reduc­tion in payroll taxes as an effective way to give money to people who would spend it quickly. 
"One way to have an effec­tive stimulus is to put money in the hands of people who need it," he said. "One way is a reduction in the payroll tax. The argument is that those people are more likely to spend it sooner." 
Direct government spending on infrastructure or energy investment would be fail-safe ways to increase overall "I think

Mark also mentioned an overlooked way to _spur eco­nomic activity. 
"Something they haven't talked about is maybe busi­ness tax credits," he said. "You direct that at small businesses and have them invest in capital."

"l fear that people will use the ·current recession as an excuse to blame markets," Sullivan said. "And I don't think this provides evidence that markets don't work. It provides evidence that mar­kets don't always work per­fectly. "This idea that markets unencumbered will always give the best result is putting a little too much faith in mar­kets," Sullivan added. Wolfson said there is a need for broader changes to eco­nomic policy. "I think it represents poten­tial for a fundamental shift in our policy. We've experienced over the last 25 to 30 years an environment of reliance upon the free market, free trade, deregulation, tax cuts for the relatively wealthy and I think all of this has basical­ly run around," he said. "We need to dramatically change our approach to the er.ono­my." Sullivan said the recession has primarily hurt low-skilled workers and that people who are college-educated have less to worry about. "That doesn't mean that Notre Dame grads don't have to be worried," he said. "They will land on their feet regardless. It just means that it will take them longer to find the right job. "

Hospital shelling kills 16 patients 
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka-At least 16 patients being treated at a makeshift hospital in the northern Sri Lankan war zone were killed by shelling, the Hed Cross said Tuesday, as the mili­tary accused rebel fighters of killing 19 other civilians tleeing the area. 
The United Nations, meanwhile, said it was outraged by the "unnecessary" deaths of hun­dreds of people inside rebel territory and urged both sides to avoid fighting in civilian areas. 
The government accuses the Tamil Tiger rebels of holding civilians hostage in the war zone to use as human shields against the mili­tary's offensive. The rebels deny the accusation. 
International human rights groups say more than 200,000 civilians are believed trapped in the patch of territory still under rebel control.

The Peanut Corp. of America plant in Plainview, Texas, had operated unlicensed and uninspected for nearly four years, heightening food safety concerns already swirling around the company. Although no recalls related to the plant were announced Tuesday, federal inspectors have begun looking for any signs of prob­lems similar to those found at a company plant in Georgia identified as the source of the salmonella outbreak.

The plan is aimed at restoring proper functioning to credit markets, which seized up over worries about bad debt after the September bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The latest plan calls for a govern­ment-private sector partner­ship to help remove banks' soured assets from their books.

"We are not immune to eco­nomic pressures and further dramatic declines could lead us to rethink our timelines on con­struction projects and prepare new strategies in regard to salaries, hiring and the work force," he said. 
The e-mail came after the Board of Trustees approved the budget for the fiscal year 2010, which Jenkins wrote includes "modest but cautious growth" of 5.7 percent over the current budget. 
Jenkins said the budget reJlects increased funding for the following areas: undergrad­
uate and graduate studies; research and scholarly initia­tives, including the equipment and library resources they require; and faculty and stall'. 
The message did note that the administration will continue to call for fiscal restraint within all areas of the University. 
"Your divisional and depart­mental leaders have been asked to consider further means of conserving our resources," Jenkins said. 
University Provost Tom Burish and Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves will further explain the University's fiscal situation to faculty and staff in scheduled remarks and meetings, he also wrote. 
Jenkins concluded the e-mail writing that he has been "impressed and heartened by 
the willingness of the University family to be part of the solu­tion" required to address eco­nomic concerns. 
"Your extreme generosity in the recent United Way cam­paign and food drives rein­forces for me how deeply com­mitted you are to Notre Dame's mission of service," he said. "Your willingness to participate in wellness initiatives has helped turn back rising health care benolit costs. Your enthu­siasm to adopt measures of energy efliciency promises fur­ther savings." 
Jenkins also said he would continue to provide increrm~ntal updates to faculty and staff regarding economic and fiscal issues.

Because some of the comedic material in "The Producers" is viewed as con­troversial, DiPiero said he had to meet with the Student Activities Oflice (SAO) and the rectress of Pasquerilla East, who oversees the group, to get the show approved. 
"We had to discuss aspects of it, but in the end, we decid­ed that it was appropriate to put on stage, despite con­cerns," he said. "'The Producers' is a little edgy in certain ways. The main song is 'Springtime from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's fr·om all dorms and majors.

"The show does not take itself seriously," DiPiero said. 
According to PEMCo.'s Web site, the group was started in 1997 by a Pasqucrilla East resident because Notre Dame had not performed a musical on campus for over 1 0 years. Now, the group is the largest, student-run musical theater company on campus. 
In the past, PEMCo. always has held a spring musical, and a spring revue, which is a compilation of song and dance numbers, DiPiero said. But this year, the group added a fall show, "Edges" which was shown in October.

DiPiero said he has had enough time to polish the show, and the cast and crew have put in a lot of work. He said the show will reflect the extra effort. 
"We have a very sharp and professional show," he said. "I think people will be surprised at how clean and well done it is."

IN BRIEF 
Salazar rejects Bush drilling plan 
WASHINGTON -Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has rejected a Bush administration plan to open vast waters off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts to oil and gas drilling, promising "a new way forward" in Qffshore energy development including new wind projects. 
Salazar at a news conference Tuesday criti­cized "the midnight timetable" for new oil and gas development on the country's Outer Continental Shelf proposed by the Bush admin­istration four days before President Barack Obama took oflice Jan. 20. 
The secretary said the previous administra­tion's plan did not take into consideration the views of states and coastal communities, nor a need to better understand what energy resources are-at stake, especially off the Atlantic coast where oil and gas estimates are more than three decades old. 
1V stations to end analog as planned ·NEW YOHK-More than a quarter of major 
U.S. TV stations intend to shut down their ana­log broadcasts on Feb. 17, sticking to the origi­nal date despite the wish of the Obama admin­istration that they wait until June. 
Congress last week gave TV stations until June 12 to shut down analog broadcasts, hop­ing to give viewers more time to prepare. Money has run out for the federal fund that subsidizes converter boxes, and there's a wait list for the coupons. 
The delay sent TV stations scrambling to fig­ure out when to shut down analog. Most had planned for years to do it on Feb. 17, and many had scheduled engineering work. 
The Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday that 491 of the 1.796 full-power TV stations in the country had registered their intention to keep the Feb. 17 date. The FCC has reserved the right to deny individual sta­tions an early shutdown.The SEC said Madoff agreed to the partial judgment without admit­ting or denying the allegations in its civil com­plaint filed on Dec. 11. However, the agree­ment says Madoff cannot contest the "facts" of the complaint for the purposes of determining his obligation to pay civil fines and restitution -which will be specified later. 
Senate approves economic stimulus bill 
Urgent compromise talks begin with Congressional leaders for final version 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate sailed to approval of its $838 billion economic stimulus bill TuP,sday ­but with only three Republicans signing on and no time to celebrate. The White House plunged into compromise talks with congressional leaders on a final version. 
Within hours of the 61­37 Senate vote, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, Budget Director Peter Orszag and other top aides to President Barack Obama met in the Capitol with Democratic leaders as well as moderate senators from both parties whose support looms as crucial for any eventual agree­ment. 
A top priority for Obama is to restore money to build and repair schools and to give cash-starved states more help with their budg­et problems.

Now that TCE's are online, our. semester is depressingly devoid of wasted time in the classroom. Lest your spirits sink and yoQ resign yourself to the fate of taking notes, take hope instead ~Teach for America Season has finally arrived. Freshmen: I know you have no idea what I'm talking about right now, but be patient-the enthusiastic speeches and e­mails from Notre Dame's enthusi­astic Teachers­for-America-to-be will come in a few short years. Let us all be thankful for the student pre­sentations that cut out five minutes of teaching time and save us from the disdain of the professor when we walk in mid-lecture holding a latte from Starbucks, Just like the gor­geous weather that arrived this past weekend and is destined to head south faster than the men's basket­ball team, we should appreciate TFA Season while we can. 
Happily, this morning I was able to enjoy my coffee and a few more lines in the newspaper thanks to a won­derful student presentation. For any­one who was also late to class and wants to help fix our nation's educa­tion system, here is a list of reasons to Teach for America that I've cob­bled together over the years: 
Teach for a Low Acceptance Rate: 
Did you know that only half of chil­dren growing up in poverty will graduate from high school, and that those who do will read at an eighth grade level? A sobering fact, espe­cially when you consider that, as Notre Dame students, we are part of the mere 56 percent of high schoo~ graduates who are able to attend college. 
With regard to Teach for America's mission, however, the most impor­tant statistic is 14.8 percent. That's the percentage of applicants that enrolled in the program in 2008. Never mind that the program regu­larly rejects qualified applicants that would help alleviate the inherent inequities in our education system; TFA prides itself on its aura of exclu­sivity. Its recruiters will push any­one and everyone they can find to apply, even if they foresee an obvious rejection. Take my case, for exam­ple. 

Last year I received an e-mail from a TFA recruiter asking me to get cof­fee and learn about the program. A nice gesture, but at that point I was intent on selling my soul to a corpo­rate overlord upon graduation. I politely declined. His response? "Great! Let's meet up next week. When are you free?" I again declined, only to receive another invitation to coffee. At this point I felt like Peter from Office Space dur­ing his meeting with "The Bobs." The TFA recruiter's desire for me to apply only increased as he became more aware that I was the exact wrong person for the job. A curious tactic, but one that undoubtedly helps produce that impressive 14.8 percent. For a better idea of TFA's priorities, here are a few more sta­tistics: 
$6,389. That was tbe cost to recruit, interview, and hire each of the 2,892 TFA enrollees in 2007. That's a lot of coffee. 
$5,689. That was the cost to train each of those enrollees in 2007, a figure 11 percent less than the cost to recruit them. Five weeks is all the teacher training you need, evidently. 
Teach for a Backup Plan to Employment or Grad School: 
All you need to know: full salary and benefits. Parents off your back. Real life: delayed for a few years. I know what questions are running through your head right now. No. 1: "Why does this guy hate kids?" No. 
2: "Don't people that do TFA want to be teachers? This is their real life." While the answer to question one is too long to explain, the answer to question No. 2 is the last, and most important, reason to Teach for America: 
Teach for a Line Item on Your Resume: 
As an aspiring corporate under­ling, I understand that every field needs its "proving ground" where entry level employees earn their stripes. Doctors have their residency, lawyers their time as a junior associ­ate, and bankers their time as an analyst. For those of you who want policy jobs down the line, here's your chance. TFA doesn't want teachers. They want people who need a few years of teaching experience to be successful in the telling-teachers­how-to-teach field. It's no coinci­dence that BusinessWeek named them one of the best places to launch a career or that in their 2007 annual report they were proud to have "laid the groundwork for a more robust pipeline to political leadership going forward." 
A two-year stint hurts our schools and hurts our students. It took me three years at Notre Dame to figure out how to correctly order stir fry at the dining hall. To think that I could become comfortable enough with developmental psychology and the teaching profession's best practices after just five weeks of training is akin to me thinking I could win the Father of the Year Award after a few heart-t.o-hearts with Flavor Flav. 
Last round applications are due February 13th. Let's teach for actu­ally trying to right "our nation's greatest injustice" instead of using our schools as a career launching pad.

Madame Cassandra's hard-learned lessons 
A large part of the sense that's been nailed into me over the years can be credited to Valentine's Day. 
For instance, after many years of fatal errors, I finally got it through my 
thick skull that Katherine the round, dark chocolate in the Khorey 
box of five is not Both Sides the truffle: it's Now the one with coconut. Said chocolate should never be saved for last, but rather be consumed first and swallowed whole, like a pill. Or better yet, given to Uncle Homer. 
Then, Valentine's week, soph'omore year of high school, there was planted in the mental soil made fertile by the sight of so many eye-gazing, ear-suck­ing couples, a very different kind of lesson. One of journalistic outrage. 
Although I was never on the staff of the high school paper, at that point I was no stranger to newspaper writing in general. In fact, I fondly remem­bered my stint as the Middle School Voice's resident astrologer. But while Madame Cassandra's Mystic Predictions could display a uniqueness that the "real" horoscopes lacked (who knew that chocolate cupcakes lay in our future?), they just weren't all that, well, real. 
No, I made my first foray into appar­ently real journalism when I teamed up with my friend Lucy, who was on the paper's staff and did write for real, to expose the evils of PDA. 
Of course, we were not writing pure­ly in defense of public morals. True, Valentine's Day was coming along, and true, the Foreign Language hallway was ravaged with public displays of affection, and true, the unbound kissy­poo epidemic was taking a toll on the uninfected. Most significantly, on us. 
Lucy and I were a pair of lonely sin­gle women living in an era when most of our friends seemed to have found the loves of their lives. It wasn't easy for us to witness so much love being shared; and I at least was eager to prove that, should the situation ever be reversed, I wouldn't be putting my unattached friends inJhe same posi­tion. Even if Johnny Angel himself offered to show me how lovely Heaven could be, we would most certainly not be flaunting our halos,outside Senora Third-Period's classroom. 
Nope, my commitment to public abstinence was established, and so, I believe, was Lucy's. And when our condemnation of public non-absti­nence appeared in print, the whole school was going to know just how staunch we were. 
So we thought. 
With Lucy's help (oh fine, maybe with my helping Lucy), I'd had my first experience in writing, for the paper, a stinging piece on a pa'Ssionate subject. But we were underclassmen, and space in the Valentine's week issue was at a premium. Fortunately or not, our effort remained unprinted. 
And so, four and a half years later, 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Shifting support 
Last night, the results of the election for student body president and vice president came in. Although we were not able to garner enough votes to win the election or enter a run off with another ticket, we thank those of you who took time out of your day to vote for us. Even though we did not win the presidency and vice presidency, we will continue to look out and support the interests of the student body and alumni here at Notre Dame. For those of you who do not yet know, there will be a run off election between the Schmidt-Weber ticket and the Burdick-Sanchez ticket. Because of the similar concerns and platforms, we write this letter to endorse the latter campaign. Thank you to those of you who voted for us, but now we ask that you cast your ballot once more. in favor of Laura Burdick and Derek Sanchez. We feel that as president and vice president, these two students will advocate on behalf of students and bring about the necessary improve­ments that actually matter and affect the student body. For that reason, we offer our endorsement to the Burdick-Sanchez ticket. Thank you again for voting.

Please save n1e fron1 the n1ud 
There's really no downside to warm weather. My body temperature rises a few degrees to a life-sustainable level, the snow melts, leaving a verdant green in place of mind-numbing white, the girls of Notre Dame and St. Mary's finally take off those damn sweatpants ... the list goes on forever, really. 
Yup, no downside, that is until I trudged through the muddy, wet grass leading from the edge of library quad over the "hill" straight to the Jordan Hall of Science. Like many dozens of hyper­rushed students bolting to and fro class, who were taught that the shortest dis­tance between two points was a straight line in second grade, I walk directly towards the building when I am looking right at it. This is to be distinguished from the anarchist quad-cutters. So many students do this in various locales around campus (Jordan to Rolf's, aforementioned library quad path next to Galvin, etc.) that the grass gets physically worn down to the dirt, creating a muddy mess for my sweet Reebok kicks. It's almost comical; considering the ungodly amount of con­crete poured in nonsensical patterns across the face of Our Lady's lawns, the most logical places to put walkways are not paved. Architects in the past (smarter than those employed by ND) have built buildings with no pre-planned walkways connecting them -then after a year of observing the patterns worn into the grass, they subsequently paved those slowly-trodden pathways which us smar­ty-pants humans collectively determined to be the most efficient. It seems silly that year after year the same grass paths are worn down to the dirt, while the Building Services and Maintenance, or whatever, still doesn't have a clue. So, please, save my shoes and sanity, Notre Dame, and pave those grass paths into dry concrete.

In his Feb. 9 Letter to the Editor "Ordain females," Patrick Bears states, "I have never heard a valid reason why women can't be priests. Ever." I hope to take him up on this challenge. Bears claims that the Church uses the word "tradition" as an "excuse to exclude a group of individuals from having authori­ty." This claim is unfounded as there are plenty of woman with positions of authori­ty in the history of the Church (abbesses, theologians, and doctors of the Church come to mind). The entire Christian faith is dependent on Mary's "yes" to God's will; accordingly, we hold her in the highest esteem as "Queen of Heaven and Earth." 
The late Pope John Paul II honored women when he spoke of a "feminine genius" and described woman as "God's masterpiece." Although the Church has not been without discriminatory and mis-when I was given 900 semi-weekly printed words to use however I want­ed, I'd thought at first, "Ooh, and in February, I can talk about PDA again! I can do the "Top Ten Worst Places to Make Out," or have a catchy advice phrase, like The Three C's (Keep it Classy? Clean? Clandestine? Closed?). Because PDA is just as annoying now as it was in high school, and I'll make such a difference when I write a rant about it that everyone has to read!" 
Now Valentine's Day is imminent again, and... 
I won't. 
I've learned. 

No one's required to read a piece just because it's in the paper. And not only that, but in this case, my same­siding target rantees would be unlikely to notice the Viewpoint page lying -Qn the chair across from them. 
And, too, it wasn't long after Lucy's and my attempt at kissy-poo inocula­tion that I learned what every kind of abstinence has in common: that it's just vot easy to keep it up in the long run. Even a couple who started their relationship with a firm commitment to discretion would be sooner or later likely to slip up, and sneak a kiss in the DeBartolo lobby. And I'd be in no position to fault them. 
So I've learned. 

I relinquish my right to preach about PDA. But I can still ask that, as with alcohol, you please use your own best judgment. 
Please just be aware. If you and your sweetie truly feel the need to exchange a long, loving, physical goodbye in the dorm's front entrance at 11:52 on a weeknight, expect to be interrupted. If you're engaged in some prolonged snuggling by the Grotto, spare a thought for the hapless jogger who's stopping off to light a candle for Uncle Homer's impending quadruple bypass. Recognize that your bedroom may not be an ideal place for private romance if 20 of your guests' coats are still scattered on your 11oor. And, while no one's entitled to throw stones, be pre­pared for whispers of, "Hey, look. We're only two pews behind Mr. and Mrs. Like-to-Go-At-It-During-The­Psalm this week!" 
We'll make our choices, and our commitments. We may not always keep to them. But we know the effects of what we do. 
A world exists outside ourselves. And, whether displayed in excessive public coupleship or printed rants soured by grapes, said world doesn't take very kindly to self-absorption. 
That's what I've learned from Valentine's Day. That, and to eat the round dark chocolate first.

The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necesarily those of The Observer. 

Get the facts straight 
guided people, "blatant discrimination upon the grounds of sex" has never been a part of official Church teaching. The argument from tradition notes that Jesus did not choose any women for the priestly office; he chose 12 men to forgive stns, heal the sick, and consecrate the Eucharist. Since the Church cannot alter what Christ instituted, we may say that "the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination upon women" (Ordinatio Sacerdotalis). Some claim that the cultural norms of the time forced Christ to suppress the roles of womeir' However, Scripture demonstrates that Christ had no reservations shattering all sorts of norms (e.g. interaction with prostitutes, tax collectors, and lepers). If Christ was willing to be crucified for his actions and teachings, something tells me he would not have been afraid to ordain women if he so desired. So why did Christ choose men and not women for the ordained priesthood? 
To answer this question we must look at the nature of the Sacraments. The Sacraments are where we encounter the eternal God in the temporal world. To be an efficacious sign of this union between Creator and creation, the Sacraments must truly communicate what they sym­bolize. For example, in baptism we are "drowned" in Christ's death and reemerge cleansed as sons of God and members of Christ. Water is the obvious choice to sym­bolize this drowning and cleansing in bap­tism. Similarly, the Eucharist is the Sacrament of the Bride (Church) and the Bridegroom (Christ). It is where Christ gives up his body to the Church so she can conceive new life in the Holy Spirit. The ordained priest acts "in persona Christi" at the altar, re-presenting Christ's sacri­fice for all humanity. The imagery, sym­bolism, and efficaciousness of the Eucharist are only fully maintained when a man performs the Sacrament. The Church maintains that all men and women are equal in dignity. However, "equality of dignity" does not imply "sameness of roles." God has given men and women unique abilities to bring about the kingdom of God. While some of these roles overlap, others are reserved to men and women (e.g. priesthood and mother­hood, respectively). It is by embracing the differences between men and women that we will find union in Christ.

When somebody says 'musical' for most people the image called to mind is that of a corny, family­friendly production a Ia "42nd Street" or even Disney's "High School Musical." Well, if these are typical musicals, then Mel Brooks' "The Producers" is the anti-musical, which the Pasquerilla East Musical Company (PEMCo.) will perform this hilarious show Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights at 7:30 in Washington Hall. 
Based on the 1968 Mel Brooks movie, "The Producers" is about a money-grubbing, but washed-up Broadway producer and a mousy accountant who cook up a get-rich­quick scheme. They plan on raising two million dollars from investors and then putting on the biggest flop in Broadway history so that they get to keep all of the invested money. To do this, they try to find the worst musical ever written and hire the worst director and worst actors for the parts. The musical they decide to 
What's surer to succeed on 
·Broadway than a complete flop of a show? That's the idea that made Mel Brooks' "The Producers" so popular in 1968 when the film first hit screens. From there, the show went on to become an actual Broadway hit in 2001 and made another appearance on the big screen in 2005. The hilarious story of the conning producers whose plan for a horrible show turns them into millionaires has kept audiences laughing, and will con­
inue to do so in this weekend's PEMCo. show. 
"The Producers" was Mel Brooks' first work as writer and director, starting a long line of funfest come­dies. The film starred Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder as Leo Bloom. Wilder would go on 
o star in several more Brooks films, such as "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein." The put on is called "Springtime for 
llitler." which speaks for itself. 
Haunchy, satirical, and devilishly disrespectful, "The Producers" pokes fun at everything from old women, to accountants, to Eastern Europeans. Anybody with a twisted sense of~ humor will appreciate the sight of Nazi stormtroopers daneing around the stage like a bunch of fairies. It even makes fun of the theatre com­munity itself; one of most innovative and humorous aspects of the show is the way it satirizes its own genre. The show also contains more cross­dressing than the Keenan Hevue, and certain scenes strongly resemble New York's Gay Pride parade. 
If you have never been to one of PEMCo.'s main stage productions before, I will assure you that they are the closest you can get to a real Broadway production without paying a week's salary for a ticket. "The Producers" is no exception. Different dance numbers feature grandmas with walkers, girls in dazzling gold sequins, prison inmates, and of course, Nazis. The sets are artfully designed. The costumes? Well, just 
m won an Academy Award Best Writing, Story and Screenplay­Written Directly for the Screen and Gene Wilder was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. 
In 2001, "The Producers" debuted on Broadway as a musical. The film was adapted for the stage by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick made the roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom famous. The show strayed from its original material in a few wa¥s. giving the characters of Ulla and Hoger DeBris larger roles and eliminating the character of Lorenzo St. Dubois (LSD), who portrays Hitler in the original film version. The ending is also happier than the original film version. At the 2001 Tony Awards, the production won 12 Awards and had an additional three nomina­tions. The show went on national tours and became immensely popu­lar internationally. 
In 2005, the decision was made remember what I said about the G Pride parade. 
Joe Augustinsky and Michae Eardley are strong in the lead r.oles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom. Eardley is particularly skilled at por­traying the neurotic, insecure side Bloom's character. But many of the best moments come from the color­ful cast of supporting actors and actresses. Brian Davenport is out­standing as the flamboyant neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind, and Margie Juu'""'"''"" is perfect for the role of Ulla, the tempting Swedish receptionist. H first number is superbly sultry and will leave at least all the men in the audience begging for more. 
So if you're looking for a gre Valentine's Day date idea or ju something to do this weekend, ,,w""''­out "The Producers." Tickets are. available at the LaFortune box office, $6 for students, $8 general admission, and some tickets may be--... available at the door before the per­formances.

to take the musical to the silve screen again. The new film adapta­tion took heavily from the Broadway show, recasting Lane and Broderick in their roles a Bialystock and Bloom. The of the original stage show, Susan Stroman, also directed this film version. Heception of the new ver­sion of the film was mixed. Man critics said that it retained too many of its stage characteristics. The acting and delivery of the seemed to have been barely toned down at all, making the transfer to film difficult. 
Since the debut of the musical, "The Producers" seems to have been made for the stage. PEMCo.'s performance is likely to continue in the same vein, and is sure to delight audiences this weekend. PEMCo. is sure to know where the went right with a show like "The Producors."

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -All-Star shortstop Miguel Tejada has been charged with lying to Congress about an ex-team­mate's use of steroids, the latest baseball player to get caught up in a web of cheating and juicing that has stained the sport. 
Tejada is expected to plead guilty in court Wednesday. The charges against him were outlined in documents filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington. 
The teammate is not identified in court docu­ments, but he is referred to as having played with Tejada on the Oakland Athletics. Tejada won the 2002 American League Most Valuable Player award while playing for the Athletics and is a five-time All-Star. He now plays for the Houston Astros. 
The documents indicate that a plea agreement has been reached with Tejada. The court papers were filed a day after superstar Alex Rodriguez acknowledged past use of performance­enhancing drugs. The New York Yankees third base­man does not face charges. 
The FBI also is investigat­ing whether Roger Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young winner, lied to Congress last year when he denied using steroids or human growth hormone. Clemens and Rodriguez top a list of big name, drug­tainted stars, including Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, whose actions cast doubt on their on-field accomplish­ments. 
Tejada faces as much as a year in jail if convicted on the misdemeanor charge of making misrepresentations to Congress. Under federal guidelines, he would proba­bly receive a lighter sen­tence. 
The charge came in a legal document called a "criminal information," which only can be filed with the defendant's consent and typically signals a plea deal. 

A hearing is scheduled fur 11 a.m. EST Wednesday in Washington, and Tejada and his lawyr plan to hold a news conference later in the day in Houston. 
Messages left for his attorney, Mark Tuohey, were not immediately returned. 
In the documents filed Tuesday, Tejada is charged with lying to investigators for the House Committee on Oversight· and Government Reform in 2005. Congressional staffers did not place Tejada under oath when they questioned him, but they advised him "of the importance of providing truthful answers," accord­ing to the court papers. 
IN BRIEF Jones officially released by
Cowboys after suspentions 
IRVING, Texas -Troubled cor­nerback Adam "Pacman" Jones was released Monday by the Dallas Cowboys, making him a free agent. 
The Cowboys said last month they planned to release Jones, and Monday was the first day teams could make waiver requests. 
Jones was suspended for six games by the NFL after an alco­hol-related scuffle in October with a team-provided bodyguard at a Dallas hotel. 
The cornerback came to Dallas after being suspended for the entire 2007 season following mul­tiple off-field incidents while with the Tennessee Titans. The Cowboys acquired him in a trade during the draft in April, and commissioner Roger Goodell cleared him to play at the end of the preseason. 
American motocross rider Lusk dies of head injury SAN JOSE, Costa Rica ­Jeremy Lusk, an American freestyle motocross rider, died of head injuries Tuesday after crashing while trying to land a backflip in competition. He was 
24. ... 
Jorge Ramirez, chief of the intensive care unit at Calderon Hospital where Lusk was taken, said the motocross racer suffered severe brain damage and a possible spinal cord injury. 
Lusk won a gold medal at the 2008 X Games. He was injured Saturday night when he failed to complete a full rotation while attempting a Hart Attack backflip and slammed headfirst into the dirt. Lusk crashed in almost identical fashion in the 
freestyle  semifinals  at  the  
2007  X  Games  but  was  not  
hurt.  

Guard Williams to replace
Bosh in NBA All-Star game 
INDIANAPOLIS-Mo Williams is final­ly an All-Star. 
Twice snubbed, the Oeveland Cavaliers point guard was added to the roster Tuesday by NBA commissioner David Stern as a replacement for injured Toronto Raptors forward Orris Bosh. 
Williams' teammates and Cleveland's owner Dan Gilbert were dismayed last week when Williams was twice left off the Eastern Conference roster but approved the move unanimously Tuesday. 
"It has a beautiful ring to it," Williams said before playing at Indiana. ''I'm excit­ed for myself and my iPammates and the coaches. It's a great thing, it's one thing people can't take away from you." 
Williams wasn't voted in by the fans, nor was he chosen by Eastern Conference head eoaches as a reserve. Then he was passed over by Stern in favor of Boston's Hay Allen, who is replacing injured Orlando guard Jameer Nelson on the roster.

SOCCER 
Beckha~, Galaxy breakup is a painful affair 
World's most famous foo_tballer finds home in Italy with AC Milan; chooses football over fame and fortune 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Loaned to AC Milan 
to resuscitate his football 
career, David Beckham is per.­
haps too busy to write a "Dear 
John" letter to his American 
fans, to explain that he wants 
out of the Los Angeles Galaxy 
and that they may have lost 
him to Italy for good. 
If Beckham could put pen to 
paper, here's what he might 
say: 
Dear the United States of 
America, 
Dear LA Galaxy. 
Dear TomKat, 
Breaking up is never easy, 
especially when the wedding 
cost millions and there's n<J 
pre-nup. But, please, you have 
to let me go. 
Truth is, I've found another 
love. She's Italian. With her, I 
feel young again, she's given 
me a new lease on my foot­
balling life. Even Victoria ­
"Posh Spice" doesn't do her 
justice -is calling me 
"Goldenballs" again. I've redis­
covered my magic touch. 
Her name is AC Milan. They 
eall her players the 
"Hossoneri," and I've been 
tickled pink ever since I pulled 
on her shirt. Like my times 
with Manchester United and 
Heal Madrid, I'm back where I 
deserve to be: playing for one 
of the biggest football clubs in 
the world. 
Yes, I know I said my move to 
Italy on loan would be a short­
term thing, that this was just a 
trial separation and that I'd be 
back in March. But I didn't 
know then that being with AC 
Milan would be so much fun. . (And the boutiques in Milan ... 
Wow!) 
Perhaps you missed my goal 
for Milan against Genoa. Was it 
shown on TV there? Or did 
that other type of football ­
the American kind played with 
rugby balls and all that 
padding -hog the limelight 
again? That bugs me. 
Anyhow, the goal was a gem, 
the kind that made me famous. 
a free kick curved over the 
wall from an almost impossible 
angle. The 'keeper flailed like 
a crash-test dummy. I can bend 
it again. baby! 
And my Bologna goal, that 
was another beauty for the 
highlight reel, lifted right out 
of Stevie Gerrard's book at 
Liverpool. On the run, first 
touch, right foot, bam! I'm still 
learning Milan's language, but 
know what "bellissimo" 
means. Put me in the right 
arena, and there's plenty of 
kick left in these 33-year-old 
legs. 
I know it's hard on you. We 
had grand plans together. My 
face, fame and supposedly fad­
ing skills; your business acu­
men and big dreams. Together, 
we were going to put the 
"Major" back into League 
Soccer (or is that football?), 
plus make a bundle and some 
celebrity A-list fr.iends in the 
process. 
But, somehow, the whole 
experience has been so ... 
what's the word? ... under­
whelming. Baseball, hoops, the 
wrong kind of football. Seems 
that there's just not enough 
room for us all. Fergie, Sir 
Alex, my old boss at 
Manchester United was spot 
on, it seems, with his comment that "David Beckham himself 
can't change the whole coun­
try." 

In MLS, I'm a big fish in a .small sea. At Milan, I'm a big 
fish in an ocean, playing along­
side other megastars at a club 
where players seem to go on 
and on like Duracell bunnies. 
Teammate Paolo Maldini turns 
41 this year! Longevity. It's 
important to me. So is playing 
with the best. 
I don't know if you read my 
recent interview with Italian 
paper Corrien~ della Sera, but I 
think and hope you'll get the 
message. Sometimes, you've 
got to be a little cruel to be 
kind. 

"The Americans are doing everything they can to improve the level and reputation of their game. It's a young league and I think it needs another 10 years to become successful," I said. "I have to admit that, having played in Europe, sometimes it was frustrating playing in certain games. But every now and then, moving from one state to another. I also enjoyed myself." 
Fact is, money isn't every­thing. I'm thinking of myself and my country here, too. Perhaps it's age, perhaps it's vanity, perhaps it's the passion for football I've carried since I was a kid. But I cannot bear the thought of saying goodbye to England's white, three­lioned shirt. 
I've played 107 times for England. Just one more game to equal the great Bobby Moore's record for an outfield player. Serving my country is something I know that you, my American friends, can under­stand. The World Cup is just around the corner. I'm already the only England player to have scored in three separate World Cups (1998, 2002 and 2006). I'd love to give it anoth­er crack in South Africa and silence those idiots who say I'm just a clotheshorse and refuse to recognize me as the gifted and dedicated footballer I am. 
But for that, I've got to impress England coa:ch Fabio Capello. Crikey, is he a hard nut to crack. I don't think he watches MLS. He suggested that I go to Milan. At least in Italy, I know he keeps an eye on me. It's kind of hard not to when I'm playing so well. I won him over before when he and I were both at Heal Madrid, proving he was wrong to drop me_from the squad. With Milan, I know I can do so again. Capello has included me in the England team that will play Spain in a friendly this week, so my Italian job does seem to be paying off. 
My side is now talking to your side. I hope the lawyers can work out an amicable split. Of course, I will come baek on March 9 and fulfill my MLS obligations if you insist. But we both know that my heart now lies elsewhere. 
Yes, Victoria might miss Hollywood and pals Tom and Katie Cruise. It's true, she seemed to fit right in there. But Milan is hardly slumming it. 
This isn't about fame or for­tune. For once, it's just about football. 
Respectfully, David.

United States and Mexico renew rivalry opening final round of World Cup qualifying for South Africa 2010

COLUMBUS, Ohio -Landon Donovan is caught between two continents.

Donovan isn't the only Galaxy player in Europe these days -David Beckham is on loan to AC Milan through May to strengthen his chances of playing in England's World Cup quali­fiers.

tions from a 

media throng in both English and Spanish. Ile said he learned to speak Spanish from players -many from Mexico, South America and Central America -who were teammates of his when he was younger. 
As always, he remained con­fident of the American side's chances. He said the series with Mexico has changed dra­matically from when he first played on U.S. teams against the Tricolores. 
The two sides have met 54 times since 1934, with Mexico winning 29 and the U.S. 14. But since 1999 the U.S. has won nine of 13 meetings ­including the two previous World Cup qualifiers at Crew Stadium, by 2-0 counts in 2001 and 2005. The 2001 match was known as· "La Guerra Fria" because of the wintry conditions. 
Mexico hasn't beaten the United States on U.S. soil since 1999. 
"I would guess that the tone of it has changed, for sure, since we first played them a long time ago," Donovan said. "That's good. But it doesn't give us any advantage ... Yes, we're confident, but it doesn't matter what tlw media is say­ing. When they show up ... they're going to be good regardless of what's going on." 
Over the years, Donovan has said that playing for his coun­try is among the most impor­tant things to him in his soecPr career. 
"It's just fun." he said. "Anybody in any job, whPn thPrP's a more exriting opportunity or a tmosplwre, or whatever, you'rp going to be more exritPd and m<H<' prepared for it. That's the way this is." 

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Mizzou program turns the corner 
Associated Press 
COLUMBIA, Mo. --Hundreds stormed the court, a sponta­neous eruption celebrating Missouri's coming out party. 
Nearly three years to the day since Quin Snyder resigned and the program reached its low mark, the Tigers' wiped away all the institutional cobwebs with an improbable come-from-behind 62-60 victory over bitter bor­der rival 
Cole Aldrich had 15 rebounds and five blocked shots for Kansas, but Self said the 6-foot-11 center dido't get enough scoring chances while battling a collapsing zone. Aldrich was 3-for-8 and had eight points.

5. 8-2 Big 12) shook off an atrocious first half in time to end a five-game losing streak in the series, and coach Mike Anderson finally beat the Jayhawks after an 0-5 career start. Barring total collapse, the school's five-year NCAA tournament drought also is about to end. 
Anderson sensed the antici­pation before the latest renewal, especially after the Tigers' road win at Texas knocked the Longhorns out of the Top 25 only five days earli­er. 
"Even though Kansas was here I feel like a lot of people came out to watch us play," Anderson said. "Our students have been lining up all day to get in here, and it was a team effort --players, coaching staff and our fans." 
When the arena was half­filled earlier this season, Anderson knew the fan base was just waiting for a sign. 
"It's one of the reasons I came here," he said. "It's a tough place to play and the fans have passion. We've got to give them a reason to come and a reason to stay when they come, and I think they went home happy tonight." 
The fans' release has been building over the last 16 home games --the 15 games before the Kansas nailbiter were decided by an average of 28.5 points. 
Missouri's relentless press­ing attack has been a success pretty much everywhere in Anderson's third season, and with a team proven to be long on depth. It's a style designed to wear down opponents and to mount quick rallies, and one that allows the Tigers to overcome deficiencies such as a soft inside game. 
Kansas (19-5, 8-1) led 30-16 at halftime and was up by 11 at 54-43 with 8:19 to play, but had only one more basket the rest of the way. The Jayhawks' whopping 48-28 rebounding advantage was negated by a season-high 27 turnovers, and Missouri was able to prevail despite a season-worst 35.6 percent shooting and ugly 2­for-14 numbers from 3-point 
time, they're 
looking forward to a much longer stay in the poll with a chance to make it 17 in a row at home on Saturday against Nebraska. 
"Experience, leadership, mature freshmen," said DeMarre Carroll, who led Missouri with 22 points and seven rebounds. "Then you've got to give credit to our coach, he harps on us every day about defense. 
"As a team, I think we came together in the second half." 
As for Kansas, Self doesn't expect the setback to linger with his young players. 
"Hopefully if we're in this position again, we'll close it out," the coach said. "If we can't handle losing a game, we're obviously not a very tough team or tough-minded at all."

NFL 
Saints, Hornets might relocate 
Associated Press 
BATON ROUGE, La. --An executive with the group that oversees the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Arena warned lawmakers Tuesday the state must find $27.5 million next year to fulf'ill contracts that keep the Saints and Hornets in New Orleans. 
The state pays the two pro teams each year to retain the elubs, subsidies the team owners have said are needed to make operating in the rel­atively small New Orleans market worthwhile. 
The money comes from the budget of tho Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District or LSED, which operates the stadium and the arena where the NFL and NBA teams play. 
Doug Thornton, senior vice president of SMG, the com­pany that manages the Superdome and the Arena, said the LSED won't bring in nearly enough for the fiscal year starting July 1 to cover the payments. 
The problem has recurred ever since a deal was negoti­ated with the Saints in 2001 and the Hornets came from Charlotte, N.C., in 2002. Previously, the state tapped surplus cash, refinanced Superdome debt and bor­rowed from an economic development fund to fill gaps in Saints and Hornets pay­ments. 
"We have revenues that are not sufficient to cover the debts," Thornton told members of the House Appropriations Committee. 
Both deals were negotiated under then-Gov. Mike Foster. The state's 10-year deal with the Saints is the largest of the two and runs through the 2010 season, guarantee­ing the NFL team $186.5 million in payments. 
The state now owes the Saints some $23.5 million annually --atop the NFL team's earnings from ticket sales, concessions, parking and other items. 
The Hornets deal doesn't include nat payments, but involves payments based on performance and team income. The state needs an estimated $7 million to pay the Hornets next year. 
If the state didn't make the payments to the teams, the Saints and Hornets could leave New Orleans without a penalty. 
But Thornton said the troubled economy would make it difficult for a team to move, and both the Saints and Hornets have expressed a commitment to New Orleans. 
"We hope that an eventual solution will address both the short-and long-term challenges that face the Saints and the state," said Greg Bensel, a spokesman for the Saints. 
Hugh Weber, the Hornets team president, said: "We consider ourselves a partner of the state ... we're a rev­enue-producing business that provides jobs and opportunities for Louisiana. We are working with state officials to continue serving as an asset for the region." 
Currently, the LSED has about $3 million in revenue to cover the direct cash pay­ments--or $27.5 million less than what is needed to pay both teams, Thornton told lawmakers. He said options could include shuf­fling existing tax dollars or raising new taxes to cover the shortfall. 
That leaves Gov. Bobby Jindal, who opposes tax increases, to struggle with state lawmakers on ways to fill the gap in the fiscal year starting July 1. The state is facing a total budget short­fall forecast to top $1.2 bil­lion. 
.Jindal said Tuesday he intends for the teams to stay, but added, "It's too early for the state to know what we can and cannot afford for the next fiscal year." 
State lawmakers ques­tioned whether the state should continue pumping money into the team pay­ments and asked Thornton for other ideas. 
"1 know it's important, but can we afford it?" said Rep. Tom McVea, R-.Jackson. "We've just got to have some relief, and I think you know that." 
Meanwhile, Jindal's admin­istration is in negotiations with the Saints seeking a new contract to keep the team in Louisiana past 2010. 
Thornton said the state hopes to re-negotiate with the Saints before April 1, the deadline for NFL teams to apply for the 2013 Super Bowl. A long-term deal between both is needed to be in the running to host future Super Bowls. 
In a new deal, Thornton said, the state hopes to "rebalance the risk," moving away from direct cash subsi­dies. In exchange, he said the state could make improvements to the Superdome, like adding more suites, seats and con­cession areas to help the Saints earn more from tick­et, food and drink sales.

Other returning players who earned all-conference honors are senior Linda Kohan, junior Christine Lux and sophomores Katie Fleury and Brianna Jorgensborg. 
Kohan, who mainly plays third base, is an offensive force for the team. In 2008, she bat­ted .302 and had an on-base percentage of .456. 
Lux, a first baseman, is a power hitter who recorded 15 home runs in 2008. 
Fleury, who plays second base and shortstop, is a solid defender and also hit .295 last season. 
The team lost two seniors, Sarah Smith and Katie Laing.

slew of other squads will com­
pete for spots in the top-eight. 
Here's a look at how the race 
looks -starting at the bottom, 
of course, because that's where 
Notre Dame finds itself now. 
Might as well be in the 
Mountain West: 
Notre Dame (12-10, 3-7), 
South Florida (8-15, 3-8), 
St. John's (12-11, 3-8), 
Rutgers (10-14, 1-10), 
DePaul (8-16, 0-12) 
At the beginning of the sea­son, nobody would have guessed the Irish would be in this category. But against every top-tier opponent, the team has looked like a mid-major: no con­fidence, bad decisions, lack of poise. 
On the bright side, Notre Dame still gets to play three of its fellow bottom-dwellers. However, South Florida knocked ofT previously-unbeaten Marquette this weekend. (Dbn't look up at the 1Oth floor of the 
·Hesburgh Library, because 
everyone with tickets to 
Sunday's ND-USF game is about 
to jump.) 
Even Stevens: 
No. 22 Syracuse (18-6, 6-5), 
Cincinnati (16-8, 6-5), 
Providence (15-9; 7-5), 
West Virginia (16-8, 5-6), 
Seton Hall (13-9, 5-6); 
Georgetown (13-9, 4-7) 
Of these six teams, none actu­ally has a .500 record. Still, I just saw the Seinfeld episode where everything always evens out for Jerry and thought "Even Stevens" would be agood name for the group. 
Each of these teams covets a 
spot in the top eight and a sub­
sequent bye on the Tuesday of 
the Big East tournament. But 
only three of the six will be 
seeded that high. The others 
will play on the first day against 
the dregs of the conference 
(plus Notre Dame, most likely). 
Look for Georgetown to make a late push for a top-eight spot. They're not nearly as bad as they've been playing. (Sound familiar?) Plus, the Hoyas still get to face South Florida, St. John's imd DePaul and will take on Marquette and Louisville at home. 
Meanwhile, Cincinnati has been improving steadily as Syracuse and Providence come back to earth. Sweet-shooting Deonta Vaughn and the Bearcats could be good for an upset or two at the conference 
tourney in New York. 
The Starting Five: No. 1 Connecticut (22-1, 10-1), No. 5 Louisville (18-4, 9-1), No. 4 Pittsburgh (22-2, 9-2), No. 10 Marquette (20-4, 9-2), No. 13 Villanova (20-4, 8-3) 
At this point, the top four of this group look like they should each get a top-three seed in the Big Dance. 
On Thursday, Notre Dame gets a chance at a legitimate big win against Louisville. But it won't be easy for forward Luke Harangody to rebound against the Cardinals' front­court of Earl Clark, Terrence Williams and Samardo Samuels, which is playing its best basketball of the year. 
The Irish still have to play Villanova and at Connecticut ­a game that looks increasingly daunting. In the days leading up to the Huskies game, it should be fun to hear all about Hasheem Thabeet's Big East player-of-the-year candidacy even though DeJuan Blair, Jerel McNeal, and even Harangody have been consis­tently outplaying him. The amount of attention Thabeet is getting is kind of like how the Super Bow} gets so much more publicity than the Kentucky Derby and Wrestlemania, both of which are greater sports spectacles. 
Villanova convincingly beat Marquette Tuesday and put itself in good position for a top­four slot. The Wildcats are sit­ting especially pretty consider­ing Marquette's daunting remaining schedule. The Golden Eagles still have to play Connecticut and Syracuse at home and Louisville and Pittsburgh on the road. Their schedule is similar to Notre Dame's, only the exact oppo­site. Look for the Golden Eagles to drop several more contests before they head to Madison Square Garden. 
As the Irish look ahead to matchups against Louisville, South Florida and West Virginia, the next week will likely make or break Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament hopes. One thing is certain, though: the Irish better start winning. Because remember, you need a winning record even to get to the NIT.

Both provided offensive power -Smith led the team with a .370 batting average. She also earned first team all-NFCA regional honors. 
However, they gain four new­comers in freshmen Alexa Maldonado, Dani Miller, Kasey O'Connor and Kristina Wright. 
The 2009 campaign begins this weekend as the Irish trav­el to Tuscaloosa, Ala. to partic­ipate in the 'Barna Bash. The team will travel to warm­weather destinations to play in various invitationals through the rest of winter. 
After a spring break trip to Fullerton, Cal., the Irish begin a six-game home stand on March 18. 
This will be the team's first full season in the new Melissa Cook Stadium, which was com­pleted in April of 2008. 
Their first Big East contest will be against St. John's on March 22 at Melissa Cook Stadium. The Irish finished fourth in the Big East in 2008, but were voted third in this year's Big East preseason poll, which was released in January. They are currently behind Depaul and Louisville, respectively. 
This year's Big East champi­onships will be held in Louisville on May 7-9. 
The Irish reached their 1Oth consecutive NCAA Tournament in 2008. The team lost in extra innings to Kent State at a regional in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
NCAA regionals will be held May 14-15 at various campus locations.
