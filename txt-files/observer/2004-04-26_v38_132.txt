NDSP investigates indecent exposures 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER Senior Staff Writer 
The Notre Dame Security/Police department is investigating five cases of indecent exposure that have occurred on campus since March 18. 
Four of the cases took place on the main campus and involved a student-aged male suspect and a female victim, both men's and women's dorms and to assuage con­cerns about student safety. The Security/Police department tried to eliminate the monitors' positions in 1980 -when lire­watch employees were

St. Joseph County Police, the South Bend Fire Department and Notre Dame 
NDSP director Hex Rakow said. No suspects have been named in the cases. 
On March 18 at 12:30 a.m., a white male, approximately age 20, wearing a white-hood­ed sweatshirt and yellow pants, exposed himself to a female student while she was walking from the Hesburgh Library between Knott Hall and Siegfried Hall. The sus­pect did not attempt to follow the victim, who contacted 
NDSP. 
On March 21 at 3:30 a.m., a female student said she was walking between Farley and Breen-Phillips when a male approached her and asked her several questions. She contin­ued walking and the male exposed his genitals to her as she approached the areas between Washington Hall and Cavanaugh Hall. The suspect,

Students praise the equality change will bring to dorms 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Equality was the key word among. students responding to the changes that will take place in residence hall secu­rity in the fall, as many believe the eurrenl hall mon­itor system places an unfair -and unneeded -empha­sis on safety for female resi­dents. 
"I don't think it's right that they have them only in women's halls," said O'Neill freshman Damian Selal'ani. "It seems kind of outdated." 
Though she described monitors as "a wonderful group of women, Cavanaugh sophomore Elizabeth Callahan also questioned the diserepaney between male and female dorms. 
"It's very sad to know they won't be lHlre next ynar," she said, "but at the same time it's kind of unfair that women's halls had them when men's didn't."

Brake for ducks 
Spring is upon us. The trees and flowers are blooming. There are many little animals running around. Baby ducks follow their mothers around the lakes. In fact, I almost hit one, which would have made me cry. As I left cam­pus Sunday night, I thought about how it should be warmer outside since it is spring and all. 
With all these thoughts bounc­ing inside my Sarah Vabulas head, I began to realize how this

school year thing has become a reality. 
The seniors are actually graduat­ing and not coming back in the fall. I have quite a few friends in this class, so not seeing them this fall is going to be sad, as I will miss them dearly. 
Everyone goes home in less than two weeks. What am I going to do without all my friends? I live, eat and work with my friends -most of whom do not live in Atlanta with me. I have a couple friends from school back home, but it is going to be tough to leave everyone for the sum­mer. 
I'm going to miss campus. I love to see the Dome lit up in the night sky, a shining remembrance which stands tall night after night. I'll miss the beautiful lakes. I'll miss the Grotto ­where can I go to find peace at home? 
So last night, when I had to brake for the ducks crossing the road, it made me realize that I cannot con­trol how fast the time I spend here goes. but I can control how I cherish the time. I need to slow down my life and not rush through all that I do. 
I made a promise to myself to "brake for ducks" every moment I can. I will make sure that I realize how lucky I am to be at school here. I will cherish my friends and the memories that we make together. I will look at the Dome and remember why I chose to come to school here, so far away from Atlanta and all that was familiar to me. 
Although my second year of college is coming to a close -a fact that J can hardly believe to be true -'-I know that I have two more amazing years ahead of me with incredible people to surround me as I learn and grow up. 
I'll miss the seniors, but I'm confi­dent they won't be strangers in my life. I look forward to the fall and am excited about football season and seeing all my friends again -partic­ularly those who went abroad for the semester or year. 
But before I can get ahead of myself again, I need to "brake for ducks" and enjoy what I have in the coming two weeks before the start of summer. Then, I can enjoy my time off from school. come back rested and continue to forge my path into the real world.

No carb couple booted from restaurant 
SALT LAKE CITY-A couple on the Atkins Diet have a beef with a local restaurant after being booted from the buffet for eating too much meat. 
Isabelle Leota, 29, and her husband Sui Amaama, 26, both on the no-carb diet, were dining Tuesday at a Chuck-A­Rama in the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville when the manager cut them off because they'd eaten too much roast beef.

The general manager was carving the meat, and became concerned about having enough for other patrons, Johanson said. So when Amaama went up for his 12th slice, the manager asked Amaama to stop. 
Offended by the request, the couple argued with the manager, then asked for a refund. The manag­er refused, and when the couple refused to leave, he called police.

Dorins coin pete in Fisher Regatta 
By JANICE FLYNN 
News Writer 
Fisher Hall's annual Fisher Hegatta attracted a strong crowd Saturday as many stu­dents turned out to watch their peers sail -or swim ­aeross Saint Mary's Lake. 
The regatta drew 32 boats. with a roughly even field of men's and women's teams. In a head-to-head competition, teams paddled across the lake in makeshift boats comprised of anything from wood to rub­ber to bicycles. 
Teams varied from two to 10 people, although the majority had three to four paddlers. 
Siegfried and O'Neill faced off in the men's final. with O'Neill emerging victorious. Two Welsh Family boats made it to the women's final. 
Fisher's own boat did well, rr.aching the semifinals before losing a close race to Siegfried. 
Like Bookstore Basketball. regatta teams ranged from the serious to the carefree. Most of the races were extremely close, but several boats did not make it across the lake and a few sank the moment they were put in the water. 
"Quite a few people ended up swimming to the other side," said Michael Coogan, one of Fisher's six commis­sioners for the event. 
Many boats were particular­ly original. St. Ed's team secured a bicycle on top of its boat. assembled so that the paddles would move when 



Camp Kesem set 
for second summer 
By KATE GALES 
NewsWrirer 
Camp Kesem, a week-long summer camp for the children of cancer patients, will take place again this summer under the direction of Notre Dame sen­ior Adam Dell. 
Started in 2000 by students at Stanford, Dell and classmate Dan Doherty instituted the first Notre Dame Camp Kesem last summer. 
The camp's mission is to help children with parents who are currently suffering from cancer, or have died from the disease. 
"Most of [the campers] don't know any other kids who have parents with cancer and kind of feel isolated," Dell said. "Camp Kesem is a place to share their experiences, build self-esteem and have a really fun week of camp. It's a break for the par­ents and a really fun time for the kids as well." 
Much of the work is done by the planning committee, which has 22 members. This year, they planned for 40 children to attend the camp and have 37 registered so far. Camp is held at Camp Crosley, a YMCA camp. 
"It's like your typical summer camp -it has a lake, playing fields, climbing wall, ropes course and hiking trail," Dell said. 
The program, for kids age 6 to 13, is offered free. 
"[Funding comes from) a vari­ety of sources -our major one is just private donations." Dell said. "A lot of people involved in the project will send out letters to family or friends or people in the community ... and ask them for donations." 
Additionally, the Alumni Association and various on-earn­pus groups donate money. 
"(We get) a lot of help from Notre Dame student organiza­tions,'' he said. "They've given donations through different fund raising events." 
The committee members also actively recruit future campers. 
"We just go out in the commu­nity and target them," he said, mentioning local hospitals. oncology units, local schools and cancer support units. "We have to have some credentials and show them that were very seri­ous ... We hold an information session and meetings to tell [families] what the camp's about and answer their questions. If the family is interested, they'll fill out an application." 
After last year's suceess and the expansion of the program, Dell is optimistic about the future. 
"We hope it will be a project that continues for many, many years," Dell said. "We have some good leadership for years to come as well."

someone peddled the bike. But it sunk before they could get moving. 
The Regatta was a product of several weeks of prepara­tion by the residents of Fisher. 
The Regatta vied against several other events, both on and off campus, but the com­missioners were very pleased by the turnout. 
Bufalino estimated that attendance was similar to or better than past regattas. This year marked 18 years of the Fisher Regatta. 
"With so many things going on, we had a pretty good draw," Bufalino said.

Army orders armored H utnvees 
Associated Press 
NAJAF -Deafening noise, confusion and fear erupted as the roadside bomb slammed into the U.S. Army Humvee, knocking over Spc. Stephen Monti, who was manning a gun in the turret. 
"Then we started checking whether we still had our 10 fingers on," Monti recalled of the recent ambush south of Baghdad. 
. Not only had all four soldieF5 escaped injury, but the vehicle -which had been fortified by armor plating and bulletproof glass -came through with just a few dents and a cracked windshield. 
"There probably would have been wounds, maybe mortal ones, in your basic Humvee," said Monti, of St. Louis. "Every vehicle that goes out on the road should be 'up-armored.' Your safety is dramatically increased." 
But many in Iraq are not, and attacks against them by roadside bombs and rocket­propelled grenades are driving up the casualty toll. 
On Sunday, a Humvee was engulfed in flames after a roadside bomb struck a U.S. convoy in eastern Baghdad, killing a U.S. soldier. It was not known if the Humvee had the extra armor. 
When the war began, only about 2 percent of Army's 110,000 Humvees were armored. Now, of the nearly 15,000 Humvees in Iraq, about 1,500 to 2,000 are armored, according to the Army. The numbers are increasing. 
The Army is making a "full­court press" to locate and deliver every armored Humvee in its inventory to Iraq, said 
Search is on for armored Humvees 
The Army is making a "full-court press" to send every available armored Humvee in its inventory to Iraq. A soldier's safety is dramatically increased if the vehicle has been fortified.

Maj. Gen. Martin Dempsey, commander of the 1st Armored Division. At the same time, factories are boosting production of the armored ver­sion. 
During the war last year, some Humvees were ambushed as swift-moving U.S. troops bypassed pockets of resistance. 
But the attacks have mount­ed as Iraq became what Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, com­mander of U.S. forces, calls "a 360-degree battlefield," with none of safer rear areas of conventional warfare. 
"They were not intended to be on the front lines," Dempsey said of the unarmored vehi­cles. "In a linear battlefield, Humvees always operated behind the front lines -in most cases even out of artillery range. Iraq isn't a linear bat­tlefield. As we find ourselves in a low-to mid-intensity conflict, and we have all these vehicles designed for a linear battle­field, they come up short." 
The Army is trying to find every heavily armored Humvee "from every other place in the world," Dempsey told The Associated Press. "I saw an e­mail the other day that said there was one uparmored Humvee in Kosovo and they were tracking it coming here." 
In the meantime, soldiers in Iraq are making do. They're hardening their "soft-skins," as unarmored Humvees are called, from kits available at some bases or by getting enter­prising Iraqis to whack steel sheets onto their vehicles. 
Some who have to ride in the soft-skins resort to prayer. 
"It hasn't prevented me from going out, but whenever possi­ble, I bum a ride in an armored Humvee. There is a little extra element of having to trust God more when going out in soft-skins," said Maj. Chip Huey, of Hattiesburg. Miss., chaplain for the 3rd Briga~e. 1st Infantry Division.

China's aid arrives in North Korea 
DANDONG. China-Emergency aid began arriving Sunday at the site of North Korea's devastating train explosion as the death toll rose to more than 160 -nearly half of them children in a school torn apart by the blast. 1\t least 1,300 people were injured. 
The Hed Cross said the explosion destroyed the railway station in Hyongchon, near the Chinese border. and turned the surrounding area into a landscape of huge craters, twist­ed rail tracks and scorched buildings. Thousands were homeless. 
"They've been taken in by other families. We were fearing people on the streets," John Sparrow, a Bed Cross spokesman in Beijing, said Sunday. "We breathed a big sigh of relief when we saw that wasn't the case." 
Pakistan frees accused tribesmen 
PESIIAWAH, Pakistan -In a gesture of reconciliation. Pakistan on Sunday freed 50 men arrested in a bloody counterterrorism offensive ncar the Afghan border, saying investigations proved them innocent. 
Th(l releases came a day after authorities pardoned five renegade tribal leaders accused of harboring al-Qaida fugitives. In exchange, the leaders promised to live peacefully and not help terrorists. 
The deal could end months of fighting between tribesmen and Pakistan's army in the lawless region of South Waziristan, which has emerged as the front line in the country's battle to control tribal militants with strong ethnic and ideological ties to Afghanistan's former Taliban regime. 
Its barren mountains and mud-brick vil­lages have long been believed to be a possi­ble hide-out for Osama bin Laden and al­Qaida's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahri.

500,000 tnarch for abortion rights in D.C. 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Abortion-rights supporters marched in the hun­dreds of thousands Sunday, galva­nized by what they see as an ero­sion of reproductive freedoms under President Bush and foreign policies that hurt women worldwide. 
Amid the clamor of an election year, the throng of demonstrators flooded the National Mall. Their tar­get: Bush, like-minded officials in federal and state government and religious conservatives. 
Speaking beyond the masses to policy-makers, Francis Kissling of Catholics for a Free Choice declared, "You will hear our pro­choice voices ringing in your ears until such time that you permit all women to make our own reproduc­tive choices." 
Women joined the protest from across the nation and from nearly 60 countries, asserting that damage from Bush's policies is spreading far beyond U.S. shores through meas­ures such as the ban on federal money for family-planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad. 
The rally on the National Mall stretched from the base of the U.S. Capitol about a mile back to the Washington Monument. Authorities no longer give formal crowd esti­mates, but various police sources informally estimated the throng at between 500,000 and 800,000 strong. 

That would exceed the estimated 500,000 who protested for abortion rights in 1992. 
Carole Mehlman, 68, came from Tampa, Fla., to support a cause that has motivated her to march for 30 years, as long as abortion has been legal. 
"I just had to be here to fight for the next generation and the genera­tion after that," she said. "We can­not let them take over our bodies, our health care, our lives."

with security monitors. 
Others said they had never 
considered the monitors' 
impact. 
Leal added that he didn't 
think an inside presence was 
a necessity in residence halls 
for either sex. 
"I think dorms are safe for 
the most part," he said. "I 
don't think that's a nai've 
assumption ... I think [the 
monitors] are a bit exces­
sive." 
Pasquerilla West junior 
Tiffany Howell went as far as 
to say she thought the moni-· 
tors served no purpose other 
than "to get us in trouble." 
She also approved of the 
roving officer system that 
Notre Dame Security/Police 
plans to implement. 
"That sounds like a better 
use of our money," Howell 
said. 
However, some female stu­
dents expressed regret over 
losing the monitors, who in 
many cases developed close 
relationships with residents 
because of their long-term 
employment with one or two 
dorms. 
"Personally I think they're 
adorable," said Moira 
Madden, a sophomore in 
Breen-Phillips. "We've defi­
nitely had a close relation­
ship with them." 
She did acknowledge, how­
ever, that the monitors' role 
had become more residence 
life-oriented than focused on 
safety issues. 
"Security wise, I don't 
know how important the 
security monitors are, but as 
a part of the dorm they're an 
important part of the fami­
ly," she said. 
Female resident assistants 
-who several monitors and 
some rectors believe will 
have to pick up much of the 
slack -also offered mixed 
evaluations. 
"I think there is a possibili­
ty for more problems to be 
created for RA's -when 
girls come in drunk, night 
monitors alert us so that we 
can intercept the problem 
before it escalates," said 
Jessica Campbell, a current 
RAin Lewis. "But I can't 
imagine the RA's sitting up 
all night at the desk." 
She added it will be harder 
for ·residence hall staff to 
control parietals, calling the 
change a move she didn't 
anticipate. 
"I was surprised -I 
thought the University would 
go to night monitors in all 
dorms before they would 
eliminate them," she said. "I 
don't like that they say 
they're going to have a rule 
but not enforce it." 
McGlinn RA Sarah Eber 
agreed with Campbell that ·parietals will be the area most affected by firing the monitors. However, she said that while there was poten­tial for change next year, as she has experienced little overlap between the moni­
tors' duties and her own. 
"There have been a few 
instances of heads up when 
they've called me," she said. 
"There's a chance that they 
do things behind the scenes 
that I'm [not] aware of. but 
there hasn't been a lot of 
interaction aside from get­
ting to know them personal­

Price, side effects slam AIDS drug 
NEW YOHK-When the new AIDS drug Fuzcon was launched last year, it was touted as a major breakthrough, with expectations so high it was feared the drug would be in short supply as patients clamored for it. 
Instead, Fuzeon sales are below estimates and analysts are slashing revenue projections. Fuzeon's $20,000-a-year price tag, painful side ell'ecl-; and changing AIDS treatment strategies have made sales a disappointment, one that some experts expect will continue.

GLOBAL POVERTY 
IMF, World Bank discuss Middle East 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -World finance ministers promised on Sunday to do more to deal with the crushing burden of global poverty, promising help in such areas as education, debt relief and AIDS. 
But activists said the weekend meet­ings of the 184-nation International Monetary Fund and World Bank didn't back up warm words with cold cash. 
Separately, the United States said it had made progress pushing a new ini­tiative to bolster peace prospects in the Middle East by promoting econom­ic development and jobs. 
Treasury Secretary John Snow told reporters Sunday that he had been encouraged by the support the United States received on the issue both from potential donor countries and from officials from the region. 
Snow said President Bush wanted the effort to be a key topic at this year's Group of Eight economic sum­mit to be held in June at Sea Island, Ga. Various wealthy countries as well as the World Bank and IMF were exploring ways to provide further 

assistance to the volatile Middle East. "I was encouraged by the receptive­ness that we saw," Snow said. 
Finance ministers from the world's seven wealthiest countries endorsed a proposal to promote economic devel­opment in the Middle East, specifically mentioning the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza along with Iraq and Afghanistan. 
World Bank President James Wolfensohn told a news conference Sunday that there was a "readiness" by the World Bank to support Palestinian economic development.

Despite the long-term pres­ence of female students -and despite recent advances in cell phone technology to respond to emergencies, another reason Rakow cited for the monitors' diminished value -many female rectors still feel that need extensively. 
"I feel terrible about this," said Farley rector Sister Carinne Etheridge, adding that her "colorful, larger than life" monitor Roberta Shupert has been with the dorm for 19 years. 

Replacing the monitors will be six roving ground patrol offi­cers, who will each be assigned to a cluster of four or five resi­dence halls to provide addition­al security -primarily outside, with periodic checks of 24-hour lounges and public spaces ­and to serve as a liaison between the security and resi­dence hall staff, Rakow said.

other monitors provide security within resi­dence halls that the new offi­cers will not be able to replace. 
"I need them roving inside," she said. "[The new officers] are going to be everybody's buddy, but I don't need every­body's buddy. I need somebody here in the middle of the night." 
Walsh rector Sister Patricia Thomas was more open to NDSP's new plan -"part of me is saying the men's halls have had to do this for a long time," she said -but stressed that her monitor will be greatly missed. Howard rector Kathy Brannock also emphasized the personal role the monitors play in the dorm community. 
"I thought their services went beyond the protecting and tra­ditional security efforts," she said. "It's safety in knowing someone's there to talk to when you need to, or security in if something happened at 3 a.m., knowing someone's awake." 
Male rectors praised the increased emphasis on outdoor security. 
"I think the whole campus can benefit from a greater presence, so I think it'll be a positive," Zahm rector Father Dan Parrish said. 
Dillon rector Father Paul Doyle said one officer for four to five dorms "seems appropri­ate, at least on the male side ... we certainly don't need some­body assigned to Dillon." 
Alumni rector Father George Rozum offered a split opinion. 
"For the men's dorms it is positive," he said, "but for the women's dorms I don't know what to think." 
Associate Vice President of Residence Life William Kirk, whose division oversees the Security/Police Department, said rectors' input was consid­ered carefully in the decision­making process in order to frame the security department's changes within the larger scope of campus life. 
"Since it falls under us, every decision like that we try to take that into account," he said. "I know the rectors worked close­ly with Rakow ... Any change is tough at first and I think [rec­tors] are having all the normal reactions." 
Although Rakow and his staff met periodically with Director of Residence Life and Housing Jeff Shoup for input and feed­back, Kirk added, the final decision was "primarily a secu­rity call based on that depart­ment's extensive research." 
Rakow stressed that research when he broke the news to the monitors on Friday night, and invited human resources employees to explain the sever­ance and benefit packages that will be offered. While three of the 14 full-time monitors are in a position to retire, the others were invited to meet with a local group called Career Transitions that will help them ease back into the job market, Rakow said. 
"The University is going to pay for that, our department is going to pay for that, to help the transition," he said, adding that monitors were -welcome to

apply for other University posi­tions. "We're hoping we've done this as compassionately as we can." 
Several monitors, however, questioned NDSP's provisions. 
"They feel, 'Oh you can go out in the workforce,"' one monitor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear that she would not be able to pursue another job at Notre Dame. "My goodness, teenagers can't even get jobs today, let alone 57, 58, 60-year old ladies ... I feel they should say 'You know, this is a big campus, we're going to try to find a job for you."' 
She added that while many other monitors had lost respect for the University, and some had discussed using sick hours instead of returning for the rest of the year, she planned to stick it out and still felt "very fortu­

than from these girls," she said. "I mean you feel like a mother to these girls." 
A second monitor, who also requested anonymity, shared the concern for female resi­dents.

Other monitors declined to comment, citing both legal and emotional reasons, but most agreed that the implications for hall staff will be greater than for the new officers. 
"I can't see where this patrol group they're going to have on the quad is going to help, I think students will just blow them off," a third monitor said. speculating that parietals will be harder to enforce. 
Etheridge agreed. saying she didn't think patrolling the com­mon areas in Farley and other dorms would be an effective way to deter parietals and alco­hol violations. 
"That's not where the action is," she said. Rakow, however, suggested that the new system may actually be more effective in those situations than the monitors had been.

the impact of securi­
ty monitors on pari­etals violations because "you can't measure anything you prevent," and added that as a ResLife regulation, enforcing parietals "really isn't a part of our mission." 

Rakow also stressed that the new system will be constantly evaluated. 
"It'll be a learning process," he said. "We're not in this to make a change that won't accomplish anything."

Judge throws Nichols' defense into disarray 
Associated Press 
McALESTEH, Okla. -Barely 10 days before they start pre­senting their case to a jury, attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols find themselves with­out much of the evidence they planned to usc. 
District Judge Steven Taylor ruled much of the defense evi­dence inadmissible last week. lie didn't, however. bar them from utTering evidence they say indicates executed bomber Timothy McVeigh received sub­stantial help from conspirators other than Nichols with April llJ, llJlJ5, bombing. 
.Jurors may hear suggestions of another conspirator through witness accounts of the so­called John Doe No. 2, whom dozens of people said they saw with McVeigh before the bomb­ing. Authorities have said the man depicted in an FBI sketch turned out to have nothing to do with the bombing. 
The panelists also may hear more grisly testimony about a dismembered leg, found in the federal building's rubble, that Nichols' defense attorneys may suggest was that of an unknown coconspirator. 
Oklahoma's chief medical examiner, Dr. Fred Jordan, tes­tified on Friday that the leg did not match any of the 168 bombing victims and could be from an unidentified 169th vic­tim. 
Billy Joel in third accident 
Associated Press 
BAYVILLE, N.Y. -Singer Billy Joel was involved in his third car accident in two years Sunday when he slammed into a house on a wet road on Long Island. No one was seriously injured. 
There was no evidence that alcohol or drugs were involved and Joel was not suspected of any crime, said Nassau County police Officer Joan Eames. 
Joel suffered a small cut on a finger but refused medical atten­tion, Eames said. 
Joel was alone in the car, and no one in the house was injured, police said. 
A call to Joel's publicist, Claire Mercuri, was not immediately returned. 
Last year Joel was hospitalized after smashing his car into a tree along a Long Island highway. No summonses were issued, and Joel was not given a Breathalyzer test. 
Joel escaped serious injury in a crash in East Hampton in June 2002. 
He later checked into a sub­stance abuse and psychiatric cen­ter, reportedly after becoming depressed when a respiratory infection forced him to cut short a tour with fellow piano player Elton John. 

Joel and model Christie Brinkley, who divorced in 1994, have a teenage daughter, Alexa Ray. Following last year's accident, Brinkley expressed concern about their daughter riding in a car with him. 

Joel, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has had more than two dozen Top 10 hits, including his signature 197 4 song "Piano Man."

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-U.S. gasoline prices climbed 3 more cents per gallon in the past two weeks because of high crude oil prices. tight capacity and rising demand, an analyst said Sunday. 
The nationwide average for all gasoline grades, including taxes, was nearly $1.86 per gallon on Friday, up 3.07 cents from April 9, according to the Lundberg Survey of 8,000 stations nation­wide. 
The average price "has broken all-time record highs for two months straight," analyst Trilby Lundberg said. However, when adjusted for inflation, she said, it remained about $1 a gallon lower than the peak of March 1981. 
Since Dec. 19, the average gas price has risen 34.55 cents, she said. 

The latest increase was prompted by crude oil prices topping $36 per barrel coupled with OPEC production cuts and a growth in crude oil demand, chiefly in the United States and China, Lundberg said. 
Demand for gasoline also is growing, thanks to an improving economy, while refinery capacity is tight and new federal rules for formulating less-polluting gaso­line add to the cost, she said.

If only Pat Tillman were more famous as a football player, perhaps more of them would have followed his example of humility and loyalty. 
He was picked by Arizona State University with their last scholar­

age, graduated summa cum laude in three and a half years) and on the football field (won the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year in 1997 despite being undersized as a linebacker). He was selected as the 229th overall player by the Arizona Cardinals in the seventh and final round of the 1998 NFL Draft, but went on to start 10 games in his rookie season as a safety and set a team record with 224 tackles in his third season. 
Even his modest. unassuming man­ner as a player stands in stark con­trast to the other football players making headlines recently. Consider Ole Miss quarterback Eli Manning, whose status as the most highly-covet­ed collegiate player in this year's NFL Draft evidently went to his head when he "suggested" that the San Diego Chargers should not draft him with the first pick because he didn't want to play for the Bolts, largely perceived as a terrible team. The Chargers obliged, drafting him but trading him to the New York Giants for their pick. North Carolina State quarterback Philip Rivers, and future draft selec­tions. 
Had Manning been more like Tillman, he would have simply been grateful for the opportunity and remained loyal to the team that draft­ed him. In 2001, the St. Louis Rams, who had recently won a Super Bowl and wished to contend for future ones by improving their defense, offered Tillman a five-year contract worth $1.8 million annually. He turned it down to remain faithful to the Cardinals, a team that hasn't been successful in years and that was only paying him less than one-third of what the Rams were offering. 
Consider, also, former Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett, whose effort to sue the NFL to gain entry into the Draft failed last week. Clarett was evidently so motivated to impress NFL scouts that he failed to show up at several of his workouts. Tillman, on the other hand, turned a planned 15­minute tryout for the Cardinals into a 45-minute demonstration because he insisted on repeating each drill until he had executed it perfectly. 
But of course, Tillman's most aston­ishing act of humility came when he turned down the Cardinals' offer for a three-year, $3.6 million contract extension and left the NFL and his family to join the Army's elite Rangers squad in early 2002. And that was all. No fanfare, no saccharin press confer­ence to serve as a soapbox for self­aggrandizement. He did what he felt he was called for: "My great grandfa­ther was at Pearl Harbor and a lot of my family has gone and fought in wars and I really haven't done a damn thing as far as laying myself on the line like that." 
He traded relative anonymity in a football uniform for relative anonymi­ty in a soldier's uniform. and most people simply couldn't comprehend how anyone could walk away from his life to risk it all in some godforsaken foxhole. His then-teammate, Simeon Rice, told a reporter that he thought Tillman was leaving the NFL because he was only an average player and wanted to live out a Rambo fantasy in the military. Rice, by the way, eventu­ally ditched the Cardinals for the more successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a contract worth more than $5 million per season. 

Both Pat and his brother Kevin (who played minor-league baseball in the Cleveland Indians' organization) com­pleted Ranger training, and served a mission in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On a return trip, he visited his former team and, according to coaches, com­manded respect even from the newer players who were never his team­mates. His agent informed him that teams were interested in acquiring him, thinking he was home to stay. But he turned down the opportunity to return to the league as a hero. saying "I made a commitment for three years and I'll fulfill it." 
Tillman was redeployed to Afghanistan where, during a routine patrol last week outside the village of Sperah, near the Pakistani border, his unit was ambushed and he was killed in action. Though his death is more known because of the life he left. he is but one of the 110 soldiers killed in Operation Enduring Freedom. Tillman's family has refused comment, stating that "everyone who has given their lives in the war deserves equal recognition for their sacrifice." It's · interesting to note that the national motto is "e pluribus unum," or "one out of many." Pat Tillman died in that fashion, but lived his life that way as well. 
Perhaps now that Pat Tillman is famous as a fallen soldier, more of us will follow his example of humility and loyalty.

Appealing to natural law 
Fifty years ago, in "Brown v. Board of Education," the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools. That anniversary reminds us that even if the Constitution allowed such segregation, it would still be unjust. That leads to two further questions: Why is legalized segregation, or any other evil, morally wrong and unjust? 
Charles Rice
And how do we know that? The answers are in the natural law. The natural law is not a Christian invention. Aristotle and Cicero aflirmed 
Hight or Wrong?
it. Everything has a law of its nature, 
prescribed by its maker. If you throw a 
rock in the lake, it will sink. The natural 
law that governs human conduct is a rule of reason, implant­
ed by God in man's nature, whereby man (of both sexes) can 
know how he should act if he is to attain his end of eternal 
happiness with God. 
The first, self-evident principle of the natural law, in the words of St. Thomas Aquinas, is that "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided." The good is that which is in accord with the nature of the subject, whether a car or a man. It is good for a car to feed it gasoline, but it is not good to feed it to a man. So also it is not good, i.e., it is evil. for a man to steal, since theft is contrary to that natural human inclination to live in community. 
"Moral truth is objective," Pope John Paul II said, "and a properly formed conscience can perceive it." Whether an act, e.g., murder, objectively violates the natural law is a separate question from the subjective culpability of the person who does it. You arc morally culpable, i.e., blameworthy, only if you knew the act was wrong and still chose to do it. Apart from special circumstances, such as a juror or confessor, we have neither the right nor the capacity to judge the subjective culpability of anyone. 
The natural law is the standard for the civil law as well as for personal conduct. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her scat on the bus in 1955, she made a natural law statement. A law can be unjust, said Aquinas, "when burdens are imposed unequally on the community." Legally-enforced racial segre­gation, whether on a bus or in a school, is unjust because it violates the dignity of the person and undermines community. 
As Aquinas put it, if a human law "deflects from the law of nature," it is unjust and "is no longer a law but a perversion of law." In his "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law." We may be obliged to obey an unjust law, as Aquinas said, to avoid a greater evil of "scandal or distur­bance," but a law that is unjust because it would compel one to violate the Divine law must never be obeyed. 
The question remains: Whose natural law are you going to apply? "The ideas of natural justice," said Supreme Court Justice James Iredell in 1798, "are regulated by no fiXed stan­dard; the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject." Beason can attain to moral truth. But if reason were our only guide, we would be doomed to endless and inconclu­sive debate. Our intellects are weakened by original sin and sincere advocates can be found on both sides of most moral issues. Aristotle sanctioned infanticide. When people disagree, e.g., on the morality of abortion, they can't both be right. As Aquinas tells us, "If ... we consider one action in the moral order, it is impossible for it to be morally both good and evil." 
God gave us the Ten Commandments to spell out the basic obligations of the natural law. But without a visible, authorita­tive interpreter, how are we to apply the Commandments and the natural law In specific cases? 
Pope John Paul II points to the solution: "Christians have a great help for the formation of conscience in the Church and her Magisterium. As [Vatican Ill aflirms: '(T]he Catholic Church is by the will of Christ, the teacher of ... the principles of the moral order which derive from human nature itself.' ... The Church puts herself ... at the service of conscience, help­ing it to attain the truth with certainty and to abide in it.'' Everyone has a pope, an ultimate authoritative interpreter on moral questions. If it is not the real Pope, it will be the individ­ual himself, or CBS, Katie Couric or whoever. 
It makes sense to recognize that we have only one pope, not six billion, and that he is John Paul II because he is the suc­cessor of Peter to whom Christ, who is God, gave the keys. The Church, however, is not an academic "superteacher" of natural law. Rather, she incorporates the natural law, and especially the teachings of Aquinas, into her teaching of the Truth, who is Christ. The papacy is a gift of God, permitting us to be certain as to what conduct is in accord with our nature and the law of God. 
So, on this anniversary of the Brown decision, we ought to remember that all of us, including the state, are subject to what the Declaration of Independence called "the laws of Nature and of Nature's God."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Blame Iraqi insurgents, not 
U.S. soldiers 
Sheila Provencher's April 23 letter discussed the civilian casualties in Iraq and the American troops' "excessive and indiscriminate violence" that alleged­ly led to these incidents. It is always tragic when innocent people are killed, especially women and children, but it is unfair to place the blame for such incidents squarely on the shoulders of U.S. soldiers. Our troops are not fighting a war on a defined battle­field against uniformed militia. Instead, they are bat­tling enemies who refuse to separate themselves from the civilian population. These forces, not the Americans, deserve blame for the Iraqi civilian deaths. 
Provencher spoke of American attacks on a hospi­tal and an ambulance. We saw a year ago that Saddam's military hid weapons in hospitals and schools. In an Associated Press article dated April 24, 2004, Sgt. Aldo Hernandez related that insur­gents attacked his unit by firing assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at their vehicles. After Hernandez and his fellow marines sought cover, rebels poured out of nearby ambulances that they had been hiding in. One U.S. soldier tragically lost his life in the attack. The location of this battle was Fallujah, the same city Provencher spoke of. Maybe that is why U.S. forces chose the targets they did. Maybe it wasn't because they were ordered to usc tactics to "escalate the violence and compromise their own humanity," as Ms. Provencher put it. 
Insurgents in Iraq are guilty of not only hiding in civilian locations, but also of using women and chil­dren as human shields while they fire their weapons from cover. Additionally, the insurgents surround their mortar stations with children to prevent coali­tion forces from firing on them. U.S. troops have reported the occurrence of these incidents in Fallujah, Qusayba, Husaybah, and Hamadi. The Italian military reported the same thing in Nasiriyah. 
There is a reason why the opposition resorts to such despicable acts-they know U.S. troops won't fire at women and children. Contrary to Provencher's belief, our troops do have consciences. She performs a disservice to the men and women serving in Iraq by accusing them of wrongdoing instead of blaming the immoral behavior of the Iraqi insurgents.

Football frustrations 
Andrew Soukup's April 23 column contained com­ments by John Heisler and Dave Duerson that per­fectly illustrated the reason Notre Dame alumni are frustrated with the state of the football problem. Heisler believes the Irish are on the verge of return­ing to the nation's elite, but he adds that the process is a long one that can't suffer "knee-jerk" reactions when a team has a losing season. 
"You can't just flick a switch and guarantee that you'll win games by doing that," Heisler said. "It's not that simple. It's a building process." 
Duerson states, "Every program has its ups and downs, but that is not indicative of the direction the program is heading," he said, later adding, "It's time to move on [from the criticism]. Nobody is more upset about last year's finish than those student-ath­letes and the coaching staff." 
Both statements demonstrate the administration's feeble attempt to characterize alumni dissatisfaction as an inappropriate reaction to one poor season. In fact, the football program has been in decline for 10 years, with an unprecedented three losing seasons in the last five. Alumni should not be ridiculed for stating the obvious. Until this administration acknowledges the problem and commits to fiXing it, Notre Dame football will remain mired in mediocrity. 
The letter to the Board of Trustees signed by 412 alumni and endorsed by thousands of others was a painful yet necessary call to action. The only knee­jerk reaction in this entire process was the ill­advised response issued under the auspices of the Monogram Club without the knowledge or approval of its membership. 
It's time for the administration to quit circling the wagons. It missed a chance to open a private dia­logue with alumni by failing to respond to the letter, but it's not too late. The passion displayed by con­cerned alumni can easily be parlayed into a vast reservoir of emotional and financial support if Notre Dame ceases its attempt to keep them at arms length. 
John Vannie alumnus Class of 1975 April25 

Disrespectful athletes mar Bookstore tradition 
We show up to our-friends' game to realize that they are facing a team with some of Notre Dame's star football athletes. Our friends are psyched to go head-to-head with these guys, not only because it is a privilege to run with some of the best athletes in the country, but also because these are the same guys we cheer for every Saturday. This excitement only makes our friends try as hard as they can to match up. 
The football players, meanwhile, know that we respect them, and they respect our friends for playing their hearts out. We give the football players and other star athletes a hard time to get them off their game. But the players take it in stride; they laugh at our teasing, shrug it off and respond like the athletes they are. The ushers regulate all thefans equally and enjoy the game with us. And when all is said and done, we shake hands with both teams because we know everything was done in fun. And as we walk away from the courts with stories for our friends and family, we wish our fellow students the best for next season. 
Unfortunately, this is not how Bookstore Basketball always is. Instead, genuine effort from our friends and our heckling are seen as threats. Instead, certain football players treat their classmates with disrespect. One of our friends gets choked on the court and another friend faces a demeaning victory dance every time a football player makes a play. We arc told we do not contribute to the school because we do not play football. Instead of having fun stories from a great Notre Dame tradition, we leave bitter, insulted and disappointed. 
There are so many friendly and respectful athletes at Notre Dame, and we respect all the athletes who want to be a part of the close-knit Notre Dame family that we all know and love. Imagine if the others were to follow their lead. What an even closer group we could be.

Tourney captures spirit of school 
In the Final Four of the men's Bookstore Basketball tournament, D.J. Lipke of KPMG threw up a floater over imposing defenders. The ball bounced high off the rim and towards the middle of the lane. 
Varsity football player Jerome Collins leapt into the air. He flushed the rebound. The crowd exploded and a freshman taking a mid-after­noon nap in Keough Hall woke up. 
The kid could have had his window opened or closed. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that not only the freshman but nearly every person on campus knew about Collins' dunk by the time the final game rolled around at 2 

p.m. Sunday afternoon. And that is the effect this tournament has on people on a campus ripe with basketball talent. 
There are students who play every weekday from 3 to 5 p.m. at the Rock in preparation for the outdoor spring tournament. 
There are kids who sprint from their last Friday class to the Rolfs locker room, change into gym shorts and a T-shirt and walk out onto the court yelling, "Who's got next?" 
There are some who never leave the gym. 

And while Mike Brey and Chris Thomas try to take the varsity basketball program to national prominence next season, the sport of basketball and the spirit it creates has already engulfed the historically football-crazed campus in South Bend. 
Fans sat six-deep at the championship game. Others stood four-deep around the court's perimeter. Referees' whistles brought simultane­ous cheers and jeers. 
People cared about every play up-and-down the court because the players were their friends, roommates, teammates, brothers or cousins. 
..._ 
Many of the players Sunday were actually var­sity football players, guys who had just played a full-length, full-pad scrimmage Saturday but were back competing just one day later. 
Wide receiver Carlyle Holiday occasionally defended quarterback Brady Quinn. Converted tight end Collins blocked offensive lineman Dan Stevenson on several occasions. Place-kicker 
D.J. Fitzpatrick drove by safety Chinedum Ndukwe. 

Fans got the chance to see just how great of athletes these guys are, and who ended up win­ning? 
Well. the team with four freshmen, of course. Yes, freshmen. 
And as much as a freshman victory empha­sizes the tournament's positive parity, it never gets easier to watch the pain on the faces of sen­iors whose chance to take the ultimate prize has vanished. 
There are many courts and countless teams, many great names and better games. Bookstore Basketball completed its 33rd year of competi­tion Sunday, and every person on campus could­n't be more disappointed. 
Because we all have to wait until next year.

Injury helps Anthony Travel win 
By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 
The halftime score was 11-10, but most of the preceding play had been five-on-five. In the second half, play­'ng without an injured Christina Esposito, In It to Win It could not defeat the team that knocked them out of last year's Bookstore Basketball tournament. 
Anthony Travel dominated the sec­ond half Sunday, outscoring its oppo­nent 10-2 and winning the women's championship, 21-12. 
"We found holes better with the person down," said Jill Bodensteiner, of Anthony Travel. "I don't think we were playing well in the first half, but in the second we were able to get a couple easy buckets on the fast break for our point guard, Suzanne [Bellina]." 
Esposito went down with a sprained ankle late in the first half.

"They played incredible," Bodensteiner said. "They had great effort and intensity, and [Van Hoegarden] is an incredible athlete." 
Anthony Travel lost in the finals last year and some thought they should have been the No. 2 iq this year's tournament. A committee oversight, however, placed them out of the seed­ing and in the path of tougher oppo­nents throughout the tournament.

Manning becomes a Giant after trade 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -After a tense hour in which Eli Manning was a prospective law student, the NFL's first family of quarterbacks got what it wanted. 
Eli will be a New York Giant. 
In one of the more bizarre first hours in recent draft history, Manning was taken with the first pick by the San Diego Chargers, for whom he earlier announced he wouldn't play. 
Manning then appeared on the stage at The Theatre of Madison Square Garden with his parents, Archie and Olivia, looking as glum as any No. 1 pick ever has as commissioner Paul Tagliabue held up a Chargers jersey with "1" on it. He didn't put on the Chargers hat and boos cas­caded down from the gal­leries. 
An hour later, as Manning walked away from the podi­um at a press conference in which he insisted he would go to law school, someone rushed into the room to say the Giants just obtained him for another quarterback, Philip Rivers, who they had taken with the fourth over­all pick. 
"''m a lot happier now than I was 10 minutes ago," Manning said, jumping 
IN BRIEF 
Rain forces Houston Open 
to Monday 
HUMBLE, Texas -Vijay Singh chipped in for eagle just before play was suspended Sunday to move into a three-way tie for the lead at the rain-delayed Houston Open. 
He was tied with John Huston and Joe Ogilvie at 7 under when play was halted yet again at the Redstone Golf Club. The tourna­ment was interrupted by bad weather for the third straight day. PGA Tour officials hoped to com­plete all 72 holes Monday, when more favorable weather was fore­cast. 
"It finally got to a point late in the afternoon where the golf course, the fairways just were under water," said PGA Tour tournament director Mark Hussell. 
Only 15 players completed their third round, which had been halted by thunderstorms on Saturday. 
Hory Sabbatini shot a 3-under 69 and D.J. Brigman had a 70 and 
back on the podium. He then returned to the main room for a much happier picture, this one including brother Peyton and agent Tom Condon, the man behind the maneuvering. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the draft went on around that soap opera. 
With the second pick, Oakland took offensive tackle Robert Gallery of Iowa and with the third, Arizona chose wide receiv­er Larry Fitzgerald of Pittsburgh, a ball boy for Cardinals coach Dennis Green when Green coached in Minnesota. 
Washington then chose safety Sean Taylor of 

Miami, who was the first of six Hurricanes chosen in the opening round, a record. 
Cleveland paid a high price simply to move up one spot for Miami tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. Detroit got the Browns' first-round pick and their second. 
The Uons then took Texas wide receiver Hoy Williams, who like Taylor and Winslow ranked as players with long-term star poten­tial. And they used a sec­ond-round pick to move up late in the first to choose Kevin Jones of Virginia Tech, considered by some the best running back in the draft. 
were the leaders in the clubhouse after three rounds with a 3-under 213. 
But 14 other players still on the course, led by Huston, Ogilvie and Singh, had better scores midway through their rounds when play was suspended. Huston. and Ogilvie had three holes remaining in their third round. Singh had just made eagle at No. 12 when play was stopped.

SAN FRANCISCO -An attorney for Marion Jones on Sunday reject­ed reports the Olympic track star received steroids from a nutritionist charged with distributing illegal drugs to pro athletes. 
Two newspapers, both quoting sources who requested anonymity, reported Sunday that nutritionist Victor Conte told federal agents he gave performance-enhancing sub­stances to Jones, fellow track star Tim Montgomery and other top ath­letes. 

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Conte, who faces fed­eral charges for his alleged distri­bution of steroids, told federal investigators that Jones and Montgomery received the drugs in exchange for endorsements of his ZMA nutritional supplement.

TALLADEGA, Ala. -This time, the decision went Jeff Gordon's way. 
After a NASCAR ruling went against him a week earlier in Martinsville, Va., costing Gordon a shot at victory, the sanctioning organization handed the four-time Nextel Cup champion a controver­sial win Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway. 
Gordon seized the lead from Dale Earnhardt Jr. with six laps remain­ing and barely beat him, ending DEI's winning streak at Talladega and bringing a rain of beer cans and garbage from the pro­Earnhardt fans.

TRACK AND FIELD 

Weekend meets see Irish enjoy success 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
Like a car going to the mechanic to make sure every­thing is in order before a long road trip, the Irish track and field team received a tune-up this weekend in preparation for next week's Big East Championships. 
The team was split in two as most members competed in the Purdue Invitational while a handful of others participated in the Drake Relays. Overall. there were two Irish athletes who qualified for the confer­ence meet and many others who achieved season-best marks. 
Maryann Erigha led the con­tingent at Purdue, as she was a double-winner in the 100-and 200-meter dashes. Her times of 
12.03 and 24.29 seconds in the 100-and 200-meters respec­tively were season bests as well as conference-qualifying times. 
Austin Weaver was the other runner to qualify for the Big East meet as he finished first in the 10,000 meters in a time of 
31:36.03. Weaver was happy to be able to qualify as this was only the third outdoor meet he has run in all year. 
"Most importantly I feel relieved," said Weaver. "I had been expecting to qualify for the Big Easts all year." 

In the field events at Purdue, Laura Huarte had her best per­formance of the season in the pole vault by clearing a height of 3.75 meters to qualify her for the NCAA regional meet to be held in late May. 
Among the six other Notre Dame competitors to turn in season-best performances were pole valter Dave Viken, throw­ers Chip Roberts and Dan Porter. hurdler Alex Fortunado, sprinter Tricia Floyd and mid­dle-distance runner Elizabeth Webster. 
The squad the Irish sent to the Drake Relays might have been small but it garnered its share of attention. The men's 4x1,600-meter relay team won the competition for the second time since 2002 as Kurt Benninger, Vinnie Ambrico, Kevin Somok and Eric Morrison finished in a time of 16:23. Benninger led the team with an anchor-leg time of 4:02, while Morrison, Ambrico and Somok finished in 4:07, 4:05 and 4:09 respectively. 
In 2002, the 4x1,600 squad of Morrison. Somok, Luke Watson and Pat Conway won the event in a time of 16:39. This is a notable accomplishment for the Irish as the Drake Relays are billed as one of the most com­petitive meets in the country.

Irish roll in weekend games 
ND still undefeated in Big East play 
By HEATHER VAN

·The pitching was solid, the bats exploded and the wins came rolling in. 
After shutting out Villanova (25-18, 9-5 Big East) 4-0, 2-0 on Saturday, the Irish came back Sunday to defeat Rutgers (23-26, 6-10 Big East) 8-5, 4-2.

She also added the first Irish RBI in game two. when she drove in Kenya Fuemmeler with a single in the top of the second. It turned out to be all the Irish needed. 
With the two shutouts, it was the first time Notre Dame has swept Villanova without giving up a run since 2001. 
Sunday was much of the same for the red-hot Irish as they left the Wildcats to face the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers. 
Booth started game one again, but this time gave up four runs in 6 2/3 innings. However, the Irish offense responded, as they jumped out to a 4-0 lead behind deFau. 
deFau finished with five hits on the day. with two HBI in the first game and a 2-for-3 per­formance in the second. Liz Hartmann joined in the efforts with a home run in the first game. her seventh of the season. She was 3-for-4 on the game. 
Meanwhile, in the second game, Stenglein held the Scarlet Knights in check, scattering six hits and striking out nine while allowing two runs. 
In the top of the seventh, the Irish exploded by registering four runs, all coming with two outs. Sara Schoonaert posted an infield hit with Jacquish on first to keep the inning alive for Stephanie Brown. She then hit an RBI double, driving in both runners. After a deFau walk put runners on the corners, Megan Ciolli and Mallorie Lenn hit back-to-hack RBI singles to make give Notre Dame its sec­ond sweep of the weekend.

to hear his name called, as the Dallas Cowboys selected him with the 11th pick in the second round. Then New Orleans picked Watson with the round's 28th pick. 
Sunday, safety Glenn Earl went to Houston with the 24th pick of the fourth round. Two rounds later, the Texans also selected cornerback Vontez Duff with the fifth pick of the sixth round. 
Jim Molinaro, the final Irish player to be drafted, was picked with the 15th pick of the sixth round by the Washington Redskins. 
The five Irish players drafted is the lowest number since 2000, when only Jarious Jackson was drafted. But the Irish haven't had at least two players drafted in the first two rounds since 1997. 

One of Saturday's more mild surprises came with Jones' selection, who some .experts had rated behind other running backs still available (including former Florida State running back Greg Jones and Oregon State back Steven Jackson). But Dallas was impressed with what they saw as Jones' ability to play a significant role early and his quickness. 
"He's got the size to get it done and was durable in col­lege," Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. "There is no reason to think that he can't become a full-time back." 
Then the Saints surprised Irish fans even more by picking Watson in the second round ­even though some analysts thought it would be a triumph for the Irish linebacker to get picked in the third round. Watson was the fourth inside linebacker to be picked. 
"A lot of times you eliminate things when you draft guys; if you get a tough guy, he's not always a fast guy, or a tough or · fast guy isn't always instinctive," Saints director of player person­nel Rick Mueller said. "To a cer­tain degree, this guy has a little bit of everything. I think all around, he's a good player with versatility and a lot of things we're looking for."

Powers-Neal show-s he can double as tailback 
By MATT LOZAR Sports Writer 
Irish coach Tyrone Willingham knows what fullback Rashon Powers-Neal did in Saturday's Blue­Gold game. 
"Rashon is one of those guys that says to a coach, 'Coach, I'm going to change your mind.' The reference is that J've got him at fullback," Willingham said. "The other thing he does is says, 'Coach, you've got to get me more balls.' And I was pleased with that." 
1\vo touchdowns and 81 yards on only four offensive touches will make a coach think like that. 
Especially after Powers-Neal had four rushing attempts for 16 yards and caught seven passes for 50 yards over the 2003 season. 
''I'm going to come out there, play hard and prove to everybody that I am able to play that position and play at a high level," Powers-Neal said. "I went out there and had fun today and played the best I can." 
The coaches only really used four running backs Saturday -Blue starter Ryan Grant, Gold starter Marcus Wilson, Blue starting full­back Josh Schmidt and Powers-Neal. After Grant showed off improved speed and cutting ability in PJe first half of the game, the coaches replaced him with Powers-Neal­who took full advantage of the opportunity. 
He scored on a 4-yard run in the closing seconds of the first half, which capped off an efficient and impressive seven-play, 97-yard drive using the two-minute drill. 
It was when Powers-Neal found the end zone for a second time that really showed where he has made strides. 

His third quarter touchdown where Powers-Neal made a little cut to avoid a defender and ran away from the rest of the defense to find the end zone for a 59-yard touch­down is a perfect example of the two areas Powers-Neal worked hard on in the off-season -speed and catch­ing. 
In 2003, Powers-Neal dropped a number of passes: especially coming out of the backfield in the flat. That improvement came from what Powers-Neal said is concentrating more when the ball is coming his way. 
As for outrunning the defense to the end zone, that's also something Powers-Neal didn't show last year in his transition from running back to fullback. With all the weight he gained, the speed seemed to be missing. 
"I worked really hard on that in the off-season, getting my speed up, and it's kind of showing up now," Powers-Neal said. "I like to think I was always fast, especially with all the weight I've gained." 
With the small number of running backs on the team Saturday, the coaches gave him a chance to make a statement, and he did. 
"If Rashon keeps doing what he's doing, he's going to make me change my mind and move him, so we have some flexibility there," Willingham said. 
AS for questions about whether he's too big to play fullback, Powers­Neal feels that's not really an issue. 
"I could probably play tailback [with the size]," he said with a big smile.

Samardzija runs, then flies 
Hours after catching touchdown pass, receiver catchesflight 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Only a few hours after catch­ing the only touchdown for the Gold team in the Blue-Gold game Saturday, Jeff Samardzija ran to make a 6:20 
p.m. flight to Pittsburgh with the rest of the Notre Dame baseball team. 
After all, he was scheduled to start in game one of Notre Dame's doubleheader against the Panthers Sunday. 
"There are literally days where he walks right off the football field and goes over to the baseball diamond," Irish 
coach Tyrone Willingham said. "It's phenomenal that he's able to do both sports, and that he's also able to manage his academics so well." 
Samardzija was a high­school standout in football, basketball and baseball when he was being recruit­ed by the Irish, and said that there have been no conflicts so far between the two sports he plays in a Notre Dame uniform. 
"It's just something I try to put out of my mind and not let one carry over to the other," Samardzija said. "[Willingham and baseball coach Paul Manieri] are fair and understanding and they both know what is best for me and I pay attention to what they have to say." 
Samardzija was the los­ing pitcher in Notre Dame's 8-6 loss to Pittsburgh Sunday.

No more red jersey 

Receiver Carlyle Holiday caught a quick pass from Brady Quinn in the second half of the Blue-Gold game Saturday and lowered his shoulder to try and run over safety Freddie Parrish in an attempt to gain more yards on the play. 
That's a far cry from previ­ous Blue-Gold games, where Holiday started as qu~rterback and it was taboo to make any contact with him at all. 
"They took away my red jer­sey," Holiday joked. "Now I'm out there working hard and trying to be as physical as I can be and try to use the strength that I have. 
"As a quarterback you're always dropping back and get­ting high, so this spring I had to learn how to run low more so that's what I've really been working on." 
Just give them all the ball 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn completed passes to eight different receivers on Saturday for the Blue team, while his Gold counterpart Pat Dillingham completed passes to seven different receivers. 
Tight end Billy Palmer and fullback Josh Schmidt -along with receiver Rhema McKnight -tied for the most receptions with three, and fullback Rashon Powers-Neal had the longest reception of the day, a 59-yard touchdown. 
"One of the things we want to do is use all the guys on the field and make it to where the defense has to put someone on every player," Quinn said.

"There's really a more younger influence [this year as compared to previous one's]," said junior Karen Lotta, the old­est Notre Dame golfer competing this weekend. "The freshmen and sophomores have helped lead the team, and they've pushed upperclassmen to play their best." 
Individually, these young stars consistently shined, with four of Notre Dame's five entrants fin­ishing in the top 10. Freshman Noriko Nakazaki finished third with 222, with her tournament low 70 coming between rounds of 75, and 77. Finishing right behind her teammate was .soph­omore Katie Brophy, who played consistently well, shooting two 75s and a 74 to finish in fourth place with 224. 
Lotta finished in seventh, shooting 81, 72, 76 in her three rounds to finish with a 229. Sophomore Sarah Bassett fin­ished four strokes behind her, finishing with round of 74, 76, and 83 to total a combined 233. Sophomore Suzie Hayes round­ed out the Irish contingent, scor­ing 245 with rounds of 78-84­83. 
Despite their best performance of the spring this past weekend and the fact that they are con­ference champions, the Irish still may not be invited to next week­end's NCAA Hegionals. 
"A lot of it will have to do with things out of our control," King said. 

Since the Big East has only held a women's golf tournament for two years, its champion does not earn an automatic spot in the NCAA Tournament, with automatic invitations only being issued to teams whose confer­ences have held championship tournaments for three years or more. As such, The Irish must compete for an at-large bid. 
Notre Dame must also rely on a little luck, hoping that no upsets occur in other conference tournaments, which could take away one of the few remaining slots from the Irish. 
"It really depends on what other teams win their confer­ences," said King. "You hope teams ranked ahead of you win their conference's automatic bid." 
Hegardless of whether Notre Dame gains an NCAA bid, which would be a first for the program. the Irish can be satisfied in the accomplishments of this young team in a year that has been called the best in program histo­ry. 
"It's the start of a new begin­ning," King said. 
However, as one era begins another must necessarily end, and the prevailing satisfaction of victory and the optimism of future success is made bitter­sweet by the quiet departure of the team's two senior captains, Hebecca Hogers and Shannon Byrne. 
"We're really going to miss our seniors," said King. "We dedicat­ed our win to them."

The Irish were able to capi­talize from there on out and sailed to their fourth Big East title and first since 1997. 
"We're a young team, with only freshmen and sophomores playing up to this point," coach Jasinski said. "These young guys have been put in the fire. All those things you learn from playing, they haven't gotten yet. Every week it's been learn your lessons the hard way.

Irish crowned Big East champions 
Notre Dame eclipses defending champion Syracuse by 34 points 
By CHRISTINE 
ARMSTRONG 
SportS Writer 
For the first time in the rowing program's short his­tory, No. 17 Notre Dame was crowned Big East champs Sunday after winning four out of five races on Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester, Mass. The Irish beat the three-time defending cham­pions Syracuse by an aston­ishing 34 points. Notre Dame's coach, Martin Stone, was also named Big East Coach of the Year. 
Notre Dame's outstanding times garnered the Irish 116 team points. Miami followed the Irish with 92 and the three-time defending cham­pion Orangewomen finished third with 82. Rutgers, Georgetown, Boston College, Connecticut, Villanova and West Virginia rounded out the rest of the Big East group. 
The varsity eight boat won in in 6:54.89, topping the Orangewomen's 7:00.43. Miami finished in 7:01.95, 

followed by Boston College in 7:04.13, Rutgers in 7:04.25 and Villanova in 7:04.29. 
In the second varsity eight race, the Irish crossed the finish line in 7:09.17 to win the Grand Final, more than four seconds ahead of the Hoyas. Miami had a third place finish in 7:13.37, fol­lowed by Syracuse in 7:13.51, Rutgers in 7:19.23 and Boston College in 7:33.27. 
But the Irish weren't done yet. The next Irish victory when their varsity four boat triumphed in the Grand Final race. With a 7:36.66 finish, the Irish easily beat the Hurricanes by more than nine seconds. They were fol­lowed by Syracuse, Rutgers, Connecticut and Georgetown. 
Finally, the Irish continued their dominance in the varsi­ty four races, taking first and fourth places in the Grand Final race. Notre Dame's A crew won the race in 7:35.74, ahead of the Orangewomen's 7:56.41 effort. Georgetown took third place in 7:56.76. Notre Dame's B boat finished fourth in 8:00.29. Rutgers and Boston College followed.

WOMEN'S lACROSSE 
Team falls just short of wins 
By MATT MOONEY Sporrs Writer 
So close, and yet so far away. 
Such was the case for the No. 6 Irish this weekend as their losing ways continued following a pair of tough one-goal losses -a 13-12 defeat against No. 9 Johns Hopkins (12-3) Friday and then a 7-6 loss to Rutgers (7~ 7, 3-3 in the Big East) Sunday. 
Notre Dame (10-4, 3-2) now finds itself searching for an expla­nation having now lost four con­secutive games after starting the season with a perfect 10-0. 
"I just do not have the answer," coach Tracy Coyne said. "If I had the answer we wouldn't have lost the game today." 
And after a quick Johns Hopkins goal, the Irish put together a streak of their own. They scored four of the next five goals, tying the game at 12 when Mary McGrath slipped the ball past Blue Jay goalie Lauren Riddick on a wrap­around play for her third score of the game. 
It looked like the Irish might have finally turned the corner in the game, maintaining a sustained attack with a chance to take the lead when Simon was awarded free position. But her ensuing shot was blocked and the Blue Jays regained possession and scored the go-ahead goal with only 3:24 to play. 
Working against the clock, the Irish retook possession with 40 seconds

exploded in the first half for three goals and three assists to carry the team to a 7-6 halftime lead after a back and forth first half. 
But Johns Hopkins burst out of the gate in the second half, tallying the first four goals to take a 10-7 lead after only 5:28 had elapsed. After Coyne called a timeout to regroup, the Irish responded immediately scoring not less than a minute later.

coach 
Blue Jays took the ball and ran down the clock. 
Simon led the way for the Irish on Friday, scoring all six of her points in the first half. She had a hand in six of the seven first-half goals for Notre Dame. Simon's first goal, in which she completely faked Riddick out of the net, also marked the 1OOth goal of her career. Only two other players in school history have ever reached the century mark. 
But none of the Irish goals came easily. The Blue Jays employed a physical, aggressive defense which caused the Irish a great deal of dif­ficulty setting up their attack. 
Additionally, the Johns Hopkins offense was the most potent Notre Dame had seen. The 13 Blue Jay goals are the most scored against the Irish in a game all season. 
The Rutgers game ended in just the opposite fashion to Friday's contest. The Irish had staked themselves to a 6-5 lead with just over one minute to play behind pair of goals from Abby Owen and Lauren Fischer. But the Scarlet Knights scored on a free posses­sion goal from Jamie Farewell with 1:09 to play. 
After recovering an Irish turnover following the ensuing face-off, Rutgers came down on the attack and scored again with only 20 seconds remaining. Notre Dame could not muster a shot as the clock ticked. 
A failure to capitalize on those chances ultimately doomed the Irish, who managed only one sec­ond-half goal, very similar to the low output in an earlier loss to Northwestern. 
"Ultimately it's my responsibility to figure out what the problem is and to come up with a solution that gets the team back on track," Coyne said. "I just have to get some perspective."

BIG EAST GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS 

A clean sweep 
Men rally late to win first Big East title since 1997, earn bid to NCAA Regionals for first time in history 
By ANNIE BRUSKY Sports Writer 
With their season on the line, the Irish finally pulled it all together. 
After a thrilling come-from-behind rally, the men's golf team won the Big East Championship and is headed to the NCAAs for the first time in 38 years. 
"We're thrilled," sophomore Tommy Balderston said. "Everything we've done in the season has been leading up to this point and coming through today has been really, really great." 
"It's been a long time coming for us," said sophomore Scott Gustafson. "It's been a long, tough spring season. It feels great to finally break through like this." 

The Irish defeated three-time defend­ing league champion Virginia Tech by six strokes with a team score of 876 (290-295-291) and a well-balanced attack that included three all-confer­ence finishes. 
Balderston (74-73-71) and freshman Cole Isban (69-75-74) tied for third place at eight-over par 218, both recording their lowest tournament score of the spring. 
Meanwhile, sophomore Eric Deutsch's breakthrough performance landed him in a tie for fifth place at 219 (74-71-7 4), a full 13 strokes better than his previ­ous low score in the spring, and earned

Young women's team uses tremendous second round to capture first, now wait to see if they'll make NCAAs 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's strong performance in the 2004 Big East Tournament may translate into an even brighter future for the program. 
The team cruised to a 14-stroke victo­ry in this weekend's event held at Notre Dame's Warren Golf Course, turning in a three-round score of 905, only five shots over the team's goal of 300 per round. Perhaps even more noteworthy is the fact that the Irish did so with such a youthful lineup, perhaps serving as a sign of things to come. 
"We're moving in the right direction," Irish coach Debby King said. 

The Irish led the tournament from the start. The team finished round one ahead of second-place Miami by four strokes, shooting a 302 to the Hurricanes 306. Then the Irish caught fire, blowing out the Hurricanes in the second round with the tournament's lowest round, 293, to build up a 19­stroke lead before Saturday's play had ended. 
On Sunday, with the championship already seemingly in hand, the Irish fin­ished strong, shooting a 310 to win their second straight conference title, and much of their success can be attributed to the efforts of their young and talented nucleus of players.
