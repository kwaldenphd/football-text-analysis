Despite major economic trouble, Notre Dame diploma still valuable

The fate of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, for­merly two of the nation's top investment banks, reflect<; a "scary time" in the investment community, Lee Svete, Director of the Notre Dame Career Center, said. 
"We don't know yet what the dominant effect will be," he said. 
The once-reliable companies' failings affect Notre Dame student<; of all majors, Svete said, in a volatile job market. 
"Hight now, it's going to impact our job market for student<; who want to pursue investment banking but do not have an internship on their resume," he said.

Dow Jones loses more than 500 points on Wall St.'s worst day in seven years 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The upheaval in the American financial system sent shock waves through the stock market Monday, producing the worst day on Wall Street in seven years as investors digested the failure of one of its most venerable banks and wondered which domino would be next to fall. 
The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 500 points, more than 4 percent, its steepest point drop since the day the stock market reopened after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. About $700 billion evaporated from retire­ment plans, government pension funds and other invest­ment portfolios. 
The carnage capped a tumultuous 24 hours that redrew

Dozens of Notre Dame students are brainstorming to come up with their best entrepreneurial ideas after the inaugural Notre Dame Ideas Challenge began Sept. 8 with a kickoff event at Legends. 
This Ideas Challenge, which allows students to make their pitch on a variety of concepts, is organized by the Gigot Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. This new program supplements The Center's annual Notre Dame Business Plan Competitions. 
"The idea ean be from any disci­pline and is designed to encourage student'> to think outside the box ­to stretch their mind a'> to what is possible," said Karen Slaggert, senior administrative assistant at the Gigot Center.

The competition is designed to attract participants from across the University. 
"IThel Ideas Challenge is open to all Notre Dame graduate and w1dergraduate students," Slaggert said. "Designed to be less intimi­dating than our annual Business Plan Competition, the Ideas Challenge is perfect for student'> in all colleges and all majors on cam­pus."

29 arrested at Michigan game Saturday 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT 
News Writer 
One person was arrested during Saturday's Notre Dame-Michigan football game and taken to jail for a felony charge of assaulting a police officer and resisting law enforcement, and 22 others were arrested and transported to jail during the game for alcohol related offenses, Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) assis­tant director David Chapman said. 
Police made 29 total arrests this weekend on the Notre Dame campus. NDSP made the arrests in conjunc­tion with the Indiana State Excise Police, St. Joseph County Police and the South Bend Police Department. 
Five people were arrested and transported to jail for public intoxication, one of whom was charged with pos­session of false identifica­tion. One individual was arrested and jailed for tres­passing and re-selling tick­ets on campus. 
Two citations were issued inside the stadium for minors consuming alcohol while only two people were asked to leave the stadium, compared to nine ejections last week for "violations of stadium rules," Chapman said in an e-mail to The Observer Monday. 
One person was taken to the hospital for intoxication, police said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Facebook etiquette 
My fellow Fal'!~bookers: 
It has eome to my attention recently that there are several problems in our favorite social networking land. And no. I'm not rdi~rring to the new Faenhook. I'm 
talking about Kaitlyn Conway etiquette, peo­
ple. What has Scene Writer 
happened to the days of dassy Facebooking? There are eertain things, my friends, that are aeenptable, and certain things that are 
not. 
I feel like this is a large issue, some­thing that can't be fully diseussed in one column. So today, I will hold myself to one target of these Face book faux-pas: the wall. 
I think that there are several things you should never do on a Facebook wall. First and lilfmnost: You should never ask someone on a date via Faef\book wall. 
That's just embarrassing-both for you and the person you're inviting out. Do you really want yow: humiliation to be public if you get turned down? And honestly, it's just not at all dassy. Save that for a Faeebook message -then it's acceptablt~. 
Thoro is one oxeeption to this: a eompletely over-the-top invitation to woo your potential mate. In this case, it's probably not even a potential mate, morn like a good frinnd you can mess around with li1r thn purpose of a Facebook scandal. 
Those invites should look something like this: "My dearest. darlingest !insert name hernl. My life will be eornph~toly lonely and incomplete if you do not join me ltonighUthis week­end! aUin Imy SYR, formal, the dining hall, my bod. etc. I I eannot live without you. Yours forever, [your name!." Anything but this obvious display of all'!~ction is unneeessary for your Fac:ehook wall. Don't make the mis­take of having it be~ serious. 
Thn second faux-pas: Giving people your number via wall. Umm, open invitP on stalkers, anyone? Again, keep it to the Faeebook message. No one wants creeper phone calls late at night, and that is exactly what you arc opening yourself up to. Pnss on it. 
Then there's always the adventures peoplP get into when they are, hmm, shall we say, not in the right state of mind. It sePmPd like a perfectly good idea to write on your ex's wall last night, but now that it's morning, your headache, bad spelling, and atrocious grammar say that it wasn't. Not at all. I know that this one is harder to resist­sometimes, you really just want to say: "lleyyyyui!!! WAZUPLK??" 
llowever, the real answer here is not to harass people while you are ... indisposed. Save that for when you're sober, and won't have to wonder why you just wrote on the wall of someone you'vp never met before, but are l'riends with anyhow (an entirely dif­liwent problem). 
I leave you with this wisdom: Follow those rules to save everyone else the pain of your awkwardness. Keep Facebook classy, folks -and start with the wall.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Council selects task force issues 
Dorm life, technology, new student integration, security among topics to be addressed 
By AARON STEINER 
News Writer 
After reviewing the topics discussed at the previous Campus Life Council (CLC) meeting and adding a few additional points, CLC mem­bers decided Monday on the creation of three task forces. 
The task forces will cover a variety of student life issues, but will focus on three general topics: technology and study spaces within the dorms, stu­dent safety issues and a final task force on other dorm life issues, including welcoming new students to dorm life at Notre Dame. 
Sustainability was also dis­cussed as a possible task force, but council member and assistant vice president for Student Affairs Sr. Sue Dunn suggested that sustainability be an overarching topic of consideration for all the task forces throughout the year, rather than having its own force. The Council agreed with Dunn. 
The task force on technology and study space issues within the dorms arose from discus­sion on a variety of topics. 
During the previous CLC meeting, members discussed the lack of an accessible and user-friendly. central calendar system. Council member David Wilbur, who is the off­campus Student Senate repre­sentative, sitid the Student Senate's technology commit­tee, which he sits on, is work­ing with OIT to start using Google Calendars. 
Wilbur said that eventually, in addition to dorm, club and other University events, pro­fessors would be able to use the system. 
"The plan is eventually to put professors' syllabuses up there as well, so homework is up there," Wilbur stated. 
Fr. Pete McCormick, rector of Keough Hall, discussed the plan in place to put Pharos printers in all dorms. This plan has not been carried out, although Wilbur stated it was still being worked on. 
The second task force, cen­tered on student safety and security issues, will address both on-and off-campus secu­rity issues. 
Improving relationships with South Bend taxi services, organizing a forum for off­campus students to learn about issues affecting students off campus, addressing the relationship between students and Notre Dame Security Police and finding where spe­cific safety issues may exist on campus are among the topics this task force will address. 
"On Mod Quad there is a pathway between the dorms 
that is not well lit," Lyons Hall Student Senate representative Catherine Flynn said. "Maybe if we can find a way to light that up a bit, that would help." 
Flynn had also mentioned security concerns inside Hesburgh Library at the previ­ous CLC meeting. McCormick said that working to create a bike path or safer environ­ment for bikers around the Notre Dame campus should be a consideration for the task force. 
The final task force will encompass the issues affecting both freshman and other. new students at Notre Dame and a variety of other dorm life issues. 
The task force will review the changes made to Freshman Orientation this past fall, consider ways to bet­t\')r organize and synthesize the information that new stu­dents receive upon entering the University, and other dorm issues, including monetary and funding issues and dis­parities between dorms. 
While the Council consid­ered having more than three task forces or changing the concentration of task forces at the end of the semester, Sr. Mary Lynch, rector of McGlinn Hall, stated it would be wiser to plan to work for the entire year. 
"It really does take time to track down all the people you need to connect with, ... have meetings ... and provide feed­back," she said. "It really does take close to a year." 
However, Fr. Jim Lewis, rec­tor of Carroll Hall, said that the CLC is open to reorganize and restructure the task forces throughout the year, as the group sees fit. 
The members will be assigned to the three task forces over the next week, and task force chairs will then be selected.

offenses such as minor con­sumption or minor in pos­session of alcohol outside the stadium. 
The 17 tickets issued Saturday show a decrease compared to the Notre Dame-Michigan game in 2 006, where 40 alcohol­related tickets were issued and 25 people were ejected from the stadium, accord­ing to comments made by NDSP director Phil Johnson in a Sept. 19, 2006 Observer article. 
Chapman reminded stu­dents that "NDSP will con­tinue to work with other area police officials for all home football games," and that "unlawful behavior should be reported to NDSP by calling 574-631-5555" or by using a call box located in the parking area. 
"If your football weekend festivities include the use of alcoholic beverages, remember to follow Indiana laws and drink responsi­bly," Chapman said. "

been present in the past. Notre Dame students interned at both companies l&'it summer, he said. 
The Career Center does not know if any student'i had aecepted job offers at Lehman Brothers before the investment bank col­lapsed Monday, but Svete said stu­dent'> had accepted offers at Merrill Lyneh, which was aequired by Bank of America. 
"We still don't know what's going to happen yet because Bank of Ameriea h&'in't made a decision," he said. 
The two eompanies' downfall are not necessarily indicative of the investment banking field as a whole, Svete said, &'i some middle market banks and other financial services and companies are still hiring. 
"It's important that the middle market is still here in a big way," h~ said. "But in this crazy market, with the bigger businesses in trou­ble, it could change." 
Houlihan Lokey -one of the middle market banks Svete men­tioned -is coming Tuesday to recruit on campus. Commereial banks, like PNC Bank and Fifth Third Bank. have also reeruited at the University. 
"To some extent, we knew it was going to bn a volatile job market for investment banking," he said. 
During the Wall Street Forum last week, 178 firms, including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, said they would hire interns for summer 2009, but analysis on rneruiting in the fall is currently on hold, Svetc said. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Lehman Brothers were present. 

The Career center is advising that student'> be "flexible" to adapt to the changing job environment. 
lie said lloulihan Loeky was an example of a middle market frrm where students ean employ the same skills they would use in a position at one of the bigger com­
panii~S. 

Other corporations, like Whirlpool and General Eleetrie, are recruiting student'> of all majors for a number of leadership opportuni­ties. 
Students should realize, Svete said, that they can "work for a eompany like Whirlpool and utilize their skilL" -these are still leader­ship positions" 
"It might not be an investment bank, but they're getting some­where with a Notre Dame degree," he said. 
In the past few years, Sw~te said, gency Joan to stay above water. 
"AIG still remains financially sound," Paterson said, even as the company's stock tumbled almost 60 percent. Almost $20 billion was wiped ofT AIG's balance sheet on Monday. 
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who refused to toss a financial lifeline to Lehman, was unapologetic as the Bush administration signaled strongly that Wall Street shouldn't expect more rescues from W&'ihington. 
The American people should remain confident in the "sound­ness and resilience in the American financial system," Paulson told reporters at the White House. 
Six months ago, Paulson movocl to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns, brokering a deal for JP Morgan Chase & Co. to buy the firm at a fire-sale price with Fodera! Heserve backing. Earlier this month, he stepped in to help the government seize Fannie and Freddie in hopes of reversing the housing and cn1dit crises. 
But Monday, Paulson said he 
Notre Dame has had "more and 
more students land jobs and 
internships with investment 
banks." He said he sees Mol)day's 
collapse as more of a market cor­
rection. 
"This industry's going to bounce 
back," he said, "and it's going to 
look differently." 
This is Svete's ninth year at the career center and during his tenure he has witnessed the effects of the Enron fraud scandal and 9/11, and has watched students bounce back. 

"With Enron, the 40 accounting majors that had jobs going into April, one day they just didn't have jobs. They all found jobs by the end of May," he said. "After 9/11, the Career Fair went from 100 compa­nies to 35." 
Svete said that in a tough job market, a Notre Dame diploma becomes even more valuable. 
"I think our students are going to be fine," he said. ''I'm not saying it's not going to be tough out there, that it's not going to be competitive. Students are going to work a lot harder." 

The reasons for the value of a Notre Dame diploma are two-fold, Svete said. The first reason is the strength of the alumni community. 
The second is "how diverse and flexible and well-educated our grads are." he said. "If I'm a com­pany that was going to hire 10 eol­lege grads ... and I was going to keep one school on my calendar, we're going to be one of those sehooL'i." 
Svete said that is the reason "why 152 eompanies and 400-plus recruiters are at our career fairs." The winter Career Fair is sched­uled to take place Jan. 28. 
'The companies, organizations and grad schools will realize that our degree, our reputation, our integrity -all the things we bring to the table in a highly eompetitive market will only make us more valuable in the long run," Svete said. 
Notre Dame's reeent national rankings -18th overall in the U.S. News and World Report and 3rd best undergraduate business pro­gram in BusinessWeek Magazine ­indicate that "we'll be the last school to be cut by recruiting," Svete said. 
"If we get cut, so will Stanford, Duke and Harvard." The second­tier schools, however, are "going to take a big hit this year," he said. 
Advising numbers at the Career Center are up, and a record num­ber of underclassmen attended last week's Career Expo, Svete said.

Female bomber kills 35 in Iraq 
BAGHDAD -A suicide bomber blew her­self up Monday among police officers who were celebrating the release of a comrade from U.S. custody, killing at least 22 people, Iraqi officials said. Separate bombings in Iraq killed 13 other people. 
The suicide attack happened in Diyala, a province northeast of Baghdad where Sunni insurgents have carried out persistent attacks despite security gains elsewhere in the country. The female bomber targeted the home of a police commissioner who had been detained by American troops for allegedly cooperating with the Mahdi Army, a Shiite militia. 
Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim al-Rubaie, the mili­tary commander in Diyala, said most of the 22 fatalities were police and that 33 people were wounded in the evening attack in Balad Ruz, 45 miles northeast of Baghdad. Two police captains and three lieutenant colonels were among the dead, said a police officer who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.

Mugabe shares power after 28 years 
Political rivals sign power-sharing agreement intended to help economy 
Associated Press 
HARARE -President Robert Mugabe ceded some power in Zimbabwe for the first time in 28 years, sign­ing a power-sharing deal Monday with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai amid questions on how the fierce enemies will work together to fLx the collapsing economy. 
Thousands of supporters of the rival parties threw stones at each other as the ceremony got under way and several hundred broke through the gates of the convention center where it took place. Police fired warning shots and set dogs on the crowd, which calmed and cheered as their lead­ers left after the signing. 
Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara, leader of a faction that broke away from Tsvangirai's party, all pledged to make the deal work. But long-simmering and bitter differences as well as the nation's econom­ic collapse -inflation is officially running at 11 mil­lion percent -have put the deal under intense pres­sure.

Feds give housing relief to Ike victims 
WASHINGTON -The federal government will offer a three month moratorium on mortgage foreclosures that are insured by the Federal Housing Authority to residents living in Texas and Louisiana disaster areas. 
This is one of several disaster assistance programs the federal department of Housing and Urban Development will offer, according to the administration. 
In addition, the federal government plans to give state and local governments feder­ally guaranteed loans to rehabilitate hous­ing, and for public infrastructure repair and economic development.

Bush said the hurricane's toll on refiner­ies and pipelines is creating "an upward pressure on price" on people. 
"There's going to be a pinch," Bush said after a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts. "I wish it wasn't the case, but it is." 
Gold, silver retain value during crisis 
NEW YORK -Gold prices managed a lackluster rally Monday as Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and the sale of Merrill Lynch battered stocks and boosted the allure of safe-haven assets. Silver also rose. 
Other commodities traded mixed, with crude oil plunging more than $5 a barrel and most agriculture futures trading higher. 
After more than a week of sharp declines, gold found a few buyers Monday as investors scrambled for safe places to put their money after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protec­tion and Merrill Lynch & Co. was sold to Bank of America Corp -stunning develop­ments that radically altered the U.S. finan­cial world. 
ELECTION 2008 

Candidates respond to crisis 

McCain, Obama attempt to seize control over growing economy issue 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -With chaos rocking financial mar­kets, John McCain assailed "greed and corruption" on Wall Street and promised to clean it up. while Barack Obama blamed White House policies and said his oppo­nent would only deliver more of tho same. 
The prnsidential candi­dates struggled on Monday to seize control of the issue voters say is most important -the economy -with Republieans and Democrats alike saying the man who succeeds may well win the election. 
However. in a dizzying day of speeches and statements, neither White I louse hopeful offered any fresh ideas for turning things around. Instead eaeh relied on the same vague, though vastly different, pitches he has sounded over the past few months for lixing what ails the country.

Crutnble sparks int'l reactions 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -Asian stock mar­
kets tumbled Tuesday amid 
growing fnars of a global 
financial crisis as investors 
reacted to the demise of two 
of Wall Street's biggest 
names, Lehman Brothers 
and Merrill Lynch. 
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 5.3 per­cent to 11,560.66 in mid­afternoon trading, while Hong Kong's blue-chip liang Seng Index shed 5. 7 percent. Both markets -Asia's two biggest -had been elosed for holidays on Monday, when news 11rst broke about the dramatic events on Wall Street. 
Across tlw region, markets were all deep in the red. S o u t h K o f!~ a 's K o s p i was down 5.4 percent, Taiwan's benchmark was ofT 4. 7 per­cent and China's Shanghai index was down 3.2 percnnt. 
Japan's c1~ntral bank on Tuesday injoetod 2.5 trillion yen ($24 billion) into money markets and issued a state­ment vowing to take meas­ures to maintain stability in tho country's l'inancial mar­knts. Cabirwt ministers, along with the central bank chief, wen~ also holding an emergency mnnting. 
"Thn Bank of Japan will carefully monitor recent sit­uations surrounding the U.S. l'inaneial institutions and their influences. and will continuo to strive to ens.ure smooth settlement of funds and maintain stability in l'inancial markets through measures such as appropri­ate morwy market opera­tions," central bank Gov. Masaaki Shirakawa said. 
The dollar also got hit, falling to I04.43 yen early Tuesday artornoon in Asia from mid-1 07 yen levels before ttw wenkend. 
In Tokyo, the Japanese unit of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. rnquested bankruptcy protection at a Tokyo court after the 158-year-old firm filed for Chapter 11 bank­ruptcy in New York on Monday. 
The storied New York investment bank, crippled by $60 billion in soured real­estate holdings, was unable to lind an investment partner to throw it a lifeline despite a ll urry of last-minute nego­tiations over the weekend. 
Investors were further shaken by the equally stun­ning news that Merrill Lynch, one of the world's most famous brokerages, sought to avoid a similar fate with a $50 billion transaction to become part of Bank of America Corp. 
The crisis appeared to be far from over. American Insurance Group, the world's largest insurer, was fighting for its survival after down­grades from major credit rating firms. adding pressure to AIG as it seeks billions of dollars to strengthen its bal­ance sheet. 
Seiehi Miura, strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in Tokyo, said already weak investor sentiment' has been badly shaken by Lehman. lle predicted extremely volatile markets ahead. 
"Th1~ market just hasn't been able to shake off an overall downward trend," he said. 
On Wall Street Monday, the Dow Jones industrial aver­age fell more than 500 points, or 4.4 percent, to 10,917.51 -its worst point drop since after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. 
European markets also sank Monday, with Britain's FTSE-1 00 share index falling 
3.9 percent and France's CAC-40 down 3. 7 percent. 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange halted securities and deriva­tives trading by Lehman Brothers a day after Japan's finaneial watchdog ordered 
its local unit to suspend operations. 
South Korea's financial 
regulator also said it had 
suspended some operations 
of two local units of Lehman 
Brothers. 
Share prices in Tokyo fell across the board, with bank­ing issues taking a particu­larly hard hit in the wake of Lehman's collapse. Investors unloaded shares in major Japanese banks listed as some of the biggest lenders, including Aozora Bank, Mizuho Financial Group and Shinsei Bank. 
Aozora, a midsize Tokyo­based bank, lost more than 19 percent, even as the com­pany in a statement sought to reassure markets that its net exposure could be reduced to less than $25 mil­lion compared with the wide­ly reported figure of $463 million. 
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., with a $289 million loan to Lehman, fell more than 10 percent. Shinsei was down almost 16 percent. 
Australia's banks, includ­ing ComJ.IIOnwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank Ltd., were all hit hard. 
In Seoul, South Korean banks extended losses. Top lender Kookmin Bank shares declined 8 percent while Hana Financial Group shares fell 10 percent. 
In Hong Kong, major bank IISBC lost 4.4 percent, and leading mainland Chinese lender ICBC plummeted 7. 7 percent. 
Hong Kong government officials said they were keep­ing a close eye on the mar­kets. 
"We know Hong Kong has a good monitoring system in place. I believe all monitor­ing agencies will make sure trading is conducted smooth­ly today," said Chan Ka­keung, secretary for i'inan­cial services and treasury. 



Race for Israeli 
P.M. spot ongoing 
Olmert's replacement as top Kadima party leader to be chosen in Wednesday elections 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -A popular for­eign minister hoping to become Israel's first female leader in more than three decades squares off against a tough­talking military man Wednesday when the ruling party picks a new chief to replace Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
The Kadima Party called the election as Olmert is being forced from ofiice by a corrup­tion scandal. 
Whoever is chosen as party leader has a good chance of becoming the next prime minis­ter, charged with dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions, over­seeing peace talks and shaping relations with Israel's most important ally, the United States. 
The race pits Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni -a rising political star hoping to become the sec­ond female prime minister in Israel's history after Golda Meir -against Shaul Mofaz, a for­mer military chief and defense minister who says he is the per­fect choice to lead this security­obsessed country. 
The differences are as much about substance as style. 
As Israel's lead negotiator in peace talks with the Palestinians, Livni, a lawyer and former agent in the Mossad spy agency, is eager to continue the low-decibel diplomatic efforts. She says she hopes diplomatic efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program prevail, though she says all options are on the table. And she has forged a warm \YOrking rela­tionship with Secretary of State Condoleezza Hice. 
"In the political arena, the lower the profile you maintain, the less you are perceived as a threat," Livni said in a recent interview with Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot. "It is accepted as being more in the national interest, less politically motivat­ed, and therefore you are capa­ble of moving processes for­ward." 
Mofaz takes a much tougher line in negotiations, demanding the Palestinians fulfill a series of conditions before final peace talks can take place. Ile also is more willing to order military action in times of crisis. 
"The Arab states know that when I am prime minister, my determination, my tenacity, my assertiveness in the face of threats will be very significant," Mofaz told Yediot. "Along with that, I will be able to achieve peace with them and also begin a dialogue of give and take. For this you need strong leadership that is able to make decisions and that has decisions in the past. I was there. lied soldiers." 
In June, Mofaz roiled world oil markets when he reportedly said Israel would have "no choice" but to attack Iran if diplomatic efforts to end Tehran's nuclear program fail. During the current campaign, he has said Israel should resume its practice of assassi­nating Barnas leaders in the Gaza Strip. 
"The choice between Mofaz and Tzipi Livni is for the Israeli public really a choice between opting from the use of military force in dealing with the con­flict, as against the use of diplo­macy," said Varon Ezrahi, a political scientist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 



Pope: Accept death 'at the hour chosen by God' 
Benedict XVI speaks to disabled, sick and dying at visit to Lourdes 
Associated Press 
LOUIWES. France -People must acenpt dnath at "tho hour chosen by God," Pope Benedict XVI told ailing pilgrims Monday in an anti-euthanasia message at Lourdes, the shrine that draws the desperate, sick and dying. 
At the chilly open-air service outside the sanctuary reputed for its curative spring water, some faithful lay on gurneys, tucked into quilts and com­forters. i\ fow brHatlwd with oxygen tanks. The 81-ynar-old pontiff administered the sacra­ment of tho siek to 10 pnople, most in wheelchairs, gently anointing tlwir foreheads and palms with oil. 
While sovcral European eountri1~s pnrmit euthanasia, the Vatican vehemently main­tains that life must continue to its natural nnd. The pope said in his homily that the ill should pray to find "tho gracn to accept, without fear or hitter­ness, to leaw this world at the hour chosen by God." 
Tho Mass closed thn pope's four-day trip to Franen, his Iirst to tho country since b1~coming pontiff' in 2005. Benedict used the trip to lay out the church's opposition to rampant materi­alism in modern life and recog­nition of divorced Catholics' new marriages. 
The pontiff also urged more room for religion in society, a topic that renewed long-sim­mering debate in France about its historic separation of church and state -so staunch that schoolchildren cannot wear Muslim head scarves or large crosses around their necks in public schools. 
In a traditionally Roman Catholic country with a dwin­dling churchgoing population and a growing Muslim commu­nity, conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy has argued that dialogue with religious groups should play a greater role in national decisions and debate -a subject on which he and Benedict found common ground. 
Julien Dray, the spokesman of the opposition Socialists, complained that the stances that Benediet repeated in Lourdes wen~ "fundamentalist" and "closed to the evolutions taking place in the church." During the visit, he said, Sarkozy "did not put enough 

distance between religious 
practir;,e  and  the  public  
sphere.  
Francois Bayrou, a  centrist  

politician, has said he had reservations about Sarkozy inviting the pope to the presi­dential Elysee Palace because it is a symbol of the French Hepublic. Bayrou is a Catholic who showed up for Sunday Mass at Lourdes. 
Despite the political debate that erupted during the trip, the main purpose of Benedict's visit was to mark the 150th anniversary of visions of the Virgin Mary to a Lourdes peas­ant girl, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous, who was later named a saint. · 
The shrine in the foothills of the French Pyrenees draws 6 million pilgrims a year, many of whom believe that Lourdes' spring water has the power to heal and even work miraeles. 
Maryse Bargain, a 48-year­old woman from the Brittany region of northwest France, was among those praying for healing. She expressed hope that the pope, "someone else or the Virgin" might help cure the blindness she has suffered from since birth.

Palin unlikely to cooperate 
McCain spokesman says Palin won't speak with investigators 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska ­Gov. Sarah Palin is unlikely to speak with an independent counsel hired by Alaska law­makers to review the firing of her public safety commission­er. a spokesman for Republican presidential can­didate John McCain said Monday. 
Spokesman Ed Q'Callaghan said he has not spoken with Palin, but she was "unlikely to cooperate" with the inquiry "as long as it remains tainted." 
Democrats charged that the McCain campaign· was trying to stall the investigation. 
"The partisan presidential campaign of McCain/Palin has interfered and is picking partisan targets to smear in order to make this investiga­tion look like something it isn't," said Patti Higgins, chairwoman of the Alaska Democratic Party. "Rather than cooperating with the investigation, the Republican presidential campaign is doing everything it can to stall and smear." 
O'Callaghan also said he did not know whether Palin's husband, Todd, would chal­lenge a subpoena issued Friday to compel his coopera­tion. Thomas Van Flein, the Palins' lawyer. who has accepted service of the sub­poena, did not return mes­sages seeking comment. The governor herself has not been subpoenaed, but the Legislature's investigator, Steve Branchflower, has said he hopes to speak with her about the firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan. 
Palin and her husband campaigned Monday in Colorado and Ohio. Palin also planned appearances Tuesday in Ohio. 
Palin initially said she wel­comed the inquiry. But after she became McCain's running mate on Aug. 29 her lawyer sought to have the three­member state Personnel Board take over the investi-

gation, alleging that public statements by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Democratic state Sen. Hollis French, indicated the probe was politically motivated. 
French said Sept. 2 that the results of the investigation could constitute an "October surprise" for the McCain campaign. He later apolo­gized for the remark, but Palin's lawyer has said the biased impression it created can't be undone. 
The McCain campaign says it can prove Monegan was fired in July because of insubordination on budget issues, and not because he refused to fire a state trooper who went through a nasty divorce from Palin's sister. 
Monegan said Monday that Palin never complained to him about his performance. 
"In my time as a commis­sioner, the governor has never talked to me about complaints about my efforts," Monegan said. 
To that end, the campaign released a series of e-mails detailing the frustration sev­eral Palin administration offi­ci~ls experienced in dealing with Monegan. The "last straw," the campaign said, 
was a trip Monegan planned 
to Washington in July to seek 
federal money for investigat­
ing and prosecuting sexual 
assault cases. 
In a July 7 e-mail, John 
Katz, the governor's special 
counsel, noted two problems 
with the trip: the governor 
hadn't agreed the money 
should be sought, and the 
request "is out of sequence 
with our other appropriations 
requests and could put a 
strain on the evolving rela­
tionship between the .Governor and Sen. Stevens." Monegan was fired four days later. 
In the weeks since, it has 
emerged that the Palins and 
her staff repeatedly had con­
tacted Monegan expressing 
their dismay at the continued 
employment of Trooper Mike 
Wooten, who divorced Palin's 
sister in 2005. The following 
year, Wooten was suspended 
for five days based on com­
plaints filed by the Palins, 
including that he drank in his 
patrol car, used a Taser on 
his 10-year-old stepson and 'illegally shot a moose:  
A bipartisan panel of the 
Legislature voted unanimous­
ly to authorize an investiga­
tion into the circumstances of 
Monegan's firing. 


Cere111ony planned for new Minn. bridge 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -State troopers will lead a slow, somber procession of motorists across the Mississippi River early Thursday to _mark the open­ing of the new bridge replac­ing one that collapsed and killed 13 people last year. 
With the hum of construc­tion equipment behind them, government officials gath­ered Monday to announce the opening and unveil the design of a permanent memorial to the dead and 145 injured. 
"Getting this bridge built and getting it built quickly will help heal a wound, but it will never heal the pain from last August," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters. "These lanes will forever be sacred because ofthe 13 people who lost their lives here." 
The new concrete span for Interstate 35W includes high­tech sensors and backup fea­tures lacking in the 40-year­old steel truss bridge it replaces. The $234 million bridge was fast-tracked to restore the major Minneapolis artery, a traffic route that accounted for 140,000 trips a day. 
"Out of mind-numbing tragedy has come an engi­neering marvel," said Rep. Jim Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat and head of the House Transportation Committee. "Out of the rub­ble of the failing of a bridge has come a lesson for the future of bridge engineering and construction." 
The builders are in line for a bonus of up to $27 million for completing the project more than three months early. Minnesota Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel said the contractor must complete some minor work before the award size is determined. 
The new bridge was com­pleted 11 months after work began and about 13 months after the collapse. In con­trast, work on the original bridge began in 1964 and 
wasn't finished until1967. 
When the new span opens at 5 a.m. Thursday, the troopers will line up across the lanes at each end, allow­ing traffic to line up behind them. Once construction bar­ricades are removed, the troopers will slowly drive across the bridge, allowing commuters to follow them. 
Gov. Tim Pawlenty said the arrangement is meant more for safety than ceremony. 
"We're not going to have a race or a rush for people to be the first to drive across the bridge," he said. 
Andy Gannon, whose car plunged 42 feet when the old I-35W bridge fell into the river, said he wants to be among the first to cross. He recently found the crumpled directions from his trip that tragic day -a route that was to take him to a wake for 
a  friend's father.  He will fol­ 
low  those  directions  
Thursday.  

"For me, I have to complete where I was going," he said. 
The memorial to the col­lapse will be in a nearby park. A fountain will be sur­rounded by 13 steel I-beams, each engraved with the name of one of the dead. Mayor 
R.T. Rybak said a $1 million fundraising campaign will finance the construction and upkeep of the memorial. 
The National Transportation Safety Board plans to discuss its findings on what caused the bridge collapse at a public hearing in Washington in November. 
In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said a design error was "the critical fac­tor" in the collapse, pointing to too-thin gusset plates that helped connect the bridge's steel beams. 
The NTSB has also focused on the weight of construction materials that were on the bridge for a resurfacing proj­ect. 
Gannon said he has full confidence in the new bridge's safety. 
"There will be a lot of eyes on this bridge," he said. "For something to go wrong, I just don't see it." 
Ike blamed for Midwest deaths, blackout 

Hurricane remnants leave millions without power over weekend 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI-Midwest resi­dents cleared debris from their yards Monday as crews worked to restore electricity to millions of customers left without power by a weekend of violent storms caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ike. 
The storms. the latest in a bru­tal summer that has slammed parts of the region with severe flooding, brought Ike's total death toll to at least 39 in 10 states from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. 
As Ike faded and headed off toward the northeast, combining with a weather system that arrived from the west, it dumped as much as 6 to 8 inches of rain on parts of Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. It spawned a tornado in Arkansas that damaged several buildin_,gs, and delivered hurri­cane-force wind to Ohio, tern­porarily shutting down Cincinnati's main airport during the weekend. 
Flooding was expected this week in several towns in Missouri, which experienced widespread flooding in MarciL High water on the Mississippi River was expected to close a riverfront street later this week in front of St. Louis' famed Gateway Arch. 
In Arnold, Mo., sandbag walls erected to protect several homes from the March flooding were never taken down, and should withstand a new round, City Manager Matthew Unrein said. 
"The old-timers knew it was wise to leave the sandbags," he said. 
The Missouri River is likely to reach more'than 11 feet above flood stage in Missouri's St. Charles County, threatening seven private levees, officials said. 
About 40 Indiana National Guard troops were activated Sunday to assist with the evacua­tion of about 5,000 residents from flooded parts of Munster, a town along the Illinois border. 
"We've never had flooding like this," town manager Tom DeGiulio said. 
Evacuees who spent the night in a shelter at a Munster school said Monday that the water rose quickly. 
"The water was nothing but a trickle in the middle of the street and by the time we decided what to do it was too late," said George Polv_ich, who was rescued by boat. "There was, like, three feet of water." 
About 2 million homes and businesses across Ohio, and thou­sands more in Indiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York were without power Monday.

The fine print 
Sinee 1982, Kennesaw, an Atlanta suburb, has required every head of a household to own a gun and ammuni­tion, with an exemption for those who conscientiously object. One effeet of the enactment was the appearanee of yard signs: "Never Mind the Dog-Beware of Owner." Another was that the. Kennesaw crime rate dropped and remains well below the nation­al average. 
What brings Kennesaw to mind is Distriet of Columbia v. Heller, decided last June, the Supreme Court's first in· depth examination of the Second Amendment. That amendment pro­vides: "A well-regulated Militia, being neeessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." The Court held, SA, that the District of Columbia's "ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firf'.arm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense." The Heller ruling was hailed by many as a decisive victory for "gun rights." First impres­sions, however, can be misleading. 
One lesson here is that saying too much can get you into trouble. The Second Amendment is the only one in the Bill of Rights with a prefatory clause stating its purpose. That "mili­tia" elause, over the years, gave rise to endless debate, which the Court settled in Heller. In the majority opinion, writ­ten by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the amendment "protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." The dissenters argued that the Amendment protects only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia serv­ice. The ruling, however, did not settle much beyond that point. 


"[T]he Second Amendment," said the Court, "codified a pre-existing right" which developed in England as a pro­tection against government. "[Tihe Stuart Kings Charles II and James II," said Scalia, suppressed political dissent "in part by disarming their opponents. .... [Tihe Catholic James II had ordered... disarmaments of [Protestant] regions." The English Bill of Rights of 1689, the predecessor of the Second Amendment, reacted by providing "That the subjects whieh are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law." This was, said the Court, "clearly an individual right, hav­ing nothing whatever to do with service in a militia." 
When the Second Amendment was adopted, the "militia," said the Court, consisted of "those who were male, able·bodied, and within a certain age range." The Amendment, wrote Scalia, "helped to secure the ideal of a citizen militia, which might be neeessary to oppose an oppressive military force if the constitutional order broke down ... [T]he ... prefatory clause announces the purpose for which the right was codi­fied: to prevent elimination of the mili­tia. [It] does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self·defense and hunting. But the threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens' militia by taking away their arms was the reason that right·unlike some other English rights-was codified in a written Constitution." 
The law struck down in Heller totally forbade handgun possession in the home. It also required that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled, or disabled by a trigger loek, at all times. But the ruling left the door open for restrictive regulation rather than prohibition. Th.e Court said the Second Amendment "does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purpos­es, such as short-barreled shotguns." The Court also noted approvingly the "longstanding prohibitions on the pos· session of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the ear· rying of lirearms in sensitive places such as schools and government build­ings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." 
The gun issue is far from settled. The District of Columbia reactod to Heller by imposing a regulation practically as restrictive as the one the Court struek down. A new appoal is underway. The Supreme Court has held that most of (he protections in the Bill of Rights are binding on the states and local govern­ments as well as on the federal govern­ment. But in I teller the Court interpret­ed earlier cases to establish that "the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government." Future litigation may turn on provisions in state consti­tutions eomparable to that amendment. Justice Breyer's dissent in Heller high­lighted also the uncertainty that still surrounds the level of judicial scrutiny that must be applied in Second Amendment cases. 
So what can we learn from Heller? It is far from a mandate that every American community become a Dodge City or even a Kennesaw. On Supreme Court decisions, and everything else, don't jump to conclusions without read­ing the fine print.

Before entering the stadi­off campus um, every spectator should be breathalyzed; after all Sept. 15 
Glory of tradition still alive 

I must say that after reading Gus Zuehlke's article ("Bad game day behavior disgraces football tradi­tion," Sept. 15), I am a little confused about which university he attended back in the late 1970's that was such a virtuous utopia compared to the University of Notre Dame and its students today. No, I wasn't alive when Mr. Zuehlke attended the university, but my father graduated in '75, and the parents of my friends were in attendance at the same time as Zuehlke -so I've heard the stories. 
Zuehlke comments on the "degeneration of what was once a festival we could celebrate without endan­gering our souls". He implores that the student body to "drink but not get drunk," and yet, while he attended the University, kegs made their way into the Stadium via ropes pulled along the outer walls. I am sure that the virtuous student body, which he implies attended the University at the time, was not drinking to get drunk. After all, people who do not want to get drunk usually cannot wait until after a game to resume drinking. I am afraid I cannot comment on how lewd people were at games; I'll be honest -I have no idea. But combing through the yearbooks of the late 1970's for a project I recently worked on, I came across the following photographs in tho~e yearbooks: 1. A snow "sculpture" created on ·campus in the shape of a middle finger aimed at the golden dome. 2. A sign at a local movie theater showing the movie title "Deep Throat XXX". (On a side note, it is a funny picture since there is a trash can in front of the theater bearing the sign "Keep it Clean.") There were other photos as well, but I'll leave them to your imagination. 
Do these images portray a student body devoid of lewdness? Now I hope you won't get the picture that I am berating the student body during the late 1970's. Actually, I applaud them for having what seems to be a fun-loving attitude while remaining serious enough in their studies to prepare themselves to make a difference in the world. Nor am I condoning the behavior of those current students who "cross the line." Just don't claim that today's students are "prostituting" the Notre Dame Football tradition because a few students act out. Today's student body embodies the same Notre Dame spirit which has characterized previous student bodies at this university over the past 166 years-the same Notre Dame spirit which impressed ESPN magazine enough to name us the No. 1 "Most Spirited Student Body" in college football in an August 2008 issue. When it comes down to it, Mr. Zuehlke, the student body hasn't changed-only your perception has. 
Kevin J. Gleason alumnus Class of 2008 Sept. 15 

Revelry, not vulgarity 
"Therefore let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or Sabbath days," Colossians 2:16. I write this piece in reference to the Viewpoint article published in The Observer on Sept. 15, titled "Bad Game Day Behavior a Disgrace to Football Tradition." While I do respect your opinion, I disagree with various critiques you made in regards to my actions and my character. 
First, in defense of a few well respected ladies with whom I associate: these ladies were simply enjoying the com­mencement of the 2008 Notre Dame Football season. While they may have been dressed in slightly less clothing than average females, it would have been unfortunate if they stained their clothing with blue, green, or gold paint. It is a college football tradition to apply paint of a school's colors on game day and should be no different at an institution like Notre Dame. 
In addition, I am personally offended at the comment regarding the writing on my back. It seems wrong to single out one student for advertising the words roughly para­phrased as "Suck This," when our entire student body can be heard chanting "Suck it (Insert team name)" on any given home football weekend. I feel that ifyou choose to criticize me for my body art, you must also criticize the thousands of fans participating in this popular chant. While you state that alumni greeted me with a nervous reaction, I bring to light the plethora of guests of our beautiful campus who requested pictures of me with themselves or their chil­dren, as well as those greeting me with friendly smiles and high-fives. 
You also referenced my use of the phrase "Get it up," which a number of my fellow students have brought to my attention has certain vile connotations. In no way was this phrase used as a sexual reference or anything of the sort. The phrase is a common request of fans to raise their voic­es and emotions (and nothing else) for the team that they support. Any other interpretation of what I meant by this statement is both far-fetched and incorrect. To me, Notre Dame football transcends ordinary, earthly festivals. and I would like to enjoy each of these blessed days to the fullest extent. 
While I do apologize for "endangering others' souls," as you contend, I believe myself and those around me were simply enjoying ourselves while getting excited for a prom­ising season of Fighting Irish Football. Rather than intrud­ing on others' weekends, I believe I was simply motivating others around me to cheer as loud as possible on opening day for our beloved Irish. 
Respectfully,

No, it's not because I'm being stalked by paparazzi lurking in the shrubberins outside my dorm. Nor do I suddonly have the desire to start adopting children from as-yet­unnamed devnloping nations. Or to givn those c:hildrrm names like "Pilot Inspnktor." (Heally . .Jason Lee from "My Nanw is 1\arl'!" Heally?) 
No, I'm feeling slightly -to sort of quote one or my favorite "Project Hunway" mntestants, Blayne Walsh -"eeleb-u-lieious" beeause of the swent celebrity swag that I've bnen getting since I took this Sc:ene Editor gig last month. 
Swag, for those of you who arnn't addic:ted to watching awards shows on telnvision. is commonly defined as "sweet stuff." Lots and lots of swnnt stuff. in raet, is often tucked into eutn littlfl baskets for presen­tnrs at banquets and award cflre­monins in thn llollyood hills. You might notice that I'm not handing anyone a Best Supporting Actor Osc:ar. so what gives? 
To the studios/networks/record labels, it's marketing. In a recent letter I rnefdved from none other than the Fox Network, .1 ..1. Abrams personally drafted this greeting: "Dear funny. intnlligent, attractive collngn journalist." I was sold imme­diately. 
(lley-his name's on the letter, so lw obviously wrott~ the text. Okay, it was stamped on thn lettnr. And that letter was most likely printed by an intern. I>Plails, dc~tails.) 
The point, though, is that the folks at Fox want me. 1\ditor or Scene, to plug their nnw lineup of shows. In particular. thny'vn been sending me box after box of w~ar for their nnw sei-fi. J . .I. Abrams-produced series, "Fringe." 
Admittedly, I hadn't given the show mueh thought prior to the onslaught of publicity materials. I havn a high tolcranee for science fiction, but a low tolerance for Fox.

Like at least one other J.J. Abrams television program, this one's pilot episode begins in a plane -a plane in a storm -a plane in a storm with lots screaming passengers. This other show, of course, is the spectacularly popular and con­sistently disappointing "Lost." 
The plot for "Fringe'' starts with a mysterious disease that has killed every single passen­ger on a transatlantic flight. The FBI and the CIA are sent to clear up the mess. · · 
Through this we are intro­duced to the main character, Olivia Dunham, portrayed by relative newcomer to American television, Anna Torv. Though she has mostly worked outside of America, she landed a lead role in the biggest show of Fox's fall lineup. So there must be something about Anna Torv that 
J .J. Abrams liked. 

Some fans ml'l.y remember other Abrams female leads such as Kerri Russell in "Felicity" and Jennifer Gather in a fairly popular show titled "Alias." Another welcome addition to this cast is "Dawson's Creek" alum Joshua Jackson, and the mad Steward of Gondor, John Noble, from "The Heturn of the King." The three work well together and will most likely be what keeps the show afloat for the weaker portions of the first season. 
The first few minutes of the show were thfl most disappoint­ing. The characters seem almost unaffected by the bizarre occurrences surround· ing them and are more interest~ ed in exploring a love connec­tion, a weak story line that for some reason was deemed nee~ essary in this premier episode. 
Cliche upon cliche include mad geniuses, and their sarcas­tic, bitter, troubled. yet charm­ing and lovable sons. Theri we finally get into what the show 
intends to concentrate on, 
fringe science. That is the study 
of mind control, the existence of 
UFO's, human resurrection, and 
various other strange events 
are planned to form the back­
bone of. the series. It also 
appears that an overarching 
story featuring an evil corpora­
tion will take precedence every 
few episodes. 
Most of the series action will 
take place in Boston~ though 
the pilot episode also traveled '.··..· 
to Iraq and the depths of the II)::~· 
human dream state. · ·" 
With ominous floating letters at every location, J.J. Abrams .once again proclaimed his fas­
cination With CGI block text. 
The savior of this premier epif?ode was both the series potential; and the humor which was very welcome and thor­oughly enjoyable. 
The quick·witted characters always had a wise crack about the strange events they· were experiencing. The casting choices, albeit very traditional. seemed compelling and worth taking a risk on. The massive cast of "Lost" successfully developed chemistry and "Fringe" should he no different. 
Though delightfully creepy, and filled to the brink with fan­tastic potential, the inconsistent acting, sloppy fake beards, and oddly chosen effects might take away from the shows potential success and longevity. J .J. Abrams knows how to create a hit show and "Fringe" no doubt will be a new series to watch. 
Despite a weak $10,000,000 pilot, the show should return with a strong second episode. Fox has not been known for giv­ing its shows a second chance, but through word of mouth and hopefully minor improvements, "Fringe" could be the "X-Files" for a new generation of those seeking the weird and the fan­tastical.

Has any band in recent memory put out as much quality music in as little a time as the Gaslight Anthem? 
In the last 16 months, they've pro­duced two full-length albums and an EP, with not one bad song to be found in their catalogue. While the online hype is starting to build around the group, they remain completely unknown to the mainstream. This is an utter shame. Their spectacular sophomore album, entitled "The '59 Sound," is a debut for new label SideOneDummy (also home to the ever-popular Celtic-punks Flogging Molly). 
Their fusion of the classic rock of yes­teryear with the modern punk of today is what makes the album so successful. Check the lyrical references to Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Tom Waits and Thin Lizzy. Listen to the obvious Springsteen influence in front man Brian Fallon's vocals (album closer "The Backstreets" could literally be a Springsteen cover, it's that similar). The album is so much more than worship of late-70s radio though. The streamlined drive to the music adds a punch that accents the group's punk rock roots. The songs rarely eclipse the four-minute mark, avoiding the possible pitfalls of long, elaborate mini-rock operas that so often bog down albums. No, "The '59 Sound"

Listening to Weezer's newest album is like reconnecting with an old childhood friend. You may have forgotten how much you liked them, or thought they (or you) had changed too much for things to ever be the same. But then you run into your old friend, start talking, and it's like he/she never left. 
Weezer's latest release, which is self­titled but nicknamed the Red Album, hearkens back to the good old days when Weezer was one of the best alternative rock bands around. It draws from several different eras of Weezer's past, giving the album a diverse and eclectic feel. 
Many of the songs, including the first single "Pork and Beans," feature a trade­mark Weezer power-pop sound, a la the Green Album. "Pork and Beans" could function as the album's mission statement, boldly declaring: ''I'm a do the things that I want to doll ain't got a thing to prove to you." If anything. this album is meant to transcend all expectations. Weezer proves that they're out to make music however they see fit; no matter what that critics is a modern punk album in the vein of contemporary groups like Against Me!, who have found both critical and com­mercial success. 
The album kicks off with the one-two punch of "Great Expectations" and the title track. If there were any doubts about the accessibility of the music, they should be shattered here. Catchy and immediate, they are straightfor­ward rockers with massive, radio-ready choruses. The larger production budget that comes with signing to a bigger independent label, such as SideOneDummy, gives the songs a sheen they didn't have on prior efforts. Though some fans may be quick to launch into cries of "Sell outs!" the pop­pier sound works perfectly for choruses as catchy as these. 
Though the next few songs are great (especially "Film Noir"), "Miles Davis and the Cool" stands heads and shoul­ders above the pack. Mid-tempo and laid back, it's a stupendous summer song that salutes a jazz great. The next song, "The Patient Ferris Wheel" notably features Dicky Barrett of Mighty Mighty Bosstones fame. The true stun­ner of the album, "Here's Looking at You, Kid" is a slow ballad, where Fallon recalls ex-girlfriends. Sounding utterly resigned, he describes how the relation­ships turned sour. As the song fades out to guitar, vaguely recalling Green Day's "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)", it's 

there

a!1(foverly demanding 
One of the best examples of this "in your face" attitude is the song "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived." River Cuomo, the band's front man and chief songwriter, supposedly wrote the song and then later realized that he had subconsciously pla­giarized the old Quaker hymn "Simple Gifts." Nevertheless, he puts so many dif­ferent spins on the melody over the course of the song that he truly makes it his own. The song shifts styles maniacally from hip-hop to punk to falsetto over piano to choral singing and back to power-pop, never letting you get bored. The song's unpredictability and over-the-top self-pro­motion (with a good dose of irony) makes it one of the album's best tracks, declaring that Weezer is through with messi.ng around. 
Even on the crunchy power chord fare, the band shows a slightly more hostile edge, as in the songs "Get Dangerous" and "Troublemaker." They still make good use of their nerdy, endearing sense of humor, but many of the songs also display a sort of aggressive energy that is mostly alien to Weezer. Though past hits "Buddy Holly" and "Hash Pipe" did hint at this rawer of the Gaslight Anthem is their lyri­cal continuity -the repeated men­tions of cars, girls named Mary or Maria, and dancing. This doesn't let up on "The '59 Sound", and though it's not overbearing, fans will notice and appreciate these lyrical Easter eggs. Also, astute listeners will notice references to Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, more examples of the rich songwriting talent Brian Fallon possesses. His lyrics reflect the blue-collar rock that the band plays, and it never seems contrived. 

There's been lavish praise given 
to "The '59 Sound", both in this review and elsewhere, but it deserves every word of it. It's a fantastically consistent album in terms of overall quality; from song to song there is no filler. It's unpretentious, but not imchallenging, and totally catchy. There isn't much more you can ask of a band than this. It is absolutely one of the finest, if not the finest, releases this year. Talk about avoiding the sophomore slump. The Gaslight Anthem should be proud of making such a thoroughly solid album.

of self-mockery, being the nerd rock kings that they are. 
Leaving the power-pop aside, the band also revives a slower, more heartfelt sound that has been conspicuously miss­ing since Pinkerton. "Heart Songs" is a nostalgic tribute from Rivers Cuomo to his favorite artists from childhood, including a few surprises (ABBA?). The final track on the regular version of the album, "The 
Angel and the One," starts with one low acoustic riff and repeats this theme over and over again, gradually building into a climactic and beautiful melody. 
The regular version of the album con­tains only 10 tracks, but the deluxe ver­sion, which is $3 more on iTunes, includes five more tracks. If you buy this album, definitely get the deluxe version as some of the best music on the album can be found in the bonus tracks. "Miss Sweeney" is a delightfully quirky yet moving song about a white-collar office yuppie falling in love with his secretary. It is one of the few times when Rivers Cuomo writes lyrics from another per­son's viewpoint, although he most likely identifies himself with the man in the

feature more emotional, personal moments from Cuomo, which is when his talent as a songwriter shines forth the most. 
So don't write Weezer off just yet as another 90s novelty band that will never make good music again. The Red Album gives us reason to hope.

Chiefs novv playing --. rn usical quarterbacks 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Who 
says the Kansas City Chiefs don't 
have a quarterback'? 
They have one with an injuri~d 
shoulder and one with a sore 
neck, one with low expectations 
and one with high hopes. 
The one with low expectations 
is probably headed back to 
reserve wide receiver status. 
Or is he? 
Nobody, inducting head coach llerm Edwards, seemed to know on Monday what might happen next on Kansas City's chaotic quarterback carousel. 
One thing does seem certain -Brodie Croyle, the projected season startflr, will be out a sec­ond straight week with a shoul­der injury he sustained in the opener at New England. Damon IIuard, the reliable 35-year-old backup, came in and almost engineered an upset over the Patriots. and then started on Sunday against the Oakland Haiders. 
But lluard came out in the first hall' or the 23-8 loss with what the team called "mild head trauma" and what he calls a stilT neck. Edwards said Monday he did not know whether Huard or No. 3 QB Tyler Thigpen would start at Atlanta on Sunday. 
Neither is anyone saying if Marques Hagans, a backup wide receiver and former college quarterback, will ever get back under center after taking live surprise snaps against Oakland. 
"I don't know yet," Edwards said when asked who would start against the Falcons. "We haven't deeided. We're going to make a deeision on that proba­bly Wednesday." 
lluard, the only one of the four who's ever won a game in the NFL, was lifted after throw­ing an interception. Tyler Thigpen. who had only six pass­es in the NFL on his brief resume, came in and wound up completing 14 of 33 throws for 151 yards, including a short touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez. 
Hagans, a quarterback at Virginia who's .never been any­thing but a backup wide receiv­er in the NFL, completed the only pass he threw, for 5 yards. !lis other plays resulted in one penalty and several short, inef­fective runs. 
"We haven't talked about it. 
We're going to sit down and talk 
about it today," Edwards said. 
Even Huard's injury seemed mysterious. He did not appear hurt when he came out. Then in the fourth quarter the Chiefs announced he had mild head trauma. Thigpen, who's hoping to get valuable playing time the next couple of weeks while Croyle rests his shoulder, admit­ted even he didn't know that Huard was hurt. 
"I went up to him at the end and I was like, 'Why haven't you gone back in? What's going_ on?'" he said. "He was like, 'I ended up hurting my neck,' or whatever it was." 
Thigpen and Huard both said they had no idea who might play, or for how long, this week. 
"I thought Tyler was getting a series in there. But on the side­line, my neck stiffened up on me pretty good," Huard said. "When you're in the heat of the battle you don't really think about it. But it really kind of caught up with me there on the sideline." 
Huard, who has had a concus­sion during his career, said the symptoms seemed suspicious. 
"Everybody responds to head trauma a little different. I think there may have been a little bit of that," he said. 'There were a few symptoms. But to sit here and elaborate on that, it's not going to get us anywhere." 
Hagans said he'll be ready if · called upon for quarterback duty again. 
"I think if we continue with it, it will be a good package for us," he said. "Hut if coach puts it down, then I've just got to be a third receiver and (on) special teams, and I'm all for that as well. Any time I get to play quarterback in the NFL, you've got to be excited about that."

The Hams (0-2) have lost five 
in a row by an average score of 
40-15-dating to last season and 
have yet to run a play inside the 
opponent's 20 this year. 

St. Louis Post-Dispatch colum­

Sunday's fourth-quarter collapse

changes this 
week. The list of 
potential candi­dates could include safety Corey Chavous, cornerback Tye Hill, wide receiver Dane Looker and offensive linemen Hichie Incognito and Nick Leckey. 
Winning coaches compliment their fallen foes all the time, so such plaudits should be kept in context, but Giants coach Tom Coughlin on Monday saw poten­tial in the Rams. 
"They played tough, they played hard," Coughlin said. "They were in position in the fourth quarter to win the game, so I think that they have many talented players. I realize they're 0-2 but they have a talented group." 
Those words are unlikely to soothe players' wounded pride. 
"Certainly nobody takes any satisfaction from hanging in there for three quarters with those guys," said rookie defen­sive end Chris Long, who got his first career sack. "We can't be satisfied with any facet of the game." 
Linehan was 8-8 in 2006, his 
-first season as a ll,ead coach at any level. But the Hams are in the midst of a sorry 3-15 skid dating to last season, and echoes of their 0-8 start last year are lingering with an increasingly hostile fan base. Thus far the addition of offen­sive coordinator AI Saunders is an early-season flop -they scored their only touchdown of the season on a fluke play against the Giants. The offense is 3-for-26 on third-down conversions,-quar­terback Marc Bulger has been sacked 10 times and Steven Jackson is still rounding into form after a 27-day contract h9ldout. Bulger limped away after Jackson bumped knees with him on one handoff, and Jackson tripped on the turf on what could have been a 66-yard touchdown run. "I think it's a fragile group and we've got to stay the course," Saunders said. ''I'm disappointed, certainly. I'm not discouraged about these guys, because I know what we can do down the road." The defense has been every bit as shaky, surrendering 963 total yards. The Giants had six gains of 28 yards or more while foiling the Hams' pregame strat­egy of controlling the run and stopping Plaxico Burress. "I think there are some indi­viduals lacking confidence," defensive coordinator Jim Haslett said. "They just need to go out and play."

Brevvers fire Yost in effort to save season 

Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE In an unprecedented move, the Milwaukee Brewers fired man­ager Ned Yost on Monday, hop­ing to pull out of another late­season slump that has jeop­ardized the team's chance of making the playoffs for the first time since 1982. 
Third-base coach Dale Sveum will take over as inter­im manager for the remainder of the season. The Brewers have lost seven of eight and fallen into a tie with Philadelphia for the NL wild­card lead. 
It marked the first time in major league history -except the strike-split 1981 season ­that a manager was fired in August or later with his team in playoff position, the Elias Sports Bureau said. 
At 83-67, the Brewers have just 12 games to rebound. 
Milwaukee came into this month with a 5?-game lead in the wild card, but since has

the Central­leading Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on Tuesday. 
"This was a very difficult move to make, and we appre­ciate all of the work that Ned has done to develop this team into a contender," general manager Doug Melvin said in a statement. "In the end, this was a collaborative decision made to put our club in the best position for the final two weeks of the season." 
The team scheduled a news conference Monday night in Chicago. Yost did not immedi­ately return a message left on his · cell phone by The Associated Press. 
Members of NL Central rivals Chicago and Houston, who played another neutral-site game in Milwaukee on Monday after Hurricane Ike made it too difficult to play their scheduled series in Houston over the weekend. expressed surprise at the move. 
"That was a shocker." Astros owner Drayton McLane said. "Has a team ever done that at this point of the season this close to the playoffs?" 
During tlie rejiggered 1981 season, the Montreal Expos fired future Hall of Fame man­ager Dick Williams in early September. The Expos went 16-11 under Jim Fanning to win the second-half title and make the playoffs. 
In 1983, Philadelphia fired Pat Corrales in early July when it was in first place with a 43-42 record. Under Paul Owens, the Phillies reached the World Series. 
In 1982, the Brewers fired manager Buck Rodgers after a 23-24 start. Popular Harvey Kuenn took over and his "Harvey's Wallbangers" went to the World Series. 
"It was a big surprise to me," said Astros infielder Mark Loretta, formerly of the Brewers. "It makes you won­der who really made that deci­sion." 
Cubs manager Lou Piniella said Yost was a "good man." 
"I don't know the situation here with the Brewers, but I've got a lot of respect for Ned and it's not easy when you get fired," Piniella said. "But I hope everything goes well for him. He's a good baseball man and he'll be back." 
Bench coach Ted Simmons, once considered a potential successor should Yost be fired, has been reassigned to an "advisory role," making his long-term status with the team unclear. 
By shaking up its on-field leadership, Milwaukee is hop­ing to avoid a repeat of last year's collapse. In 2007, the Brewers held an 8?-game divi­sion lead in late June but slid to 83-79 and missed the play­
offs. 
The Brewers 
acquisition cer­
tainly has worked out, as the reigning AL Cy Young winner is 9-0 in 13 starts with six complete games and a 1.59 ERA. 
But little else -not the other .starters, the shaky bullpen or a home run-happy offense that has gone colder than a Wisconsin winter -is working for Milwaukee these days. 
Now Yost has paid the price. 
Yost became a lightning rod for fan criticism in Milwaukee in recent years as he stub­bornly stuck by players mired in slumps and refused to criti­cize them in public -even when they get in shoving matches in the dugout during games. 
And the Brewers haven't looked like contenders in some of their biggest series this sea­son, including a three-game sweep by Boston in May, a four-game sweep by Chicago at home in July and the just-com­pleted four-game sweep by Philadelphia. 
Yost was in his sixth season as the Brewers' manager. When Milwaukee hired him from Atlanta after the 2002 season, the team was in the midst of four straight seasons with 94 losses or more. 
Under Yost, the young Brewers improved to records of 81-81, 75-87 and 83-79 in the past three seasons-a sig­nificant improvement for a franchise that hadn't had a winning record since 1992. But Yost seemingly couldn't get the Brewers to take the next step. 
Yost spent 12 years on the Braves' coaching staff with Bobby Cox, and Atlanta won division titles every year Yost was there except the strike­shortened 1994 season.

MLB 
Posada says Joba should return to bullpen 
During 'Centerstage' session, Yankees catcher says Chamberlain will reinjure himself if he throws 200 innings 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Jorge Posada reignited the debate over Joba Chamberlain's future Monday, recommending the young pitcher be kept in the bullpen and predicting more injuries if the New York Yankees put him back in their starting rotation. 
"I think if you start him and he pitches 200 innings in one year, )"ou're going to lose him. He's going to get hurt. I don't see him a!i a starter," Posada said Monday during a session of "CenterStage," scheduled to air on the team's YES Network starting Sept. 28. 
Chamberlain, the hard­throwing righty who turns 23 next week, began the season in the Yankees bullpen, then moved to the rotation in June. The plan was to limit his innings early, then make him a full-time starter. 
"He's been around the game and that's his opinion. I'm not going to fault the guy for hav­ing an opinion. We all have opinions," Chamberlain said. "We have to sit down. It's going to be what's best for the team in the long run. It's your career and you have to be a part of it. You do what's best for yourself, also, but the end goal is to win a championship. Whether that's in the bullpen or as a starter, time will tell." 
He was sidelined from Aug. 4 to Sept. 2 because of rotator cuff tendinitis and went back to the bullpen when he returned. 
"A little tendinitis, it just tells you a lot," Posada said after the TV interview. "I think his body is made up for a reliever." 
Chamberlain was 3-1 with a 
2.76 ERA in 12 starts, striking out 74 in 65 1-3 innings. He's 1-2 with a 2.29 ERA in 24 relief appearances, fanning 34 in 28 2-3 innings. 
New York hasn't decided its future plans for Chamberlain. 
"We'll discuss whether Chamberlain will be a starter or a reliever, along with every­thing else, during the winter," co-chairman Hank Steinbrenner said. 
Manager Joe Girardi didn't mind Posada voicing his opin­ion, saying "some players feel more freely to discuss them openly than others." He also said the decision could depend on offseason developments. 
"For right now, we still envi­sion him as a starter. We just didn't have a chance to build him up," Girardi said. 
He did reject the notion that starting makes Chamberlain more susceptible to injury. 
"You can't put your head inside a guy's arm," he said. "People will argue it's better to start every five days from a physical standpoint, where you get four days' rest. Other peo­ple say it's better to throw in the bullpen, but what if you have to throw three days in a row? I mean, I think it just depends on the individual." 
Chamberlain would like the debate to end at some point. 

"At the beginning of the year, we're just going to have to say, this is it," he said. "Then I never want to answer another question about it again." 
Posada had season-ending shoulder surgery June 30 and expects to return behind the plate for New York next sea­son, anticipating he can catch 120-130 games. 
With the Yankees almost cer­tain to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the 37­year-old says the team must go into the free-agent market to repair its starting rotation. CC Sabathia, Ben Sheets and A.J. Burnett are their chief targets. 

"We're pretty much going to be in it, but you don't know if those guys are going to want to come here," Posada said. "I hope they do." 
New York figures to have tens of millions of dollars avail­able: Jason Giambi ($21 mil­lion). Andy Pettitte ($16 mil­lion), Bobby Abreu ($16 mil­lion), Mike Mussina ($11 mil­lion) and Carl Pavano ($11 mil­lion) are all potentially eligible

The play also is likely to be reviewed in the offseason by the league's competition com­mittee, which normally reViews all controversial plays. 
"It's going to require a great deal of discussion," said Titans coach Jeff Fisher, the cochairman of the competi­tion committee. "It's hap­pened at times. It happened in a game against us at Indianapolis years ago .... When the whistle blows and the pass is ruled incomplete, there's just no way currently that you can award posses­sion."

no nxplanation, her toe began to move. After six weeks in the hos­pital re-learning how to walk, Scott DeMaria returned to school. 
Years later, she learned of a possible reason for her recovery. After the bus flipped, Scott DeMaria crawlep out onto the ground and spent over an hour with her back in direct contaet with the snow, so much so that hnr body temperature dropped to 94 degrees. 
"We always traveled very well­dressed. None of us had jackets on. It was freezing," she said. 
The snow may have controlled the swelling around the spine, allowing the surgery performed that night to save the integrity of hnr spinal chord. Years later, a similar, medieally-induced trnat­ment would be used on Hu!Talo Hills' tight end Kevin Everett, who suffernd a broken spine in a collision in the first week of the 2007 season. Hypothermic saline is injectPd into the body to keep swelling in cheek, but the treat­ment is somewhat controversial because an overdose can shut down organs. 
"My good friend who's an M.D. said, 'It's nice to have God doing the dosing,"' Scott DeMaria said. 
Seott DeMaria didn't learn what happennd to Beeler and llopp until a day after her sur­gery. Besides shock, she said, her initial reaction was one of rnsolvn. She told herself she would recover and swim for thnrn. 
"It was something I can do for them, it was somothing for me to foeus on, and really from then on she said, but Jamie DeMaria, a fellow Notre Dame grad who used to be the. swim team's man­ager, did. He was a chronic e­mail forwarder, and Scott DeMaria loved e-mail, so they became friends via cyberspace. "That's how we reconnected, was through e-mail," she laughed. 
Scott DeMaria accepted a job as a teacher and swim coach at her high school alma mater, Xavier College Preparatory in Phoenix, and asked Jamie to go with her when she chaperoned the school's junior-senior prom. 
When a Xavier student died after an accident with a drunk driver, Scott DeMaria said, Jamie understood the effect it had on her and supported her so she could help the students. 
"What I saw in Jamie was someone who understood how something like that affected me," she said. "And when I saw that quality in him, I knew this was someone who could spend my life with." 
The two are now married (Notre Dame nistory professor Thomas Blantz married them) and live in Annapolis, Md., with their two sons, James and Edward. Scott DeMaria has won the Notre Dame Spirit Award, the Executive Journal Comeback of the Year Award and the Honda Award for Inspiration. The National Women's Leadership Conference named her Woman of the Year, and the Institute for International Sport made her a Fellow. 
Scott DeMaria said going back and writing a book about the incident wasn't tough in itself, but she found certain quirks in her research both frightening and funny. 
"I think I was clearly so naive and young at 18 that I don't think I fully appreciated how horrible physically it was for me," she said. "I suffered collapsed lungs and heart failure, and at times was lucky to come out of these surgeries at all." 
The research was at times comical a<> well. The minutiae· of details she recorded in her jour­nals at the time seemed ridicu­lous 16 years later. 
"[I was] worrying about how the steroids gave me acne and what the guys were going to think," she said. "It was mean­ingless, but it was a huge deal at the time when you're 18." 
The book allowed her to express her understanding to others who have been in similar accidents. She said a girl whose brother suffered a similar injury was in tears at the book signing, saying she wanted her brother to read it. 
"I turned to my husband and I said, 'That's the reason I did this, really just to say to someone I understand,"' she said. 
She stressed the importance of the University, both at the time and to this day, in her successful recovery. When her parents, wanted to move her to a renowned rehab facility, she resisted. It was important for her to be here, she told them, and they got it. She had friends visit from other schools who were amazed at the level of care and support. 
"]My friends said] 'If this wen1 our school, it would happen, peo­ple would say, Geez that sucks, and they would forget about me,"' she said. "And this school has never forgotten."

they never left my mind," she said. "It was, at the time, the only way I knew to honor them." 
In the wake of the accident, Scott DeMaria said, the school mourned as one. 
"It was really a very celebrato­ry time," she said. "For all that we were mourning, for all that we lost, it was a real time of heal­ing." 
To honor her teammates, Scott It's much easier to push it back upright from the front than pulling it from behind. However, these surgeries meant a col­lapsed lung, heart failure and moving her stomach aside to reach the spine. 

But she prevailed-and returned to school in the fall. She didn't swim her sophomore year, and instead covered the swim team for The Observer. 
DeMaria first had to teach her­self to walk, and the way to do so was to mimic an infant. She rolled over, crawled and kneeled dur­ing the learning process, which at 18 years old seemed back­wards and unnecessary to her. 
"Why do need to know how to crawl'? I 
"It was something I can do for them, it was something for me to focus on, and really from then on they never left my mind."

don't wanna crawl, I wanna walk," she said. "I was a stub­born patient, but it served me well." 
The toughest thing about rehab wasn't the physical motions, she said; it was the bizarre lack of sensation in her lower body. Even when standing with the assis­tance of doctors, Scott DeMaria said she couldn't tell if she was upright or sitting when her eyes were closed. 
That summer, back in Phoenix, Scott DeMaria's spine collapsed, and she had three more surger­ies. This time, instead of going through her back, surgeons attacked the spine from the front of her body. She compared the surgeries to righting a fallen tree: 

Her junior year, she was back in the pool, where she said swimming was like riding a bike: It came right back. She felt like she was out of shape after a break at the end of a season, but didn't have to relearn the strokes. Her first meet back, she said, was a sur­real experience 
and an average weekend at the same time. She had the same pre-race routine as before: Fiddle with her goggles, shake out her arms, splash water on herself. 
Her first race after the accident was the 50 freestyle. She won her heat. 
"I think other people celebrated it more than I did," she said. "I thought it was something that I knew I was going to do." 
Scott DeMaria had to stay an extra semester to finish her degree, but that extra semester helped her meet her husband through -of all things -e-mail. 
Scott DeMaria had a business elass and had to set up an e-mail account. No one used computers. much less e-mail, in those days,

At first, it was just for fun; he didn't actually rely on them. But then he realized that my stats were just as accurate as the ones his assistants were taking. 
Taking stats distractnd his assistants from watching the game and giving him advice concerning strate!-,ry. So, when I was about 11 years old, I became the statistician for the team and did it up until the time I was on the varsity squad. It freed my dad's assistants to focus on the game. 
And there was nothing I took more seriously than making sure those stats were correct. 
I didn't want to let my dad down. 
When you're a coaeh's son, there's nothing that gives you more pride than to see your father be a successful coach and you'll do everything you can to pitch in. You'll work as hard as you can, obsess over the smallest of things, just so you can help out your dad in any way.
