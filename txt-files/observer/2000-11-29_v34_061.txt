A Notre Dame commission examines the possibility of ordinating women. Is the ordination of female priests closer than ever or still light years away? 

By MAUREEN SMITHE Assistant News Editor 
When accounting professor Ken Milani was abroad in the United Kingdom several years ago, he encountered a moment of truth, which led him to the Commission on Notre Dame's Position on the Ordination of Women upon his return to the University. 
"There was a statue honor­ing a man who was put to death by the clergy because he translated the Bible into English," Milani said. "The Church isn't always right." 
The Past 
Created in 1989, the Commission was established in response to a letter sent to a Notre Dame faculty mem­ber. The letter indicated that a woman was interested in joining the Catholic clergy, but was obviously unable to be ordained. 
In response, several faculty members from all of the University's colleges came together to keep the discus­sion about women's ordina­tion alive on campus, espe­cially because the University refuses to maintain an official position on the issue. The Committee is informal and not 

South Bend systeID aiIDs to stop cri01e 
By MAUREEN SMITHE Assistant News Editor 
When Notre Dame junior John Bodnovich moved off-campus this fall, he was aware of the safety con­cerns associated with living beyond the friendly con­
fines of the gold­en dome. However, Bodnovich. like many of his off­campus counter­parts, was unaware of a community-


policing network Bodnovlch working throughout South Bend. 
Established in 1997 as a means of improving the relationship between citizens and the police department, the program attempts to address the many causes of crime and the fear associated with it. 
Lieutenant Dick Powers of the South Bend Police Department said the objective of community policing 
officially sanctioned by the University. University presi­dent Father Edward Malloy refused to comment on the issue. 
"We're looking for a more inclusive ministry in the Catholic Church," Milani said. "Notre Dame is a place where the Church does its thinking." 
Committee members ques­tion the meaning behind the Church's refusal to grant women access to the priest­hood. 
"It bespeaks a negative atti­tude toward women," said Regina Coll, professional spe­cialist of Theology. "Is there something wrong with being female?" 
The Present 
Today the Commission has 15 active faculty members from most of the University's colleges. Discussion is their main goal. Commission ·mem­bers strive to push the issue forward through sponsoring three events each semester, including panel discussions, prayer services and lectures. 
The Commission sponsored a lecture Nov. 14 by Mark Roche. He discussed the rela­tionship between intellectuals and religion, encouraging people to qustion their faith in order to strengthen it. 
is three-fold: emphasizing partner­ship, problem solving and preven­tion. 
"The Three P's really put together what our definition of community policing is," Powers said. "It is us and the community working togeth­er." 
The program operates under the understanding that crime is a com­munity-wide problem, not just a duty of the police department. Everyone can contribute to a safe neighborhood. 
Although he is not directly involved in community policing, Bodnovich and his fellow off-cam­pus student neighbors keep an eye on what is going on around their block. 
"We are pretty friendly with our neighbors. We are always watching their houses and they are always checking ours," Bodnovich said. "I've heard of neighborhood watch­es, but I'm not aware of one being officially implemented here." 
Bodnovich recalled an instance where one neighbor tackled a potential bike thief. rescuing anoth­er neighbor's bike from the pawn­
"Our presentations are usu­ally on the issue of women in ministry. We are keeping the educational lines open." Coll said. 
Members of the Commission maintain arguments in sup­port of women's ordination. Most talk of the Church's reliance on tradition as their main stumbling block. Milani said that the Church has changed tradition in several instances, including moving from Latin to English mass. Coll said that Popes, bishops and nuns held slaves in the past, a tradition long since abandoned. 
"We hold onto traditions. It is important to hold onto tra­ditions, but we have let go of many traditions," Coll said. "We are in the process of cre­ating traditions" 
Other arguments against women's ordination exist, all of which the Commission has a viable counterargument for. 
"The original argument that Rome gave when they issued the rule was that Jesus did not ordain women, which is true, but Jesus did not ordain anvone," Coll said. 
i"n addition to discussing women's ordination, the Committee also looks to

shop. 
It is instances such as this where the benefits of community policing are obvious. 
An essential element of communi­ty policing is the neighborhood watch system. Volunteer residents serve as block captains, relaying information regarding area crime from the police department to the neighborhood. 
At a crime prevention seminar held earlier this year for off-cam­pus students, Corporal Patty Byrd outlined the duties of a block cap­tain. 
"They receive automated phone messages of felony arrests, assaults and burglaries that happen in their neighborhood," Byrd said. "Neighborhood watch is one of the most successful means of prevent­ing crime in your neighborhood." 
In addition to neighborhood watch, the police department also offers a citizens police academy. The 10-week course gives residents and off-campus students an oppor­tunity to learn and experience sev­

Robinson: God­


based service good for all 
By KATIE KELLEHER 
News Writer 

God-based service is something everyone could benefit from, said Dr. Jim Robinson Tuesday night at Saint Mary's. 
Robinson travels abroad with Health Care Ministries to provide dental care to poor vil­lagers. He spoke about his personal experiences with God and service. 
"I am an ordinary man," Robinson said, but he insisted that serving others is something anyone could do. 
Robinson has been to more than 25 countries and has taken teens and colle'ge students on ser­vice trips around the world. 
Robinson told stories from his travels in Honduras. 
"We used a second grade classroom," he said. "People traveled overnight from neighboring towns to wait in line at 5 a.m. The line was so long that many would be forced to wait till the

INSIDE COLUMN 
Yup, I'm back. 
I went home to battle bacteria and infection, 
and have reigned victorious. Yay me. 
Home was a different experience. Since I was 
not expected to be home, my brother and father 
had made previous plans 
in California and my mom, 
who had decided to stay 
and !inish her Master's 
degree. was going to be in 
and out of the house. It 
wasn't going to be the 
usual Hager thanksgiving. 
but it didn't matter. 
I wanted to go home so 

much. For the previous 
four weeks all I thought 
about was the great feeling 
of being able to relax and 
just be home. The thought 
made me happy. It offered 
a chance for me to sit in 
my room and do absolutely 
nothing. Absolutely nothing. How appealing. 
Once home, I set up camp in the family room. 
Braving the steps to my bedroom was just too 
much for my tired lungs to handle. So, I set up 
camp on the couch. I basically was glued to the 
couch -along with a pillow. the remote, and a 
box of Kleenex. These few objects in addition to 
the necessity ofmy pillow. my special blanket and 
my poodle -three things that go wherever I go. 
I think I was awake a total of five hours the first 
five days I was home. I would wake up, roll over, 
take drugs, roll back over and sleep. But, after 
getting past the acute stages or illness, I was 
awake enough to think about things and eat solids 
-the novelty of being able to sleep all day ran 
out. I kept thinking: I want to go back home. The 
funny thing, I was already home, but it wasn't 
home home. I was in Arizona. my friends were 
away at school, my family was gone. and my 
mother was somewhere studying. And it occurred 
to me; Sierra Vista just wasn't home without my 
family. It wasn't my home. I grew up there; my 
parents reside there. I live in South Bend. I work 
in South Bend. South Bend is Kelly's home home. I 
vacation in Arizona. 
Maybe it didn't feel like home was because I wasn't coherent enough to enjoy it. I wasn't able to get out and see old friends or eat my mom's cooking. I couldn't even walk the dog. All very dis­tinct things I enjoy doing when I get to go home. My father wasn't there to wait on me by making the special milkshakes that only he can make and playing board games over a cup of tea. And, my brother wasn't there to steal the remote and do obnoxious things to me while I slept. The classic "Kelly's home and sleeping on the couch let's try to wake her up things." Oh, how I missed them. Being sick without Justin was no fun. 
So, probably earlier than I should have, I came back. I missed my friends, I missed putting on my warm winter coat, and I missed the double ring. I was homesick ... and what better way to cure a homesick soul than going home? My home, my South Bend home. 
This isn't to say that I regret making the deci­sion to go back to Arizona. I needed to be there. It is my getaway place -my get better place. But after a little bit of time at home I was rejuvenated and ready to move -not feeling totally up to par. but ready to go back to Indiana to see friends and maybe even attend a class or two. 
So, what am I saying? I guess my Arizona home vacations just aren't effective unless filled with my stinky brother, my good-hearted father and mom, minus the books. And, South Bend will always be my home, because home is where your heart is. 
Notre Dame versus Sierra Vista. 
Who'd you rather? 
Go frish.

Ohio State riot causes $80,000 in damages 

COLUMBUS 

Columbus police estimate that the riots after the OSU-Michigan football game last week will cost Columbus taxpayers more than $80,000. With exact figures still undetermined, there is no clue yet exactly how much the police department actually spent combating the post-game rioters. 
"The riot last April cost us about $80,000. This riot will most likely exceed that." said police spokesman Sgt. Earl Smith. "Anytime we talk about extra manpower, that adds up in a heartbeat." 
Columbus police are still unsure how much money was spent quelling the riots on 13th Avenue in October, but believe the damage done to squad cars during that incident might push its cost total higher than the more recent disturbance. 
Smith cited overtime, equipment costs, the cost of food and refresh­ments for officers and patrol cars as the major expenses for the police department in potentially dangerous situations like the one that took place 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY 
Wrestler dies of heart condition 
As members of the Cornell community continued to cope with the loss of Graham Morin, who passed away during a Saturday afternoon wrestling practice, more details emerged Monday regarding the medical cause of his death. An autopsy revealed that Morin suffered from Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), according to Sharon Dittman, associate director of community relations with Gannett Medical Center. HCM is char­acterized by a thickening of the walls of the heart, which results in an obstruction to blood flow through the left ventricle outflow tract. The result can be fainting spells. shortness of breath and heart arrhyth­mia. "Unfortunately, most people with HCM are asymptomatic," Dittman said. "For many, the first sign may be cardiac arrest and sudden death." "There are only 10 to 25 deaths due to cardiac causes in ath­letes every year, and HCM is only a small fraction of that, so that gives you a sense of how rare this condi­tion really is," Dittman added. It is estimated that one out of every 1,000 Americans has HCM.

during the early morning of Nov. 28. 
The Columbus Division of Police was forced to staff several hundred more officers than usual that night in order tu maintain a presence around the campus. Instead of pulling offi­cers from other areas of the city. the police department simply added more police officers to the shift. The extra work meant most of the officers received overtime pay, ranging any­where from time-and-a-half to dou­ble their regular salary. 
However, as the conflicts pro gressed during the aftermath of the OSU-Michigan game, even those extra officers were not enough. Eventually, the police department did call for backup, a move which left other parts of the city without ade­quate protection.

Families being priced out of college 
Perhaps the idea of keeping a "savings jar" to pay for college may not be a bad idea after all. according to a new economic survey co-authored by University of California-Berkeley Haas School of Business Dean Laura Tyson. UPromise, Inc., a college savings net­work, released the study earlier this month. It deals with the economic effect paying for college has on fam­ily finances. Although it costs $122,350 for an average family to send a child to a university, families are only saving $14,780, the study found. "In today's economy, we know that 'what you earn depends on what you learn,"' Tyson said. "That's why a college education is so important today." The study goes beyond research­ing rising tuition rates and examines the dramatic effect college costs have on consumers' quality of life, standard of living and retirement security. "Two of the goals of this study [are to summarize the rate of return to college as well as document tuition growth," said Dr. Peter Orszag, a UC Berkeley professor of economics who co-authored the report.

Cheney wants to keep health issues private 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Dick Cheney said Tuesday night he was back at work full­time with his doctor's approval, fef'ling fine after his fourth heart attack and determined to keep at least some parts of his suddenly public anatomy pri­vate. 
"I think we have been verv forth-corning," said Cheney. 59, asked on CNN's "Larry King Live" about criticism that he has not made public his health records. 
'"There may be a few people out there who still want to look at certain parts of my anatomy we've not yet revealed, but I'm going tu keep part of it private," he said. 
Cheney, George W. Bush's run­ning mate who is leading his transition effort, checked into a Washington hospital last week for chest pains. Doctors revealed he had suffered a slight heart attack and he underwent surgery. Cheney had three heart attacks more than a decade ago and had quadruple bypass· surgery in 1988 to clear clogged arteries. 


He said doctors gave him a clean bill of health after unusual medical scrutiny when Bush chose him as his running mate this summer. 
"There was a more thorough scrub on my medical history than on any of the other candidates, l think, that were considered fur vice president probably in either party this year," he said. 
But Cheney has refused to release his past medical records. Asked about calls for him to he more forthcoming with his health history, he said: "There isn't much about my physical capabili­ties and history that aren't known. I've seen my coronary arteries diagramed on the front page of major newspapers all over America." 
Cheney said his health won't affect his travel should he become vice president. More than anything, a 50-50 split in the Senate would keep him in Washington more, he said. The vice president presides as Senate president and can cast a tie­breaking vote. 
"l could end up having to spend a lot of time in the U.S. Senate as vice president rather than travel­ing the world attending funerals of foreign leaders," he said. 
Bush, Gore plea to Supreme Court 
. Governor asks Court to end crisis, declare winner 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Supreme Court should "forestall an impending constitu­tional crisis" over Florida's 25 electoral votes, lawycrs for George W. Bush argued Tuesday, while Al Gore's lawyers said the court should not inter­fere. 
Bush, whose appeal the high court is set to hear Friday, said the justices can bring "legal fmality" to the presidential elec­tion by overturning the Florida courts and ending any further ballot recount,;;. 
Florida's decisive 25 electoral votes wore awarded to Bush on Sunday night. Gore is fighting to overturn results of the Florida election and claim those elec­toral votes, and with them the White House. 
"By acting now to reject the Florida Supreme Cowi's w1war­ranted intrusion into the regula­tion of the manner of appointing electors, this court will eliminate the potential for a constitutional crisis," over who picks the elec­tors and how, Bush's lawyers wrote. 
Florida's Republican-led Legislature opened hearings Tuesday into the possibility of selecting its own slate of presi­dential electors. With the legal status of the Florida election still in limbo, it is possible that two different sots of electors could claim legitimacy in Florida. 
"Reversal by this Court would restore the legislatively crafted method for appointing electors in Florida to its status prior to Nov. 7, would allow the completion of the proper seh~ction uf presiden­tial electors in Florida according to the plan contemplated by the Constitution, and would aid in bringing legal finality to this elec­tion," Bush's attorneys wrote. 
Gore's team called the Republican arguments "insub­stantial" and said the Florida court "played a familiar and quintessentially judicial role" in interpreting state law. They asked the justicns to affirm the ruling and avoid trampling on what is supposed to be a matter of state law. 
"Principles of federalism cow1­sel strongly against interference by this court," the Gore legal team said in il'> brief. 
At the same time, the vice president is asking a Florida judge to undo the secretary of state's certification that Bush is the winner. That certification came after the Supreme Court agreed to take Bush's appeal. 
It is not clear how a high court decision would affect the case now. 
"It's very complicated and I don't think anyone knows for sure," said Gore lawyer Laurence Tribe. 
If the justices think they do not have enough left to decide, they could opt not to hear the case after all. Bush's filings Tuesday, however, argued that the court still has a role to play. 
Bush asked the justices to overturn a Florida Supreme Court ruling that allowed hand recounting of votes to continue past a state imposed deadline of Nov. 14, saying tho manual reviews opened tho door for Democrat Gore to continue legal contests for weeks more. 
"The Florida Supreme Court's decision, which conflicts with both federal statutes and the fed­eral Constitution, will thus con­tinue to affect, and has the theo­retical potential to change, the outcome of the presidential elec­tion in Florida, and thus the nation," Bush argued. 
He wants the results of ballots recounted since Nov. 14 omitted from the official state election tally. That would give Bush a 930-vote margin instead of his current 537-vote lead. 
Bush attorneys argued that the Florida high court violated the Constitution by extending a "clear" vote recount deadline set in law by the state Legislature to ensure proper election of the state's representatives to the Electoral College.

The South Bend Police Department's community policing network has received high acclaim since its introduction just three years ago. Earlier this year, South Bend was named a mentor site for cities in the northern third of Indiana looking to establish .commu­nity policing. In addition, the Community Oriented Policing Consortium, an organization based out of Washington DC, chose South Bend as a train­ing site. 
"We took this idea from several communities, includ­ing from the Department of Justice in Washington DC," Powers said. "We were able to customize it for our own community and needs. We a re always trying to improve." 
The many benefits associ­ated with community polic­ing serve to alleviate some of the concerns off-campus stu­dents feel about living in a community different from their own at home.

Dutch first to legalize euthanasia: 
The Dutch parliament approved a bill legaliz­ing euthanasia Tuesday, positioning the Netherlands to become the first nation to opc1nly let doctors help suffering patients end their lives. Advocates of patients' right to die voiced praise for the vote, but many Christian groups and others condemned it, led by the Vatican, which said the law "violates human dignity." Dutch officials stressed that foreign­ers would be unable to meet strict standards under the law for allowing euthanasia.

ISRAEL 


Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 
Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to hold new elections, after Prime Minister Ehud Barak -his government shaken by two months of street battles with the Palestinians -reluctantly agreed to hard-liners' demands for an early vote. 
Polls have shown elec­tions would be a risky proposition for Barak, as his minority government has been steadily losing support from many Israelis who perceive him as inef­fective in ending the blood­shed. 
However. a vote would probably not be held before spring, giving Barak time for a last-ditch effort to forge a peace agree­ment with the Palestinians. Elections could serve as a referendum on the agree­ment. 
Palestinian officials said they were hopeful an accord could be reached before the elections. 
The 120-member legisla­ture voted separately on five bills calling for early elections. Four of the bills were approved by more than 70 members of the house. Only three legisla­tors were opposed, and the rest abstained. 

The date for elections will be set in the coming days by party leaders. Barak said the vote could be held as late as nine months from now, while several opposition law­makers said they expected elections in May, two years after Barak took office. 
Parliament had settled into a long debate on the five bills Tuesday evening when Barak made an unexpected appearance before the lawmakers. In a speech, Barak announced that he would no longer resist the opposition push for elections. 
"I do not flinch from elections. I say if you want elections, let there be elec­tions for prime minister and for the Knesset," Barak told parliament. 
Throughout the day, Barak saw the opposition gain more and more votes. until it became clear that more than half the mem­bers would vote against him. 
In his speech, Barak blamed opposition leader Ariel Sharon for rejecting his offer to create a unity government. However, in a later TV interview, Barak also acknowledged that he had "made mistakes." 
Polls have indicated that if elections were held now, Barak would be defeated.

Activists mark WTO's 
I-year anniversary 
Associated P rcss 
SEATrLE 
The World Trade Organization 

meeting that collapsed in clouds of 
tear gas a year ago is being 
marked by activists this week in a 
city that's now known as much for 
civic haplessness as it is for its good 
coffee and charm. 
The violent anti-WTO street 

protests that overwhelmed police 
on Nov. 30, 1999 left Seattle with 
permanent scars, some say, even 
as it galvanized a growing move­
ment against corporate globaliza­
tion. 
"One of the biggest things we learned with WTO is that Seattle is not Mayberry with high-rises," said City Council member Judy Nicastro. "People don't play nice anymore." 
To mark the one-year anniver­sarv. some 5,000 activists are expected to gather Thursday for "N30," 1.he International Solidarity Day Against Corporate Globalization. 
That number is a fraction of the 50,000 protesters who showed up last year, bent on blocking streets and shutting down the WI'O meet­ing. By the time the tear gas cleared, about 600 people had been arrested, property damage totaled some $3 million, and Seattle had become a global symbol of popular defiance. 
Seattle officials, who'd banked on a civic boost as hosts to the talks, were instead targeted by critics for failing to prepare and for overre­acting to protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets and arrests. 
Soon after, Police Chief Norm 
Stamper announced his early 
retirement. Mayor Paul Schell, 
another target of frequent and 
harsh criticism, has yet to 
announce whether he'll seek 
another term. 
Carlos Lavin, 49, who has lived in 
Seattle for 23 years, said last year's 
demonstrations gave outsiders the 
,,vrong impression. 
"It wasn't good for the city's 
image.. It was very un-Seattlelike," 
Lavin said. "Mv view of Seattle is 
what it's always been. It's a great 
town. But the rest of the country 
probably thinks we're a bunch of 
radicals, which is good because it 
might keep them away from here." 
The impact of the demonstra­tions extended well beyond Seattle as officials in other cities hosting trade and banking conferences sought to avoid repeating the mis­takes of Seattle. 
In Washington, more than 1,300 activists, many of them veterans 01' Seattle WTO, were arrested at the April meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Last month in British Columbia, organizers citing the Seattle protest scrapped a planned NATO confer­ence over cost and security con­cerns. 
Thousands of anti-globalization protesters also descended on the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, a meeting of the Organization of American States in Windsor, Ontario, and the "G-20" meeting of industrialized and developing nations in Montreal, as well as smaller trade events in Cincinnati, Calgary and elsewhere. 
U.S. promotes cultural diplomacy 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Pingpong diplomacy in 1971 smoothed U.S. rela­tions with China. When the United States reached out to a new 

democra­tic South Africa, perform­ers from t h e Dance Theater () f 


H a r le m Albright helped forge diplomacy. As the Cold War thawed, pianist Vladimir Horowitz returned to his native Russia in 1986 to give concerts. 
Culture speaks a univer­sal language and can play a critical role in U.S. relations abroad even where America has no formal diplomatic relations, President Clinton said Tuesday at the first White House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy. 
"Cultural diplomacy does have the power to penetrate our common humanity," Clinton said. 
Glen Miller and other American jazz bands had a positive effect on the morale of U.S. allies during World War II, he said. And singer Elvis Presley did more to win the Cold War when his music was smug­gled into the former Soviet Union than he did as a GI serving in Germany, the 
president added. 

Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who wore a Navajo bolo ­a symbol of America's early heritage -were joined in the East Room by about 160 authors, artists. diplomats, 
actors, actress­es, poets. business leaders, founda­t i O 11 directors from the United States a n d

Clinton dismissed the argument that western cul­ture has become too perva­sive -that soon every child will speak American English and every television will be tuned to MTV. Globalization should not be feared, he said. It should not blur cultural lines, but highlight them in a way to promote peace, Clinton said. 
That, he said would "put a real roadblock in the path of those who would like the 21st century dominated by cultural wars. not cultural celebrations."

Gore's fight spreads to 5 different courts 
Associated Press 
Al Gore sought a speedy hand recount of Florida's contested ballots Tuesdav to ensure "no question, no cloud" hangs over the nation's 43rd president. A judge rejected his timetable, Democratic lawyers vowed to appeal and Republic.ans demanded, "It's time to wrap this up.'' 
As tbe campai1:,rn played out .in five separate courtrooms, the vice president sought to acceler­ate the proceedings to avoid fur­ther testing of the public's patience three weeks after Election Day. 
"Seven days, starting tomor­row, for a full and accurate count of all the votes," the vice president said shortly after his lawyers asked Circuit Judge Sanders Sauls to order the recount of 13,000 questionable ballots in two Democratic coun­ties. 
The judge instead scheduled a Saturday hearing and ordered the ballots -along with one or two voting machines -sent to Tallahassee in case he agrees that a recount is needed. Bush's lawyers objected to Gore's

timetable, saying they needed time to prepare their case against him. 
Sauls is working against a Dec. 12 deadline for states to assigri presidential electors. 
"We could count until every­body is slap-happy, but ifno one is on the same page, T don't know what's being accom­plished," Sauls said, explaining why he wanted one broad-rang­ing hearing before considering Gore's recount request. 
The political morass stretched to the U.S. Supreme Court, with Bush's lawyers asking the nine justices to bring "legal finality" to the election by overturning Florida's top court and ending any further recounts. The case has tbe "potential to change the outcome of the presidential election in Florida, and thus the nation," Bush lawyers said in legal papers. 
Gore's legal team argued in its high court brief that the issue "does not belong in federal court." They want the justices to back the Florida Supreme Court. a Democratic-leaning body that extended the deadline for recounts. U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments are set for Friday. 
Bush considers choices for cabinet 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas 

George W. Bush is "on track" in planning a new government, one that would include Democrats in key positions, 
aides sug­gested Tuesday. Still, contin­uing legal clouds sub­dued some of Bush's optimism. 
"We arc now in uncharted 
waters," said Bush spokes­woman Karen Hughes. "We're in an unprecedented period where a presidential candidate is going to court essentially to try to contest and overturn the results of an election that has now been certified." 
She told reporters during an afternoon briefing at campaign headquarters that Bush contin­ues to insist he not be called "president elect" because of the current court challenges by Democratic rival Al Gore. 
"The governor has asked us all to be humble and to be gra­cious," she said. 
"We are mindful of the fact that the vice president ... a little more than an hour ago reiter­ated that he is continuing in 

Bush 
trip 

in Crawford. about a two-hour drive north of here. Since Election Day, Bush has divided his time between the governor's mansion here and the secluded 1,500-acre ranch. 
Running mate Dick Cheney, who is overseeing transition planning, was to join in at the ranch later in the week. 
"They will be discussing tran­sition efforts," said Ari Fleischer. Bush's transition spokesman. 
But Bush aides said that it appears unlikely that Bush will name any prospective Cabinet appointments before the Supreme Court has a chance to hear the case Friday. 
Colin Powell, Bush's known choice to be secretary of state, was reluctant to participate in any such announcement while so many legal issues remain to be resolved, aides said. 
Still, Bush pressed ahead in planning behind the scenes for a transition to power, meeting 
on Tuesday first "Obviously. we want to between

chief of staff. Podesta. Card later governor Podesta 
told reporters that the two discussed prospective appoint­ments -and that some candi­dates for top Bush jobs might be brought to Texas later this week. 
Asked about whether Bush could meet a Jan. 4 timetable suggested by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to begin con­firmation hearings, Card said, "Obviously, we want to have names presented such that they can be considered by the Senate. We're on track." 
Card said that Bush clearly intends to reach out to Democrats in forming a gov­ernment because of the close­ness of the election. But he refused to respond to a ques­tion on whether former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., was among those Democrats being consid­ered. 
Nunn. former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was viewed as a possible Bush choice for defense secretary. 
"He had Democrats serving in his administration in Texas, as well as Republicans," Card ear­lier told CNN. "And I think you can expect him to do the same in leading the country." 
Cheney said much the same thing earlier Tuesday when he appeared on NBC's "Today" Show. 
"The governor has given me instructions to look in those areas," he said. "We clearly will." 
The Texas governor. mean­while, picked up one of the trappings of the presidency: a promise from the Clinton White House for daily national securi­ty briefings. 
Such CIA briefings, with Gore currently gets as vice president, were promised in a Monday evening phone call 
said he and 

Card "dis­cussed how we could move for­ward." 
White House press secretary Jake Siewert said Podesta and Card had a "cordial" conversa­tion. 
"John offered to meet with him and offered to meet wi.th him either with the vice presi­dent's transition staff or sepa­rately," Siewert said. "We'll be happy to arrange such a meting to give them an overview of where we are in the transition." 
While supporting the federal General Services Administration's decision against releasing funds or office space to Bush for a transition, Siewert said the White House was waiting for the Justice Department to complete a for­mal written opinion on the Presidential Transition Act.

Closing one chapter, opening another 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
While most of the United States watched the drama slowly unfold in Florida, President Bill Clinton made a historic visit to communist Vietnam. Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam since the 
Brieanne
Vietnam War ended. 

Many people find Porter the situation ironic since Clinton is an admitted draft­The Battalion dodger. 
However, the irony is unimportant -Clinton's visit marks a milestone in 
U.S. relations with Vietnam. 

While many remember the war with heavy hearts. this visit helps close that sad part of American history, 
The visit does not dishonor the soldiers who fought in the war, but it gives clo­sure to many while working to improve relations with Vietnam. 
Clinton's presidency has focused on America's relationship with Vietnam. Starting with the gradual lifting of embargoes in 1994, Clinton has worked to improve ties with Vietnam, including opening diplomatic relations in 1995. 
This year saw the earnest beginning of a Vietnamese-American trade agree-· ment. 
But the culmination of this progress was Clinton's visit. Although heavily cen­sured by the Viclnamesc government, Clinton talked about the issues of human rights and a democratic government. 
Clinton believes that when Vietnam 
interacts with the world through eco­
nomic means, the Vietnamese will gain 
more individual and political freedoms. 
"I think that the trend toward freedom is virtually irreversible," Clinton said. 
When the trade doors open between the United States and Vietnam, everyone will benefit. 
Because 60 percent of Vietnam's popu: lation is under the age of 30, U.S. corRpa­nies in Vietnam will have an able work­force. 
According to The Boston Globe, "At $370 a year. Vietnam still has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world." 
While many Americans would com­plain about the loss of jobs, America would receive more jobs when compa­nies began exporting goods to Vietnam. 
This would be a win-win situation, with more jobs for both countries. 
With Clinton's trip to a country where 58,000 American soldiers and 3 million Vietnamese died only a quarter century ago, many people awaited to see what he would say about the war. 
Ointon offered no apologies for the conflict. but instead discussed the future of these two countries. He avoided assigning blame for the war. 
To many Vietnam veterans. the move was an important one. Clinton did not dishonor those who fought, and he even visited a site where bodies of' American pilots shot down during thr war had been found. 
At least 20 soldiers who were listed as missing in action will be returned to the United States foi-burial. 
Clinton's trip offered hope to the Vietnamese for a more global economy while introducing a possible market for American businesses. 
Yet, he also respected America's veter­ans by not accepting blame for the war. Vietnam will be a new market for American businesses to expand their consumer base and their employee pool. 
The most impressive part of' Clinton's visit is that he got the two countries to discuss their future. 
Clinton said that the countries' histo­ries have "intertwined" for many years and that the countries need to put the "painful" past behind them, 
While many Vietnamese government ofTicials were nervous that Clinton would discuss political changns, Clinton dis­cussed trade and only lightly touched on other issues. 
Clinton's trip to Vietnam respected America's veterans and encouraged dis­cussion of economic opportunities !'or both countries.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Responses to homosexual issues 
Room for differences in Church 
I am writing in response to Professor Rice's recent article on homosexuality. As an alumnus, a Catholic and someone who has recently come to accept himself as gay, I have struggled with this issue for most of my life. While Professor Rice is undoubtedly well intentioned, I respectful­ly disagree with the Church's teaching and Professor Rice. 
Professor Rice argues that homosexual acts and the inclination toward them are objectively disordered because they are contrary to the nature built into us by God. As with many others, I spent most of my life., including my years at Notre Dame, believing this idea. After 26 years. however. I have come to reject this premise because I discovered that, rather than bringing me closer to Christ, the Church and those around me, it was the source of an alienation that I have struggled with my entire life. 
While Professor Rice argues that homosexual­ity is contrary to the nature built into us by God, this misses the point. God has created each of us with a different purpose. The Church, as the body of Christ. is not a single part. but many. God placed the parts, each as he intended. If they were all one part, where would the body be? But as it is. there are many parts, yet one body (1 Cor. 13:18-20). God calls each person to many different things, each according to his plan. While the Church and Professor Rice may choose to describe certain parts of the body as objective­ly disordered, we are all Christ's body (1 Cor. 13:27). 
This raises the question, what is the essential nature God has placed within us? In this, Jesus was most clear: You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself (Luke 10:27). 
When I believed that I was objectively disor­dered, l could not love God, I could not love myself, I could not love my neighbor. Rather, I could only believe that somehow God had made some sort of mistake. that my very being was an affront to creation. 
At my lowest days, God granted me the grace to accept myself, not as someone who is objec­tively disordered. but rather as God's creation, born to love God as God created me. For me to accept what the Church and Professor Rice teach is to deny God's wisdom, to deny God. 
As such, I cannot disagree more with Professor Rice's contention that the University misleads students by refusing to admit that the homosexual inclination is disordered. While this may imply that the Church teaching is an arbi­trary restriction. so he it. While the University has been less than a vanguard in accepting its gay and lesbian students and alumni, such a dec­laration would only serve to further push us away from the University, the Church and from Christ. I cannot think of any more serious betray­al of its mission.

Clarifying stance on 


gay issues 
I should like to respond to your editorial in The Observer on Friday, Nov. 10, in which you distorted my response on the question of suicide among teenage homosexuals. I simply took issue with the assertion that among teenagers who think they are homosexual there is a very high rate of suicide. 
A United States government agency in D.C. had made such a statement and subsequently had corrected its own state­ment. This does not mean that I regard suicide among homo­sexual men and women as "inconsequential." I have always taken this issue seriously in my counseling of people with same-sex attractions and never "seriously dismissed" them. I am dismayed by this direct attack upon my character. coming as it does, from The Observer. 
My response to the letter by William Dell, class of '69 on Nov. 13 is to appeal to your readers, asking them to read my books on the issue: "The Homosexual Prison" and "The Truth About Homosexuality". In doing so you will realize that Dell has no understanding of the Church's teaching on chastity. 
Married people are bound by conjugal chastity, which does not mean abstinence from marital intercourse, but rather fidelity to each other and the avoidance of contra­ception and masturbation. In brief, chastity is a gift of God's grace by which we are able to control sexual desires and express affection in the right way, according to our state in life, recognizing that sexual intercourse is meant only for the married. 
Rev. John F. Harvey, OSFS director ofCourage Nov. 27,2000 

What is the chaplain's role in the military? 
If you pick up a Catholic magazine, like Commonwealth or America, you'll likely find an ad for the Army challenging you to "Be All That You Can Be." But it's not an ad for soldiers or officers; it's for chaplains. The picture is of a priest in full fatigues and a stole around his neck, indi­cating readiness for front-line Illlnistry. Though ads such as this are provocative, raising questions about church and mili­tary. they point to a larger social fact: The armed forces have a quite large sys­tem of chaplaincy that offers religious services to soldiers. 
And given the questions that this cam­pus has been asking the past couple of years about Catholics, war and ROTC, those who have been chaplains and those who have known chaplains in their assignments have a unique and impor­tant insight that can be fascinating and valuable to the church. 
The experience of chaplains offers much to the conversalion, whether one comes down on the side of pacifism or on the legitimacy of certain acts of war. Here at Notre Dame, our own Father Corby was one of this nation's most famous chaplains during the Civil War, tending to the Union's Irish Brigade ­illustrated in the statue on the front lawn of Corby Hall. In fact, some have thought it was his service to this "Fighting Irish" troop that yielded the moniker of our sports teams (they are wrong, though: it seems it was a New York sportswriter). 
Even the word chaplain has interesting roots -and roots not unrelated to mili­tary history -in the church. In the fourth century, soon after the Roman Empire was christianized by Constantine. a young soldier named Martin (St. Martin ofTours) saw a cold, shivering beggar on his way to duty. Dressed as he was in his the service of that mercy and make it thick military cloak (called then a cappa), manifest in the lives of their people. This the experience constellated for him at is not to say underhandedly that chap-once all his feelings about the empire's lains ought to be anti-military; it is only to treasures going to works of war and not recall where the word actually comes 
~~~~~­
So he drew his sword and sliced his sizeable cappa in two, giving one to the beggar for warmth. In a dream, Christ, as the beggar, thanked him. Then Martin renounced his military oath saying, "I am a sol­dier of Christ and it is not lawful for me to fight." 
His act attracted a following and his devotees preserved his half of the cappa as a sign of his saintly life. The room in which they preserved it was then called a capella. from which we get the important words chapel and chaplain. From that time on, a chapel was a place that always brought one into the remembrance and presence of Christ's mercy as it was made manifest in charity and love. And chaplains are men and women who are, put simply, at 
~~~~~~~ 
thought. Jump ahead now over 1,600 years and see the situation of sol­diers in the era of modern warfare. Imagine -for, to be sure. this situation was real -a 
young Catholic serving in 
the United States Air Force in 1990 when the U.S. 
began Operation 
Desert 

Shield, then Desert Storm. ,tn He is assigned ,\)-to take part in tlying sorties, bombing raids on 
Baghdad. He is informed well before the bombing begins, that 
the Pope has named the pos­sibility of war on Iraq immoral, 
appealing that non-violent means be 
employed to seek resolution. The letter 
causes him to tl1ink deeply about his role. He knows that Catholic teaching sup-· ports his right not to fight in this particu­
lar conflict because the church has spo­ken against it, a right known as selective conscientious objection. Yet he also knows that U.S. military law only recog­nizes conscientious objection to all war, and does not allow someone in his case to refuse this particular mission. 
As he ponders all this, he goes for advice to the Catholic chaplain of his unit. Here is where the story becomes nuanced. For some young soldiers in this situation. the chaplains offered the advice that loyalty to their military oath requires service -no matter what. Many other Catholic chaplains knew well that the sit­uation was more difficult and gave many different forms of advice. In this case, most Catholics fought in the Gulf War and chaplains were there when they returned to offer mercy and support, sometimes tending to the deep wounds of war. 
Honestly, it's hard to write about this topic. Each of these stories can be read ­and written -with a view to how they impact the "debate" on war and ROTC hero. The first may question Church sup­port of military service and the second may show why we desperately need chaplains. But my purpose here is not to further one side. As someone who has never been in a war or been a military chaplain, I have a limited perspective. 
And so what do we do when our per­spective is limited, as all are? We get together and talk, and have people who "have been there" tell their stories, then we pray over it and retlect some more.

Mid-winter blues got you dreaming of sunny bea 
Travel planning Web sites cater to college students, offer deals on all-inc/us 

By MERIDETH PIERCE Scene Wrirer 
It is almost December and the weath­er just keeps getting colder. To top it off, exams are growing ever closer and students are beginning to feel as though hibernation might be a genius idea. For those who choose not to hide away in dorm rooms covered in blan­kets, there is one driving idea that keeps them warm: spring break. 
Although spring break feels like it might never come, it is actually just 100 short days away. With the need for warm thoughts and with time quickly ticking away, now is the perfect time to start planning. 
But where will you go? What will you do? And how arc you supposed to plan out an entire dream vacation? 
To stop your worries, check out the help and deals on-line. There are hun­dreds of resources at your fingertips that all eagerly want to help you have a fun vacation for minimal costs. 
The popular Travelocity.com is a great place to start. In general, Travelocity.com is easy to use and con­tains many tools to aid in every aspect of your vacation planning. 
You are allowed two visits to the site without becoming a member. but if you decide to purchase from Travel­ocity.com, membership is a must. 
Although signing up is free, you are required to enter contact information such as your name and e-mail address. Once this is done. you are set to go. 
Travelocity.com offers reservations for more than 400 airlines. 47,000 hotels and 50 car rental companies. They offer thousands of vacation pack­ages and cruise offerings that cater to your interests. along with information on hundreds of destinations from guidebook experts and other Travel­ocity.com members. 
With so many options, it is easy to get carried away with plans for numerous destinations. However, the best way to critique the site is to look at one specif­ic vacation destination and everything that it involves. 
Many col­lege stu­dents will a g a i n swarm to Cancun, Mexico, this year. 
Its ever­gr owing popularity as one of MTV's offi­cial spring break loca­tions pro­vides many routes for visiting Mexico this break. 
Travel­ocity.com provides you with several options to plan a vacation to Cancun. You can either book your flight, hotel and attractions separately on this site, or book a package deal. 
The simplest option is working through their "planning a vacation" site. This can be reached by clicking on 
the "vaca­tion" but­ton at the top of' the h o m e ­page. 
0 n c e you are h e r e , there are 
m a n y 

databases available, listed by "interest," by "desti­nation," or by "search and com­pare." 
"Search and com­pare" is a 
groat tool where you can choose your package type, maximum price per per­son, destination and time of travel. Then Travel­ocity.com will bring up all the possibilities arranged by hotels. 
The great thing about this aspect of Travel­ocity.com is that you can select up to 10 vacations that arc of interest and the site will list and compare them in a chart that is easy to read. 
Next you can choose whether or not you want the airfare included in the package. If you choose this, Travelocity.com will pull up all your flight options. 
Through Travelocity­.com. the price range of packages for one adult to Cancun for six days and seven nights in the week of March 10 -18 ranges from $1,109 to nearly $2,000. 
This price does not include airfare, which can be an additional $500 to $1,500, depending on your flight preferences. 
Once you decide on a vacation pack­age, Travel­ocity.com has many "add­ons" that you can choose from. Many of these vacation add-ons are tours that range in price from $39 to $97 for one person. 
If this does not interest you. do not fear: there are many more travel Web sites with packages to choose from. However, not many other sites offer the vast amount of choices and 

variety in locations that Travelocity.com has for vacation pack­ages. 
Other travel sites such as Priceline.com offer plane tickets. as does Travelscape.com. 
Travelscape.com is simi­lar to Travelocity.com in that it has a large selec­tion of hotels as well as plane tickets, but it does not offer vacation pack­ages. 
Most other sites that offer spring break vaca­tion packages have much narrower options. 
Many sites can be found that offer vacations to sunny places like Cancun, Jamaica and Daytona Beach. These vacations are directed toward the fun-loving college student. 
A perfect example of this is Springbreak.com. This site is a notch down in professionalism from Travelocity.c.om, but still provides great vacation options. 

Highlighted vacations can be planned 
for several sites in Florida such as 
Daytona Beach and Orlando. There are 
also four Mexican locations. including 
Cancun and Acapulco. Vacations to 
Jamaica are also an option. 
Once you have picked a destination 
from the site's map, you are brought to 
a page that lets you choose your type of 
hotel from either "beachfront." 
"lagoon" or "downtown" locations. 
This option narrows down your choic­
es and makes searching for a hotel 
much easier. 
Springbreak.com's biggest downfalls are the hard-to-distinguish pricing guide and the site's tendency to circle back to the home page. Bottom line prices are rarely. if ever. available on the Web site, although it docs publish companies' phone numbers. 
If you can get past tlrnse annoyances. there are definite perks in planning your vacation through Spring­break.com. especially if' you are ready to let loose on your spring break. 
One of these Springbreak.com perks arrives when you check into your hotel. You will be given an "Arrival Pak" that contains a week-long party schedule telling you where to find the hot day­
time events and nighttime parties.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Blue Devils earn last-minute win 
Associatccl Press 
GREENSBORO, N.C. Duke won its first test of the season at No. 1 -barely. 
The undefeated Blue Devils (6-0) got 23 points from Jason Williams and 21 from Mike Dunleavy to beat Illinois (No. 8 ESPN/USA Today; No. 9 AP) 78­77 in the marquee matchup in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge on Tuesday night. 
Williams and Dunleavy matched career highs. while Carlos Boozer, saddled with foul trouble most of the night and held to three points in the first half, scored 12 in the second. 
Frank Williams led Illinois (4­
2) with 19 points. 
Duke led 70-68 with 3:53 left. but Boozer hit two free throws. and Dunleavy scored on a layup and 3-pointer in a span of 30 seconds as the Blue Devils grabbed control 77-68. 
But the Blue Devils had to survive a wild finish in which they turned the ball over twice in the final 1: 31. 
The win improved Duke to 125-18 all-time as the nation's top-ranked team. But this one didn't come easy against a

-physical Illinois team that beat the Blue Devils on the boards 42-27. But the Fighting lllini (4-2), playing its second No. 1 team in a span of six days, turned it over 26 times and couldn't pull out the close one down the stretch. Illinois lost to then-No. 1 Arizona 79-76 in the title game of the Maui Invitational. Neither team led by more than three points in the opening 7 1/2 minutes of the second half in a game that took on an NCAA tournament type of feel between two teams predicted to win their respective conference titles. 
But the Blue Devils went on a 9-0 run as Williams scored on a drive and an 8-foot bank shot. Shane Battier hit a 3-pointer and Boozer added two free throws. 

Coach Mike Krzyzewski got on his knees during the run, plead­ing with his team to put Illinois away. But lllinois made six free throws and got a 3-pointcr from Sean llarrington to go on a 11-1 run of its own to regain the lead by three before Duke's late run. 
Each team came in shooting better than 50 percent from the field, but both struggled in the opening 20 minutes on offense. 
Illinois had trouble with Duke's press early on and ended up turning it over 14 times in the first half. During one stretch, Illinois coughed it up five times in seven posses­sions, but a 24-10 rebounding edge kept the score close. 
Meanwhile, the Blue Devils couldn't penetrate the zone of the Fighting Illini and had trou­ble from the outside, hitting just 3 of 12 3-pointers while shoot­ing 40 percent. 
Hawkeyes 85 
Yellow Jackets 67 
Luke Recker scored 21 points and Reggie Evans recorded his third double-double in as many games with 17 points and 15 rebounds as Iowa beat Georgia Tech 85-67 Tuesday night. 
Iowa (3-0) took the lead for good midway through the first half after trailing by as many as six points and pulled away from the Yellow Jackets (3-1) down the stretch. 
Dean Oliver added 14 points for Iowa, which outrebounded Tech 45-22 and shot 62 percent in the second half. Alvin Jones led Georgia Tech with 24 points. Tony Akins and Marvin Lewis each scored 15. 
Iowa led 54-42, its biggest lead to that point, after Recker sank three free throws with 
12:30 left. Akins then scored seven straight Georgia Tech points, including a 3-pointer that drew the Yellow Jackets to 56-49. They got no closer. 
Oliver sank two free throws 
for a 58-49 lead and answered 
a Georgia Tech basket with a 3­
pointer from the left wing. A 
Ryan Hogan free throw and a 3­
pointer by Recker finished an 
11-2 run that gave Iowa a 65-51 
lead with 8:47 remaining. 
Hecker then hit two more 3­pointers to keep Iowa safely ahead, the first with 4:50 left to make it 75-61 and the second with 3:25 to play, starting an 8­0 burst that stretched the lead to 8365 and finished off the Yellow Jackets. 
Demon Deacons 71 
Wolverines 60 
Robert O'Kellev scored 19 points to lead No. 12 Wake Forest to a come-from-behind victory over Michigan in an ACC/Big Ten Challenge game. 
Michigan (2-2) led by 11 with 16 minutes to play, but couldn't hold off the more experienced Demon Deacons (5-0). Wake Forest, last season's NIT cham­pion, has won 10 straight games, second in the nation to only Michigan State's 14 in a row. 
Darius Songaila had 13 points for Wake Forest, while Antwan Scott added 12 and Josh Shoemaker had 10. 
LaVell Blanchard led the Wolverines with 13, and Bernard Robinson Jr. and Josh Asselin each added 12. 
The Wolverines led 32-29 at the half behind 10 points and five rebounds from Blanchard and held the Demon Deacons scoreless for the first four min­utes of the second. Asselin and Chris Young scored four points each as Michigan built the lead to 40-29. · Wake Forest, though, answered with a 13-4 run that got them within 44-42 with 
12:35 to go. The Demon Deacons took a 47 -46 lead on O'Kelley's 3-pointer. then expanded the margin to 53-48 with 8:30 left.

say the women on the team only needed that little boost to let them know that they were good enough to win. 
"They didn't believe in themselves [last yearJ," she said. "Now they believe they can do anything." 
In addition. the team has taken on a new attitude. The women aren't playing these games to avoid losing; they're in to win. That determination, along with that boost of confi­dence. has done a lot for this team. but it doesn't end there. 
Smith has had a huge hand in this team's turn around. In addition to being full time, new and young, she inspires team confidence and respect much more successfully than last year's head coach, Dave Roeder, ever did. 
"Coach Smith is young, but we still really respect her," Matha told me earlier this week during an interview. "She's been the reason this team has turned around." 
Smith put her team mem­bers on a physical fitness pro­gram this summer. something that did not occur last season. The team had open gyms to stay in shape. And once MIM regulations allowed the team to handle the ball in Smith's presence, the real work began. 

In addition to the specifics of practice, Smith has done a lot to bring this team closer together. Spending several weeks together this summer helped the team better their communication and team spirit. 
Of course, I can't promise a season riddled with success, but this season has already been a success, considering this team has won nearly as many games in two weeks as the team won all last season. 
The new problem for the team will be keeping their focus as it comes off of' the exciting tournament victory. 
However, even if' some loss­es intercede, which I'm sure they will, this young team beneath Smith's leadership promises to be exciting to watch.

NBA 

Hornets hit new record in 95-63 victory 
Associat,ed Pre.s 

CHARLOlTE, N.C. 
Hodney White scored 20 points and Charlotte hit a team-record 16 3­pointers Tuesday night in a 95-63 vic­tory against Miami. 
Demon Brown scored 16 points for Charlotte {3-1), Jobey Thomas had 15, Diego Guevara scored 12 and James Zimmerman had 11, 
It was Charlotte's second rout in 10 days of a team from a high-profile conference. The 49ers. l'rom Conference USA, blew oul North Carolina State 95-78 in Haleigh on Nov. 18. 
The Niners had hoped the victory would push them into the Top 25 fo·r the lirst time in two years, buL a last­second 79-78 loss to St. Bonaventure on Saturday spoiled their expecta­tions. 
Against Miami, they set out early to redeem themselves by taking quick and confident shots at the basket ­especially from long range. 
The 49ers, who are averaging 11 3­pointers a game, hit seven in the deci­sive first half. They finished 16-of-32 from long range, making so many that the students who had been hanging yellow 3s after each one ran out at 15. 
Guevara led the barrage by making 4-of-7. while Zimmerman was 3-for­
4. 

Miami (3-1) jumped out to a quick 17-8 lead, but the 49ers started hit­ting their shots to close the gap and then pull away. 
Guevara and Brown hoth hit 3s at the beginning of a 12-2 run that gave Charlotte the lead for good at 20-19. The Niners then shifted into their transition offense and poured it on the Hurricanes. 
Zimmerman and White hit long 3­pointers in another 12-2 run that gave Charlotte a 42-28 lead with 2:03 to play in the half. 
Miami, which returned only one starter from the team that won a share of' the Big East title last year, couldn't match Charlotte's offensive punch and never regrouped. 
The Hurricanes got 16 points from John Salmons. James Jones added 12. 
Hawks 103, Wizards 75 

Lorenzen Wright scored 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as the Atlanta Hawks snapped a 22-game road losing streak with a win over the Washington Wizards. 
Alan Henderson added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Hawks, who had lost eight straight road games this season and hadn·t won away from home since Feb. 25 in Seattle. It was the franchise's longest road losing streak since the 1975-76 Hawks lost 29 away games over two seasons. 
Rod Strickland scored 17 points for Washington, which missed the oppor­tunity to earn back-to-back wins for the first time this season. 
The game, which featured two of the worst offensive teams in the NBA. was decided by the haUtime. Atlanta broke the game open by holding Washington to two field goals the final 8 1/2 minutes of the second quarter. The Wizards only points during that stretch were a layup by Mitch Richmond and a three-point play by Richard Hamilton. 
The Hawks closed the quarter with a 20-5 run to build a 50-30 halftime lead and weren't threatened in the second hall'. 
The Hawks earned their first road win of the season without their lead­ing scorer Jim Jackson, who was placed on the injured list Friday with a sprained right knee. 
The Wizards shot 33 percent from the field and were outrebounded 50­38. 
Celtics 87, Cavaliers 72 
Antoine Walker scored 28 poirits and the Boston Celtics got their first road win of the season with a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who scored just four points in the second quarter. 
Paul Pierce added 20 points as the Celtics snapped a 10-game losing streak at Gund Arena and handed the Cavs their first loss at home in seven games this season. 
Boston outscored Cleveland 29-4 in the final 6:44 of the period with things getting so bad that at one point, 7 ­foot-3 center Zydrunas Ilgauskas grabbed a rebound underneath and clanged a putback dunk. 
It wasn't that Boston's defense was doing anything special. The Cavs just couldn't make shot. They missed 3­pointers, mid-range jumpers, layups and nearly everything else they put up. However, the Cavs didn't miss a free throw -they didn't try one. 
Chris Gatling's jumper and a driving layup by Robert Traylor were the only points in the quarter for the Cavs, who set a new franchise record for the fewest points in a period. 
They did manage to avoid the NBA's dubious record for fewest poinl<; in a quarter. That mark still belongs to the Dallas Mavericks, who scored just two in the third quarter against the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6, 1997. 
The Cavs didn't swre again until Andre Miller hit a jumper with 9:46 remaining in the third quarter ­snapping an 8:58 scoring drought ­and earning the team a sarcastic ova­tion from its fans. 
Eric Williams scored 12 of his 14 points on 3-pointers for the Celtics, who came in 0-4 on the road this sea­son and hadn't won in Cleveland since April 4, 1995. 
Boston didn't exactly light it up from the field, either. The Celtics shot just 43 percent from the outside but made 9 of 21 3-pointers. 
Trailing 27 -20 after one, the Celtics scored the first nine points of the sec­ond quarter but couldn't have imag­ined the run they were about to go on. With the scored tied at 31-all, Williams made consecutive 3-pointers as the Celtics ripped off 18 straight points to close the half. 
With his team launching bricks on virtually every possession, Cleveland coach Randy Wittman looked to his bench for an answer but it didn't seem to matter who was on the floor for the Cavs.

Texas has Holiday Bowl expectations 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO 
T~xas is expected to be invited to play in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 29, against either Oregon State or Oregon. 
Holiday Bowl officials scheduled a news conference for Wednesday morning to announce which Big 12 team they've selected, but refused further comment. llowever, a football source, speaking un condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press the invi­tation is expected to go to the No. 12 Longhorns (9-2). 
In Austin, Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds wouldn't confirm or deny the invita tion. .. "I _won't r~act," he said Tuesday evening. 
We re workmg on the details. Hopefully we'll know soon. When we do, we'll call a press conference." 
This will be the first trip to San Diego f'or Texas, which is believed to covet a Holiday Bowl berth because of the recruiting expo­sure the Longhorns will receive in California. 
The Holiday Bowl would like to pair the Longhorns against No. 5 Oregon State (10-1), which remains in the Bowl Championship Series picture. The Beavers will know by Sunday if they are headed to a BCS game, or they could be released from BCS considera­tion before then. 
If Oregon State goes to the BCS, the Pacific­10 Conference's berth in the Holiday Bowl will go to No. 9 Oregon (9-2). 
No. 10 Nebraska, which lost to Arizona in the 1998 Holiday Bowl, also was considered for the Big 12's berth. Nebraska is still under consideration for a BCS game. 
Texas is coming off a 43-17 win over Texas AM. Sophomore quarterback Chris Simms, son of former New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, had a breakout game with 383 yards passing and three touchdowns.

MASTERS CUP 
Hewitt, Agassi earn 
opening round wins 
Associated Press 
LISBON, Portugal 

Pete Sampras, playing his first match in more than two months, lost 7-5, 6-0 to Lleyton Hewitt on Tuesday in the open­ing round of the Masters Cup. 
Andre Agassi, coming off a three-week break because of a hip injury, was more success­ful. beating Gustavo Kuerten 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
Marat Safin, seeking to become the youngest player ever to finish the year as No. 1, also won his round-robin match Tuesday. rallying past Alex Corretja 6-7 (6), 7-5, 6-3. 
Safin's victory means Sampras no longer holds even a mathematical chance of fin­ishing the year at No. 1, a feat he accomplished a record six straight times from 1993-98. Saffo increased his lead over Kuerten to 95 points. 
An appearance in the final of the $3.7 million event will secure the No. 1 spot for the 20-year-old Russian no matter what Kuerten does. 
Sampras, a five-time champi­on in the season-ending tour­nament, had not played a match since losing to Salin in the final of the U.S. Open in early September. He used the break to get married and 
promised to get into better 
shape. 
He was definitely rusty against Hewitt, dropping his serve to fall behind 6-5 in the first set and not winning another game. Sampras had 32 unforced errors, while Hewitt had only nine and passed Sampras with ease. 
"It definitely wasn't pretty out there," Sampras said. "I don't know if it was a case of not having played for a while. I knew corning into here that I might be a little rusty in the beginning." 
"It's not easy to swallow, los­ing 6-0," said Sampras, who last lost a set at love in 1996, in the semifinals of the French Open to Yevgeny Kafelnikov. 
Hewitt said Sampras, the Wimbledon champion, might have lost a little interest at the end of the second set. 
"Coming off such a big break, Pete wasn't at his best today," said the 19-year-old Australian, who lost to Sampras in the semifinals of the U.S. Open. "I knew it was a big opportunity for me to get a good match under my belt." 
Because of the round-robin format, Sampras can still advance. Every time he won the title, he lost one of his early matches. 
NFL 
Texans consider Miami coach 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON 

Butch Davis, who has the 
Miami Hurricanes in con­
tention for a national champi­
onship, met Tuesday with offi­
cials of the Houston Texans, 
the NFL's newest franchise. 
Davis met with team owner 
Bob McNair and general man­
ager Charley Casserley to dis­
cuss coaching the Texans, an 
expansion franchise to begin 
play in 2002. 
"Butch is a highly qualified coach, who had done an out­standing job at Miami, as he did as an assistant with the Cowboys," McNair said. "He has all the credentials in my view and certainly is well qual­ified to be head coach of the Texans." 
But McNair was quick to add this was just a meeting designed to "get to know each other." 
Davis was traveling back to Miami and unavailable for comment. 
The 49-year-old coach has guided Miami to a 10-1 record this season, his sixth with the Hurricanes. If Oklahoma loses to Kansas State in the Big 12 championship game. Miami will get a rematch with Florida State in the national title game. 
Davis was with Dallas from 1989 to 1995, the last two sea­
"Butch is a highly qualified coach, who had done an outstand­ing job at Miami, as he did as an assistant with the Cowboys. He has all the credentials in my view and certainly is well qualified to be head coach ofthe Texans." 
Bob McNalr 

sons as defensive coordinator. 
McNair praised Davis' coach­ing experience, citing his role in helping former Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson transform the 1-15 club of 1989 into Super Bowl champi­ons after the 1992 and 1993 seasons. McNair also credited Davis with returning Miami's program to dominance despite having the number of scholar­ships he could offer over his first three years on the job cut by 31 because of NCM sanc­tions. 
McNair said such ability in ttie face of adversity is needed in coaching an expansion team. 
"An expansion team is differ­ent than going into an existing situation," he said. "It will be important to be prepared for some adversity because it's 
going to take several years to 
put together a solid team." 
Davis is the first of five to 10 
potential candidates the 
Texans might interview in the 
coming months. The two quali­
fications all candidates must 
have are head coaching expe­
rience and NFL experience, 
McNair said. 
The team might make a deci­sion either in February 2001 or February 2002. Although the Texans would prefer nam­ing a coach in 2002, McNair said he might make a decision sooner if' the situation war­ranted. 
While the meeting with Davis was publicized, the Texans won't always announce who they are meeting with, McNair said. 
Alabama also is interested in having Davis fill its head coaching vacancy. 
Miami athletic director Paul Dee said he has offered Davis an extension to his current contract. which pays him about $900,000 annually and has three years remaining. 
McNair believes Alabama has a good shot at hiring Davis. 
"Certainly Alabama is a great institution and some­thing that is attractive to a number of coaches," he said. "And certainly there will be other opportunities in the NFL."

Associated Press 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. 

Oklahoma's Josh Heupel and Bob Stoops won the Walter Camp player and coach of the year awards Tuesday. 
Heupel, quarterback for the No. 1 Sooners, led the team to an 11 ·0 record. In only his sec­ond year, Stoops took Oklahoma to the top of the national rank­in gs for the first time since 1987. 
It marked only the third time a player and coach from the same school were honored in the same year. 
The winners of the awards. named for the former Yale coach who helped develop the rules of the game, are picked by a national panel of Division I-A coaches and sports information directors. 
Stoops and Heupel will be honored at the Walter Camp 34th national awards banquet on Feb. 10 at the Yale University Commons in New Haven. 
Heupel also was honored Tuesday as The Sporting News' player of the year. The St. Louis-based magazine selected Oregon State's Dennis Erickson as the coach of the year, and Florida receiver Jabar Gaffney as the freshman of the year.

Packers' Dotson ends season with injury 
Associated Press 
Green Bay Packers defensive lineman Santana Dotson's sea­son is over. 
The Packers' locker room leader and pillar of consistency partially tore the quadriceps tendon just above his right knee in the second quarter of Green Bay's loss at Carolina on Monday night. 
General manager Ron Wolf said tests Tuesday revealed that the nine-year veteran needs an operation and an off­season of rehabilitation to be ready for the 2001 season. 
Meanwhile. Brett Favre needs another cast, and not the type he wore on his badly sprained left foot two weeks ago. 
In spite of all his injuries, including tendinitis in his throwing elbow and a perpetu­ally swollen thumb, Favre has regained his form. 
His supporting cast hasn't. 
Last year, a bruised and swollen thumb contributed to a sub-par season in which Favre threw 23 interceptions and failed to lead Green Bay to the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons. 
This year, the trouble is his teammates. 
Favre, who has started an NFL-record 137 consecutive games, is throwing the ball with as much zip as ever. On Monday night, he threw a bul let pass to Donald Driver that traveled 50 yards on a line. 
He's just 107 yards shy of joining Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks ever to pass for 3,000 yards in nine consecutive seasons. 
Favre has even curtailed his gunslinger habits because he recognizes the Packers can no longer atone for his aggressive tendencies through superior talent and depth. 
Departures and injuries have left the Packers a shell of the team that dominated in the late 1990s. The Packers (5-7) now enter games with little or no margin for error.

That's why, Favre said, he can't try to win games by him­self anymore -except in the fourth quarter, when he regu­larly finds himself trying to rally his team from self-inflict­ed damage. 
Nine of Favre's 13 intercep­tions have come in the fourth quarter. 
Despair set in earlier than usual for the Packers in their demoralizing 31-14 loss to Carolina Monday night. 
Green Bay found itself down 14-0 early on to a makeshift Panthers lineup coming in at 4­7. 
"At that point it didn't seem like we could stop them," Favre said. 
The Packers don't seem capable of stopping anybody once they fall behind. 
Besides Favre, they have no playmakers. No Dorsey Levens, no Robert Brooks, no Mark Chmura. no Earl Dotson. 
Favre has two rookie tackles protecting him in Chad Clifton and Mark Tauscher. Rookie tight end Bubba Franks and Ahmau Green, a first-time starter at halfback, are prone to drops and fumbles. 
Coach Mike Sherman, who has preached a return to fun­damental football since replac­ing Ray Rhodes last winter, is particularly piqued by the drops, which have come in bunches of up to a dozen a game. 
Then, there's Antonio Freeman, a colossal disap­pointment since signing a $42 million deal 15 months ago that at the time made him the high­est-paid receiver in the NFL. 
Freeman entered this season intent on avoiding a repeat of last year, when he never got going after a long holdout and finished with 7 4 catches for 1,074 yards and six TDs -a down year by his lofty stan­dards. 
But his numbers are down even more this season. 
Although he has six TDs already, Freeman is averaging just 3.67 catches a game, down from 4.63 a year ago, and his per-game yardage is down from 67 to 54. 
He committed a crucial fum­ble deep in Packers territory Monday night that led to a Carolina touchdown. Two weeks ago, he knocked the ball out of an official's hand for a 15-yard penalty that took the Packers out of field goal range in a close game at Tampa and cost him a $10,000 fine. 
And the defense hasn't been able to offset the offensive blunders. 
The P.a.ckers' top two defend­ers, linebacker Brian Williams and cornerback Mike McKenzie, have hardly been heard from because of injuries.

onto the ball at all costs, their opponents haven't been able to do the same. USC, which wound up 5-7 largely because of its 35 turnovers, including two inter­ceptions and a lost fumble against Notre Dame. 
"We win because other teams turn the ball over," Davie said. "We don't turn the ball over." 
Notre Dame's low number of turnovers has the Irish in BCS contention for the first time in years. 
Leading the error-free play for the Irish is an 18-year-old fresh­man, quarterback Matt Lovecchio. In seven games played as a starter and one as a reserve, he has thrown just one interception. 
That's not a typo. LoVccchio's lone interception came back in mid-October against Navy. 
Because Lovecchio has played in less than 75 percent of Notre Dame's games. he is not eligible for the NCAA record books. 
But if you're interested in a comparison, of the 50 players at the top of the passing list in Division I-A football, the fewest interceptions thrown is four, by Toledo's Tavares Bolden. Heisman candidates Drew Brees of Purdue, Josh Heupel of Oklahoma and Chris Weinke of Florida State have thrown 34 between them. 
Granted, LoVecchio has attempted fewer passes than any of the lleisman candidates (he's 73-for-125). But his passing effi­ciency marks are 151. 70, good enough for seventh best in the nation. 
"The guy gets you into the right play almost every time," Davie said or LoVecchio. "There are a minimal amount of botched plays. He's dropped one snap this year." 
Award-winning Irish 
Linebacker Anthony Denman highlights the football team's list of award-winners this year. 
The leading Notre Dame tack­ler this year with 78, Denman was named a second-team All­American by The Sporting News, while Football News picked him as a third-team All-American and the Independent Player of the Year. The 6-foot-2, 235­pound captain also tops the Irish team with five sacks and 13 tackles for losses. 

Joining Denman on the All­Independent team are tailback Fisher, offensive guard Mike Gandy, defensive end Anthony Weaver, free safety Tony Driver and punter Joey Hildbold. 
In addition, senior receiver and punt returner Joey Getherall has been named the fourth-best returner in the nation by CBS Sportsline. 
"He has some magic to him," Davie said of Getherall. "He is unbelievably productive when he gets his hands on the football." 
Coach of the Year? 
The Irish honors extend beyond the players. · 
Davie is one of three finalists for the Football News 2000 National Coach of the Year Award, along with Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops and former Irish coach and current South Carolina coach Lou Holtz. 
Some Irish fans demanded Davie's head after last year's 5-7 Irish record, not expecting much out of a team that would face five teams that made bowl appearances in '99 in its first five games. Davie pushed the Irish to a 3-2 record through five games, with the losses coming in overtime against then-No. 1 Nebraska and on one botched play in the final two minutes at Michigan State. 
Davie's job got a little tougher after losing starting quarterback Arnaz Battle and captain Grant Irons at defensive end to injuries in the Nebraska game. Yet Lovecchio and Ryan Roberts proved able replacements, and the Irish are 9-2 and looking at a BCS bid. 
Stoops has led the Sooners to a No. 1 ranking, an 11-0 record and a near lock on the Orange Bowl. Holtz has engineered a Gamecocks improvement from a winless season in '99 to 7-4 this year. 
The winner will be announced Wednesday. Dec. 6.

Irish end regular-season play with loss to No. 3 USC 
By RACHAEL PROTZMAN Spons Wrirer 
Notre Dame volleyball built a 2-1 lead in the match against No. 3 USC before falling in the last two games to drop the five game match (5-15, 17-15, 17-15, 7-15, 11-15) on Saturday. 
"USC was a legitimate third in the poll rankings. but our team came out and fought hard for every point," sophomore Keara Coughlin said. "We found ourselves taking games away from them even though our statistics for the match were nut at our usual level." 
After not being able to come back from an 8-2 deficit in the loss of game 
1. the Irish came on strong in game 2 to take a 14-10 lead. Then USC put up a fight, scoring five points to take the lead. Notre Dame hung on for the 17-15 win. 
Freshman Kim Fletcher racked up a career-high 10 kills in the game. 
In game 3 action, the Irish built an 8-3 lead before falling apart to allow the Trojans to take the 13-11 lead. Seniors Christi Girton and Denise Boylan each struck hard with a kill to give the Irish the tie before USC took the lead. With a burst of strength, Notre Dame stole back the lead and the win. 
USC took the early 8-3 lead in game 4 and went on to win as the Irish 
couldn't fight back. 
Game 5 went back and forth between both teams with USC pulling ahead in the end for the win. 
"After losing in five games to a talented team llke USC," Coughlin said. "we were able to leave California itching to get back in the gym for prac­tice this week and then start off our post season at the level at which we have proven we can com­pete." 
Senior Christi Girton led the Irish in their last reg­ular season game with 22 kills and 16 digs while junior Kristy Kreher fol­lowed with 18 kills. Junior Malinda Goralski added 16 kills. 
USC moved to 25-2 on the season with their fourth win over the Irish. Notre Dame has just one win in its history against the Trojans, a 1995 victo­ry. 
Next up for Notre Dame will be the first round in the NCAA tournament where it will face Cincinnati on Friday night. 
"Even before going into the match on Friday," Coughlin said. "we knew that our performance against USC would mean a lot. In the back of our minds, we knew that what we did on Friday would affect our match-up in NCAA as well as our atti­tudes going into the tour­nament."

following that road is not only worth traveling, but it is imperative to travel the road. 
Following a long history of starting off the home season with a losing record, the Belles will start their home stand this Friday with a 3-2 record after coming off a tournament victo­ry at Marietta over Thanksgiving. 
A column I wrote earlier in November described team and fans' hopes that this year would be more successful than last year for the Saint Mary's bas­ketball team. The team's 2-1 record over break surpassed those hopes. at least in the early part of the season. 
In addition to having a win­ning record, the Belles current­ly have an MIM player of the week in sophomore Kristen Matha and hold the leading spots in several MIM cate­gories. Matha holds the No. 1 spot in most rebounds in a game and most blocked shots in a game. Leigh Ann Matesich and Katie Christiansen are tied for the top spot with most assists in a game. 
Why the sudden success? 
If you were to ask head coach Suzanne Smith, she would attribute the success to her team's confidence; she would

Ball control, BCS bid go hand-in-hand 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
Head coach Bob Davie's plan for Notre Dame's running backs to tote the football with them every waking minute in the early season has paid off in the form of a 9-2 record. 
After last year's Irish com­mitted 30 turnovers -15 interceptions and 15 fumbles lost, Davie decided his players needed some extra practice keeping the ball in their hands. 
So he gave Julius Jones, Tony Fisher, Terrance Howard and teammates the order to carry the pigskin everywhere they went, be it practice, class or the dining hall. 
Eleven games later, the Irish rank first in the nation with just eight turnovers. 
Not only is that mark a Notre Dame record, besting the previ­ous mark of 10 set in 1993, it also ties an NCAA record. 
While the Irish have held
