Aquino fires Enrile, cabinet after coup is foiled by army 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -Pres­ident Corazon Aquino fired her entire Cabinet, including con­troversial Defense Minister Juan Enrile, after the army foiled a coup attempt Sunday by dissident officers and politi­cal foes. 
Aquino credited army chief of staff Gen. Fidel Ramos with taking "preventative measures against the reckless-
Sandinistas not against 
Church: VP 
By CHRIS JULKA Copy Editor 
Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez-Mercado said in a lecture Friday that the Sandinistas are not repressing the Catholic Church · in Nicaragua, but that negotia­tions between the Nicaraguan government and the Contras are out of the question. 
Speaking on the topic of "Church and State in Nicaragua," Ramirez identi­fied four "misconceptions" about the relationship of Church and State in Nicaragua. 
"First, it is said that the San­dinista government tried to divide the Church in Nicaragua 
and  to  substitute  it  for  a  
'Popular  Church,' " said  
Ramirez.  

The reality, however, is that many Christians justified the right of the people to take up arms against the Somoza regime and participated in the Sandinista revolution, said Ramirez. "By the time of the revolutionary coup in 1979, the participation of Christians in the armed struggle ... became a key element for the over­throw of the dictatorship. 
"We are not trying in any way to interfere in the internal affairs of the Church. We are not trying to create a parallel structure to the Church. But neither can we stop the partic­ipation of Catholics in the process of the changes in Nicaragua," said Ramirez. 
A second misconception is that the Nicaraguan govern­ment is trying to "silence the Church," said Ramirez. 
"During the last seven years the Catholic Church has been growing in Nicaragua .... Before the (revolution) there were 293 priests in Nicaragua; today, there· are 430," said Ramirez. "Twenty percent of all schools in Nicaragua belong to private religious orders. A Catholic University exists in Nicaragua . . . .

Doubts: learning to deal with them can teach us something 
Doubts, now that I think about it, are posi­
tively negative things to have. 

That may sound odd to hear, but I believe it's true. We shouldn't let a lack of certainty over­come our goals. By the same token, we shouldn't feel inundated by a variety of alter­natives. If I allowed doubt to rule me, I might never have come to Notre Dame. I might never have known the good friends I've made here. 
When I first came to Notre Dame, I had some idea of what to expect. I figured, hey, it's my first college choice. I chose it because it has a really nice campus, a great reputation as an academic institution and its curricula inter­ested me. 
Still, coming here was a new experience for me. I wasn't sure of a lot of things. I thought to myself, "What if my roommate turns out to be a jerk?" or "Will I get along with other guys in the dorm?" These things didn't bother me initially, but the closer I got to coming out here, the more plagued I felt by it all. 
As it turned out, everything went better than I had expected. I really didn't have any expec­tations, other than that I was going to like it at Notre Dame. Yet, alas, I was wrong. I really don't like it here. 
I love it. 

Perhaps I had doubts before coming here, but they were soon dispelled after getting a taste of life under the Dome. Despite the fact I didn't get any information about them, my room­mates, Mike, Marcus and Scott, are great guys. We all get along very well. Come to think of it, our entire section is pretty close knit. 
I admit I had doubts about what life here would be like. Everybody did at some time or other. But instead of giving in to them, I decided to make the best of whatever situation I en­countered. It paid off. 
I'm quite glad I did. In so doing, I met some people from different parts of the country, with different ideas, with different lifestyles, people who are just plain different. Maybe I could've been close minded about it all, but I wasn't. Nobody said it was going to be easy to live in a new atmosphere with people I'd never met. Nonetheless, I tried it and found it's not so bad. 
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have seen the special qualities every person has. If you don't see them, look, they're in there somewhere. I think Father Ted said it's easy to help someone who is popular, good looking, etc. He's right. There are an awful lot (don't take that literally) of other people out there. They're no less impor­tant. 
Thinking back, I can't imagine what life 
Regis Coccia 
Assistant News Editor 

would have been like if I was less tolerant of others. I could've missed out on some of the really fun things our section does. There are a bunch of games we play to let off steam or take our minds off the workload for a bit. We have a weekend ritual of watching "Spinal Tap" or "The Blues Brothers." It's a family-like atmo­sphere. 
I suppose I could've let some minor idiosyncrasy bother me, but I asked myself, "You can live with that, can't you?" More often than not, I found I could. Maybe others have done the same for me. It's the give and take that enables people to stand those with whom they live and work. I'm really glad I gave it a chance. I can only hope others feel the same way. 
I've met some great people at Notre Dame. Before I became a member of the student body, I used to wonder what is so special, so inex­plicably unique about this place. Now that I'm here, it's dawned on me. It's the people. It's us. We make Notre Dame special because we are special people. We make Notre Dame what it is.

IU official found dead in freak hotel accident 

Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -The death of an Indiana University official who was found in a pool of blood in his hotel room here was ruled accidental Sunday, police said. 
The body of John A. Leuthart III, 27, was found in his room at the Marriott Hotel Saturday afternoon by a friend who had come to meet him, said South Bend police spokesman Donald Cornelis. 
Leuthart, the coordinator for student activities at IU­Southeast in New Albany and a Clarksville native, was at­tending the regional workshop for the National Association For Campus Activities at the Century Center in South Bend and had been staying at the hotel, Cornelis said. 
An autopsy performed Sun­day at Memorial Hospital showed that Leuthart had a puncture wound to his throat that had severed the carotid ar­tery and punctured the internal jugular vein causing massive hemorrhaging, Cornelis said. 
Cornelis said investigators speculate that while the victim was showering, he started to slip and grabbed for a ceramic handle on the shower wall to steady himself. 
"But instead the handle broke from the wall and he ac­cidentally hit himself in the throat with the sharp, jagged edge of the handle," Cornelis said. 
He said Leuthart's wound was consistent with the shape of the broken handle, which was found at the bottom of the tub. 
When Leuthart's friend ar­rived at the hotel room to meet him, the victim was found slumped over the bed in a pool of blood with the phone off the hook, Cornelis said. He said there was a trail of blood leading from the bathroom to the spot where the body was found.

"We need the test of time to sift out the erroneous teaching from those which maybe true," she said. Gramick added, "Dis­sent in the Church has helped us to correct erroneous teach­ing." 
According to Gramick, Saint Augustine established the doctrine of anything that was pleasurable had to be justified and procreation was the only justifiable purpose of sexual activity. 
Vatican II, on the other hand, Gramick said, put procreation and love as coequal purposes of sexual union. Gramick said there needs to be further change. 

"We need to broaden our fu­ture. Love needn't be accom­panied by procreation. We must bring that love and bear fruit in the community. 
"We must have dissent in our search for truth. If it's of God, then we trust, we know, it will perdure." 
Gramick said Catholic homosexuals have generally dissented from Church teach­ing. 
"Their response to the offi­cial stance of the Church re­garding homogenital behavior . . . has been one of dissent," Gramick said. 
According to Gramick, the Church teaches that "for homo­sexual individuals, any type of sexual activity, any type of genital behavior is morally wrong." 
"Gay people feel that if celibacy is a gift ... then why is it an absolute rule for every gay person," said Gramick. 
Gay people stay in the Cath­olic Church for many different reasons, according to Gramick. 
"Lesbian and gay Catholics know that the pope and the Roman Curia are not the final arbiters," Gramick said. 
"Each one has a responsibil­ity to follow their own con­science. Catholicism is not really a system of beliefs or laws, it's a shared history of belief in Jesus," she continued.

existed before." He added, "Since the time of the revolu­tion in Nicaragua, 158 religious have been killed in Central America .... Of these 158 re­ligious, not a single one, I repeat, has been murdered in Nicaragua." 
Ramirez justified the ban of the only independent newspa­per in Nicaragua, La Prensa, on the grounds that a "state of emergency" exists in Nicaragua because of the San­dinista war with the Contras. He compared the censorship in­stituted by the Nicaraguan gov­ernment to the censorship practiced by President Lincoln during the American Civil War. 
A third misconception is that "the Sandinista government doesn't want any kind of dialogue with the Catholic hierarchy." said Ramirez. "In fact, the Nicaraguan govern­ment has maintained a consis­tent rapport with the Catholic Church in Nicaragua. Since the new representative from the Vatican arrived to Managua,

Marmel explained that two weeks ago, as part of the plan, he and another UW student had put up about 100 posters around Notre Dame. 
The poster read "Warning. This area has been targeted by the University of Wisconsin­Madison for abuse and public ridicule. 
"All that you hold dear --All that you consider sacred --All that you love --Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! We've always admired your beautiful campus, so now we're just going to take it. 
"And if we destroy it in the process --tough." 
Marmel said the posters were put up as a joke. "We were doing it kiddingly, of course," he said. 
But as they were putting up these posters, Marmel said he and his friend were grabbed by four Notre Dame students "who looked like football players." 
According to Marmel, one of the four students read the pos­ter and said, "Maybe we should teach them a lesson." 
Marmel said he replied, "Well, what about math?" upon which time the four stu­dents roughed them up. 
"We weren't hurt " said Marmel. "We were j~st beat around a little bit." 
Marmel said he and his improved efforts have been made to improve the relations and to define just what these relations ... ought to be." 
The fourth misconception which Ramirez cited is that no free practice of religion is al­lowed in Nicaragua. "We respect the free practice of re­ligion in Nicaragua," Ramirez said. "Catholic practice and Catholic faith is an essential part of our movement, and we are not planning to remove any essential part of it." 
Ramirez said the claim that the Sandinista government has killed approximately 10,000 Mesquito Indians is a "complete lie." He acknowl­edged, however, that "mis­takes" in the Sandinista policy toward the Indians had oc­curred. 
Ramirez also said negotia­tions with the Contras would be unacceptable to the Nicaraguan government. 
"To negotiate with them is useless because they do not represent Nicaraguans," said Ramirez. Because they are funded and supported by the United States, they are nothing more than a form of external aggression, he said. 
friend didn't report the incident to Notre Dame Security, ex­plaining that they didn't want Security to know why they were harassed. 
Returning to the University of Wisconsin, Marmel wrote a column for the Badger Herald, an independent student news­paper with about 24,000 readers. 
Carrying the headline "Clubbed like a baby seal.Notre Dame takes its first licks," the Nov. 13 column recounted the alleged incident involving the four students. Marmel also lambasted Notre Dame students and discussed plans for "The World's Largest Road Trip." 
In the column, Marmel wrote, "We also learned that lack of sex is what causes Notre Dame students to profess such a school spirit. It's really, as Dr. Ruth would say, mis­directed sexual repression." 
Mter discussing the incident involving the Notre Dame stu­dents, Marmel wrote, "Maybe I deserved it. Hell, I'll admit it, I did. 
"However, considering the sheer number of students at UW that are waiting in line to give me a throttle, it seems un­fair that a non-UW . student would have first dibs." 
When the column appeared, Marmel said about 400 students wanted to make the road trip. "Not only were they going to steal your forks, but they wanted to wreck this campus too," he said. 
Ramirez denied the claim made by Contra member Bosco Matamoros that over 40 per­cent of the Contras are former Sandinistas. He said that most of the Contras were members of the National Guard that served under Somoza. 
In a question-and-answer session after the lecture, one questioner, identifying himself as a Nicaraguan, said Ramirez's parents had held positions in the Somoza govern­ment and had made statements which approved of the right­wing regime. Ramirez denied these allegations, calling them "lies," and some members of the audience told the ques­tioner to "sit down" and "shut up." 
Ramirez gave the lecture in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum of Art. He was accompanied in his visit by Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States Carlos Tun­nermann. Their visit was spon­sored by several groups includ­ing the Graduate Association for Latin America and the South Bend Chapter of the Wo­men's International League for Peace and Freedom. 
As a result, Marmel decided to reschedule the road trip. 
"This is a fake war. We're just goofing around," he said. "We don't want anyone hurt." 
Moreover, Marmelsaid, UW students no longer had reason to trade their "threeks" for Notre Dame forks. 
Marmel explained that after students had stolen the 24,000 "threeks," leaving only 600 in the dining halls, school officials wrote a letter to students apologizing for buying the three-pronged forks. They asked students to return the "threeks," promising to buy four-pronged forks in the fu­ture. 
"So there was no reason to actually steal yours," Marmel said. 
Twenty students still made the road trip to Notre Dame, however. 
Marmel said these 20 "generals" were scouting the campus, looking for things to do. When the official road trip is made, the "generals" will be able to show the other students where to go and what to do on the Notre Dame campus. 
Before the road trip, however, Marmel said he wants Notre Dame students to visit the University of Wiscon­sin. Marmel said he plans on arranging the visit through Notre Dame's student govern­ment. 
"When we make our road trip, it will be a fun thing rather than a vengeful thing," he ex­plained. "That's why we want you guys to come up first." 

Prisoners escape using Red Cross helicopter 
Associated Press 
ROME Two gunmen hijacked a Red Cross helicop­ter Sunday, lifted two inmates from a prison courtyard and flew off firing automatic weap­ons at guards, Italian police said. 
A third prisoner dashed toward the helicopter but slipped in the rain. 
The chopper landed a short time later in a Rome soccer field where a match was under way, and hijackers and con­victs fled by car. Police set up roadblocks and searched the region with helicopters. 
Officials said the hijackers spoke French and that one jailbreaker, a Tunisian-born Frenchman, was sought by French authorities in connec­tion with a Paris bank robbery and murder. The other fugitive reportedly was suspected of supplying arms to Italian ter­rorists. 
Police said the hijackers walked into San Camillo Hospi­tal in western Rome and cor­nered the helicopter pilot, 42­year-old Mauro Pompa. 
They handcuffed Pompa's 10-year-old son to a radiator and forced Pompa at gunpoint to take them to the helicopter parked across the street. 
The white helicopter with red crosses painted on the sides then flew across the city to Rebibbia Prison in eastern Rome. There it hovered three feet above the courtyard where about 50 inmates were exercis­ing at 10:45 a.m., Deputy War­den Giancarlo Baldassini told reporters. 
As the hijackers laid down covering gunfire and lowered a rope ladder, two inmates jumped in. 
A guard was slightly injured by flying glass in the shootout, police said. They said two shots fired by a guard hit the helicop­ter. 
The Italian news agency ANSA said the six guards on duty at first thought the helicopter was arriving for a medical emergency. 
A neighborhood soccer game was under way in Rome's Cinecitta area when the helicopter landed on the field, scattering the players. 

Where the need is . . . there we will be. 
As individuals and as a community, we will work toward the alleviation of hunger, misery and the lack of knowledge.

Caring people make Notre Dame special 
I was eating lunch with my friend the other day when suddenly he looked up from his Observer and asked me, "Why does everyone in the paper always rip on Notre Dame? Why can't anyone write anything positive about this place?" 
Tom Varnum 
third and long 

Before I snapped a quick "Because there is nothing positive to write about" reply, I thought for a moment. There has to be something special about this school. Notre Dame is one of the most prestigious schools in the country. Mil­lions worldwide consider themselves "subway" alumni. Less than 20 percent of all Notre Dame applicants are ac­cepted. If this is such a bad school, why do so many try to get in? If they do get in and begin to complain, why do so few people actually transfer? I, myself, have been known to take a few shots at the Dome. I have to ask myself, why did I come here and why am I not trans­ferring? What makes Notre Dame spe­cial to me? 
Well, in the first place, I went to col­lege to get an education. And at Notre Dame, as the ad for the fine Wisconsin pilsner says, "It don't get no better than this." The value of a Notre Dame edu­cation cannot be measured with dollars and cents. By requiring students to study a little from all disciplines, Notre Dame lays the foundation upon which all future knowledge will be built. When you get right down to it, Notre Dame offers excellent education; and that's what we all came here for in the first place, isn't it? 
Integrity is another facet of Notre Dame we take for granted. I am not simply referring to the Catholic morals. I mean honesty and hard work. Our ath­letic programs offer a fine example. While many other schools with similar programs sacrifice honesty and hard work to further their athletics, Notre Dame does not. Notre Dame combines athletic excellence with academic in­tegrity. While scandals involving drugs, cheating and payoffs rock many universities nationwide, Notre Dame remains clean yet competitive. Maybe we should take pride in a school with integrity instead of complaining about its food or weather. 
Tradition also makes Notre Dame special. It may sound corny now, but just wait until you leave here. When you tell people you went to Notre Dame, most (especially alumni) will instantly perk up. Although they will probably ask you about the football team ini­tially, bear with them and they will open up many new doors. I am sure you have experienced some of this ef­fect already. When you go home on break and people discover or remem­ber you go to Notre Dame, you usually get instant attention. People know Notre Dame and, whether for football or academics, they respect and admire it. It may be difficult to think of these benefits now; but, in the long run, they just may make you forget about the alcohol policy. 

The most obvious yet most over­looked asset of Notre Dame is our campus. Simply put, it is beautiful. From the vibrant color of fall to the sparkling white of winter to the lush green of spring, our campus shines. From the old-style architecture (I try to avoid Decio as much as possible) to the historic monuments, the campus breathes beauty. I have seen some Ivy League schools that would be happy to call North Quad their "campus green". The overwhelming beauty of the Notre Dame campus radiates all year long. 
Certainly education, integrity, tradi­tion and beauty all contribute to the Notre Dame experience, but all these can be found elsewhere. There are many schools across the country which meet these four requirements. Someth­ing here, though, makes Notre Dame special. In my eyes, only one thing separates Notre Dame from others: its people. 
Notre Dame people are in a class by themselves. That's what makes it dif­ferent. Notre Dame people care. They care about each other as well as those less fortunate than themselves. Maybe this is part of our Catholic background, I'm not sure. All I know is Notre Dame students go out of their way to help others. Even those of us who tend to complain about Notre Dame are just trying to improve our school. We do 
P.O. Box Q 
Snowball fight causes danger to everyone 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to comment on something I witnessed Tuesday evening. As most of us in the North Quad are aware, there was a "snowball fight" involving quite a large number of our students. Previ­ous to Tuesday evening, I was under the impression that Notre Dame stu­dents possessed above-average intelli­gence; however, I am now beginning to question my own perceptions. Is it possible that our students do not realize the danger of throwing a snowball? I learned of it in grammar school when 
Doonesbury 
one of my classmates was killed be­cause his "friends" hit him in the head with a tightly packed snowball. 
I would also like to say something to the person who broke my window with a snowball. Did you ever consider that flying glass can oftentimes do ir­reparable damage should it hit some­one? I am thankful that nobody hap­pened to be sitting by that window when your snowball came flying into my living room. 
It is unfortunate that such behavior will not cease until someone is badly injured or even killed. I can only hope and pray that our students begin to reflect upon their behavior and realize that such action is more befitting children under the age of ten than it is students who are supposedly adults.

Contributions of time helped out many 
Dear Editor: 

Last weekend Grace Hall had its third annual 24-hour run for charity. It came off as a big success as we raised over $400 for the Northeast Neighbor­hood Service Center. However, none of this would have been possible without the help of many people. 
First, thanks so much to our spon­sors: Ernst & Whinney, Colonial Pan-
Garry Trudeau 
Jove our school; and, therefore try to make it a better place. 
The "Notre Dame Family" as it is called, may not seem obvious to you, but it is there. It is there at every foot­ball game, every Mass and every group of friends that get together to have a good time. You cannot tell me the stu­dent support for Kevin Hurley wasn't special. For a moment try to forget about the social life, food, weather, al­cohol policy and everything else you don't like here and realize that we are all in it together. Above all, when I think of Notre Dame, I think of a group of people who care. 
A faculty member I know here has a very peculiar habit. Every once in a while he will say "NOTRE DAME, NOTRE DAME" for no apparent rea­son. When I first met him, I thought this was quite strange. But now, I think I understand him. In the push and shove of our busy schedules, it is very easy to ignore the good here and concentrate on the bad. Every once in a while, we need to be reminded of the good here at Notre Dame. The next time you are overwhelmed by ethanol or repulsed by the food or bored silly by the social life, take a deep breath (or a shallow one if ethanol is the problem) and say to your­self, "NOTRE DAME, NOTRE DAME".

cake House, Jamison Inn, Varsity Shop, Coral Nissan, and City Awning of South Bend. Their contributions helped to cover expenses and are greatly appre­ciated. 
Thanks must be given to the 96 run­ners from Grace Hall. We appreciate your time and effort, guys; I hope it was worth your while. 
Lastly, thanks to all those who served on the organizational committee and helped man the tent. Chris Simms, Glenn Hegewald, Tom Brennan, Rick Ehrman, Jeff Elia, Tom Kelly and several others made the event a great success.

LUCY BARAQUIO features writer 
It's a Sunday afternoon, and you're going to the library to finish up some last-minute re­search. On your way over, you pass an unfamiliar sight: a crowd Is gathering at the Clarke Memorial Fountain. Taking a closer look out ofsheer curiosity, you find at the center of this crowd several regular-looking guys throwing various objects Into the air and catching them in a rhythmic circular pattern. 
What is this, you wonder? An Interesting commercial gimmick to draw attention to the new memorial? A low-budget travel­ing circus? A Gulnness Book world record attempt? Actually, no. It is none other than the Notre Dame Juggling Club, hold­ing one of It's weekly sessions out on the quad. 
You may wonder why you've never noticed this before. Per­haps It is because the club has only been in existence for a short time. Seniors Dave Zoretic and Bill Lane and sophomore Pat Dunne put the club together at the beginning of this semester, and they've been providing a di­version for passersby In the North Quad ever since. 
The idea of forming a juggling club on campus was conceived when Lane and Zoretic, who have been juggling since freshman year, performed ajuggling act at the Zahm Invitational Talent Show (ZITS) last year and met with extremely favorable audi­ence response. 
"People obviously likejuggling acts," said Zoretic. "So we

 features writer 

From memo boards with uni­corns and butterflies to Far Side paraphernalia, the doors of many campus rooms are full of interesting tidbits. What better way to express a thought or add some pizazz to a generic looking room than with a few door decorations? 
Annette Scalise, Kathleen Pearl and Aimee Gottllck of LeMans Hall are prime examples. Their door is full of favorite quotes and comments like, "I think I'm going to have my teeth shaved so they're all the same length." Or the old classic, "Onomatopea... we always re­member that word." The door provides a great way to remem­ber good times and enjoy the hilarious things that people say everyday. According to Scalise, "Our door is the result of four years of fun." 
A quick look at any door can sometimes yield information about the people within. Barbra Giannicchi's door is filled with postcards and souvenirs from her year in Rome. "My experi­ences abroad are an Important part of my life. I would rather show some of the highlights in a place where people can see them instead of tucked away in a photo album," says Giannicchi. 
thought it might be a. good idea 
to form a club." 
They placed an ad In The Ob­server asking If anyone was in­terested in such an endeavor. When this also drew a favorable response, they flied an applica­tion with the Student Activities Board and were granted permis­sion to form the Notre Dame Jug­gling Club. 
Over 1 00 people expressed in­terest in membership at their booth on Activities Night in Sep­tember, and the group now has at least 25 members who come out either Thursday at 6 p.m. or Sunday at 1 p.m. to juggle. 
"Everyone in the group can juggle at least three juggling balls," said Lane. "We also juggle things like pins, rings, bean bags, 'devil sticks' and tennis balls." 
The club dues were spent on this type ofjuggling equipment. Club members are currently working on two, three and four­man team patterns for variety, and one member Is now working on perfecting his unicycle act. 
According to Dunne, learning the skill is not that difficult. Some can pick up the basic pattern in 10 minutes, while some may take an hour. The most Impor­tant qualities needed to be a good juggler, says Dunne, are general eye-hand coordination and the ability to make each suc­cessive throw identical. "A little bit of luck wouldn't hurt either," he added. 
The group juggles mostly for personal enjoyment, but they also appreciate the attention of spectators who pass by on their 

Some Stanford Hall residents take another approach to the art of door decorating. According to Pat Muetilberger, "Doors are for Doors albums." Muehl berger ex­presses his admiration for The Doors by placing his favorite al­bums on his door and by periodi­cally shouting. "Jim lives" out of his window. 
Of course, Christmas is the peak of the door-decorating season. Everyone pulls out the wrapping paper, ribbons and snow flakes around this time of year.

With the coverage this branch gives the campuses, there really is no need to worry if an emergency situation arises.

PORTLAND, Ore.-Kiki Van­deweghe scored 23 points, in­cluding three long-range bas­kets during a fourth-quarter Portland surge, as the Trail Blazers downed Indiana 108-95 last night to spoil the return to Memorial Coliseum of Pacers Coach Jack Ramsay. 
Ramsay, who coached the Trail Blazers for 10 years before he was fired after last season, received a standing ovation from the Portland crowd before the game. 
But the Blazers, who have won seven of their last nine NBA games to climb above the .500 mark for the first time this season, weren't as kind to the Pacers.

Close loss builds Irish frustrations as big victory proves elusive again 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
BATON ROUGE, La. Although it's not much in the way of consolation, Notre Dame certainly has given the national-television people some down-to-the-wire football games this season. 
And while that's just fine for the ratings, you have to wonder when the Irish are going to come out on top in one of these thrillers. Saturday's 21-19 loss to LSU had Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz doing just that -wondering. 
"Unbelievable," said Holtz, who was sitting on a table just outside the visitors' locker room talking to reporters. "You've got to be kidding me. Those are my two favorite ex­pressions. Unbelievable and you've got to be kidding me." 
The Tigers were not kidding, however. Time after time they came up with the big play to thwart the second-half com­eback efforts, and caused this game to look like all but one of the other five Notre Dame losses this season. 
In games against Michigan (24-23), Michigan State (20-15), Pittsburgh (10-9) and last week against Penn State (24-19), the Irish have managed rallies late in the contest only to fall just short in the end. Take out a 28­10 loss at the hands of Ala­bama, and 4-6 Notre Dame has dropped five games by a grand total of 14 points -and all be­cause it could not come up with the big play to finish on top. 
"It's particularly frustrating this year," said tight end Joel Williams, who had the potential-winning touchdown pass jarred from his hands against the Nittany Lions last week, and saw a potential tying pass sail past his fingertips as he tried to stay in bounds on a two-point conversion attempt late in Saturday's game. "We've been losing all the close ones and winning all the blowouts. The frustration tends to add up. These are tough ones to lose." 

LSU outside linebacker Ron Sancho pressured Irish back­up quarterback Terry Andrysiak on the play, with 
3:32 on the clock, forcing him to hurry the throw. 
"It just goes to show that, with the schedule we play, you have to be at your best every week," said Williams. "You come out of a great game like last week's and it's almost a false high because you think you can play at the same level. It took us until the second half to get fired up." 
Right when the Irish flame was finally burning, however, a tenacious, hard-hitting LSU defense stamped it out and turned the game back in the Tiger's favor -on more than one occasion. 
With the chance to take their first and only lead of the game late in the third quarter, the Irish got a break as Steve Lawrence returned an inter­ception to the LSU two-yard line to set up a first-and-goal situation. 
Fullback Pernell Taylor pounded into the line twice to move the ball inches from the goal line, and an Anthony Johnson leap was met by inside linebacker Toby Caston on third down. On fourth-and-goal from the one, senior safety Steve Rehage read the play, shed a blocker and wrapped up Irish flanker Tim Brown for a four-yard loss. 
John Carney nailed a 49-yard field goal into a slight wind late in the first half, apparently pul­ling Notre Dame to within four at 14-10. But the officials sig­naled LSU on an offside call before the snap, and Carney's 44-yard try on the ensuing play was wide to the left. 
"Isn't that amazing?" asked Holtz with a smile. "Two straight times we've come oh­so close. This is getting ridiculous. These things really exhaust you. I know how it is on me. It's getting incredible." 
"We couldn't take advantage of our chances and that's just all-too-familiar," said senior quarterback Steve Beuerlein. "They say when you pay your dues, sometime it's going to go your way. I'm just wondering when it's going to even up. 
"For the seniors, they keep saying it will help us in the fu­ture -make us better people. But I'd rather be a little worse of a person and have a few more wins."

It appeared the Irish would enter the dressing room only down by four after the slow of­fensive showing in the first half, as Carney booted a 49­yard field goal into the wind with less than a minute left. LSU had gone offside before the snap, however, and Carney was wide on the subsequent 44­yarder.

The Obs~erve~like Maureen Shea dives for a loose ball in Notre Irish then fell to Purdue on Saturday. Brian 0' Dame's victory against Northern Illinois. The Gara has the rundown in his story below. 
Irish volleyball winds up big year with a win and error-filled defeat 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
It has been a Cinderella-like season for the Notre Dame vol­leyball team. The Irish, who finished last season with a 12-19 record, ended 33-7 this fall while breaking several school records. The ball continued Friday against Northern Illi­nois, but the clock struck mid­night Saturday as the Irish dropped their season finale in a heartbreaking loss to Purdue, 10-15, 15-11, 9-15, 14-16. 
The Irish played their final home match Friday afternoon and proceeded to record their 20th three-game sweep of an opponent, rolling over Nor­thern Illinois 15-6, 15-7, 15-6. This was the final home match for seniors Mollie Merchant and Karen Sapp, both four-year monogram winners. 
Notre Dame took the eve­ning's first game with near­flawless execution and a strong performance by sophomore Zanette Bennett. Bennett broke an early 3-3 tie with a block, then proceeded to add two kills and a service ace in an Irish run that resulted in a 15-6 vic­tory. 
Game two began in the same manner, with the two teams battling to a 6-6 tie. Freshman Kathy Cunningham broke the tie with a kill, then made an outstanding dig off a Northern Illinois spike that led to a Ben­nett kill and an 8-6 Irish lead. The Irish then put up a strong defensive effort at the net with blocks by sophomores Mary Kay Waller and Maureen Shea, and Bennett put the game away with another kill for a 15-7 Irish win. 
The Irish completed the rout with a strong team perfor­mance in game three. Bennett and Shea scored two kills each as the Irish jumped out to 7-3 lead, then pulled away for a 15­6 win and a three game sweep of the match. 
The Irish knew a victory would not be so easy Saturday as they traveled to Purdue to face a hungry Boilermaker team which defeated Notre Dame handily in September. 
The Irish jumped out to a quick 9-1 lead with the hustle and determination of a team looking for a bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Irish frontline played tenacious defense at the net while fresh­man setter Taryn Collins set the Irish hitters Waller, Shea and Kathleen Morin. 
A timely Purdue time-out brought the fun and games to an end, however, as the Boiler­makers regrouped to battle back and tie the score at 10-10. A key first game win had suddely turned into a tie, and Purdue maintained their mo­mentum over the frustrated Irish to pull it out, 15-10. 
The two teams traded the lead back and forth in game two as they battled to a 7-7 tie. Enter sophomore Whitney Shewman off the Irish bench. Shewman quickly recorded four kills and a solo block to lead the Irish to a 15-11 victory. 
In the pivotal third game of the evening, Purdue denied the Irish any chance for momen­tum by jumping out to a 4-0 lead. Collins finally ended the Boilermaker run with a quick dump over the net and then combined with Waller for two blocks as the Irish tied the score 4-4. But the Boilermakers stiffened its defense and found several holes in the slow­reacting Irish defense to run away with a 15-9 win and take a 2-1lead in games. 
With their backs to the wall, the Irish battled Purdue to a 7-7 tie behind Shewman's kills and two service aces by Cun­ningham. The two teams traded point-for-point to a 13-13 tie before Shewman tipped a kill past the Boilermakers at the net to bring the Irish one point from tying the match and forcing a fifth game. But the Irish failed to score the elusive 15th point, and put two kills into the net as the Boilermakers came back to close the door, winning 16-14. 
Irish Coach Art Lambert 
summed up the loss, the first 
for the Irish since October 22, 
in two words. 
"Unforced Errors." 
"We had thirteen reception errors off their serves. That's 13 points. You can't give up 13 points and beat a team like Purdue," said Lambert. 

Not so coincidentally, the Irish lost the three games by a total of, you guessed it, thirteen points. 
"There's no question we could have won," said Lam­bert. "We just gave it to them. If you play well and lose there is nothing you can do. We didn't play well. A loss is a loss but you hate to lose that way. But we've had a superb season. Nobody has to hang their head." 
Shewman led the Irish against Purdue with a season­high 15 kills for a .542 percentage. Shea added 11 kills to the Irish offensive effort.

NFL roundup 
Bears squeak past Pack 
Associated Press 
Not even the return of Jim McMahon could get the Chicago Bears' offense un­tracked. 
The starting quarterback for the NFL champions returned to the lineup yesterday after mis­sing more than a month with a shoulder injury. Still, the Bears barely squeaked past the last­place Green Bay Packers 12-10 in a vicious renewal of their NFC central rivalry. 
Kevin Butler's 32-yard field with 2: 37 to play lifted Chicago, 10-2, in the 133rd meeting be­tween the teams. McMahon completed just 12 of 33 passes for 95 yards and was inter­cepted three times as he won his 23rd consecutive start. He rushed six times for 64 yards and was replaced in the fourth quarter by Mike Tomczak. 
The Bears fell behind 10-9 when Ed West beat safety Dave Duerson for a 46-yard touch­down pass from Randy Wright with 7:49 remaining. But Duer­son recovered a fumble by Gary Ellerson at the Green Bay 34 and Walter Payton carried three times to move Chicago to the 14-yard line, setting up the winning field goal. 
Butler had missed his previ­ous four field goal tries. 
Payton carried 17 times for 85 yards for the Bears, who have scored only 85 points in their last six games. 
The Bears' defense ac­counted for nine points. Dennis Gentry recovered a punt blocked by Shaun Gayle in the end zone for a touchdown in the second quarter, shortly after Green Bay's Charles Martin had flagrantly roughed . McMahon. Martin was ejected from the game. 
"I've been the victim of a lot of late hits but nothing that bla­tant," McMahon said. 
"That's an individual doing that. I don't think they coach it," said Bears Coach Mike Ditka, adding, "There are few

teams I'd rather beat more than Green Bay." 
Earlier, with Chicago at the Packers' 1, William "The Refrigerator" Perry fumbled and John Dorsey recovered for the Packers. Three plays later, Dan Hampton nailed Ken Davis in the end zone for a safety and a 2-0 Chicago lead. 
Browns 37, Steelers 31 
Bernie Kosar hit rookie Webster Slaughter with a 36­yard touchdown pass with 8: 23 left in overtime as the Browns completed their first sweep of the Steelers since 1969. 
Kosar finished with 28 com­pletions in 46 attempts for 414 yards and two touchdowns, sur­passing his career best of 401 yards achieved two weeks ear­lier against Miami. 
Cleveland, 8-4, remained tied with Cincinnati for first place in the AFC central. The loss mathematically eliminated Pittsburgh, 4-8, from the divi­sionrace. 
Giants 19, Broncos 16 
The Giants also won late in a game for the second straight week, thanks again to placekicker Raul Allegre. With six seconds left, Allegre kicked his fourth field goal of the game, a 34-yarder. Last week, he beat Minnesota with a field goal in the final seconds. 
Cardinals 23, Chiefs 14 
Neil Lomax, back from a two-week benching, passed for three touchdowns, to to J.T. smith and one to Roy Green. Lomax, who was replaced by Cliff Stoudt for the last two games, hit Green for a 5-yard score, and connected on 25-and 4-yard passes to Smith in the second half. 
Kansas City fell to 7-5, severely damaging its playoff hopes.

Tyson gains respect in Berbick KO but Spinks not convinced of ability 
Associated Press 
LAS Vegas, Nev. -Mike 
Tyson became a heavyweight 
champion to rave reviews, but 
there were some reservations. 
"I think he will be a very great champion," Trevor Ber­bick said after Tyson scored a sensational second-round knockout over him Saturday night to win the World Boxing Council title. "I think he has a very good chance to be the un­disputed champion.'' 
One thing is certain, the onetime juvenile delinquent is the star of a division in need of a personality. 
The 20-year-old Tyson, the youngest-ever heavyweight champion, is next scheduled to fight at Las Vegas on March 6 against the winner of Tim With­erspoon's Wprld Boxing Asso­ciation title defense against Tony Tubbs Dec. 12 at New York. 
Trainer Angelo Dundee, who worked in Berbick's corner, feels either Witherspoon or Tubbs has the style to beat Tyson. Both are strong and good defensive fighters. 
"Anybody can hit somebody who's not hitting back," said Michael Spinks, the Interna­tional Boxing Federation 
~~0 

~ 
t::Jv; 
champion, who was at ringside at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
Berbick threw 38 punches and landed 13. Tyson was credited with 106 punches and 59 hits. 
Under the format of the HBO television series of heavyweight title fights, Spinks is scheduled to fight the winner of the Tyson-WBA championship match. 
That is supposed to be Spinks' next fight. But Butch Lewis, the promoter who has guided Spinks' career, strongly indicated it won't be. 
"I'm going to do what's best for Michael," said Lewis, who is co-promoting the HBO series with Don King. "I'm not going to allow other fighters to stay active while Michael stays dor­mant." 
The IBF has said Spinks must make a mandatory defense against Tony Tucker in January. Such a fight would be outside the series. 
But Lewis said Spinks will not fight Tucker next. 
"If I'm going to take a fight outside the series, it's going to be meaningful and lucrative," he stated. 
Asked if he was thinking of a Spinks-Gerry Cooney fight, Lewis said, "Possibly, yes. I'm

going to be on top of it, begin­ning Monday. " 
Dennis Rappaport, Cooney's manager, said Sunday by tele­phone from New York that he would welcome such a fight. 
Cooney is supposed to fight Dec. 26 at Atlantic City, N.J., in what would be his first bout since May, but Rappaport said, "There's a good chance it won't take place." 
William "The Bayou Moose" Thomas, who was supposed to the opponent, has increased his purse demands and another op­ponent must be found. 
Tyson's victory climaxed a whirlwind schedule of 28 fights in a little less than 21 months. 
The street-tough youngster from Brooklyn, N.Y., was put on the road to the title by the late boxing teacher, Cus D'Amato, who had guided the careers of Floyd Patterson, the previous youngest heavyweight champion, and Jose Torres, a former light heavyweight champion. 
Tyson was introduced to D' Amato at age 13 when he was an inmate at a school for boys in upstate New York. D'Amato watched Tyson spar and told him that if he listened and worked hard he would be a champion.

Anchorage is chosen to host 1994 Olympics 
Associated Press 
SPARKS, Nev. -The U.S. 
Olympic Committee voted 
overwhelmingly yesterday to 
make Anchorage, Alaska, its 
representative to host the 1994 
Winter Olympics. 
The USOC's 86-member Ex­
ecutive Board also approved 
Colorado Springs, Colo., as the 
site of an Olympic Hall of 
Fame, and approved Okla­
homa City as the location for 
the 1989 U,S. Olympic Festival. 
USOC president Robert Hel­mick said the main reason for supporting Anchorage as the 
U.S. bid city for the 1994 Winter Games was that other Ameri­can cities -including Reno, Nev. -wouldn't have enough time to make an adequate presentation to the Interna­tional Olympic Committee. 
The IOC is expected to make its decision on the 1994 Winter Olympics location during the 1988 Summer Games at Seoul, South Korea. All bids must be

submitted to the IOC by next April. 
Helmick's argument of in­adequate time for other U.S. cities to submit bids was ques­tioned by Bruce Bogaert, head of the Reno-Tahoe Winter Games Organizing Committee. 
"I think they should have given every city in the U.S. an opportunity to bid if they wanted," Bogaert said. But he said the Reno-Tahoe area would continue to bid for future Olympic games. 
Other communities that ex­pressed interest in hosting the Games included Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Lake Placid, N.Y., and Denver. 
Anchorage was chosen over several cities in the battle for the 1992 U.S. bid, but the IOC last month selected Albertville, France, to host those Games. 
Rick Mystrom of the Anchorage organizing commit­tee for the Games, said the city has spent $3 million in seeking the Winter Olympics and will spend nearly that much over the next two years. 
Mystrom also said Alaska "will begin a very intensive lobbying process" to get a fa­vorable IOC vote. He said Anchorage has a good chance because it will be the first for­mal applicant for the 1994 Games.

Kempton, Barlow and Dolan to get the rebounds. We're going to have to realize that they're not here anymore, and that we're going to have to work harder to get them." 
The Irish made an early rush at the Hilltoppers in the second half and closed to within 54-44 on a Donald Royal turnaround jump shot with 11:56 to go. But a key· offensive foul call on Royal (throwing an elbow on a rebound) forced him to the bench with four fouls with 11: 24 left and seemed to take the wind out of the Irish sails. 
Frank hit two shots for the Hilltoppers to stretch the lead to 14 points, and Western Ken­tucky never looked back on its way to a big victory. 
"We just didn't have inten­sity," said Royal, who led the Irish with 17 points and seven rebounds but was not at all happy with his performance. 

Associated Press 
Memphis State, scandalized by the federal indictment of its former coach and by NCAA probation, moves into the quar­terfinals of the early-season National Invitation Tournament on Monday night after a stunning first-round up­set. 
The unranked Tigers beat 20th-ranked Cleveland State 70­66 Saturday night at Memphis to reach the round of eight, against Michigan. 
The big quarterfinal matchup has seventh-ranked Oklahoma at No. 5 Nevada-Las Vegas. The other games are Temple at Villanova and Texas Christian at highly regarded Western Kentucky. 
Memphis State, already stunned by NCAA probation to both its basketball and football programs, received further bad news last Thursday when former basketball coach Dana Kirk was named in an 11-count indictment. Memphis State fired Kirk in September. 
Both the Tigers' football and basketball teams are banned from postseason action this season. 
The NIT, traditionally a postseason tournament, is holding its early-season event for the second time. 
Vincent Askew scored 20 points and had 11 rebounds, leading Memphis State's upset of Cleveland State. 
Memphis State led 65-56 with four minutes left, but Cleveland State cut the deficit to 67-64 in the next minute. 
Larry Finch, who replaced Kirk as the Tigers' coach, gave part of the credit for the victory 71-61 to earn their quarterfinal berths. Texas Christian beat Louisiana State 83-74. 
Nate Blackwell had 24 points for Temple, which won its opening game of the season for the 34th straight year. The loss snapped a 49-game home win­ning streak for Virginia. Doug West scored 18 for Villanova, which scored 17 of the first 19 points in the second half to break away from a 49-49 tie. 
Carven Holcombe scored 20 points and led a 23-2 first-half spurt that led Texas Christian over LSU, a Final Four team last season with only one re­turning starter. 
The semifinals will be played in Madison Square Garden at

"Maybe that was because of a lack of experience, but we're going to have to start con­centrating and working harder." 
"We didn't do anyting well tonight," said Rivers. "I take full responsibility for that since I am the point guard. But we'll just have to come back to the gym, look at the films and see where we broke down. There's a lot of room for improvement, but there's also a lot of time to improve." 
Hilltopper head coach Mur­ray Arnold, in his first year at Western Kentucky, was very satisfied with the big win. 
"It's a great win for Western Kentucky," he said. "I couldn't be prouder of the kids. They played with a lot of effort. To be able to control the tempo against a very intelligient Notre Dame taem and still beat them up and down the floor and on the boards is very satisfy­ing." 
Phelps, meanwhile, looked to use the poor performance as a stepping stone to brighter showings.
