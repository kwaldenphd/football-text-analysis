Two speakers have been addedto this year's Mock Convention, scheduled for April 4-7. Sponsors of the quadrennial event say they are renewing efforts to bring one or more of the Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination to the convention floor. Former U.S. Representative Ron Mottle, of Ohio, a Notre Dame alumnus, will address delegates and guests on April 4, and Representative Corine "Lindy" Boggs of Loui­siana's second district will speak at the April 5 session. She has been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate at the na­tional convention. Others to speak at the Stepan Center event are Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president; Rep. Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky, and Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt, both Notre Dame parents. -The Observer 
An improved job market awaits 1984 graduates, according to two major placement studies. The Michigan State University Recruiting Trends Survey says hiring quotas are up 5 percent, while Northwestern University's report is even more op­timistic, predicting a 20 percent jump in jobs, with 30 percent more 
for masters' graduates. "The recession has bottomed out," says MSU's Jack Shingleton. "But this is a very gradual increase." That may be true in some areas, but Stanford University reports its · campus recruiting is "booming," with almost twice as many winter quarter job interviews scheduled this year over last year. -The Observer 
Curt Milhaupt, a senior majoring in Government and International Studies at Notre Dame, has been selected as reci­pient of the Japanese Government (Mombusho) Scholarship for 1984. Ellen Ryan, a Saint Mary's senior, has been selected as an alternate recipient. Thirty-five students of Japanese took the three hour language examination last October. The two students were among seven who qualified from this region and whose names were sent to Tokyo. The scholarship entitles the recipient to study as a research student at a Japanese university designated by the Japanese Ministry of Education. The student receives free transportation to and from Japan, and a monthly allowance fo about $730 and tuition. Milhaupt is the sixth student from the University of Notre Dame to receive this award. Last year's reci­pient, Fredrick Dickinson, also a government major, is attending Kyoto University. -The Observer 
Indiana Governor Bob Orr yesterday unveiled plans for a state-wide comprehensive public information program with the theme, "Sobering Advice Can Save a Life." The cam­paign, designed by the Governor's Task Force to Reduce Drunk Driving, is being funded by a $1.2 million federal grant awarded to Indiana from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administra­tion. The funds will be used to Slli'POr! public information and education programs as well as law enforcement and rehabilitative efforts, all aimed at reducing drunk driving. "In the effort to reduce alcohol-related fatalities in Indiana, we are initiating a positive, up-beat program that encourages individual responsibili­ty in solving this problem," said Stephen Goldsmith, chairman of the task force. -The Observer

Hart leads Mock Convention Poll 
By JOHN McGREEVY 
News Staff 

Although most of the attention surrounding yester­day's elections involved class officer races, there was another ballot before Notre Dame students. 
Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart won a decisive victory in a straw poll set up by the Mock Convention to give students the chance to name their favorite candidate in the Democratic presidential con­test. 
Hart gained 41.4 percent of the vote, finishing well ahead of Walter Mondale's 16.2 percent. Senator John Glenn finished closely behind Mondale with 15.2 percent. Fellow Democrat Reuben Askew pulled a sur­prising fourth place finish with 10.4 percent. Other candidates were Jesse Jackson, 9.8 percent; George McGovern, 3.2 percent; Ernest Hollings, 2 percent; and Alan Cranston, 1.7 percent. 
"This poll is not binding on the delegates," em­phasized Mock Convention Chairman Tom O'Leary, "we just thought it would be interesting to see who the students prefer at this point." 
A long-standing Notre Dame tradition, the Mock Convention parallels the national convention of the party currently out of power. It will be held April 4-7 this year. 
Although a recent Observer/Mock Convention poll had Walter Mondale in the lead. O'Leary had con­
sidered  today's  poll  a  toss-up.  All  announced  
Democratic  candidates  including  those  who  have  
dropped out, were on the ballot.  

Republican and independent students were also en­couraged to register their preference in the poll. The poll was supervised by the Mock Convention and the

Reagan's loan request denied 
Dear Ronald Reagan: 
As you know, we have written you previously about your past due deficit and have yet to get a satisfactory response. This is our final letter. We know your credit rating is important to you and so we are tak­ing this opportunity to review your financial

situation. Immediate attention to this pro­blem is required or we will have to take fur­ther action. 
When you first contacted this office in 1980, you said you would be able to lower taxes, increase defense spending and balance the budget. This office had grave doubts about your plan, but we allowed you to pro­ceed because your business is important to us. 
But Mr. Ronald Reagan, you have not been able to balance the budget. According to our figures, your budget will be short $200 billion by the end of fiscal 1985. If this sum is added to previous deficits, we are talking of a debt approaching a trillion dollars. Mr. Ronald Reagan, we value your business, but 
you have done nothing to bring your budget into balance. 
Mr. Ronald Reagan, in 1980 you said you would balance the budget. Every year since, you have made the same claim. Not only did you fail to balance the budget as promised, bu also the budget you recently submitted to this office shows an additional deficit. As usual, you say you will attend to this pro­blem next year. 
Mr. Ronald Reagan, we have been very patient with you, but look at what you have done. The government has to borrow its funds somewhere and it will be competing with others for the limited money available. This either will keep interest rates at the cur­rent high level, or increase them further. As you know the cost of borrowing money (interest rates) is reflected in t he price of almost everything -from new cars to new houses. 
But additionally, Mr. Ronald Reagan, a perusal of your statements indicates that you do not know what you are doing. We are sorry for being so blunt, but this office has gone over your books and discovered that you are now sp. ending more on interest payments than you have cut from social pro­grams for the poor. In other words, what you have taken from poor people you are now giving to bankers and rich foreign in­vestors. 
This office also has concluded, Mr. Ronald Reagan, that high interest rates and the prospect that they will go even higher have attracted a lot of foreign money to this country. We need not tell you that this is not good. 
The result is that the dollar has increased in value, meaning cheap meals for a privileg­ed few in Paris, but -more important -a higher cost for American exports. This means that American fir ms that do business abroad are being priced out of the market. At the same time, foreign firms now are able to sell here more cheaply. This accounted for a $60.6-billion trade deficit in 1983 and a projected deficit of $100 billion for 1984. 
Mr. Ronald Reagan, we have written to you repeatedly about these matters and all we get back is promises that the budget will be balanced -but the promise always is for next year. 
This is unacceptable to us. While normally we refrain from telling clients how to con­duct their business, it seems obvious to us that you cannot continue both to spend the way you have on defense and also permit the rich to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Your figures indicate that the rich enjoyed the major share of your tax reductions. A lit­tle corporate tax would not hurt, either. 
In the end, Mr. Ronald Reagan, these choices are up to you. But we cannot con­tinue to finance your debt or continue to rely on your promises that next year you will balance the budget. This, then, is your final warning. You have refused to respond ade­quately to previous letters. Therefore, we must inform you that your request for another $200 billion loan is denied. 
We are sorry to have taken such stern measures. We always have valued your business, but we feel that you have taken, ad­vantage of the liberal credit policies extefjded to your predecessors. Remember, your cqedit rating is important to you. But frankly, Mr. Ronald Reagan, you don't have 1one anymore.

The Observer's editorial "Freshman engineers face impossible schedule" (Feb. 24) invites response. Engineering freshmen are not being deprived of a liberal education. 
A careful examination of the new engineering curricula should reveal that the Humanities/SS requirements for the B.S. degree in engineering are now greater by 12

to 37 percent than was required in the previous program. And since the article singles out the draconian nature of the chemical engineering program, be it noted that under our new program the student of chemical engineering can graduate with 33 credits of Humanities/Arts -said sequence being carefully structured to avoid the previous system of "Buffet electives." 
In sum, under the present and enlightened administration of the Engineering College, our engineering graduates will be beneficiaries of a more liberal education 


P.O. Box Q 

JPWeekend 

Dear Editor: 
We would like to join the many parents of Notre Dame juniors in thanking the faculty and students for a beautiful weekend. We will treasure those few days forever. 
Everyone who spoke thanked us for com­ing, but we believe the gratitude should go to all who worked so many months to arrange the weekend, the administration and faculty who gave so freely of their time and the students who made us feel so welcome. You gave us many precious hours for us. 
A very special thank you to all in the food services and the students who carried moun­tains of trays to so beautifully feed us. Also, the dorms who worked so hard on the warm receptions. 
Bob and Rosa lee Stevens

than was available for their unfortunate predecesors of the past decade. Might we hope that one day our Arts and Letters and Business graduates will enjoy comparable exposure to literacy in the fundamental sciences? 
As for the terrors of the Freshman Year for engineering intents, an historical perspective is merited. Until the late 60s every engineering major at Notre Dame was required to take two years of physics, com­mencing in the first semester of the freshman year. Decades of experience demonstrate that freshman year physics is a unique barometer of the student's ability to master subsequent engineering disciplines. Physics is also, incidently, a magnificent discipline in the spectrum of Liberal Education. To be ig­nmant of Newton's world is as tragic as it is to be innocent of that of Dante, Shakespeare and Marx. 
The restoration of the two year physics se­quence for engineering students is, then, hardly novel. Nor draconian and surely not 'impossible.' It, this requirement for freshman 
benefits those equal to its signal challenges and those who fail to cope with its demands. 
For the latter learn that perhaps an engineering major is one in which their otherwise fine talents are not best accom­modated. Is that not the purpose of the Freshman Year of Studies? 
Engineering is a demanding discipline. As too is history, or comparative literature or government to cite but a few humanistic call­
callings. But the talents required of each are hardly interchangeable. Wisely, this thesis is the engine of the Freshman Year. Simply put, intentions must be confronted with a means whereby talents are justly evaluated. 
For the engineering intents, the 'means' consist of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. It hardly serves the aspirants to confront them with a diluted 'means,' thus luring them into the shock wave of the up­perclass engineering programs. 
Nor has the Art and Letter's content of the freshman program been compromised. The English, Seminar and History/SS sequence remains intact. For the chemical engineering major there then remains 24 credit hours of the remaing three years. The days of the sweet wine and wilted roses of the cafeteria A & L elective system are over as far as the faculty of the Chemical Engineering Depart­ment is concerned. 
The best of all worlds? Hardly. While the restored and revitalized engineering cur­ricula correct blatant inadequacies of the past decade, an even greater infusion of Humanities/ Arts is surely needed. During my first decade here, all engineering seniors were required to take Collegiate Seminar. I would celebrate the restoration of a com­parable requirement. Indeed such should be a university-wide requirement. 

For engineering majors there can be no doubt that the five year AS-Engineering pro­gram approaches ideality in all respects save that of the parent's pocketbook. But until the AS-Engineering program is elevated to an economically feasible reality for the majority we must labor to see that the Notre Dame engineering student is challenged by the very best education -liberal and professional.

Express signsBYU QBYoung 
By KEN PETERS 
Associated Press 
The Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League scored a major coup yesterday lan­ding Brigham Young quarterback Steve Young with a staggering $40 million contract that is the richest pact ever for an athlete. 
Young, one of the most prolific passers in college history, will benefit from the contract that runs for 43 years until he is 65. 
A left-hander who set or tied 13 NCAA pasing and total offense records while at BYU, Young had been courted by the National Foot­ball League's Cincinnati Bengals, who told him they would make him the first pick in the May i NFL draft. The Bengals' offer was a reported $3.5 million over five years, including a $1 million sign­ing bonus. 
The 6-foot-2, 196-pound Young said earlier he'd rather play in the NFL, but decided over the weekend to sign with the Express. 
"It was a very tough decision and it came after much deliberation on my part," YOung said.

As in past years, only one former or present NCAA Division I basketball player, male or female, is allowed per team. In addition, no more than three varsity football players are allowed per team, but, if a team has a varsity basketball player on it, the number of allowable varsity football players is then two. 
Should one football player be unable to play for his team, another football player may be substituted for him, as long as he has not played for any other team. Varsity basketball players, however, may not be substituted for varsity basketball players. "Football players" are those per­sons who were listed on the previous fall roster or on the cur­rent spring roster. 
When signing up a team, please be sure to tell the people at the table if your team has any football players on it so that we may schedule those teams only for late games. If anyone on your team is going to the Senior Formal, also tell us about it so that we can avoid any conflict there. It is important to make mention of both of these things because no games will be rescheduled this year. 
Also keep in mind when register­ing your team that team names con­taining vulgarity (i.e. any of George Carlin's seven dirty words) or flagrant attacks upon other students will not under any condi­tions be accepted by the tourna­ment staff. It is not that we want to stifle the great tradition of Bookstore names, only clean them I up to some degree. We only ask that you be creative in choosing a team name, not crude for the sake of being crude. 
The tournament staff will not turn down a creative name, but we will outright reject any team name not complying with the one above rule. Should the captain registering the team refuse to give us another team name, that team will be assigned only a team number or given a generic name, such as Joe's Team. While on the subject of cap­tains, remember that we will need the names of two captains and their phone numbers at the time of registration. 
The tournament itself begins on Friday, April 6 with the Hall of

had some 'Slapshot' attributes," he says. "The play was rough, but it was good. It gave me a lot of ex­perience, especially as a 16-year old playing with guys as old as 21." 
Freshman year, Bonadio had just one assist as a walk-on, but more importantly to him, he was named "Rookie of the year." 
In 1981-82, Bonadio added two more assists as well as 32 games to 
 his playing experience. 
Last year, he tallied the game­winning goal in a 3-2 decision over Michigan State. He also con­tributed seven assists on the season. 
When the 1983-84 regular-season concluded a short time ago, Bonadio had by far surpassed any of his previous totals accumulating eight goals and 13 ASSISTS. 
Besides graduation and employ­ment, another big event is drawing nearer in Bonadio's future. "I got engaged over October Break," he says happily. "Julie (Whiting) and I haven't set a dat yet. We're going to wait and see exactly what I'll be doing. But it will probably be about a year from now." 
When Bonadio graduates, he ex­pects that he will miss "the people, the acquaintances and the friends," and aside from all the academic learning, his athletic involvement has taught him something very im­portant. 
Fame game. Full scale tournament action will start up, then, on Sun­day, April 8, and run the gamut of nine rounds until concluding with the finals on April 29 behind the ACC. 
We hope to have 512 teams again this year. Should we reach 512 teams at the time of registration, we will take further teams on a waiting list basis only, and then consider adding more teams to the tournament after registration is complete. 
Still, I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to come on out and par­ticipate in what is "The World's Largest Basketball Tournament." Get a team together with your

Wayne State as the Tartars scored 
48 points while the Irish fell short 
at 47. Detroit and Cleveland State 
tied for third with 36 points a piece. 
The lady foilers were led by freshman Pia Albertson who took first place in the tournament with a perfect 18-0 mark for the day. The Swedish native also achieved an automatic berth in the NCAA Championships with her title. Freshman Cindy Weeks (8-5) and sophomore Janet Sullivan (7-6) finished ninth and tenth, respec­tively, for the Irish.

If you still have reservations about playing and would like to get involved with the tournament as either a scorekeeper or a dorm rep in charge of getting scorekeepers in your hall, call either Cathy Chopp (6293) or Marc Ramirez (8286).

representatives at Northwestern and completed its roster for the NCAA by qualifying five more men to have a maximum number of two fencers in each weapon at the national tournament. 
The Lady Irish failed to qualify any other fencers besides Pia Albertson as the women's squad came in fourth just missing a re­quired third place finish to qualify for the NCAA. 
"All of our fencers are better to­day because of the help of assistant coaches Steve Renshaw (Irish sabre coach) and Marc DeJong (Irish foil coach)," explained DeCicco. "With their help and our talent, Notre Dame is going to be tough to beat." 
The Irish will be in action again over break at Princeton as they will by vying for their third national championship under Coach DeCic­co between March 20 and 24.

During the school year, you'll serve with a local Army Reserve unit, usually one weekend a month. And after you finish the two summers of training, you'll spend two weeks of training each year, usually in the summer. 
But a good schedule is just one of the ways you'll benefit by joining the Army Reserve. You'll receive more than $7,000 pay for four years of duty. And you might be eligible for one of our special bonuses. 
For more information, call the number below. Or stop by.
