"South Bend is large enough to be imper­sonal, small enough to be boring," said a friend of mine. 
Students returning from break, stuffed and satisfied, pick up their favorite sport, South Bend bashing. Thanks guys, it's my home town. Yes, I'll admit it, I'm a Bender. 
Every Notre Dame student has something to say about the South Bend area and little of it is good. Despite their own origins of Prairie Village, Kansas or Brownstown, Indiana most students feel that South Bend is the most god­forsaken spot on earth. 
Contrary to popular belief South Bend is not some little hick town. The South Bend metro area is around 240,000 people. The St. Joseph Valley area is about a half million people. New York it's not, but it sure isn't Brownstown. 
It's not the numbers, however, that are im­pressive -it's the people. What most students fail to recognize is that the Michiana area is full of domers. No, I don't mean large numbers of Notre Dame students living off-campus. There are 3,769 alumni in the St. Joseph Valley area. It works out roughly that one out of every 132 people in the area are Notre Dame alumni. So every time a current student insults the local community, he (or she) is insulting his former schoolmates. 
The St. Joseph Valley Alumni Association is one of the largest Notre Dame clubs in the na­tion, second only to Chicago.. Complaints about the area may be numerous, but there is some­thing in the community that persuaded graduates to stay in the area. 
This year INC. magazine ranked the South Bend metro area 24th out of 154 areas surveyed for starting and operating a business. A large portion of the businessmen in the area are ND graduates. Professional fields in South Bend and the surrounding area are dominated by alumni. Most area architects, lawyers, bank­ers, and businessmen first arrived in the area as students and then decided to stay. 
Admittedly, South Bend does not have the most active nightlife in the nation, nor the most interesting landmarks. Few places, however, hold enough excitement for students bored with books. South Bend is definitely not a college town. That makes sense, considering the resi­dential nature of Notre Dame does not lend it­self to that situation. Indiana University fits very well into a college town, Notre Dame does not. 
South Bend is easy to abuse and I even took some shots at the community in my high school years. I once told my brother (aND graduate) that South Bend would be nothing without Notre Dame. He pointed out that while the University contributes much to the community, it's a two­way street. In the school's early years it was the Benders who came to Sorin's aid and helped rebuild the Main Building after the 1879 fire. The South Bend community has always actively supported the University and often contributed to its greatness. 
Now, the more criticism the area receives the more I recognize its merits. It might not be quite as exciting as Washington D.C., and the night life doesn't compare with New York's, but it is home.

34 killed in Haitian free-election riots 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE Haitians stayed home in fear Monday, deserting the deadly streets where men with ma­chine guns and machetes killed at least 34 people in a weekend of terror that destroyed the first free election in 30 years. 
Most presidential candidates could not be reached at their homes or offices. The indepen­dent Electoral Council's nine members were in hiding. 
Most businesses were closed. Few cars or public minibuses could be seen and the city's in­dustrial park was virtually deserted. Small groups of men could be seen in some neigh­borhoods. 
Scores of people were wounded Sunday by roving bands who attacked voting sta­tions and people at random in the streets, while the army did nothing to stop it. Gunmen shot up the Electoral Council headquarters. 
The military-dominated Na­tional Governing Council postponed the first election of a president and legislature since 1957, when Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier began the family dictatorship that ended Feb. 7, 1986. 
Silvio Claude, a major presidential candidate, asked

"We call on a group of na­tions -the Organization of American States or the United Nations -to send multinational forces to conduct elections if the United States, the boss of the junta, doesn't force it to step down," said Claude, a 53­year-old Protestant clergyman representing the Christian Democratic Party. 
"No election is possible with this government. They are the Macoutes. They're the ones shooting everybody," he said on Radio Metropole. The Ton­tons Macoutes were the private Duvalier militia that terrorized the nation. 
Haitians often accuse the United States of being the power behind the three-man junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. 
Spokesmen at the state uni­versity hospital morgue said 34 bodies had been brought there. Radio reports said 67 people were wounded.

Leaders  of  the  outlawed

plebiscite a charade and urged Poles to ignore it. The powerful Roman Catholic church did not take a stance. 
"I want to confirm the deter­mination of the authorities to continue reforms and the dem­ocratic procedure of consulting the opinions of voters on issues vital to everyone," Urban said. 
The government has, however, previously said that if it lost the referendum, reforms would continue, but at a slower rate. It has already made moves to streamline its economic planning . 
Urban gave these results: 
To the first question, on eco­nomic reform, 64 percent of those voting said "yes" and 
27.7 percent said "no," with the remainder of the ballots blank or otherwise invalid. To the second question, on political reform, 69 percent said "yes," 
24.6 percent said "no." Final figures showed that 
67.2 percent of eligible voters participated. The government said it was the lowest percentage turnout of any elec­tion in the nation's postwar his­tory. 
Clarification 
A story in the Nov. 23 edition incorrectly reported that Rev. Ruth Meyers, an Epis­copalian minister, re­quested permission to hold Episcopalian services at the O'Hara-Grace Townhouses. Permission was requested on her behalf by the hall staff of O'Hara-Grace, according to Meyers.

Mistakes of Reagan amendable at polls 
One of the hallmarks of our system of representative democracy is the abil­ity to rectify previous mistakes at elec­tion time. If the electorate has commit­ted an error in judgement, whether by misguided principles or as the result of deception, and placed in office a buf­foon or a madman, a decision can be made two or four years hence to not return that individual to a position of power. On occasion, however, such mis­takes in judgement can be repeated, and an official be returned to office to continue to be destructive to the better­ment of society as a whole. 
Karl Kronenber-ger Michael Schadek Daniel M. Sophy 
guest column 
In recent history the voters of this country have transgressed the rules of reason and prudence to twice elect a man to the solemn office of the Presi­dent of the United States primarily on the basis of his ability to tell the elec­torate exactly what it wanted to hear. In so doing we, as a group, chose to overlook the fact that this man had ab­solutely no business in a commanding role of many of the resources of one of the most powerful nations in history. 
-Many Americans have chosen to look the other way as this man has commit­ted or permitted gross acts of im­propriety destructive to the image of America at home and abroad and other­wise morally abhorrent. 
Simply put, we blew it. 
We blew it first by electing Ronald Reagan in 1980, although it is easy to see why we did this. This man displays undeniable talents for communication, and he employed a very successful strategy of appealing to the emotions of "average" Americans. The appeal to patriotism, flag waving, and "bring­ing America back" struck a tender spot in a lot of Americans who didn't want to be beat up on by the rest of the world anymore. They had endured a decade which included the end of Vietnam, the Arab Oil Embargo, and lots of inflation and unemployment. People had a sour taste in their mouths, and yearned for voices of hope. Since the incumbent 
Doonesbury 

continued to be a realist, which was not 
something they wanted to hear, they 
turned to Reagan and his new morning 
in America. 

We blew it again when we re-elected Reagan in 1984. Granted, Mondale was not the most charismatic individual to ever grace a soap box, nevertheless, he too was a realist. We had endured a terrible recession during the first term of the Reagan Presidency, but that was unfortunately easily forgotten by those who voted in 1984. These were not those who were hurt, and hurt badly, by Reaganomics and the other bad ideas that went along with it. These were people who were actually marginally better off as a result of Reagan's various policies. Being the shrewd politician that he may seem to be, he was able to capitalize on this with such queries as "are you better off now than you were four years ago?" Many of those who voted thought they were, so they voted for him. Since then we have had the Iran-Contra soap opera, various disastrous Supreme Court nominations, and a stock market col­lapse that threatens to plunge us into a sever recession. In addition, we have budget and trade deficits to which we can no longer take a cavalier attitude. We are in a severe mess. 
But we do not have to blow it again. In case you do not know, there is an­other Presidential election next fall, and we have the opportunity to reverse this trend of stagnation and social decay. It is time to take a realistic ap­proach to our problems. It is time to leave the fairy tale land of Reagan's America and face the harsh realities of life. It is time to deny the Republicans another chance to continue to ruin this country. 
The choice is yours. Vote wisely in 1988. Put a Democrat in office. If not for yourself, do it for the next genera­tions that will have to bear the brunt of this disaster. Do it for the children. This way you won't have to hate your­self in the morning on November 9, 1988. 
Karl Kronenberger, Michael Schadek and Daniel M. Sophy are the Co-leaders of the College Democrats at Notre Dame.

Divest from Common Sense 
Dear Editor: 

Any graduate student with a modicum of common sense (i.e. the real kind) carr do himself or herself, and the university a great service by withholding the optional graduate union fee assessed to all graduate stu­dent's financial account. This would be an apt way to protest the decision of the governing body of the graduate stu­dent union to fund Common Sense for the entire school year at the rate of $50 an issue. 
Before cries of censorship and narrow-mindedness are raised let two things be remembered. First, even if, per impossibile, the contents of Com­mon Sense represented well-informed and responsible journalism there is no reason the graduate student at large should feel compelled to support the publication financially. Secondly, and more importantly, Common Sense has consistently engaged in slanderous diatribes against the teaching of the Catholic Church and against the person of our present Pope, and there is no reason for us, at a university that aspires to be Catholic, to tolerate this

Co-ed dorms would help student unity 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to take this opportunity to voice my opinion on the highly con­troversial topic of co-ed dorms. After giving the idea much thought, I have come to the conclusion that co-ed dorms could play an essential role in the im­provement of communication and un­derstanding between the men and wo­men attending Notre Dame. Voluntary placement of people of the opposite sex in close living quarters would also serve to unite the two separate groups into one student body--a dream all have been striving toward since the admis­sion of women into the university six­teen years ago. As the students living in co-ed dorms gradually became ac­quainted with each other, they would realize that members of the opposite sex often share similar ideas, opinions, and dreams, that they really aren't so different from themselves. This under­standing would serve to vastly improve student relations across the campus.

Whistle while 
I 
t's tough being king. What with ruling England, leading the knights of the round table and trying to'convince himself his wife Gweneviere is not having an affair with Lancelot, knight number-one, King Ar­thur was under a lot of stress. 
Mary Berger 
Back ln the High Ufe 

One scene In the movie "CAMELOT" I watched over break has a mentally-exhausted Arthur seeking respite in Gweneviere's room. He asks her, "What do the simple folk do?" when they want to escape from the day's woes. 
Suddenly trumpets sound and Gweneviere breaks out in . song: one of the simple folks' answers to "perking up the heart and getting through" is whistling. Just like the seven dwarfs, they whistle a happy tune. 
I myself enjoy whistling. I must clarify, however, that what I consider "whistling" many others do not. To them, my music is an off-key piercing of the air. 
Before I came to Notre Dame, I made a bet with a friend of mine that I would be able to whistle by the time I returned home for Christmas break or else I would treat him to pizza. Up until that time, 
Calvin and Hobbes 
whenever I puckered up, it was not for whistling; my attempts at making music had always · been mute. 
So, first semester freshman year found me blowing a lot of air around as I tried to sing like a bird. My roommate was 
patient with me, enduring the noises I made and encouraging me to win the bet. 
When break roiled around, my friend was not satisfied with the fact that I could finally make a sound come out of my pursed lips. He expected me to be able to whistle a tune! I argued that being on-key and able to follow a tune had not been specified as conditions when the bet was made. I con­sidered the noises I made to be whistling. even if they were not crystal clear. 
Finally, he acknowledged my ability to make supposed whistle sounds and I admitted my inability to do it on key. In the end, he paid for the pizza so I felt I had accomplished something. 
That was two years ago and I am not much further along today. I still whistle and, to this day, most of my friends wince when I do. I provide a constant source of amusement to my

roommate when I whistle to the radio. I'll be off in my own little world, chirping away, and I'll hear this long. stale sound. If I throw something at her, she will stop, but not without us both cracking up. 
One day I was walking through O'Shag and an older gentleman walking in front of me began whistling. He carried the tune beautifully as he, and 
I. almost skipped down the hall. Unaware that I was so en­joying his music, he was simply enjoying the moment for himself. 
There is not enough singing. dancing or whistling in today's world. With ail of the stress we moderns weigh under, what better ways to lighten loads? Breaking out in song like Gweneviere and Arthur did or whistiiJ1g away the day like some happy man here on campus does are wonderful ways to catch a fresh look on life. 
So maybe I can't let out an ear-piercing. eye-catching "Hey Good-Looking" whistle like my roommate can, but I enjoy my attempts, feeble or painful as they may be. Whistling while I work lightens my heart and brings laughter bubbling forth from ail those present. Some­day I just know I'll be able to whistle like Billy Joel does at the beginning of "The Stranger," and then I won't just: be blowing around a lot of off­key air.

Irish face defending champ IU in season opener on the road 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Assistant Sports Editor 

BLOOMINGTON -For a head coach, it can be very difficult to figure out how good your team is by watching them prac­tice. 
Notre Dame head coach Dig­ger Phelps will be able to get a better idea of where his team stands when he puts it up against the reigning NCAA champion Indiana Hoosiers tonight (8 p.m. EST, WNDU­TV). 
The Hoosiers have lost a couple of mainstays from that 30-4 Big Ten co-champion squad. Steve Alford, Big Ten MVP and Indiana's all-time leading scorer, and his 22 points per game are gone, as is forward Daryl Thomas, who averaged 15.7 points 
But Hoosier head coach Bob Knight needs no sympathy. 
Indiana, currently ranked fifth, has three starters return­ing in 6-6 forward Rick Cal­loway, 6-10 center Dean Gar­rett and 6-1 guard Keith Smart. 
Calloway enters his junior 
season as a two-year starter. The inside-outside scoring threat has a 13.2 career scoring average.
Garrett and Smart are seniors who overcame early­season difficulties to make big contributions last season after transferring from junior col­leges, a new phenomenon at In­diana. 
Garrett filled the Hoosiers' hole in the middle by averaging 
11.4 points per game. He also grabbed 288 rebounds and blocked 93 shots to earn honors as the Big Ten's top newcomer. 
The talented Smart, mean­while, overcame an inconsis­tent regular season (11.2 ppg.) when he exploded in the NCAA tournament. In the champion­ship game against Syracuse, Smart canned 21 points, includ­ing 12 of IU's last 15 points and the game-winning jump shot with six seconds remaining. 
The supporting cast is a solid one. Redshirt junior forward­center Todd Jadlow, and senior swingmen Steve Eyl and Kreigh Smith (coming off a broken foot) provide experi­enced depth. Senior guard Joe Hillman has a back injury and may not play. 
Newcomers Lyndon Jones and Jay Edwards, both fresh­

are also very promising in the back court. 
Indiana opened the season with a 90-65 win over Miami (Ohio). Garrett led the scoring with 25 points. 
Knight, who has a 367-119 career record at Indiana, says that last year's championship has to be ignored if his team is to progress as he wants it to. 
"The most important and the most difficult thing is to get them to forget that they were national champions, and that they aren't now," he says. "We just have a long way to go, and 
I  think  we've  said  that  all  
along.  
In last year's game at  the  

ACC, Indiana took a 67-62 win. The Hoosiers hold a 33-17 series edge, having won six of seven at Assembly Hall. 
Phelps says he thinks the early challenge can do nothing but help his untested squad.

McGraw brings in new style 
By BRIAN O'GARA Assistant Sports Editor 
A year ago, all was not well with the Notre Dame women's basketball program. 
A rocky road paved with tough losses and players quit­ting the team finally ended with six straight wins and 12-15 record. To cap off the struggle, head coach Mary DiStanislao resigned at season's end. 
The Irish would be returning all five starters, three reserves, a bundle of potential, but no head coach. Enter Muf­fet McGraw. 
In five years, McGraw had compiled a record of 88-42 at Lehigh in Philadelphia, includ­ing a 24-4 clip and East Coast Conference championship last winter. Why did she leave? 
"The challenge of getting to the NCAA Tournament," said McGraw after the Irish im­proved their record to 2-0 with a win over Northwestern last night. "I didn't have that at Lehigh, there was no chance for a bid. Here we think, be­cause we have so much of a national school in the national limelight, that if we have a good season with our schedule and beat a couple of Top 20 teams, we can get to the tourn­ament." 
To get there, McGraw brought her patented Lehigh style of play, a pressure defense which would force turnovers and create a fast­break offense. The team she in­herited did not play that type of basketball, or at least it did not play it with consistent effi­ciency. Point guard Mary Gavin could run the ball, but Notre Dame's main strength was a big front line that could out-rebound, but not always out-score, the opponent. 
"It (McGraw's fast-paced style) doesn't fit in as well as it could," says McGraw. "But the team is adjusting really well to that style of play. They are really working to learn it and to think about getting down the floor a little better. I think they like it -it's a little more exciting for them. And we

signed two really good players for next year, and they both can run." 
McGraw likes what she sees from her team, not only in their play on the court but their at­titude about the season. 
"What we need from our team right now," says McGraw, who ranks 35th in the nation among active coaches with her .682 winning percentage, "is for them to keep the attitude they have now. The attitide is so good that it makes us work hard and play together, and that generates good defense which helps the break." 
The break. Anyone at last night's 69-49 victory over Northwestern saw the Irish use the fast break, and better than that, win with the fast break. If McGraw has her way, they'll be doing that a lot this winter. And the fast pace is not just more exciting for the players. From the sounds of the crowd last night, fans in the Joyce ACC seats will like it some too. 
every Wildcat down the court and Robinson finishing off the break with a layup. 
Northwestern tried several times to stage a comeback, closing the gap to 40-31, before McGraw called her first timeout of the night with 15: 30 remaining in the game. Two short jumpers by Schwartz and two coast-to-coast Gavin drives 
sparked the Irish  on  a  nine­ 
point  run,  from  which  they  
would never look back.  

Carol Elliot replaced Gavin with 3: 43 remaining and would be the recipient of three staight Wildcat fouls as Northwestern sought one final comeback stab. Elliot cooly sank six straight free throws to ice the win.

Skins Game wants Palmer to return 
Associated Press 
LA QUINTA, Calif.-The Skins Game will be back. 
Lee Trevino will be back. 
And it's up to Arnold Palmer as to whether he'll be back. 
"He's had the greatest im­pact of any man who ever played the game. He's the most popular player who ever lived. He's magic," said Don Ohlmeyer, president of Ohlmeyer Communications and originator of the popular, two-day, 18-hole, made-for­television Skins Game. 
"As long as I have anything to do with it, Arnold can play as long as he likes," Ohlmeyer said. Ohlmeyer and Barry Frank, of Trans World Interna­tional, as the sponsors, have the option of picking one of the four participants. 
Palmer, 58, was their pick

this year. He did not win a skin, did not win a dollar. 
"It's entirely up to Arnold. If he wants to play, he'll get a spot," Ohlmeyer said. 
"What we're trying to do is get the four players the public wants to see play. Not neces­sarily the guy who wins the most money. We want the players the public wants. 
"Now, we have gone into a senior Skins Game (the in­augural to be in Hawaii in Jan­uary). Arnold's going to play in that. 
"Maybe he'll decide he's a senior and wants to concen­trate on senior play," Ohlmeyer said.

Men's cross countryplaces 7th in nation 
Special to the Observer 

The Notre Dame men's cross country team completed a Cin­derella finish to its season by placing seventh in the NCAA Championships at Charlottes­ville, Va., on Nov. 23. 
Senior Dan Garrett led the Irish squad, recording a 29.26 time that was sixth in the country among individuals. The team's finish was Notre Dame's best in 23 years. 
"Realistically, we wanted to finish in the top 10, but we knew it would take a tremendous ef­fort, said Irish coach Joe Piane. "Dan Garrett ran a tremen­dous race. His time was great, Observer I Mike Moran but it was how intelligently he Nov. 23. Arkansas won the ran that was impressive. He must have had 50 runners in

Other individual finishers for Notre Dame included junior Ron Markezich (48th), sopho­more Mike O'Connor (67th), freshman Ryan Cahill (106th), senior Rick Mulvey (125th), freshman Pat Kearns (130th) and sophomore Tom Macken (179th). 
This seventh-place finish fol­lowed a 1986 season in which the Irish placed only 15th in their district and a 1987 regular season in which Notre Dame failed to win an invitational.

NO basketball teams open their seasons

Men look to Rivers to answer questions 
By RICK RIETBROCK Assistant Sports Editor 
The 1987-88 Notre Dame basketball team enters the season in much the same situation it did last season. Untested. Full of questions. Full of potential. 
The big difference from last season is that preseason first-team all-American David Rivers is healthy from the very start. 
The Irish started slowly last season, with losses to Western Kentucky and Indiana, but developed into an outstanding squad by season's end. Along the way, the Irish made a habit of dumping nationally-ranked teams, in-
See IU preview, page 12 
eluding then-No. 1 North Carolina, Duke and DePaul. 
They finished 24-8, after losing to the Tar Heels in the East Regional semifinal, and claimed an 18th ranking in the final wire­service polls. 
Head Coach Digger Phelps says even though matching last year's pleasant surprise will be difficult, the same kind improvement is possi­ble this year because of one man. 
"David Rivers has been our team for the last three years as the guy who can make other people do things," Phelps says. "I thought last year, as we finished with 24 wins, and finished in the final 16 in the NCAA tournament, as he got stronger as the year went on, we got stronger. 
"Nobody expected us to do what we did, and

2nd-ranked 'Canes 
Miami dominates ND 
from start to 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
MIAMI -This time, there was no talk of running up the score. This time there was only talk of domination and frustration. 
The Miami Hurricanes did both to the Irish Saturday af­ternoon at the Orange Bowl, holding Notre Dame to 169 yards of offense en route to a 24-0 shutout. 
The Irish were stymied at every turn on offense. Of 11 pos­sessions, eight ended in punts, two in turnovers and one in the final gun. All and all a day of frustration. 
"What we couldn't do is get a continuity where we could stay with them in the first half," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz, whose team finished the season at 8-3 after suffering its biggest margin of defeat in his two years. "They changed thier defenses, they blend dif­ferent things around, and that presented some problems." 
When the Irish couldn't get their ground express rolling, the 'Canes turned up the heat on quarterbacks Tony Rice and Kent Graham, registering six sacks for 28 yards in losses and batting down passes at the line. 
"We tried to get them into passing situations," said Hur­ricane defensive tackle Daniel Stubbs. "Their linemen are big, and their quarterbacks stay in the pocket. We felt we 
finish 

could out-finesse them to get clear and make Rice throw a bad pass or knock it down. Every time we play a team like Notre Dame or Oklahoma, if we get a certain number of points ahead, they have to throw the ball. They are not known as great passing teams." 
What had to make the game more frustrating for the Irish was the fact that the Miami of­fense didn't play particularly well either. The 'Canes turned the ball over four times, includ­ing fummbles at the Irish one and 13 yardlines. Another drive fizzled at the Irish 13, resulting in a field goal. 
After a scoreless first quar­ter, Miami opened the scoring on a two-yard run by Melvin Bratton. The Irish responded by marching to the Hurricane 
28. But on second-and-12, Miami free safety Bennie Blades picked off a Rice pass. 
The Irish appeared to have stopped the Hurricanes on their ensuing possession when Hur­ricane punter Jeff Feagles dropped back to punt on fourth down at the Irish 41. Instead, the 'Canes pulled the fake and Leonard Conley picked up eight yards and a first down. Still, the Irish held the 'Canes to a field goal, a 30-yarder by Greg Cox, and trailed only 10-0 at the half.

Women use break to run past Wildcats 
By BRIAN O'GARA Assistant Sports Editor 
See the Irish. See them run. See them win. 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team literally ran away with a 69-49 win over Northwestern last night, using a Mary Gavin­led fast break and a tough zone defense to keep the Wildcats from developing any sort of mo­mentum. 
"We finally got the break going tonight," said first-year head coach Muffett McGraw, "I was really happy with that. But it was prompted by good defense, that was the key." 
See McGraw feature, page 13 
The guard trio of Gavin, junior Diondra Toney and freshman Karen Robinson came up with 11 steals and 13 assists between them, including eight handouts for Gavin, who already is Notre Dame's career assists and steals leader with 535 and 188 respectively. 
Both teams, however, were troubled by turn­overs all night long, helping to create the fast break style of the game. The Irish gave the ball away 29 times while Northwestern committed 25 turnovers. 
"We were forcing it a lot," said McGraw. ''Actually the inside players were open but the passes just weren't that good. We made some adjustments at halftime to get it in a little easier by going through the wing and I thought that was effective." 
Notre Dame, now 2-0 with a 67-61 win at Loyola on Saturday, jumped out to a quick 10-3 lead by running the break after forcing Wildcat

Miami's offensive line left quarterback Steve Walsh with plenty of time to throw the ball, as the Irish never could amass a steady pass rush.
