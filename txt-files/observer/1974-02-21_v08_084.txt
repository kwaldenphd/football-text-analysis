Implies conspiracy 
Rhodes refutes Warren Commission 
by Tom Krucyek Staff Reporter 
Before an overflow crowd at Washington Hall, Rusty Rhodes systematically picked apart and refuted the case for the one-man assassination plot of John F. Kennedy present in the Warren Commission report on his death. The com­mission's main piece of evidence was a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald with the gun that was found on the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository Building. Rhodes presented evidence that the photograph of Oswald was a composite with the actual bead of Oswald, but combined with the body of another person. 
Rhodes began the presentation with a short 

No unified thought 


LaFortune renovation discussed 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reporter 
The Officers of the University of Notre Dame met in the Center for Continuing Education Tuesday afternoon to discuss plans for the renovation of the LaFortune Student Center. 
According to Vice-President of Student Affairs Dr. Phillip Faccenda, the Officers are con­sidering four or five specific modifications of the plan submitted by the Student LaFortune Renovation Committee. 
"There is no unified thought on the matter yet." Dr. Faccenda stated. 
"The Ellerbe architects have been at work for two weeks in pricing out the plan and its various modifications," Dr. Faccenda explained. 
The final decision by the officers will be presented at a March 15 meeting of the University Board of Trustees, Dr. Faccenda announced. 
Director of Student Activities Dr.Fr. David Schlaver stated that he is very optimistic and advises students to be patient in awaiting the final decision. 

"The delay doesn't worry me," Fr. Schlaver said. "They've got a number of buildings to consider and the plan for each building depends on the total plan for all the buildings." 
Fr. Schlaver expressed his confidence that the major work on the LaFortune building will begin this summer. 
Dan Schipp, one of the students on the LaFortune Renovation Committee, said the ''project is still going on and will get a hearing before the University officers." Officers." 
"The Officers apparently aren't able to state exactly where they stand at this time because they haven't had a chance to look at the plans in detail, Schipp stated. 
"We [alked about this project for hours and hours last week. A lot of the fury came from our feelings that our plan was going to be thrown by the wayside," Schipp explained. 
"Most of these feelings came about from misperceptions and a lack of communication between students and the administration," Schipp noted. 
"We still want to see our plan adopted and don't feel we are in a bad postion yet," Schipp added. 

history of the John Kennedy years in office. He pointed out that in August of 1963, Kennedy issued an executive order that called for the removal of 1000 men per month from Vietnam until all service men had been removed from the war zone. In an afternoon session, Rhodes had stated that the day after the death of Kennedy, new-president Lyndon Johnson was meeting with generals to change the Kennedy war policy. 
Rhodes, an executive chairman of the Com­mittee 
Rhodes, an executive chairman of the Com~ mittee to Investigate political assassinations, presented slides of the motocade the day of the assassination in Dallas, November 22, 1963. Rhodes noted that the secret service determines the order in which the cars will procede along the parade route. 
Normally, Rhodes related, the president's car was to procede behind the press car in the number seven position of the parade. However, when the parade began the press, who usually take motion pictures of the president while the car is moving, was placed far to the rear of the parade. The effect of this was felt later when the president's car made the turn from Main Street to Houston to Elm Street where the President was shot. While making all of the necessary turns, the press car was a large distance behind the president, negating their camera angle vision. 
Concerning the assassination and the parade route, Rhodes pointed out the fact that normally the secret service car trails the president three to five feet. The secret service car adhered to this rule until the car got midway onto Elm Street. The secret service was further back and is not to be seen on the slides. 
It is Rhodes' conviction that, "the secret service did not take adequate precautions for the president in Dallas. The night before they were up until7:00 in the morning drinking, which is in direct conflict with secret service regulations." 
Rhodes also made the point that while the assassination was in progress (app. 2.8 seconds after the first shot was fired), Lyndon Johnson was on the floor-board of his car, and covered by his secret service agents, slides show, however, that Kennedy's aids failed to respond, even after the president was grasping at his throat. 
Slides were a large part of Rhodes' presen­tation, with one slide showing a view of the book building where Oswald was purported to have fired the fatal shots. The window was empty during the time when Oswald was to have been firing the shots. The Warren Commission was not showed the slide in its enth·ety, but instead was shown one half of this slide, the half showing the vacant window was discarded. 
According to the Warren Commission, the shots which killed Kennedy were to have come from behind the president. Police who were riding to the rear and left of the president, Rhodes observed, were splattered "with brain and skull tissue. They (police) immediately went up to a grassy knoll area to search for the killer." The knoll was located to the front and right of the president. The policemen felt that in order for the bullet to proceed at a diagonal across the president's skull, it would have had to be shot from in front and to the right of Kennedy. 
The Warren Commission ignored this with their story of what later was called the Magic Bullet Theory, or "super bullet." 
Rhodes said that for Kennedy and Governor of Texas John Connollyto be hit and have a total of seven holes, there would have to be more than one bullet or more than one assassin. Not so, says the Warren Commission. This Commission came to the conclusion illustrated by Rhodes through the use of diagrams, that the bullet when shot from the sixth floor angle, first entered the president in the back and proceeded out the front of the neck, striking the governor. 
However, Rhodes declared "autopsy reports show that the bullet entered the president's body 5-% inches below the collar line. The Warren Commission merely changed that medical fact to the bullet's entering at the throat." 
"When one examines the evidence, one sees that the bullet would have to enter in the back, and instead of going downward since the bullet was fired from six floors up, when it entered Kennedy's body, traveled up and out of the throat where it proceeded to, if one is to believe the one bullet idea, hang in the air for a second, hitting Connolly through the back of the rib cage, and exit out the front and into the governor's wrist and then into his left thigh," criticized Rhodes. 
Rhodes stated that in addition to all of the action in the president's car, a bystander was also shot. Oswald, it was later pointed out, would have had to load the gun within three­quarters of a second to have fired all the shots. No bullets were found, except later one bullet was found on the stretcher that carried Connolly. This bullet originally weighed 160 grams, and

Washington <UPI) -A federal judge Wednesday rejected with a single unexplained "qualification" Dwight L. Chapin's attempt to block Watergate witness John W. Dean IIIfrom testifying against him at his upcoming perjury trial. 
Chapin, President Nixon's former appointments secretary, con­tended that Dean, as former White House counsel, in effect had been his lawyer and could not be a prosecution witness. 
But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who listened to secret testimony on the subject last week, issued a one-sentence order denying Chapin's motion to bar Dean from the witness stand. 
New York <UPI) -·A federal court judge Wednesday read a list of names including John W. Dean, John Ehrlichman and three of President Nixon's relatives to a prospective jury in the conspiracy and perjury trial of former cabinet members John N. Mitchell and Maurice Stans. ' 
U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi did not indicate whether former presidential advisor Ehrlichman or the Nixon relatives would be called to testify in the trial. Dean, the former White House counsel, is expected to be a key prosecution witness. 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -In­flation, already galloping at a 22-year high, was even worse than initially estimated at the end of 1973, the Commerce Department reported Wednes­day. 
Revised figures on the state of the economy between Octo­ber and December showed prices rising at an 8.8 per cent annual rate, substantially high­er than the 7.9 per cent estimated last month in a preliminary report on the gross national product (GNP). 
The heavy inflation pace was the worst since the first three months of 1951, when the economy was fighting the Korean War inflationary boom. 
Economic output in the fourth quarter of 1973, however, was somewhat larger than first estimated, 1.6 per cent instead of 1.3 per cent. 
The two revised figures present a picture of an economy growing at a sluggish pace at year's end, with prices out of control despite a continuing government stabili­zation program based largely on volunatry compliance. 

Most government and private economists feel the situation has deteriorated since then. 
The fourth quarter growth rate was far lower than the administration would like. 
The two revisions meant that GNP -the total value of goods and services produced in the U. 
S. economy -rose in the fourth quarter at a 10.5 per cent

The public talk will be held at 8:00 p.m. Friday in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Education. 
Admiral Rickover, who has been called the "Father of the Nuclear Navy." began working on the project to develop an atomic powered submarine in 1946. He has continued to be associated with the development of nuclear naval vessels since that time and was 
instrumental in the construction of the first civilian nuclear reactors. A1922 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Admiral Rickover has

President Nixon graduated . Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the chief of Naval Operations, opened the Navy's flying program to women for the first time last year. Eight candidates, including Lt. Allen, were accepted into the program. 
Because women are still prohibted from entering combat, the trainees were limited to flying transport aircraft and fleet type helicopters. 
One of the eight trainees flunked out because she became air sick and a second resigned after marrying her recruiter. The remaining five are still in training.

Revised inflation estimates show increase 
annual rate, or $33 billion. More than three-fourths of this increase was caused by infla­tion and only a small fraction represented an actual increase in production. 
Increases in net exports and the value of goods held in business inventories were the chief reasons for the upward revision . These were partially offset by a drop in consumer spending. 
Both government and private economists believe that the growth rate in the current January-March quarter will be worse --zero or perhaps even below. Official tigures will not be available until April.

Glasser to speak at O'Laughlin 

by Judy Peterson Staff Reporter 
William Glasser, M.D., the reknowned auther of Schools Without Failuree, Reality Therapy: New Approach to Society, and The Identity Society, will be appearing at O'Laughlin Auditorium on April 24, from 7:00 
p.m. -9:00p.m. A reception will be held at 9:15 p.m. in Stapleton Lounge for representatives of school systems throughout Nothern Indiana. Dr. Glasser appears in preparation for the proposed opening of a Glasser Institute at St. Mary's next fall. 
His works are based on the belief that there has been a cultural change since World War II from a goal to a role-oriented society. 
Television, civil rights and the 
affluence of modern western 
society are some of the major 
factors affecting this change, 
which he labels "cultural con­
flict." 

Reality Therapy, which stresses inter-personal relationships, has been successfully applied in practice throughout the schools without failure. These schools have eliminated the regimented aspects of present day educational institutions, such as the grading system. 
Also scheduled are workshops on Reality Therapy, Schools Without Failure and Internalization of Discipline, to be held at SMC on June 10, 17, and 24. Details con­cerning the workshops, which can be taken as credited courses, will be released at a later date.

Credit card firms sued

WASHINGTON <UPI) Con­sumers Union sued American Express and BankAmericard Wednesday, accusing the credit card firms of preventing merchants from offering dis­counts to cash customers. 
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, claimed the two firms' practice was discriminatory and asked the court to forbid the pricing policy. 
"Pegging the prices charged to cash customers to the prices credit card users pay elimi­nates price competition and is tantamount to restraint of trade," a Consumers Union official said. 
"A shopkeeper should be able to pass along these savings to cash customers in the form of discounts and lower prices. But American Express and Bank kAmericard forbid merchants from giving a better deal to cash customers. 
"Since only the credit card user enjoys the added service of paying later, all consumers end up paying for the benefits of credit card holders." 
American Express and Bank kAmericard officials said they would not comment on the suit until they have had time to study it. 
Consumers Union, which pub­lishes the magazine "Consumer Reports," said the provision is included in contracts between companies and merchants that set up credit card service at a particular establishment. The suit claimed the clause violates antitrust laws.

If the customer uses a credit 
card, the lawyer said, the 
merchant will pay a certain 
percentage-say 5 per cent, or 
$5-to the credit company and 
keep the remaining $95. But if 
the customer pays cash, the 
merchant keeps the whole $100 
and in effect "saves" the 
commission to the credit 
company. 

Consumers Union contends that saving should be passed on to the cash customer in the form of a lower price. 
The Senate has passed a law that would achieve the same objective as the Consumers Union suit, but the legislation is stalled in the House.

Shutdown threatened 
Station owners demand price hikes 
Gasoline station owners warned the government Wednesday it was "sitting on a powder keg" that could explode in a nationwide shutdown of gaso­line pumps unless it granted a substantial increase in retail prices. 
Charles Binsted, president of the National Congress of Petroleum Retailers represent­ing 70,000 dealers, met with deputy federal energy director John C. . Sawhill 1Wednesday about ways to head off a threatened uprising by station owners protesting the need for 
higher prices  to  offset  reduced  
gasoline supplies.  
"We did  not  threaten  Sawhill,  

but we made it very clear this is a serious situation," Binstead said. Sawhill promised to meet with the station owners' re­presentatives again on Satur­day, he said. 
The dealers' representatives urged Sawhill to approve a sliding scale formula which would allow them to increase gasoline prices by their profit margins by one-tenth of 1 per cent for each 1 per cent cutback in gasoline allocations. 
"They are well aware we are sitting on a powder keg," Binsted said, referring to the spreading shutdowns in gaso­line stations in protest against reduced supplies, the profits freeze and growing waiting lines at stations. 
Gov. Marvin Mandel of Maryland announced mean­while he had sued the Federal Energy Office in U.S. District Court in Baltimore "to get our fair share of gasoline for February."

A Cloud of Fear 
Wednesday morning, the sun broke out of the gray skies of past days and brightened up Notre Dame considerably. For a change, the sky was a pale blue and the Dome shone against it with picture­postcard splendor. 
It was the kind of day that made you happy to be alive and even being at Notre Dame was almost a pleasure. But the beauty of the day and the feeling that 
spring was feeling  may have arrived in counter-balanced by ..... another concern.  February another  
A Sense of Fear  

The beauty and good feelings were veing balanced by a sense of fear-a fear that seems prevelant at Notre Dame. 
The people of Notre Dame are afraid to relate to one another, they seem afraid to communicate their feelings and to touch each other. Maybe it's the thoughts of a much too long winter, but I think it's something else. 
The trouble apparently stems from a fear of identification and a corresponding fear of reprisal. Most people here are afraid to admit that they said something. They prefer not to take the credit for an article or for an action. The shadow of anonymity hides all and shields all from danger. The attitude that is most ap­parent is that ifI say something that's out of line, I'll pay for it. 
Method of Judging 
The only method of judging this that we have available are the letters that we receive. Surprisingly, the volume of letters that this newspaper has received this year is far above that of any year before. People at Notre Dame have a lot to say and a desire to say it, but they must be terrified to admit that they actually said it. 
Over 50 percent of the letters to the editor received at The Observer come unsigned or with the request to have the name withheld from it. That's not a healthy sign. Most of the letters are over silly matters...far from anything that would merit reprisal from anyone or any office. 
The Clincher 

But Wednesday the clincher finally came. A letter came to the office com­plaining about the Armory Party.· Everyone respects another person's right to complain about anything. Yet, this letter simply expressing a person's disappointment with the party came with the plea to"Please don't print my name." 
What are people afraid of anyway? I wish I could say that the sun coming out and spring being on its way would cure everything, but that would be foolish of me, wouldn't it? The problem seems to extend much deepr than that. 
From What Source 
Though it's questionable if blame can be placed in a situation like this, one must first look at the office of student affairs, for their actions most directly affect student life at Notre Dame. 
If there is this feeling of fear within the student population, the student affairs staff has to ask themselves if they have done something wrong or if they are operating in methods that create this fear. Someone, somewhere is doing something wrong if people are afraid. And the huge, overridng question is why should people be afraid at a University that pledges itself to "Christian com­munity." 
It's something to think about. And if the sun shines again today (yes, even in Indiana the sun can shine two days in a row) enjoy it. But don't let its presence disguise the fact that something is wrong.

Pal_. Bearin~s A Serious Choice 
ann mc:c:arry 
A hoax, an ego-trip, an excuse for a party, an impressive qualification and uncomfortable silence. Student government elections are these and more at Notre Dame. 
Student politicking has an interesting heritage at du Lac. Those involved have ranged from rebels with causes to pooh-bahs with briefcases, to vermin, caught with their fingers in the till. Once in a while a "Boss" Daley machine will bloom or a pseudo-nobleman with supernatural powers will run the show. 
Too rarely there appears an honest man with a real concern, a selfless motive and a capability for solid action. 
You will be witnessing the birth and rebirth of many such characters in the coming days. They are all a part of black comedy entitled "The Student Government Elections:' 
The play has been in preparation for untold weeks, months and even years, in some cases. (Some candidates have been known to admit that they enrolled with this objective in mind.) The public per­formances begin now as the various SBP and SBVP aspirants an­nounce their candidacies. 
For some the campaign and subsequent elections are nothing more than this--a play, a psycho-drama, an alternative to the February blahs. Others are earnest politicians-dedicated to the proposition that all students are created equal but that they are a bit more equal than the rest. 
Afew believe that student government is a viable entity on campus and has the potential of becoming an effective, efficient service to the university, facilitating not only the student body but the faculty and administration as well. 
The candidates' qualifications vary. Some are short and some are tall. Some like premed, some hate football. Some have been involved in an ND political machine for the duration of their college career or are refugees from hall government organizations. Some are new talents, taking a chance and hoping for the best. 
Who the candidates are, what they look like, what ideology they profess is, unfortunately, rarely important. The Notre Dame voter has a reputation for being irratiic, irrational and easily swayed. Nonconscientious and narrow-minded the Notre Dame electorate has habitually chosen the "Forgone Conclusion" or the "Last Minute Whimsy. "It is this same electorate that will rise in flaming fury some months later when a pre-Labor Day registration date is set as the Dean of Student's Office pinpoints a new party policy or organizes a squad of campus narcs. 
The voters want and need a responsible student government then, one that can ~peak and at least be heard if not listened to, also. The Observer may be a mouthpiece or even a mold for public opinion. It is not , however, primarily an administration-student body go­between. A student government is necessary for a consistently positive representation of student opinion in university affairs. 
The choice of candidates will be yours and there will be many from which to choose. Only one slate of candidates can win. 
Think carefully, considering all the alternatives in relation to what Notre Dame is to you and what you would like it to become. Jumping on a bandwagon with rash abandon can be diverting but it can be disastrous too. 
Think. Vote deliberately, please. You, the voter, are the only one 
that .can lose.

marceau's performance praised by some .   
a review by ann mccarry 
O'Laughlin Auditorium, a dark sea of hushed whispers, the cur­tains parted to reveal a barren, expectant stage. A flicker of ac­tion and suddenly a spot-lit figure. 
Striking an inimitable pose, vaguely reminiscent of a Tarot card, the piquant Pierre Verry unfurled a silk banner announcing the first pantomime-"A Sunday Walk." 
A pregnant blackout then a splash of light. Marcel Marceau, the world's greatest mime, graciously acknowledged the welcoming acclaimation of his audience Tuesday night. 
The performance proceeded swiftly and efficiently--a well­chosen and organized selection of vignettes from the master's repertoire. Each pantomime flowed, consistently expressing the grace, control and classic style of Marceau that permeated the performance. Another factor consistent with the performance was, unfortunately the lack of rapport between the artist and his audience. Nonetheless, the pan­tomimes displayed Marceau's versatility as well. Miming the 
"SevenDeadly Sins,' or interpreting 
Marcel Marceau describes 
mime as an art "halfway between 
dancing and theatre ... a complete 
art in the sense that it tends 
towards an aU-embracing 
definition of the human being. The 
art of the mime," he continues, "is 
the portrayal of the human being in 
its most secret yearnings." 
Yet, one of the most memorable 
aspects of Marceau's performance 
Tuesday night was its humor. In all 
but two of the sketches, the im­
mediate result of the action was 
laughter at the expense of some 
interpreted and satirized human 
movement. This could be un­
fortunate, because a critique on 
the idiosyncrasies of man certainly 
cannot constitute his "most secret 
yearnings," nor can humor help 
but obscure the true beauty of the 
dance of form that is mime. 
"A gesture, unless lyrically 
sustained, is but a drawing in 
space. Still, it is necessary to 
measure and situate it in time by 
giving it dramatic power. This 
power will either prove poetical, or 
will contrast brutally with its 
outline, leaving only a spasm, a 
jolt, a break ..." 
Thus wrote Marceau in 1956, 
when mime for that artist did not 
intimate humor or Bip. His 
current sketches do present a jolt, 
a break with natural rhythm of 
human harmony, and thus the 
humor. Marceau is undoubtedly 
trying to express the beauty of 
mimetic action through his 
comedies, yet he seems to be 
primarily evoking mirth, of which 
he is surely conscious. 
Somehow I feel that the fluid 
beauty and continuity of the 
dramatic action is broke by the 
sporadic, episodic movements of 
the artist in the form he has 
assumed today. The emphasis has 
changed and developed as the 
artist has aged and become sen­
sitive to the tastes of his audience.

Call Clark 234-2098 and save money. 
with a unique ballet quality, the "Creation of the World,"Marceau was a symphony of imagination, talent and elegance combined with the concentration and dedication that epitomizes his art. 
These techniques were best exhibited in the intensity of the Maskmaker. Assuming the character of a mask-molding artisan, Marceau became the creator modelling his creations. Marceau's expression changed in rapid succession, a tribute to his adroit facial control. 
The punch line is that the Mask­makercannot remove the laughing visage from his own. With simple gesture, although his facial ex­pression is frozen in the smile, Marceau communicates the anxiety and immense aggravation of the frustrated craftsman. 
His audience intrigued with the mime's talented use of comedy, satire, and the simple ease with which he intimated the nuances of the persons and situations he portrayed, Marceau returned, in the second half of his performance, with a series of "Bip" pan­tomimes. 

Marceau created "Bip" in 1947. The battered clown, attired in his traditional striped pullover and a tattered, rose-adorned hat, has been described as Marceau's "alter-ego." Perhaps "Bip" is 
   and criticized by others 
The Marceau of 1956 could have never appeared with Johnny Carson. 
The "new" Marcel Marceau is just as much a genius as the "old." The ability to dissect human action to its most fundamental parts, to reconstruct it wittily, almost satirically, has made Marceau the most popular mime artist of our time. By the same token, it has also delineated a clear Marceau brand of mime separate from tradition and criticized as a distinct style, destined to last only as long as its perpetrator. 
In addition to comedy, the new Marceau is distinguished by the use of facial expression. Though facial articulation is important to the whole mime experience, it must not dominate to the extent that is obscures the movements of the body. With the mime of Mar­ceau, it is very easy to become involved with his facial contortions 
to the exclusion of all else. Within the period of one year, Marceau's selections have shifted from a morP balanced involvement of the body to a seeminging dependence on the face. The easiest and most effective reactions expressions can generate is mirth; thus the dif­ference between the mime of Marceau and the tradition which preceeded him. 
Moreover, Marceau has begun to rely more heavily on music, not only to bridge and complete his sketches, but also to provide a cadence for the movement. I am reminded of Red Skelton who completed each of his shows with the "Silent Spot." He too relied on music and effects to supply what his own actions could not. It is much easier. 
That Marcel Marceau has succeeded in bringing mime to the attention of the people is un­deniable, yet the methods he has Plays David and Goliath", "Bip" brings to life the inner personality of Marceau, which, up until now, has only colored the performance. 
Here is the essence of Marcel Marceau--the paradox of the simple man, gracefully per­forming under pressure of a demanding, fairly unresponsive audience, sharing with them the intricate wealth of his imagination, illuminating all with his brilliant perception of man and his society. 
Saving his best for last, Mal'{:eau summoned all of his talent, in­sights and poetic imagery for "Bip as a Soldier." Marceau's "Bip" traces the life of a soldier as he 
leaves his sweetheart, enlists, marches to the front, and, finally, is killed in battle. 
Emanating sincerely poignant feeling through discreetly telling 
mime,accentuated by subtle lighting changes, Marceau, previously comic and witty, now portrays the greatest tragedy known to man. 
The performance is ended. The stage once again bare and blackened. The art remains, the echoes of Marcel Marceau's ability, his perpetual encore. 
used to reach this goal often leave the sensitive viewer in doubt. Some would even go as far as to equate the popularization of mime with its vulgarization. Nevertheless, Marceau believes in his art just as adamantly as Etienne Decroux, 
by tom gora 

and he has the added satisfaction of knowing he is tremendously successful. No doubt, then, in the face of this and other criticism, Marceau will remain unperplexed, treating these comments as he does all else-in silence.

Destroying stereotypes 
Editor: 
Having spent four years at Notre Dame and a year and a half after that working actively in and with the South Bend-Mishawaka communities, I've a comment to rnake. First, to the amazement of r-1any, though not all, Notre Dame students and some faculty, I would like to report that all the people of the neighboring city are not ignorant, nanow-minded, back­ward, eat-with-their-fingers clods. I wish I had a mill for each time in the past five and a half years I've heard students here cut down South Bend, its citizens, weather, stones, etc., etc., ad infinitum. Flash! South Bend is a nice town a whole lot like a lot of towns. 
My perception is that the sources 
of students' disgruntlement are 
generally, 1. )their own home town 
is paradise and the very center of 
the cultural, entertainment, etc., 
world -hence no town may measure 
up, or, 2.) the students don't really 
know South Bend and Mishawaka 
people. As Freshmen there is the 
laughter and scorn heard when 
they ask about "down town" the 
first tie, and, having accepted the 
prejudgement and keeping con­
tacts to a minimum, the prophecy 
is fulfilled. 
I might add that, although 
married now myself, all the girls in 
South Bend, alias "townies," are 
not sluts and tramps. In this 
regard, let it suffice to remark that 
here, as in any town, water seeks 
its own level. Again, you can find 
what you're looking for. 
To whit: Give South Bend and 
Mishawaka a chance. What have 
you got to lose? Although there 
may be no basis in realityto appeal 
on such a level, you might consider 
that as Notre Dame (you 
remember, "Our Mother," the 
Mother of Christ), declares itself 
Christian, the burden is perhaps 
especially on the men and women 
of the University. 
It would be incredibly naive for 
me to maintain that the people of 
South Bend-Mishawaka are 
blameless in what at times seems 
to amount to a genre of cold war 
between the communities. What 
I'd most like to say to those at 
Notre Dame who would ut South 
Bend down just because it's South 
Bend is this: Be open. We can all 
find characteristics in and person 
or group that are ugly, unkind and 
worthy of our dislike. The alter­
native is communication, treating 
every one (and each community) 
as the unique person he or she is 
and just caring about the other guy 
as a fellow human being. 
I've written a note to the "South Bend Tribune"with similar pur­pose and content: "Let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with me." Let it begin here, between the South Bend and Notre Dame communities. 
Sincerely, J.C.P. ('72)
