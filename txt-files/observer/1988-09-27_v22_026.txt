Reagan eases gulf policing operations 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK --Citing the Iran-Iraq cease-fire agree­ment, the Reagan administra­tion said Monday it will end America's ship-escorting oper­ation in the Persian Gulf while maintaining a presence there. 
President Reagan's decision to terminate the close-quarter convoying of neutral commer­cial ships came after U.S. offi­cials reviewed how the Aug. 20 cease-fire was working, said White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater. 
The move substantially lowers the U.S. profile in the troubled waters nearly three months after a U.S. navy Aegis cruiser shot down an Iranian civilian airliner with 290 people on board. The United States said it regretted the accident, and officials have been weigh­ing a program to compensate relatives of the victims. 
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One while Reagan flew here from Washington, Fitzwater said the administra­tion decided to relax the Per­sian Gulf sea-lane policing op­eration only after "consulting with allies and friends in the region." 
Fitzwater said it would take a few days to revamp the U.S. military presence in the region. He said there would no formal announcement when that takes place. 
In effect, the United States will replace its close-quarter escorting of commercial ships with a sort of arms-length sur­veillance operation. The formation was likened by U.S. officials to a "zone" coverage of shipping rather than a "man­to-man" coverage. 
The analogy to a kind of coverage used in basketball means that U.S. ships will watch selected areas of the gulf for trouble, rather than focus­ing the protective operation on individual vessels. 
In a speech to the United Na­tions General Assembly, Reagan said the world can feel "the uplift of hope" in the gulf war, which he called "one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War II." 
During a brief exchange with reporters after a private meeting with U.N. secretary General Javier Perez de Cuel­lar, Reagan also said he hoped the easing of tensions in that part of the world could lead to the release of nine Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon. 
But Fitzwater told reporters "there is no new morsel of in­formation" to encourage U.S. officials, and said "there is no new signal'' indicating a hostage release. 
In announcing the phase­down of the U.S. ship protection operation, Fitzwater stressed that "the U.S. intends to main­tain in the gulf the forces re­quired to protect U.S.-flagged shipping and support our na­tional objectives. These changes in no way alter our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf." 
The White House said the modification in the U.S. opera­tion "entails a change from a tight escort procedure to an 'accompany' regime. In an ac­company regime, U.S. forces will be positioned such that they can take appropriate ac­tion if U.S.-flagged ships are di­rectly threatened." 
There have been no attacks on neutral shipping in the gulf since the ceasefire began on Aug. 20. 
The U.S. convoy operation began 14 months ago and in­volved a precise Navy forma­tion used to protect against po­tential Iranian attacks against Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the U.S. flag. 
The United States had 26 ships in its Joint Task Force Middle East, including 17 in the Persian Gulf, as of Sept. 16.

Donahue and Pozner to co-host lecture at Notre Dame 
Special to The Observer 
Phil Donahue, host of the nationally syndicated Donahue television talk show, and Vladimir Pozner, Soviet television commen­tator, will deliver a joint lec­ture entitled "U.S.-Soviet Relations: Two Journalists' Views," on Thursday, Oct. 6 at 8 p.m. in the Joyce Ath­letic and Convocation Cen­ter. 
This will be the second time Donahue and Pozner have appeared together. In January of 1986 they co­hosted the television fea­ture, "A Citizen's Summit," a dialogue via satellite be­tween audiences in Seattle and Leningrad. 
Vladimir Pozner appears frequently on both U.S. and Soviet television and is heard regularly on the North American Service of Radio Moscow. Employed by the 
U.S.S.R. state committee for television and radio, Pozner holds the rank of political ob­server, the top classification in Soviet journalism. 
Pozner was born in Paris in 1934 and spent his forma­tive years, from 1940 to 1949, in Brooklyn. In 1949 his fam­ily moved to East Germany, and then to Moscow in 1952. A graduate of Moscow Uni­versity, where he majored in human and animal physiol­ogy, Pozner entered jour­nalism in 1961 with Novosti Press Agency. He later was managing editor of both Sputnik and Soviet Life magazines. Soviet Life is written for and distributed to readers in the U.S.

IN BRIEF 

Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University, was among an international group of 45 university presidents who agreed last week to organize a new effort for disarmament through education. The gath­ered presidents issued a declaration recommending the development of a new interdisciplinary curricuh!m to ad­dress arms control and negotiation; university supp')rt for scholars and courses focussing on arms control and con­flict management; and the development of international information centers. 
The presidential debate was viewed by about 60 percent of those watching television Sunday night accor­ding to preliminary figures from the A.C. Nielse~ Co. In the 16 largest markets, the 90-minute live, prime-time debate between Vice President George Bush and Massa­chusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had a rating of 17.4 and a 27 share on NBC, an 11.9 and 18 share on CBS and a 9.8 an~ 15 share on ~C. The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million U.S. households with televisions. !he share. is a percentage of sets in use. NBC interrupted Its <?lympics coverage for the debate. Ratings were not available Monday for CNN and PBS, which also carried the debate live.

Bush, Dukakis trade jabs 
Associated Press televised debate to show up in it read. 
Michael Dukakis and George Bush exchanged post-debate jabs from a distance Monday, the Democrat saying his rival would "lead America nowhere" and the vice presi­dent charging his opponent with trying to obscure a liberal past. 
The two candidates renewed campaign hostilities as their aides waited for the impact of Sunday night's nationally the close race for the White House. The first polls rated the 90-minute confrontation a tos­sup. 
"One debate down. How'd I do?" Bush asked a cheering crowd of supporters at a rail­road amusement park in Jack­son, Tenn. 
Republican running mate Dan Quayle swiftly declared Bush the winner. But overhead, a small plane carried a banner of dissent. "Dukakis 1. Bush 0,"

These signs measure approximately 2 feet square. Three signs are white and have the University seal in blue on the center of the sign. The Food Service leprechaun and the block "ND" are printed near the top of these three signs. The other three signs are white and have a "7-UP" logo on them. The signs were designed to be mounted in lighted menu

A three-day conference titled ''Christian Business Values in an Intercultural Environment" convened Sept. 25 in Notre Dame's Center for Continuing Education. 
The conference, sponsored by the University's Center for the Study of Contemporary So­ciety, opened at 8 p.m. Sunday with a joint lecture.

South Quad buzzes with bee study 
By JULIE FLANAGAN 
News Staff 
South Quad continues to buzz with the activity of an ongoing honeybee experiment con­ducted by biology graduate stu­dent Dave Schmitt. Schmitt has been researching how honeybees navigate using mag­netic fields for the past four years. 
"What Dave has been doing is unique. No one is using his approach," said Harald Esch, professor of biological sciences and Schmitt's advisor. He labeled Schmitt's work "very exciting." 
Schmitt has assembled a feeding station near Alumni Hall as one of the initial points of the experiment. A sugar and water solution lures the bees to the station, Schmitt said. He then marks the bees for identi­fication, enabling him to trace the routes of certain bees which return to the hives by Galvin Life Science Center, he said. 
In addition to the field re­
search which produces inter­
esting data concerning dis­
tance and direction, Schmitt 
said, he employs numerous lab­
oratory experiments. He 
usually places the bee in an ap­
paratus, devoid of flight cues 
such as light, in the center of a 
magnetic field. The flight pat­
terns of the bees are then mon­
itored and fed to a computer 
for further analysis. 
Since the onset of the experi­
ment, Schmitt has individually 
tested 886 bees to determine the 
part the magnetic field plays 
in the flight patterns of the in­
sects, he said. Concerning 
the findings, Schmitt said, 
"There are different patterns 
depending on distance and 
hopefully some results will al­
low us to determine what physi­
cal aspects of the magnetic 
field the bees are using." 
The study of biomagnetism 
is a relatively new field so it is 
difficult to tell the possible ap­
plications, said Schmitt. Mag-

Lewis Hall: More Than Meets the Eye 
MICHELLE LAROSE accent writer 
N 
estled behind the Golden Dome, and often mistaken for the infirmary, Lewis Hall enjoys a quiet and serenity not often found on the busy North and South Quads, as well as relative proximity to almost anything on campus.

Lewis was built with funds from the Challenge I fund­raising drive, initiated by the Ford Foundation in 1960. The dorm was completed in 1965 and served as a residence for women religious. Today Lewis is the Alumni Hotel in the summer, where visiting alumni can stay with their families for $10 a night while visiting the campus or pass­ing through South Bend. 
During the school year, however, Lewis is the home­away-from-home for 308 stu­dents, making it the most 
populous woman's dorm on 
campus. Despite the large 
number of women who live 
there, Lewis has developed a 
strong sense of community. 
Lewisites find it easy to meet each other at the fre­quent receptions after Sunday Mass, daily aerobics, monthly birthday parties, and special events such as the famous midnight barbeques, and Pro­gressive Ice Cream parties. 
''Architecturally straight­forward" is the description that accompanies Lewis in the freshman registration guide. There's a lot more to Lewis than meets the eye, however. Residents living in the west section receive an unparalleled view of the dome and the spire of Sacred Heart Church, and those with rooms in the rear of the building can watch the seasons change around St. Joseph's Lake. 
Another fairly unknown fea­ture of Lewis is our court­yard, featuring the statue of the Virgin and Child. Here residents can study, cook-out, or catch some rays in peace and quiet. 
Lewis traditionally has had strong interhall sports teams. The basketball team won the championship in 1986, and last year the soccer team captured first place. In their first two games this year, the flag football team has gone into overtime nail-biters, the results of which were one win over Knott, and one loss to the ever-tough Farley. 


"Lots of people join our in­terhall sports because we're very intense and play tough, but we leave the competition on the field," says junior cen­ter and athletic commission­er, Christine W allmeyer. 
· · 
Theoretically one of the "God Quad" dorms, Lewis actually is not physically part of any quad. While some may say that this is a drawback, and prevents the dorm from being a part of a larger campus identity, others view it as an advantage. 
"Most of my friends from North Quad don't know many people from the South Quad and vice versa," states senior Resident Advisor, Ellen Mouch. "We eat in North or South Dining Hall depending on who we're meeting, and because Lewis is kind of in­between quads, it allows us to go back and forth." 
Lewis continues to grow with each passing year, and more and more people are finding out about the best­kept secret on campus. Stop by and visit anytime; it's the building with the porch swings behind the dome. 
Clarification 
In last week's "Dorm of the Week" article, the con­clusion and the headline to the article on Alumni Hall were not written by the au­thor, Matt Spatz, so he 

... should therefore not be credited (or associated) with it whatsoever. 
The "Dorm of the Week" is a weekly series in which the focus is an explanation of the history and traditions of every dorm on campus. The order in which each dorm appears is a result of random selection, and in no way is the series to be con­strued as a competition or glorification of one dorm over another. 



KELLIE PORTER accent writer 
I 
n addition to promoting campus involvement, Notre Dame gives its students the chance to become involved in community service. One of these opportunities takes shape as the Urban Plunge. This program is designed to give students an introduction to conditions of extreme poverty. 
The experience began with a tour of the South Bend Wel­fare Department and an at­tempt to fill out applications for food stamps. I found myself struggling with the instructions, and I wondered, "How could someone who is either illiterate or minimally educated understand this?" 
One of the most amazing aspects that we learned about welfare is that the system is actually:. set up on the basis of 
Calvin and Hobbes 
maintaining unemployment rather than decreasing it. It's a common assumption that those on welfare are lazy. But it is reality that they are people who have limited schooling and a low degree of work skills. Therefore, the only jobs available to them are minimum wage jobs, such as those at McDonald's. Add­ing the responsibility of child care and transportation, one can see that it pays more to be on welfare and to stay home with the children. 
After leaving the Welfare Department, our group split in different directions. Six students went to help set up an emergency 24-hour shelter with South Bend's Mayor Ker­nan (whom we met with on the Plunge). At the same time, the other half of the group went to the police sta­tion where we each drove around with a South Bend police officer from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. We experienced first hand, domestic disputes, an armed robbery (which led to 

a stakeout and capture), and 
of course, the traditional 
donut shops. 
The next day was filled with meetings with govern­ment agencies. Here, we learned of the various pro­grams to help the poor. The support they provide is very minimal, and for each child a mother will only receive an extra $75.00 a month to sup­port that child. Fortunately, though, neighborhood churches often help the families. 
The highlight of the Plunge occurred that night when myself and three other girls went to stay at the Home for Battered Wives. Here, we talked with women who have left everything they owned to

get themselves and their children to a place of safety. Like us Notre Dame students, they have hopes of getting a college degree and a good job. Unlike Notre Dame stu­dents, though, these women have no place to go and will end up trapped in the vicious circle of the Welfare Depart­ment. 
Despite this situation, they retain the hope that their children will be able to finish school and go to college. The mothers stressed how lucky Notre Dame students are to be receiving such an educa­tion, and they hoped that we would be able to contribute to society to help make people's lives better. That, for myself and for the other students also, was the important les­son of the Urban Plunge--the realization that we are get­ting an education not only for ourselves, but also, and more importantly, to make a con­tribution to society. 
In essence, the Urban Plunge is the beginning of a journey of service to society. It allows one to meet people in many adverse situations and to better understand what can be done to help them. Putting this together with our education, we'll know better how to give back to society what's already been given to us.

Rowing Club captures first major regatta win 
The Rowing Club won it's first major regatta ever last weekend in the Head of the Ohio meet in Pittsburgh. The Irish, who won the Press Cup, finished first out of 13 teams in the overall standings. The attending squads included Brown, Cornell, Pittsburgh, and Villanova. 
Notre Dame came up with gold medals in the men's and women's lightweight four-person boats and the men's open four-person boat. In winning the men's open four, the Irish received the Mayor's Cup. Silver medals were awarded to the men's lightweight eight-person boat and the wo­men's open four-person boat. 
"We are very excited about winning a major regatta. The team can do nothing but improve," said crew presi­dent Mike Hammett. 
The Irish crew team will travel to Rockford, Ill., on Oct. 9 to compete in the Head of the Rocks regatta.

Walsh's third conversion at­tempt failed but Howard was unable to take the ball down the field in the remaining 15 seconds. 
Farley 8, Knott 0: Defense was the key in Farley's victory over Knott. Farley received the opening kick-off and scored on its first drive. A 40-yard run by Tammy Goodwin and the two point conversion put Farley ahead for good. 
"Their defense played in­credibly well," said Knott player Monica Martinez. "We couldn't put it in." 
Knott was also hampered by the fact that only nine team members showed up.

PW scored twice on runs by quarterback Jill Bodensteiner. Christin Swenerton was one-of­two on PAT attempts. Despite the lopsided score it was a tight, hard fought game. Inter­ceptions by Beth Bolger and Pandora Fecko came at crucial moments, and prevented Breen Phillips from scoring.

got to have enough mentally to 
go out and improve her game.'' 
Shea has been a versatile player for the Irish since arriv­ing from Erlanger, Kan., as a freshman and had to switch from middle blocker to left-side hitter and now to her position at right-side hitter. But she has no complaints. 
"I'm most comfortable as a right-side hitter," said Shea, "but you've got to be able to adjust to your role in other pos­itions. Volleyball is a game of the mind and if you can get it in your head you're going to do it, then no one's going to stop you." 
And thus far in the season, few opponents have been able to stop her, as she has recorded 95 kills, 21 blocks and 80 digs for the Irish. The possibility of playing as a professional even lurks on the horizon for Shea. 
"I want to go out and make the best of this year right now,'' said Shea. "I've learned a lot here at Notre Dame and I think decisions will come I'm ready. If its time to hang up my knee pads it is and if it isn't is isn't. Either way I'll be happy."
