Banning sale of beer by the pitcher would Cut down on drinking problems significantly, says research by a Virginia Tech psychology professor. Dr. E. Scott Geller studied drinking pat­terns of over 300 students in three campus-area bars and found stu­dents, on average, drink 35 ounces of beer per person when it's served in a pitcher. They drink an average IS ounces from a bottle and 12 ounces from a glass.

When getting ahead turns to treading water 
Brrring!!! 

Seven a.m. At the start ofthe semester, this was desig­nated time to wake up, throw on the swimsuit, and jog to the Rockne for a brisk morning dip. 
But's let's be realistic. It's almost October. Is Suzy Domer really going to get up and swim? 
Hit the snooze button. 
BRRRING!!! 

Eight a.m. Afew weeks ago, the plan was to get up in time for hot breakfast every day. Just the thing to keep the eyes open during that 9 a.m. philosophy class. Who are we kidding? Powdered eggs versus a few more minutes ofsleep? 
Slam that snooze button. 

At precisely 8:33 a.m., the proverbial Suzy Domer 
steps into the shower and in a miracle oftime efficiency 
is able to shower, dress, dry her hair, swallow half a 
Twinkie (she's dieting) and make it to class only four 
minutes late. 
When noon rolls around, the plan to skip lunch and study physics is put aside in favor of a few friends and some hot gossip. (Besides, she only had half a Twinkie for breakfast.) 
After classes, a nap wins out over the 'brar. (Or maybe a nap wins out in the 'brar.) And then, well it's al­most time for dinner... 
The start of a semester, like the beginning of a new year, is a time for resolu­tions. And the end of Sep­tember, like the end (or middle... or beginning...) of January is the time for break­ingthem. 

Few of us escape the temptation to set oh-so-lofty goals when we first enscribe our names on those deceptively clean new notebooks. 
This semester we will make it to all ofour classes, we will exercise regularly, we will eat nutritionally, we will get eight hours ofsleep every night, the Irish will win the national championship... 
And for the first few weeks/days/hours we valiantly try to live up to these standards. We might actually get up early one morning and run or, heaven forbid, read ahead in economics. 
Then one by one, the semester's goals crash down about us. Almost imperceptively, the alarm clock rings a little later (and, some would claim, a little softer) every day. 
And any surviving resolutions are sharply put to rest by that time of truth, the first round oftests. Many ofus are now, or will soon be, drowning under that first gentle downpour of major tests and papers. 
Amy Stephan 

Assistant News Editor 
Inside Thursday 

And assuming we survive the onslaught, we'll spend the rest of the semester treading water, trying to catch up, or at least stay above the surface. 
We half-heartedly reach for the remnants of our weather-beaten goals and chop them down into easy­to-digest pieces. 
We might make it to some of our classes, we might take the stairs occasionally, the Irish might win a foot­ball game ... 
And before too long, even these reduced goals have to be mopped up and trimmed down to size. We, as students, are constantly faced with impossible (or semi-impossible) tasks. And, for the most part, we rashly set out to conquer all our goals, but instead are con­quered by them. 
We could sit back and la­ment our fate as students caught in a no-win situation, or we could, perhaps, try a new approach. 
Although it seems ludi­crous, many of us believe that if we once fail to meet our goals we might as well give them up. "I didn't run yesterday, so why bother today?" Too often, one fail­
ure makes us see ourselves as failures. 
And often we try to do everything, not stepping back to see what is most important and doing that first. Set­ting priorities takes time, something most ofus have in short supply, but those who bother to set them claim it's time well-invested. 
Two embarrassingly basic ideas: set priorities and learn to take small failures in stride. Yet if all of us fol· lowed these guidelines, there would be a lot less caf­feine consumed on campus. 
So Suzy Domer floats in a current of misplaced goals, and we hear her murmur as she drifts along: "I will set priorities, I will live with failures..." 
Hang in there, Suzy. It's only September.

In precise detail, the document guarantees almost every right that Hong Kong residents now enjoy, and promises that those liberties "will remain unchanged for 50 years" after the handover date. 
The crown colony had anxiously awaited the details of the pact and first reactions to the accord there were warm. Hong Kong, with its 5.5 million people, 98 percent of them Chinese, has been the most populous and economically success­ful remnant of the once mighty British empire. 
The draft agreement was released in Hong Kong nine hours after it was Initialed in Peking by British Ambas­sador Sir Richards Evans and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Nan, the chief negotiators, in a cere­mony seen live on television in Hong Kong.

Senate approves legislation concerning health warnings 
WASHINGTON · The Senate today approved legislation replacing the general health warning on ciga­rette packages with four alternating warnings about the specific dangers associated with smoking. 
The legislation, approved on a voice vote, now goes to the House, where supporters predicted speedy approval. 
Under the amendment, a section of the bill listing the surgeon gen· eral's findings about smoking was removed from the legislation al· though it will appear in a report ac­companying the bill. 
Sen. Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., has said that was done because of con· cerns that putting the findings in the actual bill would give them the force of statutory language and, possibly, raise product liability problems. 
The surgeon general's findings state, in part, that "cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause ofill­ness and premature death in the United States, and is associated with the unnecessary deaths of over 300,000 Americans annually." 
The four new warnings would state, following "Surgeon General's Warning", that: 
·"Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy." 
·"Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health." 
-"Smoking by pregnent women may result in fetal injury, premature birth and low birth weight." 
·"Cigarette smoke contains car­bon monoxide."

But some coucil members still wanted to show it to all of the rec­tors first. "As I remember, the hall rectors had this dumped on them last time," said Tyson. "'Ibe office of Student Affairs ordered them to comply. I just want to go on the record right now by saying this vice president is not going to do that.

Dean Emil T. Hofman ofthe Fresh­man Year ofStudies said, "We (at the Freshman Year ofStudies) do not act as the agent for any major or any col­lege." He added the Freshman Year office tries to give the freshmen as much information as they want or need. 
"The principles (of counselling) are the same, whether for men or for women. There is no sex bias at all in the Freshmen Year of Studies," he said. 
Hofman added that there is a myth that men and women have different levels of academic performance at Notre Dame. He said, "The average GPA of r,;otre Dame women has an insignificant difference to the average GPA of Notre Dame men."

"I will not be put in a position where I'll be forcing hall staff to do something, because it won't work," he added. 
Rozum also held back on'support­ing the weekend. He said that, accor­ding to the new alcohol directives, the rector has to approve the admis­sion ofguests under the age of 18 to the residence hall. "I don't think they're going to let them in," he said. "Are you going to force them to go to these events?" he asked Madden and Taeyaerts. "If you don't force them, then you're going to see as much drinking as you did before." 
Rozum also had problems with Madden's claim that the hall ledgers would keep an adequate tab on where all the weekend guests were. "I've heard that song before," he said. 
may sound archaic, engineering is a relatively new field for women in our society." He said he saw the nu­merical difference of women in the respective colleges as not static and that since women have been ad­mitted to the University, the percentage of arts and letter women to total women has been dropping while the percentage ofengineering women has been rising. In 1974, Ill women graduated from Notre Dame. There were 64 arts and iet­ters graduates and only 2 engineer­ing graduates. He said it is a slow process, but it is moving toward equilibrium. 
Waddick recalled that a "woman's job" used to be in the fields of nur­sing or teaching. Now, he says, the path is opened to them in a wide va­riety offields. He said that more and more women are opting for graduate school, law school or medi­cal school. He expressed his hope that the narrowing of the gap be­tween men and women is a societal trend and is not limited to an aca­demic setting.

But Father Steven Gibson, rector ofCarroll Hall, disagreed. "I feel kind ofalone here, but I really don't share those opinions," he said. "I think one ofthe classiest things that happens at Notre Dame is the Junior Parents' Weekend. I hope U'l Sibs could be as classy an affair as that." 
Student Body President Rob Ber­tino motioned to table the issue un­til Madden and Taeyaerts could make their presentation to all of the hall rectors. The council unani­mously approved. 
In other council business, Pat Browne, student senator for district 2, offered his proposal to limit the amount of money students had to pay for books. After council discus­sion, the issue was put aside for fur­ther examination. 
and placement services, said she agrees that progress for women is not limited to academia. At entry level positions within corporations, she said, there is "straight-forward hiring" with no discrimination in­volved. She said the job market is promising for both women and men. The major discrimination seems to be in the area of advancement. "There are still certain industries that women have trouble advancing in," she said. 
Arnold added that her personal theory as to why there are fewer wo­men who choose engineering at Notre Dame is because there is a "comfort level factor" in any human enterprise. This factor is simply an indication of whether an individual fits into his or her environment with a degree of comfort. Any minority must overcome this "comfort level factor" if they are to overcome greater obstacles as they strive towards their goals, she said. 
She added that she believes it re­quires an extraordinarily talented and motivated individual to overcome these obstacles.

Decio Hall: More than brick and mortar 
On September 14th and 15th, the Decio Faculty Hall Dedication Ceremonies were held. Consisting of a liberal arts symposium, a dedication mass, a black-tie dinner, and an academic convocation, the two day affair was a momentous occasion. 
At first glance, one might think that all these events were held simply to envelop in cere­mony the grand opening ofjust another build­ing. However, upon closer inspection, one realizes the misconception in this oversimpli-
Ken Cerabona 
guest column 
,... fication. After attending these ceremonies, I soon realized that this building symbolizes 
r' 
,... much more than its simple brick and mortar ,... walls suggest. 
I"" 
This thought first occurred to me as I sat in 
r 
the back of a crowded Sacred Heart Church 
r 
on that Friday afternoon of the building'sr dedication. During the homily of this Dedica­
r 
tion Mass, the Associate Provost Father Ed­
~ 
ward Malloy said something that made me 
r 
think of Decio Hall in a new way. In essence, he said that the cross ofJesus Christ was not just an object; rather, it served as a symbol of something more. 
Concerning Decio Hall, I thought that it also stood as a symbol ofsomething more, just as the cross does, but in a dift'erent area -that is, the area ofacademia. In this area, Decio Hall takes a three-fold role. 
First, it indeed serves as a symbol of some­thing more. Decio Hall stands tall as a visible monument to Notre Dame's commitment to a liberal education. Located near O'Shaugnessy Hall and the Snite Museum ofArt, Decio's im­posing three-winged design is highly visible to anyone visiting other university landmarks, such as the Memorial Library and the football stadium. 
Second, Decio Hall serves as a working in­strument that provides a better understanding of the liberal arts to all who enter its doors. Housing the fuculty of the College ofArts and Letters in larger less crowded offices, Decio Hall tilcilitates greater opportunities for stu­dent tilculty interaction. 
Third, by no longer relegating the tilculty to the dark confines of the library basement, Decio Hall will boost tilculty dignity, morale, and efficiency. 
So thanks to the philanthropists Arthur and Patricia Decio, not to mention the visiting scholars who expounded their views on the values of a liberal education during the Dedication Ceremonies, Decio Faculty Hall is on its way to becoming a building composed of more than brick and mortar. It will become a building teeming with new life and new ideas. 
And as long as we students, regardless of our majors, journey through these halls for the purpose of broadening our intellectual horizons, Decio Faculty Hall will soon be known as a great success at the University of Notre Dame. 
P.O.BoxQ 
The Decio Foundation is a shaky base 
Dear Editor: 
After reading of the dedication day pomp and ceremony for the new "Decio Faculty Hall" building, I feel it is my duty to offer a peek behind the scene, the tilcade, and relate my first-hand experience with the Decio people. 
Besides my constant studies, I am a writer who contacted the Decio Foundation this year for help with a contractual obligation with one of my books. However, after reading in the Observer that it was stated "This is a world, and that (Decio) is a building, and we are creatures put together by words, words, words," I think it's time everyone knows where they stand when they try to communi­cate or get any assistance from the Decio Foundation. 
I presented the Decio Foundation with a professional proposal for assistance and the worst happened: not only did a large amount oftime go by with no response, but my second letter went totally unanswered even though I enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope. Delays are deadly in the publishing world. When the stated purpose of the Decio Foup­dation is "literary assistance" and the attitude shown writers is pompous and negligent, such an attitude is evidence of something bogus with the foundation and the honcho at the top who is responsible for his "empire." 
Naming a building after some questionable guy just because the bottom line of his life is big bucks is obscene. So what if he donated the mega bucks to build the hall? Why couldn't the building be named Damian Hall after the priest who was at Notre Dame several decades ago and is now being consid­ered for sainthood -or Paradis Hall after Mot­her Marie Leonie Paradis who was Beatified by Pope John Paul the same week as the Hall's dedication ceremony; or better yet "John Paul Hall" (it rhymes) knocking off two dedica­tions at once: Pope John Paul II and the Beatles! But Noooooo! The hall is not dedi­cated to greatness, or to an individual who in­spires others with their unique pain ofhuman experience, nor is the building dedicated to an expounder of inspiring philosophy on the human condition. The hall has to end up being dedicated to the immortalization ofa person's ego just because he donated money. 
I defy anyone reading this letter to attempt to get any response or assistance out of the Decio Foundation though your project may be of great importance to our nation or the enlightning of mankind. After thoroughlly ex­periencing the Decio Foundation, I feel the foundation is bogus (tax haven), I feel the dude himself is bogus and naming the hall after daddy big bucks is bogus. 
So when it comes to the tilcade of flashy banquets with world reknown university presidents and making sure the building's name is a testimony to immortalize and ag­grandize one's ego. It's thumbs up, full speed ahead! But when it comes to reality, the bot­tom line: one of us, one of the people plying the trade of arts and letters "words, words, words," and requesting a small pittance of contractual assistance for which the Decio Foundation supposedly exists, the answer to me and anyone reading this diatribe will be an invariable "Nyet."

Abandoning ulterior motives in dialogue 
"Dialogue" is one of those slippery words. Especially in an election year when it seems that everyone is eager to "engage in dialogue," "campaign on the issues" and foster "meaningful communication." 
The trouble is that it never seems to hap­pen. For instance, National Public Radio carried a report onMorning Edition last week 
Chris Robinson 
a larger view 

in which Walter Mondale was portrayed as in­creasingly pointed (some say desperate) in his attacks against Ronald Reagan. He has recently brought forth specific proposals for reducing the federal defecit. He has publicly wrestled with issues of nuclear disarmament, environmental pollution, the relationship be­tween religion and politics and the role of foreign trade as it impacts United States labor. 
Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, is be­coming more general in his remarks, more aloof and distant from the everyday, rough and tumble world ofpolitics. He is not retreat· ing, but acting from a position of strength as he maintains and, in some areas, increases his lead over Mondale in public opinion polls. NPR pointed out that Reagan isn't even bot­hering to bring up specific fssues as much as he used to, preferring instead to make ex­tremely brief speeches about "the springtime of America's greatness," patriotism and pride in the accomplishments of the last four years. The president clearly is campaigning on his past performance, whereas Mondale is run­ning on future promises, the traditional con­
frontation  between  incumbent  and  
challenger.  
The  problem  is  that  there  isn't  much  

dialogue going on. Especially during this in­tense period when U.S. citizens are making the crucial choice of a leader for the next four years. 
Politics, especially on the national level, is often centered around form instead of con­tent. Substantive presentation and discussion of issues takes a back seat to technological concerns such as camera angle, timing and style. (Not that these aren't important: Mondale's dull, haggard appearance does not play well opposite the confident, beaming Reagan bravado. 
I was sitting in a political science class taught by Dr. Fred Dallmayr the other day. A point made in his lecture reminded me of the Aristotelian concept of dialogue which might prove helpful here. As originally advanced, "dialogue" meant the process in which two or more people engaged with the express pur­pose of not only exchanging information but to become changed as a result ofthe conversa­tion. In this framework, one didn't desire dialogue in order to convert, coerce, berate, propagandize, or chastise. A person, mindful of his need to change (for whatever reason), sought dialogue to understand the other per­son's point of view as well as to modify his own. So that, together, a new relationship might be developed and progress in human endeavor might be made. 
Some attempts at this kind of communica­tion are occurring. Mario Cuomo's speech on campus two weeks ago was an excellent ex­ample of someone who has the courage to thoughtfully examine various aspects of a complex issue with a spectrum of socio­political, historic, rational and emotional dynamics. By so doing, Gov. Cuomo moved from the realm of being politician to that of a statesman, in the best tradition of whlt this country has applauded. 
Father Hesburgh has demonstrated his abil­ity to engage in what he calls "an endless con­versation." Students and faculty alike are encouraged to speak their minds, explore new alternatives and forge new _realities within the context ofinstitutional life. 
We need to abandon the habit ofdialoguing with alterior motives. We need to stop defin­ing other people in our own terms, for our own purposes, to suit our needs or to fit our conception of the world. 
Let's encourage dialogue in the highest and best sense ofthe word. Not only in politics but in other areas of our lives.

Movies 
A movie trapped in its own darkness 
by Scott Ebersol 
features staffwriter 
n the 30 years since Malcolm·
ILowry wrote "Under the Vol· 
cano," screenwriters and directors 
alike have attempted to bring this 
stirring and psychological novel to 
the screen. John Huston, director of 
such films as "Night of the Iguana" 
and "A Man Who Would be King," 
finally undertook the project. 
The most fascinating aspect of Huston's film resides in the charac· ter of the Consul. The entire film takes place on one Mexican day ·· Nov. 2, 1938, the "Day of the Dead." The Consul, Geoffrey Firmin (played by Albert Finney), Is slowly 
drinking himself to death while he broods over the affair between his ex-wife Yvonne (Jacquallne Bisset) and his half brother (Anthony Andrews). At the same time he is worrying over the lmmlnensc ofanother world war. 
The film offers a strong central theme which Is revealed through the Consul. Through this character, the dramatic issues ofpersonal betrayal and the tragedy of the times arc visualized. Finney gave a powerful performance worthy of another Academy nomination. Hutson, being intrigued with doomed heroes In previous films, portrays the Consul as a tragic hero. Due to Finney's performance, the Consul becomes a standard "HuL~on" hero, oneaccepts one who accepts fate as he realizes he 
cannot change its circumstances. 
The Consul's reaction to the 
turmoil around him is to get drunk. 
He is seen shaking on the screen ·· 
drunk In a heroic way. When he is 
supposed to be drunk, he is. Not a 
comic drunk or an exaggerated one~ 
for realistically, Finney offers the 
audience an intelligent man ·· a man 
smothered in passions and Ian· 
guage. 
To present the novel on film, screenwriter Guy Gallo chips at its complex literary style, moving to the heart ofthe plot, and filling what remains with Finney's perfor· mance. 
Unlike the book, in which a nar· rator supplies the background and insight through one long flashback, Gallo and Huston have eliminated the narrator in hope ofproviding a linear profile surrounding the three major characters. However, by removing the narrator's internal viewpoint, the film becomes a flat vision. 
Mexico provides a powerful backdrop: the encompassing macabre ofskulls, skeletons and demons on the Day ofthe Dead (when spirits come back). The plot itself, however, is sporadic and sequential. Finney's performance can only partially connect the story, supplying an image oflonely self· pity and mockery. 
The conclusion of"Under the Volcano" is clearly tragic in order 
to typify the Consul's crumbling 
life. Dying, the Consul utters the 
final words: "Christ, what a dingy 
way to die." Through the power 
and realism ofhis performance, 
Finney reveals a remarkable man ·· 
he elevates a simple death while 
Huston evokes enormous power 
and sympathy. 
However, while Finney's perfor· mance and Huston's cinematic skills provide the heart ofthe film, the supporting roles remain far removed. The characters ofthe Consul's ex-wife and halfbrother·· essential to understanding Firmin's tragedy ·· are flat and undeveloped. The three-fold relationship Huston and Gallo hoped to portray fails. Finney's role and performance simply overpower the rest ·· only the landscape remains intact. 
Lowry described his novel as a political warning, a "cryptogram," a story ofa tragic world. Huston's adaptation, although courageous and engulfing, simply relies on the Consul to grandize the world. While the Consul stands isolated against the jungled backdrop, "Under the Volcano" moves deeper into its own darkness, only to get trapped with no place to go. 
It must be kept in mind, however, that a film and a novel can never be compared on the same level. Hus· ton's rendition, in this light, offers an artistic attempt to move inside the Consul's drunken mind, offering the audience the story ofa man tragically destroyed by his own distorted imagination. 
Movies The Karate Kid: 
enjoyable but unbelievable 

by Paul Cimino 
features staff writer 
I 
walked into the theater with the intention ofseeing 
a movie and noticed that I had a choice between 
"lbe Karate Kid" and "Bolero." Bo Derek would 
definitely have entertained me; however, a little voice 
In my head told me that I should see "The Karate Kid." 
As usual, the voice wasn't wrong. 
"lbe Karate Kid" is the story of Daniel Laruso (played by Ralph Macchio), an Italian kid from Newark, New jersey. As the movie begins, he and his mother move west to California because she was promised a job with an up-and-coming computer company. Daniel immediately makes a new friend and is invited to a beach party. At the party he meets a girl named Alli (pronounced "alley") (played by Elizabeth Shuc ), and they become good friends right away. Alii's ex-boyfriend shows up, however, with his motorcycle· riding gang ofkarate friends. Being the new kid on the block, Daniel defends Alii and gets beaten up. Needless to say, the gang refuses to leave him alone, and he 
Father Gerald J. Merkel 
continually returns home with new bruises on his face. 
Meanwhile, Daniel has used his spare time to 
become good friends with Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' 
Morita), the fix-it man at his apartment complex. After 
Miyagi saves Daniel from the gang, he agrees to 
accompany the boy to the local karate house and talk 
with the gang's karate teacher to see if a truce can be 
arranged. Following a strange bit ofdialogue, Miyagi 
and Daniel get their truce; however, Daniel must 
participate in the region's karate tournament in a 
month 3nd a half. The story continues in a "Rocky" 
type fashion and builds in intensity and feeling to a 
fantastic climax as Daniel finally faces Alii's ex· 
boyfriend on even terms. 

As for the actors, Ralph Macchio is terrific as Daniel. 
He plays the part as if he really is a misplaced New 
jersey boy who was trying desperately to fit in. Ifhe 
looks a little familiar, you may remember he got his 
break playing in "One Day At a Time." The biggest 
problem one notices with a venture onto the big 
screen is that he looks too young to fit in with the rest 
of the actors. This fact is especially evident when both 
he and Alii are pictured in the same shot. In any event, 
he is still able to portray Daniel effectively. 
Pat Morita is excellent as Mr. Miyagi. His character must teach Daniel that karate must not be used for revenge but instead, to avoid fights. He at the same time teaches Daniel about life, and is instrumental in his growth. On the lighter side, it's great to see Morita back. His part ofArnold on "Happy Days" was always funny, and while he does not play a comic part in this film, it is good to see he has not yet retired. 
Unfortunately, the rest of the movie goes predominantly downhill. While the acting is not the worst I have ever seen, it is, at any rate, mediocre. The script, however, was a bigger disappointment. Many of the crucial scenes seem unbelievable and corny lines abound. Had the time been taken to dream up a truly believable script with truly believable characters, this movie would have been more than just "Good." To further attest to the rushed feeling and obvious low budget associated with this film, there was actually one scene in which the viewer sees a boom microphone enter the frame for a short period of time. 
But don't let these things stop you from going to see this movie. All things considered, "The Karate Kid" is an extremely enjoyable movie and well worth the price ofadmission. It is currently playing at the Forum Cinema and tickets are available at the S.U. Record store for a very affordable 52.50. At that price, you will definitely have a worthwhile time. 
The story of a drunk driver 

AssociatedPress 
LOSAngeles .. One month before Gary Christopher was to join the ranks ofprofessional bowlers, a punch press crushed three fingers on his bowling hand so badly they had to be amputated. 
The day the doctor gave him that news 19 years ago, Christopher went out and got drunk. And he kept on drinking, eventually running up a total of 27 drunken-driving convictions. 
Christopher, 38, is now in jail, where he has been on seven other occasions. 
Unless the state Court ofAppeals reduces a term ordered Sept. 10, he will serve a prison sentence ofnearly 10 years, one of the stiffest ever delivered in a drunken-driving case where nobody was injured. 
"These were all victimless misdemeanors," said his attorney, Leonard Chaitin, who called the sentence "outrageous" and is appealing it as excessive. 
In an interview last week, Chaitin said Christopher makes a "good salary," is a "capable worker" and works hard writing up bids for a solar construction firm. 
"I myself think the guy's not really a criminal. He's a very gentle person," he said. 
But City Attorney Ira Reiner said Christopher got what he deserves .. "the largest sentence imposed anywhere for drunk driving, as far as we know." 
The seven previous jail sentences ranged from a "five-day slap on the wrist" to one year, he said. 
"Nothing works," Reiner said. "The only thing you can do now is worry more about the public and warehouse him.... It's clear he has driven thousands oftimes under the influence ofalcohol to have been caught and convicted on 27 separate occasions. It's astonishing he hasn't killed someone, but he's just a homicide waiting to happen." 
But Chaitin said Christopher is a man devastated, a sad story, a problem in need ofa solution. "He was a pro bowler, and his whole life went out the window," said his wife, Brenda. 
Apre-sentencing court psychiatric report said Christopher had bowled "in the high 200s in high school with an occasional perfect game" and had qualified to join the pro tour in September or October 1965. The accident occurred that August. 
"Within 24 hours oflearning ofthe amputation, the patient went with a friend and drank quite heavily," the report said."...Mr. Christopher has never accepted the loss of the fingers on his right hand. He is reluctant to discuss it." Chaitin said his client has refused all news interviews. 
"Everybody has a story," said Reiner, "and how much there is to that .. who knows?'Secondly, we're talking 20 years later. Lots of people have industrial accidents where they lose a finger or two. That does not excuse a lifetime ofendangering other people's lives." 
Reiner consolidated four drunken driving arrests over eight months into one case, which also included four counts ofdriving with a restricted or revoked license. 
Still pending is a july 27 drunken-driving offense that Chattin said occurred while Christopher was free on bail ·· one reason Reiner opposed bail reduction from $500,000 pending appeal in the case. 
The son ofa career soldier, Christopher "describes his parents as strict but not cruel disciplinarians," the psychiatric report said. Christopher drinks, it said, to cover up intense feelings about his injury that well up during times ofstress. 
The highest blood-alcohol concentrations Christopher showed in any ofhis cases were 0.30 and 0.28 percent, Chaitin said. California's tough 1981 drunken-driving law makes it a crime to drive with 0.10 blood-alcohol and Increases sentences according to the number ofprior convictions. 
A 0.30 was the highest official blood-alcohol reading that could be remembered by Clay Hall, chiefofprogram development for the federal Office ofAlcohol Countermeasures at the Department of Transportation In Washington, though he's heard unofficial reports ofhigher levels. 
A 0. 50 reading is generally considered the threshhold where coma or death may occur. 
"We estimate that at least 50 percent ofall highway fatalities are the result ofdrinking and driving," National Safety Council spokesman Dick Tippie said in Chicago. Last year, there were 44,600 highway fatalities nationwide. 
What can be done about chronic cases like Christopher, Reiner was asked. 
"Not a thing," he said. "When someone is such a recidivist as this person is, only he can deal with that. Obviously such a person as this has to go to AA (Alcoholics Anonymous)." 
Hall, commenting on the general problem but not Christopher's case specifically, said, "I think AA is very good, but for a person to go to AA he must want to go to AA." 
Abby Baker, Los Angeles assistant director of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, called Christopher "a timebomb waiting to explode." 
Ms. Baker, who like many MADD members was the victim ofa drunken driver, suffered broken bones, internal injuries and "couldn't walk for about six months" after a drunken driver struck the disabled car in which she was sitting 11 years ago. 
"The drunk driver saw the hazard lights and crashed right into it. He didn't go to jail," she said. "It's MADD's general position (to impose) punishment first, rehabilitation second."

president), and Mellin (treasurer). 
Right now most ofthe funding for the soccer club comes from the members, who pay their own dues, and contributions from the Athletic Department and Student Activities. Uniforms, league registration, referees, traveling expenses, practice and game balls are among the many expenses of the soccer club. 
On Friday, the players are going to 
present a proposal to Dr. Jack Dug­
gan, the president of Saint Mary's, 
and the officers of the college, and 
will soon know their chances of be~ 
coming a varsity sport at St. Mary's. 
The players hope to gain entrance 
into the NAJA, and to be able to com­
pete in the National Championships. 
The team's next home game is Sat­

continued from page 12 

Jackson would rather talk about the team's goals than his own. 
"I'm a team player so team goals come first," Jackson said. "I want us to get to a major bowl, but my short range goal is the Missouri game." 
Jackson's personal goals are in keeping with his character, men­tioning academics before football. 
"Academically, I want to get above a 3.5 grade point average and make the dean's list," the Irish flanker said. "Athletically, as long as I do my part to help the team go to a 
major bowl,  that  is  my  ultimate  
goal."  
Jackson  definitely  has  a  bright  

future ahead in both athletics and academics. He is not sure whether he will play professional football or pursue a career in accounting. No matter what he decides, he undoub­tably will be successful at it.

Holmes to fight Smith, snubs Gerrie Coetzee 
The Observer Thursday, September 27, 1984-page 10 
Ferguson injured 
Buffalo QB situation up in air 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Unbeaten Larry Holmes, casting aside Gerrie Coet­zee, will fight james "Bonecrusher" Smith for the International Boxing Federation heavyweight title Nov. 9 when he continues his quest to 
catch the ghost ofRocky Marciano. 
"I'm going to let that fight die," Holmes said at a news conference yesterday, referring to his proposed bout against Coetzee, the World Boxing Association champion. 
Holmes had hoped to make his first fight this year for promoter Don King against the WBA titleholder from South Africa. But that fight was blocked, at least temporarily, when Holmes lost a lawsuit filed by Vir­ginia attorney Richard Hirschfeld. 
Hirschfeld contended he had a contract with Holmes that gave him first refusal on a Holmes-Coetzee fight. 
A Holmes-Coetzee fight is the most eagerly awaited bout in the scrambled heavyweight division that has three champions -Holmes, Coetzee and World Boxing Council titleholder Pinklon Thomas. 
"I think Coetzee will lose the title, he's not that good a fighter," added Holmes, who will take a 45-0 record with 32 knockouts into the ring at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., against the little-known, lightly re­garded Smith, 14-1 with 12 knock­outs. 
The timetable for Holmes, who will be 35 on Nov. 3, calls for him to fight five more times. If he wins all five, he would be 50-0 -and surpass the late Marciano's unblemished record of49-0. 
"That's a goal," Holmes said. "You have to have goals ifyou're going to stay in the game. My goal is to· pass Rocky Marciano's record. There is nothing else to fight for. 
"I want to go down in immor­tality. I want people to remember me." 
Smith is ranked only 11th in the heavyweight division by the IBF, ninth by the WBA and 15th by the WBC. That's why when the fight was announced, it quickly came under much criticism as a mismatch. 
Holmes said that unifying the divi­sion also was one ofhis objectives. 
"I don't want any more initial (i.e., IBF, WBA, WBC) champions," he said. "I want one champion.' 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOUS -There was an air of mystery as the Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills prepared for their Sunday Na:tional Football League date in 1the Hoosier Dome. 
The Colts, still seeking their first league victory in their new home, didn't know if the Bills would have veteran Joe Ferguson at quarter­back. 
Ferguson suffered a severely sprained ankle in the closing minutes of last Sunday's 28-26 loss to the New York jets and was listed as "doubtful" on the Bills' injury report for the game. 
Buffalo Coach Kay Stephenson an­nounced yesterday that joe Dufek would start at quarterback in In­dianapolis ifFerguson wasn't able to play. 
Dufek, who helped Yale win an Ivy League title as a senior, has never taken a snap in a regular season NFL game. Dufek, signed by the Bills as a free agent in july 1983, threw 50 passes and completed 26 for 293 yards and one touchdown in three preseason games this year. He was intercepted twice. 
The other Bills' backup quarter­back, Matt Kofler, went into the jets game after Ferguson was hurt. He threw five passes with a completion and was intercepted once. 
Buffalo is winless after four out­ings, but the Colts can't be over­confident after being humiliated 44-7 by the Miami Dolphins last 
week. The Bills lost to Miami by only
