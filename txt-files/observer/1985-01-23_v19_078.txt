China's National People's Congress will 
meet in late March to approve the agreement that will bring Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday. The Hong Kong pact was signed Dec. 19 in Peking by Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Zhao Zlyang of China. The pact transfers sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease on the colony expires. China has pledged to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist way oflife for 50 years. The agreement requires approval of the British Parliament and the Chinese National People's Congress, a largely ceremonial legislative body. -AP

Notre Dame gets trivial 
. 
What did Rector "Pop" Farley distribute from the 

front ofSarin porch three times daily? 
Who designed Notre Dame Stadium? 
What is the average depth ofSt. Mary's Lake on the 

NDcampus? 
The answers to these and 1,005 other questions 

about Notre Dame can be found in the newest trivia 
game "Fightin' Irish 'Facts,"' (as well as at the bottom of 
this column). The game is currently being sold at the 
Hammes bookstore, at area retail stores, and through 
the mail to anybody who thinks he or she knows anyth­
ing about the University and has I 5 dollars to try and 
prove it. 
The game is similar to "Trivial Pursuit" in that each 

player must answer questions in each of four areas 
(Football, University ofNO, Round Ball and Potpourri), 
and then race back to the center ofthe board to answer 
a question of the other 
player's choice. But unlike 
that other trivia game, the 
questions in "Fightin' Irish 
'Facts"' are supposedly 
about the University.

The company is licensed through Cham­pion Products, the University's official licenser. According to a spokesman for Time Check, the com­pany is selling "a lot" ofgames. "Sales are phenomenal," he said. The game was first introduced in late Novem­ber of last year, just in time for the Christmas season. Representatives from Time Check first passed out fliers advertising the trivia game at a Notre Dame football game and sacks full of orders have been coming in the mail daily ever since. The game has only recently been sold at stores. Researchers for the game visited campus last sum­mer, using the Library and the Archives as well as talking to anybody who would talk to them in develop­ing the game's questions. And some of them would give even the most ardent Notre Dame fan fits:

Civil rights groups clash with Dole 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Major civil rights groups are moving toward a con­frontation with Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole over legislation to restore anti-discrimination protection to female, handicapped, elderly and minority Americans. 
Civil rights forces and Dole are preparing vastly different versions of anti-bias bills to restore safeguards lost in a Supreme Court ruling. The outcome could help test the Kansas Republican in his new job as floor leader. 

 
Dole will anger conservatives ifhe expands civil rights laws, and be rebuked by liberals if he refuses to restore the broad safeguards they support. 
For now, Dole has sided with the conservatives, the Reagan adminis­tration and parts of the business community in deciding just how much protection is needed to restore the status quo from before the ruling. 
Their narrowly constructed bill may be introduced this week, as may the liberals' version sponsored by Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and many others.

Aides to Dole, calling him a "master of compromise," say he plans to get some form oflegislation through the Senate and not let the issue die there as it did in a conserva­tive illibuster in the waning days of the last session. 
The liberals' bill passed the House 375-32 last June and is expected to win there again by an overwhelming margin.

Extreme cold blamed for frozen ceiling pipes in Badin laundry room 
By MARKS. PANKOWSKI 
News Staff 
The recent cold temperatures have frozen pipes in the Badin laundry annex area, causing leaks and temporarily shutting down the laundry's washers. 
Cold temperatures were also re­sponsible for a leak discovered in the first floor ceiling of Washington Hall. 
The leaks caused no significant damage in either incidence. 
According to John Moorman, director of maintenance, the laundry annex leak was a result of someone leaving the laundry's main doors open. 
"Apparently this was a very unus­ual case," said Moorman., "It appears someone left the main doors open which is the only way the pipes could have frozen. It had to be a tre­mendous onrush of cold air (to freeze the pipes)." 
The maintenance department turned off the water in the laundry room Monday evening after dis­covering the leak. The pipe was fixed yesterday morning and the washers were back in service later that evening. 

Maintenance found Washington · Hall's leak in the fire protection sprinkler line early yesterday mor­ning. As of yesterday_ afternoon, the maintenance department was repairing the pipe. That pipe's water has been turned offbut the building still has adequate fire protection, ac­cording to Moorman. 
Moorman said that yesterday's leak was unrelated to the leak which flooded Washington Hall earlier in the schoolyear. 
After an investigation, it was dis­covered that the sprinkler system's pipes froze because a student left a window open after Saturday night's Father Guido Sarducci show. 
"The problem is like anywhere else on campus," said Moorman. "If you leave open windows when you have sub-zero temperatures, (the pipes) are bound to freeze."

Sienkiewicz said the winning ideas will be reviewed by the appro­priate campus department. For ex­ample, the idea about painting the water tower will be given to Mainte­nance for consideration. He said he encourages students who favor an idea to support it by writing to the appropriate department or the ad­ministration.

Students use their training overseas with the AIESEC work experience 
ByANN KALTENBACH 
StaffReporter 
Gaining business experience, self­confidence and knowledge is the desired product of AIESEC, accor­ding to Mark Herkert, the Executive Vice President of the chapter at Notre Dame. 
AIESEC is an international organi­zation devoted to global manage­ment and leadership development. It is a student non-profit organiza­tion which seeks to identify and train a select group ofstudents with outstanding leadership potential in business and related fields. 
AIESEC is the French acronym for !'Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales. 
"The knowledge learned by working abroad is so practical be­cause it involves basic marketing techniques which can be applied to almost any field," said Herkert. "The group is located worldwide and it can be found in 60 countries, among 400 universities and on 60 college campuses." 
Herkert said,"AIESEC came into existence after World War II. Its pur­pose was to patch relations between countries and to promote under­standing through students." 
Notre Dame's AIESEC chapter has existed since 1964. According to Herkert, its success has been cycli­cal. 
Notre Dame's AIESEC group belongs to the central region in the United States. Its boundaries extend to Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Gary,Ind. 
Herkert said,"Basically, we con­tact international corporations in­terested in the international realm of business and we do a marketing call. We inform them of the benefits of AIESEC. In effect, we are a place­ment agency." 
He added,"We work to bring over highly motivated, cost efficient stu­dents with bachelor's or master's degrees to the United States to work." 
Herkert said, foremost among AIESEC's international development programs is this traineeship ex­change. Each year, AIESEC-U.S. places over 300 foreign students in 
U.S. companies with an equal num­ber of American students placed abroad. These trainees may hold jobs in accounting, finance, market­ing, computer science and other business-related fields. 
"Students fill out an application in which they can specify which country, business, and role of re­sponsibility they are seeking," said Herkert. 
"Companies also ftle applications for the type of trainee they want. These applications are then matched at the International Congress and students are selected." 
The reciprocal nature of this pro­gram allows an American student the opportunity to work abroad every time an American employer accepts a trainee from another country. In effect, American stu­dents can learn practical business skills through the contribution of corporate participants. 
On the Notre Dame campus, AIESEC has 45 members who pay a $20 yearly membership fee. General member meetings are held once a week. 
"AIESEC is open to anyone," said Herkert. "It is in no way restricted to business majors. It is helpful to have taken a few business courses and to know a foreign language, but it cer­tainly is not required." 
He continued,"Americans are in high demand abroad. likewise, the United States offers responsibility roles higher than any country, so its trainees are extremely qualified." 
Presently, Notre Dame graduates are working through AIESEC in Australia, Amsterdam and West Ger­many according to Herkert. In ex­change, South Bend is hosting two students from West Germany and one from Poland. 
"This year, seven students have applied for internships abroad so seven jobs must also be found in the South Bend area." he said. 
Foreign students coming to South Bend are placed at Miles Laboratory, Croweshizek (an accounting fum), First Source Bank and at the Univer­sity itself. 
"Member students of AIESEC re­search hundreds of companies, write introduction letters to them and make follow-up calls and ap­pointments," said Herkert, adding that conferences are held periodi­cally. 
"Ten students from the local com­mittee attended the National Conference in Boulder, Colo. from Dec. 26, 1984, to Jan. I, 1985. Northwestern will host the spring regional. Included in it will be prod­uct seminars and a discussion of marketing and exchange tech­niques." 



Next weekend, Notre Dame will  
sponsor a local presidents meeting  
for the central region, in which ap­ 
proximately 40 to 60 people will at­ 
tend.  
Herkert said,"It is not a  
moneymaking venture. It's an expe­ 
rience you can't beat and looks great  
on a resume. Nonetheless AIESEC  
requires committed students."  
One such student is Joan De  
Crane , a fifth year Notre Dame engi­ 
neering student.  
De Crane participated in the  
AIESEC exchange in Lodz, Poland  
duringjuly and August of 1984.  
"I went to Austria on the In­ 
nsbruck program," said De  
Crane,"and became interested in  
going abroad. The AIESEC experi­ 
ence is different, however, from  
traveling because you get to see  
things as they really are."  
De Crane was placed i1 a textile  
mill where she learned about  
machines and the assembly process.  
Commenting on the unstable  
Polish environment De Crane  
said,"Martial law was not i··. exis­ 
tence when I was there. S(;lidarity  
was alive though. No one, however,  
would mention it out loud. The  
Polish people believe in five or six  
years solidarity will either be very  
successful or it will die forever. They  
believe that the fighting between  
liberals and conservatives hurt the  
movement."  
She added,"People knew  
thought the Socialist movement was  
absurd. The people also realized that  
the products they were producing  
were ofinferior quality."  
According to De Crane, the Polish  
economic system lacked common  
sense. "Things like butter were ra­ 
tioned which weren't in short  
supply."  
De Crane had little difficulty re­ 
ceiving her visa into the country.  
She also noted the friendliness ofthe  
Polish people saying,"I made a lot of  
good friends."  
AIESEC Reception Officer De  
Crane said,"The most important  
thing I learned was ~at we are lucky  
enough to be born in the United  
States. We should never feel that  
things here are too hard. We have so  
many opportunities to do whatever  
we want."  
De Crane said that AIESEC mem·  
bers applying for traineeships  
should stress their capabilities to  
their company because employers  
are often afraid to offer foreign stu·  
dents greater responsibilities. Spending up  1.,,,, 1

Associated Press  ~ 

WASHINGTON -The nation's economy got "a real kick" from con­sumer spending in the last quarter of 1984 to cause the sharpest annual growth rate in more than three decades and prompt Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige to proclaim "everything is on course." 
President Reagan, told of the report in advance, had been unable \ to restrain himself Monday night , during a tour of inauguration balls and said one of the Commerce De­partment figures released yesterday would be the best since 1951. 
That turned out to be the 6.8 per­cent 1984 growth rate, which got a ., boost at the end from revision ofthe ., fourth quarter estimate from 2.8 1 
percent to 3.9 percent. That fourth quarter figure is subject to yet an­other adjustment next month. 
The 1951 growth rate was 8.3 per­cent.

Girl with vertical hair may opt for Morning 'Do 
by Joe Kapitan 
}eatures staff writer 
A 
strange thing happened in theology class the other day. I could not fall asleep. Not knowing how to deal with this novel situa­tion, I decided to to try concentrat­ing on the lecture. Feeling restless, I began to glance around the auditorium. It seemed that I was the only one suffering from insomnia. And then I saw her· the Girl with the Vertical Hair. 
Not wanting to stare at her, I looked away. My curiosity got the best ofme and I glanced her way again. Yep, it was still sticking up. I could not understand this. Had gravity reversed itself lately? Had the wind begun blowing upward from the ground? I suddenly felt an incredible urge to smooth her hair down with the nearest heavy ob· ject. 
She was not the only one, either. There were several other Spikcheads scattered among the class, as well as a few Bowlcuts and Rat· tails. The Rat· tails really both­ered me because I could swear I heard their little voices inside my head, pleading with me to cut them offand set them free. lfl had been carrying a pair ofscissors, it would have been a messy scene. 
I sat there, stunned. What had 
happened to these innocent stu· 

I dents? Was it cruel experimentation 
r performed by blind · folded barber 
school students? Or was it the result 
ofaccidents involving power tools? 
Determined to get to the bottom of 
this mystery, I decided to do a little 
investigating of my own. 
The next day, I disguised myself in baggy pants and an Army jacket and entered The Nazz, where I proceeded to "hang out." Soon I spotted them · a group ofaverage · looking students talking in the corner. Confident of my disguise, I moved closer. Suddenly, I was paralyzed with fear. One of them had noticed me. Thinking fast, I flashed them a peace sign and said, "No nukes, man. Cut defense spend· ing. Save the whales." I was in· stantly accepted into the group and was asked if I would consider being a Democratic candidate for the presidency in I988. I was not feeling well. 
I followed them to a "salon" in town. The sign read "Exclusive Hair Creations by Mr. jerome." The hair on my neck began to crawl. Cautiously, I followed them inside. I was shocked. The interior was filled with mirrors and tropical plants. A Village People song pervaded the air. 
Mr. jerome greeted us in a satin shirt, unbuttoned to his navel. Grab­bing one member of the group, he approached what looked like a bath tub. Sensing trouble, I moved closer. The victim had entered the tub. Mr. jerome filled it with water and, with a giggle of joy, picked up several small electrical appliances and dropped them in. In a second, it was over. 
It all made sense now. Don King. Tina Turner. Buckwheat. It was all so simple· one good jolt of electricity could turn anyone into a Spikehead. And with the invention ofstylin~ "mousse," (which is French for "glue") anyone can make their hair permanently verti· cal in the privacy oftheir own home. Once again, technology is at the heart ofthe problem. 
It is time to make a stand. Enough is enough. Let's stamp out techno · hairdos and return to Nature's way· The Morning 'Do. Tomorrow mor­ning, when you wake up, don't touch your hair. Look in the mirror. Overnight, Mother Nature has created a work ofart. You can be sure that no one else will have a hairdo just like yours. Each day brings an exciting new creation. No two are ever the same. One mor­ning, it might be fluffy on the sides but flat on top, as if someone dropped an anvil on your head. The next day, it might be pressed flat on one side but puffy on the other, which makes it look like you spent the night standing sideways in a wind tunnel. The possibilities are endless. You are guaranteed ofa

F 
fragile it is · and that anything you have is a gift." Like most Associates, 
,.. Fitzpatrick considers it a great gift to have participated in the Holy
r 
r Cross Program. Often ignored, the Holy Cross Associates Program is an alternative for Notre Dame and St. Mary's graduates who want to serve God and neighbor in a basic and substantial way. 
lbe Program began in I978 with the Portland, Oregon community. Since then, HCA community have expanded to a total offour in the United States: Portland, Oregon, Hayward, California, Colorado Springs, Colorado and Avondale, Arizona. To date, 109 people have completed their service In the U.S.A., while 24 others are currently participating In one year HCA pro­grams In America. Currently, HCA also sends associates abroad to El Translto and Santiago, Chile for two and a half year commitments. 
Associate living conditions vary with each program, but generally conditions are both simple and sufficient. "Our house in Santiago (the capital ofChile) was a very 

comfortable five bedroom house," 
said Stacy Hennessy, a 198I Notre 
Dame graduate and former Associ­
ate in Chile. 
In the rural areas ofChile, condi­tions were rougher. "It was kind of like living in the U.S. at the turn of the century," said Hennessy. "There was no electricity except for bat­tery for battery -powered radios. You were thrown into a time warp." 
Any discomfort brought on by living conditions however, seems to have been negated by a sense of community. "Community life with five other people who are sup­portive makes it a lot easier to do service," said Mimi McKelley, a 1983 graduate ofSt. Mary's who served a one year commitment in Avondale, Arizona. 
While at Avondale, a poor mi­grant community, McKelley also noticed a strong bond between the community at large and the As­sociates. "There was a real experl. ence ofparish," she said. "When we moved in there was nothing in the house. People just came up to us and gave us lamps and things. By the second day we had to give stuff away." 
Many ofthe jobs held by As­sociates in the program involve teaching in some capacity. Hen­nessy and Fitzpatrick both taught during their commitments. Hen­nessy taught seventh and eighth graders, while Fitzpatrick in­structed pre-college level students in economics. HCA also offers a good deal ofother social service jobs, as well as some peace and justice work. 
Mimi McKelley, for instance, established a new position at Avondale-she was coordinator of an interdenominational Emergency Assistance Program. "It provided everything from food to clothing to legal assistance," she said. "Avondale is the last McDonald's before the desert and often migrant workers simply run out ofgas out there. They need money to get somewhere with facilities to assist them." 
In speaking with the Associates, it seems there are more rewards in HCA than hardships. "The most exciting thing was discovering the universality of man," said Hennessy. "You can commune with another person even though you might not speak their language. There is some­thing universal between people and I think that quality is the desperate need to love and be loved. As Chris­tians we have been loved by God and we can share that." 
"Notre Dame and St. Mary's graduates take very influential position in our society," Fitzpatrick observed. "Ifour grads have an experience like this -getting a braoder, more just view ofthe world -then when they become influential it will be reflected in the society, hopefully." 
The application deadline for 
I985 graduates ofND and SMC is 
February I. HCA has a fairly 
rigorous acceptance process in­
cluding several interviews and a 
lengthy written application. 
However difficult the process may be, former Associate agree that the Holy Cross Associate Program should be recommended highly to graduates. "Maybe you don't know it when you go down there," said Hennessy. "But no matter how much you give, it does more good for you than you do for the situa­tion." 
"I worked hard," said John Fitzpatrick. "But whatever you do there you get it back a thousand­fold." 

totally individual look every day, and it requires no effort on your part. 
Think of the money you could save. No more blow dryers. No more curling irons. No more jars of styling mousse. And best ofall, no more thirty dollar visits to Mr. 

jerome, which would force him and 
all his satin -shirted friends out of business. They would pack up and return to San Francisco, Vertical Hair would lie flat again as it should, and the world would be happy once

New Edition, new heroes 
Associated Press 
A
bout four years ago, Ralph 
Tresvant recalls, he and four 
pals barely into their teens 
polished up theirjackson Five 
routine and entered a talent 
contest hoping to win some 
money "to go to the movies or 
to go out and eat pizza." 
The scheme worked -perhaps 
too well. Today, Tresvant and his 
colleagues in New Edition are 
becoming as well known as their 
one-time inspirations. In fact, 
New Edition's I983 hit, "Candy 
Girl," was No. I on music charts 
at a time when Michael jackson's 
"Beat It" was No. 2. 
With Tresvant's silky adoles­
cent tenor on lead, "Cool It 
Now" recently cracked the Top 
5 on the pop charts. 
So pocket money is no longer 
a problem for the quintet -ran­
ging in age from I 5 years old to 
1 7 years old -who grew up to· 
gether in Boston's inner city 
Roxbury district. 
But the pizza parlors and movie palaces where they once planned to spend their windfall are off limits, because their recent public appearances have drawn fans by the thousands and caused near-riots. 
In Los Angeles, 2,000 people spent the rainy Saturday after Thanksgiving waiting for New Edition outside a record store. In North Carolina, a shopping mall banned promotional events after some 5,000 teen-agers showed up for a similar in-store promo­tion by the band. 
New Edition mania has caught a lot ofpeople by surprise, in­cluding the group's members. But in retrospect, Tresvant has an explanation. 
"The kids our age really didn't have anyone to look up to, to idolize," he said, sitting at a hotel room table with bandmates Michael Bivins and Ronald De Voe. 

"The girls didn't have a group that they could go screaming after," Tresvant continued. "They had a lot ofactors, hut they didn't really have any sing~ ers their age that they could say, 'I want to marry him someday.' So we came in at the right time.'' 
"We never fantasized anything like this," added Bivins, who looks younger than his 16 years but has one of tht: deeper voices in the group. 
"We just wanted to enter for the money part, to get the prizes. That's all we were heading for. We all wanted to he known around the Boston area · the regional action-but that's as big as we wanted it, really. Then it took off nationally and it still hasn't hit us just yet." 
In the 1981 talent show where they got their big break, they were one of82 acts that each had five minutes to impress the judges. Only the winner was supposed to get a record deal, and New Edition came in second. But producer Maurice Starr, who sponsored the show, saw in them as potential "Jacksons of the '80s," and he had them record the "Candy Girl" single and album for the independent Streetwise label. 
However, Starr did not sign the youths to a multi-album deal, so they were immediately picked up by MCA records, which brought in several pro· ducers for the "New Edition" album, including Ray ParkerJr., Michael Sembello and Dick Rudolph and the team ofVincent Brantley and Rick Timas, who were responsible for "Cool It Now.".

ONE GIANT ~"FOR MANKIND 
Continuing with school may be the best idea yet 
Even the most understanding parents usually expect to see something concrete done with a college education for which they probably spent thousands ofhard-earned dol­lars. Many demand that the the recipient of this education find some form ofemployment. As a result, the task of finding a job is part of most senior lives these days. Being a Rhodes 
Mark Boennighausen 
Gravity is a myth 
Scholar, entering military service, or going on to law or medical school may keep some people out ofthe job hunt for a time, but most seniors do go through the process. 
It is a process that I have found to be less enjoyable than producing a 50-page term paper on the possibility of nuclear war begin­ning with a terrorist threat to destroy the Hoosier Dome. 
Personally, I had no problems with the preliminaries involved. I did my goal self­analysis as suggested by the helpful career placement people and discovered exactly what type ofwork I wanted. The results ofmy analysis were: a job with a high salary coupled with challenging and interesting work. Fur­thermore, the job needs to be located in some warm part of the country. South Bend is definitely not in the running. 
After this brillant deduction, I created my resume. Although somewhat more difficult then the self-analysis, the finished product did turn out well. I was able to summarize my work experience neatly and succintly on one eight-by-eleven piece of paper. The descrip­tion ofmy varied summer and school employ­ment sounds very impressive when the correct creative phrases are used. For exam­ple, the experience and skills gained by being a salesperson for a garden center are many when one reflects on the exact nature of the job. Specifically, "interfacing between the customer and the merchandise" (this descrip­tion was used to emphasize my technical background) was just one of the skills I developed during by tenure at the neighbor­hood garden complex. 
Resume in hand, I entered the somewhat strange world of the job interview. A world where every action can be sign of a person's competence or incompetence. To be prepared, I practiced keeping eye contact with my friends, all who thought I was stranger than usual. Also, I tried to work on my handshaking technique by firmly shaking hands with anybody I saw during the sign of peace at Sunday Mass. Finally the fateful day arrived -the first interview. 
It was a disaster. 
From the first handshake I knew I was in trouble. I shook firm and so did he, but when I was ready to let go he was not. Consequently I hadtto reshake and wait for him to let go. I knew'I had already lost points because of my improper handshake etiquette. My assertive­ness was destroyed. When we finally reached the interviewing cubicle and sat down, I went quickly for the eye contact to establish my in­terest in him and the firm. Much to my dismay, the interviewer had a wandering eye and thus I didn't know with which eye to keep contact. The first dynamic question of "tell me about yourself," propelled me into a meandering monologue which included a discussion of my growing up a military brat and interesting personal tibits such as the fact that I love people, chocolate cake and small animals. When our time was mercifully up, my confi­dence in ever finding a job was markedly less, although the fact that I did do better with the concluding handshake gave me some hope for improvement. 
The pleasant form rejection letter two weeks later was not surprising, but it never­theless was disappointing. Succeeding inter­views have gone better, but they still remain somewhat ofa chore. Continual comments by interviewers about life in the "real world" makes me wonder if it is "real cold" that as­saults my body when I step outside of my door. Despite some bad experiences it now appears that I may have done well enough to secure at least one job offer. 
The pressure ofgiving the "right" responses in an interview is much less now than when I first started. Experience is the best cure for the interview jitters, but 45 minute chats that are supposed to tell the interviewer about you, and you about the company and the job, remain not one of my favorite chores. 
Maybe Mom was right, law school isn't such a bad idea.

Henson's immediate concern, however, is Ohio State. The hot­shooting Buckeyes invade Illinois' Assembly Hall tonight. Illinois, which is tied for the Big Ten lead with Michigan at 4-2, has won 17 straight at home. Ohio State is only one-halfgame out of the lead with a 3-2 record.

"It's nice we're getting some recognition," said Tarkanian, whose team now is 13-2 on the season. 
Georgetown, the nation's only major unbeaten team, remained No. 1 in the poll and, for the fourth time in six weeks, the Hoyas received all 60 first-place votes and 1,200 points from the nationwide panel of sportwriters and broadcasters. 
Southern Methodist moved up a notch to second place, while Duke, ranked second for the past five weeks, dropped to fifth after suffer­ing two two-point overtime losses last week. 
St. John's, Georgetown's op­ponent Saturday, was in third place, followed by Memphis State. 
Illinois, 1 5-4 and 11th last week, jumped to sixth, while DePaul moved three places to seventh with 682 points, two more than North Carolina. Oklahoma and Oregon State, 13th and 14th last week, respectively, jumped to ninth and lOth this week. 
Oklahoma advanced after a vic­tory over then-No. 9 Kansas Satur­day despite all-American Wayman Tisdale being held to a career-low six points, while Oregon State im­proved to 14-1 with a 73-57 victory over Washington State.

LAS VEGAS, Nev.-Not much had been heard from Nevada-Las Vegas Coach jerry Tarkanian or his players since an 82-46 rout by Georgetown last month knocked the Runnin' Rebels out of The Associated Press' Top Twenty basketball poll. But that's just the way an embarrassed Tarkanian wanted it. 
"I told the kids it was no time to talk, just keep quiet and play ball," Tarkanian said yesterday. "We've been very low key and we've been winning since then." 
Winners of 12 straight since the Georgetown debacle, Nevada-Las Vegas returned to the AP Top Twenty again in the latest weekly poll released yesterday. The Rebels, on the strength of a nationally

Young team shows promise 
Women fencers find early success 
By MICHAEL). CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 

While a national title is not imme­diately on the mind of the Notre Dame women's fencing team, the Irish, with a ';-2 record in the early going, should prove to be competi­tive and fairly successful throughout the 1985 season, according to Head Coach Mike DeCicco. 
Despite the loss of senior co­captains Mary Shilts and Sharon DiNicola to graduation and the loss of last year's top seed, Pia Albertson, DeCicco Is optimistic about the prospects for this year and the near future. 
"This year's team is a good team," says DeCicco. "Overall, we're maybe a year away from a real good fencing team. And now we have talented women who want to come to Notre Dame." 
Among the top prospects for the present and the future is freshman foilist Molly Sullivan. Having won the national title in women's fencing in the 19-and-under division during the last two summers, she is cur­rently the top-seeded fencer on the Notre Dame team with an impres­sive 18-2 mark on the season. 
"At 18-2, Molly is the premier fen­cer on our team," says DeCicco. 
Returning monogram winners from last year's squad who will lend experience and talent include junior captain janet Sullivan and sop­homores Vittoria Quaroni and Cindy Weeks. 
The junior foilist enters this season with a 37-23lifetime record. After going 26-12 in 1984, she is off to a slow start in 1985 with a 9-11 mark. 
Quaroni and Weeks, both key fig­ures last year, have started out the season well. Quaroni, who finished 14-9 a year ago, is 8-9 so far into the

season; while Weeks, .26-13 last year, 
is second best on the team with a 9-7 
record. 
Returning to further strengthen 
the team after sitting out last year 
with a knee injury is sophomore 
Christina Sardegna. She has opened 
the season with a 6-4 record. 
"When you go down below Molly Sullivan, these girls are all bunched together," says DeCicco. "In a sense they're all great fencers and against most equally competent fencers they're going to do well. But when they fence against girls like Molly Sullivan -contesting for medals at major tournaments -they're just not experienced enough." 
In the season thus far, success for the Irish has come at the expense of east coast teams. Early in January, the Irish won their first three out­ings in downing Harvard, 6-3; MIT, 5-4; and MIT-B, 9-0. The Irish stubled at Penn, losing 2-14, but came back strong against Cornell and Princeton, winning both by scores of 12-4. Against Temple, in a tight match, the Irish were stymied 7-9. 
Tough to overcome for the Irish in 1985 will be the loss of Albertson from last year's 13-5 team. As a fresh­man, Albertson compiled a 37-2 record and finished tenth in the NCAA Championship tournament. 
According to DeCicco, Albertson was unable to return for her sopho­more year due to financial problems and is currently modeling in France. 
"By Pia not being able to return, it put us another year on hold before we could get someone to help us with real good experience and credentials," says DeCicco. 
Despite the loss of the Swedish native, DeCicco believes the young Irish team will prove to be a tough team down the stretch. For the Irish, big tests are to be realized soon, as they travel to Ohio State this weekend to face perennial power­house Ohio State and other top mid­western opponents.

Oklahoma In the NCAA tournament. 
One advantage for the Irish Is Dayton's loss of 6-7 forward Ed Young, who tore up his knee before the season started. Young saw 35 minutes ofplaying time In last year's game with the Irish while account­Ing for 13 of Dayton's points. Donoher wao; counting on Young to produce heavily for his squad this 
year. 

Although the Flyers will be with­out Young, they still are playing well. They figure to come into the ACC fired up and determined to beat 
the Irish. 

"We can't take Dayton lightly," says Phelps, "and we need our guys to come through in key situations this time, which is something we didn't do against DePaul." 
The 8-4 Irish already have had their mishaps against Creighton and Rice, and a loss to the Flyers only wlll make the road to an NCAA tournament bid more difficult. 
"This game means a lot because this Is one ofthe teams we play twice in the season," says Phelps, "and we are competing directly against them for an NCAA tournament bid."

Basketball team looks to rebound tonight as 12-3 Dayton visits ACC 
ByJOE BRUNEm 
Sports Writer 

The University of Dayton is not a DePaul, North Carolina or St. John's, but the Flyers aren't a Holy Cross either. Actually, they are some­where in between. When the Flyers enter the ACC tonight they will be determined to beat the Irish at home, something they have never accomplished. 
"Dayton will come in here very, very fired up," says Notre Dame bas­ketball coach Digger Phelps. "This is one of their bigger games of the year." 
For Coach Don Donoher's 1.2-3 Flyers, this definitely will be an im­portant contest. Visiting teams find it hard to win at the ACC, but a win over the Irish would impress the NCAA Tournament Selection Com­mittee. 
While the Irish finished second in the NIT last year, Dayton received an NCAA tournament bid and surprised everyum: by knocking off LSU, Oklahoma, and Washington before bowing to Georgetown in the West Regional. 
This season, the Flyers are riding a streak of nine straight victories, which included a win over always­tough Maryland. 
The Flyers aren't patsies, a fact they proved last year with an 80-70 victory over the Irish in Dayton. 
Donoher lost star Roosevelt Chap­man to graduation, and the loss of Chapman's 21.8 point scoring average definitely leaves a void. But the Dayton mentor returns three starters in Sedric Toney, Damon Goodwin, and Larry Schellenberg. 
Toney, a 6-2 senior guard, averaged almost 12 points a game Ia~t year, and he ripped the Irish for a team-high 23 points in last year's Flyer-Irish matchup. 
"Toney can really shoot it from the outside," says Phelps. "He hurt us in our game there last year, and we'll have to contain him ifwe want to win." 
Toney will be joined in the back­court by the 6-3 Schellenberg, who is a play maker for Donoher's squad. Schellenberg led last year's squad in assists with 142. 
Transfer Dave Colbert will start at center for Dayton, and he will be joined up front by Goodwin and forward-center Jeff Zern. 
The 6-8 Colbert was forced to sit out last year after transferring from Cleveland State. Goodwin, a junior forward, has the hot hand for the Flyers, as he led Dayton in shooting accuracy last year both from the field and the charity stripe. 
Zern received little playing time last year, but he showed that he can handle the pressure of big games when he played well against LSU and

Third meeting of season 
Hockey team entertains Foresters 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame hockey team will play host to Lake Forest tonight at 
7:30 at the ACC in the second regularly-scheduled meeting be­tween the teams this season. 
The most important thing on the minds ofthe Irish is finding an end to the dark tunnel of defeat. Notre Dame ha~ lost eight straight games, dating back to the Foresters' last visit to the ACC on Dec. 8 when the visitors came away with a 5-4 vic­tory. 
The Irish are also hoping to avenge Lake Forest's 5-2 win last Sat­urday in the consolation game of the Forester Cla'isic at Lake Forest. 
An Irish victory back on Dec. 8 would have given Notre Dame a 6-6 record going into the Christmas break. Instead, the loss started the Irish on their current losing streak. 
Taking this into account, the 5-14 Irish are confident as they head into tonight's contest. 
"It's about time we got back on the winning track," said senior co­captain Brem Chapman. "We've lost twice to these guys now, so I think everybody should be motivated to play hard. 
"Playing without motivation has been a problem so far. It's seems that after losing like we have been that everybody would be motivated to play hard. But something has just been lacking. 
"I think ifwe get mad, it will help. I think we play better when we have something to prove." 
The Foresters were riding an eight-game winning streak going into their Cla'>sic over the weekend, but dropped a 4-3 overtime decision to Wisconsin-River Falls in the first round. 
Lake Forest, 10-4, and Notre Dame played scoreless hockey Sat­urday for a period-and-a-half before several Irish miscues allowed the Foresters to capitalize three times in the last half of the second period. 
"We've got to do a lot of improv­ing defensively," said Irish head coach Lefty Smith. "We need better forechecking and backchecking. 
And we must tighten up our overall 
play in our own zone." 
Notre Dame won three of four meetings between the teams last season, but this season's two Forester wins have evened the series · at 3-3 over the last six outings. 
The Irish will play without junior left wing Dave Waldbillig, who separated his shoulder Saturday during the first period. Senior Rob Ricci also will sit out the second game of his suspension which came as a result of a fighting incident in Friday's third period. Ricci missed Saturday's game with Lake Forest, but must miss an additional game since he was also given a game dis­qualification penalty on Dec. 1 in a game earlier this season with Alabama-Huntsville. 
In other lineup changes, freshman Mark Anquillare will take over the center spot on the third line. One of two sophomores, John Nickodemus or Rich Sobilo, will move up to replace Waldbillig on the left side of the second line.

Basketball team reaches crossroad

Irish Items 


Hello again, everybody! 

"We stink" (or some derivative ofthat) wa~ the description one of my friends gave concerning Sunday's DePaul game. "We couldn't shoot, we couldn't rebound, we couldn't do anything. We stink." 
One could sympathize with my friend. After all, the loss was disap­pointing, and it offered no consolation that the room he had returned to was cold enough that you could hang meat there. His recitation ofthe statistical facts surrounding the game were precise ­yes, the Irish shot only 40 percent from the floor, missed six big free throws in the second half, and were easily outrebounded. Still. it seemed hard to agree with his blunt, if not pessimistic, opinion of Notre Dame's effort. 
Not much later, the dissenting opinion was voiced by his 
roommate. "Great game, huh! Boy, Rivers was incredible and 
everybody was fired up. We're going to make the NCAA tournament, 
no problem!" 

His unbridled optimism made me wonder whether we saw the 
same game. DePaul did win, didn't it? Did his glasses fog up with a 
rose coloring? Yes, David Rivers had a good game, and the student 
body put in .one ofits better performances in quite some time. But, 
come on ... 

It seems the proper place to put this Notre Dame team right now 
lies somewhere between pessimism and Pollyannism. The Irish are 
at the crossroad of being good or being merely average. The Irish 
defeated Indiana and played DePaul tough for 35 minutes. At times, 
they have played brilliantly, and there's little doubt this Notre Dame 
team is capable ofbeing quite good. They certainly do not "stink" or 
any derivative of that. 

In fact, the Irish have been more than respectable to this point. They have played at a .500 clip on the road -something recent Notre Dame basketball teams have been unable to do-and their only home loss has been to a Top Ten team. There is no reason to hang your head about this team's performance. 
That doesn't mean, though, that everything gold on Sunday was glittering. Notre Dame has shown some tarnished spots, as well a'> bright ones. Flashes of brilliance have been dulled by inexplicable lapses ofconfidence. Notre Dame was close Sunday-the Irish led by three with 8:21 left -but they never seemed to take control of the game. One hesitates to use the word, but at times the Irish have appeared intimidated. 
Secondly, anybody who thinks Rivers will be able to carry this team to the NCAA by himselfdoesn't have a firm grasp on teality. The Irish need to have a good team effort to beat a nationally-ranked team because no particular dimension ofNotre Dame'sgame is good enough to beat a team by itself. The Irish need Rivers to penetrate, Scott Hicks and Ken Barlow to hit from the outside, and Tim Kempton and Jim Dolan to control the inside. That didn't happen Sunday, and it hasn't happened in any of Notre Dame's losses. 
Finally, the Irish have yet to develop any kind of consistency. Notre Dame has improved its outside shooting, but if the guards aren't hitting from the floor, you could throw up a 2-3, Twilight or Tow Awayzone and have a good chance ofbeating the Irish. Barlow, Rivers and Hicks have been fairly reliable, but nobody has really played well every time out on the court. Just like anything else, one tires of"pot luck" every night. 
It would appear the Irish are definitely at a crossroad in this 1984­85 campaign. A 20-win season and the NCAA tournament is certainly a goal which is attainable, but the season also could turn out to be merely average. A critical step along either path could be taken tonight, as the Irish entertain the red-hot Dayton Flyers in the ACC. 
It is definitely a big game for the 8-4 Irish, as Dayton stands at 12-3. The Flyers have won nine in a row, including triumphs over Maryland and South Florida. A win over Dayton would certainly be impressive not only to the fans, but also to the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee. 
Meanwhile, Dayton comes to the ACC with a few things to prove, too. The Flyers have never won in South Bend, and they believe a win in the ACC would give a lot ofsupport to their claim a~ the nation's top independent. 
Thus, Phelps has once again asked the students for support in a big game, and he certainly has every reason to do so. After all, there is no doubt the Notre Dame student body can be one of the most influen­tial in the nation. This game will help decide which road the Irish take-a well-paved one to the NCAA tournament or a long and wind­ing one to the ranks of the average. 
Pick ofthe Week ... It's off to the track-the indoor track of the ACC -for action this week. Joe Plane's Irish play host to Loyola, DePaul, Bradley and Valparaiso under the North Dome Friday at 6:30 p.m. 
The Irish will be looking to rebound from a tough loss to Iowa on Saturday, and would appreciate a big crowd to urge them on. Get out ofthe cold and see some sizzling track action. We'll A-C-C you there!
