Student government considers course guide book 
Wellman suggested The Guide as part of their platform during this year's elections. 
"The Guide is a commitment made by faculty and students to the quality of intellectual life here at Notre Dame," Flynn said. "Its impact and success hinge on the amount of partici­pation we receive from the stu­dents and faculty." 
The Guide will rate the quality of the instructor and the readings, the amount of work required, the level of difficulty, the pace of the course, the competitive atmosphere and the amount of interest the subject matter stimulates, according to the mission statement of The Guide. 

Juror's illness interrupts King trial 
By BECKY BARNES 
Assistant News Editor 
Student Government hopes to clear up ambiguity and end the uncertainty of choosing courses with The Guide, a completely student-run course evaluation book. 
By compiling students' ratings of professors, texts and exams in a course, The Guide "gives students a chance to contribute their feedback about the classes and gives students a clearer and better idea of what their classes are going to be like, " said Susan Petrovic, The Guide co-chair.

And the winner is . .. 
The Guide will not include course evaluations for classes with fewer than 25 students. In classes with few students, "the results would be skewed and that's unfair to professors," Petrovic said. 
If funds allow, Student Gov­ernment hopes to make one copy of The Guide available to each dorm room. 
Other universities like Har­vard and Princeton have offered students written course guides for many years. Eva Milofsky, administrative advisor to the Harvard guide, CUE, said that both students and faculty find the book helpful. While CUE is nearly 1,000 pages, "It gets

LOS ANGELES (AP) -Delib­erations in the Rodney King beating trial were interrupted in their fifth day Wednesday when a juror got sick and went to a doctor. 
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said he expected jurors to resume deliberations Thurs­day morning on whether four police officers violated King's 
federal civil rights in the videotaped beating. 
The jury has deliberated 25 1/2 hours. In a state trial last year, jurors deliberated 32 hours before acquitting the offi­cers of most charges. The ac­quittals sparked riots that left 54 people dead and caused $1 billion in damages. 
Davies had summoned lawyers and the police officers to his courtroom for a "proceeding," but didn't elabo­rate, prompting a flurry of speculation inside and outside the courthouse about whether the jury had reached a verdict. 
The proceeding was delayed for an hour when one defense lawyer couldn't be found. When it began, Davies took the bench and told lawyers he hoped they would stay within 10 minutes of the courtroom at all times. 
''I'm speaking of the future, which means, of course, no verdict has been reached," the judge said with a slight smile. 
"We do have a problem," Davies said. "One of the jurors appeared to have become ill and requested medical atten­tion." He didn't disclose the na­ture of the ailment or indicate which of the jurors, whose identities have been kept se­cret, was afflicted. 
Davies said the juror was going to a family doctor, ac­companied by a federal mar­shal. The other 11 jurors re­turned to the hotel where they are sequestered. 
Attorneys said that if the juror became too sick to continue, one of three alternate jurors would be chosen by lot to enter the deliberations. 
"The real problem is if the new juror gets in there, they have to start all over again," said defense attorney Harland Braun. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Clymer said he too hoped Davies wouldn't dismiss the ill juror. 
Jurors had been deliberating whether Sgt. Stacey Koon, Offi­cers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno and ex-Offi­cer Timothy Wind, all white, deprived black motorist King of his civil rights. An onlooker videotaped police beating King 
"It's not meant to be deroga­tory in any way," Petrovic said. 
The Guide will include only courses taught by professors who choose to participate in the project. Student Government sent questionnaires to profes­sors before Easter and is cur­rently waiting for their re­sponses. 
"Of about 200 responses from faculty members, about three fourths have been positive, of­fering support for the project and willingness to participate," Petrovic said. 
Father Miscamble, associate professor of history, said that he "hopes it will be a positive project." While he thinks it will benefit students, he also said

that he will seriously consider what students say about his classes. 
Most professors who chose not to participate said they are going on leave next semester or they want to see the first copy before they take part in it, Petrovic said. 
Student government will give professors who participate evaluation sheets, separate from the TCE's conducted by the University, to pass out to students. The book will be compiled throughout the sum­mer from this information and will be available next fall in time to register for spring

Four ND students awarded Fulbrights 

By ROB ADAMS 
News Writer 
After submitting proposals through a rigorous selection process which took place all over the United States, four Notre Dame students have been given the chance to research specific topics abroad by winning Fulbright grants. 
David Holsinger, Jennifer Martin, Michael Pries and Brian Ray recieved four of this year's Fulbright Grants given by the United States Information Agency. The grant covers all costs and travel to the country where the research is to be completed. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students who are interested must first develop and present a research proposal to the head of the Fulbright program at Notre Dame, Professor John Welle. After a screening and interview conducted by a professor who teaches the field that the student wishes to pur­sue, a letter of recommendation is written and sent to the New York Institution of Education. 
The first "cuts" are then made and the finalists' projects are sent to the United States In­formation Agency where the final 700 are chosen. 
"Fulbrights are an attempt to get Americans to broaden their cultural experiences through education abroad," Welle said. 
"I was really excited because I have always wanted to study abroad," said Martin, who will be researching stability and control through aerospace engineering at the D.O.R. Insti­tute and studying at the Uni­versity of Braunschweig in Braunschweig, Germany. Martin, who was formerly a hall president and is now an R.A., plans to eventually get her PhD. in aerospace engineering, work for a while, and then teach. 
Pries majors in economics and will be working with a Brazilian "think tank" next year in Sao Paolo where he and his co-workers will research the economics, politics, and so­ciology of Brazil. 
Pries has spent a year abroad in Mexico, worked as an intern in Chile, and participated in the social services project and the overseas development network here on campus. "I am very happy to be able to live in Brazil and experience a new culture," he said. 
Ray is double-majoring in liberal studies and Japanese and will be studying Zen Bud­dhism with Nishitni Keiji, a Japanese philosopher in Kyoto, Japan. He plans to eventually

Wednesday began with a strange spectacle at the down­town courthouse. Koon and his attorney, Ira Salzman, arrived wearing Groucho Marx-style gag glasses with fake noses and phony mustaches. 
"We're trying to provide a little lightheartedness," Salz­man told reporters. He said the masks were given as gifts. 
Braun questioned the appro­priateness of the disguises during such a serious case. "These men have been pushed beyond human limits to un­dergo this thing and it's prob­ably not in the best taste, but they are decent men and under cooler conditions I'm sure they wouldn't have done it," he said. Also Wednesday, defense attorney Michael Stone con­firmed that U.S. Marshal Craig Meacham met with lawyers to discuss plans for their federal

INSIDE COLUMN 


Jury must hold standards of Constitution 
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an 
impartial jury." Business Editor 
Nowhere does it ________ mention that a jury's verdict should be affected by popular opinion, wealth, influence, or even the possibility of rioting, however strong. If Officers Koon and Powell are indeed guilty of beating Rodney King, they should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. If the two are not guilty, they should not be made scapegoats in an attempt to redress the inequities that exist in today's America. To suggest that the King jury should consider during its deliberations the possible effect of its verdict is to commit a violation of Koon and Powell's civil rights as serious as the one the two officers are accused of committing on Rodney King. Many convincingly argue that the justice system does not consistently deliver fair and impartial verdicts for African-Americans. Although constitutional Jaw may be the furthest thing from the mind of a youth in a Los Angeles ghetto, it is the one weapon on the side of the African-American underclass in their struggle against injustice. The two-hundred year old document is still the last and greatest defense retained by the underprivileged in this country. The Constitution protects us from illegal search and seizure, guarantees that we must be indicted by a grand jury before being tried, and when we are tried, we receive free legal advice and a trial by a jury of our peers. Certainly, our justice system is not perfect. Defendants do not always receive all of the rights articled by the Constitution, but does this injustice allow us to intentionally compromise the rights of two men in an attempt to rectify the situation. The Constitution is not at fault; its implementation is. Under the Constitution, African-Americans are entitled to the same rights as whites. even though this is not always the case in reality. We must not oppress the privileged to make them equal to the underprivileged. Instead, we must raise the oppressed to the level of the privileged. Anything else would be senseless. When we compromise one right in an attempt to guarantee another, we risk compromising them all. Blacks will risk even greater injustices i such an event occurs. President Johnson's 1968 Report on the Commission of Civil Disorders in the aftermath of the Watts riots concluded that America is moving toward two separate societies, one black and one white. Watts marked a crossroads in American society. The L.A. riots marked another. We must not take the wrong path again by denying basic civil rights in a desperate attempt to guarantee those same civil rights. That route will not work. Spring may be in the air, but the season threatens to be a stormy one if this nation allows its principles to be compromised.

By PAUL PEARSON News Writer 
Ellis Liddell of Atlanta en­couraged Notre Dame students Wednesday to conquer their fears and try their ideas in the business world. 
Liddell, President of Ellis Lid­dell Productions, a public man­agement firm, spoke on the topic of "Effective Economics: From Entrepreneurship to Community Investment." 
According to Liddell, one of the best ways to generate ideas is take what is unique about a person and making something out of that. "No one comes to the table with your experi­ences." 
A person needs a great deal of courage and self-esteem to make it as an entrepreneur, Liddell said. "You've got to be willing to put your butt on the line." 
The toughest part of getting an idea off the ground, accord­ing to Liddell, is sharing it with someone. "As long as (an idea) is in your head, it will stay there," he said. 
However, an idea should only be shared with "people who can see what you see ... (who can) see the gold at the end of the rainbow," Liddell said. This eliminates most of a person's friends and family members. "They love you, but they'll tell you the truth, even if it hurts." 
An entrepreneur's idea should also be reduced to its simplest elements, Liddell said. "Look at your idea and scale it down to the point where you can do it with little or no money." 
But in the end, an en­trepreneur needs the courage to take a risk on an idea, ac­cording to Liddell. "People will spend three or four dollars on the lottery, but most people won't spend five dollars on an idea they had." 
Liddell said that he was inter­ested in creating jobs in his community. Before he started his own firm, he used to earn a six-figure salary as a stockbro­ker. "It was a real comfort, but I wasn't creating jobs," he said. 
During the lecture, Liddell criticized America's minimum wage laws. Americans should "pay people based on how much money they generate. If someone is making a company $30 an hour, they should be paid $20 an hour. We have to look at this system (in the U.S.) and say, 'Maybe we need to change it if we want to stay on top of the world,"' he said. 
Liddell also advised students to do something "that will cre­ate a job for you while you're looking for a job," such as writ­ing a grant application while still in school. 
He also told students not to rely on a degree alone. In At­lanta, which has 17 colleges, there are people with doctoral degrees "who are working as a fry cook (at fast food restau­rants) while they're waiting for that job to come along," he said. 
Liddell's speech was spon­sored by the African-American

"I was thrilled to receive the grant because I was making plans to go abroad to Japan anyway," said Ray. He has competed for the Notre Dame fencing team and has already spent some time in Japan when he went abroad his sophomore year. 
Holsinger has been selected to teach conversational English at a high school in Germany. He is a government major who has already spent a year abroad in Austria. 
"We are very happy with this year's Fulbright winners," said Professor Jim McAdams, who will take over as the head of the Notre Dame Fulbright program next year. "People should come up with research topics for this program."

John Murnick, chairman of the academic committee of the Princeton undergraduate stu­dent government, said their course book is somewhat dif­ferent from The Guide because they ask one student in each class to write a review of it. While they will publish some­thing like "This professor is the worst in the department, and he mumbles at the blackboard," they do not print un­substantiated claims like "the entire math department can't teach," he added.

semester's classes until the guide comes out. "Students look at it as the definitive in­formation about courses," Murnick said. The University has had to cancel a course which received a bad review because no one signed up for it, he added. 
Almost 300 people contribute to the Princeton guide, includ­ing an editor, assistant editors, department editors and re­viewers. Petrovic and Sara Skalicky, also a Guide co-chair, will form a committee when the evaluation sheets are com­pleted. 
Petrovic encouraged students to take take part in the evalua­tions "because it's for their benefit." So far, she said, "the students seem very positive about it."

Special to the Observer 
The University of Notre Dame has received a $200,000 grant for the Saint Gaerard Foundation of Clearwater, Fla., for its Jacques Maritain Center. 
The grant will support a vari­ety of activities underscoring the importance of Saint Thomas Aquinas and the mag­isterium of the Catholic Church, according to James Mooney, president of the foundation. 
Ralph Mcinerny, Michael Grace Professor of Medieval Studies and director of the Maritain Center, said that the grant will make possible the establishment of a dissertation year graduate fellowship and a research fellowship for Thomistic projects; production and distribution of a brochure drawing the attention of un­dergraduate students to the Thomistic courses offered in the University's philosophy de­partment; a two-week confer­ence of Thomsit scholars to be held at Notre Dame this sum­mer; and center-sponsored faculty conferences with visit­ing lecturers during the 1993­94 academic year. 
"The money will also enable the Maritain Center to expand its efforts to become an archive of the Thomistic revival in North America," Mcinerny said, adding that the "golden era" of that revival, triggered by Pope Leo XIII's 1879 en­cyclical, "Aeterni Patris," is represented by the career of Jacques Maritain, a French Catholic thinker who taught at Notre Dame and had strong personal and intellectual ties to the University. 
Papers of Maritain and those of two other prominent Thomist philosophers, Yves Simon and Charles DeKonick, are already housed in the cen­ter. 
In addition, Mcinerny said, the grant will underwrite the inaguration of a projected 20 volume edition of Maritain's writings to be published by the University of Notre Dame Press.

Russia's money, leadership problems continue 
US, partners rally behind Yeltsin 
TOKYO (AP) -The seven strongest industrial nations opened an emergency meeting on Russian aid with a U.S. proposal Wednesday to spend $4 billion on converting state­run factories to private ownership. 
Japan also detailed its first major aid package for Moscow -$1.8 billion in loans and grants to bolster President Boris Yeltsin. The Japanese hope that if Yeltsin wins an April 25 referendum on his leadership, he will come to Tokyo in May and arrange the return of four islands seized at the close of World War II. 
Other parts of an overall $30 billion aid package are expected to fall in place during the two-day meeting of foreign and finance ministers from the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. 
A senior Italian foreign ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Group of Seven's program would include a $500 million fund to help promote small­and mid-size businesses in Russia. The fund would be put together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
Russian Foreign Minister An­drei V. Kozyrev, who is in Tokyo to keep an eye on the deliberations, held out hope for Japan it would recover the four sparsely populated islands in the Kilril chain. 
Making preliminary arrange­ments for Yeltsin's visit, he told the TBS television network: "The subject of the territorial problem will naturally be on the agenda." 
The islands are a lingering symbol of Japanese nationalism, and the dispute has kept Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty. But at the urging of its Western partners, the government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa put the issue aside to play a prominent role in the Yeltsin bailout effort. 
Germany, which already has provided about $39 billion in aid to Russia on its own, has been pushing all its Group of Seven partners to do more to prop up the former Soviet republic. 
The privatization fund proposed by the United States would be launched with a $500 million U.S. contribution. The other six nations would be expected to provide $1.5 billion, and the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would add $2 billion. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the fund would free Russia's central bank of 
MOSCOW (AP) -Exuding confidence at a Kremlin news conference, President Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday he will win Russia's nationwide refer­endum. But he promised to re­sign if voters support parlia­ment instead. 
Yeltsin, more optimistic about his chances after what he called a successful campaign swing to Siberia, also outlined an accelerated market reform program and a proposed new constitution that would replace the Soviet-era Congress. 
The session with Russian and foreign reporters was part of Yeltsin's stepped-up campaign to win support in the ref­erendum, which is designed to settle his power struggle with the Congress of People's Deputies. 
Yeltsin said the choice is be­tween the old and new. 
"The old system, firmly rooted in the bureaucratic apparatus and old structures, would not let go, would not surrender property to the citizens of Russia," Yeltsin said. 

People of Kuwait give warm welcome to Bush 
KUWAIT (AP) -Whirling sword dancers, flower-bearing girls and thousands of cheering children greeted George Bush on Wednesday as Kuwaitis launched "Operation Love Storm" to welcome the man who helped liberate their country. 
The party started as soon as a chartered blue and white Kuwaiti Airways jetliner landed, bringing the former president, his wife Barbara and other guests on his first visit to the emirate. 
The thousands lining the highway from the airport to the city included schoolchildren given a holiday for the occasion. They wa_ved small U.S. flags or balloons and others held signs. One read, "Welcome Boosh." 
Thtl former president who organized Kuwait's liberation from Iraqi troops in 1991 took on a rock star aura as police and teachers restrained chil­dren from running out to try to touch his car. 
At a dinner hosted by Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al­Sabah, Bush was presented with the Mubarak al-Kabeer (Mubarak the Great) medal, Kuwait's highest civilian award. 
The medal is named for a former emir, Mubarak al­Sabah, who ruled Kuwait from 1896 until his death in 1915 and is revered for taking the first steps toward making the nation an autonomous state. 
Sheik Jaber told Bush the medal was "in gratitude and 
appreciation for your enormous efforts in liberating Kuwait and your services toward world peace and understanding." 
The emir also paid tribute to the 541,000 U.S. military per­sonnel who served in Operation Desert Storm, the allied opera­tion to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991. 
Bush, smiling broadly, told the emir: "Mere words cannot express how proud I feel to be here with you on the hallowed ground of Kuwait. ... Thank you again for honoring me and, indeed, my country this evening." 
When Bush arrived for the three-day visit, the airport was bedecked with American and Kuwaiti flags. Sword dancers whirled to beating drums. 
After walking along a red carpet to meet his host, Bush hugged and kissed two young girls who presented bouquets. 
The Congress, stacking the cards against Yeltsin, included four questions in the referen­dum: confidence in the presi­dent, approval of his economic policies, early presidential and parliamentary elections. 
It also said passage requires the approval of more than half the electorate, including those who don't cast ballots, which would severely hamper Yeltsin's chances. The Constitutional Court has been asked to rule on that requirement. 
Yeltsin is urging Russians to vote "yes" on all four questions, although that would put him at risk in presidential balloting. 
Public opinion surveys indi­cate moderate support for Yeltsin, mixed opinions about his reforms and very strong sentiment for early parliamen­tary elections. 
Yeltsin said that if voters ex­press no confidence in him and reject early parliamentary elections, "The president will resign."

At least 30 injured in plane crast1 
GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) ­The landing gear on an Ameri­can Airlines DC-10 jetliner col­lapsed during landing in a thunderstorm Wednesday, and at least 30 of the 202 people aboard were injured while fleeing down inflatable slides. 
The most serious injury was to a 79-year-old woman who suffered a broken neck and was hospitalized in serious condition. All but seven injured people were released from hospitals by late afternoon. 
Passengers on Flight 102 from Honolulu said the pilot warned about turbulent weather but reported no problems during the 7 a.m. approach to Dallas­Fort Worth International Airport. 
"The landing wasn't too bad, then he hit the brakes real 
Americans oppose abortion litmus test for supreme court nominees 
NEW YORK (AP) -Most Americans want President Clinton to ignore a potential nominee's position on abortion when he fills the impending vacancy on the Supreme Court, according to an Associated Press poll. 
On a more general question, 54 percent said Clinton should consider a person's legal qualifications and background only, as opposed to 41 percent who said the president also should consider how the nominee might vote on major issues. 
hard," said passenger Hank Lindsaey of Honolulu. "Then we skidded onto the mud and the plane tilted to its left." 
The plane came to rest par­tially on a taxiway with its nose and left wing plowed into thick mud. The nose gear and left under-wing· landing gear had collapsed. The 189 passengers and 13 crew members slid down escape slides. 
No cause has been deter­mined, American spokesman AI Becker said. 
Becker said one of the control towers reported "smoke and flame coming from the wheel well." Passengers also said they saw flames on the jet's left side. "At first the people who rushed out were afraid to go off the wing on the slide. It was too 
steep," Lindsaey said. "When we saw the fire, we said 'It's not too steep.' I'd look and '.'"1n, look and run." 
Thunderstorms were rolling across the region, and some passengers said they believed the jet had· been struck by lightning 10 minutes before the landing. 
"We had a bolt of something that hit us when we were air­borne," said Faye Evans of Baltimore. 
Airline officials said they didn't know if weather was a factor. 
The airport, one of the na­tion's busiest, was closed for a short time and flights were de­layed throughout the day. 
National Transportation Safety Board investigators were at the site. 

A majority, 57 percent, said Clinton should not ask his ap­pointee's views on abortion. 
Clinton has said he will not directly ask any potential nominee his or her position on abortion. But he has also said he wants a justice who will respect the right to privacy, an argument underpinning the right to an abortion. 
In the poll, 72 percent said Clinton should not consider a potential nominee's position on abortion. Fifteen percent said he should consider only someone who generally favors

abortion rights, while 11 percent said he should restrict his search to opponents of abortion. The remaining 2 percent were not sure. 
The poll of 1,003 adults was taken by phone April 7-10 by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., part of AUS Con­sultants. Results have a margin 
of  sampling  error  of  3  
percentage points, p lus  or  
minus.  

Clinton is selecting a re­placement for Byron White, who has announced his re­tirement for the end of the current court term in June or July. It will be the first Supreme Court appointment for a Democratic president since the Johnson administration in the 1960s. 
Although interest groups are lobbying Clinton to increase the court's diversity, that does not seem to be a priority for many people. 
Only 12 percent in the poll said Clinton should appoint a woman. Five percent said he should choose a man, and 82 percent said the nominees' sex doesn't make any difference. 
The country was almost evenly split on whether in­creasing the representation of minorities, such as blacks or Hispanics, should be an im­portant consideration: 45 per­cent said yes, 49 percent no, the rest not sure. 
The poll showed men and women thinking alike about the nominee's sex not making a difference. But women were more likely to say minority representation was important. 
There also was a gender gap on using issues as litmus tests, with 60 percent of men but only 48 percent of women saying Clinton should consider the candidate's qualifications and background only. 
Correction 
In a page one headline yesterday, The Observer inaccurately said that study days were proposed for Saint Mary's. Rather, Student Academic Council issued a proposal that encouraged professors not to give tests during the week prior to fmals. An earlier proposal for study days at Saint Mary's was rejected by the faculty. The Observer regrets the error.

South African workers begin strike 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -In an outpouring of black rage, millions of work­ers went on strike Wednesday to protest the slaying of black leader Chris Hani. At least four people were killed and hun­dreds wounded as blacks bat­tled police. 
The worst clash was in the black township of Soweto, where police fired on marchers outside the main police station. Hospital spokeswoman Adri Potgieter said three people died, five were critically wounded and 259 suffered mi­nor wounds. 
Police claimed they fired be­cause protesters were hurling rocks, but witnesses said most of the crowd was calm and had started to leave the area. 
Among the dead was African National Congress official Sam Ntobane, the black group said. 
Police and soldiers fired shotguns, rubber bullets and tear gas at looters who ram­paged through shops in Cape Town and torched vehicles. A hand grenade exploded and in­jured 10 soldiers, and medical officials said a man was killed and about 150 people were wounded in the looting. 
Looting also broke out in Durban and Pietermaritzburg in Natal province, and in Port Elizabeth to the south. 
Pope asks nuns to leave their convent at Auschwitz 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -A group of Carmelite nuns are preparing to leave their con­vent at the former Nazi Auschwitz death camp after an appeal by Pope John Paul II, a priest said Wednesday. 
The pope's letter Wednesday follows more than a year of tension between the Roman Catholic Church and Jewish groups, which want to preserve the camp as a Holocaust memorial. 
Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek told the PAP news agency that the nuns "accepted the Holy Father's will with complete submission." 
The New York-based World Jewish Congress said Wednes­day that the nuns agreed to leave the convent within a few weeks, fulfilling a 1987 pact with Jewish leaders. 
But a Catholic official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the nuns would move in a matter of days, not weeks. 
The World Jewish Congress threatened to boycott next week's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising -the rebellion of Polish Jews against Nazi occupiers -unless Catholic leaders expedited the closing of the convent. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, Vice President AI Gore and thousands of Holocaust survivors plan to attend the ceremonies, which begin Sunday. 
The World Jewish Congress' spokesman, Elon Steinberg, said Bishop Tadeusz Rakoczy, whose diocese includes Auschwitz, notified the group Tuesday that the deal was complete. 
The convent, which houses 14 nuns, was installed in 1984 in a building where the Nazis stored 
Hani, head of the South African Communist Party and one of the ANC's most popular leaders, was assassinated out­side his home Saturday. A white right-winger has been charged in the murder. 
Across much of the country Wednesday, mourners ex­pressed their sadness by at­tending peaceful memorial services and marches, heeding the ANC's call for a one-day strike. 
"It was one of the best-at­tended stayaways ever," said economist Miekie Dames. Business groups said as many as 75 percent of the nation's 6 million black workers were on strike, meaning a possible $160 million loss to the economy. 
Black and white leaders are struggling to prevent anger over Hani's killing from derailing talks on ending apartheid and giving the black majority the vote. The govern­ment and the ANC have said they will press ahead with talks. 
"We could have ended up with a much worse situation," said ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa. He warned that if negotiations did not speed up, "worse could happen." 
President F.W. de Klerk called Wednesday night for a meeting with ANC president Nelson Mandela as soon as possible. 
Zyklon-B gas that was used to exterminate Auschwitz prisoners. About 1.5 million prisoners -mostly Jews ­died at Auschwitz. 
The pope sent a letter to the nuns Wednesday stating "it is the will of the Church that you move to another location" in the town of Oswiecim, the Pol­ish name for Auschwitz, PAP reported. 
Catholic leaders signed an agreement in 1987 to move the convent and build a replace­ment nearby. When the project was delayed, Jews accused the church of breaking its word. 
The convent's new quarters, about 500 yards outside the camp, is not complete. 
He said an additional 3,000 troops and police would be sent to combat unrest, bolstering some 23,000 on the streets Wednesday. 
''What happened in South Africa today cannot be tolerated in any civilized country," de Klerk said. 
In Washington, the State De­partment advised U.S. citizens to postpone non-essential travel to South Africa until after the mourning period, scheduled to end Sunday. 
Two whites were shot and killed and another injured Tuesday night in the Transkei black homeland, police said. Two black men were killed Wednesday in shooting inci­dents in Johannesburg that were not clearly linked to the Hani protests. 
At one of the biggest memorial services, about 20,000 people squeezed into Soweto's small Jabulani Stadium, where Mandela pleaded for calm. 
"I appreciate that our young people are very angry because their hero has been killed," he said as the crowd surged dan­gerously toward the small stage. But "to return to violence only means more innocent people are going to continue dying."

Ever since this nation was founded--on principles of equality and tolerance-Americans of goodwill from every race and economic class have battled against the ugliness and injustice represented by the words defined above. 
Here in Michiana, in 1986 a group of people banded together as Community Allies in this fight against racism and the misguided attitudes that feed it. Included among these people were members of the Notre Dame community. 
Our campus is no refuge from, nor is our community immune to the problems of racism. That is why we now invite the men and women of Notre Dame to join in our effort. 
The recently-formed University Committee on Cultural Diversity has taken a Pledge Against Racism. Our pledge is two-fold: To foster and encourage communication and 
understanding among people of all races, and to oppose, individually and as a group, all manifestations of racism, prejudice, bigotry and stereotyping. Our names are above. Won't you add your voice to our pledge by returning the attached coupon? There is absolutely no obligation--except the respect each of us owes to our fellow human beings.

Students must be aware of Catholic character before criticizing University 
Dear Editor: 
My understanding of Notre Dame and the traditions and customs of the University were well known to me from the be­ginning of my memory. I am not a product of a "Notre Dame family," nor did any of my relatives attend this Univer­sity-my University. I am not an "active" Catholic but I did attend Catholic educational in­stitutions, including my under­graduate college, which all had pros and cons as does every school. 
When I decided to pursue graduate study I immediately focused on Notre Dame. I did so because I felt that an environ­ment involving the values, pur­pose and the significance of academic as well as human character demanded here would provide me with the progression, both professionally and personally, to attain my goals. 

I wanted to be part of the Notre Dame community knowing fully of all the expec­tations that would be put upon me. I was elated in receiving an acceptance letter that required a profound effort on my behalf in attaining. I resigned from a very secure and financially re­warding position to begin my experience at Notre Dame. 
The reason for this letter is that I do not understand why anyone would enter an institu­tion that had ideals or require­ments that one did not agree with or found personally in­comprehensible. The University of Notre Dame and its Catholic status is known world-wide, especially by a student interested in applying for ad­mission. 
I feel that if you support ho­mosexual rights or abortion, or have an abhorrence for pari­etals or Catholic teaching, and your feelings are so strong about it, then you should look in the mirror for an arena to complain and object instead of every campus publication and administrative body. Remember that you chose to attend this fine University and are fortunate enough to be a part of this community of which many only wish to be a part of. 
For the individuals who had no choice and had guns held to your heads all the way to South Bend, please disregard.

University needs to be open during lunch 
Dear Editor: 
This is an open letter to all administrators and their secre­taries: 
As students, we take classes that occupy our mornings and afternoons. For the most of us. we take our lunch break around 12 noon. This is par­ticularly true on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when we have a break from 12:15-1:15. lienee, our "free time" in the day is usually around noon. 
At the same time, we have many errands to run on a fre-
DOONESBURY 

quent basis that involve Uni­versity administrators and their secretaries, such as getting an approval from a department, seeing the registrar, clearing a student account, turning in financial aid forms, and so forth. Being free from classes around noon, many students wish to run these errands during this time. 
However. most of these offices are closed for lunch and will "re-open" at 1 p.m. However, many students are tied up in classes at this time and cannot run their very important errands. 
As a student, I ask all admin­istrators and their secretaries to consider re-scheduling their lunch hour to a later time, per­haps 1 or 2 p.m. 
This way, more students could complete any errands they may have. At the same time, administrators and their secretaries could enjoy a less­crowded hour. 
Thank you.

Dancing women 
Saint Mary's celebrates "Women in Dance" series this weekend 
By MARY GOOD 
Accent Writer 
Dance can be a source of identity and empowerment. 
The focus on empowering women in movement will be the theme this weekend as Saint Mary's women explore femininity through dance and movement in "Women in Dance." 
The weekend seminar will in­corporate women's issues in areas of spirituality, feminism, and movement, according to lndi Dieckgrafe, assistant professor of dance at Saint Mary's. 
This weekend's seminar will kick ofT with "Women, Earth & Creator Spirit," the ninth annual Madeleva lecture. The celebrated speaker is female theologian Elizabeth Johnson, 
esc. 
Johnson received her doctorate from the Catholic University of America. An associate professor of theology at Fordham University, she also is internationally known for her insights into contemporary theological issues. 
Johnson has written a number of books including, "Consider Jesus: Waves of Renewal in Christology," and "She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse." 
Johnson has also written nu­merous articles on the theology of God, Jesus Christ, Mary, the saints, religious language, and feminist questions. These articles have appeared in such magazines as "The Tho mist," "lleythrop Journal," and 
"Journal of Ecumenical Studies." 
Johnson currently serves with the National US Lutheran/Roman Catholic Dialogue and Advisory Board of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Women in Church and Society. 
Dieckgrafe said that based on Johnson's background and interest, her talk should blend together the topics of women and the arts, two of the week's major themes. 
"It will be interesting to see the way in which Johnson plans to tie women, dance, and spirituality together," said Dieckgrafe. 
The lecture is Thursday, April 15, at 7:30 pm in Saint Mary's Little Theatre and is sponsored by Center for Spirituality. 
The second event of the series is a Friday afternoon class pre­sented by Winifred Haun, a modern dancer from Chicago. According to Dieckgrafe. Haun's presentation will demonstrate students a new style of modern dance. "The class will give participants exposure to a new style," Dieckgrafe said. 
The class will be at 4:30 pm in the Regina Dance Studio and is open to everyone. 
Margie Gillis' powerful dancing will be featured in her solo performance Saturday. Gillis, a Montreal native, is a choreographer and performer of over fifty solo dance pieces. 
She has created a distinctive style through her past studies with teachers such as May O'Donnell, Linda Rabin, Lynda Haino, and Allan Wayne. Gillis plans to tour Japan in 1994 with her performances. 
Gillis introduced modern dance to China in 1979. She was the first performer, teacher, and lecturer in China following the Cultural Revolution. 
With such accomplishments, Gillis earned the position of Canadian Cultural Ambassador in 1986 and was presented with the Order of Canada award in 1988. 
Because of Gillis' unique and individualistic style, her presentation on the Saint Mary's stage is a breakthrough in feminist dancing, according to Dieckgrafe. 
"Gillis' solo appearance as a woman on the O'Laughlin stage is quite a brave endeavor," she said. "It will be interesting to see if Gillis' performance is feminine or feminist oriented." 
Gillis' performance will be at 8 p.m. on Saturday, April 17. Saint Mary's students receive complimentary tickets and members of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities can buy tickets for $3. 
The week's seminar concludes Sunday with a colloquium at 6 pm in the Regina dance studio. The panel will consist of religious studies major Therese Johnson, and dance major Marcie Thorson. Ballet teacher Tamsin Bomar will lead the discussion, seeking reactions to "Women in Dance." 
Dieckgrafe said that the dancers will demonstrate the forms of dance becoming more popular in the nineties. 
"The colloquium will focus on the audience response to androgyny in dance," she said. "This androgyny refers to being neutral on stage, and dance that is non-gender specific. 

Dance in the nineties involves on the body. no stereotypes, a lot of "Princes and princesses are athleticism, and no borderlines not what we are dealing with in on the the demands being made the nineties," Dieckgrafe said. 
Snite exhibits classic pencil sketches 
By JOHN LUCAS 
Accent Writer 
Not all art was made to last. 
A seldom displayed collection of drawings and sketches of six­teenth and nineteenth century French and Italian masters will be featured at the Snite Museum of Art as part of the Wisdom-Heilly Collection. 
The collection of drawings, which will remain on display until June 13, is unique in that the medium features pencils rather than paints. Since the drawings are sensitive to light exposure, they can only be displayed for short periods of time. 
Due to their delicate nature, the full collection was last displayed in 1983, according to Lucille Brodie, staff executive of the Friends of the Snite. 
"The exhibit has kept in drawers to preserve the drawings from the light, while several different pieces have been displayed at certain times for drawing shows," Brodie said. 
Consisting of the rare sheets of such old masters as Veronese, Campagnola, Lippi, and the landscapes studies of Dupre, paubingy, and Corot, the collection consists of 66 pieces. Sixty are currently being displayed. 
The Wisdom-Reilly collection was named for John Wisdom, the original keeper of the collection, who compiled the collection over a twenty year period. John Reilly, a Notre Dame alumni, acquired it, and then donated it to the Snite Museum. 
"While the collection was not formed with a strictly didactic purpose in mind, it clearly constitutes a rich representation of the important schools of I tali an Renaissance draftsmanship, and presents a very complete picture of mid­nineteenth century French landscape drawing," Chief Curator Steven Spiro said. 
According to Brodie, both Reilly and the University felt that it was important for the Snite Museum to host exhibitions of original art. 
"Reilly and the University saw the need for original works for students to study," she said. 
Despite being unique because of its light sensitivity, the Wisdom-Reilly collection is important for its focus on lesser known artists who were connected to the nineteenth century French "return to the land" movement. 
"While the names Ingres, Delacroix, Daumier, and Degas will assuredly be considered among the most significant draftsman, the drawings of such other artists as Henri Lehmann, Eugene Lami and Auguste Raffet offer a fascinating array of other stylistic options," according to Spiro. 
In addition to hosting the collection, the Snite will hold a Noontalk, on April 20, which will feature Bernard Doering, professor of romance language and literature. Doering will probe the relationship between art and literature by reading of two works of French poetry of the period, and examining their connection to the art of the time. 
"As a group, the Wisdom­Reilly French drawings show us that there is still much to be learned and appreciated in the field of nineteenth-century French drawings," Spiro said.

The Festival will be on Friday. Saturday, the week will close with a Latin American Bash. The bash will take place at South Dining Hall and will feature the Chicago group Diego Real and his Combo and Notre Dame's own Tiempo Latino, "the only Latin American band on Campus." 
According to Cantillo, the International Festival is sure to be one of the highlights of the week. 
"We want the ISO to be an instru­ment... where each culture has something to contribute," Cantillo said. 
Many performers said they are getting excited about the festival. Angie Luzio, who will be the emcee for the performance, is also in charge of the Phillipino group.

In the Phillipino Group performance, members of the ND/SMC Phillipine Club will perform a dance called Tinikling. In Tinikling, "two bamboo poles are pounded together," said Luzio. "The ­performers are birds who avoid farmers traps by dancing around in between the poles. It's a very traditional dance," she added. 
Representing America at the performance will be Troop Notre Dame (TND). According to Priscilla Peralta, a member of TND, the group will continue their involvement with the festival by dancing to the sounds of Bobby Brown and PM Dawn. 
Peralta encouraged everyone to come to the performance, especially people who haven't been to one before. 
"When else is there a chance to see a Korean dance, a Lithuanian dance, and a Phillipino dance all in the same night?" Peralta asked. 
The International Festival will take place at 7:30 pm on Friday at the Century Center's Bendix Theater and will last about two hours. The cost of the festival is $3 for students and $5 for others.

Short fiction from Ireland will come to Notre Dame as Michael Collins, Notre Dame graduate and former track star, reads from his latest work, "The Man who Dreamt of Lobsters," today, according to Dennis Moore, director of Public Relations. 
Collins, originally from Limerick, Ireland, received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from Notre Dame, studied under a track scholarship during his undergraduate years. 
While Collins' track career took him through his first three years at Notre Dame, he left the track team his junior year, and took his first writing class during his senior year. This was Collins' first experience with writing, Moore said. 
"He had done absolutely no writing until he took a writing course his senior year." 
-Dennis Moore 
"He had done absolutely no writing until he took a writing course his senior year," Moore said. 
This inspired Collins to further pursue writing, and he studied Creative Writing in Notre Dame's newly instated writing program after receiving his Bachelor's degree in 1987. 
''(Collins) was the first person to receive our Master's in Creative Writing after we established that program," Moore said. 
Collins is currently studying for a PhD. in English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He and his wife, Heidi, (Notre Dame, '91) live in Chicago, where she works for a computer software firm. Collins teaches basic computer skills to the University's Arts and Letters students and runs his own computer networking and software firm. 
Collins first interest is writing, according to Moore. Working on his latest collection of short stories, "The Life and Times of a Teaboy," has been Collins' latest endeavor. 
Today, Collins will read from his collection of short stories, "The Man who Dreamt of Lobsters." 
"They're mostly stories about contemporary life in Ireland," Moore said. 
Collins will read in 122 Hayes-Healy at 4:30 p.m. and a reception will follow the presentation. 
The reading is sponsored by the English department and the graduate Creative Writing program.

IIILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. {AP) -Bernhard Langer said Wednesday that all the distrac­tions caused by winning the Masters might keep him from doing well at the Heritage Clas­sic this week. 
"I've had lots of demands the last few days," said Langer, who won for the second time at Augusta National on Sunday with a 4-stroke victory over Chip Beck. "My preparation hasn't been ideal." 
Langer said he is making more time to deal with his in­creased popularity since the Masters' victory. That's left him very little time to get ready for the Harbour Town Golf Links, where the Heritage will start on Thursday. 
''I've had phone calls and messages from all over the place," he said. "I could easily spend the next eight hours on the phone." 
The distractions didn't seem to bother him eight years ago, when Langer followed his Mas­ters' title with a win at the Her­itage. And while his practice time may be down, the 35-year-
Love, the Heritage winner in 1987, 1991 and 1992, is trying to forget a poor Masters per­formance in which he shot 76 and 77 the last two rounds. 
"I put it behind me on Satur­day after 13," he said. "I said, 'All right, it ain't going to hap­pen this year.' I've done all I can do, except get in there and play well." 
Love's played very well at Harbour Town, winning three of his five appearances at the seaside course. He led after ev­ery round last year and ended at 269, four strokes ahead of Chip Beck and one oiT Stewart's 72-hole tournament record. Love thinks he has an advan­tage at the Sea Pines Resort course, but only a slight one. 
"I know how to· play this golf course," Love said. "I can shoot a low score if I have confidence, but can shoot a 75 if I'm not playing well." 
He opened the season with a win at the Tournament of Champions and tied for second in the Nestle Invitational last month, making almost $300,000 so far this season.

football team. 
They have a new coach in Wade Phillips and a new, pass­oriented offense. 
"It's the Bill Walsh system," Phillips said. "As far as philos­ophy is concerned, try to make 3, 4 and 5-yard gains instead of trying to run it every time." 
Under Dan Reeves, the Bron­cos struggled to establish a bal­anced attack, then unleash John Elway in the game's wan­ing moments. The approach often worked: Elway has pro­duced 31 fourth-quarter come­backs (30 wins, 1 tie) in his 10­year career. 
But Phillips won't wait to uti­lize Elway's considerable tal­ents. 
"I think our best chances for success are to get the ball to our best player and let him do what he does best," Phillips said. "John Elway can do any­thing, but it doesn't take long to recognize what a great passer he is. He's a phenomenal talent. 
"His great strength is his great ability to throw the ball wherever, whenever and to whoever -and then also to be able to get out of situations that most quarterbacks can't get out of to make a great play. That added to his passing ability makes him unique." 
But a passing attack implies quarterback sacks. 
"To be able to pass. of course. he can't get sacked 50-some times," Phillips said. In 1992, the Broncos allowed their quarterbacks to be sacked 52 times. 
"We do think the system will help us some, in that he'll get rid of the ball {quickly)," he said. 
Phillips said the new offense requires Elway to drop back five steps and throw, as op­posed to the seven-step drop he has employed previously. 
"We're going to try to sur­round our best asset {Elway) with as many good people as old German feels his attitude is near its peak. 
"My confidence is very high at the moment and I believe I can pull oiT shots," Langer said. 
Two weeks before the Mas­ters, he finished second to Nick Price at the Players Champi­onship. His latest victory left him on top of the PGA's money list with $609,500 in three events. 
Langer finished the Masters with a final-round 70 for a 277 total and the most lopsided win at Augusta since Seve Balles­teros won by four shots in 1983. However, he said none of that matters this week. 
"I live in the future and will concentrate on the task at hand," he said. 
That means facing a field which includes three-time win­ner Davis Love III; two-time champions Stewart. Hale Irwin and Tom Watson; and former PGA champions John Daly and Nick Price. 
This is Langer's first appear­ance at the Heritage since 1989, when he tied for third behind Payne Stewart.

extremely hard to figure out. When they play in the thin air of Colorado Springs they are a very good team, but when they get out on the road they play poorly. Obviously this is a very erratic squad who shouldn't play well for the simple fact that they are in rainy, dreary South Bend. 
But Corrigan isn't so sure. "A win versus Notre Dame would wipe the slate clean for them this season. It would be a huge win." 
So the Falcon lacrosse team arrives today looking for the upset over the #16 Irish. Coach Corrigan will look to junior at­tackers Randy Colley and Robbie Snyder to lead the of­fensive charge and dispatch the gutty Falcons early in the game. 
If Notre Dame can recapture their intensity of past perfor­mances, they should be able to handle Air Force, just as in last year's 15-10 victory over the Falcons. 
But if the Irish come out and play lethargically, the upset is not out of the realm of possibilities.

Towers dominating Blue league 
Zahm, Sorin atop Gold standings 
By JEFF ENES Sports Writer 
The towers on campus are also towers in the interhall lacrosse blue league. Both Flanner and Grace have three wins and one tie entering the season's final games tonight. 
The games start at 8:00 at the Loftus Center. Grace is matched up against lowly Fisher (0-4), while Planner must play a fiesty Dillon team (2-1). Off­Campus (1-2) will also play Morrissey 
(1-3). 
Grace and Planner are both talented teams, each with a few players of varsity experience. Nevertheless, both teams point to teamwork as the key to their teams success. 

Grace is lead on offense by freshman Pat VanDenbroek, who is averaging two goals a game. Eric Hupfer is one of Grace's top defensemen, and goalie Sean Hyer is limiting opponents to less than three goals a game. 
However, Grace's captain Michael McMahon points out it is not one player that makes their team. In fact, a increase in talented players has left Grace seven backups to work in the game. "We have a lot of talented players, so our key is to work together and play well as a team," said McMahon 
Two ex-varsity players, Jason Pett and Mark Carolin, lead the Planner squad. With their talent and experience, Flanner seems to be a favorite to win it all. But because of two forfeits the last two weeks, they have not played in a game since the last week of March. 
"I am not really sure of our chances 
since we've won two by forfeit," said 
Pett. 
Look for a well-played, intense Lacrosse game if the towers should meet down the toad. Both are assured of an upper division playoff spot, and tonight they play for the title of regular season champs and the top playoff spot. 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Sports Writer 
With the playoffs right around the corner, play in the interhalllacrosse gold league will be heating up as teams vie for the three playoff spots. Zahm and Sorin both sport undefeated records and will play for the all-important first round bye, while Stanford and Carroll will fight for the final spot. 
In this matchup, Carroll holds the upper hand, having already won the team's regular season head-to-head competition. 
The Zahm squad has used a tenacious, pressuring defense to jump out to an undefeated record. "We've got to credit our defense for our wins," noted captain Dave Shepard. "Chip Taunt has been our best player and has led the team on the defensive end." 
Taunt and Pat McHugh have been the defensive catalysts for victories, but this is also a balanced team on the offensive end, capable of putting up points in a hurry. Scorers Brian Klem and Dan Thieke have carried the load offensively. 
Sorin has also run out to an undefeated record, relying on its unsung hero in the nets, goalie Jeff Shea. "Jeff has been making saves left and right and playing very strong. He's not afraid to stand up and make the stop," said captain Paul Villa. 
Sorin is by no means a one man team though, as defenders Scott Curtis and Jeff Thieke have been preventing oppo­nents from getting easy shots, while midfielders Kevin Krayer and Kevin McGrath have lent offensive support and balance to the team. 
Going into the playoffs, captain Villa is not relying on a different strategy than what got Sorin there. "We'll go at it with everything we've got, and hopefully things will work out," noted Villa.

Very few people I know like to "go to confession." It is a moment of vulnerability and surrender. For most modern~day Christians and Catholics, it is an awkward time, just as well to be avoided, or at best tolerated twice a year. 
My meditation today is on the sadness of that truth. 
In the old church, pre~ Vatican II, before most people on this campus were 
born, (our young people must be tired of hearing about that old 
church...), good Catholics went to confession perhaps twice a month and 
listed their discretions clearly ~ "I was angry with my husband, I had bad 
thoughts, I spoke gossip about my neighbor." In response, they heard 
words of forgiveness, promised to say a few prayers in-reparation, and ·came out of "the box" feeling clean. It all seemed to hang together. 
When the Church "changed," and rethought itself, one of the most striking losers was this holy sacrament. If before, jillions of people lined up on a Saturday afternoon for a washing of their soul, suddenly now Father sat in the box with cleansing words awaiting, and nowhere to put his suds. Folks were self~actualized, guilt~free, and exploring. 
I had a terrible experience in confession. As a senior in high school, some priest insisted we all go to face~to~face confession with him alone, and I think he was sick. Nowadays, it would be called abuse, but what he made me say and see that day left me so scarred that I was unable to return to the sacrament for nine years of stupid pain, unnecessary fear. 
Happily, when I was a new and ymmg priest, I had a wiser, older pastor who understood how much people had suffered from the changed experience of this sacrament. Together, we decided to preach about "reconciliation" ~ the new word at the time ~ and we preached for months, inviting people to come back and try again. No one would be mocked for bringing a "laundry list," no one would be dumped on for not knowing "how to begin." 
In the sacrament, we sought to pray together. The penitent and I would thank God for the goodness of God's mercy, and for the truth of God's forgiveness. Slowly, slowly, more people showed up to pray and share; slowly, slowly, healing words could be spoken again. 
This Sunday's Gospel quotes Jesus, speaking on the very night of His resurrection, and telling His followers that "whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven; whose sins you shall hold bound, they are held bound." 
Traditionally, this directive was understood to be the basis for the priest's power to forgive sins. I wouldn't argue with that. 
More powerfully, however, it seems also to be a directive to all of us ~ that we all be people of reconciliation and hope, of forgiveness and healing in every opportunity of our lives. Some people resent the sacrament of reconciliation because it seems to say that only the priest can forgive sins. That can't be true. Most of us know that each of us can and must reach out in times of pain and alienation and heal those who suffer and feel most cut off from love. Every Christian must be Christ, now, in His resurrected Spirit, and seek to heal the world. 
Knowing this will not diminish the traditional grace available in the community's honored avenue for healing, the holy sacrament. There, in a way lifted up by the prayers of Christians everywhere, the Church's minister can say healing words and offer challenging call, and lead the penitent soul to again believe in God's love. 
Easter announces hope ~ all pain and death are swallowed up in life and love eternal. The sacrament of reconciliation ~ confession ~ does the same. 
It would be a shame if we lost this time~tested avenue of grace. Try it some time.

ATLANTA -Mike Harkey came off the disabled list Wednesday and pitched 7 1-3 shutout innings as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Atlanta Braves 6-0. 
The Braves, who entered the game hitting .199, were shut out for the second time in 10 games. 
Harkey (1-0). activated from the 15-day DL earlier in the day, gave up four hits, struck out five and walked two. 
The right-hander, placed on the disabled list on March 27 to continue rehabilitation of his left knee, was removed from the game after walking Otis Nixon with one out in the eighth inning. Bob Scanlan relieved and got out of the inning before Randy Myers finished. 
Jeff Blauser had three of the Braves' six hits. 
Jose Vizcaino, hitting .148 entering the game, had a sac­rifice fly in the second inning off Pete Smith (1-1) and a two-run double in the sixth. The three RBis tied a career high.

over the San Francisco Giants. 
The Marlins snapped the Giants' four-game winning streak. 
One day before the Atlanta Braves were to arrive for a four-game series, manager Dusty Baker held both Barry Bonds and Will Clark out of the starting lineup because of in­juries. 
Bonds pinch hit in the eighth, bouncing out to first base, and Clark popped out to second in the ninth. Bonds strained his right hamstring on Monday and missed Tuesday's game, while Clark was resting a nagging leg injury to his left leg. 
Mets 6, Rockies 3 

DENVER-Sid Fernandez held the Colorado Rockies to one hit in five shutout innings before leaving with stiffness in his left shoulder, and the New York 
Mets  held  on  to  beat  the  
Colorado  Rockies  6-3  
Wednesday night.  

Fernandez (1-0), whose de­parture was termed precau­tionary, did not allow a hit until Andres Galarraga led off the fifth with a sharp single to left field. Of the 15 batters he re­tired, nine hit the ball in the air, most of them on harmless fly balls except for Charlie Hayes' long drive which Ryan Thompson caught at the base of the left-center field wall in the fourth. 
Fernandez threw only 40 pitches and, despite two walks, faced only one batter over the minimum, thanks to two Col­orado runners who were caught stealing. 
Mike Draper relieved Fer­nandez in the sixth and held the Rockies scoreless through two more innings, allowing only one other hit, until Colorado scored in the eighth on Eric Young's three-run triple. 
Mike Maddux pitched 1 1-3 innings for his first save as a Met, allowing one hit. 
Earlier in the day, the agent for Fernandez broke off con­tract negotiations with Mets general manager Al Harazin. 
Tom Selakovich, the pitcher's agent, said general manager Al Harazin had rejected his latest offer of a two-year deal for $7 million. Selakovich said he had wanted a two-year deal for $8 million but lowered the total because Fernandez wants to stay in New York. 
The Mets got hits from their leadoff batter in each of the first four innings, but continued to strand runners and had to settle for single runs in the first and second. After leaving a club record-tying 15 batters on base Tuesday night, they left 14 on base. 
Vince Coleman led off the game with a triple off the cen­ter-field wall and scored on Tony Fernandez's sacrifice fly off Bryn Smith (1-1). 
Thompson opened the second inning with a single, was sacri­ficed to second, and scored on Coleman's single. 
Phillies 9, Reds 2 

PHILADELPHIA-The Phillies beat Cincinnati to sweep the Reds at home for the first time in 25 years, improving to a major-league best 8-1 with its fifth straight victory. The best start in team history came in 1915, when the Phillies got off to an 8-0 record. 
Wes Chamberlain had three hits, drove in two runs and threw out a runner at the plate for the Phillies. Mariano Dun­can had three hits and scored twice, Juan Bell hit an RBI dou­ble and a single and Pete lncav­iglia drove in three runs. 
Ben Rivera (1-1) pitched six shutout innings, allowing four hits, striking out seven and walking four for the victory. Loser Tom Browning (0-2) gave up up five hits and five runs in 4 2-3 innings. 
Astros 9, Expos 5 
MONTREAL-Houston won its 

-
fifth straight road game as Ken Caminiti drove in two runs to help the Astros beat Montreal. The Astros started the season with three straight losses at home against Philadelphia, but swept a three-game series at New York over the weekend. 
 
Houston scored two runs on wild pitches, including the go­ahead run in a three-run sev­enth to take the lead as the Ex­pos again missed closer John Wetteland, out with a broken toe. The Astros rallied for seven runs in the seventh inning in a 9-6 victory on Tuesday against Montreal. 
Mark Portugal (2-0) pitched six innings, giving up five runs and four hits. Reliever Mike Gardiner (0-1) gave up three runs and didn't record an out in the seventh.

CHICAGO (AP) -Michael Jor­dan scored 15 of his 34 points in the third quarter Wednesday night, leading Chicago past the Miami Heat 119-92 for the Bulls' 12th victory in 14 games. 
The Bulls remained one game behind the New York Knicks in the race for the best record in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks beat the Hornets 111­107 in Charlotte. 
Chicago, which has won four straight, snapped Miami's three-game winning streak and knocked the Heat three games behind Indiana and Detroit in the battle for the last Eastern Conference playoff spot. 
The Bulls outscored Miami 37­23 to build a 91-63 lead en­tering the final quarter, which was played mostly by bench players. 
With Chicago ahead 58-43 with 9:41 left in the third quarter, Miami's Grant Long was hit with two technical fouls and Brian Shaw with another after Long had been called for an offensive foul. Jordan, who did not play in the fourth quar­ter, sank all three free throws, giving Chicago a 61-43 lead. 
Horace Grant added 20 points for the Bulls and Will Perdue had 14. For Miami, Harold Miner scored 19 points and Steve Smith had 18. 
The shot of the night was made by Dan Calhoun, 23, of Bloomington, III., a fan who won $1 million in a contest. His three-quarter court overhand shot from the opposite free throw line swished through the net during a timeout in the third quarter. 
Knicks 111, Hornets 107 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-Patrick Ewing scored 17 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter Wednesday night, leading the New York Knicks to a 111-107 victory over the Charlotte Hor­nets. 
The Knicks' fourth straight win kept them one game ahead of Chicago, which beat Miami, in the race for first place in the Eastern Conference. The Hor­nets remained in seventh place in the conference standings, but the loss left them just one-half game out of eighth. 
In the decisive fourth quarter, the Knicks made 13 of 18 shots and outscored the Hornets 32­
22. Charlotte was 8 of 24 in the period. 
Going almost exclusively to Ewing, New York rallied from a 91-84 deficit to go ahead 96-95 on his basket from the lane

Irish lacrosse looks to rebound against Air Force 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 

After suffering their first loss of the season over the weekend, the 16th-ranked Notre Dame (8-1) lacrosse team attempts to rebound with a victory against the visiting Falcons of the Air Force Academy at 3:00 
p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium. In the case of inclement weather, the game will be 
moved inside Loftus. 
The challenge for the Irish in this afternoon's game will be to recapture the aggressive play that was Jacking in their 13-7 Joss at Duke on Friday. One very important aspect to regaining intensity will depend on how the Irish

midfielders play. Randy Colley 
The starting line of juniors Willie Sutton and Billy Ahmuty and freshman Rob Tobin will need to scoop up more ground balls than they did against the Blue Devils, where they were thoroughly outplayed. The second and third lines will also have to step up and help out with the likes of senior Ed Lamb and sophomores Marc Pasquale and Kevin Lynyak contributing on both offense and defense. 
"As midfielders, we know we didn't play aggressively against Duke, so we're looking forward to the Air Force game to regain our confidence and intensity," said Ahmuty. 
Sophomore goalie Ryan Jewell will start in net for the Irish against the Falcons. Jewell had a strong game versus Duke with 22 saves, and will be relied upon to lead the defensive effort. 
Coach Kevin Corrigan knows that his team will have to step up and play for a full 60 minutes if they are to beat a very scrappy and aggressive Falcon squad. "Whenever you play an academy team, you know that they are going to play hard, be able to go all day, and play tough," he said. 
Adding to danger that this Air Force team poses for the Irish is the fact that three of their top six scorers are on their first mid­field, a line that Corrigan considers dangerous. 
The fact that Air Force plays such a team-oriented game will force the Irish to play the Falcons in a full ten-on-ten situation. "Their team play concerns me, so we're going to have to concentrate on our riding and clearing," noted Corrigan. 
The Air Force team that coach Tom Duggan brings to Notre Dame is one that is

Kobata continues hot
Men's volleyball heads to nationals 
By KEVIN DOLAN Sports Writer 

After weeks of anticipation and a successful season, the Irish men's volleyball team is on
.. 
its way to the National Club Collegiate Volleyball tourna­ment in Austin, Texas, which will run from today until Satur­day. 
According to Brian Ceponis, the Irish "should win" their first pool. The Irish are seeded No. 2 in their pool behind UC-Davis, with Iowa and Virginia Tech rounding out the pool. 

"We've seen Davis," said Pat Madden, "and we know we can beat them if we play welL" 
The Irish are looking to im­prove on last year's 17th-place finish, hoping to break into the top 10. To do that, they will have to beat some of the top clubs in the nation, such as Cal­Berkeley, Graceland, MIVA champion Ohio State, and Sacramento State. 
To beat those teams, Madden offered a very simple formula. 
"We have to get the ball to Ceponis," Madden said. "That's where passing comes in. If we pass well, Brian gets good balls to hit, and we can go a long way from there."

Freshmen Miguel Ascencio and Bill Haney have shown that they can fill in ably, and veteran Chris Murdy may also be asked to step into the middle blocker position. Murdy, the third Irish senior, was philosophical about his role at Nationals. "I just want us to do well," said Murdy. "If we get on a roll,

Terri Kobata's pitching per­formance yesterday against 

Valpariso was a real I e ,t d o w n compared to start against Dayton on Monday. 
Not that it was a bad 



outing-it's Terri Kobata not easy to be perfect every day. 
Kobata, who threw a no-hit­ter against Dayton three days ago, led the Notre Dame soft­ball team (19-11) to a 4-0 vic­tory with a one-hit complete game shutout at Ivy Field yesterday. The second game of the doubleheader was cancelled in the fourth inning because of rain. 
All of Notre Dame's offensive activity came in the first inning. Sophomore left fielder Liz Goetz, who went 2 for 3, singled to drive in catcher Sara Hayes with the first run of the game. Two batters later, Casey McMurray (2 for 3) doubled to drive in two more runs. Right fielder Lisa Miller's ground out plated the final Irish run.

Kobata, on the other hand, was not upset to be the recipi­ent of an early four-run inning. 
"It helps to get offensive sup­port like that in the first inning. You just feel a lot more com­fortable pitching with a 4-0 lead." 
Kobata (7-3) had another no­hitter going into the fifth inning, but Valpariso's Krista Bane broke it up with a solid double. The Irish pitcher allowed only one other batter to reach base (hit by pitch), striking out 12 batters and walking none. 
While Kobata's numbers from the game look imposing on paper, Miller explained that her young pitcher still has room to improve. 
"This was only her second game back [after an eight-day layoff due to injury], so she still hasn't quite settled in yet. She wasn't throwing her pitches exactly where she wanted them." 
The Irish were winning the second game of the double­header 2-0 when the game was called off in the bottom of the fourth inning.

"We tried to get five innings in to make it official," explained Miller. "But it got to a point where I didn't want to risk any injuries to our team."
