'Accuracy in Academia' stifles creativity in the classroom 
There is a group which is trying to do a favor for stu­dents: making sure professors are not presenting stu­dents with misinformation. 
This conservative group is Accuracy in Academia, and it is an offshoot of the 16-year-old Accuracy in Media. 
Malcom Lawrence, its first president, said in an inter­view in Campus Voice magazine, the purpose ofAlA is "to find our ifthe leftist bias among reporters and media personnel originates in the university classroom." 
Lawrence intends to achieve this goal by recruiting unpaid monitors to observe selected classes, par­ticularly those in the humanities. 
These monitors report back to the group, and ifthese defenders ofconservativism find what they perceive to be a liberal bias, they will prelisure either the professor or the university itself to ensure that the conservative view also is presented. 
Lawrence defends the

If the group is so interested in facts, it should be monitoring those classes with the greatest quantity of facts presented: math and science classes. 
Instead, it is concentrating its efforts on humanities classes, which present fewer facts along with more opinion.

claims does not present anything except anti-nuclear propaganda. 
In response to this professor's perceived liberal bias, the newsletter suggests readers write to the university condemning the professor or send money to AlA so it can distribute the book, "H1e Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear," to the 200 students currently en­rolled in the class. 
Even though AlA may have a right to defend its own views, it is questionable whether it has the right to enter rhe classroom to do this. 
An outside group entering a classroom doing what really should be done by students themselves un­dermines what possibly may be the most important aspect of an education -the ability to analyze views presented and argue intelligently when it is necessary. 
Lawrence claims the group must do this because col­lege students are "children." This point is also arguable because even the American legal system considers anyone 18 years ofage 
AlA is entering areas in which it does not belong, not to mention stifling the atmosphere of free intellectual expression of ideas by making professors reconsider presenting controversial ideas. 
AlA is not doing anyone any favors.

"Down with killer Carbide, drown Anderson in chemicals," they shouted. 
Protest leaders said they planned to bum one effigy for each victim in the Dec. 2 to 3, 1984, industrial dis­aster, the world's worst. 
Government offices, schools, shops and markets in Bhopal were closed Tuesday in memory of the victims. Motorscooter rickshaws and mini-buses, the principal means of transportation in the city of 900,000, stayed off the roads. 
Black flags flew over homes in most ofthe slums around the Bhopal plant while the victims marked the anniversary as a "black day." 
No violence was reported in any ofthe demonstrations. 
The United News oflndia, quoting official sources, said three more slum dwellers who lived near the plant died Tuesday ofgas-related in­juries. Doctors at the city's main hospital could not confirm the report but said thousands ofvictims still suffered respiratory problems. 
One year ago more than 40 tons of deadly methyl isocyanate leaked from a storage tank and turned into a deadly cloud ofgas. The fumes smot­hered residents ofshantytowns near the plant and felled thousands of people as they fled in panic.

PORTLAND, Ore. -Police on Tuesday said they defused four similar bombs that had been mailed to four area agencies that perform abortions or provide birth control information. 
Three bombs were found in packllges In the main post office, and one had been delivered Monday to the Portland Women's Feminist Health Center, said police spokes­manjay Decker. 
Staffers at the center became suspicious of the packllge and called police, said the center's Executive Director, Gerl Craig. She said staffers have been trained to be alert for suspicious packllges and letters. 
Decker said the bomb was power­ful enough to kill or injure several people. He refused to give details, saying an Investigation was proceed­ing. 
Police said the three bombs they found at Portland's main post office were addressed to Dr. Peter Bours of Forest Grove, the Lovejoy Surgicenter of Portland and a Planned Parenthood office in Beaverton. 
Abortions are performed at Bours' clinic and the Lovejoy Surgicenter. The Planned Parenthood office dis­tributes birth control Information but performs no abortions.

Reagan requests tax bill support 
good start, not an end product." 
"Any legislation that ends up retarding economic growth, and thereby diminishing the number of jobs upon which American families depend, is not what we mean by 'tax reform'," the president said. 
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) told reporters earlier that Reagan will have to persuade at least 75 of the 182 House Republicans to vote for the Democratic-written bill if it stands a chance of passing. "We're going to need Republican votes -there's no question about it," he said. -Congressional leaders have said no tax-overhaul plan can pass the House without Reagan's active sup­port.

. founded in 1980. "Andwhat's wrong with our media which doesn't really play this up?" he said. "One side stops and the other doesn't even know it." 
Despite the present situation, Muller said, he's "very optimistic in the long run," because of "tremendous progress" made in the last five years in the public's aware­ness ofthe nuclear issue. 
The next step, the Harvard faculty member said, is for people to learn to live with nuclear weapons be­cause such weapons "are with us forever . . . The knowledge can­not be destroyed." 
Muller, who is on a leave of ab­sence as an IPPNW officer but remains a member, said the physicians' peace group faced several problems at its inception. 
"It was a scary time,"lie said. "We had no money, no staff, we all had other jobs. It was a very difficult time." 
Other problems faced by the IP­PNW, which now has more than 135,000 members in 41 countries, were the American doctors' worry of being viewed as "left-wing propaganda agents" and the public's initial reaction to the group. 
"The immediate response to us was 'You're a dangerous group. You're doctors who are going to have some influence in the West ... You'll have no influence in the Soviet Union,' " Muller said. "That was the hypothesis five years ago." 
But they were wrong, said Muller, who appeared on Soviet television in 1982 speaking the Russian he learned while at Notre Dame. "We had some success on both sides."

WASHINGTON President Reagan asked the House yesterday to support the tax overhaul bill proposed by Democrats, despite a prediction by a House GOP leader that many Republicans would decline such a White House request. 
Reagan said the tax mc!asure ap­proved by the Democratic-run House Ways and Means Committee and the alternative proposed by the panel's Republican members, as well as his original proposal, all "represent substantial pro1~ess from current law." 
"True tax reform is imperative," he said in a written statement. "The first step must begin with a positive vote in the House of Representatives. I urge members of the House to act affirmatively on this important matter." 
Republicans have said they will of­fer their proposal as a substitute when the tax bill comes up for a vote in the House. But with the Democr~Lts in the majority, the final vote is expected to be on the Democratic plan. 
"We do not want to risk damaging, perhaps irreparably, an entire year's effort to achieve real tax reform, so I strongly believe the legislative process must be allowed to go for­ward," Reagan said. 
He added, however, that the House biill "can onlybe considered a

America changed 30 years ago by tired woman 
30 years ago this week a small tired woman rode the bus home from work ... 30 years ago this week a movement began and a leader emerged ... 30 years ago this week America was to be changed irrevocably ... 
It began simply enough. As a matter offact, it might not have begun at all had it not been for a pair of tired feet. "It" is the civil rights movement which originated on Dec. 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama. The pair of tired feet belonged to Rosa Parks who, on that un­seasonably warm December day, boarded a Montgomery City Lines bus to go home. Due to the color of her skin, she sat in the back section of the bus as the law required. 
Martin Rogers 
guest column 
Because it was rush hour, as the bus passed through town it became more and more crowded. Finally at one ofthe stops, six whites got on and the driver left his seat and asked six blacks to give up their seats to the white patrons. This was an age-old custom which excited no undue comment. Three Negroes rose immediately. Rosa Parks and her tired feet, however, remained seated_ The driver again asked her to yield her place and once more this gentle, soft-spoken woman politely refused. Agitated and astonished, the driver summoned police who arrested Rosa Parks for violating the city's segregation ordinances. 

The arrest of Parks unifed and focused the discontent ofthe entire black community. Al­most immediately following her incident on the bus, leafiets were sent out to the roughly 50,000 black residents of Montgomery which read: 
"Don't ride the bus to work, to town, to school or any place Monday, December '5. Another Negro woman has been arrested and pur in jail because she refused to give up her bus sear. Come to a mass-meeting Monday at 7 
p.m. at the Holt Street Baptist Church for fur­ther instructions." 
And thus, because of an ordinary, 42-year­old, black seamstress the "Montgomery Bus Boycott" and thereby the civil rights move­ment began. When that Monday came the buses were empty. So effective was the one-day boycott that it was continued and stretched out to 382 days until all of the busing and several other of the city segrega­tion ordinances were abolished. 
A young preacher was chosen to 1ipeak at that "mass-meeting Monday at 7." A young preacher who would become the leader ofthe "Montgomery Bus Boycott." A young preac­her who would emerge as the voice of his people. A young preacher who would enun­ciate a doctrine oflove and wield the powerof Ghandian non-violence. That young preacher was Martin Luther King. 
The 382-day boycott, spawned by Rosa Parks, changed and molded Martin Luther King. King, thus transformed, changed and molded America. 
But why did all this happen? Why did Parks stand -or rather sit -her groundl and refuse to move? 
King would later state that Parks had been "tracked down by the 'Zeitgeist'-the spirit of the times." 
Parks would give a much more simplistic answer as was her character and nature, "I really don't know why ... there was no plan at all ... I was just tired ... my feet hurt." 
Where these two responses intersect is the reason for Montgomery. At its inception, the civil rights movement was a consequence of pain -the physical pain of sore feet and per­haps more importantly the pain of the human spirit -and proper timing. 
Park's act provided her people with a sym­bol to give them power over their fears, a con­crete instrument to hold in their hands (The boycott/ movement) and a leader to guide their way (King.) Indeed Park's act could not have occurred at a more appropriate time in history. Without Parks it might be argued that I, a black student, would not be writing this article or even in college. 
Finally, it is noteworthy to mention, ob­viously with the aid of hindsight, that it was King really that the Zeitgeist was seeking. Indeed, it was King that the times had "tracked down" and it would be King, as a result ofParks who would shape history. Parks marked the beginning of the end of an era of injustice. An era of injustice which has been tempered by King but still continues.

Beauty and novelty of sn<tw soon will wear off 
To those Notre Dame freshman wbo bail from warmer climates. 
Yes, all that white fluffy stuffon the ground is commonly referred to as snow. For most of you this will be your first winter in a winter climate. Yes, it does look pretty as it falls from the sky and clings to the branches on every tree. But believe me, by the time March rolls around you will be sick ofall this snow. 
Eric Bergamo 
across the eighth dimension 
March? I hear you ask. It snows until March? Well, some years it has been known to snow quite heavily in April. 

Now admit it, you were fascinated the first time you saw the snow. You went outside and built a snowman or two and threw a few snow­balls in the annual "civil war" between the quads. But the novelty quickly wears offwhen you have to walk to class everyday through the snow, which quickly turns into slush once the temperature rises above freezing. Add to that dodging snowplows driven by the same workers who tore about the campus on their lawnmowers during the fall. 
But along with this snow comes its close relative, cold. You can't h:1ve snow without cold temperatures and that cold attacks with a vengeance. Below zero temperatures are common is this region.lfthat isn't enough, the wind can make it seem 10 times colder than what the thermometer says. If you had been outside Sum.~y night when those gale force gusts were tearing through the campus, you would have quickly learned what the term "wind <:hill" means. 
You will learn many new words this first winter, such as "lake effect snow," "traveler's advisory" and the ever popular "winter storm warning." This last word means that you might wake up to find a snowdrift coming up to your third floor room. You'll soon start watching Dick Addis and his weather report every night to find out how much snow will fall and how cold it will be the next day. 
I'm sorry if I have ruined your lunch by tel­ling you all this, but it is true. You will soon consid:r a daily high of 40 degrees to be "warm." You will begin to look upon sunny .days as a gift from God. Dreams ofbright sun­shine and warm temperatures will fill your thoughts. Each day home on break, back in your sun and warmth, will be treasured before you have to return to the snow and cold. 
Don't worry, winter does not last forever. (Though it seems to last for an eternity.)Just dress warm, throw a few extra blankets on the bed and take it all in stride. There are only four months until spring rolls around. It is a little disappointing it is still officially fall.

Logic behind the fight never quite understood 
Dear Editor: 
As I sit here watching the Bear's game, the annual tradition known as the North-South snowball fight begins outside. In four years here at Notre Dame, I have yet to understand the logic behind this event. It begins some­how and moves into North Quad like a'ilow elephant. After using Zahm for target practice they hope to gain enough men and motivation to move on down to Dillon and the rest of South Quad. 
In the attempt to prove their manhood, the battlelines are drawn and no matter who is injured the tradition must go on. Two years ago while warming up at Zahm, the warriors began their ruget practice with a few win­dows·-no matter that there were people be-

I had hoped in my year abroad since then that something was learned around this place, but I guess I was wrong. The gallant warriors are beginning to return to their strongholds now. I wonder what the damage will be this year? 'Tis a shame they had to ruin the beauty and tranquility of this night after our first snow. At least I have the pictures I took to speak of the peace that reigned before the animals were let out oftheir cages.

Faust leaves as winner in one ND fan's book 
Dear Editor. 
fhe resignation ofGerry Faust affects every person differently. For me, the day I heard he resigned will be a day I will long remember. Faust was Notre Dame. He stood for what we as Catholics, and even Christians, believe. He lived his beliefs on and off the field, always trying his best to succeed. Although he did not accomplish his goal, Faust never gave up. He believed in his team and Notre Dame as a whole. Faust may go down in the record book 'as a losing coach, but in my book he is a win­

A glimpse at Roma 
Dynasty II: The Bores 
ERIC M. BERGAMO

T 
his is my overall reaction to 
"Dynasty II: The Colbys." 
Yawn. 
They should have named this 
show "Dynasty II: The Bores." It is a 
listless attempt to cash in on the 
sucess of"Dynasty." There is a great 
deal ofglitter and gloss, but unfor­
tunately not much after that to keep 
the program going. 

Television 
~~~Dynasty II: 
I.The Colbys 

Yes, these California Colbys are rich. They are so rich that their mansion looks like a place where Robin Leach would stop by for a segment of"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." And they do dress to the hilt, I'd like to see how much of the program's budget is just spent on clothes, but there is nothing of interest in the show after that. 
The characters are terribly bland to the point that I really could not care what happens to them. Not that it matters, the plotlines are hopelessly mired in a mix ofcamp and melodrama. Jason Colby, the patriarch of the Colbys and played by Charlton Heston, is dying from some incurable dffiease. Well, ac­tually (as this past week's episode revealed), the doctors were wrong in their diagnosis and he is not dying. Meanwhile, Fallon, who used to look like Pamela Sue Martin but now looks like Emma Samms, is suffering from amnesia (that old soap-opera ailment) and has fallen in love with playboy Miles Colby, 
much to the chagrin ofher ex­husbandJeffColby OohnJames). Like I say, it is a mix ofcamp and melodrama. 
"Dynasty II: The Colbys" could be much better in a number of ways. They could give more sub­stance to the characters, making them more human and giving them problems that the middle class viewers could relate to might help. Cutting down on the melodrama

might also help to tighten up the 
show. 

Now don't get me wrong, there were things that I liked in this show. Charlton Heston and Barbara Stan­wyck do a respectable acting job as Jason Colby and Constance Colby, respectively. The sets and costum­ing are quite impressive to look at. But for "Dynasty II: The Colbys" to live up to its potential, they ;tre going to have to add some sub­stance to go with the style.

note the differences in attitude and writing style of those alumni who graduated after 1950 compared to those who graduated before 1950. 
The style ofone of the essays is very 
similar to the novel serials from the 
1940s and 1950s like Tom Swift and 
Chip Hilton. The Hardy Boys Go to 
Notre Dame. 
The first essay in the book, en­
titled "September Ghosts," was

Books 
Reflections in the Dome 


"Reflections In The Dome" proved me wrong on that count. These people arejust like us. So like us in fact that it scares me. The Notre Dame that they knew had different rules and different faculty and different buildings, but the University is the same. 
"Reflections In The Dome" is a 55-page book published byJuniper Press, a publishing house run by students as a class. The book was edited byJames O'Rourke and includes a forward by Father Theodore Hesburgh. After pouring over numerous essays from count­less alumni, the students in that class decided on the ten essays presented in this book. Their choices cannot be faulted. 
The essays are all well-written and points ofinterest can be found in all ofthem. It is interesting to little more than a side ofa page and it is undoubtedly the most powerful article in the book. Maich writes the essay as a patchwork ofmemories and everyday occurrences from his life at Notre Dame. Through his interpretation, these mundane happenings become something more. Something noble, I guess. This essay alone makes the slim volume worth the $4.75 price. 
The settings for these stories are sometimes unfamiliar, but the situa­tions are all too familiar. In "Bless Me, Father" byJoe Gores ('53), he details the adventure ofsneaking back on campus after a night out at South Bend bars, carefully avoiding the roaming guards prowling the campus to find curfew-breakers. Gores is not alone; he is accom­panied by a football playing friend. When one ofthe guards catches the

rently on dispaly in the Ar­

includes the best water colors, 
skectches and designs ofthe 
Notre Dame junior architeture 
students who studied in Rome. 
~ Art ~ExpoRoma 
Junior architecture students spend their first semester in '~tpe fine tuning their skecting U:itl.s. They concentrate on perspective, scale, and propor­tion. Second semester the stu­dents take their refined skills and produce striking watercolors. 
Some: of the more interesting works on display are several notebooks from field trips. Far from regular notebooks, these are the impressions ofstudents 1'_Vl}ll!P. taken to various locations ¥OUhd'Rome. Although the Students were only given a short l;.me at each site, the notebooks are highly detailed and im­aginative. 
"Being able to sketch quickly soon became habit," said Mike Wisneski, who was in Rome himself last year. 
Some notebooks combined sketches and commentary to form a highly creative artistic entity. Such creativity also helped to improve the grade that each notebook received. 
While:_ tn Rome, the students worked on three major projects. 

The level ofdifficulty increased with each. 
The first assignment was to design a fountain. Though the student could be highly creative, ~ ~>tructure had to blend into its environment. 
The second project consisted ofdrawing plans to rennovate a section of the Palazzo Spada Museum. This proved challeng­ing, since authorities in Rome do not wish to tear down existing, though crumbling, structures. 
For the third project, students could either design a library or a kindergarten. The design was for an actual site in Rome. 
The students Final Project was perhaps the most challenging. It was certainly the most im­aginative. Pliny the Elder main­tained a lavish villa on the coast. Thoughitnolongerexffits, scholars know ofits existence from references to it in Pliny's letters. From these descriptions the students designed their own version ofPliny's coastal villa 
This exhibit ffi a fine example ofthe work that architecture students do in Rome. From their sketches and designs, the magic of their experience comes alive. 
In order to fully round out the 
exhibit, a collection of 
photographs taken by ar­
chitecture students while 
abroad is also on display. 
Though many were taken in 
Italy, others are from England 
and Egypt. 
The dffiplay showcases the 
work ofmany talented students. 
But at the same time, it gives the 
common student a glimpse of 
what a year ofstudy abroad was 
like.

There are stories in here about life at Notre Dame when George Gipp and Knute Rockne were here. There is an essay by a member of 
.t 

the first female class to go through Notre Dame, who relates an inter­
.f!!"":' 
esting story about how the guys at 
...
Notre Dame used to ship in girls for Mardi Gras. 
In "The Season For War," another powerful essay, John Gilliga111 ('42) writes about the effect that World War II had on Notre Dame. With a student's confusion about world issues, Gilligan relates the story of how World War II broke the naivete ofsheltered Notre Dame life. It is eerie how the horror of Hitler provides a sort ofback­ground music for Gilligan's bm.iliar tales ofyouth at Notre Dame. 
I won't say too much more about the book or the stories in it. They arc for you to discover. There is a valiant effort on the part ofmost of the writers here to down play the romantic side of the Notre Dame experience. They usually fail, but that isn't always bad.

Britain unveils one of the yachts that it will send to America's Cup 
AModated Pre1111 
HAMBLE, England -In a plush red­carpet ceremony, Princess Diana yesterday unveiled "Crusader," the first of two British yachts that will challenge for the 1987 America's Cup. Team officials vowed to win the coveted trophy for the first time. 
"I name this yacht Crusader. God bless her, and all who sail in her," said the Princess, drawing back a vel­vet drape to reveal the sleek white hull ofthe 12-meter yacht. 
Crusader, designed by naval ar­chitect Ian Howlett, is the first of two aluminum craft being built at this picturesque marina on the English south coast for the America's Cup challenge. 
The other British boat, which offi­cials say is of a more radical, almost revolutionary design, is still under construction and due to be com­pleted early next year. 
Both yachts will be shippt·,l to Australia in the spring. Trials for the event, being held off Fremantle near Perth, begin in October next year, with the final series of races scheduled forJanuary, 1987. 
Conspicuous by its absence Wed­nesdaywas Cusader's keel, which of­ficials said deliberately was being kept under wraps until the boat is shipped. 
They disclosed, however, that it was similar in design to that of Australia II, which ended 132 years ofAmerican domination by winning the Cup in 1983 off Newport, R.I. 
The New York Yacht Club, which had held the trophy until Australia Il's famous triumph, is backing one of five American challenges to get thr Cnp back next time. 
Alan Bond, head of the syndicate which backed Australia II, was a surprise visitor to the naming ceremony and admitted the British challenge had a "very serious chance." 
But he added, "The British won't win it ifwe can help it." 
Bond has already launched Australia III to try and defend the trophy in 1987. 
The competition dates back to 18'51 when Britain issued the first' challenge to the United States. 

Iowa State holds memorial service for those killed in airplane crash 
AMoclated Pr.ess 
AMES, Iowa-Thousands offriends and fellow students paid tribute yes­terday to six members and coaches of Iowa State University's women's cross-country team and their pilot, killed in a plane crash last week. 
"In the last several days, we have realized how compassionate the Iowa State University family really is," university President W. Robert Parks said during the service. "Expressions of sympathy have come from near and far." 
The Nov. 25 crash killed pilot Bur­ton Watkins; team members Sheryl Maahs ofSpirit Lake, Susan Baxter of Brentwood, England, and Julie Rose ofAshford, England; team coach Ron Renko; assistant coach Pat Moynihan; and student trainer Step­hanie Streit of Hawarden. 
Federal investigators say it will be at least two months before they know what caused the twin-engine plane to slam into a west Des Moines neighborhood as the team returned from an NCAA meet in Milwaukee, where it had placed second. 
Athletic Director Max l 'rick, his voice breaking, said the Iowa State community "gives our love and thanks to Watkins and Renko and the players." 
"They were young women of hope and ambition...," he said. "We'll still see their coach and we'll still see them running -stirring the wind, and that wind (carrying) the signature of their honor." 
The crowd of 6,000 people in­cluded the surviving members ofthe women's cross-country team, who were dressed in their cardinal and gold warm-up suits. They and mem­bers of the ISU men's team were on two other planes that landed minutes before the ill-fated plane arrived in Des Moines. 
Roger J. Carrick of the British Consulate in Chicago read a letter sent by Eric and Valerie" Baxter, parents ofSusan Baxter. 
"The Baxter tamily sends their lov~ to all the bereaved families," tlw letter said. "Sue thoro·aghly enjoyed her time in Iowa. We offer our sincerest condolences in this unconscionable and most tragic loss oflife."

Holtz 
continuedfrompage 16 
Because the career moves that are often made in college coaching have a great effect on the life of the coach's entire family, Holtz claims that any move his father makes is al· ways discussed by the entire family. The decision to go to Notre Dame was no exception. 
"The whole family sits down and talks about any move my father is thinlding about making," said Holtz. "We make some comment-s but we want to do what will make dad the happiest." 
And from the way Holtz sounds about his father's new job, it seems that both Holtz Sr. andJr. couldn't be happier. 
"It's always been a dream for my father to coach at Notre Dame," noted Holtz, "and I'm pumped that he is going to be here. The reason that I came to Notre Dame is that I was sold on the tradition and the excitement when I visited the campus. Now my father will be a part ofNotre Dame." 
Although his father may just be

the most recognized personality at 
the university, Holtz is not trying to 
cash in on his father's fame. Claiming 
that "he is not going out and spray 
painting his name on the back of all 
his shirts," Holtz is just happy that 
his family will be around South Bend 
when he wants to visit them. 
"Everyone would like their 
parents to be around when they 
want to talk about something," he 
said. "Now I won't have to drive 12 
hours to see my mom and dad or 
wait to talk to them during a 
weekend phone call. Their house 
will be a place for me to go and get 
away from school and my grades." 
Holtz, who won't be graduating 
until the fall of 1986, added that he is 
very excited about seeing his fat· · her's first Irish team next year. 
"At Arkansas I only got to see two 
or three games a year and catch the 
other scores on TV," noted Holtz, 
"but next year I will be in the stands 
for every game." 
But winning or losing doesn't 
really seem to be a top priority for 
Holtz. No matter how the Irish and 
his father fair next season, Holtz will 
always think of the man running the 
~how'on tht· ~lklmt·' as "just dad." 

Lendl easily defeats Lloyd 
MELBOURNE, Australia · Top­seeded Ivan Lend! ofCzechoslovakia steamrollered his way through the final two sets to defeat Britain's john Uoyd 7·6, 6-2, 6-1 yesterday in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open tennis tournament. 
The 26-year-old Czech, aiming to win the Australian tide for the first time, struggled through the first set, but then used his power serves to good effect and romped to victory in one hour, 44 minutes. 
The unseeded Uoyd, who had beaten seeds Tomas Smid and Joakim Nystrom on his way to the last eight of the grass court event, found his own serve had deserted him. 
"I had no chance against a player of his caliber if I could only get 50 percent ofmy first serves in," the 31· year-old Englishman said.

squad which posted a 20-8 record 
last season. 
Head Coach Mary DiStanislao 
hopes to take take her squad to the 
NCAA Tournament this year and ex­
pects Heidi Bunek, Usa Kuhns and 
Diondra Toney to make significant 
strides in their first year with the 
Irish. 
"This year's freshmen are very 
talemed Individually," she says. 
"They're going to fill some real 
needs on the team. The only real 
pressure on them is to become bet­
ter players with each passing day." 
The prospect of6-4 forward Heidi 
Bunck improving as the season 
progresses is a scary thought for op­
posing players and a reason for hope 
on the part ofNotre Dame basketball 
supporters. The Milwaukee, Wis. 
native was labelled by many as the 
top prep player In the country last 
season. She averaged 24.8 points and 
1 0 rebounds per game last year and 
earned first-team all-America honors 
in a number ofnational publications. "Heidi is going to be a very good college player," DiStanislao says. "She's tall, talented and has a very ·good shooting touch. Her role on 
the team will develop as she learns 
the college game and discovers how 
to push her limits." 
Learning the college game in­
volves gaining experience through 
Increased floor time. In this respect, 
Bunek is already off to an impressive 
start. She opened her college career 
by scoring I 0 points in an Irish loss 
to Purdue and followed up with a 
21-point game In Monday's 94-65 
triumph over Western Michigan. 
Bunck's height adds rebounding strength to the Notre Dame front line, an aspect of her game which serves to increase her value to the future of the Irish women's hoops squad. 
In the backcoun, explosive Oiondra Toney can be expected to add her quick ball-handling. passing and shootinjl sldlls to the Notre Dame outside game. The speedster 
from Chicago averaged 1 7 points, 
seven rebounds and five assists as a 
high school senior and was named 
second-team Parade All-American. 
Coach DiStanislao expects Toney 
to utilize her speed on both ends of 
the coun during the 1985-86 cam­
paign. 
"She's a very valuable player," she 
says. "She played a jack-of-all-trades 
role in high school and has a wide 
variety ofskills. Didi is a tJoor leader 
with a lot of confidence and great 
passing skills. As she improves her 
defensive skills, her contribution to 
the team will increase." 
Toney certainly has the raw talent 
to help the Irish defensively, as her 
speed on the press is sure to in­
timidate opposing guards. Coach 
DiStanislao looks to find a position in 
the backcoun for Toney and is wil­
ling to move her from point to 
shooting guard in order to increase 
her playing time. 
Sharpshooter Usa Kuhns rounds 
out the freshman trio, bringing her 
18.3 point-per-game high school scoring average to the women's team. Coach DiStanislao looks for­ward to the offensive punch Kuhns will provide as she gains experience on the college level. 
"Usa is a very, very good shooter 
with excellent range from the 
outside," she says. "She has good 
basketball instincts on the court." 
Her shooting touch and a handful 
ofhigh school records earned Kuhns 
national honorable mention status 
from Converse, Street and Smith, 
and USA Today. There are, accord­
ing to Coach DiStanislao, a couple of 
areas she must improve on before 
she reaches her full potential as a 
college basketball player. 
"Usa has to become stronger and 
more intense in her game," she said. 
"The shooting is there but she has to 
work on gaining confidence. I look 
for her to really contribute as thos<: :things come." 
While Coach DiStanislao looks for ways to improve the play of th<: three newcomers, Irish basketball fans can look forward to the added excitement of watching them play during the next four years.

"We've been pointing toward this for the last four years," said DiStanis­lao. "We've got a strong senior class, freshmen who will contribute, andthe kids arc willing to work. Our goal is to be a team good enough to get in the NCAA tournament. 
"Trena (Keys) will have to push herself farther and she will have to push her teammates. She knows bet­ter than anyone how the good teams play and what it takes to be a good 
team." 
All teams, good and bad, know how good Keys plays. The 6-1 Marion, Ind. native led the Irish in scoring ( I 7. 2 points per same) and added 5.6 rebounds per game last season to anchor a dangerous front coun. In addition to the:sc figures, team co-captain Keys dished out a second-best 67 assists, a team­leading 43 blocked shots and 37 steals. Though double-teamed much of the time, Keys almost always hit the clutch shot or found the open man when the Irish most needed it. 
"She has a lot of talent and can score in so many different ways," said DiStanislao. "And now she's a senior with four years under her belt. There wasn't a great burden placed on her last year to be a scorer, but she took it upon herse.lfand did a great job. She'll be up to the task again this year." 
Keys should get plenty ofhelp un­derneath from her tall teammates on the front line. 6-2 sophomore center Sandy Botham is a strong rebounder several talented and versatile 
guards. Poised sophomore Mary 
Gavin will do most of the ball han­
dling. although she will be pressed 
by experienced senior Denise Bas­
ford. Gavin set a Notre Dame record 
for assists last season and should get 
the chance to hit from the outside 
more often with opponents keying 
on the Irish front line. 
"We're in good shape at the point 
for the first time ever," said DiStanis· 
lao. "We have a good perimeter 
shooting team, although that hasn't 
shown itselfyet this season. If we use 
good judgement we will be a good 
shooting team." 
At the wing guard, meanwhile, will be 6-0 senior co-captain Lynn Ebben and sophomore Kathy Bar· ron. Ebben, who also can play for­ward, came on strong at the end of last year to pace the Irish attack from the perimeter. 
Perhaps the most unusual aspect ofthe 1985-86 Irish, though, is that a trio of freshmen who will be called on to play big roles. Forward Heidi Bunek comes with national awards and honors, and should step in im· mediately to the front line. 5-10 Usa Kuhns, meanwhile, will chip in from the wing for the Irish, and quick point guard Diondra Toney will handle the ball off the bench or play the wing. 
"All the freshmen have seen time this year, and they're all going to contribute," noted DiStanislao. "All things considered, this year I think we have the potential to be an even better team than last year. We haven't proved anything yet (the Irish are 1-1 on the season), but we have a challenging schedule with some big games right off the bat."

"We had some adversity," he said, 
"but we also had some great times.'' 
Faust, who was choked up at one 
point in his speech, received astand· 
ing ovation when he finished speak­
ing. 
New York Yankee President 
George Steinbrenner, best known 
for his managerial revolving door in 
New York, served as guest speaker 
for the banquet. 
Pinkett, a 5-9, 181-pound native of Sterling. Va., capped off his Notre Dame career with a senior season that saw him carry the ball 255 times for 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns. : He started all I1 games for the Irish In '85, to finish his career with 35 
consecutive game started. 
Pinkett leaves Notre Dame with 
just about every rushin~: record in 
his name. He is the all-time Irish 
l~der in career rushing attempts 
(899), rushing yards ( 4·,131 ), rus­
hing touchdowns (49), total touch­
downs (53), total points ( 320), 
average rushing yard~ per game 
(96.I in 43 games), IOO-yard games (21 ), and all-purpose yardage (5,259). 
who was a plt:;u;ant surprise for DiS· 
tanislao last season as an immediate 
contributer. Botham's quick moves 
to the hoop allowed her to shoot 53 
percent from the floor for 9.4 ppg. In 
addition, she hauled down 5.1 
rebounds toward the Irish cause. 
Awhole platoon ofplayers will vie for the other forward spot with 5-I1 junior Lavetta Willis and 6-2 sop· homore Kathy Brommcland as the most experienced of the group. Brommcland adds a nice outside shooting touch for a forward ( 4.2 ppg), while Willis comes back from academic ineligibility after an im­pressive rookie year off the bench. Meanwhile, 6-5 sophomore center Beth Morrison, the tallest player in Notre Dame history, will come in to spell Botham on occasion. 
"The thrust of our offense is designed to get the inside people 50 percent ofour shots," said DiStanis­lao. "That's going to take people working to get position to get these shots. We're going to need to find the chemistry and the right people. 
"But we have the potential to have great depth here. We'll need to have Botham make her presence felt. With our size we should be a good rebounding team." 
Rebounding will be especially im­portant this year to give the Irish an effective transition game to go with their powerful inside game. 
"I'm going to miss ( 1985 graduate) Mary Beth Schueth ( 11.3 ppg and 7.7 rebounds per game)," noted DiStanislao. "We'd really like to pick up the tempo and run. If we rebound well we should get more chances for easy buckets." 
Responsible for any fast breaks as well as perimeter shooting. will be 
said have "literally paved the way for 
me." 

When he made his speech as team captain later in the evening, Pinkett urged the younger players to "make all the traditon and mystique in­volved with Notre Dame important to you," and to "take pride in the Notre Dame uniform and the gold helmet. 
"And always remember what hap­pened in Miami," he added. "The beauty of sports is that you always get a second chance. And when you get that chance in two years, do it for me." 
Scannell, a 6-4, 278-pound native of State College, Pa., was one of Pinkett's key blockers over the past four years. A three-year starter on the offensive line, Scannell started 28 of the last 29 games of his Irish career and was a second-team All· American pick on the Football News all-star squad this season. 
Dorsey finished founh overall among Irish tacklers this year with 84 ( 31 solos) and first in tackles for lost yardage (I 5 for 73 yards). A 6-5, 270-pound native of McLean, Va., Dorsey also had three sacks, three fumbles caused and two fumbles recovered, while starting every game in '85. 
Dingens, a 6-5, 257-pounder from 
ship candidtate, Dingens already has been admitted to the University of Michigan Medical School. 
A four-time monogram winner, Dingens is a two-time second-team Academic All-American. He alreay has made the district team for 'RS and is listed on the national ballot being distributed for voting this week to all members of the College of Sports Information Directors of America. 
Athletic Director Gene Corrigan, who served as master ofceremonies, read two telegrams addressed to Steinbrenner. One was from John Cardinal O'Connor, the other from comedien Bob Hope. In his telegram, Hope asked Steinbrenner, "Why are you coming? The coach is already leaving." 
Steinbrenner described how Ath· letic Director Emeritus Edward "Moose" Krause had invited him to the banquet. 
"(Krause) asked me if I believed in free speech," Steinbrennersaid. "I told him, 'Sure I do.' He said, 'That's good, because you're going to give 
one."' 
Steinbrenner praised Faust, saying "while his record as a coach is not one of the best in the country, his record as a man is unparalleled."

Freshman Boyd starts season well; wrestling team travels to Las Vegas 
By EDJORDANICH 
Sports Writer 
Fran McCann and his wrestling team, along with freshman standout Pat Boyd, are headed for the land of sand, Sinatra and slot machines. 
The Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev. will be the site for this weekend's Las Vegas Invitational, and the Irish, along with some 40 ot· her teams, will exhibit their talent against the likes of NCAA powers Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Arizona State. 
One ofthe principal performers in McCann's traveling show is Boyd, the 142-pound freshm;m from Mount Pleasant, Mich. Part of the quintet of first-year wrestlers com­ing into Notre Dame with national acclaim, Boyd has impressed both McCann and Irish opponents im­mediately with third and fourth­place finishes at the Michigan State Invitational and the St. Lolllis Open, respectively.

record of 168-1 included three state championships. A semifinal loss in the 98-pound state tournament his freshman year proved to be Boyd's only loss. First-place finishes and un­defeated seasons at 105, 132 and 138 pounds made him a highly sought-after wrestler during his senior year ofhigh school. 
"I've really always dreamt about coming to Notre Dame," said Boyd. "I wanted to stay close to home and the prospect of working with two great coaches iJ.i a building program was what I really liked. I was recruited by Michigan State, Central Michigan, Michigan and North Carolina, but Notre Dame was what I wanted in a lot ofways." 
Now that he has been at Notre Dame and wrestled against some ex­cellent competition, Boyd is making his mark due to a combination offac­tors. 
"Pat is very intelligent," said Mccalm. "He is mentally mature for a freshman and is always in control. He's matured even more since he's been here. He doesn't get flustered out on the mat and this all-business approach is a definite advantage for Pat. 

"Pat still has to get bigger," he continued. "He wrestles against kids who are filled out more than he is. Once he gets bulkier and adds to his frame, he'll be even better. He's al­ready a strong kid. He did 50 pull­ups and 7 4 bar-dips at our strength testing, and there's no question he is really an excellent athlete." 
For Boyd, the transition to college wrestling has been aided by two ot­her freshmen who wrestle at the weight classes right above and below him (134 and 150). Jerry Durso, who captured first place at 134-pounds at the St. Louis Open, and Greg Goad, who returns to the team after sitting out a month with an injury, are Boyd's workout partners and two more newcomers in McCann's five-star recruiting class. 
"Jerry, Greg and (assistant coach) Jolin Azevedo have helped me a lot," said Boyd. "The intensity of college wrestling is really different from high school and I have to be men­tally prepared each time I go on the mat. By working with these guys, we all learn and improve." 
Boyd emphasized that he and the other freshmen are wrestling with confidence due to the leadership of McCann, Azevedo and the up­perclassmen. 
"The coaches are excellent," he said. "Our goals are to qualify for na­tionals and by gaining experience against such good wrestlers we hope to peak at the right time. We had a super preseason of running and lif­ting and our mat time came later. We won't burn out. Coach McCann knows what it takes to win a match. The basics are going to win matches for us. 
"The sophomores, juniors and seniors .are super teachers and teamates," continued Boyd. "We are a really close team. John Krug (Irish captain) is a real leader. He represents the university well and has been a real inspiration to me and all the freshmen. The experience the older wrestlers have is helping us a great deal." 
The son of his high school wres­tling coach, Boyd's good technique and balance of strength and quick­ness has helped him establish him­self immediately as a winner. His ability and confidence are two ofthe three for The competition in Las Vegas will be trademarks evident in McCann's wrestlers. The other trademarkis winning. 
The competition in Las Vegas will be another building block for McCann's young team, as it gains momentum in its efforts for national honors.

Track participants show concern 
over loss of athletic sponsorship 
HOUSTON -Coaches and athletes expressed extreme concern yester­day over the loss ofsupport by shoe companies for track and field ath­letes and club teams. 
".A lot ofcompanies have dropped athletes who have depended on income from them," said Russ Rogers, coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University and coach of the men's team that won the championship in the 1985 World Cup meet. 
"A lot of the middle-of-the-road athletes can't depend on the money they win in European meets, be­cause it's usually the super athletes who win the money," he added. "For the athletes trying to work their way up, it's difficult for them to make money. 
"The clubs also are cutting back or not operating anymore because they don't have the resources, ell­her. It worries me." 
The coaches and athletes are gat­hered in Houston for the seventh annual convention of The Athletics Congress, the Indianapolis-based na­tional governing body for track and field. 
Fred Thompson, coach of the Atoms Track Club of Brooklyn, N.Y., and an assistant coach of the U.S. women's team for the 1988 Olympic Games, lamented there weren't many clubs left. "I have a club team, but I feel like a dinosaur. The small clubs are having big problems. 
''I'm not saying that anyone owes anyone a living," continued Thompson. "But when the shoe company concept came out years ago, it was beautiful. The companies supported the athletes through last year." 
Last year, ofcourse, was an Olym­pic year, and after the Los Angeles Games, in which the United States track and field teams performed ex­ceptionally well -in part because of the Soviet-led boycott -shoe com­
panies  began  dropping athletes.  
Some  did  it  slowly,  others  in  
bunches.  

"That support dried up," said Stephanie Hightower, the American record holder in the women's 100­meter high hurdles. "Nobody is giving anyone anything anymore." 
Hightower had been a member of the Bud Ught Track Club; the group now has completely collapsed. 
The club's roster had included numerous world-class athletes, such as Calvin Smith, the world record holder in the 100-meter dash, and Larry Myricks, the 1979 World Cup long jump gold medalist. 
"The shoe companies have done a great job of taking care of the ath­letes, and I hope they continue," said Mel Rosen, coach at Auburn Univer­sity and coach of the men's team for the 1987 World Championships. 
"With the shoe companies back­ing offand the clubs breaking up, we may be going back to the old days where the athletes will stop compet­ing when they finish college," added Rosen. "And that worries me." 
The coaches and athletes agreed that some of the shoe companies are interested in the athletes only during Olympic years. 
"Every four years, the nation turns on the tube and wants to feel proud," said Thompson. "Every four years, the people like to hear the Star Spangled Banner and see the ath­letes on the (medal) platforms. 

"If they want that, they have to support the athletes. They have to make a commitment." 
"I think it's a must that an athlete be a full-time athlete to be world­class," said Rogers. "It's too hard to work and compete. The competi­tion is too keen. You have to com­pete full time to be consistent. 
Rogers said that some companies "got hurt" in 198~ when they had to pay bonuses "they didn't expect" to athletes who performed above ex­pectation during the Olympics. The bonuses had been agreed upon before the Socialist Bloc nations an­nounced their boycott. 
As a solution, Rogers suggested that shoe companies "take a group of about 10 to 1 5 athletes and put them on their payrolls for about three or four years." 
"Tell them," said Rogers," 'I want you to try and win a medal.' Show them you have faith in them. Then, the athletes wouldn't be switching shoe companies during Olympic years.''
