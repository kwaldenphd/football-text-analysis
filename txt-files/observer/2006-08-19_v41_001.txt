Notre Dame welcomes most diverse incoming class 
Incoming students boast high test scores, strong credentials 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
The University has high expectations for the class of 2010, and given their stellar credentials, the roughly 2,025 students in this year's fresh­man class should have no trouble rising to the challenge. 
The Class of 2010 is the most diverse in Notre Dame's history, with minority groups making up 24 percent of the incoming freshman class, said Dan Saracino, assistant provost for enrollment. In prior years, the percentage of minority students has hovered around 22 percent. 
All 50 US states are repre­sented in the freshman class, which also boasts students 
from 41 nations. 
Freshmen come from as far north as North Pole, Alaska and as far south as La Paz, Bolivia, Saracino said. 
"It's a great mix or kids," he said. 
Eighty-six percent were in the top 10 percent of their class. Seventy-three percent earned varsity letters in high school. 
And they were selected from

ROTC students suit up for orientation 
Freshmen Army, Air Force, Navy participants arrive for training 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
While many members of the Class of 2010 have been marching to the Bookstore to purchase "The Shirt," freshmen in Notre Dame's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) pro­gram have been wearing uniforms of a different kind. 
Notre Dame's Air Force, Army and Navy ROTC New Student Orientation drew approximately 70 students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Bethel College, Indiana University South Bend and Valparaiso University to campus last week. 
"New Student Orientation is a whirl­wind introduction into military bearing, customs and courtesies, uniform wear and physical training, so .each day incorporates a bit of each," senior cadet Eileen Shannon said. "Not only does ori­entation explain what ROTC is all about, it also shows the new cadets what they will be capable of in a few short years."

If every day were Freshman Orientation weekend at Notre Dame, dorm T-shirts would be the official uniform, icebreak­ers and egg tosses would replace classes and the beats of Chamillionaire would pulse nightly from the walls of the Joyce Center. 
The three activity-filled days do end, though, and on Tuesday, college begins. And often, the transition from high school to college presents chal­lenges to first year students. 
For freshman Adam Twardzik, his pool of class­mates will grow from 31, the size of his high school class, to his approximately 2,025 Notre Dame classmates. Twardzik said the new situation would

Hop over that fence 
Just before my parents dropped me at Stanford Hall three years ago today, my mom told me something. 
"l'vlike, you have the world by the tail on a downhill swing," she said. "Take advantage ofit." 
Your mom >'~ill probably give you the same type of advice todav. 
Now that "rm a senior and entering my fourth year at the only plaee T ever wanted to go, 


I can tell you that Mike Gilloon 
she's probably 
right. 
So listen up. Editor in Chief 
As a freshman, I was so happy to be 
here that I forgot why I eame. 
After three years of living a dream, I've realized Notre Dame is-in one sense -no different than an:ywhere else. 
Natural Lite and quarter dogs still make you fat. · 
Thme minutes studying calculus and three hours playing NC'.AA 2007 still leads to bad grades. 
Dancing to Journey at an SYH is still not cool. But-drunken fist pumping aside ­this plao~ is pretty special. You will have aeeess to the widest alumni network in the world. You will take classes from proli~ssors who arP tops in their fjeJd. You ""ill live on the most beautiful campus in the eountry. 
You might even see a national title. 
The triek is to take advantage of your opportunity. Maybe you remember Mrs. Smalls in "The Sandlot." 
Most of you were about six years old when that movie debuted, but she's the mom who tells her nerdy son Scott ­the new kid on the bloek -to get out of the house and into some trouble. 
So he did. 
He put down the Erector Set in his bedroom and headed to the baseball diamond. 
It took some help from Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez, but in one summer Smalls made a bunch of friends, learned how to cook Smores and even had James Earl Jones hand him a base­ball signed by the 1927 Yankees. 
None of that would have happened if he stayed in his room. 
It might be easy to stay in your room onee Frosh-0 ends and school begins. You won't know anyone outside of your section and the jump from senioritis to the First Year of Studies c:an be rough. 
You aren't going to immediately feel at ease arow1d here, even if it's the onlv school vou ever wanted to attend. · 
But once you go out of your way and shake off your shyness, you'll never want to leave. Sign up for Interha.ll sports or attend a dorm Ma.:;s. 
Visit with a teacher after dass and get to know everyone in your hall. You're new, you're smart and you're scared. You're Eagle Seouts, elass presidents and football team captains. You scored higher on entrance tests than almost every kid in the eountry. You're at a sehool that most only see on NBC. 
There's a bit of Scott Smalls in all of you. And the only way to make the best of the biggest opportunity you'll ever have is to take a risk and leave your room. 
It's easy to feel content just being at Notre Dame. That's why it's important that you don't.

Pinnacle Athletic Club on Edison Road has received calls from students inquiring about membership sign-ups, said gen­eral manager Jim Bradford. 
Bradford is grateful for the students because this time of year tends to be flat for health clubs.

Undergraduates are not the only intended consumers of local businesses.

"We've been doing a few car­loads the last few days," Erin said. 
Craig Summerix, a first-year store manager of Furniture Now, said he is not sure what to expect as far as the number of patrons goes, but that he is sure his sales will have a "big bump." 
Summerix expects to see off­campus students and incoming freshmen come into the store in the coming week. 
Local restaurants also took steps to attract students to their establishments, as they are often good customers through­out the year, said John Cataldo, general manager of Bruno's Pizza. 
The popular restaurant is hav­ing a student appreciation night next week and is offering addi­tional coupons on its Web site, Cataldo said.

With more than 8,000 Notre Dame students slated to arrive in South Bend by Sunday, local businesses are prepping for their arrival -and a likely boost in sales.

Assistant Store Manager Steve Rutz said that he wants students to take advantage of the company's "pack and hold scan items" sys­tem. The service allows students to find and pay for items at any Bed Bath & Beyond in the coun­try and then pick them up at the Grape Road location.

Transfer student enrollment grows for ~06-~07 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's maintain standards but admit greater number oftransfers, face on-campus housing shortages

As freshmen try to adjust to college life, 173 additional stu­dents on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses face the same challenge -just at different schools than last year.

"The admit and confirm numbers are higher than last year. We typically enroll about 125-130 students," Joyce said. 
One hundred nine of the transfer students are of sopho­more status and 31 are junior status, she said. 
Saint Mary's also experi­enced an increase in transfer numbers, Vice President of Enrollment Management Dan Meyer said. 
"Ninety-eight students applied for transfer admission this fall versus 90 in 2005 and 84 in 2004," he said. 
The College accepted 50 of the applicants and 33 have enrolled, he said. 
Fifty percent of the enrolled students will transfer into the freshman class, 35 percent into the sophomore class and 15 percent into the junior class, Meyer said. 
Meyer and Joyce both said that standards for accepting transfer students have remained the same throughout recent years. Basic require­ments for transfer considera­tion at either institution include a minimum 3.0 GPA in previous college coursework. 
The increase in the number of transfers combined with a larger freshman class has cre­ated issues with the availabili­ty of on-campus housing at both schools. 
"Housing was tight this year, so we did encourage local students to live at home the first semester," Meyer said. "Normally this is not a major issue, but the size of the first-year class pushed things to the limit this year."

Hurricane Katrina ravages Gulf Coast. Jenkins inaugurated as University President. Trustees travel to Rome. 


By AMANDA MICHAELS and KELLY 
MEEHAN 
News Writers 
Hurricane Katrina slams into coast 
On Aug. 29, 2005, the most devastat­ing storm in recent memory ravaged the Gulf Coast and torn through tho lnv­ees protecting the city of New Orleans, killing thousands, leaving millions homeless and inflicting damages some total in the hundreds of billions of dol­lars. 
Its name was llurricane Katrina. 
As the country turned ·its attention and its aid to the areas al'f'eeted by Katrina, the membors of the extended Notre Dame and Saint Mary's family rushed to help not only its own, but all those stranded by the storm. 
The student governments and other student organizations from both schools made strides to help those hurt by Katrina, ineluding a large-seale University-sponsored stadium relief col­lection held during the Michigan State home football game Sept. 17. The pre­liminary total raised from that effort was over $240,000, with money still pouring in from smaller collections. 
A large portion of the funds went to Catholic Charities USA, the Congregation of Holy Cross in Louisiana and members of' the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) in the devas­tated areas. 
Twenty-five ACE instructors were in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, with several more Saint Mary's and Notre Dame graduates working in a similar area with organizations like Teach for America. 
They stayed on even after many of their schools were closed to help rebuild, and to instruct refugees. 
At Notre Dame, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart held nine consecutive days of prayer, while the Center for Social Concerns organized Hurricane Katrina Response Day and an Academic Forum for Disaster Relief to both aid relief efforts and educate the communi­ty about the issue. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's alumni from around the country pooled their resources to aid in disaster relief, while many University and College students spent their winter and spring breaks in New Orleans and other affected areas helping with the rebuilding effort. 
Both institutions also went beyond donating money and supplies, as Saint Mary's took in several students whose colleges were closed by the storm. Notre Dame officials -including University President Father John Jenkins -went to New Orleans to view firsthand the destruction of Hurricane Katrina and meet with Archbishop Alfred Hughes and other community leaders. 


Jenkins is inaugurated 
On Sept. 23, 2005, University President Father John Jenkins was inaugurated as tho 17th president of Notro Dame. 
In his inaugural address at the Joyce Center, Jenkins spoke about the quest for knowledgn, tho unity bntweon faith and mason and the role of community and call to service. 
"With rospeet and gratitudn for all who mnbraced Notre Dame's mission in earlinr times, lot us rise up and ombrace tho mission for our time," Jenkins said in his inaugural addrnss. "This is our goal. Lot no one ever again say that we dreamod too small." 
Jnnkins said his goal was for Notre Dame to be the top Catholic university in the 21st century for research and learning. 
University President Emeriti Father Theodore llnsburgh and Father Edward Malloy blessed the incoming president after his address, and distin­guishnd guests inducted Indiana gover­nor Mitch Daniels, Provost Thomas Burish, Alumni Association President Timothy Brady, Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy, Faculty Senate chair Seth Brown and lloly Cross Provincial Superior David Tyson. 
A picnic and fireworks followed Jenkins' address on South Quad. 
Classes were cancelled for two days allowing students to partake in the inauguration events, including an aca­demic forum featuring Tom Brokaw as the moderator on Thursday afternoon and a Friday morning Mass. 
City passes housing ordinance amendment 
A city ordinance amendment passed over the summer of 2005 not only threatened the South Bond social scene, but also cost several students their apartments. 
Campus-wide opposition swirled as students questioned the passage of the Public Nuisance Ordinance that allowed the city of South Bend to send a notice to abate to both the tenants and the landlord after the first incidence of a noise violation. If neither the tenant nor residents respond and illegal activities continue, the tenant can be fined any­where from $250 to $2,500. If the land­lord, however, opts to evict the tenants within 30 days of notification, the civil lawsuit will be dropped. 
This threat led Turtle Creek Management to evict six students ­who were notified of their eviction upon returning from fall break -for a party thrown on the weekend of Sept. 9-10, where 100 minors were cited for underage drinking. 
In response to the evictions, then-stu­dent body president Dave Baron con­fronted the ordinance implications along with the Student Senate Community Helations committee by presenting a resolution to the South 
2005. 

Bend Community Council meeting Feb. 27. 
Council members said they would consider the propositions of amending the ordinance by sending a notice to abate after the second violation or allow landlords to pass their fines on to tenants to reduce the tendency to evict after only one violation. 
Council members said they were impressed with Baron's desire to coop­erato with them on meeting mutual goals and making community relations a priority at Notre Dame. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell and student body vice president Bill Andrichik have also verbally committed their administration to improving com­munity relations. 
SMC replaces two top administrators 
In January 2006, Saint Mary's College found itself having to replace two top administrators as Vice President of Student Affairs Linda Timm and Vice President and Dean of Faculty Pat White each individually announced they would vacate their position at the con­clusion of the semester. 
After serving as vice president of Student Affairs at the College for 11 years, Timm announced she would be leaving at the end of the academic year to begin her presidency at Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, Wise. 
"This is the next move in my life," Timm said in an interview Jan. 17. "In lots of ways, this will be a new begin­ning for me -a new beginning profes­sionally and a new beginning personal­ly." 
Like Timm, White will also leave his post as a Saint Mary's vice president to head another academic institution ­Wabash College. 
White -who had served Saint Mary's for 17 years -will begin his presidency at the nationally ranked men's college July 1. 
College President Carol Ann Mooney has named business and economics professor Jill Vihtelic as the interim vice president and dean of faculty until a permanent replacement is found -a position Mooney said VIhtelic might fill for the next two academic semesters. 
Mooney said she hopes to f:tll the vice president of Student Affairs position by the start of the 2006-07 school year, but has yet to release the names of any potential candidates. 
Jenkins speaks on academic freedom 
On Jan. 23 and 24, University President Father John Jenkins spoke to faculty members and students about the interaction of academic freedom and Catholic character at Notre Dame. 
The address -almost the same for both groups -outlined Jenkins' con­cerns about the inconsistency of the University's sponsorship of certain events in light of Catholic teaching. Jenkins asked for continued dialogue

events in light of Catholic teaching. Jenkins asked for continued dialogue on the issue before a formal policy announcement. 
Jenkins said events sponsored by the University or one of its units -including academic departments -that are deemed to conflict or appear to conflict with Catholic values "should not be allowed at Notre Dame." 
Under specific scrutiny was the contro­versial and sexually explicit play "The Vagina Monologues," which had been performed on campus for five consecu­tive years as part of the anti-violence against women V-Day campaign. Though Jenkins praised the play for its goals, he criticized the "graphic" ways it attempt­ed to achieve them. 
"The Vagina Monologues" was held in an academic setting this year -per­formed in a classroom and followed up with a series of panels addressing the issue of sexuality -as part of an effort to address concerns like Jenkins'. 
The wave of response to Jenkins' speech -which he said was intended to open dialogue on the subject, and not be a fmal decision on anything -was mas­sive, flooding dorms, classrooms, publi­cations and student and faculty govern­ments. 
An e-mail account was opened for the opinionated to express their concerns to Jenkins, who promised to read every last letter. 
The most outspoken were the oppo­nents of Jenkins' statements, who fought any serious restrictions placed on what could and could not take place at Notre Dame. The student organization United for Free Speech was created primarily as a means to defend academic freedom on campus. Many, though, supported Jenkins, including South Bend-Fort Wayne Bishop John D'Arcy. 
For more than two months, the cam­pus was embroiled in an often-circular debate, awaiting Jenkins' fmal decision. 
'Monologues' not prohibited 
Ten weeks after his opening address on academic freedom and Catholic char­acter, University President Father John Jenkins released a statement on April 5 detailing his decision after listening to arguments from both sides of the debate. 
Jenkins emphasized the importance of balancing Notre Dame's Catholic values and its presence as an internationally recognized academic institution. 
"The Vagina Monologues" -the con­troversial play at the heart of the discus­sion-would not be prohibited on cam­pus, Jenkins said, but like any other per­formance, would undergo approval every year. He also praised the play's new academic setting as appropriate and suggested it could serve as a model for other such performances. 
To further advance the goal of elimi­nating violence against women, Jenkins said he supports both the future produc­tion of a play written by student organiz­ers of the "Monologues" entitled "Loyal Daughters" and the formation of an ad hoc University committee to address gender relations and sexual violence composed of administrators, faculty and students, with Jenkins as chair. 
Jenkins also said academic depart­ments are "best situated to decide what events should or should not be spon­sored" and have the responsibility to make clear that their sponsorship of an event does not imply endorsement -a large point of contention during the aca­demic freedom debate. Jenkins' decision gave department chairs and College deans a large amount of responsibility in handling contentious issues, while set­ting up a process for dealing with any problems that go beyond the bounds of the department. 
Many faculty members and students expressed their satisfaction with Jenkins' conclusion, though the most enthusiasm came from approval of the University president's open dialogue throughout the decision-making process. 
Several loud dissenters disapproved of the decision, however, including law pro­fessor emeritus Charles Rice -who called for Jenkins' resignation -several faculty members and Holy Cross priests and South Bend-Fort Wayne Bishop John D'Arcy. Jenkins acknowledged the opposition, saying the University benefits from a strong, two-sided debate. 
Trustees convene in Rome 

For the first time, Notre Dame's Board of Trustees convened in Rome for its annual winter meetings on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, meeting with key Vatican lead­ers. participating in an academic confer­ence and conferring two honorary degrees in the process. 
The trip was touted both as an oppor­tunity to renew ties with the Vatican and as an avenue to improve understanding of how the University can better serve the Church. 
A meeting in Rome had been on the Board of Trustee's agenda for several years. and University President Father John Jenkins' first year in office was deemed an appropriate time by mem­bers. 
Trustees met with numerous Vatican officials, including representatives of the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Secretariat of State. 
Jenkins and other members of the Notre Dame delegation were also per­sonally greeted by Pope Benedict XVI after his public audience Feb. 1. 
The conference the group attended, "Contribution of Catholic Universities to the Church and Culture," featured addresses by Jenkins, Rino Fisichella, auxiliary bishop of Home and rector of St. John (Pontifical) Lateran University and Notre Dame Trustee Daniel Jenky, bishop of Peoria, Ill. 
Honorary degrees were presented to Fisichella and L. Frances Rooney III, U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. 
The event marked Jenkins' first major trip as University president and a new era in Notre Dame-Vatican relations. 
Campus Labor Action Project mobi­lizes 
This year, a new social action group made itself known at Notre Dame -the Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP). Formed by students in the fall of 2005, CLAP welcomed workers, students, fac­ulty~ alumni and others to join their effort to secure a "living wage" for cam­pus workers. 
The living wage -a movement insti­tuted into policy at institutions nation­wide, including Harvard University and Georgetown University -is the hourly rate of income that a worker in a specif­ic area must make in a 40-hour work­week to support a family of four. To establish a living wage at Notre Dame, CLAP suggested a minimum $12.10 per hour wage, or $25,164 a year, for University employees. 
On March 8, members of CLAP passed out copies of their 11-page report on the living wage and its potential implemen­tation at Notre Dame to several University officials, including University President Father John Jenkins, Provost Tom Burish, Executive Vice President John Affieck-Graves and Vice President of Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman. 
In the report, CLAP outlined three goals, which included meeting with Jenkins, Jenkins making a public com­mitment to the principle of living wage and creating a joint task force of stu­dents, workers, faculty and administra­tors to address worker issues and come up with a just policy. 
CLAP supported its cause with several petitions and was backed by Notre Dame's student government, arguing its efforts were part of Catholic social teaching. Affieck-Graves issued a state­ment April 19 responding to CLAP's report. maintaining the University already provides a "fair and just wage" for its employees by including benefits on top of their base salary. 
CLAP responded with a rally and final­ly a sit-in in Jenkins' office on May 2, still demanding the joint task force out­lined in its earlier report. Jenkins issued a statement that day saying he entrusted the matter to Affleck-Graves, and the University was committed to paying just wages and benefits to its workers. 
As the semester ended, members of CLAP were left unsatisfied.

Fifty-eight per­cent of admitted students decided to enroll, the highest yield the University has ever experienced. 
Saracino said more students are choosing Notre Dame because the University is com­mitted to meeting the financial needs of admitted students.

That says to every single student, 'If we admit you we will make it possible for you to come,' and that makes the students who want to come actually enroll," Saracino said.

Transition 
continued from page 1 .. 
"take some getting used to." 
The sense of being a little fish swimming in a big pond is com­mon among incoming fresh­men, said Susan Steibe­Pasalich, director of the University Counseling Center. Students tend to compare their freshman year in college with their senior year in high school, which is useless, she said. 
"Again and again you're going to be a freshman, whether it's in a new relation­ship, or at a new job ... you're going to be on the bottom rung," she said. "Transition is just something that takes time." 
Academics are the main con­cern for freshman Michael Carilli, who said his high school was "not exactly big on aca­demics." 
''I'm really worried I'm going to flunk out the first semester," he said when asked about the upcoming transition. 
First Year of Studies Assistant 
Dean Kenneth DeBoer had more hope. 
"All Notre Dame kids are smart, but some relied on rote learning and memorization in high school," he said. "The courses in college are more challenging and require a dif­ferent set of skills ... In time, the students find they have these skills." 
FYS advisors like DeBoer pro­vide an outlet for freshmen con­cerns and point them in the right direction. The advisors meet with students during the first week on a walk-in basis and in September for introduc­tory meetings. Upperclassmen peer advisors also meet with freshmen during September and October. 
"In our sessions, we try to make the students feel comfort­able," DeBoer said. "We find out what they want to do and we help them do it." 
Both Twardzik and Carilli were concerned about separat­ing from their families, espe­cially the latter who is leaving four siblings behind.

Students often cite weather differences as a transition issue. However, Carilli, a New Mexico resident, had already purchased a winter jacket to prepare for Midwestern win­ters. 
"Apparently the area around Notre Dame is fit for human habitation," he said. "So, I think it's going to be okay." 
Ultimately, most students adjust to the college lifestyle, DeBoer said. 
"By April, they are more con­fident as students," he said. "They have picked up the tools they need to be successful."

ROTC 
continued from page 1 
Shannon and her staff led 23 Air Force ROTC freshmen in the New Student Orientation -a 40 percent increase iJ:, participation from last year, she said. 
Michele Laning, a freshman from Valparaiso {Tniversity, said the prospect of job experience in college and the appeal of tuition assistance drew her to join Notre Dame's Air Force ROTC program. She said although the 6 a.m. wake up time was the earliest she 
has gotten up all s  nmer, she has  
had a very positi  e experience  
this week.  

For Saint Mary':. freshman Air Force ROTC cadet Elizabeth Mitchell, ROTC is a family tradi­tion. 
"My dad participated in Navy ROTC when he was a student at Notre Dame," Mitchell said. "It's been great meeting all of the other cadets in my class and the upperclassmen this week. 
"We've done so many different things -from learning how to march, salute, the Air Force song, and wear our uniforms, to taking the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test and participating in social activities. It's been challenging, but fun." 
New Navy ROTC midshipmen began their orientation Aug. 13 and marked the end with a fun run on campus Friday morning, said Lieutenant Greg Keigher, coordinator of the New Student Orientation. 
"Orientation week provides a crash course on military eti­quette, uniforms, policies and how to function as a military unit," Keigher said. 'The NROTC staff really emphasizes team­work, camaraderie and Navy tra­dition." 
Keigher said the goal during New Student Orientation is to prepare the new midshipmen to function as "knowledgeable members of the NROTC battal­ion." 
"Upon graduation, all of these midshipmen will become military oflicers, and many will be leading sailors and marines into battle ;J.gainst thf\ 'Nar on terror," Keigher said. 
Similar to the Air Force ROTC New Student Orientation, an early wake up call is a hallmark of the Navy's New Student Orientation. 
"A day during 0 week is pretty 
. long," Keigher said. "It starts around 6:15a.m. and doesn't end until10 p.m." The sun hadn't even peeked over Saint Mary's Lake Thursday morning when the new Navy ROTC midshipmen gathered on Carroll Field in their blue and white gym uniforms just before 
6:30 a.m. Shouting words of encouragement to each other, the new midshipmen took a mock Physical Readiness Test that included a sit-and-reach, timed sit-up and push-up tests and a timed one-and-a-half mile run. They will take the oflicial PRT in October, battalion commanding oflicer Erin Smith said. 
"0 week sets the tone for disci­pline :wrl professionalism and instills an understanding of the military chain of command for the rest of the year," Smith said. "The Navy requires attention to detail and the concept of working as a team, so we try to instill this as much as possible throughout the week." 
Smith recalled the feeling of accomplishment that came with her own completion of the New Student Orientation when she was a freshman. 
"The entire week is very chal­lenging and you spend some time questioning why you're putting yourself through it, but in the end you realize that there is a pur­pose behind everything and that you have just pushed yourself to new levels and made it through," Smith said. 
Four sophomores and four jun­iors joined 15 new freshmen in the New Student Orientation, cadet battalion Commander Eileen Kamykowski said. 
"'In a typical day, the new stu­dents woke up at 5:15 a.m. for Physical Training and spent the remainder of the day getting acquainted with everything from weapons, ranger tactics and urban warfare to repelling and putting on camouflage paint," Kamykowski said. 
Senior cadet Matthew Donnelly remembered what the orientation was like for him his freshman year. 
"It was a really good experi­ence for those of us who had little or no experience with the mili­tary," Donnelly said.

Incoming freshmen participate in academic code tutorial 
Special to the Observer Is it cheating to find home­work answers online, or in the back of a textbook, and make corrections before handing in the assignment? What if a student turns in a science experiment or a term paper that he or she did for another class? Is it cheating to recycle old work? When is it okay to use infor­mation from the Internet? Or from your roommate, for that matter? Incoming undergraduates have been pondering such ques­tions this summer as part of an electronic tutorial that exposes them to Notre Dame's recently revised Academic Code of Honor. Students must success­fully complete the multiple­choice tutorial before they can sign the University's honor code pledge, a precursor to enrolling. 
"We needed to do something more to make students familiar with the honor code," said Thomas Flint, a philosophy pro­fessor and Faculty Honor Code officer. Along with associate provost Dennis Jacobs, he directed the creation of the tutorial with assistance from several faculty and student members of last year's University Code of Honor Committee. The tutorial's tran­sition to an online exercise was the work of Chris Clark of the Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning. 
The new Web-based program takes first year, transfer and returning students through a series of case studies in four areas where honesty issues fre­quently arise: acceptable collab­oration with other students, fal­sifying data, test taking, and plagiarism. Throughout the summer, incoming students quickly took to the challenge, with 85 percent succeeding on their first attempt. 
The case studies are fictional but reflect classic honesty dilemmas, if not a flair for plot and character development. They feature such instructors as Professor Chirac, a French teacher; the "legendary" anthropology teacher Michigan Smith; a forestry instructor named Pine; and an ROTC instructor (teaching Aerial Warfare) named Professor Weis. (A key requirement of the honor code is that students reveal when they have worked with others. Thus. Flint credits com­mittee colleagues with some of the punchier content. Dottie Pratt conceived Michigan Smith and Sam Gaglio's subcommittee invented the forester Professor Pine.) 
Sometimes the fictional stu­dents in the case studies face a situation that is complexly nuanced. Often, however, they just didn't leave enough time to complete their work. 
Time, says Flint, is a big fac­tor in honesty cases. 
"Students have made it clear that decisions to cheat are often made when they feel they don't have enough time to do their own work honestly," he said. "Sometimes the students proba­bly are just too busy to get everything done. Often, of course, they've simply put things off, are starting to write a paper the night before it's due, and succumb to the temptation to cut-and-paste from the Internet." 
Good moral judgment alone is probably not enough to help a student succeed on the tutorial; they need to have read the code. 
That's deliberate, Flint said. 
"We do want our new stu­dents to be thinking about the importance of academic integri­ty in general, but we also want them to be familiar with how those general principles are applied here at Notre Dame," he said. 
Two incoming freshmen who succeeded on their first try and who carefully read the student guide to the honor code before completing the exercise say it opened their eyes to the honesty issue. 
"It really made me think about the different areas of cheating and how things that we don't normally consider to be cheating really are," said Laura Verwilst of South Bend. "I used to think of cheating as simply looking off someone else's test or having a cheat sheet."

Notre Dame ranked highly in new surveys 
Special to The Observer 
Two new surveys have rated Notre Dame among the leading universities in the nation. 
The 2007 "How to Get into College Guide" published by Kaplan/Newsweek cites Notre Dame among the 25 "new Ivies" in higher education, and Washington Monthly magazine ranked Notre Dame 13th in its survey of national universities. 
The Kaplan/Newsweek list of "new Ivies" recognizes universi­ties whose "first-rate academic programs, combined with a population boom in top stu­dents, have fueled their rise in stature and favor among the nation's top students, adminis­trators and faculty -edging them to a competitive status rivaling the Ivy League." The selections were based on admissions statistics and inter­views with administrators, stu­dents, faculty and alumni. 
Among the other "new Ivies" are Emory, New York, Rice, Vanderbilt and Washington Universities, UCLA and the Universities of Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia. 
The Kaplan/Newsweek "How to Get into College Guide," which is available on news stands Aug. 21, also contains articles on the admissions process, financial aid, and stan­dardized tests. The rankings are available online at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id!l 4325172/. 
The second annual Washington Monthly College Rankings rate universities on three primary criteria: perform­ance as engines of social mobil­ity ("ideally helping the poor get rich rather than the very rich to get very, very rich"), scientific and humanistic research, and an ethic of service to country. Among the specific areas of evaluation are total research spending, the number of doc­toral degrees granted in science and engineering, the number of students in ROTC and the Peace Corps, and the percentage of and support for Pel! Grant recipients. 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ranked No. 1, fol­lowed by the University of California, Berkeley; Penn State University; UCLA; Texas A&M; University of California, San Diego; Stanford University; Cornell University; South Carolina State University; and the University of California, Davis. 


Hesburgh documentary to air 
Program features interviews with Condoleezza Rice, Ara Parseghian 
Special to The Observer 
University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh is the subject of a new documentary television program to be aired Wednesday at 8 p.m. on WNIT. 
The program, "God, Country, Notre Dame: The Story of Father Ted Hesburgh, C.S.C.," concerns Hesburgh's priestly ministry, his career in higher educa­tion, and his role as a public servant. It includes inter­views with several of Hesburgh's colleagues and friends, including all of the living former U.S. presidents; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Notre Dame alumna and former University trustee; former Notre Dame football coach Ara Parseghian; and Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, former archbish­op of Washington, D.C. It is narrated by Notre Dame alumnus and television celebrity Regis Philbin and actors Sean Astin (who played the title role in the film "Rudy") and Clarence Gilyard. 
Hesburgh, now 89 years old, stepped down as Notre Dame's leader on June 1, 1987, ending the longest tenure at that time among active presidents of American colleges and uni­versities. Since his retire­ment he has remained active, working in his office on the 13th floor of the cam­pus library that is renamed in his honor. His 1990 auto­biography, "God, Country, Notre Dame," became a national best seller, and in 2000 his long public service career, which featured 16 presidential appointments, was recognized when he became the first person from higher education to be awarded the Congressional

Gold Medal. 
Father Hesburgh's consid­erable impact on Notre Dame is suggested by a statistical comparison of the University in 1952, when he became president, and in 1987, when he retired. Tho annual operating budget went from $9.7 million to $176.6 mil­lion, the endowment from $9 million to $350 million, and research funding from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment increased from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty from 389 to 950, and the number of degrees annually awarded from 1,212 to 2,500. Also during the Hesburgh era the governance of the University was transferred from the founding religious communi­ty, the Congregation of Holy Cross, to a two-tiered, mixed board of lay and religious trustees and fellows in 1967, and women began to be admitted to the undergradu­ate program in 1972.

Holy Cross nun Gude retiring after 25 years 
Special to The Observer 
Professor Frank O'Malley, one of the most affectionately cele­brated "bachelor dons" of Notre Dame history, famously said of the University's older buildings that "there's blood in the bricks." He was speaking of the years of work, worry and loving witness that have made the place what it is. He was speaking, perhaps unwittingly, of himself. lie could as easily have been speaking of Sister Mary Louis Gude, C.S.C. 
''I'm one of the last Holy Cross sisters at Notre Dame," said Gude, who is addressed and referred to by all who know her simply as "ML." She is retiring after a quarter of a century of multifaceted professional serv­ice to the University, in its resi­dence halls, its classrooms, its administrative offices, and any of several places on and off­campus to which her vocation has drawn her. 

"Retiring," in this instance, is merely a technical designation of professional status. People like Gude are incapable of inac­tivity. 
A member of the faculty of Notre Dame's Romance lan­guages and literatures depart­ment, Gude has an enviable reputation as a scholar of 17th century French fiction and 20th century French intellectual his­tory. Her publications include two books, "Le Page Disgracie: The Text as Confession" and "Louis Massignon: The Crucible of Compassion." 
In 1983, while chairing the modern languages department at Saint Mary's College, she moved across the road to Notre Dame to become assistant rec­tor at Notre Dame's Breen­Phillips Hall. She successfully managed these two demanding careers until 1987, when she became rector of Farley Hall, serving in that post until 1993. She stayed on the Notre Dame campus teaching French, and became assistant vice president for student affairs in 1998. 
Although a remarkably mod­est, even self-deprecating woman, Gude confessed some degree of pride at her work in the student affairs office as chair of the Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs (recently renamed the Core Council for Gay and Lesbian Students). 
"I think it's the work with our gay and lesbian students that I'm most satisfied with," she said, "and let me tell you, it's not the easiest work in the world. On the one hand, we're committed to affirm Church teachings on sexuality, and on the other hand, our commit­ment obliges us to do all we can to respond to their needs and to make Notre Dame a welcoming place." 
University President Emeritus Father Edward "Monk" Malloy and University President Father John Jenkins have praised the committee's efforts over the years, and vice president of Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman recently described it as indispensable to the University. 
Gude's pride is amply justi­fied. Tirelessly at work in a ministry which all but guaran­teed the fury of passionately held, deeply opposed, and vehe­mently expressed convictions, she endured the recriminations of angry activists while estab­lishing a secure and charitable institutional environment in which gay and lesbian students would be heard, respected, and, most importantly, loved. 
"Basically, my method was hanging in there. I just refused to go away," she said. 
Even now, she won't be going too far away. 
''I'm looking forward to this translating gig," she said, refer­ring to her participation in an international conference of lloly Cross sisters last month in France. "Later on, I'll probably find something to do around Saint Mary's and Notre Dame." 
No one who knows Gude is surprised by those plans, but they are good news all the same.

Boston was the same. "I don't want to drive 20 hours to see my kid!" Duke'? My mom thought the dorm tradition of burn­ing benches before basketball games was just too "destructive"-never mind that the students rebuilt them atlervvard. Even hometown favorite UW-Madi<;on was out of the running. "Mad, you're going to get tear gassed on Halloween!" 
The drama cuhninated in a heated argument when my mom decided Georgetown would somehow corrupt me. The screaming was at that high pitch that only an irate mother can produce. "I don't want you to grow up to be a hard-nosed politician!" The showdovvn left me fuming, but as I cooled dmvn. I became frustrated.

A small measure of peace 
As a Film, Television and Theatre diseiple, I continually find myself fasci­nated by the way life's realities are reflected in the movies. Every tilm ­from the all-time greats on down to the most mundane and mediocre ones ­contains elements that awaken memo­ries and stir the senses. Often the piet.ures we remem­ber most vividly are those that remind us of people we love. places we admire or simply an emotion that trig­gers fond recollec­tions of a particular time in our lives. 
College is no dif­ferent. Hollywood has been mining this source for decades, amounting t.o hun­dreds of films that broach the subject, some more successfully than others. Whether it's a quirky character, unex­pected plot curve or a singular line of dialogue, there's something universally familiar about these films. 
With this in mind, I tried to recall a scene from a film that most strongly reminded me of my Notre Dame expe­rience. And, while my first gut instinet was to write a loving ode to the spiritu­al wonders of "Rudy," for the sake of originality I forced myself to broaden my horizons. 
Surprisingly, the film that. surfaced most often wasn't the tale of a pint­sized walk -on with barely a speck of athletic talent. It was direetor Edward Zwick's "The Last Samurai." 
The film chronicles the account of American Civil War veteran Nathan ,\lgren -played deftly by Cruise ­and his eapture at the hands of Katsumoto (Ken Want.anabe), a noble Japanese warrior unwilling to let the way of the svvord expire. As Algren begrudgingly seU.los into his eivil cap­tivity, his attitude towards the sam u­rai's adherenee to the time-honored traditions of Japanese culture changns from one or animosity to genuine won­der. A wayward warrior most of his

life, Algren admits to a mysterious presence shrouding this small Japanese village deep in tho moun­tains, a presence that envelops him despite its unfamiliarity. He tries to col­lect. his thoughts in a journal, strug­gling to put on paper his wavering alle­giances. 
"This marks the longest I've stayed in one place since I left the farm at 17 ," begins Algren. ''I've never been a churchgoing man, and what I've seen on the field of battle has led me to question God's purpose. But there is indeed something spiritual in this place. And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power. I do know that. it is here that I've known my first untroubled sleep in many years." 
When I first saw "The Last Samurai" in theaters, I was comfortably settled into my sophomore year at Notre Dame. But something about those words, penned by screenwriter John Logan, lodged in my mind like a wel­come splinter. I wasn't aware ol'it then, but they would eome to epitomize what Notre Dame means to me after what seems like a lifetime here. 
Although I was born in India, my family has been moving almost nonstop sinee I was three years old. In fact, by the time my Notre Dame career comes to a close. I will have lived under the shadow of the Golden Dome longer than any of the dozen other places around the world I have called home. When people ask where I'm from, my stoek answer is usually, "All over, but I currently live in [blank)." It's much easier than trying t.o spew out recollec­tions of the spots in India, England and the United States where some of my fondest memories remain. ­
And while my Jesuit high school experience never felt unwelcome, I was raised Hindu and eontinue to learn something new about the Catholic faith everyday. In fact, the first time I was within earshot of a homily eame during ninth grade at a required high school Mass. As the only Hindu in attendance. I ff-1H lost as I clumsily tried to mimic the words and gestures of a foreign liturgy, wondering whether L'd ever lit in. 
Fortunately, almost a decade later, all I have to do is glance across Notre Dame's campus to find my answer. Whether it's the green plains of the Quads or the shimmer of the lakes on a crisp fall day, there's something about this eampus that demands a quiet attention. While the Notre Dame family continues to be the driving force · behind our University's relevance, I ean't help but feel there's something else at work here, something spiritual. 
People talk about the Notre Dame eampus as a dosed bubble, sheltering her students from the rough realities of the outside world. But I'd like to think there's something peaeeful about this campus and this community that keeps pulling us back, often decades after we graduate. 
A lifetime's worth of memories are paeked into this place by graduation's end. But above all, Notre Dame is home. For the better part of four years -five if you're lucky-this campus is all we know. Home isn't always where you think it is, but often where you're fortunate enough to find it. Or realize where it's always been. 
Glancing up at the auric light reflect­ing off Our Lady, it's hard to verbalize exaetly what. makes Notre Dame spe­cial. 
All I can do is recall that scene from "The Last Samurai," in whieh a quiet understanding creeps across Algren 's face. He finally understands what he's found. Home.

'Grip and Rip' your way through Notre Dame 
In light of this weekend's PGA championship in Medinah, Ill., it seems an appropriate time to tell one of my favorite stories about a past tournament champion. 
John Daly was a young, 22-year old kid from Arkansas who traveled to the 1991 PGA Championship as the ninth alternate. He received word that he would be playing in the tournament at 2 a.m. the morning of the opening round, only after eight golfers had bailed. 
Daly fired opening rounds of 69-6 7 and went into Saturday on top of the leader board amidst little pressure from the media and Friday afternoon crowd. After a 69 on Saturday, The Lion headed into Sunday as a fan favorite, poised for a storybook ending. 
Here's where it gets interesting. 
If you don't know that John Daly is a long hitter, well then in the words of The Dude, "You must not be a golfer." For most of the weekend, Daly, who led the PGA Tour in driving distance from 1991-2002, got by with hitting driv­er and lob wedge into the green (an impressive feat con­sidering most people can't hit a lob more than 50 yards). 
But on the back nine Sunday, Daly was looking at a dif­ficult par four where hitting a driver might have put him in a tough location. Sensing Daly's hesitation, his caddy looked him the eye and said, "Rip it, John," handing him his favorite club. 
For those of you still reading, you must be wondering what this has to do being incoming freshmen at Notre Dame. It's probably a bit of a stretch, but bear with me. 
In the back of Daly's mind there was a voice telling him to make a quick adjustment that might be the safer approach. He could have hit a 3-wood and had a better look at the hole. Nobody would have shaken their head at his decision and plenty would have credited his maturity. 
But instead, Daly went with his gut. He relied on the club that had put him in the position to win golfs fourth

Assistant Managing Editor 

major of the season -when he should not have been there in the first place. For roughly 65 holes he had gripped and ripped his way to the top of the leader board and instead of playing it conservatively, he went with what got him there. 
My only advice to you as freshmen is to take a similar approach. 
Over the next four years, you will all invariably face challenges that will force you to examine the best course of action. As you experience change and development, you will begin to make decisions in a more calculated manner with respect to how you've handled situations in the past. 
It's normal, really. A huge aspect of maturity is the way we handle life's little challenges. How you react to a prob­lem as an 18-year-old might be very different than how you will see it in three years. 
But that doesn't mean you have to change what you are. Your strengths are your strengths, and don't be afraid to rely on them. 
For instance, have you crammed for tests your entire life and gotten by fairly well? Don't fool yourself. That's not changing in college. 
But instead of looking at the people who are spending hours in the library every night, understand that it is sim­ply not you. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't at least try to fmish assignments in a timely manner, but don't be intimidated by students with a different work ethic. 
This works on the flip side, too. If you know that in order to do well in class, it's imperative that you work hard on a daily basis, don't be influenced by your friends who can blow things off and worry about it later. They are no better than you; they just operate differently. 
Instead of winning tournaments by crushing drivers, they have mastered chipping and putting. Know your lim­itations and play to your strengths. 
Look, I'm not advocating blowing off your responsibili­ties. That will put you on thin ice at Notre Dame faster than you can say Zbikowski. But you all have succeeded thus far in your lives operating in many different ways. 
Don't let the patterns of others affect what has gotten you to where you are. 
Instead of seeing aspects of your individuality as imped­iments to your success, view them as part of your overall package. If you have never been able to sit down and analyze numbers, you probably won't be much of a math­ematician. , 
But you might be the best danm salesman in the office. 
So whatever you do, don't view college as a huge obsta­cle that you will have to somehow conquer despite your limitations. Look at everything that got you to where you are as the backbone of who you are, for better or worse. Nobody is perfect and everyone would like to do things a little different. 
But despite your differences, you all have one thing in common. You were all admitted into Notre Dame, and probably a number of other top 20 universities. You all have shown somebody along the way that you are special people wfth distinct qualities. 
Some of you are athletes and others are artists. Some of you can do advanced linear algebra and others think a matrix is a Keanu Reeves movie. Some of you can quote 19th century literature and others only focus on the sports pages. 
You are who you are, and it has impressed people along the way. Remember that. 
By the way, Daly made par on the hole. Now it's your turn. Just don't be afraid to take out the driver when everyone else might be using a 3-wood.

Taking a chance on change 
I cried. Not only did I cry, I sobbed, heaved and wailed -any way you look at it I was a complete, total and utter mess. 
From the Jamaica Shaka to Domer Fest and a Taste of Saint Mary's, I had partici­pated in every awkward 
mixer possible. I shook the hands of dozens of Katies, Megans and Katherines, perfected the set-up of my cozy McCandless Hall dorm room and even tested my seemingly shy social skills at the then off­

campus drinking mecca Kelly Meehan Turtle Creek, but none 
Saint Mary's
of that seemed to ease 
Editor

the tensions brewing inside of me. 
My volcano of emotions erupted just hours before my parents hopped back into their mini-van to travel over 300 miles back to my home in Poland, Ohio. 
As I curled up crying on my futon at the conclusion of the College's freshman orien­tation I was not upset because I was sad, homesick or lonely -I cried because I knew I would never be the same. 
Until that exact moment I generally knew what to expect with each passing moment of life. All the basic elements that I had become overly familiarized with in the duration of my seemingly simple 18 year life -who my best friends were, where we 
hung out, what my teachers were like and when dinner would be ready-vanished during Frosh-0 weekend. 
Sitting in my 1 Ox14 cinderblock dorm room on that steamy August afternoon in 2003, I had been given an opportunity that I could not yet comprehend. I barely knew what was in store for me in the next four years of my life, but I had an inkling it would be like nothing I had ever experi­enced before. 
After being on campus for just a few days, I realized my time at Saint Mary's would present me with a variety of chal­lenges and heartbreaks, but it would also enrich my life with a sense of happiness and fulfillment that I had never known. 
Although I doubted my rationale for opt­ing to attend an academically rigorous sin­gle-sex college in the middle of Indiana for a few hours that day, I would not trade a single moment of my college experience for anything. 
The distraught confusion that over­whelmed me at the conclusion of freshman orientation was the driving force that pushed me to take advantage of all Saint Mary's had to offer. 
I knew I could float through these next years, cutting corners and making a few friends here and there, or I could seize each opportunity that came my way. 
Going away to college was the major leap in the series of risks I would force myself to take during my college experience. The true essence of collegiate life lies within these generally difficult decisions each of us must make-some we can foresee, loom­ing in the distance, while others sneak up behind us, forcing us to make an immedi­ate decision that may ultimately change the direction of our lives. 
It is crucial to realize sometimes spon­taneity spices up the monotonous schedule that is all too easy to embrace while in col­lege. Avoiding collegiate doldrums calls us to become perhaps a little more daring than we had ever imagined. The inner superhero emerges as when you challenge yourself to do something you never thought you would do. So study abroad, participate in a service trip or play an intramural sport -even if you are lacking athletic ability. 
Just three short years ago I was a naive 18-year-old girl wallowing in worry and self-pity as I anticipated my mysterious future. I only wish I could have peered into the future for just a moment to fully realize Saint Mary's would not only develop my mind spiritually and academically, but would also serve as a platform that allowed me to travel the world, achieve my journal­istic goals and make the best friends of my life. 
Today I congratulate you for overcoming (or at least beginning to adapt to) the initial challenge of your fantastic four-year jour­ney. You will truly enjoy the ride. Embrace the unique opportunities that lie in front of you today, for most of them remain dor­mant until you discover them, breathe life into them and make them your own.

New stadium a splash of optimism in the desert 
Once woebegone Cardinals franchise signs impact free agents, has high hopes for upcoming campaign 
Associated Press 
GLENDALE, Ariz. -The new silver palace shimmers like some desert mirage in the western suburbs of Phoenix. 
Yes, the Arizona Cardinals ­a franchise that long set the standard for futility in profes­sional sports -finally have a home. 
This is a team that seems reborn. 
In addition to their $455 million stadium, the Cardinals signed Edgerrin James, one of the top running backs in the game, as a free agerit, and drafted a Heisman Trophy­winning quarterback, Matt Leinart. They have the best tandem of young receivers in the NFL and, believe it or not, are sold out at home for the season. 
Could the tentacles of pro football parity reaeh all the way to owner Bill Bidwill's long-vilified operation? 
"People are starting to understand that we aren't fooling around," said Bidwill's son, Michael, Cardinals vice president and general counsel. "We want to build a champi­onship team." 
Until the fancy trappings and big names translate to victories, though, the term "same old Cardinals" will be hard to erase. 
"The only way you can change people's perception of j.our team is by winning," wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald said. "We've got all the pieces. No more excuses." 
This is the oldest of football franchises, tracing its roots to the late 1890s, when a neigh­borhood group played in south Chicago under the name Morgan Athletic Club. 
In 1920, the franchise was a charter member of what would become the National Football League. Charles Bidwill bought the team for $50,000 in 1932 and his widow, Violet, moved it from Chicago to St. Louis 28 years later. 
Sons Charles and Bill shared ownership from 1962 until 1972, when Bill Bidwill took over sole ownership. He moved the Cardinals to Arizona in 1988 with nothing more than a handshake prom­ise for a stadium. 
Meanwhile, the team lost, lost and lost some more. 
In their years in the desert, the Cardinals have had one winning season, going 9-7 in 1998 and upsetting Dallas in the playoffs for the franehise's first postseason victory since beating Philadelphia for the NFL title in 1947. 
The success proved fleeting, and crowds dwindled. 
Few wanted to sit in the metal bleachers of Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium under the scorching sun to watch bad football.The play­ers, meanwhile, sweated and suffered. 
"The heat index was just off the charts," said Ron Wolfley, Cardinals radio analyst who played for the team from 1985-91. "If you were a farmer, you'd tell your cattle to stay inside."

Yet skepticism abounds. 

In coach Dennis Green's first two seasons, the team went 6­10 and 5-11. The offensive line is suspect, and without a ground game, the spectacular plays of young receivers Fitzgerald and Boldin won't be enough. · 
Warner, the former Super Bowl and NFL MVP who at 35 is the quarterback designated to lead the team to success while Leinart learns, said the team is trying to build "a cul­ture of winning." 
A state-of-the-art stadium does not guarantee suecess. 
"Houston got a new stadi­um," James said, "and they haven't done nothing." 
But standing in the cav­ernous home locker room after the team's preseason vic­tory over Pittsburgh, Bill Bidwill expressed "relief and satisfaction" that the building was finished. 
A quiet man who prefers Michael to be the franchise's public face, he said he thinks people no longer doubt his commitment to winning.

Bonds' trainer withholds testimony from grand juryhearing 
Anderson continues to refuse from commenting about acquaintances, including Pats QB, may face prison time 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds'" personal trainer may go back to jail for refusing again to testify about his acquaintances before a grand jury. What he told federal prosecutors, however, has dragged Tom Brady's name into the BALCO case. 
In a June statement to pros­ecutors about his intentions to stay mum, Greg Anderson said he and the New England Patriots quarterback had spo­ken over the phone -but never established further con­tact. 
"I had only one brief conver­sation with Tom Brady regarding a potential future workout," Anderson said. "I never had another phone con­versation with him and never discussed it with anyone." 
Anderson also told federal prosecutors June 23 that he would continue to withhold testimony from a newly assembled grand jury that is reportedly also investigating track coach Trevor Graham. 
"I will not ever make state­ments about other people," Anderson said in the state­ment, which was included in court documents unsealed Wednesday. "That has always been my position and will tion on it," Patriots continue to be." spokesman Stacey James said.

Anderson previously served three months in prison after pleading guilty to steroid dis­tribution and money launder­ing stemming from the gov­ernment's investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Co­Operative, which that alleged­ly supplied Bonds and other elite athletes with perform­ance-enhancing drugs. 
Some legal experts see Anderson as the key to prov­ing the perjury allegations, since Bonds reportedly testi­fied that the trainer gave him two substances that fit the description of "the cream" and "the clear" -two per­formance-enhancing drugs linked to BALCO. 
In 2003, Bonds reportedly testified to the grand jury investigating BALCO that he believed the substances were flaxseed oil and arthritis balm, not steroids. 
Anderson also could offer insight into the doping calen­dars bearing Bonds' name that were seized when federal agents raided Anderson's house, according to court papers connected to the steroids probe. 
But Anderson's lawyers say he shouldn't have to testify because of the numerous leaks of secret grand jury tes­timony to the San Francisco Chronicle during the course of the four-year investigation. 
Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru­Wada have written a book based largely on leaked testi­mony. 
A federal judge has told the reporters they must tell a grand jury who leaked them secret testimony. The pair have said they would go to jail rather than reveal their source or sources. 
Anderson's lawyers also say the agreement he made with prosecutors to plead guilty last year in the BALCO case stip4lated he wouldn't have to cooperate in the investigation. Anderson also shouldn't have to testify because he was the target of an illegal wiretap, they argue. 
The new grand jury order­ing Anderson's testimony can stay in session for as long as 18 months. 
By law, an intransigent Anderson can be locked up for the grand jury's full term, though a judge can free him sooner if convinced he never will talk.

Elway's losses helping Manning find success 
NFL 
MVP's patience thin with playoff failures 
Associated Press 
TERRE HAUTE, Ind. ­Peyton Manning went out of his way during the offseason to seek out two guys who know how it feels to miss a golden opportunity. 
It just so happens that Mike Shanahan and John Elway also know what it's like to bounce back. 
What became of Manning and the Indianapolis Colts last sea­son sure had a familiar ring to it: A dominant regular season, clinching home-field advantage with a month to go, going into the first round with rested starters -and falling flat. 
All that happened to the Broncos in 1996, with a shock­ing loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
"Their feeling was similar to ours," Manning said this sum­mer, relaxing during a break in training camp. "The sickness, the missed opportunity. It's as low as it can be. You work so hard to get home field these days." 


The subtext? That same Denver team went on to win two consecutive Super Bowls. If Manning wants to shake the persistent notion that he can put up numbers but can't win the big one, he'll have to follow in Elway's footsteps. 
"It's a great lesson," Manning said. "They took their time to put it aside and not feel sorry for themselves. And making their peace with the football gods, they did something about it and played a little angry the next year and won two in a row. 
"That's what I'd like to do. I'd like to win Super Bowls. Bowls. Multiple. Not just one." 
Playing a little angry might be a good place to start. 
Elway told Manning that the Broncos' dismay at that bitter loss to the Jaguars made them more eager to come back quick­ly. They ended up with a wild­card slot the following season -forcing them to play hard all the way -and beat Green Bay in the Super Bowl. 
But anger isn't Manning's comfort zone. Intellect and a ferocious work ethic are. 
That frenetic motion that fans see on the field _ pointing and waving at the line of scrim­mage; calling audibles or faking them -is a manifestation of the intelligence. The fact that he can communicate his vision to teammates speaks to his tire­less striving for perfection. 
Manning is a leader by exam­ple, spending countless hours studying and throwing to his receivers in offseason workouts. 
"Forty straight outs," he says. "Not an out, then a post, then some other route like a lot of quarterbacks do. It's repetition, repetition, repetition, so that when you're in a game, it's automatic." 
His teammates reciprocate. 
"If Peyton asks me, I'll do it. If I ask Peyton to do something, he'll do it," says Marvin Harrison, his favorite receiver, who is on course to finish his career second only to Jerry Rice in many receiving categories. 
Manning, meanwhile, already broke Dan Marino's season record for touchdown passes in 2004 with 49, and has a real shot at eclipsing his career passing records. If he never wins a title, though, he and Marino will have that in -com­mon, too. 
Maybe it's too early to label Manning a loser. But he remains a non-winner. 
"The Super Bowl question is legitimate," he said. "''ve done a lot, but that's one thing I haven't done since I've been here." 

Colts coach Tony Dungy ­who also carries that label with a sparkling regular-season record but no Super Bowl -is quick to point to another great athlete who started to hear the whispers. 
"You forget that they were saying that about Michael Jordan after the Bulls kept los­ing to Detroit," Dungy said. "They said he'd never win. Then he won six champi­onships. Peyton will win. He just has to finish it once and he'll keep going." 
Until last season, Manning's playoff losses were to arguably better teams. Although he played horribly in two playoff losses in Foxborough to New England, it's only fair to point out that both times the Patriots were en route to their second and third Super Bowl titles. 
But for the better part of last year, the Colts were the best team in football. 
Their run to 13-0 was the only topic that could trump the antics of an obstreperous wide receiver then with the Eagles. Not only were they the favorite to get to the Super Bowl, but they appeared well on their way to becoming the first team besides the 1972 Miami Dolphins to go unbeaten. 
With home-field advantage well in hand, Indianapolis lost at home to San Diego on Dec. 18, a loss that was followed by the death of Dungy's son. 
The perfect season gone and a cloud of sadness hanging over them, the Colts regrouped and began to gear up for the play­offs. 
Manning and the rest of the starters sat for most of the last two regular-season games, a loss at Seattle and a win over Arizona. 
Then it all came crashing down at the RCA Dome. 
In the Colts' first playoff game, a blown replay call, a shoestring, game-saving tackle by Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and a shanked, game-tying field goal by Indy's Mike Vanderjagt all added up to a bizarre and shocking loss to Pittsburgh. 
For his part, Manning was bad early, so-so later and good when it was too late. Another playoff loss, another stamp in the impression that Manning can't win the big game.

Browns immortal Jim Brown. 
When a broadcaster asked offensive coordinator Jim Bollman last week if Wells was just lying in wait to take Pittman's job, Bollman nearly lost it. 
"Now wait a minute. Antonio Pittman is THE No. 1 tail­back," Bollman said, his eyes narrowing and his voice ris­ing. 
Bollman pointed out that only one back in Ohio State history -Archie Griffin ­gained more yards (1,577) as a sophomore than Pittman. 
"All the great backs who have been here and Archie's the only guy to gain more yards than him as a sopho­more?" Bollman continued, still boiling. "C'mon. Who's going to come in here and take his place? No way." 
Smith said Pittman is the linchpin of the offense.

In Ohio State's only Big Ten loss, Pittman and Hunt fought to a statistical draw, the for­mer going for 58 yards on 15 carries and the latter 64 on 16. 
Pittman has tried to school Wells this year, showing what a team player he is. 
Despite his big rushing total a year ago, he said he'd like to go for 1,700 yards this season. 
What means more to him, however, is the strong endorsements from his team­mates and coaches. 
"That means a lot, but this is a new year," he said. "I feel as if I'm coming in here as a freshman. I'm hungry. It's up to me to hold the job and prove myself once again."

Tea111s take advantage of new transfer rules 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE. Fla. Florida coach Urban Meyer spoke out against tlw NCAA's new graduate-transfer rule in May, calling it a loophole that needed to be -and eventually would be-closed. 
lie's more approving now. especially since cornerback Ryan Smith used the rule to leave Utah, enroll at Florida and give the Gators some much-needed depth in the sec­ondary. 
"I like it this year. I won't like it next year," Meyer said. 
Cal coach Jeff Tedford and Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson might agree; they also accepted transfers under the new legislation. Others, though, have questioned and criticized the rule that allows athletes who graduate and have eligibility remaining to transfer without the penalty of sitting out a season. 
"It's a bad rule because any­thing that encourages disloyal­ty is an awful thing," Duke coach Ted Roof said. "It's awful for college football, and it's the wrong message to send to young men -that it's OK to do that sort of thing." 
The Division I board of directors passed the legisla­tion in April, giving accelerat­ed student-athletes more options when it comes to pur­suing graduate degrees and waiving the normal one-year waiting period if they decide to transfer. Although most coaches believe the rule won't have a widespread effect, they fear it will encourage pro­grams to secretly recruit play­ers who qualify to transfer. 
It might have already hap­pened. At least three promi­nent players have taken advantage of the change. 
Smith started 12 games for Meyer and the Utes in 2004 and had 44 tackles and an interception. He started the first five games last year, but was replaced in the lineup midway through the season by the new coaching staff. 
He left Utah after spring practice, saying he was physi­cally and mentally exhausted from the game, but quickly began making plans to move to Gainesville. 
His transfer somewhat coin­cided with the departure of cornerback Avery Atkins, who was released from his scholar­ship in June after he was accused of striking the mother of his 2-month-old child. 
Smith said he considered transferring long before Atkins' troubles. But he also didn't choose Florida solely for its graduate program in edu­cational leadership: he wanted to be reunited with Meyer and position coach Chuck Ileater. 
"It could possibly affect 
overy school in tiH1 wrong way," Hoof said. "I doubt that tlw intent of ovnry rule is to enhance tho quality of tho gamo and tlw oxperience. But this is OIHl I know a lot of poo­plo don't agroo with." 
Hoof acknowlodges being somewhat biasnd. having lost a two-year startor on tlw offonsive linP to Cal becauso of the legislation. 
Guard Tylnr Krieg graduatnd from Duko in May with a bachelor's degren in political science. He transferred to Cal to pursue a master's in educa­tion, but he basnd the movn mostly on football. 
"The lack of success at Duke had a lot to do with my deei­sion," Krieg said. "It definitely was super frustrating going through four losing seasons at Duke. You put everything you have into it. Football is a large part of your college life." 
Not surprisingly, Tedford supports the rule. 
"If we had a fifth-year guy who wasn't completely happy, I would be OK with him trans­ferring," Tedford said. "Of course, you would hope that a guy in his fifth year would have an investment in the pro­gram." 
That didn't seem to be the case for Arizona quarterback Richard Kovaleheck. He start­ed the first seven games for the Wildcats last season, com­pleting 125 of 220 passes for 1,350 yards and 10 touch­downs. 
But after losing his starting spot to freshman Willie Tuitama, Kovalcheck decided to transfer to Vanderbilt. Kovalcheck, a senior with 11 career starts, could be the player to replace first-round NFL draft pick Jay Cutler. 
Unlike Roof at Duke, Arizona coach Mike Stoops backed the move. 
"In Richard's case, he lost his job and had a chance to play somewhere else," Stoops said. "More power to him." 
Other coaches might not feel the same way. 
"That rule was a strange one when it came out," Boston College coach Tom O'Brien said. "I guess if you graduate and you're dissatisfied and you want to go play some­where else, you can just pack up and go. It's beyond me." 
Although Meyer took advan­tage of the legislation, he still believes NCAA members and conference representatives will vote to override the legis­lation in January. 
Until then, though, the rule could help some teams and hurt others. 
"I think overybody's suscep­tible nnll t11ey should be wor­ried because it can negatively affect anyone," Hoof said. "The rule nf1eds to bn changed."

Concussion symptoms recurfor Matheny two months after injury 
Associated Press 

SAN FHANCISCO -Mikn Mathnny had bngun pownr washing his dnck last month whnn tlw symptoms rnturnnd. Ilnadat:lws. Fogginnss. Short­term nwmory loss. 
All wnrn signs tlw Ciants eatehnr had yet to rncovnr from tlw concussion that has sidnlinnd him sinen May :~1. and now for tho rnst of the season, following a snrios of foul tips that caromnd ofT his mask with sueh for~:n that they damag1~d his brain. 
Even tho lightost bit of exertion -such as elimbing stairs -is too m ueh for Matheny, who's known for having played through all sorts of aehes and pains dur­ing a 13-year career. 
This time, he took enough blows in succession to put him on the disabled Jist at the end of May. More than two months later, his brain still hasn't healed. It's tough for him to wateh his teammates on TV, Jet alone take in a game in person. 
"I walk into a room and for­get why I went in there," Matheny said, sitting in San Francisco's dugout before a recent game. "I forget things I've never forgotten before. I've lost my wallet and phone I can't tell you how many times. 
"Sometimes I shake my head and laugh at myself," he said. "There's nothing I can do about it." 

A concussion is a shaking of the brain that causes chemi­cal changes. Athletes suffer an estimated 300,000 of them nationwide each year, according to the Sports Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medieal Center. Most recover fully, but experts believe a person who suffers a concus­sion is more prone in the future. 
Repeated trauma of the brain can result in cognitive and neurological disabilities, even death. 
"With a single concussion, you're going to recover," said Dr. Micky Collins, assistant director of the University of Pittsburgh concussion center where Matheny has been treated. "The problem is, when you have a concussion and undergo these chemical changes, you're a lot more vulnerable if you have a sec­ond before the first one is recovered." 
While comparatively rare in baseball, concussions have ended celebrated careers in other sports. NFL quarter­backs Troy Aikman and Steve Young eventually had to call it quits after too many con­cussions.

PREPPING FOR TECH 


NFL 

Colts looking for kickers 
Without Smith and Vinatieri, Indy seeks emergency backups 
Associated Press 

TEHRE HAUTE, Ind. ­Backup kickers should send job applications to the Indianapolis Colts. 
Adam Vinatieri and punter llunter Smith are both injured and expected to miss Sunday's preseason game against Seattle, leaving the Colts scrambling to find replacements. 
On Wednesday, that meant trying out backup quarter­back Shaun King at kicker and tight end Ben Utecht at punter. Dungy appreciated their efforts, but by Thursday, he'd already decided the Colts needed to add two experienced kickers for the preseason home opener. 
lie said after the morning workout that the team would probably sign kicker Shane Andrus and a punter. 
Andrus came to training camp in the unenviable posi­tion of having to beat out Vinatieri. widely regarded as the NFL's best in the clutch, a rflputation he earned after making two Super Bowl-win­ning kicks for New England. The Colts signed Vinatieri to a five-year, $12 million con­tract in March. 
So it was no surprise when Indy released Andrus, a free agent from Murray State, on Monday when five new play­ers joined the roster. 
Then the rash of injuries that depleted other areas 

finally hit the Colts' special­
ists. Vinatieri sprained his 
left ankle -or plant foot ­
while running. He hasn't 
practiced since. 
Dungy initially planned to 
use Smith as the backup, but 
that changed Tuesday when 
the punter strained his groin 
and missed practice the past 
two days. So the coach 
improvised. 
While King tried kicking for the first time in his life, Utecht returned to a spot he ·once held at the University of 
Minnesota. 
The results were mixed. 
"I should have retired after 
my first one," King joked 
Thursday. "I hit the first one, 
then got in a rut." 
Utecht was the Gophers' 
backup punter until his sen­
ior season when a sports 
hernia forced him to give up 
the role. 
Utecht said 
it was the 
Haute on Wednesday to watch practice but has .nDt yet re-signed. 
Most of the Colts other key play·ers have returned to practice.The biggest names, aside from Vinatieri and Smith, missing from Thursday morning's practice were safety Mike Doss, defensive tackles Corey Simon and Montae Reagor, guard Ryan Lilja and wide receiver Brandon Stokley. 
All are significant contribu­tors, but Lilja, Simon and Reagor have all missed at least one week. Doss has missed the last two days of practice after aggravating a calf injury that kept him out most of the first two weeks of camp. 
Stokley's injury is the most serious. He sprained his left 
ankle Sunday, 
and he could 
miss the Colts' 


first time in regular-season

ty comfort­able in those situa­tions," Utecht said. "Somebody asked me yester­day if it was like riding a bike, you don't forget. It did­n't take me long to get used to it again." 
Dungy was more impressed with Utecht's results than King's but apparently was not convinced he should use Utecht Sunday night. 
"We've already found out he can be an emergency punter for us, if we nond it," Dungy said. 
Andrus returned to Terre not yet indi­
cated why 
rookie safety Jahmile Addae became light­headed during Wednesday morning's workout, Dungy said. 
Addae was to have more tests Thursday in Indianapolis. 
Dungy said there was another way the Colts could deal with their kicking dilem­ma-don't punt Sunday. 
"I hope we don't punt as often as we did last week," he said. "Maybe we'll just score touchdowns or go for it every time."

Talented frosh join Irish 
Waldrum adds five scholarship players for fifth-ranked team 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

Notre Dame needed to replace two All-Americans, a four-year starting goalkeeper and a starting senior mid­fielder after they graduated in May. No problem. 
Irish coach Randy Waldrum signed five players to letters of intent in February, and four more have joined the team to start the 2006 cam­paign, as the team kicks off with a preseason No. 5 rank­ing. 
Waldrum announced the signings of forward Michele Weissenhoffer, defender Haley Ford, goalie Kelsey Lysander and midfielders Courtney Rosen and Amanda Clark Feb. 5. 
He later added defenders Mara Paz de Araujo, Rachel VanderGenugten and Ashley Galovic and midfielders Amber Lattner and Micaela Alvarez to the team's fall ros­ter. 
"We've been very pleased with all five," Waldrum said after Notre Dame's 5-0 victo­ry over Xavier in an exhibi­tion game Thursday on Alumni Field. "They've all come in like veterans." 
Weissenhoffer, who scored a goal and added an assist in the win, will take the roster spot of Katie Thorlakson. Thorlakson was a two-time All-American who tallied 18 goals and 35 assists (71 points) her senior season after leading the Irish to a national championship in 2004 with 23 goals and 24 assists. 
Weissenhoffer was a club teammate of Clark, who led the back line of their Eclipse Select elub team that won national titles in 2004 and 2005. 
At 5-foot-6, Clark offers the physical ver­satility both to shut down opposing

Irish head coach 
The fresh­man class' natural mid­fielder, Rosen, is a product of Brecksville, Ohio, and has played on the U.S. U-17 and U-18 national squads since she was 15. 
While Rosen, Clark and Weissenhoffer all were highly sought-after recruits, Waldrum said the 5-foot-9 defender Ford slipped under the radar of many other pro­grams. 
Ford was a dedicated play­er in high school, regularly traveling five and a half' hours from her hometown of Midland, Texas, to Dallas to play with her club team, the Dallas Texans. 
"It's a lot easier now," Ford said of' living on campus within a few minutes of' tho practice field. 
Her defensive responsibili­ties will be important as Notre Dame enters 2006 without graduated defender Candace Chapman and goal­keeper Erika Bohn. 
That's where Lysandor comes in.

Nine new players will suit up for 2006 Belles 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
Trying to build on an 11-7-1 record and a third-place MIM finish a year ago, Saint Mary's will add at least nine new fresh­men to its roster this season. 
Saint Mary's head eoach Caryn MacKenzie said that while the roster has not bnen linalizod, tho freshnwn began practice Thursday. Opon tryouts will be held Monday to fill as many remaining slots as Mackenzie sees lit. 
"We nevnr know [who we will have on our rost1)rl until we see them on the liel"d," Mackenzie said. "We won't know until Monday what our team will look like." 
Mackenzie said that the nine freshmen who startod Thursday -Briana Cantu (Austin, Tx.), Katy Durkin (Pontiac, Mich.), Colleen Ferguson (Dunlap, Ill.), Molly CaiTney (lludson. Ohio). Samantha Coudreau (Lake Forest, Ill.), Michelle Bedinger (Jaspnr, Ind.), Bridget Hornayne (Mundnlein, Ill.), Jessica Slean (Allison Park, Penn.) and Katie Wehrli (Fort Wayne, Ind.) -will be slotted into positions once Maekenzie sees them on the prac­tice field. 
"I don't get too wrapped up in positions," Mackenzie said. "What they do for me may be totally dif­ferent then what they did for their old coach." 
While the Belles only lost three seniors ol'f last year's team, Mackenzie said there are plenty of opportunities for the freshmen to see playing time. 
"It's just a matter how talented they are and how quickly they make the transition to the colle­giate level," she said. 
Mackenzie needs to replace most of her back wall after losing defenders Carrie Orr, Shannon Culbertson and Maura SchoPn to graduation. Orr was a first-team aii-MIAA pick last season. Junior Justine Higgins, who started 16 games in 2005, is the lone return­ing starter in the baek. To fill the holes, MacKenzie said she may move midfiolders to defense. 
"There's certainly an opportuni­ty for anyone to play there," she said. "The opportunity is there if you're willing to make the plays." 
Up front, the Belles return 2005 leading scorer Lauren Hinton, who netted 14 goals in 19 games last season. Her sister, senior Ashley !linton, also returns aftor scoring four goals from her start­ing midfield spot. 
At goalie, senior Laura Heline returns after starting all 19 games last season when she post­ed six shutout<; and allowed a lit­tle over a goal per game. 
Saint Mary's begins its season Aug. 26 at Anderson.

Walker, Hagerman, Kiley lead new class 
By CHRIS KHOREY 
Associare Sporrs Ediror 
With a multi-year contract extension extension in hand, Irish coach Joe Piane will begin his 32nd season at Notre Dame with 12 new faces on his roster. 
After losing four top seniors ­Tim Moore, Kaleb Van Ort, Sean O'Donnell and Vinny Ambrico -Piane said the freshmen will have a chance to make an imme­diate impact. 
''I've got some holes to fill," he said. "We're going to have some pretty good kids, but we're going to have to fill in with some fresh­men." 
Piane singled out freshmen Brock Hagerman of Markleville, Ind., Greg Kiley of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. and Jake Walker of Ellwood City, Penn. as the lead­ing candidates to run with Notre Dame's top seven early in the season. 
Hagerman won the individual Indiana state cross country championship last fall, while Kiley was the New York state champion in the indoor 1,600 meters. Walker recorded the fourth fastest high school indoor 3,000-meter time in the nation as a senior. 
Piane said other freshman may also contribute, but that several of the twelve in the incoming class -mainly middle-distance track runners -will be on the roster purely to stay in shape for track season. 
The Irish coaching staff sent each new runner a packet with workout instructions at the beginning of the summer. The program included a slow buildup in mileage, starting at 35 miles per week and growing through­out the summer. Piane also asked his runners to compete in several road races. 

The idea, Piane said, was to acclimate the freshmen to run­ning longer distances. College cross country races are 10 kilo­meters, twice the distance of high school. 
"That's a heck of a jump," Piane said. "What I'm asking them to do is run their high school best twice in one race. There really aren't other sports that are analogous."

New runners vie for five positions 
Connelly stresses high expectations 
By CHRIS KHOREY 
Associate Sports Ediror 
In the process of reloading a squad that lost five of its top seven runners to gradua­tion after last season, Notre Dame coach Tim Connelly brought five freshmen dis­tance runners to bolster his roster. 
"There are some of them that we think can contribute right away," Connelly said of his class of 2010, which starts practice with the team Aug. 21. 
Last season, then-freshman Hamsey Kavan burst on the scene, finishing No. 11 in the Notre Dame Invitational in her first collegiate race and holding down the team's fourth position for most of the season. 
This year, Connelly said he has three runners that may make an immediate impact 
Molly Sullivan of Elmhurst, Ill., Beth Tacl of St. Cloud, Minn. and Lindsay Ferguson of Greenfield Center, N.Y. 
Ferguson holds the nation­al high school record for the 2,000-meter steeplechase and ran the second-fastest high school time in the nation in the 3,000 meters during indoor track season last fall. 
"She's a pretty talented kid and a really good competitor, so we're counting on her to make an impact right off the bat," Connelly said of Ferguson. 
Sullivan spent most of the summer nursing an injury, but Connelly said he expects her to be ready when prac­tice starts. 
"She's a little behind, but we think she'll catch up quickly," Connelly said. 
Dominique Taylor (Gary, Ind.) and Maria Analisa Sandoval (Los Alamos, N.M.) will also practice with the team, although Connelly said they most likely will be train­ing for track season and are not expected to compete in meets. Both will compete in middle distances for the Irish track team in the winter and spring. 
Connelly said Taylor and Sandoval may compete in cross country down the road. 
"We've had a bunch of kids over the years that have taken a few years before they were ready to con­tribute at cross country, but once they've gotten out on the cross country course, they've been great," he said. 
Connelly sent each of the runners detailed instructions for their summer work outs last May. 
"We set a mileage goal and then move up to it," he said. "When we get close to the goal we start adding speed and tempo workouts as well." 
"What we want them to do and what they do are some­times two different things," he said. "Usually after their freshman year they'll have a much better idea of what we want them to do. More than anything, over the summer we just want them to be real­ly diligent and train really consistently." 
Still, Connelly said his most important expectation for incoming freshmen over the summer is that they work hard. 
"If they train consistently, they'll probably be ready for what we ask them to do when they get here," he said. 
The Irish open their season Sept. 8 at the Valparaiso Invitational in Valparaiso, Ind.·

"[The AJGA] is the best predictor we have to predict­ing if success in high school will translate to success in college," Kubinski said. "One reason is because the cours­es they play on the junior tours are so difficult. They're very comparable to college courses as they have long holes, thick rough, and difficult pin placements."

was any indica­tion of how Notre Dame freshmen typically perform, Kubinski has nothing to worry about. Sophomore Josh Sandman was one of the team's key players late in the 2005-06 season, post­ing scores of 70 and 71 to help the Irish win the Big East championship. 
"You don't usually see freshmen make a huge con­tribution, but Sandman exceeded our expectations," Kubinski said. "This year's class is very talented, though, and I think you could see two, three, or even all four in the starting lineup at some point this season."

(AVCA), Notre Dame bid farewell to five seniors, including second­team All-American Lauren Brewster and Lauren Kelbly, who received All-American honorable mention. 
Head coach Debbie Brown then signed seven freshmen, earning the attention of recruiting followers. Volleyball Magazine listed Notre Dame as the No. 3 recruiting class in the nation, behind Texas and Penn State, while Prepvolleyball.com ranked the Irish fifth. 
In large part because of the young team's potential, the AVCA ranked Notre Dame No. 21 in its preseason poll despite the fact that the Irish return only two starters from last season's team.

No.16 ranked freshman class takes to the pitch 
College Soccer News ranks both 2006 squad, rookie players highly a season after appearance in NCAA round of 16 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 
Entering the season, 16 seems to be the number most associated with Notre Dame. 
The Irish, who advanced to the Sweet 16 in last season's NCAA tournament, begin their 2006 campaign ranked No. 16 in the nation by College Soccer News. 
After the Irish successfully signed another strong recruit­ing class, College Soccer News gave Notre Dame's incoming freshmen the same ranking ­No. 16. 
"They're a very good class," head coach Bobby Clark said Tuesday. "We've had a lot of good classes the last few years, but this certainly is another one, with some very outstand­ing players." 
This year's freshman class includes two high school All­American midfielders in Justin Morrow and Michael Thomas, who scored 42 and 41 goals, respectively, in their high school careers. 
Additionally, two Irish fresh­men won All-State honors, as midfielder Dave Donahue was named to Massachusetts' All­State team twice, while Tamba Samba was an All-State for­ward in Indiana in his senior season. 
Joining them as rookies on the roster will be defender John Schaefer, midfielder John Baumgardner and goalkeeper Philip Tuttle. · 
While these seven players are a talented group, they may face an uphill battle if they plan to see significant minutes early on in the season. Notre Dame will return nine starters and 14 monogram winners from a year ago, including All­American midfielder Greg Dalby. 
"We've got a very strong returning group, so we're not in a position where we need to hurry anyone in," Clark said. "At the same time, if anyone deserves to be in, they'll be in." 
In the few weeks that the freshmen have been practicing with the team, Clark has seen an improvement in the play of his rookies. 
"All of them have actually done pretty well [in practice through Tuesday]. They've all shaped up, [and] they've all shown promise," Clark said. 
Before the Irish played their first of two exhibitions on Thursday at Drake, Clark was optimistic the games would 
shed  a  better light  on  the  
potential  impact  of  the  
youngest team members.  

"At the moment they're still learning, still learning the sys-tern," Clark said. "Until you've seen them play in a real game, it's difficult to know where they are." 
Clark also said he plans to give his new players plenty of time to learn the system and make an impression. 
"I try not to judge youngsters too early, because if you judge them too early before they're ready and before they get com­fortable, you can perhaps come to the wrong conclu­sions," he said. 
Hegardless of how much playing time they will see this season, Clark is confident that all the freshmen on the team will continue to improve and will serve as a solid foundation for upcoming seasons. 
"You can learn by getting thrown into the deep end, or you can learn by working everyday at practice with qual­ity players," he said. "Good players will learn by competing for time with experienced play­ers. If they're good players, they're going to be fine." 
Notes: 
+Notre Dame will play its home opener Monday in an exhibition game against St. Francis at 7 p.m. at Alumni Field. The team will ask for a $1 contribution from all those in attendance to support Grassroot Soccer, a program that aims to combat the AIDS epidemic in Mrica using soccer as a means of communication. 


Last season, the Irish took in slightly over $2,500 at the gate, and that number was matched by both a Notre Dame soccer alumnus -who wishes to remain anonymous -as well as the Notre Dame soccer camps, meaning the Irish were able to donate nearly $8,000 to the program.

New fall, new faces 
Weis welcomes 28 freshmen; Young, Prince and Burkhart fight for time 

'­
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
The reinforcements are here. 
During spring practice, Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis said the team's 25 incoming freshmen would provide impor­tant depth during fall camp. 
"I think the biggest area of con­cern is our offensive line depth chart until the reinforcements come in here," Weis said March 21 at the team's annual spring media day. 
They've arrived, and they arc battling each other and returning players for spaces on the depth chart. 
But the new faces on campus are not the only ones that will be new to the field when the Irish kick off against Georgia Tech on Sept. 2 in Atlanta. 
Three freshmen for 2007 came to Notre Dame in January. Offensive lineman Chris Stewart, running back James Aldridge and wide receiver George West were the flrst early entrants in school history, enrolling for the 2006

I lis fel­low freshman, 6-foot-7, 292­pound Sam Young, has fought for a starting job after arriving on campus this summer. Along with sophomore Paul Duncan, Young figures prominently in the battle for starting right tackle. 
If' Young starts, it will be only the fourth time in school history a true freshman has started any games on the o!Tensive line. The last freshman to accomplish the feat was Hyan Harris -now the team's senior left tackle.

Henley controls Belles court 
Bender's replacenzent comes to team with collegiate experience 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's emerged from a busy off-season with new head coach Jennifer Henley in charge of the Belles as 
they  head  toward  a  new  
position  on  the Divisio n III  
landscape.  

Henley eomes to Saint Mary's with five years of 
head coaching experience at Division III Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, where her teams went 43-87 with two seasons at .500 or better in 2002-03 and 2004­05. 
Athletic Director Lynn Kachmarik said Henley is the first eoaeh to take over the Saint Mary's program with prior college head coaching experience. 
"I am incredibly excited to begin this season," Henley said. "My goals are to build on last season's success and improve upon our MIAA fin­ish. I want our student-ath­
letes to reach their full potential both on and off the court." 
Henley will be taking over a squad that finished 11-15, including a third-place finish in the conference after being picked to place seventh in the nine-team league. The 2005-06 performance set a new school record for league wins since Saint Mary's joined the MIAA in 1997, earning former head coach Steve Bender MIAA Coach of the Year honors in his first year with the Belles.
