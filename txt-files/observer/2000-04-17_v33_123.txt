cause of sickness 
. 40 students complain of food­induced illness 
By MICHELLE KRUPA Senior Staff Writer 
SlicNI turkPV in North Dining llall may have con­tributed to 40 students' symptoms of nausPa, vom­iting and diarrhPa last weekend. Food SPrvices director Davn Prentkowski said. 
Most students who visit­ed Health Services lrntwccn Friday evening and Sunday morning reportPd having eaten the cold cuts sPrvPd from behind sandwich counters at North Dining Hall on Thursday, Im said. 
All turkey was n•moved from University dining halls and restaurants Friday. and samples were sent for microbiological testing upon n\com mtrnda­ti on of the Univnrsity's Office of Hisk Management, Prentkowski said. 
Broad precautions were taken despite tlw fact that employee error in prepara­tion or improper rnfrigcra­tion at a single location ­not spoiled meat -could be to blame. 
"This probably was iso­lated to a small anrn, not a shipment," hn said. "This sounds more like a han­dling problem. But as opposed to taking a rhanrn and saying that it wusn 't Ia shipment of' bad meat!, WP decided to pull anything that might bn a possibln hazard." 
NotrP Dnnw also discard­ed 3.000 turkcv sandwirh­l~S prPpared latP last wc(•k for volunt<wrs partiripating in Saturday's Christmas in April charity PVPnt.

SMC frosh to focus on 'Chicana' 
• Theme aims to spark awareness of personal identity 
By COLLEEN McCARTHY Associate News Editor 
Saint Mary's will celebrate the Chicana during the 2000­2001 academic year in an effort to encourage students to explore identity issues and create 8.11 environment that is more welcoming to Mexican­,\ meri.can students. whose enrollment at the College is increasing each year. 
for the last three school years, Saint Mary's has cho­sen a theme to focus curricu­lum in freshman classes.. Last year, the College joined the Michiana art community and focusrd on landscape throughout the year. In 2000-2001, Saint Mary's again joins local artists in choosing identity as a theme.

But ·why do I r0joice that I can e-mail people from an airport? Why do peoplo havo a right to expeet an instant response f'rom me? What rxaclly is so pressing that it couldn't wait until I gl't bark'? What is so important that it can't wait a few extra hours?

BELARUS 


Associated Press MINSK Launching his first for­rign trip as Bussia's pn~si­de n t. Vladimir Putin on Sunday pledged to stn' ngth 1111 a union with neighboring Belarus through closer military and economic ties. The follow Slavir. former Soviet republic was the first stop on a foreign tour that also takes Putin to l.ondon. Arter meeting with authoritarian 13clarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Putin told reporters the two dis­
cussed creating common tax policies. customs sys­tems and tariff regulations. Thev also talked about Belarusian proposals to form a 300,000-strong joint troop forr.e to guard Belarus' western border, according to Hussian tele­vision. 
But Putin stressed that integration should not be rushed. 
"The construction of a union state is a grandiose effort which should be car­ried out ... with care and consistency," he said. 
Lukashenko and former Hussian President Boris Yeltsin signed a union 

treaty in December, but many questions remain about how it will be administered. Though hard-liners initially hailed it as a step toward recreat­ing the Soviet Union. the agreement steered far clear of fully merging the two countries. 
Reformers in Hussia oppose any union with impoverished Belarus. whose president has cracked down on dissent and freedoms won after the 1991 Soviet collapse. 
Aftrr arriving in Minsk, Putin laid a wreath at a monument marking victory over the Nazis in World 
War II. Ile was surrounded by hundreds of well-wish­ers at sunnv Victory Square, Belar-us. then a republic in the Soviet Union. was occupird by the Germans and suffcrrd heavily as a major battle­ground between the Nazis and the Hed Army.

be comp.;lled to react harshly if Taiwan acquires Aegis warships. Taiwan views its request as a test of 
U.S. support in the face of China's continuing buildup of offensive missiles. 
China regards Taiwan as Chinese territory, separated by civil war. The United States has a "one China" pol­icy, but under the Taiwan Helations Act of 1979 it is obligated to ensure a "suffi­cient" defense for Taiwan. 
The Clinton administration is divided over the weapons sales. The Pentagon believes they are justified for Taiwan's self-defense but the White House and State Department worry more about provoking China. Virtually all international arms sales have political implications, but this one is Pspecially political because of the growing belief in Congress that China is bent on regaining control of Taiwan at any cost. 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Friday 
he could not discuss the sub­s tan er of the U.S.-Taiwan talks.

Report: Dead's parts used for profit 
Associated Pres; 
SANTA ANA. Calif. 

Donawd human rf'!!llains am proe1:ss1\d into nwdiral products that gPncraiP hundrnds of mil­lions or dollars for U.S. compa­niPs dospiW laws barring profit from body parts. Thi' Orange County Hc·gish\r rpportnd Sunday. 
,\llh()Ugh grinving ramili1\s am told thal lh(• donations am a gift or lifo. llw rwwspapnr liiund that material harvested from the dead fuels an industry that is expected to have $1 billion in revenues by 2003. 
"I thought I was donating to a nonprofit. I didn't know I was lin­ing someorrn 's pocket," said Sandra Shadwick, whoso broth­er's remains were given to a Los Angeles tissue bank. "It makes mo angry. It makes me appalled. If it's nol illegal, it ought to be." 
ThP National Organ Transplant Acl of 1984 banned profits from the sale of tissue, but companies and nonprofit tissue banks are allowed to charge reasonable fees to handle and process lhe parts. The law docs nol define a reason­able chargf~. 

"The law has mwcr been tested in court. Nobody has ever decided what is selling and what isn't," said Jeanne Mowe, executive director of the Am~ril;an Association of TissuP Banks. 
Nonprofit tissue banks may obtain body parts useful for up to I00 patients from a single cadav­er. The parts are then sold to companies that make products used by doctors and dentists, and the banks and businesses share revenues. 
Survivors urged to donate usu­ally are told about vital organs, su<'.h as hearts or kidneys, but most or the products derived from tlw doad are far from lifesaving: Cadaver skin may be used to puff up the lips of modols. ,rnlargc pcnisfls or smooth out wrinkles, the newspaper said. 
A singlr. body can provide matPrial that is worth up to $34,000 for nonprofit tissue banks. including skin, tendons, heart valvPs, veins and corneas that an: then made available to doctors and hospitals for up to S110.000. 
With bone taken from tlrn same body, a cadaver can be worth $220.000. 
"People who donate havA no idAa tissue is being processed into products that p11r gram or per ounre an' in the price range of diamonds," said ,\rthur Caplan, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics. 
ISRAEL 

Battle could spark as Israelis depart 
Associa'ted Press 
.JERUSALEM 

Attacks on Israel after it withdraws from Lebanon 
could lead to war between Israel and Syria, a senior 
Israeli def'rrnse official warrwd Sunday. 
If Syria permits or encourages Lebanese gunrrillas to 
continue their attacks on Israeli troops along the bor­
der after the pullout, promised by July, Israel will have 
to "apply levers to put prossurn on the Syrians them­
sfllves. not just on thAir indirnct intnrosts in Lebanon," 
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said. 
The rosult "could be a military confrontation in 
LPhanon." Sneh told a gathering ol' his Labor party in a 
Tel Aviv suburb. "In this confrontation we will ... have 
to make our military superiority clear oncfl again," ho 
sairl. 

Such spokesman llillAl rartouk rnleased Sneh's 
statements to Tho Associated Press. 
Israel has occupied a strip of land in south Lebanon 
for the past 18 years to protoc:t its northern bordor 
against guerrilla attacks. 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas arc fighting to 
oust thn Israeli forces. Israel says Syria, the rnal power 
in Lebanon, uses Israeli casualties tlwrn to pressure 
Israel to rel.urn the Golan Ileights, captured from Syria 
in tlrn 1967 Miclnast War. 
In the past, Israel's air force bombed Lobanese power stations, bridges and other key targets in response to fatal llezbollah attacks. These are the indirect Syrian interests to which Sneh referred ­over a million Syrian workers are employed in Lebanon, and the destruction of the infrastructure was perceivfld by Israel as a blow to Syria's economic interests. 
Sneh did not explain what he meant by "Iev(H"S to put pressure on tlrn Syrians themselves." Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down in .January and do not appear likely to resume anytime soon. 
Sneh said a military confrontation with Syria in which Israel demonstrated superiority could lead to a renewal of pP.ace talks with different opening condi­tions -apparently more advantageous for Israel.

Clinton gives phones to U.S. Indian tribes 
Associated Press 

PALO ALTO, Calif. 
To speed computer access and improve telecommunica­tions for American Indians, President Clinton will announce a 
p I a n Monday to providr, basir tr,1!1­phone ser­vice for $1 a month on reserva­tions, the 


W h i t e Clinton I-louse said Sunday. 

Fed11ral Communications C:omrn.ission Chairman William Kennard. sr:heduled to join the president to make the announcement in Shiprock. N.M .. said he experts the plan to benefit 300,000 Indian households. 
"lt is disgracrd'ul that WP have a telephone system that is thP envy or the world, but basic telecommunications services are not widely enjoyed by our land's oldest people," Kennard said in a statement. 
To pay f'or the program. Kennard said he will propose adding $17 million to an existing program that under­writes phone service costs for low-income people. That amounts to a 3.5 percent increase in funding for tlrn program. Long-distanr:ii phone companies, which pay varied subsidies to states to assist low-income people. would ultimately pay the additional costs. 
Poor American Indian households already qualify for a discount, but Clinton administration officials said the cost is still too high for many. Nearly one-third of all Indians live in poverty, com­pared with 13 percent of the 
U.S. population. 

Only 22 percent of Navajo Reservation households ha~e a phone according to the 1990 census. Nationwide, the figure is an estimated 56 per­cent for Indian reservation households but 94 percent for the population as a whole.

"With a high lrwel of poverty and geographir:al isolation, American Indians are the ethnic group most likely to be caught on tlrn wrong side of the digital divide," said Josrph C' de Baca. executive director of the Ameriran Indian Science and Technology Edur.ation Consortium. 
Microsoft also will give $60.000 to New Mexico Highlands University to implement training pro­grams and act as a men­toring institution for the tribal rolleges.

On thu same day, Student Activities director Joe Cassidy put the Progressive Student J\lliance on probation f'or leaflet­tiug without a 1'lcrmit. J\s a result. the dub rnn now be shut down if another transgrr-ssion, even a minor one, occurs, and leaders say lhey plan to quiet its activity. 
Thr University has madr. some stridr.s in its snrvices for gays and lesbians on 
because the club forgot to tell Bill Kirk that it would have four peo­plP distributing pamphlets outside the Joyce Center during Junior Parents Weekend. Probation, in this caso, seems to serve not jnst as a punishment but as a silencer. 
These actions follow a path that has been trod before. Two years ago, the Women's H(\source Center was placed on probation for making available Planned Parenthood literature. Last February, the University watched silent­ly as studunts rallied and fasted to sup­

port adding sr>xual ori1mtation to tlw 
non-discrimination clausn. Then the 
Universitv announced that the Board of 
Pellows had already decided not to 
include the amendment, in a sP.crnt early Docembf!r meeting. 
To its crndit, Notre Dame maintains an open speakers policy that allows parti­sans of all stripes to addrnss students on campus.Although demonstrations against University policy do occur from time to time, the overall atmosphere is one of repression. 
J\nd last week serves as a new rr.minder of that atrnusphore. 
Administrators can cP.rtainly argue that, taken case-by-case, denying OUTreach and punishing the PSA wore justi!ied; but taken in the view of history. thosr> actions point to a disturbing trend. 
Pree speech is merely conditional under the Golden Dome.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
IF I GET FIRED ONE MORE TIME 


"The worsl lhing that can be said about
I CAN RETIRE. 

pornography is that it leads not to ·anti­social' acts but to the reading ofmore pornography." 

Gore Vidal author 
Observer. 
However, l read that article, and l had a question. My question is this: How, exactly, does one "register" a demon­stration? In my limited existence, I've never heard of that particular concept. so I'm looking to the University to enlighten me. 
I mean because (and I'm just wonder­ing here) in ordinary parlance, people usually demonstrate against something or someone, hoping that the aforemen­tioned something or someone will change its policies in the way that the demonstrators desire. In this case, the PSA was effectively demonstrating against the University because of its sweatshop policies, and passing out fliers to those who might have some in11uence on the institution. 
And the University wanted them to register" 
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but usually when someone registers, they're effec­tively asking for permission to do what­ever it is they are registering to do. In the case of a demonstration. this might possibly cause some dilliculty. 
I mean. just imagine if Rosa Parks had decided to "register" her protest at City !Iall (or wherever it is that they register demonstrations). 
PARKS: !Ji. I've come to n~gister. 

Because, you see. I'm planning on not giving up my seat to whites tomorrow afternoon in protest of the segregation system. Now, where can l rngister to do that'? 
CITY HALL: Oh, come on in. Sit down, and fill out this form. Write down what you're going to be protesting against, and how and where. 
PARKS: Ok, thanks. 
CITY 1-IJ\LL: And we'll be around tomorrow to arrest you. Have a nice day, and thanks for registering your demon­stration against us first! If you have any suggestions on how we can make the demonstration registration proc(!SS any better, please write us from jail. 
PARKS: Sure. 
Or, say that those folks who demon­strated against the draft in the Vietnam War decided to haul themselves ovff to a government ollice to register. This might, possibly, have affected their demonstration, them might not have been one, because they might all havi'i been stopped from having the protest.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Abortion is not the answer for selfish 1nconven1ences 

For thP first time that I can wmember. I agwe completely with the views expressed in an lnsidn Column. Dustin Ferrell's piecP, "The right to choosn facts."(April 11) giws an adequate portrayal of how sel!ish snnm would-be moth­ers are when they claim to be "sparing a child from a life of hardship" by having an abortion. 
it is probably correct that some ,.hildren truly would have terribh~ lives if they wPrP allO\-rnd to liV<', especially if they would have some terminal disPasc or grow up in a homeless shPlter. Bowevnr. a pregnant woman (or girl) should not just choose to havr an abortion because she believes she eannot adm1uatdy cam for lwr child. ShP is unable to know that her own life. and thernf'orn lllf' life of her child. will not improve in tbe fulurn. She cannot just assume that the child will not be able overconrn obstacles and become a successful pcrs011. Shouldn't slw give tlrn unborn child a chance? 
i\ly mother became pregnant with me wlrnn she was 18. She was enrolled in college, and she thought she was in love with this guy who was live years older than she. When he learned that she was pregnant, he demanded for lrnr lo have an abortion. She lnitially agreed and called for an appointment. She changed her mind. but then changed it again and made another appointment. /\ 1'11w days bdore the scheduled abortion, she finally decided that her child noeded tho opportunity to live. and she informed him of'her choicn. lie showl'd up al her lirsl appointment with her doctor, and then she never saw him again. She had to drnp out of school and go back home to live wilh her parents. 
lier parrnts gave lwr a lot of troublr. She had "ruinnd tlw family's reputation," and I'm sun• she was embarrassed and ashamed. But she was married almost four years later, and her husband adopted me. 
I know it wasn't an easy decision for her. I can just imagine how hard it was for lwr to go honw and tPII lrnr parents. She has probably wished many limes that she could have graduated from college and gotten a br.tter job. I have no idea how difficult it was for her to tell me all llrn details wlrnn I asked; lo know what my ma! dad was like. or how hard it is for her to look at me and see sirniiariti11s to the man who left her. I know that keeping me may have bePn an inconvn­ni1mce for her. but I know (because she has told me) that she has 1wver regrl'tted choosing not to have an abortion. 
Slw did not regret kneping me while slrn heard me thank her in my high school valedictory address. and she did not regret her decision when she found out that I'd gottm1 aci:eptPd here and that I'd received several scholarships to covnr most of' tlrn costs. Dnspite tlrn problems she faced, she has bncn able lo provide me with suf'ficienl care. and I feel that I have been quite successful so f'ar. 
Sim could have aborted me and left the clinic with a dean slatc (though maybe a nagging conscience). but she didn't. She rnnsidernd my life morr. important than her own. She didn't want to think, "I wonder what she would have Jook!!d like, accomplished, etc," so she took the far more difficult and unscllish roul1L 
Just bf1causc someone thinks that her life and her unborn child's life will be horrible ancl worthless doesn't mean that sh11 should tcrminatB the child·s life. Slw has no way of knowing what tlie futur!\ Ii olds. Abortion is not the answer fur µoople worrying about pnssimistic, unverified predictions or selfish inconve­niPnces.

Rape dialogue facilitates awareness on campus 
Ilere is a hopefully sonrnwhat nducawd opinion on rapP. In rnspons<' lo .loshua Warner's kttPr (April 13), whil11 I agree that clisrnssing any point beyond its usPf'ul­ncss is harmful, I'm s11 glad to sec this issue finally making th1\ papers. This topir is avoided like tlrn plagun Imm, and it's about time pnopln started to rnalizn that it's a real problem. llape doPs exist at Notrn Dame, in proportions comparabh! to all other collng1;s. 
As much as I'd like to believe that my school of'fors a pcwfoclly sal'e Pnvironnrnnl, I know this isn't the case. 01w good way lo help stop rapn is to let peopln know about il. llape is an issue about which almost everyone trnre is ignorant.

In tlw last l"r.w years, Turtle CrPek has suffr.rPd the reputation of being tlw worst of' the off-cam­pus residenci-s. 1lorror stories or dirty apartnwnts. faulty appli­ances and structural problems causP one sophomore to refer to the complex as "the ghetto of off­ramp us housing." llownver, Turtle Crl'()k dops manage to fill its apartments early Pvnry year. 
Many studPnts Pnjoy the laid back atmosplwrc of tlrn resi­denc1~s and its proximity to cam­pus. TurtlP CrP1ik is tlrn closP-st thing you can gPt to on-campus v.·hilP still !wing off-campus. Biking or walking to class will Lak11 slightly longer than your avPragP dorm-lo-DeBartolo stroll, but it is still do-able. For students without a car, Turtle Crei,k is the place to move.

ror many studonts, Culloge Park brings together many of the conveniPnC('S of the othr:r off-campus residences in one package.

Ile cites the porch as onP of' the biggest benefits. "When you have par­tic1s or barbecues, people can just hang out outside." 
College Park, located on Bulla Hoad. is also very conve­n icn lIy close to campus. Although farther than Turtle Creek, it is arguably more con­venient than Lafayette. Students could bike if they felt ambitious. but a car is more of a nr.ccssity hr.re. College Park also beats Lafayette in neigh­borhood safety. Students' reports of break-ins and crime arc minimal. 
Tlw best part about it all'' Tim rent at College Park is a vnry rnasonable $915 per month that students can rhoosP to split between two,

best bang for tlwir buck. "We have 
mon• spacP than thny do at 
f.afayeltn or Colloge Park, but for 
around Uw same price [per person]" 
junior Chris Gorski said. 
Spacn isn't thn only thing Castle 
Point offers. A Castle Point lease 
gets studPnts accPss to basketball, 
tennis and bnarh vollevlmll courts, a 
jacuzzi and a pool (1tlthough the 
pool is located at another site.) 
Seems likP luxury college living'? 
This is why Castle Point is populated 
with manv 11011-Notro Dame resi­
dents. incl~ding many families. 
Herein lies Lim dovmside to choos­ing Castle Point. Stucl(mts express annoyance at having to liµtoe around adults and children. Late ·night noise is frowned upon. which rnnans no parties. If a studPnt does hav<' a party it must bo fully con­tained \•vithin his or her housP -in 
other words: small. 
Castin Point also has limited 
choices for student-;. There an' dou­
hlrs and sing!Ps availablP. Doubles

anwnities. Sonrn doubles can fit

Tlll' rc·nlal process is gp,u-ed more 
tcrwards !lw gcnnral public than col­
!Pgn stucl<'nts. The good part about 
this is the flPxibilitv of leases (resi­
dc•nts choose betwe'cm threP-, six-ur 
nine-month leases). and the avail­
ability ofapnrtnwnb. 
Although students must plan three or four people. Because of this, it is important to get one's name on a waiting list as soon as possible, just like at Lafayette and Turtle Creek. 
\'Vith all those advantages, are there any downsides to College Park? Because all of the apartments are only two bedrooms, students end up sharing a room, often defeating the purpose of moving off-cam­pus. Many students want their privacy and space when they arc paying rent each month. 
Overall, College Park seems to be tlrn best overall value for college students. It has increased in popularity over recent years, with apartments in higher demand and parties more prevalent. This increase in partying probably has to do with the increased number ol' 
alwad to an extnnt, Castle Point does not have the long waiting lists that many othor places have. 
Some students also see the loca­tion of Castle Point as a downside. The drive from Cloveland Avenue is nut long, but in comparison to College Park or Turtle Creek, can seem like a hikr. Biking or walking is definitely out of the question. 
Overall, Castle Point is 


quiet atmospherP makc~s studying a groat dnal easier as well. Though Gorski said. "It's becoming a lot morn popular."

not your typical college apart­ment. The entire complex is enclosed, and with a security guard, is more like some rich, suburban, gated neighbor­hood than a crappy college apartment. Students who choose to live herP gpt a much quieter, laid-back <'xpe­rience with manv added prirk·s.

males moving to College Park. Because tlrn apartments am more aesthetically pleasing than other places (an impor­tant bonus to many females, to stereotype for a moment), CollegP Park has usually been dominated by girls. This ratio seems to be changing, howev­er. 
"College Park is definitely getting cooler," said senior HA Elizabeth Brown, who has made a point to visit many dif­foront off-campus residences. 
It seems that many students share her sentinrnnts. Overall. College Park does not have tlw wild party reputation of Lafayetto, but is increasing steadily in the social scene. Peace and quiet are not guar­
anteed here, but a  nice placci  
with  a  big porch  is  a  sure  
thing.

his father propping him up as an infant every Saturday in front of the tcl<wision to watch the Irish. 
One game in partir.ular stands out in his mind, when in the rnid-l 970s. he was watching an Irish game with his grandfather. who was a Notre Dame alum, and his uncle. 
"My uncle wanted to r.hange the channel at halftime," Griffin said. "There were a bunch of other college games on. My grandfather said to my uncl0, 'Brurc, there's only one team wn watrh in this house.' I've been wanting to write to the writer of "Uudy" and tell them that it actually happened to me." 
Though he never wrote the let­ter to the "Hudy" writers. Gril'fin continur,s to faithfully follow the Irish. But now, instead of only watching them on TV. Griffin has also been ablf: to attend sev­0rnl gamfls in thA past few years. Included among these was the 199S game against Navy. the first time Griffin ever st0ppr,d foot in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"It was like six degre,~s," Griffin said. "Tim Wfwk before was Halloween. I knew at half­time that the lines were long so l told my brotlrnr lo bring some candy. At hall'time, he gave me a randy bar and it was frozen solid. That's how cold it was here. It was almost 20 years to the day when my father and his father went to a game here. It put a lump in my throat." 
The emotion felt that day also was on display this weekend. On more than one occasion. Grillin took time out to reflect on where he's been and the opportunities he's had. 
"Most guys don't get a chance to come out here and se0 a big­time program like Notre Dame 'Tm just grateful that coaclrns like Bob Davie are taking tlrnir time out to hdp us." 

Though he'll probably nevr.r be a coar.h here at Notrc Dame, Grif'lin knows that the realm of roar.bing goes far beyond the on­field performance. 
"I know personally I'm going to have to come to a fork in the road soon where I'm going lo have to decide," Griffin said. "II' I r.an't get into a big-time pro­gram. I'm going to have to acer.pt it and stay at the high school level, which is great. I foci likr. I'm giving back to the com­munity and hopefully making a difference." 
NOTES: 
. 
Bob Davie mentioned Sfwer­al players who have been pl0as­ant surpriSf!S this spring includ­ing quartf'rback Gary Godsey. cornerbark Shane Walton and off<msive tackle Brennan Curtin. According t.o Daviri, Godsny, who is down to 240 pounds, is now a legitimate number two quartnr­back. 

. 
Gerome Sapp has benn moved from free safety to strong safety. lie will compete with Hon Israel for the starting position. 

. 
Sapp and running back Terrance Howard both sat out Saturday's practice due to ham­string injuries. 

. 
Bunning back Julius Jones was excused from Saturday's practir.e 30 minutes early to catch a flight home. His brother Thomas was drafted seventh in this weekend's NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals. 

. 
Only 49 scholarship players are currently practicing with the team due to an assortment of injuries.

Determined not to let this one get away, Notre Damr. came out after halftime and continued where it left off in tlrn first quar­ter. Steve Bishko started the Irish run with a goal just threr, minutes into the third quarter. Bishko's scores wern quickly fol­lowed by goals from .Ion Harvey and Devin Hvan. 
Army put ·one on the board in

" T h e 
defense was the key to our win," 
said Harvev, who finished with two goals·. "Guys like Mike Adams and Kirk IHowell rnally stepped it up and were the rea­son why we won." 
"Thr, of'fonse finished a little better in the second half'," Harvev said. "Oul· defense is· playing wry well, so as long as the n!Tense does their job we will win t!w game." 

This was Notre Damr's third straight victory after lossP-s to Lovola and llofstra. Thc 13th­ranked Irish have been improv­ing every week since then and have posted wins over Ohio State, Butler and now Armv. 
"Basicallv. Glatzel an·d our whole offonse have been step­ping it up lately and our defense has always br.rm pl&ying-tough," Dave Ulrich said,
