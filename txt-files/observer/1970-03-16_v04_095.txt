Co-education at Notre Dame


ENROLL

In an attempt to give parents


HERE 
an insight into the various as­pects of "Coeducation and Notre Dame" a panel discussion was presented Saturday, March 14 at the Center for Continuing

THIS 
Education. Presented by the Junior Parent's Weekend Com­mittee, the event was attended by approximately ISO people. 
The panel, with the exception of Dr. Peter Grande, Admissions Director, was made up entirely of Notre Dame-St. Mary's stu­dents. Tom Oliveri served as moderator. Representing the divergent views were Dee Bacon and John McDougall, Anti­Coeducation; Sheilagh Cronin and Ian Pearson, Pro-Coeduca­tion. 
Panel moderator Tom Oliveri began the discussion by presen­ting a brief outline to the parents of the various steps towards coeducation which are already being studied. At the conclusion of his opening remarks, Oliveri turned the program over to Dee Bacon and the Anti-Coeducation forces. 
Miss Bacon began by attack­ing the belief that "separation of the sexes on an educational level is obsolete." She contended that while the multiversity has a definite place in modern society, the small secular college must be maintained for "individuals who cannot receive the integral education they need at a large multiversity." Moreover, she stated that as a student at St. Mary's and the experiments in coeducation in the past three years, she has been intimidated the presence of boys in her classes. Miss Bacon stated that from a woman's point of view, a very important argument against coeducation would be the competition forced on the coed, and the resultant loss of

found itself at odds with the implementation· of the basic rights of the individual into its system, but Shannon stated that the Universal meeting of bis­hops, Vatican II, has indicated that this implementation must occur. 
Through Pope John XXIII and his calling of the Council, the Catholic Church has been forced into a great dialogue with the world it exists in he said. The Council not only opened a window to let a breath of fresh air into the Church, said Shan­non, but also opened a window which allowed the Church to look out into the world and life. 
He cited examples of the di­versity between the Church's di­rective especially Humanae Vitae, and the actions of its members which he said is con­fusing and alienating many of its'l members. 
The solutions to these pro­
blems are being implemented in 
many areas today, and the Church is moving towards a renewal. This renewal is slow, not always right, but necessary he claimed. 
He cited the National Pastoral Council of the Netherlands, the National Federation of Priest's Council and The Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary as movements that will forward the Church's progress. 
Dr. Shannon praised the con­
temporary scholars of today's Church as one of the most im­portant aspe<.:ts of Church reform. There is hope and a de­finite future for the Catholic Church in the world, ht added, through work and cooperation 
of the hierarchy and the lay Church. 
Dr. Shannon in response to an audience question said Catholic secondary and higher education is necessary not only for Cathol­ics but also for the n1tion in general. He actded that Notre Dame was one of the most im­portant Catholic educational institutions.

The University Forum 
The University Forum will meet tomorrow for a second attempt at trying to bridge the communications gap at Notre Dame. 
Its first meeting last month was very poorly planned. The time allotted for discussion was too short. A sense of frustration overcame the members of the Forum as well as the students in attendance as thorough discussion of the issue before them was not held since they all knew the conversation would be cut off when the hour for adjournment was reached. 
The first session of any new group is usually clouded with difficulties that arise because goals have not been outlined nor procedures designated. The poor plannin5 of last month's meeting should be cleared up by the fact that the Forum now has a chairman-Professor Donald Sneigowski of the English department. The outline for the topics to be discussed has already been drawn up. 
TI1e procedure as outlined contains two basic faults. First, time should be alloted at tomorrow's meeting for discussion of the Forum itself. There was some discussion about its function before the Forum was set up. It was done however, by the same people who would eventually ahve to sit on the board-the student leaders, administrators, and other groups represented. They probably all do not have a clear vision of the purpose of the Forum. Maybe they all have talked about it among themselves. But if the Forum is to be a vehicle of communication the people with which it should be communicating should play a role in outlining its direction. 
The students and other members of the community that attend tomorrow's meeting should be asked their opinion about the role of the Forum. TI1e group as a whole should discuss whether or not they think the Forum will be effective. Many of the students who attended the first session of the Forum came away disillusioned. They had gone to the meeting looking for something which they felt was not acheived. lt would be wise for the Forum to handle questions about its function immediately. In order to be effective the community as a whole should have a clear understanding of the purpose of the Forum. 
A look at the schedule reveals that time limits have been set on the discussion of the items on the agenda. Although every organization has to limit its operations somehow in order to be effective we feel that the Forum will only be hurting itself if it sticks to rigid time schedules. Sufficient time must be alloted to allow for penetrating and thoughful evaluations of problems and situations. 
The confusion over the role of the Forum appears here too as present plans are designed to limit the number of questions that students can ask the speakers at the sessions. If the Forum's purposd is communication then it is necessary to insure that the people who are making presentations will answer all questions put to them. 
Tomorrow's agenda calls for the consideration of a wide variety of problems including Student Government, the Nutting-for-President Campaign, the University Arts Council, the Universities Priorities, Hall Life, and Campus Ministry. It is hard to believe that the Forum will be able to cover all of these important fields in the meeting tomorrow. The idea is to pick one of the issues to use as a focal point for the Forum's last meeting in April. 
The Forum must determine its procedures and outline a direction for 
itself. It must limit the number of issues that it will deal with so that it can 
effectively handle all the questions and comments offered by members of 
the community.

Of course it was your mother who wrote all those nasty thingsabout your hair. 
Rich Smith 


On Moose's theory· 
Premise: hippies, protestors, and "pinkos" are in reahty just restless adolescents who, lacking any other outlet for their energies, demonstrate against the first convenient cause that presents itself. Therefore, give these long-haired "peace freaks" a resplendent sports palace in which they can exhaust their overflowing energy and all will be well, all those nasty, nagging problems will disappear. 
Mr. Krause was asked about the new Athletic and Convocation Center. He responded by saying that it was a beautiful building. He then made the remark that by providing the students with :Hhletic outlet for their energies, it was hoped that demonstrations w:>uld be avoided and we (the students) would have less of an "anti-" attitude toward things. 
This was the basic ·message I got from Notre Dame's athletic director Edward (Moose) Krause's comments during a half-time interview in the Notre Dame-Kentucky basketball game last week. 
The idea that the many problems afflicting our society can be deracinated through the ostrich-like ploy of burying our heads -our minds or consciousness -in a handball court or a television is not indigenous to this campus or the college scene. Rather, this notion pervades our entire nation, and as our problems grow with each passing year, so also grows our tendency to put these problems out of our mind by spending more time in our many gymn:1siums, building our bodies while two billion people elsewhere go without food, clothing, or shelter. 
Our esteemed President Nixon has only added to this national psychosis through sending greetings and congratulations to star athletic players and attending major sporting events. It seems that the President sees a distinct political advantage in being idt,ntified with America's great pastimes. 
While I am not suggesting that President Nixon devote all of his time to an assiduous labor of Jove to save the starving masst,g, I ·do maintain that the present amount of time, money, and energy spent in athletic endeavors is not in consonance with the reality of the present world situation. Not that our President should totally refrain totally from enjoying any football games or from relaymg his messages of good will to personalities in the world of sports. President Nixon, I am sure( labors under an extremely heavy work load and most certainly needs some relaxation. But nonetheless, by contributing to our national frenzy of escaping our many problems by engaging in sports activities, he is doing a disservice to the nation he was elected to serve of incomparable magnitude. 
Another problem brought into focus by Mr. Krause's comments is that of the "jock" image of Notre Dame. If this institution is ever to become a great university as Father Hesburgh has envisioned, the attitude of people "outside" the campus, which has Notre Dame in the category of a football school, must be changed. 
Undoubtedly, Mr. Krause has a sincere faith in the short-haired non-demonstrating, "silent majority" of students. But, it seems to me that it is extremely dangerous for him, as a representative of the University, to identify with the "right-wing" "red-white-and-blue" faction. 
I do not advocate any move similar to the Sell Sacred Heart Church and Use the Money to Aid the Poor movement. I fully recognize the need for recreation, especially in this day of modern machine-technology, when the pressure on students increases with 
each year. Also, I recognize that collegiate athletics is not devoid of redeeming values. The three hundred and fifty thousand dollars which·Notre Dame has received from the Cotton Bowl game will go to the education of students who, under normal circumstances, would never be able to receive a college education. However, the merger of right wing politics and competitive athletics is frightening. The fraternity "jocks" battling the "long hairs is a symbol of America's demise -another sting of th·~ lethal polarization that our government seems to be encouraging. There are some problems that just are not going to fade away as soon as we tune in the Superbowl or put on our handball gl oves.

Editor: 
As a junior now, I must admit that I have become disillusioned with Notre Dame, especially in regard to the stifling all male environment that prevails here. Before returning for the fall semester this year, I am sure that most of us read about "coeduca­tion" at Notre Dame. Anyone who has lived here this year and 
even participated in the broaden­ed co-ex program (the supposed step toward greater unity bet­ween Notre Dame and St. Mary's) must realize how inade­quate the present program for coeducation is. With the condi­tions as they are now, I ask in all sincerity: Isn't it time that we take a decisive step forward on

Letter to the Editor 
this issue? 

I realize that there are many considerations that have to be brought to bear on the problem of coeducation, but I think that the personal consideration of each student's total growth and development is most important. 
My feeling is that Notre Dame a Bows only for the limited growth of its students. Many of the students mature spiritually and intellectually during his four years here, but I find that after one has developed up to a certain point that this place thwarts your branching out onto yourself. 
I certainly would maintain that each man should have the opportunity to seek a greater self-realization through an in­ward search and struggle, but I also believe that upon arriving at 
this greater personal conscious­
ness  there  should  be  an  
environment  in  which  one  has  
the  chance  of  freely  giving  

himself to another. I would not demean the significance of the male-to-male friendships that are made at Notre Dame, but for the emergence of a totally educated and sensitive person I think that only an administration which is oblivious or even unconcerned with the welfare of its students can consistently stand for the denial of ~ · environment which provides h  the opportunities of personal growth involved in truly healthy male-to-female re­lationships. 
The point which our Roman collared bureaucrats must be made to realize is that the Notre Dame student does not narrowly define a girl as an object of

sexual gratification. Admittedly, our essentially stale segregated environment often makes this appear to be the case, but if one were to probe the feelings of the student in regard to their out­look upon women, I think it would be discovered that, in general, the students aspire for a total relationship with a girl, that is, a relationship that is not based solely upon sex. I think it is time that this university made its policies in light. of the aspirations of its students. 
The Notre Dame students who graduate from here scarred both emotionally and psycholog­ically are the price we are now paying for maintaining the status quo position on coeducation. On the basis of this particular consideration alone, the direc-

tion of Notre Dame should be clearly seen to be immediate conversion to a vibrant coeduca­tional environment. I would like to add that, from my point of view this does not mean a grad~al increase in the ratio between Notre Dame and St. Mary's to 3 to 1 over the span of the next seven years. 
As is constantly pointed out to the student body by the: administration there are certain. obstacles to change which must be confronted if one i5 to be realistic about it. One of these is. the problem of St. Mary's identity. I question whether there is any validity to this idea of St. Mary's identity, and consequently whether it should stand as an obstruction to a co-ed Notre Dame. 
Most of the girls that I have known confess that they chose St. Mary's primarily becmse of its proximity to Notre Dame. Even if academic reasons loomed as the principal concern for a girl in her choice of St. Mary's, it seems that the coalesc~nce of both the facilities and personnel of Notre Dame and St. Mary's could only result in a better academic program. Furthermore, I think that the significant attrition rate at St. Mary's leads one to conclude that the girls' sense of identity with their school, if this phenJmenon exists at all, is not too strong. 
It seems to me that the most 
avid supporters of St. Mary's 
identity are probably a :;egment 
of her faculty members who., 
lacking the necessary degrees, 
might find their jobs in jeopardy 
in the event of the assimilation 
of the two schools into one. In 
this case, the issue of St. Mary's. 
identity boils down to upholding 
the interests of the few at the 
expense of the community as a 
whole. 
The financial implications of a 
change to coeducation at Notre 
Dame would seem to be the 
foremost complication in the 
mind of one who seriously 
considers this possibility. The 
crucial consideration in regard to 
the financial aspects of coeduca­
tion is garnering the support of 
the alumni of both schools for 
this change. Quite possibly, the 
maintenance of the tradition of 
segregated education and the 
merits attributed to this form of 
education would assume priority 
for the alumni. 
However, the pojnt that I 
would like to make is that 
traditions are formulated to 
fulfill the needs and wants of the 
community which they a~·fect. If 
what I have said previously has 
any substance to it, it would 
appear that new values are 
necessitating the evolu lion of 
new traditions. Traditions are 
not articulated to keep the 
community in enslavement to 
them, but, since they supposedly 
exist for the benefit of the 
people of the community res­
ponsible for them, they should 
correspond to the things that 
that community holds most 
dear, in this case, a more total 
coeducational experience. 
In the final analysis, it .lppears 
that the barriers to the change 
for coeducation are inccmrnen­
surable to the need for this 
change. As I see it, immediate 
action should be taken to give a 
new spirit and new direction to 
Notre Dame. 
Yours hopeful in change,

Chuck Darst, who tore up his·

for his action. He said that it was

contrary to both Christian ideals 
and the American ideal of free 
choice. 
lie says that the status of Conscientious Objector is a very difficult one to obtain, and when you do obtain one, you still have not solved anything: According to Darst, this is still endorsing the system, and that it is in fact, just another protection deferment under the law, as is that of the student tlefermen t. 
Darst says that he has the "obligation as an American, as a Catholic, and as a human, to

Teams of poli..:e and firemen methodically sifting by hand through the ruins of the elegant feder.il house since the explosion March 6 also have found about five dozen sticks of dynamite, several homemade bombs and a cache of studnet identification cards. 
The only victim definitely identified was Theodore Gold, 23, a leader of the 1968 Colum­bia University student uprising and member of the revolution­ary Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Socie­tY. 
Newsweek magazine reported yesterday that about a dozen young radicals were in the house plotting to bo111b Columbia Uni­versity and other buildings when the dynamite exploded. News­week said the group had been drifting into New York for weeks from Boston, Chicago and 

elsewhere to set off the bombs in order to back up their de­mands that Columbia arrange bail for Black Panthers now on trial in New York in a bomb plot. 
It said that at the time of the blast Gold was on the parlor floor' working on a book about the. origins of the SDS. Others were. "relaxing with rock music and marijuana" while in the sub­basement two young women were assembling bombs when the accident occurred. 
Sources in the SDS and Weathermen said they believed a woman's torso recovered three days after the blasts was that of Mrs. Patricia Swinton, 22, who may have been in the house with her still missing 3 year old son Adam. She has been sought since last fall in connection with a wave of bombings of govern­ment and corporate offices in New York. The third body, found Saturday was an unidenti­fied male torso.

(UPI) -· The group that spon­

plans to use the law and abuse 
the law this week to create 
havoc at draft boards in at least 
70 U.S. cities. 
For the first time since pro­

became nationally coordinated, 
the New Mobilization Commit­

civil disobedience. 
The plan of the New Mobe is

The activities tomorrow will 

consist of classroom discussions 
among instructors and students. 
Schoaf suggested that the rea­

should be considered "within 
the context of the discipline." 
The following day, Wednes­

day, "We Won't Go" petitions 
will be circulated in the dining

to Congressman John Brademas 
and asked to be entered in the 
Congressional Record. Schoaf expressed hope that these peti­tions might influence Congress in the formulation of its future draft legislation.

"Civil disobedience means
