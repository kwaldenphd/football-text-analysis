Scaffolding brought down four weeks early 
Fair weather hastens Dome's regilding 
28.9 karat gold leaf is need­ed to cover the entire Dome, the fragile process, done completely by hand, can only be accomplished in wind­free, dry conditions. The chance that bad weather could prevent the Dome from being finished bef'ore its stat­ed Oct. 1 frost deadline pro­vided the University's initial reasoning for erecting scaf­folding before commence­ment. 
"The interesting thing is that the scaffolding never actually touches the Dome," Afl'leck-Graves said. "So it sways about four inches and when the wind blows it sways up to 12 inches. But this happened to be an absolutely perfect summHr. ThH weather was exception-

New administration acting early 

By MARY KATE MALONE News Writer 
Following a spring of intense dHbate over the tim­ing of the regilding of the Golden Dome, the Notre Dame landmark's facelift was completed four weeks ahead of schedule this summer thanks to ideal weather con­ditions, officials said. 
The $300,000 regilding procnss -whose Dome-hid­ing scaffolding provoked backlash last March from members of the Class of 2005 who feared the landmark would not be visible in their graduation photos -was . highly dependent upon the weather, Executive Vice

A Saint Mary's student reported that she was sexually assaulted on campus by a new acquaintance early Saturday morning, police and College officials said.

Good advice 
not just for 


freshmen 

Good advice is something we all need in our lives, especially during times of change. Most likely if you are reading this article, you are finding that you are facing a time of transition -­
Kelly Meehan 

and I am not just 
talking about 
freshmen. News 
At some point Production in our lives we 
Editor 

have all received adviCe about col­lege -whether it be from our seemingly paranoid parents warn­ing us of the dangers of partying or from campus security threatening us with tickets for improper park­ing -and it is all up to us to take the information to heart. 
I would like to offer you a piece of advice that you may have never heard before. However, I guarantee it will make your life and the lives of others much better. This advice is to simply be considerate of other people's pet peeves. 
I know, this may sound a bit strange or maybe even obvious at first, but there are a few things I would like to point out. 
You are now living among thou­sands of other students and coming in close contact with them on a daily basis. It is important to take some of your everyday actions into consideration. 
For ex!lmple, do you really think the girl in front of you appreciates the fact that you have decided to tap the back leg of her desk with your foot for the entire duration of calc class? 
Or how do you think your friends really feel about your "hilarious" "Baby Got Back" techno remix ringtone that blares several times a day? I doubt they are thinking it is very funny anymore. 
Maybe you could consider your roommates when you decide to hit snooze four times at 8 a.m because you really do not want to shower before class anyway. 
And I know everyone enjoys the occasionally leisurely walk -how­ever, you might want to pick up the pace when you are walking on a main sidewalk two minutes before class starts. Everyone has some­where to go, so save that slow stroll for a Sunday afternoon. 
Perhaps you have complete con­trol of your feet, only set a simple ring tone on your cell phone, and are a fast walker at all times. Still, take some time today to see if there is something you can change to make others' lives a little easier. 
So as you are meeting new friends in these next few weeks and are asking the same cliche questions, such as "Where are you from?" and "Do you call it pop or soda?" stop and ask, "So, what are your pet peeves?" It is a great con­versation starter that can lead to lasting, peaceful relationships.

Escaped peacock returns home safely after summer 
CHICHESTER, N.H. ­Daryl the escaped peacock had a magical summer. He scavenged for bugs and raid­ed gardens, roaming freely, while his mate, Darla the peahen, nested at home. But all good things come to an end. 
Daryl was caught last week, four months after he escaped (probably frightened by a coyote) and 10 miles from home. 
Over the summer, Daryl dodged cars on Route 4, was sighted numerous times but always eluded capture. In the end, he was caught with 

patio furniture and cracked com. His owner, Wendy Cassetta, is amazed by his safe return. 
"It gives me heart palpita­tions to think of how many of his lives he used up out there," said Cassetta of Chichester.

Priests 
continued from page 1 
Judith Fean. 
The two men are replacing Father Joseph Carey, also a Holy Cross priest, who minis­tered to the College for five years before announcing his retirement fro·m the position last April. 
Gordon said he was approached about the opportu­nity by his provincial superior, the person in charge of the Congregation of the Holy Cross (CSC). 
"Since the very beginning of the esc. the tradition has been that we participate in one another's apostolics," Gordon said, referring to the relation­ship between the brothers, sis­ters and priests of the CSC. For this reason, Gordon applied and accepted the position. 
Hiring two priests instead of one was a move unexpected by members of the College commu­nity. However, Fean said the choice was a good one for this year, and the men will be divid­ing the responsibilities of the position equally. 
"For this year we are very excited to have [both Rentner and Gordon]. We're going to look at how this year pans out and move from there as time goes on," Fean said. "They agreed to split up the masses and special liturgies; we have parent weekends like Sophomore Parent Weekend, Junior Moms, etc. So we'll be having a diversity of priests able to celebrate with our communi­~" . 
Fean stressed the College will continue to maintain the same Mass schedule as last year, so the same opportunities will be available to students. 
In addition to Mass, confes­sion and Eucharistic admira­tion, Carey's duties on campus included leading a Bible study session called "Breaking Open the Word," which helped pre­pare students for the upcoming liturgy, and serving as campus liaison to Holy Cross and Annunciata halls. The latter tra­dition will no longer continue, Fean said. 
"Anyone from any residence hall can ask anyone in Campus Ministry to work with them in collaboration with enhancing the faith life and spiritual life in the halls," she said. 
As for the liturgy preparation Carey's Bible study provided for 
Assault 
continued from page 1 
Hemmerlein declined to com­ment on whether any evidence of rape was found during the exam. He also declined to com­ment on whether the student suffered any physical injuries during the alleged incident. 
The Saint Mary's student body was notified of the alleged incident by Director of Security Dave Chapman in an e-mail sent out Sunday at noon. In it, he said every resource was being made available to the student. The e­mail did not describe the alleged assault as a sexual assault, but Chapman sent out a second e-mail 24 hours later clarifying its nature. 
"I understand there have been some questions about the nature of the assault and I want to be very clear about what took place," Chapman students, each of the Saint Mary's campus ministers will share responsibility in leading it. 
"Our hope . . . is to enable our peer ministry, our students here, to be able to [be Eucharistic ministers, preachers and lead prayer services] because they can do that in their parishes upon gradua­tion," Fean said. 
Divvying duties may lessen the burden on the two priests, who both have full-time com­mitments to Notre Dame as well as Saint Mary's. Gordon is a professor of theology at the University, while Rentner is a student completing his doctoral dissertation in education per­sonnel. He recently moved back to the South Bend area from New York to attend Notre Dame. 
Rentner said be does not think his responsibilities as a priest at Saint Mary's and his commit­ment as a Notre Dame student will be a difficult balance to maintain. 
"I see myself as being part of the balance," he said. 
Fean said Campus Ministry staff -including another new member, Minister Regina Wilson -and the entire Saint Mary's community are excited and thankful these priests have offered their services to the College. 
"[We] look forward to how this evolves," Fean said. "That doesn't mean that some point down the road we might not have a full-time [priest]." 
The two priests are looking forward to working with the students in the upcoming year, Gordon said. 
"I was very impressed by the amount of background [each student possessed] with their faith and their level of enthusi­asm for participating in Campus Ministry," he said. 
While most students were sad to see Carey leave, they also look forward to this new begin­ning and getting to know the new ministers. 
"It's hard for someone to replace Father Joe, but I was very impressed with Father Randy," junior Rosemary Walsh said after attending Sunday's Mass. "He seems to be a great fit for Saint Mary's, and his homily was pertinent. I am look­ing forward to getting to know and spending time with Father Randy on my faith journey."

said in the second e-mail. 
Chapman then urged stu­dents to travel in groups when they go out and to be cautious with new acquaintances. 
Security on campus is not being increased in any way in response to the alleged assault, College spokeswoman Melanie McDonald said. 
"Our security is excellent, and there are all kinds of efforts in place to keep our students safe," McDonald said. 
McDonald cited call boxes scattered around campus and security escorts from parking lots as examples. Security also offers students tips on how to stay safe on the department's Web site1 she said. 
"There is always the possi­bility of something unfortunate to occur, and sometimes the students need to take some of that into their own hands," McDonald said.

She organ­ized the University of Dayton's African Literature Conference for 2002-03. As an in-residence campus minister there, she was responsible for 1,200 students along with organizing a service trip to Haiti. 
Outgoing rectors were helpful in the transition, some new rec­tors said. 
"[Former Howard rector Kathy Brannock] left great files, and everything was totally organized for me to just walk in and start right up," Oliva said. 
Many new rectors stressed service and ministry as some­thing that will be paramount to their dorm's agenda. 
"The greatest joy is the biggest challenge -ministering to youth," Vierling said. 
De Ia Torre said that although the rector position is one job, there are many roles to fill within it. 
"You must be an administra­tor, counselor, psychologist, manager, minister and parent figure," she said. "But that only scratches the surface."

The independent panni sped through the first day of its final decisions on the plan it will send to President Bush, who can aeeept it or order changes. Congress also has a ehanee to veto the plan, but has not taken that step in four pre­vious rounds of closures. 
The commission signed off on most of the Pentagon's plans to elose, shrink or expand hundreds of small and large Army and Navy facilities from coast to coast. It has yet to take up any Air Foree pro­posals, ineluding tho con­tentious question of whether the service can strip aireraft from about two dozen Air National Guard facilities across the eountry.

Baron said he has been in contact with Ann Pazello, council member of the fourth district of the city of South Bend, and Ann Carol Nash, assistant city attorney.

In the spring, after weeks of negotiation with senior repre­sentatives, Affleck-Graves ordered the scaffolding removed to the base of the Dome in time for graduation. 
Longer labor hours over the summer helped make up for the work days missed during the temporary take-down, Aflleck-Graves said. 
Now, nearly five months later, the regilding is finally complete. Additional painting and landscaping around the Main Building will be complet­ed by Sept. 9, head of business operations Jim Lyphout said. 
In late May, then-University President-elect Father John Jenkins, then-University President Father Edward Malloy and Affleck-Graves toured the top of the Dome to view the regilding process firsthand. 
"When you get up there it was amazing to see the dam­University's chief governing body. 
More of Baron's administra­tion's handiwork will be seen sooner than that in various facets of student life -from the newly purchased online textbook trading site NDBay to a men's sexual assault aware­ness group. 
Student government recently spent $5,000 to purchase NDBay, an online book-trading site previously owned and operated by recent Notre Dame graduates Chris Kelly and Aaron Wenger. 
"We hope to make it accessi­ble through AFS IDs and t9 integrate ticket share for foot­ball and basketball tickets online," Baron said. 
Like his predecessor, Adam Istvan, Baron also plans to devote a significant amount of student government's energy to improving minority rela­tions on campus. 
"We have a newly created minority affairs committee in place which allows for minori­ties to have a louder voice on policy issues," Baron said. "They will look at the diversity double count requirement and 


age," Affleck-Graves said. "It surprised me. It was cracked and discolored with blue blobs on it. Boy, when you were that close you could see it had to get done." 
The last regilding was done 17 years ago. Affleck-Graves said he hopes the latest touch­ups, including work on the Main Building itself, will last for at least 15 years. In addi­tion to the regilding, the paint was completely stripped from the tower of the Main Building -a job done far less often. 
"The tower has to have the paint taken off completely," Affleck-Graves said. "In the 70s they did a really good job of putting on a clean base. We only have to do that every 50 years and every other time we're essentially re-painting it." 
Despite the student outcry in the spring against the Dome regilding, Affleck-Graves said commencement beneath a par­tially uncovered Dome was peaceful. · 
"The amazing thing was that at commencement not one per­son spoke to me about [the re-

work on a proposal that is beneficial but not too onerous to students." 
Plans for reaching more con­crete goals are also in the works. Cheaper copies at the new FedEx Kinko's, further discussion on the College Readership Program, and speakers for the first Catholic Think Tank lecture series are all on Baron and Shappell's to­do list. 
The approaching inaugura­tion of University President Father John Jenkins makes this year an especially exciting one, Baron said. 
"I know Father Jenkins, in planning his inauguration, made students a priority, and that's a sign of what this administration is going to be about and I'm extremely encouraged," he said. 
Shappell is equally optimistic for the upcoming year.

And last week, students returned to campus to find themselves beneath the watch­ful stare of a brighter-than­ever Virgin Mary. 
"It was a special treat to come back to," senior Kyle Clements said. "Obviously it was a lot brighter and I could tell a big difference."

Anthropologist lives college freslunan year 
Associated Press 

PHOENIX -As a professor at Northern Arizona University, Cathy Small was baffled by undergraduates. They seemed less engaged, less likely to do assigned read­ing and more likely to ask questions like "Do you want it 
double~spaced?" 

So she decided to study them as anthropologists research any foreign culture -she lived among them. 
After moving into a dorm, eating cafeteria food and struggling with a five-course schedule, Small said she empathized with students who struggle to balance chaotic class and work schedules. 
"I'm trying to get really to what student culture is doing and tailor my teaching," said Small, who wrote a book on her research under the pseu­donym Rebekah Nathan called "My Freshman Year: What a Professor Learned by Becoming a Student." 
Small took a sabbatical and spent the 2002-2003 school year conducting her research. With approval from the uni­versity's research board, she used her high school tran­script to get admitted and moved into a dorm -though she did forgo the roommate experience by getting a single room. 
Small spent the first semes­ter taking classes outside her field of expertise, trying to immerse herself in student life. She didn't go to her Flagstaff home and didn't contact regular friends, trying to experience the loneliness and other travails of freshman life. 
During her second semester, she did more formal inter­views and focused on the research, which she published without identifying students or the university, although it eventually was outed by the media. 
Small said she found that students downplayed publicly the effort they put into assigned reading or papers, but when interviewed, many said they were interested in their course work. 
Her surveys also found that only about a third of what stu­dents were talking and think­ing about outside of class was based on their course work. 
That finding has led Small to change her coursework to better connect to the real world and to skip reading assignments that don't have a direct purpose. 
Part of the trick to college life, she learned from good students, was being able to quickly decipher what work needed to be done and what could be skipped. Those man­agement skills helped stu­dents balance classes, part­time work and involvement in volunteer or professional groups, Small said. 
She found some of the coursework tough and had to seek tutoring for a class far outside her field of study. "It was a hectic life," she said. 
Small also said she found current undergraduates faced more pressure to pick a major that readily translated into a job that could pay off student loans.

Officers clain1 bias in drug tests 
Dismissed for positive cocaine results, police sue Boston department 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -The seven police off'icers swore they didn't use cocaine, yet their hair tested positive for the drug. The offi­cers -all of them black -were promptly liwd or suspended. 
"I was in complete and utter shock," said Oflicer Shawn Noel llarris. "I know that I never used drugs a day in my life." 
The Boston ol'licers are now suing the police department, claiming the ma'ndatory drug tcst is unreliable and racially biased. They say hair testing is unfair because drug compounds show up more readily in dark hair than light hair.

threc months aftnr use; urine tests go hack only a few days and can be easily altered. 
But studies have found dark­hairnd people are more likely to test positive for drugs because they have higher levels of melanin, which allows drug compounds to bind more easily to their hair. 
The Boston lawsuit says the ollicers may have had some kind of environmental exposure to cocaine, but that they didn't use the drug themselves. The former officers are seeking reinstate­ment to their jobs, back pay, and unspndfied damages. 
Six of the seven former offi­cers had a secm1d hair test con­ducted that came back negative within days of 1he positive result. Harris had another hair test, a urine test and a blood test. All were analyzed by a dif­ferent laboratory and all came back negative. 
"It was humiliating," he said. "People who I once considered friends or comrades in arms treated me differently. They looked at me differently." 
Police Commissioner Kathleen O'Toole said the department believes the hair testing policy is sound. 
"Our department's lawyers have certainly studied this and are prepared to go forward and defend the exist­ing policy," O'Toole said. "To 
cy." 
Boston police 
began testing hair in 1999, replacing urine tests. Their testing company, Psychemedics Corp., is the largest provider of hair testing for drug use, with dients indud­ing Fortune 500 companies and police departments in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
William Thistle, Psychemedic's senior vice president and gener­al counsel, said the company's tests are well-supported and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Each hair sample is thorough­ly washed and soaked for an extensive period of time to remove any contaminants. If an initial test comes back positive, the sample is tested again, Thistle said. 

"The fact is that the test is 
extremely reliable," he said. 

But critics say it's far from perfect. Police are especially vulnerable because they can be exposed to drug residue on the job, they say. 
Fort Wayne, Ind., narcotics detective Timothy Bobay tested positive for cocaine after a hair sample was taken frol'h his fore­arm during a random screening last year. 
The police chief moved to fire him, but Bobay vehemently denied using cocaine. He argued the positive test came from exposure to cocaine dust on the job three weeks earlier. 
Bobay, who is white and has dark hair, had a hair sample taken from his head tested by a different laboratory and he also had a urine test. Both came back negative. 
The petition to fire him was withdrawn after Psychemedics said it was unable to rule out environmental exposure to cocaine as the reason for his positive test, said Bobay's lawyer, Patrick Arata. 
Under the substance abuse policy in Boston, officers who test positive for drug use are either fired or suspended for 45 days without pay and required to undergo rehab. Six of the seven police officers refused to sign rehabilitation agreements. The seventh officer signed the agreement so he could keep his job, but was later fired after testing positive in another hair test. 
Sheehan returns to Texas heactquarters 
Associated Press 

CHAWFOHD, Texas -A woman whose son was killed in Iraq returned to Texas on Wednesday to resume her anti-war protest near President Bush's ranch after a weeklong absence to care for her ailing mother. 
About a dozen protesters who have continued the peace vigil picked up Cindy Sheehan at the Waco airport Wednesday afternoon, six days after she flew to Los Angeles when her 74-year-old mother suffered a stroke. 
"This is where I belong, until Aug. 31, like I told the president," Sheehan said at the airport before driving about 20 miles to the Crawford site. 
When Sheehan arrived at the campsite, she saw a large banner depicting her son's face. She sobbed and said she felt ill. Supporters brought her water and cold towels, and she recovered about 20 min­utes later. 
Sheehan said her mother tried to say "I love you" and had started physical therapy for paralysis on her right side. 
"Even when I was in California, half of me was always here," she told The Associated Press late Wednesday. "I felt like since I started it, I should be here." 
Sheehan began her vigil Aug. 6 on the road leading to Bush's ranch, vowing to stay through his monthlong vaca­tion unless he met with her. Her 24-year-old son, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, was killed last ye!tr in Iraq. 
Sheehan's protest has encouraged anti-war activists to join her and prompted peace vigils nationwide. She also continues to draw harsh criticism. 
Conservative activists and military families were en route to Crawford from California on a tour called "You don't speak for me, Cindy!" The caravan coordi­nated by Move Amnrica Forward plans to hold a pro­Bush raliy in town Saturday. 
Among thosn defending Sheehan are former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, who believes that his wife's identity as an undereover CIA operative was leaked in retali­ation for his criticism of the Bush administration in a 2002 New York Times op-nd piece. 
"The Bush White Ilouse and its right-wing allies are responding to Cindy Sheehan and the military families' vigil in central Texas in the same way that they always respond to bad news -by unleashing personal attacks and smears against her," Wilson said in a statement released Wednesday. 
Later Wednesday, Bush was to return to Texas after a three-day trip to Idaho, where he met with some military families and gave speeches to rally support for the war. lie said Tuesday that he recog­nizes Sheehan's right to protest and understands her anguish, although she does not represent the views of many families he has met with.

A new academic year brings new classes, new roommates and new chal­lenges (a category that sometimes includes the new roommates), but for many it is the new football season that really has them excited. With the arrival of a new head coach who has promised to put the fight back into the Fighting Irish, to say that the atmosphere of anticipation here is intense would be an understatement. 
So why don't I care? 
Well, it's not why you might think. It's true that, being English, I wasn't exposed to American football during my formative years. Like most of my compatriots I grew up in a family fanatically devoted to what we Brits (along with almost everyone else in the world) call football, which is to say, soccer. But for some reason it didn't take and I am currently one of the few British men with no interest in soccer whatsoev­er. The others are called Richard and Charles. We sometimes meet up, although it turns out that shared non­interests aren't a very firm basis for friendship. 
It's not that I don't enjoy playing sports. In high school I played rugby and cricket. Rugby is actually quite similar to American football, except that you ean't pass forward and you don't get to wear body armor. When I left for college, everyone -well it seemed like everyone -told me it would be a time of self-dis­covery. I joined the rowing club as the coxswain for the women's boat, and one of the things I found out about myself while at college is that shouting orders at eight athletic women in Lycra is one of 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

the very few things I am willing to get out of bed at 6 a.m. in order to do. My rowing career lasted for a very enjoyable year before I eventually quit, having come to the conclusion that this was catering to an aspect of my character that it was best not to encourage. 
The point is that I can enjoy sports as a participant, but I've never been able to get anything out of them as a spectator. In his Meditations, the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius recalls how he was taught not to take the side of the green or the blue party at the Circus games, nor to favor the heavily or lightly­armored gladiators in the arena. As a Stoic, he was supposed to avoid investing care in things outside of his own control; by not favoring one side over another he could greet any result with equanimity. 
In a sports stadium the equanimity that Marcus Aurelius cultivated through self-discipline comes naturally to me (although in my case the Stoic tempera­ment doesn't seem to have carried over into other areas of my life, as my lan­guage anytime I stub my toe will testify). The problem is that it takes the fun out of watching sports if you are not invested in the outcome of the game. That, of course, is the reason why we support a particular team and place bets. It's also the reason for the various traditions of the stadium -the cheering, the chanti­ng, the rattling of keys-all are ways of turning spectators into participants. For whatever reason I seem to be immune to the ell'ect. 
I sometimes hear complaints from pro­fessors about the importance attached to football at the University. I can certainly see where they are coming from. When I first arrived here I often got asked what it was like being at a religious university and it was some time before I figured out that the religion being referred to was Catholicism. 
Having said that, the professors are not exactly disinterested parties, and you (by "you" here I mean "I") cannot help wondering if their complaint is not moti­vated at least in part by the thought that the undergraduates here might be more awed by their professors' brains if only they were less fixated on the diameter of Brady Quinn's arms. 
There are plenty of reasons to cele­brate Notre Dame football even for those of us who fmd that we cannot appreciate it. It unquestionably helps to foster the spirit of community on campus, and also contributes to the especially close bond between the University and its alumni. 
Personally, I admire athletes, and not only because most of them could pick me up by the head with one hand. What I fmd most impressive is their dedication, their willingness to push themselves day after day after day to run faster and throw better than they-perhaps than anyone-has ever done before. 
The ancient Greeks dated their history from the first Olympic Games and stopped wars in order to compete. I think it's not coineidence that, of all the civilizations of the ancient world, they surpassed all others in their intellectual achievements as well. Physically and mentally, they strove to test the limits of human potential. On the sports field it is the physical prowess of the athlete that impresses us, but the habits that it took to acquire that prowess -the dedica­tion, the discipline, tho patience --are not just sporting virtues, they are schol­arly ones too.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Beyond Frosh-0 

U-WIRE 
Rank distraction 
Freshnwn, with your weekend of initiation into Notre Damn life in the past, it is now time to Dis-0 both mind and body (illusionary dichoto­my? I don't know, ask your Philosophy 101 professor). I under­stand tho strategy and purpose behind Frosh-0, and it's all well and good to try and make freshmen com­fortable by helping them meet new pnople on campus. But, freshmen, takn this adviee for what it's worth: do not let Frosh-0 limit the potential of your life at Notre Dame. Let's out­line the hazardous limits of Frosh-0. 
I. The dorm shirts. Dorm pride has its plaee, but the dorm should not structure the entirety of your life here. The vast majority of students at Notre Dame are friends with very few nwmbers of their own sex who do not live in their dorm. This trnnd takes root during Frosh-0 when the dorm upperelassnwn instill an extreme dorm loyalty. The extremity of this trond is oncapsulated in thn T-shirts that membors of tho same dorm must woar for tho entire weokend as a marker of their new identity. Think about this, and you'll n~alize that. it's a hit ridiculous. 
2. Social gatherings. Maybe you did not eateh it during tho weekend because you wore just so pumped to s1w so many mombers of the opposite sox, but, yes, it's true, the social gath­orings were exdusively coordinated between men's and women's dorms. or course this falls in line with the dorm pride/rivalry concept so preva­lent on campus, but it possesses such a downsidn. I mean, it sounds crazy, maybn, but dudes from one dorm may enjoy the company of dudes from another dorm. Oh, yeah. and guess why they sot you up with opposite-sex dorms? So that you (insert "guy") can get digits and start ofT your time at Notre Dame right by viewing the opposite sex (insert "women") as physical objects. Duh. 
3. 
Conversation starters. What's your major? What is your quest? What is your favorite color? Seriously, though. I know you have to start somewhere, but half of you will prob­ably get weeded out of freshmen chemistry, curse the banality of the method of instruction and learning in the science department, open your minds and become Classics majors. OK, that would happen in a perfect world. But, honestly, don't ask the friends you make this year what their majors are until sophomore year at the earliest. The major is nothing on which to base a relationship. One more thing. If ever faced with tho choice of reading your General Chemistry textbook or Dostoevsky, for the love of God show Dostoevsky some respect. 

4. 
Drinking alcohol. OK, I'm finally going to touch upon the big 'un. Your RA's are too brainwashed by now after their week of pro-Frosh-0 train­ing to tell you what's truly up. And the Frosh-0 staff was probably on weekend lockdown at the behest of their rectors to not talk about the drinking that goes on under the Dome. But just so you know, if the dorms get a little too tight or a little too sweaty there's an inViting, well­fabled, well-stocked little place called Turtle Creek across the road from the soccer stadium. There's a nice little road that runs past the tennis courts that happens to not be paved with gold but should be. So mosey on over. I'll be there waiting to greet you.

Sensational coverage keeps us from real news stories
Clarifying libertarianism 

Tho Viewpoint column on libertari­anism ("Neither left nor right," Aug. 
24) is oxcnllnnt. and I will be follow­ing it throughout the year. 
llowovor, tho non-aggression princi­ple unnecessarily excludes too many pooplo as libortarian. The boundaries or what makos ror a libertarian are sorter than tho column implies. There is no necessary requirement that we viow all initiation of aggression as morally wrong, or as something the state has no abstract right to engage in order to consider ourselves liber­tarians. We might agree that every­one should get a pumpkin carver, but worry that no institution can make it work. Or we might think that giving any institution the power to give us pumpkin carvers will also lead to that institution doing all kinds of other things that we definitely don't want, and don't want more than we want the distribution of pumpkin carvers. 
In short, we may agree with the justness of initiating aggression in some cases, but believe that there are too many practical things standing in the way of doing this aggressing just right. What makes for a libertarian is believing that the state should keep its hands to itself on both economic and civil issues. Whether or not us libertarians believe that we can never initiate aggression is interesting, but it is not a requirement. 
Peter Jaworski Professor, Bowling Green State University August 24 


In response to the U.S. News & World Report's college rankings monopoly, The Washington Monthly responded with their own definition of "best" college. Editors of the political monthly apply Michael President John F. Behr Kennedy's "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what University of you can do for your Virginiacountry" maxim to col­Cavalier Daily lege life. 
U.S. News rankings focus on academic excellence and rf1pu­tation, whereas The Washington Monthly praises "productive" institutions which benefit soeif1ty. Although academ­ie quality is crucial to choosing the right college, more emphasis should be placed on the latter criterion. With financial resources, research capabilities and educational opportunities, colleges can improve society, not just struggle for elite reputations. 
The Washington Monthly used three criteria for undergraduate institutions: "engines of social mobility, they should produce the academic minds and scien­tific research that advance knowledge and drive economic growth, and they should inculcate and encouragn an ethic of service." 
The Washington Monthly rewards uni­versities that produce knowledgeable students who want to serve their coun­try, help the less fortunate, lind medical cures, etc. This is more desirable than the business student who strives to run international investment firms which may exploit Third World sweatshop workers and take advantage of the poor. 
So will students run to The Washington Monthly for college advice? Probably not. Students and parents want to invest their money at the best institu­tion, which is normally defined as bning the best academically and having tho strongest reputation. Thnrnforn, collngns have an institutional responsibility to downplay the U.S. News academic erito­ria and look to improve s01~inty. To main­tain acadnmie nxenllencn and to improve society l"or generations to como are admirable, equally important goals­yet the latter oftnn succumbs to the l"or­mor on priority lists. 
To restriet tho goals of undergraduate institutions to the education of its stu­dents is unproductive in larger social eontnxts. Community scrvicn, medical rnseareh, national service and poverty rnliel" are easily integrated into aeadl~lll­ic programs at universities like MIT. UClA and Berknley (the top thrne sehools on The Washington Monthly's list). The editors are not suggesting a "Peaee Corps" mJucation-but students should be mindful of the problnms sur­rounding thnir institution and how to best use these resourees t.o solvn societal i nadnq uacies. 
It is a massive wasto or morwy and time to ignore societal responsibilities. Colleges have the l"unding and resourcns in place to bring about changn to the society we livn in. U.S. News and other ranking lists allow society to forget these responsibilities and focus on aeademic rnputation. Yet in order to assum our wellbeing in tho future, we nned to rnward beneficial and socially produc­tive institutions.

Ever heard of Natalee Holloway? Of course you have. Greta Van Susteren from Fox News and Nancy Grace from CNN News have made it their apparent personal missions to find Natalee Holloway and to use their broadcasting Staff abilities to bring her Editorial killers or abductors to justice. We haven't Iowa State seen this kind of a Daily dogged chase after the perpetrators of a crime since 9/11. Oh, wait. 
Why does the Natalee Holloway case get so much attention while other, more important stories drift away'? Well, there are two groups to blame. 
The first group is the journalists who will cover whatever story will get them the most ratings and the second group is all of us. We need to do our part to turn away from the car crash and try to ignore it. 
This kind of sensational news report­ing leads to a collective tunnel vision in our society where the story that has the best ratings gets the best coverage, regardless of the importance or validity of the story. 
When was the last time you read or saw a great piece on anything going on that wasn't in America or Iraq? There is plenty of world news out there to eover that never reaches American homes because it simply isn't "sexy" enough for us, no matter how pressing the news might be. If it laeks the kind of human drama that Americans crave in their news, the cable news shows won't air it. 
Now, African debt relief may not be as compelling television as a drama like the llolloway ease, but we feel we can do better. If the advertising exeeutivns at companies like Coca-Cola can make a sugar-based bnverage "sexy" or desir­able, then CNN should be abln to do more to makn the world nnws morn eompelling and rolovant to American audiences. 
Bob Costas has recently enternd our good graces because, unlike Van Susteren and other cable IWWS hosts, he refused to host a show l"or CNN in place of Larry King that would have primarily covered the Natalee Holloway ease. Costas missed out on a show that included 10 guests-seven of them talked about the missing girl and the other three talked about the BTK killer. Costas said in a statement about the decision not to host, "I didn't think the subject matter of Thursday's show was the kind of broadcast I should bn doing." 
If by "kind of broadcast," he means the kind of broadcast that oll'ers us pun­ishingly redundant speculation on the Holloway case by overpaid "experts," then we couldn't agree more with him. 
Costas may not have explicitly statnd why he was uncomfortable with the show's subjeet matter, but we are all grateful that at least one broadeaster has the sense to know which news sto­ries really matter to the nation.

Reign of the King 
Shakespeare's popular masterpiece 'Henry V' enjoys 
By KATE PETELLE Scene Writer 
This weekend marks the final per­formances of "Henry V" by Summer Shakespeare at Notre Dame. The show, produced by Notre Dame's Paul Rathburn and directed by William Brown, a well-known Chicago theatre director, showcases the talents of both professional and student actors. It began its run Aug. 9 and will conclude with a matinee performance this Sunday. 
"Henry V" is Shakespeare's retelling 
of the historical events surrounding the Battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years War between England and France. The play follows the actions of the young King Henry V of England as he strives to prove himself, per­suading his country of the merits of the 
war, leading his soldiers to battle, demonstrating his abilities as a mili­tary leader and as a King, and becom­ing a national hero. 
As the audience watches the por­trayal of a young prince growing into a king, the many facets of the play are revealed. Though the play is in many ways a celebration of the English nation and the achievements of one of the country's great heroes, its rele­vance to today's audience lies largely in its complex take on war, revealing both its glory and its savagery. 
"Henry V" is full of the grand rheto­ric of war and nationhood, but Shakespeare is also careful to show the sometimes-selfish motives behind the actions of war, the questionable morality behind the invasions of other countries and the sorrow that accom­panies the glory of battle. The play is not exclusively pro-or anti-war, but rather both at once, making it inter­esting and relevant to audiences in 2005. 
HenryV 
Dates: Thursday, Aug. 25, 2005, 7:30p.m. Friday, Aug. 26, 2005, 7:30p.m. Saturday, Aug. 27, 2005, 2:30 p.m. and 7:30p.m. Sunday, Aug. 28, 2005, 2:30 p.m. Venue: DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts Tickets: $20-30, depending on showtime, $12 for students 
Putting on a production of a history play is "much more complex" than the romances and comedies that Summer Shakespeare has produced in the past, Rathburn said (past shows include "Romeo and Juliet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "The Tempest," "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Taming of the Shrew"). "Henry V" is alternately serious, humorous and sad, and there is even a wonderful love scene at the end. 
"Henry V" marks the sixth season of Summer Shakespeare at Notre Dame. But the roots of the project extend much further back. In 1983, Hathburn 
speare. 
Back at Notre Dame, Rathburn began a course called "Shakespeare in Performance," in which students put on four plays each semester. He began taking students to Chicago and Ontario to see Shakespearean produc­tions and did a Shakespeare film series on campus. 
In 2000, Rathburn founded Summer 

Shakespeare at Notre Dame, with the goal of producing high-quality, professional productions.  ...Henry V' is full of the grand rhetoric ofwar and  sional and ten student actors. Students who partici­pate in the program

This summer's show is remarkable for a num­ber of reasons, not the least of which is that this is the first full Shakespearean perform­ance in the new DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, and it takes full advantage of the stage and the possi­bilities that the new the­atre holds.

CONCERT REVIEW 

Hope shines 
Talented young pop star gets chance to shine with Jesse McCartney at local venue 

By JILLIAN PIETRZAK and 
MELISA ZIMMERMAN 
Scene Writers 
A small town girl and an up­
and-coming pop artist, Hope 
Partlow got a chance to shine as 
the opener for headlining act 
Jesse McCartney. 
Teaming up with the tmm pop 
star in a concert at the Morris 
Civic Auditorium, Tennessee 
native Partlow gave an ener­
getic performance. The 17 -year­
old's vocals, reminiscent of 
.Janis Joplin's tone, deliver pow­
erful messages through songs 
like "Who We Are," Partlow's 
first single. But don't let her 
rebel attitude fool you. Growing 
up in rural Tennessee, along 
with her gospel and country 
roots, has added a unique Oare 
to her music. 
The singer enjoys being on tour with McCartney, saying it's "crazy" to be paired with such a big name in pop music. Although she is still new at tour­ing, she loves how the fans are "cool and devoted" and enjoys 'signing autographs for them 
after her show. 
Her first album, entitled "Who 
We Are," is set to arrive in 
stores on Sept. 6. The album is 
produced by Grammy-winning 
producer Matt Serletic, said 
Partlow's representative 
Samantha Bowman. Serletic,

that McCartney had won thn !warts of the loeals from South Bend and those from out of town through audience partici­pation and high-energy chore­ography. 
Even though the overall pnr­formances were successful, the technical aspeets of the show were a bit lacking. The set did not seem to be a good match with the show. Unlike the con­cert itself, the set was plain and boring. Sound beeame an issun as well. At times, there was fendbaek from the microphones and thn singers were hard to hear. The thousands of seream­ing girls did not help the situa­tion either. 
But by the end of the night, the concert was a success. McCartney and Partlow mer­chandise new ofl' of the shelves and autographs could not be signed fast enough for the mas­sive crowds. Both Partlow and McCartney had clean lyries, upbeat and energetic perform­ances, and good audience involvement. The eoneert was well-attended and full of family fun.

women outnumbered the male audience members at the con­cert. Fortunately, the female fans at the concert reaeted warmly, especially when she dedicated a song to them, which she called her "anthem to Jesse." Many fans cheered and applauded her as well as waited in a long line to receive her autograph. 
The showstopper of the night was McCartney. As soon as the house lights dimmed and the

a fan base and getting the word out about her album. Partlow also wishes for a good response to her album and the opportuni­ty to create another one. 
Although the tour has gone well, Partlow was originally worried about how the female McCartney fans would respond to her performance. She was afraid that they would view her as competition. Partlow was not joking when she classil'ied the concert as a "seream fest." The thousands of girls began screaming, the 18-year­old singer filled his set with pop tunes and strong bal­lads, includ­ing a sere­

nade of his song "Take Your Sweet Time" to one lucky fan. His smash hits "Beautiful Soul" and "She's No You" from his multi-platinum album, also enti­tled "Beautiful Soul," were defi­nite highlights of the show. 
During the coneert, signs and what seemed to be a large flag were hoisted up in the crowd reading "I Love Jesse" and "Pick Me," all paying homage to the former soap star. It was evident

Buerhle's strong outing lifts ChiSox over Twins 
Texas routs Seattle, Jays outlast Yankees, Brewers top Marlins 
Associated Press 
After squandering a sparkling 

performance by Freddy Garcia 
the night before, the Chicago 
White Sox weren't about to 
waste a fine outing by Mark 
Buehrle. 
Buehrle scattered six hits 

over eight innings, Carl Everett 
homered and drove in four runs 
and the White Sox beat 
Minnesota 6-4 on Wednesday to 
snap a four-game losing streak 
to the Twins. 
Benefiting from four double 

plays, Buehrle (14-6) gave up 
one run and struck out six with­
out allowing a walk to end a 
personal five-game losing 
streak against Minnesota _ 
which beat Garcia 1-0 on one 
hit on Tuesday. 
"That was vintage Mark _ 

strikes, groundballs, double 
plays. He didn't walk a batter," 
said former Twins catcher A.J. 
Pierzynski, who had three hits. 
"That's why he's one of the best 
there is. When he's on, he can 
beat anybody." 
Everett had three hits, the 

first five batters in the lineup 
went 11-for-22 and Chicago 
won for only the second time in 
10 games. 
Matthew LeCroy homered and drove in two runs for Minnesota, which watched starter Joe Mays (6-9) struggle again and threaten his place in the rotation. 
"We won, and that's all that matters," said Buehrle, who faced the minimum through five innings. "It was nice to get my confidence back up." 
Once Buehrle left, the Twins staged a serious rally _ getting a two-run homer from Nick Punta off Cliff Politte to pull within 6-3 in the ninth. Joe Mauer greeted Damaso Marte with a single, and Dustin Hermanson gave up an RBI double to LeCroy before getting the last two outs for his 31st save. 
"We've been reading stories about us choking all year," Hermanson said. "It's nothing new. I just hope the guys aren't reading the paper." 
Rangers 8, Mariners 1 
For the second straight game, the Texas Rangers got a quality outing from a young starter. This time, it was rookie Juan Dominguez's turn. 
Dominguez pitched two-hit ball over six innings for his sec­ond career victory, and Kevin Mench homered to lead the Rangers past the Seattle Mariners Wednesday night. 
Dominguez (1-3) allowed one

run and five walks while strik­ing out three in his 10th major league start. 
"Everything was working fine," Dominguez said through an interpreter. "I was able to make good adjustments throughout the game." 
Texas starters have struggled over the last two months with a 
6.64 ERA in a 58-game span heading into Wednesday night. 
However, Dominguez's sharp effort came one day after Chris Young gave up one run and four hits in five innings of a 6-4 vic­tory over Seattle. 
"It's definitely a boost for us," said Rangers catcher Rod Barajas, who went 2-for-4 with two RBis. "I want to help these young guys, get them through as many innings as possible. It was good to see (Dominguez) throw strikes and get outs." 
Dominguez, 1-1 with a 3.93 ERA in three starts since being recalled from the minors on Aug. 13, threw his fastball for strikes and used a change-up to keep the Mariners guessing. 
"He kept us off-balance with the changeup," Seattle slugger Richie Sexson said. 
Blue Jays 9, Yankees 5 

Vernon Wells had one thing on his mind in the fifth inning. 
"I don't want to make an out," Wells said. "Everyone else is doing something." 
Wells had _nothing to worry about. He got to join in the fun, too. 
Wells hit a three-run homer off Mike Mussina in a nine-run fifth, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees on Wednesday night to snap a five­game losing streak. 
Russ Adams added a two-run double in the inning, when the Blue Jays scored eight times off Mussina in their biggest inning since a their biggest inning since a nine-run sixth against the Angels on June 15, 1999, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 
They had seven hits off Mussina and Felix Rodriguez, and 10 consecutive batters reached with one out. 
"We had some good at-bats," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "We were way overdo anyway." 
Mussina (12-8) hurt himself by allowing two walks and hit­ting a batter. 
He allowed eight runs in an inning for the first time since Sept. 24, 2003, against the Chicago White Sox, according to Elias. 
Dave Bush (3-7) allowed five hits in six scoreless innings to win for the first time since Aug. 3. 
He beat the Yankees for the first time since pitching a career-best two-hitter against them in a 7-0 victory in Toronto on Oct. 1. 
"He always pitches very good when he's facing these guys, which is tough to do," Gibbons said. 
Hideki Matsui had three hits and drove in two runs for the Yankees, and pinch-hitter Bernie Williams added a three­run homer off Vinnie Chulk in the ninth. It was Williams' first career pinch-hit homer. 
The Yankees had their six­game home winning streak snapped and fell into a tie with Oakland for the AL wild-card lead. 
"Just when you think you have everything rolling in your direction, and then something that doesn't figure happens," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "That's what happened tonight." 
Brewers 6, Marlins 4 

Rookies Rickie Weeks, J.J. Hardy and Corey Hart are pro­viding a positive glimpse of the future for the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Weeks drove in the game-win­ning run in the sixth inning, Hardy had three hits and Hart manufactured a key run as the Brewers took advantage of four Florida errors in a victory over the Marlins on Wednesday night. 
"They've been playing great since they got here," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. "A huge part of what makes this so exciting is watching those kids get an opportunity and do well with it." 

Weeks broke a 4-4 tie with a single off Marlins starter A.J. Burnett that scored Damian Miller from second. Hardy came around to score when the ball scooted past right fielder Jeff Conine.Weeks said the rookies want to carry their weight. 
"It takes a lot off the veterans' backs like Carlos Lee and Geoff Jenkins," he said. "We're trying to add and trying to keep up with them." 
Hardy isn't analyzing his game after struggling early in the season. 
"I don't know what I'm doing right now," he said after tying his career-high with three sin­gles. ''I'm just out there trying to see the ball and put good swings on it,." 
Marlins manager Jack McKeon is impressed with the Brewers' youngsters. 
"I like their kids," he said. "They've got a lot of fire in them." 
Burnett (12-7). who gave up two earned runs over six innings, was burned by th.ree errors in the first inning, none costlier than his own.His errant throw on a high chopper by Lee led to two runs after he was staked to a 1-0 lead on an RBI single by Carlos Delgado in the top of the inning.

The advantage looked as if it would hold up, but United was forced to play a man down after Kovalenko was ejected in the 72nd minute after receiving his second yel­low card.With seconds remaining before the end of regulation, Dallas capitalized on United's misfortune, tying the match when Carlos Huiz beat defender Bobby Boswell, angling his way into the box before slipping a shot past United goalkeeper Troy Perkins from 25 yards out. 
Adu made his return to United's lineup in the 65h minute and made his pres­ence felt immediately with a run on goal late in the match. But Brian Carroll missed a point-blank shot that would have sealed the game, shoot­ing wide right o!T a feed from Adu. 
It was Adu's first action since injuring his knee injury in a 3-2 win over Chicago on Aug. 6. Unitnd was without tho services of loading scorer Jaime Moreno.

Brewster

is a 2005 team co-captain. While the two are ready and willing to lead the Irish, Brewster realizes it's the entire group of five seniors that will have to carry the team. 
''I'm fortunate because of the class of five seniors we have," Brewster said. "I think it gives us an advantage. It is special to have a lot of seniors out on the court. We've spent four years·. together, and we're going to have a really great team." 
The seniors include setter Kelly Burrell, middle blocker/opposite Carolyn Cooper, outside hitter/middle blocker Lauren Kelbley, Brewster and libero/outside hit­ter Henican. In the off-season, Brewster and the seniors con­tinued to improve their game. 
"Lauren Kelbley, Carolyn Cooper ... we just always work on blocks together," Brewster said. 
The Irish will take on eight 2004 NCAA tournament quali­fiers and five pre-season Top 25 foes this fall. Though then~ is not much breathing room ·on the schedule, Brewster is excit­ed to get the chance to compete against some powerhouses. 
"It's a good opportunity to play a team in the top 25 or top 10, and fortunately, we get to play a couple of them this year," she said. 
Brewster has started for the Irish since the first match of her freshman season. She's a three­time all-Big East pick -honor­able mention her freshman year and first-team her past two sea­sons. 
As a sophomore, she finished first in Division I in individual blocking with an average of 
1.78 per game and was named honorable mention American Volleyball Coaches' Association [AVCA] All-American. She upped her game a few notches last season, earning third-team All-American, becoming the first Irish volleyball player ever to receive the prestigious honor. At last year's Big East tourna­ment, she was named Most Valuable Player. 
Overall, she ranks in the top 10 in nine Notre Dame statisti­cal categories including second in hitting percentage and block­ing. And she needs only 167 blocks this season to become the Notre Dame career leader. 
In addition to her play on the volleyball court, Brewster suc­ceeds in the classroom. In each of her first three seasons with the Irish, she was named a Big East Academic All Star. 
Despite all the awards and lofty expectations, the Big East's top phtyer shuns pressure. 
"I guess there's a lot of pres­sure and high expectations, but I can't really think about that," she said. "You just have to play. If you're on the court, you're not thinking, 'Oh, I have to block this ball ... ' You're just playing the best that you can." 
Brewster is so focused she doesn't really have time to think about pressure. Instead of get­ting nervous and turning to music or other forms of relax­ation before big matches, she studies. Instead of meditating or bouncing ofT locker room walls, she assesses the opposition. 

"Not anything unusual," said Brewster -referring to her pre-game rituals. ''I'll go over some .of our ... blocking schemes and different things that I'll go over about the other team." 
When asked about inspira­tional music she might use to fire herself up for a match, she laughed. 
"No. I listen to 'Here Come the Irish'," she said. "I like that song a lot." 
According to Brewster, the veteran Irish team is pushing for more than just a 14th straight NCAA tournament appearance. The goal is to make a deep run. 
"I would really like to see our team get to at least the Sweet 16, or the Elite 8, that would be the ultimate goal for me per­sonally and for our team," Brewster said. 
So when the Irish are warm­ing up before their first regular­season game this Saturday, when the ubiquitous "Here Come the Irish" song blares over the loudspeakers at the Joyce Center, Lauren Brewster -the All-American, the All Star student, the hard-working teammate -most likely won't be too nervous. 
She'll be focused.

For Langenkamp, the win was a milestone. 
"I played it the year before," he said. "It's really the pinnacle of the collegiate tournaments and a lot of guys play it, so I wanted to go there and get some good competition and play the top players from different schools." 
Although Irish coach Bobby Bayliss was not involved in coaching Langenkamp for the event, he spoke with him briefly before the final match, which featured Lankegemp defeating Miami's Eric Hechtman 6-3, 6-1 on

In his coach's opinion, Langenkamp had a more well-rounded game than Hechtman. 
"Hechtman's a tough out," Bayliss said. "He's got a big dominant forehand and he doesn't make many mistakes. But I felt like Eric has more variety in his games and can a Notre Dame tennis player, mix things up better and Bayliss says the psychological could also slice him wide to benefits of the win have the backhand to keep him already been visible. from running around hitting "I think it's already affect-

"Really, the finals was a great match," he said. "[Hechtman]'s played No. 2 for Miami, he's a well known guy who was great in the juniors and a great col­lege player. To beat him the 
way I did was just really the ultimate highlight of the whole tournament."

Although the tournament does not affect his record as ment circuit and the spring season approaches, Langenkamp will be able to build on his experiences from the summer's tournament play. 

"I think the confidence win­ning an event like that, par­ticularly a national event, is going to vault him into anoth­er level of capabilities of the way he'll feel about himself on the court," Bayliss said.

"I'll still have the same atti­tude of working hard but I really made a statement at [the tournament] and I turned some heads I think," Langenkamp said.

driving. 
Authorities say the 41-year-old Gooden was visibly intoxieated when he was pulled over for driving erratieally near downtown Tampa early Monday. 
lin twiee refused to get out of the ear for a field sobriety test, drove away suddenly and has­n't been seen since, police said. 
Ol'licers have visitnd his two known residences in Tampa, made contact with family members, former drug coun­selors and every attorney who has represented him, and talkod to his former employer, the New York Yankees, police spokeswoman Laura McElroy said. 
Everyone was "extremely cooperative," she said, but no one has seen him. 
Police don't even know if he's still in the Tampa area. 
"It's a sad situation for some­one who obviously has a seri­ous problem and is adding to his own problems by his actions right now," McElroy said. 
Gooden, who has a history of substance abuse and currently has a domestic violence charge pending in the court, is wanted on felony charges of DUI and fleeing police, and a misde­meanor charge of resisting arrest without violence. 
The 1984 Hookie of the Year and the 1985 NL Cy Young Award winner while with tho New York Mets, Gooden went 194-112 with a 3.51 EHA before retiring in 2001. He also pitched for the Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Devil Hays. 
Gooden was arrested by Tampa police in 2002 on a drunken driving charge, but later pleaded guilty to reckless driving and received a year probation. He was charged with hitting his live-in girl­friend in March. 
While playing with the Mets in 1994, Gooden was suspend­ed 60 days for a positive cocaine test. 
The drug came up again in a test during his suspension and he was sidelined for the 1995 season. 
He recently worked for the Yankees as a special adviser but quit in April.

Schilling to start again for BoSox 
Pitcher admits feeling uncomfortable in the bullpen this season 
Associated Press Curt Schilling will leave his jitters in the bullpen when he makes his first start since April 23. The Boston right-hander, who has been filling in as the Hod Sox closer since mid-July, said Wednesday that replacing Keith Foulke left him feeling "naked" every time he took the mound. "A lot of my theories were not applieable as a closer," Schilling told Boston radio station WEE!, a day before his scheduled start against the Kansas City Hoyals. "In my mind, preparation-wise, I was kind of going out there naked. That was very uncom­fortable for me." Still, Schilling _ who declined to speak to reporters before Wednesday night's game against the Hoyals _ aceom­plished a good deal during the bullpen stint that started when he came ofT the disabled list in mid-July. He used the time to strengthen his surgically repaired right ankle, and per­formed well enough in relief to convert nine of his 11 save opportunities for the AL East 
lcmders. 
"lin holpnd us win," general manager Tlwo Epstnin said. "That's the bottom line. ·lin roally did something soilless to help us win." 
Also on Wndnesday, an arbi­trator heard left-hander David Wells' appeal of his six-gamn suspension for making contaet with two umpires on July 2. 
Wells denind those allegations once more after the hearing, although he said he would bn willing to pay a line for swear­ing_ although he denind saying anything out loud. 
"I gave them a tapn," he said. "The tape completely shows there was no spitting, no bump­ing. The only thing you ean do is read my lips, and that's it." 
Wells also said the tape showed umpire Angnl Hernandez grabbing him. 
"If they toueh us, thny should be suspended," Wells said. "That's like bumping us, and umpires do it all the time." 
No decision is expectnd bnfore Friday, and Epstein said it will likely be next week bnfore orw is handed down. 
That leaves Schilling as Boston's most immediate con­cern. The Hed Sox intnnd to get him seven starts by the end of the regular season, managnr Terry Francona said. 


Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling pauses during a game 
with the Detroit Tigers earlier this week. Schilling was recently 
moved back Into the Red Sox starting rotation.

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Bob Huggins agreed Wednesday to step down as Cincinnati's basketball coach, ousted by a school president determined to change the program's image. 
One day after Huggins was given a choice of resigning or being fired, he agreed to take a $3 million buyout of his contract. The school's offer includes a chance to stay for three more months, giving advice on basketball recruits and related mat· ters. 
"We are working on the details of the agreement, which may or may not be finalized in the next 24 

hours," said Richard Katz, the coach's attorney. , Huggins left Katz's office 
without comment, dressed in his black Cincinnati jacket, when no final deal 
was reached on Wednesday. 
The university sent Katz a letter earlier in the day outlining the $3 million buyout. The letter, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, offered Huggins $110,000 per month for the next three months to stay on and ease the coaching transition. 
"His duties will include providing information about the current team, identifying and comment· ing upon potential recruits, and documenting his insti­tutional memory of the basketball program during his 16-year coaching tenure," the letter said. 
An interim coach has not been chosen. The school doesn't anticipate hiring a permanent replacement until after the 2005-06 season; its first in the Big East. The school will have a difficult time attracting recruits in the meantime. 
The volcanic coach who won more games than any­one else in Cincinnati his-
IN BRIEF 
Armstrong strongly opposes 
comments by Tour director 
WASHINGTON -Lance Armstrong went on the offensive Wednesday, saying it was "preposterous" for the Tour de F_rance director to say that the legendary cyclist "fooled" race officials and the sporting world by cheating his way to seven straight titles. 
Comments by Tour director Jean­Marie Leblanc appeared in the French sports daily L'Equipe on Wednesday, a day after the newspa­per reported that six urine samples provided by Armstrong during the 1999 Tour tested positive for the red blood cell-booster EPO. 
"I actually spoke to him for about 30 minutes and he didn't say any of that stuff to me personally," Armstrong said, referring to Leblanc. 
"But to say that I've fooled the fans is preposterous. I've been doing this a long time. We have not just one year of only 'B' samples; we have seven years of 'A' and 'B' samples. 

They've all been negative," he said during a conference call from Washington, D.C. Eagles lose Buckhalter to knee surgery 
PHILADELPHIA The Philadelphia Eagles keep losing play­ers even before the season begins. 
Backup running back Correll Buckhalter, who has a history of injuries, will miss the season after undergoing knee surgery for the third time in four years. Buckhalter, who missed nearly all of training camp, underwent surgery Tuesday to repair a torn patella tendon in his right knee. · 
Last year, he had season-ending surgery on the same tendon after he injured it in a preseason game. 
"He's a great kid," coach Andy Reid said Wednesday. "He worked so hard in the offseason. He came back in phenomenal shape. We were looking forward to getting him back out there. lie did some good things. For that to happen, your heart goes out tory was forced out by an academically minded school president who does­n't like Huggins' history or philosophy. President Nancy Zimpher sent Huggins an ultimatum on Tuesday, giving him 24 hours to either take the buyout, stay in a capacity other than basketball coach or get fired from the job. 
"It could happen to any­one when you get hired by a different president," Louisville coach Rick Pitino said Wednesday. "There's a difference in philosophies. It happens. It's a change in CEOs. They have their own people."

TAMPA -The Tampa Bay Lightning took another step to keep the core of their Stanley Cup champi­onship team together Wednesday, signing Martin St. Louis to a six-year contract worth more than $31 million. 
The 30-year-old right wing had 38 goals and 56 assists for 94 points dur­ing the 2003-04 season to win the llart Trophy as MVP, Art Ross Trophy (scoring leader) and Lester B. Pearson Award (MVP as chosen by the players) while leading the Lightning to their first league title. 
"I've said it many times in the past and I continue to maintain that Martin St. Louis is the heart and soul of our hockey team,' general manager Jay Feaster said. 
"Dating all the way back to the summer of 2004, there was never a moment when we were not firmly committed as an organization to get­ting Marty signed long term."

Old SWC stalvvarts search for new identity 
Ten years later, SMU, TCU, Houston, Rice pine for past glory 
Associated Press 
For former SMU star Craig James, one night best typifies the passion and tradition of thn Southwest Conference. 
The unbeaten Mustangs took national championship hopes into their last conference game of 1982 against an 8-1 Arkansas team coached by Lou lloltz. The game drew 65,000 fans to Texas Stadium -more than the Dallas Cowboys did for any game that incomo from the BCS, the system designed to linn up the best teams from thn biggest (~onfnr­ences for the highest-paying bowls. Last year, for example, the Big 12 was guarantned morn than $14 million to split bntween its members. C-USA and the Mountain West wore each guar­anteed about $1 million. 
The breakup hasn't hurt as much on the field. Each of thn eastofl"s except SMU has bnrwfit­ed from no longer being fodder for Tnxas and Tnxas A&amp;M.

No conference game since has meant so much for SMU. The same is true for TCU, Houston and Hice, which were also left im the fringes of big-time football after the SWC's 81 st and final season a decade ago. The con­ference dissolved when Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Teeh and Baylor jumped to the Big 12. 
Since then. the SWC's Forgotten Four have fallen from a stable, elite league into the vast midsection of Division 1-A foot­ball, missing out on millions ·of dollars in bowl and television revenue while playing before smaller crowds in ever-changing conferences against faraway foes.

Still, none of the schools has fully reeovered from the SWC breakup, which came amid a 1990s realignment frenzy that preceded formation of the BCS. 
The biggest hit has been finan­cial. It's tough to say exaetly how much money the schools have lost since being snubbed by the Big 12 and other major confer­ences. School o!licials declined to release football income figures, but losses are easily in the mil­lions. 
"You're talking about money at the gate, television money, bowl money," Houston athletic direc­tor Dave Maggard said. "You're talking millions of dollars annu­ally."

It's bnnn up and down sine(~ for the Cougars, who were last in the national spotlight when Andre Ware and David Klingler were racking up ridieulous pass­ing statisties in the late 19HOs and early '90s.

Dodger infighting escalates 
Bradletj says Kent does not knaw "haw to deal with African American people" 
Associated Press 
Millon Bradlny and Jnl'l' Kent an~ still at odds. Los Angeles l>odgt~rs manager .Jim Tracy and gnrwral manager Paul l>el'odesta wish they wertm 't­espncially now that Bradley has injeeted race into the equa­tion. 
Bradley accused Kent ol' a lack of leadership and an inability to deal with black playnrs in a 15-minute session with reporters at his locker bofore Tuesday night's R-3 vie­tory over tho Colorado Hoekies. 
Tho rnmarks came only a eouple or minutes after he said that the feud between the two that became public last week­end in Florida was a "dead issue." 
"The problem is, he doesn't know how to deal with African­American people," Bradley said. "I think that's what's causing everything. It's a pat­tern of things that have been said -things said ofT the culT that I don't intmpret as funny. It may be funny to him, but it's not funny to Milton Bradley. But I don't take ofl'ense to that bneause we all joke about race in here. Haee is an issue with evnrything we do in here. 
"Me being an African­Amerkan is the most impor­tant thing to me -more important than baseball," said the 27 -year-old center lielder, whose voiee never went beyond his normal speaking level. "White people never want to see race -with any­thing. But there's race involved in baseball. That's why there's less than 9 percent African­American representation in the game. I'm one of the few African-Americans that starts here." 

Bradley did not like what Kent said to him after he failed to score from first base on a double in Saturday's victory over the Florida Marlins. Bradley initiated a 25-minute closed-door meeting with Tracy after that game. 
"I was told in spring training I was the team leader -by Paul DePodesta. By Jim Tracy. By (team owner) Frank McCourt," Bradley said. "Growing up in L.A., I know how to deal with all types of people, and I do it on an every­day basis. But some people don't deal with all different types of people every day, and therefore don't know how to handle situations when they arise." 
DePodesta issued a state­ment after Tuesday's game, saying: "Everyone at the Los Angeles Dodgers is committed to winning. It has been a frus­trating season for all of us and our fans, as we have dealt with plenty of adversity. 
"We have a talented team of passionate players who take their performance -as well as the team's performance -per­sonally. Under the circum­stances, it is not unusual for players' emotions to run high. llowever, if and when any issue arises that runs contrary to the goals and values of the organi­zation, there should be no question that we address it."

West dovvns Southeast to advance to U.S. final 
Associated Press 
SOUTH WILLIAMSPOHT, Pa. -Talk about a net gain for Hancho Buena Vista. 
A disputed call went its way, and now the team from California is on the way to the United States title game at the Little League World Series. 
An apparent three-run home run by Maitland, Fla., was instead ruled a double, and that was the break Rancho Buena Vista needed in a 6-2 semifinal victory Wednesday night. 
"We play all year setting goals," Rancho Buena Vista manager Marty Miller said. "Now our goal is to get to the [World Series] championship game." 
In an international semifinal game Wednesday, Japan was an 11­is very easy to make a eall after seeing a replay at various angles. Even Major League Baseball umpires make mis­takes." 
Cash refused to let Ouellet oil' the hook. 
"For him not to come out and look at it, he has no basn ealls to make," Cash said. 
Miller was too busy celebrat­ing -and talking about poten­tial U.S. championship game opponents -to worry about the call. 
"I really don't want to gel into the umpire situation," he said. "The tape will speak for itself."

The controversial play came in the bottom of the third with Maitland down 2-0. 
With two runners on and two out, Mike Tomlinson laced a line drive off winning pitcher Kalen Pimentel that hit about a foot up the netting attached to the left­field foul pole, hit the top of the wall and bounced back into play. 
Tomlinson thought he home­red, but the umps immediately ruled the hit a two-run double. Maitland manager Sid Cash dashed out to argue, but -with­out the benefit of replay -the call was not reversed. 
"It just hurt the momentum for us," Cash said. "I think if we're up 3-2, we'd have the lead and then see how they'd respond. It has an affect on everything." 
Little League spokesman Lance Van Auken issued a state­ment of support for left field umpire Steve Ouellet, saying, "It a double. 
Maitland threat­ened again in the fourth, putting runners on first and second with one out, but left them stranded. 
The lost home run was too much for Maitland to overcome. 
"We needed 1hat momentum to make them come after us," Cash said. 
Hancho Buena Vista (4-0) scored three runs in the sixth to seal its 24th straight win. 
Pimento!, who has two grand slams and tied a Little League World Series record for a six­inning game with 18 strikeouts, struck out nine and walked two in a complete game. 
Dante Biehette Jr. took the loss for Maitland, giving up six runs -four earned -and striking out four in 5 1-:~ innings. 
Maitland coaches Dante Biehettn and Mike Stanley never won a World Series champi­onship in the major leagues and they're going to have to wait to win one in Little League.

"I think that with a week and 


a half to go, ... we have the foundation set that we can go ahead and game plan each week," Weis said. 
With ten starters returning on offense, Weis has plenty of talent to go around. One chal­lenge that comes with this lux­ury is to find the right position for each player. Rashon Powers-Neal, for example, has moved from fullback to run­ning back in hopes of finding a better fit in the offense. The running back spot is already crowded with Darius Walker, Travis Thomas and Justin Hoskins in the mix. The addi­tion of Powers-Neal leaves Weis with what could be too much talent. 
"I think that we have enough offense [already installed] ... in that we understand who our personnel is," Weis said. "There is still a little jockeying between a second or third guy ... how are we going to rotate people?" 
Notre Dame offensive coordi­nator and running backs coach Michael Haywood believes having a large number of quality players, especially run­ning backs, is always an asset. 
"I think Darius [Walker] has the ability to be one of the finest running backs in the country," Haywood said. "But at the same time I think that we have other quality backs

Brewing up honors 
Lauren Brewster looks to lead the Irish deep into the NCAAs 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
Lauren Brewster doesn't lis­ten to any out-of-the-ordinary music to prep her for big games. She doesn't showboat much on the court. And she isn't the loudest person on the Notre Dame volleyball team. So what sets her apart from her teammates? 
Her play, her leadership and her humility. 
"] think that in the past l've tried more to lead by example, but that's one of the things that I know I need to work on, to be more of a vocal leader," Brewster said. "[Sophomore setterI Ashley Tarutis, on our team, does a great job of that." 
Brewster, a 6-foot-3 senior middle blocker, has developed into one the nation's top all­around players. 
She is the Big East preseason player of the year and along with fellow senior Meg I lenican

NO ATHLETICS Svvanagan appointed to vvork vvith students 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Former Notre Dame men's basketball captain Harold Swanagan has been named coordinator of student welfare and development at Notre Dame, the University announced Wednesday. 
Swanagan, who served as an intern with the basketball team's strength and conditioning program during the 2004-05 school year, accepted the new position Friday. 
He will work directly with Charmelle Green, director of the student-athlete develop­ment and welfare program, to get athletes involved in commu­nity service and rewarded for academic success, among other goals. 

"To me it's like coaching, but it's coaching kids on life," Swanagan said Wednesday night. 
The Student Development program focuses on five areas in providing a balanced experi­ence for student-athletes at Notre Dame: academic excel­lence, athletic success, career preparation, community involvement and personal development. 
lt teaches skills that land for­mer Division-! athletes like Swanagan, a former Big East Academic All-Star, in jobs out­side the realm of a specific sport. 
''I'll be teaching athletes that there's something outside the arena," he said.
