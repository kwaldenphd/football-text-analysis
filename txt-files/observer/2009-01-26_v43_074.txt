School officials estimated 3, 700 students, many of whom had camped out the night before in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse, attended the event. 
"It was a real exciting experience that showcased the school well," junior Dallas Frey said. "The

Eleven seminarians from Old College and Moreau Seminary took a trip this weekend to Mundelein Seminary, north of Chicago, to compete in the eigth annu­al basketball tournament between nine Midwest semi­naries called the "Mundelein Seminary Shootout." 
The team won three out of four games, and ended up winning the consolation bracket of the tournament. 
Sophomore and seminarian candidate Mike Palmer said the weekend is not just about basketball, but is also a chance to get to know other 
seminarians. 

"All the seminaries we play against are from the Midwest region ... and it's really great to have meals and socials together with other seminari­ans," Palmer said. "It's g,reat to have brotherhood with other [seminarians] and just fun to play some basketball. We are there to compete but to have fun as well." 
The 11 seminarians along with their supporters left for the tournament Friday and competed Friday and Saturday. 
Palmer said the team usu­ally includes seminarians both from Old College and Moreau Seminary, but this

Society has grown from five to 150 students from all majors, backgrounds 
By ALYSSA MORONES 
News Writer 
When Notre Dame junior political science major Jaime Urquijo, attended his first EntreprPneurship Society meet­ing as a freshman, the club was comprised of barely more than five students. Just two years later, club meetings have an average attendance of over 150 students and the club continues to work to bring in more stu­dents of all majors. 
Notre Dame's Entrepreneurship Society was founded by Notre Dame senior and club co-president Mark Bennett during his sophomore year. 
His first step was to write a 32-page mission statement. "It was a little raw," Be1mett said, "and not all ofit worked." 
In spite of the club's initial rough start, Bennett continued to recruit talented and passion­ate students to help realize his dreams for the club's future. 
"Entrepreneurial leadership is a noble pursuit," Bennett said. "It can change lives and

Although the art galler1es in the Moreau Art Center and the Student Center at Saint Mary's usually feature art by profes­sional, contemporary artists or students throughout .the course of the academic year, faculty members get the chance to show their talent once every four years. 
The faculty art exhibit will be exhibited in the Sister Rosaire and Little Theatre Galleries until Feb. 27. 
This exhibition features work from six members of the art department: Julie Tourtillotte, Bill Sandusky, Kelly Harrington, Sandra Ginter, Sheilah Wilson, and Marcia Rickard. 
Rickard is not a professional artist. Her art is based on the experience she gained while on a trip to Sri Lanka with other faculty members during a cease­fire in 2004. 
"We visited women's groups, orphanages, schools, etc. in both rebel and government territory," Rickard said. 'There is heavy in fighting in Sri Lanka now and news reports are sketchy, but clearly there are many killed and many refugees -probably some women that we met. My piece in the show is for them." 
Unlike Rickard, Harrington has been an artist for as long as

College to perform Monologues 


SMC shows fifth annual production 
By ALICIA SMITH 
News Writer 
For the fifth year in a row, Saint Mary's College will present "SMC Monologues," a production based off Eve Ensler's "Vagina Monologues," but containing stories written by Saint Mary's students. 
Ensler's production brings women's sexuality to the forefront, and the "SMC Monologues" intend to do the same. 
"Students have wanted to facilitate discussion about topics relevant to women's sexuality because of the many students' commitment to the goal of raising aware­ness about issues related to sexual assault," said Catherine Pittman, Saint Mary's psychology professor and advisor to the SMC Monologues. 
Each story is submitted anonymously, and could be about anything from sexuali­ty to what it means to be a Saint Mary's woman. 
"At Saint Mary's College, we encourage women to speak up, to write, to be bold and adventurous and that's what the "SMC Monologues" is all about," Pittman said. 
The "SMC Monologues" allow Saint Mary's women to

Yo-YoMaand 

the Fun List 
I checked Yo-Yo Ma off my list a week ago, but now I've got to put him back on. 
One of the many perks of witnessing the swearing-in of the 44th president last Tuesday was getting to see the world­renown cellist play live in a quartet. 
The sounds of Ma's cello, of Itzhak Perlman's violin,

ed from the U. S. Capitol building to my spot standing across the Reflecting Pool last Tuesday. The John Williams piece, "Air and Simple Gifts," was the most beautiful com­position I had ever heard live. 
Or so I thought. 

Two days after I returned from Washington, the New York Times published a story revealing that the elegant notes I had heard were not traveling from the strings of Yo-Yo Ma's cello to my ears. 
Due to forecasts of cold weather on the day of the inauguration, the quartet had made a recording of their performance two days earlier at the Marine Barracks in Washington. They decided to use the record­ing on the day of the ceremony because the musicians feared intonation problems and cracked instruments or strings. 
The quartet played along with the record­ing, but only those near them could hear the live music. 
I heard only the recording. So Yo-Yo Ma goes back on my list, the inventory of fun things I want to do before I die. 
Checking off Yo-Yo Ma would have been huge. He's performing at a concert hall near my hometown in March, but tickets are already sold out. So he'll probably be on the list for a while: 
u See Yo-Yo Ma perform. Live. 
u Scuba dive 
u Run a marathon. 

u Complete a crossword puzzle. Without using the Internet. 
u Do a triathlon. 
u Write a book. 

u Beat the Graduate School team at Late Night Olympics water polo. u Swim with dolphins. u Call into Delilah's radio show with a true story of love and loss and a song request. 
u Be an extra in a movie. 
u Hike the Great Wall of China. 
u Live in a foreign country. 
u Plant/maintain a garden. 
u Sew something that I could plausibly wear. u Go to an inaugural ball. A real one. u Surf. u Have a cocktail with Maureen Dowd. u Go to Australia's Outback u Celebrate New Year's in Times Square u See the pyramids in Egypt. u Win trivia night at Legends. u Visit the Oval Office. u Meet the Dancing Matt guy from the YouTube videos. 
u Win an organized ping pong competi­tion. u Bike to work. u Beat my brother at chess. u Tan. u Be someone's Missed Connection on

turnout by the student body was definitely the most surprising part for me." ­
Students began filing into the Joyce arena from the Fieldhouse at 9 a.m., and the general public was admitted at 10 a.m. Numerous ESPN personalities commented on the size and enthusiasm of the Notre Dame student body. Students also said they could feel the excitement in the air. 
"We have great school spirit, probably the best in the country, but maybe some people on the basketball side didn't know that," Frey sitid. "And I think that myself and a lot of Notre Dame students took pride in the fact that we looked good and we had so many people out there for the Saturday-morning show." 
Junior Doug Hummon said Saturday's festivities made the day feel more like a home foot­ball game than basketball game. 
"It was electric, really," he said. "The atmosphere was great. I've never seen that kind of support outside offootball." 
When the show started at 11 a.m., hosts Rece Davis, Bob Knight, Jay Bilas, Hubert Davis and former Irish basketball coach Digger Phelps discussed college basketball news from around the country and previewed Saturday's slate of games. The crowd cheered for Phelps and booed the Duke graduate Bilas who earlier in the week said the Joyce was not an intimidating venue to play in as an opposing team. Phelps also played the part of cheerleader, revving up the crowd starting several cheers. 

"It was fun having Digger [Phelps] pumping everyone up," Hummon said. 
The student body also respond­ed to the analysts' on-air com­ments. When one of them sug­gested that North Carolina for­ward Tyler Hansbrough might be the toughest player in college basketball, the crowed responded with boos and a chant of "Harangody," in support of Notre Dame center Luke Harangody. 
Fans were also allowed to make signs to hold up behind the hosts during the show. Some signs were pro-Irish, such as _one that said "McAlarney's Shooting School Open for Business," but many were anti-Connecticut. _one such sign said, "Thabeet = Gody's Pre-dinner Snack," in reference to Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet, who months ago said that Harangody was "not that tough." 
Frey said his favorite sign was one that said "Fighting for 46," which referred to the Irish home winning streak that ended at 45 on Saturday night. 
"Even though it ended at 45, I think our team was fighting for 46, and the fans were certainly fighting for 46," Frey said. 
Towards the end of the show, a Notre Dame student was given the chance to win $17,500 from State Farm on a half-court shot. Unfortunately, the shot fell short of the hoop. 
Students said that Gameday's presence on campus only ampli­fied the excitement for what was already a big-time match-up. 
"It increased the atmosphere by getting people exciting earlier in the day and really building it up and hyping it up as much as possible," Frey said. "Even 20 to 25 minutes before tip-off when we were chanting 'Let's go, Irish', it seemed like we were at a fever pitch and ready to go." 
Even though the Irish lost, 69­61, in Saturday night's game, stu­dents said they would still look back on the Gameday experience with fond memories. 
"I mean it does matter that we lost," sophomore Kelly Pierson said. "But I'll still remember it as a good experience."

And it wasn't just ciprofloxacin being detected. The supposedly cleaned water was a floating medicine cabinet -a soup of 21 different active pharmaceutical ingredients, used in generics for treatment of hyperten­sion. heart disease, chronic liver ailments, depression, gonorrhea, ulcers and other ail­ments. Half of the drugs measured at the highest levels of pharmaceuticals ever detected in the environment, researchers say.

The members of a skiing and mountaineering club were taking part in an annual winter sports celebration on 7,200-foot (2,200-meter) Mount Zigana. Seventeen were hiking single-file when the avalanche swept into them.

Pennsylvania fires destroy 15 homes 
COATESVILLE -The latest in a string of suspicious fires in this Philadelphia suburb tore through a block of row houses, damag­ing 15 homes, leaving several dozen people homeless and prompting city officials to declare a state of emergency. 
At least 30 arsons have been reported since the beginning of 2008, about half of them in the last three weeks. Police said the blazes may be part of a gang initiation, but there was no clear information who was committing the crimes or why. 
The latest fire was reported late Saturday at the rear of one house and quickly spread to adjacent homes in the Chester County community. 
"This is an arson, no question about it," City Manager Harry Walker said Sunday.

Blagojevich will not participate in trial 

Illinois governor is aware of impending conviction but refuses to resign

SPRINGFIELD -If there's such a thing as a "normal" impeachment trial, the one that starts Monday in Illinois doesn't qualifY. 
The defendant, Gov. Rod Blagojevich, won't partici­pate. He'll be talking to Whoopi Goldberg and Larry King instead of facing the state Senate. And while the Democrat acknowledges his conviction is certain, he refuses to resign. 
Blagojevich (pronounced blah:GOY'-uh-vich) com­plains that the trial rules are unfair, but he and his lawyers didn't try to influence the rules as they were written or afterward. 
After weeks of near-silence, Blagojevich has begun an energetic public relations campaign, comparing himself to the hero of a Frank Capra movie and a cowboy being lynched for a crime he didn't commit. 
He told NBC's "Today" that when he was arrested on fed­eral corruption charges, he took solace from thinking of other jailed leaders -Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. 
He also said his 5-year-old daughter, Annie, has asked whether he'll still be gover­nor on her birthday in April.

lie does not like to refer to it as a business club. Instead, the club aims to instill in its member an e !1trepreneurial mentality. 
"We try to encourage non-busi­ness majors to join," Urquijo said. "We're looking for a diverse group of students with very different ideas and backgrounds. Anybody c rn be an entrepreneur." 
The club's leaders are looking to surpass Stanford and Oxford's Entrepreneurial Societies, both of '"'hich have more than 3,000 members. 
"We can learn from Oxford and Stanford, even just their recruiting structure," said sophomore Dominic Fanelli, who is in charge of recruitment for the club. 
Fanelli and other club members continue to recruit new members with their "road show," where they present the Entrepreneurship Society to various Notre Dame lec­1ure classes. 
The club currently undertakes tetween 40 and 50 projects and events per year. These inelude social entrepreneurial projects, such as their consulting and serv­iee projects, where club members give their opinions and advice to lJcal entrepreneurs. This gives students the opportunity to get basic hands on experience. 
The society is hoping to launch a national magazine called "Type­
F" 
"This would be used as a tool for ~ tudents to write and share their perspective and would be a valu­able tool for employers who want 1o know about our generation," Bennett said. 
Club members are given a chance to participate in Case Bowl, where groups research and give a presentation on a certain compa­

Along with various projects, the club's leaders arranged CEO din­ners and keynote speakers to present the society with a short presentation and allow for ques­tions. One of these speakers was Tom Suddes, a Notre Dame alum­nus who has founded 19 compa­nies and raL'ied over a billion dol­lars for non-profit organizations. 
"We hope that these presenta­tions are inspiring," Bennett said. "They show the students that the people who accomplish remark­able things are normal people who lived a very similar lifestyle to them in college." 
The club's leaders hope to give students experiences they would­n't usually have -to give them the chance to meet people and make contacts and, by allowing students of varying majors to work together, to expose them to new perspectives.

Bennett and Urquijo hope that through the Entreproneurship Society, they can convey their sense of idealist entrepreneurship. 
"We're working very hard to instill the same vision in others," Urquijo said, "to pass it along to the next group of leaders."

Lawmakers: casinoscanhelp budgets 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -A tell-tale sign America's chips are down: States are increasingly turning to gambling to plug budget holes. 
Proposals to allow or expand slots or casinos are percolating in at least 14 states, tempting legislators and governors at a time when many must deeide between cutting services and raising taxes. 
Gambling has hard-core detractors in every state, but when the budget-balancing alternatives lawmakers must consider include reducing edu­cation funding or lifting sales taxes, resistance is easier to overcome, political analysts said. 
"Who wouldn't be interested if you're a politician who needs to fund programs'?" said Bo Bernhard, director of research at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas-a govern­ment-funded program. 
While gambling has not been immune from the recession, it has held up relatively well compared with states' other revenue streams, such as income and sales taxes. This helps explain why past industry growth spurts have been pre­ceded by eeonomie downturns, experts said. 
For example, Hhode Island opmwd the country's tirst raco­tra(~k casino in 1992, and four states soon followed. More recently, states faced with sag­ging rovenues during the 2001 recession joined multistate lot­teries such as Powerball and gave more )noway to NativP American tribes seeking to expand their easinos. 
Analysts say the latest round of gambling initiatives are noteworthy in volume and ambition -a sign that the industry aims to capitalize on states' badly bruised economies. 
"From the gambling indus­try's point of view, this is their big chance," said Earl Grinols, an economies professor at Baylor University who special­izes in gambling. 
Ohio's casino advocates, including lobbyists working for Penn National Gambling Inc., are pushing a variety of large­scale development projects. In Georgia, a developer working with Dover Downs Inc., wants to transform a blighted section of downtown Atlanta with a 29­story hotel that would attract tourists with more than 5,500 video lottery terminals. 
The developer pitching the $450 million Atlanta project, Dan O'Leary, estimates $300 million a year in revenues would be funneled to the state, helping to pay for a popular lottory-funded seholarship that provides in-state college tuition for students with "B" averages. 
Even Hawaii, which along with Utah is onn of two states without a lottery or other form of legalized gambling, may con­sider a change. Aides to Gov. Linda Lingle, long an opponent of gambling, say she is open to discussing it as a way to dose the state's growing budget gap. 
Gambling propotwnts are quick to tout its bells and whis­tles: a $54 billion annual indus­try that employs more than 350,000 people, with most state gambling revenues com­ing from lotteries, racetracks and betting devices such as slot and video poker machines. Twelve states reap tax money from full-fledged casinos, and 23 others have casinos on Native American reservations, which generally do not pay taxes to states. 
But while advocates argue that casinos will help attract jobs and revitalize downtrod­den areas, religious groups and other critics fear gambling has a disproportionately negative impact on lower-income peo­ple, and does not provide long­term economic growth. 
They point to research that shows casinos attract crime, foster gambling addiction prob­lems and divert money from other businesses. 
"We've got gambling in 48 states, and you'd think if it worked, you wouldn't have budget problems or education problems," said Tom Gray, a field director for StopPredatoryGambling.org. 
Many of the gambling pro­posals seek to expand footholds in states that already allow lim­ited gambling. 
Kentucky's House speaker had proposed allowing video gambling terminals at the state's racetracks, and legisla­tors in New Hampshire, New York and Texas are seeing pro­posals this year to allow similar gambling terminals at their tracks. Casino advocates plan to push for casino-style gam­bling in hurricane-ravaged Galveston, Texas, as well. 
Lawmakers in other states are talking about reversing hard-fought crusades to tighten restrictions on gambling. 
Nine years after South Carolina lawmakers outlawed video poker, state Sen. Robert Ford is fighting to make it legal again. Since July, lawmakers have cut roughly $1 billion from the state's budget to address revenue shortfalls.

IN BRIEF 

Governors seek con~ons from unions 
COLUMBUS -Governors across the nation are seeking significant concessions from pub­lic employee unions in hopes of h_elping to bal­ance their teetering budgets during the eco­nomic downturn. 
From Maryland to California, Ohio to Hawaii, governors have asked or ordered state workers to accept furloughs, salary reduc­tions, truncated workweeks or benefit cuts. They say the concessions are a better alterna­tive to further job losses in the face of record­breaking unemployment. 
Unions argue their members shouldn't be singled out and are even more vital in hard times -securing neighborhoods and prisons, educating children and providing social servic­es to growing numbers of citizens. 
In hard-hit Ohio, Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland has been a friend of the unions. But as the state's budget woes have intensified, he is asking unionized state employees to consid­er a 5 percent pay cut, a 35-hour workweek and the elimination of paid personal days and holidays, to save the state hundreds of millions of dollars. 

Hudson River plane hit a soft body 
WASHINGTON -A visual inspection of the battered, dented left engine of the US Airways jetliner that ditched in the Hudson River found no evidence of organic matter, but there are signs the plane hit a soft body, federal investiga­tors say. 
This engine and the right engine, which remained attached to the Airbus A-320 after the Jan. 15 ditching, will be shipped to their manu­facturer, CFM International, in Cincinnati for thorough examination by safety board investiga­tors. Both engines will be completely torn down to examine damage, and advanced equipment will be used to search for organic material not apparent during visual inspection. 
The pilot reported the plane hit a flock of birds shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport which shut down both his jets. 
National Transportation Safety Board investi­gators said Saturday they visually examined the left engine after it was finally pulled 65 feet from the river bottom but saw no evidence of organic material. 

Lobbyists skirt Obama's earmark ban 
Interest groups finding ways to avoid ban, continue giving money to projects 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON­President Barack Obama's ban on earmarks in the $825 billion economic stim­ulus bill doesn't mean inter­est groups, lobbyists and lawmakers won't be able to funnel money to pet proj­ects. 
They're just working around it -and perhaps inadvertently making the process more secretive. 
The projects run the gamut: a Metrolink station that needs building in Placentia, Calif.; .a stretch of beach in Sandy Hook, N.J., that could really use some more sand; a water park in Miami. 
There are tltousands of projects like those that once would have been gotten money upfront but now are lef't to scramble for dollars at the back end of the process as "ready to go" jobs eligible for the stimulus plan. 
The result, as The Associated Press learned in interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers, lobbyists and state and local officials, is a shadowy lobbying effort that may make it difficult to discern how hundreds of billions in federal money will be parceled out. 
'"No earmarks' isn't a game-ender," said Peter Buffa, former mayor of Costa Mesa, Calif.

Change, having come to Washington, now seems poised to redr~w the aca­demic landscape as well, and humani­ties scholars are worrying once again about the future of their discipline. Last Monday, Stanley Fish of the New York Times argued that higher education, driven by popular and administrative demand, is shifting irrevocably toward giving students useful, work-appli­cable skills and away from the "determined inutili­ty" of the humani­ties. The very next day, newly-minted President Barack Obama promised to "transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age." And since then, gradu­ate students and untenured faculty in the humanities began a new bout of soul-searching, wondering whether the life of the mind that they had signed up to live would be around by the time they reached their own professional maturity.. 
Publishing and rebutting pre­mortems of humanistic scholarship has almost become its own academic field. Critics on all sides suggest that schol­ars in the humanities are incapable of communicating the relevance of their work to anyone outside of their field, · that the American public is as too anti­intellectual to understand the humani­ties' value or that the liberal arts are simply incapable of being defined in terms of public significance. Whether or not Fish and company have overes­timated the decline of the humanities (probably) and whether or not the lib­eral arts will ever return to their pre­modern prominence (probably not), what is clear is that they are in dire need of a better PR campaign. 

In his inaugural address, President Obama talked about the nation's need not just for a new physical infrastruc­ture, but also a new digital one. Maybe the humanities need a similar electron­ic shot in the arm. No matter how irrelevant to most people's lives the most esoteric branches of physics, astronomy, math and so on are, their practitioners can still generate a lot more excitement-measured in terms of media attention, research dollars and general academic influence ­than all but the most famous philoso­phers or literary critics. Despite their shared potential for "inutility," howev­er, the humanities have not been any­where near as innovative as the hard sciences in the past few decades, espe­cially when it comes to integrating technology and computers with their research. ' 
Take the field of history, for example. Outside of their own field, historians feel the most comfortable borrowing from, and claiming to understand, other liberal arts -most notably liter­ary theory and postmodernism in the 1960s and beyond. Beyond that, histo­rians will occasionally double-dip in social science fields such as archaeolo­gy, anthropology, or medicine, with varying degrees of success and sensi­tivity depending on the particular area of study. By and large, however, histo­rians and scientists refuse to learn the particulars of each others' fields and are content to claim mutual unintelligi­bility. When it comes to technology, their record is even worse. As early as the 1950s, several prominent histori­ans predicted that future generations of historians would need to know pro­gramming in addition to the traditional tools of historical inquiry. Since then, while scientists have developed ·or adapted programs and programming languages from MATLAB to the uncountable thousands of proprietary ones for their own projects, historians have not shown very many signs of technological life. At most they simply use, or lend their expertise to, projects developed by libraries, companies and foundations, such as JSTOR, EndNote or Google Books. 
In short. historians opted for the path of least resistance, taking the lin­guistic but not the scientific (or compu­tational) turn, and by doing so have decided that they would simply benefit from, but not help advance, the Information Age. Instead of trying to use and develop technology on their own, they wait for others to develop technology and point out its usefulness to the academy. Instead of expanding the horizons of their field outside of the humanities, they hold the discipli­nary line. And so they continue to practice their craft in the same way that they have since the nineteenth century, even though the public no longer holds nineteenth century aca­demic interests or nineteenth century expectations for its intellectual com­munity. The price they are paying is apathy among the public, the academy at large and you, their students (and except for majors, how many among you would say that you would priori­tize your humanities requirements above all your other classes?). 
It may very well be the case that the humanities are in danger of total obscurity, and certainly purely human­istic studies are not ever going to be as privileged as they once were. But the problem is not that scholars of liberal arts are any less relevant than some scientific fields; it is simply that they alone in the academy have refused to reinvent their disciplines and restate their appeal for the 21st century in any significant way. Until they do so, the humanities may as well accept their reputation as an academic dinosaur.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dangers of denying fair trial 
With regard to Nathan Furtado's Jan. 23 letter titled "Objectivity, please," I agree with his main point that "objectivity is a cornerstone of journalistic integrity" and that The Observer should strive for it. However, I cannot agree with another, more subtle point made in his letter, in which he worries about "the dangers of providing unrepentant terrorists with civilian tri­als." 
1cannot imagine that he has been reading objective journalism if he actually believes a statement like that. Under the Constitution. all citizens are granted the right of habeas corpus, which means the right to a fair trial. This was said by Thomas Jefferson to be "[one of the] essential principles of our government." And yet, since the beginning of the "War on Terror," we have denied this right to assumed enemy combatants. There is no proof needed to .i_mprison these individuals and they do not have the right to an attorney or trial. 
Mr. Furtado-, if you are so sure that everyone in Guantanamo Bay is guilty of terrorism, why are you unwilling to grant them a trial to which we as citizens have the right? Surely the courts will prove them guilty as well. The truth is that while a number of the prisoners in Gitmo are terrorists, others are not. Many are only guilty of being Arab and in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think it would be disingenuous for us to call America "the land of the free" if we were to continue to leave the freedom of these individuals up to the discretion of an anonymous few. 
"The dangers" that Furtado associates with extending our rights to those we hold captive in  Cuba pale in comparison to the dang~rs that will arise if we do not, such as the risk of dishon­oring the document that gives our country integrity and moral grounding. In his inaugural address, President Obama stated that "we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals," which he corroborated by signing the order to close Guantanamo Bay. I hope that Mr. Furtado may also see that those two objectives do not have to be mutually exclusive.

Our big-eyed, bushy-tailed 
The winter months are well upon the students of Notre Dame. Snow falls incessantly, faces . disappear under mounds of scarves and campus squirrels run rampant. Some of my peers have suggested that the squirrels are simply poor, lost students; mutated victims of punish­ment via mysterious experiments in the depths of the radiation building. Some more astute sci­ence majors, however, can see the root of the problem: a classic case of an ecosystem imbal­ance. Overrun with noisy, hormonal class-goers, the squirrels have turned to violent revolt in an attempt to reclaim their ground. Joggers are attacked, muffins are stolen and nuts are thrown in the path of innocent wanderers in these daily acts of aggression. Some more desper­ate members of the squirrel cause have resorted to suicide missions, hurling themselves beneath the wheels of unsuspecting bicyclists. These acts of aggression are alarming and can­not stand. As a strictly entrepreneurial strategy, I know that souvenir squirrels would sell faster than monogrammed Snuggies. I fear, however, that such an exploitation of a group of creatures would only further disrupt their communities and increase their anger. 
The best and only solution to our problem is to work with nature, not against it. Students: Take action now to amend the DuLac dorm room pet clause to include not only "non-~arnivo­rous fish," but "locally displaced squirrel refugees" as well. Squirrels need homes, too.

Uphold Constitution 
Here at Notre Dame, it is currently rather unfashionable to express an opinion on subjects other than football, hot girls or pop cultural phenomena such as "J*zz in my Pants." Being at heart a timid young man, overly susceptible to peer pressure, I am naturally inclined to censor myself on a great number ofjust such socially unacceptable subjects. Further. my reputation as an easygoing man-about-town with a weakness for the fairer sex is at stake. Why compromise my carefully constructed persona by revealing myself to have thoughts and interests deeper than getting drunk and hooking up with girls on the weekends? 
Unfortunately, a letter one Nathan Furtado wrote to The Observer has so offended the part of my brain that is responsible for thinking that I cannot help revealing myself to have political opinions. I know that expressing such opinions is about as attractive to girls as a piece of spinach lodged between the front teeth. Therefore, I must respectfully request that any hot girls, or girls in which I have a prurient interest, stop reading this letter. Immediately. 
Mr. Furtado, the indirect denial of the existence of innocents at Guantanamo by speaking of the "unrepentant terrorists" lodged there represents more spin than the most biased liberal media outlet could possibly offer. Unless you've been living under a rock, you can­not be unaware that: a) Guantanamo has innocents, and b) we've been torturing them. And unlike controversies over whether the tax rate on the top tax bracket should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent, the question of whether or not torturing a few innocent people is okay is not open to debate. By the way, the reason people call Barack · Obama a socialist? He favors 39.6 percent. And what exactly are "the dangers of providing unrepentant terrorists with civilian tri­als"? Even the Nazis got habeas corpus. No matter which way you slice it, holding terrorists publicly accountable for their crimes is a hell of a lot better than torturing them. 
I find it hard to believe that we find ourselves in such a state of emergency that we can cavalierly dispense with the basic civil rights in the Constitution; I haven't exactly seen any bombs dropping over the Sears Tower or the Dome. And before you tell me that it was the Bush administration's hard-line stance on torture that has prevented further terrorist attacks, I fail to see why people who are not afraid of death would be deterred by the threat of a little waterboarding, a few electrified nipple clamps, or (gasp!) watching books get flushed down toilets. 
The real partisans here, Mr. Furtado, are not the law professors who applauded the closing of what represents at the very least the worst publicity the US has received since Vietnam. They are people like you who, through spin and distortion, handwave away or out­right deny cold, sober facts like the existence of tortured innocents in Guantanamo, global warming and evolution. Married to their the­ories of the way the world should work, they fail to take into account the way the world does work; and the sorry state of our economy and reputation at home and abroad is what we have to show for it. 
That's the end of my rant. I implore. my harder-partying peers, who find themselves unencumbered with the baggage of an intellectual life when chatting up the carefully bronzed women of this campus, not to judge me too harshly; and I sincerely hope that the girls can overlook my transgression of propriety and continue to see me as an easygoing, devil-may-care sex object.

The nominations for this year's Academy Awards emerged last week and it seem<> that the criticism sUITounding the selections is significant­ly more present than in recent years past. Best Picture nominations went to many deserving films, aJbeit films that everyone expected to gar­ner .nominations. Films such as "Milk" or "Frost/Nixon" could be nominated for Osca.rs sim­ply because of their trailers, historical dran1as, great performances, and successful directors. What the academy needs is to reinvigorate the film fan, to reform the interest in movies that seems to be on a decline. 
In spite of its flaws, "Benjamin Button" was put together extremely well. The artistic aspect of the film was excellent, and the technology used to make Brad Pitt age in reverse was stunning. "Benjamin Button" was also the most nominated film, and it gained nominations in evecy major category. Instead of stroking the collective ego of the academy community they should reward the films that teach, the actors that emote, directors who look outside of the standard awards scope and produce a film that is unique, memorable, and challenges the audience. "Slumdog Millionaire" and "Milk" are the only films that were nominated this year that brought something different R!ld new to the table. The remaining nominees are a film about the holocaust, 'The Reader," a love story drama, "Benjamin Button," and a historical drama, "Frost/Nixon." No doubt all films of quality, but not films of substance, or ot'lasting significance. 
The films that left out of any contention were "The Dark Knight," "The Wrestler," and "Gran Torino." Take "The Dark Knight," a film iliat was taken very seriously publicly, was hailed by crit­ics, and, above all, surpassed every expectation and elevated the superhero genre. Still, there were no nominations for the dire<tor, Christopher Nolan, who masterfully crafted iliis epic contribu­tion, no doubt a film tllat will be talked about for years to come. Despite memorable performances, the only significant nomination for the film was a supporting actor nod to Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger was a good tllird of ilie film. if not half, and yet he is only given a supporting actor nomi­nation. 
"The Wrestler" was snubbed too. The director, 
,Darren Aronofsky ("Requiem for a Dream," "The Fm.mtain,") took a chance easting Miekey Rourke. It wasn't going to be the box office smash it could ' have been if Nicholas Cage had remained in the role, but it was meant to be a comeback film for the motivated and talented Mickey Rourke. It was a labor oflovc and tllis is obvious, but appllf­ently not obvious to the academy, which only nominated Hourke for best actor but left the film and director out of eontention. The academy also managed to over look the films musical merits, whieh are found in the original song by Bruce Springsteen written for the film. · 
"Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood's latest attempt was also obviously a labor of love for the actor/directo1·. Despite a weak supporting cast, Eastwood was able to carry ilie ii.Im, and he was both entertaining 1md crafted an emotional tale of . gang violence and family. He did not receive any nominations for his memorable performanc~ despitd the popularity among fans and critics 
alike. 

As there are many snubs, there are also charming revelations and perhaps even hope for the Academy within some of their other nomina­tions. Robert Downey Jr., controversially played an· actor who changed the color of his skin to· effectively portray a black Vietnam War officer. . It's both entertaining and enlightening that Downey garnered a nomination for this very silly role. Though the nomination is nothing more ilian a novelty, it shows that perhaps the acade­my isn't simply a collection of out of touch retirees. 
The academy needs to branch m~t. It needs to reward those who innovate, those who craft with love, and iliose for who are simply joyful in fulfill­ing their film industry dreams. The purpose of a film should not be to collect various awards. A film should be madfl to entertain. to be enjoyed, to teach and to provide the artists of tllis world with a way to share their talent. The Academy Awards should reward those who achieve these goals, who go abo-.e and beyond great filmmak­ing. It should reward iliose who truly Jove their work. It should recognize iliose who realize iliat creating reels of cinematic brilliance is the only reward necessary.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Joe Torre takes some harsh swings at Alex Rodriguez, Brian Cashman and the New York Yankees in a book due out early next month, according to New York newspaper reports. 
"The Yankee Years" reveals that Rodriguez was called "A-Fraud" by his teammates and the star slugger developed an obsession with short­stop Derek Jeter, the New York Post and the Daily News reported Sunday. 
Torre, who managed 
the Yankees from J996­2007 before taking over the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, also says he was betrayed by Cashman, New York's longtime general man­ager, the Daily News reported on its Web site. 
Torre had a hot-and­cold rt:llationship with Yankees ownership, including George Steinbrenner, but Cashman was thought to be a consistent ally. The GM did not immediately return a phone message from The Associated Press. 
The book, co-authored by Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci, is due out Feb. 3 and is being pub­lished by Doubleday. It is not a first-person· account but instead a third-person narrative by Verducci based on dozens of interviews with Yankees players and employees, ESPN .com reported, cit­ing an unidentified source. 
In the book, Torre also says Steinbrenner learned the manager had prostate cancer (during spring training 1999) before Torre even had a chance to inform him. 
Torre guided the Yankees to the postsea­son in all 12 years as manager and won four World Series titles from 1996-2000. But he was offered a one-year con­tract with a pay cut after the 2007 season, following New York's third straight first­round playoff exit. 
Torre turned down the proposal, saying he felt insulted by the offer of bonuses based on post­season performance. He soon agreed to a three­year contract with the Dodgers and led them to the NL championship series last year before they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Phillies, who went on to win the World Series. 

IN BRIEF Seton Hall stuns No. 
12 Georgetown 65-60 
NEWARK, N.J.-Seton Hall celebrat­ed its first Big East victory of the season on the same day it honored its team that almost won it all 20 years ago. 
"We talked for a couple of days with the kids about carving a piece of the pie for themselves," Pirates coach Bobby Gonzalez said of the hoopla surround­ing the return of the 1988-89 team that lost to Michigan in overtime in the national championship game. "We felt we could get one." 
They did by gutting out a 65-60 victo­ry over No. 12 Georgetown on Sunday to snap a six-game losing streak. 
"We scratched and clawed and fought and made it a blood-and-guts possession game. We were desperate for it and pulled it out," Gonzale:z; said. 'The '89 team brought some magic to the building and gave us a great atmos­phere." 
The reunion certainly didn't bring any long-range shooting success to either team.

By DOUGLAS FARMER Sports Writer 

In their first scored meet of the year, both Notre Dame track teams scored 181 points, and both took first place. The other schools men's and women's teams also posted identical marks as Michigan State took second, 
Wisconsin  third  and  
Marquette  placed  fourth.  
Friday's  Notre  Dame  

Invitational saw many Irish athletes qualify for the Big ~st Championships in less than a month. 
In the men's 800-meter race, five Irish qualified for the Big East Championships, led by junior Jack Howard, who finished third in the race with a time of 1:50.84, and junior Jim Notwell, finishing fourth in 1:51.99. 
Five more Notre Dame ath­letes qualified for the confer­ence Championships in the men's weight throw. Sophomore Greg Davis took fourth, and freshmen Mitchell Gormley's throw earned him fifth, with distances of 16.93 meters and 16.78 meters, respectively. 
The Irish men qualified four individuals in the 1600-meter run as senior Dan Clark fin­ished second with a time of 
4:07.63. Freshmen Jordan Carlson crossed the line right behind him in third with a time of 4:08.63.

Senior Bill Buzaid and junior Balazs Molnar took third and fourth in the 500­meters, in times of 1:03.45 and 1:04.58, respectively. 
The all around success for the Irish men's team promises a bright future. 
"The meet showed we really arn a complete team this year," Buzaid said. ''I'm not saying there aren't outstand­ing individual performances on the team this year. There are great athletes. We have a real balanced team and it will be exciting to go to the Big East Championships and see what we can do as a team." 
The Irish women were led by a brilliant performance by junior Joanna Schultz. Schultz took third in the 60­meters, first in the 200­meters, and first in the 400­meters, qualifying in both the 200-meters and the 400­meters. 
Senior Mary Saxer contin­ued her strong season as she followed her qualifying pole vaults of last week with a strong performance in the long jump. Her second place jump of 5.57 meters earned her a slot at the Big East Championships as well.

The No. 30 Irish earned a ~· -0 victory over the Tribe of William and Mary on ~;aturday, and then dropped a 7-0 decision against No. 5 Virginia on Sunday. 
After dropping their season opener last Sunday to Pepperdine, the Irish were able to bounce back on Saturday and earn their first ''ictory of the season.

Squads post two wins each in NY 
By CHRIS MASOUD Sports Writer 

Making good on his promise earlier in the week that the team would be ready for its intercollegiate opener, head coach Janusz Bednarski and the Irish fencing team emerged victorious at the St. John's University Duals and the New York University Invitational. 
The men and women fencers combined to post a 4-0 record as they opened their seasons at the SJU Duals in Jamaica, New York. The No.1 Irish men rolled past No. 4 Columbia 17-10, fol­lowed by a deeisive victory over No. 9 St. John's 18-9. 
The Irish were equally suc­cessful on the women's side as the No. 2 women cruised by No. 4 Columbia-Barnard 18-9, before defeating St. John's by a margin of 18-9. 
Led by freshman foiler Enzo Castellani, who amassed five victories in his Irish debut, the men's win over St. John's was the 1,200th in program history. Senior Bill Thanhouser and sophomore Avery Zuck each went 2-0 in the sabre division as they piloted the Irish to a 6-3 mark in the weapon. 
Highly touted freshman Courtney Hurley kicked ol'f her Notre Dame career with six wins on the day in the epee. Older sister Kelley Hurley and Ewa Nelip each posted 3-0 marks, while Hayley Reese led the women in the foil. 
The fencers carried momen­tum from Saturday's impressive performance into the NYU Invitational. 
The women's team finished Sunday with a record of 3-2 and an overall record of 5-2 against an impressive field. 
The lady fighters were anchored by sophomore Eileen Hassett and senior Adrienne Nott, posting 10 sabre wins and eight foil wins respectively. 
Competing against the best squads in the country, the men's team lived up to its pre­season ranking by finishing 5-0 on the day for a perfect 7-0 start to the season. 
Crossing sabers against NYU (21-6), No.3 Ohio State (15-12), Stevens Tech (22-5), Columbia (15-12), and Yale (23-4), the young core once again carried the men to victory. 
Continuing his hot streak, Zuck led the way for the men with a 9-1 mark on the day in the men's sabre. Sophomores Jacob Osborne and Andrew Seroff each had seven wins in the epee weapon.

A good start to a season does not insure a good finish, but it docs bode well. In their season opener on Sunday, No. 17 Notre Dame defeated No. 32 Ohio State 6-1 at Ohio State. 
The Irish wanted to open the season with a victory to build some momentum and to over-

come any initial mental blocks. 
The match opened with dou­bles play. The nation's number one-ranked doubles pair, Notre Dame's own senior Kelcy Tefft and freshmen Kristy Frilling, won 8-3. The pair has only been playing together since this fall, yet obviously show great promise. 
"The two of us gelled really well from the beginning," Tefft said. ''I'm excited beea use I· think we will only improve as the semester continues." 
The Irish split the two remaining doubles matches with the Buckeyes. Junior Colleen Riellcy and freshmen Shannon Matthews earned an 8-2 victory, while Juniors Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik suffered an 8-6 defeat. 
As for the singles, the Irish performed very well across the board. Matthews won easily, 6­3, 6-2. Krisik did so as well with scores of 6-2, 7-5. Sophomore Kristin Hafael won handily in the four-spot, 6-1, 6-3. 
Tefft prevailed 6-1, 6-3, and finally Frilling fought to a 7-5, 3-6, 1-0 (10-6) triumph. 
The sole Buckeyes point came as Hielley was defeated by Ohio State's Angela DiPastina 6-2, 6-3.

For the second time in a little more than a month the Belles defeated the Thunder of Trine University Saturday. The 69-58 win moved Saint Mary's to 8-1 at the top of the MIAA Conference. 
The win keeps Saint Mary's tied for first place in the confer­ence with Hope also having one loss. 
"In this league you can't over­look anyone," Belles coach Jen Henley said. "Records and standings never truly indicate the strength of a team." 
The loss dropped Trine to 4-5 in conference play, which puts them in sixth place in the con­ference after Adrian defeated

Villanova pulls off upset 
3-point shooting leads underdog Wildcats past favored ND team 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Editor 
Villanova's three 3-pointers in the flrst four minutes established a trend: the Wildcats ·would shoot threes until they were stopped. 

They kept making them, and their long-range shooting upset No. 13 Notre Dame, 55-48, Saturday at The Pavilion in Villanova, Pa. Villanova shot 37 percent from 3-point range and finished with 10 threes in the game. 
"That's their game," Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. "I actually thought we did a decent job holding them to 55 points." . 
Notre Dame dropped to 15-3,

ND doubfes vvin total in final meet at home 
Seniors lead the way as team sweeps at the Shamrock Invitational 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's swim­ming and diving team doubled its win total for the season with a sweep in the Shamrock Invitational at the Holfs Aquatic Center this weekend. 
The Irish improved to 6-6 on the season with wins over Denver, Miehigan State and West Virginia. 
The wins wore a big lift for the Notre Dame squad, which had yet to earn a win in 2009 entering the weekend. 
"The meet tonight was extremely good for the team," Irish coach Tim Welsh said after the final session on Saturday night. 
Although the Irish defeated both the Spartans and Mountaineers by more than 90 points, the Irish needed four victories in their last two ses­sions to seal a 10 point win over Denver. The clincher came when the Notre Dame relay team of senior Jeff Wood, jun­iors John Lyttle and Andrew Hoffman, and sophomore Joshua Nosal finished first in the 400 freestyle relay, out­touching Denver by just over half a second. 
"What we've been looking for all season is a meet where we could take a giant step and these three sessions have helped us do that. We talked during today's break about how the meet would come down to the last relay, so we prepared
