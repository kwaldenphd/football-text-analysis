SMC Assembly acts on parking 
by Maureen S~jbel Staff Reporter 

The Saint Mary's Student As­sembly unanimously passed a pro­posal last night allowing students 
to park in the LeMans parking lot on weekends. The proposal, which is not in effect yet, will give all St. Mary's students free access to the centrally located LeMans lot from 6:00 p.m. Friday to 6:00 p.m. Sunday. This extension of parking privileges will allow students a safer and more convenient access to their vehicles and free Security from the job of taxiing students from their dorms to the McCandless parking lot. 
The proposal wiii go to Stevie Wernig, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, the Student Affairs Com­mission and the Student Affairs Council for approval and endorse­ment. 
"It's a reasonable proposal," said Mary Lu Bilek, student body president, "and I think it wiii go through, but probably not until February. I'll try to push it through because it would be nice to have it when we get back from vacation." 
A second part of the proposal recommends that only students from McCandless be allowed to park in the first three rows of the McCandless lot on weekends. This measure was added to reduce security risks for those residents who choose to park in that lot. 
Visitors will still be allowed to park in the LeMans lot. During special campus events, however, the visitor overflow wiii be directed to the back of the McCandless lot, still giving students free access to the central Le Mans lot. 
A second proposal, concerning study days before finals, was. brough tup by Cathy Coyne, Vice President for Academic Affairs. Coyne's proposal which will be presented to the Academic Council today, recommends that the Mon­day, May 9 classes be moved to Saturday, May 7, to allow for three consecutive study days before the spring finals beginning May 10. 
As it stands now, the academic calendar for the next two years will remain the same, with no study days before fall finals and one before the spring finals. 
In her proposal, Coyne hopes to arrange these future calendars so as to include extra study days. 
Members suggested that careful consideration be made before ap­proving the Saturday class day. Job schedules and the Kentucky Derby will conflict with classes on that date.

OC students: secure your valuables 
Off-Campus students returning home for the Christmas holiday should secure their valuables, stat­cd Darlene Palma, associate off­campu\ housing director. 
Palma warned "If you will miss the article, don't leave it." She suggested several means of secur­ing valuables during the break. 
She said students should contact apartment landlords to store "m-crsized articles" which they could not bring home with them. She <ilso !>uggestcd that off-campus residents contact friends living on

Due to a lack of student response Palma explained, a program set up last year by the housing committee has been discontinued. Under this program, a list of professors willing to store student's valuables in their homes. was compiled. However, very few students contacted these professlrs and the program was abandoned this year. 




Spack gives reason for book 
[continued from page 1] Because of the emphasis on monetary profit, this system is not geared to produce that goal, he stated. 
·-After his presentation which was 
received warmly by the audience, 
Spock answered questions from the audience. One of those questions involved his reasons for writing Baby and Child Care in 1946. The book has sold some 22 million copies and has been translated into 18 languages. 
"I was the only doctor at the time 
who had both pediatric and psycho­
amlytical training,'' Spock explain­
ed. "So I was asked Ly some 
doctors to write a book about child 
development.'' 
"I wrote each day from 9 a.m. to 
p.m. for three years," he continued. "I was scared doctors would be very critical. In fact, it was very successful with parents and pediatricians as well." 
When asked how students should become involved to change society, Spock encouraged the stu­dents in the audience to "join political movements." He further emphasized the need for people to get involved in community organi­zations and even encouraged people to join, if interested, the People's Party with which he is affiliated. 
One student challenged Spock's support of socialism, which he did not elaborate on in his talk, saying that Britain fell because of social­ism. Spock responded by saying, "The problem is that Britain has not gotten into socialism. Their form of socialism is a combination

According to Father Ebey. rector of Fischer Hall. "The tremendous pressure caused by the breakage rc.,ultcd in water coming through the maid's room in to the base­ment." He stated that Hanley Plumbing and a representative of the power plant had the water flow stopped at abput 5:30 am. By that time about four inches of water had accumulated throughout the base­ment. 
"Since there are also students' room~ in the basement. there was some damage to rugs and car­pets." Ebey noted. "But we are very happy that no one was hurt and there was as little damage as there was.'' he added. 
Mr. Kenneth Kempf. assistant director of the power plant. stated, "The water main outside Fischer is eighteen years old. Other than that. "I can give no definite explanation of why the main broke. There are several things that can go wrong with such an offset main. 
But none of these occurred. Iguess it can he termed as just one of those things.·· Kempf concluded.

over Christmas break. Stoltze formally announced her resignation at the Student Assembly meeting last night. 
According to St. Mary's Proce­dural Manual. which illustrates the structure of St. Mary's community government, the new vice presi­dent must be elected by the student body. Both Bilek and Stoltze expressed their dissatisfaction wih this policy. 
"We ran as a team. and let's face it. I'm breaking up the team," Stoltz said. "To keep it a cohesive

The election is scheduled for Jan. 24. "We go out of office April I, so she should only hold office

0 Christmas Tree 
It is hard to get into the Christmas spirit at Notre Dame. The rush of finals is on, the snow is piled deep, a decree has gone forth banishing nat ural Christmas trees from the dorms. So, Fr. Robert Griffin, the Univer­sity chaplain, and those helping him have done the University a service by arranging for a Ctlmmunity Christmas tree as a focus fllr the season's spirit. 
The tree will be one of those growing near LaFortune and will be dedicated in a ceremony Thursday night. The blessing will be followed by a party at Darby's Place, providing a welcome break from s1 udies. Griffin has recruited the support of S1udent Government and the Office of S1 udent Affairs (which is really not staffed wi1 h Scrooges and Grinches ). Contribu­
tions  are  still  needed  to  pay  for  the  
dec1lrations;  it  would  be  fitting  if  the  
mrmey  came  from  many  people  in  the  
c~ mmuni1 y.  

In 'he midst of the last dreary push to The end of the semester, Griffin's project offers a bit of Christ mas cheer.

Dear Editor: 

' 
I would have to offer my support for Fred Herbst's story regarding women's basketball at the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community. You cold think that a women's college basketball team would have lear­t ned fundamentals by now. I hope we aren't serious about making 
 Notre Dame women's basketball a varsity sport. My younger sister, a sophomore in high school, could 
~ beat either team singlehandedly on any given day ... Varsity status? Let's wait a few years.

Raps Herbst 
Dear Editor: 
I for one am appalled at the radio comments and recent column of my so-called boss and. his even more dubious title, Sports Editor: Mr. Fred Herbst. _ 
In the first place, what really galls me is that is not his depart­ment. What gives him the right to make such rash, uncalled for, and obviously ludicrous remarks that come only under my and the SMC Sports Editor's jurisdiction? 
Let me make it clear that none of h is remarks reflect my attitude in the slightest. How could they? How could his remarks be indica­tive of anyone who has followed women· s basketball, at least during last vear? 
After following ND women's hasketball very exensively last vear. both as an announcer and ~ports writer. I feel a little more qualified to comment on their play last Saturdav. Yet is it really necessary? An article summarizing the play-by-play action would have sufficed. THe rest is obvious, it seems to me. 

Fred, if you and women's basket­ball "don't agree", as you say, then why did you insist on writing this story? Why did you not let one of the members of the SMC of ND women's sports staff cover it, as is their job? Anyone would have done it more justice than you. 
Finally. as one of the women's sports editors. I would like to apologize to both teams for the obvious injustice done to their play, and for the poor journalistic com­ment appearin15 in my department of the sports page. 
Eileen O'Grady ND Women's Sports Editor 


Another Rap 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is being written in response to the article entitled ··Banana Oil'' written by Mr. Herbst. In our four years at Notre Dame we have never seen a more cynical sports editor. All year long his critical barbs have been flung at the Notre Dame athletic programs. but in this article he has reached an all-time low. 
Mr. Herbst fails to make a mature comment in the entire article. He did not mention that since it was the first game of the year, the teams could be nervous and that this factor may have caused some of the errors commit­ted. Nor did he take into acacount the hard work Sally Duffy did to prepare her team for the game. She gives two hours of her time five days a week with no pay just so she and her team can have fun playing organized basketball. All die joy she experienced in seeing her team win must have been tarnished by his base story. Maybe Mr. Nerbst does not understand the purpose of the athletic pro­grams at Notre Dame. If he doesn't, we suggest he develop such an understanding so as to improve his reporting ability. If he does understand this purpose he sh should spend more time analyzing his reporting methods to enable him to report the total picture rather than the limited scope he recently presented in the Observer. 
Either way his ability to cover a story will improve. 
In conclusion, we wish to em phasize that the aforementioned opinion of Mr. Herbst is held by inany people of theNotre Dame community. We believe that Mr. Herbst should at least give some credit where credit is due, rather than incessantly carp on the ath­letic activities here at Notre Dame. We believe the inadequate and biased reporting of Fred Herbst should be upgraded to the more professional level that the Observer 
has dem onstrated over  the  past  
years.

Yet Another 
Dear Editor, 
I would like to thank Mr. Herbst for showing this campus what real male chauvinism is in his com mentary, "Basketball At Its Fi­nest." The only conclusion I can come to is that after having been stifled all football season. (the football players are too big to pick on). Mr. Herbst, needing someone to criticize, chose women's basket­ball. He says in his article, ''I'd rather have personality than a win any day." Sorry Fred, but you don't have either. 
Mary Ellen Burchett Sandy Mertensotto 


And Another 
Dear Editor: 
Anger isn't the word. 
Fred Herbst and women's bas­ketball don't agree. We are sorry. We are also sorrv that The Obser­ver would bow so.low as to print his article as "coverage" of a sports event. Herbst not only failed to report objectively on the game. he also managed to slander both Notre Dame and St. Mary's teams, coaches and fans in one mindless motion of the pen. 
Women's basketball is not a varsity sport at NO. Women are not offered scholarships. THey are not recruited from around the nation. High school athletic pro­grams for girls have improved tremendously over the past few years. Six years ago basketball still followed "girls' " rules: six players on a team, three on ofense and three on defense and you couldn't cross the center line. Women's basketball may not be equal to the play of the men, but is is through no fault of their own. 
The time devoted by each mem­ber to the sport is extraordinary. The dedication of Coach Sally Duffy to her team and to women's athletics at Notre Dame is unmat­ched. If she "was like a little kid" at the game on Saturday it was a true display of excitement, emotion and concern for a team that she has shaped over the past two years. 
If what is important is how many turnovers we have each game then women should give up basketball altogether. But we will not give up basketball. or any other sport, simply because we cannot play up to the standards of men like y ou, Mr. Herbst, who insist on a serious game yet are delighted by the "cute" cheers of the St. Mary's fans. If you could know how much that game meant, and how much women's sports mean, to the players, coaches, and women stu­dents of Notre Dame then maybe you would realize what your article stnads for. We cannot ignore your article, but we will survive it, just as we have survived all the cruel, insensitive words we have heard in the past. 
Please, Mr. Herbst, do not come watch women's basketball if it offends you, and do not write any 
more us.  articles because you  offend

Still Another 
Dear Editor: 
In regard to Mr. Herbst's article in yesterday's Observer, I feel he has overstepped the boundaries of acceptable journalism by reverting to a series of unsophisticated personal attacks.  
There seem to be several differ­ent levels with which one oculd view this article. First, it is a piece· of reporting, relaying the scores and some of the events of the game. This, of course, is journal­ism at its most basic level. Second, it is a commentary on the events of the game and ·of th ose who participated in it: it is an obvious right of Mr. Herbst, as a columnist, to criticize the game and the events that took place. It is going beyond this to which I object. 
I cannot acdept his personal attack on the people, the players and coach, who participated in this game. Ignoring women's issues, women's rights. women's move­ment. Mr. Herbst seems to have side swiped the whole point of the game. 
What Notre Dame's women's basketball consists of. in my opin­ion, is a group of players. headed by a coach, all of whom take seriously themselves as waell as the gave of basketball. Most have played for years and have put much time and work (ie. dedication) into the game and their personal devel­opment as well as team growth. 
After competing with many others to make the team. these players practice several times a week under the direction of their coach who in turn puts in more hours handling the team's adminis­trative details. 
Granted he may not have liked the quality of the game and granted he may not like women's basketball (this is his prerogative as a sports columnist) , he cannot be justified in insulting people's integrity, to actually make fun of those who are serious about themselves, as play­ers, and the game. 
If Mr. Herbst feels he is justified in printing this attack then I must confess that I think Mr. Herbst, and all that he stands for as a columnist in the Obsen·er, is a farce.

B~ Leo Hanson 
Man lives in a dual environment. That which man has constructed, since his conquest of the of structure and form, we call the artificial or built environment. All else is termed nature, or the natural environment. 
Within the natural environment man encounters a succession of interactions and relationships which potentially affect man's personality, development and well­being. The patterns of an earthly culture pattern our thoughts, fears and actions. For example, an individual may be psychologically intimidated by a personal fear of an unknown entity, such as a dark and secluded forest. Yet one senses a sense of security within the enclosure and protective territoriality that the forest yields. A palm tree in the midst of a desert defines a focal point which may attract a wanderlost traveler. and may imply a sort of psychological balance. A grassy plain is less stimulating than rolling hills or a ragged shore. All such factors play an important role in the ecological system, nature's mechanism of harmony and balance. 
Man is also responsible for his actions within the built environment, which, significantly, portray similar functions as its natural counterpart. With everything man builds. he requisitions a new relation­ship with the world in which he lives. 
The University of Notre Dame is an "academic village" in concept and form, even from its initial conception. Within the boundaries of his miniature environment, all life functions exist: life. work. learning, and play. Each life function plays an important role in the determination of the village criteria, and from the beginning the founders of the University sought responses to these criteria. 
As early as 1849. Father Sorin envis­ioned the Grande Avenue lined with trees and leading to the monument focal point. now Notre Dame Avenue and the Golden Dome. respectively. This was a deliberate 

d d   

psychological nee s. An not surpnsmg y, it was an historically French response (Versaille imitation) to the environment, since the land on which the university is located was dominated by French explor­ers. 
The site, founded on Nov. 27, 1842 by Father Sorin and company after eleven days of explorations, is a reaction to a natural amenity (St. Mary's Lake) which typically serves as the source of human settlements. 
Thus. Notre Dame duLac began it's progression of growth. From a melting pot of planning ideas, including those of Jefferson at Virginia. and French Baroque and English Garden traditional beliefs, gradually the campus took form. 
An administration building, built in 1879 to replace an earlier one destroyed by fire, a gothic revival church, and a music hall (now Washington Hall) formed the first triad of buildings which dominated the landscape. This set the precedent for the central complex, is which the main building served as vertex and link between an academic line of buildings: Music The addition of the Memorial library an the high atmosphere which earlier planning concepts idealiz­rise residential dorms [bottom] revolted against an ed. The result is anomie -t~ere is no clear sense historical precedent of a subdued but formal of direction or dramatic relief. 

(Washington Hall), Science (LaFortune) and technology (Hoynes Hall) and the religious and residential side, Walsh, Sorin and Sacred Heart Church. The quadrangle was enclosed on the south by a post office and Porter's House. Old Door Road crossed the axial avenue at the entrance, now he center of South Quad. 
The central quadrangle incorporated functionally, aesthetically and psycholo­gically sound ideas. The urban landscape was stimulating; relatively at ease of perception; it introduced dynamic tension and a sense of movement; it resolved that tension through the use of a focal point at one end; it created a sense of enclosure within the space, by the buildings and the trees. Perhaps no lesser significance was the fact that it provided a space suitable for the life-activities of a collegiate environ­ment. allowing for an inward focus and an emphasis on social communication. 
As the University continued to expand, similar ideas were pursued by the develop­ers of the religious community. The private, territorial spaces assumed by the morphological forms of Dillon and Alumni Halls (reminiscent of Oxford and Cam­bridge) and the triad of Lyons, Howard and MOrrissey. expound further on creative urban exploitations. The South Quadran­gle at least equals the success achieved in the central core complex, as a planning unit. The space i~ more linear, though less climatic, and more definitive and enclo­sing. And, with the exception of the modern buildings of Pangborn. Fisher, O'Shaughnessey and the Bookstore, the building textures are diverse and enrich­ing. Ao; a focal point of activity, it is possibly without too many equals within 
these United States. 
Still. mysteriously, the quadrangle turns 
it back upon the lake, a non-figural but still 
symbolically important element. Chairman 
Kerrick of the Architecture department 
fought for lake orientation, but managed 
only to incorporate the Lyons Hall arch in 
the design. 

This, a blessing in disguise, is perhaps 
one of the most dramatic urban expres­
sions on campus. The arch serves as a 

lost in a morass of extreme functionalism.  In cities and towns, this architectural. boredom has enriched pathologies such as. 
isolation, aggression, insecurity, monot­ony. 8 According to A. E. Parr, sociologist, "As. 
we make surroundings more and more. uniform, well-regulated and predictable, we force the adventurous to resort to more. 
and more irregular, unpremeditated or. rebellious behaviour." While social aggression is perhaps not a

blandness and lack of response to any external criteria, save for the functionality of the automobile. The abberation of O'Shaughnessy tfall is an even greater addition to this mysterious and sudden failure of planning. Even the minor details. such as the countless silver wire poles which augment the natural aesthetic expression of the "village" green detract fromthe attractiveness of the campus. 
The cold and sterile new "crossroads area" was obviously designed for the summertime, although most ND students attend school during the winter. This contradiction is further continued by the statement "The trees will eventually grow and hide the surrounding buildings". If the buildings were interesting to begin with, such a need would not arise. Again historical precedent (for example, Place. du Vosges in Paris) should have been heeded. 
Future plans only extend the modern failures, and further the delocalization, sterilization and insensitivity of functional­ism which has stagnated and destroyed envigorating atmosphere upon which the university's foundations exist. lnscnsitivi­ty to and overutilization of material'>. lack of creativity in design, pseudo-morphologi­cal form response, and ignoranc eor denial of urban/historical precedent are architec­tural abberations which contribute to urban problems in the design of this campus. 
Future considerations should keep these concepts at hand. As the univcP.. ity expands. Functionalism is not a glas::.-cn­closed shelter from the cold or heat; architectural creativity is not a plastic flower bed on either side of an entrance to a hotel lobby; and certainly a huge mural attached to the main facade of a building, is not an aesthetic response much beyond naive. 
Once these definitions are mastered, then perhaps responses to more human needs might evolve, naturally.

Alice In Wonderland 
Directed by Bud Townsend Starring Kristine de Belle 

Alice, in the real world, is a virgin librarian who refuses to go out with Tom because he likes "that kind of girl," whereas Alice is saving herself for mar­
·
riage. She sings about wantmg to grow up again all over when all of sudden the White Rabbit appears and leads her through the looking glass into Wonderland. Wonderland is something else again. It's a forest infested with all sorts of neurotic erotics. The Mad Hatter is an exhibitionist. Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and has been rendered impotent. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are a charming young couple that frolic in the 
glade wearing nothing but goofy little beanies. The Queen of Hearts is a Nazi-nympho-Amazon-lesbian type, and 
the King is a black stud. 

Alice gets a lesson in sex from each character she meets, stopping on occasion to sing a song. (Example: She encounters

is doubtful. Laughter and lust seem to be. inherently irreconcilable in such great. degree, although they worked together rather nicely on a less intense level in more. than one film (Lovers and Other Strangers. and Play It Again, Sam are good exam-. pies).

Notre Dame wins 
bJ Win Palmer Spurts Writer 
Notre Dame women's basketball team toplcd the women from St. Man·'s bv a score of 56-35 Saturdav aftct:nooti at the A.C.C Last vea·r St. Mary·~ edged Notre Dame t\\ icc in exciting contests. but Saturdav it wa~ all the Irish women a~ they-forced SMC into many turno\ er~. 
SMC '>cored first as Stuannc Da\ i-. hit a short jumper. Both team'> appeared nenous at this point a'> they were playing in front of a fair!~· large crowd. many of ,,·hom had remained from the earlier Notre Dame-Valpraiso game. but the teams soon settled d01m. Martha Kelly. an early substitution for St. Mary's, hit a couple of jumpers early in the game to deadlock the game at eight. Notre Dame then roared ahead as Carola Cumming and Margaret McMinamin each hit three buc­kets. It was a lead that Notre Dame was never to lose as they led 20-13 at halftime. 
Both teams came out fired up in the second half. St. Mary's was led by the shooting of Kathy Cullen, nancy Norwalk and marth Kelly who was the high scorere for SMC for the game with 10 points. Notre Dame. however. taking full advan­tage of their height advantage outscored SMC by a score of 36-22 in the second half. Pat Meyer and Carol Lally, who were high scorers for the Irish with 16 and 13 points respectively were outstanding in the second half as the Irish built a ger" Phelps commented. "McKin ney is one of the finest guards we will face all year." 
Joining McKinney in the back­court is senior Bob Hildebrand. The combo lends age to the otherwise young Northwestern squad and will hope to ignite the Wildcat attack. 
Pete Boesen, a 6-8 forward and Mike Cambell. a 6-10 freshman center add to the youth of the Wildcat team. Boesen has been a steady performer thus far this season. while Cambell is coming on strong as a freshman. In the overtime loss to DePaul. Campbell responded with two of the four Northwestern field goals in the overtime period. His youth doesnot seem to deter him from performing in clutch situations. 
This Wildcat squad is young and talented and could catch Notre Dame off-guard if the Irish happen to be looking ahead to Saturday's clash with UCLA in Paulie Pavilion. 
The Irish cannot afford to glance ahead; the Wildcats came close to dealing a strong DePaul team a loss and could give Notre Dame the same scare if the Irish are already feeling the \\·armth and sunshine of Los Angeles. 
Last Saturday's contest with Valparaiso foun-d Bruce Flowers turning in his best performance of 
the competitive balance of the game. 
"Some of the clubs, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox specifically. got stronger," Kuhn told delegates to the 75th annual convention. "It is fair to say that some harm was done to the competitive balance. 
''Eight of· the top free agents were signed by sun belt teams. This also could cause trouble. affecting the competitive balance." 
He failed to blame the teams but obviously was referring to the California Angels, who spent more than $4 million signing Don Baylor, 
Joe Rudi and Bobby Grich; San Diego, which picked up Gene Tenace and Rollie Fingers from the Oakland A's; Texas, which got Bert Campaneris and Doyle Alexander. and Atlanta, which wound up with outfielder Gary Matthews. 
''The cost was higher than expected,·' the commissioner said, referring to the more than $20 million paid for 14 of the leading free agents. ''This is certain to bring about pressures for cost­cutting and increasing revenues." 
He said he did not expect a dramatic change in ticket prices although there certainly would be some hikes -a few having already occurred. He said the average ticket price in 1976 was $3.40. 
Kuhn said it may be several years before anyone can draw a definite conclusion over the impact of the re-entry draft but he added optimistically: "Over-all we have reason for exhilaration and we have reason for concern, but we have lived with concerns for 107 years. I remain bullish on baseball. I remain bullish on baseball's fu­ture." 
The commissioner stated that more people watched baseball dur­ing the past year-44,437,000 in the the young season. Flowers led the Irish in rebounds with 12 and was third in scoring with 14 points. 

Freshman Rich Branning direc­ted the Notre Dame attack with 18 points and five assists. Branning has added to the Irish tradition, being just another of the many cagers called upon to perform in their freshman year. 
Toby Knight was the second highest scorer for the cagers against Valpo last Saturday. The "super-sub" was called on to start in that game, replacing Dave Batton who was sidelined with the flu. Knight is averaging 14 p.p.g., second only to Duck Williams 
(16.7 p.p.g.), and is heading the squad in caroms with 28. 
Williams has logged the most playing time for the Irish and has hit 48 percent from the field to lead the Irish in total points with SO. Williams added ten points in the

Former-Celtic Russell empathizes with Cowens 
NEW YORK AP -Bill Russell. who Jed the Boston Celtics to 11 championships in the late 1950's and 1960's, says he can empathize with Dave Cowens, the all-star center who packed his bags and left the National Basketball Association champions earlier this year. 
"What he did might have a very simple explanation -the man is tired of playing and he might not enjoy it anymore," said Russell. now coach and general manager of the Seattle Supersonics. 
"It happens," Russell added. "It didn't happen to me because I enjoyed the game too much. But I can't blame him. I did finally leave and go to California. Only it took me a lot longer.'' 
It took Russell IJ seasons before he left the Celtics, whom he served as both an all-pro center and coach. 
During that time he earned a reputation as an independent man, one who preferred to think things through for himself rather than go along with the crowd. 
"I am not nice to people just to be nice," he said in describing his 
singular  personality.  "I  don't  
smile  just  to  smile.  I  don't  
cooperate just to cooperate.  I owe  

nothing to anybody -except myself. 
I must be my own man." 
That no-obligation philosophy is reflected in Russell's attitude to­wards Cowen's departure from the Celtics. He feels it's important to note that since leaving the team on Nov. 10, Cowens has not been drawing his reported $280,000-a­him to leave if he was still getting paid." said Russell, whose Sonics were beaten by the New York Knicks 103-96 at Madison Square Garden Saturday night. "But he isn't. Does he owe something to the Celtics? Only if they pay him." 
Cowens did not give specific reasons for taking his unprecedent­ed leave of absence, but the 6-foot-9 star did say he had lost his enthusiasm for the game and felt he could no longer give 100 percent. All the outside pressures had drained off too much of the fire and determination which were his trademark. 

That, too, struck a familiar note to Russell, who refused to sign autographs because he felt that the ritual was too impersonal, but who now spends much time in the off-season speaking to youth groups. 
"Dave plays the game with great intensity, and I guess he felt there were too many things taking away from that intensity, draining it off," Russell said. "I can under­stand that feeling. I didn't leave because I liked playing too much. But I can't blame him for doing what he did." 
Raiders win 

OAKLAND AP -Ken Stabler destroyed the Cincinnati Bengals' defense -and probably their playoff hopes · with four touchdown passes 
Mac to go 
by Fred Herbst Sports Editor 
The Observer has learned that star center Bob MacAdoo of the Buffalo Braves will be traded today. An informed source revealed that the NBA 's leading scorer for the last two seasons will be sent to the New York Knicks some­time today. In return, the Braves will receive center John Gianelli and between $2.5 and $3 million. 
MacAdoo is playing under the last year of a $400,000 contract and will become a free agent at the end of the current season if he doesn't sign another contract. The Braves have reportedly offered the "Big Mac·· a five-vear $500,000 contract, but have not been able to come to terms with the superstar. 
The Seattle Supersonics were also reportedly interest­ed in obtaining MacAdoo, and offered the Braves 7-4 center Tom Burleson and $2 million in cash. But the financially plagued Buffalo team appar­ently has been forced to accept the Knick deal because of the amount of money involved. 
The Braves announced yes­terday that John Brown, form­er owner of the ABA Kentucky Colonels. has increased his ownership of the Brave fran­chise so that he is now a full partner with Paul Synder. This further lends to specula­tion that the team will be mo\ed to Louisville . Ky. in 
~he near future.
