VOL. Ill, No. 78 TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1969 
~SMC students ready action On eight faculty dismissals 
Theology Department was not given a contract renewal. 
Dr. Mark Bambenek of the Chemistry Department appeared at the student meeting in an informal capacity to explain the rules of the American Associ­ation of University Professors applying to promotion, tenure, and the dismissal of faculty. He also explained the relcvent rule as stated in the January I I, 1969 Saint Mary's Faculty Manual. He offered no personal opinions. 
The A.A.U.P. has set up the following standards in deter­mining rank and tenure of fac­ulty members: One may hold the rank of instructor for a maximum of five years, after which he is either promoted to assistant professor or dismissed. After serving two years one must have notice of one year prior to contract termination. After serving seven years, one must be given tenure. 
Flanagan, Ranaghan, Hengesbach, and Kiefer would be due for promotion to as­sistant professor after next year. The now hold instructor status. Wamhoff and Mrs. Poinsatte would receive tenure after next 
year if they had not been given 
terminal contracts. 
The Saint Mary's Faculty Manual bases promotion to as­sistant professor on the fol­lowing standards: !) an earned doctorate or its recognized equivalent, or 2) superior teaching, or 3) public recogni­tion in his discipline through publication of the results of his academic research. Each de part men t chair rna n can recommend a faculty member for promotion. The Rank and Tenure Committee, composed of the Academic Dean, the Aca­demic Vice-President, two per­manent faculty members, the department chairman. and two members of the department, meet to study the recommendation. They either refer it to the President or stop it. The president of the college makes the final decision on each case. 
The case of each faculty member in question varies. Miss Noel, Chairman of the English Department, told several English majors that Flanagan's dismissal seems to be the result of a misunderstanding. There was no meeting of the Rank and Tenure Committee to discuss his case before recommendations were given to the administration. Flanagan said that he received no prior notice that he would be given a terminal contract. "I don't understand it. I was given a terminal contract and I don't know why," Flanagan said. 
In the cases of Ranaghan and Hengesbach, Theology De par tmcnt Chairman Sister Maria Assunta did recommend both men for promotion. The Rank and Tenure Committee voted not to refer these recommendations to the President. Both men have been dismissed effective June, 1970. Ranaghan stated that "it is my impression that completion of a Ph.D. was the supreme criterion in judging these cases." 
Wamhoff has taught at Saint Mary's for several years and has served as Philosophy Department Chairman for the past two years. He would have received automatic tenure if he had not been given a terminal contract. Very little was known of the individual cases of other faculty members. Students are 

currently  investigating  these  
cases.  
Because  of  the  qualification  

of superior teaching, students are attempting to retain several of the dismissed faculty. At the Sunday night meeting it was decided that students would write to Msgr. McGrath, President of Saint Mary's College, stating their reasons why they considered an individual a superior teacher and qualified to remain at Saint Mary's If voicing their opinions through letters to the President has no effect other ways of action wiJI be considered. Msgr. McGrath, vacationing in Hawaii, has been unavailiablc for comment. Dr. Jack Dctzlcr, Executive Vice-President of Saint Mary's, declined comment since McGrath will return to campus today. 
Honor Council takes "leave of absence" after deciding that students do not honor the "honor concept." See back page. 

Administration : Police not invited 
Philip Facenda, attorney and special assistant to Father Hesburgh, issued a statement yesterday clarifying the administration's role concerning the presence of police deputies on campus last Friday afternoon to confiscate the allegedly pornographic film, "Kodak Ghost Poems." The administration's actions in this matter had been a major source of misconceptions by the students and had provided fuel for further agitation by some of the students. 
Facenda reported that he was informed early Friday morning by Mr. Raymond Gauer, executive director of the national office of the Citizens for Decent Literature (COL) and other CD L representatives that William Voor, County Prosecutor, wanted to speak to him. He said that he then called Voor, who said that he knew that incomplete screenings of "Kodak Ghost Poems" and "Flaming Creatures" had been shown the previous afternoon and that an announcement had been made that these films would be shown again Friday in the Student Center. 
Facenda said that a meeting with Voor and Gauer took place later that morning and that at the meeting, he "stressed the University administration's desire if at all possible to prevent the screening of t.hcse films through means available to members of the University community." Mr. Gauer who had been in Thursday's film audience had made out an affadavit alleging that "Kodak Ghost Poems" was "hard-core pornography." Voor then stated that under these circumstances it was his duty to obtain a warrant and impound this film. 
Voor agreed to allow the University to take every possible action within its power to prevent its screening hut he emphasized that it would be necessary for him to take action if the University was not successful in preventing the screening of "Kodak Ghost Poems." Facenda said that he agreed that the University would cooperate in every way with Voor in carrying out his duty." 
In regard to the question of whether the raiding police had a warrant Facenda said that he was presented with a warrant hy Voor while he waited about 2Yz hours for the debating students to decide whether they would screen the films. Facenda added, "When it became apparent that the University could not of itself 
prevent the assembly from screening "Kodak Ghost Poems," Mr. Voor then moved to confiscate the film."

Strong rumors have reached the Senate that the Junior class has not been keeping any writ­ten records of their financial transactions. A financial com­mittee has thus been established to investigate these rumors, also checking the financial status of the Sophomore class, which is allegedly $2200 in debt. Sena­tors Boland (chairman), Thrasher, Johnson, Hunter, and Barbolla comprise this com­mittee. 
The third committee is the result of a bill proposed by Freshman Senator Joe Brehler. The bill concerns the changing of election procedures for stu­dent members of the Student Life Council. The bill was voted into committee for re-evaluation after a number of points in it were found to be either unac­ceptable and/or misleading. This committee is composed of Sen­ators Mead (chairman), Dedrick, Rumore, and Brehler.

VIet negotiator bids leave of Paris 
PARIS (UPI) -Le Due Tho, supervisor of North Vietnam's 
negotiating team, left unexpectedly yesterday for Hanoi. There was 
immediate speculation he was carrying secret American proposals to 
break the dead-locked peace talks. 
Tho, a close associate of President Ho Chi Minh, described his 
mission as "routine." But allied diplomats said each of his two 
previous flights to Hanoi had brought perceptible shifts in the 
Communist stand. 
It was considered noteworthy that Vice President Nguyen Co Ky 
returned to Saigon Sunday, presumable to sound out President 
Nguyen Van Thieu on the new U.S. proposals. Ky is the overseer of 
the South Vietnamese negotiating team. 
Tho, who ranks No. 7 in the North Vietnamese hierarchy, was 
flying to Hanoi via Moscow and Peking, his usual stopping off places. 
lie is expected to brief soviet and Communist Chinese officials on 
the progress of the Paris talks. 
Before boarding a Soviet airliner at Paris, Tho told newsmen he 
believed there had been no progress in the Vietnam conference. He 
insisted there can be no substantive negotiations until the United 
States agrees to withdraw its 535,000 man expeditionary force from 
South Vietnam. 
Tho accused President Nixon of "following the same policies" as 
former President Lyndon B. Johnson. "Therefore, there was no 
progress," Tho said. 

Chicago U. students favor amnesty 
CIIICAGO (UPI) A student opinion poll at the embattled 
University of Chicago indicated yesterday a majority believe 
protesters should not have started their sit-in at the school's 
administration building but should be granted amnesty for their acts. 
The results of the poll were published in the Maroon, the student 
newspaper, as housing eviction notices were served upon six of the 
rebels and a special disciplinary committee heard from five students 
accused of participating in the 12-day sit-in. 
Unlike meetings of the disciplinary committee Friday and 
Saturday, when the student dissidents disrupted sessions, yesterday's 
hearing was quiet. Steve Rothkrug, spokesman for a half dozen 
demonstrators who listened to the proceedings, said they did not 
attempt to break up the hearing because "There weren't enough of 
us today." 
Rothkrug distributed a pamphlet calling the disciplinary commit­
tee "illegitimate" and demanding amnesty for students who have 
participated in the sit-in. 
Pueblo crewman testifies In court 
CORONADO, Calif. (UPI)-The chief engineman aboard the USS 
Pueblo said yesterday he considered destroying the ship's engines 
just before the North Koreans seized the vessel, but received no 
command to do so. 
Monroe Goldman, 37, of North Little Rock, Ark., said under 
questioning by the attorney for Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher that to have 
done so would have made the ship powerless in case American sea or 
air aid should have come to the Pueblo. 
The five admiral court of inquiry yesterday morning heard testimony from five crew members of the intelligence ship. It then went into a closed session to question co111munications technicians from the Pueblo. 
Goldman, a veteran of 18 years in the Navy, said he never knew until his capture the mission of the sl:ip. IIc said he thought it was simply an "oceanographic" vessel hut admitted he did "wonder" about the big section in which tl:e intelligence unit operated. 
The Pueblo steamed into Wonsan with a North Korean soldier pointing a gun at the engineroom. Goldman said he felt if there had been an accidental engine breakdown the guard would have shot him and his men. 


Finch supports clgareHe ad ban 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Welfare Secretary Robert If. Finch said yesterday he favors the Federal Communications Commission's proposed ban on televised cigarette advertising. "Yes," Finch was quoted as saying in an interview, "I think it is a good idea." 
The head of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare told a group of newsmen at a breakfast meeting that he does not agree with arguments that products are entitled to television advertising simply because they can be legally sold. 
Finch, who smokes cigarettes, said in IllS opinion he has no powers to regulate television commercials, but that as a top administrator in the health field he may be able to influence President Nixon on the subject. 
Nixon, a nonsmoker, told a news conference last week that he would not state a psoition on the FCC proposal until he had thoroughly studied the situation. 


Israeli right challenges Eshkol 
JERUSALEM (UPI) -Right wing political parties upset by 
Premier Levi Eshkol's reported willingness to negotiate control of 
some occupied Arab territories threatened yesterday to shatter the 
National Unity government that led Israel to victory in 1967 . 
One of the two right wing blocks involved filed a no confidence 
motion against the Eshkol leadership. Knesset parliament was to 
take it up today. 
The dispute, claimed by some right wing leaders to be a full 
fledged crisis, was triggered by an interview given by Eshkol to the 
American magazine Newsweek .He was quoted as saying Israel had no 
interest in holding on to the populated areas of the Jordan west 
bank, although it would demand solid security arrangements.

IKay Markle 
The quality of the faculty is essentially what matters in a college; when the administration tampers with that quality for reasons of dubious merit, the students arc being mocked by the institution they depend on for an "education." 

Within the past week, six members of the faculty at St. Mary's were given written notice that they would not be promoted and that at the end of the 1967-70 school year their contracts would not be renewed. The bluntness of the message was undoubt­edly a shock to people who have taught, and 

taught well, for several years. No explanations were given. They should be demanded. 
All six are the kind of professors students like to corner after class, or in their offices, or over a cup of coffee, to talk about Existentialism or Hemingway's value or the nature of God or more simply and more interestingly, what-the-heli-am-1­going-to-do-with-my-life. They are intelligent men, usually enthusiastic, commonly unorthodox. The system gets to them as much as it gets to the people they teach, because they happen to dislike inefficiency, pomposity, sloppy thinking and smugness. They are good teachers. Good teachers are supposedly what the whole business of college education is about. 
None of them are Ph.D.'s. If this is their failure, the reason why they no longer belong on the teaching staff of the college, then St. Mary's has become part of the graduate school factory system and all of those nice, cosy blurbs about SMC being 
Naivete 
I

a family of intellectuals, or whatever the phrase is, is a lie. No professor with an incisive mind and a talent for getting the efforts of that incisiveness across to a roomful of students can be termed anything but an "intellectual" and a scholar. There is no bound copy of a doctoral thesis sitting on his kitchen table (although there probably will be-ali of them are working toward their doctorates), but he thinks and makes the people around him think and that would seem to be a far better criterion for judging the quality of a professor than a solemn genuflection before a collage of degrees. 
If they are not good in the classroom they should be dismissed. But no official evaluations of them were made, no reasoned judgment that they failed professionally. The term "creative teaching" is a bit nebulous, but if it means introducing a few ideas that haven't been talked about before, asking some questions that make you want to go back to your room and read hard on the subject, they are as close to being "creative" in the classroom as a professor can be. 
They have never played very well at politics with the administration, they are unorthodox. If these reasons are sufficient to drop six members of the faculty, St. Mary's has gone nowhere at all academically in the past fifty years, in spite of its pass/fail courses and its Madeleva Scholars. It is still back in the days before the Scopes trial and in an institution of supposedly progressive education, that admission hurts. It is not something likely to attract or keep either students or faculty with the slightest taste for creativity and imagination. The students are· going to suffer the most, students who dutifully believe, with touching naivete, that what they are paying for is an education.

I think that events which occurred have been adequately publicized by the campus media, so I will not waste time elaborating on these events, except to acknowledge my presence and participation in many phases of the action. Instead, I would like to point out the significance of the police action and also the future implications which it carries. 
If we, the university community, allow this matter to pass by without taking positive action, legal or otherwise, then we are setting a dangerous precedent. To simply let the issue die or to accept a face-saving compromise is to leave ourselves wide open for similar attacks in the future. What kind of free, open community will we have if we can be used as victims for a witch hunt every time some two-bit politician is up for reelection? Obviously we must take action. We must show the county prosecutor and his like that their high-handed fascist methods are out of place in our university community. 
At the meeting which was held Sunday night it was decided to wait and see if the Student Life Council would conduct a fair investigation into Friday's events, and if it would take appropriate action. I do think we should wait a little while to see what action the SLC takes. Possibly with the help of our elected investigating committee they will see the necessity for some type of positive, uncompromising action against the forces of "law and order". 
If the SLC fails to satisfy the urgent need for action, then we have several roads open to us. We can seek legal help and 
determine whether legal action can be taken. This possibility is admittedly rather unfeasible, but still should be considered. We can formulate a petition or statement of our autonomy and submit it to the authorities in question for their reaction. It is unlikely, however, that the county authorities will respect any request or demand which asks that they refrain from invading our community. If all courses of action are found inadequate, we can take a lesson from students at Berkeley, Columbia, the University of Chicago, and other universities and from the experiences of black, poor-white, and other minority communities. We can recognize that as a community of students we are regarded by the establishment as having less rights than other citizens, simply because we don't carry a hell of a lot of weight at election time. To conteract this situation we must organize an effective defense mechanism to protect the freedom of our community. We should make it known to the county prosecutor and the other representatives of the local law that we will meet any future invasion of our community with some kind of organized confrontation. We should make it clear that we will not provoke police violence in any way, but will take appropriate action in the event of police provocation such as occurred last Friday. A definite commitment to the preservation of our autonomy is necessary to prevent a reoccurence of the past week's events. We need immediate positive action, and if the SLC does not provide it, then the community must act for itself. Ed Roickle
