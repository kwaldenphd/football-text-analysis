the issue more rele­vant to the international com­munity." said Malloy. 
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. Australia, five athletes have tested positive for illegal substances to date; among them are three Bulgarian weightlifters, a Latvian rower, and most recentlv, Romanian gymnast Anclre(;a Raducan. Raduc1tn was stripped of her gold medal in the women's all­around competition Tuesday after testing positive for a banned substance contained in her cold medication. 
Although a World Anti-Doping Organization exists to make rec­ommendations to the International Olympic Committee. Malloy and the 14 other membf1rs on the commis­sion want an independent orga­nization with morr authority.

The word "RATS" recently flashed across American television screens, courtesy of the Republican Party. 
But no one is really sure if the word was intended to be there. Although the Republican National Committee (RNC) was actually for the ad, the campaign of GOP presi­dential candidate George W. Bush has faced numerous questions about it. 
In the commercial. the words "bureaucrats decide" appear on screen. intended to criticize Gore's prescription drug plan. However, in one frame, "RATS," part of "bureaucrats," appears on the screen. 
The word remains on screen for only one-thirtieth of a second, but it is the largest word to appear in the commercial. Critics suggested that the ad was an attempt to sub­liminally create a negative opinion of Gore. 
"Nobody does that accidentally," said Ted Mandell, a professor in Notre Dame's Film. Television and Theatre department. "{I am] 99 percent positive it was intention­al." 
Although the commercial's pro­ducer. Alex Castellanos. denies that the word was used intention­ally, Mandell explained that some­one would have had to type into a computer any word that appeared on the screen. 
"They probably watch~d that ad a million times ... Any editor worth his weight would have picked it up immediately," Mandell said. "That would make me think that they were aware ofit." 
However, Mandell added that it is possible that neither the RNC nor the Bush campaign staff were aware that the word appeared. 
The tape would have gone through many hands. Mandell explained. and therefore someone else could have inserted it. He pointed out that animators have inserted single-celled frames into Disney movies as jokes the compa­ny itself never wanted in the film. 
Although the ad reflects nega­tively on the Bush campaign. most Americans will merelv dismiss it as part of politics, expiained Notre Dame government professor Benjamin Radcliff. As a result, if Bush loses, no one will look back at the ad controversy as the "defining moment" that cost Bush the election, Radcliff said. 
Negative ads are not new in political campaigns, though.

Members discuss GALA's complaints

Faculty Senate professor Edward Manier spoke on behalf of the unrecognized group, the Gav and Lesbian Alumni-Notre Dame/ Saint Marv's /GALA). at Monday's Campu'.5 Life Council meeting where members dis­cussed whether recent com­plaints from GALA are appro­priate issues for council discus­sion. 
'Tm the dosest thing they've got to a voice on this body," said Manier, who told the CLC that members of GALA felt inconve­nienced last Saturday when they had to switch locations for their Michigan State game watch gathering. 
"A couple things happened that left that group feeling less than welcome," said Manier. 
Initially. a representative of GALA wrote vice president of student affairs Bill Kirk request­ing to hold a gathering in the Reeker's Hospitality Room and serve alcohol. 


"That is not an area that we normally approve for the use of alcohol." Kirk said. 
Kirk shared with the CLC the letter he wrote in response to the GALA member. which said, "I regret that I am unable to provide approval for this event to include the service or pres­ence of alcohol given its timing and proximity to student social

Driver's License Blues 
Okay, so maybe our 21st r.entury. digitized. yuppificd, surburbanizcd, peanut-buttery soci­ety has lost most of the hardcore coming-of-age rituals of old My mom never told me to sit in the woods until I saw visions. My dad never made me kill a bear. I never walked across hot coals in order to symbolically achieve manhood All I had lo do was sign up for the draft -and pass Lhe dri­ver's test. 
That test has always embodied a sense of inde­pendence for me. Sure, as a kid I didn't always ask my parents for a ride when I had to get out of the house. SometimPs I'd grab my bike and a couple friends and just go. We'd sweat under the hot sun. burn off a few hundred calories. get surn­burnt and love thf! freedom of it all. But where would all that work get us? To K-Mart. Or, if we were feeling really adventurous, to Super Wal-Mart. But, with a car you ran go some­where. 
And so. I had to get my license. 
I was 15 for longer than I've been any age. The number of friends who were on an even rank with me ,the bicyclers) was rapidly dimin­ishing. Cruel biology had popped me out of the womb in mid-summer. making me younger than the rest of my class and one of the last to obtain a license to drive. 
And then it r.ame. the moment I had so antici­pated. With trembling limbs. I packed myself. my·mom and the buttr.rf1ies in my stomach into the car and went to the Department of Motor Vehiclr.s. 
Everyone there was intimidating. To me, the officers represP.nted pierced. painted tribesmen whose holy duty was to oppose my transition into manhood. The test became a svmbolic bat­tle reenacted as it had been reenac"ted by gen­erations of my f'orefathers since Ford first pro­duced the Model-T. A cleansing, spiritual bout was looming betwnen me and one of these tribesmen -and I was scared silly. 
As I strapped in next to my guide and enemy, I felt a surge of' excitement mixed with fear. The consequences of failure would be as disas­trous as the consequences of sucr.ess would be miraculous. My friends would laugh at me and l would rnmain grounded at home. I clenched my fists around the wheel and started the engine. 
As it turned out. I failed the test the first time. I parked in a handicap parking place upon return to the DMV. The failure was r.rushing at the time and it postponed my passage. But soon after. I won the battle. my independence and my manhood. 
Now looking hack, I can more fully appreciate the explosion of transitions that the driving test touched off. Life for me is still a process of sep­arating from my parents' authority and estab­lishing my individual ego. Each step is a scary one. but I build confidence each time I succeed. I'm r.onvincing myselfl can do it-I can sur­vive on my own. 
The first step was passing through the dri­ving-test ritual. shedding my youthful depen­dence on rides. That's when I proved to myself I could do it. and that it's safe to grow up.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK 
SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY 
Students react to required lectures 
SYRACUSE. N.Y. 
As the university prepares to host Nobel Pear.e Prize winner, writer and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel on Wednesday, some Syracuse University freshmen find the event more of an inr.onvenience than an educational experience. "Students should never be mandated to lis­ten to speakers," freshman David Perlman said. "Being made to listen to a lecturer takes the decision out of the students' hands and this should not be the policy of the university." Wiesel will discuss his experience surviving the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp. Perlman said students who are forced to attend the lecture will not get the same experience as those who attend out of interest. The university sponsors a speaker each year as part of the freshman required curriculum. The program also requires first-year students to participate in a weekly discussion group with their peers that addresses societal issues. The groups are organized by college faculty members. who will attend Wiesel's speech with their students.

Nader's speech gets record crowd 
MINNEAPOLIS 
Conventional wisdom might prompt some voters to write off Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader almost immediately. As a third-party candidate who accepts no corporate campaign finances and speaks about "corporate extremists'; dominating thfl government, Nader's political views could be viewed by some as the most left-wing stances American presiden­tial politics has ever seen. Yet to the more than 12,000 who attended the speech last Friday, Nader's message resonated as a viable alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties. "They are parties of slogans ­they don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say," Nader said. Nader officials, who said the event was the largest presidential rally in U.S. history, charged $7 per person. The large turnout helped the Green Party raise more than $110,000, gave Nader an international audience via C-SPAN and lent credibility to an insurgent r.ampaign which many predict is doomed to defeat.

Students who are dissatisfied with Notre Dame's new voice mail system now have the power lo choose.­
Lac;l year, each phone number had one voice mailbox and one pass code. During the summer. thn system was changed to give each student his or her own mailbox. /\crording to hnlp desk supenisor_ Paulette Podlcsak. the option to rnvnrt to last ynar's system is in responsn to stud11nt roquests. 
"Th<' idea was to o[for all stu­dents individual mailboxes for privacy masons. /\!so. there were somo problems in the past whern some individuals didn't gi:1t tlwir own nrnssages !because their roommate had alrnady checked the message!." Podlesak said. 
Arter the phone number rnvorts to one shaned mailbox svstf'm, tlrn rnctor and an v other group that uses the voi~email svstem to send mass nrnssagPs t~, users on a listserv must updat<' their phone list to reflect tlrn rrnw drnnges in the mailbox system. II' this is not clone, stu­dents will not recnive broadca:-;t messages. 

"lt is important that the rec­tors are involved. A messagn can't go to a mailbox that doesn't exist," said Lelernmmu­nirations manager Stnve Ellis. 
Students. faculty and staff cite several concerns about the new system. After hearing a student's message on the old system, !'ac­uity and staff could push a key to n'cord a reply that would be senl to the room's mailbox with­out having to make a separale call. Now that then' is no unified mailbox for the room, and facul­ty and staff who want to reply to a ,message must disconnect from the voice mail systPm and call back the number. 
"It's more difficult to respond to messages. I have to call thr, room. wah for the voicemail to pick up. push a button for tlrn prrson, and tlwn leavo a mes­sage," said Keenan Ilall rector Gary Chamberland. 
The new system was a source of frustration for junior Brian Pawloski and his roommato. 
"We didn't lind any purpose in having two boxes. If there's one mailbox, we can cher,k it and havn it done with. Tlw new sys­tem seemed to be morn compli-

cated," said Pawloski. 
Others find that the advan­tages of the syst1;m outweigh the problems. 
"I think it's better. You can't accuse your roommate of not giving you the message. When you get a silent message, the light keeps flashing until your roommate checks their box, but other than that. it's great," said sophomore Marissa C:ongemi. 
With thn current system, callers SPlnct whom to leave a message for. Broadcast mes­sages arc sent to each mailbox. 
"It's much more convenient, each person gets the message. More than anything, though, the system gets overused," Chamberland said. 
According to Ellis, since a rela­tively small numbPr of students have requested to be returned to last year's setup, the multiple voice mailbox system will likely he usPd again next year. 
"There have not been a large number ol' calls. I don't antici­pate a change, but who's to say what will happen." Ellis said. 
Students who want tu change their voiu\ mail system should call the Telecommunications I Jelp Desk at 1-9000.

Stroud, 21. is charged in the execution-style killings of three construction workers Sept. 14 near Lakeville. He was arrested two days after the murders.

were turned away, the foreign minister said Monday. 
"Information we received from various presidents and foreign ministers (from Latin America) was that if Panama didn't accede, there would be a military coup Sunday in Peru," Jose Miguel Aleman told a news conference. 


"We have reports that Peruvian troops stationed at border posts were mov­ing toward Lima at dawn on Sunday," he said, before meeting with President Mireya Moscoso to decide on asylum for Vladimiro Montesinos. 
Moscoso has come under strong pressure from Latin American leaders and the Organization of American States, backed by the United States, to grant the asylum in order to allow Peru to extricate itself from its political crisis. 
Opposition leaders in Peru were demanding the arrest and prosecution of Montesinos, a powerful Fujimori aide, over a bribery scandal, but there were fears that any move against him would bring retribution from the offi­cers Montesinos · has placed in top spots in the military. 
Although Panama refused to take him in Saturday, Montesinos arrived in the country around dawn Sunday. 
Aleman said Montesinos' apparent strength per­suaded Panama to recon­sider its refusal. Aleman said the fact that many believe Montesinos' depar­ture was the only way to consolidate democracy in Peru "is an indication that he was the de facto leader in Peru." 
"Within that context we are reevaluating the initial refusal to grant him asy­lum," he said. 
The bribery scandal prompted a surprise announcement from Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Sept. 16 that he would hold new elec­tions in which he would not be a candidate. Fujimori also pledged to dismantle the intelligence service that he had head­ed.

Mora: Diversity in U.S. a benefit 
By KATIE MILLER News Writer 
Author Pat Mora challenged Saint Mary's to realize the importance of diversity in their lives in a Monday lecturfl. 
Mora's stories and memoirs from her life as a second-gener­ati on Texan living in El Paso, Texas are her inspiration. 
"Writers are constantly col­lecting ideas: I call ideas kept on .my desk my compost. The joy of being a writer is that everything that happens to you is writing 
matflrial," said Mora. 
After her l'ather's death. Mora began to write her memoirs. She shanid a passage with the audience that illustrated the move her l'amilv was forced to 
make  from  Ei  Paso  to  Los

Mora encouraged students of Saint Mary's to reach out tooth­ers. 
"We focus more on what makes us comfortable, not oth­

Mora used Dallas as an exam­ple. where 96 languages are used in schools. She asked the audience if the United States will see this diversity as an advantage or a disadvantage. 
Pat Mora is an author of poet­ry, nonfiction. and children's books. She advocates building the community through litcraey. "My Own True ;'\Jame: New and Seleeted Poems for Young Adults" is her most recent book.

"Some [countries] don't test at all and some test haphazardly," said Malloy. 
Because the Olympic Committee does not require a standard method of testing in each country bP.fore they reach the games. athletPs can take performance-enhancing sub­stances until it is closer to the time of competition. Thero are several ways then for athletes tp hide the substances so that drug tests won't have positive results. 
"If they think they can beat the systf'm, some athletf's will," said Malloy. 
He said that even the U.S. Food and Drug Administration often approves substances that could provide athletes with an unfair advantage as a perfor­mance-enhancing drug. 
Malloy said an explanation for why athletes continue "duping," or using the performance­enhancing substances is because therfl is a "grfla.t pressure to win at all costs." 
"What we are trying to do is eliminate some of those situa­tions," said Malloy. 
In addition to the first report, Malloy said CASA plans to make similar comprehensive reports on substance abuse issues among high school. collegiate and professional athletes.

way of establishing poac11 on the face ol' the earth is through the grnat power of Perpetual Adoration of' the Blessed Sacrament." 
Which brings us back io Notre Dame. Many good things happen at Notrn Dame from the bottom up. Students in ND/SMC Right to Life, with llw coopera­tion of Campus Ministry, took tlrn initia­tive in 1997 to establish Eucharistic adoration as an integral part or the pro­lifo effort. It is countr:r-cultural. But it is solidly based. As the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, "The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as ·1ong as tho Eucharist species subsist. The Catholic Church has always offered ... to the ... Eucharist the cult of adoration, not only during Mass, but also outside of it, reserving the consecrated hosts ... exposing them to the solemn veneration of the faithful. and carrying tlwm in procession. 'The Church and Ll111 vvorld have a great need for Eucharistic wor­ship. Jesus a.waits us in this sncramm1l of love. Let us not rnf'use the timo to go to meet him in adoration, in contempla­tion full of faith and open to making amends !'or the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let our adoration never cease,'" quoting John Paul II. "Because Christ hims11lf is present in the sacrament of the altar, ho is to bn l11mored with the worship of adoration, 'To visit the Blessed Sacrament is ... a µroof of gratitude, an expression of love, and a duty of adoration toward Christ our Lord,"' quoting Paul VI again. 
Eucharistic adoration takes plao1 every Monday from 11 :30 p.m. lo Ttrnsday at 10:45 p.m. at St. Paul Chapel in Fisher Ilall and every Friday from noon to 5:00 p.m. at the Lady Chapel in the Basilica. Contact Jason Braun (4-3259), Mary Tarsha (4-2469) or Lisa Domidovir.h (4-0847) for infor­mation or to sign up for a haf!~hour 
slot. But you don't havn to contact any­body. .lust show up. Stay for as long or as short a limn as you wish. You can pray, read or just think. 
So why should we rousn oursnlvns to givo 30 minutes in this way'? One ma­son is that it works. Whnn Mother Teresa was askod, "What will convert Anrnrica and savo !Im world'?" slrn replied: "My answer is prayer. What w11 need is for every parish to comn lrnl'or11 Jesus in tho Blessed Sacrament in holy hours of prayer." Archbishop Fulton J. Shnen made a holy hour of adoration beforn thn Blessed Sacrament evPry clay of his priestly lif'e. lie said, "IT]hr1 Holy Hour is not a devotion; it is a sharing in thn work of rndempt.ion. In the Garden, our Lord contrasted two 'hours' -one was thn (!vii hour, 'this is your lmur' with which Judas could lurn out the; lights or the world. In contrast, our Lord asked, 'Could you not watch one hour with Mn?' lie askml for an hour of' reparation to combat the hour ol' evil. Not for an hour or activity did IIo plead but ror an hour of companionship. Tho purpose ol' the lloly IIour is to nncour­agn deop pnrsonal nncounter with Christ. God is constantly inviting us to conrn to Ilim, to hold 1:onv1ws(\ with JJim, to ask for such things as we need and to experience what a blessing them is in fellowship with llim." 
Through tlrn initiative of' studrmts we havn this opportunity hem at Notre Dame. Each week has 168 hours. It is di/'licult to imagine a morn practically cffnctive way to spend I/336th or our wrnik. And whilo you arn at it, remmn­hor that tlrnre is no rule against praying for tlrn success or t.lrn football tnam.

Understanding culture through ordinary life 
Two weeks ago Thursday, the Innsbruck group, wearied from lhroc endless weeks of intensive German class, boarded a train at llw Salzburg main station bound for Vienna. As our rail cars mowd for­ward the landscape of the Auslriau countryside fell before us. Small towns la.y scattered between the rolling turquoise and ycllow-grrnm hills topped by miniature cathedrals. Their white steeples reach for a paradise above the blue cloud dotted sky. The red-roofed houses of the country villages merged gradually into the asphalt streets and linear constructions of the Vienna neighborhoods. At 7 :30 in the evening we disembarked in the Austrian capi­tal and cultural center. A half-hour later, after brief jaunts on every type ofpublic transportation we f~ll into the dormitory style rooms of tho .lugendgastehaus. Our home for tho weekend held an airborne momory of many lost souls slwltered for a night before moving onward to Budapest or Paris or London. Exhausted I threw my belongings onto the bottom bunk and collapsed into the only bench in lhe room. I shared a can of Pringles and a Diet Coke with my roommate. We reveled in the American snack and our thoughts that linger in the houses and towns in which we spent 18 ordinary years. 
That night I joined seven courageous friends and took the I\-Li11n trol­ley into the Altstadt, the heart of Vienna, that possesses the defining marks of most downtowns in Austria: uneven, stone roads; a large cathedral; small cafes and postcard stands littered along the siclmvalks. The marbled majesty of the ancient aristocratic mansions standing sto­ically beside us caused the neat, modern suburban homes outsidP of Philadelphia or Chicago or Houston appear flimsy and primitiv1~. Even the most sturdy red brick building in my childhood home in sm11h fmst­ern Pennsylvania will crumble and sail like twigs in the wind b1~rorc the centuries old stone structures in Vienna or Salzburg fall. I wacl,\d for a moment in the sensation that life in Europe holds an understanding of consistency and past that life in North America tragically lacks. 
Our jeans and sneakers prevented us from entering any ol' !IH\ bars or bistros at the base of these architectural masterpieces. The wrnrnn occupying the tiny locales adorned only black pants or skins. l"on'.ing we Americans to feel dusty. grungy and foreign. In a quiet culturn I protest we ate at an outdoor cafe that served wonderful fried American ,·uisine: hamburgers, fried chicken baskets and french fries. 
Friday morning we met at 8:30, prepared to explore the clausLrnpho­bic rooms of Sigmund Freud's house. The stale air inside his library and observation rooms with double doors that allowed patient privar.y did not seem conducive to the creation of a new field of scientilic sl udy, yet the hum of the voices of the city below his secondfloor window inspired a keen interest in the mechanics of life. 
We left the birthplace of psychoanalysis and traveled that al"l.ernoon to the Schatzkammer. the treasury of the Habsburg monarchy. Tlw crowns of Franz Joseph and the crib of l'\apoleon glimmerncl i11 sDll yel­low radiance. The golden, woven images of the priestly garnwnls worn in the presence of kings and lords caused the eyes of we Anrnrif·a11 stu­dents to dance. Later as I strolled through the Viennese Altstadt, my thoughts turned to the paradox of the creation of these magnilirnnt things that tourists from around the world stand in awe befon'. . .\s lho Habsburg monarchs donned emerald encrusted crowns and pos(d as Titans, peasants labored on their estates and grew ill in tho filth 111" large cities. In light of the injustice surrounding their creation thosn lw11ored possessions made from extraordinary wealth assume a gaudy. tastnless aura. 
The next day we stood in groups of snven at a table eating (;nt~k mar­
inated chicken wraps beside an eager salesman yelling, "Sch111r·nk, 
schmeck. schmeck!" An old woman with her belongings in a gn)("(!ry 
bag and wearing a unraveling blue cape over a gray dress acrn;JNI us 
and declared us "schwein" for eating in the midst of her hungtr. \V('ll­
clothed and weight-conscious, I recognized that l walk with tlw grace of 
God among the modern world's nobilitv. 
That evening we left our jeans at the.Jugengastchaus and w:dk11d like 
royalty into a production of "Mozarl!," a musical with hints or 
"Amadeus" and background chords played frequently on The ll1!:1r in 
South Bend. The rhythmic movement ol' the notes lingered i11 111,1' head

of the ornate architectural wonders with stores selling replicas of cathe­
drals on their ground floor, but in small journeys into the nt'iglibm­

I .asl yP-ar The Observer published advertis0ments sulJmittod by groups whose sexual orientation I1as resulted in the denial of their official recogni­1ion by this University administration, an action u11ique among peer Catholic universities.

Providing a forum to debate 
I found Mr. Arkedis's Sept. 22 letter to display a disturbingly narrow view of what is "relevant to the majority of thls campus." Mr. Arkedis seems to be implying that gay rights are not a relevant issue to the het­erosexual students that comprise the majority at Notre Dame. 
Are gay rights only relevant to homosexu­als? Are women's rights only relevant to women? 
I faced many disturbing issues in my time at Notre Dame. Father Garrick was banned from saying mass at the Basilica after he had announced his sP-xual oriP-ntation to the public. There was a movement to shut down the Women's Resource Center because they provided a pamphlet with a Planned Parenthood phone number on it. The fact that I am a het0rosexual male did not diminish the importance of these issues; in fact, it made them all the more crucial. I have always appreciated The Observer's extensive coverage of these issues; it seems the staff at The Observer has always recog­nized the value of providing a forum for debating the truly important moral ques­tions facing the Notre Dame campus. 
In my four years at Notre Dame, I person­ally found the actions of the administration with regards to gay rights to be depressing­ly lacking in compassion. I believe that the administration displayed an antiquated view, often clinging to the official party line rather than thinking things through with their own hearts. The Observer's criticism of the administration over the years may seem harsh, but I believe it continues to play an important role in helping the stu­dents of Notre Dame understand and deal with the truly important issues.

Responding to Democratic tax plan 
111 rngard to the views expres_sed by Jeffrey Si u!lings in his Sept. 22 column as to the pro­p, lSlid tax plans of each presidential candidate, ~!1·. Stutlings demonstrates the well known t,t:llnique (perfected by the Democratic Party) ol" '"spin doctoring," in which the author careful­!, ust!S his language to create a false image of ti:,· ;1ctual facts. Mr. Stuffings accuses Governor l\11,.,IJ·s tax cut plan of lacking "compassion" lw1·,n1se the wealthy prosper the most. He cites llw fact that with Governor Bush's plan, 62 per­c111L 111" the tax cut benefits goes to the top 10 p,·n·tint of taxpayers. To quote the article, "The pI, 111 is a blessing for the very rich." Mr. S!llllings leads us to believe that Governor l\usli's plan treats the poor unfairly. This could 11"l IJn farther from the truth. 
\ \·hal Mr. Stunings conveniently omitted from Iiis ,1 rUcle was the fact that across-the-board 111";111s lliat everyone receives an equal percent­ag,, cut. l'rom their income taxes. What he also l,td,·d Lo mention was that the top 5 percent of L.:-.. 111comc earners contribute nearly 90 per­('.{,111 ul' all tax revenue. I believe that Mr. Siul1i11gs should also have explained that 
' IJ1,,·,1use an equal percentage tax cut returns 11H)J"c money to the individual that pays the most

1·;; ii".' 

More importantly, what we must realize is that the tax revenues are provided to the gov­ernment by the will ofthe people. No govern­ment has a natural right to the citizens' funds; under our system of government, those funds are granted to the government, by the people, for the benefit of all the people. 
The purpose of tax money is to fund govern­ment programs, not to be collected and be redistributed as the government sees fit. History has shown that the private use of capital is far more efficient than government use. In its most extreme case, the opposite use is known as socialism, which over the course of history, has proven to be far from efficient. Even today, we see Germany abandoning their "democratic socialistic system," which was based upon extremely high tax rates. because it cannot compete \-\1th capitalism as practiced within the United States. Ask any macroeconomics profes­sor this and they will agree. 
I\Ir. Stutfmgs makes a great argument with the limited facts that he provides the reader. But we must see the whole picture if we are to decide for ourselves. Mr. Stuffings, in keeping with the Gore campaign decision to limit critical debate (witness the two-month absence of press conferences} provides little in this respect. And speaking of soft money, how,much is it for a night in the Lincoln bedroom?

CONCERT RIEVIEW 
Contagious euphoria consumes fans at Phish 
By TIM BODONY Scene Music Critic 
Phish guitarist Trny Anastasio has to 

wonder how things got this far. Night af'tPr night, he presides over an ocean of bobbing heads and flailing limbs, his !'ace displaying a combination of elation and intensity. The band that began by playing "Proud Marv" at a University of Vermont HOTC dancA 17 years ago ~ow boasts a cult following that packs arenas and Phish, who filled their first set with unin­spired versions ofsome of their best songs. 
The band was spinning its wheels at the starting line with a very sterile version of "Om,vn \'Vith Disease," then moving quickly and unimaginatively through classics like "Wilson" and "Slave to the Traffic Light." They redeemed themselves with solid ver­sions of "Bathtub Gin" and the rpie "You Enjoy Myself," which features trampoline­aided choreography and stunning light work by technician Chris Kuroda. 
But overall, the band seemed tentative 


amphitheatres across the country. And they did it by providing lis­teners with an overall musical experience, not just two hours of loud rock and roll, but an Bntirn subculture based on the pursuit of good grooves and good times. 
One has to question whnther the "Phish cul­ture" sometimes over­shadows the music itsnlf, but nevertlrnless Phish still receive criti­cal acclaim for their artistic talents. Holling Slone goes as !'ar as labeling them "the most important band of' tho 
'90s." 
With all tlw sidPshows and distractions that accompany them. Phish tuok thr. stagr last weekend at the Allstatti Arnna in suburban Chicago. and ovc:( thP course of two nights demonstrated an excep-

Day One -Friday, September 19, 2000 

For many fans, the day got off to an inauspicious beginning thanks to tho Bosemont Police Department. which was deployed throughout the parking lots with military-style ferocity. Their campaign of tf1rror brought the normally uninhibited lot scene to a virtual standstill in some areas as spil!Bd beer mixed with rain to drown many fans' spiriL<;. 
All attention then rightfully turned to 
and failed to establish a 
good flow between 
songs. But things would 
only get better from 
heni. 
It would seem that Trey, self-critical as he is, delivered a Knute Hockne-style speech during the set break, because he and his bandmates came out with much greater focus and intensity. 
Keyboardist Page McConnell employed some tasteful Moog work to drive the funk­driven "Tube" and "Ghost." while Trey filled "Reba" with his characteristically smooth and expressive solo work. 
A cover of tlrn beauti­ful and contemplative Los Lobos tune "When the Circus Comes" slowed the pace down before the band served up a heaping helping of 
"Meatstick," which was accompanied by a dance resembling a prehistoric equivalent to the Macarena. Trey jokingly explained to the audience that on their recent tour of Japan, Phish were surprised to Jind that the dance had already taken the country by storm. So as tribute to the Moatstick­crazed Japanese youths, drummer .Jon Fishman and Page McConnell recited the chorus in Japanese as Trey and bassist Mike Gordon put down their instruments and led the crowd in the dance. The crowd ate it up, and so did the band, as Trey con­tinued to weave the "Meatstick" melody in between the opening bars of "Run Like an Antelope." 
After a nod to Hendrix with "Axis: Bold

As Love," Phish closed the book on a great second half to a show that suffered from a lackluster beginning. Most notably, the "Meatstick"-"Antelopn" combination was a true display of what Phish can be: imagina­tive. funny and unpredictable. 
Day Two -Saturday, September 23, 2000 
With the second show of a two-night stand come renewed hopes and expecta­tions. Phi.sh fans are notorious for treating songs like presents on a Christmas wishlist: if Santa didn't bring a "Mike's Song" or a "Harpua" tonight, then maybe he will bring one next time. Like kids on Christmas morning, fans hurried into the Allstate Arena again on Saturday night to their summer show at Alpine Valk:y, wlrnn Trey completely reddined the tune with some amazingly liquid and nrnlodic solo work. this rendition stayed fairly close to the recorded version. The highlight of the set was undoubtedly "Scent of a Mule," which began in normal fashion as an upbeat bluegrass song, and then complete­ly changed directions as Mike and Trey kicked their way into "The Tarentclla," transforming the AllstatB Arena into a giant Italian wedding reception. But before too many Godfather quotes could be uttered, Mike led the band back into "Scent ofa Mule." 
After a soaring "Fast Enough for You" and a "Piper" that dissolved into an ambi­ent jam, Phish rocked the set to a close with "Character Zero." 
see what special treats awaited them. And jolly old Saint Phi.sh did not disappoint. 
The surprises began with Phish's first attempt at the Crazy Horse song "Come On Baby, Let's Go Downtown," a steady rocking tune that primed the crowd for the things to come. They shifted from rock to fimk with the head­bobbing "The Moma Dance," and then back to rock again with onfl of' the greatest arena tunes of alt time ­Edgar Winter's "Frankenstein." 
Phish is certainly not the archetypal arena rock band with walls of amplifiers and tight pants, so their perfor­mance of this tune is almost comical. But as a brief diversion, it

works. They maintained the high energy level by closing out the set ,vith three older favorites, capped off by superb version of "Stash" accompanied by a glowstick war. This song has t.o be considered the Phish trademark, based on its enigmatic lyrics and dramatic composition, which steadily builds a mood of tension leading up to a point of release when Trey's guitar pierces the air with screaming high notes. 
For the encore, Ralphie got his Red Ryder BB gun in the form of the wistful anthem "Sleeping Monkey." Just when the song could have ended, the spotlight fell on Jon Fishman, who delivered two choruses on his own before the band joined in for a few more. Hands were joined and tears were shed. It truly was a fit­ting end to a weekend filled with unBxpncted twisl'i and turns. 
Over the course of two fl-ights and four sets of music, Phish played only two songs off of their new album, rarmhouse. This fact speaks volumes about the band's unique posi­tion in the music world today. Phish does not tour to support an album -they record 

albums to take a break from touring. Without having to worry about. "playing the hits,'' Phish has the freedom to do any­thing at any time. And freed from the weight of predictability, fans tirelessly return to Phish in search of new highs, new rnvelations, or just a good tim(\ in the presence of likCl-minded people.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Sleater-Kinney revamp punk attitude on All Hands 
By SAM DERHEIMER 
Scene MLlsic Editor 
Ever wonder what Nirrnna would have sounded like had Kurt Cobain been born a woman? Sleater-Kinney has an answer to that question -stop making the comparison. 
After four critically-acclaimed albums, the all-girl punk-rock trio from Olympia has rightfully come into their own. And after their last album. The Hot Rock. faltered commerciallv, anrl the hanrl was nailed with criticisms of selling· out. and losing touch, Sleater­Kinnev has returned to face tho fickle world of rock music· and offer fans one of their best albums ever in All Hands On the Bad One. 
Sleater-Kinney have gone bark to their roots. In All Hands On the Bad One, we again see the quick, sharp punk rock bonded with the raw. emotional poetry of lead vocalist Corin Tucker's lyrics and the band's evPr present pro-feminist attitude that SleaLer-Kinney did so well on their tirst few albums. 
As a whole. the album is much more complex and inventive than Sluater-Kinney has shown in the past. And for the first tinrn, thHy also vPrge on achiPVing some much needed musical diversity. 

The album's first single, "You're No Rock 'n Roll Fun" is both catchy and popish. That's right. popish. It's not everyday a band like Sleater-Kinney makes anything that can be labeled as "popish," but the thing is, it works. 
Tucker's sarcastic and playful lyrics take hard jabs at the pop world. while at the same time, the crafted riffs by lead guitarist Carrie Brownstein coupled with the drums of' Janet Weiss fill out an unbe­lievably alluring rock-pop beat behind her. It's the perfect anti-pop, pop song. And that's what Sleater-Kinney is all about -quality music, with a punch. 

However, for the majority of the album, the band has revamped and nicharged its riot grrl (no, that's not a typo) punk attitude, sending the album on a blitz of female adrenaline and fury. 
"Ironclad" might as well be an outtake from Pearl Jam's grunge Bible, Ten. "Male Model" is an all-out punk assault, as Tucker crafts some of her finest jaded, girl-power style lyrics set to a blistering guitar and heavv drums, "You don't own the situation, 
· 


All Hands On the Bad One, the fifth studio album from the all-girl punk trio Sleater-Kinney, reestablishes the band as one of the most genuine and talented punk bands in the U.S. scene.

"Was It a 

.... 

Lie?" displays the real. and at times, brutal power of Brownstein's guitar. Combined with transcendently haunting vocals from Tucker, the song is easily one of the best on the album. 
Suprisingly, the band also branches out in All Hands On the Bad One, showing a depth in song writing that bad been noticably absent on past releases. In tracks like "Leave You Rehind" and "The Swimmer" an airy guitar and layered vocals creates a much softer and more harmonized sound than Sleater-Kinney is used to producing. And though most of the album is much heavier and faster. the few slower, "prettier" songs serve well to pace the album, and present Tucker with a chance to show off her true vocal range. 
All Hands On the Bad One is a dramatic mixture of punk, pop and rock from one of the most celebrated girl bands in America. And though the stereotype that all punk songs sound the same is not exactly destroyed by All Hands, Sleater-Kinney do offer their fans something true, honest and exceptionally power­ful. 
If nothing else, it can be said that Sleater-Kinney makes their own music -music they want to make. In world of over-produced, predisposed corporate rock crap, Sleater-Kinney has crafted something gen­uine and honest. And this is what makes Sleater­Kinney such a quality band. It's something that comes through in every song they write. It comes through in Tucker's vocals that convey as much passion and angst as Nirvana fans could ever dream possible. It comes through in the guitar riffs that can't help but garner praise from even the harshish Goldfinger fan. And it comes through in an attitude that separates them from everyone. 
Sleater-Kinney are amazingly talented musicians who write from their hearts and play from their souls. All Hands On the Bad One is merely the natural prod­uct of this.

Vince Carter went ovflr Frederic Weis likfl he was a 7­foot-2 prop in a dunk contest.

Carter's personal dunk cata­log had a new entry. 
"I don't do them for my enjoyment. I just do them because that's what hap­pens." said Carter, who 
recalled that he  once dunked  
over  7-foot  Dikembe  
Mutornbo. too.  

"Th1\ only time I've seen a play like that is when I jumpncl over my 4-year-old son on one of those Nerf ball sets,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. 
Carter scored the i\merirans' next two points on an al ley-oop pass off the backboard by Gary Payton, and it drew a mere buzz by comparison. That's how incredible the previous dunk was. 
"That was a 10, maybe a 12," Tim Hardaway said. "I've never seen anybody jump over a i-footer. It got us pumped up, and I think they were ratllt>d for three, four minuLns after that." 
llighlights aside. the Americans had plenty of trou­ble early and let France creep back into the game late.

U.S. coIDes on strong to earn spot in finals 
Associated Press 
BLACKTOWN, Australia 
Cheered on by its baseball brethren in the morning and its soccer sisters at night. the U.S. softball team avenged two of its three first-round losses on Monday to sweep into the gold­medal game. 
Jennifer McFalls. who scored the winning run over Australia, hugs teammate Christie Ambrosi after the 1-0 victory by the U.S. put them in the gold­medal game. Stacey Nuveman homered in the third extra inning to beat China 3-0 in the first game and set up a grudge match with Australia. In the nightcap, Lisa 
Lasorda and the U.S. baseball team. whir,h came by after prac­ticing on an adjacent field. cele­brated by r.hanting "U-S-A!" The crowds at the night game were more hostile, hoping to cheer their Aussies to the gold medal. But the women's soccer team made itself heard, coming out to the Sydney suburbs after arriv­ing from Canberra earlier in the day. 
"The baseball learn. when they came to that game. it was a tremendous lift for us," Fernandez said. "And then to look up in the stands and see the women's soccer team up there ... I just want to thank the fans of USA softball who stuck with us through the tough times."

Australia  won  the bronze  

medal. China. which lost to the Americans in the gold-medal game in the 1996 Olympics but beat them 2-0 in 14 innings in the round-robin this year, fin­ished fourth. Heavily favored before a three-game losing streak brought them to the brink of elimination, the Americans clinched at least a bronze earlier in the day when Nuveman homered in the 10th to beat China.

But the next two batters posed problems: they had both home­r e d off Fernandez in the Olympics before. Peta Edebone, who hit a 13th-inning homer off her to win in the preliminaries, grounded out to third with one out in the seventh. Joanne Brown, who hit a game-winning homer off Fernandez in the Americans' only loss of the 1996 Olympics -spoiling a perfect game in the 10th -bounced it back to the mound to end the game.

"A few mistakes on behalf of the offense lead to Carroll's points," said Knott co-captain Brian Pawloski. 
Carroll zeroed in and took advantage of the Jugg mis­takes. Two consecutive inter­Cf~ptions by Fred Kottemann and Jim Butz were returned for touchdowns and gave Carrol a 14-7 by the end of the firsl half. . 
After the half Knott started kicking in. Knott's captain Pat Virtue had two toul:hdowns rushing, running the ball really hard Giving the Juggs a 20-14 lead over the Vermin. Pawloski was very pleased with the offense. 
"They did a lot better this game," he said. "I know we have the talent," captain Geoff Polk said. "It was just a matter of putting it into play." 
Fisher 22, Zahm 14 
The del'enses of Zahm and Fisher Hall surrendr.red a com­bined total of five point5 in the first week of interhall football play. Consequen1.ly. both teams anticipated a grueling, low-scoring affair in thr,ir match-up on Sunday. 
If the fortunes of interhall fate confirm one thing, howev­er, it is to expect the unexpect­ed. In a game defined by explosive passing, the Fisher Wave pnwailed, 22-14. 
Zahm took over on downs after a goal-line stand by the defense and quickly went to work. Quarterback Dan Burke found Chris Bystcdt for a 45­yard gain. Forced into a fourth and goal situation from the five, Burke again looked to pass and connected with Joe Saenz for a touchdown. Brian Zant's extra point made the score 7-0 in favor of the Rabid Bats. After holding Fisher, Zahm regained control of the ball and Burke and Bystedt combined for another touch­down drive. This put the bats up 14-10. 
The Wave, however, were hardly preparnd to throw in the towel. After a personal foul penalty positioned Fisher inside Zahm territory, Levkulich found Stnvc Dohertv !'or a 40-yard touchdown, foi­lowed by a two point conver­sion. 
Zahm Hall's solid play in the first half was ovorshadowed by miscues and the opportunism of Fisher in the second set. 
The nnal 60 minutes were a "dr>wnward spiral" for the Bats. said Zahm captain Brian Zant.

Fish or took fuU advantage or their field position, putting together a four-play seqtwnce which cul­minated. in a touchdown by running back HichiP llendina. 
After regaining possession, Zahm sought to reestablish their lead. Af'tnr gaining a first down, Burke heaved a 55-yard completion to the cndzone. The score was called back and a series of costly penalties were called against Zahm. When the dust settled, Zahm was pinned at its own 1 It lini\ confronted with second and :,6 yards to go.

tion. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Levkulich to Doherty gave Fisher their first lead, which with a two point conver­sion amounted to 22-14. 
Zahm nearlv scored with seconds remaining, but the dock ran out and Fisher held on to the win a game they said was critical. ­
"We were desperate," said · captain Dahx Marrs. "The sea­sons arc short, so every game really matters." 
The Wave had planned to focus on hard-nosed, aggres­sive defense; ultimately, they delivered despite Zahm's early success. 
"We need to step up our pass defense," said Marrs, '·but this game shows that Wfl can come from behind and our offense can sr:orfl." 
Marrs believes. that his team was able to stay focused and perform consistently, trail,; that the Wave hopes to maintain in the crucial games ahead. 
'"We were able to execute on offense," said Dean Korolis, "and we're looking forward to Sorin next'week." 
Zahm, on the other hand, suffered more than one loss on Sunday. In addition to seeing their lead evaporate, the Rabid Bats lost cornerback Pat Mitchell, who broke his ankle, for the season. Pete Henning, an offensive lineman, also injured his ankle, but Zant dP,sc,:ibed his status as "day to day. 
Despite their disappoint, the Bats intend to make some adjusts and repair the breach created bv Fisher.

Overtime win over Bulldogs pulls Belles out of slump 

By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Spom Wrirer 
The soccer Belles are on a roll after pulling themselves oul of a season slump Saturday with a victory against Adrian College. 
As they enter the game against the Calvin Knights today, they hope to continue putting their troubles to rest. 

"This last [game] on Saturday sent us in the right direction," said Belles' co-captain Katy Robinson. "We'll be ready to play." 
The Belles defeated the Bulldogs 1-0 in overtime for the second year in a row. They would rather not repeat last year's game with f.alvin. a 5-0 loss to the team that later linished second in the MIAA behind Kalamazoo. 

"They have always given us a lot of competition." Robinson said. "But everyone seems to be in good spirits and I hope it will continue through Tuesday's game." 
While the offense has been spending time improving its shooting accuracy, the defense has not been idle. 
"Jared [Hochstetler. the defen­sive coach] is giving us a few new things that the defense can do," said fellow co-captain Jessica Klink. "Defensively we are learn­ing some new skills and this is the game to use it in." 
Calvin finished with a 6-2 MIAA record and was 11-7 -2 overall for the 1999 season. April Phelps and Tricia Dyk. All-MIAA First Team selflctions. return Lo the Knights' lineup, while Saint Mary's All­

First Team selection. Katy Barger, graduated last year. Knights' goalie _Christian Recker finished last season with a 2.05 GAA. Belles netminder Tia Kapphahn saw some action at forward in the overtime portion of the win against Adrian while freshman goalie Laura Metzger replaced her in goal. Belles head coach ~ason Milligan was happy with her play. 
"Laura Metzger did a really good job," Milligan said. "We're going to try and utilize her more and more but [the position in goall is pretty much game to game." 
Overall. Milligan was pleased to see his team adapt to different positions and plays as the Belles settle into their season. 
"We've had a chance this year to get a lot of people experience in different areas," Milligan said. "It is working out really well. A lot of people are stepping in and fill­ing tho holes." 
Despite their record in the past, the Knights sit behind Saint Mary's in MIAA rnnl<lngs, with a 2-2-0 mark in MIM and a :~-5 mark overall, compared to Saint Mary's 2-1-1 rnnfernnce tally and 2-4-1 season record. 
"We had a good result this weekend." Milligan said. "It's been real similar to a lot of games yve'veplayed, but this one we fin­ished. 
Milligan is confident in his team·s ability to withstand the Knights' challenge and come out of the match with a home victory for the first time since the home opener against Alma. 
"I know that we will hit the field really well and we'll get many opportunities Ito scorn]." Milligan said.

B.P. captain Jenny Wahoske was upset that her team's last second attempt to score failed, but shA hrld a positive attitude about the game. 
"At least we are moving for­ward." shc> said. "Last week we got a loss. and this week we managed a tie, so next we're hoping for a win." 
B.P. will face Farley next at 9 
p.m. tonight. Badin will square off against Off-C.ampus at 7 p.m. 
Walsh 13, Farley 8 
Farley's Finest were not up to tlrn chal!Pnge this Sunday at Stepan fiPld, as the Wild Women of' Walsh IIall defeated them by a sound 13-8 margin. 
"I think WP canrn out too slow in the first half'." said Farlev coach Mike Hogan. "By the ser:­ond half Wf' were warmed up, but by then it was too httP." 
Tlw ganw was dominatnd by thP young Walsh offense from thn ouL-,et. 
Aftnr an unsuccessful drive by Farlr.y, Walsh drove up the field and sc:orcd the first touchdown of tlrn game led by quartrrbar,k Gn\tr,hen Mrlntvre. Alternate quarterback Lau;en Walsh took control of the offense for the point after. however. 
"Usuallv, he (r,oar,h StcvP Dillenburger) starts me, and then Lauren (Walsh) will go in," said :vlclntyrr.."And he'll rotate us as rn~eded. This time I played a lot more than usual, though. The running plays were really work­ing and the offense opened up a lot of holes for me." 
Hogan named the Wild Women's flexible offense as one. of the for,tors that contributed to unhinging Farley's defense. 
"We had a tough time stopping the run." he said. "Thfly ran a lot of differrnt misdirection plays that we hadn't seen before. The experienr,c will br good for us in tlrn long run." 
Following Walsh's early touch­down, Farley called a time-out to regroup. 
They remained unable to pull it together. howrvcr. as quarter­back Jrnnv Geraci threw threP incomplrtc· passAs. 
"Wo were foeling the pres­sure," Gnad said. "Their defense was really good at get­ting in to the quarterbar,k. I'd say that was the most defensive pres­sure wA've come up against." 
The srr,ond half of the game looked somewhat brightnr for Farley. as tlrnir offense settled into the game and was able to get the Finest on the scoreboard. Derensr also looked tighter as· Farley got more of a fed /'or the Yaried Walsh plays. 
"It's important to note that we wore missing some key players on defensr, like Hebecca Glatz." said Hogan. "The girls who filled in played well. but they weren't as experienced." 
Lauren Walsh stayed at the helm of Walsh's offense for much of the ser,ond half. in Walsh's first possession, she was able feed the ball once again to Kenny, who ran to Farley's five for a Walsh first down. 
The Wild Women quickly con-verted yards to points· as Walsh threw to Jen Lynch for their sec­ond touchdown of the game. 


Farley took advantagr of a penalty called on Walsh and put together their first scoring drive of the game. On a fourth down play, Geraci passed to McKay. who ran it in for Farley's first score or the game. The Finest then sucr,essfully went for the subsequent two-point r,onver­sion. 
With only four minutes remaining on the clock. howevrr, the Finest wore unable to catch up to the Wild Women. who hardly faltered in remainder of lhe second half. 
"I don't know what happPned -it took us half the game to get going. and they were a good tf1am, so you can't expert to br sleeping for half the game and still win," said llogan. "But we're not out ofit by any means." 
The Finest will play Breen Phillips this Tuesday. 
"I think we'rp in t.h1\ running this year for thP playoffs," said Walsh. 
The Wild Women's next match-up will be against the l\kGlinn Shamro1:ks. 
Pasquerilla West 7, McGlinn 6 
It's all part or the Notre Dame folklore: the grn<rn jerseys, unfa­miliar turf, trailing at the half. and a last minute drive down the field. The script was thAre for the Shamrocks on Sunday. 
Unfortunately, the pen was in the hands of a Purple Weasel. as PW topped McG!inn 7-6 on Stepan fields. 
Both teams got o!T to a rocky start in the first half. The Weasels' first drive was stalled by an interception, and McGlinn proceeded to turn the ball back over on a loss of clowns. 
The pace picked up on PW's 
second possrssion. Captain 
Amanda Gallen started things off 
with a 30-yarcl run down the 
field. 

Quarterback Leslie Schmidt took over from there, finding senior Kori Yelle in the end zone for the PW tour,hdown. Gallen provided what would turn out to be a crucial extra point for the Purple Weasels. 
The Shamrocks could not respond on their next attempt. The PW defense allowed three receptions by junior Christa Gray, but the McGlinn movement stopped there. 
Quarterbar,k Jodie Greaney was sacked by Alanna Lungren on third down, and the Shamrocks couldn't get enough for the first down. 
The Shamrocks and Purple Wensels saved the best ar,tion for last in the second half. 
PW seemed to be in control aftrr two consecutive sacks on Greaney. The Purple Weasels took the ball over at midfield, but Leslie Schmidt's first pass was interrnpted by Becca Williams. who sprinted down the sidelines for a McG\inn touchdown. Unfortunately for thr. Shamrocks. Grcanr.y's Axtra point pass was broken up. and they still trailed by one. 
Thn Shamrock del'ense was drtermined to give the offrnse one more shot at a score. Becca Williams came up big again, sacking Leslie Schmidt and forc­ing PW to punt with just over one minute left in the game. 
Greaney completed a 20-yard pass to Gray, and the Shamrocks seemed to be on their way to vic­tory. 
However. Greaney's next pass was intercepted by ironwoman Amanda Gallen, and the Purple Weasels squeaked out a win. 
"We've had three close games this season. but our defense has been really good," said Gallen. 
McGlinn coach Geoff Heiple was disappointed with the loss. but he remains positive. 
"We need to work on our exe­
cution," said Heiple. "The plays 
are there, so we don't need to 
change our strategy."

MEN 's INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 

Dawgs' defense holds off Griffins in narrow victory 
By TODD NIETO, JAivlES 
VERALDI and MATT CAS­
SADY 
Spores Writers 
Oespite a gritty effort by Lim Stanford defense, the Alumni Dawgs rnntinued on thoir path to Notre Dame Stadium with their second cons1icutive shutout 7-0. 
Other than an early touchdown by Alumni. the defomms dictated lhe action and forcod frustration on the opposing ollensos. 
"Our dtifense won the game. Stanford played really well, and we were happy to get some points on the board," said Alumni captain Mitch Karam. 
Alumni got all the points they needed on their opening drive with a 30-yard strike from fresh­m c II quarterback Chris Cottingham to wido receiver Jon Bevilacqua. Hrandon Nunnink nailed the extra point to put the Dawgs up for good. 
From that point on the Alumni defense held ils ground. Lim~backer Baily Siflgfriod, defen­sive end Tommv Dmnko and cor­m1rback Nathan Trimmnr led the "Dawhry D". 
Siegfried provided pressure over lhe middle of llw. field with five tackles and a couple key pa'is brmtk-ups. Dmnko put the heat on the Stanford quarterback v11it.h two sacks. Trimmer came through with a pa<;s brnak up on 3rd and 12 from the Alumni 46 and an interception that sealed the.deal !.ttc in the gam1). 
"It was a dcfonsive battle. Wn played good considering practice was hard to get in. They were a pretty good team and we are looking forward to next week." said Siegfried. 
A key turning point came in the third quarter. Stanford had stopped the Alumni olfonse forc­ing a punt that would have given them the ball in good tield posi­tion. However. one of Stanford's return men got caught up with Pat Paquette of Alumni and was called for a holding. giving Alumni another chance to get a first down. and they did on a pownrf'ul 4th and 1 run by tail­back Alex Hoodhouse. 
The Stanford defense played a solid ganw, !Pd by defensive ends Shamus liol11n and John Dickas, and dcl'ensive tackle Josh Kaakua. Tht!y continually shot down the 1\lumni oiTAnse and put their olfrnsc in a good position to win the ganw. 
The problem for Stanford was their o!T.-ns,;, which was held scornlPss for the sAcond straight week. Ewn with an impressive pcrforn11rnre by tailback JC Perez, tlw ( ;l"illin's offensA could not pul any poinL'i on the board. 
"Our cl.Pl('llse played really well. Thny just gave up a couple big early plays," said Stanford coach Brendon Gearv. "Our offense IH\('ds to get on track. We should do IHillPr next week." 
Alumni improved to 2-0 and tlrn sn.1.son and will meet 1-1 Kerman 1wxl week. Meanwhile Stanford drops to 0-2 and awaitc; a winless ()'J\lpilJ team Sunday. 
Keough 14, Morrissey 0 
Sunda\· 111"11·rnoon the Keough Kangar;ws won their season opening i11tPrhall football game against llin Morrissey Manorites 14-0. 
ThP !\fonurites have started the season with a 0-2 record. 
By tlw .-ml or the first half, Keough was up on the Manoritcs 7-0. Thn 1'1~m1gh touchdown was a result of' a long bomb from sophomorP quarterback Andy !less lo rn~shman wide receiver Brian Adams. 
.Keough's dnfonse was solid throughout llw game as senior Paul Didio intercepted three Manorih~ passes. 
"Our ddinst! was really strong and wm; ,vhat won us the game," said captain nyan Yorkery. 
The sc1:011d Keough touchdown was a rnsult of another long pass from Andy I IPss to receiver Brian Adams.

but another turnover eliminated their hopes of scoring, Keough defensive player, Michael Wilson, recovered the ball when a Manorite running back was stripped. 
Late in the fourth quarter. the Manorites b<>gan making their way downfield again. They had the same rnsults whim they encountered tho Kangaroo defense and could not score. 
Dillon 16, Keenan 0 
With a lot or pep and a second half rallv, Dillon forced Keenan to "revue'' what went wrong Sunday as the Big Rfld defeal.ed the Knightc; lh-0. 
rar from the festivity and laughter provided annually by two of' Notre Dame's most popu­lar dorm events, no one was kid­ding around when two of inter­hall football's undefeated teams collided at Stepan Fields. 
"Dillon played really hard," said Keenan captain Herb Ginrgio. "I don't think we really matched their intensity level."

In the first half, however, nei­ther offense looked particularly inspired as the defenses con­trolled the game early on. 
After Dillon Junior Chris Crane returned a Keenan punt to the Keenan 33 yard line, Dillon's offense came alive. Junior quar­terback Tayl Odom found senior fullback Jason Visner who rum­bled toward the Keenan goal lino where he was forced out at the onA inch line. 
"I thought I was in," said Visner. "But the referee didn't see it that way." 
The ball was placed just an inch from the Keenan goal lim1 and Dillon had just one play remaining before halllime. Odom was hAld out of lhe rmd zone to end the half. 
Dillon coach Omar Munoz approached the goal line stand Vvith guarded optimism. 
"f knew that could have shifted the momentum in their favor," he said. "But in that situation you have to refocus on what got you [inside the Keenan one,] not on the negative that you didn't get in 
!the end zone!." Giorgio agreed with Munoz's assessment. 
"That goal line stand really pumped the defense up." he sairl. "We thought it could have turned the game in our favor. In the sec­ond half the defense came out with more intensity, but we kind of got discouraged when the offense couldn't I establish itself'.]" 
After alternating 3 and out pos­sessions in the second half. Dillon took over on ils own 32. The Big Rerl then embarked on a drive that would effectively end Keenan's hopes of winning the gam<>. Dillon kept the ball on the ground seven straight plays. Visner Crane and .JP Camardo each carried the hall for Dillon as the Big Red plowed through Keenan's defensive front. Finally Visner bullied his way into the end zone from five yards out and, following the two point convPr­sion. the score was 16-0. 
"This game was a wakn up call,'' he said. "We have a lot to work on b~fore we play Alumni next week.

McGlinn hasn't won a game yet, but the Shamrocks are counting on a team effort for a win tonight against Walsh. 
The team is looking to quar­terback Jody Greaney, receivers Catherine Corke and Mary Lenzini, and defensive players Rebecca Williams and Brianne McNicholas for solid . pr,rformances in th0 game. 
"We lost to Farley 7-6 last week, but we've sl~own great improvements between our lirst and second game. We're looking to get our offense in gear and counting on our line­backers. If we compkite pass­es we should do well," said McGlinn captain Jamie Glasser. 
The Walsh Wild Women find no reason to mess with the techniques they have used in the sr,ason thus far. Undr,feated in their last three games, they beat Farley 13-8 most recently. 
"Our defensive line came up big in our last game, pressur­ing the quarterback. Rebecca Craig. Angela Polsinelli we-re great on defense. Tiara

Jefferson had an intercep­tion," said Walsh captain Melissa Beiting. 
Like McGlinn, Walsh will also be looking for teamwork to bring home a victory. 
"We're hoping to come out with a good team effort by both the offense~ and defense and come out with a victory," said Beiting. 
Breen Phillips vs. Farley 
As mid-season play begins in Women's Gold League, urgency becomes a part of the lives of a few teams. One of those teams includes the Breen-Philips Babes as their regular season record is cur­rently a 0-1-1. 
With a disappointing loss to the Off-Campus team and a very hard fought tie to Badin, the Babes look for guidance in several of their key players. For a good win the defense is a must according to captain Jenny Wahoske. 
With great play from their defensive and offensive lines, led by Natasha Potter and Wahoske, a tum-around in the season is a great possibili­ty. 
"If we· maintain our improvement, good things can happen," says Wahoske. Kelly Deckelman will also be a key player to watch. In Sunday's game against Badin, Deckelman ·had an intercep­tion late in the game that she nearly ran for a game-winning touchdown. It's plays like this that the Babes will need throughout the season and are capable of producing. 
On the other side of the field will be a strong Farley squad. Led by captain Rebecca Glatz. Parley's finest will also be hoping to improve on their 1-2 record. In another "now or never" situation, the team looks to its captain Rebecca Glatz as well as defensive standout Jen Morgan on thfl line. 
"We have a strong defense," says Glatz. "We're definitely looking for them to step it up." 
Offensively, the Finest will be led quarterback Jenny Geraci and running back Katie Buffalino. The team is looking for a lot of support from the sidelines and teamwork on the field. With these ingredients, they have a great chance to win the game, according to freshman Erin Fitzpatrick. 
The game will be held Tuesday night at 9 p.m. under the lights at Stepan Field.

THE 


1980 Olympic boycott hits home for Notre Dame staff 

By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Spores Editor 
A stab of regret hits Jill Lindenfeld as she struggles to watr,h the 2000 Olympic Games. 
Debbie Brown feels drawn to the events although see.ing the U.S. participants causes her a twinge of heartache. See Also

cialist in physical education. and Brown. the Notre Dame head volleyball coach. qualified for the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. Their chance to compete was ripped away when President .Jimmy Carter announced that the U.S. would boycott thf-1 Games because of USSR actions in AfghanisI.an. 
"! had rnLxed feelings. I can honestly say." said Lindenfeld. who qualified as part of thf> 
U.S. 
field hockev team in the first vear the Olympics includ;,d the sport. "[ originally felt proud, like it was kind of my duty. that the 

U.S. 
would be doing a lot of things against Afghanistan. and this was just one thing>But that didn't last very long because nothing really came out of it. It seemed useless and didn't seem to prove anything." 


Brown. a part of the first U.S. volleyball team to earn a berth in the Olympics. also grappled with the U.S. decision to boyr.ott the Games. 
"I think a lot of people really questioned the decision," Brown said. "When vou look at what the bovcott was meant to do and meant to accompli~h. did it accomplish what it was meant to'' No. To me, it was not the right 
thing to do, especially with the games meant to symbolize peace and unity." The boycott didn't come as a complete shock to the Amerir.an athletes. 
"Thero was talk early in January of 1980 of the possibility of a boycott," Brown said. "We really refused to believe it and hoped that things would work out and we would be able to go. It wasn't that we hadn't been prepar­ing ourselves for it. It was still a shock and a disappointment just to think that something you had been striving for for so long kind of vanished before your eyes. It was a really hard pi!I to swallow." 
The lost opportunity was a doubly difficult blow for Lindenfeld and Brown. Their teams were in strong positions to win medals. -and both women were reaching the ends of their careers. Lindenfeld, who still bubbles with enough energy to bowl over younger athlel!is, played on the U.S. field hockey team from 1971 to 1980. The team toured other nations every summer. seeking out top-notch tourna­menL'> in which to test their mettle. During the year, Lindenfeld was in school, first as an undergraduate at Westchester (Pa.I College, next as a local high school teacher and finally as a graduate student at USC. 
The '80 Games. the first to include field hockey, were her only chance for Olympic glory, as five knee operations began to take their toll on her body. 
"I knew I had had five knee opP.rations and been on the national team for nine years." Lindenfeld said. "It was my last chance. I wasn't going to be trying out in four years." 
Until Carter pulled the U.S. from con­tention. the field hockev tP.am was a favorite to win. Of the six tea.ms qualified for the Games. the U.S. was ranked third. rt had also beaten the top two teams in previous games.

MEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 
Penalties plague St. Eds in 21-7 loss to Sorin 
By COLIN BOYI.AN, TODD 
NIETO and JOHNNY 
LEITNER 
Spores Writers 
St. Edwards' football team r,ould have the makings of a potent run-and-shoot offense, if only it could stop shooting itself in the foot. 
A penalty-plagued 21-7 loss to Sorin left many of the St. Ed's players with a bad taste in their mouths as f1ags became the hall­mark of an otherwise relatively nondescript game. 
Sorin opened the scoring on a dPep pass play from quartPrback Pete BP.!edcn to receiver Antione Tobias. The Otters dominated with a solid running game, cappRd by two tour.hdowns from running back Dave KnPsek. In the end. it was St. Eds' mistakes that tipped the game in Sorin's favor. 
"We just killed ourselves with penalties." said quarterback Tim Greene. "It seemed like every time we had the ball we were facing a 2nd and 18." 
Not only did penalties give the Stedsmen unfavorable field posi­tion. but they also wiped out sev.­eral key passing plays. A 50 yard pass completion from Greene to receiver Nick Sciola was called back because a lineman moved too far downfield. Several other completions were also negated bv St. Eds' infractions. 
Sorin simply played their stnmgths and let their opponent self-destruct. 
"We were a little disorganized on offense. but I think our defense played excellent," said Knesek. 
Sorin coach Fred Faber was very happy with the team's per­formance, considering the long layoff they experienced. 
"With an extra week to pre· pare, I think our team got a little lazy. We just wanted to get the first game out of the way and go from there." 
While Sorin looks well on its way to defending its Gold League Championship, St. Ed's is left to ask themselves how they can earn their first victory in recent memory. Utilizing the defensive abilities of cornerback Chris Kitalong could be a start. Early in the second half, Kitalong returned a Belden interception for a touchdown to cut St. Ed's deficit to 14-7. But the team could never capitalize on that momentum. 
Knott 20, Carroll 14 
With defensive dominance, the Juggs of Knott defeated the Vermin of Carroll on Sunday. 
The Juggs did not waste time scoring. In the lirst five minute'> of the game. Brian Pawloski sc(}red a touchdown putting Knott up 7-0. 
Throughout the gamP, Knott's fierct> defensive line helped hold the Vermin. The Knott defensP.
