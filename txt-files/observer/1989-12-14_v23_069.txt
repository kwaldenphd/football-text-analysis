The Hall Pn~sidents' Council attempted to veto a proposed constitutional amendment Tuesday. 
After two votes, however, the amendment to eliminate the of­fice of the Ombudsman in Stu­dent Government was finally passed due to several absten­tions. said HPC Co-Chairperson Diane Toohey. 
The presidents were not op­posed to the amendment per se, said Mark Bettencourt. an i-IPC member. They were concerned with. "the growing trend that IIPC as an organization was not being afforded what we thought proper recognition in Student Government," he said. 
"This was an effort to re­assert the role of IIPC in Stu­dent Government," according to Bettencourt. 
Toohey said that some hall presidents were concerned that members of Senate assumed that the amendment would be passed automatically. This

supports the even larger con­cern that liPC members feel they are not taken seriously by Student Government, she said. The amendment had unani­mously been passed by the Stu­dent Senate the previous night. 
The presidents used the amendment to make a state­ment, according to Bettencourt. By attempting to veto the amendment, the presidents showed they were tired of being "perceived as virtually a rubber stamp" of Student Government, he said. 
Bettencourt said he suggested to the presidents to vote "no" or "in absentia" to make their concerns known. "The only way to do so was to take a vote and let it show in numbers," he said. 
In the first vote, 14 opposed the amendment. while six were in favor, and six abstained. 
While motioning for a re­vote, Bettencourt said he en­couraged voting "in absentia," so that although their concerns would be heard, the amendment itself could pass. 
The presidents weren't really voting against the amendment, Toohey said, but against the principle behind it. 
A second vote was taken after 
Co-Chairpersons Megan Hanley 
and Toohey instructed members 
to vote on the issue of the 
amendment, not of power. The 
second vote recorded 15 in fa­
vor, four opposed, and seven 
abstaining.

de Klerk negotiates with Mandela 
Right-wing party denounces meeting as capitulation 
JOIIANNESBUHG, South Africa (AP)-Black leader Nel­son Mandela, expected to be re­leased within weeks after 27 years in jail, visited President 
F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday to discuss prospects for negotiat­ing an end to South Africa's ra­cial conflict. 
The main far-right party de­nounced the meeting, the first ever between Mandela and de Klerk, as a step toward white capitulation. 
Liberal leaders, however, hailed the event as evidence the government accepts the central role of Mandela's outlawed guerrilla movement, the African National Congress, in any polit­ical settlement. 
The Justice Ministry said Mandela requested the meeting at Tuynhuis, the presidential office in Cape Town, and that de Klerk "welcomed the oppor­tunity." 
Mandela, the country's best­known black leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plot­ting an anti-government sabo­tage campaign. 
The meeting was Mandela's second with a South African president this year. He met with 
P.W. Botha on July 5, also at Tuynhuis. 
Since replacing Botha on Aug. 15, de Klerk has made several conciliatory moves toward the black majority in an effort to ease racial tensions. 
He has loosened restrictions on anti-government protests, met with prominent opposition leaders, ordered desgregation of whites-only beaches, traveled to several black-ruled African states, and proposed the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which permits the segregation of many public facilities. 
On Oct. 15, de Klerk ordered the unconditional release of seven of Mandela's ANC col­leagues. The lack of violence related to their release is seen as a factor that makes Man­deJa's freedom likely. 
The two discussed "ways and

NO computing to improve in 90s 
By SANDRA WIEGAND 
News Writer 
Computing at Notre Dame in the 90s will have the capacity to improve communication on campus, according to Donald Spicer, assistant provost for University Computing. 
Academic buildings in the early 90s will be connected by computers in much the same way they are presently con­nected by telephone services, he said. By the mid 90s the net­work will be extended to resi­dence halls. 
An example on a low level, he said, will be access to the li­brary catalog from any com­puter in the network. lligh quality reference books such as encyclopedias will be accessible to students from their dorms. 
Many of the library's materi­als, Spicer said, are already in "machine-readable" form, and need only to be applied to the computers. 
The computers will lead to a more efficient running of the University, said Spicer. He used the DAHT system for class reg­istration as an example. 


"Many people have mixed feelings about DAHT," he said, "but the problems were not with how the system itself func­tioned, but in how people used it. .. 
Another example Spicer gave was access to common infor­mation such as events calen­dars, "to avoid standing in lines." 
Integration of computers into the curriculum, Spicer said, will also be prominent, "not to re­place anything traditional, but to augment it." 
An alignment between com­puter services and services such as educational media will take place, he said. in an effort to merge technologies. 
Hegarding computer clusters such as the present ones in LaFortune Student Center and 
The Hesburgh Library, Spicer said installation will continue in the 90s, but that he foresees an increase in private ownership of personal computers by stu­dents. 
The goal is to install one public access microcomputer for every twenty undergraduate students, he said. This should be accomplished in about two years, at which point Notre Dame will be viewed as a "computer intensive campus." 
University Computing will not try to provide the number of computer facilities which could be utilized at times when com­puter use is its highest, but a sufficient number of computers which are up to technological c;tandards will be accessible, 
1icer said.

Phony cheer at Christmas? Get real 
'Twas the night be­fore finals And all through the Florentine Domn 

Hoelker
Not an administra­tor was stirring Asst. News Editor Not even those boneheads Who created the DAHT system ... 
Around Chistmas­time most people get mushy, act nice and make an efTort to spread some Christmas cheer. 
I have no objection to this, because of course I do it too. 
But if you think about it, the whole thing is a farce. 
Ah yes. I can hear the catcalls now. "Scrooge! You Grinch! What's wrong with Christmas, you jerk?" 
There's nothing wrong with Christmas. It's what's wrong with us. 
I have a hard time believing the sincerity of a person who, one minute, will shake my hand, smile, wish me a Merry Christmas and talk of peace and goodwill towards men, but the next would just as readily discuss the merits of not "burdening a woman with an unwanted pregnancy." 
That's the Christmas spirit -good will towards men and an aborted baby in every stocking, hung by the fireplace with care. 
There's something wrong with a society that kicks Salvation Army Santa Clauses out of shopping malls onto the street because they are "unattractive" or seem "low-class." 
There's no need for us to worry about those in need -we can sit back in our com­fortable middle-class or upperclass homes (depending on your parents' tax bracket) and exchange expensive and useless gifts. 
Unless we feel guilty, in which case we might go out of our way once a year to approach a begging Santa Claus and drop a few quarters in the pot by his feet. 
It's as if we hope a few weeks of goodwill 
can make us feel better, because we know 
we've been selfish the rest of the year, 
worrying about matching socks with our 
sweater, getting Nike Air Jordans from our 
mommies and daddies when next we go 
home, and whether we have enough beer or 
party invitations for the weekend to get 
trashed. Oh, and lest I forget-
Merry Christmas.

The BBC will teach Polish broadcasters Western radio and television techniques as part of Britain's $80 million aid package. it was announced in London Wednesday.

Thirty-six broadcast­ers, chosen by Polish Hadio and Television, will begin six-week training programs starting in February, Tusa said.

News Writer 
A warning from the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Finan­eial Aid Offices states that they have become aware of an orga­nization entitled Academic Council on Financial Assistance allegedly based in Washington, 
D.C. which proposes to secure at least $300 in scholarship aid for students who submit $50 for their search service. Stu­dents are advised not to con­tact this organization. 
When looking for financial aid information from services that provide it . .Joe Husso. di­rnctor of financial aid, recom­mends students use caution and follow these guidelines:

the organization and ask some hard questions such as: who is on the board of direetors; where the office is located; and how they obtained your name and address.

If 
you are not given satisfac­tory answers or if you are sus­pieious in any way that the or­ganization might be a fraud you should contact the Finan­cial Aid Offices at either Notre Dame or Saint Mary's to see if they have any information on the legitimacy of the organiza­tion.

Much of the information ob­tained from scholarship ser­vices can be found at a library or from a high school guidance counselor free of charge. Stu­dents are strongly advised not to send money to any organiza­tion until they have checked it out thoroughly.

Trident 2 test launch is successful Wed. 
CAPE CANAVEHAL, Fla. (AP) -The crew of the nuclear submarine Tennessee suecnss­fully launched a Trident 2 mis­sile Wednesday after tlw Navy warned Greenpeaee anti-nu­clear protnstPrs to stay out of the safety zo1w, tho Navy said. 
The launch was the second straight sueressful undersea test-firing of the Navy's new1~st and deadliest nuclPar weapon, keeping it on track for opera­ti!mal deployment next Marel1. Two of the first three subma­rine tests failed explosively. 
The Tennessee was cruising submerged in the Atlantic about 50 miles offshore wh1~n the 44-foot, $26.5 million mis­sile burst out of a launch tube, broke the surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosed ocean target several thousand miles away. 
The Navy reported several minutes after the 9:15 a.m. launch that the test was suc­eessful. 
A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, 
the Mondeivitano, briefly pene­
trated the launch safety zone 
but withdrew after a Navy ship 
warned it to move away. The 
safety area is a 5,000-foot ra­
dius around the submarine. 
"They observed the range 
safety warning," said Lt. Cmdr. 
Bill Sonntag, a Navy spokesman. 
"W1~ made our point that we have a right to protnst in inter­national watPrs," said (;rPPn­pean~ spoknswonHLn Shannon Fagan. "We will now take our light to Congnss in an pf"f'ort to have this missile syst1~m canceled. The world can no longer afford the wastn of pre­cious wsourc.es on weapons of mass destruction like tlw Tri­d!mt 2." 
Grm~npeaee protnsters triPd to halt a Tridt~nt 2 launch Dec. 4 by sending the 11JO-foot vessel MV Greenpeacn, with 25 aboard, into the Tennessee's safety zone. 
A Navy ship intereepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the smokestacks, stop­ping the engines. Navy sailors in swift boats corraled two Greenpeace high-speed rafts that tried to approach the Ten­nessee, cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety zone. 
Greenpeace had halted a Tri­dent 2 test with the same tac­tics in .July.

BOSTON IAPJ -The word on the street is that Georgette Watson's head is worth $5,000. If she's shot and doesn't die, it's $1 ,000. 
That's how badly street gangs want to get rid of the founder of Drop-A-Dime, a hot linn that fields tips on drug pushers. Watson is under 24­hour police surveillance and says she can accept that -for now. But she won't live in a fishbowl forever. 
"I want to be free," she said Wednesday. "They feel they can kill anyone who goes against their stance. This is a fight not community. If we take a stand now we won't have to pay later." 

Deputy Superintendent William Celester said police in­formants had received "solid tips" this week that local gang members had set a price on Watson's life. 
"Georgette Watson has ... been getting various threats ever since she began to speak out about the drug dealers and everything else," he said. "From time to time, we've of­fered her police protection and she's always turned those of­fers down. This time we're in­
The idea of gang bounties is not particularly new. Tensions ran high this fall when similar threats were made on police of­ficers patrolling this city's Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury neighborhoods. 
"Georgette has become a symbol of the little person standing up," Celester said. "She's been out there standing up for the community and fighting back. She's become a symbol that these gangs want to stop." 
The 46-year-old knows she's in danger but prefers not to

MOSCOW (AP) -The gov­prnment announced its eco­nomic recovery plan Wednes­day, promising live more years of bureaucratic control of such mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced for eaeh Soviet consumer. 
Premier Nikolai Hyzhkov re­jectP.d radical reforms like tlw legalization of private property and the selling off of money­losing state enterprises, draw­ing immediate scorn from dis­appoint(~d progressives in the Soviet Parliament. 
If bumaucrats really want to raise annual egg production ­targeted at 285 per person by 1995 -they should raise chickens. economist and par­liamentarian Gavriil Popov told Parliament. known as the Congress of People's Deputies. 
"Five years ago, we said it was a choke between live-year plans and pernstroika, and un­fortunately, it turns out the five-year plan has won," said fellow deputy Pavel Bunich, in tho lobby outside the snow-oJV­ered Kremlin's Palaee of Con­gresses. 
The government proposal shifts the emphasis of tradi­ticmal central planning away from heavy industry to con­sumer goods and services. They are to quadruple in the next live-year plan, from 1991-1996. It also would transfer some control from bureaucrats in Moscow to those in the re­publics. 
Brazilian campaign turns nasty 
Soviet gov. unveils economic plan 
said the plan was so bad he hoped tlw Congress would throw it back at the govmn­mPnt for a complete rewrite. Moreover. he suggested thn ministers responsible be re­placPd. 
Tlw governnwnt's moves to­ward a market economy are vagtw and fragmnntPd, doom­ing tlwm from the start. said Popov, one of 300 deputies who signed up to comnwnt. 
"You can't assemble it grad­ually,'' he said. "You can't have tlw carburetor working while the starter is idle. If the motor is working, it must be working eomplntPiy." 
"Enterprises are drowning, not because tlwy don't know how to swim, hut because the center has tied tlwir hands." he said. 
Hyzhkov's program was a l'IPar vidory for tlw conserva­tives, who dominate tlw Par­liamPnt. Hyzhkov ewn rejertml the program of his own top economist.

lAMERICAN 
BHASILIA, Brazil (AI') -The presidential race has taken a turn for tlw nasty with a cam­paign spot in which a candi­datl~ 's ex-girlfriPnd charges he offnred lwr money to get an · abortion wlwn she was preg­nant with tlwir daughter. 
"lie ruined my life," said Miriam Cordl'iro, referring to socialist candidate Luis lnaeio I.ula da Silva, in an ad broad­east on Ttwsday and Wednes­day. 
In addition to talking about tlwir relationship and the cou­ple's illegitimate 15-year-old daughter, Ms. Cordeiro also said da Silva, known as l.ula, was a racist and "couldn't stand blacks." A majority of Brazil's 150 million people are black or mixed-race. 
The ad was mad!' by l.ula's opporwnt. FPrnando Collor de Mello of tlw conservative Na­tional Heconstruction Party. Ms. Cordeiro says in the spot that her testimony was volun­tary, but a former campaign workl'r for Collor de Mello claims the w·oman was paid about $23,000 for her partici­pation. 
"I couldn't remain silent fac­ing a cas!~ of corruption," said the worker, Maria !!elena Ama­ral. adding slw had quit Collor de Mello's campaign staff after the interview. 

The Brazilian press has roundly condemned Collor de Mello's tactics. 
"The eampaign rnachns the bottom," the respected daily newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said Wednesday. 
Lula's campaign coordinator. Vladimir Pomar, called the in­Cordeiro following the death of his first wife in 1969. The press earlier this year "discovered" Lurian, but Brazilians did not react strongly to the disclosure. 
terview "baixaria"  - "a low  
blow."  
Tlw  candidate  says  his  
daughter,  Lurian,  was  born  
after  an  affair  with  Ms  

"Jie offered me money to get an abortion," Ms. Cordniro said in the spot. "WhPn she was born, I put hnr in his lap and said 'Now go ahead and kill hPr, because when she was in my belly I wouldn't let you."' 
Lula, in his own TV spot Wednnsday, was shown stand­ing bnside Lurian.

Bayh to investigate lottery resignation 
INDIANAPOLIS (APl -Gov. Evan Bayh said Wednesday he will discuss Lottery Director Jack F. Crawford's resignation in detail if Crawford or others involvnd publicly disclose what led to Crawford's unexpected departure. 
Meanwhile, the lottery em­ployee who was under Statn Police protection before and after Crawford's resignation spoke publicly for the first time since Crawford quit, saying she is "a victim of a very serious matter." 
Bayh, criticized by Rnpubli­cans and in editorial pages of newspapers for his handling of the Crawford incidnnt, said he was only trying to protect the privacy of the people involved when he declined to elaborate on why Crawford quit. 
"I think it would be appro­priate, if they sec fit, for the in­dividuals involved to make known their side of the story," Bayh told reporters Wednesday morning outside his Statehouse office. "Once the individuals have come forward to make a statement about this matter, I would be delighted to answer any and all questions about this entire affair." 
Published and broadcast re­
ports have said Crawford's 
resignation Sunday came after 
allegations about his relation­
ship with Cartwright, the lot­
tery's director of human re­
sources and a longtime Craw­
ford aide. 
Cartwright, interviewed 
briefly on Indianapolis televi­

sian station WRTV, said, "Well, 
this is not a very pleasant sit­
uation. I am a victim of a very, 
very serious matter." 

Asked if she was the victim of 
a crime, she said, "A very seri­
ous matter. I did not say crime. 
I feel that I'm a victim of a very 
serious matter and at this point 
I don't want to make a com­
ment. There might be a news 
conference next week. I don't 
know at this point." 

She said she would make no 
comment on whether she was 
threatened. She also said she 
believed her telephone had been 
tapped but did not say who she 
thought did that. 

Bayh administration officials said Cartwright was scared when she requested and re­ceived State Police protection at her Indianapolis apartment Saturday. 
That protection ended at mid­afternoon Wednesday. officials said. 
"She said she no longer re­quired it," said Bayh press sec­retary Fred Nation. 

Crawford has said he was surprised by the request for protection. 
"I have never threatened or hurt anybody physically in my life," Crawford, a former pros­ecutor, told the Gary Post-Tri­bune. ''I've seen enough of vio­lence to just hate it." 
Crawford wouldn't comment on any matters related to Cartwright.

The far-right Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the white vote in September's parliamentary elections, said the meeting represented a de facto legalization of the ANC. 
The Conservative leader, An­dries Treurnicht, condemned de Klerk for meeting the leader of "a banned terrorist organiza­tion" and said the president underestimated whites' desire to retain full political sovereignty. 
The anti-apartheid Demo­cratic Party welcomed the 
meeting and said de Klerk should take the further step of agreeing to talks with the ANC's exiled leadership. 
There was no immediate re­action from the ANC to Wednesday's meeting. Tom Se­bina, a spokesman at head­quarters in Lusaka, Zambia, said he might have a statement Thursday after consulting with his superiors. 
In Washington, State De­partment spokesman Richard Boucher said, "We applaud the meeting" between Mandela and de Klerk.

The amendment passed on the second vot11 because voting procedures stale that absten­tions are not counted. There­fore. the 15 in favor. out of a total of 19 voting "yes" or "no," exceeded the required two­thirds. 
"I can't understand why the prnsidents were upset," Toohey said. "I understand that they want to bn taken seriously, but first thern are some internal things to be done before we can be taken seriously." 
Breslin said he is "in favor of IIPC taking an active role in trying to gain more credibility." However, he said, "the way they went about it was wrong." 
Tlw way in which IIPC can be­come more involved in Student Government involves clarifying their role in general, and in amendment procedures, ac­l:ording to Breslin. Such clarifi­cation would improve what is already a good working rela­tionship between the two groups. hP said. 
According to Bettnncourt, "In

the future, we (HPC) would like to be involved in all aspects of Student Government." 
The amendment was pre­sented to IIPC by Judicial Board Coordinator Vinnie Sanchez at the Dec. 5 meeting. Members of I!PC then had a week to voice CIJflcerns or opposition before the Senate meeting. According to Breslin, no concerns were brought to him or Sanchez. 
At Monday's Senate meeting, four members of IIPC wern pre­sent for the unanimous vote. To pass an amendment to the un­dergraduate constitution. both the Senate and JIPC must ap­prowJ.

"One of the most important things about working with Stu­dent Government is working with them, not against them," Toohey said. 
Breslin said that HPC mem­bers were apparently concerned that eliminating the office of the Ombudsmen would place more power in the hands of the Judicial Coordinator. 
According to the amendment, the primary duty of the Om­budsmen, running elections. would fall under the Judicial Board, but would be assumed by the Ombudsmen Election Committee and not the coordi­nator.

Japanese business gift-giving, ends in bribery trial for Nippon 
TOKYO (AP) -The former chairman of Japan's largest company told a court Wednesday he was engaging in a normal Japanese busi­ness deal, not being bribed, when he accepted discount-priced stocks from a firm accused of buying favors. 
The trial of Hisashi Shinto, 79, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., which began Wednesday in Tokyo District Court, is the fourth of five scheduled trials in the Recruit bribery scandal. 
Defendants in the fifth trial, to begin Friday, are Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and· former chairman of the Recruit Co. information services conglomerate, and two politicians accused of accepting bribes. A total of 12 defendants are charged with bribery and could face five years in prison each if convicted. 
Ezoe's company allegedly tried to win favors and influencejn the top ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy. The Recruit scandal and trials have raised many questions about political gift-giving, business practices and the close ties between government and business in Japan. 
Parliament gave final approval Wednesday to legis­lation providing punishment for politicians who make donations at weddings, funerals and other events in their election districts without attending the event. 
Politicials  have  said  
constituents  expect  such  
donations.  

Under the new law, which· takes effect Feb. 1, violators can be sentenced to a year in prison or fined up to 200,000 yen ($1 ,390). 
Shinto, who testified before Judge Ken Toyoda in the no-jury trial, accepted the prosecution's factual allegations that he made about 21 million yen ($145,000) in 1986 by buying shares in a Recruit subsidiary at a below-market price before they were offered to the public. 
"I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a bribe," Shinto said. He added that, during his business c.areer, other companies had offered him similar shares as a sign of trust and longterm ties. 
"Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in Japan," he said. 
Shinto denied doing special favors for Recruit. The prosecution alleged that Recruit got favorable terms 
on  telephone  lines,  
maintenance  and  other  
services.  


Retailers' sales rise, Christmas comes early 


WASHINGTON (AP) -U.S. retailers' sales rebounded in November, the government said Wednesday in a report analysts saw as showing stronger-than­expected Christmas buying and less chance of a recession. 
The 0.8 percent increase, the biggest in four months, "clearly signals that the economy is resilient," said Richard Hahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Fears of a poor Christmas retail season should abate with this report." 

"It's clearly stronger than was expected," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey L. Lanston & Co., a New York government securities dealer. "As long as spending holds up, there's no threat of a recession." 
The Commerce Department said that sales rose to a sea­sonally adjusted $144.6 billion in November after plummeting 
1.3 percent in October, when they were driven down by skidding automobile sales. The October sales were revised after

originally being reported to 
have fallen 1 percent. 
Many economists were ex­pecting only a weak improve­ment in November since unit car sales fell again in Novem­ber. 
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington, said the 0.5 per­cent increase in the automotive category probably reflected an increase in pric.es, not sales. Excluding the auto category, the report was even more positive, showing a 0. 9 percent advance. 
Jones suggested a shift in Christmas-present buying patterns might have con­tributed to the November strength and might mean more moderate growth this month. 
"We're getting more and more spending in the last week of November and less in the first weeks of December," he said. "The way to measure the Christmas season now is to average the November and December spending patterns." 
And Shaber added, "It's taken a lot of price-slashing to get those sales. So even if dollar sales are decent this Christmas, it's unclear whether the profits will be so great." 
Hetail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic aetivity, and David Wyss, senior financial economist for DRIMcGraw-llill in Lexington. Mass., said the stronger l\ovember report caused him to boost his esti­mate of overall growth. 
Wyss said if strong sales continue in December, the gross national product could increase at a 1 percent rate in the final quarter of the year instead of the 0.5 percent he had been predicting. 
"This relieves the worries that the fourth quarter could turn into a negative quarter," he said. 
There had been concern that Christmas spending would be held back by a slowing econ­omy, reflecting Federal Reserve policy of holding down inflation by tightening credit.

Final exams only test one's cramming skills 

The symptoms are surfacing rapidly: "War and Peace" can be read in its entirety while waiting for a computer at any of the labs, and the rush is on for those coveted library car­rels. All the evidence points out that final exams are quickly approaching. 
This is the time of year that students start figuring out ex­actly how many hours they will need to learn an entire semester of caleulus by them­selves. I can say from experi­nnce that it is definitely more than 12. Students are buying "Cliff Notes" like they am going out of styli~ (that would be a sad day). Now is the time to own stock in a caffeine com­pany. All this frenzy for one do-or-die test in each dass. It s1~ems a little ridiculous. 
The point is. finals no longer fill the purpose for which they 

Colleen Cronin Asst. Accent Editor 
were originated. They do not measure how much a student has learned, but how much in­formation he can cram into his brain the night before. It is practically guaranteed he will forget that information as soon as the test is completed. So much information is asked for in these finals that even those who diligently keep up through the semester are known to be studying until 3 a.m. 
Does a student really learn th1~ class material by having only two tests-a midterm and a final-during the semester? Not much room or time is al­lowed for improvement if per­chance the midterm is not an acceptable grade. There must be a more logical and accurate method of measuring a stu­dent's knowledge of material. Several suggestions come to mind: 
What about not giving the class a final exam? 
Literature classes could have a paper instead, incorporating the books covered. Cramming has no place here-no need to memorize the order of 20th century American authors. Ei­ther the student knows the ma­terial or he does not. 
What about giving more tests throughout the semester? 
This would be ideal for classes where papers are not appropriate. The student would have more opportunities to show his learning progess and correct ·his errors. The student could then be graded on his progress and improve­ment during the course of the semester. In classes where the subject matter builds upon it­self. such as calculus, this method would be more sensibh~. 
What about a final that only helps the student? 
Teachers could use the grade only in borderline cases, or cases where the student finally grasped the material late in the semester. Those students who are familiar with the material and have proved it on earlier tests need not take the final­the proof of knowledge is al­ready there. Let those who need another grade take the fi­nal. 
Any one of these options would not lead the student to study less. Instead it would give him an incentive to study regularly throughout the entire semester, as he would be re­warded with an exemption from a final. lie would also know that he would not have a final as his last hope, his swan song, his escape from a semester of not going to class. There would be no caffeine­and sugar-induced all-nighters. and students would retain the information for a greater pe­riod of time. 
Teachers would also benefit. If a teacher taught the dass well, the students would learn and do well on the tests (or pa­pers). There would be no finals for the teacher to grade, and he would also know that his stu­dents learned throughout the semester, as they should, and not just in one night.

Day of Reflection helps answer life's questions 
By Cindy Petrites 
I have been trying to reflect for about a month now on what I gained from the Day of Re­flection and Prayer held by Fatlwr llnnri Nouwen at the Center for Social Concerns. 
At first I think what stopped me was the faet that I wanted to write something so good and so touehing that everyone who rnad my artiel!~ would say, "Wow!" and then scurry over to tlw CSC to do a Summer Serviee Projeet, or lwlp the homeless, or visit 1.'/\rehe. I wanted to write something inspirational that would motivate people to serve, to want to serve, to rec­ognize the value of service. The problem is, I can't do that. 
First of all, even if I eould, eonvincing people that service is a valuable thing isn't really what's needed. Most people, particularly people on this campus, reeognize the value the service. 
The majority knows, or at least has heard, that service can be a beautiful, enriching, opening experience through whieh you ean touch others and be touehed. Most people realize that service can benefit the "server" just as much as the one being served, and that ser­vice is one way of getting in touch with other people, God and yourself. But. to tell the truth, that's not what I gained from the Day of Reflection and Prayer. 

Silence and the opportunity to reflect and pray were what I received that day. It offered me a chance to get involved in ser­vice if I wanted to, but more than that, the chance to stop and say, "Hey! What am I doing with my life? What kind of per­son am I? What are my priori­ties? Where am I going?" 
Those are tough questions, and the answers are different for everyone. ThP same is true for serviee. Though a spirit of love is the common motivation

Santa lives through love for children 
Dear Editor: 
Hecently, I received a rather distressing call from a friend of mine at Notre Dame. Appar­ently, an artiele appeared in The Observer in which the au­thor made a bold assertion that Santa Claus did not exist. 
I. for one, disagree, at least in part. 
I really do exist. I exist in spirit and not in an individual body. However, this does not make my existence any less real. 
"Santa Claus" has taken many forms over the years. The most famous "santas" of all were the three Wise Men. It was their faith that led them to 

a small stable in Bethlehem It is not really important where they brought presents to whether I exist in my legendary The Child on the first form or not.

ground for all service, there are as many different ways to serve as there are people. Sure, the opportunities to serve are there-the homeless, sick, lonely, poor, uneducated, hand­icapped, the roommate, the friend-but it takes a personal 'yes' in order to turn that op­portunity into reality. 
Sometimes in our hectie lives what we need isn't another per­son telling us what to do or what we should be doing or how good it would be to do this or that, but the time to think

ourselves.  
Service  is only  an  outward  

manifestation of love that al­
ready exists on the inside. It cannot be forced or coerced or coddled out of someone. To serve is a very personal deci­sion, and one that, like all seri­ous decisions. merits reflection and prayer. Then, and only then, can you serve, beeause you discover that service does not come from the need and suffering which lie outside, but from the love and desire to share that love whieh lies within.

NO swimmers will train in Florida during winter holidays 

By JANICE ARCHER Sports Writer 
Getting a chance to enjoy some warm weather over Christmas vacation, the Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams will travel to Florida and continue their training. 
On a 10-day trip beginning Jan. 2, the swimmers will un­dergo a period of training that will be "as intense as possible," according to head coach Tim Welsh. 
The trip allows them, for the only time during the year, to train without the added pres­sures of classes, tests, and homework., team members said. 

"It's an important opportu­nity for the team to pull to­gether as one unit," said cap­tain Tom Penn. 
Approximately four hours a day will be spent swimming, and one to two hours a day lifting, if weights are available. The first part of the three leg trip will be at the Justus Aquatic Center in Orlando, and the second leg will take place in Boca Raton at the Mission Bay Aquatic Center. 
"The intense training camp atmosphere and compact living conditions make the team very unified," notes Welsh. "Over the years, the trip has had a ex­tremely positive effect. When we return, the whole is always more than the sum of its parts." 
Trips in the past have taken the Irish to Long Beach, Calif., and Phoenix, Ariz. 
The third part of the swim­mers' trip takes them back in the Midwest to Northwestern University, for a meet against Creighton on Jan. 12, then to road meet with Ball State the following day. 
The teams will return to campus when the dorms open on Jan. 14, beginning a de­manding series of meets for the new semester. 
The women's team is coming off a recent impressive 199-93 victory over Saint Mary's. The 
NC State hoops has cloudy history 
HALEIGII, N.C. {AP) -A cloud has hung over North Carolina State's basketball program through three eras, and the NCAA's latest action only added another dark postscript to Wolfpack history. 
Interspersed with two na­tional championships have been a series of sanctions dating back to 1954. Of the team's last four eoaehes. three have been sanctioned for violations. Everett Case received the stiffnst sanctions, five years, covering two decisions. 
But it isn't as bleak as it seems, according to associate athletic director Frank Weedon, a 30-year veteran administrator at North Carolina State. 
"I think there's a different reason for each coach," Weedon said in a telephone in­terview. "I don't think anything was done with intent to hurt anyone or anybody." 
Weedon said he's not sure it's all that bad, anyway. given the national championships in 197 4 and 1983. 
"If you knew then what you know now, maybe a lot of things might have gorw differ­ently," Weedon said. "I don't know that it's a cloud. Each thing was at a different time. We had the (basketball) gam­bling scandals in the early '60s. I think visibility has a lot to do with it." 
Norm Sloan. who had trouble at Florida before resigning this year, was called on the carpet in connection with his recruit­ment of All-American David Thompson at North Carolina State. The common thread among Case, Sloan and current eoaeh Jim Valvano is that all were forced to miss the NCAA tournament as penance. 
Valvano's program was hit with a two-ynar probation 


Jim Valvano 

Tuesday for rules violations. The NCAA ruled that over the past fiv~ years, players sold shoes and complimentary game tickets. There also were 630 cases of misuse of tickets des­ignated for family members, according to the NCAA. 
"Norm Sloan was visible. Case was visible. V (Valvano) is a very glib, outgoing person," Weedon said. "Maybe we draw a lot of attention to ourselves." 
On May 7. 1954, the NCAA placed N.C. State on a one-year probation for holding illegal tryouts of perspective players. Case allegedly took a first-hand look on campus at 11 players in May 1953. Among the players who were given transportation by the Wolfpack and illegally auditioned on campus were Hod Hundley, who later became an All-American at West Virginia, and Ronnie Shavlik, who be­came an All-American for the Wolf pack. 
Case's team won the first Atlantic Coast Conference bas­ketball tournament in 1954, but was banned from the NCAA tournament and the National Invitation Tournament. Instead, the Wolfpack went to the national AAU tournament in Denver, losing in the second round. 
More than two years later came the stiffest ban ever im­posed on N.C. State, and the most stringent in NCAA history before Southern Methodist's football program was dissolved in 1986. It might have been the precursor to the so-called "death penalty." 
Irish captured first-place victo­
ries in every event. 

"Several of the girls who didn't travel to New York per­formed very well in the meet," commented Welsh. "It was a spectacular effort by the whole team." 
The meet, which took place at the Rolfs Aquatic Center, came soon after the team returned from the National Catholic Championships in Fordham, N.Y. 
"We were worried about coming back after such a long trip," says Welsh. "But across the board we swam very well, and it was a great reunification meet." 
Not only was the win testi­mony to the strength of the team as a whole, but there were impressive individual perfor­mances as well. Tanya Williams and Becky Wood became the first two swimmers in Irish his­tory to qualify for the NCAA 
meet  which  will  be  held  in  
March.  
Williams swam  a  time  of  

4:22.3 in the 400-yard individ­ual medley, and Wood recorded a time of 2:19.16 in the 200 breaststroke. 
Now both the men's and women's team can look for­ward to their intense training trip in Florida that will help prepare them for the upcoming spring semester's schedule. 
HEY! Look who's 21 on the 24th! Too bad the bars are closed on Christmas Eve! 
If"\ Happy 21st KASSIE!!

Previewing Irish opponents 
By GREG GUFFEY Assistant Sports Editor 
After struggling with a 1-3 record so far this season, the Notre Dame men's baskt1tball team will end the year with four home gam11s and thtm bPgin 1990 with fivn road 
eontnsts. 
Thn Irish will host UCLA Sunday at I p.m. in the .Joyce ACC and then ent11rtain Valparaiso Thursday. Dec. 21; Lafayette Friday, One. 22; and Butler Saturday. Dm:. 30. 
Notre Dame will play at Creighton .Jan. 3, at Southern California .Jan. 6, at Boston College .Jan 9, at LaSalle Jan, 12 and at Jlutgers Jan. 16. 
Here's a capsule look at each team: 
Valparaiso -The Crusaders beat Notre Damn last season in Valpo by a 71-68 count in overtime. 
Valparaiso lost 69-62 to Ball Statn Thursday night to lower its record to 0-6. 
Junior Mike .Jonns. who scornd 19 points for the Crusades in last year's game. returns . .Jim Ford (13 
points in  last year's upset)  and  
Bruins  
continued from page 24  
As  a  team,  UCLA  has  not  

posted overly impressive statistics. The Bruins shoot just 
42.4 percent from the field and 
28.8 percent from beyond the three-point stripe. Opponents are outrebounding UCLA 38.3 to 36. 
Forwards Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean lead UCLA's of­fensive attack. Wilson. a 6-8 senior and pre-season West Coast nominee for the John Wooden Award. leads the team with 19.3 points per game and 
10.0 rebounds per contest. MacLean. a 6-10 sophomore, seores 18.0 points and pulls down 7.0 boards. 
Hounding out the Bruin lineup are 6-10 eenter Kevin Walker 
(4.3 ppg, 2.8 rpg, UCLA's ca­reer leader in three-point field goals aw~mpted and made) and guards Gerald Madkins (9.0 ppg) and Darrick Martin (7.3 ppg, 19 assists). Freshman Mitchell Butler contributes 5.0 points pN game ofT the bench. 
Notre Dame could start any one of I 0 players. Against Marquette last Saturday, Phelps started sophomores Elmer Bennett and Daimon Sweet, junior Tim Singleton and seniors Scott Paddock and Keith Hobinson. 
Co-captain Joe Fredrick came off the bench at Marquette to score a team-high 19 points, but fellow co-captain Jamere Jackson has struggled. Jackson has hit just 9-of-30 shots in the four games and averages 6.3 points per contest. Hobinson is still the team scoring leader at 
14.3 points per game, followed by Fredrick at 12.3.

With only four more victories needed to catch Ohio State legend Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach, Bo Schembechler plans to end his coaching duties at Michigan, effective after the Rose Bowl. Schembechler will remain Michigan's athletic director.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) ­Duke has Steve Spurrier. Florida wants him. Both of them are willing to wait for him to make up his mind. 
Florida wants Spurrier. a Heisman Trophy winner with the Gators in 1966, to come back as head coach. But he left a meeting in Gainesville Tuesday night without giving an answer. 
Spurrier, who played at Florida from 1964-66, has a 20-12-1 record in three seasons at Duke. The Atlantic Coast Conference co-champions are 8-3 this season and will play Texas Tech in the All-American Bowl on Dec. 28. 
"We have offered Coach Spurrier the job of head coach," Florida athletic direc­tor Bill Arnsparger said in a st11tmnent. "He has not ac-

on Monday when he told a university sociology class he would never sit in the coach's office of the new $12.5 million Center of Champions. The building, to be completed next fall, will house the football program. 
Heart attacks in 1970 and 1987 resulted in open-heart surgery, and Schembechler's physicians have urged him to slow down ever since. 
Apparently, the decision was made a little easier because No. 3 Michigan just won its second straight Big Ten title. 
A decision was also necessary because associate athletic di­rector Jack Weidenbach, who has been in charge of daily op­erations while Schembechler tended to football, is nearing retirement age. 
Schembechler said he decided to make the announcement now because he wanted prospective recruits to know Moeller would be their coach.

cepted. We will continue to work out the proposal... He has been, he is, our first choice. We are pleased he is considering our offer." 
Arnsparger was out of his of­fice Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. The Tampa Tribune reported that the contract, if accepted, prob­ably would cover five years. 
Spurrier, believed to be trav­eling from Gainesville to his home in Durham, N.C., also could not be reached for com­ment. Duke athletic director Tom Butters said by telephone from his office that he hadn't talked to Spurrier, but wasn't surprised that Florida had made an offer. 
Spurrier, who also has been interviewed by two NFL teams, reportedly may wait until after Duke's bowl appearance to de-

Southern Cal coach Larry Smith, who will be on the oppo­site sideline on New Year's Day in Pasadena, said he was sad­dened by the news. 
"It's a shock. All of a sudden, Bo is out of the game," he said. "Anyone who has coached with or played for Bo thought that he'd coach forever. College football is losing a great con­tributor." 
Schembechler leads all coaches in NCAA Division I-A with a record of 234-64-8 after 21 years at Michigan and six at Miami of Ohio. He is fifth on cide his future. Arnsparger's statement said "the time frame we are working with now is his time frame," and Butters indi­cated he won't try to rush Spurrier, either. 
"Steve understands the pro­cess and knows it couldn't be­gin for us until after he makes a decision," Butters said. "There will be no pressure on him to do anything in a hurry. 
"The important thing now is that he make the right deci­sion," he added. "He's a bright young coach and has a bright future. It's far more important that he the right decision rather than an expedient deci­sion." 
Regardless of what Spurrier decides, Butters expects him to coach the Blue Devils in the All American Bowl. 
the all-time list and needs only four more victories to match his mentor at Ohio State, Woody Hayes. Schembechler is the winningest coach in Michigan history at 194-47-5. 
Schembechler never had a losing season. Fifteen of his 21 Michigan teams have been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The 1985 team finished No. 2 after beating Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. 
The Wolverines began the 1989 season ranked No. 1, but lost their opening game to Notre Dame before getting 10 straight wins. 
"If you think that my career has been a failure because I have never won a national title, you have another think com­ing," Schembechler said before beating Ohio State in the final regular-season game. "I have never played a game for the na­tional title. Our goals always have been to win the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a successful season." 
This year's Rose Bowl will be Schembechler's 10th and third in the past four years. 
Schembechler transformed Michigan's program into one of the best in the nation and, aided by Canham's salesman­ship, began to regularly fill the university's 101,701-seat sta­dium. The Wolverines have played to 91 consecutive home crowds in excess of 100,000. 
Schembechler also became a spokesman for college football. urging tight academic stan­dards and higher graduation rates for players. 
"He's meant a great deal to all of intercollegiate football," Purdue coach Fred Akers said. "He'll be missed. I can't think of anyone who deserves more of a well-earned rest."

What a difference a year makes for Colorado QB Hagan 
By PETE BAUMGARTNER 
Campus Press. University of Colorado 
No oil!' has been as instru­nwntal during tlw Colorado Buffalcws' golden season of IYS<J than quartPrbark Darian !lagan. 
But his nwtPorir risP from a bark-up to 0111' of tlw most ex­plosiw players in the country has bl'l'n anything but prt~­dietabiP. 
As tlw spring of 1989 fell upon tlw Uniwrsity of Colorado campus. two things were cer­tain about thP upeoming Buff team. 
EveryonP considered this squad thP best in Coach Paul McCartney's night-year tenure, and Sal Aunesn would begin his second full season as the Buffs' starting quartnrbark. 
But after a tragic day during spring break. one certainty be­came quite uncertain. Aunese was diagnosed as having a rare form of stomach cancer. It was inoperable and had spread to his lungs and lymph nodes. He could live anywhere from a few months to a few years. 
Suddenly Hagan was forced to take the reigns of a very promising CU squad. 
This was the same Hagan who, as a freshman phenom from Los Angeles, entered the 198S season claiming he would break all of Oklahoma quarter­back Jamelle llolieway's records-only to have an incon­sistlmt year during which he failed to earn a letter and rushed for just 175 yards. He was a gPnuinely insignificant player in the Buffs' 8-4 season. and cPrtainly was a first-year disappointment after a glorious prep careN. 

Hagan was a three-sport star at Locke lligh School outside of Los Angeles, wlwre he was sought aftnr not only by col­leges to play football, but also was drafted by the Seattle Marinnrs as a shortstop. 
llis childhood was anything but Pasy. 
!lagan grew uo in Watts. known in the 1960s for its racP riots, and now for rampant gang artivity. Hagan's mother was unabiP to take care of him. and he was raised early on by his aunt and uncle. Hagan's fa­ther wasn't around much, and he hasn't seen him in several years. 
He survived gang harassment and the loss of a close friend­beaten to death in high school by a gang-to make the honor roll both in the classroom and on the gridiron. 
Hagan initially had wanted to attend Oklahoma, but Sooner coach Barry Switzer felt he would be a Proposition 48 ca­sualty. He decided on Colorado, and his lackluster freshman year ended on a particularly bad note.

"We do so many things be­cause of the nature of our of­fense and we put so much pres­sure on Tony Rice that I don't know of any other quarterback who could do the things that Tony has done." Not many people in general could go through the adversity Hice has encountered over the last four years. A resident of Woodruff, S.C., his decision to attend Notre Dame was met with severe opposition by South Carolinians, who were pressur­ing him to stay home for school. Low SAT scores made Rice a Proposition 48 victim,  igible for four years. In fact, a South Bend television reporter lost his job in the summer of 1988, after he incorrectly stated that poor grades would make Hice ineligible for the up­coming season. Hice indeed was eligible for the the season, and he led the Irish to their llrst national title since 1977. Along the way, he directed Notre Dame to victo­ries in showdowns with more heralded quarterbacks Steve Walsh, Major Harris and Rodney Peete.

Despite all of Hice's accom­plishments, some people still criticize him and label him as a one-dimensional quarterback. It's that kind of talk that raises the ire of Rice's teammates. "How can you criticize a true winner?" said Irish tailback Hicky Watters. "He'll find a way to win. People say he can't pass, so he'll run on them. When you say he can't run, he'll pass on you."

Irish women fall to Michigan State 
Spartans' switch to zone defense confuses Notre Dame 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
Plagued by injuries and ill­nesses, the Notre Dame women's basketball team had ils two-game winning streak snapped Thursday night by Michigan State in a 64-48 decision at the Joyce ACC. 
Notre Dame (4-2) started out on a hot streak, and led 6-0 with 16:17 remaining,until ju­nior forward Hoz Van Guilder put the Spartans on the board, converting a single free-throw attnmpt.

 
The Irish led by as much as nine midway through the first half, thanks to a swarming de­fense, a powerful inside game and consistent outside shooting against the Spartans' man-to­man dllfense. 
Michigan State (4-2) then switched its defensive forma­tion to a zone, frustrating the Irish outside game and negat­ing the Irish advantage inside.

"We shot well against their man-to-man, but when they went into their zone defense, they took away our outside shooting, and we were unable to move the ball inside," said Irish coach Muffet McGraw. "Their defense really played a great game." 
Notre Dame shot 50 percent (12-of-24 from two-point range, 0-of-2 on three-point­ers) from the field in the first half, paced by the 4-for-5 shooting of sophomore guard Comalita Haysbert. Junior guard Eileen Shea led the Spartan first-half scoring as­sault, netting 10 points (3-of-5 from the field, 2-of-3 on free throws). The Spartans shot 40 percent from the field, hitting 10-of-25 shots, and 2-of-3 three point-attempts. 
Michigan State opened the second half with a devastating bined with the Spartans' five­
point spurt at the end of the first half of play, put the Irish into a hole which they never 
managed to escape from. 

"We need more help from our bench," said McGraw. "Krissi Davis played with tremendous pain, and we need more bench support, which we didn't get tonight." 
Notre Dame was held to eight of thirty-six (22%) shooting from the field in the second half, as the Michigan State de­fense, led by junior forward Cherie Swarthout, stole the thunder from the Irish attack. The Spartans also bested the Irish on the boards, out-re­bounding the Irish 14-9 on the offensive end, and 27-20 on the defensive end. 
The victory by Michigan State avenged a 57-55 defeat at the hands of the Irish last season.

Stats don't mean much in figuring Rice's worth 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 

It's a scene that's become all too familiar in college football stadiums across the country this season. 
Notre Dame has recorded another victory, with Irish quarterback Tony Hice has compiled some respectable but not overly spectacular statis­tics. Then the losing coach steps into the interview room and claims Hice was the differ­ence in the game. 
"If there's one better than him in the country, I'm glad we're not playing him," said Michigan State coach George Perles. ''I'm glad I'll never see him again." 
That was after Hice threw two interceptions and fumbled in a 21-13 win over the Spartans. 
"If he's not a Heisman guy, I don't know who is," Pitt coach 
 Hagan feature I page 22 
Mike Gottfried said after a 45-7 loss to the Irish in whieh Hice was just 1-of-7 passing. 
Said Michigan coach Bo Schembechler, "lie's as dan­gerous a runner as we'll play against all year. or all the guys we'll play this year, he's the most difficult to handle." Thosn comments followed a 24-19 Notre Dame win over Michigan, where Hice had just 85 yards of total offense. 
Therein lies the mystery of Hice's rerognition as a college superstar. The senior quarter­back has completed less than half his passes, has a 9-2 ratio of interceptions to passing touchdowns and has rushed for less than 1,000 yards. 
But the Irish tri-captain has

No. 13 UCLA brings undefeated record into Joyce ACC 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 

The beginning had promise. The present has disarray. 
The promise could return Sunday when the Notre Dame men's basketball team hosts 13th-ranked UCLA at 4 p.m. in the Joyce ACC. 
 NO over break I page 18 
The Irish (1-3) will be trying to snap a three-game losing streak when they face the Bruins. Notre Dame's slide is two weeks old and includes losses to Louisville, Indiana and Marquette. 
"It's a matter of getting some home cooking," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said. "As we get ready to play UCLA, it's very good to be playing at home. This has been one of the 

Digger Phelps 

traditional rivalries in college basketball." 
This will be the first of four consecutive home games for Notre Dame before the new year. The Irish will play Valparaiso, Lafayette and Butler before a six-game road trip to begin 1990. But a vic­tory over UCLA would give a slumping Notre Dame team a big dose of confidence. 
"I think everybody is disap­pointed -the students, the fans, the coaches and the players," Phelps said. "When they come in here, our students know it's UCLA, no matter what we've been through. I think the sixth man could be a factor. We need what we've been seeing on the road. We need them (crowd) to go after it for 40 minutes." 
Notre Dame has won four of the last five meetings, but this could be one of the most tal­ented UCLA teams in years. The Bruins have streaked to a 4-0 record with wins over Santa Clara, Washington, Washington State and San Diego. If they de­feat the Irish, it would mark the first time since the 1982-83 
season  that the  Bruins  have  
opened  with  five consecutive  
wins.

ANN ARBOH, Mich. (AP) ­Though Bo Schembechler says he's in good shape, age and wisdom have taught him not to push his luck. 
And so, after his Michigan team plays Southern California in the Hose Bowl. college football's winningest aetive coach will turn the Wolverine program over to his assistant, Gary Moeller. 
"I want it understood that I am in good shape physically," Schembechler said. "The primary reason for me stepping down at this time is that I don't want to run my luck too far. I've been fortunate to coach for 20 years following a heart attack. I just think at 60 years of age, it's time for me to step down." 
Schembechler, who leaves coaching without ever having 

won a national 
championship, will remain as 
athletic director -a post 
added to his title in 1988 
when Don Canham retired. 
He said he was uncertain how long he would stay on as athletic director. He also said he was concerned his name and presence might overshadow his successor. 
''I'm not sure that it's in the best interest of Michigan or the program or myself or Gary Moeller for me to be hanging around. It might be pretty difficult for me to sit in the athletic director's chair. I'd want to go to practice, and I don't think I should do that," Schembechler said. 
Schembechler hinted he was stepping down on
