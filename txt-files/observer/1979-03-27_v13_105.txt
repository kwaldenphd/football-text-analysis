Actress Helen Hayes receives Notre Dame's Laetare Medal 
Helen Hayes has been 
awarded the University of Notre 
Dame's Laetare Medal, the 
oldest of honors accorded 
American Catholics. 
The 78-year-old · actress, 
whose performances have de­lighted audiences since her professional debut in 1905 as Prince Charles in "The Royal F ami! y, " is the third actress apd twenty-second woman to receive the medal, first given to distinguished Catholics m 1893. , Margaret Anglin received the medal in 1927 and Irene Dunne 
in 1949. , 
"Both on and off the stage, 
Helen Hayes has given us an 
insight into the human condi­
tion rare in its range and in its 
depth,'' commented Fr. 
Theodore Hesburgh, president 
of the University. 
Millions of Americans hav;e been entertained by Miss Hayes in memorable per­formances that include Maggie Wylie in "What Every Woman Knows," Mary Stuart in "Mary of Scotland," and, in what is regarded as her most brilliant portrayal, Queen Victoria in ''Victoria Regina.'' In what was to become a familiar suc­cess story for the actress, the 1935 production of "Victoria Regina" ran 123 weeks on Broadway before touring 43 
U.S. cities, where it broke box office records before closing in January, 1939, after 969 per­formances by its lead. Other

Egyptians express mixed feelings 
Ptofessot Hans J.

towards peace treatywith Israel 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP)t.>· Uncer­tain, apprehensive." joyful, millions of Egyptians yesterdar watched their televisions, tunea in their radios or simply listen­ed for the pealing of bdls announcing the birth of peace for their la:nd. 
Not all welcomed the treaty with Israel. Officials said public gatherings were discour­aged last night out of concern that treaty opponents, calling it a betrayal of the Palestinians and other Arab states, would try to disruot them. 
The ruli~g l'lational Demo­cratic Party of President Anwar Sadat planned rallies through­out Egypt for later in the week. 
Last mght's organized events 
were simple,. the lighting of 
mosques and ringing of church 
bells at the momenr of the 
treaty signing in Washington, 9 
r,.m. here; the r,resentation of a 
'flag of peace ' to the captain of the Norwegian c.ruise ship Sagafjord as it carried 400 Amencan passengers through the Suez Canal; the piping of ship whistles along the canal. 
Many Egyptians had mixed feelings about the post-treaty period. They were relieved that the stateof war was ending, but continued to have doubts about how much the Israelis can be trusted. 
"On the first day of peace, I shall be happy like every one else, like a man who is so drunk he can't think," ~aid George Dimitry, a retired ea_cher of English. . 
''But on the second day and thereafter I shall be thinking and watching. If the Israelis are arrogant and defiant, as they are said to be, then · it won't work."

At the heart of the treaty is Israel's withdrawal over three years from the Sinai desert. 
A score ofJewish settlements are to be dismantled, "a pain" that Begin says he will suffer to his last days. 
Also, Israeli airfields will be de­mobilized and handed over to Egypt for civilian use. 
In return, Egypt ahs recog­

restrained celebrations 
TEL AVIV (AP) -Although worried about the price of their treaty with Egypt, Israelis put up flags and banners procahm­ing "Shalom" in honor of the dawn of peace yesterday after 30 years as a fortress counrry at war. 
Celebrations were restrained, and Israelis in this city of 380,· 000 showed little inclination to rejoice spontaneously. Officials left the opotion of whether to organize celebrations up to 
local communities. 

Large screen were erected in several towns so Israelis could gather in public and watch the live telecast of the Washington signing ceremony. A spec~ I stamp was issued in honor of peace, and quickly sold out. Youth movement members laid flowers on the tombs of war dead throughout the country. 
The newspaper Maariv 
splashed color reproductions of 
the Egyptian, Israeli and Amer­
ican flag across its front page 
and editorialized: ''This is the 
day we hoped for." 

But Ettie Shahar, a 25-year-old 
hairstylist, reflected the mis­
givings of many Israelis when 
she said: 'I'm scared. Even if 
the Egyftians do want peace, 
how wil they stay out if other 
Arab states attack us? How can 
they stand against their own 
brothers?'' 

Social worker Rachel Aran said: 
"I feel I don't know enough 
about what we are giving up. I 
get the feeling that each time 
we made a concession we left 
the Egyptians with less prob­
lems in case they want to attack 
us in the future. "

CLC votes to add OC tc tnem.bership 
by Don Schmid 
StaffReporter 

The Campus Life Council 
(CLC) voted last night to add the judicial cO< ·-dina tor and the off-campus commissioner to the studem membership of the CLC. 
Three of the four bunches of studem government (Student Body Presidem, Student Union, Hall President's Council, and the Judicial Council) are al­ready represented on the CLC. 
By adding the off-campus commissioner to its member­ship, the CLC will seek to handle off campus problems. The CLC feels the Off Campus Commission has not proved to be an effective body for dealing with these problems in the past. 
The council also discussed the question of the HPC's student representation on the 
CLC. The CLC voted to set up a transition committee consisnng of the four current hall vice­presidents serving on the CLC. The committee/lans to educate candidates an voters and to stay in touch with the HPC about next year's student representation. 
The CLC also passed a resolution recommending that next year's CLC consider ex­panding the pool of potential candidates for student repre­sentation.

Women~ 
Week 
by Pam Degnan StaffReporter 

Plans for Women's Week, scheduled for Apr. 2-6, were finalized last night at the Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting. Emphasizing the role of women in music, literature and dance, Women's Week will focus upon the cultural achieve­ments of women from the Notre Dame and SMC campuses as well as from the South Bend area. 
On Monday, Apr. 2, a film, ''Anonia Greco: Porrrait of a Woman," will be shown at 
7:45 a.m. in the dining hall and again in the snack shop at 10 
p.m. The film fea~ures the spirited life of Antonta Greco, the first woman ever to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. At 4 p.m., Gloria Kauffman, author of Feminist Humor, will give a presentation in Stapleton Lounge (LeMans Hall). Scheduled for 7 p.m. in Moreau Hall, artist Mar~o Huf will exhibit works depicung the evolution of women through art. 
On Tuesday in Stapleton Lounge, two presentations en­titled: "Fragmemation," and "Women in the Ancient Arts," will be offered at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., respectively. A repeat showing of the Greco film will be shown in Carroll Hall at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday's acttv1ttes are highlighted by a presentation to be given by the Indiana W omc;n Caucus for Ans at 1 p.m. m Stapleton Lounge and a poetry reading session sponsored by

The CLC amended and passed a proposal that requests the Provost to present an annual report on the implemen­tation of the coeducation pro­gram submitted by the commit­tee to evaluate coeducation last year. The program endorsed by the Board of Trustees in May of 1978. 
The CLCurged the Provost to give this program the highest priority. They also sou~~t clarification as to which admini­strators are charged with the execution of each proposal in­cluded in the program, and what action has and will be taken on these proposals. 
Security reports

cnmes 

byJohn McGrath Senior StaffReporter 
Notre Dame Security re­
ported only two incidents of 
criminal activity over spring 
break. Director of Security Joe 
Wall reponed that a stereo was 
stolen from a room in Carroll 
Hall, and that a bomb threat 
was received from a caller who 
reponed that a bomb had been 
planted in the baseme~t of the 
Memorial Library. 

The stereo was stolen from 
Room 405 Carroll Hall. The 
break-in was reported to secur­
ity ~t 2:58 a.m. Saturday 
mormng. 

Reginald Payne a resident of 
409 Carroll, reported that he 
had heard something fall in the 
room down the hall and notified 
the rector. 

''After I called, I went down 
to check out what was going on 
and I saw that the panels were 
broken on the door," Payne 
said. Apparently , the intruder 
gained access through the 
damaged door. 

The owner of the stolen 
stereo equipment, who asked to 
remain unidentified, estimated 
the stereo's worth at between 
$1400 and $1500 brand-new. He 
reported that a receiver, tape 
deck, turntable, and two 
speakers, were all taken in the 
break-in. Nothing else was 
reported missing. 

Wall reported that the bomb 
threat was _received Saturday 
night at 8:58. The caller was 
identified only as ''a real young 
female." The Notre Dame Fire 
Department was notified while 
security personnel combed the 
basement of the library in 
search of explosive devices. No 
bomb was found. 

Wall also reported that secur­ity has placed new stop signs at two campus intersections. Three-way stop signs have been placed at the intersection of the Saint Mary's Road and Lake Road near the Grotto, and at the interesection of Notre Dame Ave. and Dorr Rd. near the main gate. 
Wall indicated, however, that only two of the planned three signs have been erected at the Notre Dame Ave. intersection. Inbound traffic on Notre Dame Ave. must now stop as well as traffic flowing toward the main gate from Dorr Rd. A sign

Understanding the Gay Rights Issue 
Editor's Note: The following is "happy," is used· to define the first in a series ofcolumns those that are not necessarily dealing with the subject of bogged down by sexual stereo-homosexuality. The author of typing and conditioning, that the columns is a member ofthe gay people have the potential Gay Students of Notre Dame for being the happiest of per-and Saint Mary's, an organiza­sons since they do not hmit tion currently seeking-official their sexual and romantic recognition from the Univer­attractions, then the issue sity. might become more clear. 
This brings us to the second 
Almost a month after the general point. Obviously, from television program that what we see or read about, featured four gay srudents of most gay people seem far from Notre Dame, it seems time to the "happiest of persons." follow up with a few articles on Their lives seem wrought with the subject. As one of the four problems of infidelity, promis­srudents, I feel I have a lot to cuity, and general malcontent. say about the program, -the Here lies the great fallacy of reactions that followed, and gay life. Although it may be about the subject of being gay true that a lot of gay people are in general. One of the most discontent, it has nothing to do startling facts about being gay with their gayness per se. The at Notre Dame and Saint real problem is the gay's Mary's is the near-ignorance adjustment into a terribly that most srudents and faculty straight world, one that is filled have about. gay people and-with straight ~hilosophies, 
about gay life. I hope I can clear up some of the miscon­ceptions and provide pertinent information for all the gay people who are too afraid to "come out" as well as all the straights here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Before I discuss specifics, some general ideas should be 
brought forward. Terminology is always a problem in such Issues, so perhaps we can rron that out right away. First, it is 
. best to think of lifestyles or sexual preferences as either homosexual or heterosexual, and not to consider persons as such. A person is not a homosexual or a heterosexual unless he or she likes to think of themselves as purely sexual. I believe this 1S one of the reasons the terms "gay" and "straight" came into use. 
For most, 'j'ay'' means homosexual an "straight" means heterosexual. But, according to Donald Clark Ph.D., a psychologist -and author of the book Loving Someone Gay, the label "gay" refers to a broad sexual prefer­ence. A person is gay when he or she recognizes the potential for sexual attraction to and fulfillment from both sexes. A person is straight if they recog nize this potential for members of the opposite sex only. Dr. Clark says that if you have ever been attracted to a member of the same sex, if you have ever become sexually aroused by looking at a member of the same sex, then you are gay. Therefore, he says, all of us are born gay and either remain that way or rum straight. 
Granted, this view see.rns immediately objectionable for most. But it makes sense when applying Clark's defmition of hte word gay. The unfortunate problem is that, these days, the term gay carries many adopted synonyms: queen, fag, priss, and the rest. If people would only understand that the term gay, a true synonymt for straight instiruuons, and a strai~ht mind-set. One fmds this m full glory here in the ND-SMC community. Several aspects are involved. 
When a person realizes he is gay, i.e. that he can be attracted to both sexes, especi­ally if he has a homosexual

Subsidize Medical Education 
Many junior pre-med sru­
dents spent their spring breaks 
srudying for the dreaded Med­
ea! College Admission Test. 
Frightening to these and to 
juniors across the nation, 
however, is the fact that the 
relatively few students 
admitted to medical schools 
may be reduced substantially; 
those who do gain admittance 
will face ruition so high that 
collectively, they will borrow 
some $250 million by gradua­
tion; with interest, they will 
have to repay $875 million. The 
reason: a proposed cut in 
federal funding. 

President Carter in his fiscal 
1980 budget has proposed clip­
ping the entire program of 
tederal payments to medical colleges. The schools and the students have reason to worry because the Senate save the President a partial victory; it reduced funding for the . pro-
his life. But, once he faces this, he must confront the world around him which is generally unaccepting. At frrst, or per­haps for many years (if not for the rest of his life), the gay person will have to h1de what he truly feels. He cannot talk about it with friends and family. 
He cannot read about it openly, but must hide in locked rooms looking up faulty defmitions in backward encyclopedias. He cannot date the people he would like to, nor kiss, hold hands with, or dance with the people he would like to. He must remain completely celi­bate, even to the extent of refraining from noticing people that attract him. Or he may go a different route and experience all sorts of sexual endeavors in seedy men's rooms and book store back rooms. These are his options. 
If he has "come out" to his good friends and has managed to meet some gay people, he maY. begin to lose his forced cehbacy or decadence. But his gay social life must be confined to clandestine meetings with other gay people and weekend trips to the local gay bar. Gay bars are known for their pro-atmosphere. Narurally--they are the only placeswhere gay people can act the way they feel, and the only placethey can socialize. 
If a gay person has come out to the world, he still has a limited social life. fn fact, his life can become even more of a struggle than before. Half of his concern for sexual freedom is well expressed in intellectual talks and relevant conversa­tions with straight friends, family members, maybe even television interviewers. But the other half, his romantic, rela-. tionship-oriented side is still lacking. If he has developed a relationship with one person, all the amenities of the relation­ship seem best left behind closed doors. Very few straights will tolerate a gay couple walking hand in hand down the street. 
If he hasn't developed a relationship, he is still forced to find fulfillment at the bar.,; or the "baths." The baths are, all things considered,places for gay people to go to have sex for one all-mclusive co~er charge. Why do such places exist? Why are gay bars usually sex-oriented? In most of the volved sex is a common aspect of life. All the Jess intense 
-,aspects of relationships are not allowed. It is like forcing a person to have only one meal a week. Of course he will guzzle down the meal with little con­cern for table manners, dinner conversation or personal hygiene. And, probably, he will get sick afterwards. Thus we have the unhappiness in gay life--not because lt is inherently unhappy, but because most of the ume it is not allowed to be anything else. All of these things--tbe ignorance of gay people about their own lives, the unaccept­ance, the clandestine atmos­phere, the promiscuity, and the lack of stability in gay relation­ships--are Eroblems that become ma~nified when placed in an envrronment like the ND-SMC community. Not only is gay life unaccepted, but · it is relatively unknown. I will never foq~et talking with a straight fnend about the issue before telling him I was gay. "You mean there are gay people here at Notre Dame?" he said with wide eyes. I knew I was irrfor a long conversation. 

gram in the fiscall979 budget. Government sources argue that there is no longer a need for funding because there is no longer a shortage of doctors; instead, _the current problem is that doctors are poorly distri· buted in terms of geography and specializatons. Although the physician shortage may be at end, even more federal funding is presently needed to cure the latter problem. 
True, it is politically unfash· ionable to advocate mcreased federal spending during a time ofeconomic austerity, but med­ical colleges depend on federal aid. It 1s unfair to suddenly forget the schools that have responded to national needs; the main focus of the funding in the first place was to increase the numbers of doctors in anticipation of a shortage, and consequently medical school enrollments have increa&ed substantially. Ironically, the colleges must now suffer because they have successfully increased the supply of doctors. 
In fact, Cornell Medical Col­lege estimates that without federal monies, ruition would increase twenty percent. 
Instead of subsidizing med­
. ical schools, Congress proposed a srudent loan program where young doctors could face pay­ments as high as 25 percent of their income. This huge educa­tional · debt forces a youn~ doctor into a high paying speci­alty in a metropolitan hosf1tal. Therefore, it is impractica for a youns doctor to start his own practice or to become a family doctor in a small town where doctors are badly needed. The loan program, then, fails as an alternative to direct federal subsidies. The problem is that the taxpayer ultimately finances

the young doctor's debt in the form of higher doctor's bills. So, why should the taxpayer pay billions in interest when it 1s far cheaper for him to give the money away through educa­tional grants? Ifmedical educa­tion was subsidized, the tax­payers would save much more 1n the long run in the form of lower doctor's bills. 
What is proposed here is the federal subsidization of medical education. It will solve the current problem of the poor distribunon of physicians; with­out educational debt as a bur­den, young doctors can freely choose where to work and in what to specialize. And, subsi­dizaton will save taxpayer's money in the form of lower doctors' bills.

Magical Message -the Amazing Kreskin 
by Mike Cervini 
Energy! People want it, need it and seek it. Kreskin's got it! Kreskin tapping People Energy! 
Can you sell it? No! Can you horde it? No!! Can you at least trade it? No!!! What the heck can you do with it? Give it!!! 
Positive energy force could easily describe the world's most fam0us mentalist. But, "wonderment for lift·, says Kreskin, those would be my words." 
Wonderment, astonishment, bewil­derment, it makes little difference, they all fit, plus many more. But, leave the magician's trunk behind, let the abracadabras and presto changos fade, Kreskin' s talents contain a relevant message for us all. 
"If I had to narrow it down to two words," says Kreskin, "Love and compassion, that's what's important:" 
And the entertainer's "nothing up the sleeve" performances bear out that claim. The message keeps coming through; feel for other people! 
Kreskin's abilities ace not supema­tural. Quite the contrary! "The abilities I have," streses the 42-yeac­old performer," ace inherent in every­one." Does this mean that an ''Amazing' Kreskin' ' lies buried in every "joe" around the block, or maybe even the rector of my hall? NO!! Whew! "The average person," says Kreskin, "has too mariy outside distractions to really develop his capabilities." 
Then, what does it mean? "Empathy," continues Kreskin, silver specks glisten in his sandy brown hair as he moves intently forward in his chair. "We must get in touch with others by getting within another's feelings." 
Kreskin, a Seton Hall graduate and part time college instructor, is ex­tremely aware of the tension and social r.roblems on today's campuses. 
'Drugs and alcohol can be replaced by mind expanding techniques. Take something as simple as running. While you're moving, concentrate on the colors and beauty surcrounding 
you. It can become a kind of natural 
high." 

People sit and watch Kreskin per­
form one astounding feat after 
another, but many miss what it's really 
all about. The natural feelings that 
exist between people, that's the key. 
That's what Kreskin manipulates to 
accomplish his fantastic demonstra­
tions. He is hyper-sensitive, not 
extra-sensitive! 

''I'd like my abilities to be a force for change," explains the native New Jersian. "I have a great concern for 'the future." His 684 performances in 1978 is evidence of that concern. "I would like to make as many people as possible aware of things · they never realized before. I would like the satisfaction of knowing that I commu­nicated certain truths in a very 
dramatic way." 

Since the vast majority of his 
audiences ace college students, one of 
those truths contains a message for the 
them. "There ace no easy answers. 
Everything we have has to be earned, 
otherwise we'll let it slip away." 
Kreskin calls Notre Dame his second 
home. "Class that's what Notre Dame 
means." He feels no .students 
generate a genuine warmth. 
Expressing warmth is easy around 
this outgoing performer. Everyone is 
greeted with a piston like handshake, a 
big smile and half a hug around the 
shoulders. Kreskin and whoever he 
meets form an automatic symbiosis. 
He gives them energy, they give him 
energy and everybody vaults to a 
hi~her plane. It's natural electricity. 
H1s personality is sure energy in its 
conta~ious state. We're fortunate that 
Kreskm has brought his infection 
among us. 

"I'll keep performing, even 20 years 
from now. I want to keep to the 
abilities God has given me." 
Presently, Kreskin is looking for­ward to March 20. He will be playing a chess match blindfoldd, against two world champions at the United Nations Hotel in New York. 
I'm not one to predict the future, but 
I guarantee the result will be truly 
amazing!

10:00 pm Music at the Nazz -Stever Rogers and Tim Keogh, Sue Georgen and Bruce McCaffrey As anrone who truly has grown up 
knows, fairy tales ace not just for 
children. 
In fact, the late author of the 
fantastic ''The Chronicles of Nacnia,'' 
thought avoiding fairy tales was 
immature. ''When I was ten, I read 
fairy tales in secret," C.S. Lewis 
confessed, "and would have been 
ashamed ifI had been found doing so. 
Now that I am fifty I read them openly. 
When I became a man I put away 
childish things, includin~ the fear of 
childishness and the deslfe to be very 
grown-up.'' 
This spring, adults can follow Lewis' lead and jom their children in the enjoyment of the first television adap­tation of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the first book in Lewis' "Chronicles" series. The 2-part animated special produced by the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) and solely sponsored by Kraft, will air at 8:00p.m. (ES'I) April I and 2 on the CBS Television Network. 
In recent years the Children's Television Workshop, best known for it award-winning series, "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company," has expanded the scope of its pro­grammmg to include shows for family audiences. Recognizing the universal appeal of "The Lion," CTW obtained television rights for the story from the Episcopal Radio-1V Foundation, Inc., which had been assigned broadcast rights by the Lewis estate. 
Kraft, Inc., a company which has been outsP.oken about the need for better family pro~ramming, decided to sponsor the proJect, and .t~e Special was announced at a JOint press conference December 14, 1977. 
Lewis' Following Grows 
Lewis' captivating series of seven stories which comprise ''The Chronicles" has gathered an ever­growing following of adults as well as children since the first book was published in 1950. The Macmillan Company, U.S. publishers of the series, reports it sells more than a million copies annually, with college campuses accounting for an important share of the sales. 
Perhaps one reason Lewis' fairy tales ace read by adults and children is that he wrote them for his own 

On CBS-TV 
pleasure. He did not stop to think what children would enjoy. Rather, 
' Lewis liked eating, so he put in plenty ofgood food; he liked magic and myth, so he added witches and centaurs and nymphs. Lewis believed that persons who enjoyed what he did would read the story and re-read it whatever their age. As he once explained in a lecture, ''I am almost inclined to set it up as a canon that a children's story which is enjoyed only by children is a bad children's story. The good ones last." ''The Lion, the Witch and the W acdrobe'' is the story of two brothers and two sisters who cross through an 
enchanted wardrobe into the m=~~~al 
world of Nacnia, land of t · g animals and mythical creatures. They discover Nacnia is under the evil power of the White Witch who brings eternal winter to the land and turns her enemies to stone. The Witch bribes the younger brother to betray the others, but they escape her clutches and join the noble lion Aslan to lead the forces of good. The Witch is defeated; and the children become rulers ot Nacnia until magic returns them to their former lives. 
Lessons of''The Lion'' 
Young and old readers of the story ace attracted by its humanity. While the basic struggle is between good and evil, none of the characters is perfect except Asian, the creator and guiding force of Nacnia. The creatures of Nacnia and the children exhibit various human weaknesses which they must 
-overcome to survive. 
There ace lessons here in love, friendship, loyalty, brave.ry and honesty, although the author said he did not start out to write a moral tale. Lewis, whose stories originated with "pictures" in his mind, aClvised other writers, "Let the pictures tell you their own moral. For the moral inherent in them will rise from whatever spiritual roots you have succeeded in strikin~ during the whole course of your life.' 
Lewis believed that the only moral of any value, like the only story of ;uty value, had to come from within. For him, the best authors of so-call "children's" stories wrote from "the 
-common, universally human, ground they share with the children, and indeed with countless adults."

PARIS (AP)-Legend has it that on Aug. 2~. 1944, while the rest of the Allies were liberating Paris, Ernest Hemin~way head­ed straight for the Rttz, person­ally liberating the hotel bar where he had spent so many days and nights during the golden era between wars. 
The same legend, embellished over the years, says the writer blasted a hole in one of the famed hotel's toilets with a gun. 
The first part of the tale has been verified by the barman who recalls Hemingway arriv­in~ in his war correspondent's untform with a submachine gun over his shoulder. The question of the toilet, however, remains legend and is part of the hazy body of fact and fant~sy sur­rounding what probably is the world's best known hotel. 
The Ritz, whose name now is part of many languages as synonymous with elegance and luxury, still attracts the world's richest and most discerning visitors, but ownership of the 80-year-old institution on the Place Vendome has passed to a secret Arab consortium. 
Ritz managing director Ber­nard Penche confirmed last week that the majority of shares had been transferred form a British company to Ritz Paris Holdings Ltd., a company based on the British tax haven island of Jersey. The only name known to be attached to the company is that of Mo­hammed AI Fayad, a 50-year­old British businessman of Egy­ptian birth. The French press reports a sale price of$42.8 million and that is only for the building and good­will. The solid-gold land of the Place Vendome underneath re­mains the property of French interests. 
There is widespread specula­tion that other Arab investors are behind Fayad. A group of Saudi Arabian oil magnates wanted to buy the hotel but pulled out when the French government demanded a 25­year guarantee that it remain a hotel, not be made into chic

offices. 
A hotel spokesman said the change in ownership will not mean a change from the phil­osophy of Cesar Ritz, the Swiss hotelier who established the Ritz in 1898, stressing ele­gance, atmosphere, service, and above all, discretion and privacy for guests. 
There Is o conncection now ·be­tween the Ritz here and any other Ritz hotel, but the hotel has a copyright on the name and any hotel wishing to use it must ask permission. 
Asked once for his definition of 
"Ritz," Charles Ritz, the foun­
der's son who died in 1976, 
replied: "Ritzy simply means 
reasonable perfection.'' 
In an effort to achieve that ''reasonable perfection,'' the hotel always has maintained a ratio of two staff members for each guest. 
The Ritz is not the world's lar­gest hotel, not the most expen­sive. Its 209 rooms range from about $9~ for a single to about $156 for a double, plus a 15 percent service charge. There are 46 suite.s, including three grand suites, the largest of which costs $600 a day. 
"It's not a snob hotel, but a hotel of privacy and descre­tion," the spikesman said. People like to be called by their names, he said, not referred to as room numbers. 
''The Ritz is your home away from home," he said. That is, of course, if you have the means and taste for such a home. 
Marcel Proust, one of the hotel's early habitues who has known to send a driver to the Ritz at odd hours for iced beer, said he liked the hotel because "there is not jostling." Indeed, the first impression one receives when passing through the main entrance is quiet, uncrowded tranquility. People speak in low voices. Employees slip quietly about their duties or wait unobtrusively for the slightest sign from the custom­ers. The history of the Ritz' clientele is a veritable Who's Who: 

Dance Theatre to perform 
from the classical to the con­temporary, will comprise the first act. 
"Glass Menagerie" will open the concert. Also on the program are "What Was That?", "Waltz for One," ''Death Shall Have No Domi­nion," "Youth," "Ghost Dance" and "Gotta Move." 
Tickets for the Southold Dance Theatre Sprin~ Concert are $3.50 and available at Century Center and the O'Laughlin box office.

The German Luftwaffe chose the Ritz during the occupation. Coco Chane! was a resident for years and died at the hotel in 1971. Richard Nixon enjoyed the strict privacy of the Ritz while preparing for a 1978 apJ?earance on French tele­vtston. 
"Discretion is the first rule," the hotel spokesman said. "If somebody tells us he does not want to be disturbed, nobody can reach him, not even his wife, not even in an emer­gency." 
Remembering a !11-dy' s favorite flowers, a customer's particular whim or favorite room, sug­gesting wines from the famous cellar, advising on the theater, arranging transportation, or carrying out personal errands are what the hotel always has considered its duty. 
But the clientele, 60 J.>ercent of 
it American, is changmg. The 
leisured rich are scarce and the 
businessman is the new class. 
The Ritz mana~ement does not 
seek large busmess meetings, 
preferring small receptions, 
luncheons and private dmners. 
Why has the Ritz over the years 
been such a magnet for Amer­
icans? 
''Americans will spend more 
money for deluxe accommo­
dations," the spokesman said. 
"It's a mentality. Germans 
may have as much moeny, but 
not the mentality. In America, 
the Ritz is a symbol. 
People at the Ritz are aware of 
their rich history but do not dwell on it. They pride them­selves on keeping up with the modern amemties while main­taining the traditional style, paintings, marble and tapes tries. Suites are wood-paneled, with old, highly polished brass fittings. Four pushbuttons will call the maid, the winewaiter, room service -or the guest's personal serva11t in his quar­ters.

reunttes with family 
GREAT LAKES, Ill. (AP)­Jack Garwood said yesterday 
there is "no way" that his son, Marine Pfc. Robert Garwood, who was missing in Vietnam for nearly 'l4 years, is guilty of desertion or other charges that could lead to his execution. 
"Idon't believe them (the charges), "the senior Garwood said. He added that whatever his son did, it should warrantpo more than "a spanking." · 
The elder Garwood said nod~ ing could compare with his re': union with his son, who was de­clared a prisoner ofwar in 1965. 
The Marine's brother said it "started raining in the room." 
The reunion came Sunday after Garwood, accused of desertion and collaborating with the Viet Cong, arrived at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center where he is undergoing medical tests. 
His father said at a news con. 
ference yesterday he had not 
lieved he would see· his son un­
til "I could reach out and touch 
him. Then I knew it was my 
boy. Beautiful. Best thing that 
could ever happen to anybody. 
I still haven't gotten over it. 
Butterflies.'' 
Garwood, a 33-year-old Indiana 
Molarity 
native, could face a firing squad 
if convicted of all five charges . brought against him. 
The senior Garwood, from Greens burt, Ind., said that when he first saw his son in the hospital room Sunday, "We just looked up, and hugged each other something fierce. It was beautiful. " ­

ND's size over-whelm.s Rockets 
by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
INDIANAPOUS--Toledo for­ward Jim Swaney wasn't about to make any excuses. But nevertheless, he couldn't help mentioning how Notre Dame's bulk played an important part in a 79-71 Irish victory on March 16 at Market Square Arena. 
''Underneath that basket it was really brutal," confessed the Rockets' representative on the all-Mideast Re~ional squad. 
"I wear a mouthptece, because I always go up against bigger guys--and I still lost a tooth out there." ~ 
Despite the dental loss, Swa­ney and Company never lost faith in their mission to upset co:tch Digger Phelps' Irish, whp were seeded at the top of the Mideast field. The Rockets of coach Bob Nichols, after takin~ bump~, bruises and a 10-pomt deflmt (43-33) into the locker room at the half, battled back to give Notre Dame a somewhat unex­pected scare late in the game. 
''They just never gave up,_'' said Notre Dame guard Btll Hanzlik. "Toledo has the toughest players, not necessari­ly talent-wise, that we've faced all year." 
Rocket center Dick Miller found some holes in Notre Dame's man-to-man defense, and hit Swaney underneath for two straight layups with 4:54 remaining, liftmg Toledo to within one point, 62-61. 
But after Irish forward Kelly Tripucka retaliated with a third­effort bucket with 4:11 remain­in~, Notre Dame switched to a stmgy zone defense, a~d To­ledo's offense became vtrtually inqperative. 
Hanzlik hit both ends of a one-and-one with 3:51 left, giving the Irish a five-point cushion. And after the Green and Gold rebounded a Miller airball moments later, they spread out their offense with three-and-a-half minutes to kill. 
Tracy ] ackson hit Rich Bran­ning for a backdoor layu.P at 1:49, and with 1: 17 left, Tnpuc­ka drove the left baseline for an opposite-hand stuff. It was Notre Dame's eighth straight point, giving the Irish a 70­61 lead and the inevitable opportunity to meet the winner ofthe Michigan State-Louisiana State contest for the regional title. 
"It was a very wise move on their part to ~o to a zone in the second half, ' said Nichols of Notre Dame's strategy. "They did a good job on the boards. That really hurt us in the first half.'' Notre Dame's 10-point inter­mission advantage was greatly due to its contr,Jl of both backboards. Toledo, which only managed on offensive rebound in the ~ <JI.(a, was outrebounded 18-9 ir. the first 20 minutes. 
Both teams shot well during the contest. Notre Dame was accurate on 53.8 percent of its chances, while Toledo hit at a .506 accuracy. But when the chips were down, it was Notre Dame that cashed in on them. 
"I really can't think of one turning point,'' offered Nichols.

''In the second half we pulled within one point, but either we couldn't make the shot that counts or they made a bigger play than we did." 
Swaney led all scorers with 26 points, while Miller was the only other scorer in double figures for the Mid-American Conference school. 
Tripucka led the Irish with 24 points. Hanzlik had 14, while Orlando Woolridge and Rich Branning respectively contribu­ted 11 and 10 points.

It wasn't until the second halt that the Irish began to consis­tently connect from the peri­meter, however. And when they finally got their offense on track, their defense fell apart. 
''At the beginning of the sec­ond half we had that two-min­ute spurt which looked like we would be right back in the ~arne," said Phelps. "But they JUSt adjusted well.'' 
"Defensively is where we broke down. Everytime we made a run at them offensively, we ended up trading baskets.'' And that was' · the story for the entire secon':! half. Whenever the Irish would draw blood, the Spartans were quick to retal­iate.

Michigan State cages Bird to capture title 
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -Michi~an State threw a net around Larry Bird with a brilhant zone defense and Earvin ''Magic'']ohnson scored 24 points as the Spartans defeated the Indiana State Sycamores 75-64 Monday to win the NCAA basketball championships. 
The loss ended a Cinderella season for the Sycamores, who had stormed out of nowhere to the top of The Associated Press poll and had won 33 straight games before the final. 
Bird, who had been killing just about everyone this season with a 29.0 scoring average, had to work hard for his 19 points against the Spartans' two-three zone, which sagged on the blond bomber every time he went to the basket. 
The national championship was the first for Michigan State in its fourth appearance in this tournament. 
The Sycamores never led after the opening minutes and trailed by as many as 16 points several times early in the second half. But they made it interesting with a late 12-2 flurry behind Bird that chopJ?ed Michigan State's advantage to 52-46 with 10 m10utes left in the game. 
Johnson then spearheaded a rally that put the Spartans in command and quieted the usually raucous Indiana State fans in the noisy crowd of 15,410. 
] ohnson scored seven points in an 8-4 burst that moved the Big Ten Conference power's lead to 61-50 with 5:06 left in the game. 
The Sycamores never came within striking distance of the Spartans after that. 
Bird, who had been a terror in this tournament in four J?revious games, was so stymied by the rugged Michtgan State defense that at one point he went more than 13 minutes without a field goal. 
Four trouble hurt both teams in the closely called game, and the calls had both coaches bitterly complaining to the officials throughout the contest. 
Greg Keiser, who scored 19 points for the Spartans, put the cap on the game wtth an enormous slam dunk at the end and the Michigan State cheerleaders and some supporters rushed to hug their heroes. · 
While the Michigan State players danced joyously around the court, Bird sat disconsolately on the bench with his head buried in a towel, his great college career ended. . 
Bird, playing with a broken left thumb that never seemed to bother him earlier, was only able to connect on 7 of 21 shots from the fidd. 
Bird's eyes appeared red-rimmed when he went up to accept the runner-up trophy for the Sycamores. 
The Spartan~, though holdmg a 37-28 advanta~e, seemed to be 10 trouble because their two leadmg players, Johnson and Keiser, were saddled with three fouls apiecO\· Keiser had to sit out a good portion of the second half in foul trouble after scoring only nine points before intermission. 
Ron-Charles fouled out for Michigan State while Carl Nicks had to sit down for the Sycamores in the closim! minute~ ~f the game with five fouls.

Keiser, Spartans dunk Irish in Regionalfinals 
by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Edttor 
INDIANAPOLIS-All Gregory Kel~er needed to prepare for the tide game of the 1979 Mideast Regional was a little dare from a teammate. 
"I told Greg that (UCLA's David) Greenwood was a better clunker than he was,'' confessed Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Michigan State's sophomore ­sensation. "So he wanted to prove himself today." 
_Keiser had no problem proving himself to a Market Square Arena thron~ of 17,423, let alone a nation-wide television audtence, as he led his Spartans to an 80-68' disposal of Notre Dame on March 18. 
The senior forward, conductio~ a clinic on dunking, while scoring a game-htgh 34 points, rammed the leather home six times in the contest. Three of those slams came on textbook-illustrated alley-oop passes from Johnson, who enjoys watching Keiser do it more, perhaps, than Keiser enjoys actually doing it. 
"I just love to see Greg dunk," tingled Johnson after his 13-assist performance. "I just get so ftred up when he goes up, because he hangs there so long. 
It looks just like a cartoon to me." While it looked like a nightmare to the Irish, the Spartans made it look so easy. 
''] ust a little eye contact between us let's us know we're doing it," said Keiser of the tob plays. And after shaping his hands as if gripping a basketball, Keiser added, "When I see that pass coming, my eyes get about this big. '' 
Irish eyes, on the other hand, were anything but smiling on this post-St. Patrick's Day event. Notre Dame, which never had the lead in the contest, was forced to play catch-up right off the opening tip. 
Johnson's first assist came on that opening play, as he fed guard Michael Brkovich for an uncontested stuff. And the third-ranked Spartans were on their way to their best performance of the season. 
"They ~ot the momentum for good on the opening play," satd Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps, who was hoping for his second straight regional championship. ''It was just an avalanche after that." 
After Irish forward Kelly Tripucka managed to tie the score at 6-6, Brkovich scored five unanswered points in 34 seconds, and State had begun to control the tempo by successfully running on the Irish. 
Keiser, after missin~ his ftrst five attempts from the floor, was re~ponstble for all of MSU's next 14 points in a stretch which lifted the Spartans to a 25-16 advantage with 5:03 left in the ftrst half. 
The Irish, who went in to the locker room trailing, 34-23, at halftime, couldn't seem to buy a bucket 10 the initial stanza, hitting at a . 3 57 accuracy. Michigan State's match-up zone, coupled with Notre Dame's inability to attack it, negated the highly necessary Irish mside game. 
"We wanted to stop Tripucka inside and (Bill) Hanzlik outside," said victorious coach Jud Heath­cote. "That worked pretty well, except that Tracy Jackson started hitting from out."

~ little science anda little too much Magic' 
There are some people who might say that a basketball team is a little like a car. Like different basketball squads, each car has its own character, and some cars (and teams) are bet<:er than others. For this reason we offer this story: 
Once upon a time there were two fancy 1979 cars. Each were top models in their class, and their manufacturers hoped they would be the top machines in the NCAA (National Car and Auto Association). One was a rugged Irish sedan, the. other a sleek Spartan sports car. 
The 1979 Irish sedan was supposed to be a vintage model. The people at ND Corporation and Phelps Engineering brought back all the features from last year's model, .and that was their most successful machine. 
On~ advantage the Irish sedan had was great mileage. What it lacked in speed it made ue for in long distance power. The sedan got more mdes per gallon than most other models. 
But more importantly, the people at Phelps Engineering had brou~ht the sedan down this road before and knew what tt took to come out on top. For that reason they used the same parts for this year's model, all with improvements. The ND Corporation thought they had the car of the year. 
But the folks at MSU Motores also thou ht the had

a great machine, a for the sleek Irish sedan. The Spartan sports car was all speed and flashy brilliance. What it lacked in mileage it made up for with a lot of get up and go. 
And the Spartan had another edge, what its advertising department like to call "a little science and a little Magic." 
The MSU people had the "Magic" in last year's model, ·and founo that it did amazing things for the car. But the rest of the parts in the machine did not know what the "Magic" was going to do all the time, and sometimes the car did not perform right. 
-That's where the science came in, as the Heathcote chemists tuned themachineso the rest of the car could anticipate what the "Magic" was going to do, and the car was improved. 
The road was a bumpy one for both of the cars over' the year, as they both en'o ed bein ranked the to car in the country, but also lost out to some supposedly weaker competition. But both made it to the NCAA judging, and were both confident they could make it to the finals on the Salt Lake flats of Utah. 
The Irish sedan won out over its ftrst two competitors in the Mideast Sales Region, using its power, mileage, and experience to outrun some younger competitors. 
Ano the Spartan sports car cruised over some tough cars to also reach the finals in the Mideast Region. Many experts thought that whoever emerged from this pair would win ~l-te car of the year title. 
And so they met head to head. Power against speed, mileage against the "Magic." 
But in the end, it was the "science," the chemistry of the Spartan sports car that enabled it to run rings around the rugged Irish sedan. The S~artan performed so smoothly, and all the mileage m the world couldn't keep it from pulling past the ND Corp. entry. The "Magic" and the chemistry worked together, and they made the sports car unbeatable. 
The Spartan model continued its smooth sailing at the Salt Flats, downing an unexpected entry out of Pennsylvania, the Penn Quaker, ~nd then defeating the tough Sycamore Thunder-birdtn the final stretch,
